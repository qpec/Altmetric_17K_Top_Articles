Abstract
Microglia are central nervous system (CNS)-resident cells. Their ability to migrate outside of
the CNS, however, is not understood. Using time-lapse imaging in an obstetrical brachial
plexus injury (OBPI) model, we show that microglia squeeze through the spinal boundary
and emigrate to peripheral spinal roots. Although both macrophages and microglia respond,
microglia are the debris-clearing cell. Once outside the CNS, microglia re-enter the spinal
cord in an altered state. These peripheral nervous system (PNS)-experienced microglia can
travel to distal CNS areas from the injury site, including the brain, with debris. This emigra-
tion is balanced by two mechanisms—induced emigration via N-methyl-D-aspartate recep-
tor (NMDA) dependence and restriction via contact-dependent cellular repulsion with
macrophages. These discoveries open the possibility that microglia can migrate outside of
their textbook-defined regions in disease states.
Author summary
Cells are precisely organized in specific anatomical domains to ensure normal functioning
of the nervous system. One such cell type, microglia, is usually considered to be confined
to the central nervous system (CNS). Using time-lapse imaging to capture microglia as
they migrate, we show that their characteristic CNS-residency can be altered after spinal
root injury. After such injury, the microglia exit the spinal root to the periphery, where
they clear debris at the injury site and then carry that debris back into the CNS. In addi-
tion, microglia that leave the CNS after spinal root injury become distinct from those that
remain within the CNS. This emigration event of microglia after injury is driven by two
mechanisms—dependence on glutamatergic signaling that induces their emigration to the
injury and interactions with macrophages that prevent their ectopic exit from the spinal
cord. Together, these discoveries raise the possibility that microglia could override their
CNS-residency in certain disease contexts.
Introduction
Microglia are the surveying phagocytic cells of the central nervous system (CNS) [1–3]. They
enter the CNS during embryonic development [4,5]. Once in the CNS, their roles include a

role in study design, data collection and analysis,
 growing list of functions, including synaptic pruning and clearance of debris from both devel-
opmental and injured cells [6–9]. During these processes, microglia transition from a survey-
ing to activated state, leading to increased cellular migration and phagocytic activity [10–12].
This microglia activation can have lasting impacts on the nervous system. For example, pollut-
ants in pregnant mice can lead to altered microglia in their progeny; such embryonic changes
are implicated to autism-like phenotypes [13]. Meanwhile, activation after spinal cord injury is
linked to neuropathic pain [14]. Despite these growing contributions of microglia to the CNS,
little is known about their role outside of the CNS domain.
There is growing evidence that cells can override their domain-specific nature [15–18].
CNS-resident cells like oligodendrocytes can reside in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in
peripheral neuropathy [15]. Similarly, both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes can populate the PNS
when boundary cells are disrupted [15–18]. These ectopically localized CNS cells migrate to the
PNS from the CNS instead of differentiating from resident PNS cells [16,17]. Despite these exam-
ples of CNS cell intrusion, microglial emigration to the PNS is not understood. In each example
of ectopic CNS cell residence, the ability of the emigrated cells to return to their respective
domains is not known. Given the highly migratory nature of microglia, their emerging roles in
circuit formation and maintenance in both healthy and disease states and their inclusions in disor-
ders such as autism, spinal cord injury, neuropathic pain, and multiple sclerosis [12,13], it is
imperative to investigate not only the full capacity of microglia to migrate to specific domains but
the consequence of such movements. Complicating this issue, microglia and macrophages are
labeled with similar molecular markers and when located outside of their resident domain, can
express the limited number of specific markers that label either microglia or macrophages.
Here, we exploit time-lapse imaging of zebrafish in a laser-induced model of obstetrical bra-
chial plexus injury (OBPI) to dissect the capacity of microglia in the PNS. Spinal root avulsion
can occur developmentally during the birth process; OBPI is a complication in an estimated 3
out of every 1,000 births [19]. We first demonstrate that pu1+ cells display stable residency in
distinct CNS and PNS domains at 4 days post fertilization (dpf) in zebrafish, a time compara-
ble to when OBPI occurs. We then show that CNS-resident microglia exit their domain to
clear PNS debris in these injuries. Despite that both macrophages and microglia respond to
these injuries, microglia function as the debris-clearing cell in both the PNS and CNS. This
emigration to the PNS alters the microglia as they re-enter the CNS and migrate to distal areas
from the injury site, including the brain. We show that the exit of microglia to the PNS is
mediated by opposing mechanisms; N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and glutamate
induce emigration, whereas contact-dependent repulsion prevents intrusion. The observation
that contact-dependent interactions of microglia with macrophages impact the cells’ anatomi-
cal position could provide insight into pathologies of diseases that contain both macrophages
and microglia in the same domain [20]. Together, these data provide evidence that microglia
function expands beyond their textbook-defined CNS-resident domain.
Results
Laser-induced injury model mimics OBPI
To model obstetrical root avulsion, we created injuries in 4 dpf zebrafish. At 4 dpf, zebrafish
have an established anatomical organization of neurons in the brain and spinal cord but myeli-
nation is ongoing, similar to newborn children (Fig 1A). Cells that compose the spinal sensory
root are organized by 2–3 dpf, before our avulsion model at 4 dpf [21,22]. These injuries were
created by exposing a 4 μm region of the spinal cord sensory root nerve to pulses of a laser in
Tg(ngn1:gfp) zebrafish, which use regulatory sequences of ngn1 to express green fluorescent
protein (GFP) in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons [21,23] (S1 Movie). To confirm that the

 region until the axonal region degraded, leaving a DRG cell soma without a central projection
(Fig 1B). This decrease was specific to the lesion site, persisted for hours, and was not created
when the peripheral projection was injured (S1C and S1D Fig). In this avulsion model, as with
obstetrical avulsions, we created injuries of varying severity (S2A–S2D Fig). We also fixed and
stained Tg(ngn1:gfp) animals at 4 dpf with anti-Sox10 and anti-GFAP post-avulsion to assess
the integrity of the GFAP+ glial limitans and Sox10+ Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes in
each injury category immediately following injury (S3A Fig). Glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) fluorescently labels the glial limitans, or the radial glial boundary. DRG cell bodies
and supporting Sox10+ cell nuclei were present and intact in uninjured animals and category I
and II injuries (S3A Fig). The GFAP+ boundary was disrupted in category III injuries with little
damage in category I–II (S3B–S3E Fig). These data recapitulate characteristics of spinal avul-
sion with varying degrees of severity but demonstrate that category I and II injuries lack mas-
sive damage of the spinal interface.
Microglia in the spinal cord respond to OBPI
In movies of these injuries, we noted that neural debris of both glial and neuronal identity was
present in both CNS and PNS regions. To investigate debris clearance, we visualized phagocytic
cells in response to injury [24] (Fig 1C, S2 Movie). To do this, we imaged Tg(pu1:gfp); Tg(sox10:
mrfp) animals, which use regulatory sequences of pu1 to express GFP in microglial and macro-
phages and sox10 to label glial and neuronal cells of sensory and spinal nerves with mRFP [25,26].
With this imaging, we first distinguished between pu1+ cells like PNS macrophages and CNS
microglia based on their stable starting location without injury (Fig 1C, S4A and S4B Fig). By defi-
nition, microglia are stable CNS-resident cells that are labeled with pu1 and anti-4C4 and are sen-
sitive to csf1r inhibitors (S4C Fig). To confirm their identity, before injuries, we stained for 4C4,
which labels microglia but not macrophages in zebrafish [27], and detected 4C4 overlap only with
CNS-located pu1+ cells and not peripheral cells (Fig 1D). These spinal cord-located 4C4+;pu1+
cells resembled well-defined microglia in the brain [5,27] (Fig 1D). Additionally, we assayed for
the microglia-specific transcript tmem119 [28] with a smFISH probes and detected colocalization
with pu1+ microglia in the spinal cord (S4F Fig). To confirm microglia in the spinal cord at 4 dpf,
we then tested that in noninjured animals, pu1+ cells in the CNS and PNS maintain their domain-
specific residency. In confocal images of the spinal cord, pu1+ cells in the spinal cord could first be
detected at 3.5 dpf. The number of pu1+ cells in the spinal cord then increased during develop-
ment. To determine their stable residency, time-lapse imaging from 4–5 dpf was used in nonin-
jured animals. Consistent with their identity as microglia, pu1+ cells in the spinal cord at 4 dpf
remained resident in the CNS (100% of microglia remained in the spinal cord, n = 5 animals).
These movies revealed that the majority of pu1+ cells that colonize the spinal cord at 4 dpf origi-
nate from the anterior, potentionally the brain region, which colonizes microglia by 2.5 dpf [26].
Not only were CNS cells marked by pu1+, 4C4, and tmem119, they were also located in the spinal
cord proper, distal from the spinal meninges space and the spinal vascular network, and were sen-
sitive to csf1r inhibitors, consistent with their classification as microglia (S4C, S4E and S4G Fig)
[2]. PNS-located pu1+ cells were similarly stable in their PNS anatomical domain in 24-hour mov-
ies. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the domain residency of pu1+ cells like
CNS-resident microglia and PNS-resident macrophages are established by 4 dpf in zebrafish, a
comparable developmental time to when OPBIs occur.
Microglia are the primary debris clearing cell at injury sites
To dissect phagocytic cellular response in OBPI, we then created injuries in Tg(pu1:gfp); Tg
(sox10:mrfp) animals. After injury, we imaged z-stacks that spanned the root and spinal cord

 every 2.5 minutes for 24 hours. Following spinal avulsion and consistent with a microglial
injury response, we visualized microglia migrated to the injury site within the first hour follow-
ing injury (Fig 1E, S5A Fig) [29,30]. In these movies, we also visualized macrophages respond-
ing immediately to the injury, traveling at an average velocity of 151.34 μm/h compared to
microglia, which respond at a velocity of 203.58 μm/h (S5B Fig). To ask whether these
responses were correlated with the size of the injury, we categorized injuries based on the
lesion size (S5C and S5D Fig). However, all size injuries provoked microglial response (S5C
and S5D Fig). To determine the migration path of these cells, we tracked individual cells and
found that the migration path of microglia and macrophages was direct (S5E Fig). Microglia
traveled 72.72 μm to injury compared to macrophages traveling 58.60 μm on average, with dif-
ferent velocities (S5B and S5F Fig). Given that both CNS and PNS cells responded, we next
asked which cells responded first by quantifying the percentage of injuries for which each cell
was a first responder. Despite the difference in distance traveled, microglia and macrophages
each were first responders 50% of the time (S5G Fig). Although macrophages outnumbered
microglia at the injury site nearly 3-fold. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that
both microglia and macrophages respond to spinal root avulsion.
Because both cells responded to the injury, we next tested whether, while at the injury site,
microglia and macrophages each clear debris. To do this, we injured Tg(pu1:gfp); Tg(sox10:
mrfp) animals, created 24-hour movies, identified CNS and PNS GFP+ cells based on their
pre-injury location, and then scored mRFP debris within GFP+ cells, a result consistent with
clearance of debris from GFP+ cells [26,31,32]. Although both macrophages and microglia
responded to injury, mRFP+ debris was present in 92% of microglia, whereas mRFP+ debris
was present in 8% of macrophages (Fig 1F and 1G), consistent with the hypothesis that micro-
glia primarily clear debris. We confirmed that the phagocytosis of mRFP+ debris from micro-
glia was specific to the injury site by scoring an average of 1.2 mRFP+ debris puncta before
microglia arrived to the injury site, which increased to 4.3 mRFP+ debris after arrival (Fig 1H).
Although mRFP+ debris was primarily in microglia, phagocytic vacuoles could be seen in both
macrophages and microglia, consistent with the previous hypotheses that both cells are capable
of phagocytosis (S6A and S6B Fig). These vacuoles were specific to the injury site, because
after arrival to injury, on average 2.18 vacuoles were present compared to the 0 vacuoles before
arrival (S6A and S6B Fig). Although the vacuoles lacked mRFP+ debris in macrophages, every
microglial cell with vacuoles contained mRFP+ debris. If microglia are the primary debris-
clearing cells in OBPI, we hypothesized that they would clear debris longer at the injury side
than macrophages. To test this, we tracked the distinct pu1+ cell populations in time-lapse
movies and scored microglia spend on average 9.14 hours at the injury site compared to mac-
rophages, which spend 5.97 hours (S6C and S6D Fig), a result that is consistent with the
hypothesis that microglia could function as the primary debris-clearing cells following obstet-
rical avulsion.
Microglia exit the CNS during spinal root avulsion
To determine the role of phagocytic cells in clearance of these domains, we tracked both cells
in uninjured cases and following injury in lateral views in which we could distinguish the loca-
tion of the spinal cord and the PNS (Fig 2A and 2B, S7A and S7B Fig). In these movies, we
visualized GFP+ cells that originated in the CNS, migrate to the injury site, squeeze at the spi-
nal cord boundary, and potentially migrate outside of its CNS domain (S7C and S7D Fig, S3
Movie). This hourglass-like morphology is typical of cells that must squeeze through a space-
restricted area to leave the spinal cord [17,33]. We confirmed the ectopic migration of these
cells by rotating our z-stack 90˚ in the movies; the distance of this migration also extended

 laterally beyond the normal range of the gfap+ spinal cord glial limitans (Fig 2A and 2B, S7E
Fig). We measured these cells extended on average 14.7 μm beyond the glial limitans bound-
ary; in comparision, the DRG was measured on average 4.8 μm outside the glial limitans (S7F
Fig). We also visualized microglia in contact with the PNS-located DRG resident cells, sup-
porting the hypothesis that microglia clearly exited the CNS (S7G–S7H Fig). We quantified
this behavior in our 24-hour movies after injury and microglia were detected laterally outside
of the mRFP region in 40% of the movies, they displayed an hourglass-like morphology, and in
3D reconstructions were located outside the normal region of the curvature of the glial limit-
ans (Fig 2C, S7E Fig). In these emigration events, typically one to two microglia exited (S7I
Fig). This is in contrast to noninjured spinal cords in which microglia never were present in
these regions. On average, microglia emigrated 12.87 μm outside of the sox10+ CNS region fol-
lowing spinal root avulsion, remained there on average 4.13 hours, and displayed microglia-
like morphology while positioned there (S7J and S7K Fig). In these emigration events, a con-
tinuous GFP+ process that remained in the CNS could not be detected, suggesting that the
entirety of the microglia cell left the CNS. After emigration, individual microglia did return to
the CNS (Fig 2B and 2E).
It is possible that this microglia emigration occurs from a massive disruption of the spinal
cord boundary. However, despite disruption of the glial limitans in category III injury cases,
microglia emigration was still observed in category I and II injury types with limited glial limit-
ans disruption (S7L Fig). Also inconsistent with this idea, microglia emigration was preceeded
by a squeezing of the microglia, suggesting it migrates through a space-restricted area (S7C
and S7D Fig). If a general boundary disruption was present, oligodendrocytes and neurons
would potentially ectopically exit as they do when boundary cap cells and/or Schwann cells are
disrupted [15–18]. However, we also did not detect emigration of oligodendrocytes (S7L Fig).
We next asked whether emigration was specific to root injuries by injuring the mixed PNS
nerve (analogous to the sciatic nerve) and did not detect emigration (S8A–S8C Fig). Instead,
and as previously reported, macrophages were the responding cell at mixed nerves [34](S8D
and S8E Fig). Microglia also did not emigrate when we created a CNS-specific injury (S8C and
S8E Fig). To rule out the possibility that this was specific to developmental properties at 4 dpf,
we also observed microglia emigration to avulsions at 7 dpf (Fig 2D). Based on these data, we
propose that microglia can exit the spinal cord, at least to the PNS-located spinal root and
DRG, following OBPI-like injuries. Such an observation is in contrast to current textbook defi-
nitions of microglia.
Emigrated microglia phagocytize PNS debris and re-enter the CNS
To gain further insight into this emigration, we tracked the trajectory of individual microglia
after injury. Not only did microglia exit following injury, but this tracing analysis showed that
individual microglia traverse the spinal cord boundary an average 6.25 times throughout their
response to injury (Fig 2E, S9A–S9I Fig). We next considered the hypothesis that, although

 microglia ectopically migrated, their phagocytic properties could be different between their
resident domain and the ectopically located PNS domain. To test this, we took advantage of
our imaging approach and tracked individual microglia after injury, then scored and tracked
the individual debris concentrates within those microglia. In these movies, we could identify
pu1+ cells that originated in the CNS contain mRFP+ debris (Fig 2F, S9J–S9M Fig). To test
whether debris could be carried across the CNS boundary, we scored the appearance of indi-
vidual mRFP+ clusters in the GFP+ cells in the CNS. During their emigration to the spinal
root, on average two mRFP+ particles from the CNS were carried within the microglia to the
PNS. And while in the PNS, an additional one mRFP+ debris appeared in the cell (Fig 2F, S9N
Fig). This appearance of mRFP+ debris particles while in the PNS is unlikely from already pres-
ent CNS debris particle fission because the area of individual particles increases from 2.05 μm2
to 2.83 μm2 while the microglia cell is migrating (S9O Fig). As the cells entered back into the
CNS, mRFP+ debris particles that appeared while the cell was in the PNS continued to be pres-
ent (Fig 2F). These data are consistent with the possibility that pu1+ microglia not only migrate
to the PNS-located roots but also clear debris while there. Additionally, their entry back into
the CNS with PNS debris introduces the CNS to PNS debris.
Given this movement of microglia, we next sought to determine where microglia and mac-
rophages eventually reside following their injury response. To do this, we identified CNS ver-
sus PNS pu1+ cells before injury, created injuries, imaged those injury sites for 24 hours, and
tracked the individual cells with tracking software. In this analysis of the microglia that exited
to the PNS, 44.44% of them migrated back to the CNS, where they continued to reside until
the end of the 24-hour imaging window (Fig 2G). This phenomonon is distinct from other
CNS cells that have been shown to emigrate because microglia also re-enter [15,17]. In the
other 55.56%, microglia continued to be present in the PNS at the injury site at the end of the
24-hour imaging window (Fig 2G). These PNS-located microglia did not leave the injury site
during this time. Macrophages migrated into and out of the injury site, sometimes entering
the CNS. However, at the end of the imaging window, macrophages were rarely seen in the
CNS. The simplest explanation for this data is that microglia can leave the CNS to respond to
avulsions and can return to CNS residency after clearing debris.
To dissect the consequence of this emigration, we tracked individual microglia that emi-
grated and then returned to the CNS. During this process, we measured numerous cellular
properties that were previously described across species to indicate altered microglia [9]. We
first tested whether the morphology of single microglia changed as they progressed through
their emigration and re-entry (Fig 2H, S10A–S10D Fig). To determine morphological changes,
we measured four shape descriptors. Microglia showed a signficant shift in aspect ratio (an
average measure of 8.57) and cell roundness (an average measure of 0.21) as cells were leaving
the CNS (Fig 2I and 2J, S10B and S10C Fig). These differences remained while the cell
returned to the CNS. To address whether this was a result of their location at the injury as
apposed to emigration, we compared emigrating microglia to microglia that responded to and
actively cleared debris at the injury site but never exited the CNS (S10E–S10H Fig). Again, this
analysis showed that aspect ratio and roundness were different from cells that emigrated com-
pared to nonexiting microglia. We could not detect any differences in the cells before emigra-
tion (Fig 2H–2J, S10I and S10J Fig), inconsistent with the hypothesis that emigrating microglia
are distinct, at least morphologically, before emigration.
PNS-experienced microglia return in an altered state
To further dissect whether microglia are altered, we tested whether emigrated microglia were
physiologically changed by scoring their phagocytic activity. Using movies, we could score the

 number of new debris particles within individual microglia. We scored that individual micro-
glia before their emigration increase the number of new mRFP+ particles once they return to
the CNS (Fig 2K, S10K Fig). As a third indicator of altered microglia, we also scored the num-
ber of secondary projections that are used in the phagocytic process [9,23] (S10L Fig). Consis-
tent with the conclusion that emigrated microglia return in an altered state, they increase their
secondary projections while in the PNS and remain elevated as they re-enter (S10L Fig). Emi-
grated microglia also were distinct from microglia that responded to injuries of CNS tissue
only (S10M Fig). Together, these data are consistent with the idea that emigration itself could
induce a unique microglial state.
Because CNS-resident pu1+ cells migrated out of the spinal cord but then returned to the
CNS, we next asked whether those ectopically migrated and altered cells moved to distal areas
of the CNS following their emigration. To do this, we created injuries in animals, tiled the ani-
mal from the brain to tail with confocal positions, and time-lapse imaged each of these posi-
tions for 24 hours. With this whole spinal cord analysis, we could visualize CNS-derived pu1+
cells migrate to the injury, squeeze into the PNS, relocate to the CNS through the spinal cord,
and then migrate anteriorly toward the brain and then caudally to the tail, surveying
743.56 μm (56.61%) of the spinal cord on average (Fig 2L, S11A–S11E Fig, S4 Movie). These
movies demonstrated PNS-primed microglia that carried debris from the injuries to the brain
(S11A Fig). This tiling analysis also allowed us to see interactions between individual cells
along the length of the animal. We commonly visualized emigrated microglia interacting with
other CNS-resident microglia in the spinal cord (S11F–S11H Fig, S4 Movie). Based on these
data, we conclude that not only can microglia migrate out of the CNS but they can re-enter the
CNS as PNS-primed cells and migrate, in an altered state, to distal areas from the injury site.
These migration sites include the brain.
PNS-primed microglia display altered responses to secondary injuries
To begin to understand the potential functional consequence of microglia emigration, we cre-
ated a primary avulsion injury in Tg(pu1:gfp);Tg(sox10:mrfp) animals at 4 dpf and observed
emigration of microglia to the PNS. Then we created a distal secondary CNS-specific injury.
Upon secondary injuries, we observed PNS-primed microglia immediately re-enter the CNS
and migrate to the secondary injury site (S12A Fig). We quantified the amount of new debris
PNS-primed microglia collected at the secondary injury site, which was greater than the
amount of new debris naïve CNS microglia collected at the secondary injury site (Fig 3A).
Naïve microglia were defined as never contacting the initial primary injury site. Additionally,
PNS-primed microglia created more secondary projections at the secondary injury and spent
more time there (S12B–S12D Fig). Together, these data demonstrate that PNS-primed micro-
glia are more phagocytically active when they return to the CNS and could present an altered
response to other injuries that occur after the avulsion.
Inhibition of NMDA receptors prevents microglia emigration
To dissect the molecular mechanism of this emigration, we screened through small molecules
that could disrupt emigration. In this, we identified that NMDA inhibitors, MK-801 and
D-AP5 [30], disrupted the emigration of the microglia to the PNS (Fig 3B, S13A Fig). To dis-
sect this mechanism further, we tracked individual microglia following injury in DMSO and
NMDA inhibitor exposure. We first hypothesized that lack of NMDA signaling disrupted the
response of the microglia to spinal sensory roots. However, by tracking individual pu1+ cells
after NMDA inhibition, microglia and macrophages still responded to the injury, ruling out
the possibility that blocking NMDA receptors prevented an initial injury response (S13B and

 S13C Fig). Instead, microglia responded to injury but did not emigrate (Fig 3B). This lack of
emigration when NMDA signaling is disrupted perturbed the alteration of microglia at the
injury that occurs as they emigrate (S14 Fig). Together, these data are consistent with the
hypothesis that microglia exit of the CNS following injury is dependent on NMDA.
Glutamate activation induces microglia emigration
To test this mechanism further, we asked whether glutamate, an activator of NMDA, could
induce microglia emigration. We did this by soaking animals in caged glutamate [35], created
brachial plexus injury (BPI)-like injuries, waited for a pu1+ cellular response to the injury,
uncaged a 4 μm region in the PNS by exposing it to 405 nm laser, and then imaged for 2 hours
after uncaging (Fig 3C and 3D, S5 Movie). As a control, soaking of caged glutamate did not
alter the initial response time to the injury (Fig 3C). However, on average, the uncaging of glu-
tamate induced exit of microglia to the PNS in 30 minutes. This was significnalty faster than
controls: untreated injuries showed average exit in 7.29 hours and caged-glutamate soaked ani-
mals that were exposed to a 4 μm region in the PNS of 641 nm light did not exit before 2 hours
(Fig 3E, S15A Fig). Uncaging glutamate induced emigration in the first 2 hours in 80% of inju-
ries compared to 0% in mock-activated controls (S15A Fig). Microglia in both cases traveled
the same distance, ruling out the possibility that these significant response times were caused
from varying travel distances (S15B and S15C Fig). Consistent with their emigration, uncaging
glutamate also caused morphological changes that occur in emigration states (S14 Fig, S15D–
S15F Fig). To ask whether glutamate was sufficient without injury to induce emigration, gluta-
mate was uncaged in the absence of injury (S15G and S15H Fig). Consistent with NMDA sig-
naling inhibitors not reducing the initial injury response but specifically emigration, glutamate
was not sufficient to induce emigration without injury. These data are consistent with the
hypothesis that the mechanism of microglia emigration is NMDA- and glutamate-dependent.

 Interactions between microglia and macrophages control microglial
emigration
We hypothesized that a balance between NMDA induction and an emigration restriction
mechanism determined emigration efficiency. Domain-specific cells can be restrictive to cells
outside and inside of their domain [16,17,25,36–38]. Given that both macrophages and micro-
glia responded to injury, we hypothesized that the presence of specific cells at the injury site,
like macrophages, could prevent microglia from performing their full debris-clearing poten-
tial. We tested this mechanism in our imaging set-up by initially scoring interactions between
the distinct pu1+ cells (S6 Movie). We first quantified the number of times each cell type dis-
played homotypic versus heterotypic contact (Fig 4A and 4B, S16A–S16C Fig). Then, we asked
whether those interactions induced directional changes. In this analysis, we identified that
homotypic interactions between microglia induced migration of microglia 83.33% of the time

 and heterotypic interactions between microglia and macrophages induced migration of micro-
glia away from the contacting cell 88.88% of the time (Fig 4C, S6, S7 and S8 Movies). Macro-
phages did not respond to either homotypic or heterotypic contact (Fig 4A and 4C, S16B–
S16D Fig, S9 Movie). We could quantify this by measuring distance traveled over time and
measured that microglia travel on average 157.25 μm after contact whereas macrophages travel
9.20 μm after contact (S16D Fig). We next hypothesized that these heterotypic and homotypic
interactions could impact the ability of microglia to emigrate.
To first test this possibility, we visualized microglial migration in the absence of macro-
phages. To do this, we tailored the laser parameters to produce spinal root avulsions with lim-
ited peripheral injury. In these injuries, microglia responded, but macrophages did not (S17A
Fig, S10 Movie). We then traced the behavior of individual microglia. In contrast to injuries
with macrophage responses, microglia migrated to the PNS quicker to these injuries, remained
in the PNS, and extended long cellular processes into the PNS that were not visualized when
macrophages were present (Fig 4D, S17 Fig). These data are consistent with the cellular mecha-
nism that macrophages inhibit microglia emigration. We tested this potential mechanism with
a second approach by reducing macrophages with focal laser ablations. In these experiments,
we created avulsions, then after pu1+ cells migrated to the injury, we laser ablated single mac-
rophages in close proximity to microglia at the injury site (Fig 4E, S18A and S18B Fig, S11
Movie). Following these single macrophage ablations, microglia migrated into the empty space
that was created from macrophage ablations within seconds (Fig 4F and 4G, S18C–S18E Fig).
Although we cannot completely rule out that macrophage debris attracts microglia, as a con-
trol identical laser ablation exposure to adjacent nonmacrophage space did not provoke migra-
tion into that area. This is consistent with the idea that ablation does not itself—or debris it
creates—induce this microglial response (Fig 4G, S19 Fig). The simplest explanation for this is
that dynamic interactions between microglia and macrophages deter microglia from occupy-
ing the PNS-located injury site.
To test whether this cell–cell contact mechanism has functional implications on debris
clearance, we again took advantage of the simplicity of the zebrafish system; during early devel-
opmental stages, macrophages are abundant, but microglia are limited in number in the spinal
cord and approximately 5% of animals display no CNS pu1+ cells in the spinal cord at 4 dpf. In
these rare microglia-less spinal cords, we injured the spinal root and scored the percentage of
injuries containing the mRFP+ debris that concentrated into puncta by phagocytic cells (Fig
4H, S20 Fig). As mentioned above, mRFP+ particles appear as the microglia migrate to the
injury (Fig 1F–1H, S6 Fig). In contrast to injuries in animals with microglia, mRFP+ debris
puncta was not detected in injuries without microglia, suggesting that microglia are required
for debris clearance (Fig 4I). In contrast, for injuries with no macrophages, debris clustered
quicker at the injury site (Fig 4F–4G). And consistent with the role of microglia, this debris
was present only within microglia. These results are consistent with the cellular mechanism
that microglia are responsible for debris clearance following injury but their access is inhibited
to the injury site by macrophages. This stymies their ability to arrive and efficiently clear debris
in both the CNS and PNS following spinal root avulsion.
Discussion
Here, we demonstrate that microglia, despite their textbook definition, can alter their domain-
specific residency. In this model of OBPI, the emigrating microglia serve as the debris-clearing
cell (S21 Fig). Their potential, however, is stymied by macrophages. Macrophages restrict
access to the area via a contact-dependent mechanism; a principle that appears to be consis-
tently utilized across neural cell type, yet still remains largely molecularly elusive [17,25,36,39–

 43]. Emigration is balanced by two distinct mechanisms—positive migration via NMDA
dependence and negative via contact-dependent cellular restriction. Together, our results
introduce the concept that microglia migration out of the CNS is not only possible in OBPI,
but while there, they can clear PNS debris and return it to the CNS in an altered state—a con-
sequence that could have longer-term implications in the health of the nervous system [13].
Microglia activation during embryonic development has been implicated in autism-like
phenotypes [13,44]. This activation can be induced by pollutants that the pregnant mother
is exposed to [13]. These results suggest that improper activation of microglia during early
embryonic stages could have long-term consequences on neural circuits. Our results indi-
cate that emigration of microglia to the PNS roots can induce similar morphological and
phagocytic activity changes that occur in activated microglia [9]. In our injury paradigm,
these microglia then re-enter the CNS and can migrate over 60% of the spinal cord; their
migration capacity even extends into the brain despite the severity of the injury and the
integrity of the glial limitans. PNS-primed microglia that re-enter the CNS can migrate to
distal sites of CNS-specific secondary injury and are more phagocytically active in response
to secondary injuries. Microglia have been implicated in neuropathic pain following PNS
injury [14,45]. This neuropathic pain can be halted if microglia are depleted within the first
days after the injury [14], indicating that the initial response and changes of microglia is
imperative. In light of these studies, emigration could be essential in numerous postinjury
pathologies.
In specific disease states, subsets of microglia are activated. These microglia are referred to
as disease-associated microglia (DAMs). DAMs transition through a series of stages that
include regulation of specific transcription components, changes in physical appearance, and
alterations in phagocytic activity [46]. The emigrated microglia return to the CNS with altered
morphology and increased phagocytosis. These results indicate that emigrated microglia may
resemble DAMs. Although ideal, monitoring transcriptional changes that would confirm these
similarities is difficult to perform in emigrated microglia, because first the cells must be identi-
fied in movies as emigrated and then single-cell transcriptional analysis would need to be per-
formed. With the number of microglia that emigrate at 4 dpf per injury, such analysis is
technically infeasable. Future studies that resolve these technical hurdles will be important.
Such analysis will also reveal the distinct differences between microglia and macrophages at
the injury site, such as, e.g., their Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAMs), which are a family of receptor
tyrosine kinases [47].
Microglia and macrophages largely occupy distinct domains. However, during disease
states like spinal cord injury, multiple scleroris, and metastatic cancer, these distinct cells can
reside in the same domains [48–50]. Our time-lapse imaging data indicate that microglia are
restricted to regions that macrophages occupy. The consequence of this in BPI-like injuries is
that microglia cannot clear debris as quickly. It also may ensure abundant microglia are not
free to migrate to the PNS where they can become altered to an emigration state. If microglia
are resctricted by macrophages in other diseases states like those in this BPI model, it may per-
turb the normal survelliance functions of microglia. Recent reports demonstrate that macro-
phages can inhibit microglia in spinal injuries [20], providing complimentary data that the
interaction of macrophages and microglia, which we visualize in our movies occur after con-
tact, could have profound effects on pathological states. This could also have downstream con-
sequences to nervous system circuits.
Together, our results indicate that microglia function could extend beyond their textbook-
defined region. This adds to their already impressive and essential roles in nervous system
homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.

Method details
In vivo imaging.
Animals were anesthetized with 3-amino-benzoic acid ester (Tricaine),
covered in 0.8% low-melting point agarose, and mounted on their right side in glass-bottomed
35 mm Petri dishes [25]. Images were acquired on a spinning disk confocal microscope cus-
tom build by 3i technology that contains Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 Advanced Mariana Micro-
scope; X-cite 120LED White Light LED System; filter cubes for GFP and mRFP; a motorized
X,Y stage; a piezo Z stage; 20× Air (0.50 NA), 63× (1.15 NA), 40× (1.1 NA) objectives;

Laser-induced spinal avulsion.
Tg(sox10:mrfp);Tg(pu1:gfp) 4-dpf animals were anesthe-
tized using 0.02% 3-aminobenzoic acid ester (Tricaine) in egg water. Fish were then mounted
in 0.8% low-melting point agarose solution, arranged laterally on a 10 mm glass coverslip-bot-
tom Petri dish, and placed on the microscope anterior to posterior. Avulsion region of interest
was mid-animal and selected upon location of DRG outside the spinal cord. Specific site of
laser-induced injury was determined by tracing afferent projections from the DRG into the
spinal cord using the z-plane. Projections with greater fluorescence and successful tracing
were selected as the site of injury. This area was marked and brought into a focused ablation
window. Upon focusing the targeted afferent projection, we moved 1 μm laterally out of the z-
plane and double-clicked on the projection using a 4 μm cursor tool. All laser parameters used
are specific to our confocal microscope. Specific parameters include Laser Power (2), Raster
Block Size (1), Double-Click Rectangle Size (8), and Double-Click Repetitions (4).
Avulsion injury categorization.
A catalog of all injuries performed was created and ana-
lyzed to create three separate categories of injury. Category I injuries are less severe, involving
cutting the central projection and little to no surrounding damage. Category II injuries are

 more severe than involved severance of the central projection and some surrounding damage.
Category III injuries are the most severe, involving severance of the central projection, visible
damage to the spinal cord, and free-roaming debris. ImageJ was used to measure the length
and width of the injury site created. ImageJ was also used to measure the average fluorescence
of the injury site before and after the avulsion. These measurements were used to create a
range of length, width, and fluorescence to place each avulsion case into a category. These
ranges are listed in S2 Table. An avulsion case must meet at least two of the three catalog fac-
tors to qualify for a specific injury category.
Immunohistochemistry. The primary antibodies used in the assessment of boundary dis-
ruption were anti-Sox10 [54] (1:5,000, rabbit, Kucenas Lab) and anti-GFAP [52] (1:600,
mouse, Dako). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 647 goat antimouse (1:600,
Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 560 goat antirabbit (1:600; Invitrogen). The primary antibody
used in the confirmation of microglia in the brain and spinal cord compared to macrophages
was anti-4C4 (1:50, mouse, Seiger, Becker, and Becker Labs) [27]. The secondary antibody
used was Alexa Fluor 647 goat antimouse (1:600, Invitrogen). Larvae were fixed using 4% PFA
in PBST (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100) at 25˚C for 3 hours. Fixed larvae were washed with PBST,
DWT (dH20, 0.1% Triton X-100), and acetone for 5 minutes each, then were incubated in
−30˚C acetone for 10 minutes. Larvae were then washed three times with PBST for 5 minutes
and incubated with 5% goat serum in PBST for 1 hour at 25˚C. Then, the larvae were incu-
bated with primary antibody solution for 1 hour at 25˚C, then transferred to −4˚C overnight.
After three washes with PBST for 30 minutes each and a longer PBST wash for 1 hour, the lar-
vae were incubated with secondary antibody solution for 1 hour at 25˚C, then transferred to
−4˚C overnight. After three washes with PBST for 1 hour, larvae were stored in 50% glycerol
in PBS at 4˚C until imaging. Larvae were mounted, and confocal images were taken using the
above protocol for in vivo imaging.
smFISH.
The probe used in the confirmation of microglia in the spinal cord was
tmem119 (500 μL, Stellaris FISH). Larvae were fixed at 4 dpf using 1 mL fresh fix solution (10×
PBS, dH20, 4% methanol-free formaldehyde) for 30 minutes. Fixed larvae were then washed
twice in 100% methanol for two minutes each and incubated in 100% methanol at (-25˚C)
overnight. After one wash of 50% methanol, 30% methanol, and 100% 1× PBS for 5 minutes
each, the larvae were decapitated using a razor blade. The caudal portion of the animal was
then permeabilized with 10 mg/mL proteinase K for 45 minutes at 25˚C. Decapitated larvae
were then washed twice in 1× PBST (PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) and incubated with 4% PFA at
25˚C for 20 minutes. Fixed larvae were washed twice in 1× PBST for 5 minutes each. After 3
washes with 1× PBST for 10 minutes each, fixed larvae were incubated with 50% Stellaris
Wash Buffer (20× SSC, deionized formamide, and nuclease-free H2O) in 1× PBST for 5 min-
utes. After two 30-minute washes in 100% Stellaris Wash Buffer at 37˚C, fixed larvae were
incubated in 1.2 μL probe mixture and 500 μL Stellaris Hyb Buffer (dextran sulfate, 20× SSC,
deionized formamide, nuclease-free water) at 37˚C overnight. After two washes with 37˚C
Stellaris Wash Buffer for 3 minutes each, larvae were washed 4 times for 15 minutes each in
37˚C Stellaris Wash Buffer. Fixed larvae were washed an additional 3 times with 1X PBST at
25˚C for 10 minutes each. Then, larvae were immediately mounted, and confocal images were
taken using the above protocol for in vivo imaging.
CSF-1 inhibitors.
The chemical reagents used for this study were GW2580 (ApexBio).
Stock solutions of 1 μM, 10 μM, and 100 μM were stored at −20˚C with concentrations of 1%
in DMSO. All embryos were dechorionated at 24 hpf and incubated with 3 mL egg water until
desired treatment time. Fish were treated at 3 dpf and 24 hours and 12 hours before imaging at
4 dpf. Control fish were incubated with 1% DMSO in egg water 24 hours and 12 hours before
imaging.

 Peripheral injury. Tg(sox10:mrfp);Tg(pu1:gfp) 4 dpf animals were anesthetized using

CNS-specific injuries.
Tg(sox10:mrfp);Tg(pu1:gfp) 4 dpf animals were anesthetized using

Petri dish, and placed on the microscope anterior to posterior. Avulsion region of interest was
midanimal and selected upon location of DRG outside the spinal cord. Specific site of laser-
induced injury was determined by selecting a region inside the CNS where several oligoden-
droctyes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and sox10+ axons were present between two DRGs
using the z-plane. This area was marked and brought into a focused ablation window. Upon
focusing the targeted deep CNS region, we moved 1 μm laterally out of the z-plane and dou-

interest was selected, and an initial primary avulsion was created following the procedure as
previously described in the laser-induced spinal avulsion section, using all the same laser
parameters. We observed microglia responding to injury by checking the time lapse of the
injury site every 15 minutes. After a microglia emigration event occurred, we immediately
moved to a new posterior imaging region that did not overlap with the primary injury site.
Then, we created a secondary injury in the CNS caudal to the primary injury site following the
laser-avulsion procedure previously described in the CNS-specific injury section using the
same laser parameters. We observed PNS-primed microglia response to secondary injury by
imaging both the primary and secondary injury sites every 5 minutes for 24 hours.
NMDA inhibitors.
The chemical reagents used for this study were MK-801 and D-AP5
(Tocris). Stock solutions of 25 mM MK-801 and 50 mM D-AP5 were stored at −20˚C with
concentrations of 1% DMSO [30]. Working solutions were diluted to 50 μM for MK-801 treat-
ments and 30 μM for D-AP5 treatments. All embryos were dechorionated at 24 hpf and incu-
bated with 3 mL egg water until desired treatment time. Fish were treated at 4 dpf, 2 hours
before imaging. Control fish were incubated with 1% DMSO in egg water 2 hours before
imaging.
NMDA injury. Tg(sox10:mrfp);Tg(pu1:gfp) 4 dpf MK-801 and D-AP5 treated animals
were anesthetized using 0.02% 3-aminobenzoic acid ester (Tricaine) in egg water. Fish were
then mounted in 0.8% low-melting point agarose solution, arranged laterally on a 10 mm
glass-coverslip–bottom Petri dish, and placed on the microscope anterior to posterior. Micro-
glia were identified in the spinal cord by taking confocal z-stack images and rotating each

 image 90 degrees to verify the cell was inside the CNS. An avulsion of the region of interest
was performed following the spinal root avulsion protocol above to elicit microglial response
to the injury site. Migration of microglia to the injury post-avulsion was imaged every 5 min-
utes for 24 hours.
Glutamate treatment.
The chemical reagents used for this study were MNI-caged-L-glu-
tamate (Tocris). Stock solutions of 50 mM were stored at −20˚C with concentrations of 1%
DMSO. Working solutions were diluted to 10 μM. All embryos were dechorionated at 24 hpf
and incubated with 3 mL egg water until desired treatment time [35]. Fish were treated at 4
dpf with 10 μM caged glutamate 1 hour before imaging. Control fish were incubated with 1%
DMSO in egg water 1 hour before imaging.
Glutamate uncaging.
Tg(sox10:mrfp);Tg(pu1:gfp) 4 dpf glutamate-treated animals were
anesthetized using 0.02% 3-aminobenzoic acid ester (Tricaine) in egg water. Fish were then
mounted in 0.8% low-melting point agarose solution, arranged laterally on a 10 mm glass-cov-
erslip–bottom Petri dish, and placed on the microscope anterior to posterior. Microglia were
identified in the spinal cord by taking confocal z-stack images and rotating each image 90
degrees to verify the cell was inside the CNS. An avulsion of the region of interest was per-
formed following the spinal root avulsion protocol above to elicit microglial response to the
injury site. Migration of microglia to the injury post-avulsion was imaged and directly moni-
tored every 5 minutes by placing markers on the screen during the imaging cycle to track
movement. Upon arrival to the injury site, the imaging cycle was stopped to begin the uncag-
ing process. Glutamate uncaging was carried out using UV light on the fluorescent region of
the confocal. The specific site of UV exposure was in the same area as the intial avulsion. The
region of interest was exposed to the laser line 405 nm for 5 ms to uncage glutamate. Immedi-
ately following UV exposure, a time lapse was initiatied to take an image every 2 minutes for
the desired imaging window. UV exposure used a 4 μm cursor tool. All laser parameters used
are specific to our confocal microscope.
Glutamate uncaging controls (mock injury) were performed using anesthetized Tg(sox10:
mrfp);Tg(pu1:gfp) 4 dpf animals treated with 10 μM L-glutamate 1 hour pre-avulsion. An avul-
sion was created in a specific region of interest, and microglial migration was monitored as
described above. Upon arrival to the injury site, the imaging cycle was stopped, and “mock”
uncaging was performed. Instead of using the 405 nm laser to uncage glutamate, the desired
region of interest was exposed to the laser line 561 nm for 5 ms. Following exposure to v561, a
time lapse was initiated to take an image every 2 minutes for the desired imaging window.
Single-cell ablations.
Tg(sox10:mrfp);Tg(pu1:gfp) 4 dpf animals were anesthetized using
0.02% 3-aminobenzoic acid ester (Tricaine) in egg water. Fish were then mounted in 0.8%
low-melting point agarose solution, arranged laterally on a 10 mm glass-coverslip–bottom
Petri dish, and placed on the microscope anterior to posterior. Confocal z-stack images of Tg
(sox10:mrfp);Tg(pu1:gfp) 4 dpf animals were taken preinjury. Injuries were then created fol-
lowing the laser-induced injury methods described above to induce both macrophages and
microglia to the injury site. Time-lapse images of pu1+ cellular response to injury was moni-
tored every minute for 2 hours. We checked for the presence of pu1+ cells at site of injury
every 5 minutes. After 30 to 60 minutes, pu1+ cells arrived to the injury site, and the time lapse
was stopped. Macrophages and microglia were confirmed by preimage z-stacks and post–spi-
nal-injury time lapse movies and tracing cells back to their original domains. A confirmed
macrophage was chosen and brought into a focused ablation window. Upon focusing the tar-
geted cell, we double-clicked on the center of the cell body using a 4 μm cursor tool to fire the
ablation laser. All laser parameters used are specific to our confocal microscope. Specific
parameters include Laser Power (2), Raster Block Size (4), Double-Click Rectangle Size (8),
and Double-Click Repetitions (4).

 Quantification and statistical analysis
To generate composite z-images for the cell, 3i Slidebook software (Denver, CO) was used.
Individual z-images were sequentially observed to confirm composite accuracy. All graphically
presented data represent the mean of the analyzed data unless otherwise noted. Cell tracking
was performed using the MTrackJ plugin for ImageJ (https://imagescience.org/meijering/
software/mtrackj/, Bethesda, MD). GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA) was used to
determine statistical analysis. Full detail of the statistical values can be found in S1 Table.
Quantification of emigration.
To track the ectopic migration of microglia, single cells
were tracked using the MTrackJ plugin of ImageJ. pu1+ cells were imaged for 2 hours premi-
gration to ensure the normal domain residency. After injury, cells were tracked from inside
the spinal cord to the injury site. Three specific criteria were used to score the ectopic migra-
tion: (1) Cells migrated dorsolateral outside of the sox10:mrfp+ range in the spinal cord specifi-
cally at the injury site. (2) Cells displayed an hourglass-like morphology that is typical of cells
that ectopically migrate from the spinal cord. (3) In visualization of 3D reconstruction of the
injury site, the pu1+ cells appeared outside of the sox10+ boundary and curvature of the glial
limitans. All migrations that did not definetly meet these criteria were conservatively scored as
nonectopic migration. To confirm the ectopic exit, we combined transgenes to label the edge
of the spinal cord. As a limit of transgenes and the transient nature of this exiting phenome-
non, we combined analysis of Tg(sox10:mrfp); Tg(gfap:gfp) and Tg(sox10:mrfp); Tg(pu1:gfp).
We rotated these images 90 degrees to reveal a cross-section of the spinal cord. We then
merged the two Tg(sox10:mrfp) channels to align the spinal cord, then merged the two merged
images of Tg(sox10:mrfp); Tg(gfap:gfp) versus Tg(sox10:mrfp); Tg(pu1:gfp) to confirm the pu1+
cells that originated from the CNS were clearly outside the normal gfap+ spinal cord glial
limitans.
Shape descriptors.
The four shape descriptors used to analyze microglia morphology (cir-
cularity, aspect ratio, roundness, and solidity) were measured using ImageJ. ImageJ utilizes the
following formulas to calculate each descriptor:
Circularity ¼ 4p � area
ðperimeterÞ
2
Aspect Ratio ¼ major axis
minor axis
Roundness ¼
4 � area
p � ðmajor axisÞ
2
Solidity ¼
area
convex area
Quantification of sox10+ debris puncta.
To track the presence of debris within microglia,
single cells were tracked using the MTrackJ plugin of ImageJ. pu1+ cells imaged throughout
the duration of time lapse imaging were analyzed before and after their arrival to laser-induced
avulstion sites. The criteria for debris include that sox10:mrfp+ puncta were free roaming and
were picked up by a pu1+ cell in the spinal cord or that sox10:mrfp+ puncta were already pres-
ent inside a pu1+ cell and migrated with the direction of the pu1+ cell. Colocalization was con-
firmed by rotating the confocal images at varying time points 90 degrees. If the puncta were

 inside the pu1+ cells, they were considered debris. The area of the puncta were measured using
ImageJ.
Quantification of migration.
To track the individual paths of macrophage and microglia
migration, the MTrackJ plugin on ImageJ was used. The center of each cell body was traced
over time, and quantitative data were collected by ImageJ. Resulting x and y coordinates of
each cell were overlayed to create migration plots. All distance and time points were calculated
by the MTrackJ software and further quantified using Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA).
Quantification of directional changes.
The MTrackJ plugin on ImageJ was used for trac-
ing. Initial direction change paths were traced by tracking the location of the center of the cell
body. Contact-related directional changes were traced by tracking each cell projection that
came into contact with another cell projection. All numerical data were collected by the
MTrackJ plugin, and the resulting x and y coordinates of each cell track were used to perform
all quantitative analyses.
