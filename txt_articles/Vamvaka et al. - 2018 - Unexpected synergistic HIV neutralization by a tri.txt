The transmission of HIV can be prevented by the application of
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and lectins. Traditional recombi-
nant protein manufacturing platforms lack sufficient capacity and are
too expensive for developing countries, which suffer the greatest
disease burden. Plants offer an inexpensive and scalable alternative
manufacturing platform that can produce multiple components in a
single plant, which is important because multiple components are
required to avoid the rapid emergence of HIV-1 strains resistant to
single microbicides. Furthermore, crude extracts can be used directly
for prophylaxis to avoid the massive costs of downstream processing
and purification. We investigated whether rice could simultaneously
produce three functional HIV-neutralizing proteins (the monoclonal
antibody 2G12, and the lectins griffithsin and cyanovirin-N). Pre-
liminary in vitro tests showed that the cocktail of three proteins
bound to gp120 and achieved HIV-1 neutralization. Remarkably,
when we mixed the components with crude extracts of wild-type
rice endosperm, we observed enhanced binding to gp120 in vitro and
synergistic neutralization when all three components were present.
Extracts of transgenic plants expressing all three proteins also showed
enhanced in vitro binding to gp120 and synergistic HIV-1 neutraliza-
tion. Fractionation of the rice extracts suggested that the enhanced
gp120 binding was dependent on rice proteins, primarily the globulin
fraction. Therefore, the production of HIV-1 microbicides in rice may
not only reduce costs compared to traditional platforms but may also
provide functional benefits in terms of microbicidal potency.

H
IV-1 infection rates are declining, but there were still
2.1 million new cases in 2015 (1, 2). The virus continues to
spread because there are no effective vaccines, and preexposure
prophylaxis remains largely reliant on barrier methods or the
oral administration of tenofovir/emtricitabine (3–5). HIV-1 entry
into susceptible cells begins when the viral surface glycoprotein
gp120 engages CD4 on the surface of lymphocytes, followed by
its binding to coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4; then the trans-
membrane subunit gp41 mediates membrane fusion (6). Mole-
cules that bind to gp120/gp41 could therefore act as HIV entry
inhibitors and may be suitable as topical microbicides, repre-
senting a subset of preexposure prophylaxis strategies (7). Many
different entry inhibitors have been tested in vitro, in animal
studies, and in human clinical trials, including broadly neutral-
izing monoclonal antibodies, such as 2G12, and lectins, such as
griffithsin (GRFT) and cyanovirin-N (CV-N) (8–11). These show
low nanomolar to picomolar IC50 values against all tested HIV-
1 clades in vitro and in animal models (12–16).
The deployment of antibodies and lectins as HIV-1 entry in-
hibitors requires large-scale inexpensive production. Several
HIV-neutralizing antibodies (including 2G12) and lectins (in-
cluding GRFT and CV-N) have been produced as recombinant
proteins in mammalian cells (17, 18) and microbial systems (19–
25), respectively, but these are expensive because the products
must be extensively purified (26). Furthermore, an effective
microbicide requires three or more components targeting dif-
ferent epitopes to ensure broad coverage of HIV strains and to
prevent the emergence of “escape mutants” (27), adding even
further to the production costs. Plants could address these issues
by allowing the inexpensive production of multiple HIV-1 entry
inhibitors in the same tissue followed by the application of crude
extracts directly to avoid purification costs (28, 29). Cereal seeds
are likely to be the most suitable platform for the production of
microbicides in developing countries because the cultivation in-
frastructure is in place (30, 31), and cereal seeds have “generally
regarded as safe” (GRAS) status so the crude extracts would be
Significance
Our paper provides an approach for the durable deployment of
anti-HIV agents in the developing world. We developed a
transgenic rice line expressing three microbicidal proteins (the
HIV-neutralizing antibody 2G12 and the lectins griffithsin and
cyanovirin-N). Simultaneous expression in the same plant al-
lows the crude seed extract to be used directly as a topical
microbicide cocktail, avoiding the costs of multiple down-
stream processes. This groundbreaking strategy is realistically
the only way that microbicidal cocktails can be manufactured
at a cost low enough for the developing world, where HIV
prophylaxis is most in demand.

 considered safe for direct application (32). This minimal processing
concept has already been demonstrated for other proteins (33, 34),
and the economic viability of production processes has been con-
firmed, even when downstream processing is included (35, 36).
We have previously expressed 2G12, GRFT, and CV-N indi-
vidually in rice with maximum yields comparable to the same
components (and other HIV-neutralizing antibodies) produced
in other plants (37–45). Before attempting to express all three
components in the same line, we tested the activity of the com-
ponents reconstituted in wild-type rice endosperm extracts
compared with a control mixture reconstituted in PBS. We then
generated transgenic rice plants expressing all three components
to investigate the neutralization activity of the crude extracts
against different strains of HIV. We tested the simultaneous
expression of one antibody and two lectins because multiple
antibodies expressed in the same cell can assemble as non-
functional heterologous heavy/light chain combinations (46).
Results
In Vitro Analysis of Combinatorial gp120 Binding and HIV Neutralization.
Before generating transgenic plants expressing 2G12, GRFT,
and CV-N, the three pure recombinant proteins were prepared
as a dilution series in PBS, and ELISAs were carried out using
the individual components, all three pairwise combinations,
and the triple combination to determine whether there was
evidence of interdependent binding, mutual inhibition, or co-
operative binding. We used two different versions of gp120
to ensure that our results were not dependent on a specific
HIV strain.
When different concentrations of GRFT and CV-N were
combined in a matrix and gp120 binding was detected using ei-
ther an anti-GRFT or anti–CV-N polyclonal antiserum, there
was no evidence that either component influenced the ability of
the other to bind gp120, as shown by the clear concentration-
dependent binding of the primary lectin regardless of the

were present at the same concentrations in all assays. This was appropriate because competition experiments established that the components do not in-
terfere with each other’s ability to bind gp120 at any of the tested concentrations (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Data are presented as a fitted quadratic regression
model to compare the different curve parameters and establish significant differences between PBS and REX. No statistical differences were found for A and
B (P > 0.05). Asterisks represent statistically significant differences (ANOVA) at different concentrations of the three components (***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01,
*P < 0.05). Error bars indicate the SEM from three replicates.

 concentration of the competing lectin (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).
However, when we repeated the ELISAs by reconstituting the
components in extracts of wild-type rice endosperm rather than
PBS, we observed a small inhibitory effect on the binding of CV-N,
with slightly lower OD values in the presence of rice extract (Fig.
1A), but a remarkable increase in the binding activity of GRFT,
with the OD values doubling in the presence of the rice extract
(Fig. 1B). The pH of the extract was the same as that of PBS, so
we ruled out pH-dependent effects on electrostatic interactions.
The ELISA experiments suggested that GRFT binding to
gp120 was enhanced by the rice extract, but there was no en-
hancement of the interaction between CV-N and gp120. Addi-
tional ELISA experiments were carried out to test the binding of
2G12 alone or in the presence of different concentrations of
single lectins and both lectins. Again, we observed the expected
concentration-dependent binding of 2G12 in PBS, and the
presence of either individual lectin or both lectins had no effect
at any of the concentrations we tested, including both lectins at
increasing concentrations in concert or in opposing gradients (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1). As with GRFT, however, 2G12 binding ac-
tivity increased when PBS was replaced with the rice extract (Fig.
1C) in the presence of individual lectins (Fig. 1 D and E) and
both lectins (Fig. 1F). Overall, these experiments indicated that
components in the crude rice endosperm extract doubled the
gp120-binding activity of 2G12 and GRFT compared with the
same components at the same concentrations in PBS but had no
effect on CV-N.
We investigated the functional impact of the enhanced binding
promoted by rice extracts by conducting TZM-bl cell HIV-
neutralization assays. Recombinant GRFT, CV-N, and 2G12 were
tested against the laboratory-adapted NL4.3-pseudotyped virus. All
three components showed neutralizing activity when reconstituted
in PBS, with individual IC50 values of 0.29, 1.6, and 795 ng/mL,
respectively. The IC50 value of GRFT presented alone (0.29 ng/mL)
did not change significantly when copresented with CV-N (0.23 ng/mL),
2G12 (0.31 ng/mL), or both CV-N and 2G12 (0.22 ng/mL). How-
ever, when the three components were reconstituted in the endo-
sperm extract, we observed similar IC50 values for GRFT alone or
in a double combination with either of the other components, but
the IC50 value of GRFT in the triple combination fell by ∼50%,
suggesting that the rice endosperm extract promotes synergistic
activity among the three components to increase the potency of
GRFT (Table 1).
Transgenic Plants and Expression Analysis. Having established that
the interactions between 2G12, GRFT, and CV-N differ
according to whether they are reconstituted in PBS or rice en-
dosperm extract, we generated transgenic lines expressing all
three proteins to characterize the behavior of the components in
this context. Rice embryos were cotransformed with four con-
structs containing the coding sequences for the 2G12 heavy and
light chains, GRFT, and CV-N, each controlled by endosperm-
specific promoters (37, 40, 44). A fifth construct containing the
selectable marker hpt was controlled by the constitutive Cauli-
flower mosaic virus 35S promoter (47). Embryo-derived callus
was selected on hygromycin-supplemented medium, and 20 in-
dependent transformants were regenerated. Leaves and T1 seeds
from these plants were analyzed by PCR to confirm the presence
of the transgenes, and the T1 seed extracts were analyzed by
sandwich ELISA to confirm the presence of correctly assembled
2G12 and the two lectins.
Nineteen transgenic lines were fertile, eight of which
expressed a single microbicidal component (Table 2). Eight lines
expressed two components, with all three possible pairwise
combinations represented, and three further lines were re-
covered expressing all three components simultaneously. The
double- and triple-component transgenic lines were renamed
lines 1–11 for simplicity (Table 2). The analysis of individual and
combinatorial expression revealed no specific relationship be-
tween the presence of each transgene and their expression levels,
which made it possible to identify lines expressing any combi-
nation of the proteins at adequate levels for further analysis,
even among a small population. T1 seeds from the single, dou-
ble, and triple transgenic lines were propagated to produce
T1 populations, and T2 homozygous seeds were used for more
detailed analysis.
Crude Extracts from the T2 Transgenic Seeds Show gp120-Binding and
Synergistic HIV-1–Neutralization Activity in Vitro. Crude extracts
from the T2 seeds showed gp120 IIIB-binding activity in vitro by
ELISA. To ensure that the assay was calibrated correctly and
that the three proteins were correctly folded and able to bind
their target in the context of rice endosperm extracts, we com-
pared recombinant proteins with extracts from the transgenic
lines expressing the individual components and extracts from the
11 double and triple transgenic lines. We observed gp120 binding
in all cases (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
The same extracts were tested in the TZM-bl cell HIV-
neutralization assays using the NL4.3-pseudotyped virus. The
extracts from T2 seeds expressing single components achieved
HIV-1 neutralization with titers of up to >104 [reciprocal di-
lution to a median infective dose (ID50)]. The best apparent IC50
values for each component were >119, 2.3, and 0.7 ng/mL
for 2G12, CV-N, and GRFT, respectively. Combinations of
2G12 and CV-N were no more effective than the corresponding
single-component extracts, but all combinations containing
GRFT showed high neutralization activity. Remarkably, we ob-
served substantially lower apparent IC50 values when all three
components were present. The lowest overall IC50 values were
observed in extracts from the triple transgenic lines 9, 10, and 11,
with IC50 ranges of 0.14–0.77 ng/mL for 2G12, 0.01–0.05 ng/mL
for CV-N, and 0.09–0.29 ng/mL for GRFT (Table 3). Assuming
that GRFT achieved the highest neutralizing activity (Table 3,
single transgenic lines), we compared the apparent IC50 values
for GRFT in single, double, and triple transgenic lines, revealing
significantly lower values for the extracts containing all three
components than for the extracts containing single and double
components (Fig. 3A), suggesting synergistic interactions similar
to those observed in the reconstitution experiments described
above. To confirm this observation, we mixed similar concen-
trations of CV-N or 2G12 single extracts with a GRFT extract
and calculated the GRFT apparent IC50 values. Again, dose–
response curves shifted in the presence of all three components,
and apparent IC50 values in the triple combination were lower
than for single components or double combinations (Fig. 3B).
These data suggest that the components may interact in pairwise
combinations but more profound synergy occurs in the triple
combination. We therefore compared the extracts from all
three triple transgenic lines against the single transgenic line
Table 1.

values: 1 ng/mL for CV-N and 100 ng/mL for 2G12. Values are expressed in

 expressing GRFT in TZM-bl cell HIV-neutralization assays using
the laboratory-adapted NL4.3 and the primary isolate SVPB16
pseudotyped viruses. In both cases, we observed lower apparent
IC50 values for GRFT in the triple transgenic lines than in the
single transgenic line, indicating that synergy occurred between
the microbicide components to increase the efficacy of the
combinatorial microbicide at lower concentrations, particularly
against a primary HIV-1 isolate (Fig. 4).
Fractionation of Rice Endosperm to Identify Potentiating Components.
Having discovered that a crude extract of rice endosperm can
increase the gp120-binding activity of GRFT and 2G12 but not
CV-N, we fractionated the extract into broad components to de-
termine the source of the active principle, using 2G12 as a case
study. We prepared a total protein extract and protein-depleted
extract and found that only the protein extract increased the
binding activity of 2G12, whereas the depleted extract was similar
in performance to the PBS control, indicating the source of the
activity was proteinaceous (Fig. 5). We therefore prepared the rice
endosperm extract again using the traditional approach to distin-
guish among different classes of seed-storage proteins: the albu-
mins (water extract), globulins (PBS extract), glutelins (alkaline
extract), and prolamins (ethanolic extract). ELISAs with these
fractions (used directly without buffer exchange), in addition to
the reconstituted PBS control, the protein extract, the protein-
depleted extract, and the original complete extract, provided
strong evidence that the active principle segregates primarily with
the globulin fraction of the endosperm (Fig. 5).
Discussion
Cereal plants such as rice expressing multiple HIV-neutralizing
proteins in GRAS-status seeds offer an inexpensive platform for
the production of microbicidal mixtures with the added benefit
that dry seeds can be stored indefinitely under ambient condi-
tions (48, 49). Rice has been developed as a production platform
for proteins that can be administered in minimally processed
seed extracts, such as oral vaccines and topical prophylactics,
without the need to remove toxic metabolites or endotoxins (33,
34, 49–53). Although there are many reports of plants expressing
multiple recombinant enzymes for metabolic engineering (54,
55), the only previous reports of multiple microbicidal compo-
nents have involved fusion proteins such as b12/CV-N (45) and
CV-N/12pi (56). The expression of mixtures of individual proteins

 is potentially more versatile because the relative quantities can be
varied, and different combinations can be produced by crossing
transgenic lines. However, the components must remain func-
tional when coexpressed, so it is necessary to check for interac-
tions such as antagonistic or synergistic binding and neutralization.
Our ELISA experiments revealed little evidence for in-
terference among the three components: the OD values for
GRFT bound to gp120 did not change in the presence of 0–
250 ng/mL CV-N, and vice versa. When we added 2G12 to the
samples, we observed the same OD values for 2G12 bound to
gp120 regardless of the presence or absence of either or both
lectins in the same concentration ranges as above. In the context
of CV-N and 2G12, CV-N pretreatment has been shown to
prevent 2G12 binding to gp120, but 2G12 pretreatment does not
prevent subsequent CV-N binding (57). Although CV-N can
block 2G12 binding to gp120, it does not interfere with other
neutralizing or nonneutralizing monoclonal antibodies binding
to the same protein, e.g., F5 and b12 (58). It is likely that
2G12 does not prevent CV-N binding to gp120, because there
are multiple CV-N–binding sites, and only some of them over-
lap the 2G12 epitope (58). Indeed, 2G12 binds an only par-
tially characterized, glycosylation-dependent epitope comprising
elements from the C2, C3, C4, and V4 domains of gp120 (59).
In the crystal structure of the 2G12–gp120 core (HXB2c) from
a laboratory isolate of HIV-1, a large fraction of the predicted
accessible surface of gp120 in the trimer was composed of vari-
able, heavily glycosylated core-and-loop structures that sur-
round the CD4- and coreceptor-binding regions (60–62). The
2G12 epitope overlaps the stem of the V3 loop and the
V4 variable region and is characterized by high-mannose glycans
(61). Also, 2G12 is unique in recognizing this epitope, although
the epitope is conserved across viral isolates. The gp120 crystal
structure indicates that there is a large, heavily glycosylated,
immunologically silent domain (60–62). It is possible that, in
addition to binding at or near the 2G12 epitope, CV-N might
bind other glycosylated domains in this immunologically silent
region. Both CV-N and 2G12 bind terminal αMan-(1, 2)-αMan
residues on gp120. However, CV-N seems to bind a single
N-linked glycan, whereas 2G12 interacts with two glycans si-
multaneously (63, 64). Our data suggest that the simultaneous
presentation of CV-N and 2G12 does not result in any reciprocal
cross-blocking between these components.
When we repeated the ELISA experiments using extracts from
wild-type rice endosperm instead of PBS at the same pH, we
observed a significant increase in the gp120-binding activity of
GRFT and 2G12 (both alone and in mixtures) but no equivalent
increase in the gp120-binding activity of CV-N. These experi-
ments indicated that a soluble component of the rice endosperm
can enhance the binding of 2G12 and GRFT (but not CV-N) to
gp120. Fractionation revealed that the principle responsible for
enhanced 2G12–gp120 and GRFT–gp120 binding separated with
the proteinaceous component, and further fractionation into the
four principal protein classes in the endosperm revealed that the
globulin fraction retained most of the activity. The extraction of
glutelins and prolamins requires 0.1 M NaOH and 70% ethanol
as solvents, respectively, both of which could interfere with
2G12–gp120 binding, but albumins are extracted in water, and
we did not observe any interference in control experiments,
suggesting that the restriction to globulins is genuine and not an
artifact of the extraction method. The mechanism of enhanced
2G12–gp120 and GRFT–gp120 binding is unclear, but possibilities

When GRFT is combined with 2G12 and CV-N in transgenic plants, the neutralization potency of GRFT is enhanced. (A) Plant extracts containing GRFT
alone, GRFT + 2G12, GRFT + CV-N, or GRFT + 2G12 + CV-N were tested against NL4.3 pseudotyped virus to evaluate GRFT-mediated neutralization. The bar
graph shows the mean GRFT IC50 from two or three different extracts for each composition (biological replicates), each tested in duplicate (technical rep-
licates). The asterisk denotes significant differences (*P < 0.05) between triple extracts and single/double extracts (Mann–Whitney U test). (B) GRFT dose–
response curve against NL4.3-pseudotyped virus. One plant extract containing only GRFT was serially diluted to evaluate its neutralization potency alone or in
the presence of 0.2 μg/mL 2G12, CV-N, or both from individual extracts.

 include an impact on the oligomerization state of the components,
molecular crowding affecting glycan-based binding sites, or in-
duced fitting as previously described for CV-N (65–67).
The ELISA data were consistent with the in vitro neutraliza-
tion assays, in which we observed the synergistic effect of rice
extracts against different HIV-1 strains (including a primary
isolate) and when using different forms of gp120 originating
from diverse HIV-1 isolates, suggesting that the effect mediated
by rice extracts could be broadly effective. We observed no ap-
parent antagonism or synergy among the three components
reconstituted in PBS, but there was a small additive effect when
CV-N and GRFT were combined. In contrast, when the same
components were reconstituted in rice endosperm extract, the
latter effect was repressed, although additive effects of 2G12 and
CV-N were still observed in a triple formulation. A previous
study with three components, i.e., CV-N, GRFT, and scytovirin
(SVN) all purified from Escherichia coli and then mixed (68),
provided evidence for antagonism, but by replacing SVN with
2G12 we demonstrated no interaction in PBS and synergy in rice
endosperm extracts, at least in terms of the potency of GRFT.
Synergy between 2G12 and GRFT was previously reported when
the components were produced separately and mixed (2G12 was
produced in CHO cells and GRFT in Nicotiana benthamiana)
(69), but we did not observe this binary synergy even in the rice
extracts, perhaps because of the different production and puri-
fication strategies. Synergistic neutralization activity was ob-
served only when all three of our microbicidal components were
present in rice endosperm extracts.
Having established that all three components were active in
reconstituted extracts, we generated transgenic lines expressing
the same proteins. The simultaneous expression of up to three
microbicidal components makes it very important to characterize
transgenic lines in terms of transgene integration and expression
to ensure there is a sufficient dose of each product in the extracts
to achieve full microbicidal activity. Our panel of 19 transgenic
lines included examples of all possible combinations of trans-
genes (single, double, and triple) which were passed as intact
units through to at least the T2 generation, confirming that the
transgenes supplied on different vectors integrated at a single
locus and there was no bias for the integration of particular se-
quences (70, 71). There was no interdependence among the
transgenes in terms of expression levels; e.g., the triple transgenic
line 11 expressed the highest level of 2G12 among all the lines
we tested (17.2 μg/g) but expressed comparatively low levels of
CV-N (1.2 μg/g) and moderate levels of GRFT (6.4 μg/g). The
absence of a correlation between different transgene expression
levels in the same lines suggests that the ideal relative dose of
each microbicide could be achieved by screening an appropri-
ate number of primary transformants. Our success rate of
∼15% triple transformants suggests that screening for ideal
combinatorial doses would require only a relatively small number
of lines, which is achievable in the case of rice due to the high
efficiency of the transformation process (54, 71, 72). Another
important result from the analysis of the double/triple transgenic
lines is that the simultaneous expression of multiple proteins does
not appear to attract a penalty in terms of achievable expression
levels.
We tested the extracts of the transgenic plants in the TZM-bl
cell HIV-neutralization assays to confirm that each component
was active against HIV-1 in the context of the transgenic rice en-
dosperm extract. Given the concentrations of active components
defined in the ELISA experiments, the HIV-1–neutralization assays
were also anticipated to reveal any interactions between the com-
ponents that might affect their overall activity, e.g., synergy or an-
tagonism. In agreement with our data, the reported IC50 for the
inhibition of HIV-1 strain NL4.3 by 2G12 is 0.98 μg/mL and by
CV-N is 0.78 μg/mL (73). We observed a lower IC50 value for two
extracts and no activity for the third one. For GRFT, the IC50 values
were consistent and clearly lower in extracts containing both
2G12 and CV-N but not in extracts containing GRFT plus one of
the other components. Our results therefore showed that the triple
combination of GRFT with 2G12 and CV-N enhances the neu-
tralization potency of GRFT both in transgenic plants and when the
same components are reconstituted in rice endosperm extracts.
These data indicate there is a synergistic effect solely when the triple
combination of components is present in rice extract, i.e., GRFT is
more active against HIV-1 at a lower concentration than anticipated
from the concentrations and neutralization activities in the single
transgenic lines.
Materials and Methods
ELISA. The specific antigen-binding activity of each protein was determined
by coating the wells of ELISA plates with 100 ng recombinant gp120 IIIB or
gp120 W61D (MRC Centralized Facility for AIDS Reagents). After washing
with PBS + 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) and blocking with 2.5% BSA in PBST, serial
dilutions of rice 2G12, GRFT, or CV-N were added. The presence of bound
2G12 was detected using an HRP-conjugated sheep anti-human κ chain
antiserum (The Binding Site) diluted 1:1,000. GRFT and CV-N were detected
using primary rabbit anti-GRFT and anti–CV-N polyclonal antisera (The
Binding Site) and a secondary HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (The
Binding Site), each diluted 1:1,000. For the recapitulation experiments, each
ELISA was carried out three times with 2G12 and lectins diluted in PBS and
another three times with 2G12 and lectins diluted in wild-type rice endosperm
extract (prepared by extraction in PBS). The three components were tested
alone, in all three pairwise combinations, and as a mixture of all three com-
ponents at different concentrations.
The yield of soluble, correctly folded protein in transgenic endosperm
tissue was confirmed by grinding seeds in three volumes of PBS and
centrifuging twice at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris. The
wells of ELISA plates were coated with 100 ng recombinant gp120 IIIB or
gp120 W61D. After washing and blocking as above, serial dilutions of each
seed extract were added, and the three proteins were detected using the
Fig. 4.

 antibodies described above. Dilution series of standards produced in CHO
cells (2G12) or E. coli (GRFT and CV-N) were used to construct a calibration
curve to calculate the concentration of each component in plant extracts.
The final concentration (in micrograms per gram) of each protein in the
extract was calculated as the product of the OD450 value, taking the dilution
factors into consideration, and the amount of buffer (120 μL) divided by the
weight of the seeds (30 mg).
HIV-Neutralization Assays. HIV-1 pseudoviruses (NL4.3 and SVPB16 isolates)
were generated by the cotransfection of 293T cells with Env-expressing
plasmids and the PSG3 vector as previously described (74, 75). The super-
natants were harvested 24 h posttransfection and were passed through a
0.45-μm filter; the viral stocks were frozen at −80 °C. Cell-free HIV neutral-
ization was tested using a standard TZM-bl–based assay as described in SI
Appendix, Supplementary Methods (74, 75).
Transformation and Recovery of Transgenic Plants. Seven-day-old mature rice
zygotic embryos (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare) were transferred to os-
motic medium [4.4 g/L Murashige and Skoog (MS) powder supplemented
with 0.3 g/L casein hydrolysate, 0.5 g/L proline, 72.8 g/L mannitol, and
30 g/L sucrose] 4 h before bombardment with 10-mg gold particles coated
with the four constructs carrying the microbicidal transgenes (SI Appen-
dix, Supplementary Methods) and the selectable marker hpt (76–79). We
used a 6:6:3:3:1 ratio with the 2G12 heavy and light chains represented at
twice the molar ratio of the lectins to ensure the recovery of plants
expressing all four transgenes and the hpt marker gene as the minority
component. The embryos were returned to osmotic medium for 12 h
before selection on MS medium (4.4 g/L MS powder, 0.3 g/L casein, 0.5 g/L
proline, and 30 g/L sucrose) supplemented with 50 mg/L hygromycin and
2.5 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in the dark for 2–3 wk. Trans-
genic plantlets were regenerated and hardened off in soil. Plants were grown
in the greenhouse or growth chamber at 28/20 °C day/night temperature with
a 10-h photoperiod and 60–90% relative humidity for the first 50 d, followed
by maintenance at 21/18 °C day/night temperature with a 16-h photoperiod
thereafter in a growth chamber.
Endosperm Fractionation. Protein fractions were prepared by the overnight
precipitation of rice endosperm extracts with ammonium sulfate (80) followed by
centrifugation at 4,500 × g for 30 min. The protein pellet was resuspended in PBS,
and the supernatant was used as the protein-free fraction. The seed protein
fractions were prepared as previously described (81, 82) by mixing 2 g of rice flour
with 10 mL of solvent for 90 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for
15 min at 4 °C. Albumins were extracted with water, globulins with PBS, glutelins
with 0.1 M NaOH, and prolamins with 70% ethanol. The supernatant in each
case was used directly in the ELISA. The supernatants were tested for their impact
on gp120–2G12 binding; water, PBS, and 70% ethanol preserved the interaction,
but no binding was observed in 0.1 M NaOH.
Statistical Analysis. A randomized complete ANOVA was applied to each
component (2G12, CV-N, and GRFT) at each concentration, and statistically
significant differences between rice endosperm extracts and PBS, between
different transgenic plant lines, and between different endosperm fractions,
were determined, using Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons, or the Mann–
Whitney U test for pairwise comparisons, in JMP-PRO v12.0.1 (SAS Institute Inc.).
Statistical significance was expressed as follows: ***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05.
A nonlinear regression function was also used to determine the performance of
each component at different concentrations, a quadratic nonlinear regression
curve was fitted, and statistically significant differences were determined by com-
paring the fitted curve parameters. Model fitting and parameter estimations were
carried out using GraphPad Prism v7.03 (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
