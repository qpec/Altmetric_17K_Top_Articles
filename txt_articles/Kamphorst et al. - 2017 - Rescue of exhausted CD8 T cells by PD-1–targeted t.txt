Programmed cell death–1 (PD-1)–targeted therapies enhance T cell responses and
show efficacy in multiple cancers, but the role of costimulatory molecules in this
T cell rescue remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the CD28/B7 costimulatory
pathway is essential for effective PD-1 therapy during chronic viral infection. Conditional
gene deletion showed a cell-intrinsic requirement of CD28 for CD8 T cell proliferation
after PD-1 blockade. B7-costimulation was also necessary for effective PD-1 therapy
in tumor-bearing mice. In addition, we found that CD8 T cells proliferating in blood
after PD-1 therapy of lung cancer patients were predominantly CD28-positive. Taken
together, these data demonstrate CD28-costimulation requirement for CD8 T cell
rescue and suggest an important role for the CD28/B7 pathway in PD-1 therapy of
cancer patients.
I
n recent years, strategies that reinvigorate
tumor-specific T cells have uncovered the
potential of immunotherapy (1). Sustained ex-
pression of the inhibitory receptorprogrammed
cell death–1 (PD-1) characterizes exhausted
T cells, and PD-1–targeted therapies have shown
clinical activity in a wide variety of cancer types
(2, 3). However, not all patients experience clinical
benefit from PD-1 therapy, and there is a critical
need to determine the requirements for optimal
T cell rescue not only to improve current therapies
but also to identify predictive biomarkers. Block-
ade of inhibitory molecules improves function of
exhausted T cells, but it is not known whether
rescue of exhausted CD8 T cells also requires po-
sitive costimulation. CD28 is a key T cell costi-
mulatory molecule that binds B7 molecules (4).
CD28 engagement reduces the T cell receptor
signaling threshold required for T cell activation
and may provide qualitatively different signals
(5). Naïve CD8 T cells are more dependent than
antigen-experienced cells on CD28, and the re-
quirement for CD28 signaling varies according
to strength and duration of antigen exposure (6–8).
In this study, we address the role of the CD28/
B7 pathway for rescue of exhausted CD8 T cells
after PD-1 therapy using the mouse model of life-
long chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
(LCMV) infection (9, 10). Expression of CD28 on
LCMV-specific exhausted CD8 T cells was similar
to naïve T cells but lower than LCMV-specific mem-
ory CD8 T cells (fig. S1). CD28 expression did not
change significantly on LCMV-specific CD8 T cells
after PD-1 therapy of chronically infected mice (fig.
S2). To determine the role of CD28-costimulation
in PD-1–mediated rescue of exhausted CD8 T cells,
we first blocked the CD28/B7 pathway by means
of CTLA-4–immunoglobin (Ig) fusion protein
administration during anti-PD-L1 therapy of
chronically infected mice (Fig. 1A). As reported
by Barber et al., PD-1 blockade rescues virus-
specific CD8 T cells in LCMV chronically in-
fected mice (11). Rescue was evident from the
increased frequency and number of LCMV-
specific CD8 T cells in anti-PD-L1–treated
mice (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, CTLA-4-Ig pre-
vented anti-PD-L1–mediated expansion of LCMV-
specific CD8 T cells in multiple tissues (Fig. 1, B
and C, and fig. S3A). CD8 T cells expanded by PD-
L1 blockade also regained effector function, as
evidenced by increased interferon-g (IFN-g) pro-
duction (fig. S3, B and C). However, when CTLA-
4-Ig was combined with anti-PD-L1, IFN-g pro-
duction was similar to that in untreated mice (fig.
S3, B and C). Thus, CTLA-4-Ig prevented rescue
of LCMV-specific CD8 T cell responses mediated
by PD-1 blockade.
To further extend these observations, we ad-
ministered blocking antibodies to B7-1 (CD80)
and B7-2 (CD86) to chronically infected mice
during anti-PD-L1 therapy (Fig. 1A). B7 block-
ade prevented anti-PD-L1–mediated expansion
of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells in spleen, lung,
and liver (Fig. 1D). Accordingly, B7 blockade
precluded cell-cycle progression of LCMV-specific
CD8 T cells (Fig. 1E). B7 engagement was also
necessary for increase in granzyme B expres-
sion on LCMV-specific CD8 T cells upon PD-1
blockade (Fig. 1F). In addition, when anti-PD-L1
was combined to B7 blockade, there was no in-
crease in IFN-g–producing cells compared with
that of untreated mice (Fig. 1, G and H). Last,
anti-PD-L1 therapy was unable to reduce the
viral load of chronically infected mice that re-
ceived B7 blockade (Fig. 1, I and J). These data
show that B7-costimulation is required for ef-
fective PD-1 therapy in LCMV chronically infected
mice. To ensure that transient inhibition of the
B7 pathway had no meaningful impact on the
maintenance of exhausted CD8 T cells, we used
an adoptive transfer of transgenic CD8 T cells
specific for LCMV-GP33 (P14 cells) (Fig. 1K).
The number of P14 cells was increased with PD-
L1 therapy but remained similar between mice
treated with the anti-PD-L1/anti-B7 combination,
mice treated with anti-B7 antibodies alone, or
untreated mice (Fig. 1L and fig. S4). Likewise,
IFN-g production by P14 cells was similar be-
tween mice receiving anti-PD-L1/anti-B7, mice
receiving anti-B7 alone, or untreated mice (Fig.
1M). Hence, transient B7-blockade in mice with
established chronic LCMV infection had no ma-
jor effects on virus-specific CD8 T cells and did
not affect viral load (fig. S5).
PD-L1 can also bind B7-1 to deliver an inhibitory
signal (12, 13). The anti-PD-L1 antibodies used in
thisstudy function by blocking both PD-L1/PD-1 and
PD-L1/B7-1 interactions (14). To further clarify and
confirm the role of B7/CD28-costimulation in res-
cuing exhausted CD8 T cells during PD-1 therapy,
instead of anti-PD-L1, we used two different clones
of anti-PD-1 blocking antibodies (figs. S6 and S7)
(10). Similar to the data obtained with anti-PD-L1,
B7-blockadealsopreventedrescueofLCMV-specific
CD8 T cells mediated through administration of
anti-PD-1.
To directly determine a cell-intrinsic require-
ment for CD28 signaling in PD-1–mediated res-
cue, we examined whether CD28-deficient P14
CD8 T cells could be rescued by anti-PD-L1 block-
ing antibodies during chronic LCMV infection
(fig. S8). PD-1 blockade resulted in expansion
of WT P14 cells, whereas P14 cells in which
CD28 was knocked out (CD28KO) failed to ex-
pand in blood, spleen, or lung. These data show

 that CD28 deficiency prevents expansion of
exhausted CD8 T cells by PD-L1 blockade in a
cell-intrinsic manner in both lymphoid and
nonlymphoid organs of chronically infected
mice. However, activation and differentiation of
naïve CD28KO P14 cells into exhausted T cells
may not appropriately mirror exhaustion of
CD28-expressing CD8 T cells. To overcome this
issue, we used an inducible genetic deletion
system to investigate whether loss of CD28 ex-
pression in already exhausted CD8 T cells would
also impair rescue by PD-1 blockade (Fig. 2A).
CD28 deletion by tamoxifen was achieved in
~50% of P14 cells expressing CreERT2, and CD28-
expressing cells could be easily distinguished
from CD28-deficient cells (Fig. 2B). In mice
treated with anti-PD-L1 blocking antibodies,
Ki-67 expression on P14 cells was largely re-
stricted to CD28-expressing cells (Fig. 2, B and
C). Thus, PD-1 blockade was ineffective to in-
duce proliferation of exhausted P14 cells that
had lost CD28.
To determine whether cell-intrinsic CD28 ex-
pression also affects responsiveness of nontrans-
genic exhausted CD8 T cells to PD-1 blockade,
we performed similar experiments in mixed
bone marrow chimeric mice (Fig. 2D). We as-
sessed proliferation of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells
by means of Ki-67 expression after anti-PD-L1
treatment and found that proliferation was re-
stricted to CD28+ cells (Fig. 2, E to G). Selective
proliferation of CD28-expressing cells through
PD-1 therapy resulted in decreased frequency
of CD28neg cells among PD-1+ LCMV-specific Cre+
CD8 T cells compared with those of untreated
mice. In contrast, we found no differences in the
frequency of CD28neg cells among PD-1neg CD8
T cells between untreated and anti-PD-L1–treated
mice (Fig. 2H). Proliferation of PD-1+ CD8 T cells
after blockade of the PD-1 pathway during
chronic LCMV infection is contingent on CD28
expression.
To examine whether CD28 signaling would
also be necessary for reinvigoration of anti-tumor
CD8 T cell responses, we analyzed the role of
the CD28/B7 pathway for tumor control of CT26
colon carcinoma through PD-1 therapy. We ob-
served rapid tumor growth in all untreated mice
and mice receiving anti-B7, whereas PD-L1–
blocking antibodies elicited tumor regression in
eight of nine animals. In contrast, 8 of 10 mice
receiving anti-PD-L1 in combination with B7-
blocking antibodies showed tumor progression
(Fig. 3A). The effectiveness of PD-1 therapy for
suppressing CT26 tumor growth resulted in a sig-
nificant improvement in overall survival of anti-
PD-L1–treatedmicecomparedwithuntreatedmice
(P < 0.001), mice treated with anti-B7 alone (P <
0.001), or mice receiving both anti-PD-L1 and anti-
B7 (P = 0.0169) (Fig. 3B). Also, there was no sig-
nificant improvement in the survival of mice
treated with anti-PD-L1 plus anti-B7 compared
with untreated mice (P = 0.1092). The summary
of three independent experiments is shown in
Fig. 3C. In accordance to our findings, PD-1 block-
ade failedtocontrolgrowthof YUMM2.1 melanoma

is necessary for effective PD-1 therapy in a mouse
tumor model.

 therapies. We hypothesized that human PD-1+
CD8 T cells would need to express CD28 in order
to efficiently expand on PD-1 therapy. Human effec-
tor CD8 T cells induced by vaccination have been
identified through human lymphocyte antigen–
antigen D related (HLA-DR), CD38, and Ki-67 ex-
pression (16). Hence, we analyzed proliferation
(Ki-67) and activation (HLA-DR and CD38) of
peripheral blood PD-1+ CD8 T cells during PD-1
therapy in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients (Fig. 4A). After therapy initiation, in about
half of patients we observed an increase in Ki-67–
expressing CD8 T cells, largely restricted to PD-1–
positive cells (Fig. 4B) (17). These CD8 T cells also
expressed high levels of CD38 and HLA-DR (Fig. 4
C). To assess expression of CD28 on CD8 T cells
responding to PD-1 therapy, we focused our an-
alysis on patients that had at least a twofold in-
crease in the frequency of Ki-67+ PD-1+ CD8 T cells
(Fig. 4D). In accordance with our predictions,
PD-1+ CD8 T cells activated by PD-1 therapy in
NSCLC patients were mostly CD28+. These data
suggest that CD28 signals may also be important
for proliferation of PD-1+ CD8 T cells during PD-1
therapy in cancer patients.
Many studies have assessed expression of in-
hibitory receptors on exhausted CD8 T cells, but
positive costimulatory molecules have not been a
major focus. In humans, antigen-experienced CD8
T cells can lose CD28 expression, and loss of CD28
has been associated with chronic stimulation (18).
Weobtainedtumorsamplesfromearly-stageNSCLC
patients and examined CD28 expression on freshly
isolated CD8 T cells (fig. S9A). Confirming previous

infiltratinglymphocyte(TIL)population,inindividual

 a higher proportion of CD28-positive cells when
compared with TIM-3+ PD-1+ TILs in the same
tumor (fig. S9, D and E). Thus, many human CD8
TILs do not express CD28 and—according to our
data and hypothesis, as well as with previous
studies on T cell senescence—therefore may be
less responsive to proliferate upon PD-1 blockade
(18, 19).
Our laboratory recently identified in chroni-
cally infected mice the LCMV-specific CD8 T cell
subpopulation that provides the proliferative burst
after PD-1 therapy (21). These stem-cell–like TIM-
3neg PD-1+ TCF-1+ virus-specific CD8 T cells express
higher levels of positive costimulatory molecules
(CD28, ICOS, OX40, and LIGHT) and lower levels
of inhibitory receptors as compared with TIM-3+
PD-1+ TCF-1neg counterparts that do not expand
after PD-1 therapy. Yet in spite of the expression
of several positive costimulatory molecules by
TIM-3neg PD-1+ TCF-1+ virus-specific CD8 T cells,
we show that CD28-signaling plays a major and
nonredundant role for response to PD-1 blockade.
ThishighlightsthedominantroleofCD28 signaling
in the proliferative response to PD-1 blockade.
Because most tumors (and many virus-infected
cells) do not express B7 molecules, our model im-
plicates participation of B7-expressing antigen-
presenting cells in the efficacy of PD-1 therapy.
Indeed, recent studies found associations be-
tween dendritic cell infiltration and matura-
tion and response to PD-1 blockade (22, 23). The
PD-1 pathway can modulate T cell responses at
two different levels: (i) reducing T cell activation
by antigen-presenting cells and (ii) inhibiting
target cell elimination (infected cells or tu-
mors) (24). Because most target cells do not
express B7, it is conceivable that local elimina-
tion of target cells may be enhanced by PD-1
blockade in a CD28-independent manner. In
contrast, we show that T cell expansion that fol-
lows PD-1 therapy requires CD28-costimulation.
Efficacy of PD-1 therapy in cancer patients has
been associated with proliferation of CD8 TILs
(25). Therefore, systemic effects of PD-1 block-
ade that result in clinical benefit most likely
require amplification of T cell responses through
the proliferation of PD-1+ CD8 T cells and thus
CD28-costimulation.
We show a cell-intrinsic requirement for CD28-
costimulation in the expansionof PD-1+CD8 T cells
and effectiveness of PD-1 therapy in mouse models
of chronic viral infection and cancer. In lung cancer
patients, PD-1+ CD8 T cells that proliferate in the
peripheral blood after PD-1 blockade express CD28.
Our data imply selective proliferation of CD28+
cells through PD-1 therapy and suggest further
evaluation of CD28 as a potential biomarker to
predict CD8 T cell responses in cancer patients.
In addition, Hui et. al. show that PD-1 directly
targets CD28 cytoplasmic tail, with higher affinity
than that of T cell receptor downstream mole-
cules, further emphasizing the interplay between
the CD28 and the PD-1 pathway (26). Taken to-
gether, these data provide greater insight into the
molecules and interactions involved in T cell ex-
haustion and PD-1–directed immunotherapy.
