IMPORTANCE Vascular risk factors have been associated with cognitive decline. Midlife
exposure to these factors may be most important in conferring late-life risk of cognitive
impairment.
OBJECTIVES To examine Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) participants in midlife
and to explore associations between midlife vascular risk factors and 25-year dementia
incidence.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort investigation of the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study was conducted from 1987-1989 through
2011-2013. The dates of this analysis were April 2015 through August 2016. The setting was
ARIC field centers (Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson,
Mississippi; and Minneapolis suburbs, Minnesota). The study comprised 15 744 participants
(of whom 27.1% were black and 72.9% white) who were aged 44 to 66 years at baseline.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Demographic and vascular risk factors were measured at
baseline (obesity, smoking, diabetes, prehypertension, hypertension, and hypercholester-
olemia) as well as presence of the APOE ε4 genotype. After the baseline visit, participants
had 4 additional in-person visits, for a total of 5 in-person visits, hospitalization surveillance,
telephone calls, and repeated cognitive evaluations. Most recently, in 2011-2013, through the
ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS), participants underwent a detailed neurocognitive
battery, informant interviews, and adjudicated review to define dementia cases. Additional
cases were identified through the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status–Modified or
informant interview, for participants not attending the ARIC-NCS visit, or by an International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision dementia code during a hospitalization. Fully
adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate associations of baseline
vascular and demographic risk factors with dementia.
RESULTS In total, 1516 cases of dementia (57.0% female and 34.9% black, with a mean [SD]
age at visit 1 of 57.4 [5.2] years) were identified among 15 744 participants. Black race (hazard
ratio [HR], 1.36; 95% CI, 1.21-1.54), older age (HR, 8.06; 95% CI, 6.69-9.72 for participants
aged 60-66 years), lower educational attainment (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.28-2.03 for less than a
high school education), and APOE ε4 genotype (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.78-2.21) were associated
with increased risk of dementia, as were midlife smoking (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.23-1.61), diabetes
(HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.53-2.04), prehypertension (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14-1.51), and hypertension
(HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.22-1.59). The HR for dementia for diabetes was almost as high as that for
APOE ε4 genotype.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Midlife vascular risk factors are associated with increased
risk of dementia in black and white ARIC Study participants. Further studies are needed to
evaluate the mechanism of and opportunities for prevention of the cognitive sequelae of
these risk factors in midlife.

ascular risk factors are increasingly recognized as im-
portant contributors to the development of dementia
and thus as targets for future therapies. Midlife vascu-
lar risk factors appear to be most strongly associated with later-
life cognitive decline, as supported by reports from the Ath-
erosclerosisRiskinCommunities(ARIC)Studyandothercohort
studies.1-4 Vascular risk factors may cause vascular demen-
tia, contribute to the impairment associated with Alzheimer
disease (AD), or lead to AD itself5; midlife hypertension alone
is estimated to be responsible for 425 000 additional cases of
AD in the United States annually.6
In the above-cited and other studies of vascular risk fac-
tors and dementia, ascertainment of dementia has been lim-
ited to those participants who are able to attend an in-person
evaluation (for epidemiological studies) or patients who vol-
untarily enroll in a memory clinic cohort, potentially leading
to selection bias. Persons with dementia are more likely to be
lost to follow-up or reside in nursing facilities, which may lead
to ascertainment and examination of a biased sample of cases,
diluting estimates of risk factor associations. While some stud-
ies use careful rigorous dementia ascertainment methods, few
studies combine such ascertainment with longitudinal asso-
ciations in a racially diverse population.
In this study, we examined ARIC participants in midlife,
whenvascularriskassessmentappearstobemostcritical,using
several methods to maximize completeness of dementia as-
certainment, including information from 5 in-person visits (af-
ter the baseline visit, participants had 4 additional in-person
visits), telephone calls, informant interview for living and de-
ceased participants, and use of International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes from hospitalizations
and death certificates. We hypothesized that midlife vascular
risk factors (ie, obesity, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and
hypercholesterolemia) would be associated with incident de-
mentia, with the strongest associations among black partici-
pants and persons with an APOE ε4 allele (OMIM 107741), the
primary known genetic risk factor for AD.
Methods
Participants
In 1987-1989, the prospective cohort ARIC Study recruited
15 792 participants aged 44 to 66 years from ARIC field cen-
ters in 4 US communities (Washington County, Maryland;
Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; and
Minneapolis suburbs, Minnesota), with the goal of evaluat-
ing atherosclerosis and its risk factors.7 The present analysis
includes 15 744 participants who reported their race at base-
line as black (27.1%) or white (72.9%). Since visit 1 at baseline
(1987-1989), participants were seen at the following 4 addi-
tional visits: visit 2 (1990-1992), visit 3 (1993-1995), visit 4
(1996-1998), and visit 5 as part of the ARIC Neurocognitive
Study(ARIC-NCS)(2011-2013)(Figure1).Thedatesofthisanaly-
siswereApril2015throughAugust2016.Participantswerecon-
tacted by telephone (annually and then semiannually since
2012), with hospital record abstraction and adjudication of
clinical cardiovascular events, followed by informant inter-
views after a participant’
s death. The study was approved by
each site’
s institutional review board (at The Johns Hopkins
University, Wake Forest University, University of Mississippi
Medical Center, and University of Minnesota), and written in-
formed consent was signed by all participants (and proxies,
when required).
Visits 2, 4, and 5 each included 3 cognitive tests (Delayed
Word Recall, Word Fluency, and Digit Symbol Substitution).
Visit5includedadetailedneuropsychologicalassessment,rep-
resenting 3 cognitive domains; participants with cognitive de-
cline and a random sample of those without cognitive decline8
(eMethods in the Supplement) were invited for further test-
ing, including informant interview, with the Clinical Demen-
tia Rating, the Functional Activities Questionnaire, and the
Neuropsychiatric Inventory.
Covariates
All ARIC visits include vascular risk factor assessments, de-
fined herein from visit 1. Sex, race (selected from several
choices), date of birth, and educational attainment (less than
high school, high school graduate or general equivalency di-
ploma, or beyond high school) are self-reported. The presence
Key Points
Question Do vascular risk factors measured in middle age
increase risk of dementia in later life?
Findings In this cohort study of 15 744 black and white adults,
midlife smoking, diabetes, prehypertension, and hypertension
were associated with risk of dementia.
Meaning Potentially modifiable vascular risk factors in midlife
may be associated with later-life dementia; further studies are
needed to evaluate the influence of risk factor control.

 of diabetes (fasting glucose level ≥126 mg/dL, nonfasting glu-
cose level ≥200 mg/dL, self-report of physician-diagnosed dia-
betes, or use of oral diabetes medications or insulin) was re-
corded(toconvertglucoseleveltomillimolesperliter,multiply
by 0.0555). Also recorded was the presence of hypertension
(systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure
≥90 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive medications [the mean
of the last 2 blood pressure measurements was used]) or
prehypertension (not meeting hypertension criteria,
systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm Hg, and diastolic blood pres-
sure ≥80 mm Hg). Smoking was self-reported (current, for-
mer, or never). Prevalent coronary heart disease was self-
reported (yes or no), and prevalent stroke before visit 1 was
self-reported, with incident strokes from visit 1 through
visit 5 adjudicated by expert review by one of us (R.F.G. and
a nonauthor). Body mass index was calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared. APOE ε4 car-
riers, genotyped previously, were defined based on the num-
ber of ε4 alleles (0, 1, or 2), with 680 individuals classified as
having unknown APOE ε4 genotype status. Plasma total cho-
lesterol level was measured using enzymatic methods.9,10
Dementia
Dementia ascertainment was classified in 3 ways.8 Level 1 in-
cludes adjudicated dementia from complete evaluation at the
ARIC-NCSvisit.Theseassessmentsincorporateddatafromlon-
gitudinal cognitive evaluations (visits 2, 4, and 5), complete
neuropsychological battery at the ARIC-NCS visit (visit 5), and
the informant interview, with expert classification of cogni-
tive status8; computer algorithmic diagnoses generated stan-
dardized definitions of dementia, which were confirmed by
these same experts (7 of us, R.F.G., M.S.A., L.H.C., G.M.M.,
T.H.M., B.G.W., D.S.K., and O. Selnes, PhD, a nonauthor). Level
2 includes level 1 plus (1) participants who did not attend visit
5 but were classified as having dementia based on predefined
criteria8 from the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status–
Modified (TICSm), (2) living or deceased persons classified as
having dementia based on predefined criteria8 from infor-
mant telephone interviews using a modified version of the
Clinical Dementia Rating and the Functional Activities Ques-
tionnaire among a subset identified as having suspect demen-
tia, and (3) a random sample described elsewhere.8 Level 3,
theoutcomeinthisanalysis,alsoincludesdementiacasesiden-
tified solely by surveillance based on a prior discharge hospi-
talization ICD-9 or death certificate code for dementia11,12
through the date of last participant contact up to September
1, 2013.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical software (SAS, version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc) was
used for analysis. Time to onset of dementia was the primary
outcome. Because participants identified via level 1 under-
went complete neurocognitive assessment at a discrete time
point (2011-2013), we defined dementia onset as the date of
assessment; however, for Level 1 dementia cases who also had
a prior dementia hospitalization, we used the hospitalization
date.ForparticipantswithLevel2orLevel3dementia,weused
the earliest date from the TICSm, informant interview, hospi-
talization discharge, or death certificate code, as applicable.
To account for the expected lag in ascertainment of dementia
identified by informant interviews, hospitalization, and death,
6 months was subtracted from these dates to yield an esti-
mated date of onset. Participants without a dementia diagno-
sis (through any level) were censored at the latest date among
the visit 5 assessment, TICSm, or informant interview (when
available) or at the date of last participant contact up to Sep-
tember 1, 2013.
Primary analyses used Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion models. Because of uncertainty about the exact date of
dementia onset, we also evaluated a discrete time analysis bi-
nary model with a complementary log-log link (with time di-
vided into 5-year intervals, allowing assignment of a timeline
for diagnosis, without requiring a specific date). To assess sen-
sitivity of results to misclassification of dementia diagnoses
based on discharge and death codes, we fit a logistic regres-
sion of Level 1 or Level 2 dementia (excluding those with only
a hospitalization code). A further sensitivity analysis ac-
counted for the competing risk of stroke or nondementia death
with a competing risks proportional hazards model13 in which
participants with a competing event are included in the risk
setfordementiaatanytimeafterthecompetingeventbutwith
a weight of 1 or less that reduces over time after the compet-
ing event. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis that ex-
cluded participants with a stroke before visit 5.
Models included all the covariates described above in
the Covariates subsection. We checked for collinearity and
evaluated interactions between the primary vascular risk
factors and APOE ε4 genotype (any vs no ε4 allele, ignoring
the unknown APOE ε4 genotype status group), between the
primary vascular risk factors and race (hypothesizing stron-
ger associations in black participants), and between the pri-
mary vascular risk factors and sex (hypothesizing similar
associations by sex). Race was specifically evaluated given
prior investigations demonstrating disparities in dementia
rates.14 In addition, analyses were stratified by age at study
baseline (44-54 vs 55-66 years) to determine whether asso-
ciations were stronger in earlier vs later midlife. Wald χ2
tests were used to test the significance of each interaction,
and a final model was fit that included interactions with
2-sided P < .10. The proportional hazards assumption was
checked using Martingale residuals and by fitting interac-
tions with time.

 group had dementia, with fewer in the other groups in whom
dementia was ascertained.
Risk Factors for Dementia
Of the 15 744 participants, 15 407 (97.9%) had nonmissing data
on all the covariates of interest except for APOE ε4 genotype.
In our primary analysis, the multivariable hazard for demen-
tia was increased in persons of black race and in those with
baseline older age, lower educational attainment, current
smoking, diabetes, and prehypertension and hypertension, as
well as among APOE ε4 carriers (Table 2). Although, other than
age,APOEgenotypestatuswasthestrongestriskfactorforsub-
sequent risk of dementia, with a near doubling of risk for at
least 1 ε4 allele, midlife diabetes neared this effect size (haz-
ard ratio [HR], 1.77; 95% CI, 1.53-2.04). Total cholesterol level
was not associated with increased hazard of dementia; in sepa-
rate models, other lipid fractions were evaluated and also were
not significant. Risk for dementia was minimally reduced in
women compared with men.
Stratified Analyses
We evaluated our Cox proportional hazards regression mod-
els stratified in separate models by race, sex, APOE genotype
status, and baseline age. When stratified by race (Table 2), risk
for dementia associated with having at least 1 APOE ε4 allele
was greater for whites (HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.96-2.54) than for
blacks (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.34-1.92), with a significant APOE ε4
genotypebyraceinteraction(interactionP < .01).Midlifesmok-
ing status was also a predictor only among white participants
and not among black participants, with stronger influences of
age in whites compared with blacks (interaction P < .01 for
each). Other risk factors had similar results among both races.
Dementia had similar predictors in men and women (eTable
2 in the Supplement).
APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers had similar associa-
tions between vascular risk factors and dementia (eTable 3 in
the Supplement); the APOE ε4 genotype by race interaction
was again found. No other significant interactions with APOE
ε4 genotype were identified. With baseline age stratification
(eTable 4 in the Supplement), educational attainment, cur-
rent smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and total cholesterol
level all showed somewhat stronger elevated risk among the
younger age group (44-54 years) than among the older age
group (55-66 years), but differences were significant only for
educational attainment and diabetes.
Sensitivity Analyses
Because clinical strokes might mediate the influence of vas-
cular risk factors on subsequent dementia, we repeated the
analysis after excluding 1430 participants with stroke. Re-
sults in this sample were similar to those of the full cohort
(eTable 5 in the Supplement). In sensitivity analyses treating
stroke and death as competing risks to dementia, associa-
tionsweresomewhatattenuatedforrace,currentsmoking,dia-
betes, and hypertension, but all remained statistically signifi-
cant (Table 3).
Findingsusingacomplementarylog-loglinkanalysis,con-
sidering dementia cases during intervals, and using logistic re-
gression, with exclusion of those cases identified only via hos-
pitalization codes, showed similar results compared with our
primary Cox proportional hazards regression model. These re-
sults are summarized in eTable 6 in the Supplement.

 Discussion
This analysis of incident dementia in a biracial community-
based cohort demonstrates increased risk of dementia among
personswiththefollowingcharacteristics:blackrace,olderage,
lowereducationalattainment,currentsmoking,diabetesorhy-
pertension in midlife, and the presence of at least 1 APOE ε4
allele. These findings support prior reports that emphasize the
importance of midlife vascular risk factors in subsequent
dementia,15-18 adding new information about risk from pre-
hypertension.Incontrasttosomepriorinvestigations,theARIC
Study, which includes a large number of black and white par-
ticipants, obtained detailed evaluations during midlife and ex-
tensive surveillance of dementia, comorbidities, and mortal-
ity,aswellasformalassessmentstodiagnosedementiainthose
evaluated in person. Results from previous studies have also
suggested higher rates of dementia in blacks19,20 and in per-
sons with lower educational attainment,21-23 as supported by
this study.
Although supportive of previous investigations demon-
strating the importance of midlife vascular risk factors in the
development of subsequent dementia, by ascertaining cases
of dementia using several methods, our study adds to the ex-
isting literature by avoiding many of the biases caused by in-
complete case ascertainment or use of memory clinic cohorts
and by evaluating a racially diverse population over decades.
Our approach allowed for inclusion of deceased participants
among our cases by using hospitalization and death certifi-
cate codes for dementia and by obtaining informant inter-
views for deceased participants in whom suspicion for de-
mentia was high, as well as those participants who are so

 cognitively impaired that they cannot attend a clinic visit or
complete neuropsychological testing. We also found some
novel associations, including the higher risk for dementia as-
sociated with prehypertension in midlife.
Furthermore, we evaluated differential influences of risk
factors by race. We did not detect major differences by race in
the relative influence of midlife vascular risk factors on de-
mentia incidence, other than smoking, which contradicts pre-
vious hypotheses that differences in the influence of vascu-
lardiseaseoncognitionbyracemayexplainracialdisparities.24
However, it is possible that risk factors are longer lasting and
moreprevalentamongblacksthanamongwhites;wefindmore
hypertension in blacks than in whites, although smoking is
more common in whites than in blacks in the ARIC cohort25
and appears to also be a stronger risk factor in whites, per-
haps because of their smoking more cigarettes. This differ-
ence in risk factor prevalence would affect attributable risk (ie,
more dementia cases among blacks would be attributed to hy-
pertensionanddiabetes)andthuswouldstillbeconsistentwith
our race-stratified results.
ThediscrepancythatweobservedintheinfluenceofAPOE
ε4 genotype on dementia risk by race (an ε4 allele increases
risk of dementia in both races but to a greater degree in whites
vs blacks) has been noted in prior investigations, with others
reporting no ε4 influence in blacks.26,27 This result is in con-
trast to our group’
s recent findings in a subset of ARIC partici-
pants who underwent amyloid positron emission tomogra-
phy, among whom the influence of APOE on amyloid
deposition was similar in blacks and in whites.28 Understand-
ing the role of APOE in blacks is critical if future treatment or
prevention studies are to identify potential candidates for AD-
specific therapies on the basis of the most widely recognized
risk factors, including APOE. Race-specific inclusion criteria
may need to be considered in future treatment trials.
Participants with lower educational attainment had more
dementia in this study, as reported in prior investigations.29
These results support our group’
s previous hypothesis30 that
less educated participants, with lower baseline cognitive per-
formance, would more easily and quickly fall below a thresh-
old under which dementia might be identified, thus leading
to more cases of dementia. We did not find a statistically dif-
ferentinfluenceofeducationalattainmentondementiabysex,
as reported previously.31
Limitations
Although attempts were made to minimize missed cases of de-
mentia, the accuracy of review for Level 2 or Level 3 assess-
ment was not as good as that for Level 1 cases, in whom com-
pletein-personneuropsychologicalassessmentwithinformant
interview and expert review took place. Therefore, some cases
found through TICSm or through informant interview may be
incorrectly identified; it is even more likely that cases identi-
fied only through hospitalization codes for dementia may be
incorrect or may be more frequent in individuals with a greater
number of vascular comorbidities. If vascular risk factors are
overrepresentedinhospitalizedindividuals,riskfactorandde-
mentia associations might be exaggerated. However, our lo-
gistic regression sensitivity analysis that excluded hospital-
izedcasesshowsresultssimilartothoseoftheprimaryanalysis,
as does the analysis that excluded interim strokes, reducing
the likelihood of this type of bias. Misclassified cases, if nu-
merous, might lead to an underestimation of associations be-
tween vascular risk factors and dementia. Furthermore, be-
cause of the limited information available through Level 2 and
Level 3, we were not able to evaluate mild cognitive impair-
ment in this complete cohort or etiology of dementia given the
range of sources of information to identify dementia. We also
note that our estimates of onset dates are not precise, particu-

 larly without a clear date of when individuals were last known
to be cognitively normal. It is likely that some participants had
an onset years before a diagnosis was made; we conserva-
tivelysubtracted6monthsfromestimateddiagnosesmadevia
Level 2 or Level 3 and incorporated several sensitivity analy-
ses, including a discrete time analysis that allowed for bin-
ning of dementia diagnoses into 5-year intervals. Finally, we
acknowledge that, as with any observational study, our re-
sults might be susceptible to residual confounding. Some risk
factors are more prevalent among persons of lower socioeco-
nomicstatus,andadjustmentforeducationalattainmentisun-
likely to capture that potential confounding completely. Al-
though our models included the primary vascular risk factors
and demographics together, we did not evaluate medication
use, nor did we consider trajectories of risk factors during
follow-up. Treatment of modifiable risk factors is likely to in-
fluence outcomes, but we did not test the role of medications
in the observed associations.
We focused on midlife vascular risk factors based on prior
observations, including in our group’
s investigations using de-
mentia hospitalization codes,11 that midlife status is more im-
portant than later-life status of these risk factors in subse-
quent brain aging. Our age-stratified analyses showed that
associations tended to be stronger in individuals at earlier
midlife (44-54 years), emphasizing the heightened impor-
tance of vascular risk at earlier ages. These age-stratified re-
sults also demonstrate a sufficient number of dementia cases,
all of whom were younger than 80 years at the time of visit 5,
to still show strong associations. Furthermore, trials focusing
on treating vascular disease in late-life have been unsuccess-
ful in reducing dementia,32 thus underscoring the impor-
tance of identifying a period in midlife when risk is increased
but dementia prevention may be possible.
Conclusions
A primary goal of the ARIC-NCS is to evaluate the role of vas-
cular disease in subsequent development of dementia. This
study points to the importance of midlife vascular risk fac-
tors, including smoking, diabetes, prehypertension, and
hypertension, in later-life development of dementia and
identifies disparities in dementia rates, with higher rates
among blacks than among whites. Vascular risk factors
are modifiable, and their association with dementia empha-
sizes that many cases of dementia may be prevented or
delayed. Future studies need to evaluate the mechanism of
this racial disparity in dementia rates and assess subclinical
vascular disease (systemic and cerebrovascular) as a risk fac-
tor for dementia.
