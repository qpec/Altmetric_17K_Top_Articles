ABSTRACT
With
an
average
male
body
mass
of
320 kg,
the
wapiti,
Cervus canadensis, is the largest extant species of Old World deer
(Cervinae). Despite this large body size, male wapiti produce whistle-
like sexual calls called bugles characterised by an extremely high
fundamental frequency. Investigations of the biometry and physiology
of the male wapiti’s relatively large larynx have so far failed to account
for the production of such a high fundamental frequency. Our
examination of spectrograms of male bugles suggested that the
complex harmonic structure is best explained by a dual-source model
(biphonation), with one source oscillating at a mean of 145 Hz (F0)
and the other oscillating independently at an average of 1426 Hz
(G0). A combination of anatomical investigations and acoustical
modelling indicated that the F0 of male bugles is consistent with the
vocal fold dimensions reported in this species, whereas the
secondary, much higher source at G0 is more consistent with an
aerodynamic whistle produced as air flows rapidly through a narrow
supraglottic constriction. We also report a possible interaction
between the higher frequency G0 and vocal tract resonances, as
G0 transiently locks onto individual formants as the vocal tract is
extended. We speculate that male wapiti have evolved such a dual-
source phonation to advertise body size at close range (with a
relatively low-frequency F0 providing a dense spectrum to highlight
size-related information contained in formants) while simultaneously
advertising their presence over greater distances using the very high-
amplitude G0 whistle component.

INTRODUCTION
Variation in body size explains a substantial proportion of the
acoustic diversity of animal vocalisations (Morton, 1977; Ohala,
1984; Fitch and Hauser, 1995, 2002; Fletcher, 2004). Indeed, most
vocal signals are produced and shaped by oscillators and/or
resonators, and because larger species typically have larger
oscillators or resonators, they tend to produce sounds with lower
frequencies than smaller species (Hauser, 1993; Fletcher, 2004). In
terrestrial mammals, the relationship between body size and the
frequency characteristic of vocal signals can be predicted from the
source–filter theory of vocal production (Fant, 1960; Taylor and
Reby, 2010). The source–filter theory explicitly links production
mechanisms to acoustic output by stating that mammal vocalisations
are generated in a two-stage process, involving an oscillator as the
sound source (typically the vocal folds in the larynx) and a resonator
as the sound filter (the supra-laryngeal vocal tract) (Fant, 1960;
Titze, 1994; Fitch, 1997; Taylor and Reby, 2010). Accordingly,
because larger animals are expected to possess larger larynges with
longer vocal folds and a longer vocal tract, they are also expected to
produce vocalisations with lower fundamental frequency (F0) and
vocal tract resonances (or formants).
Although this general rule of acoustic allometry is broadly
verified across mammalian species (for example, human F0 and
formants are much higher than elephant F0 and formants; McComb
et al., 2003; Bachorowski and Owren, 1999), several exceptions are
documented: for instance, some species have evolved anatomical
innovations that enable them to produce abnormally low F0, such as
the fleshy vocal pads of roaring cats (Panthera sp.) and Mongolian
gazelle, Procapra gutturosa (Frey and Gebler, 2003; Titze et al.,
2010); hypertrophied larynges in howler monkeys, Alouatta sp.
(Dunn et al., 2015; Kelemen and Sade, 1960), and hammer-headed
bats, Hypsignathus monstrosus (Bradbury, 1977); and even an
additional, non-laryngeal set of vocal folds (termed ‘velar vocal
folds’) in the koala, Phascolarctos cinereus (Charlton et al., 2013).
Other species produce abnormally low formants for their size by
extending their vocal tracts using descended and/or mobile larynges
(red deer, Cervus elaphus, Reby and McComb, 2003; fallow deer,
Dama dama, McElligott et al., 2006; Mongolian gazelle, Procapra
gutturosa, Frey et al., 2008; goitred gazelle, Gazella subgutturosa,
Frey et al., 2011; koala, Charlton et al., 2011; roaring cats, Panthera
sp., Weissengruber et al., 2002), air sacs (black and white colobus
monkey, Colobus guereza, Harris et al., 2006) and nasal proboscises
(African elephant, Loxodonta africana, McComb et al., 2003; saiga,
Saiga t. tatarica, Frey et al., 2007; elephant seals, Mirounga
leonina, Sanvito et al., 2007). These anatomical adaptations are
thought to evolve via selection pressures for individuals to lower
frequency
components,
either
to
broadcast
an
exaggerated
impression of their body size in reproductive contexts or to
maximise signal propagation in the species’ natural environment
(koala, Charlton et al., 2011, 2013; red deer, Fitch and Reby, 2001;
Reby and McComb, 2003; fallow deer, Vannoni and McElligott,
2008; bison, Bison bison, Wyman et al., 2012). In contrast, some
animal species, such as sika deer, Cervus nippon (Minami and
Kawamichi, 1992), appear to have evolved the ability to produce
relatively higher pitched vocalisations than expected for their body
size. Possibly the most extreme example of this is found in the
wapiti or North American elk (Cervus canadensis).

 is the largest extant species of Old World deer (Cervinae) (Geist,
1999). Despite their large body size, male North American wapiti
are known to produce extremely high-pitched, whistle-like rutting
calls called bugles (Murie, 1932, 1951; Feighny et al., 2006). The
frequency of the ‘whistle’ component of adult male bugles can reach
above 2000 Hz (Feighny et al., 2006), which is in principle
incompatible with the vocal fold length of adult males reported in
this species (∼34 mm; Riede and Titze, 2008). In addition,
investigations of the biometry, physiology and biomechanical
properties of the wapiti larynx, vocal folds and vocal tract have so
far failed to identify any specific anatomical specialisations capable
of producing such high-pitched vocalisations (Riede and Titze,
2008; Titze and Riede, 2010; Frey and Riede, 2013).
In the present study, we examined narrowband spectrograms
from high-quality recordings to reveal previously undocumented
complexity in the spectral composition of male wapiti bugles. We
then combined several complementary approaches, including
detailed acoustic analyses and modelling, as well as video and
anatomical investigations, to investigate the possible acoustic
sources and mechanisms involved in the production of bugles,
examine their acoustic properties, and shed light on the possible
functions of the different components of these calls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Video analyses of calling behaviour
To characterise calling behaviour (posture and movements), we
examined videos of rutting males from three different populations/
subspecies: 32 bugles from six males of Rocky Mountain wapiti
(Cervus canadensis nelsoni) filmed in Yellowstone National Park,
Wyoming, USA, and Jasper, Alberta, Canada, and 10 bugles from
three males of Tule wapiti (Cervus canadensis nannodes) filmed
in Point Reyes, California, USA. We documented the major
observable changes in mouth and nostril movements that occurred
during male bugles, and extracted still images from one video of a
Rocky Mountain wapiti to illustrate how these changes coincide
with the main acoustic events in a bugle. This allowed us to then
predict which muscles were likely to be driving any mouth and
nostril movements that were observed.
Audio recordings of male bugles
We recorded four adult male wapiti kept in captivity at two deer
farms in New Zealand, including two pure-bred Manitoban wapitis
aged 8 and 12 years, a 6-year-old pure-bred wapiti of unknown
subspecies, and a 9-year-old wapiti (Manitoban×Rocky Mountain
wapiti mix) and red deer hybrid (>90% wapiti). Breeding records or
existing genetic analysis were used to ascertain the genetic status of
all four animals. All vocalisations were recorded at distances of 20
to 50 m, using a Rode NTG-3 shotgun directional microphone
connected to a Fostex FR-2 LE 2-Channel Compact Flash field
recorder. Bugles were recorded at 32-bit amplitude resolution,
48 kHz frequency resolution, and saved as uncompressed .wav files.
Bugles were extracted from the original recording sequences using
Cool Edit Pro 2.0 (Syntrillium) sound editing software. A total of 42
bugles (10 or 11 recordings per individual) were included in the
subsequent acoustic analyses.
Acoustic analyses
All acoustic analyses were conducted using the Praat DSP package
(Boersma and Weenink, 2005). Call duration was measured directly
from the waveform. Calls were then visualised and analysed
using narrowband spectrograms (window length=0.03–0.1 s; time
step=0.01 s; frequency step=250; frequency resolution=20 Hz;
dynamic
range=70–90 dB;
Gaussian
window
shape).
Initial
inspection of narrowband spectrograms revealed two clear and
independently varying periodicities. The lower periodical source is
hereafter referred to as F0, and the higher periodical source is
referred to as G0. All non-automatically extracted variables were
measured (for the entire dataset) by two independent observers
(D.R. and D.P.). Agreement for these measures ranged between
94% and 100% for qualitative variables and between 96% and
100% for quantitative variables.
F0 and G0
To measure F0 variation, a pulse-detection-based pitch analysis was
used (Voice Report command in Praat). A low-pass filter (upper limit
set between 600 and 900 Hz) was applied to each recording before
running the pulse-detection-based pitch extraction to remove most of
the G0 component. This considerably improved the accuracy and
efficacy of F0 detection. Extracted F0 measures were systematically
checked against narrowband spectrograms and the following F0-
related acoustic parameters were measured: F0mean (the average
value of F0), F0min (the minimum value of F0) and F0max (the
maximum value of F0). Because both pulse detection (Voice Report
command) and cross-correlation (To Pitch command) automated
algorithms failed to reliably detect G0 automatically (because of the
presence of the lower F0), we estimated G0 parameters directly from
narrowband spectrograms using the screen cursor. We measured the
followingG0-relatedparametersforeach call: G0start (the onset value
of G0), G0max (the maximum value of G0, generally corresponding
to the value of the plateau) and G0end (the final value of G0). We also
noted whether G0 tracked at least one of the formant frequencies
(visually identified on spectrograms as sections where G0 stabilises
within/tracks the value of a formant frequency). Finally, we also
documented the presence of non-linear phenomena, including
deterministic chaos, subharmonics and biphonation, from visual
examinations of the narrowband spectrogram. Biphonation, the
presence of two independent fundamental frequencies (or pitches;
Herzel et al., 1994) produced by a single source or separate sources, is
visualised
on
narrowband
spectrograms
as two
independent
frequencies that are not harmonically related (e.g. Wilden et al.,
1998). If one source (F0) vibrates at a much lower frequency than the
other (G0), because the airflow is then modulated by the frequency
difference,
biphonation
leads to visible
sidebands
at
linear
combinations of F0 and G0 (mG0±nF0, where m and n are
integers) (Nowicki and Capranica, 1986; Wilden et al., 1998;
Zollinger et al., 2008). This is equivalent to considering that the
lower F0 amplitude-modulates the higher frequency G0 (carrier
frequency) (Gerhardt, 1998).
Minimum formant frequencies
Minimum
formant
frequencies
were
measured
using
the
methodology described by Reby and McComb (2003). To estimate
the formant frequencies at full vocal tract extension, we used
narrowband spectrograms to identify the region within each bugle
where the formant frequencies were minimal and stable (minimum
duration of 0.2 s). We then extracted a power spectrum of this region
(a spectral slice in Praat) and performed cepstral smoothing
(bandwidth between 100 and 200 Hz) to derive the centre
frequencies of the first eight formants. We carefully checked that
the first eight formants had frequencies below that of the G0 whistle
component at the point of measure, to ensure that this spectral
component was not mistaken foraformant frequency. Formant values
were estimated manually from spectrographic representations in a
total of 10 cases when the above analysis returned formant values that

 did not correspond closely to those derived from the cepstral
smoothing. We then estimated formant frequency spacing, and
corresponding apparent vocal tract length (aVTL), using the linear
regression method of Reby and McComb (2003).
Relative amplitude of source components
The relative amplitude of source components was examined by
comparing the sound pressure level (SPL; in dB) of F0 and G0, as
well as the SPL of the strongest harmonic of these sources (termed
domF and domG), regardless of its place in the harmonic series. We
extracted an instantaneous spectrum (View Spectral Slice command
in Praat) from the middle of each vocalisation and measured the SPL
of F0, G0, domF and domG using the screen cursor (see Fig. S1).
The relative difference in SPL between the two sources was then
estimated by subtracting the SPL of F0 from that of G0 and the SPL
of domF from that of domG.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted using R software (R
Development Core Team, 2008). Inter-individual differences in
the acoustic variables between the four males were tested within a
multivariate ANOVA ([manova] command in ‘stats’ library)
followed
by
single
ANOVAs
to
summarise
and
test
the
contribution of each variable to the model ([summary.aov]
command in ‘stats’ library). Correlations between duration,
MeanF0 and aVTL (predictors, nested within male ID) and
MaxG0 (outcome variable) were tested using linear mixed-effects
models ([lme] command in ‘nlme’ library).
Anatomical investigations
Although the general anatomy of the wapiti larynx and the histology
of its vocal fold are documented (Riede and Titze, 2008; Frey and
Riede, 2013), we combined imaging and dissection techniques to
provide additional anatomical details and measurements relevant to
the vocal production hypotheses developed in the present study. To
this effect, a 7.5-year-old captive male wapiti from Park la Haute
Touche, France, that had been euthanised as part of the park’s
population management procedures was dissected. The specimen was
frozen post mortem, stored at −18°C for 6 months, and subsequently
thawed before computerised tomography (CT scan) imaging and
dissection at the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique
(INRA), Tours, France (by D.R. and Y.L.). To CT scan the specimen
in a ‘calling posture’, the vocal tract was artificially extended by
maximally pulling the trachea down and fastening it to the sternum.
The CT scans were performed on a SIEMENS Biograph 64 slice
scanner with a 0.6 mm slice thickness on a pitch of 0.9 mm.
Contiguous 0.6 mm slices were displayed with a 512×512 pixel
matrix, with reconstructions performed with a ‘B20s smooth’ filter.
All CT scans were displayed on a 512×512 pixel matrix and the field
of view was varied according to the size of the wapiti’s head. Because
of damage affecting the base of the skull, we were only able to
perform basic measurements of the vocal tract dimensions.
The excised larynx, including the pharynx, and the nasal region of
the skull were re-frozen at −18°C and sent from INRA to the Leibniz
Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW), Berlin, Germany, for
dissection in water (by R.F.). This allowed us to perform detailed
examinations and measurements of the most relevant anatomical
structures (sensu Frey et al., 2007, 2008, 2011). Dissections were
conducted layer-by-layer using a head loupe, and all stages of the
dissection were documented using a Nikon DS70 digital photo
camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and stored on a Compact Flash card.
The images were subsequently downloaded to a PC and graphically
processed (Adobe Photoshop 5.5 and CS4; Adobe Systems, San Jose,
CA, USA) to identify the individual components of the larynx, the
soft palate, the nasal vestibulum and the remaining parts of the hyoid
apparatus. Finally, to investigate the possible configuration of the
laryngeal structures during phonation, the effect of the constriction of
the larynx by the caudal pharyngeal constrictors was simulated by
moderately fastening a plastic strap transversely around the larynx.
The dimensions of the resulting narrow opening between the vocal
folds and its distance from the intra-pharyngeal ostium were then
measured.
RESULTS
General behaviour, posture and gesture
Examination of video recordings showed that male wapitis extend
their neck and lower their larynx during vocalisations; however, the
actual extent of vocal tract extension was difficult to establish because
the neck mane concealed the lowest point of laryngeal retraction.
Vapour expelled during vocalisations and flank movements indicated
that bugles are produced during exhalation, and the larynx is rapidly
pulled towards the sternum at the onset of the vocalisation, before
rising again to its resting position at the end of the call. The mouth is
kept open during the vocalisation, whereas the upper lips are curled
upwards and the nostrils are moved backwards in a posture
reminiscent of flehmen behaviour (Fig. 1). Backward nostril

 movements are closely aligned with the production of G0 during the
bugle and subsequent yelps when present (Fig. 1).
Acoustics
Fundamental frequencies (F0 and G0)
Examination of narrowband spectrograms suggests that the
complex harmonic structure of these vocalisations is best
described as a dual-fundamental frequency signal, with a lower
fundamental frequency (F0) in the 76–250 Hz range (mean±s.d.:
145.1±15.2 Hz) and a higher fundamental frequency (G0) in the
145–4187 Hz
range
(mean±s.d.:
1426.4±558.9 Hz;
Fig.
2,
Table 1). These two simultaneous and independent periodicities
are clearly visible in all 42 calls. We also report sidebands at
mG0±nF0 consistent with the amplitude modulation of G0 by
F0 (Fig. 2). It is clear from visual examination of spectrograms
from all four stags that G0 and F0 are not harmonically related
(Figs 2 and 3A, and see legend of Fig. 2 for calculation of G0/F0
ratios illustrating the absence of harmonic relationship), vary
independently (sometimes even in opposite directions, see
Fig. 3B) and can be produced in the absence of each other (e.g.
Fig. 3B). In addition, the ratio of G0max over F0max is not an
integer and is highly variable both between calls (ranging between
8.7 and 26.2) and between individuals (Table 1), confirming the
observation that F0 and G0 are not harmonically related and
therefore correspond to biphonation. Finally, we observed that the
G0 component appeared before the formant frequencies reached
their minimum value in 33 out of 42 bugles, indicating that full
vocal tract extension was not required for the production of G0.
Our comparison of the amplitude of the sources revealed that G0
was typically 11.3 dB higher than F0, corresponding to 2.2 times the
loudness (to the human ear) and 13.5 times the acoustic intensity, as
measured by median values of relative amplitude differences at the
middle point of the bugles. Furthermore, the strongest harmonic of
G0 (domG) was typically 7.7 dB higher than the strongest harmonic
of F0 (domF), corresponding to 1.7 times the loudness (to the
human ear) and 5.9 times the acoustic intensity. The strongest
harmonic of the F0 source component ranged from the first to the
sixteenth harmonic (median of 3rd harmonic) while the first
harmonic was the strongest harmonic in the G0 source component
for all calls except two. Finally, subharmonics related to the lower
source F0 and deterministic chaos were present in 57% and 71% of
the analysed calls, respectively.
The overall acoustic structure of bugles differed significantly
between the four individuals (MANOVA, F3,38=64, P<0.001).
Protected ANOVAs revealed that all acoustic variables related to F0
and G0 differed significantly between individuals (Table 1). Linear
mixed models showed that the relationships between G0max and
duration, mean F0 or aVTL were not significant within individuals
(duration: F1,35=0.34, P=0.561; F0mean: F1,35=1.54; P=0.222;
aVTL: F1,35=0.14, P=0.704).
Formant frequencies
The spectrally dense harmonic stack associated with the low F0
results in broadband excitation of the vocal tract transfer function in
all bugles, so that clearly defined formant frequencies are observed.
Formants drop at the beginning of the bugle and reach a minimum
plateau, characteristic of the vocal tract extension already identified
in red deer stags (Reby and McComb, 2003) and fallow deer
bucks (McElligott et al., 2006), and consistent with the laryngeal
movements observed in the videos of bugling male wapitis.
Analysis of the formants from the recorded vocalisations indicates
that the minimum formant spacing averages 222±7.8 Hz (mean±
s.d.), corresponding to a 79±2.8 cm (mean±s.d.) maximum aVTL at
full extension. Maximum aVTL ranged between 77.7 and 82.5 cm
and was not significantly different between individuals (F3,38=2.7,
P=0.07).
Source–filter interactions
Examination
of
spectrograms
also
indicated
that
G0
is
characterised by a stepwise increase in the first part of the
vocalisation (termed the ‘on-glide’ in Feighny et al., 2006), with
segments where G0 clearly ‘locks’ into formant frequencies: G0
transiently drops as formants decrease, until it ‘jumps’ to the next
higher formant (see Figs 2 and 3A–C). This phenomenon was
observed in all of the calls.
Anatomy
Larynx
The features inside the laryngeal cavity, including the relaxed
vocal fold, are presented in Fig. 4A. Macroscopic examination of
the vocal folds did not reveal any specialisations for high-
frequency production, such as a vocal membrane (bats: Griffin,
1958; Suthers and Fattu, 1973; Griffiths, 1978; Hartley and
Suthers, 1988; Suthers, 1988; primates: Brown and Cannito, 1995;
Schön-Ybarra, 1995, see Mergell et al., 1999 for a study
modelling the role of vocal membranes in phonation). The
specimen had an average (left and right combined) dorsoventral
vocal fold length of 34.7 mm. The maximal rostrocaudal length of
the vocal fold was 10 mm, the maximal transverse width 4 mm.

independent fundamental frequencies, a high-frequency G0 (hypothesised to
be a laryngeal or a nasal aerodynamic source) and a lower-frequency F0
(hypothesised to be a laryngeal biomechanic source) are unambiguously
present on the spectrogram. G0 and F0 are not harmonically related, as
demonstrated by the fact that the ratio of G0/F0 is not a constant integer. This
ratio changes from 1614/117 Hz=13.8 at 0.5 s into the bugle to 2707/
212 Hz=12.8 at 2 s, and 1210/155 Hz=7.8 at 2.8 s. Sidebands resulting from
the amplitude modulation of G0 by F0 are present at linear combinations of G0
and F0 (here visible at G0±nF0). For example, at 2 s into the call, sidebands
are present at 2707−212 Hz=2495 Hz and 2707+212 Hz=2919 Hz. Neither
are integer multiples of F0 and therefore they are not harmonically related to
F0. The glottal source and its harmonics highlight the transfer function of the
supralaryngeal vocal tract. Formants are lowered as the vocal tract is extended.
Rising G0 transiently locks into successive descending formants until it
reaches a maximum, modal value around 3 kHz.

 a consequence, the application of external constriction to the
thyroid laminae would be expected to cause a close approximation
of the arytenoids’ corniculate processes and a profound narrowing
of the laryngeal vestibulum.
Vocal tract
The oral vocal tract length (measured externally after skinning of
the specimen as the distance from the laryngeal prominence to the
lips) was 580 mm at rest and 680 mm at maximal extension when
the trachea was manually pulled in a caudal direction towards the
sternum. The nasal vocal tract length (measured externally after
skinning of the specimen as the distance from the laryngeal
prominence to the nostrils) was 600 mm at rest and 700 mm
extended. The dimensions of the excised and relaxed soft palate
were: 160 mm rostrocaudal length; 57 mm transverse width; and
11 mm dorsoventral thickness, halfway between the choanae and
the larynx, decreasing to 7.5 mm at the rostral edge of the intra-
pharyngeal ostium. The intra-pharyngeal ostium did not display
any
macroscopic
specialisations
for
high-frequency
sound
production. It consisted of a simple oval opening in the soft
palate, measuring 45 mm in maximal rostrocaudal length and
30 mm in maximal transverse width (Fig. 4B,C). The resting
length of the thyrohyoid ligament was 15 mm and could be
maximally extended to 70 mm by pulling the trachea caudally
towards the sternum. After excision of the hyoid apparatus and
larynx, the length of the thyrohyoid ligament at maximal extension
reached 120 mm. Examination of CT multi-planar reconstructions
revealed that the extended oral vocal tract length was 671±2 mm
and the extended nasal vocal tract length was 718±2 mm
(averaged over five measures).
Nostrils
The structure of the nostrils and nasal vestibulum corresponded to
that in other ruminants (see Nickel et al., 1987). The overall resting

 anatomy of the small rostrolateral muscles acting on the nostril is
summarized in Fig. 5A. The rostral ends of the muscular bundles
transformed into small tendons, which further split up into smaller
and smaller tendinous twigs and, ultimately, ramified in the
connective tissue located laterodorsally and lateroventrally to the
nostrils. The small muscles coursed between the median and the
lateral layer of the nasolabial levator muscle. In addition, their small
tendons ran in connective tissue sheaths extending from the muscle
body up to their rostral termination. The tendons of the most
dorsally located small muscles, the left and right levator muscles of
the upper lip, united rostromedially to form an unpaired strong
tendon that terminated in the upper lip (Fig. 5B).
According to its position, course and termination, the levator
muscle of the upper lip appeared to be a major relevant muscle for
the
flehmen-like
upward
curling
of
the
nostril
and
nasal
vestibulum we observed in the videos of calling males. Raising
the dorsal edge of the nostril can be assumed to result from a
concerted action of the following muscles: the nasolabial levator
muscle, the levator muscle of the upper lip, the caninus muscle,
the depressor muscle of the upper lip and the medial dilator
muscle of the nare. Dorsocaudal pull on the upper lip, i.e. curling
of the nasal vestibulum, would bring the rostral tissues closer to
the fusiform alar fold, thereby creating a slit-like narrowing of this
initial portion of the nasal passage.

 DISCUSSION
Examination of narrowband spectrograms from high-quality
recordings revealed that the bugle vocalisations of male wapitis
are characterised by unusual spectral complexity. Acoustic analyses
of the bugles from four adult males suggest that this complexity is
best explained by the involvement of two distinct and independent
sound sources (biphonation), as well as some level of source–filter
interaction. We also show that the higher frequency source (G0) is
characterised by much higher amplitude than the lower frequency
source (F0) in calls recorded at short distance. Below we discuss the
anatomical and acoustical evidence supporting these claims, as well
as the possible biomechanical origins of the bugle’s acoustic
components. We also discuss the possible evolutionary origin of this
highly unusual signal, by reviewing the likely selective advantages
of its acoustic features.
Vocal tract extension
Visual inspection of spectrograms showed that the formant
frequencies (excited by the low-frequency F0 source) were clearly
lowered as a consequence of vocal tract extension during the initial
part of the bugle. The maximum aVTL estimated from formant
frequency spacing was longer, but compatible with the extended
oral or nasal vocal tract length we measured in the dissected adult
male. The ratio of maximum vocal tract length to body length
(maxVTL/BL) in male wapitis (0.329) is similar to that of males in
other species with mobile larynges and extendable vocal tracts, such
as red deer (0.346), fallow deer (0.316) and goitred gazelle (0.365)
(see Table 2 for details). In contrast, species that exhibit a higher
resting position of the larynx and lack pronounced laryngeal
mobility, as is typical for most mammals, have smaller VTL/BL
ratios, e.g. sika deer (0.200), North American bison (0.147) and
reindeer, Rangifer tarandus (0.186) (Table 2). Combined with
anatomical and video observations, these VTL/BL ratios indicate
that wapiti males are extending the vocal tract during call
production.
Biphonation
We identified biphonation (Neubauer et al., 2004) in all of the
analysed bugles, irrespective of the subspecies and genetic profile of
the four stag exemplars. Biphonation also appears to be present in
the published spectrograms of ‘aggressive’ male bugles as well as
both ‘non-aggressive’ and ‘aggressive’ female bugles recorded from
free-ranging wapitis in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado,
USA (see figs 2 and 3 from Feighny et al., 2006). In the present
study, we observed two very clear and independent fundamental
frequencies in male bugles: F0 ranged between 76 and 250 Hz, and
G0 ranged between 145 and 4187 Hz. These two frequencies are not
harmonically related and vary independently (sometimes even in
opposite directions). In addition, F0 and G0 are sometimes observed
separately in spectrograms, i.e. in the absence of the other, and each
has its own stack of harmonic overtones (see Fig. 3A,B). Taken
together, these findings strongly indicate that F0 and G0 involve
distinct mechanisms of production. We were also able to identify
very clear sidebands at mG0±nF0, as predicted by the amplitude
modulation of the higher G0 (carrier) by the lower F0 in the
presence of biphonic sources (Gerhardt, 1998; Wilden et al., 1998).
These sidebands have been mistaken for harmonics in previous
literature (Feighny et al., 2006), despite the fact that they are not
harmonically related to F0 (as harmonics of G0 would only be
found at integer multiples of its initial frequency).
The high-pitch whistle is inconsistent with laryngeal vocal
fold oscillation
Previous empirical and theoretical work on the wapiti has shown that
the dimensions and histology of this species’ vocal folds cannot
explain the production of fundamental frequencies higher than
1.4 kHz (Riede and Titze, 2008; Titze and Riede, 2010). It has been
postulated that frequencies above this could be produced by a
reduction of effective vocal fold length in vibration (Riede and Titze,
2008), thereby exposing a smaller mid-membranous portion of the
vocal folds to a high-impedance air flow facilitated by an unusually
narrow laryngeal vestibulum (Frey and Riede, 2013). Nevertheless,
because the simultaneous production of low- and high-frequency
components by decoupled oscillations of a single anatomical entity,
the vocal folds, is highly improbable, we suggest that laryngeal vocal
fold oscillation is unlikely to explain the production of both of these
spectral features. Instead, a more likely explanation is that the
laryngeal vocal folds produce F0, whereas G0 is achieved either by
an additional biomechanic source oscillating at a different frequency
(Neubauer et al., 2004) or by an aerodynamic source.
Our anatomical investigations revealed a vocal fold length of
approximately 35 mm, which accords well with previously reported
male vocal fold lengths of 34 mm (Riede and Titze, 2008). These
dimensions are also broadly comparable with vocal fold length in
Scottish red deer (Cervus elaphus scoticus) stags (27 mm, Titze and
Riede, 2010; 36 mm, R.F., M.T.W. and D.R., unpublished data). It is
therefore not surprising that the fundamental frequencies (F0) of
wapiti bugles documented in the present study are also comparable
with that of European red deer stags (Scottish red deer: 107 Hz, Reby
and McComb, 2003; Iberian red deer: 186 Hz, Frey et al., 2012;
181 Hz, Passilongo et al., 2013). In fact, when the high-frequency
G0 is filtered out using a low-pass filter, thewapiti bugle sounds very
similar to a red deer roar. Fig. 6 also illustrates how the biometric
(vocal fold length) and acoustic (F0 and G0) features that we report

 for the bugles of male wapitis compare with that of 14 other mammal
species. It is clear that while F0 follows the documented co-variation
of vocal fold length and mean F0 across this sample of mammalian
species, G0 is far higher than the frequency predicted for a 34 mm
vocal fold. As a consequence, the extremely high G0, which reaches
values over 3000 Hz in 55% of calls and even 4153 Hz in one of our
recordings, is clearly inconsistent with the dimensions of the vocal
folds reported for this species.
Furthermore, our dissections confirm previous studies that failed
to identify any anatomical specialisation in the wapiti’s upper vocal
tract or larynx that could support periodic oscillations at frequencies
of 2 to 4 kHz (Riede and Titze, 2008; Frey and Riede, 2013).
Although the posterior edge of the velum at the level of the intra-
pharyngeal ostium may act as a biomechanical valve if pressed
against the dorsal wall of the nasopharynx (resembling the
configuration
in
very
high-pitched
snoring;
Auregan
and
Depollier, 1995), the relatively large dimensions of the soft palate
(velum) are unlikely to support such high-frequency oscillation,
unless tissue tension was extreme. Hence, we suggest that the high-
frequency G0 component of wapiti bugles is more likely to be
produced
by
an
independent
aerodynamic,
rather
than
a
biomechanic, source.
An aerodynamic whistle?
Two main types of aerodynamic whistles can be produced by vocal
tract constrictions. (1) Vortex-induced whistles can be produced
when a flow of air is forced through a narrow constriction (usually
coupled with a Helmholtz resonator) such as the lips and the oral
cavity in human whistling. (2) Flute-like whistles can be produced
when a flow of air forced through a narrow constriction ( jet) impacts
a labium (see Fabre et al., 2012). Video footage shows that vapour is
exhaled at a reduced rate through the mouth during bugling before a
much larger volume of vapour is expelled at the end of the
vocalisation. This pattern of vapour exhalation is compatible with a
reduced flow of air caused by a strong supra-laryngeal constriction
during the production of the bugle that would be required to cause
the high pressure necessary for the production of an aerodynamic
whistle. Below, we discuss two possible production mechanisms for
an aerodynamic whistle that accord with our observations in the
present study.
We noticed that the occurrence and modulations of G0 were
typically accompanied by characteristic nostril movements. By
muscular pulling on the upper lip, i.e. dorsal curling of the nasal
vestibulum, the animal could bring the rostral tissues closer to the
fusiform alar fold to create a slit-like narrowing of this initial
portion of the nasal passage (Fig. 7). This constriction could then
support the production of a vortex-induced whistle, with the
nasopharyngeal vocal tract acting as an acoustical resonator.
However, given that the mammalian vocal tract comprises two
nostrils, one might expect more occurrence of tri-phonation with
one vocal fold-related F0 and two nostril-related G0s. While tri-
phonation is clearly observed in one of the recorded calls
(Fig. 3C), the inherent lateral symmetry of each nostril and
associated nasal cavities, as well as the fact that effective
respiration requires a high synchronisation between the left and
right nostrils and the nasal vocal tracts, may explain the apparent
singularity of the G0 periodicity. This apparent singularity may
also be accentuated by synchronisation phenomena such as that
observed between adjacent organ pipes (Abel et al., 2006).
An alternative aerodynamic source could involve a supraglottic
constriction and the intra-pharyngeal ostium: when the vocal tract
is extended by the muscular retraction of the larynx, the soft palate
(velum) is considerably stretched longitudinally and its rostral edge
could act as a labium, generating a flute-like whistle, coupled with
the oral and/or nasal vocal tracts, and subsequently radiated via the
oral cavity and/or nostrils (Figs 8, 9). The fundamental frequency
of such whistles can be predicted as a function of the velocity of
the air at the level of the constriction, the diameter of the
constriction, and the distance between the constriction and the
labium. Using measures from CT scans of the extended vocal tract
obtained from one adult male and confirmed from dissections, we
were able to estimate a whistling frequency of 3270 Hz (see
Appendix for the calculation of this estimate, including the source
of the various parameters entered in the model), which is of the
same magnitude as the maximum (and modal) G0 frequency
measured in the males in this and another published study
(Feighny et al., 2006), as well as with the value of G0 (1855 Hz)
measured in a bugle recorded from the specimen (M. Garcia,
personal
communication).
Although
the
occurrence
of
triphonation in one of the recorded bugles goes against the
hypothesis of a unique laryngeal whistle source, we consider that
this unique occurrence is insufficient to completely exclude this
hypothesis.
Although we do not provide decisive evidence that either of the
above mechanisms is responsible for the observed high-frequency
component of the wapiti bugle, both hypotheses constitute
plausible alternatives to the unlikely involvement of laryngeal
vocal fold vibration. Furthermore, examination of spectrograms
shows that a clear source–filter interaction occurs in wapiti bugles
(Figs 2, 3). The observed locking of G0 onto the descending
formant frequencies (as the vocal tract is extended) is compatible

 with a feedback mechanism of the vocal tract on the source
generating the whistle. Indeed, while some animals (including
humans) appear to tune F0 onto a formant, or vice versa (e.g. ring
doves: Riede et al., 2004; songbirds: Riede et al., 2006; gibbons:
Koda et al., 2012; sopranos: Sundberg, 1975, 1979), the clear
modulation of a source by a resonance, as observed here, has not
been previously reported for putative biomechanic laryngeal
sources (despite being predicted by simulations using a model
of vocal fold tissue vibration based on morphological and
biomechanical features of the wapiti vocal apparatus, if the
impedance of the source and the impedance of the vocal tract were
comparable; Titze and Riede, 2010). However, strong coupling is
widely expected in aerodynamic sources (Fabre et al., 2012),
lending further credence to the hypothesis that G0 represents an
aerodynamic, rather than biomechanic, source. Interestingly, the
locking/jumping of G0 onto specific resonances is also highly
reminiscent of the behaviour of flute-like musical instruments
(Fabre and Hirschberg, 2000).
Function and evolution
Previous functional interpretations of the extremely high G0 of male
bugles have focused on increased glottal efficiency: at given
laryngeal size, high G0 may optimise glottal efficiency as well as
acoustic radiation through a small orifice (see Titze and Riede,
2010). Whistle elements within bugles may also function to encode
quality if whistle pitch correlates with the caller’s size or strength
and is held reliable by a physical constraint or production cost. For
example, F0 is expected to increase directly with flow velocity in
both vortex and flute-like whistles (Terrien et al., 2013). As a
consequence, male wapitis that are capable of producing higher G0
may advertise stronger muscles or higher lung capacities to
receivers, allowing G0 to function as an index of physical quality,
condition or motivational state in inter- and intra-selection contexts.
Indeed, the value and duration of G0 may combine to advertise a
given male’s current physical condition through his ability to
regularly sustain a long and high-pitched whistle. Biometric and
acoustic investigations in wild ranging populations, as well as
playback experiments in inter- and intra-sexual selection contexts,
are now required to determine the information content of the G0
component of male bugles, and the functional relevance of any
potential information.
Although high frequencies tend to propagate less efficiently
than low frequencies in uniform media (Wiley and Richards, 1978),
the very high-frequency G0 component is produced with a
considerably higher amplitude than the glottal source F0, and
may be more resilient to ground interference or low-frequency
environmental
noise.
This
might
explain
why
F0-related
components went largely unnoticed by previous researchers, and
why only the whistle is audible at medium and long distances (D.R.
and R.F., unpublished data). Propagation experiments in a wide
range of habitats (in terms of topography and vegetation) and
atmospheric conditions are now required to contrast the propagation
of F0- versus G0-related components and information.
High-pitched sexual calls have evolved independently in at least
one other species of Cervinae: the sika deer. However, the high-

nostrils (G0 production). (A) Flehmen-like gesture of the muzzle and nostrils
during production of a bugle. (B) Constriction of the rostral end of the nasal
vocal tract by pulling at the tendon of the levator muscles of the upper lip. The
rostral portion of the straight fold, the membranous portion of the nasal septum
and the flexible nasal vestibulum form a sort of funnel into which the conical
rostral tip of the alar fold tightly fits. Thereby, the connection between the nasal
cavity and the nasal vestibulum is pronouncedly narrowed to an obliquely
oriented slit. This constriction might be the site of a high-frequency, vortex-
induced whistle (G0 production) involving the nasopharyngeal vocal tract as an
acoustical resonator. (C) Upper lip, nasal vestibulum and nostril relaxed as
during quiet breathing. Release of the constriction allows unrestricted
inspiration and expiration along the alar fold, which is supported by the medial
accessory cartilage of the nose. The asterisks indicate the position of the
unpaired rostral tendon of the levator muscles of the upper lip in A–C. The
small white arrow in A points to the narrow, slit-like rostral opening of the ventral
nasal duct. The one-headed blue arrow in B indicates restrained phonatory

 pitched howls and moans of sika deer males are not produced by an
additional source as in the biphonation of wapitis, but by the vocal
folds (Herbst et al., 2013). As a consequence, sika deer calls lack a
second G0 source but, instead, have a very high F0 (ranging from
196 to 1196 Hz; Minami and Kawamichi, 1992) relative to their
body size. Accordingly, adult male sika deer have much smaller
larynges and shorter vocal folds (∼17 mm; R.F., M.T.W. and D.R.,
unpublished data) that are also very small relative to their body
dimensions. In comparison with wapitis, sika moans and howls
provide an interesting example of convergent evolution of high-
frequency male sexual calls in closely related species.
Evolving a high-amplitude, high-frequency F0 is at the expense
of producing spectrally dense calls that highlight vocal tract
resonances (and where F0 may be an index of male androgens
and associated phenotypical traits). In fact, the high-frequency
portions of sexually selected sika deer male moans do not produce
defined formant frequencies and sika deer do not appear to have
descended larynges or extendible vocal tracts (R.F., M.T.W. and
D.R., unpublished data), possibly because the very high F0 of their
calls precludes the production of clear formant frequencies. In
contrast, male wapitis appear to have evolved a dual mechanism to
escape this constraint: we speculate that wapitis have evolved
biphonation as a means of simultaneously producing a high-
pitched, powerful G0 component, which may function for
advertising presence to females or males over medium to long
distances, while retaining a low F0 component, providing a dense
spectrum
to
clearly
highlight
formants
and
broadcast size
information at close range.
Feighny et al. (2006) report that bugles from free-ranging male
wapitis only contain a low-frequency component in ‘aggressive’
contexts, supporting the contention that the high spectral density
arising from the low F0 vocal fold source functions to facilitate the
expression of body size in close-range male interactions, by
highlighting vocal tract resonances. Interestingly, in another
subspecies of red deer, the Iberian red deer, males give two
distinct types of roars (Frey et al., 2012): short, low-pitched and low-
amplitude common roars, which highlight formant frequencies and
therefore efficiently communicate size-related information at short
Fig. 8. Flute model of G0 production. (A) Overlay of resting position and

model. F0 is produced by oscillation of the vocal folds. Prerequisite for
production of G0 is a narrowing of the supraglottic airwayso thatan air jet can be
formed. This occurs when the arytenoid cartilages are rocked to tense the vocal
folds for F0 production. Narrowing is enhanced by simultaneous contraction of
the caudal constrictor muscles of the pharynx that press the laminae of the
thyroid cartilage together, thereby compressing the laryngeal vestibulum and

 distance; and longer, higher-pitched and higher-amplitude common
roars, which may advertise stamina and presence over longer
distances (Passilongo et al., 2013). This illustrates how different
species have evolved different solutions to the challenge of
producing signals that are characterised by a dense spectrum (low
F0) and a high amplitude (high G0) with the relatively small
larynges of terrestrial mammals. The emergence of whistle
languages in several human cultures, where whistling takes over
formant-based communication when communicating over long
distances in mountainous environments, also provides a very
interesting convergence (Classe, 1957; Rialland, 2005; Meyer,
2008). We suggest that further studies should investigate which
evolutionary pressures and environmental constraints have led to the
emergence of biphonation (e.g. wild dogs Lycaon pictus: Wilden
et al., 1998; dholes: Volodina et al., 2006; horses: Briefer et al.,
2015) or whistling (e.g. human whistled languages) in vertebrate
vocal communication systems.
Appendix
Are the dimensions of the wapiti’s vocal apparatus
compatible with the production of a flute-like aerodynamic
whistle?
The high-frequency whistle component of the wapiti bugle was
modelled as an acoustical source produced by a flute-like instrument.
Flutes, recorders and flue organ pipes are wind instruments in which
the source is produced by a thin air jet (thickness H) formed by
blowing through a flue channel or a slit. The jet flows across an
openingintheresonator(calledthemouth)towardasharpedge(called
the labium). During steady oscillations, the acoustic standing wave in
the resonator drives an air flux through the mouth of the instrument,
perpendicular to the jet. The acoustic velocity perturbations at the exit
of the flue channel induce a modulation of the vorticity in the shear
layers delimiting the jet. The vorticity perturbation is amplified by
hydrodynamic instability as it is convected toward the labium. The
oscillation of the jet around the labium induces an unsteady
aerodynamic force. The reaction force of the labium on the air is the
source of sound driving the acoustic resonator oscillation. This
feedback loop can be described qualitatively in terms of semi-
empirical lumped models. If the jet velocity is such that there is just
half a wavelength of the transverse disturbance between the flue and
thelabium, thenthe pipewill sound at one of its resonance frequencies
(adapted from Fabre and Hirschberg, 2000).
Here, to assessthe relevance of such a flute-like mechanism for the
production of the bugle’s G0 whistling component, we estimate the
sounding frequency that would be generated by a jet (of velocity Uj)
produced at the level of the supraglottic constriction (of characteristic
size H), and hitting a labium consisting of the tensed velum at the
level of the intra-pharyngeal ostium located at a distance W from the
constriction (see Figs 8, 9). To do this, we calculate a value for the jet
velocity Uj based on an estimation of the wapiti’s lung capacity, the
average duration of bugles (3 s, estimated from our acoustic analyses)
and the dimension H (2.5 mm, estimated from dissection). We then
estimate the sounding frequency of the whistle using the distance W
(70 mm, estimated from our dissections).
Mammalian lung volume VL increases linearly with increasing
body mass Mb (Tenney & Remmers 1963; Worthington et al. 1991;
Schmidt-Nielsen 1997) and can be estimated according to the
formula:
VL ¼ 0:046 � M1:06
b
A1
ð
Þ
Using this equation, we can estimate the lung volume for a typical
male wapiti body mass of 330 kg as 21.5 l. Over 3 s, this
corresponds to a typical volume flow of 0.0072 m3 s−1, forced
through an exit channel with a characteristic size H of 2.5 mm,
therefore giving a jet velocity Uj of (0.0072)/(0.00252)=1146 m s−1.
If the perturbation is convected at a velocity of Vj=0.4Uj (Chaigne
and Kergomard 2008) along a distance W between the flue exit and
the labium estimated at 70 mm, the convection time τ of the acoustic
velocity perturbations from the flue exit toward the labium can be
estimated as τ=W/Vj=W/(0.4Uj)=1.53×10–4 s, corresponding to a
characteristic frequency (1/τ) of ∼6540 Hz. If the jet velocity is such
that there is just half a wavelength of the transverse disturbance
between the flue and the labium (first hydrodynamic mode), then
the system will sound at half the characteristic frequency, here
3270 Hz.
This sounding frequency has the same order of magnitude as the
G0 component of the bugles reported in this study as well as in the
literature, confirming that this flute analogy is a plausible hypothesis.
If the blowing pressure is increased, shortening the jet travel time, the
sounding frequency rises, whereas if the blowing pressure is lowered,
the sounding frequency falls. This may explain why towards the end
of the bugle, when lung pressure decreases dramatically, the whistle
frequency falls towards a minimal G0 value of 160 Hz.
Dimensionless numbers can also be used to assess the
compatibility of this system with the production of a flute-like
whistle. Reynoldsnumbercan beestimated as Re=Uj×H/ν,whereν is
the kinematic viscosity of air, which is 1146×0.0025/(1.5×10–5)
=1.9×105.This value is relatively high compared with most flute-like
instruments (105 being a typical upper limit). Another relevant
dimensionless number, the geometrical ratio W/H, can be estimated
as 0.070/0.0025=28, which is again relatively high yet comparable to
values characteristic of organ pipes (up to 30; Chaigne and
Kergomard, 2008).
