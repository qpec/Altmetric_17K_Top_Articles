T
he need to lower health care costs is recognized by pub-
lic and private payers in most developed countries, 
including Canada.1 As noted in a recent report from the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 
“Healthcare costs are rising so fast in advanced economies that 
they will become unaffordable by mid-century without reforms.”2
International data suggest that an exclusive focus on health care 
expenditures in the discussion about health care reform has been 
misleading;3,4 using spending and health data from 30 industrialized 
countries, these authors found that the total amount spent on both 
health and social programs explained health outcomes. Broader 
international comparisons have supported that finding.5 A follow-up 
study using state-level data from the United States further estab-
lished social expenditures as a source of population health gains 
with a more culturally homogeneous data set.6 A 2009 Canadian 
Senate report suggested that the health care system accounted for 
only 25% of health outcomes, noting, “The socioeconomic environ-
ment is the most powerful of the determinants of health.”7
Conceptually, addressing the social determinants of health 
can be conceived as the equivalent of treating the root causes of 
disease and ill health.8 As a result, spending on social services, 
widely defined, is a good proxy for public spending on the social 
determinants of health. However, this type of spending is diffi-
cult to quantify; individual government departments can have 
several functions, and although some clearly pertain to social 
services, categorization is more difficult when the social impact 
is indirect or only part of a department’s function.
Building on a long tradition of comparative public policy in 
Canada,9–11 we conducted a comparative analysis of health and 
social spending in Canadian provinces, to examine whether 
ratios of social to health spending in these jurisdictions were cor-
related with health.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Escalating health care 
spending is a concern in Western coun-
tries, given the lack of evidence of a 
direct connection between spending 
and improvements in health. We aimed 
to determine the association between 
spending on health care and social pro-
grams and health outcomes in Canada.
METHODS: We used retrospective data 
from Canadian provincial expenditure 
reports, for the period 1981 to 2011, to 
model the effects of social and health 
spending (as a ratio, social/health) on 
potentially avoidable mortality, infant 
mortality and life expectancy. We used 
linear regressions, accounting for pro-
vincial fixed effects and time, and con-
trolling for confounding variables at the 
provincial level.
RESULTS: A 1-cent increase in social 
spending per dollar spent on health was 
associated with a 0.1% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.04% to 0.16%) decrease in 
potentially avoidable mortality and a 
0.01% (95% CI 0.01% to 0.02%) increase 
in life expectancy. The ratio had a statis-
tically nonsignificant relationship with 
infant mortality (p = 0.2). 
INTERPRETATION: Population-level 
health outcomes could benefit from a 
reallocation of government dollars from 
health to social spending, even if total 
government spending were left 
unchanged. This result is consistent 
with other findings from Canada and the 
United States.

(combined population 119 100) were not included because of 
insufficient data. We used publicly available time-series data.12 
These data, drawn from provincial public accounts, report health 
and social spending by function across government accounts, 
considering the changing names of government departments or 
port 
folios when aggregating measures. Definitions of health and 
social spending are presented in Appendix 1 (available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170132/-/DC1).
Dependent variables
The dependent variables were 3 measures of province-level 
health outcomes: potentially avoidable mortality (age standard-
ized per 100 000 population), infant mortality (per 1000 live 
births) and life expectancy at birth (yr). These variables are indi-
cators of the performance of the health care system and of popu-
lation health.13 Rates of mortality from avoidable causes have 
many determinants, including access to treatment, health 
behaviours, environmental conditions and technical change in 
medical treatment. All nonspending variables were retrieved 
from Statistics Canada’s publicly available Canadian Socio-
economic Information Management system (known as CANSIM). 
We excluded education spending from our definition of social 
spending. Accurately capturing the influence of education spend-
ing on our outcomes of interest would have necessitated assign-
ing education spending to the cohorts who benefit from it; edu-
cation spending almost entirely benefits school-age children at 
the time it is spent, but outcomes may occur later in life. Health 
and social spending, on the other hand, can have contemporan-
eous benefits: an increase in physician salaries or welfare pay-
ments is experienced immediately.
Independent variables
The independent variable of interest for each province and year 
was the ratio of provincial government spending on social ser-
vices relative to spending on health care.3,5,6 Demographic con-
trols included the percentages of each province’s population 
who were 65 years or older, who were female and who were liv-
ing in rural areas, as well as the total population size. Economic 
controls included the unemployment rate, the median after-tax 
income (natural log), the Gini coefficient (a validated measure 
that is widely used to describe regional income inequality, with 
values between 0 and 1, where 0 = perfect equality and 1 = per-
fect inequality) for after-tax income and total real provincial 
expenditure (in billions of dollars). 
Statistical analysis
We fitted linear regression models for each health outcome as a 
function of the ratio of social to health spending and the 
independ 
ent variables to control for confounding influences on 
the dependent variables. We numbered the models as follows: 
model 1 for potentially avoidable mortality, model 2 for infant 
mortality and model 3 for life expectancy. We present unadjusted 
and adjusted models. We also report standardized regression 
coefficients for the adjusted models. Our regressions included 
provincial fixed effects and dummy variables indicating year. 
Fixed-effects regression is a technique commonly used with 
panel data to control for idiosyncratic effects that cannot be 
observed in the data.14 In our case, provincial fixed effects con-
trolled for time-invariant provincial factors, such as weather or 
political trends. For all statistical analyses, we used Stata, ver-
sion 14 (StataCorp LLC). 
Ethics approval
The study institution (University of Calgary) does not require eth-
ics approval for projects using publicly available secondary data, 
such as this one. 
Results
Summary statistics describing the distribution of spending and 
health outcomes averaged across the 9 provinces and 31 years are 
presented in Table 1. Average per capita spending on social ser-
vices, in thousands of dollars, was 0.93 (standard deviation [SD] 
0.19, range 0.44–1.53), whereas average per capita spending on 
health, in thousands of dollars, was 2.90 (SD 0.71, range 1.55–5.42), 
about 3 times more. Figure 1 shows these variables over time, with 
the Canadian average for social spending increasing from about 
0.77 thousand to 0.97 thousand per capita and health spending 
increasing from about 2 thousand to 4 thousand per capita. 
Potentially avoidable mortality, infant mortality and life expec-
tancy are also summarized in Table 1. Since 1981, trends in these 
variables have shown improvement in every province (Figure 2). 
The Canadian average for all health outcomes improved as follows: 
potentially avoidable mortality, from 431 per 100 000 to 208.7 per 
100 000; infant mortality, from 9.6 per 100 live births to 4.8 per 100 
live births; and life expectancy, from 78 years to 81.1 years.
The health variables trended in a positive direction overall, 
and spending rose over time. Therefore, controlling for the time 
trend (by adding time fixed effects) was necessary to avoid incor-
rectly associating spending with improvements in health out-
comes because of their common trends. Table 2 shows the key 
finding of this analysis, that social spending was associated with 
health outcomes across provinces. A 1-cent increase in social

spending per dollar spent on health was associated with a 0.1% 
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04% to 0.16%) decrease in poten-
tially avoidable mortality and a 0.01% (95% CI 0.01% to 0.02%) 
increase in life expectancy; the result for infant mortality was non-
significant. The standardized version of the models allowed us to 
interpret the coefficients as changes in SDs rather than units. The 
standardized coefficients in Table 2 show that a 1-SD increase in 
the ratio of social to health spending was associated with a 
0.0462-SD decrease in potentially avoidable mortality and a 
0.0819-SD increase in life expectancy. These estimates mean that 
life expectancy might be expected to have a larger relative change 
than potentially avoidable mortality with changes in social spend-
ing, because of the smaller variance of life expectancy (Figure 2).
Our adjusted model results can be calibrated with govern-
ment spending data. Using 2011 values for Ontario (the most 
populous province), a 1-cent increase in social spending for each 
dollar of health spending would represent an additional 
$350 million on social spending (an increase of 2.6% in the 2011 
level of funding) combined with a decrease of $350 million on 
health spending (a decrease of 0.8% in the 2011 level of funding). 
On the basis of the model results, potentially avoidable mortality 
is predicted to decrease from 197.8 to 197.6 per 100 000 in 2011, 
which is an additional 3% decrease from the 2010 value of 205.3 
per 100 000. Similarly, life expectancy would increase by 0.01% in 
2007 (from 81.50 to 81.51 yr), which is an additional increase of 
5% from the 2006 level of 81.3 years. 
Several of the coefficients in Table 2 indicate that the covari-
ables were associated with the population health variables: the 
unemployment rate was associated with worse potentially 
avoidable mortality and infant mortality outcomes; larger popu-
lations were associated with better potentially avoidable mortal-
ity and infant mortality outcomes; a larger rural population was 
associated with worse outcomes for potentially avoidable mor-
tality; and higher median income and higher real government 
expenditures were associated with worse outcomes for poten-
tially avoidable mortality and life expectancy. For example, an 
increase in the unemployment rate of 1 percentage point is asso-
ciated with a 0.67% (95% CI 0.16% to 1.18%) increase in poten-
tially avoidable mortality and a 2.0% (95% CI 0.18% to 3.83%) 
increase in infant mortality.  
Appendices 2 and 3 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.170132/-/DC1) are sensitivity analyses of the main 
result from Table 2. Appendix 2 shows that social spending was asso-
ciated with favourable trends in potentially avoidable mortality and 
life expectancy if we decompose the ratio as follows: a 1% increase 
in social spending is associated with a decrease of 0.034% (95% CI

–0.057% to –0.011%) in potentially avoidable mortality 
and an increase of 0.006% (95% CI 0.004% to 0.008%) in 
life expectancy, whereas a 1% increase in health spend-
ing is associated with an increase of 0.064% (95% CI 
0.002% to 0.126%) in potentially avoidable mortality and 
no change in life expectancy. Appendix 3 shows that 
using the ratio from 1 or 2 years before the outcome pro-
duced estimates similar to those obtained with contem-
poraneous values, which indicates that the result in 
Table 2 is not explained by reverse causality.
Interpretation
Our analysis showed that increased social spending 
was positively associated with population health mea-
sures in Canada at the provincial level. Our supplemen-
tary analyses showed that health spending did not 
have the same association. In all of these analyses, we 
controlled for the effects of province-level variables 
and time.
The ratio of social to health spending is a potential 
avenue through which the government can affect 
popu 
lation health outcomes. The ratio of social to 
health spending is low, so redistributing money from 
health to social spending represents a small relative 
change in health spending. The literature suggests that 
additional spending on health does not necessarily 
affect population health outcomes,15 yet in all prov-
inces, health spending increased rapidly after a drop 
in the mid-1990s, while social spending remained rela-
tively flat. If a proportionately small funding realloca-
tion from health to social spending is associated with 
small improvements in population health outcomes, 
then the improvements in health variables that we 
observed in our data could have been larger with no 
change to the government’s overall spending.
Our sensitivity analysis (Appendix 2) showed that 
social spending is associated with improvements in 
the population health variables, evidence of the notion 
that further spending on health may not improve 
popu 
lation health outcomes as effectively as social 
spending. If social spending addresses the social deter-
minants of health, then it is a form of preventive health 
spending and changes the risk distribution for the 
entire population8 rather than treating those who pre-
sent with disease. Redirecting resources from health to 
social services, at the margin, is an efficient way to 
improve health outcomes.
This information can help decision-makers in 
deciding where to spend marginal dollars to improve 
population health, especially in the face of competing 
claims from multiple stakeholders. For example, a pro-
vincial medical association may be negotiating a ser-
vice agreement with the provincial government that 
includes, among other things, a payment schedule.

province offers a payment schedule that includes clawbacks for 
top-billing physicians to control costs; the physicians caution that 
these clawbacks may harm health outcomes for patients. In this 
discussion, the focus is on health outcomes as a function of 
health spending, rather than a shared understanding that spend-
ing on social services may also improve health outcomes.
There is growing evidence of a causal relationship between 
inequality and poor health.16,17 It is likely that most beneficiaries 
of increased social spending would be those with the lowest 
incomes (and consequently shortest life expectancies), and they 
might see larger-than-average gains within provinces.
Our analysis agrees with previously cited international and US 
findings3–6 and other Canadian work using different data.18 Multi-
ple studies have indicated that improving population health 
requires consideration of government spending beyond health 
care. Because of model and data set differences across studies, 
direct comparisons are not possible, but broadly, increased social 
spending (either as welfare generosity, a share of total gross 
domestic product or a proportion of health spending) is favour-
ably associated with health outcomes such as life expectancy, 
infant mortality, potential years of life lost, obesity prevalence, 
acute myocardial infarction and mental health days off work.3–6,18 
Our study differs from previous studies in terms of both the length 
of time observed and the number of control variables utilized, but 
the relation between social spending and health outcomes holds. 
Marginal increases in health care spending in Canada have not

*Fixed effects for province and year were included in each model (coefficients not reported). For each value, the 95% confidence interval is shown in parentheses.
†Interpretation of the adjusted model coefficients requires multiplying the coefficient by 100, then interpreting the resultant number as a percent change in the outcome per 1-unit 
change in the independent variable. For example, in model 1, a 1-cent increase in social spending for each dollar in health spending was associated with a 0.1% decrease in potentially 
avoidable mortality.

been shown to directly improve population health,19 and while 
health spending per capita within Canada continues to grow, the 
nature of the effects on health outcomes is up for debate.20,21
Allocative decisions internal to the health sector are only part 
of the discussion on how public spending (including social assis-
tance, education, housing and public pensions) affects health 
outcomes. Health care spending is important in the treatment of 
disease, but the determination of population health is the end 
result of a complicated system that includes the lifelong influence 
of the social determinants of health on individuals (broadly 
including income, education, ethnicity, early childhood develop-
ment, the natural and physical built environments, and inequal-
ity22), which are driven by proximal features of the social and 
physical environment.15
Limitations
Our analysis relied on contemporaneous time-series data, which 
raises the possibility of reverse causation (e.g., improved health 
outcomes might have allowed for greater social spending). How-
ever, social spending did not increase as substantially over our 
study period as did health spending (Figure 1); therefore, if 
health improvements do drive government spending decisions, 
our data point to health spending getting a larger share of the 
marginal dollar. Furthermore, introducing lagged social to health 
spending variables (Appendix 3) showed that our results were 
robust to single-period and dual-period treatments. 
Comparable government data on disaggregated measures of 
health and social spending do not exist over a sufficiently long 
period. However, our data span a long period (31 yr), meaning 
that the time dimension of our data captures the influences of the 
wide changes in spending shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, our 
analysis includes only province-level spending, and not that of 
the federal and municipal levels of government. Although spend-
ing on health and social services by the federal government and 
municipalities is somewhat exogenous to spending in these areas 
by the provinces, including these levels of jurisdiction in the 
analy 
sis would provide a more complete understanding. 
It is possible that there are important differences within prov-
inces. For example, persistent disparities exist in infant mortality 
rates between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities.23 
Additionally, investigating whether there is a threshold effect of 
social spending is beyond the scope of this paper. All of these are 
avenues for future research.
Conclusion
The results of our study suggest that spending on social services can 
improve health. Social policy changes at the margins, where it is pos-
sible to affect population health outcomes by reallocating spending 
in a way that has no effect on the overall government budget.
