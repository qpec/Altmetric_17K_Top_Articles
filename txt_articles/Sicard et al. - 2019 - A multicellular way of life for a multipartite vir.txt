Abstract A founding paradigm in virology is that the spatial unit of the viral replication cycle is
an individual cell. Multipartite viruses have a segmented genome where each segment is
encapsidated separately. In this situation the viral genome is not recapitulated in a single virus
particle but in the viral population. How multipartite viruses manage to efficiently infect individual
cells with all segments, thus with the whole genome information, is a long-standing but perhaps
deceptive mystery. By localizing and quantifying the genome segments of a nanovirus in host plant
tissues we show that they rarely co-occur within individual cells. We further demonstrate that
distinct segments accumulate independently in different cells and that the viral system is functional
through complementation across cells. Our observation deviates from the classical conceptual
framework in virology and opens an alternative possibility (at least for nanoviruses) where the
infection can operate at a level above the individual cell level, defining a viral multicellular way of
life.

Introduction
Viruses introduce their genome into a susceptible cell and highjack diverse cell functions to complete
their replication cycle. Once this ‘cell-autonomous’ cycle is completed, virus particles exit the
infected cell and enter a new healthy one where a similar cycle is reiterated. This universal view of
the viral way of life has been applied to multipartite viruses since their discovery, over half a century
ago (Brakke et al., 1951; Lister, 1966; van Kammen and van Griensven, 1970; Gokhale and Bald,
1987), despite the fact that such a conceptual framework fails to explain the evolution and even the
functioning of these viral systems (Iranzo and Manrubia, 2012; Sicard et al., 2016; Lucı
´a-Sanz and
Manrubia, 2017).
Depending on the viral species, multipartite viruses have their genome composed of two to eight
segments of DNA or RNA (single or double stranded), each encapsidated individually in a separate
virus particle. They have been reported to infect frequently plants and fungi where they represent at
least 35–40% of the viral genera and families described (Hull, 2014), rarely insects (Hu et al., 2016;
Ladner et al., 2016), and only hypothetically vertebrates (Ladner et al., 2016). The benefits of the
individual encapsidation of distinct segments are unclear and debated (Sicard et al., 2016; Lucı
´a-
Sanz and Manrubia, 2017). In contrast, the reduced probability to infect individual host cells with at
least one copy of each segment is unanimously acknowledged as a major cost that increases with
the number of segments composing the viral genome (Iranzo and Manrubia, 2012). This cost
appears insurmountable, at least for viruses with more than three genome segments, and sets the
existence of such highly multipartite viruses as an enigma in general biology (Iranzo and Manrubia,

SHORT REPORT
 2012; Sicard et al., 2016; Lucı
´a-Sanz and Manrubia, 2017). Nevertheless, its empirical basis has
never been questioned.
Using a highly multipartite virus with eight genome segments, we here propose that the concep-
tual framework in Virology should be amended to account for such viral systems. Indeed, in our spe-
cific experimental model species, we demonstrate that the distinct segments do not need be
together in individual cells for the system to be functional. They accumulate independently in and
complement across neighboring cells, defining a multicellular way of life.
Results
Distinct viral genome segments do not necessarily co-localize in
individual infected cells
Our first aim was to experimentally verify whether the different segments of a multipartite virus have
to be together in individual cells for the system to be functional. We used the highly multipartite
faba bean necrotic stunt virus (FBNSV, genus Nanovirus, Family Nanoviridae), whose genome is com-
posed of eight circular ssDNA segments (Figure 1A) (Grigoras et al., 2009). We first compared the
localization of distinct segments in individual cells of faba bean host plants with specific fluorescent
probes
and
confocal
microscopy.
In

(see
Materials and methods), the visualization of pairs of segments respectively labeled with green and
red fluorochromes immediately revealed that distinct segments do not necessarily co-occur but are
most often found in different cells (Figure 1B–I and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We tested 7
out of the 28 possible pairs of segments. In all cases we observed a similar situation with one seg-
ment most often highly accumulated in the absence of the other in individual cells. Remarkably, this
applied even to the pairs from the three segments encoding for the three basic functions of plant
viruses: replication (segment R encoding M-Rep), encapsidation (segment S encoding CP) and intra-
eLife digest Many viruses are small particles consisting of genetic material surrounded by a coat
made of proteins. They are unable to multiply on their own and so they must enter a host cell and
trick it into reading their genetic information to produce new virus particles.
It is generally thought that the process of making new virus particles happens independently in
each infected cell. This idea assumes that a given particle contains the entire set of genetic material
(known as the genome) of that virus, but this is not always the case. Many so-called ‘multipartite’
viruses have genomes that are split into several segments carried in separate particles: in this case, a
single particle only contains a portion of the entire viral genome.
Faba bean necrotic stunt virus (or FBNSV for short) is a multipartite virus that infects and causes
disease in members of the pea and bean family. There are eight types of FBNSV particle that each
carries a distinct genome segment, a small section of the entire viral genome. There is a low
probability that a single cell could be infected with all eight different types of particle at the same
time and receive the complete FBNSV genome. So how is this virus able to successfully multiply
within a plant?
To address this question, Sicard et al. used microscopy to study FBNSV genome segments as
they infected the cells of faba bean plants. The experiments confirmed that the eight different
segments of the FBNSV genome were not necessarily found together within the same cell, but
instead accumulated independently in different cells. This means that a cell infected with FBNSV
may be unable to make all of the proteins needed to assemble new virus particles. However,
additional experiments demonstrated that infected cells may be exchanging virus proteins, which
could enable them to create complete virus particles.
The findings of Sicard et al. demonstrate that FBNSV hijacks groups of host cells to manufacture
new virus particles, rather than relying on individual cells as previously thought. It is possible that
other multipartite and non-multipartite viruses work a similar manner. Ultimately, this knowledge
may reshape what we know about how viruses infect their hosts.

 host movement (segment M encoding MP), suggesting that cells containing all eight segments are
extremely rare.
Though challenging the current view of the viral cell-autonomous replication cycle, a simple expla-
nation of our observation is that the FBNSV can function while its genome segments occur in distinct
neighboring cells. This possibility calls i) for further evidence that the accumulation of a given seg-
ment is independent of the accumulation of the others in individual cells and ii) for the proof of

 concept that the function encoded by a given viral segment can complement the others at a dis-
tance, in cells where this segment is absent.
Distinct segments accumulate independently in distinct individual host
cells
One may argue, sticking to the paradigm that the viral genetic information is replicated as an inte-
gral genome within individual cells, that all FBNSV segments are present in infected cells but that
the apparent absence of some in Figure 1 is due to the detection limit of our technique. Because
every technique has its limit, whatever the technology implemented, it would not be reasonable to
certify that the absence of detection is a proof of the absence of the corresponding segment. We
thus imagined an approach where the detection limit becomes irrelevant. For a given pair of seg-
ments, we quantified and compared both green and red fluorescence in all individual cells where at
least one of the two was observed above background (for detailed quantification procedure see the
Materials and methods section). By doing so, we alleviate the problem of the limit of detection and
rather question whether the accumulation of one segment of the pair is dependent on that of the
other. As a positive control of this approach, we first produced two fluorescent probes, each specifi-
cally labeling a different region of the same segment R (probes R1 and R2). Figure 2 illustrates that
all cells labeled by R1 are also labeled by R2 (Figure 2A). Moreover, plotting the average intensity
of green over red fluorescence for each of these cells resulted in a highly significant linear relation-
ship (correlation coefficient r = 0.90, p=1.98 10�23 in the example of petiole N˚ 42 in Figure 2B).
Four independent repeats of this control similarly showed strong correlations (Table 1). This result
validates our approach by demonstrating that when we monitor two viral DNA sequences whose

blue. Horizontal bar is 10 microns. The average intensity of the green fluorescence within individual cells is plotted against that of the red in B and C.
Green and red probes are targeted against two distinct regions of the same segment R in (B), and against two distinct segments, respectively S and R
in (C). The analyzed cells are from petiole N˚42 for the positive control in (B) and from petiole N˚5 for the pair R/S in (C). The same analysis from three
additional petioles for the control (also see Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and nine additional petioles for the segments pair R/S are summarized in
Table 1. Panel D plots the ratio of the frequency of two segments of a pair (estimated by qPCR on total DNA extracted from infected tissues) against
the ratio of the number of cells they respectively infect within eight petioles from eight different infected plants (data provided in Supplementary file
1: Table S1).

 accumulation should be highly correlated, such as two regions of the same segment, we indeed find
that they co-localize and accumulate at highly correlated levels.
This approach was then extensively used for the pair of segments R/S because they encode the
two key viral functions, replication and encapsidation. In total, we tested 10 petioles, each from a
different plant infected independently. No significant correlation could be found (Figure 2C,
Table 1), whether at early or late stages of infection (Table 1 and also see Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 2), showing that the accumulation of the segment S in a cell is independent of that of the repli-
cation-encoding segment R. We extended this analysis to five additional petioles from five
independent plants, two for the pair R/M and three for the pair S/M, and again found no significant
positive correlation; a result indicative of independent accumulation (Table 1). To further support
this conclusion, we used the earlier reported variation in the relative frequency of the segments
across infected plants (Sicard et al., 2013). Within an infected petiole, if two segments indepen-
dently enter and accumulate in individual cells, then their relative frequencies in infected tissues
should be proportional to the ratio of the number of cells they respectively infect. We quantified by
qPCR the relative frequency of the two segments of the pair in a fragment of eight of the analyzed
petioles (Supplementary file 1: Table S1). Figure 2D shows a significant correlation between the rel-
ative frequency of the segments in the tissues and the relative number of cells they respectively
infect (n = 7, F = 12, R = 0.677, p-value=0.0122). Hence, two different technologies (FISH-confocal
microscopy and quantitative real-time PCR) concur to demonstrate that the accumulation of distinct
FBNSV segments in individual cells is independent.
The function of a viral gene can act in a cell where the gene itself is
absent
To make sense out of the above observation we assumed that a viral function can be present and
act in a cell where its encoding segment is not, and thus that the viral system can be functional
despite the independent dispersal of its distinct genes in distinct cells. The validation of this assump-
tion was set up with a focus on the replication function. We first confirmed that the segments
detected in individual cells are the product of replication. Then we searched for the presence of the
protein M-Rep in these cells, to support replication even when its encoding segment R is absent.
Two possible alternatives could lead to the detection of a segment as a fluorescent signal spread
out in a large volume of the nucleus. Either one (or very few) copy entered, replicated and invaded
the nucleus to detectable level, or a number of copies large enough to be detectable entered and
diffused throughout the nucleus with no replication. When looking at images shown in Figure 1, the
latter appears unrealistic because it would imply the specific sorting of different segments at their
entry in distinct nearby cells. Nevertheless, to experimentally dismiss this possibility, we similarly
investigated the distribution of two alleles of the same segment (differing solely by a small inserted

 marker sequence) for which no specific sorting can be expected. In the absence of sorting, if the
segment massively enters cells to detectable level without replication, the two alleles should be co-
detected in most cells. In contrast, if one (to very few) copy of this segment enters each individual
cell and then accumulates through replication, allele-specific FISH labeling should reveal solely one
of the two alleles in most cells. Three independent experiments were carried out for each of the seg-
ments S and N where two genetic markers have earlier been inserted (Gallet et al., 2017). They con-
sistently revealed that most individual cells (54% to 100%) contained only one detectable allele
(Figure 3—figure supplement 1), confirming that one to very few copies of the segment initially
enter individual cells and thus that detection all over the nucleus can only result from replication.
We then confronted the cells where the segment S is detectable (thus where it has replicated) to
the detection of either segment R or its protein product M-Rep, by a combination of FISH and
immunofluorescence-labeling (Figure 3A and B). While segment R was detectable in only a minority
of these cells (approx. 40%), its protein product M-Rep was positively revealed in nearly 85%
(Figure 3C), indicating that the expression product of R segment can move to neighboring cells.
That the protein M-Rep is undetectable in a few cells replicating segment S (approx. 15%) can be
explained by distinct turnovers for the genome segments and their expression products. Indeed,
both mRNAs and proteins have a relatively rapid turnover within a cell, whereas the DNA viral
sequences can be stored indefinitely into the cell nucleus either encapsidated or as stable minichro-
mosomes

Ramesh
et
al.,
2017;
Deuschle
et
al.,

Rodrı
´guez-
Negrete et al., 2014). Thus, we assume that for all cells where at least one FBNSV segment is
detectable the protein M-Rep is or has been present, but that this protein may have disappeared in
Figure 3. Accumulation of the protein M-Rep in cells containing either segment S or segment R. Segment R (A) or S (B) is FISH-labeled with a green

and the protein M-Rep are detected, whereas red arrows exemplify cases where only M-Rep is detectable. The boxplots (C) are constructed from
Supplementary file 1: Table S1. The proportion of cells with the S segment that also contain the R segment (green left boxplot, estimated from 10
petioles) is compared to the proportion of cells with the S segment that also contain the protein M-Rep (middle orange boxplot, estimated from 14
petioles). The proportion of individual cells with detectable R segment that also contain the protein M-Rep was estimated from 4 infected petioles (blue
right boxplot). Difference between left green boxplot and orange middle boxplot is highly significant (GLM model, p-value (>�2
1) = 2.94e-12); that
between middle orange boxplot and right blue boxplot is not (GLM model, p-value (>�2

 some cases at the moment of the observation. Consistent with this assumption is the observation of
a similar proportion of cells containing the segment R where its own expression product M-Rep is no
longer detectable (Figure 3C).
It is important to note the detection of the M-Rep protein, often with intense signal (Figure 3A &
B), in a large number of cells where segment R is absent (Supplementary file 1: Table S1, petioles
36–39). Moreover, Figure 3C (orange middle and bleu-grey right boxplots) indicates that the protein
M-Rep is not more associated to cells containing its own encoding segment R than to cells contain-
ing other segments. Although they represent indirect evidence, these observations together further
support our conclusion that either the mRNA or the protein M-Rep itself can travel from the produc-
ing cells (those where segment R accumulates) to other cells of the host, as further discussed below.
Discussion/conclusion
Altogether, our results demonstrate that key genome segments of the FBNSV accumulate in individ-
ual cells independently of the presence and accumulation of the others. We thus propose that the
different parts of the viral genome can complement across distinct neighboring cells and can only
sustain the productive infection at a multicellular tissue level. As numerous other plant virus species
(Hipper et al., 2013; Folimonova and Tilsner, 2018), nanoviruses are restricted to vascular tissues
and replicate in phloem companion and parenchyma cells (Shirasawa-Seo et al., 2005). A model
compatible with our observations is that each genome segment entering and expressing within a
cell can export its gene products as ‘common goods’ in neighboring cells and/or sieve elements, so
that these common goods are redistributed among interconnected cells and complement the sys-
tem. The demonstration that the protein M-Rep accumulates and functions in cells devoid of its
encoding DNA-R is a proof of concept fully supporting this model. Numerous studies have shown
that plant mRNAs (Kehr and Kragler, 2018) and proteins can move from cell to cell or long distance
(Turnbull and Lopez-Cobollo, 2013; Lopez-Cobollo et al., 2016; Paultre et al., 2016), even from
root to shoot. Unfortunately, the mechanisms and specific control of these mRNAs and proteins
mobility is vastly elusive. For FBNSV, each segment may export and redistribute its product in a dis-
tinct way, some may produce mobile mRNA, others may produce mobile protein, and others may
be complemented for movement by the product of a specific segment (or even by a host factor) that
may act as a carrier. Specifying these diverse possibilities is beyond the scope of this report. Like-
wise, whether this non-cell-autonomous model can be extended to viral species invading non-
phloem tissues where cell communication is more restricted is unknown. Non phloem-restricted
viruses could induce the formation of symplastic domains, either by manipulating the endogenous
capacity of the host plant to do so (Faulkner, 2018) or by opening plasmodesmata through the
action of their non-cell-autonomous movement protein (Lucas, 2006), but this possibility awaits fur-
ther investigation. Here we introduce an additional concept in virology, which is compatible with
empirical observations and which partially alleviates the insurmountable cost in highly multipartite
viral systems such as FBNSV (Iranzo and Manrubia, 2012): because concomitant infection of individ-
ual cells by all genomic segments is not necessary, the associated putative cost should be much
smaller if not nil at the within-host level. We earlier discussed the fact that the analogous cost upon
between-host transmission and the mechanisms of its compensation remain to be understood
(Gallet et al., 2018).
Such a multicellular way of life could be adopted in other multicomponent genetic entities, such
as other multipartite viruses, segmented viruses which often fail to encapsidate all genome segments
together (Luque et al., 2009; Wichgers Schreur and Kortekaas, 2016; Brooke, 2017), satellites,
and defective interfering particles, if functional complementation could occur at a supra-cellular
level.

Host plant, virus isolate and inoculation
Faba bean (Vicia faba, cv. ‘Sevilla’) was used as the host plant in all experiments, and seeded, main-
tained and inoculated as described (Sicard et al., 2013; Gallet et al., 2017; Gallet et al., 2018;
Sicard et al., 2015). The viral infectious clone is from the species Faba bean necrotic stunt virus,
genus Nanovirus, family Nanoviridae. Its construction in agrobacterium plasmids has been earlier
described in details (Grigoras et al., 2009), as well as all conditions and procedures for agro-inocu-
lation (Grigoras et al., 2009; Sicard et al., 2013; Gallet et al., 2017; Gallet et al., 2018;
Sicard et al., 2015). Plants were sowed as one seed per pot. The plantlets were agro-inoculated
nine days later and symptoms appeared from 9 days post inoculation (dpi) till 19 dpi, depending on
individual plants. As shown in all the publications cited in this paragraph, the inoculation of plants
with this infectious clone routinely yields a productive viral infection, meaning that the FBNSV par-
ticles can be purified from these infected plants and very efficiently transmitted to new healthy ones
by aphids.

 Sampling of infected material
Infected plants were sampled at different days post inoculation: at 11, 12, 13, 17, 20, 25 and 27 dpi
(Table 1 and Supplementary file 1: Table S1). Nanoviruses, and thus FBNSV, replicate and accumu-
late primarily in phloem vascular bundles of the upper part of the plant, in companion cells and
phloem parenchyma cells of the stem, petioles and main leaf veins. A 1 to 3 cm-long section of the
petiole of the upper leaf level was cut off from each infected plant and immediately fixed and proc-
essed for fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) and/or immunofluorescence labeling (IF). In some
cases, the petiole was divided into two equal portions, one for FISH and/or IF and the other for
DNA extraction and qPCR.
Quantitative real-time PCR
The FBNSV genome is composed of eight circular ssDNA segments of around 1 kb each
(Figure 1A). Total DNA extraction from infected petioles and qPCR reactions specific to each of the
eight segments were performed as described previously (Gallet et al., 2017), including primer pairs,
PCR conditions, and post-PCR data analysis. The relative frequency of two segments of a pair within
a given petiole was obtained by dividing the estimated copy number of a segment by that of the
other.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence labeling
Random priming and incorporation of Alexa Fluor-labeled dUTP (either Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa
Fluor 568 for green and red labeling, respectively) were performed to prepare probes specific to
each of the eight segments, with the BioPrime DNA labeling system kit (Invitrogen) and according to
the manufacturer instructions except that dUTP-Alexa Fluor were used in place of dCTP-biotine of
the kit. For each probe, the template DNA corresponded to a PCR-amplified fragment restricted
within the viral gene coding sequence, which is the sequence unique to each segment. The primer

Supplementary file 1: Table S2. In some cases, short probes were synthesized by the company
Eurogentec and covalently linked to either ATTO-488 (green) or ATTO-565 (red) fluorochrome
(sequences also available in Table S2). The specificity of each probe was tested on membranes, on
dotted plasmids each containing one of the eight viral segments, as well as on healthy plants.
Each petiole harvested from an infected plant as described above was fixed by gentle stirring
overnight at 4˚C in PBS buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Tween-20. After one rinse
with 2 mL of PBS buffer containing 0.1M glycine, the petiole was transferred into ethanol 70% and
stored at 4˚C until use (max. storage time: 1 month).
Fixed petioles were then placed individually into Eppendorf tubes containing 8% low-melting
agarose in water at 40˚C. Petiole trunks were maintained into an upright position until the agarose
cooled down and polymerized, and placed at 4˚C for 4 hr. The jellified agarose blocks were extorted
from the tubes and cross-sections of 80–100 microns were produced with a Vibratome HM650V
(Microm), set up in mode CPC, program 50, speed 23, frequency 100, and amplitude 0.6. Cross-sec-
tions were treated in 1 mL of Carnoy solution (six volumes chloroform, three volumes ethanol, and 1
vol acetic acid) during 1 hr under gentle stirring and then rinsed once in PBS buffer. An RNAse treat-
ment (100 mg/mL of RNAse1 in PBS) was applied to all samples for 45 min. at 37˚C, in order to elimi-
nate viral mRNAs, followed by one rinse in PBS and three additional rinses in hybridization buffer (20
mM Tris-HCl pH8, 0.9M NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 30% Formamide).
Fluorescent probes were diluted thirty times in hybridization buffer (10 mL in 300 mL total), dena-
tured 10 min. at 100˚C and then rapidly cooled on ice for 15 min. Petiole cross sections were then
incubated overnight at 37˚C in the diluted and heat-denatured probes solutions into embryo dishes
sealed with parafilm membranes. After three rinses of 5 min with hybridization buffer and one with
PBS, petiole sections were mounted on microscopy slides in Vectashield antifade mounting medium
containing 1.5mg/mL DAPI for staining nuclei.
Some samples were further treated for immuno-fluorescent labeling of M-Rep protein. In these
cases the FISH-treated petiole cross sections were collected after the last PBS rinse and blocked for
1 hr and 30 min. in PBS + 5% BSA. The incubation with the primary antibody (M-Rep specific anti-
body ‘FBNYV-M-Rep 8th bleed’ (Vega-Arreguı
´n et al., 2005), diluted 1/300) was in PBS + 5% BSA
overnight at 4˚C, and that with the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 IgG

 conjugate, diluted 1/250, Life Technologies) was in PBS + 5% BSA for 1 hr at 37˚C. Samples were
submitted to three rinses of 10 min each in PBS + 0.05%Tween-20 at room temperature after incu-
bations with primary and secondary antibodies. Samples were finally transferred into PBS and then
mounted on microscopy slides as above.
Confocal microscopy observations and fluorescence quantification
Observations were all performed in sequential mode using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope.
Alexa Fluor 488 and ATTO 488 were excited with a 488 nm laser and the variable secondary dichroic
(VSD) beam splitter was set to recover fluorescence up to 535 nm. Alexa Fluor 568/594 and ATTO
565 were excited with a 555 nm laser and the VSD was set to recover fluorescence up to 615 nm.
DAPI was excited with a 405 nm laser and the VSD was set to recover fluorescence up to 626 nm,
with the additional use of a short pass SP490 eliminating wave lengths > 490 nm. Images were
acquired with 40x or 63x objectives at variable resolutions, depending on their intended use, with a
pinhole aperture of 1 airy unit. Acquisitions were either in plane or stack mode, and the images used
from stacks correspond to maximum intensity projections. The settings for the acquisition of images
shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1
are detailed in Supplementary file 1: Tables S3. All images used for fluorescence quantification
were acquired with the 40x objective, and the resolution chosen (512 � 512) corresponded to a
compromise between image quality and acquisition time. All were acquired in stack mode and quan-
tification performed on maximum intensity projections. The absence of potential biases induced by
image acquisition at distinct resolution for fluorescence quantification has been verified as described
in the next section.
For constructing Figures 1, 2 and 3, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure sup-
plement 1, as well as for selecting all cells where the fluorescence has been quantified, raw images
were processed using ImageJ software version 1.50c4. The overall intensity of green and red signals
was adjusted for each individual image up to the limit where the green and red auto-fluorescence of
the cell wall, cytoplasm and nuclei of the xylem and mesophyll cells visually disappeared (the FBNSV
being phloem-restricted, it does not invade xylem and mesophyll cells). Individual cells in phloem
bundles were considered containing a segment when either green or red fluorescence (or both)
could be visualized above background. Above-background fluorescence was never observed in non-
phloem cells, consistent with the phloem restriction of this virus.
Infection by FBNSV distorts the anatomy of the phloem tissues and so distinguishing between
phloem parenchyma cells, companion cells and sieve elements is difficult and sometimes impossible
in our petiole cross-sections. For this reason, and because we were primarily interested by cells
where the viral DNA replicates (ssDNA viruses replicate and accumulate in the nucleus of their host
cells), we quantified the fluorescence only in those cells where a nucleus was clearly revealed by the
DAPI staining, so in cells other than the sieve tubes. The DAPI staining allowed to precisely encircle
the nucleus, and thus to define an ovoid corresponding area in each selected individual cell. Both
green and red fluorescence were then quantified for each pixel within this area and the average pixel
fluorescence intensity was estimated. This gave one average intensity value (in arbitrary fluorescence
units) for green and one for red fluorescence in each selected individual cell within an infected peti-
ole and all quantitative results are provided in Supplementary file 2: Table S4.
Reliability of the quantification of fluorescence within individual cells of
infected petioles
As indicated above, the setting of the confocal microscope was adjusted depending on the planned
ulterior use of images. For example, to prepare Figure 1, the plane mode, higher resolution
(>512�512) and higher magnification (63x objective) were generally preferred. In contrast, for fluo-
rescence quantification, the stack mode and maximum intensity projection images appeared best
appropriate in order to capture the whole fluorescence of the nuclei. For obvious practical reasons,
the numerous images needed for quantification were acquired more rapidly at the feasible resolu-
tion of 512 � 512, and with a lower magnification (40x objective) in order to screen microscopy fields
potentially allowing the scoring of more segment-containing cells (examples of such images are
shown in Figure 1B, and Figure 3A). We wished to confirm that different resolution settings do not
differentially affect green and red fluorescence. Another potential concern was the time spanning

 between microscopy slide preparation and the end of the observation/quantification. Due to the
experimental design, it was important to confirm that the stability of red and green probes was simi-
lar and that a possible differential degradation could not bias our localization and correlation/regres-
sion analysis.
We first quantified the fluorescence of R1-Green and R2-Red probes in petiole N˚43 with fast
acquired images (resolution 512 � 512). We then repeated the observation 2 weeks later on the
same microscopy slides with a resolution 1024 � 1024. The cells quantified at the two dates were
not necessarily the same as we could not be sure to retrieve all of them. The regression analysis
from these two sets of images gave remarkably similar results, demonstrating that the resolution set-
ting and the aging of the preparation could only have negligible effect (if at all) on our conclusions.
Results from these controls are shown as Figure 2—figure supplement 1.
Statistical analysis
Linear regression analyses were performed with the JMP 13.2.0 software. Each petiole was analyzed
separately. We did not analyze the fluorescence quantification data set as a whole (pooling cells
from distinct petioles) because the virus-associated fluorescence intensity is not directly comparable.
The total viral load varies in between distinct petioles because of a ‘natural’ variance across infected
plants and because some were harvested at different dpi. The auto-fluorescence of the infected tis-
sues also varied across petioles because of the time of infection, the total viral load and presumably
other unknown factors.
The proportion of cells containing both S and R segments, both S segment and M-Rep protein,
or both R segment and M-Rep protein (Figure 3C, Supplementary file 1: Table S1) was analyzed
with Generalized linear models (GLM) with ‘treatment’ (S segment – R segment/S segment – M-Rep/
R segment – M-Rep) as a categorical explanatory factor, and a quasi-binomial error type. The GLM
model was computed using R software 3.1.3. The name of each statistical test and its outcome is
indicated in the text and figure legends.
