Abstract
Metabolism of nicotine by cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6)
is a suspected determinant of smoking dose and, consequently,
lung cancer risk. We conducted a genome-wide association
study (GWAS) of CYP2A6 activity, as measured by the urinary
ratio of trans-30-hydroxycotinine and its glucuronide conjugate
over cotinine (total 3HCOT/COT), among 2,239 smokers in
the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study. We identified 248
CYP2A6 variants associated with CYP2A6 activity (P < 5 �
10�8). CYP2A6 activity was correlated (r ¼ 0.32; P < 0.0001)
with total nicotine equivalents (a measure of nicotine uptake).
When we examined the effect of these variants on lung cancer
risk in the Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung
(TRICL) consortium GWAS dataset (13,479 cases and 43,218
controls), we found that the vast majority of these individual
effects were directionally consistent and associated with an
increased lung cancer risk. Two hundred and twenty-six of the
248 variants associated with CYP2A6 activity in the MEC were
available in TRICL. Of them, 81% had directionally consistent
risk estimates, and six were globally significantly associated
with lung cancer. When conditioning on nine known function-
al variants and two deletions, the top two SNPs (rs56113850 in
MEC and rs35755165 in TRICL) remained significantly asso-
ciated with CYP2A6 activity in MEC and lung cancer in TRICL.
The present data support the hypothesis that a greater CYP2A6
activity causes smokers to smoke more extensively and be
exposed to higher levels of carcinogens, resulting in an
increased risk for lung cancer. Although the variants identified
in these studies may be used as risk prediction markers, the
exact causal variants remain to be identified. Cancer Res; 76(19);

Introduction
Globally, lung cancer is both the most common cancer and the
leading cause of cancer-related deaths (1). Even though smoking
is the primary cause of lung cancer, there is growing evidence for
the involvement of genetics in the susceptibility to this disease.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over
ten genetic regions associated with lung cancer risk, which, com-
bined, explain only a modest fraction of lung cancer heritability
(8%; ref. 2). Expanding GWAS datasets should continue to yield
new lung cancer susceptibility loci. However, it is also estimated
that genetic determinants of smoking behavior account for a
greater percentage (24%) of lung cancer's heritability (2). Indeed,
there is growing evidence that tobacco carcinogen uptake by
smokers and, consequently, lung cancer risk is strongly affected
by two genetically determined traits: nicotine dependence and
self-dosing of nicotine.
GWAS have demonstrated that variation at chromosome
15q25.1, which includes the nicotinic receptor subunit genes
CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4, is the strongest susceptibility
locus for nicotine dependence and lung cancer (3–5). These
studies
have
particularly
highlighted
the
role
of
SNP
rs16969968, which results in a functional CHRNA5 variant
(D398N). Smokers with this variant have been shown to not
only smoke more cigarettes but also to uptake more nicotine and
carcinogens per cigarette (6).

 Fewer large studies have focused on the metabolism of
nicotine, as a determinant of smoking dose and lung cancer
risk. Cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6)-catalyzed C-oxidation
accounts for at least 75% of nicotine metabolism (7). Nicotine
is metabolized into cotinine (COT), which is further metabo-
lized to trans-30-hydroxycotinine (3HCOT) primarily by the
same enzyme. 3HCOT is further metabolized by glucuronida-
tion, and quantifying the sum of 3HCOT and its glucuronide
conjugate, referred to as "total 3HCOT," captures the total
conversion of cotinine to 3HCOT. The ratio of total 3HCOT
to COT has traditionally been used to assess CYP2A6 activity
(8). Differences in the rate of nicotine metabolism have been
shown to contribute to interindividual variation in smoking
behavior (9, 10) and, consequently, lung cancer risk (11–13).
In order to achieve the desired psycho-pharmacologic effects of
nicotine, smokers have been shown to adjust their cigarette
consumption to maintain stable levels of nicotine in the
circulation (14). A slower nicotine metabolism rate causes the
individual to smoke less extensively (i.e., smoke fewer cigar-
ettes per day (CPD) and/or extract lower nicotine dose per
cigarette) to reach the same plasma nicotine level as an indi-
vidual who metabolizes nicotine more rapidly (Fig. 1; ref. 15).
Smoking less extensively results in a lower exposure to tobacco
smoke–derived carcinogens and, hence, likely to a lower risk of
developing lung cancer. While genetic variation in CYP2A6 has
been shown to influence smoking behavior (2), to date, GWAS
have not identified CYP2A6 as a risk variant for lung cancer.
We report here on a large genome-wide investigation of the
genetic variants affecting CYP2A6 activity among smokers in the
Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study (16) and on their associations
with lung cancer risk in the largest GWAS dataset available to date
for this disease, the Transdisciplinary Research In Cancer of the
Lung (TRICL) consortium (17). These two agnostic association
studies, one of a biomarker trait that affects the primary exposure
and the other of the disease itself, allowed us to empirically
consider biological plausibility and internal validity, in addition
to the usual GWAS criteria for independence of effects and
genome-wide statistical significance, in interpreting each variant's
association with lung cancer.
Methods for the MEC smokers GWAS
Study population
The MEC is a prospective cohort study that investigates
lifestyle and genetic risk factors for cancer and other chronic
diseases (16). The MEC is comprised of 215,251 men and
women ages 45 to 75 at baseline and includes five ethnic/racial
groups: African Americans and Latinos mostly from Los
Angeles, and Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, and
Whites, mostly from Hawaii. Potential participants were iden-
tified from drivers' license files, voter registration lists, and
Health Care Financing Administration files. Each participant
entered the study between 1993 and 1996 by returning a self-
administered
questionnaire
detailing
demographics,
diet,
smoking, medical history, and other lifestyle factors.
Approximately 10 years after cohort entry, MEC participants
were requested to provide a blood sample and an overnight urine
collection in Hawaii or first morning urine sample in California.
At that time, they also completed a questionnaire recording the
number of cigarettes smoked per day during the past two weeks,
and a record of current medications. The overnight urine collec-
tion in Hawaii started between 5 and 9 pm and included all urine
passed during the night, as well as the first morning urine. Urine
collections at both study sites were kept on ice until processing.
Aliquots were subsequently stored in a �80�C freezer until
analysis. The Institutional Review Boards at the University of
Hawaii, the University of Southern California, and the University
of Minnesota approved the present study. All MEC participants in
the MEC Biospecimen Subcohort who were current smokers at the
time of urine collection and cancer-free at selection (N ¼ 2,393)
were included in this study.
Phenotypes
Total and free nicotine, COT, and 3HCOT in urine were
analyzed by LC/MS/MS in a 96-well plate format using methods
previously described (18). For the analysis of total 3HCOT, the
samples were treated with b-glucuronidase prior to analysis. The
coefficients of variation among 10 blinded replicates of 22 sam-
ples were 16.7% for total nicotine, 10.1% for total cotinine, and
11.4% for total 3HCOT. The main phenotype of interest, CYP2A6
activity, was assessed from the ratio of total 3HCOT to COT. To
account for dose, total nicotine equivalents (TNE), which is the
sum of nicotine and its metabolites (total nicotine, total cotinine,
and total 30-hydroxycotinine, including their glucuronides), and
nicotine N-oxide were used for adjustment in analyses as
described earlier (18). Individuals with a TNE less than 1.4
nmol/mL (n ¼ 80) were excluded from this analysis.
Genotyping and quality control
Blood leukocyte DNA samples were genotyped using the Illu-
mina Human1M-Duo BeadChip (1,199,187 SNPs). Quality con-
trol procedures were applied to the genotyping data as previously
described (19). Imputation of untyped variants included in the
1000 Genomes Project (http://www.1000genomes.org/) was per-
formed using SHAPEIT (20) and IMPUTE2 (21) using a cosmo-
politan reference panel (all groups included). Post imputation, we
included SNPs with an IMPUTE2 info score of �0.30 and minor
allele frequency (MAF) >1% in any MEC ethnic group in our
Figure 1.
Causal model in smokers. In order to achieve the desired psycho-pharmacologic
effects of nicotine, smokers adjust their cigarette consumption to maintain
stable levels of nicotine in the circulation. A high nicotine metabolism rate, as
measured by the urinary ratio of trans-30-hydroxycotinine and its glucuronide
conjugate over cotinine (total 3HCOT/COT), causes the individual to smoke
more extensively (i.e., smoke more cigarettes per day and/or extract a greater
nicotine dose per cigarette) to reach the same plasma nicotine level as an
individual who metabolizes nicotine less rapidly. Smoking more extensively
results in a greater exposure to tobacco smoke carcinogens and, hence, likely to
a higher risk of developing lung cancer.

 association testing. A total of 2,239 study participants with
complete genotype and phenotype data, and 11,892,802 SNPs/
indels (1,131,426 genotyped and 10,761,376 imputed) were
included in the GWAS analysis of CYP2A6 activity (ratio of total
3HCOT to COT).
Statistical analysis
Least-square means (or geometric means) were estimated and
compared between populations for the smoking variables. Prin-
cipal components (PC) were estimated using 19,059 randomly
selected autosomal SNPs with frequency � 2% in the combined
multiethnic sample. The 10 leading eigenvectors from this matrix
were included in the analysis to adjust for population stratification
(22). The per allele association of each SNP/indel with geometric
mean CYP2A6 activity levels was evaluated using linear regression
models, with adjustment for age at the time of urine collection, sex,
self-reported ethnicity, TNE, body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), and
thefirst10principalcomponentsdescribedabove.APvaluecut-off
of 5 � 10�8 was used to establish genome-wide significance (23).
Ethnic-specific analyses were also performed to search for loci that
may be important in individual populations. To determine the
relative importance of multiple SNPs in a region or genome-wide,
we used multiple regression methods. All SNPs showing globally
significant associations were allowed to compete in forward selec-
tion regression models, and all variables that entered with a
significance level of P < 0.001 were retained (19). This allowed
us to estimate the number of independent signals that may be
involved in each region associated with each phenotype of interest.
R2 value was used to assess the percentage of variation of CYP2A6
activity accounted for by the variants examined.
Methods for the TRICL Lung Cancer GWAS
Consortium
Study population
The association study with lung cancer risk was conductedusing
the GWAS data assembled by the TRICL consortium. The overall
study design and methods for TRICL have been described in detail
elsewhere for most studies (17). The meta-analysis was based on
summarydatafrom 19GWAS undertaken by eightanalyticcenters
providing genotype data on 13,479 patients with lung cancer and
43,218 controls of European descent: the MD Anderson Cancer
Center lung cancer study (24); the NCI lung cancer GWAS includ-
ing the Environment and Genetics in Lung Cancer Etiology
(EAGLE) study (25) and the Prostate, Lung, Colon, Ovary Screen-
ing Trial (PLCO; ref. 26); the International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) lung cancer GWAS (5) including Central Europe
GWAS (27); the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET)
cohort lung cancer GWAS (28); the HUNT2/Tromso 4 study
(29); several lung cancer GWAS studies from Central Europe and
France (30); the lung cancer study from Estonia (31); the German
Lung Cancer Study (GLC; ref. 32); the Greater Toronto Area lung
cancer study (ref. 5; 331 cases and 499 controls); and the Icelandic
Lung Cancer Study (deCODE; 1,319 cases and 26,380 controls;
ref. 3). Each TRICL study requested from each smoker (defined as
individuals who smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their life) the
number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years
smoked. Pack years was then calculated as cigarettes per day/20
times number of years smoked. Lung cancer diagnosis was based
on histopathology or cytology. A written informed consent was
obtained from each participant, and this study was approved by
the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Hawaii and
University of Southern California. The lung cancer GWAS were
approved by each of the participating institutions.
Genotyping and quality control
Standard quality control on samples was performed on all
scans, excluding individuals with low call rate (<90%) and
extremely high or low heterozygosity (P < 1.0 � 10�4), as well
as all individuals evaluated to be of non-European ancestry (using
the HapMap phase II CEU, JPT/CHB, and YRI populations as a
reference). In each study, genotyping was performed using the
Illumina HumanHap 300 BeadChips, HumanHap550, or 610
Quad arrays. Untyped SNPs were imputed using the IMPUTE2
(21), MACH1 (33) or minimac (34) software, and HapMap
Phase II, Phase III, and/or 1000 Genome Project data release
2010–08 or 2010–06 reference genotypes. Imputation uncertain-
ty was accounted for by using posterior means or allele dosage in
logistic regression (17). The meta-analysis of imputed genotypes
included all studies. Poorly imputed SNPs defined by an RSQR <
0.30 with MACH1/minimac or an information measure Is < 0.40
with IMPUTE2 were excluded from the analyses. A subset of
12,000 ancestry markers was used to calculate principal compo-
nents to estimate genetic ancestry using EIGENSTRAT (35). These
PCs of genetic ancestry were included in regression models to
adjust for potential population stratification.
Statistical methods
To estimate the association between each SNP and risk of lung
cancer, genotyped or imputed allele dosage for each SNP was
tested for association in unconditional logistic regressions assum-
ing an additive genetic model for the effect of risk allele. Each
study center provided summary statistics from the initial model
which were adjusted for age, sex, country/study center, and PCs of
genetic ancestry. A secondary model using only ever smokers was
fit and further adjusted for pack-years. A meta-analysis under fixed
and random-effects models was conducted. The regression esti-
mates were combined across studies using inverse-variance
weighted, fixed-effect meta-analysis using METAL, a tool for
meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans (36). The
Cochran Q statistic was used to test for heterogeneity and to
quantify the proportion of the total variation due to hetero-
geneity. Quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plots of association test
statistics showed minimal over–dispersion consistent with lim-
ited cryptic population stratification between cases and con-
trols. Conditional analysis for lung cancer risk in the TRICL data
was performed using Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis
(GCTA) based on summary statistics (37).
Results
Selected characteristics of the 2,239 MEC smokers (437
Whites, 364 African Americans, 453 Latinos, 674 Japanese
Americans, and 311 Native Hawaiians) included in the GWAS
analysis of CYP2A6 activity are presented in Table 1. As
reported previously, significant differences were observed
among ethnic groups in cigarettes per day and TNE, with Whites
reporting smoking the highest and Latinos the lowest number
of CPD during the previous 2 weeks (18, 19). In contrast, mean
TNE (a marker of total nicotine uptake) was highest in African
Americans and lowest among Japanese Americans. Significant
differences in mean-adjusted CYP2A6 activity levels were noted

 across populations, with Japanese Americans having signifi-
cantly lower levels compared with any other ethnic group.
Overall, the correlation between CYP2A6 activity and TNE
adjusted for age, sex, race, and BMI was 0.31 (P < 0.0001),
and this correlation was not affected when further adjusted for
CPD (r ¼ 0.32; P < 0.0001).
In the GWAS analysis of CYP2A6 activity among the MEC
smokers, there was little evidence of genomic inflation in the test
statistic inthe overall sample (l ¼ 1.0).Wefound251 variantswith
globally significant associations with CYP2A6 activity at P < 5 �
10�8. All but three were located in a 41.1–41.5 Mb region encom-
passing the CYP2A6 gene on chromosome 19q13.2, encoding for a
family of cytochrome P450 enzymes (Supplementary Table S1).
The three other variants associated with CYP2A6 activity were
located near the gene MTDH on chromosome 8q22.1. However,
these three variants together explain far less of the variability of
CYP2A6 activity than the variants near CYP2A6, and we do not
focus on these here.
Of the 248 globally significant SNP associations with
CYP2A6 activity on chromosome 19, 226 (202 imputed, 22
genotyped) were available in the TRICL GWAS dataset and were
the focus of our analyses onwards (Supplementary Table S2).
Through forward regression analysis of the 226 variants in the
MEC cohort, we identified 13 independent signals; together,
these 13 SNPs explain 13.6 % of variability in CYP2A6 activity
(Table 2) in the MEC smokers. The strongest of these associa-
tions is with rs56113850, which on its own explains 6.2% of
variability in CYP2A6 activity.
When the forward selection analysis was performed separately
for each of the five ethnic groups, we found the number of
independent signals to range from one to eight; among Japanese
Americans, eight independent signals were found to explain
27.9% of variability in CYP2A6 activity, whereas three signals
explained 24% of variability among Latino Americans and two
signals each explained 14.5% and 11.6% of variability in CYP2A6
activity among African Americans and Whites, respectively. A
single SNP explained 9.1% of variability noted in CYP2A6 activity
in Native Hawaiians. In all ethnic groups, our most significant
SNP (rs56113850) entered the stepwise regression model with
level P < 0.001 explaining from 3.4% (in Japanese Americans) to
18.4% (in Latinos) of the variability of CYP2A6 activity in each
group. Further, this was the only SNP in the ethnic-specific
analyses that was significantly associated with CYP2A6 activity
at the genome-wide level in all ethnic groups.
We next tested the associations of the SNPs affecting CYP2A6
activity in the MEC smokers with lung cancer risk in TRICL.
Characteristics of the TRICL participants are presented in Supple-
mentary Table S3. Of the 226 overlapping SNPs, 186 (81%) were
also directionally consistent in the TRICL dataset, meaning that
the allele associated with increased CYP2A6 activity in MEC had a
lung cancer odds ratio >1.0 in the TRICL data. In an analysis of the
TRICL GWAS data adjusted for age, sex, country (if applicable),
and PCs, 6 among the 226 SNPs tested were globally significantly
associated with lung cancer at P < 5 � 10�8 (Figs. 2 and 3;
Supplementary Table S2); all six of these variants were also found
to be strongly associated with levels of CYP2A6 activity in the MEC
GWAS and with a direction that was consistent with the expected
effect on lung cancer risk (Table 3). We note all six of these SNPs
are highly correlated with each other among Whites with correla-
tions above 0.83. The Q–Q plot indicates that this region as a

 whole is associated with lung cancer with a greater strength of
association than expected by chance (Figs. 2 and 3). By far, the
strongest association for lung cancer risk was with rs35755165 at
P ¼ 3.45 � 10�12 (Table 3). This SNP was also significantly
associated with CYP2A6 activity levels at P ¼ 6.16 � 10�15.
Likewise, rs56113850 (the strongest single SNP predictor of
CYP2A6 activity) was the second strongest predictor of lung
cancer risk and was in modest linkage disequilibrium (LD) with
the top SNP associated with lung cancer rs35755165 (r2 ¼ 0.47).
No other SNP in the region, beyond the 226 SNPs of interest, was
associated with lung cancer in TRICL with a P value less than 4.6 �
10�8. When the TRICL analysis was restricted to ever smokers and
additionally adjusted for smoking status and pack-years, the six
significant SNPs were no longer as strongly associated; and only
two variants remained nominally significant. The most significant
association was with rs113029345 at P ¼ 0.039 (Table 3). When
the analysis was stratified by lung cancer cell type, the P values
were lower for all SNPs for both adenocarcinoma and squamous
cell carcinoma (Supplementary Table S4). For squamous cell
carcinoma, the lowest P value (0.006) was observed with
rs113029345. As expected, an analysis restricted to never smokers
did not yield any significant association for these six SNPs (all P's >
0.35; data not shown).
In the MEC smokers, we were able to impute (info score � 0.7)
the following "functional" variants previously reported to be
associated
with
CYP2A6
activity
(38):
rs1137115
(�1A),
rs1801272 (�2), rs28399433 (�9), rs28399435 (�14), rs28399454
(�17), rs28399468 (�8), rs5031016 (�7), rs61663607 (�1H), and
the recently reported functional SNP rs4803381 (also denoted
rs150298687) by Bergen and colleagues (39). We also considered
two deletions, CYP2A6�4 and CYP2A6�12, that were genotyped
separately using TaqMAN assay CYP2A6-Hs07545274_cn and
CYP2A6-Hs07545275_cn, respectively (40). Among Whites, we
found two of the previously reported functional variants to be in
LD with the TRICL top SNP (rs35755165) and the MEC smokers
top SNP (rs56113850). The functional variants rs1137115
(CYP2A6�1A)
and
rs4803381
were
in
modest
LD
with
rs35755165 in Whites (r2 ¼ 0.37 and 0.46, respectively; Sup-
plementary Table S5). Likewise, rs1137115 (CYP2A6�1A) and
rs4803381 were also correlated with rs56113850 among Whites
(r2 ¼ 0.47 and 0.62, respectively). We conducted a conditional
analysis on our top variants, rs56113850 (for MEC) and
rs35755165 (for TRICL), conditioning on each of the nine
known functional CYP2A6 variants and two deletions. For
rs56113850, when conditioning on either rs28399433 (�9) or
rs4803381, the strength of the association with CYP2A6 activity
was weakened slightly (from P ¼ 1.19 � 10�50 to P ¼ 1.32 �
10�38 and 2.61 � 10�36, respectively). For rs35755165, adjust-
ing for rs4803381 had the greatest impact on the significance of
the association with CYP2A6 activity (P reduction from 3.22 �
10�9 to 1.71 � 10�6). We performed a similar conditional
analysis for lung cancer risk in the TRICL data (using GCTA
based on summary statistics; ref. 41) conditioning on each
of
the
four
functional
variants
(rs4803381,
rs1137115,
rs28399433, and rs61663607) and found that both rs5611850
and rs35755165 remained strongly statistically significant,
with the greatest effects noted when conditioning on rs4803381
(P ¼ 3.95 � 10�8, for rs35755165, and P ¼ 9.32 � 10�7 for
rs5611850).

 Discussion
In a multiethnic population of smokers participating in the
MEC Biospecimen Sub-Cohort, we identified a large number of
variants in the CYP2A6 region that were associated at the
genome-wide significance level with CYP2A6 activity (mea-
sured by the ratio of total 3-hydroxycotinine to cotinine). We
also found that CYP2A6 activity was significantly correlated
with an increased uptake of nicotine, as measured by TNE,
supporting the hypothesis that a greater CYP2A6 activity has
the effect of making smokers smoke more extensively. When we
examined the association of these variants on lung cancer risk
in the large TRICL GWAS dataset, we found that the vast

GWAS of CYP2A6 Activity and Lung Cancer Risk

 majority of their individual effects were directionally consistent
and associated with an increased lung cancer risk, suggesting
that smokers with a high CYP2A6 activity genotype were at
greater risk of lung cancer. Indeed, a subset of six variants that
were strongly associated with CYP2A6 activity in the MEC was
also globally significantly associated with lung cancer risk in
TRICL, with effects that were directionally consistent in the two
studies.
Overall, the data presented here provide strong evidence for an
association of specific CYP2A6 variants with lung cancer risk and
that this association is primarily due to an influence on smoking
behavior rather than a direct effect on susceptibility to lung cancer.
We observed that the six SNPs that were globally associated with
lung cancer risk in the TRICL GWAS without adjusting for smok-
ing remained only marginally significant after adjustment for
smoking status and pack-years. The smallest P value was 0.039
after adjustment for smoking status and pack-years, although for
squamous cell carcinoma, the lowest P value was smaller (0.006).
We interpret this, like similar data showing that smokers with the
CHRNA5 variant uptake more nicotine and carcinogens per
cigarette (6), as suggesting that, in epidemiologic studies, residual
confounding by the effect of smoking remains when adjusting
lung cancer risk estimates for cigarettes per day or pack-years.
Accordingly, markers of CYP2A6 activity may be useful, along
with CHRNA5 genotype, in predicting risk of lung cancer among
smokers, over and beyond the exposure information captured
through standard smoking history.
We are the first to show with GWAS data that this region is
associated with risk of lung cancer, due evidently to its influence
on nicotine metabolism as measured by the CYP2A6 activity ratio.
CYP2A6 is a member of the cytochrome P450 super family
involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics. It is the primary
metabolizing enzyme for nicotine, and it has been found to
account for 75% of nicotine metabolism via C-oxidation (7).
Genetic variants in this gene may influence lung cancer risk by
modifying nicotine metabolism, and therefore smoking behavior
with specific alleles either increasing or decreasing smoking dose
and exposure to tobacco lung carcinogens (Fig. 1; refs. 6, 42, 43).
However, it should be noted that CYP2A6 variants may also affect
bioactivation of the tobacco-specific lung carcinogen, 4-(methyl-
nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)1-butanone (NNK; refs. 13, 44). Can-
didate-gene studies have shown that among Asians, CYP2A6�4,
the whole gene deletion, which has been associated with little to
no CYP2A6 enzymatic activity, is associated with a decreased risk
of lung cancer (11–13, 45, 46). In a study in Whites (47), it was
found that a genetic risk score including CYP2A6�2, �4, �9, and �12
was weakly associated with an increased lung cancer risk [wild-
type metabolizers vs. reduced metabolizers-referent; OR ¼ 1.26;
95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90–1.76; P ¼ 0.180]. Among light
smokers, the association with lung cancer reached statistical
significance (OR ¼ 1.60; 95% CI, 1.03–2.49; P ¼ 0.036;ref. 47).
A recently published GWAS and a meta-GWAS reported that
rs56113850 was globally associated with nicotine metabolism
(48, 49). Of these, in our study, only rs56113850 was strongly
associated with both CYP2A6 activity levels and lung cancer risk,
whereas rs113288603 and esv2663194 (CYP2A6 �12) were also
associated with CYP2A6 activity, but were not strongly associated
with lung cancer.
In examining the relationship of our strongest CYP2A6 activity
and lung cancer GWAS hits (rs5611850 and rs35755165) with
functional variants previously reported to be associated with
CYP2A6 activity that were imputed in both TRICL and MEC, we
further considered rs4803381, an SNP found to be associated with
reduced nicotine metabolism in a two-stage meta-analysis study
by Bergen and colleagues (39). When adjusting for each of these
imputed functional variants, our top two SNPs (rs5611850 and
rs35755165) remained significantly associated with CYP2A6
activity (all P values remained <5.8 � 10�8). Among the signif-
icant functional variants, rs4803381, previously found to be
correlated with various functional CYP2A6 haplotypes (50), had
the greatest influence on our findings with CYP2A6 activity. The
level of significance for both top hits rs56113850 and rs35755165
decreased somewhat when conditioning on rs4803381. When
performing similar conditional analyses for lung cancer risk in the
TRICL data, we found that both rs5611850 and rs35755165
remained strongly statistically significant when conditioning on
any of the same four functional variants, with the greatest effects
also noted when conditioning on rs4803381.
We were unable to clearly identify a single, or group of, CYP2A6
functional variants that entirely explained our findings. This may
be related to the limitations of the commercial GWAS arrays,
which do not systematically include coverage of copy-number
variants and translocations. However, considering the additional
copy-number genotyping conducted on the MEC smokers (40),
we found that conditioning on CYP2A6�4 or �12 only moderately
weakened our SNP findings, suggesting that the associations of
rs56113850 and rs35755165 with CYP2A6 activity are indepen-
dent of the whole or partial gene deletion, respectively. We note
that the high sequence homology across CYP2A6, CYP2A7, and
CYP2A13 may result in genotyping misclassification for these
variants. Indeed, a comparison between the same SNPs genotyped
with TaqMan assays and genotyped on the Illumina commercial
array or imputed from data using commercial array data in the
MECsmokersdatashowedonly a moderatecorrelation(r2range¼
0.62 to 0.81; ref. 40). This all suggests that while rs56113850 and
rs35755165 may be linked with one or more functional variants,
due to the inherent difficulty in genotyping this region, the causal
variants cannot be clearly identified at this time.
The present study comprises of the largest GWAS of CYP2A6
activity and the largest lung cancer GWAS dataset assembled to
date. Limitations include our inability to genotype for all of
the copy number variants in CYP2A6 that are known to affect
CYP2A6 activity, as well as our current inability to conduct lung
cancer analyses in populations other than of European ancestry.
In summary, these GWAS studies provide strong support to the
long-standing hypothesis that CYP2A6 activity levels modulate
lung cancer risk via modulation of smoking levels. We identified
specific CYP2A6 variants associated with both CYP2A6 activity (a
measure we found correlated to smoking dose) and lung cancer
risk, supporting the hypothesis that a greater CYP2A6 activity
causes smokers to smoke more extensively and be exposed to
higher levels of carcinogens, resulting in an increased risk for lung
cancer. From our data, both CYP2A6 activity and CYP2A6 geno-
type appear to capture additional exposure information, com-
pared with smoking history. Because of the difficulty in genotyp-
ing the high-homology region that includes CYP2A6, CYP2A6
activity is expected to be a stronger risk predictor than CYP2A6
genotype. In addition to identifying the exact causal variants,
studies are needed to formally test whether CYP2A6 activity and
genotype improve current lung cancer risk prediction models for
possible application in the context of low-dose computerized
tomography screening.

ham (NO1-CN-75022, Westat, Inc. NO1-CN-25476), University of Califor-
nia, Los Angeles (NO1-CN-25404). Approval for the deCODE study was
granted by the Icelandic National Bioethics Committee (ref. 12-122-V7) and
the Icelandic Data Protection Authority (refs. 2001/25 and 2006/518).
The Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort was supported by the
American Cancer Society. The NIH Genes, Environment and Health Initiative
(GEI) partly funded DNA extraction and statistical analyses (HG-06-033-
NCI-01 and RO1HL091172-01), genotyping at the Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity
Center
for
Inherited
Disease
Research
(U01HG004438
and
NIHHHSN268200782096C), and study coordination at the GENEVA Coor-
dination Center (U01 HG004446) for EAGLE and part of PLCO studies.
Funding for the MD Anderson Cancer Study was provided by NIH grants
(P50 CA70907, R01CA121197, R01 CA127219, U19 CA148127, R01
CA55769, and K07CA160753) and CPRIT grant (RP100443). Genotyping
services were provided by the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR).
CIDR is funded through a federal contract from the NIH to The Johns
Hopkins University (HHSN268200782096C). The Harvard Lung Cancer
Study was supported by the NIH (NCI) grants CA092824, CA090578, and
