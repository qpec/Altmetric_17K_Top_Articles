Summary 
Background  
The Surgical Safety Checklist is widely used to improve the quality of perioperative care. However, 
clinicians continue to debate the clinical effectiveness of this tool.  
  
Methods  
Prospective analysis of data from the International Surgical Outcomes study (ISOS), an international 
observational study of elective in-patient surgery, accompanied by a systematic review and meta-
analysis of published literature. The exposure was surgical safety checklist use. The primary outcome 
was in-hospital mortality and the secondary outcome was postoperative complications. In the ISOS 
cohort, a multivariable multi-level generalised linear model was used to test associations. To further 
contextualise these findings, we included the results from the ISOS cohort in a meta-analysis. Results 
are reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. 
 
Results 
We included 44,814 patients from 497 hospitals in 27 countries in the ISOS analysis. 40,245 (89.8%) 
patients were exposed to the checklist, whilst 7508 (16.8%) sustained ≥1 postoperative 
complications and 207 (0.5%) died before hospital discharge. Checklist exposure was associated with 
reduced mortality (OR 0.49 [0.32-0.77]; p<0.01), but no difference in complication rates (OR 1.02 
[0.88-1.19]; p=0.75). In the systematic review, we screened 3,732 records and identified 11 eligible 
studies of 453,292 patients including the ISOS cohort. Checklist exposure was associated with both 
reduced postoperative mortality (OR 0.75 [0.62-0.92]; p<0.01; I2=87%) and reduced complication 
rates (OR 0.73 [0.61-0.88]; p<0.01; I2=89%).  
 
Conclusions 
Patients exposed to a surgical safety checklist experience better postoperative outcomes, but this 
could simply reflect wider quality of care in hospitals where checklist use is routine.

Introduction  
More than 310 million surgical procedures are carried out worldwide every year.1 Estimates of 
morbidity and mortality vary.2-4 However, recent data suggest that ~75 million patients will 
experience a postoperative complication, leading to two million deaths each year.5,6 An important 
cause of avoidable harm is healthcare acquired illness or injury. In the United Kingdom (UK), 
perioperative adverse events account for one in six patient safety incidents,7 and as many as half are 
potentially avoidable.8 Preventable adverse events are costly in both human and financial terms. The 
UK Department of Health estimates that iatrogenic harm costs the National Health Service more 
than £1bn each year,9 and other developed countries are likely to be exposed to similar costs.  
 
Checklists are a simple and reproducible way to standardise selected aspects of patient care. The 
World Health Organisation (WHO) Surgical Safety Checklist is the most widely used surgical checklist, 
consisting of 19 items in three domains: before induction of anaesthesia, before surgical incision, 
and before the patient leaves the operating theatre. Actions include checks for a variety of items 
including patient identity, introducing all team members, and antibiotic prophylaxis.10 Since it’s 
inception, the checklist has been adopted in more than 4000 hospitals worldwide,11 and is now 
considered a surrogate marker for quality of patient care.12 However, there is only limited evidence 
of any effect of checklist use on health outcomes.12 A previous meta-analysis reported insufficient 
high-quality evidence to draw robust conclusions, but there have been further studies since this 
publication.12,13 Meanwhile, the clinical effectiveness of the surgical safety checklist remains unclear 
and some clinicians object to its use.14,15  
 
In the recent International Surgical Outcomes Study (ISOS) we collected prospective data describing 
surgical safety checklist use, along with patient outcomes following elective in-patient surgery in 27 
countries.6 Given the apparent widespread and growing use of the surgical safety checklist and the 
 4 
 
need for further evidence, we performed a prospective analysis of the effects of checklist exposure 
on postoperative patient outcomes. To contextualise the results of this analysis and to describe the 
current evidence for this intervention, we included these findings in a systematic review and meta-
analysis of the published literature.

Methods 
This was a pre-planned secondary analysis of prospectively collected data as part of ISOS. To 
complement this we conducted a systematic review of the existing literature and a meta-analysis, in 
which we included the results of ISOS analysis. 
 
ISOS analysis: design, setting and participants  
ISOS was a seven-day international cohort study, the main results of which have been reported 
previously.6 In the UK, the study was approved by the Yorkshire & Humber Research Ethics 
Committee (Reference: 13/YH/0371). In other countries, regulatory requirements varied with some 
requiring research ethics approval and some requiring only data governance approval. The inclusion 
criteria were all adult patients (age ≥18 years) undergoing elective surgery with a planned overnight 
stay in hospital. Each participating country selected a single data collection week between April and 
August 2014. Patients undergoing emergency surgery, day-case surgery or radiological procedures 
were excluded. During the one-week study period, data were collected for consecutive patients until 
hospital discharge, using standardised paper case record forms. Data included baseline demographic 
information, details of the surgical procedure, postoperative care and in-hospital postoperative 
clinical outcomes. The use of the surgical safety checklist was collected by study investigators at 
each site as part of the core dataset. Data were censored at 30 days following surgery for patients 
who remained in hospital. Data were anonymised and entered onto a purpose-built secure internet 
database, which included automated checks for plausibility, consistency and completeness.  
 
ISOS analysis: outcome measures 
The primary outcome measure for the analysis of the ISOS cohort was in-hospital mortality. The 
secondary outcome measure was the presence of any postoperative in-hospital complication 
assessed according to predefined criteria.6,16 A patient with any of the following complications was 
 6 
 
deemed to have met the secondary outcome: surgical site infection, body cavity infection, 
pneumonia, urinary tract infection, blood stream infection, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, 
pulmonary oedema, pulmonary embolism, stroke, cardiac arrest, gastro-intestinal bleed, acute 
kidney injury, postoperative bleed, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), anastomotic leak or 
other un-categorised complications.  The severity of complications was graded as mild, moderate or 
severe.16  
 
ISOS analysis: statistical methods 
Data were included for hospitals returning valid data for ≥20 participants, and countries with at least 
ten participating hospitals. We dichotomised the sample according to the presence or absence of 
surgical safety checklist use and presented baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. The 
outcomes were considered as binary categorical variables. In the primary analysis, we assessed for 
associations between exposure to a surgical safety checklist and postoperative mortality, compared 
to no exposure to a surgical safety checklist, before and after adjustment for potential confounding 
factors. For the adjusted analysis, we used a hierarchical two-level generalised linear model, with 
patients at the first level and hospitals at the second level; a three-level model with countries at the 
third level did not converge. We included the following pre-specified covariates to adjust for 
potential confounding: age, gender, current smoker, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 
physical status score, grade of surgery, surgical procedure category, and presence of co-morbid 
disease (coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease/asthma, cirrhosis, metastatic cancer, stroke and other unspecified chronic disease). These 
covariates were selected for clinical plausibility and evidence of association with the exposure or 
outcomes in previous epidemiological research.4,17-19 The results are presented as odds ratios (OR) 
with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and associated Wald p-values. The primary analysis was repeated 
for in-hospital complications as the secondary outcome measure, considered as a binary categorical 
variable using a three-level generalised linear model, with patients at the first level, hospitals at the 
 7 
 
second and countries at the third level. Normally distributed continuous variables are presented as 
mean with standard deviation (SD), non-normally distributed continuous variables are presented as 
median with interquartile range (IQR), and proportions are presented as n (%). We used STATA 
version 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, USA) for the statistical analysis. 
 
ISOS analysis: sensitivity analyses 
We were interested to assess whether countries with high checklist usage, as a proportion of the 
total number of patients (i.e. checklist compliance), were more likely to have lower risk of in-hospital 
mortality or postoperative complications. We calculated checklist compliance by country as the 
proportion of patients in each country that were exposed to the checklist. We ranked countries by 
compliance and divided the sample into four similarly sized quartiles, with quartile one representing 
lowest compliance and quartile four representing highest compliance. We repeated the primary 
analysis using quartiles of checklist compliance as the exposure of interest, using a deviation 
contrast where the mean compliance for the whole cohort was treated as the reference category. 
Secondly, to identify whether a relationship between checklist use and postoperative complications 
or mortality differed according to income status of the country of origin, we stratified the sample by 
country income status (high income or low and middle income), according to the World Bank 
definition and repeated the analysis.20  
 
Evidence synthesis: systematic review and meta-analysis 
We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature describing the 
effects of surgical safety checklist use on patient outcomes, including the results of the ISOS study. 
We prospectively registered the systematic review with PROSPERO (2016:CRD42016039878). The 
primary outcome was mortality, which we expected to be the most frequently reported outcome 
measure. The secondary outcome was postoperative complications. Definitions of complications for 
included studies are presented in Supplementary table 1. We searched MEDLINE, The Cochrane 
 8 
 
Library, EMBASE and CINAHL for the years 2009 to 2017 using Healthcare Database Advanced Search 
(hdas.nice.org.uk). We scanned the bibliographies of included studies and consulted experts to 
identify studies that were missed by the search. Full details of the search strategy are provided in 
supplementary table 2. We extracted records to Mendeley (London, UK) to sort and remove 
duplicates. Two investigators (MP and AF) independently reviewed each record by title and abstract. 
Papers identified as potentially relevant were reviewed in full. Papers were selected for inclusion if 
they described the use of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist in adult patients (>18 years) undergoing 
surgery, and reported either complications or mortality as postoperative outcomes. We did not 
include studies where the surgical safety checklist was tested with another intervention or where 
the checklist was modified.21 Differences in opinion were resolved through discussion and referred 
to a third investigator (MG). Data were extracted from the selected papers by two independent 
investigators (MP and AF) to a pre-formatted Excel worksheet (Microsoft, Redmond, USA). The 
meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, 
Copenhagen, Denmark). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for randomised controlled 
trials, the National Institutes of Health ‘Quality Assessment of Before-and-after studies’ tool for 
before and after studies, and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for other non-randomised studies.22-24 
Between study heterogeneity was assessed with Chi-squared and I2 tests using p<0.1 as the pre-
defined threshold for statistical significance. A random effects model was used for all analyses. 
Results are presented as OR with 95% CI, associated p-values, and forest plots.

Results 
Surgical safety checklist use in the ISOS cohort 
We included 44,814 ISOS participants from 497 hospitals in 27 countries in this analysis 
(Supplementary figure 1). Eight countries, with 134 participating hospitals, were classed as low or 
middle income nations.20 Participating hospitals had a median of 550 (329-850) beds and 21 (10-38) 
critical care unit beds. 40,245/44,814 (89.8%) patients were exposed to the surgical safety checklist, 
7508/44,814 (16.8%) sustained at least one postoperative complication and 207/44,814 (0.5%) died 
before hospital discharge (Table 1). The results of regression models for surgical safety checklist 
exposure against postoperative mortality or complications in the ISOS cohort are shown in Table 2. 
In the unadjusted analysis, exposure to the surgical safety checklist was associated with a reduction 
in mortality (OR 0.42 [0.33-0.58]; p<0.01), which remained statistically significant after adjustment 
for confounding (OR 0.49 [0.32-0.77]; p<0.01). Exposure to the checklist was not associated with a 
reduction in the incidence of postoperative complications in either the unadjusted (OR 0.99 [0.91-
1.07]; p=0.74) or the adjusted analyses (OR 1.02 [0.88-1.19]; p=0.75).  
 
Sensitivity analyses of the ISOS cohort 
When countries were ranked by compliance with the checklist, the mean compliance in the lowest 
and highest quartiles were 62.5% and 98.7% respectively (Supplementary table 3). Low checklist use 
at a national level (quartile 1) was associated with increased mortality (OR 1.80 [1.34-2.41]; p<0.01) 
and high checklist use at a national level (quartile 4) was associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.61 
[0.45-0.83]; p<0.01) (Table 3), with the whole cohort as the reference category. National rates of 
checklist use (quartile 1 and 4) were not associated with any effects on postoperative complication 
rates. When we stratified the sample by income status of the participating country and repeated the 
primary analysis, the findings remained similar (Supplementary tables 4 and 5). To further explore 
the absence of association between checklist use and reduced incidence of postoperative 
 10 
 
complications, we conducted a post-hoc sensitivity analysis to see if checklist use was associated 
with reductions in the incidences of specific severities of complications (either mild or moderate or 
severe). However, we did not identify any such associations (supplementary table 6). 
 
Systematic review and meta-analysis 
Searches identified 3,732 records. After removal of duplicates, 3,554 abstracts were screened, 41 
full-texts were reviewed and 11 studies (including ISOS) were selected for inclusion (Supplementary 
figure 2). Five studies included in previous systematic reviews were excluded because they did not 
meet our inclusion criteria.12,13 A summary of the articles included is provided in Table 4. A total of 
419,799 patients were included in the meta-analysis for mortality. 2624/230,929 (1.1%) of patients 
exposed to the checklist died, compared to 2466/188,870 (1.3%) not exposed to the checklist. In the 
random effects meta-analysis, checklist exposure was associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.75 
[0.62-0.92]; p<0.01; I2=87%) (Figure 1). The definition of mortality was ‘in-hospital’ in two studies, in-
hospital restricted to 30 days in five studies, and in-hospital restricted to 60 days in one study. In 
contrast, 12,054/161,858 (7.4%) of patients exposed to the checklist developed postoperative 
complications, compared to 6,043/123,329 (4.9%) of patients not exposed to the checklist. In the 
random effects meta-analysis, checklist exposure was associated with a reduced incidence of post-
operative complications (OR 0.73 [0.61-0.88]; p<0.01; I2=89%) (Figure 2). The meta-analysis is 
weighted according to effect size and the two biggest studies, which account for 38.2% of patients 
showed no difference in complication rates between exposed and unexposed patients. 
 
The risk of bias was low in all included studies (Supplementary table 7) and visual assessment of 
funnel plots demonstrated no evidence of publication bias. Compliance with checklist use was 
variable across studies with no pattern of changing use over time (Supplementary table 8). To 
account for the possibility that some studies in the meta-analysis included patients exposed to a 
 11 
 
modified checklist, we repeated the meta-analysis including five studies of modified surgical safety 
checklists that were excluded from the primary meta-analysis.25-29 Our findings remained similar for 
both mortality (OR 0.77 [0.64-0.91]; p<0.01; I2=83%) and complications (OR 0.71 [0.60-0.84]; p <0.01, 
I2=92%).

Discussion 
The principal finding of this research was that patients exposed to a surgical safety checklist had a 
lower incidence of postoperative complications and death when compared to patients who were not 
exposed to a checklist. These findings may reflect a higher quality of care in hospitals where checklist 
use is routine. While the data included in the meta-analyses are primarily observational, this study 
adds to the overall understanding of the surgical safety checklist, indicating that checklists are widely 
used internationally, but that in most healthcare settings it is not possible to randomise patients to 
checklist use because of existing widespread implementation. Therefore, in the absence of data 
from randomised trials, our analyses may represent the highest currently attainable level of 
evidence describing the effects of surgical safety checklist use. Future randomised trials may not be 
possible, but further research should be standardised for individual compliance with the checklist. 
The findings of the ISOS analysis, where checklist exposure was associated with reduced mortality 
but not complications, contrasted with the results of the meta-analysis. This is counterintuitive, but 
not uncommon among meta-analyses, where the results of an individual study may contrast with 
the overall weighted effect. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that across a range of studies at 
many hospitals, checklist use is associated with fewer postoperative complications and deaths. 
However, it is unlikely that it will ever be possible to prove the causality of improved patient 
outcomes associated with checklist use. 
 
Previous studies in mostly high-income countries have demonstrated associations between checklist 
use and reduced morbidity and mortality. The European Surgical Outcomes Study, conducted in 426 
European hospitals, suggested that checklist exposure was associated with a 19% reduction in the 
relative risk of in-hospital mortality, while a single centre retrospective cohort study in Chile 
identified a 27% reduction in mortality.14,30 However, there is less evidence to support checklist use 
in low or middle-income countries.28 Our analysis of the International Surgical Outcomes study is the 
 13 
 
largest study of which we are aware, to include data from both low-, middle-/high-income countries. 
Our results are therefore more widely generalisable and indicate a need for research and quality 
improvement to ensure safe and effective patient care in low- and middle-income countries. 
Examples may include rapid response systems and early warning scores.31-33 The largest study to 
evaluate the surgical safety checklist to date was a cohort study of an implementation project 
performed in acute care hospitals in Canada.34 In contrast to our results, the authors did not identify 
any benefit associated with checklist use, when comparing the three months before and after 
implementation in more than 200,000 patients. This may be due in part to pre-existing high-quality 
care at these hospitals. We included this study in our meta-analysis, which may explain, in part, the 
smaller effect estimates than observed in a previous systematic review.12 Similarly, the findings of 
the ISOS analysis contrast with the results of our meta-analysis, which identified a reduction in 
postoperative complications associated with checklist exposure. This might be explained by the high 
compliance with checklist use in the ISOS cohort (nine out of ten patients), making it harder to 
detect a difference in outcomes between exposed and non-exposed patients. Alternatively, it may 
be due to bias or heterogeneity between studies included in the meta-analysis (supplementary table 
6). 
 
This work has several strengths. This was a prospective analysis of the ISOS cohort and a prospective 
meta-analysis. ISOS is one of the largest prospective international cohort studies of surgical 
outcomes conducted to date, and in contrast to many other studies, includes data from low, middle 
and high-income countries.6 Due to the large number of patients enrolled, we were able to adjust 
the analysis for a variety of potential confounding factors. Although, as with any epidemiological 
study, we must acknowledge the potential influence of unmeasured confounding. The meta-analysis 
included more than ten times as many patients as the previous largest evidence synthesis, and the 
risk of bias was lower than in previous work.12,13 Our study also has several weaknesses. The ISOS 
investigators hoped to include a mix of hospitals from each country. However, it is impossible to say 
 14 
 
whether the results are representative of practice in any one country. This is particularly pertinent to 
low- and middle-income countries, where there was a bias towards university hospitals and away 
from smaller district hospitals. In general, we would expect hospitals that participate in research to 
offer a better standard of care, since research active hospitals tend to have superior clinical 
outcomes.35 There is likely to be heterogeneity of surgical and perioperative care and administrative 
procedures across hospitals included in the ISOS study, which may influence the results. For 
example, hospitals in some countries may discharge patients at an earlier stage of the postoperative 
pathway than others, which may influence the rates of recorded in-hospital complications. This is 
further illustrated by the variation in compliance with the checklist at a country level, where three 
quarters of countries used the checklist in >89% of cases, in contrast to wide variation in checklist 
use among countries in the lowest quartile (27-85%). However, checklist compliance – similar to the 
heterogeneity of surgical care within and between countries - is unlikely to be uniform across 
countries and the ISOS sample may not be representative of country-wide practice. Furthermore we 
did collect data on individual components of the checklist, so it is possible that some sections were 
completed more frequently than others. The meta-analysis did not include studies of staff training 
on the use of the surgical safety checklist and we did not differentiate between different types of 
complications in the analysis. The literature describing the checklist describes a variety of 
methodologies including randomised trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, 
implementation studies and natural trials. We performed a wide-ranging systematic review and 
meta-analysis to reflect the breadth of available knowledge. However, while we were able to 
increase the precision of our effect size estimates compared to previous studies, the population 
samples of included studies may be quite different, and this is reflected in the between study 
heterogeneity. An alternative approach is to undertake a meta-analysis based on one methodology 
only, for example randomised trials. This approach has been helpful, but is limited by the number of 
available studies and therefore patients.13 Given the inclusion of three large studies in the meta-
analysis, there is the potential that the results may be skewed towards findings of these studies. We 
 15 
 
were unable to adjust for potential improvements in perioperative care over time or differences in 
compliance with the checklist between or within included studies.1,36,37 While several studies have 
reported compliance rates greater than 90%, the findings of the included studies do not suggest any 
trend to improved adoption of the checklist over time.  
 
Conclusions 
The World Health Organisation and similar surgical safety checklists are simple tools, designed to 
improve the safety and quality of perioperative care. We have provided evidence that patients 
exposed to a surgical safety checklist experience better postoperative outcomes. However, it 
remains uncertain whether these associations are a direct causal effect, or if this simply reflects 
wider quality of care in hospitals where checklist use is routine.
