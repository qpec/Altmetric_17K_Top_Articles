Abstract
Background: Alpha power is believed to have an inverse relationship with
the perception of pain. Increasing alpha power through an external stimulus
may, therefore, induce an analgesic effect. Here, we attempt to modulate the
perception of a moderately painful acute laser stimulus by separately
entraining three frequencies across the alpha band: 8, 10 and 12 Hz.
Methods: Participants
were
exposed
to
either
visual
or
auditory
stimulation at three frequencies in the alpha-band range and a control
frequency. We collected verbal pain ratings of laser stimuli from
participants following 10 minutes of flashing LED goggle stimulation and
10
minutes
of
binaural
beat
stimulation
across
the
alpha
range.
Alterations in sleepiness, anxiety and negative mood were recorded
following each auditory or visual alpha-rhythm stimulation session.
Results: A significant reduction in pain ratings was found after both
the visual and the auditory stimulation across all three frequencies
compared with the control condition. In the visual group, a significantly
larger reduction was recorded following the 10-Hz stimulation than
succeeding the 8- and 12-Hz conditions.
Conclusions: This study suggests that a short presentation of auditory
and visual stimuli, oscillating in the alpha range, have an analgesic
effect on acute laser pain, with the largest effect following the 10-Hz
visual stimulation. Pain reductions following stimulation in the alpha
range are independent of sleepiness, anxiety, and negative moods.
Significance: This study provides new behavioural evidence showing
that visual and auditory entrainment of frequencies in the alpha-wave
range can influence the perception of acute pain in humans.
1. Introduction
The alpha rhythm (7–14 Hz) is the most studied fre-
quency band in the human brain, as it can be
detected in 95% of healthy young adults with their
eyes closed (Srinivasan, 1999). The alpha rhythm
has historically been described as an ‘idling’ rhythm
and was believed to represent low information pro-
cessing. However, more recent work indicates a cen-
tral role in cognitive processing, specifically the top-
down
control
of
sensory
information
(Klimesch
et al., 2007). Suppression of alpha power in the con-
tralateral
sensorimotor
and
occipital
cortices
has
been repeatedly found to be correlated with the
strength of a painful stimulus (Mouraux et al., 2003;
Ohara et al., 2004; Raij et al., 2004; Ploner et al.,
2006; Hu et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2014). Impor-
tantly, behavioural pain intensity ratings have been
directly correlated with decreases in alpha power
(Mouraux et al., 2003; Babiloni et al., 2006; Gross
et al., 2007).
Early work by Trifiletti (1984), observing that high
alpha was associated with intense analgesia, alluded
to the idea that this relationship may work both
ways. The concurrent presence of high alpha power

 during analgesia could indicate a causal relationship.
Alpha rhythms are believed to arise from the thala-
mus and subsequently transmitted through thalamo-
cortical tracts to the cortex. Alpha rhythms can,
hence, be influenced via inputs to the thalamus,
synchronizing or desynchronizing alpha oscillations
(Schmidt et al., 1985). Recent neurofeedback studies
have developed this idea and confirmed brain train-
ing to increase alpha power can lead to a long-term
reduction in chronic pain (Jensen et al., 2013). The
main disadvantage of neurofeedback is that it takes
concentration and often weeks of training to be
effective and thus is currently ineffective for acute
pain (Kayiran et al., 2010).
Visual and auditory entrainment enables almost
immediate increases in cortical alpha power through
an external pulse with a consistent frequency oscil-
lating in the alpha range (Frederick et al., 2005;
Spaak et al., 2014). Entrainment occurs when other
regions of the brain fall into lockstep with the stimu-
lated cortex, eliciting a broader increase in alpha
power (Halbleib et al., 2012; Thut et al., 2012; de
Graaf et al., 2013; Spaak et al., 2014).
While visual alpha entrainment primarily affects
the primary visual cortex with the strongest resonance
at 10 Hz (Herrmann, 2001; de Graaf et al., 2013), lit-
erature suggests that modulations in cortical activity
are widely elicited throughout the cortex (Timmer-
mann et al., 1999; de Graaf et al., 2013). Although
resting EEG records maximal alpha amplitude over
the occipital regions (Cantero et al., 2002), entrain-
ment through auditory stimulation proves just as
effective at increasing alpha power (Schwarz and Tay-
lor, 2005; Karino et al., 2006). Both visual and audi-
tory
alpha
entrainments,
thus,
prove
promising
candidates for effortless acute pain relief.
In this study, we entrained three different alpha
frequencies (8, 10 and 12 Hz) with the aim to
achieve a meaningful level of experimental pain
relief
through
either
auditory
or
visual
alpha
entrainment.
We
hypothesized
that
we
would
observe the largest reduction in pain ratings after the
10-Hz stimulation in both the visual and auditory
studies, as this is closest in frequency to the average
peak of the spectral distribution of the alpha rhythm
(Klimesch, 1997; Posthuma et al., 2001).

The

obtained ethical approval from the NRES Commit-
tee North West – Liverpool Central (reference num-
ber 13/NW/0007).
2.2 Experimental design
Participants
were
divided
into
two
experimental
groups: auditory and visual. Participants allocated to
the auditory entrainment group were asked to visit
Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust on two sepa-
rate visits. The auditory group’s visits consisted of a
separate entrainment visit and a control visit, the
order of which was randomized. A minimum of
2 weeks was left between the visits to allow the
skin to fully recover in case of mild sensitivity out-
lasting the first visit. Due to time constraints, the
visual entrainment study was condensed into one
visit with fewer overall pain sessions and a single
control condition. This was deemed suitable, as par-
ticipants were not aware of the purpose of the
study, and because the study was not designed to
make
direct
(quantitative)
comparisons
between
visual and auditory entrainment. As such, we did
not balance certain variables between the auditory
and visual experiments, such as salience of the
stimuli in each modality.
A diagram of the experimental procedure can be
seen in Fig. 1.
2.3 Participants
Sixty-four healthy (33 men, average age 24.65 � 8.2
SD),
self-reported
right-handed
volunteers
were
invited to Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust to
participate in the study. All participants volunteered
for the study after contacting the group through
advertisements placed on the University of Manch-
ester website and throughout Salford Royal NHS
Foundation Trust. Volunteers in both groups were
provided with a participant information sheet a min-
imum of 24 h prior to the first visit. Participants
were provided with a verbal and written explanation
of the laser pain applied during the study, without
revealing the aims and objectives of the study. All
volunteers were aged 18 years or older. Participants
self-reported themselves as free from a history, or
family history of epilepsy, pain, morbid psychiatric
illness, neurological illness, ischaemic heart disease,
uncontrolled high blood pressure, peripheral vascu-
lar disease, chronic skin disease (e.g. eczema and
psoriasis) and hypertension not controlled by medi-
cation. After providing written and verbal consent,

 volunteers were randomly assigned to either the
auditory or the visual entrainment group. Thirty-two
volunteers were allocated to the auditory entrain-
ment group (16 men, mean age 23.25 � 7.9 SD)
and 32 to the visual entrainment group (17 men,
mean age 25.82 � 8.6 SD).
2.4 Pre-experimental psychophysics
procedure
It has been demonstrated that a contactless activa-
tion of nociceptors related to Ad and C fibres can be
achieved through the use of a brief CO2 laser stimu-
lus (Meyer et al., 1976). In this study, the pain stim-
ulus consisted of a CO2 laser stimulus of 150-ms
duration and a beam diameter of 15 mm. This laser
was applied to the dorsal surface of the volunteers’
right forearm, firing once every 10 s. The laser beam
was moved to a new location after every pulse to
avoid sensitization, habituation or damage to the
skin. It was obligatory for participants to wear a pair
of safety goggles whenever the laser was in use.
Each visit was initiated with the calculation of the
participants’ moderately painful level with the aid of
a 0–10 numeric rating scale. Level 0 on the scale
was marked as ‘no sensation’, level 4 represented
the pain threshold, and level 10 was marked as the
maximum amount of pain they believed they could
tolerate. Participants were told to regard the sensa-
tion halfway between pain threshold and their toler-
ance level as ‘moderately painful’ and identified as
the number 7 on the pain scale. A ramping proce-
dure with increasingly powerful laser stimuli was
initiated, during which the participants were asked
to verbally rate each pulse until their level 7 was
attained. This entire procedure was repeated three

visits (control and entrainment) in a randomized order. Both visits were initiated with baseline questionnaires (Sleep Questionnaire, PCS, PHQ-9,
PASS, POMS, STAI, KSS) and the rating of 30 laser pulses at ‘level-7’ pain. In the entrainment visit, participants were subjected to 10 min of audi-
tory entrainment at 8, 10 and 12 Hz in a randomized order. Following entrainment, participants rated 30 pulses and completed the POMS, KSS
and STAI-state questionnaires. The control visit was identical to the entrainment visit, but the stimulus was 10 min of white noise, three times,
instead of alpha entrainment. (C) Procedure in the visual entrainment group. A single visit was required for participants in the visual entrainment
group. Participants completed baseline questionnaires (Sleep Questionnaire, PCS, PHQ-9, PASS, POMS, STAI, KSS) and 30 pulses of their ‘level-7’
pain. Participants were subjected to four visual (flashing LED goggle) entrainment sessions at 8, 10, 12 and 1 Hz (control), each 10 min long, in a
randomized order. Following entrainment, volunteers were subjected to 30 ‘level-7’ pulses and were asked to rate these on a 0–10 numerical rat-
ing scale. Following each pain rating session, volunteers completed the KSS, STAI-state and POMS. Qs, questionnaires; WN, white noise.

 times. Ratings of the laser intensity levels were then
tested by repeating a series of laser pulses at the vol-
unteers’ predetermined level 7. The laser voltage
was readjusted if a level 7 was not consistently
attained.
2.5 Pre-experimental questionnaires
After determining volunteers’ level 7 on the 0–10
numeric rating scale, participants were asked to com-
plete a set of behavioural questionnaires previously
demonstrated to correlate with changes in acute laser
pain (Brown et al., 2008; Morton et al., 2009) or
believed to be modulated by changes in alpha power
(Melzack and Perry, 1975; Ossebaard, 2000). These
consisted of the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Karolinska
Sleepiness Scale (KSS), Participant Sleep Question-
naire,
Pain
Catastrophizing
Scale
(PCS),
Patient
Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Pain Anxiety
Symptoms
Scale
(PASS).
The
Participant
Sleep
Questionnaire, PCS, PHQ-9 and PASS were used to
determine the volunteers’ quality of sleep, degree of
pain-related catastrophic thinking, depression and
pain-specific fear and anxiety, respectively. These
were given once at the beginning of each visit. The
POMS, STAI-state and KSS were repeated during the
experiment after each of the pain assessment trials
and are explained in more detail below.
2.6 Profile of mood states
Nine items representing negative moods were taken
from the POMS (McNair et al., 1971) to determine
participants’ degree of emotional distress, as previ-
ously described (Sullivan et al., 2001; Brown et al.,
2008). The nine emotions were divided to represent
three different mood categories: (1) sadness (sad, dis-
couraged, hopeless); (2) anger (angry, hostile, irrita-
ble)
and
(3)
anxiety
(anxious,
tense,
worried).
Participants were asked to rate the intensity of each of
the nine adjectives on a 5-point Likert scale with 0
representing ‘not at all’ and 4 ‘very much’, in relation
to their current emotional state. A composite score of
emotional distress was computed by taking the sum of
all nine items on the mood scale. Participants received
the POMS before the start of the experiment and after
each of the pain assessment trials.
2.7 State-trait anxiety inventory
The STAI consists of 20 items assessing trait anxiety
and 20 items assessing state anxiety. The state and
trait assessments of the inventory were presented to
the
volunteers
separately.
The
state
anxiety
inventory evaluates temporary nervousness, fear,
discomfort etc. (i.e. the arousal of the autonomic
nervous system), whereas the trait inventory mea-
sures prolonged feelings of stress, worry or discom-
fort. The items on both inventories are rated on a 4-
point Likert scale (from ‘almost never’ to ‘almost
always’). A higher overall score indicates greater
anxiety
(Spielberger
et al.,
1983).
Participants
received the trait inventory once in each visit, at the
start of the experiment. The state inventory was
given after each of the pain stimulus assessment tri-
als. The Inventory was used to assess whether visual
or auditory alpha entrainment influenced partici-
pants’ present state of anxiety, and if so, whether it
correlated with changes in pain perception.
2.8 Karolinska sleepiness scale
A 9-point KSS was used where 1 = very alert,
3 = alert, 5 = neither alert nor sleepy, 7 = sleepy
(but not fighting sleep) and 9 = very sleepy (fighting
sleep) (Akerstedt and Gillberg, 1990). Participants
were asked to rate the scale once, preceding the
experiment and once after each pain assessment
trial. This was done to control for any changes in the
volunteers’ alertness, and subsequent potential influ-
ence on pain perception.
2.9 Pre-experimental trial
Participants were asked to rate 30 pulses on the pain
rating scale, at 10-s intervals, of their predetermined
‘moderately painful’ level 7, in order to document
their average baseline pain ratings.
2.10 Auditory entrainment
Volunteers
allocated
to
the
auditory
stimulation
group attended two visits in a randomized order,
one control and one entrainment visit. During the
entrainment
visit,
volunteers
were
subjected
to
10 min of auditory entrainment at 8, 10 and 12 Hz
in
a
randomized
order.
Binaural
Beats
were
employed to enable auditory alpha entrainment. The
hearing range for a healthy adult is between 20 and
20,000 Hz, and thus, frequencies at 8, 10 and 12 Hz
are not audible to the human ear. Binaural beats are
produced when 2 tones close in frequency generate
a beat frequency equal to the difference in frequency
of the two tones (Wahbeh et al., 2007). For exam-
ple, volunteers in this study listened simultaneously
to 445 Hz played in one earphone, and 455 Hz
played in the other, producing a binaural beat

Alpha frequency stimulation reduces pain
 frequency of 10 Hz. Binaural beats are believed to
originate in the brainstem’s superior olivary nucleus,
where the contralateral auditory input is integrated
(Oster, 1973).
Binaural beats were produced using BrainWave
Generator
software
version
3.1.12
(http://www.
bwgen.com/) as used by Goodin et al. (2012). As
binaural beats are known to be entrained most read-
ily with a carrier frequency ranging from 300 to
600 Hz (Reedijk et al., 2013) with the greatest effect
between 450 and 500 Hz (Perrott and Nelson, 1969;
Oster, 1973), all entrainment sessions used a 450-Hz
carrier frequency. Presenting 446- and 454-Hz, 445-
and 455-Hz, 444- and 456-Hz tones in the left and
right ears created 8-, 10- and 12-Hz binaural beats,
respectively. All frequencies were presented to par-
ticipants at 70 dB SPL, as previously done by Stevens
et al. (2003). Participants were asked (at the end of
their involvement in the study) whether they were
able to differentiate between the 8-, 10- and 12-Hz
frequency entrainment. None claimed to be able to
do so.
After each randomized 10-min auditory entrain-
ment session, participants were asked to rate 30
painful heat laser pulses, and subsequently requested
to complete the POMS, KSS and STAI-state, in rela-
tion to the entrainment session.
The control visit was identical to the entrainment
visit, except that the volunteers listened to white
noise for 10 min, three times, instead of 8-, 10- and
12-Hz binaural beats. Binaural beats are a relatively
high in saliency stimulus. As such, the carrier fre-
quency was not used for the control stimulus: listen-
ing to a constant tone at 455 Hz is not as salient as a
tone that fluctuates, and therefore would risk partici-
pants becoming habituated to the sound. This would
introduce an uncontrolled, confounding variable in
comparing the conditions of interest with the control
condition. By contrast, the stimulation frequency
when listening to white noise is constantly changing
over time, resulting in a higher saliency stimulus,
and therefore a better comparator to binaural beats.
2.11 Visual entrainment
Participants in the visual entrainment group were
subjected to four randomized visual entrainment
sessions at 8, 10, 12 and 1 Hz (control), each lasting
a total of 10 min. The visual stimulus consisted of a
pair of in-house made flashing LED goggles. Volun-
teers kept their eyes closed throughout the stimula-
tion, as this is just as effective, but more pleasant for
the
volunteer.
After
each
one
of
the
visual
entrainment sessions, volunteers were subjected to
30 moderately painful laser pulses at their predeter-
mined level 7, and asked to rate these on the 0–10
numerical rating scale. Following all four pain rating
trials, volunteers were asked to complete the KSS,
STAI-state and POMS. Instructions included attempt-
ing to relate the questionnaires to the preceding
entrainment session, rather than post pain rating
trial. Again, on completion of the study, the aim of
the study was revealed to the participants and partic-
ipants were asked if they were able to differentiate
between the 8-, 10- and 12-Hz frequency entrain-
ment. Again, none claimed to be able to do so.
2.12 Data analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version
20 IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0.
(IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). A p value of <0.05
was considered significant. The average pain rating for
each subject and trial was calculated. We applied a
mixed linear model to pain ratings of the 8, 10, 12 Hz
and control condition of both groups to assess the size
of the change in pain ratings compared with control.
This model took into account the baseline pain ratings
as a covariate and the frequency entrained (‘treat-
ment’), the order of the entrainment session (‘treat-
ment order’), and for the auditory group, the order of
the control/entrainment visit (‘session’) as factors.
Using each condition as a reference category, the
model was refitted with a Bonferroni correction to
assess the significant differences. The same model was
applied separately to the POMS, STAI and KSS scores,
taking into account the same respective covariates
and factors. The baseline scores of the PHQ-9, PCS,
Participant Sleep Questionnaire and PASS were corre-
lated to the changes in pain ratings from baseline in
the 8, 10, 12 Hz and control condition.
3. Results
The largest reduction in pain ratings from the control
condition could be observed after the 10-Hz entrain-
ment session in both the auditory and visual groups,
followed by the 8 Hz then the 12-Hz condition.
There were no significant changes or correlations
observed in the questionnaire scores.

Taking into account baseline pain ratings as a covari-
ate and the stimulation frequency, order of entrain-
ment, and visit order as factors, the mixed linear
model calculated that pain ratings succeeding the 8-,

 10- and 12-Hz entrainment conditions were all sig-
nificantly different from all three control conditions (t
(31) = 4.90,
p < 0.001;
t(31) = 5.61,
p < 0.001;
t
(31) = 4.85, p < 0.001, respectively). Adjusted mean
pain ratings following entrainment were, respec-
tively, 0.51(SE 0.10), 0.58 (SE 0.10) and 0.5 (SE
0.10) points lower than the control on the numeric
ratings scale (Fig. 2). No significant difference was
detected between the three auditory entrainment
conditions when refitting the model with a Bonfer-
roni correction (Table 1).
3.2 Pain ratings – visual entrainment group
The mixed linear model established that, accounting
for covariates and factors, the pain ratings in the
entrainment conditions (8, 10 and 12 Hz) were all
significantly
different
from
control
(t(31) = 2.28,
p < 0.01;
t(31) = 5.32,
p < 0.001;
t(31) = 2.59,
p < 0.01, respectively). The model-corrected pain rat-
ings of the 8-, 10- and 12-Hz conditions were on
average 0.6, 1.1 and 0.3 points lower on the pain
rating scale than the control, respectively. Addition-
ally, when refitting the model, pain ratings were sig-
nificantly different in the 10-Hz condition compared
to the 8-Hz (t(31) = 2.22 p < 0.01) and 12-Hz (t
(31) = 4.04, p < 0.001) condition. The 8- and the
12-Hz conditions did not differ from each other
(p = 0.287) (Fig. 3; Table 2).
3.3 Questionnaire results
A mixed linear model was applied to the KSS, POMS
and STAI-State scores of the 8, 10, and 12-Hz condi-
tion comparing them to the control scores. The

4. Discussion
This study investigated the effect of visual and audi-
tory entrainment (at 8, 10 and 12 Hz) on the per-
ception of a moderately painful stimulus. In both the
auditory and visual groups, all three entrainment
conditions resulted in pain ratings significantly lower
than control. As hypothesized, we found the largest
reduction in pain ratings after the 10-Hz entrain-
ment. In both groups, the 8-Hz condition was more
effective than the 12–Hz condition. However, the
visual group demonstrated slightly larger reductions
in pain ratings in the 8- and 10-Hz conditions (0.6,
1.1) compared with the auditory group (0.51, 0.58).
We
did
not
see
any
significant
correlations
between
pre-experimental
questionnaires
(Partici-
pant Sleep Questionnaire, PCS, PHQ-9, PASS) and
the change in pain ratings. Additionally, the STAI,
POMS and KSS scores did not display significant dif-
ferences between conditions, suggesting the effects
of alpha entrainment were independent of effects on
mood
and
sleepiness.
Alpha
entrainment
may,
therefore, affect cortical processes directly, indepen-
dently of mood and sleepiness.
4.1 Entrainment conditions
Across both modalities, the largest reduction fol-
lowed the 10-Hz entrainment (although inter-condi-
tion
differences
were
only
significant
in
visual
entrainment). It could be postulated that the largest
reduction in pain occurs when the frequency closest
to the volunteers’ individual alpha frequency (IAF)
increases
in
power.
It
has
been
suggested
that
entrainment is more effective if the driving stimulus
is close in frequency to the IAF (Frederick et al.,
2005). The IAF is determined by the membrane
properties of the thalamic neurons projecting to the
cortex, laying around 10 Hz (Steriade et al., 1990;
Klimesch et al., 1997; Klimesch, 1999a), varying
marginally between individuals (Klimesch, 1999a).
IAFs are lower in children and decrease again with
normal ageing (Kopruner et al., 1984; Klimesch,
1997; Posthuma et al., 2001). As the population
sampled is relatively young, the IAF of a subset
might be slightly lower. This could explain why 8 Hz
had the second-largest effect on pain reduction in
both the auditory and visual groups. Further work
acquiring electrophysiological data would be able to
establish whether an increase in alpha power closest
in frequency to the individual’s IAF or an increase in
10 Hz, unrelated to IAF, results in the largest alpha
analgesia.
4.2 Visual versus auditory
As visual and auditory entrainment paradigms were
not equivalent, changes in pain ratings have not
been
statistically
compared.
Nevertheless,
visual
entrainment
resulted
in
a
numerically
larger
decrease in pain ratings in the 8- and 10-Hz condi-
tions than the auditory entrainment. The study by
Frederick et al. (1999) found auditory stimulation
resulted in greater entrainment at the vertex than
visual stimulation. If this concept was applied to the
current results, it would imply that even though
entrainment is greater in the auditory group, visual
entrainment is more effective at reducing pain. It
must be noted that the study conducted by Frederick
et al. compared entrainment at 18.5 Hz, and there-
fore, these results may not be representative of what
is happening in this study. Additionally, increased
alpha power at the vertex may be irrelevant to the
processing of pain perception.

1-Hz control stimulation, and 8-, 10- and 12-Hz visual entrainment. (B)
The mixed linear model adjusted pain ratings, taking into account
baseline pain ratings as a covariate and the stimulation frequency and
order of entrainment as factors. Pain ratings following all three
entrainment conditions were significantly lower than control. When
refitting the model, pain ratings were significantly lower in the 10-Hz
condition compared with the 8-Hz (t(31) = 2.22 p < 0.01) and 12-Hz (t
(31) = 4.04, p < 0.001) conditions. The 8-Hz and the 12-Hz conditions
did not differ from each other (p = 0.287).

Alpha frequency stimulation reduces pain
K. Ecsy et al.
 Binaural
beats
have
demonstrated
widespread
entrainment across frontal and central sites of the
scalp (Schwarz and Taylor, 2005). Visual entrain-
ment primarily affects the primary visual cortex.
Nonetheless, entrainment in the visual cortex can
elicit changes in cortical activity widely distributed
throughout the cortex (Timmermann et al., 1999).
Furthermore, the visual cortex has the strongest res-
onance at 10 Hz (Herrmann, 2001), where the lar-
gest analgesic effect was observed.
Although alpha power is most commonly gener-
ated in thalamocortical feedback loops of excitatory
and inhibitory nerve cells (Steriade et al., 1990;
Lopes da Silva, 1991), in the visual cortex, alpha
power is also believed to be generated by cortico-cor-
tical networks (Lopes Da Silva and Storm Van Leeu-
wen, 1977; Steriade et al., 1990; Bollimunta et al.,
2008; Spaak et al., 2012) that are modulated by
attention (Yamagishi et al., 2003; Bollimunta et al.,
2011). As alpha power is commonly accepted to be
incompatible with high states of arousal, it could be
postulated that visual alpha entrainment reduces the
attention paid to the intensity of painful stimuli,
making them seem less salient than following audi-
tory entrainment. In contrast, reducing alpha activity
has been suggested to reflect alertness to external
inputs (Klimesch, 1999b) allowing the mind to be
occupied with numerous inputs, and hence allowing
the pain stimulus to feel more salient. Targeting
alpha power generated by the attention modulated
cortico-cortical networks by entraining the visual
cortex may, thus, result in better-targeted analgesia
than auditory entrainment.
Another reason why binaural beat stimulation was
not as effective at reducing pain may have been that
auditory entrainment is not very long lasting. Wah-
beh et al. (2007) saw no lasting effects 30 mins after
auditory
alpha
entrainment
at
7 Hz.
The
7-Hz
entrainment was, however, conducted with 133 and
140 pure tone carrier frequencies. Numerous studies
have demonstrated that carrier frequencies between
450 and 500 are much more effective than those
around 100 Hz (Perrott and Nelson, 1969; Oster,
1973). Nevertheless, Wahbeh et al.’s results question
the reliability of auditory entrainment.
A potential contribution to the larger effect in the
visual study could be due to the effect of distraction.
Distraction can have a significant influence on the
perception of pain (Boyle et al., 2008). Bright flash-
ing LED lights are potentially more distracting than
the soothing sound of binaural beats. Disorientating
post-entrainment effects of visual stimulation may
hinder subjects from fully attending to the pain.
However,
it
seems
unlikely
that
the
effect
of
distraction
can
produce
significant
differences
between alpha frequencies, as found in this study.
Furthermore, it is presently not possible to differenti-
ate between the effects of alpha entrainment and
distraction. They may insofar be separate mecha-
nisms, but may also interact; increasing alpha power
may increase distractibility.
4.3 Anxiety, sleepiness and negative moods
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, POMS and KSS scores
did not change after visual or auditory entrainment.
This finding suggests that alpha influences pain per-
ception independently of anxiety, wakefulness and
negative moods. Ossebaard et al. (2000) demon-
strated that after 35 min of visual alpha entrain-
ment, a significant reduction in STAI scores could be
observed (Ossebaard, 2000). In this study, there was
no evidence to suggest entrainment influenced the
volunteer’s anxiety. However, in the study con-
ducted by Ossebaard et al., initial anxiety scores
were on average higher than in our study, suggest-
ing that volunteers in our study were feeling at-ease
at the start of the experiment. Hence, a decrease in
STAI would have been difficult to detect. Addition-
ally, Ossebaard et al. entrained their volunteers for
35 min. A larger reduction in anxiety might have
been observed if the entrainment sessions were
longer and a more anxious population had been
sampled. Whether this reduction in anxiety would
have amplified the reduction in pain ratings is worth
further study.
Melzack and Perry (1975) claimed that increases
in alpha power could only influence the perception
of pain when coupled with relaxation and suggestion
(Melzack and Perry, 1975). This study demonstrates
that even without any changes in negative moods,
anxiety or sleepiness, alpha power alone has the
ability to alter the perception of acute pain. Reduc-
ing negative moods may amplify the analgesic effects
of alpha entrainment due to ensuing increased relax-
ation, rather than the other way round. A recent
study by Spaak et al. (2014) supports this notion by
demonstrating
that
alpha
rhythms
are
not
an
epiphenomenon of attentional processes, instead,
they
influence
perception
independently
(Spaak
et al., 2014).
4.4 Limitations of the design
The
STAI,
POMS
and
KSS
questionnaires
were
always provided following the pain trials to ensure
that the first and last pain stimulus was delivered

K. Ecsy et al.
Alpha frequency stimulation reduces pain
 at identical post-entrainment times. This resulted
in
the
participants
starting
the
questionnaires
5 min
post-entrainment.
Although
participants
were
asked
to
relate
the
questionnaires
to
the
entrainment session, the entrainment effect would
have diminished, and potentially contaminated by
the intersecting pain trial. Furthermore, the aver-
age time to complete all three questionnaires var-
ied
significantly
between
volunteers,
and
consequentially, post-entrainment to questionnaire
time window also varied accordingly.
Very little work has been completed investigating
the similarity between naturally occurring alpha and
entrained alpha rhythms. Whether entrained alpha
accurately mimics cortical rhythms is still unknown.
It is presumed that they rely on the same mecha-
nisms, as entrained activity influences subsequent
spontaneous cortically generated activity, outlasting
the
stimulation
period.
Literature
suggests
that
changes in neural activity during rhythmic stimula-
tions are similar to the neural changes observed
when the stimulation finishes (Halbleib et al., 2012).
Spaak et al. (2014) reported visual 10-Hz entrain-
ment outlasting the stimulation by multiple cycles.
This suggests a 10-Hz flicker induced alpha oscilla-
tions intrinsic to the cortex.
The longevity of entrainment and analgesic effect
was not considered in this study. Longer-term effects
of alpha-range stimulation have been seen using
other techniques, such as a repetitive Transcranial
Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS; Moisset et al., 2016).
Although the analgesic effects induced by rTMS
appear immediately after the stimulation, the largest
effect can be delayed up to 3 days and can last up to
1 week
(Lefaucheur
et al.,
2001;
Andre-Obadia
et al., 2008). Furthermore, when considering other
techniques that have been used to modulate oscilla-
tory frequencies (e.g. TMS, neurofeedback training
and
mindfulness
training),
the
duration
of
the
induced
effect
increases
after
repeated
sessions
(Mhalla et al., 2011; Jensen et al., 2013; Grant,
2014; Moisset et al., 2016). As such, further work
assessing the long-term analgesic effects of alpha
entrainment following on–off and regular use is
needed to allow us to assess the usefulness of alpha
entrainment in clinical practice.
5. Concluding remarks
This study provides new evidence that visual and
auditory entrainment in the alpha range can influ-
ence the perception of acute pain independently of
arousal
and
negative
emotional
influences.
The
results reveal that 10-Hz stimulation has a signifi-
cantly larger analgesic effect than 8 and 12 Hz fol-
lowing the visual entrainment and non-significantly
following the auditory entrainment. Overall, visual
entrainment produced a larger effect than auditory
entrainment in the mid- and lower alpha frequen-
cies. This provides further evidence that external
stimulation
can
modulate
pain
perception
and
requires further study to ascertain its relevance to
clinical pain states.
