Abstract  
19 
Objective To determine the accuracy of wrist and arm-worn activity monitors’ estimates of 
20 
energy expenditure (EE).  
21 
 
22 
Data sources SportDISCUS (EBSCOHost), PubMed, Medline (Ovid), PsycINFO 
23 
(EBSCOHost), EMBASE (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCOHost). 
24 
 
25 
Design A random effects meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the difference in EE 
26 
estimates between activity monitors and criterion measurements. Moderator analyses were 
27 
conducted to determine the benefit of additional sensors and to compare the accuracy of 
28 
devices used for research purposes with commercially available devices.   
29 
 
30 
Eligibility criteria We included studies validating EE estimates from wrist or arm-worn 
31 
activity monitors against criterion measures (indirect calorimetry, room calorimeters and 
32 
doubly labelled water) in healthy adult populations.  
33 
 
34 
Results 60 studies (104 effect sizes) were included in the meta-analysis. Devices showed 
35 
variable accuracy depending on activity type. Large and significant heterogeneity was 
36 
observed for many devices (I2 >75%). Combining heart rate or heat sensing technology with 
37 
accelerometry decreased the error in most activity types. Research-grade devices were 
38 
statistically more accurate for comparisons of total EE but less accurate than commercial 
39 
devices during ambulatory activity and sedentary tasks.  
40 
 
41 
Conclusions EE estimates from wrist and arm-worn devices differ in accuracy depending on 
42 
activity type. Addition of physiological sensors improves estimates of EE and research-grade 
43 
devices are superior for total EE. These data highlight the need to improve estimates of EE 
44 
from wearable devices and one way this can be achieved is with the addition of heart rate to 
45 
accelerometry.

What is already known on this topic? 
• Wrist or arm-worn devices incorporating multiple sensors are increasingly 
common and many devices provide estimates of energy expenditure. It is 
important to determine their validity overall and in different activity types.  
• It is not clear which specific sensors or combinations of sensors provide the most 
accurate estimates of energy expenditure.  
• It is unclear whether research-grade devices are more accurate than commercial 
devices.  
 
What this study adds 
• The accuracy in energy expenditure estimates from activity monitors varies 
between activities.  
• Larger error is observed from devices employing accelerometry alone; the 
addition of heart rate sensing improves estimates of energy expenditure in most 
activities. 
• In some activity types, research-grade devices are not superior to commercial 
devices.

Introduction 
65 
The prevalence of obesity has tripled in the last 40 years [1] and it has been estimated that by 
66 
2050, 60% of males and 50% of females may be obese [2]. Obesity is the result of a chronic 
67 
imbalance between energy intake (EI) and energy expenditure (EE) [3] driven by  
68 
physiological, psychological and environmental factors.  
69 
Doubly-labelled water (DLW) is considered the gold standard for the measurement of 
70 
free-living EE [4]; however, the considerable costs and analytical requirements limit its 
71 
feasibility in large cohort studies [5]. Indirect calorimetry methods represent the most 
72 
commonly employed criterion measure for assessment of the energy cost of an activity but 
73 
again are limited to structured activities usually within a laboratory [6]. Wearable activity 
74 
monitors are increasingly popular for the estimation of EE [7]. 
75 
Wearable devices which use triaxial accelerometry to derive an estimate of EE have 
76 
been available for research purposes for some time [8]. These devices are worn on the hip, 
77 
thigh or lower back, as proximity to the centre of mass more accurately reflects the energy 
78 
cost of movement [9]; however, participant comfort and compliance is a recognised issue 
79 
[10] and therefore traditional wear devices have limited long-term, free-living measurement 
80 
capability. Use of wrist-worn activity monitors by both consumers and researchers has 
81 
dramatically increased [11] facilitated by improved battery longevity and miniaturization of 
82 
hardware required to produce interpretable data [12]. Recent consumer devices include 
83 
triaxial accelerometers, heat sensors and photoplethysmography heart rate sensors [13]. This 
84 
information can be incorporated to improve the estimation of EE relative to accelerometry 
85 
alone [14]. However, their accuracy compared with criterion measures is questionable [15] 
86 
and may vary with the type and intensity of activity [16]. 
87 
This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the accuracy of EE estimates from current 
88 
wrist or arm-worn devices during different activities. Given the recent popularity wrist and 
89 
arm-worn activity monitors, it is critical to determine their validity for the estimation of EE 
90 
[17]. Secondary aims were to investigate the usefulness of specific sensors within devices, 
91 
and compare commercial and research-grade devices. We hypothesised that the addition of 
92 
physiological data to accelerometry within wearable devices will provide a more accurate 
93 
estimate of EE [18], compared with criterion measures, and that the performance of research-
94 
grade devices would be superior to commercial devices.  
95 
 
96 
Methods 
97 
  
6 
This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy 
98 
guideline [19] (supplementary material 1) and was prospectively registered in the 
99 
PROSPERO database (CRD42018085016). 
100 
 
101 
Search strategy 
102 
SportDISCUS (EBSCOHost), PubMed, Medline (Ovid), PsycINFO (EBSCOHost), 
103 
EMBASE (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCOHost) were searched for studies published up to 1st 
104 
December 2017 using terms relevant to the validation of EE estimates from activity monitors 
105 
against criterion measures with the following strategy ((tracker AND EE) AND validation). 
106 
The search was updated 15th January 2018. The specific keywords and the full search strategy 
107 
can be found in supplementary material 2. No language restrictions were applied and in the 
108 
case of studies available only as an abstract, attempts were made to contact the authors.  
109 
 
110 
Inclusion criteria 
111 
We considered laboratory or field validation studies conducted in healthy adults (≥18 years) 
112 
comparing a criterion measure of EE to an estimate of EE in kilocalories (kcal), kilojoules 
113 
(kJ) or megajoules (MJ) from an activity monitor. We considered only wrist or arm-worn 
114 
devices. There is a clear tendency towards wrist worn devices amongst consumer devices and 
115 
devices worn on alternative anatomical locations produce different accelerometry patterns 
116 
and therefore estimates of EE [20]. For criterion validation, we considered DLW, indirect 
117 
calorimetry devices and metabolic chambers [6]. 
118 
 
119 
Exclusion criteria 
120 
Adults with conditions deemed to produce atypical movement patterns were excluded, 
121 
including Parkinson’s disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebral palsy and 
122 
amputees. These conditions are often associated with abnormal gait pattern and thus reduce 
123 
accuracy in EE estimates [21]. Devices requiring external sensors or components were 
124 
excluded. Studies reporting only accelerometer counts or studies involving post-hoc 
125 
manipulation of the device output were excluded.  
126 
 
127 
Study selection 
128 
Two authors (ROD and JT) independently assessed 100% of titles and abstracts for potential 
129 
inclusion, with 10% screened independently by a third author (GF). In the case of 
130 
disagreements between reviewers, the paper was retrieved in full-text and mutual consensus 
131 
  
7 
was reached. Remaining articles were screened independently for inclusion at the full-text 
132 
level by two authors (ROD and JT), with a third author (SS) screening 10%. Similarly, 
133 
conflicts were resolved by discussion between reviewers.  
134 
 
135 
Data extraction 
136 
From each of the included studies, characteristics of participants, validation protocol, 
137 
criterion measure and the devices tested including model, wear site and output were 
138 
extracted. Mean difference or EE estimates from the criterion measure and the device were 
139 
extracted, along with standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE) or 95% confidence 
140 
intervals (95% CI). If only SE was provided, SE was converted to SD. If data were not 
141 
provided, authors were contacted to request the raw data. Where values were only presented 
142 
in figures, a digitiser tool was used [22]. Data was extracted to a specialised spreadsheet and 
143 
entered into Comprehensive Meta-analysis (CMA) (CMA, version 2; Biostat, Englewood, 
144 
NJ) for analysis. Data was extracted by one author (ROD) and was cross-checked for data 
145 
extraction errors. A second author (JT) verified 100% of extracted data and data entered into 
146 
CMA.  
147 
 
148 
Quality assessment 
149 
Risk of bias in included studies was determined using a modified version of the Downs and 
150 
Black checklist for non-randomised studies [23]. The Downs and Black instrument is an 
151 
established tool for determination of the quality of a study within a systematic review and 
152 
meta-analysis [24]. The modified version used in the present study carried a maximum score 
153 
of 18 and was quantified as: low (≤9, <50%), moderate (>9–14 points, 50–79%), or high (≥15 
154 
points, ≥80%) [25]. It contained 17 questions, 10 related to reporting, three to external 
155 
validity and four to internal validity. The risk of bias assessment was performed 
156 
independently by two authors (ROD and JT), disagreements were resolved by discussion.  
157 
 
158 
Statistical analysis 
159 
Descriptive statistics were calculated for studies included within the meta-analysis.  
160 
EE estimates from the device and criterion, SD or 95% CI, sample sizes and correlation 
161 
coefficients for within-activity comparisons for each device were used to calculate effect 
162 
sizes. Correlation coefficients were based on raw data from previously published studies or 
163 
were conservatively estimated based on the mean of similar devices (supplementary material 
164 
3). Where a study provided data for more than one comparison for one device, the selected 
165 
  
8 
outcomes were pooled to provide a single mean and prevent overpowering of a single study. 
166 
Hedges’ g (ES) [26] and 95% CIs were calculated using CMA, in accordance with the 
167 
majority of studies in the literature testing the mean bias between activity monitors and 
168 
criterion measures. A negative ES represents an underestimation relative to the criterion and 
169 
a positive value represents an overestimation. Interpretation of ES was as follows: <0.20 as 
170 
trivial, 0.20-0.39 as small, 0.40-0.80 as moderate and >0.80 as large [27]. A random effects 
171 
model was employed for all analyses based on the assumption that heterogeneity would exist 
172 
between included studies due to the variability in study design [28]. To determine 
173 
heterogeneity, the I2 statistic [29] was utilised and >75% was considered to represent large 
174 
heterogeneity. To determine susceptibility to bias from one study, a leave one out analysis 
175 
was conducted where the removal of one study would leave at least three studies. The study 
176 
associated with the greatest change to significance of the effect is reported. To assist 
177 
interpretation of the error associated with each device, we calculated the percentage error 
178 
relative for each device using percentage difference and weight within each meta-analysis.  
179 
 
180 
Exploration of small study effects 
181 
To examine small study effects, data were visually inspected with funnel plots and 
182 
subsequently quantified by using Egger’s linear regression intercept [30]. A statistically 
183 
significant Egger’s statistic indicates the presence of a small study effect.  
184 
 
185 
Moderators and subgroups 
186 
As well as overall, which represents a combination of all subgroups, subgroup meta-analyses 
187 
were performed for specific activities/categories: 1) activity energy expenditure (AEE) which 
188 
included comparisons of EE estimates from the device to a criterion during non-specific 
189 
exercise protocols, circuits, arm ergometer, rowing and resistance exercises; 2) ambulation 
190 
and stair climbing; 3) cycling; 4) running; 5) sedentary behaviours and household tasks and 
191 
6) total energy expenditure (TEE), representing comparisons to DLW.  
192 
 
193 
We conducted moderator analyses by sensors and all devices were grouped based on 
194 
the inclusion of the following sensor hardware: 1) accelerometry alone (ACC); 2) heart rate 
195 
alone (HR); 3) accelerometry and heart rate (ACC+HR); 4) accelerometry and heat sensing or 
196 
galvanic skin response (ACC+HS) and 5) accelerometry, heart rate sensors and heat sensing 
197 
or galvanic skin response sensors (ACC+HR+HS). Secondly, moderator analyses were 
198 
conducted by commercial and research-grade devices. Devices produced by Actical, 
199 
  
9 
Actigraph and Bodymedia were considered as research-grade and all other devices included 
200 
in the analysis were considered commercial devices. Comparisons between each moderator 
201 
employed a random effects model.

Results  
204 
Overview 
205 
A total of 64 studies were included in the systematic review (Supplementary 4). Four studies 
206 
could not be synthesised by meta-analysis as mean difference between activity monitors and 
207 
criterion measurements were not provided [12,31–33]; thus, 60 studies were included in the 
208 
meta-analysis (figure 1) [10,13,41–50,20,51–60,34,61–70,35,71–80,36,81–88,37–40]. A total 
209 
of 1946 participants were included, with a mean age of 35 years (range 20 to 86 years). The 
210 
mean BMI was 24.9 kg/m2 (range 21.8 to 31.6 kg/m2). Within the included studies, 104 
211 
comparisons between devices and a criterion were included. This represented 58 commercial 
212 
and 46 research-grade device comparisons. ACC was comprised of 35 comparisons, 1 in HR 
213 
devices, 20 in ACC+HR devices, 45 in ACC+HS and 3 in ACC+HR+HS. With regard to 
214 
activity performed, 35 comparisons were classed as AEE, ambulation and stairs included 55 
215 
comparisons, 23 were cycling tasks and 38 were running tasks. Sedentary and low-intensity 
216 
was comprised of 30 comparisons and TEE included 16 comparisons.  
217 
 
218 
Devices  
219 
A total of 40 devices were tested in the included studies. One device was forearm-worn, 6 
220 
were worn on the upper arm (triceps) and 33 were wrist-worn. Characteristics of the devices, 
221 
number of studies and weighted percentage error for each device is shown in supplementary 
222 
materials 5.  
223 
 
224 
Meta-analysis 
225 
Individual study effect sizes and allocation to moderator variables are provided in 
226 
supplementary materials 6. A minimum of three comparisons were required for meta-analysis 
227 
and as such, we report pooled ES for individual devices or moderators where three or more 
228 
comparisons were available. Statistical outputs for each device are presented in 
229 
supplementary materials 7.  
230 
 
231 
Quality assessment  
232 
  
10 
The modified Downs and Black scores revealed a median score of 13, with one study being 
233 
classed as low quality [69], 48 classed as moderate and 11 classed as high quality 
234 
(supplementary materials 8). The questions included in the modified tool and percentage of 
235 
studies fulfilling each question is shown in supplementary materials 9.   
236 
 
237 
Overall 
238 
A forest plot of individual devices over all activities is shown in figure 2. Overall, devices 
239 
underestimated EE (ES: -0.23, 95% CI: -0.44 to -0.04; n=104; p=0.03) and showed 
240 
significant heterogeneity between devices (I2 =92.18%; p=<0.001). Significant 
241 
underestimations relative to criterion measures were observed for the Garmin Vivofit (GVF; 
242 
ES: -1.09, 95% CI: -1.61 to -0.56; n=5; p<0.001) and the Jawbone UP24 (JU24; ES: -1.16, 
243 
95% CI: -1.79 to -0.53; n=3; p<0.001). The SenseWear Armband Pro3 (SWA p3) also 
244 
underestimated EE (ES: -0.32. 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.01; n=12; p=0.04). Sensitivity analysis 
245 
revealed that the removal of six comparisons altered the significance of the SWA p3 
246 
(p>0.05), the most influential of which decreased the ES to -0.19 (95% CI: -0.50 to 0.11; 
247 
p=0.21) [81]. The Apple watch (AW) Bodymedia CORE armband (BMC), Fitbit charge HR 
248 
(FCHR), Fitbit Flex (FF), Jawbone UP (JU), Nike Fuelband (NF), SenseWear Armband 
249 
(SWA) SenseWear Armband Pro2 (SWA p2), and Mini (SWAM) did not differ significantly 
250 
from criterion measures. However, sensitivity analysis showed the FCHR differed 
251 
significantly with the removal of one study (ES: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.49; p<0.001) [88]. 
252 
The NF was the only device that did not display significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 
253 
=25.44%; p=0.26), with the remaining devices having I2 values  66.91% (all p0.05). No 
254 
device showed evidence of small study effects.  
255 
 
256 
AEE  
257 
A forest plot of individual devices during activities classed as AEE is shown in 
258 
supplementary materials 10. For AEE, the pooled estimate of all devices was a non-
259 
significant tendency to underestimate EE compared with criterion measures (ES: -0.34, 95% 
260 
CI: -0.71 to 0.04; n=35; p=0.08) and significant heterogeneity was observed between devices 
261 
(I2 =94.94%; p<0.001). The SWA p2 underestimated EE (ES: -0.78, 95% CI: -1.48 to -0.08; 
262 
n=3; p=0.03) and had moderate, non-significant heterogeneity (I2 =64.19%; p=0.06). The 
263 
BMC, NF, SWA and SWAM did not differ significantly from criterion measures but all 
264 
displayed significant heterogeneity. No device showed evidence of small study effects.  
265 
  
11 
 
266 
 
267 
Ambulation and stairs 
268 
A forest plot of individual devices during ambulation and stair climbing is shown in figure 3. 
269 
The pooled estimate of all devices did not differ from criterion measures (ES: -0.09, 95% CI: 
270 
-0.45 to 0.27; n=55; p=0.62) and significant heterogeneity was observed between devices (I2 
271 
=93.74%; p<0.01). The FCHR (ES: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.27 to 1.29; n=5; p=0.002) and FF (ES: 
272 
1.10, 95% CI: 0.43 to 1.77; n=3; p=0.001) overestimated EE. The GVF underestimated EE 
273 
(ES: -1.24, 95% CI: -1.86 to -0.62; n=4; p<0.01), however, sensitivity analysis revealed that 
274 
the removal of two comparisons significantly altered the mean effect (p>0.05) the most 
275 
influential significantly altered the mean effect to ES: -1.32 (95% CI: -2.73 to 0.08; p=0.07) 
276 
[34]. Further, there was evidence of small study effects (intercept= -13.76, 95% CI: -19.72 to 
277 
-7.80; p=0.01). The SWA overestimated EE (ES: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.25 to 1.33; n=5; p<0.01) 
278 
and sensitivity analysis revealed that the removal of four comparisons significantly altered 
279 
the mean effect (p>0.05) the most influential significantly altered the mean effect to ES: 0.33 
280 
(95% CI: -0.26 to 0.92; p=0.28) [56]. The AW, JU, SWA p3 and SWAM did not differ 
281 
significantly from criterion measures. The mean effect of the SWAM was significantly 
282 
altered by the removal of two studies; the removal of the most influential study yielded a 
283 
significant overestimation (ES: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.94; p=0.003) [87]. All devices 
284 
showed significant heterogeneity.

Cycling 
287 
A forest plot of individual devices during cycling is shown in supplementary materials 10. 
288 
The pooled estimate of all devices was significantly lower than criterion measures (ES: -0.73, 
289 
95% CI: -1.39 to -0.06; n=23; p=0.03) and significant heterogeneity was observed between 
290 
devices (I2 =94.74%; p<0.01). The SWA did not differ significantly from criterion but 
291 
showed significant heterogeneity (I2 =89.39%; p<0.001). The SWA p3 did not differ from 
292 
criterion measures and showed moderate heterogeneity (I2 =54.95%; p=0.11).  
293 
 
294 
Running  
295 
A forest plot of individual devices during running is shown in supplementary materials 10. 
296 
The pooled estimate was not statistically different from criterion measures (ES: -0.08, 95% 
297 
CI: -0.41 to 0.25; n=38; p=0.65) and significant heterogeneity was observed between devices 
298 
(I2 =92.05%; p=<0.001). The FCHR, GVF and SWA did not differ from criterion measures. 
299 
  
12 
Sensitivity analysis revealed the removal of one study changed the overall effect for the 
300 
FCHR (ES: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.90; p<0.001) [87]. Significant heterogeneity was 
301 
observed for the FCHR (I2 =66.8%; p=0.03) and SWA (I2 =96.79; p<0.001), but not for the 
302 
GVF (I2 =46.39%; p=0.15).  
303 
 
304 
Sedentary and household tasks 
305 
A forest plot of individual devices during sedentary and household tasks is shown in figure 4. 
306 
The pooled effect was not statistically different from criterion measures (ES: -0.09, 95% CI: -
307 
0.51 to 0.32; n=30; p=0.66) and significant heterogeneity was observed between devices (I2 
308 
=94.84%; p<0.001). The AW, FCHR and SWAM were not statistically different from 
309 
criterion measures. The SWA p3 overestimated EE (ES: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.00 to 1.34; 
310 
p=0.049). Sensitivity analysis revealed that the removal of three studies changed the mean 
311 
effect, the most influential of which decreased the ES to 0.41 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.82; p=0.05) 
312 
[42]. Observed heterogeneity was significant for the AW, SWA p3 and SWAM. The FCHR 
313 
had moderate, non-significant heterogeneity (I2 =59.60%; p=0.60).  
314 
 
315 
TEE  
316 
A forest plot of individual devices for the measurement of TEE is shown in figure 5. The 
317 
pooled effect for TEE showed a significant underestimation of EE (ES: -0.68, 95% CI: -1.15 
318 
to -0.21; n=16; p= p=0.005) and significant heterogeneity was observed between devices (I2 
319 
=92.17%; p<0.01). The SWA p3 did not differ significantly from criterion measures and 
320 
showed significant heterogeneity (I2 =94.20%; p=0.001).  
321 
 
322 
Moderator analyses  
323 
The results of moderator analyses are shown in table 1. Overall, there was a significant 
324 
difference between sensors (p=0.003). Pooled estimate of EE from ACC+HR and ACC+HS 
325 
was not statistically different from criterion but ACC+HS showed a non-significant tendency 
326 
for underestimation, and ACC and ACC+HR+HS both significantly underestimated EE. In 
327 
the AEE comparison, there was no statistical difference between sensors, but ACC+HS 
328 
significantly underestimated EE, ACC showed a non-significant tendency for 
329 
underestimation and ACC+HR did not differ significantly from criterion measures. During 
330 
ambulation and stair climbing, a significant difference between sensors was observed, with 
331 
estimates of EE from ACC+HR and ACC+HS being significantly higher than criterion. In 
332 
cycling, significant differences were observed between sensors, with ACC devices 
333 
  
13 
underestimating EE. During running activities, none of the pooled mean estimates were 
334 
significantly different from criterion. For sedentary and household tasks, a significant 
335 
difference was observed between sensors; ACC+HR was not different from criterion 
336 
measures whereas ACC and ACC+HS underestimated and overestimated EE respectively. 
337 
For TEE, sensors differed significantly; ACC underestimated EE, whereas ACC+HS did not 
338 
differ significantly from criterion.  
339 
 
When analysed by commercial and research-grade devices, no significant difference 
340 
was observed overall, for AEE, cycling or running. For both the ambulation and stairs 
341 
comparison and the sedentary and household tasks comparison, commercial devices were 
342 
closer to criterion measurements, with research grade devices significantly overestimating. 
343 
For TEE, research-grade devices were superior, with commercial devices significantly 
344 
underestimating EE.

Discussion  
348 
 
349 
Given the clinical and consumer uptake of wrist and arm-worn activity monitors which can 
350 
be used for the estimation of EE, the aims of this meta-analysis were (i) to determine the 
351 
relative accuracy of current devices, (ii) to investigate the importance of specific sensors 
352 
within devices and (iii) to compare commercial and research-grade devices.  
353 
For devices with sufficient comparisons to be analysed separately from the main 
354 
pooled effect, significant error relative to criterion measures was observed for Garmin, Fitbit, 
355 
Jawbone and Bodymedia products. Garmin, Fitbit and Jawbone represent a major share of the 
356 
commercial wearable market [73] and Bodymedia products are widely used in research and 
357 
have been since 2004 [59]. Whilst it is initially encouraging that the ES for many devices was 
358 
not significantly different from criterion, the 95% CI observed in many cases indicates the 
359 
potential for these devices to produce erroneous estimates of mean EE and as such we would 
360 
be hesitant to consider any device sufficiently accurate. A 10% ‘equivalence zone’ has been 
361 
suggested previously [65] and with the exception of the Nike Fuel band, in which all three 
362 
studies reported a mean error <10% [65,79,82], no device pooled in this meta-analysis 
363 
consistently met this criteria. The SenseWear armband Mini was the most accurate device 
364 
overall but error reported in studies ranged from -21.27% [87] to 14.76% [39]. Studies in this 
365 
analysis followed the manufacturer’s instructions for setup, with researchers ensuring the 
366 
position of the device and characteristics such as height, weight, sex and age were correct. In 
367 
free-living environments the lack of researcher presence could yield greater error than 
368 
observed in this analysis [17], as indicated by the moderate, significant underestimation for 
369 
the pooled effect in the TEE subgroup.  
370 
 
371 
An accurate yet affordable measure of TEE, with a measure of change in energy storage, 
372 
could theoretically be used to retrospectively determine free-living EI in large cohorts [89]. 
373 
In this context, TEE may be considered the most important activity subgroup in this meta-
374 
analysis, however, the most variable and unpredictable component of TEE is EE during 
375 
activity [6]. In agreement with previous studies [13,45,52], we have shown that the accuracy 
376 
of devices differs by activity and this may be related to the inability of devices to differentiate 
377 
between activity types. For a device to accurately estimate TEE between individuals, it must 
378 
accurately estimate the energy cost of a wide range of activities however, some activities may 
379 
require greater focus. The majority of EE is attributable to rest or non-exercise activity [6] so 
380 
error here could have a great impact on the error in TEE. The Fitbit Charge HR was the most 
381 
  
16 
tested commercial device in this analysis and it showed a trivial, non-significant ES overall 
382 
and during sedentary tasks but a moderate to large and significant overestimation during 
383 
ambulatory activity. Considering that ambulatory activity is central to public health 
384 
guidelines worldwide [90], the implications of this finding may be great for estimates of 
385 
TEE.  
386 
The observed error for different activity types may be because current algorithms do 
387 
not take physical activity type or bodily posture into account [91]. Indeed, activity 
388 
recognition is considered an important direction for wearable technology [11] and has been 
389 
used to improve estimates of EE [92]. Montoye et al have shown that accelerometers worn on 
390 
the wrists and thigh can be used to predict activity type [93]. The SenseWear software 
391 
employs complex pattern-recognition algorithms to determine activity type [45] which likely 
392 
contributed to the trivial or small ES observed for the SenseWear Armband Mini in all 
393 
comparisons. The challenges associated with activity recognition have been reviewed 
394 
recently [94] and as this technology develops, activity-specific EE prediction equations may 
395 
offer the opportunity to reduced errors associated with activity types.  
396 
 
397 
Sensors 
398 
A 2012 review concluded that multisensory and triaxial accelerometry devices improve 
399 
estimates of EE, relative to uniaxial devices [21]. Due to recent technological advancements, 
400 
triaxial accelerometry, as well as heart rate or heat sensing technology are commonplace in 
401 
newer devices [48]. We hypothesised that the addition of this technology to accelerometry 
402 
would improve estimates of EE. Overall, this meta-analysis shows that the inclusion of heart 
403 
rate or heat sensors in devices can improve estimates of EE relative to accelerometry alone. 
404 
Indeed, it is established that accelerometry is limited for non-weight-bearing activities [84], 
405 
and accelerometry underestimated EE during cycling activities in our analysis. Significant 
406 
underestimations were also observed during sedentary and household tasks and TEE, which 
407 
is likely a product of the limited arm movements associated with these activities.  
408 
Accelerometry and heart rate devices moderately overestimated EE during ambulation 
409 
and stair climbing. Some of this error may be attributable to the individual variability in the 
410 
relationship between heart rate and EE. Individual calibration of this relationship in the 
411 
Actiheart device is associated with improved estimates of EE [95] and may offer a means for 
412 
further reducing the error observed in wrist and arm-worn devices. An alternative explanation 
413 
for this is the variability in estimates of heart rate from photoplethysmography heart rate 
414 
sensors. A recent study reported a small mean error of -5.9 bpm in the Fitbit Charge 2, but 
415 
  
17 
wide limits of agreement of -28.5 to 16.8 bpm [96] and this variability is a common finding 
416 
[35,40].  
417 
 
418 
Device Grade   
419 
The third aim of this meta-analysis was to compare commercial and research-grade devices. 
420 
Commercial devices may be developed with affordability and comfort as a primary focus, 
421 
and as a consequence it may be unreasonable to expect commercial devices to match the 
422 
validity of research-grade devices. Recent consumer monitors share similar technology with 
423 
established research-grade multi-sensor devices [48] and this is partially reflected in our 
424 
results. A benefit of research-grade devices for TEE was observed, but commercial devices 
425 
were statistically superior in ambulation and during sedentary tasks. Our results question the 
426 
use of wrist or arm-worn research-grade devices for the validation of newer devices. 
427 
Comparisons to criterion measures such as DLW or indirect calorimetry are more appropriate 
428 
when absolute accuracy is required [6]. Further, it is important to highlight that other 
429 
research-grade devices, for instance the Actiheart, which is worn on the chest [95], are likely 
430 
to be more accurate than research-grade devices included in this study [48]. Further research 
431 
is needed to establish whether research-grade devices that are worn in other locations such as 
432 
the chest, hip or thigh outperform consumer based devices. 
433 
 
434 
Limitations 
435 
Separate pooled analyses to determine the accuracy of individual activity monitors were 
436 
performed for a limited number of devices due to the small number of comparisons available 
437 
for the remaining devices (i.e., less than three comparisons). This limitation is inevitable 
438 
considering the large number of activity monitors included in this review. Nevertheless, the 
439 
inclusion of all devices in the overall pooled analysis provides an extensive and robust 
440 
evaluation of the difference in EE outcomes between activity monitors and criterion 
441 
measures.  
442 
The majority of analyses conducted within this review demonstrated large 
443 
heterogeneity within and between devices which remained after moderating by specific 
444 
devices and activity. Such heterogeneity is not unexpected and in many cases may be 
445 
attributable to disparity in the protocols employed [97]. Indirect calorimetry systems were the 
446 
most commonly used criterion measure but EE estimates may differ by up to 5.2% depending 
447 
on the equations used [98]. EE is likely to be elevated in the period following higher intensity 
448 
exercise and the inclusion of only the steady state period may influence the extent to which 
449 
  
18 
devices differ from criterion measures [56]. There is also the possibility that the discrepancy 
450 
between device estimates relates to populations studied [16] for example, a higher BMI 
451 
[35,40] or age related changes in movement patterns [69]. As few devices currently provide 
452 
open-access to EE algorithms, the potential for this to create heterogeneity remains uncertain. 
453 
Despite this, the statistically significant outcomes in many cases suggests a consistent 
454 
direction in effect sizes for many comparisons and the differences in statistical outcomes 
455 
between devices are supported by the magnitude of effect sizes.  
456 
External validity was low in 46 studies pooled in this meta-analysis, which must be 
457 
considered when interpreting the present results. It must also be noted that the present 
458 
analysis was limited to healthy individuals and therefore our results cannot be generalized to 
459 
populations with conditions that produce abnormal gait patterns.  
460 
Lastly, there is a lag between product release and testing in research environments 
461 
[40] and some of the devices included in this meta-analysis are no longer in production so the 
462 
continued validation of newer devices is imperative. 
463 
 
464 
Conclusion  
465 
This meta-analysis collated studies evaluating the validity of EE estimates by wrist or 
466 
arm-worn devices. Devices vary in accuracy depending on activity type and the significant 
467 
heterogeneity means caution must be exercised when interpreting these results. Devices with 
468 
heart rate sensors often produced better estimates than devices using accelerometry only; 
469 
however, this was not consistent across all activities. Wrist and arm-worn research-grade 
470 
devices were more accurate than commercial devices for estimates of TEE but researchers 
471 
should be aware that such devices do not guarantee superior accuracy. Future research should 
472 
aim to understand and reduce the error in EE estimates from wrist or arm-worn devices in 
473 
different activity types. This may be achieved through activity recognition techniques, 
474 
incorporating physiological measures and exploring the potential for individual calibration of 
475 
these relationships.
