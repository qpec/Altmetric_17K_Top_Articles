Purpose: To examine whether negative Facebook (FB) experiences were independently associated
with depressive symptoms among young adults in a longitudinal family cohort.
Methods: Negative FB experiences were measured by type (e.g., bullying or meanness, unwanted
contact, misunderstandings, or any), recency, number of experiences, and severity of upset.
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depres-
sion Scale. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for sibling correlation; adjusted
models were constructed for each negative FB experience measure accounting for sex, race/
ethnicity, social support, adolescent depressive symptoms, parental psychological distress, average
monthly income, educational attainment, and employment.
Results: In a sample of 264 young adults, all negative FB experience measures were significantly
associated with depressive symptoms.
Conclusions: There is a clear association between negative FB experience and depressive
symptoms. Future work should examine: (1) whether negative FB experiences cause inci-
dent depression or exacerbate preexisting depression; and (2) who is most prone to being
upset by negative FB experiences. With further research, recommendations for limiting or
altering FB use among high-risk subpopulations could be useful in reducing depressive
symptoms.

IMPLICATIONS AND
CONTRIBUTION
Negative Facebook experi-
ences were associated with
depressive symptoms. Ex-
periences of bullying or
meanness were uniquely
linked to depressive symp-
toms; having as few as one
to three negative lifetime
experiences was associated
withdepressive symptoms.
With further research, rec-
ommendations for altering
Facebook use among high-
risk subpopulations could
be
useful
in
reducing
depressive symptoms.
In the past decade, Internet use has grown rapidly, particu-
larly the use of social media (SM) such as Facebook (FB), which
are virtual gathering places. FB has three times as many sub-
scribers as there are U.S. citizens [1]. In a recent report, 95% of
adults aged 18e33 years reported use of the Internet, the highest
proportion among any age group, 83% of whom reported SM use
[1]. Research on SM use has focused on adolescents and college
students; to our knowledge, there have been no studies among
young adults older than college age. Yet the transition from
adolescence to early adulthood is a vulnerable developmental
stage in which an individual’s support system (including
online social supports) can influence psychopathology and risk
behaviors [2e5].
The increasing use of SM, particularly during vulnerable
developmental stages, has triggered interest in how its use is
related to psychological and emotional states. SM can likely have

 both positive and negative effects on mental health. For example,
researchers found that online social connectedness may act as an
additional social medium from which a range of positive psy-
chological outcomes can be derived [6]. However, another study
found that, although FB can help college students obtain online
social support, there was little effect on well-being [7]. A study
conducted by FB employees found that emotions expressed by
others on FBdwhether positive or negativedcan influence an
individual’s own emotions [8]. For the purposes of this research,
we will be focusing specifically on negative Facebook experi-
ences (NFEs).
Media outlets and researchers have suggested that experi-
ences on FB may increase the risk of depression, referred to as
“Facebook depression” which some believe to be triggered by
spending a great deal of time using SM. In particular, there is
concern that addictive SM use, cyberbullying, and the evocation
of jealousy due to the constant exposure to others’ personal in-
formation may lead to depression [4,9e11]. Chen and Lee [9]
found
evidence
that
both
communication
overload
and
reduced self-esteem are mechanisms by which FB interaction
can influence psychological distress. Yet, Jelenchick et al. [11]
found no relationship between frequency of social networking
site use and depression in a college sample. Despite mixed results
and media attention, there is limited research examining the
relationship between SM use and mental health.
It has been suggested that negative experiences online are a
common source of risk for young people. For example, in a
national cross-sectional online survey of 1,588 young people ages
10e17, 33% reported online harassment in the last year; 9%
reported an incident on an SM site specifically [12]. Prior
research has also demonstrated the negative effects of bullying
on well-being, including depression; however, limited research
has been conducted on the specific nature and effects of negative
SM experiences [13e15].
All studies of SM use to date have focused on characteristics of
use such as comments in postings, behaviors posted in pictures,
and frequency of overall use. In this study (and to our knowledge
for the first time), we examined the subjective effect of SM
experiences; specifically, how negative interactions with others
on SM may be related to depression. Measuring the occurrence of
negative interactions (rather than frequency of use or general
interactions more broadly) on SM is more relevant to our the-
orydthat negative SM experiences can lead to or exacerbate
depressive symptoms. Current gaps in knowledge suggest that
information is needed to confirm or refute whether a relation-
ship exists between SM experience and depressive symptoms.
We studied a cohort previously assessed during adolescence
(mean age of 14), before the advent of SM, and then again when
the cohort was 21e30 years old. Thus, we had a unique oppor-
tunity to use a longitudinal cohort to determine whether nega-
tive
SM
experiences
were
independently
associated
with
depressive symptoms among young adults, accounting for
adolescent depressive symptoms and parental psychological
distress occurring prior to SM use.
Methods
Participants and sample
The New England Family Study (NEFS) third-generation
cohort represents the third generation of participants in the
NEFS, an intergenerational cohort established to follow-up the
adult offspring born to women enrolled during pregnancy as part
of the U.S. Collaborative Perinatal Project from 1959 to 1966 [16].
During the Collaborative Perinatal Project, women were studied
extensively during pregnancy (G1), and their offspring’s (G2)
development was studied through age 7 years. The NEFS was
established between 2001 and 2004 to recruit a subset of the
second-generation adult cohort to investigate the intergenera-
tional transmission of tobacco use and nicotine dependence; of
this group 1,674 were enrolled (74%). Information was elicited
from the G2s by interviewer-administered and self-administered
instruments [17]. In many cases, the G2 spouse or coparent was
unavailable for interview in which case the primary G2 provided
proxy information for the spouse for key psychopathology
measures. More details on sampling and recruitment have been
described previously [17]. This phase also entailed enrolling a
sample of the third-generation adolescent, biological offspring of
Collaborative Perinatal Project participants who were age eligible
(e.g., between 12 and 17 years), including siblings, who had
parental consent, and were living within 100 miles of study sites
in Providence or Boston (n ¼ 564); a baseline interview was
conducted at mean age of 14 years.
Design and data collection
In 2013e2014, follow-up data collection was initiated with
the third-generation cohort members who completed the
adolescent baseline interview. All prior third-generation cohort
members who consented to be contacted for future studies at the
baseline assessment were eligible for recruitment (n ¼ 564).
Participants were located via contact information collected pre-
viously, as well as FB and other frequently used location services.
Participants were then contacted to participate in a study about
SM use. A brief explanation of study participation was given, and
verbal and web-based consent were elicited for participation in a
15- to 20-minute web-based survey. Web-based data collection
was performed using Illume, a product of DatStat, Inc. (Seattle,
WA). Participants were compensated $25 electronic gift certifi-
cate for their participation in this study. Among those success-
fully contacted (n ¼ 334, 59%), there was an 80% response rate
(n ¼ 266). This yielded an overall response rate of 47%. All those
who reported ever using FB were eligible for inclusion in the
analytic sample (n ¼ 264). Given the overall response rate, the
eligible sample was significantly more female and white, non-
Hispanic than the total third-generation cohort (n ¼ 564), yet
not significantly different by adolescent depressive symptoms,
parental household income, parental education, or parental
psychological distress. The final analytic sample included 197
families with 53 sibling pairs and seven sibling triplets. Despite
this relatively small sample size, we have used a cohort to
leverage the opportunity to account for parental psychological
distress and prior adolescent depressive symptoms. This study
protocol was approved by the university institutional review
board.
Measures
Primary outcome. Depressive symptoms, as measured by the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CES-D
10), were the primary outcome. The CES-D is a screening tool
commonly used to identify depressive symptoms among the
general population. The scale’s validity and reliability to detect
clinical
and
nonclinical
depressive
symptoms
have
been

 previously established [18]. The CES-D 10 consists of 10 items.
Participants with a score of 10 or more were considered to have
depressive symptoms [19].
Primary exposures. Participants were first asked, “Have you
ever used Facebook?” All those responding “yes” were eligible
to answer questions about negative SM experiences. Negative
SM experiences were based on two gender-specific focus
groups and an article by Christofides et al. [5]. In 2011, we
conducted two gender-specific focus groups, recruiting via
Craigslist and posting flyers; participants were in the same age
group (21e30 years) as those in this study population. The
focus group discussions elicited descriptions of both negative
and positive SM experiences. Results from thematic analyses of
the focus groups as well as findings from other qualitative
research were used to identify different types of NFEs: (1)
bullying or meanness; (2) unwanted contact; and (3) mis-
understandings [5].
Negative SM experiences were measured in several ways. For
each type of experience (e.g., bullying or meanness, unwanted
contact, misunderstandings, or any negative experience), par-
ticipants
were
asked
about
lifetime
experience,
past-year
experience, number of lifetime experiences (none, 1e3, or 4 or
more), severity of upset from most recent experience (contin-
uous: from 0 to 10; also averaged across types), and severity of
upset of most recent past-year experience (continuous: from
0 to 10; also averaged across types). The detailed definition for
these negative experiences is in Table 1. All of these measures
were found to have good test-retest reliability in a follow-up
2e6 weeks later.

 Other covariates. Sex was categorized as male or female. Age was
asked at the time of the survey and considered as a continuous
variable. Race/ethnicity was categorized as white, non-Hispanic
versus all others. Participants were considered to have social
support if they responded “always” or “usually” to the question,
“How often do you get the social and emotional support you
need?” Daily FB use was determined by responses to the ques-
tion, “When using Facebook over the past year, how frequently
did you use Facebook?” Those participants who responded
“multiple times per day” or “daily” were categorized as daily FB
users. All those who responded “a few times per week,”
“weekly,” “less than weekly,” or “not at all” were categorized as
not being daily FB users. Average monthly income was catego-
rized as: <$500, $500e$1,499, $1,500e$2,499, $2,500 or more,
and do not know. Educational attainment was categorized as
having a high school/GED or less versus having more than a high
school education. Participants were categorized as employed if
they indicated full-time or part-time employment.
Depressive symptoms in the adolescent baseline assessment
were measured by a module from the National Comorbidity
Survey Adolescent Supplement, an adapted version of the World
Health Organization’s Composite International Diagnostic Inter-
view [20]. Specifically, adolescent depressive symptoms were
characterized by a “yes” response to the question, “Over the past
year have you ever had periods that lasted several days or longer
when you felt sad or depressed?” All those who responded “yes”
were categorized as having adolescent depressive symptoms.
Self-reported parental psychological distress at baseline was
assessed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, 4th Edition criteria for at least one major depressive
episode. When available, self-reports were used for both bio-
logical parents. In many cases, however, this information was not
available. In these instances, spousal responses to the following
question were used: “Was (name) ever treated for a psycholog-
ical or emotional problem? This could include staying overnight
in a hospital or treatment facility, taking medicine, or seeing a
psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, doctor, or other health
professional.” An affirmative response was used to identify a
history of psychological distress for the parent reported on.
Based on responses to these questions, parental psychological
distress was categorized as “none” when both parents had no
history of psychological distress, “some” when at least one
parent had a history of psychological distress, or “unknown”
when both parents had missing information or when one parent
had no history of major depressive episode while the other’s
status was missing.
Statistical analysis
All analyses controlled for the nonindependence of siblings
enrolled into the study using generalized estimating equations.
First, we examined the social and demographic characteristics by
depressive symptoms in bivariate analyses. Next, we calculated
crude and adjusted odds ratios of depressive symptoms for all
NFE measures. Adjusted models were constructed for each
exposure of interest accounting for sex, race/ethnicity, social
support, adolescent depressive symptoms, parental psychologi-
cal distress, average monthly income, educational attainment,
and employmentdall measures previously found to be associ-
ated with depressiondas well as daily FB use, which was pre-
viously linked to an increase in negative online experiences
[21e25].
All
models
were
specified
with
the
binomial
distribution, a logit link function, and an exchangeable correla-
tion structure. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata,
version 12 [26].
Results
More than half of the sample was female (59%) and white,
non-Hispanic (90%) (Table 2). Most participants reported having
a lifetime negative experience (82%), having a past-year negative
experience (55%), and having four or more lifetime NFEs (63%).
Unwanted contact and misunderstandings were the most com-
mon lifetime NFEs (61% each). Yet, the most recent experience of
bullying or meanness was the most upsetting (among those
having the experience, mean ¼ 4.57, standard deviation ¼ .25;
Table 3).
Among the full analytic sample, CES-D scores ranged from
0 to 30 with a mean of 6.56 (standard deviation ¼ .33). Sixty-
three participants (24%) were categorized as having depressive
symptoms based on their CES-D scores. Young adults with social
support, who were employed, who had more than a high school
education, and higher average monthly income were signifi-
cantly less likely to have depressive symptoms. Those with a
history of parental psychological distress or adolescent depres-
sive symptoms were more likely to have depressive symptoms in
young adulthood (Table 2).
Lifetime negative FB experiences
Examination of crude relationships between NFEs and current
depressive symptoms showed that those who reported lifetime
NFEs of any type (e.g., bullying or meanness, unwanted contact,
misunderstandings, or any negative experience) had greater
odds of depressive symptoms (Table 3). These significant
relationships remained in fully adjusted models.

 Past-year negative FB experiences
Past-year NFEs were also associated with current depressive
symptoms; this was true for all negative experience types except
for bullying or meanness (Table 3). In the fully adjusted models,
significant
positive
relationships
between
past-year
mis-
understandings and depressive symptoms as well as any past-
year negative FB experience and depressive symptoms remained.
Number of lifetime negative FB experiences
For each NFE type, having four or more experiences was
associated with having depressive symptoms compared to hav-
ing none. For bullying or meanness only, those reporting one to
three experiences had 3.06 95% confidence interval (1.47, 6.37)
times the odds of depressive symptoms compared to those
reporting none (Table 3). In adjusted models these significant
relationships remained.
Severity of upset for most recent negative FB experiences
With each unit increase in reports of upset for most recent
experiences of bullying or meanness, unwanted contact, or
misunderstandings, participants had significantly greater odds of
depressive symptoms. Similarly, with each unit increase in
average reports of upset for all types of negative experience,
participants were significantly more likely to have depressive
symptoms. All significant associations remained in the fully
adjusted models (Table 3).
Severity of upset for most recent past-year negative FB
experiences
Finally, when considering severity of upset for only past-year
experiences, with each unit increase in reports of upset for
experiences of unwanted contact, misunderstandings, or the
average for all negative experience types, participants were
significantly more likely to have depressive symptoms. In

Discussion
This study aimed to examine the relationship between
negative experiences on FB and depressive symptoms. Findings
suggest the lifetime, past-year, lifetime number, and severity of
upset of most recent and most recent past-year negative FB
experiences were all associated with depressive symptoms.
Similar to other nationally representative young adult samples,
24% of participants in this study were categorized as having self-
reported depressive symptoms based on their CES-D scores [27].
Also, similar to previous literature, low social support, adolescent
depressive symptoms, parental psychological distress, lower
income, less education, and being unemployed were all associ-
ated with self-reported depressive symptoms [22e24].
Lifetime negative FB experiences
We assessed whether having lifetime negative FB experiences
was associated with depressive symptoms. Lifetime experience
could have occurred as early as 2004, when FB was created. It
was important to assess lifetime experience because a traumatic
experience on FB in adolescence or young adulthood could
potentially have long-term effects on depressive symptoms, or
may be reflective of long-term depression risk. For lifetime
experiences, reports of all NFE types were strongly associated
with depressive symptoms.
Young people who are depressed and have low self-worth are
more likely to be bullied, while other research suggests that
being

bullying
causes
subsequent
depression
[28e30]. The same may be true for online bullying and unwanted
contact.
Misunderstandings on FB may be indicative of stressful life
events; this is supported by Christofides et al. [5] qualitative
research, in which study participants’ reported examples of
misunderstandings on FB as “when information posted online
lead to issues with friends or a boss.” Stressors and stressful life
events, particularly in young adulthood, have been repeatedly
linked to depression [31e33].
Past-year negative FB experiences
In contrast to all lifetime NFEs, assessing only past-year
negative experiences helped us to understand whether a recent
NFE was more strongly associated with depressive symptoms.
However, evidence from the findings suggest that past-year NFE
was not more strongly associated with depressive symptoms
than having a lifetime experience, specifically for bullying or
meanness and unwanted contact. This suggests that having an
NFE in adulthood, specifically bullying or meanness or unwanted
contact, may be less distressing than in adolescence.
Number of lifetime negative FB experiences
We also assessed the association between the number of
lifetime NFEs a person had and depressive symptoms, attempt-
ing to detect any threshold effect that might exist. Having four or
more experiences of any type of negative FB experience were all
associated with depressive symptoms. Each of these negative
experiences is likely to cause some form of social stress. Having
frequent experiences of this sort may cause a young person to
have chronic stress. Similar to the effects of a stressor or stressful
life event, chronic stress is known to be associated with
depression [34,35].
Importantly, for experiences of bullying or meanness on FB,
having one to three experiences was also associated with
depressive symptoms. This implies that experiences of bullying
or meanness on FB are unique; having even a single experience of
bullying or meanness on FB was associated with depressive
symptoms, while individuals needed to have at least four expe-
riences of other types to exhibit the same association with
depressive symptomatology.
Severity of upset for most recent negative FB experiences
It was important to assess the severity of upset resulting from
a person’s most recent NFE because, for certain NFE types, how
upsetting the experience was, rather than just having the expe-
rience, may be driving its association with depressive symptoms.
The more upsetting a person’s most recent NFE was rated, the
more likely they were to also self-report depressive symptoms.
The severity of upset reported from these experiences may be
correlated with the amount of life stress resulting from that
particular experience; the more stressful the experience, the
more likely a person is to be depressed [31e33]. This variation in
upset that we observed could be due to the particular context or
nature of the online experience or to how prone a person is to
being upset by online negative experiences, such as one’s fear of
negative evaluation.
Severity of upset for most recent negative FB experiences
In contrast to upset from most recent NFEs, assessing upset
from most recent past-year NFEs helped us to understand
whether upset from a recent NFE was more strongly associated
with depressive symptoms. However, upset from most recent
past-year NFEs was not more strongly associated with depressive
symptoms than upset from most recent lifetime NFE, specifically
for bullying or meanness. Therefore, upset from an NFE in young
adulthood, specifically bullying or meanness, may be less
distressing than upset from bullying or meanness on FB in
adolescence.
Limitations
There are several limitations of this study. First, we do not
know if reported negative experiences preceded the onset of
depressive symptoms. Therefore, having depressive symptoms
could increase one’s risk for NFEs or cause one to be more upset
by an NFE. Fortunately, we were able to control for preexisting
depressive symptoms in adolescence prior to any NFE. Second,
measures of NFE may be prone to recall bias. For example, par-
ticipants may not remember NFEs from as early as 2004 when FB
first started. Those who had more salient or more upsetting
experiences may be more likely to remember the experiences,
leading to differential misclassification of the exposure and
potentially
overestimating
the
association with
depressive
symptoms. Mitigating this concern, the reports of NFEs were
found to be reliable in test-retest analysis. Third, questions
regarding NFEs were consistently asked prior to the CES-D 10
assessment for all participants. Potentially, answering questions
about NFEs could introduce a priming effect for reporting more

 depressive symptoms in the CES-D 10 assessment. Finally, the
sample is predominantly white, non-Hispanic and majority
femaledand even significantly more so than the full third-
generation cohort. Thus, these findings may not be generaliz-
able to all young adults who have used FB.
In conclusion, lifetime negative FB experience, past-year
negative FB experience, number of lifetime negative FB experi-
ences, and severity of upset from most recent and most recent
past-year
negative
experiences
were
all
associated
with
depressive symptoms. Experiences of bullying or meanness on
FB were uniquely linked to depressive symptoms; having as few
as one to three negative lifetime experiences was associated with
depressive symptoms. Future work should examine: (1) whether
negative FB experiences cause incident depression or exacerbate
preexisting depression; and (2) who is most prone to being
upset by negative FB experiences. With further research, rec-
ommendations for limiting or altering FB use among high-risk
subpopulations
could
be
useful
in
reducing
depressive
symptoms.
