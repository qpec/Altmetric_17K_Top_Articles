Abstract 
Basophils are a rare granulocyte population that have been associated with allergic and 
inflammatory responses. It is essential to understand the regulatory mechanisms by which 
basophils are kept in check, considering the impact of dysregulated basophil function on immune 
responses 
under 
different 
pathological 
conditions. 
Among 
immunoregulatory 
cells, 
CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the key players that maintain immune 
tolerance. The mechanisms by which Tregs regulate and suppress diverse immune cell subsets 
have been studied extensively, but the impact of Tregs on basophil functions is not well 
understood. We report that human basophils are refractory to Treg-mediated suppression and 
found that Tregs stimulate resting basophils to induce the expression of activation markers 
including CD69, CD203c and CD13, and the release of basophil cytokines including IL-13, IL-8 
and IL-4. Mechanistically, Tregs could induce human basophil activation via IL-3 and STAT5 
activation, whereas cellular contact was dispensable. Inhibition of either IL-3-IL-3 receptor 
interactions or STAT5 phosphorylation abrogated Treg-mediated activation of basophils. These 
results provide evidence of direct positive effects that human Tregs have on basophil activation 
and reveal a previously unrecognized feature of this cell subset well known for 
immunosuppressive functions.

INTRODUCTION 
Basophils are rare granulocytes (approximately 0.5% of total leukocytes) that are important for 
the protection against helminth parasites. In addition, basophils mediate Th2 responses, support 
B cell differentiation and enhance humoral responses (1, 2). Activated basophils produce several 
immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13, IL-6, TSLP (Thymic stromal lymphopoietin) 
and BAFF (B-cell-activating factor) (1, 2). Through these mediators, basophils regulate T and B 
cell responses and are a critical link between innate and adaptive immunity (3, 4).  
 
Although rare in number, basophils are implicated in various pathological conditions in part due 
to their ability to undergo rapid activation in response to a wide range of stimuli and release of 
diverse immune mediators. Basophils are well known for their pathogenic role in allergic 
conditions through secretion of mediators of hypersensitivity reactions including histamine and 
leukotriene (1, 2, 5). Many inflammatory skin diseases are characterized by basophil infiltration 
and activation (6). Basophils are also reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune 
and other inflammatory diseases (7-11). Therefore, considering the impact of dysregulated 
functions of basophils on the immune response in various diseases, it is essential to understand 
the regulatory mechanisms by which basophils are kept in check.  
 
In this regard, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been widely studied for their role in immune 
tolerance and in the maintenance of immune homeostasis (12-14). Tregs modulate autoimmune 
and inflammatory responses by exerting direct suppressive effects on various immune cells 
including dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, macrophages, monocytes, B cells, NK cells and mast 
cells (15-19). These functions are mediated by inhibitory surface molecules (cytotoxic T 
 4 
 
lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (LAG-3)), inhibitory 
cytokines (TGF-β, IL-10 and IL-35) and cytotoxic molecules (granzyme and perforin). Although 
regulatory mechanisms by which Tregs suppress different immune cell subsets is an area of in-
depth study, the impact of Tregs on basophil function is not well understood. In view of 
emerging reports on the role of basophils in various pathological conditions, we investigated the 
interaction of Tregs with human basophils and its effects on basophil functions.  
 
Here we report that in contrast to other immune cells, human basophils are refractory to Treg-
mediated suppression. Tregs did not inhibit anti-IgE-mediated activation of basophils. 
Surprisingly, we found that Tregs induce activation of resting basophils characterized by 
significantly enhanced expression of activation markers and secretion of several basophil 
cytokines such as IL-13, IL-8 and IL-4. Mechanistically, these stimulatory functions of Tregs 
were mediated via IL-3 released from the activated Tregs that triggered STAT5 pathway while 
cell-to-cell contact was dispensable. Inhibition of either IL-3-IL-3 receptor (CD123) interaction 
or STAT5 phosphorylation abrogated Treg-induced activation of basophils. These results 
demonstrate the direct positive effects of human Tregs on basophil activation and uncover 
previously unrecognized features of these immunosuppressor cells.

RESULTS  
Human basophils are refractory to Treg-mediated suppression 
As Tregs are classically known for their immunosuppressive functions, we first evaluated the 
ability of human Tregs to suppress FcεRI-mediated basophil activation. In our assays, we used 
activated memory Tregs that have the ability to directly suppress target cells without need for 
undergoing differentiation process (20). Stimulation of basophils with anti-IgE antibodies that 
crosslink FcεRI-bound IgE on the basophils led to significant increase in the expression of 
various activation markers including CD203c, CD13 and CD69, and degranulation-associated 
markers CD63 and CD107a (Fig. 1A-H). Surprisingly, Tregs did not inhibit anti-IgE-mediated 
activation of basophils and the expression of various activation-associated markers on ‘Treg-
educated’ basophils were on par with that of anti-IgE-stimulated control basophils and ‘Tconv-
educated’ basophils (Fig. 1A-H).  
The effect of Tregs on the phenotype of basophils is reproduced in functional assays. We found 
that Tregs did not inhibit histamine release from anti-IgE-activated basophils (Fig. 1I). These 
results indicate that human basophils are refractory to Treg-mediated suppression. 
 
Human basophils lack receptors to receive contact-dependent inhibitory signals from Tregs 
We examined possible factors contributing to resistance of human basophils to Treg-mediated 
suppression. Suppression of target immune cells by Tregs is attributed to both contact-dependent 
and –independent mechanisms (15, 21-24). CTLA-4 and LAG-3 play a critical role in contact-
dependent suppression of target cells by Tregs through interaction with CD80/CD86 and HLA-
DR respectively (18, 25, 26). However, human basophils from the circulation (Fig. 2A) (27-30) 
and from secondary lymphoid organs such as spleen (Fig. 2B) (31) lack expression of HLA-DR 
 6 
 
and B7 co-stimulatory molecules under steady state as well as under stimulation conditions, 
although lipopolysaccharide-stimulated DCs, used as positive control, were all positive for these 
molecules (fig. S1). These results imply that the inability of Tregs to suppress activation of 
human basophils is in part due to absence of necessary receptors on basophils required to receive 
inhibitory signals. In addition, no significant differences in the viability of human basophils were 
observed when they co-cultured with Tregs (Fig. 2C and D). 
 
Human basophils are unresponsive to contact-independent inhibition by Tregs 
Several studies have demonstrated that Tregs mediate immune suppressive functions by 
cytokines, and in particular, TGF-β and IL-10 (21, 32, 33). The lack of suppressive effects of 
Tregs on human basophils raised an intriguing question on the expression of receptors for these 
cytokines. We found that circulating human basophils lack TGF-βRII (Fig. 2E), but, IL-10Rα 
was expressed on a subset of circulating human basophils (40.3±6.6%, n=6 donors) (Fig. 2E). 
Similar patterns of expression were observed on human splenic basophils (fig. S2). 
 
We explored if the IL-10Rα+ subset of human basophils could be modulated by IL-10. Basophils 
were treated with increasing concentrations of IL-10 (from 100 pg to 10 ng/ml) for 24 hours and 
then stimulated with anti-IgE during the last hour of culture. Even at the highest concentration 
(10 ng/ml), IL-10 did not modify the expression of activation markers on IL-10Rα+ or IL-10Rα- 
basophil subsets (Fig. 2F). IL-10 suppressed the expression of various activation markers on 
DCs, thus confirming the biological activity of this cytokine (fig. S3). Another report also 
indicated that IL-10 does not affect either IL-3 or IgE-mediated activation of human basophils 
 7 
 
(34). These results provide a potential explanation for the refractoriness of human basophils to 
Treg-mediated suppression.  
 
Tregs induce activation of resting basophils 
Since Tregs did not inhibit activation of human basophils, we examined the impact of activated 
Tregs co-cultured with resting basophils in the absence of any exogenous stimulation or 
cytokines for 24 hours. Tregs induced activation of human basophils as indicated by dramatically 
increased expression of the activation markers CD13, CD203c and CD69 (Fig. 3A and B). 
However, expression of CD63 and CD107a, the markers associated with basophil degranulation 
remain unaltered (Fig. 3C and D), indicating that Treg-induced activation of human basophils is 
not associated with degranulation. We confirmed that enhanced expression of activation markers 
on basophils upon co-culture with Tregs was not due to non-specific stimulation of basophils by 
anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 MAbs used for the activation of Tregs as the phenotype of basophils 
was not altered when they were cultured with these MAbs (fig. S4).  
 
Treg-induced activation of human basophils was not restricted to phenotypic changes and 
functional analysis of basophils also confirmed their activation. Tregs significantly induced the 
secretion of IL-13 and IL-8 from basophils (Fig. 4A and B). Although significant, induction of 
IL-4 was minimum (Fig. 4C). Analysis of cytokines produced by activated Tregs alone at 
equivalent numbers revealed that they produced minimal amounts of IL-13 (13.14.4 pg/ml, 
mean ± SEM, n=8), IL-8 (13.55.1 pg/ml, n=8) and IL-4 (7.33.0 pg/ml, n=8 donors). Together, 
these results demonstrate that Tregs induce activation of human basophils evidenced by 
phenotypic changes and secretion of cytokines (Fig. 3 and 4).

Cell adhesion is dispensable for Treg-induced activation of human basophils  
We aimed to identify the mechanism(s) by which Tregs induce activation of human basophils. 
Interaction of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) on Tregs with ICAM-1 (CD54) mediates adhesion and 
aggregation of Tregs on DCs (35-37). Previous studies have reported the expression of ICAM-1 
on basophil cell lines and circulating human basophils (38, 39). We confirmed expression of 
ICAM-1 on resting human basophils, which was enhanced upon IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 5A). 
ICAM-1 blockade did not abrogate Treg-induced activation of basophils (Fig. 5B-D), and we 
confirmed that ICAM-1 blocking antibodies were functional as they inhibited DC-mediated 
proliferation of CD4+ T cells (fig. S5). IL-3-stimulated human basophils expressed ICOSL (fig. 
S6A) but ICOSL blockade had no significant effect on Treg-mediated basophil activation (fig. 
S6B). These results suggest that adhesion of Tregs to basophils is dispensable for Treg-induced 
activation of basophils.  
 
We performed transwell experiments to confirm that cell-to-cell contact is dispensable for 
stimulating basophil activation by Tregs. Pre-activated Tregs were placed in the upper chamber 
and basophils in the lower chamber of the transwell system. Tregs in transwells induced 
significant expression of basophil activation markers (CD13, CD203c and CD69). The 
expression levels of activation markers were equivalent to levels induced on basophils co-
cultured with Tregs without transwell conditions (Fig. 5E). The leak-proof nature of transwell 
was confirmed by the absence of CD4+ T cells in the lower chambers of transwell (fig. S7).

Soluble mediators released from activated Tregs stimulate basophils 
Since cell contact was found not to be required for Treg-induced human basophil activation, we 
explored if soluble mediators released by activated Tregs mediate basophil stimulation. To 
examine this, we cultured resting basophils with cell-free supernatants from either unstimulated 
or anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated Tregs. Supernatants from unstimulated Tregs did not modify 
the expression of activation markers on basophils (Fig. 6). However, basophils cultured with the 
supernatants from stimulated Tregs showed significantly enhanced expression of CD13, CD203c 
and CD69 (Fig. 6A), but not degranulation-associated markers CD63 and CD107a (Fig. 6B). 
The expression pattern of these activation markers was identical to basophils co-cultured with 
activated Tregs (Fig. 3). These results thus confirm a role for soluble mediator(s) released from 
activated Tregs in stimulating basophil activation.  
 
Tregs induce human basophil activation by IL-3-dependent mechanism  
Previous reports have shown that IL-3 plays a crucial role not only in the survival (40, 41) but in 
the activation of basophils (39, 42, 43). IL-3 directly induces and enhances several activation-
linked markers on human basophils such as CD69, CD203c and CD13 (39, 44) and stimulates 
secretion of cytokines including IL-13 (45). In fact, the expression of activation markers and 
secretion of cytokines by human basophils co-cultured with Tregs were reminiscent of IL-3 
activity on basophils.  
 
Several recent articles identified activated CD4+ T cells as a major source of IL-3 (46-48). We 
found that anti-CD3/anti-CD28-activated Tregs secrete IL-3 in the range of 148±25 pg/million 
cells (mean ± SEM, n=11 donors) while resting Tregs did not secrete detectable levels of IL-3 
 10 
 
(fig. S8). A dose-response study indicated that treatment of human basophils with IL-3 at a 
concentration equivalent to that secreted by human Tregs could induce activation (fig. S9). This 
data thus validates that the quantity of IL-3 produced by Tregs is sufficient to induce basophil 
activation.  
 
To demonstrate unequivocally that Tregs induce human basophil activation by an IL-3-
dependent mechanism, we followed two independent approaches: blockade of IL-3 interaction 
with its receptor (IL-3R), and inhibition of IL-3-mediated signal transduction pathway. First, we 
blocked IL-3R on basophils before co-culture with activated Tregs. Consistent with our 
hypothesis, the expression of Treg-induced activation markers CD203c, CD13, CD69 and FcεRI 
on basophils was significantly reduced upon IL-3R blockade (Fig. 7A and B). In addition, IL-3R 
blockade also decreased Treg-induced secretion of IL-8 and IL-13 by basophils (Fig. 7C).  
 
IL-3 promotes priming of basophils for FcεRI-mediated degranulation and for the release of 
inflammatory mediators. In response to degranulation signals, Treg-activated basophils showed 
significantly enhanced expression of degranulation-associated molecules CD107a and CD63, and 
released histamine at levels similar to that observed with IL-3-FcεRI-activated basophils (fig. 
S10). These data confirm that Treg-activated basophils are functionally fit and that Tregs license 
basophils to undergo activation by degranulation signals.  
 
To further authenticate that IL-3 signaling is implicated in the Treg-mediated activation of 
basophils, we investigated STAT5 pathway (34). Tregs induced phosphorylation of STAT5 in 
basophils at levels similar to that observed by treatment with IL-3 used at an equivalent 
 11 
 
concentration produced by stimulated Tregs (Fig. 8A and B). Importantly, STAT5 inhibition in 
basophils led to abrogation of Treg-induced activation markers CD13, CD203c and CD69 on 
basophils (Fig. 8C) and the secretion of IL-13 and IL-8 (Fig. 8D). These data together 
demonstrate that IL-3 plays a critical role in inducing Treg-mediated activation of human 
basophils.

DISCUSSION 
In the present study we found that human basophils not only show unique refractoriness towards 
Treg-mediated suppressive effects but also undergo activation by Tregs. In mice, basophils and 
antigen-specific T cells were reported to be engaged in multiple serial interactions of short to 
moderate duration in the tissues (47). However, mouse and human basophils display differences 
in the expression of co-stimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules that play a critical role in 
the cross-talk between innate cells and T cells (27-30,49-53). Therefore, cognate interaction as in 
the case of classical antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and Tregs (54) is unlikely in the case of 
human basophils. Both Tregs and basophils are present in secondary lymphoid organs as well as 
in the peripheral tissues (31, 55, 56). In these sites, Tregs constantly receive activation signals 
from APCs leading to the secretion of IL-3. Consequently, without involving cognate interaction, 
IL-3 secreted from activated Tregs could impact basophils both at secondary lymphoid organs 
and peripheral tissues.   
 
Basophils play an important role in the protection against helminth parasites and various lines of 
evidence provide a pointer that IL-3 is central for these functions by supporting survival of 
basophils and promoting basophilia (57-59). IL-3 synergizes with basophil-derived IL-4 and IL-
13 to promote the alternative activation of monocytes (60). Alternative or M2 type monocyte-
macrophages are well recognized for their anti-inflammatory functions and for protection against 
nematode parasite (61). Thus, we propose that in vivo, under physiological conditions, Tregs 
might contribute to controlling the inflammation and to fight helminth infection by promoting 
basophilia and by enhancing the survival and activation of basophils via IL-3-dependent 
mechanism and by inducing IL-4 and IL-13.  Although activation of human basophils by Tregs 
 2 
 
led to induction of these cytokines, the effect on IL-13 secretion was particularly prominent. 
Based on the current evidence it appears that IL-4 response by human basophils is mostly 
dependent on IgE/FcεRI cross-linking. However, IL-13 could be induced in basophils by 
IgE/FcεRI-independent signaling as well (62). In this regard, IL-3 has been reported to provide 
adequate stimulus to induce IL-13 secretion by human basophils (44, 63). As Tregs induced 
activation of human basophils via IL-3-dependent mechanism, it provides an explanation for low 
induction of IL-4 and higher secretion of IL-13 by basophils. Abrogation of IL-13 (and IL-8) 
production by basophils either upon IL-3R blockade or STAT5 inhibition further validates that 
these cytokines are contributed mainly by basophils. 
 
Our study is limited to polyclonal CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ memory Tregs from the circulation of 
healthy donors. However, Tregs are highly diverse and in addition to FoxP3- Tregs (like Tr1 
cells), several distinct subsets of FoxP3+ Tregs have been identified. FoxP3+ human bonafide 
Tregs in the circulation consists of CD45RA−FoxP3hiCD4+ activated and CD45RA+FoxP3loCD4+ 
resting Tregs (20). Moreover, based on the expression of chemokine receptors CXCR3, CCR4, 
CCR10, and CCR6, memory Tregs were further classified into various effector Th-like Treg 
subsets (Th1-Treg, Th2-Treg, Th17-Treg and Th1/Th17 Treg) that are immunosuppressive, 
FoxP3+ but secrete effector cytokine(s) of a corresponding Th subset (64-68). Therefore, it is 
likely that IL-3 secretion pattern might vary among these distinct Treg subsets and as a 
consequence their effect on basophil activation. Additionally, IL-3 production by Tregs might 
also be influenced by signals they receive in the microenvironment and in particular, signals by 
basophils. Detailed analyses of the influence of basophils on Treg plasticity, phenotype, 
functions and cytokine secretion pattern, particularly IL-3, should shed light on these points. 
 3 
 
Although chronic inflammation promotes pathogenic reprograming of Tregs into Th cells (69, 
70), this might not be the case in our study as basophils-Tregs were cultured only for 24 hours. 
Another area that requires further exploration is whether IL-3 production and suppressive 
functions of Tregs are connected or independent process. In fact, it was suggested that reduced 
number and/or function of FoxP3+ Tregs in several immunodeficiencies such as 
immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX), Omenn syndrome 
and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome leads to enhanced Th2 cytokine production and as a consequence 
increased IgE levels (71). Defective functions of Tregs are also reported in diverse autoimmune 
and inflammatory diseases (72). A comparative analysis of Treg functions and IL-3 production in 
healthy versus immunodeficient and autoimmune patients, and their repercussion on basophil 
functions need to be performed.  
 
Multiple subsets of Tregs play an important role in the suppression of allergic responses both 
during sensitization phase and effector phase by targeting various cell types (73). Few reports 
however indicated that frequency of CD4+CD25+ Tregs is increased in patients with allergic 
rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, atopic and bronchial asthma (74-76). In addition, the number of Tregs 
has increased during exacerbation of asthma and allergic rhinitis (75, 76). Although, increased 
Tregs observed in these patients might represent response of the host to curtail pathogenic 
responses, our current data on the contrary suggests that enhanced Treg response observed in 
these patients might even aggravate allergic responses by activating basophils in an IL-3 
dependent manner to induce IL-13 and IL-4 that are Th2-associated cytokines and support IgE 
class-switch. In fact, the Treg number in pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis and bronchial 
asthma was reported to correlate positively with total IgE level (75). It is therefore likely that 
 4 
 
various specialized subsets of regulatory cells participate in the regulation of different arms of 
allergic response and that a particular Treg subset alone might not efficiently control allergic 
responses (77-80). For example, in allergic rhinitis patients, deficiency of allergen-specific IL-10 
producing Tr1 subset found to be associated with disease severity, though number and function 
of CD4+CD25+ Tregs in these patients did not change (81). Therefore, detailed investigation of 
various Treg subsets is crucial for establishing their correlation with diseases severity in allergic 
diseases. Considering that CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs activate basophils and could license them 
to undergo degranulation leading to histamine release, we suggest that simultaneous blocking of 
basophil responses is necessary to attain maximum benefits of Treg-targeted therapeutic 
approaches in allergic conditions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Study design 
 
This research was designed to investigate the regulation of human basophil functions by 
CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+ Tregs and underlying mechanisms. Cells were isolated from the buffy bags 
of healthy adult blood donors. As there was no intervention, blinding and randomization were 
not used. Depending on the number of experimental groups, our experimental design used 
repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Student’s-t-test to measure the level of 
significance. Acquisition of data from multiple independent donors for each of the parameters 
permitted us to control inter-individual variations in the experiments.  
 
Isolation of basophils  
Buffy bags of healthy donors were subjected to Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and cellular 
fractions containing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and basophils were collected. 
Basophils were isolated from these cells by using basophil isolation kit II (Miltenyi Biotec) and 
autoMACS®. The purity of basophils was 96±0.5% as analyzed by flow cytometry.  
 
Regulatory T cells 
For the isolation of CD4+CD45RO+CD25+ Tregs, untouched CD4+ T cells were first purified 
(CD4+ T cell isolation kit II; Miltenyi Biotec) followed by isolation of untouched memory T 
cells (CD45RO+) by depletion of naïve T cells using CD45RA microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). 
Further, CD25+ Tregs were positively selected from these memory T cells by CD25 microbeads 
(Miltenyi Biotec). Tregs were confirmed by phenotype analysis of various markers (fig. S11A) 
and by functional assays as detailed below (fig. S11B). CD4+CD45RO+CD25-/lo T cell fraction 
 6 
 
was used as conventional T cells (Tconv) for the comparison with Tregs (fig. S11). The purity of 
various T cell populations was 96±3%. 
 
CFSE-labelling of CD4+ T cells  
CD4+ T cells were washed and resuspended in PBS (10×106 cells/ml). Cells were incubated with 
carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE, 5 μM, BD Biosciences) at 37 °C in a water bath 
for 10 minutes followed by thorough washing with the medium. Labelled CD4+ T cells were 
resuspended in X-VIVO medium at a concentration of 106 cells/ml. 
 
Treg suppression assay 
For analyzing the suppression of Tconv proliferation by Tregs (fig. S11B), CFSE-labelled Tconv 
cells were cultured in serum-free X-VIVO 15 medium either alone (0.1×106 cells/200 μL) or 
with Tregs at 1:3 ratio in the presence of plate-bound anti-CD3 MAb (1 μg/ml) and soluble anti-
CD28 MAb (1 μg/ml). After five days, proliferation of Tconv cells was analyzed by flow 
cytometry based on the dilution of CFSE. 
 
Co-culture of basophils with Tregs or Tconv 
To investigate the effect of Tregs on anti-IgE-mediated activation of human basophils, basophils 
(0.1×106 cells/well/200 μL) were cultured in 96 well U-bottomed plate either alone in serum-free 
X-VIVO 15 medium or with IL-3 (2 ng/0.1×106 cells, ImmunoTools) or with IL-3 plus Tregs or 
Tconv cells (0.3×106 cells/well/200 μL) at 1:3 ratio for 24 hours. Tregs/Tconv in the co-culture 
conditions were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 MAb (1 μg/ml) and soluble anti-CD28 
MAb (1 μg/mL). During last one-hour culture, polyclonal affinity isolated anti-human IgE (ε-
 7 
 
chain specific, Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies (10 ng/0.1×106 cells) were added to stimulate the 
basophils.  
For measuring the viability of cells by Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI, Sigma-Aldrich) 
staining, basophils were cultured for 24 hours in medium alone or with IL-3 or IL-3 plus anti-
CD3/anti-CD28-activated Tregs or Tconv. Basophils were also stimulated with anti-IgE 
antibodies during last one-hour of the culture. As a positive control for Annexin V and PI 
staining, PBMCs were treated with gemcitabine (Sigma-Aldrich, 1 μg/0.5×106 cells/ml) for 24 
hours or 20% ethanol (200 L/0.5×106 cells/ml) for 30 min respectively (fig. S12).  
For the analysis of impact of Tregs on resting basophils, basophils (0.1×106 cells/well/200 μL) 
were cultured either alone in serum-free X-VIVO 15 medium or co-cultured with Tregs (0.3×106 
cells/well/200 μL) at 1:3 ratio for 24 hours. Tregs in the co-culture were stimulated with plate-
bound anti-CD3 MAb and soluble anti-CD28 MAb. 
To investigate the implication of either surface molecules or soluble mediators in Treg-induced 
basophil activation, basophils (0.1×106 cells) were either cultured alone in serum-free X-VIVO 
15 medium or with Tregs (0.3×106 cells/well/200 μL) or with Tregs in the presence of blocking 
MAbs (10 μg/ml) to ICAM-1, ICOSL or IL-3 receptor (CD123) or isotype control MAb for 24 
hours. Tregs in the all the co-culture conditions were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 
MAbs.  
To analyze if soluble mediators released from Tregs induce basophil activation, Tregs (0.3×106 
cells) were either cultured alone (resting phase) in serum-free X-VIVO 15 medium or were 
stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 MAbs for 24 hours. Cell-free culture supernatants were 
harvested and basophils (0.1×106 cells/well) were cultured for 24 hours either alone in serum-
free X-VIVO 15 medium or in the presence of supernatants obtained from unstimulated or 
 8 
 
stimulated Tregs.  
For transwell experiments, Tregs (0.3×106 cells/100 μL) were pre-activated with anti-CD3 and 
anti-CD28 MAbs for 24 hours. Basophils were placed in the lower chambers of transwells 
(Transwell, 0.4 μm, Corning) and pre-activated Tregs were added to the upper chambers of 
transwell. The cells were cultured for 24 hours.  
To analyze STAT5 activation, basophils were co-cultured with pre-activated Tregs (0.3×106 
cells/200 μL) at 1:3 ratio for 6 hours. As a positive control, basophils (0.1×106 cells/200 μL) 
were treated with IL-3 (100 pg/ml, an equivalent concentration produced by stimulated Tregs) 
for 6 hours. Cells were stained with anti-STAT5 (pY694) or isotype control MAbs by using Cell 
Signaling Buffer Set A (Miltenyi Biotec).  
To confirm the role of STAT5 in Treg-induced basophil activation, basophils (0.1×106 cells/200 
μL) were pretreated with STAT5 inhibitor CAS 285986-31-4-Calbiochem (20 μM, Merck 
Millipore) or equivalent volume of DMSO for 2 hours followed by co-culture with Tregs 
(0.3×106 cells) for 24 hours. Tregs in the co-culture were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-
CD28 MAbs.  
To determine whether Treg-activated basophils are functionally fit and Tregs license basophils to 
undergo activation by degranulation signals, basophils (0.1×106 cells/200 μL) were co-cultured 
with Tregs (0.3×106 cells/200 μL) for 24 hours in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 
MAbs. During last one-hour culture, anti-IgE antibodies (10 ng/0.1×106 basophils) were added to 
stimulate the basophils. 
Basophil response was examined by analyzing the expression of activation-associated markers 
by flow cytometry. Cell-free culture supernatants were collected from basophil-Treg co-culture 
experiments and subjected for the analysis of histamine or cytokines. 
 9 
 
Treatment of basophils with IL-10 
Basophils (0.1×106 cells/well/200 μL) were cultured in X-VIVO 15 medium either alone with 
IL-3 (2 ng/0.1×106 cells) or IL-3 plus increasing concentration of rhIL-10 (eBioscience) ranging 
from 100 pg/ml to 20 ng/ml, for 24 hours. During last one-hour culture, anti-IgE antibodies (10 
ng/0.1×106 cells) were added to stimulate basophils and the expression of activation markers was 
analyzed by flow cytometry. 
 
Isolation of human splenocytes 
Spleen pieces were mechanically disaggregated by gentleMACSTM dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, 
program m_spleen_04) and were then filtered through 70-μm nylon membrane filter (BD 
Biosciences) to obtain single-cell suspension of splenocytes. Splenocytes were then processed 
through Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation to remove red blood cells (RBC). RBC-
depleted splenocytes were then washed two times with RPMI 1640. Splenic basophils were 
distinguished from mast cells (CD117+) and DC subsets (BDCA 1-4+) and the expression of 
HLA-DR, CD80, CD86, IL-10Rα and TGF-βRII on these CD203c+FcεRI+ splenic-basophils was 
analyzed by flow cytometry. 
 
Culture of dendritic cells 
Monocytes from PBMC were isolated by using CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Monocytes 
were differentiated to DCs by culturing them with rhIL-4 (500 IU/106 cells) and rhGM-CSF 
(1000 IU/106 cells) (both from Miltenyi Biotec) for six days. Differentiation of DCs was 
confirmed by the analysis of surface markers. In addition, DCs were also stimulated with 
lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli O55:B5 (10 ng/0.5×106 cells, Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 
 10 
 
hours and analyzed for the expression of maturation-associated markers. 
To analyze the effect of IL-10 on DCs, cells were treated with rhIL-10 (10 ng/ml/0.5×106 cells) 
for 24 hours followed by analysis of surface markers by flow-cytometry. 
To explore the effect of ICAM-1 blockade towards DC-mediated CD4+ T cell proliferation, DCs 
were pre-incubated with ICAM-1 blocking MAb (20 μg/ml) or isotype control MAb for 2 hours 
followed by co-culture with CFSE-labelled allogeneic CD4+ T cells (0.1×106 T cells/well) at 
1:20 ratio in a total volume of 200 μL for five days. 
 
Measurement of histamine and cytokines 
Histamine was measured in the culture supernatants by histamine EIA kit (Bertin Pharma). IL-3 
(Quantikine ELISA kit, R&D systems), IL-8, IL-13 and IL-4 (ELISA Ready-SET-Go, 
eBioscience) were analyzed in the culture supernatants by ELISA. 
 
Statistical analysis 
Statistical analyses were performed by GraphPad Prism 6 Software. Data were analyzed by one-
way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison tests (α=0.05) or two-tailed paired Student’s t-
test as indicated. Two-way ANOVA with Least Significant Difference was used to analyze Fig. 
2F. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. *P< 0.05, **P<0.01, ***P< 0.001, and ****P< 0.0001.

pg/ml) for 24 hours. The expression of CD13, CD203c and CD69 (mean±SEM, n=2 independent 
experiments using cells from different donors) on basophils was analyzed by flow cytometry.

Fig. S10. Tregs license basophils to undergo activation by degranulation signals. Basophils 
(0.1×106 cells/200 μL) were cultured with IL-3 or co-cultured with Tregs at 1:3 ratio for 24 
hours in the presence of plate-bound anti-CD3 MAb and soluble anti-CD28 MAb. During last 
one-hour culture, anti-IgE antibodies (10 ng/0.1×106 basophils) were added to stimulate the 
basophils. (A) Expression of CD63 and CD107a (mean±SEM, n=4 independent experiments 
using cells from different donors) on the basophils under various experimental conditions. (B) 
Amount of histamine released by the basophils (mean±SEM, n=6 independent experiments using 
cells from different donors). *P<0.05; ***P<0.001; ****P<0.0001 by one-way ANOVA with 
Tukey’s multiple comparison test.

Fig. S11.  The phenotypic and functional features of isolated human Tregs. (A) 
Representative plots depicting the expression (extracellular or intracellular) of CD4, CD45RO, 
FoxP3, CD25, CTLA-4 and CD127 in isolated Tregs and Tconv cells. (B) Suppression of 
effector T cell proliferation (Tconv) by purified Tregs. Tconv cells were labeled with CFSE and 
were cultured in serum-free X-VIVO 15 medium either alone (left panel) or with purified Tregs 
at 1:3 ratio (middle panel) in the presence of plate-bound anti-CD3 MAb and soluble anti-CD28 
MAb. Right panel shows unstimulated Tconv cells. After five days, proliferation of Tconv cells 
was analyzed based on the dilution of CFSE.
