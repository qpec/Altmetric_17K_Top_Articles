Background-—High levels of ketone bodies are associated with improved survival as observed with regular exercise, caloric
restriction, and—most recently—treatment with sodium–glucose linked transporter 2 inhibitor antidiabetic drugs. In heart failure,
indices of ketone body metabolism are upregulated, which may improve energy efficiency and increase blood flow in skeletal
muscle and the kidneys. Nevertheless, it is uncertain how ketone bodies affect myocardial glucose uptake and blood flow in
humans. Our study was therefore designed to test whether ketone body administration in humans reduces myocardial glucose
uptake (MGU) and increases myocardial blood flow.
Methods and Results-—Eight healthy subjects, median aged 60 were randomly studied twice: (1) During 390 minutes infusion of
Na-3-hydroxybutyrate (KETONE) or (2) during 390 minutes infusion of saline (SALINE), together with a concomitant low-dose
hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp to inhibit endogenous ketogenesis. Myocardial blood flow was measured by 15O-H2O positron
emission tomography/computed tomography, myocardial fatty acid metabolism by 11C-palmitate positron emission tomography/
computed tomography and MGU by
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Similar
euglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and suppressed free fatty acids levels were recorded on both study days; Na-3-hydroxybutyrate
infusion increased circulating Na-3-hydroxybutyrate levels from zero to 3.8�0.5 mmol/L. MGU was halved by hyperketonemia
(MGU [nmol/g per minute]: 304�97 [SALINE] versus 156�62 [KETONE], P<0.01), whereas no effects were observed on palmitate
uptake oxidation or esterification. Hyperketonemia increased heart rate by �25% and myocardial blood flow by 75%.
Conclusions-—Ketone bodies displace MGU and increase myocardial blood flow in healthy humans; these novel observations
suggest that ketone bodies are important cardiac fuels and vasodilators, which may have therapeutic potentials. (J Am Heart

parked by the recent report of a 40% reduction in
cardiovascular mortality in diabetic patients treated with
sodium–glucose linked transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and
the findings of upregulated ketone metabolism in heart failure,
much scientific interest has lately focused on the potential
role of ketone bodies, such as 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB), as
life-prolonging cardioprotective fuel substrates.1,2
During metabolic stress conditions, such as exercise,
fasting, and severe acute illness, hepatic ketone body forma-
tion (ketogenesis) is stimulated by high levels of glucagon and
free fatty acids (FFAs) and low levels of insulin in the portal bed;
under such conditions, concentrations of the major ketone
body, 3-OHB, may rise from close to zero to above 5 mmol/L
and ketone bodies become an important fuel source. Since
most tissues extract ketone bodies in proportion to their
delivery,3 hyperketonemia results in a glycolysis-independent
pool of acetyl-CoA and ultimately energy in the form of ATP.
Oxidation of ketone bodies yields more ATP per mole of oxygen
consumed than does glucose,4 and ketone body oxidation does
not result in uncoupling in the mitochondrial membrane, which
is a byproduct of FFA oxidation.5,6 Ketone bodies may therefore

 spare hypoxic tissue. As potential results, ketone bodies are
neuroprotective,7 improve cognitive performance in patients
with cognitive impairment,8 and may ameliorate the effects of
acute brain injury and ischemic damage.9
Although less well explored, accumulating evidence indi-
cates that ketone bodies also have beneficial extracerebral
effects, notably in the heart. The healthy heart is omnivorous
and flexes readily between a mixture of glucose and the less
energy-efficient and reactive oxygen species producing FFAs
(�70%).10 In this setting, it is of interest that ketone bodies
have been demonstrated to (1) inhibit myocardial FFA
oxidation in pigs,11 (2) inhibit oxidative stress in cell
cultures,12 and (3) shift the failing heart in murine models
and in humans to ketone body utilization and downregulate
enzymes related to fatty acid oxidation.13,14 Collectively,
these observations suggest that increased myocardial oxida-
tion of ketone bodies may be a beneficial adaptive process.
Intriguingly, new data from the Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular
Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (EMPA-REG)
trial15 have led several investigators to propose that the 2- to
3-fold increase in ketone body levels observed in type 2
diabetic patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors may explain
the surprising and rapid 40% decrease in cardiovascular
mortality.2,16 In this context, it is of interest that insulin
resistance and type 2 diabetes are characterized by a 2- to 3-
fold increase
in
cardiovascular
mortality
together with
endothelial dysfunction and coronary microvascular dysfunc-
tion with impaired vasodilatory reserve.17,18 These defects are
associated with increased oxidative stress19 and it has been
shown that 3-OHB suppresses oxidative stress in mice12 and
increases local cerebral and renal blood flow in humans.20,21
A negative correlation between uptake of glucose and
ketone in the heart has been reported,22 but there is still a
lack of studies examining how isolated manipulation of ketone
body levels affect myocardial substrate utilization and blood
flow in humans. This is most likely because of the relative
inaccessibility of the heart and the invasive nature of cardiac
catheterization and tissue biopsy techniques. Moreover, the
use of labeled ketone body tracers to directly measure rates
of disappearance is inherently problematic because of
unpredictable loss of label by rapid isotopic exchange in the
acetyl-acetoacetyl CoA pool.23 Given these limitations, we
examined alterations of myocardial uptake of glucose and FFA
to explore the effects of myocardial ketone body exposure.
Ketone bodies suppress lipolysis and ketogenesis, and we
used a low-dose hyperinsulinemic clamp to control these
metabolic pathways.
Our study was designed as a randomized cross-over trial in
which either ketone bodies or a saline solution was infused
under controlled metabolic conditions to test whether hyper-
ketonemia would result in significantly suppressed myocardial
glucose uptake and increased myocardial blood flow.
Research Design and Methods
Study Participants
Eight healthy subjects (3 women) median age 60 (range 50–
68) and median body mass index 25.5 (range 21.5–34.6)
were recruited and completed the study. All subjects were
screened for inclusion in the weeks preceding the studies.
Screening included demographic data, clinical history, medical
examination, heart rate, and blood pressure. Two additional
subjects were originally included (1 woman, 1 man) but
withdrew because of claustrophobia during the scans.
The study protocol was performed in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local
institutional review board (Central Denmark Committee on
Health Research [no. 1-10-72-104-14]). All subjects signed a
written informed consent before entering the study.
Study Protocol
The study was a single-blinded, randomized cross-over study
where subjects were studied under identical euglycemic clamp
conditions and with identical positron emission tomography
(PET) scan procedures. Study days differed in intervention,
which was assigned in a random order. Study day A was a
placebo study day where saline (0.9%) was infused (SALINE),
whereas study day B included an infusion of 7.5% w/v Na-3-b-
hydroxy-butyrate (3-OHB) (KETONE) (Figure 1).
All subjects fasted overnight for 10 hours before the
study days. At t=�30 minutes, 2 catheters were inserted:
the first in an antecubital vein used for infusions and the
Figure 1. Study protocol. Study days (SALINE and KETONES)
were identical except for the intervention, which was either
infusion of Na-betahydroxybutyrate (OHB) or NaCl (0.9%). PET/CT
scans were initiated at t=180 minutes at which point quasi-stable
concentrations of metabolites were expected. CT indicates
computed tomography; FDG, fluorodeoxyglucose; FFA, free fatty
acids.

 second in a dorsal heated hand vein used for arterialized
blood sampling. At t=0 minute, a continuous infusion of
insulin (0.3 mIE/kg per minute [Humulin, Eli Lily, US]) and
glucose (200 g/L [Fresenius Kabi]) was initiated with the
glucose
infusion
rate
continually
adjusted
to
maintain
euglycemia (5 mmol/L). On study day A, a continuous
infusion of saline (0.9%) was initiated at t=0 minutes,
whereas a continuous infusion of OHB (0.18 g/kg per hour)
was initiated at t=0 on study day B. All infusions were
maintained throughout the study days and were discontin-
ued at t=390 minutes when all PET scans had been
completed. PET scans were performed at t=180 minutes
(15O-H2O), t=210 minutes (11C-palmitate), and at t=330 min-
utes (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]). Blood samples were
drawn at t=0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, and 390 min-
utes for analysis of FFAs and insulin and every 15 minutes
for
analysis
of
p-glucose
levels.
Lactate
levels
were
measured at t=120, 240, and 390 minutes. Blood pressure
and heart rate were measured every hour through the study
day.
Blood Samples
All blood samples excluding glucose were stored at �20°C
and analyzed in the same assay after all subjects had
completed both study days. FFAs were quantified using the
in vitro enzymatic colorimetric method assay NEFA-HR(2)
(Wako Chemicals GmbH, Germany), glucose and lactate
concentrations were measured using a YSI 2300 model STAT
plus (YSI Incorporated, Netherlands), and insulin was mea-
sured by ELISA. Serum concentrations of 3-OHB were
measured using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS).24
PET Scan Protocols
PET/CT scans were conducted using a Siemens Biograph 64
PET/CT (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Injections of radio-
tracers were done in the antecubital catheter used for
infusions. For arterial activity samplings (11C-palmitate), a
catheter was inserted in the contralateral radial artery at
t=120 minutes. Patients were placed with the heart in the
field of view and a low-dose CT scan was obtained for
attenuation
and
anatomic
localization
purposes.
At
t=180 minutes, 400 MBq
15O-H2O was administered and
simultaneously, a 6-minute list mode PET scan was begun
with the following time-frame sequence: 1910, 895, 4920,
2915, 3920, 2930, and 2960 s. Images were reconstructed
using a 3-dimensional (D) iterative algorithm (3 iterations, 21
subsets, 5-mm Gaussian postfilter), applying all appropriate
corrections for normalization, dead time, random coinci-
dences, scatter, and attenuation.
The 11C-palmitate scan was initiated at t=210 minutes
allowing for sufficient decay of residual
15O-H2O activity.
Thus, 11C-palmitate was injected as a bolus (283�65 MBq
[SALINE] or 274�62 MBq [KETONE]) and a 50-minute list
mode scan (frame structure 695, 6910, 3920, 5930,
5960, 89150, 49300 s) was performed with 37 manual
blood samples taken during the scan. Plasma as well as
whole-blood activity were measured in a well counter (Cobra
II; Packard Instruments Co.) cross-calibrated to the tomo-
graph.
Data
were
reconstructed
using
a
3D
iterative
algorithm (3 iterations, 21 subsets, 5-mm Gaussian postfil-
ter). Blood and dynamic PET data were decay corrected to
scan start. After completion of the
11C-palmitate scan,
subjects were moved to a bed in the adjoining room to await
the final scan.
At t=315 minutes, a second low-dose CT scan was
acquired using the same protocol as previously described.
At t=330 minutes, �200 MBq 18F-FDG was administered and
a 50-minute list mode scan (frame structure 1910, 895,
4910, 3920, 5930, 5960, 49150, 49300, and 19600 s)
was performed using 3D iterative reconstruction (3 subsets,
21 iterations, 4-mm Gaussian postfilter). Voxel size for all 3
scans was 49494 mm.
Tracer Kinetics
Perfusion: Myocardial blood flow (MBF), expressed in mL/g
per minute, was calculated using Cardiac VUer.25 In brief, the
arterial and venous blood pool were segmented automatically
and used to extract the arterial input function, which was then
used to generate parametric images of MBF. Then, these
parametric images were used for reorientation to short-axis
images on which the left ventricle was then defined
automatically and segmented according to the recommenda-
tions of the American Heart Association. MBF is reported for
the left ventricle as a whole, but also for the 3 vascular
territories (left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right
coronary).
Myocardial fatty acid metabolism
Using in-house developed software, myocardial fatty acid
metabolism was analyzed using a 3-tissue compartment
model in which 3 rate constants need to be fitted. In this
model, the efflux 11CO2 rate is fixed to the oxidation rate and
a slow esterification compartment is included. Macroparam-
eters myocardial fatty acid oxidation (MFAO), myocardial fatty
acid esterification (MFAE), and myocardial fatty acid uptake
(MFAU) were defined according to the suggestions by

Segmentation of the blood pool, reorientation of the
images, and definition of the left ventricle was performed in a
way similar to the analysis of the perfusion scans. For the all
calculations and parametric images, the input function was
corrected for 11C-metabolites using arterial blood samples as
validated by Guiducci et al.27
Myocardial glucose uptake
Myocardial glucose uptake (MGU) rate from the dynamic 18F-
FDG scan was estimated by Patlak analysis28 using Cardiac
VUer. Irreversible uptake rate, Ki, was first estimated from the
relation

where Ci is the myocardial 18F-FDG radioactivity and Cp is the
plasma 18F-FDG radioactivity at time t. Plots of Ci(t)/Cp(t)
versus ∫Cp(t)dt/Cp(t) were fitted to straight lines by conven-
tional least-squares methods and the slopes of the best fits
were taken as estimates of Ki. Absolute myocardial glucose
uptake rate (nmol/g per minute) was calculated using the
equation
MGU ¼ pGlc Ki
LC
where pGlc is plasma glucose concentration and LC is the
lumped constant. The lumped constant was assumed not to
differ between visits (as demonstrated by previous work
performed during similar study conditions)29 and was there-
fore fixed at 1.
Statistics
Normal distribution was assessed by inspection of QQ-plots
and data were ln-transformed when appropriate. Curves are
presented as means�SE, whereas all other data involving
group comparisons are presented as means�SD. Statistical
comparisons between study days were performed by a paired
t test or a mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA when
appropriate (time series). The mixed model was a 2-way
ANOVA with time and treatment as factor variables and the
time versus treatment interaction as the term of interest. The
level of significance was set at P<0.05. All statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS version 21.
Results
Hemodynamics, MBF, and pH
Blood pressure and heart rate during the study days are
presented in Figure 2. On the SALINE study day, blood
pressure and heart rate remained stable, whereas heart rate
increased �25% from 62�13 to 78�8 mm Hg during the
KETONE study day (repeated measurements treatment9time,
P<0.001).We observed a uniform 75% increase in resting MBF
in all vascular territories (at t=180 minutes) as shown in
Table 1. Arterial pH was measured in a subset of patients
(n=4) and increased from 7.42 (range 7.41–7.43) to 7.50

 increased rapidly during the KETONE study day, reaching
mean values �3 mmol/L at t=180 minutes with a further
increase to a �4 mmol/L plateau phase at t=300 minutes.
FFA levels decreased rapidly during both study days,
reaching an almost complete suppression at t=120 minutes.
A tendency towards lower levels of FFAs was observed
during the KETONE day even though this did not reach
statistical significance (Figure 3B). Average circulating lac-
tate levels were increased �35% by the ketone infusion
(Table 2).
The hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp increased insulin
levels by a factor of 3 with no difference in mean levels from
t=180 to 390 (Table 2). A dynamic difference was evident on
the KETONE study day, as insulin levels increased more in the
early stages while a late-onset decrease was observed from
t=240 minutes onwards (Figure 3C). Analyzed by repeated
measurements, the treatment versus time interaction was
significant. Finally, p-glucose levels were clamped �5 mmol/L
during both study days, with a tendency to increase during the
last hour of the investigations, coinciding with the 18F-FDG
PET/CT scan during which tight control of p-glucose is
difficult (Figure 3D).
Insulin Sensitivity
Insulin sensitivity as assessed by a low-dose HE-clamp was
not significantly different between study days, although a
trend towards greater glucose infusion rates was observed
during the ketone body infusion (Figure 4). No correlation was
observed between peripheral glucose uptake and MGU (data
not shown).
Myocardial 18F-FDG Uptake
Experimental
hyperketonemia
roughly
halved
myocardial
glucose
uptake
(304�97–155�61 nmol/g
per
minute
[P=0.03]) exclusively because of a reduction in relative
uptake rate (Ki) (Figure 5). No correlation was observed
between plateau 3-OHB levels obtained and the reduction in
MGU.
Myocardial 11C-Palmitate Metabolism
Oxidation and uptake rates were unaltered by the ketone body
infusion, whereas a small but significant increase was seen in
the re-esterification transfer rate (Table 3).
When macroparameters were calculated by multiplying
relative transfer rates by plasma FFA concentrations, we
found absolute uptake, oxidation, and re-esterification iden-
tical regardless of intervention (Figure 6).
Discussion
In line with our preliminary hypothesis, we observed a halving
of myocardial glucose uptake during experimental hyperke-
tonemia, supporting the notion that the human heart utilizes
and oxidizes ketone bodies at the expense of glucose in spite
of ongoing insulin stimulation. Hyperketonemia did not affect
myocardial fatty acid transport or oxidative capacity in a
metabolic setting of very low circulating FFAs, but increased
heart rate 25% and myocardial blood flow 75%.
Myocardial Glucose Uptake Is Halved by
Hyperketonemia
Several ex vivo studies have established that cardiomyocytes
oxidize ketone bodies at the expense of glucose,30,31
presumably by inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase32 or
possibly by sequestration of coenzyme A impairing oxidative
glucose flux at the entry to the tricarboxylic acid cycle.33 The
ex vivo and animal studies of cardiomyocytes have not
previously been extended to a human setting. However, there
is substantial indirect evidence from human studies to
support the notion. Ferrannini et al investigated cardiac
substrate metabolism across the heart in 16-hour-fasted
humans34 and reported that both fatty acids and ketone
bodies constituted a significant proportion of cardiac fuel
during basal conditions. The contribution from lipid fuels was
almost
completely
abolished
during
hyperinsulinemia.
Although the study indicates that the heart utilizes and
oxidizes ketone bodies after fasting, it did not establish to
which extent utilization of 3-OHB, glucose, and FFA was
affected by insulin, high levels of FFA, or intrinsic to the
moderately high levels of 3-OHB per se. By contrast, our data
clearly show that high levels of 3-OHB displace glucose
utilization by the myocardium in the presence of well-
controlled hyperinsulinemia and suppressed FFA levels. It is
of interest that the marked reduction in myocardial glucose
uptake occurred in the presence of a 75% increase in
myocardial blood flow. If anything, the increased myocardial
blood flow would be expected to increase myocardial glucose
uptake, which correlates with tissue perfusion in striated
muscle.35

 During a hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp, the heart
derives most of its ATP from oxidation of glucose or
lactate36 and only a small proportion from lipids. This was
also evident in this study, where glucose uptake during the
control study day (in lmol/g heart tissue/min) was 30-fold
higher than fatty acid uptake as opposed to a ratio of
roughly 1 observed in studies under normal fasting condi-
tions (see eg,37). It is therefore reasonable to assume that a
halving of MGU in absolute terms during the ketone body
infusion implies that a significant proportion of the heart’s
energy needs was met by ketone body oxidation, although
some of the reduction in MGU observed can also be
ascribed to the increased lactate levels. On the other hand,
increased lactate levels could also be a consequence of
either reduced entrance of glycolytic end products in the
tricarboxylic acid cycle because of substrate competition
from ketones,22 or limited transfer of reducing equivalents
through the malate–aspartate shuttle leading to reduced
metabolism of glucose and lactate.38,39

 Myocardial Fatty Acid Kinetics Is Unaltered by
Hyperketonemia in a Setting of Depressed
Circulating FFAs
In theory, ketone bodies can affect fatty acid metabolism
either at the level of entry into the cardiomyocytes or at the
mitochondrial level. At the level of entry, active transport of
fatty acids via CD36 may account for up to 60% of fatty acid
uptake into the cardiomyocytes40,41 while passive diffusion or
transport via other carriers account for the rest. At the
mitochondrial level, fatty acyl-CoA is transported into the
mitochondria for oxidation by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I.
Carnitine
palmitoyltransferase
I
activity
has
long
been
considered to be inhibited by malonyl-CoA, which increases
with intracellular energy substrate levels,10 but this concept
of a simple substrate feedback loop has now been chal-
lenged.42,43 In line with this, Stanley et al11 studied myocar-
dial fatty acid oxidation both during infusion of a lipid
emulsion and during infusion of lipids plus ketone bodies in
pigs and found a significant decrease in fatty acid oxidation
without affecting levels of malonyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, or acetyl-
coA decarboxylase. In that study, ketone bodies appeared to
inhibit fatty acid oxidation at the level of entry into the cell
rather than via inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. In
the present study, fatty acid transport capacity into the cells
was not affected by hyperketonemia as assessed by the
similar MFAU rates during the saline and b-hydroxybutyrate
infusions. Ketone bodies therefore do not appear to modulate
CD36 transport directly. The previously observed reduced
myocardial fatty acid uptake during hyperketonemia is more
likely because of reduced passive diffusion of fatty acids over
the sarcolemmal membrane. However, the intact cellular
membrane fatty acid transport capacity in the setting of
hyperketonemia was measured during almost completely
suppressed levels of circulating FFAs. For comparison,
myocardial fatty acid oxidation during modest hyperketone-
mia
(�1 mmol/L)
has
been
studied
by
others
using
11C-palmitate PET44 in human subjects and in dogs. In that
study, fatty acid oxidation was significantly decreased by
hyperketonemia, but this occurred in the presence of 50%
reduced circulating FFAs. Most likely, their findings reflected a
decreased supply of substrate rather than a direct inhibitory
effect of ketone bodies on the ability of the myocardium to
oxidize fatty acids.
In summary, our results from the kinetic analysis of
myocardial 11C-palmitate metabolism showed no effect of
hyperketonemia on relative or absolute fatty acid uptake and
oxidation rates, while relative esterification rates increased,
compatible with the notion that the inhibitory effect of ketone
bodies on myocardial fatty acid uptake is a consequence of
substrate competition.
Myocardial Perfusion and Heart Rate Is Increased
by Hyperketonemia
One of the more striking results of this study was the 75%
increase in myocardial blood flow observed during hyperke-
tonemia. There may be several explanations for this.
First, it seems obvious to relate this to the concomitant
25% increase in heart rate. Numerous studies have shown a
linear relationship between resting heart rate and MBF on a
population level (reviewed by45). However, on the level of the
individual, heart rate and myocardial perfusion do not
necessarily increase in tandem in the 60 to 80 beats/min
range, because any increase in heart rate shortens the
duration of the diastole whereby coronary blood flow is
inhibited. Only when heart rate is increased to such an extent
that metabolic factors become more prominent, does signif-
icant vasodilation occur. The relationship between increasing
heart rate and myocardial blood flow is therefore sigmoidal.46
The modest average ketone-induced increase in heart rate of
18 beats/min observed in this study should therefore not
translate into a 75% increase in MBF.
Second, it is possible that increased blood pH caused by
infusion of a b-hydroxybutyrate salt might affect myocardial
blood flow. Thus, acutely elevated levels of ketone bodies
result in a loss of potassium from the kidney tubules as the
cation
acts
as
a
partner
to
the
negatively
charged
b-hydroxybutyrate. Decreasing levels of potassium in the
blood spark an exchange of H+ from the blood with
intracellular potassium, and the resulting decrease in blood

 H+ constitutes a metabolic alkalosis. In line with this, 4
patients in whom we measured blood pH during the ketone
body infusion had pH values �7.5 and potassium just above
3 mmol/L. Since a discrete 0.08 increase in blood pH has
been shown to increase myocardial blood flow up to 50% in
mongrel dogs,47 it is conceivable that the mild metabolic
alkalosis our subjects suffered during the ketone body
infusion may contribute to the increased MBF.
Third, hyperketonemia seems to increase perfusion or
blood flow in other tissues independently of changes in pH or
heart rate. Forearm blood increases 15% in human volunteers
during infusion of b-hydroxybutyrate48 in amounts sufficient
to obtain plateau values of as little as 0.5 mmol/L, a fraction
of what we observed in this study. More interesting from a
physiological point of view are the numerous studies that
report a stimulatory effect of ketone bodies on cerebral blood
flow. Hasselbalch et al observed a 39% increase in cerebral
blood flow in human volunteers during short-term infusion of
b-hydroxybutyrate,20 a finding that could not be ascribed to
either blood glucose levels or pH, perhaps reflecting that
ketone bodies act directly on the endothelium to produce
vasodilation. Another study reported that 3-OHB infusion
increased renal plasma flow measured with hippurate by 20%
in
humans,21
thus
supporting
the
concept
of
general
vasodilatory effects of ketone bodies.
As outlined above, several factors may combine to explain
how infusion of ketone bodies results in a significantly
increased MBF, whereas the mechanisms leading to increased

 heart rate are more uncertain. If anything, b-hydroxybutyrate
decreases sympathetic outflow in HEK293 cells by antago-
nizing the G-Protein Coupled Receptor 41,49 which in theory
should translate into a decreased heart rate. Also, the modest
sodium loading associated with infusion of the ketone body
salt should contribute to a lowering of heart rate rather than
an increment.50 On the other hand, in studies in athletes fed a
ketogenic diet, resting heart rate has been demonstrated to
be slightly increased51 despite comparable levels of nore-
pinephrine. Unfortunately, measurements of heart rate have
not been reported in previous studies using exogenous ketone
body infusions to study the effects of hyperketonemia on
diverse segments of physiology and pathophysiology.20,52,53
It should be noted that many patients with the metabolic
syndrome and type 2 diabetes have endothelial dysfunction
and that increased myocardial perfusion in these patients may
have beneficial effects.54 It thus remains a possibility that the
sharp reduction in cardiovascular mortality following treat-
ment with SGLT-2 inhibitors in clinical trials15 could be caused
by a combination of increased myocardial blood flow and
increased myocardial oxygen efficiency driven by high levels
of ketone bodies.
Experimental Design
In vivo studies of substrate metabolism are inherently challeng-
ing. For instance, ketone bodies bind to nicotinic acid recep-
tors55 and inhibit peripheral lipolysis and reduce circulating
FFAs. Reduced levels of FFAs simultaneously increase insulin
sensitivity, lower insulin levels, and reduce blood glucose56 and
endogenous ketogenesis. As a result, any intervention involving
ketone bodies is bound to affect the most prominent circulating
energy substrates as well as their regulatory hormones.
This study was designed in an attempt to control these
particular challenges: The modest (0.3 mIE/kg per minute)
hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic
clamp
ensured
comparable
insulin and glucose levels on both study days while still
allowing for myocardial oxidation of other fuel sources. In
addition, the HE-clamp also suppressed adipose tissue
lipolysis and thus circulating fatty acids. Our subjects only

 differed significantly in terms of ketone body levels. Metabolic
conditions with ample supplies of glucose, high insulin, and
suppressed circulating fatty acid levels most closely mimic
the fed state. It can be argued that ketone body levels only
rarely are increased during feeding, but as previously
mentioned, this may be the case in patients with heart
failure57
or
in
diabetic
patients
treated
with
SGLT-2
inhibitors.15 Furthermore, a very recent study has shown that
co-administration of glucose and 3-hydroxybutyrate esters,
creating a similar metabolically favorable scenario with high
insulin levels and suppressed FFAs, improves exercise
performance in humans.58
Some major drawbacks to the study design should be
mentioned. By design, FFA levels were clamped at comparable
low levels on both study days, which does not reflect the
classical hyperketonemic setting of increased circulating FFAs
as seen during fasting, metabolic stress, or exercise. It is
possible that this may have influenced our estimates of 11C-
palmitate kinetics. Also, blood ketone body levels were exper-
imentally rapidly elevated and sustained for only 6.5 hours,
which precludes us from studying the metabolic effects of
putative negative feedback mechanisms on key ketolytic
enzymes in the heart.59 The proof-of-concept nature of the
study design called for a significant increase in circulating ketone
bodies in order to obtain robust primary end point results (PET-
based MGU). The ketone body concentrations obtained in our
volunteers are therefore much greater than what could be
expected from treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors or even several
days of fasting. Finally, our study design did not include direct
measurements of cardiac ketone body uptake, and we can
therefore only conclude by inference that the reduced myocar-
dial glucose uptake was replaced by ketone bodies.
Conclusion
We used dynamic 11C-palmitate, 15O-H2O, and 18F-FDG PET/CT
to demonstrate for the first time in humans that hyperketone-
mia in the setting of concomitant hyperinsulinemia significantly
reduces myocardial glucose uptake and increases myocardial
blood flow. The striking ability of 3-OHB to replace myocardial
glucose utilization and to increase myocardial blood flow
warrants further investigations of the potential of ketone
bodies to increase myocardial oxygen efficiency (eg, during
exercise and in patients with cardiac disease), in line with the
marked reduction of cardiovascular mortality in patients
rendered hyperketonemic by treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors.
