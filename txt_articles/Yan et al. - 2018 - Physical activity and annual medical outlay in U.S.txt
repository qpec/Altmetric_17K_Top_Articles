Multiple chronic conditions in cancer survivors are highly prevalent and may increase health care costs for both
patients and the health care system. Studies of cancer survivors reveal positive effects of physical activity (PA) on
reducing risk of cancer recurrence, other chronic conditions, and secondary cancer. Few nationally re-
presentative studies have examined how physical activity levels have affected survivors' annual economic
burden in the United States.
Leisure-time physical activity data from the National Health Interview Survey was linked to health care
expenditure data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data (2008–2012). We calculated per-person an-
nual total medical expenditures for identified colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer survivors. We conducted
multivariable analyses controlled for survival years and other sociodemographic variables. Generalized linear
models were performed to measure correlation between medical expenditure and PA level using STATA 14. All
analyses considered the complex survey design and were conducted in 2017.
Of 1015 cancer survivors sampled, 30% (n = 305) adhered to physical activity recommendation, while the
other 70% (n = 710) did not. Multivariable-adjusted expenditure in adherence group was $9108.8 (95% CI
7410.9–10,806.7) versus 12,899.1 (95% CI 11,450.2–14,348) in non-adherence group. Stratified analyses re-
vealed cancer survivors who adhered to their PA recommendation saved $4686.1 (1–5 years' survival time) and
$2874.5 (11 or more years' survival time) on average for total health care expenditure, respectively.
Analyses of the national representative sample revealed that the economic burden of survivors from the three
most prevalent cancers is substantial. Increasing survivor's PA to guidelines may reduce U.S. health care ex-
penditure.
1. Introduction
Cancer survivors, both those undergoing active treatment and those
who have lived with the diagnosis in the long term, are a steadily-
growing segment of the US population (Rim et al., 2016). There are
approximately 15.5 million cancer survivors in the United States, with
the number projected to exceed 20 million by 2026 (Miller et al., 2016).
The economic burden of cancer survivorship in the United States is
substantial (Guy et al., 2015). Every seven in ten survivors suffer from
multiple chronic conditions (MCCs), such as cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, and obesity (Edwards et al., 2014). These conditions (Rim
et al., 2016; Giovannucci et al., 2010) can complicate health care de-
livery (i.e., cancer treatment) and create practical concerns about sur-
vivorship care (Rim et al., 2016; Ward et al., 2014). The presence of
MCCs may also increase health care costs for patients and, more
broadly, for the health care system (Rim et al., 2016; Edwards et al.,
2014).
The MCCs and competing causes of death are believed to stem from
cancer treatment, genetic predisposition, and/or common lifestyle
factors (Demark-Wahnefried and Jones, 2008). Healthy lifestyle beha-
viors like physical activity (PA) hold promise for reducing the risk of
comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease (Hewitt et al., 2003;
Oeffinger and Hudson, 2004), diabetes (Earle et al., 2003), and obesity
(Chelbowski et al., 2002), and could prevent cancer recurrence and
cancer-specific mortality (Carmack Taylor et al., 2006; Parry et al.,
2011; Blackburn and Wang, 2007; Demark-Wahnefried et al., 2005),
and improve quality of life (Irwin et al., 2008; McNeely et al., 2006).

 activity in cancer survivors comes from people diagnosed with breast,
prostate, or colorectal cancer (Schmid and Leitzmann, 2014), the three
most prevalent types of cancers. These cancers, to some degree, appear
to have similar comorbidities associated with physical activity levels.
For instance, in the United States, patients with breast and prostate
cancer had a prevalence of 30–32% for comorbidity, and colorectal
cancer had a prevalence of 41% (Edwards et al., 2014).
Estimating the economic burden of cancer among patients with
comorbidities has become increasingly important for physicians, em-
ployers, policy makers, health care systems, and for society at large. To
our best knowledge, few nationally-representative studies have ex-
amined how physical activity levels affect survivors' annual economic
burden in the United States, particularly among survivors of prostate,
colorectal, and breast cancers. Given the fact that more people are
surviving to older ages with MCCs, it is critical to explore how public
health prevention strategies, such as promoting physical activity, might
affect survivors' medical costs, in the context of recent transformations
that embed prevention in the broader health care delivery system. Such
research can provide decision makers in both public and private sectors
with evidence in the hope of implementing fundamental changes, thus
altering the way in which we deliver health care.
To date, the majority of studies with detailed information on eco-
nomic burden (i.e., from surveillance, epidemiology, and end results
(SEER)-Medicare
databases)
were
conducted
exclusively
among
Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older (Mariotto et al., 2011;
Yabroff et al., 2011; Yabroff et al., 2008). The Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey (MEPS), conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Re-
search and Quality (AHRQ), is a nationally representative survey of the
civilian non-institutionalized population of all ages in the US. MEPS is
also the only national data source that measures Americans' use of, and
payment for, medical care and health insurance. It provides compre-
hensive information about all types of health insurance, in cancer sur-
vivors of all ages. More importantly, MEPS contains socioeconomic
variables, including education and income level, which are highly
correlated to individual health behavior patterns but not available in
clinically and insurance-based datasets like SEER-Medicare.
The purpose of this study is three fold: (1) to examine the pre-
valence of MCCs and physical activity adherence; (2) to examine the
association between MCCs and annual health care costs; and (3) to
examine how physical activity adherence affects an individual's annual
total economic burden, among a nationally representative sample of
prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer survivors in the United States. In
particular, we examined the independent effects of physical activity
adherence on total health care expenditures, and stratified by lengths of
survival.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and data source
We measured the association between annual health care ex-
penditures
and
individual
adherence
to
physical
activity
re-
commendations among cancer patients, by pooling cross-sectional data
from the 2008–2012 MEPS (Cohen et al., 2009) and its corresponding
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data (National Center for
Health Statistics, 2017). Since MEPS respondents are from a subsample
of NHIS with a shared unique identifier, we were able to link two da-
tasets using the linkage files provided by the National Center for Health
Statistics Data Center. The linked NHIS/MEPS data (Quality AfHRa,
2017) allowed us to access multiple variables for the same respondents
from both data sources. The MEPS is an ongoing annual survey main-
tained by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. It collects
detailed information on demographics, socioeconomic status, health
conditions, health service utilization and costs from a nationally re-
presentative sample of non-institutionalized civilian Americans, as well
as their medical providers and employers. The linkage to NHIS further
provided data on respondents' minutes of moderate and vigorous phy-
sical activities. This study included adult patients aged 18 and older,
who were diagnosed with any of the three most prevalent types of
cancers: prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer. Our original sample
size was 1092, and listwise deletion resulted in a final analytical sample
of 1015 cancer survivors.
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Health care expenditures
Our outcome of interests was annual total health care expenditure
derived from MEPS. Total health care expenditures are the sum of all
direct actual third-party (private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid,
Veterans Administration, other federal sources) payments made to the
providers for various types of services rendered, plus the out-of-pocket
spending by the individual or family during the calendar year. These
services included inpatient and outpatient care, emergency department
visits, prescriptions, home health care, durable medical equipment,
dental care, and eye care.
2.2.2. Physical activity level
The primary independent variable indicated whether respondents
adhere to physical activity recommendations. In the NHIS, participants
were asked about weekly frequency and average duration of leisure-
time physical activities of at least 10 min duration including 1) vig-
orous-intensity activities (i.e., heavy sweating or large increases in
breathing or heart rate) and 2) moderate-intensity activities (i.e., light
sweating or slight to moderate increases in breathing or heart rate). We
first calculated total minutes per week of vigorous or moderate activity,
then categorized participants into two levels of physical activity using
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (US
Department of Health and Human Services, 2008): 1) adherence to
physical activity guidelines (total minutes equal to 150 or more of
moderate-intensity physical activity per week or total minutes equal to
75 min or more of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week); 2)
non-adherence including insufficiently active, or inactive.
2.2.3. Covariates
We also controlled for demographic characteristics, socioeconomic
status, and health conditions in multivariable analyses, including age in
year,
race/ethnicity
(Hispanic,
non-Hispanic
white,
non-Hispanic
Black, and Non-Hispanic other), education attainment (less than high
school, high school, and college and above), income level (≥125%
vs. < 125% Federal Poverty Level), insurance status (uninsured vs. in-
sured), cancer type (breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer),
chronic conditions and cancer survival time (0–5, 6–10, 11 years and
above). If one patient was diagnosed with two or more types of cancer,
we used the most recent one to define survival time. The respondents
were asked whether they had been told by a doctor or other health
professional that they had any of the following common chronic con-
ditions, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, dia-
betes, emphysema, asthma, and arthritis. We also defined overweight or
obesity with their self-reported body mass index (BMI) being > 25 kg/
m2 (National Heart L, and Blood Institute, 1998). All the respondents
were further categorized into three groups by their number of condi-
tions, including 0, 1, 2 and above. For the purpose of the analyses, we
categorized numbers of chronic conditions into three groups: none, one,
and two and above.
2.3. Statistical analysis
Data was obtained in 2017. We first performed univariate analyses
to describe the distributions of annual health care expenditure, demo-
graphic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and health conditions by
physical activity adherence. We used a Pearson χ2 test to examine
whether expenditure and other covariates varied significantly between

119
 groups. We further employed multivariable generalized linear models
with a log link and gamma distribution to model the relationship be-
tween annual expenditure and physical activity. Lastly, we conducted
stratified analyses to explore whether the impact of physical activity on
expenditure was consistent across the extent of survival. Since MEPS
adopts a multi-stage design with weights to reflect nonresponse rate, we
conducted all the analyses adjusted for this complex survey design and
weight using svyset command (Machlin et al., 2005) in Stata version
14.0 MP (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to produce national estimates.
A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
3. Results
Table 1 presents annual health care expenditure, demographic, so-
cioeconomic, and health characteristics of respondents by adherence to
physical activity recommendations. Of 1015 cancer survivors in our
sample, 30% (n = 305) adhered to physical activity recommendations,
while the rest 70% (n = 710) did not. On average, a cancer survivor
who adhered to the recommendation spent $9172 (95% Confidence
Interval [CI]: 7266.1–11,078.6) per year on health care, which was
significantly lower (p = 0.003) than non-adherers ($12,907.8; 95% CI:
11,380.2–14,435.4). In the adherence group, 9.9%, 47.0% and 43.9%
of survivors were diagnosed with colorectal, breast, and prostate
cancer,
respectively,
compared
to
20.2%
(p < 0.001),
50.3%
(p = 0.425), and 31.3% (p < 0.001) in the non-adherence group.
There was no significant difference in the lengths of survival between
two groups.
Participants in the adherence group tended to be younger (64.9 vs.
69.8 years old, p < 0.001) and non-Hispanic black (7.0% vs. 12.5%,
p = 0.001) than those from the non-adherence group. Survivors who
did not follow physical activity recommendations were more likely to
have less than high school education (21.4% vs. 8.6%, p < 0.001) and
an annual income below 125% Federal Poverty Level (20% vs. 9.7%,
p < 0.001). The adherence group also had a lower number of chronic
conditions than the non-adherence group. For example, 15.8% of pa-
tients with adherence to the recommendation reported no chronic
conditions diagnosed by health care professionals, while the percentage
in the non-adherence group was only 9.0% (p = 0.001).
In the multivariable regression model controlling for demographic
characteristics, socioeconomic status, health condition, the total annual
health care expenditure all remained negatively associated with survi-
vors' adherence to physical activity recommendations (Table 2). Among
all cancer survivors, multivariable-adjusted annual expenditures were
significantly
different
(p = 0.009)
between
the
adherence
group
$9108.8 (95% CI 7410.9–10,806.7) and the non-adherence group
12,899.1 (95% CI 11,450.2–14,348). Survivors who were uninsured
and had longer cancer survival lengths spent less on health care than
those with insurance, and those who had been diagnosed in recent
years, respectively. Having more than two chronic conditions was sig-
nificantly associated with higher expenditure among survivors.
Stratified analyses further revealed that the impacts of physical
activity in decreasing health care expenditure varied across lengths of
survival in patients with cancer (Table 3). On average, the cancer sur-
vivors who adhere to physical activity recommendations spent $4686.1
(1–5 years survival time, p = 0.002) and $2874.5 (11 years and longer
survival time, p = 0.037) less for total annual health care expenditure,
respectively. Such expenditure savings were not found in patients with
6–10 years of survival time.
4. Discussion
In the current study, we linked the 2008–2012 MEPS database, a
nationally representative survey of the US non-institutionalized civilian
population, to the National Health Interview Survey at the individual
level. The findings show that for survivors of colorectal, prostate and
breast cancers, adherence to physical activity recommendations were

 associated with decreased total annual health care expenditure, in-
dependent of demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status and
other health conditions. We also found that the impacts of adherence to
physical activity, with the presence of multiple chronic conditions, on
annual health care expenditure vary according to length of the survival
time. The current study adds to the literature that the considerable fi-
nancial burden for cancer survivors associated with inadequate levels of
physical activity in the United States could potentially be reduced by
increasing their physical activity to levels consistent with current
guidelines (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2008) and
Healthy People 2020 objectives (U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, n.d.).
It is well known that multiple chronic conditions are common
among cancer survivors (Rim et al., 2016). Survivors with comorbid-
ities incurred significantly higher total medical costs and out-of-pocket
expenses compared to cancer survivors without additional comorbid-
ities (Rim et al., 2016). Thus, the economic impact of chronic condi-
tions on cancer survivorship is substantial (Rim et al., 2016; Guy et al.,
2013). Although evidence (Booth et al., 2012; Schmitz et al., 2010)
shows that lack of exercise increases the risk of multiple chronic dis-
eases and certain cancers, our data of survivors of three most common
cancers show that approximately one third of the survivors adhered to
physical activity recommendations. Our adherence rate was similar to
the rate of physical activity adherence from a National Cancer Institute
2015 national survey (National Cancer Institute, 2017), where 38.3% of
cancer survivors aged 18 years and older reported no physical activity
in their leisure time. It is worth noting that ethnic disparities in ad-
herence were observed. For example, of all racial and ethnic groups
examined in this study, Hispanic and Black cancer survivors and sur-
vivors of lower income and educational levels were more likely to be
non-adherent to physical activity guidelines than white patients. Our
statistics highlight the need to incorporate culturally competent inter-
ventions aimed at increasing exercise for survivors of diverse racial or
ethnic backgrounds. When educating breast cancer survivors, programs
should address sociocultural factors that may hinder or facilitate en-
gagement in exercise.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that quantifies impacts of
physical activity adherence on medical expenditures in adult survivors
of three most common types of cancers at the national level in the
United States. By linking two groups of nationally representative survey
data, this study enables important comparisons of the economic burden
between subgroups. Specifically, on average, survivors who adhere to
physical
activity
recommendations
spend
significantly
lower
($9108.80) than non-adherers ($12,899.10) on health care per year.
Our findings are consistent with a recent study (Valero-Elizondo et al.,
2016) on medical cost savings as a result of physical activity among
patients who had cardiovascular disease. In particular, we found that
regular exercisers saved average health care costs of over $4500 (sur-
vival length of 1–5 years) and over $2800 (survival length of 11 years
and longer) per year than those who did not meet exercise guidelines.
In a recent study, Ding et al. (2016) concluded that inactivity costs the
United States almost $28 billion annually in medical expenses and lost
productivity.
Our
findings
are
encouraging
and
reflect
the
re-
commendations from the Exercise Is Medicine (EIM) Initiative (Lobelo
et al., 2014), JAMA (Berra et al., 2015), and Circulation (Kraus et al.,
2015) to translate physical activity research into health care practice.
However, cost effectiveness cannot be limited to calculations of health
care costs alone. The value of regular physical activity far exceeds the
monetized benefits. Increases in physical activity behavior improve
physical and mental functioning, quality of life, and other non-health
dimensions of wellbeing (i.e., the impact of exercise on income and
family earnings, mood states, etc.).
The results of an active lifestyle's insignificant influence on medical
spending from the 6–10 year survival group seem puzzling. Two reasons
may help to explain this surprising finding, including relaxation of
vigilance and delayed side effects from treatment. Five-year survival,
often considered as a critical milestone, demands persistent vigilance
and surveillance from cancer patients. The relaxation of this vigilance
after the first five years possibly results in the development and ex-
pression of comorbidities that are independent of physical activity, thus
increasing health care expenditure. However, in a long run exemplified
by over 10-year survival, patients who comply with recommendations
on physical activities would still benefit from health care spending re-
duction associated with decreased age-related inactivity risks. In addi-
tion, cancer-specific and treatment-induced side effects, including car-
diovascular toxicity (Agrawal, 2014; Albini et al., 2010), cognitive
impairments (Falleti et al., 2005; Vardy, 2009), treatment-induced bone

 loss (CTIBL) (Edwards et al., 2011), fatigue (Silva et al., 2015), pain
(Silva et al., 2015), and others, do not always arise immediately after
cancer treatment. It is critical to raise awareness among the medical
community about the importance of managing those long-term treat-
ment-related side effects or complications. As breast cancer becomes a
chronic condition, health care practitioners must recognize and manage
the long-term sequelae of the constellation of therapeutic modalities.
Long-term survivors face many challenges as they transition from active
treatment to living the rest of their lives. They represent a unique and
extremely complex group of patients. Not only do they have the chal-
lenge of dealing with multiple long-term side effects of treatment pro-
tocols, but many are also forced to address the preexisting comorbid-
ities of their therapies, which often include multiple other issues (Bodai
and Tuso, 2015). Although most survivors will not die of the three most
common types of cancer presented in this study, their multiple chronic
conditions (e.g., obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes
mellitus) will most certainly increase health care expenditures and af-
fect disease-free survival as well as, ultimately, overall survival and
quality of life.
This study has several important strengths. First, MEPS is a na-
tionally representative household survey of health care utilization and
expenditures. It is one of the most detailed data sources available for
estimating medical expenditures and out-of-pocket costs. The current
linked data from the NHIS and MEPS include a large, nationally re-
presentative sample, allowing for broad generalizability of findings to
non-institutionalized U.S. adults. Second, the NHIS and the MEPS
contained relevant variables that permitted us to include many cov-
ariates and provided data that could be used to conduct stratified
subgroup analyses. As demonstrated by our findings, the unique sub-
group economic analyses on length of survival may shed light on what
specific survivor groups' primary care providers need to pay special
attention to when implementing long-term survivorship care for cancer
survivors, including continuing testing for cancer, managing side ef-
fects, encouraging healthy behaviors, and coordinating medical care.
Third, the physical activity measure categorized individuals into levels
consistent with current physical activity guidelines (Miller et al., 2016).
Last but not least, as comprehensive, population-based data on cancer
patients and comorbidities is limited, the current study can provide us
with an initial understanding of the timing and impact of the onset of
chronic conditions and physical activity for survivors.
Although MEPS is one of the most detailed and nationally re-
presentative data sources available for estimating the economic burden
of cancer survivorship, there are a number of limitations in this study.
First, this study relied on household-reported data, including the
identification of cancer survivors, which introduces potential reporting
biases. However, such bias may be limited given the general agreement
between household reports and physician-reported conditions (Guy
et al., 2013). Second, we were unable to examine the burden by cancer
site (i.e., analyze colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer survivors se-
parately) given the inadequate sample size. Lastly, the cross-sectional
study design would not allow us to examine the causal relationship
between physical activity and health care expenditure. Future research
is warranted to investigate this by using longitudinal data collected
from cohort studies.
Our study revealed that the economic burden of survivors is sub-
stantial. Increasing survivors' physical activity in accordance with
guidelines may reduce U.S. health care expenditure. However, only a
limited number of cancer survivors meet the guidelines. This suggests a
more integrated health care delivery model that incorporates and em-
phasizes the role of public health professionals or primary care provi-
ders to promote an active lifestyle and achieve health care spending
reduction within the system.
