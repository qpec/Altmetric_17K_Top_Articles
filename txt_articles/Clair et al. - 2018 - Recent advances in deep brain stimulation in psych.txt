Abstract
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been offered to patients suffering of
severe and resistant neuropsychiatric disorders like Obsessive Compulsive
Disorder (OCD), Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (TS) and Major
Depression (MDD). Modulation of several targets within the
cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits can lead to a decrease of symptom
severity in those patients. This review focuses on the recent clinical
outcomes in DBS in psychiatric disorders. Studies on OCD and TS are now
focusing on the long-term effects of DBS, with encouraging results
regarding not only the decrease of symptoms, but also quality of life. They
also highlighted efficient adjuvant techniques, like cognitive and
behavioural therapy and support programs, to enhance an often-partial
response to DBS. The application of DBS for MDD is more recent and,
despite encouraging initial open-label studies, two large randomised
studies have failed to demonstrate an efficacy of DBS in MDD according to
evidence-based medicine criteria. Last years, DBS was also tested in other
resistant psychiatric disorders, as anorexia nervosa and addiction, with
encouraging preliminary results. However, today, no target – whatever the
disease – can meet the criteria for clinical efficacy as recently defined by an
international committee for neurosurgery for psychiatric disorders.
Consequently, DBS in psychiatric disorders still needs to proceed within the
frame of clinical trials.

 Introduction
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical technique 
based on the stereotactic implantation of quadripolar electrodes 
 
delivering high-frequency current in a specific subcortical or 
 
deep cortical structure. It is usually indicated to decrease symp-
toms in neurological disorders, such as the hypodopaminergic 
symptom spectrum associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). 
The reversibility of DBS, supporting its ethically “acceptable” 
 
status, combined with the improvement of psychiatric symptoms 
after lesional surgeries has certainly led to the transition towards 
its application in psychiatric disorders1. Patients with severe 
debilitating disease, resistant to medical and psychotherapeutic 
 
optimal treatment, were enrolled in studies modulating cortico-
striato-thalamo-cortical circuits with DBS.
DBS was first used to improve obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD)2 and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (TS)3 symptoms 
in 1999. In both disorders, patients feel compelled to perform 
repetitive motor and vocal tics (in TS) or repetitive behaviour 
 
associated with intrusive ideas (compulsions and obsessions) 
 
(in OCD). Based on the efficacy of previous lesional surgeries1, 
the first targets were the anterior limb of internal capsule (ALIC)2 
in OCD and the centromedian-parafascicular complex (CM-Pf) 
in TS3; 3 years later, an important decrease of comorbid OCD 
symptoms was reported in two parkinsonian patients stimulated 
in the subthalamic nucleus (STN)4. The same year, given the 
 
effects of globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS on hyperkinesia 
in PD, a patient with TS was stimulated in the postero-ventral 
 
GPi and showed postoperative clinical improvement5. Then, 
based on pathophysiological evidence involving the subgenual 
cortex (BA 25, also termed Cg25) in major depressive disorder 
 
(MDD), the modulation of this structure with DBS was tested 
and led to an improvement of MDD symptoms6. Here, we will 
 
present the recent developments of DBS in psychiatry, including 
the clinical outcomes for OCD, TS, and MDD patients and other 
emerging psychiatric applications.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder
Randomised controlled studies have confirmed the initial 
reports by B. Nuttin2 and L. Mallet4 and highlighted two main 
 
targets for OCD: the striatal region (including the ALIC, 
the nucleus accumbens, the ventral caudate nucleus, and the 
 
ventral capsule/ventral striatum)7–9 and the STN10. Two recent 
 
meta-analysesfound that DBS leads to a global decrease of 
 
about 45% of OCD symptom severity with 60% of patients con-
sidered responders11,12.
Recent studies are now focusing on the long-term effects of 
DBS, which represents a decisive step to consider a broader 
application of DBS for OCD. In agreement with the report from 
 
Greenberg et al. 3 years after DBS in the striatal region7, a 
 
stability of the initial decrease of OCD symptoms has been 
 
reported until 9 years after DBS13,14. Case reports that also suggest 
a stability of symptom decrease 6 months15 and 10 years after 
 
STN stimulation16,17 have been published.
In addition, one may wonder whether the evaluation of DBS effi-
cacy is limited to the decrease of OCD symptoms (as measured 
by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, or Y-BOCS). 
The recent focus on quality of life is related to a chronological 
 
(that is, after proving symptoms reduction), historical (that is, 
regarding the past misconducts in psychosurgery), and tran-
snosographic (see Agid et al.18) legacy. Indeed, the team of 
 
D. Denys has chosen to follow its initial cohort9 by evaluating as 
a primary outcome the quality of life and subjective lived expe-
rience of the patients stimulated in the striatal region13,19,20. After 
3 to 5 years of DBS, patients reported a significant improve-
ment in quality of life13. Curiously, it improved in responders and 
 
non-responders to DBS as defined by Y-BOCS fluctuations, thereby 
questioning the psychometric limits and the relevance of this 
 
primary outcome measure for severe populations. In addition to 
the previously known effects of striatal DBS (for example, mood 
and anxiety), patients of this cohort reported that they became 
“more easy and loose”, “more self-confident”, and “expressive” 
 
but also experienced “difficulties in their relationship with 
 
partner” after DBS19. Changes regarding the perception of 
 
themselves, their families, and other problems with social adjust-
ments have been noticed in parkinsonian patients after clinical 
 
improvement by STN DBS21. Thus, the psychological and social 
changes experienced by patients with OCD could be unspecific 
and highlight the lack of control groups in the studies on DBS for 
OCD13,19. Currently, a European multicentre study is comparing 
the quality of life of severe OCD patients stimulated in the STN 
 
versus optimised conventional treatment17.
In the study by De Haan et al., we also noticed that patients 
reported an effect of DBS on the ability to engage in cognitive 
 
behavioural therapy (CBT)19. Notwithstanding that almost all 
of the OCD patients included in DBS studies had initially failed 
to complete CBT, the cohort of D. Denys et al.9 experienced an 
additional decrease of OCD symptoms after post-operative 
 
CBT22. This interesting result places CBT as a potential strategy 
to enhance an often-partial response to striatal DBS in OCD and 
 
raises the interest in assessing this effect after STN stimulation.
Finally, the search for an optimal target in OCD is ongoing. 
Although a recent meta-analysis failed to find a significant 
 
difference between the efficacy of DBS in the striatal region and 
STN12, a multicentre randomised trial is currently comparing 
the efficacy and safety of ventral capsule/ventral striatum versus 
STN DBS for OCD (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01329133). 
Otherwise, a case study reported a decrease in OCD symptoms 
after DBS of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB)23, a promising 
 
target in MDD24.
Gilles de la Tourette syndrome
In the same way as OCD, the promising results reported in the 
two initial case studies3,5 were replicated, identifying two main 
 
targets for TS: the thalamus (including CM-Pf, dorsomedial 
nucleus, ventro-anterior and ventro-lateral) and the GPi (including 
the motor part [that is, postero-ventral] and associative-limbic part 
 
[that is, antero-medial]). For both targets, a recent meta-analysis 
also confirmed the efficacy of DBS with a median improve-
ment of 52% in tic severity25. However, this encouraging result is 
 
based mostly on open-label studies. It included only three 
 
randomised controlled studies, which had contradictory results, 
Page 3 of 7
F1000Research 2018, 7(F1000 Faculty Rev):699 Last updated: 17 MAY 2019
 obtained from small samples, and most of them targeting the 
 
thalamus26–28. Thus, the efficacy of DBS for TS seems to be 
 
lacking evidence, especially in the GPi, a promising target with 
fewer side effects than the thalamus.
With the aim of providing evidence of the efficacy of GPi DBS 
on TS, two double-blind cross-over studies were recently con-
ducted in larger samples29,30. Unfortunately, although the team of 
 
Kefalopoulou29 found a significant decrease of (only) 15% in tic 
severity during the double-blind phase, no significant difference 
was measured by Welter et al.30. However, for both, the improve-
ment went up to 40% during the (open-label) follow-up period, 
and there were many inter-individual differences. This clearly 
 
highlights the difficulties in finding results in double-blind 
 
studies that are as encouraging as those in open-label ones. The 
placebo effect but also methodological issues (for example, 
duration of the blind period and limitation of the stimulation 
 
settings to preserve masking) and the chosen target (motor or 
 
associative-limbic 
part 
of 
the 
GPi) 
could 
explain 
this 
 
difference29,30. These limitations would probably be examined 
by the innovative database31 recently created to consider new 
 
guidelines for trials using DBS in TS. The aim of this database 
was also to share and gather clinical experiences with DBS in 
TS31, which offer a faster accumulation of evidence for DBS 
 
efficacy.
Recent studies are now interested in the long-term effects of 
 
DBS, as in OCD. Long-term side effects already reported after 
 
thalamic stimulation32 have even led some authors to propose a 
 
different target to their patients with TS33. Conversely, the long-
term follow-up of TS patients stimulated in the GPi gave encour-
aging results34,35, including an improvement in quality of life36. 
Unfortunately, as already reported in patients with OCD19,20 
and PD21, patients have difficulties in coping with changes after 
 
DBS36. Consistently, the author stressed the importance of a 
 
multidisciplinary team and the need to approach patients about 
“how life will continue with or without tics”36. This relevant 
 
consideration has already been successfully tested in PD patients 
with a perioperative psychoeducation program, leading to better 
social adaptation and a decrease of anxiety and depression37. Given 
the numerous psychiatric diseases often comorbid to TS, such a 
support program could be an interesting strategy to increase an 
often-partial response to DBS in TS.
Major depressive disorder
Although the literature on DBS for patients with MDD is rela-
tively recent, numerous open-label studies have highlighted a 
decrease of depressive symptoms after DBS. Indeed, the results 
of the first trial stimulating Cg256 were confirmed by subsequent 
studies38–40. As is the case for OCD, DBS of the ventral striatal 
region leads to improvement of depressive symptoms in open-label 
 
studies41–43.
Recently, the efficacy of DBS in MDD was tested in two large 
double-blind randomised sponsored studies. Inclusions of patients 
in these studies began shortly after the initial publication by 
 
Mayberg et al.6, probably motivated by the influence of high-
level studies on a wider application of DBS and the frequency 
of MDD. Targeting the striatal region, a first study planned to 
 
include more than 200 MDD patients for DBS44. It was pre-
maturely interrupted after including (only) 29 patients, as no 
 
significant difference was measured between the stimulated and 
non-stimulatedgroups. The same was observed for the largest 
 
DBS study in psychiatry, which failed to find significant 
 
differences after the stimulation of Cg25 among the 90 MDD 
 
patients included45. These disappointing results are counterbal-
anced by the recent demonstration of significant improvement 
in MDD symptoms after ALIC DBS (with 40% of responders) 
 
in a third trial46. This last study is still the only randomised con-
trolled trial to show a significant effect of DBS on depression.
Taken together, these recent results highlighted the safety of 
DBS in MDD. However, one cannot conclude whether DBS 
has an effect on depression. Trying to find the reasons for this 
 
“failure” is a current debate within the DBS community. Some 
have pointed to the methodology of the randomised trials, 
 
specifically the way (for example, the delay and the algorithm used) 
to find the optimal stimulation parameters, and even the design of 
the study (for example, a cross-over versus parallel design and 
the duration between inclusion and blind period). Furthermore, 
 
the clinical characteristics of the patients with MDD are 
 
criticised, especially the duration of symptoms in some patients 
(up to 12 years) that could lead to a potential delayed effect of 
 
DBS45 or be a measured manifestation of a special clinical 
 
phenotype of non-responder patients. The fact that the results 
have not been very encouraging until now reasonably raises the 
 
question of whether or not to continue trials with this invasive 
 
procedure in psychiatric patients.
However, these negative results could be explained by a target 
issue. Indeed, a dramatic improvement of depressive symptoms 
was measured after DBS of the supero-lateral medial fore-
brain bundle (slMFB) in open-label studies24,47. Now, one could 
 
wait for the results from a randomised study targeting this struc-
ture in MDD48. They would be of particular interest to confirm, as 
75% of patients are still responders 1 year after the start of DBS 
 
and have no serious side effects48.
Other psychiatric disorders
In recent years, several successful cases of DBS application to 
 
different neuropsychiatric disorders have been reported. As 
 
mentioned by the authors, those cases are in fact indicative of 
 
forthcoming open-label studies. If all of them succeed, we will 
know whether DBS of the slMFB decreases depressive symp-
toms in bipolar patients49, whether the stimulation of baso-lateral 
 
amygdala improves resistant post-traumatic stress disorder50, 
and whether DBS of the striatal region is effective in heroin51 
or cocaine52 addiction or even in schizophrenia53.
In patients with resistant anorexia nervosa (AN), encouraging first 
results were obtained on their body mass index (BMI) after the 
stimulation of Cg2554. Even if the first open-label study, includ-
ing six AN patients stimulated in Cg25, led to disappointing 
results concerning the evolution of BMI55, a significant increase of 
 
BMI was then measured in a larger group (16 patients with AN) 
stimulated in the same target54. Additionally to an increase in

 BMI, patients have experienced an improvement in mood and 
anxiety. As the same team have already used this target to 
 
decrease depressive symptoms in MDD6,38, one cannot exclude 
a positive bias of mood on the primary outcome measure (BMI). 
Other open-label trials are ongoing to replicate these results 
and to test the efficacy of other targets (especially the striatal 
region) in AN (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT03168893 and 
 
NCT01924598).
Conclusions
Long-term effects of DBS are encouraging about both the 
 
absence of relapse and the improvement in quality of life in 
 
severe and resistant TS and OCD. On the other hand, recent 
 
years have been marked by disappointing results of randomised 
studies in DBS for TS and MDD.
This raises the question of DBS’ efficacy for psychiatric disor-
ders, framed by a growing concern for ethics56,57. Key principles 
of medical ethics are discussed, such as the ability to make an 
 
autonomous decision (also suggesting giving informed consent) 
or authorize a research procedure58 or changes in personality 
 
following DBS20. A consensus document on ethical and scien-
tific conduct for psychiatric surgery was recently published56. 
This document also mentioned that to make a conclusion regard-
ing DBS’ efficiency (for a specific psychiatric population 
 
stimulated in a specific target), at least two studies managed by 
two different teams are necessary56. Today, despite numerous 
 
randomised trials, no target in any psychiatric disease can meet 
these criteria.
This could be partially explained by heterogeneous clinical 
 
manifestations of psychiatric patients within a common diagno-
sis. Indeed, the DBS of a defined target may modulate the symp-
toms linked to a specific dysfunctional and partially overlapping 
 
neuronal circuit involved in psychiatric manifestations59.
Shared databases, as recently initiated for DBS in TS, are an 
encouraging way to promote scientific reflexion and hopefully 
 
improve clinical efficacy of DBS in TS and maybe in other 
 
psychiatric disorders. This could also contribute to the identi-
fication of optimal targets for specific subgroups of patients, 
 
paving the way to precision medicine in psychiatry for severe and 
 
refractory mental disorders.
