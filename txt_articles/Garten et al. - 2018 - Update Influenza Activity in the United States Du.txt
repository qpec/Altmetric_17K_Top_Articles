The United States 2017–18 influenza season (October 1, 
2017–May 19, 2018) was a high severity season with high 
levels of outpatient clinic and emergency department visits 
for influenza-like illness (ILI), high influenza-related hospi-
talization rates, and elevated and geographically widespread 
influenza activity across the country for an extended period. 
Nationally, ILI activity began increasing in November, reaching 
an extended period of high activity during January–February, 
and remaining elevated through March. Influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses predominated through February and were predominant 
overall for the season; influenza B viruses predominated from 
March onward. This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* 
during October 1, 2017–May 19, 2018.†
Virus Surveillance
CDC receives influenza test results from public health and 
clinical laboratories located in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the 
District of Columbia through U.S. World Health Organization 
(WHO) Collaborating Laboratories and the National 
Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). 
During October 1, 2017–May 19, 2018, clinical laboratories 
tested 1,210,053 specimens for influenza virus; 224,113 (18.5%) 
tested positive (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/54973), including 151,413 (67.6%) for influenza A 
and 72,700 (32.4%) for influenza B. Nationally, the percentage 
of clinical laboratory–tested specimens positive for influenza virus 
peaked for 5 consecutive weeks during January 13–February 10 
* The CDC influenza surveillance system collects five categories of information 
from eight data sources: 1) virus surveillance (U.S. World Health Organization 
collaborating laboratories, the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus 
Surveillance System (NREVSS), and novel influenza A virus case reporting); 
2) outpatient illness surveillance (U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness 
Surveillance Network [ILI-Net]); 3) mortality (the National Center for Health 
Statistics Mortality Surveillance System and influenza-associated pediatric 
mortality reports); 4) hospitalizations (FluSurv-NET, which includes the 
Emerging Infections Program and surveillance in three additional states); and 
5) summary of the geographic spread of influenza (state and territorial 
epidemiologist reports). https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm.
† Data as of June 1, 2018.
(surveillance weeks 2–6) (range = 26.1%–26.9%). Regionally,§ 
the week of peak clinical laboratory influenza positivity varied, 
ranging from the week ending December 30 (week 52) to the 
week ending February 17 (week 7).
Public health laboratories tested 98,446 specimens during 
October 1, 2017–May 19, 2018; 53,790 (54.6%) were positive 
for influenza viruses, including 38,303 (71.2%) positive for 
influenza A and 15,487 (28.8%) for influenza B (Supplementary 
Figure 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/54974). Among the 
37,681 seasonal influenza A viruses subtyped, 31,977 (84.9%) 
were influenza A(H3N2), and 5,704 (15.1%) were influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09. Influenza B lineage information was avail-
able for 11,950 (77.2%) influenza B viruses; 10,612 (88.8%) 
were B/Yamagata lineage, and 1,338 (11.2%) were B/Victoria 
lineage. Whereas influenza A(H3N2) viruses accounted for the 
majority of circulating viruses, the proportion of influenza A 
viruses subtyped as A(H1N1)pdm09 ranged regionally from 
9.0% in the central United States to approximately 24% in the 
northwestern and southeastern United States. Influenza B viruses 
were more commonly reported than were influenza A viruses 
from early March to late May (weeks 9–20). The proportion 
of influenza B viruses reported regionally ranged from 23.0% 
in the Midwest to 40.6% in the northwestern United States.
Among 47,121 (87.6%) patients who tested positive for sea-
sonal influenza virus by public health laboratories and for whom 
age data were available, 3,802 (8.1%) were aged 0–4 years; 
11,550 (24.5%), 5–24 years; 15,597 (33.1%), 25–64 years; 
and 16,172 (34.3%), ≥65 years. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses

predominated among all age groups, ranging from 51.2% of 
viruses among persons aged 5–24 years to 70.0% among per-
sons aged ≥65 years. The largest proportion of reported influ-
enza B viruses (36.5%) occurred in persons aged 5–24 years.
Antigenic and Genetic Characterization of 
Influenza Viruses
Public health laboratories participating as U.S. WHO col-
laborating laboratories submit a subset of influenza-positive 
respiratory specimens to CDC for virus characterization 
through three National Influenza Reference Centers in the 
California, New York, and Wisconsin state public health labo-
ratories. CDC characterizes influenza viruses through genomic 
sequencing and antigenic characterization (using hemaggluti-
nation inhibition [HI] or neutralization assays). This process 
evaluates whether genetic changes in circulating viruses have 
led to antigenic drift away from the vaccine reference virus.
Influenza-positive specimens are sequenced using next-
generation sequencing (NGS)¶ on the MiSeq System platform 
(Illumina), using genomic enrichment practices (1,2) adapted 
by CDC. Genomic data are analyzed to determine the genetic 
identity of circulating viruses and submitted to public databases 
(GenBank or GISAID EpiFlu).
CDC evaluates the antigenic similarity** between ferret 
antisera raised against reference viruses representing the rec-
ommended vaccine components of the Northern Hemisphere 
2017–18 vaccine and circulating viruses isolated and propa-
gated in mammalian cell culture. Since the 2014–15 season, 
many influenza A(H3N2) viruses propagated in mammalian 
cell culture have lacked sufficient hemagglutination titers for 
antigenic characterization using HI assays. Therefore, in addi-
tion to the use of the HI assay, a subset of influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses are antigenically characterized using a focus reduction 
assay (FRA) to assess the ability of various antisera to neutralize 
infectivity of the test viruses.
CDC has genetically characterized 3,329 influenza 
viruses collected since October 1, 2017, including 832 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 1,313 influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses, and 1,184 influenza B viruses. A subset of these viruses 
was also antigenically characterized.
 ¶ Next generation sequencing uses advanced molecular detection to identify 
gene sequences from each virus in a specimen and thus reveals the genetic 
variations among many different influenza virus particles in a single specimen; 
these methods also reveal the entire coding region of the genomes. https://
www.cdc.gov/amd/project-summaries/influenza-vaccines.html.
 
** A virus is considered “reference virus-like” if its hemagglutination inhibition 
(HI) or neutralization focus reduction assay (FRA) titer is within fourfold of 
the homologous HI/FRA titer of the reference strain. A virus is considered as 
low to the reference virus if there is an eightfold or more reduction in the HI 
or FRA titer when compared with the homologous HI or FRA titer of the 
reference strain.
Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene 
segments from 832 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected since 
October 1, 2017, showed that all viruses belonged to sub-
clade 6B.1 (Supplementary Figure 3, https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/54975). This has been the predominant HA clade 
in the United States since the 2015–16 season (3). Of the 
736 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses analyzed using HI assays, 
735 (99.9%) were well inhibited (i.e., reacted at titers that 
were within fourfold of the homologous virus titer) by fer-
ret antisera raised against cell culture–propagated 6B.1 virus 
A/Michigan/45/2015, the reference virus representing the 
A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine virus for the 2017–18 Northern 
Hemisphere influenza season.
A total of 1,313 influenza A(H3N2) viruses were sequenced, 
and phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene segments indicated that 
multiple clades/subclades were cocirculating (Supplementary 
Figure 3, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/54975), with 3C.2a 
predominating. Viruses with the 3C.2a HA emerged at the end 
of the 2013–14 season and have remained the predominant 
clade since the 2014–15 season (4), undergoing continued 
genetic diversification each season. Among 655 representative 
A(H3N2) viruses antigenically characterized by HI or FRA, 
612 (93.4%) were well inhibited by ferret antisera raised against 
A/Michigan/15/2014 (3C.2a), a cell-propagated reference 
virus representing A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (the A(H3N2) 
component of the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza 
vaccines). Only 6.6% of A(H3N2) viruses, the majority of 
which belonged to genetic clade 3C.3a, showed evidence of 
antigenic drift (i.e., had eightfold or greater reductions in 
HI or FRA titers compared with reference virus titers). In 
contrast to the 93.4% of A(H3N2) viruses that were well 
inhibited by ferret antisera raised against cell-propagated 
A/Michigan/15/2014, only 48.2% of viruses tested were well 
inhibited by ferret antiserum raised against the egg-propagated 
A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 reference virus representing the 
A(H3N2) vaccine component. A higher proportion (77.3%) 
of viruses tested were well inhibited by ferret antisera raised 
against egg-propagated A/Singapore/INFIMH-16–0019/2016 
reference virus, representing the A(H3N2) component recom-
mended for the 2018 Southern Hemisphere and the 2018–19 
Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.
Phylogenetic analysis of 896 influenza B/Yamagata-lineage 
viruses showed that all HA gene segments belonged to 
clade Y3 (Supplementary Figure 3, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/54975), which also predominated in the 2016–17 season 
(5). All 824 B/Yamagata lineage viruses that were antigenically 
characterized were antigenically similar to cell culture–propa-
gated B/Phuket/3073/2013, the reference virus representing 
the B/Yamagata-lineage component of quadrivalent vaccines 
for the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza season.

The HA gene segment of 288 influenza B/Victoria-lineage 
viruses sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed belonged 
to genetic clade V1A, the same genetic clade as the vaccine 
reference virus, B/Brisbane/60/2008. However, 234 (81.3%) 
viruses had a six-nucleotide deletion in the HA gene segment 
(encoding amino acids 162 and 163). Viruses like these, previ-
ously abbreviated as V1A-2Del and now designated as V1A.1, 
were first reported during the 2016–17 season (5). Among 270 
antigenically characterized influenza B/Victoria viruses, only 
53 (19.6%) were antigenically similar to cell culture–propa-
gated B/Brisbane/60/2008, the reference virus representing 
the B/Victoria lineage component of 2017–18 Northern 
Hemisphere vaccines. All 217 B/Victoria viruses that were 
poorly inhibited by antisera raised to B/Brisbane/60/2008 (i.e., 
had eightfold or greater reductions in HI titers compared with 
reference virus titers) had the V1A.1 HA segment. Circulating 
B/Victoria lineage V1A.1 viruses were well inhibited by ferret 
antisera raised against B/Colorado/06/2017, a V1A.1 reference 
virus representing the influenza B component recommended 
for the 2018–19 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine.
Antiviral Susceptibility of Influenza Viruses
CDC tested 4,619 influenza viruses from the United States 
collected since October 1, 2017, for resistance to the influenza 
neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications recommended 
for use against seasonal influenza (oseltamivir, peramivir, and 
zanamivir). Among 1,147 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses 
tested for oseltamivir and peramivir susceptibility, 11 (1.0%) 
were resistant to both drugs and contain a known marker 
of resistance in the neuraminidase gene segment (H275Y). 
Among 786 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses also tested 
for zanamivir susceptibility, no resistant viruses were detected. 
All 2,354 influenza A(H3N2) viruses tested for oseltamivir 
and zanamivir susceptibility were susceptible to both medica-
tions. No peramivir-resistant viruses were detected among 
1,248 A(H3N2) viruses tested. All 1,118 influenza B viruses 
tested were susceptible to all three medications. High levels of 
resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) 
persist among influenza A viruses. Adamantane drugs are not 
recommended for use against influenza at this time.
Composition of the 2018–19 Influenza Vaccine
The Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related 
Biologic Products Advisory Committee recommended that 
the 2018–19 trivalent vaccine to be used in the United States 
contain an A/Michigan/45/2015 A(H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an 
A/Singapore/INFIMH-16–0019/2016 A(H3N2)-like virus, and 
a B/Colorado/06/2017-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus (6). The 
quadrivalent vaccine recommendation included the trivalent vac-
cine viruses as well as a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata 
lineage) virus. The B component recommendation represents a 
change in the influenza B/Victoria lineage component recom-
mended for the 2017–2018 Northern Hemisphere and 2018 
Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. The B component 
change was made because of the increasing global circulation of 
an antigenically drifted B/Victoria lineage virus (V1A.1) (7). The 
A(H3N2) recommendation represents an update to the 2017–
2018 Northern Hemisphere vaccines but is the same A(H3N2) 
virus recommended for the 2018 Southern Hemisphere vaccine. 
The decision to update the A(H3N2) component was not made 
to address antigenic drift, but rather because the egg-propagated 
A/Singapore vaccine virus is antigenically more similar to circu-
lating viruses than the egg-propagated A/Hong Kong vaccine 
virus recommended for the Northern Hemisphere 2017–2018 
vaccine. Vaccine recommendations were based on factors includ-
ing global influenza virologic and epidemiologic surveillance, 
genetic characterization, antigenic characterization, and the 
candidate vaccine viruses that are available for production.
Outpatient Illness Surveillance
Nationally, the weekly percentage of outpatient visits for 
ILI†† to health care providers participating in the United 
States Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network 
(ILINet) was at or above the national baseline§§ level of 2.2% 
for 19 consecutive weeks (weeks 47–13) during the 2017–18 
season (Figure 1). The percentage of outpatient ILI visits 
exceeded 7.0% for three consecutive weeks, peaking at 7.5% 
during the week ending February 3, 2018 (week 5). During 
the 2012–13 through 2016–17 seasons, peak weekly percent-
ages of outpatient ILI visits ranged from 3.6%–6.1% and 
remained at or above baseline levels for an average of 16 weeks 
(range = 11–20 weeks).
ILINet data are used to produce a weekly jurisdiction-level 
measure of ILI activity,¶¶ ranging from minimal to high. For the 
weeks ending December 30, 2017–February 24, 2018, approxi-
mately half of the 53 jurisdictions experienced high ILI activity 
 
†† Defined as a fever (temperature ≥100°F [≥37.8°C], oral or equivalent) and 
cough or sore throat, without a known cause other than influenza.
 
§§ The national and regional baselines are the mean percentages of visits for 
influenza-like illness (ILI) during noninfluenza weeks for the previous 3 seasons 
plus two standard deviations. Noninfluenza weeks are defined as periods of 
≥2 consecutive weeks during which each week accounted for <2% of the 
season’s total number of specimens that tested positive for influenza. National 
and regional percentages of patient visits for ILI are weighted based on state 
population. Use of the national baseline for regional data is not appropriate.
 
¶¶ Activity levels are based on the percentage of outpatient visits in a jurisdiction 
attributed to ILI and are compared with the average percentage of ILI visits 
that occur during weeks with little or no influenza virus circulation. Activity 
levels range from minimal, corresponding to ILI activity from outpatient 
clinics at or below the average, to high, corresponding to ILI activity from 
outpatient clinics much higher than the average. Because the clinical definition 
of ILI is nonspecific, not all ILI is caused by influenza; however, when 
combined with laboratory data, the information on ILI activity provides a 
clearer picture of influenza activity in the United States.

each week, with the highest number (46; 87%) during the weeks 
ending January 27–February 10, 2018 (weeks 4–6). During the 
past 5 seasons, the highest number of jurisdictions experiencing 
high ILI activity in a single week ranged from 16 (30%) during 
the 2015–16 season to 31 (58%) during the 2012–13 season.
Geographic Spread of Influenza Activity
State and territorial epidemiologists report the geographic 
distribution of influenza in their jurisdictions*** through a 
weekly influenza activity code.††† During the 2017–18 season, 
the peak number of jurisdictions reporting widespread activity 
in a single week was 50 (93%); this occurred for 3 consecutive 
weeks (weeks ending January 6, 13, and 20, 2018). During 
the previous 5 influenza seasons, the peak number of jurisdic-
tions reporting widespread activity in a single week during 
each season has ranged from 41 (76%) (2015–16 season) to 
48 (89%) (2012–13 season).
Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations
CDC monitors hospitalizations associated with labora-
tory-confirmed influenza infections through the Influenza 
Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET),§§§ 
 *** For this surveillance component, 54 jurisdictions participate: the 50 states, 
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands.
 ††† Levels of activity are 1) no activity; 2) sporadic: isolated laboratory-confirmed 
influenza cases or a laboratory-confirmed outbreak in one institution, with 
no increase in activity; 3) local: increased ILI, or two or more institutional 
outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in one region of the state, 
with recent laboratory evidence of influenza in that region; virus activity no 
greater than sporadic in other regions; 4) regional: increased ILI activity or 
institutional outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in two or 
more outbreaks, but less than half of the regions in the state with recent 
laboratory evidence of influenza in those regions; and 5) widespread: 
increased ILI activity or institutional outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed 
influenza) in at least half of the regions in the state, with recent laboratory 
evidence of influenza in the state.
 §§§ FluSurv-NET conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-
confirmed, influenza-associated hospitalizations in children and adolescents 
aged <18 years (since the 2003–04 influenza season) and adults aged ≥18 years 
(since the 2005–06 influenza season). FluSurv-NET covers approximately 
70 counties in the 10 Emerging Infections Program states (California, 
Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New 
York, Oregon, and Tennessee) and additional Influenza Hospitalization 
Surveillance Project (IHSP) states. IHSP began during the 2009–10 season 
to enhance surveillance during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. IHSP sites 
included Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, Oklahoma, and South Dakota during the 
2009–10 season; Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and 
Utah during the 2010–11 season; Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Utah 
during the 2011–12 season; Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Utah 
during the 2012–13 season; and Michigan, Ohio, and Utah during the 
2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16, and 2016–17 seasons. Cumulative unadjusted 
incidence rates are calculated using CDC’s National Center for Health 
Statistics population estimates for the counties included in the surveillance 
catchment area. Laboratory confirmation is dependent on clinician-ordered 
influenza testing, and testing for influenza often is underutilized because of 
the poor reliability of rapid test results and greater reliance on clinical 
diagnosis for influenza. Therefore, cases identified as part of influenza 
hospitalization surveillance likely are an underestimation of the actual 
number of persons hospitalized with influenza.
which covers approximately 27 million persons (9% of the 
U.S. population). During October 1, 2017–April 30, 2018, 
a total of 30,453 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related 
hospitalizations were reported (cumulative incidence for all 
age groups = 106.6 per 100,000 population) (Figure 2). The 
overall peak occurred during the week ending January 6, 2018 
(week 1). The hospitalization rate was highest among persons 
aged ≥65 years, who accounted for approximately 58% of 
reported influenza-associated hospitalizations. By age group, 
the cumulative hospitalization rate was 74.3 per 100,000 
population among children aged 0–4 years, 20.2 among chil-
dren and adolescents aged 5–17 years, 32.6 among adults aged 
18–49 years, 115.7 among adults aged 50–64 years, and 460.9 
among adults aged ≥65 years. Among all influenza-associated 
hospitalizations, 22,023 (72.3%) were for influenza A virus 
infections, 8,226 (27.0%) for influenza B virus infections, 116 
(0.4%) for influenza A virus and influenza B virus coinfections, 
and 88 (0.3%) for an influenza virus for which no type testing 
was done. Among 7,352 patients for whom influenza A subtype 
information was available, 6,163 (83.8%) were infected with 
influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and 1,189 (16.2%) were infected 
with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.
Complete medical chart abstraction data in FluSurv-NET 
will not be finalized until later in 2018; however, as of June 1, 
2018, data were available for 7,584 (24.9%) hospitalized adults 
and children with laboratory-confirmed influenza. Among 
6,910 hospitalized adults with information on underlying 
medical conditions, 6,385 (92.4%) had at least one reported 
underlying medical condition that placed them at high risk¶¶¶ 
for influenza-associated complications. The most commonly 
reported underlying medical conditions among adults were 
cardiovascular disease (46.3%), metabolic disorders (43.3%), 
obesity (36.5%), and chronic lung disease (29.6%). Among 
674 hospitalized children with such information, 382 (56.7%) 
had at least one underlying medical condition; the most com-
monly reported were asthma (23.4%), neurologic disorder 
(15.4%), and obesity (10.7%). Among 609 hospitalized 
 ¶¶¶ Persons at higher risk include 1) children aged <2 years; 2) adults aged 
≥65 years; 3) persons with chronic pulmonary conditions (including asthma), 
cardiovascular disease (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, 
hematologic (including sickle cell) disease, metabolic disorders (including 
diabetes mellitus), or neurologic and neurodevelopmental conditions 
(including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and muscles, 
such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual disability 
[mental retardation], moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular 
dystrophy, or spinal cord injury); 4) persons with immunosuppression, 
including that caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus 
infection; 5) women who are pregnant or postpartum (within 2 weeks after 
delivery); 6) persons aged ≤18 years who are receiving long-term aspirin 
therapy; 7) American Indians/Alaska Natives; 8) persons with extreme obesity 
(i.e., body mass index ≥40); and 9) residents of nursing homes and other 
chronic care facilities.

Pneumonia and Influenza-Associated Mortality
CDC tracks pneumonia and influenza (P&I)–attributed 
deaths through CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS) Mortality Reporting System. The percentages of deaths 
attributed to P&I are released 2 weeks after the week of death 
to allow for collection of sufficient data to produce a stable P&I 
mortality percentage. During the 2017–18 season, based on 
data from NCHS, the proportion of deaths attributed to P&I 
was at or above the epidemic threshold**** for 16 consecutive 
weeks during the weeks ending December 23, 2017–April 7, 
2018 (weeks 51–14). Nationally, mortality attributed to P&I 
exceeded 10.0% for 4 consecutive weeks, peaking at 10.8% 
during the week ending January 20, 2018 (week 3).
 **** The seasonal baseline proportion of pneumonia and influenza (P&I) deaths 
is projected using a robust regression procedure, in which a periodic 
regression model is applied to the observed percentage of deaths from P&I 
that were reported by the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality 
Surveillance System during the preceding 5 years. The epidemic threshold 
is set at 1.645 standard deviations above the seasonal baseline.
Severity Assessment
In 2017, CDC began using a new methodology to classify 
influenza season severity using three indicators: 1) the percent-
age of visits to outpatient clinics for ILI from ILINet, 2) the 
rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations from FluSurv-Net, 
and 3) the percentage of deaths resulting from pneumonia or 
influenza from NCHS (8). This approach uses data from past 
influenza season indicators to calculate three intensity thresh-
olds (ITs) (additional information is available at https://www.
cdc.gov/flu/professionals/classifies-flu-severity.htm). These ITs 
help assess the historic chance that surveillance system data 
will exceed a certain threshold. CDC then classifies the sever-
ity of the current influenza season by determining which IT 
was crossed by at least two of the peak values from the above 
indicators. Based on this method, the severity of the 2017–18 
season was classified as high severity overall and high severity 
for each age group (children and adolescents, adults, and older 
adults). This is the first time that each age group was classified 
as high in the same season, in a retrospective analysis going 
back to the 2003–04 season (Figure 3).

Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality
CDC monitors pediatric influenza-associated deaths through 
the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance 
System. As of June 1, 2018, a total of 171 laboratory-confirmed 
influenza-associated pediatric deaths during the 2017–18 sea-
son had been reported to CDC from Chicago, New York City, 
and 41 states. Of these deaths, 36 (21%) were associated with 
infection with an influenza A(H3N2) virus, 31 (18%) with an 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, 36 (21%) with an influenza 
A virus for which no subtyping was performed, 64 (37%) with 
an influenza B virus, two (1%) with an influenza A and B coin-
fection, and two (1%) with an influenza virus for which the 
type was not determined. The mean age of the pediatric deaths 
reported this season was 7.1 years (range = 8 weeks–17 years); 
97 (57%) children died after admission to the hospital. Among 
the 154 children with a known medical history, 79 (51%) 
had at least one underlying medical condition recognized by 
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
as placing them at high risk for influenza-related complica-
tions. Among the 138 children who were eligible for influenza 
vaccination (age ≥6 months at date of onset) and for whom 
vaccination status was known, 30 (22%) had received at least 
1 dose of influenza vaccine before illness onset (28 were fully 
vaccinated according to 2017 ACIP recommendations, and 
two had received 1 of 2 recommended doses). Since influenza-
associated pediatric mortality became a nationally notifiable 
condition in 2004, the total number of influenza-associated 
pediatric deaths per season has ranged from 37 during the 
2011–12 season to 171 during the 2012–13 season, excluding 
the 2009 pandemic, during which 358 pediatric deaths were 
reported to CDC during April 15, 2009–October 2, 2010.
Discussion
The 2017–18 influenza season was a high severity, 
A(H3N2)-predominant season. In 2017, CDC began using 
a new methodology to classify seasonal severity and applied 
the methodology to the 2003–04 through 2016–17 seasons. 
The 2017–18 season is the third overall high severity season 
since 2003–04 and the first classified as high severity for all 
age groups (8). The peak percentage of outpatient visits for ILI 
was the third highest recorded since 1997–98, when ILINet 
was implemented. Mortality attributed to P&I remained 
above epidemic threshold for 16 consecutive weeks, peaking 
at 10.8%, the highest percentage reported since the 2014–15 
season, when NCHS mortality data were first presented for 
routine influenza surveillance purposes. The cumulative hos-
pitalization rate for laboratory-confirmed influenza for all ages 
combined and for the three adult age groups was the highest 
documented since the system expanded to include adults

during the 2005–06 season. Although the hospitalization rates 
for children this season did not exceed the rates reported during 
the 2009 pandemic, they surpassed rates reported in previous 
high severity A(H3N2)-predominant seasons. These hospital-
ization rates are not adjusted for testing practices, which can 
vary from season to season; therefore, caution should be used 
when comparing hospitalization rates across seasons.
Influenza-associated pediatric mortality became a nationally 
notifiable condition in 2004. Excluding the 2009 pandemic, 
the previous highest number of pediatric deaths was reported 
during the 2012–13 season. The 171 pediatric deaths reported 
so far this season, approximately half in otherwise healthy 
children, equal the numbers reported during 2012–13 season. 
Although A(H3N2) was the predominant subtype circulating, 
there was substantial diversity in type and subtype of influenza 
infections leading to death in children. Less than one fourth 
(22%) of vaccine-eligible children who died from influenza 
this season had received influenza vaccine before illness onset.
Analysis of the influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and 
B/Yamagata lineage viruses showed that circulating viruses were 
antigenically similar to the cell-grown reference viruses repre-
senting the 2017–18 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine 
viruses. The majority of U.S.-produced influenza vaccines use 
egg-based manufacturing and viruses adapted for growth in 
eggs. Amino acid changes in these egg-adapted viruses might 
contribute to differences in antigenicity from circulating viruses. 
Although this can occur in all types/subtypes, it was most evident 
in circulating A(H3N2) viruses, where half showed reduced 
inhibition by antisera to the egg-adapted vaccine reference virus. 
Whereas the overall number of circulating B/Victoria viruses was 
low, a substantial amount of antigenic drift from the vaccine 
reference virus B/Brisbane/60/2008 was observed.
Interim estimates of the effectiveness of the 2017–18 inacti-
vated influenza vaccines against medically attended respiratory 
illness published in February 2018 were 36% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 27%–44%) overall, 25% (CI = 13%–36%) 
against illness caused by influenza A(H3N2) viruses, 67% 
(CI = 54%–76%) against illness caused by influenza A(H1N1)
pdm09, and 42% (CI = 25%–56%) against illness caused by 
influenza B viruses (9). Even during seasons when vaccine 
effectiveness is reduced, vaccination can offer substantial 
benefit and reduce the likelihood of severe outcomes, includ-
ing hospitalization and death. This season’s estimates will be 
published later this year; however, during the 2016–17 season, 
vaccination averted an estimated 5.29 million illnesses,††††

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity 
and viruses in the United States.
What is added by this report?
The 2017–18 influenza season was a high severity, A(H3N2)-
predominant season. Influenza activity indicators were notable 
for the volume and intensity of influenza cases that occurred in 
most of the country at the same time. Record hospitalization 
rates and high numbers of influenza-associated pediatric deaths 
also were reported.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Receiving a seasonal flu vaccine each year remains the best way 
to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe 
consequences. Testing for seasonal influenza viruses and 
monitoring for novel influenza A virus infections should 
continue year-round.
2.64 million medical visits, and 84,700 influenza-associated 
hospitalizations.
The timing of the peaks for certain influenza surveillance 
indicators this season was unusual. Influenza activity in chil-
dren typically precedes that in adults, and peak ILI and labora-
tory positivity percentages precede the peak in hospitalizations, 
followed by the mortality peak. In this season, influenza-
associated hospitalizations and mortality peaked earlier than 
the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in 
clinical laboratories and the percentage of outpatient visits 
for ILI. Influenza activity peaked among older adults earlier 
than among children and young adults; this also occurred, to 
a lesser extent, during the 2016–17 season (5). 
Previous influenza A(H3N2)-predominant seasons have 
also been associated with increased hospitalizations and 
deaths; however, the 2017–18 season followed an A(H3N2)-
predominant season, and all severity indicators were higher 
than during the 2016–17 season. The majority of A(H3N2) 
viruses were genetically characterized as 3C.2a clade, similar, 
but genetically distinct from the 3C.2a1 subclade that pre-
dominated during the 2016–17 season, and from the viruses 
that circulated during Australia’s 2017 influenza season (7,10). 
Outside the United States and Canada, A(H3N2) viruses did 
not predominate in other Northern hemisphere temperate 
countries. Further studies are needed to understand the viro-
logic, host, or environmental factors responsible for this high 
severity season.
The severity of this influenza season highlights the impor-
tance of public health measures to control and prevent influ-
enza. Annual influenza vaccination remains the most effective 
way to prevent influenza illness. Although influenza activity in 
the United States is typically low during the summer, influenza 
cases and outbreaks can occur, and clinicians should consider 
influenza in the differential diagnosis of respiratory illnesses at 
any time of year. CDC recommends prompt treatment with 
influenza antiviral medications for persons with confirmed 
or suspected influenza who are severely ill or at high risk for 
serious influenza complications. Health care providers should 
consider novel influenza virus infections in persons with ILI 
and swine or poultry exposure, or with severe acute respiratory 
infection after travel to areas where avian influenza viruses have 
been detected. Providers should alert the local public health 
department if novel influenza virus infection is suspected. 
Clinical laboratories using a commercially available influenza 
diagnostic assay that includes influenza A virus subtype deter-
mination should contact their state public health laboratory 
to facilitate transport and additional testing of any unsubtype-
able influenza A–positive specimen. Public health laboratories 
should immediately send unsubtypeable influenza A viruses to 
CDC, because early identification and investigation are criti-
cal to ensuring timely risk assessment and implementation of 
appropriate public health measures.
Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted 
online weekly (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly). Additional 
information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, 
influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel 
influenza A infections in humans is available online (https://
www.cdc.gov/flu).
