SUMMARY
Mycobacterium leprae causes leprosy and is unique
among mycobacterial diseases in producing periph-
eral neuropathy. This debilitating morbidity is attrib-
uted to axon demyelination resulting from direct inter-
action of the M. leprae-specific phenolic glycolipid 1
(PGL-1) with myelinating glia and their subsequent
infection. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae
to visualize the earliest events of M. leprae-induced
nerve damage. We find that demyelination and axonal
damage are not directly initiated by M. leprae but
by infected macrophages that patrol axons; demye-
lination occurs in areas of intimate contact. PGL-1
confers this neurotoxic response on macrophages:
macrophages infected with M. marinum-expressing
PGL-1 also damage axons. PGL-1 induces nitric
oxide synthase in infected macrophages, and the
resultant
increase
in
reactive
nitrogen
species
damages axons by injuring their mitochondria and
inducing demyelination. Our findings implicate the
response of innate macrophages to M. leprae PGL-1
in initiating nerve damage in leprosy.
INTRODUCTION
Leprosy, like tuberculosis, presents as a granulomatous disease.
These granulomas are usually cutaneous, reflecting the �30�C
growth optimum of M. leprae, similar to that of the human skin
(�34�C) (Bierman, 1936; Renault and Ernst, 2015; Truman and
Krahenbuhl, 2001). M. leprae is the only mycobacterial infection
that causes widespread demyelinating neuropathy, which re-
sults in the main morbidities of leprosy, including autoamputa-
tion of digits and blindness (Renault and Ernst, 2015). Under-
standing the pathogenesis of leprosy neuropathy has been
stymied by the inability to culture M. leprae, which has under-
gone severe reductive evolution of its genome to become an
obligate intracellular pathogen (Cole et al., 2001; Scollard
et al., 2006). The lack of genetic tools for studying M. leprae is
compounded by the lack of genetically tractable animal models
that mimic the human disease. The athymic mouse footpad is
used to grow M. leprae for research purposes, but mice do not
manifest neurological disease (Scollard et al., 2006). While the
nine-banded armadillo develops neuropathy following infection
with M. leprae, it suffers from a paucity of molecular and genetic
tools (Truman et al., 2014). Consequently, our understanding of
the pathogenesis of leprosy neuropathy in vivo largely comes
from studies of patients; however, the 4- to 10-year delay in
the onset of symptoms largely precludes studies of the early
events that lead to neuropathy (Noordeen, 1994).
Leprosy can present as a clinical spectrum; at the poles of this
spectrum are paucibacillary (or tuberculoid) and multibacillary (or
lepromatous) disease. The former is characterized by a vigorous
immune response, while the latter, an ineffective one (Scollard
et al., 2006). Neuropathy features prominently in both forms of
the disease. Hence, bacterial determinants and host immune re-
sponses likely play roles in leprosy neuropathy, although the rela-
tive importance and mechanisms by which each contributes to

 nerve injury are poorly understood. In vitro studies suggest
a model wherein M. leprae directly causes demyelination by in-
fecting and dedifferentiating the Schwann cells that myelinate pe-
ripheral nerves (Rambukkana et al., 2002; Truman et al., 2014).
These studies identified an M. leprae outer membrane lipid,
phenolic glycolipid 1 (PGL-1), that is critical for binding to laminin
a2, an interaction thought to promote infection of the Schwann
cells (Ng et al., 2000). However, this model fails to explain the neu-
ropathy in paucibacillary leprosy, in which bacteria are seldom
observed within nerve lesions (Shetty and Antia, 1996). Rather,
a pathogenic CD4 T cell response, possibly acting through
secreted cytokines, is implicated in paucibacillary disease (Re-
nault and Ernst, 2015). Further, the specific contributions of mac-
rophages in leprosy neuropathy are unknown, although they are
commonly infected and almost universally present in affected
nerves (Job, 1973; Shetty and Antia, 1996).
The developing zebrafish is an effective model for studying
mycobacterial pathogenesis using M. marinum, a close genetic
relative of the M. tuberculosis complex and the agent of fish tuber-
culosis(Ramakrishnan,2004).Thegenetictractabilityofthezebra-
fish, coupled with the optical transparency of its larva, allows host-
bacterium interactions to be monitored in real-time, providing
critical insights into disease pathogenesis (Ramakrishnan, 2004).
Furthermore, adaptive immunity is not yet present at the larval
developmental stage, permitting study of host-pathogen interac-
tions in the sole context of innate immunity (Davis et al., 2002).
Here, we exploit the optical transparency of larval zebrafish to
directly visualize the earliest interactions of M. leprae with macro-
phages (Davis et al., 2002), and the initial events in nerve injury
(Czopka, 2016). We use M. marinum as a comparator for these
studies because, like M. leprae, it grows at �30�C and produces
cutaneous granulomatous infections in humans (Ramakrishnan,
2004). However, it does not cause neuropathy. Our studies reveal
that M. leprae interacts with macrophages and incites granulomas
similar to M. marinum (Madigan et al., 2017), but is unique in its
ability to produce demyelination and axonal damage. We show
that the innate macrophage response to PGL-1 triggers demyelin-
ation in vivo, even before bacilli have detectably infected the glia.
Finally, we determine the mechanism of nerve damage using
M. leprae and M. marinum engineered to synthesize PGL-1.
RESULTS
M. leprae Elicits Typical Responses in Macrophages
of Zebrafish Larvae
To determine if zebrafish larvae might be a useful model for
studying early M. leprae infection, we first examined the earliest
interactions of M. leprae with phagocytes, by injecting bacteria
into the caudal vein or the hindbrain ventricle (Figure 1A), where
phagocytes are rarely observed in the absence of infection (Da-
vis et al., 2002). Aggregates of infected macrophages formed
within 4 days (Figure 1B), similar to the case with M. marinum
infection (Davis et al., 2002). Prior studies indicate that phago-
cyte recruitment to M. marinum infection is unique in two re-
spects: (1) neutrophils are not recruited to the initial site of infec-
tion (Yang et al., 2012), and (2) macrophage recruitment is
independent of TLR-signaling, but dependent on the monocyte
chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 (Cambier et al., 2014).
M. leprae shared both of these features with M. marinum: neutro-
phils were not recruited, whereas macrophages were (Figures
1C and 1D). Further, this recruitment was TLR/MyD88 indepen-
dent and CCL2/CCR2 dependent (Figure 1D) (Cambier et al.,
2014). The M. marinum phenolic glycolipid (PGL-mar) induces
CCL2 expression and mediates CCL2/CCR2-dependent macro-
phage recruitment (Cambier et al., 2014, 2017), suggesting that
PGL-1 may play a similar role in M. leprae infection.
Macrophages
play
a
dichotomous
role
in
controlling
M. marinum infection: they restrict bacterial numbers, while pro-
moting dissemination of bacteria from the infection site into
deeper tissues (Clay et al., 2007). Similar to the case observed
for M. marinum, M. leprae-infected animals depleted of macro-
phages using the pu.1 morpholino (Clay et al., 2007) displayed
higher bacterial burdens (Figures 1E and 1F). The increased bac-
terial burden in the pu.1 morphants is likely due to the lack of bac-
terial killing, rather than bacterial replication. The doubling time of
M. leprae is approximately 12 days (Levy and Ji, 2006); therefore,
most bacteria would not have replicated in the larvae during the
2-day infection. In addition, we assessed the role of macrophages
in M. leprae dissemination, by infecting animals with fluorescent
vascular endothelial cells (kdrl:dsRed). By 2 days post-infection
(dpi) (4 dpf), M. leprae escaped the vasculature and entered pe-
ripheral tissues in the majority of wild-type, but not macro-
phage-depleted, larvae (Figures 1G and 1H). Furthermore, in
wild-type animals, M. leprae resided in macrophages (apparent
by Nomarski imaging in Figure S1), suggesting these cells carried
M. leprae from the circulation into tissues. This is reminiscent of
zebrafish infected with M. marinum, in which infected macro-
phages disseminate bacteria from the initial infection site into
the body (Clay et al., 2007). In sum, M. leprae displays interactions
with macrophages, from initial recruitment through granuloma
formation, that resemble those seen for M. marinum. The pres-
ence of M. leprae-infected macrophages in the circulation of
larvae mirrors findings in human leprosy (Drutz et al., 1972).
M. leprae Infection Alters Myelin Structure
We next investigated the interactions of M. leprae with cells of
the zebrafish nervous system, to determine if infection produced
demyelination. Transgenic mbp (myelin basic protein) larvae ex-
press membrane-localized GFP that labels the myelinating
membrane of glia in both the peripheral nervous system
(Schwann cells) and central nervous system (oligodendrocytes)
(Jung et al., 2010). Oligodendrocytes express all Schwann
cell determinants that have been reported to interact with
M. leprae (Table S1), and myelin structure is similar in the central
and peripheral nervous systems (Morell and Quarles, 1999).
Therefore, we studied M. leprae interactions with nerves in the
spinal cord rather than peripheral nerves because of their easier
accessibility. We injected fluorescent M. leprae into the dorsal
spinal cord of larvae at 2–4 days post-fertilization (dpf), and
imaged nerves at 4–8 dpf, a developmental stage at which these
tracts have become myelinated (Czopka, 2016) (Figures 2A and
2B). At 2 dpi (4 dpf), we observed cellular protrusions from an
otherwise intact myelin sheath, clustered around M. leprae in
the nerve (Figure 2C). M. marinum injected into the dorsal spinal
cord did not alter the myelinating membrane structure, even
though the M. marinum burdens at the injection sites were higher
974
Cell 170, 973–985, August 24, 2017
 than those in M. leprae infections (Figures 2C–2E). The M. leprae-
induced myelin protrusions increased in size and number with
time but always remained next to the bacteria (Figure 2F).
Three-dimensional rendering showed that protrusions were
doughnut shaped, not spherical, suggesting that these struc-
tures were not cell bodies but rather protrusions of myelinating
membrane (Figure 2G; Movie S1).
Expression of PGL-1 in M. marinum Confers Capacity
to Alter Myelin Structure
In vitro studies suggest that M. leprae interacts with glial determi-
nants through a surface-localized long chain lipid, known
as PGL-1 (m/z 2,043.75), which carries a unique trisaccharide
(Ng et al., 2000; Renault and Ernst, 2015) (Figure S2A). The
phenolic glycolipid of M. marinum contains a monosaccharide
and shorter lipid chains that renders it detectable at a lower
mass value (m/z 1,567.44) (Figures 3A and S2B). We wondered
if the trisaccharide that is normally found on M. leprae PGL-1
would be sufficient to render M. marinum capable of altering
myelin. We transformed M. marinum with the six M. leprae genes
responsible for assembly of PGL-1’s terminal disaccharide (Tab-
ouret et al., 2010). Ion chromatograms (Figures 3A and 3B) and
collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry (Figure S2)
of total lipid from the transformant, M. marinum:PGL-1, proved
that it produced triglycosylated PGL-1. PGL-1 expression
conferred on M. marinum the ability to cause myelin protrusions,
indistinguishable from those of M. leprae in both morphology and
their invariable co-localization with the bacteria (Figures 3C–3E).
The protrusions, like those produced by M. leprae, did not
colocalize with a histone marker that labels cell nuclei. This

 suggested they did not simply represent an accumulation of
oligodendrocyte cell bodies, but rather were composed of mye-
linating membrane (Figure 3F). Using time-lapse imaging to
observe the formation of protrusions in real time, we observed
that an intact myelin sheath near the M. marinum:PGL-1 injec-
tion site began to condense and then bulge (Figure 3G). Protru-
sions formed by 10 hr post-infection and expanded over time
(Figure 3G). To further test if myelin protrusions represent
recruitment or proliferation of oligodendrocyte cell bodies, we
generated larvae with a single GFP-labeled oligodendrocyte.
Time-lapse movies of these larvae showed that individual oligo-
dendrocytes form myelin protrusions by retracting portions of
myelinating membrane from previously intact sheaths (Movie
S2A). This occurred after injection with M. marinum:PGL-1,
but not with PBS (compare Movies S2A and S2B). These find-
ings strongly suggested that the protrusions arise from previ-
ously intact myelin sheaths, consistent with early demyelin-
ation. Similar to human leprosy (de Freitas and Said, 2013),
myelin dissociation occurred in discrete areas, with the sur-
rounding myelin sheaths remaining intact (Figures S3A–S3D).
Transmission Electron Microscopy Shows PGL-1-
Mediated Demyelination and Axonal Damage
Demyelination can be imaged in detail by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). We compared TEM images of transverse
sections through areas of myelin protrusions at 2 days after
infection to identical sections through the injection site of PBS-
injected fish (Figures 4A–4C). TEMs from animals injected with
M. leprae or M. marinum:PGL-1 revealed a selective decrease
in myelinated axons, while the total number of axons was pre-
served (Figures 4D, 4E, S3E, and S3F). Higher-magnification
images revealed apparently intact axons surrounded by disorga-
nized myelin, with large spaces in between the individual
lamellae (Figure S3G); this myelin decompaction is characteristic
of early demyelination in human leprosy (Figure 4F) (Job, 1973;
Shetty et al., 1988). The condensed, fragmented myelin, which
was no longer associated with axons, was observed scattered
throughout the extracellular space (Figures 4A–4C and S3G).
In vitro studies have focused on M. leprae-induced demyelin-
ation as a mechanism of nerve injury (Rambukkana et al., 2002;
Scollard, 2008). However, the peripheral neuropathy of human
leprosy involves both myelinated and nonmyelinated axons (Me-
deiros et al., 2016; Shetty and Antia, 1996; Shetty et al., 1988). To
test if nonmyelinated axons were also affected in zebrafish, we
selected an area of the spinal cord containing only one myelin-
ated axon surrounded by many nonmyelinated axons. We
observed swelling of nonmyelinated axons, as evidenced by
their increased area compared to PBS-injected control (Figures
4G and 4H). Thus, M. leprae and M. marinum:PGL-1 rapidly
induce damage to both myelinated and nonmyelinated axons
in the zebrafish, similar to the pathological changes found in
human leprosy.

 M. leprae-Induced Nerve Damage Is Mediated by
Macrophages
Contrary to the previous model (Rambukkana, 2000), our find-
ings in vivo did not support contact or infection of glia by
M. leprae early in infection. We did not observe mycobacteria
within myelin protrusions by confocal microscopy (Figure 2F),
nor did we observe bacteria in direct contact with myelin or in-
fected glia by TEM. All observed bacteria were within phago-
somes of macrophages abutting the axons (Figures 5A and
5B). Given the presence of macrophages in the demyelinating le-
sions, we wondered if infected macrophages, rather than bacte-
ria directly, initiated demyelination and nerve damage. Three
findings in human leprosy support this idea: (1) macrophages,
including those harboring M. leprae, are abundant in affected
nerves even early in disease (Job, 1973; Pandya and Antia,
1974; Shetty and Antia, 1996; Shetty et al., 1988). (2) Early stages
of demyelination feature vacuolar myelin structures, in which the
lamellae have split and separated (Job, 1973), associated with
infected macrophages beneath the basement membrane of
Schwann cells. (3) The unique trisaccharide of M. leprae PGL-1
confers both demyelinating (Ng et al., 2000; Renault and Ernst,
2015) and macrophage-modulating effects in vitro (Manca
et al., 2012; Tabouret et al., 2010). The plausibility of a macro-
phage-induced mechanism is further supported by findings
that macrophages mediate demyelination and nerve damage in
multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome (Bogie et al.,
2014; Martini et al., 2008; Martini and Willison, 2016; Niki�
c
et al., 2011).
Macrophages are associated with nerves under homeostatic
conditions in humans and rodents, both in the peripheral and
central nervous systems (Kierdorf et al., 2013; Klein and Martini,
2016; Mu
¨ ller et al., 2010). In the case of nerve injury, their
numbers increase (Klein and Martini, 2016), presumably because
they play roles in scavenging debris and repair. In the zebrafish
too, we observed macrophages arriving from the blood and
patrolling axons in uninjected larvae, and their numbers
increased in response to the trauma of PBS injection (Movies
S3, S4, and S5).
We asked if infection with PGL-1-expressing bacteria made
these macrophages capable of demyelinating axons. We

 used blue or far-red fluorescent bacteria to infect transgenic
larvae with green fluorescent myelinating membrane and red
fluorescent macrophages. Immediately after infection, macro-
phages were recruited to the injection site, entered the
spinal cord, and phagocytosed the majority of the bacteria;
this was equally the case for M. leprae, M. marinum and
M. marinum:PGL-1 (Movies S6, S7, and S8). Moreover, in the
context of each infection, macrophages, whether or not in-
fected, patrolled the axons, assuming a flattened, elongated
shape as they moved between them (Figure 5C; Movies S6,
S7, and S8). We noted that some infected macrophages moved
more slowly and eventually became sessile within the first 12
hours, resulting in prolonged intimate contact with the myelin
in discrete areas. This slowing down of infected macrophages
has been noted in M. marinum granulomas (Davis and Ramak-
rishnan, 2009). Here, too, we observed more slowly moving
infected macrophages in the context of all three infections,
suggesting it was an infection-dependent, but not PGL-1-
dependent, phenomenon (Movies S6, S7, and S8). This was
confirmed by a quantitative comparison
of macrophage
behavior during the first 12 hours following M. marinum versus
M. marinum:PGL-1 infection: there were no differences in
macrophage speed, shape, or tendency to associate with
myelin
(Figures
5D–5F). Macrophage
co-localization
with
myelin continued to be similar between the two bacterial groups
at 2 days post-infection, when demyelination begins (Figures
5G and 5H). Yet, only colocalization of M. marinum:PGL-1-in-
fected macrophages with myelin produced myelin protrusions
(Figure 5I). All demyelinating lesions were associated with
macrophages in 10 of 11 animals scored (Figure S4; p = 0.01,
two-tailed binomial test with an expected 0.5 frequency). In
the 11th animal, 2 of the 3 demyelinating lesions were associ-
ated with macrophages, while the third had defined clusters
of bacteria with residual fluorescent macrophage membrane,
suggesting that the co-localized, infected macrophage had
died (Figures S4B and S4C). Finally, to directly test if macro-
phages were required for M. leprae-induced demyelination,
we created macrophage-depleted fish by administering an irf8
morpholino followed by clodronate liposomes (Paga
´ n et al.,
2015). Macrophage depletion reduced myelin protrusions by
85% in M. leprae-infected larvae, confirming the essential role
of macrophages in early demyelination (Figure 5J).

 A Theoretical Framework for the Mechanism of PGL-1-
and Macrophage-Dependent Demyelination
The demyelination in leprosy is analogous to that of Gullain-
Barre
´ syndrome and multiple sclerosis, in which macrophage
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitro-
gen species (RNS) can trigger swelling and destruction of mito-
chondria and axons, contributing to demyelination (Bogie
et al., 2014; Kiefer et al., 2001). As with leprosy, multiple sclerosis

 affects both myelinated and nonmyelinated axons. Similarly, the
macrophages present in leprosy nerve biopsies express induc-
ible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and contain nitrotyrosine, a sta-
ble end product of nitric oxide production (Lockwood et al.,
2011; Scho
¨ n et al., 2004). Moreover, recent work shows that
mitochondria are swollen and damaged in both myelinated and
nonmyelinated axons (Medeiros et al., 2016). Together, these
findings suggest a model in which PGL-1 induces iNOS expres-
sion in infected macrophages, resulting in damage to mitochon-
dria of adjacent axons. This model generates three testable pre-
dictions: (1) PGL-1-expressing bacteria induce production of
iNOS and nitric oxide in the macrophages they infect; (2) PGL-
1-induced nerve damage is nitric oxide dependent; and (3) nerve
damage is linked to mitochondrial damage, which is also PGL-1
dependent.
Nitric Oxide Production by Macrophages in Response to
PGL-1 Mediates Demyelination
To test the first prediction of our model, we asked if PGL-1
induces Nos2 (the gene that encodes iNOS) in cultured murine
bone marrow-derived macrophages. M. marinum:PGL-1 in-
duced 2.8-fold more Nos2 in macrophages than wild-type
M. marinum, showing a substantial contribution from PGL-1 (Fig-
ure S5A). In the zebrafish too, M. leprae- or M. marinum:PGL-1-
infected macrophages were iNOS and/or nitrotyrosine positive,
both in the periphery and in the nervous system (Figures 6A
and S5B–S5D). Again, M. marinum:PGL-1 infection was associ-
ated with more iNOS- and nitrotyrosine-positive macrophages
than wild-type M. marinum (Figures 6B and 6C). Thus, PGL-1-ex-
pressing mycobacteria induce macrophages to produce nitric
oxide through transcriptional induction of iNOS.
To test the second prediction of our model, we asked if nitric
oxide induces early demyelination by treating infected fish with
the iNOS inhibitor L-NAME or the nitric oxide scavenger cPTIO.
Both treatments inhibited demyelination, in larvae infected with
M. leprae or M. marinum:PGL-1 (Figures 6D and 6E). Two
RNS, nitric oxide and peroxynitrite, have been implicated in
damage to axons and myelin (Smith et al., 1999). Formation of
peroxynitrite requires superoxide anion, a ROS. To differentiate
between damage caused by nitric oxide and by peroxynitrite,
we treated M. marinum:PGL-1-infected larvae with NAC, a scav-
enger of ROS. Demyelination was not significantly reduced in
NAC-treated animals, implicating nitric oxide, rather than perox-
ynitrite, as the primary contributor to demyelination. Further, the

 nitric oxide donors SNAP and spermine NONOate induced
demyelination in larvae infected with wild-type M. marinum (Fig-
ure 6G). Notably, nitric oxide donors failed to cause demyelin-
ation in the absence of M. marinum infection (Figure 6G). The
most likely explanation for this is that the amount of nitric oxide
released by the donors is insufficient to produce demyelination.
M. marinum induces iNOS and nitric oxide in macrophages, but
this is insufficient for demyelination. The nitric oxide produced by
the donors and M. marinum together may cross the threshold
required to produce demyelination. Alternatively, nitric oxide
may act in concert with one or more additional macrophage de-
terminants that are induced by any virulent mycobacterium.
PGL-1-Induced Axonal Damage Is Associated with
Mitochondrial Swelling and Loss
The third prediction of our model is that mitochondrial damage is
linked to nerve damage, and is dependent on PGL-1 production
by bacteria. Confocal microscopy of mbp larvae expressing a
fluorescent protein in axonal mitochondria (neuronal tubulin pro-
moter driving expression of dsRed protein with a mitochondrial
signal sequence; see the STAR Methods) revealed both mito-
chondrial swelling and selective loss in regions close to demye-
linating lesions (Figure 7A). TEMs through demyelinating lesions
of M. leprae and M. marinum:PGL-1-infected larvae had fewer
axonal mitochondria compared to PBS-injected larvae (Figures
7B and 7C). The remaining mitochondria were enlarged in in-
fected larvae compared to PBS-injected controls, similar to the
mitochondrial swelling reported for leprosy and multiple scle-
rosis (Medeiros et al., 2016; Niki�
c et al., 2011) (Figures 7D and
7E). If mitochondrial damage is linked to axonal damage, then
it should be most prevalent in swollen axons. Two analyses
showed that this was the case: first, the increase in mitochondrial
area in infection over PBS control occurred in axons with an area
R0.5 mm2, but not in those with an area <0.5 mm2 (Figures 7F and
7G). Second, within each of the three cohorts, mitochondrial
area was increased only in the large axons (R0.5 mm2)
of M. leprae and M. marinum:PGL-1-infected larvae, not in
PBS-injected larvae (Figure 7H). As expected, there was no
difference in mitochondrial area in the axons of PBS-treated
animals, where the differences in axon size reflect normal phys-
iological variation, rather than pathology. Collectively, these find-
ings support the model that reactive nitrogen species produced
by infected macrophages damage axonal mitochondria and
cause demyelination.
DISCUSSION
Our work suggests a mechanism for the earliest nerve injury
associated with leprosy: over-exuberant production of nitric
oxide by macrophages, in response to the M. leprae-specific
PGL-1, damages axonal mitochondria and initiates demyelin-
ation. Phenolic glycolipids likely evolved to increase infectivity
by recruiting macrophage subsets that are particularly permis-
sive to mycobacterial infection (Cambier et al., 2014). In an
accompanying study, we show that PGL induces tissue-resident
macrophages that first phagocytose infecting bacteria to ex-
press CCL2, which recruits permissive macrophages to the
site of infection enabling mycobacteria to transfer from the
microbicidal first-responding tissue macrophages into the re-
cruited growth-permissive monocytes (Cambier et al., 2017). In
this paper, we find that the specialized, triglycosylated form of
M. leprae PGL-1 retains this basal role, while acquiring additional
macrophage-modulating functions that produce demyelination.
PGL-1 has been found to alter inflammatory mediator expression
in cultured macrophages (Manca et al., 2012; Tabouret et al.,
2010), and our work now assigns a central role for this immuno-
modulation in early leprosy neuropathy.
In terms of the relevance of our findings to human leprosy,
macrophages, often infected, are a consistent presence within
early nerve lesions of leprosy patients (Job, 1973; Pandya and
Antia, 1974; Shetty and Antia, 1996; Shetty et al., 1988).
Furthermore, iNOS upregulation has been reported in both
‘‘pro-inflammatory’’
paucibacillary
and
‘‘anti-inflammatory’’
multibacillary leprosy lesions (Lockwood et al., 2011; Teles
et al., 2013), both of which are associated with nerve damage.
As to how infected macrophages might reach nerves, one way
is by direct seeding from a skin granuloma into an underlying
nerve trunk. In support of this possibility, a leprosy cohort
study found that the most significant risk factor for develop-
ment of neuropathy in a peripheral nerve was the presence
of an overlying skin lesion (van Brakel et al., 2005). A second
possibility
is
through
hematogenous
dissemination.
This
work and others suggest that circulating macrophages patrol
axons under homeostatic conditions, reaching axons by
extravasating from local blood vessels (Klein and Martini,
2016). Bacteremia is common in leprosy patients, with circu-
lating
bacteria
found in
mononuclear phagocytes (Drutz
et al., 1972; Lane et al., 2006) and in blood vessels of appar-
ently normal skin (Ganapati and Chulawala, 1976). We suggest
that infected macrophages have a similar propensity to reach
nerves and patrol them to their uninfected counterparts. Some
may slow down and stall as Mycobacterium-infected macro-
phages are wont to do (Davis and Ramakrishnan, 2009). The
resultant prolonged intimate contact with the nerve may
initiate damage through the mechanism we have uncovered.
This
hematogenous
dissemination
model
predicts
that
M. leprae-infected macrophages are widely distributed in
nerves. Indeed, biopsies of the apparently normal skin of
leprosy
patients
find
subclinical,
diffuse
neuropathy
in
conjunction with infected macrophages (Ganapati et al.,
1972; Pandya and Antia, 1974). Finally, household contacts
of leprosy patients are significantly more likely to have
M. leprae DNA in their peripheral blood than non-contacts,
and longitudinal follow-up shows that these individuals are
more likely to develop leprosy (Wen et al., 2013), suggesting
that hematogenous dissemination of M. leprae is a very early
and significant step in the pathogenesis of peripheral nerve
damage.
Our finding that both myelinated and nonmyelinated axons
are damaged by this mechanism further suggests its relevance
to human leprosy neuropathy, which affects both types of
axons (Medeiros et al., 2016; Shetty et al., 1988). Moreover,
nonmyelinated cutaneous nerve endings are often affected
early in infection, even before neurological symptoms appear
(de Freitas and Said, 2013; Ganapati et al., 1972; Pandya and
Antia, 1974). The idea that demyelination is a pathological
Cell 170, 973–985, August 24, 2017
981
 manifestation, rather than a cause of nerve injury, has gained
traction in the context of other demyelinating diseases, such
as multiple sclerosis (Niki�
c et al., 2011).
The older model, which explains the neurotropism of M. leprae
by evoking direct binding of PGL-1 to Schwann cell laminin a2
(Ng et al., 2000), is problematic in at least four ways. First, myco-
bacterial species that lack PGL-1 and fail to cause neuropathy
are, nevertheless, able to bind laminin a2 (Marques et al.,
2001). Second, the model does not explain how M. leprae, a
nonmotile bacterium, reaches Schwann cells. Third, by requiring
high bacterial burdens within Schwann cells to cause demyelin-
ation, the model fails to explain the clinical findings of nerve

 damage very early in infection, when only a few bacteria are pre-
sent in nerve lesions. Fourth, the earliest nerve impairment in
leprosy is in thermal sensation, which is mediated by nonmyelin-
ated fibers (de Freitas and Said, 2013; van Brakel et al., 2003).
Our findings resolve these inconsistencies by showing that it
is the PGL-1-stimulated macrophages that initiate damage
to nerves regardless of their myelination. This early innate
immune-mediated nerve injury may then progress by distinct
mechanisms in multibacillary and paucibacillary leprosy. In the
face of an inadequate adaptive immune response in multibacil-
lary leprosy, the inability of macrophages to control bacterial
growth may result in their death, releasing bacteria into the extra-
cellular milieu of the nerve. These released bacteria could then
be taken up by Schwann cells. In paucibacillary leprosy, the
onset of an adaptive immune response may enable infected
macrophages to control intracellular M. leprae, while further
enabling, or even enhancing, their neuropathological response
(Scollard, 2008). This may be through the induction of pro-in-
flammatory cytokines such as interferon-g (Teles et al., 2013),
which may act by further stimulating reactive nitrogen species,
or by engaging distinct mechanisms.
Production of nitric oxide by macrophages and other myeloid
cells has been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction and sub-
sequent axonal injury in multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barre
´
syndrome (Bogie et al., 2014; Kiefer et al., 2001). Our work
may offer insights into these and other neurodegenerative dis-
eases in which myeloid cells are increasingly recognized as
contributing to neuropathology (Thompson and Tsirka, 2017),
as well as provide an experimental system in which to
explore them.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Zebrafish husbandry and experiments were conducted in compliance with guidelines from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and
approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, the Office of Animal Research Oversight of
the University of California Los Angeles, and the Institutional Biosafety Committee of the University of California Los Angeles. WT AB
strain zebrafish or transgenics in the AB background were used, including Tg(kdrl:dsRed)s843 (Jin et al., 2005), Tg(mbp:CAAX-
GFP)ue2Tg (Almeida et al., 2011), Tg(mpeg1:Brainbow)w201 (Paga
´ n et al., 2015), Tg(lysC:EGFP)nz117 (Hall et al., 2007) and Tg(mpe-
g1:YFP)w200 (Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013). Larvae were anesthetized with 0.02% buffered tricaine, (MS-222, Sigma) as described
(Takaki et al., 2013), prior to imaging or infection. Larvae of indeterminate sex were infected by injection into the caudal vein or hind-
brain ventricle at 2 dpf using a capillary needle containing bacteria diluted in PBS + 2% phenol red (Sigma), as previously described
(Takaki et al., 2013), or infected in the ventral spinal cord adjacent to the cloaca at 2-4 dpf. Titered, single-cell suspensions were pre-
pared for all M. marinum strains prior to infection by passing cell pellets from mid-log phase cultures (OD600 = 0.5 ± 0.1) repeatedly
through a syringe to remove clumps, as described (Takaki et al., 2013). When two different bacterial strains were compared, several
groups of larvae (n = 20 or more) were infected with different dilutions of each strain; on the day of the comparison, equivalently-in-
fected groups of larvae (as determined by FPC) were used to assure the comparison was not biased by in vivo growth differences
between the two strains. After infection, larvae were housed at 28.5�C, in fish water containing 0.003% PTU (1-phenyl-2-thiourea,
Sigma) to prevented pigmentation.
METHOD DETAILS
Drugs were administered by adding them to the fish water; fresh drug (or DMSO vehicle for control fish) was added every 12 hr. To
assess drug treatment in infected fish, equivalently-infected sibling larvae were mixed in a petri dish and held at 28.5�C for 4-6 hr after
injection to allow macrophage recruitment to the injection site; larvae were then randomly allocated to the drug-treated or control
group (0.5% DMSO). All drugs were dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide, Sigma), such that the final concentration in fish water
was 0.5% DMSO. L-NAME (1000 mM), cPTIO (500 mM) or NAC (40 mM) were used to inhibit iNOS and scavenge reactive oxygen/ni-
trogen species, as described (Cambier et al., 2014; Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013). SNAP (100 mM) and spermine NONOate (10 mM)
were used to exogenously add nitric oxide, as described (Kong et al., 2016; Siamwala et al., 2012).
To detect iNOS or nitrotyrosine in infected larvae, equivalently-infected larvae were euthanized by tricaine overdose, fixed over-
night at 4�C in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) + 4% sucrose (Fisher), permeabilized for 30 min in PBST (PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100
(Sigma)), then stained overnight at 4�C in iNOS or nitrotyrosine antibodies (see Key Resources Table) diluted 1:200, as described
(Cambier et al., 2014; Elks et al., 2014). After washing in PBST, secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluors (Molecular Probes)
were added at 1:500 and incubated overnight at 4�C.

 Bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were generated from C57BL/6 mice purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Bone
marrow cells extracted from femora and tibiae of male mice at 6-10 weeks of age were cultured in BMDM media consisting of DMEM
(GIBCO) with 20% FBS (Omega), conditioned media containing �100 ng/mL M-CSF from L929 cells (kind gift from G. Cheng), and 1X
Pen/Strep (GIBCO) for 6 days at 37�C under 4% CO2. Cells were washed twice with PBS and medium replaced with antibiotic-free
BMDM medium before cells were place in an incubator at 35�C and 4% CO2 for at least an hour before infection or stimulation. Cells
were infected with M. leprae (harvested from footpads of nude mice) at indicated MOI or with equivalent volumes of log-phase
(OD600 = 0.5 ± 0.1) WT M. marinum or M. marinum:PGL-1 cultures (growth conditions described below). An equivalent volume of
PBS vehicle was added to cell medium for control cells. Approximate MOI for M. marinum was calculated from the optical density
of the culture, then exact MOI was obtained by growing the cultures on 7H10 plates. MOI for M. leprae was calculated based on
counting bacilli. For PGL-1 stimulation of cells, PGL-1 purified from the livers of M. leprae-infected armadillos (BEI, see Key Re-
sources Table) was resuspended in PBS + 1% DMSO by sonication, then added to cells at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. For control
cells, an equivalent volume of PBS + 1% DMSO was added.
Cells were harvested at 0, 2, 6, or 24 hr post-stimulation or infection by addition of 500 mL Trizol (Invitrogen), and RNA extracted
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN), as described (Teles et al., 2013). After DNase treatment (QIAGEN) to remove genomic DNA, RNA
concentration was obtained by spectrophotometry and equivalent amounts of RNA were used as template for first cDNA strand syn-
thesis, which was performed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad) and a mixture of random hexamer and oligo(dT) primers
(Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR of cDNA was performed using SYBR Green (Kapa Biosystems, Roche) fluorescence as a surrogate for
transcript abundance; reactions were performed on a CFX96 Realtime System machine (BioRad). To detect fold change in iNOS
mRNA abundance, iNOS transcript was normalized to beta actin transcript (see Key Resources Table for primers) and each time-
point was compared to control cells using the delta-delta-Ct method.
Morpholinos (Gene Tools; see Key Resources Table for sequences) were used to block translation or splicing of transcript for irf8
(0.6mM) (Li et al., 2011), pu.1 (mixture of 0.375mM component 1 and 0.025mM component 2) (Clay et al., 2007), myD88 (5mM) (Bates
et al., 2007; Cambier et al., 2014), or ccr2 (0.3mM) (Cambier et al., 2014). Morpholinos or in vitro-transcribed H2B-CFP (Megason,
2009) were diluted in tango buffer (Thermo Scientific) containing 2% phenol red (Sigma) and injected into the yolk of 1-2 cell-stage
embryos in �1 nL (Tobin et al., 2012). Liposomes loaded with clodronate or PBS (van Rooijen et al., 1996) were diluted 1:5 in PBS +
2% phenol red and injected into 2-dpf-old larvae in �10 nL via the caudal vein; liposomes were re-administered every 4 days. To
generate larvae with fluorescent mitochondria in axons, eggs were coinjected at the 1-to-4-cell stage with 50 mg/mL in vitro-tran-
scribed tol2 transposase RNA, 25 ng/mL of an existing pDEST-UAS:MLS-dsRed plasmid (O’Donnell et al., 2013), and 25 ng/mL of
a constructed pDEST Tol2 plasmid consisting of GAL4 expressed from the Xenopus laevis neuronal beta tubulin (nbt) promoter
(Peri and Nu
¨ sslein-Volhard, 2008). To generate larvae with individual labeled oligodendrocytes, eggs were coinjected at the 1-to-
4-cell stage with 50 mg/mL in vitro-transcribed tol2 transposase RNA and 1 ng/mL of the mbp:eGFP-CAAX plasmid (Almeida et al.,
2011). At 3 dpf, larvae were screened by fluorescence to identify those that had an individual GFP-positive oligodendrocyte near
the cloaca; diagrams of these larvae were drawn at 4 dpf to indicate the location of the GFP-positive cell. The diagrams were
used to guide injection of bacteria or PBS into the spinal cord adjacent from the cloaca, as closely as possible to the GFP-positive
oligodendrocyte. After fluorescence imaging to confirm successful injection, larvae were imaged by confocal (see below).
M. marinum M strain (ATCC #BAA-535) and its derivative, M. marinum:PGL-1, expressing tdTomato, wasabi or eBFP under control
of the msp12 promoter (Cosma et al., 2006; Takaki et al., 2013), were grown under hygromycin (Mediatech) or kanamycin (Sigma)
selection in 7H9 Middlebrook medium (Difco) supplemented with oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, and Tween-80 (Sigma) (Takaki
et al., 2013). M. marinum:PGL-1 was constructed by transforming M. marinum with the integrating plasmid pWM122, which encodes
the M. leprae genes ML0126, ML0127, ML0128, ML2346c, ML2347, and ML2348 under the M. fortuitum pBlaF* promoter (Tabouret
et al., 2010). Kanamycin-resistant transformants were confirmed by PCR using primers targeting all six M. leprae genes (Tabouret
et al., 2010). A single transformant was further confirmed by mass spectrometry of its phenolic glycolipids; this strain was used
for all subsequent experiments. For infections, M. leprae was isolated from mouse footpads, labeled with fluorescent dye
(PKH67, PKH29, or CellVue Claret, Sigma), then tested for viability by radiorespirometry, as described (Lahiri et al., 2005). Only prep-
arations that exceeded 80% viability were used for infection. Inoculum was calculated based on enumeration performed by the
NHDP, with 106 M. leprae/mL. P. aeruginosa PAO1 expressing GFP has been described (Brannon et al., 2009).
To determine the structure of mycobacterial phenolic glycolipids, M. marinum WT and M. marinum:PGL-1 were cultured in 20 mL of
7H9 medium, supplemented with 10% albumin/dextrose/catalase (EMD Chemicals, San Diego, CA), to mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.5 ±
0.1). Total lipids were extracted from cell pellets using 20 mL LC-MS grade chloroform:methanol (Fisher) at 2:1, then 1:1, then 1:2, for
1 hr each, as described (Layre et al., 2011). Collected solvents were dried under nitrogen and total lipids weighed. Each lipid extract,
in addition to PGL-1 standard from M. leprae (BEI) and PGL-mar standard from WT M. marinum, was analyzed on an Agilent Tech-
nologies 6520 Accurate-Mass Q-Tof and a 1200 series HPLC system with a Varian Monochrom diol column (3 mm x 150 mm x 2 mm)
and a Varian Monochrom diol guard column (3 mm x 4.6 mm). Lipids were resuspended at 0.5 mg/mL in solvent A (hexanes:isopro-
panol, 70:30 [v: v], 0.02% [m/v] formic acid, 0.01% [m/v] ammonium hydroxide), then 10 mg were injected and the column was eluted
at 0.15 mL/min with a binary gradient from 0% to 100% solvent B (isopropanol:methanol, 70:30 [v/v], 0.02% [m/v] formic acid, 0.01%
[m/v] ammonium hydroxide): 0–10 min, 0% B; 17–22 min, 50% B; 30–35 min, 100% B; 40–44 min, 0% B, followed by additional 6 min
0% B postrun. Ionization was maintained at 325�C with a 5 L/min drying gas flow, a 30 psig nebulizer pressure, and 5,500 V. Spectra

 were collected in positive ion mode from m/z 100 to 3,000 at 1 spectrum/s. Continuous infusion calibrants included m/z 121.050873
and 922.009798 in positive ion mode. Collision-induced dissociation was performed with an energy of 30 V.
Wide-field microscopy was performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E equipped with a C-HGFIE 130W mercury light source, Chroma
FITC (41001) filter, and 3 2/0.10 Plan Apochromat objective. Fluorescence images for evaluating bacterial escape from the vascu-
lature were captured with a CoolSNAP HQ2 Monochrome Camera (Photometrics) using NIS-Elements (version 3.22). Quantification
of fluorescent bacterial infection, using Fluorescent Pixel Count (FPC) quantification of images of individual embryos, was performed
using the FPC macro in ImageJ, as described (Takaki et al., 2012).
For confocal imaging, larvae were imbedded in 1.5% low melting-point agarose (Davis and Ramakrishnan, 2009). A series of z
stack images with a 2-3 mm step size was generated through the infected spinal cord with the image centered at the injection site
or cloaca, using either the galvo scanner (laser scanner) of the Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a 3 20 Plan Apo 0.75 NA objective,
or the resonant laser scanner of a Leica TCS-SP5 AOBS confocal microscope with a 20x Plan Apo 0.70 NA. Bacterial burdens were
determined by using the three-dimensional surface-rendering feature of Imaris (Bitplane Scientific Software) (Yang et al., 2012).
Macrophage numbers, shape and speed were determined using tracking of surface-rendered features on Imaris. When events
were compared between larvae, identical confocal laser settings, software settings and Imaris surface-rendering algorithims
were used.
Before fixing larvae for TEM, they were imaged by confocal microscopy in order measure the distance from the cloaca to the spinal
cord lesion; this allowed sections to be taken through confirmed demyelinating lesions after the larvae were fixed, or through sites of
PBS-injection in controls. After rescuing larvae from 1.5% agarose used for confocal imaging, healthy larvae were anesthetized,
cooled to 4�C, then fixed overnight in ice-cold 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (Sigma) containing 2% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy
Services), 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services) and 4% sucrose (Fisher) (Czopka and Lyons, 2011). Following
several washes in buffer, the larvae were postfixed in a solution of 2% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Services) and
0.1M imidazole (Electron Microscopy Services) in cacodylate buffer for 1 hr on ice. The larvae were rinsed multiple times in water
and treated with 0.5% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Services) overnight at 4�C. They were then dehydrated through a graded
series of ethanols (from 30% to 100%), passed through propylene oxide (Electron Microscopy Services) and infiltrated with Epo-
nate12 (Ted Pella) overnight. The larvae were embedded in fresh Eponate12 and the blocks polymerized at 60�C. The areas of interest
were identified relative to the cloaca by comparing to confocal imaged taken of the fish before fixation, and 50 nm (silver interference
color) sections were taken through these areas on an ultramictome (RMC MTX) and deposited on grids. The grids were stained with
saturated uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Services) and Reynolds lead citrate (Fisher) and examined on a JEOL 100CX electron
microscope at 60kV. Images were collected on film, and then scanned at 1200 dpi to create digital files. Axons were identified by the
presence of microtubules and/or microfilaments and an intact outer membrane. Decompacted myelin was identified by the presence
of large, electron-lucent spaces in between myelin lamellae that were not observed in the absence of infection. Myelin dissociated
from axons was identified by the presence of electron dense ‘‘whorls’’ of myelin lamellae that did not contain an axon. Mitochondria
were identified by an intact double membrane and cristae. Axon number, myelination, size, and presence of mitochondria were
scored by randomly selecting axons in each image. To assure that axons selection was truly random, each image was opened in
its original dimensions in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, version 12.1) and overlaid with a 50-pixel grid; only axons under grid nodes
were scored (Czopka and Lyons, 2011).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses were performed on Prism (version 5.0a, GraphPad). Not significant, p R 0.05; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001;
**** p % 0.0001.
DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY
The following software was used: Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator (quantification of axons, myelin and mitochondria in TEMs;
figure preparation), ImageJ (quantification of axons, myelin and mitochondria in TEMs; bacterial burden by FPC), and Imaris (tracking
and rendering confocal objects); see Key Resources Table for more information.

Figure S2. Collision-Induced Dissociation of Mycobacterial PGLs, Related to Figures 3A and 3B
(A) Collision-induced dissociation of an ammoniated adduct of PGL-1 standard isolated from M. leprae shows calculated masses on the structure (left) with
detected masses shown in the chromatogram (right). 30V collision energy; blue diamond = collided ion. Detected ions are assigned when they match the
calculated masses within 10 parts per million (ppm), and the detailed substructures shown are consistent with known natural PGL components, but are not
established directly. a, b and c correspond to the proximal, intermediate distal monosaccharides from M. leprae PGL-1.
(B) Collision-induced dissociation of PGL-mar standard isolated from WT M. marinum, shown as in (A).
(C) Collision-induced dissociation of PGL-1 from total lipid extract of an M. marinum:PGL-1 log phase culture, shown as in A. The fragments at m/z 525.25
detected in collision of PGL-1 from M. marinum:PGL-1 (C) and M. leprae (A), correspond to the known mass of PGL trisaccharides. In M. marinum:PGL-1 we
detected PGL fragments corresponding to the loss of mycocerosic acid and monosaccharide c (m/z 1504.19) or the disaccharide cb (m/z 1314.10) or the
trisaccharide cba (m/z 1140.01). These fragments provide a highly specific signature for the trisaccharide structure that is seen also in M. leprae PGL-1 fragments
m/z 1574.27, m/z 1384.18 and m/z 1210.09 (A).

axons (pink), nonmyelinated axons (orange), decompacted myelin (green highlight and arrows), and myelin dissociated from axons (blue highlight and arrows).
10 mm bars.
 Figure S4. Association of Infected Macrophages with Demyelinating Lesions, Related to Figure 5I
At 2 days post-infection (5 dpf), nerve lesions were identified in M. marinum:PGL-1-infected mbp:eGFP-CAAX; mpeg1:Brainbow larvae (Figure 5I).
(A) Each lesion was scored for presence or absence of infected macrophages; association of infected macrophages with myelin protrusions was deemed
significant (p = 0.01) with a two-tailed binomial test.
(B) Lesion from fish #7 (A), which had 3 demyelinating lesions (dashed boxes). For clarity, red macrophages or fragments of their red membrane are shown as
rendered objects; green myelin and blue bacteria are show as the unmodified fluorescent images. 10 mm bar.
(C) Insets of each lesion from B, showing myelin protrusions and colocalized, infected macrophages that are still intact (1 and 2) or fragmented (3) and dead.
Arrowheads indicate myelin protrusions; for clarity, not every myelin protrusion that was scored is indicated with an arrowhead. White arrows, intact macro-
phages; yellow arrows, fragments of dsRed-positive macrophage membrane. 10 mm bars.

(A) Mean (±SEM) fold change of Nos2 (iNOS) transcript in WT murine macrophages, 6 hr after infection with WT M. marinum or M. marinum:PGL-1 (both MOI 1),
compared to uninfected cells. (Average of 3 independent experiments; Student’s t test).
(B) Representative confocal images of a macrophage aggregate in an mpeg1 larva infected with M. leprae and stained with a-iNOS antibody. 10 mm bar.
(C) Representative confocal images of a macrophage aggregate in an mpeg1 larva infected with M. marinum:PGL-1 and stained with a-iNOS antibody. 10 mm bar.
(D) Representative confocal images of a macrophage aggregate in larvae as in C, stained with a-nitrotyrosine antibody. 10 mm bar.
