Background
Child overweight and obesity has increased globally, and can be associated with short- and long-term health consequences.
Objectives
To assess the effects of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool
children up to the age of 6 years.
Search methods
We performed a systematic literature search in the databases Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and
LILACS, as well as in the trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP Search Portal. We also checked references of identified trials and
systematic reviews. We applied no language restrictions. The date of the last search was March 2015 for all databases.
Selection criteria
We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for treating overweight or
obesity in preschool children aged 0 to 6 years.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias, evaluated the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument,
and extracted data following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We contacted trial authors for additional
information.

 Main results
We included 7 RCTs with a total of 923 participants: 529 randomised to an intervention and 394 to a comparator. The number of
participants per trial ranged from 18 to 475. Six trials were parallel RCTs, and one was a cluster RCT. Two trials were three-arm trials,
each comparing two interventions with a control group. The interventions and comparators in the trials varied. We categorised the
comparisons into two groups: multicomponent interventions and dietary interventions. The overall quality of the evidence was low or
very low, and six trials had a high risk of bias on individual ’Risk of bias’ criteria. The children in the included trials were followed up
for between six months and three years.
In trials comparing a multicomponent intervention with usual care, enhanced usual care, or information control, we found a greater
reduction in body mass index (BMI) z score in the intervention groups at the end of the intervention (6 to 12 months): mean difference
(MD) -0.3 units (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.2); P < 0.00001; 210 participants; 4 trials; low-quality evidence, at 12 to 18
months’ follow-up: MD -0.4 units (95% CI -0.6 to -0.2); P = 0.0001; 202 participants; 4 trials; low-quality evidence, and at 2 years’
follow-up: MD -0.3 units (95% CI -0.4 to -0.1); 96 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence.
One trial stated that no adverse events were reported; the other trials did not report on adverse events. Three trials reported health-
related quality of life and found improvements in some, but not all, aspects. Other outcomes, such as behaviour change and parent-
child relationship, were inconsistently measured.
One three-arm trial of very low-quality evidence comparing two types of diet with control found that both the dairy-rich diet (BMI
z score change MD -0.1 units (95% CI -0.11 to -0.09); P < 0.0001; 59 participants) and energy-restricted diet (BMI z score change
MD -0.1 units (95% CI -0.11 to -0.09); P < 0.0001; 57 participants) resulted in greater reduction in BMI than the comparator at the
end of the intervention period, but only the dairy-rich diet maintained this at 36 months’ follow-up (BMI z score change in MD -0.7
units (95% CI -0.71 to -0.69); P < 0.0001; 52 participants). The energy-restricted diet had a worse BMI outcome than control at this
follow-up (BMI z score change MD 0.1 units (95% CI 0.09 to 0.11); P < 0.0001; 47 participants). There was no substantial difference
in mean daily energy expenditure between groups. Health-related quality of life, adverse effects, participant views, and parenting were
not measured.
No trial reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity, or socioeconomic effects.
All results should be interpreted cautiously due to their low quality and heterogeneous interventions and comparators.
Authors’ conclusions
Muticomponent interventions appear to be an effective treatment option for overweight or obese preschool children up to the age of 6
years. However, the current evidence is limited, and most trials had a high risk of bias. Most trials did not measure adverse events. We
have identified four ongoing trials that we will include in future updates of this review.
The role of dietary interventions is more equivocal, with one trial suggesting that dairy interventions may be effective in the longer
term, but not energy-restricted diets. This trial also had a high risk of bias.

Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool children up to the
age of 6 years
Review question
How effective are diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions in reducing the weight of overweight and obese preschool
children?
Background
Across the world more children are becoming overweight and obese. These children are more likely to suffer from health problems,
both while as children and in later life. More information is needed about what works best for treating this problem.
Study characteristics
We found 7 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups)
comparing diet, physical activity, and behavioural (where habits are changed or improved) treatments (interventions) to a variety of

 control groups (who did not receive treatment) delivered to 923 overweight or obese preschool children up to the age of 6 years. We
grouped the studies by the type of intervention. Our systematic review reported on the effects of multicomponent interventions and
dietary interventions compared with no intervention, ’usual care’, enhanced usual care, or some other therapy if it was also delivered in
the intervention arm. The children in the included studies were monitored (called follow-up) for between six months and three years.
Key results
Most studies reported the body mass index (BMI) z score: BMI is a measure of body fat and is calculated by dividing weight (in
kilograms) by the square of the body height measured in metres (kg/m²). In children, BMI is often measured in a way that takes into
account sex, weight, and height as children grow older (BMI z score). We summarised the results of 4 trials in 202 children reporting
the BMI z score, which on average was 0.4 units lower in the multicomponent intervention groups compared with the control groups.
Lower units indicate more weight loss. For example, a 5-year-old girl with a body height of 110 cm and a body weight of 32 kg has
a BMI of 26.4 and a BMI z score of 2.99. If this girl loses 2 kg weight within a year (and gained 1 cm in height), she would have
reduced her BMI z score by approx. 0.4 units (her BMI would be 24.3 and her BMI z score 2.58). Accordingly, the average change in
weight in the multicomponent interventions was 2.8 kg lower than in the control groups. Other effects of the interventions, such as
improvements in health-related quality of life or evaluation of the parent-child relationship, were less clear, and most studies did not
measure adverse events. No study investigated death from any cause, morbidity, or socioeconomic effects. One study found that BMI
z score reduction was greater at the end of both dairy-rich and energy-restricted dietary interventions compared with a healthy lifestyle
education only. However, only the dairy-rich diet continued to show benefits two to three years later, whereas the energy-restricted diet
group had a greater increase in BMI z score than the control group.
This evidence is up to date as of March 2015.
Quality of the evidence
The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low, mainly because there were just a few studies per outcome measurement or the
number of the included children was small. In addition, many children left the studies before they had finished.

 B A C K G R O U N D
The prevalence of overweight and obese children and adolescents
has increased throughout the world, presenting a global public
health crisis (Ng 2014; WHO 2015a). Although once consid-
ered to be a condition affecting only high-income countries, rates
of paediatric overweight and obesity have recently started to rise
dramatically in some low- and middle-income countries (Wang
2012). Using the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) stan-
dard definition, the age-standardised prevalence of overweight and
obesity in children and adolescents has increased in low-, middle-
, and high-income countries over the last 30 years (Cole 2000). In
2013, the prevalence of overweight and obese children and ado-
lescents in high-income countries was estimated at 23.8% (95%
confidence interval (CI) 22.9 to 24.7) for boys and 22.6% (95%
CI 21.7 to 23.6) for girls. In low- and middle-income countries,
the prevalence was estimated as 12.9% (95% CI 12.3 to 13.5) of
boys and 13.4% (95% CI 13 to 13.9) of girls (Ng 2014). Very
young children are also affected. In 2010, de Onis 2010 used the
World Health Organization growth standards to estimate that over
42 million children under 5 years of age were overweight or obese,
with approximately 35 million of these children living in low- and
middle-income countries (WHO 2015b).
Inequalities in overweight and obesity prevalence have also
been documented. Generally, socioeconomically disadvantaged
children in high-income countries (Knai 2012; NCB 2015;
Shrewsbury 2008), and children of higher socioeconomic status in
low- and middle-income countries (Lobstein 2004; Wang 2012),
are at greater risk of becoming overweight. However, this relation-
ship may vary by population demographics (for example age, gen-
der, ethnicity), and environment (for example country, urbanisa-
tion) (Wang 2012). The prevalence of obesity has been shown to
vary by ethnicity, with large data sets showing substantial ethnic
variation in English (HSCIC 2015), American (Freedman 2006;
Skinner 2014), and New Zealand (Rajput 2014) child popula-
tions.
Whilst there is some evidence that the rate of increase in paediatric
obesity may be slowing in some high-income countries, current
levels remain too high, and continue to rise in many low- and
middle-income countries (Olds 2011; Rokholm 2010). However,
an additional concern in some high-income countries such as the
USA, in Kelly 2013 and Skinner 2014, and England, in CMO
2015 and Ells 2015, is the rise in severe paediatric obesity. Whilst
the IOTF published an international definition for severe paedi-
atric (morbid) obesity in 2012 (Cole 2012), often severe obesity
prevalence is reported using country-specific cut points, making
international comparisons difficult. However, data from the USA,
in Skinner 2014, and England, in Ells 2015, has shown that the
prevalence of severe paediatric obesity varies by socioeconomic sta-
tus and ethnicity, and may result in a greater risk of adverse car-
diometabolic events and severe obesity in adulthood (Kelly 2013).
Description of the condition
Childhoodoverweightandobesityresultsfromanaccumulationof
excess body fat, and can increase the risk of both short- and longer-
term health consequences. Numerous obesity-related comorbidi-
ties can develop during childhood, which include muscular skele-
tal complaints (Paulis 2014); cardiovascular risk factors such as hy-
pertension, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidaemia (Reilly 2003),
even in very young children (Bocca 2013); motor and develop-
mental delays (Cataldo 2015); and conditions such as such as sleep
apnoea (Narang 2012), asthma (Egan 2013), liver disease, and
type 2 diabetes (Daniels 2009; Lobstein 2004). The condition can
also affect psychosocial well-being, with obese young people sus-
ceptible to reduced self esteem and quality of life (Griffiths 2010),
as well as stigmatisation (Puhl 2007; Tang-Peronard 2008). Evi-
dence also shows that childhood obesity can track into adulthood
(Parsons 1999; Singh 2008; Whitaker 1997), and is therefore asso-
ciated with an increased risk of ill health later in life (Reilly 2011).
Description of the intervention
Given the serious implications associated with childhood and ado-
lescent obesity, effective treatment is imperative. Whilst the fun-
damental principles of weight management in children and ado-
lescents are the same as in adults (that is reduced energy intake
and increased energy expenditure), the primary aim of treatment
(that is weight reduction or deceleration of weight gain) and the
most suitable intervention approach vary, and are dependent on
the child’s age and degree of excess weight, among other consid-
erations. Family-based interventions combining dietary, physical
activity, and behavioural components have been shown to be ef-
fective and are considered the current best practice in the treat-
ment of childhood obesity in children under 12 years of age (Oude
Luttikhuis 2009).
Adverse effects of the intervention
It is not anticipated that diet, physical activity, and behavioural
interventions will lead to adverse outcomes. However, as with all
obesity treatment interventions in children and young people, po-
tential adverse effects should be considered, including effects on
linear growth, eating disorders and psychological well-being.
How the intervention might work
The home environment is important in the aetiology of childhood
obesity, with parents playing a large role in food choice and phys-
ical activity for their children. In surveys in the USA, Wansink
estimated that the ‘nutritional gatekeeper’ (who buys and cooks
the food) controls 72% of the food eaten by children, both within
and outside the home (Wansink 2006). A systematic review by
Clark et al. showed that a high level of parental restriction of snack
7

 foods is associated with increased energy intake and weight gain
in children (Clark 2007). In contrast, ‘covert’ control of children’s
food intake by controlling the home eating environment to limit
exposure to unhealthy foods (that is not buying unhealthy foods)
is shown to lower the intake of unhealthy snacks when compared
with ‘overt’ control (that is buying the snacks but not allowing
access) (Ogden 2006). In terms of physical activity, a systematic
review showed that parental support is strongly associated with
physical activity levels in children, albeit the influence of parental
modelling by being physically active themselves was inconsistent
(Gustafson 2006).
Poor family functioning, such as poor communication and high
levels of conflict, is also associated with higher risk of obesity in
children (Halliday 2014). Authoritative parenting style is associ-
ated with lower risk of obesity in children, when compared with
other parenting styles (Sleddens 2011). Due to the importance of
the role of parents in the home environment and the importance of
parenting styles and skills, parents have been defined as the ‘agents
of change’ in the family for intervening with children under 12
years of age who are obese (Golan 2004). In addition, young chil-
dren themselves are receptive to early and fact-based health edu-
cation (Baxter 2015). Qualitative research suggests that interven-
tions for preschool-aged children should aim to promote parental
modelling of positive behaviours, create home and preschool en-
vironments that promote healthy diets, and simultaneously target
factors at the family and preschool/childcare levels (Paes 2015).
Why it is important to do this review
The first version of this systematic review was published in 2003
and included analysis of childhood obesity treatment trials pub-
lished up until July 2001 (Summerbell 2003). The second ver-
sion was published in 2009, updating the 2003 review (Oude
Luttikhuis 2009).
To reflect the rapid growth in this field, the third update to this
review has been split across six reviews focusing on the following
treatment approaches: surgery; drugs; parent-only interventions;
diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for young
children aged 0 to 6 years; schoolchildren aged 6 to 11 years; and
adolescents aged 12 to 17 years.
The current review examines the effectiveness of interventions
for preschool children aged up to 6 years. Previous systematic re-
views identified an absence of randomised controlled trials assess-
inginterventionsforpreschool-agedchildren(Bluford 2007; Bond
2009; Bond 2011; Oude Luttikhuis 2009), however a number of
trials have since been published.
The results of this current review and other systematic reviews in
this series will provide information on which to underpin clinical
guidelines and health policy on the treatment of childhood obesity.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled clinical trials with at least six
months of follow-up.
Types of participants
We included trials of overweight or obese children with a mean
trial age of 0 to 6 years at the commencement of the intervention.
We excluded the critically ill, or children with a syndromic cause
for their obesity (for example Prader-Willi).
Types of interventions
We planned to investigate the following comparisons of interven-
tion versus control/comparator.
Intervention
Any form of lifestyle intervention with a primary aim to treat over-
weight or obesity in children (any form of dietary, physical activity
and/or behavioural therapy delivered as single- or multicompo-
nent interventions).
Comparator
The comparison could be no intervention, usual care (however
defined), or an alternative concomitant therapy providing it is
delivered in the intervention arm.
Concomitant interventions had to be the same in the intervention
and comparator groups to establish fair comparisons.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. Changes in body mass index (BMI) and body weight.
2. Adverse events.

 on search strategies, see Appendix 1). If we identified new trials
for inclusion, we evaluated these, incorporated the findings into
our review, and resubmitted another review draft (Beller 2013).
If we detected additional relevant key words during any of the
electronic or other searches, we modified the electronic search
strategies to incorporate these terms and documented the changes.
Searching other resources
We attempted to identify other potentially eligible trials or ancil-
lary publications by searching the reference lists of retrieved in-
cluded trials, (systematic) reviews, meta-analyses, and health tech-
nology assessment reports. We also contacted authors of included
trials to identify any further trials that we may have missed.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (two of KR, JC, EL, COM, LA, LAl-K, EM,
LE) independently scanned the abstract, title, or both, of every
record retrieved, to determine which trials we should assess further.
We investigated all potentially relevant articles as full text. We
resolved any discrepancies through consensus or through recourse
to a third review author (KR, JC, EL, LAl-K). Where resolution
of a disagreement was not possible, we added the article to those
’awaiting assessment’ and contacted trial authors for clarification.
We presented an adapted PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow chart showing the
process of trial selection (Liberati 2009).
Data extraction and management
For trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, two review authors
(of JC, EL, COM, LA, EM, KR) independently abstracted key
participant and intervention characteristics and reported data on
efficacy outcomes and adverse events using standard data extrac-
tion templates as supplied by the CMED, with any disagreements
to be resolved by discussion, or, if required, by consultation with
a third review author (KR) (for details see Table 1; Appendix 2;
Appendix 3; Appendix 4; Appendix 5; Appendix 6; Appendix 7;
Appendix 8; Appendix 9) .
We provided information including trial identifier about poten-
tially relevant ongoing trials in the Characteristics of ongoing
studies table and in Appendix 5 (Matrix of study endpoints (pub-
lications and trial documents)). We attempted to find the protocol
of each included trial and reported primary, secondary, and other
outcomes in comparison with data in publications in Appendix 5.
We e-mailed all authors of included trials to enquire whether they
were willing to answer questions regarding their trials. Appendix
10 shows the results of this survey. Thereafter, we sought relevant
missing information on the trial from the primary author(s) of the
article, if required.
Dealing with duplicate and companion publications
In the event of duplicate publications, companion documents, or
multiple reports of a primary trial, we attempted to maximise yield
of information by collating all available data and using the most
complete data set aggregated across all known publications. If in
doubt, we gave priority to the publication reporting the longest
follow-up associated with our primary or secondary outcomes.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (of JC, EL, COM, LA, EM, KR) indepen-
dently assessed the risk of bias of each included trial. We resolved
any disagreements by consensus or by consulting a third review
author (KR).
We used the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ assessment tool to evaluate
the following criteria (Higgins 2011a; Higgins 2011b).
• Random sequence generation (selection bias).
• Allocation concealment (selection bias).
• Imbalances in baseline characteristics.
• Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias).
• Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias).
• Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias).
• Selective reporting (reporting bias).
• Other potential sources of bias.
We judged the above ’Risk of bias’ criteria as ’low risk’, ’high risk’,
or ’unclear risk’, and evaluated individual bias items as described
in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Higgins 2011a). We presented a ’Risk of bias’ graph and a ’Risk
of bias’ summary figure. We assessed the impact of individual bias
domains on trial results at endpoint and trial levels. In case of high
risk of selection bias, we marked all endpoints investigated in the
associated trial as ’high risk’.
We evaluated whether imbalances in baseline characteristics ex-
isted and how these were addressed (Egbewale 2014).
For performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel) and
detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors), we evaluated the
risk of bias separately for each outcome type (objective and subjec-
tive) (Hróbjartsson 2013). We noted whether endpoints were self
reported, investigator assessed, or adjudicated outcome measures.
We considered the implications of missing outcome data from
individual participants per outcome such as high drop-out rates
(for example above 15%) or disparate attrition rates (for example
difference of 10% or more between trial arms).
We assessed outcome reporting bias by integrating the results
of ’Examination of outcome reporting bias’ (Kirkham 2010)
(Appendix 6), in the ’Matrix of study endpoints (publications
and trial documents)’ (Appendix 5), and section ’Outcomes (out-
comes reported in abstract of publication)’ of the Characteristics
10

 of included studies table. This analysis formed the basis for the
judgement of selective reporting (reporting bias).
We distinguished between self reported, investigator assessed, and
adjudicated outcome measures.
We defined the following endpoints as potentially self reported
(’subjective’) outcomes.
• Adverse events.
• Health-related quality of life.
• Parent-child relationship or assessment of parenting.
• Participant views of the intervention.
We defined the following outcomes as potentially investigator as-
sessed (’objective’) outcomes.
• Changes in BMI and body weight.
• Adverse events.
• All-cause mortality.
• Morbidity.
Measures of treatment effect
We expressed dichotomous data as odds ratios or risk ratios with
95% confidence intervals (CIs). We expressed continuous data as
mean differences with 95% CI. We expressed time-to-event data
as hazard ratios with 95% CIs.
Unit of analysis issues
We took into account the level at which randomisation occurred,
such as cross-over trials, cluster-randomised trials, and multiple
observations for the same outcome.
Dealing with missing data
We obtained relevant missing data from authors, if feasible, and
evaluated important numerical data such as screened, eligible, ran-
domised participants as well as intention-to-treat, as-treated, and
per-protocol populations. We investigated attrition rates, for ex-
ample dropouts, losses to follow-up, and withdrawals, and criti-
cally appraised issues of missing data and imputation methods (for
example last observation carried forward).
Where standard deviations for outcomes were not reported, and
we did not receive information from trial authors, we calculated
these following the methods presented in the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Where papers did not report
results as change from baseline, we calculated this and for the
standard deviation differences followed the methods presented in
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for
imputing these (Section 16.1.3.2 Imputing standard deviations for
changes from baseline), and assumed a correlation of 0.5 between
baseline and follow-up measures as suggested by Follmann 1992.
Assessment of heterogeneity
In the event of substantial clinical, methodological, or statistical
heterogeneity, we did not report trial results as meta-analytically
pooled effect estimates. We identified heterogeneity by visual in-
spection of the forest plots and by using a standard Chi² test with
a significance level of α = 0.1, in view of the low power of this test.
We examined heterogeneity using the I² statistic, which quantifies
inconsistency across trials to assess the impact of heterogeneity
on the meta-analysis (Higgins 2002; Higgins 2003), where an I²
statistic of 75% or more indicates a considerable level of inconsis-
tency (Higgins 2011a).
When we found heterogeneity, we attempted to determine po-
tential reasons for it by examining individual trial and subgroup
characteristics.
Assessment of reporting biases
If we had included 10 or more trials for a given outcome, we would
have used funnel plots to assess small-trial effects. Given that there
are several explanations for funnel plot asymmetry, we would have
interpreted results carefully (Sterne 2011).
Data synthesis
Unless there was good evidence for homogeneous effects across
trials, we primarily summarised data that was at low risk of bias by
means of a random-effects model (Wood 2008). We had planned
to interpret random-effects meta-analyses with due consideration
of the whole distribution of effects, ideally by presenting a predic-
tion interval, however relatively few trials were included in each
category, of low methodological quality, and so we did not con-
duct these analyses (Higgins 2009). A prediction interval specifies
a predicted range for the true treatment effect in an individual trial
(Riley 2011). In addition, we performed statistical analyses ac-
cording to the statistical guidelines referenced in the latest version
of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Higgins 2011a).
Quality of evidence
We presented the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome
according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, De-
velopment and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, which takes into
account issues not only related to internal validity (risk of bias,
inconsistency, imprecision, publication bias) but also to external
validity such as directness of results. Two review authors (JC, EL)
independently rated the quality of the evidence for each outcome.
We presented a summary of the evidence in a ’Summary of find-
ings’ table, which provides key information about the best estimate
of the magnitude of the effect, in relative terms and absolute dif-
ferences for each relevant comparison of alternative management
strategies, numbers of participants and trials addressing each im-
portant outcome, and the rating of the overall confidence in effect

 estimates for each outcome. We created the ’Summary of findings’
table based on the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a). We pre-
sented results for the outcomes as described in Types of outcome
measures. In addition, we established an appendix ’Checklist to aid
consistency and reproducibility of GRADE assessments’ to help
with standardisation of ’Summary of findings’ tables (Appendix
9) (Meader 2014).
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We expected the following characteristics to introduce clinical het-
erogeneity, and planned to carry out subgroup analyses with in-
vestigation of interactions where data permitted.
• Differences in BMI at baseline.
• Length of follow-up.
• The impact of comparator/control: whether concomitant
therapy or no treatment (true control).
• The setting in which the intervention was conducted.
Sensitivity analysis
We planned to perform sensitivity analyses in order to explore the
influence of the following factors (when applicable) on effect sizes
by restricting analysis to the following.
• Published trials.
• Taking into account risk of bias, as specified in the
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies section.
• Very long or large trials to establish the extent to which they
dominate the results.
• Trials using the following filters: diagnostic criteria,
language of publication, source of funding (industry versus
other), country.
We also tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analysis
using different statistical models (fixed-effect and random-effects
models).

Results of the search
The searches generated 13,784 hits after duplicates were removed.
Screening of titles and abstracts identified 105 papers to evaluate
for formal inclusion and exclusion. Seven completed randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were
included in the review. For a detailed description of the included
trials, see Characteristics of included studies. We also identified
four ongoing trials; see Characteristics of ongoing studies. We have
presented the flow of trials through the review in Figure 1.

 Included studies
For a detailed description of the characteristics of included trials,
see Characteristics of included studies and Appendix 2; Appendix
3; Appendix 4; Appendix 5; Appendix 6; Appendix 7; Appendix
8; Appendix 11). The following is a succinct overview.
Source of data
We obtained the majority of data presented in the review from
published literature, including supplementary published data and
trials registers where available. For three trials, data were provided
via correspondence with the trial authors (Appendix 10).
Comparisons
We identified two main comparisons: six trials compared mul-
ticomponent interventions versus control (Bocca 2012; Lanigan
2010; Quattrin 2012; Stark 2011; Stark 2014; Taveras 2011), and
one trial compared dietary interventions versus control (Kelishadi
2009).
Overview of trial populations
The seven trials included a total of 923 participants, with over half
of these from just one trial (Taveras 2011). In total, 529 partici-
pants were randomised to an intervention and 394 to a compara-
tor. The proportion of participants finishing the trial was lowest
in Bocca 2012 at three years’ follow-up (39%), however data at
this follow-up are not yet available for inclusion in the review.
Similarly, two-year data (48% follow-up) are not yet available for
Lanigan 2010. For follow-up reported in this review, the propor-
tion of participants finishing the trial ranged from 47% to 93%
in the intervention groups and 71% to 94% in the comparator
groups. Individual sample size ranged between 18 and 475. See
Table 1 for details.
Trial design
Six trials were parallel comparisons with individual randomisation.
One trial wasaclusterRCT(Taveras 2011), where the primarycare
practice was the unit of randomisation. All seven RCTs had a supe-
riority design. Two RCTs had three comparisons (two intervention
groups and one usual care or control arm) (Kelishadi 2009; Stark
2014); the remaining trials had two comparison groups. Five tri-
als were single-centre trials (Bocca 2012; Kelishadi 2009; Lanigan
2010; Stark 2011; Stark 2014), one trial was conducted in four
centres (Quattrin 2012), and the cluster RCT was undertaken in
10 centres (Taveras 2011).
Trials were performed from 2003 to 2013. The duration of the in-
terventions was six months in four trials (Kelishadi 2009; Lanigan
2010; Stark 2011; Stark 2014), and ranged from 16 weeks, in
Bocca 2012, to two years, in Taveras 2011. The duration of follow-
up ranged from 12 months to three years. One trial terminated
before regular end (after 105 families were recruited), as prelimi-
nary analysis indicated efficacy (Bocca 2012).
Settings
The interventions were carried out in an outpatient setting in
three trials (Bocca 2012; Stark 2011; Stark 2014), primary care
in two trials (Quattrin 2012; Taveras 2011), a community setting
in one trial (Lanigan 2010), and an obesity research clinic in one
trial (Kelishadi 2009). Four trials were conducted in the USA
(Quattrin 2012; Stark 2011; Stark 2014; Taveras 2011), and one
was conducted in each of the Netherlands (Bocca 2012), UK (
Lanigan 2010), and Iran (Kelishadi 2009).
Participants
The diagnosticcriteriaforoverweightandobesitydifferedbetween
the trials. Two trials included children with BMI on or above the
85th percentile and who had a parent with BMI 27 or more, in
Quattrin 2012, or BMI over 25, in Taveras 2011. The latter trial
also included children with BMI on or above the 95th percentile
and no overweight parent. Three other trials included children
with BMI on or above the 95th percentile (Kelishadi 2009; Stark
2011; Stark 2014); two of these trials also specified BMI less than
100% above mean BMI and a parent with BMI 25 or more (Stark
2011; Stark 2014). Lanigan 2010 included children with BMI on
or above the 91st percentile or whose weight had crossed centiles
upwards, and Bocca 2012 included children who were ’overweight
or obese’ as defined by the International Obesity Task Force.
The age range for trial eligibility was 1 to 5 years (Lanigan 2010),
2 to 5 years (Quattrin 2012; Stark 2011; Stark 2014), 3 to 5
years (Bocca 2012), and 2 to 6.9 years (Taveras 2011). Kelishadi
2009 did not specify an age range. The mean age of children
included in the trials ranged from 4 to under 6 years in six of the
seven trials, and was 2.5 years in Lanigan 2010. The proportion of
girls varied from 25% to 80%, but was not reported by one trial
(Kelishadi 2009). Five trials reported mean BMI (Bocca 2012;
Kelishadi 2009; Lanigan 2010; Quattrin 2012; Taveras 2011),
which ranged from 18 to 22.7, and five trials reported BMI z score
(Bocca 2012; Lanigan 2010; Quattrin 2012; Stark 2014; Taveras
2011), which ranged from 1.0 to 2.7. Stark 2011 reported mean
BMI percentile (98 to 99). Mean parental BMI was 36 to 37 in the
one trial reporting this (Quattrin 2012). Taveras 2011 reported
the proportions of parents with BMI less than 25 (3% to 5%), 25
to 30 (36% to 52%), and 30 or more (44% to 61%).

 Five of the seven trials reported ethnicity. The proportion of
participants categorised as white was over 70% in four of the
trials (Lanigan 2010; Quattrin 2012; Stark 2011; Stark 2014),
and 47% to 70% in the fifth trial (Taveras 2011). Five trials re-
ported socioeconomic status using different indicators (Holling-
shead score, Hollingshead classification, family income, non-man-
ual social class,orparental educational attainment)(Lanigan 2010;
Quattrin 2012; Stark 2011; Stark 2014; Taveras 2011).
Interventions
The interventions in six of the seven trials included a combina-
tion of nutritional, physical activity, and behavioural components,
although approaches differed between the trials (Bocca 2012;
Lanigan 2010; Quattrin 2012; Stark 2011; Stark 2014; Taveras
2011). See Characteristics of included studies and Appendix 2 for
details of each trial. Two trials reported the same intervention,
’Learning about Activity and Understanding Nutrition for Child
Health’ (LAUNCH), which involved 18 group-based clinic ses-
sions and individual home visits over six months, targeting lifestyle
behaviour modification and parenting skills (Stark 2011; Stark
2014). Stark 2014 also compared a less intensive mode of delivery,
which was identical to the former except that individual home vis-
its were not undertaken. Quattrin 2012 reported a family-based
parenting and behavioural intervention involving 13 group ses-
sions over 12 months, individual meetings to shape goals, and 10
phone calls in between sessions. Bocca 2012 assessed a multidisci-
plinary intervention involving dietary advice, physical activity ses-
sions, and psychological counselling for parents, with a total of 25
sessions over 16 weeks. Taveras 2011 reported ’High Five for Kids’,
a behavioural intervention using motivational interviewing face-
to-face and by telephone, educational modules, and behavioural
goal setting. The intensive phase of the intervention lasted for
12 months followed by a 12-month maintenance phase, although
no details were reported of this. Lanigan 2010 assessed the ’Trim
Tots’ healthy lifestyle programme, which included nutritional ed-
ucation, physical activity, and behavioural change components.
Sessions were delivered in the community twice weekly for three
months, then weekly for three months.
The comparators in these six trials were enhanced usual care (Stark
2011; Stark 2014), information control (Quattrin 2012), usual
care (Bocca 2012; Taveras 2011), or a wait-list control (Lanigan
2010), with differences between trials in the intensity and amount
of contact (Characteristics of included studies; Appendix 2).
One trial compared two dietary approaches (dairy rich and energy
restricted) plus healthy lifestyle education versus healthy lifestyle
education alone (Kelishadi 2009). The family-centred education
sessions focused on health, nutrition, and physical activity and
occurred monthly over six months in all three groups.
Outcomes
Six of seven trials explicitly stated a primary/secondary endpoint
in the publication (Appendix 5). The most commonly defined
primary outcome in the publications was a BMI variable: BMI
z score (Bocca 2012; Lanigan 2010; Stark 2011; Stark 2014),
BMI (Taveras 2011), or percent BMI overweight (Quattrin 2012).
Where reported, primary outcomes defined in publications re-
flected those defined in trial registers, although in three trial publi-
cations (Bocca 2012; Stark 2011; Stark 2014), a greater number of
outcomes were specified as primary. In Lanigan 2010, the primary
outcome was specified as BMI in the trial register and BMI z score
in the publication. Only one of seven trials reported on adverse
events (Lanigan 2010), two reported health-related quality of life
(Bocca 2012; Stark 2011), five reported behaviour change (Bocca
2012; Kelishadi 2009; Stark 2011; Stark 2014; Taveras 2011), two
reported participant views of the intervention (Stark 2011; Taveras
2011), and two reported parent-child relationship or assessment of
parenting (Stark 2011; Stark2014). No trials investigated all-cause
mortality, morbidity, or socioeconomic effects.All seven trials pro-
vided a definition of endpoint measurement for BMI (Appendix
7). One trial was published as an abstract only, and a number of
secondary outcomes are not yet available (Lanigan 2010).
Excluded studies
After evaluation of the full publication, we excluded 82 of 105
full-text articles. The main reasons for exclusion were the types of
participants included and the trial design not being an RCT with
at least six months’ duration. Many trials had multiple reasons
for exclusion (for further details see Characteristics of excluded
studies, which lists the 12 trials with the most uncertainty regard-
ing inclusion).
Risk of bias in included studies
For details on risk of bias of included trials, see Characteristics of
included studies. For an overview of review authors’ judgements
about each ’Risk of bias’ item for individual trials and across all
trials, see Figure 2 and Figure 3.

 Allocation
All seven trials reported adequate sequence generation, but only
three described allocation concealment (Lanigan 2010; Stark
2011; Stark 2014). The risk of selection bias is therefore uncertain
in four of the seven included trials.
Blinding
We judged only one trial to have a low risk of performance bias,
as participants and personnel were blinded to treatment allocation
(Quattrin 2012). Three trials did not undertake blinding of par-
ticipants and personnel (Lanigan 2010; Stark 2011; Stark 2014);
we judged these trials to have a high risk of performance bias for
both objective and subjective outcomes (where reported). The risk
of performance bias was unclear in three trials: one was described
as single blind (Bocca 2012), and another as double-blind (in the
trial record only), but it was unclear who was blinded and how
this was achieved (Taveras 2011), and in the third blinding was
not reported (Kelishadi 2009).
We judged the risk of detection bias to be low for objective out-
comes in all trials, regardless of whether or not outcome asses-
sors were blinded. Two trials reporting subjective outcomes did
not undertake blinding of outcome assessors (Stark 2011; Stark
2014); we judged these trials to have a high risk of detection bias
for subjective outcomes. The risk of detection bias for subjective
outcomes was unclear in three trials, either because blinding was
not reported or it was unclear who was blinded and how this was
achieved (Bocca 2012; Kelishadi 2009; Taveras 2011).
Incomplete outcome data
We judged the risk of attrition bias to be low in three trials (Bocca
2012; Kelishadi 2009; Stark 2011). Three trials had an imbalance
in attrition between groups and were judged to have a high risk
of attrition bias (Lanigan 2010; Quattrin 2012; Stark 2014). The
risk of attrition bias was unclear for one trial that did not report
reasons for attrition and only reported baseline and results data
for participants completing the trial (Taveras 2011).
Selective reporting
We judged only two trials to have a low risk of selective reporting
bias (Stark 2011; Taveras 2011). We judged the remaining five
trials to have a high risk of selection bias, due to some outcomes
being incompletely reported or not reported at all.
Other potential sources of bias
There was a low risk of bias from other sources in four trials (Bocca
2012; Lanigan 2010; Stark 2011; Taveras 2011). We judged the
risk of bias from other sources to be unclear in the remaining three
trials.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary
of findings 2
Multicomponent interventions versus control
Sixtrialscomparedmulticomponentinterventionswith usual care,
enhanced usual care, information control, or wait-list control.
One trial assessed two interventions, LAUNCH with home vis-
its and LAUNCH without home visits (described in the analyses
as LAUNCH clinic only) (Stark 2014). Stark 2011 also assessed
LAUNCH (with home visits). The other four trials each assessed
different multicomponent interventions (Bocca 2012; Lanigan
2010; Quattrin 2012; Taveras 2011).
We considered outcomes here at the end of the intervention (if six
months or longer) and at any follow-up period. The intervention
period was six months in three trials (Lanigan 2010; Stark 2011;
Stark 2014), and 12 months in two trials (Quattrin 2012; Taveras
2011). The intervention was 16 weeks in one trial (Bocca 2012);
we did not include outcomes at this time point in this review.
Four trials reported outcomes at 12 months, in Bocca 2012, Stark
2011 and Stark 2014, or 18 months, in Quattrin 2012, from
baseline (six to eight months from end of intervention), and one
trial, Quattrin 2012, reported outcomes at 24 months (12 months
from end of intervention). Lanigan 2010 followed participants for
24 months, but data are not yet available. Bocca 2012 followed
participants for 36 months, but data at this time point were not
reported in a useable format.
The proportion of participants finishing the trial (or the longest
reported follow-up, if different) was less than 80% in four trials,
Bocca 2012, Lanigan 2010, Quattrin 2012, Stark 2014, out of
the six (Table 1), moreover there was a differential rate of losses
to follow-up between groups in three of these trials (Lanigan
2010; Quattrin 2012; Stark 2014). Attrition was highest in the
multicomponent intervention arms of Lanigan 2010 and Quattrin
2012, and the LAUNCH home visits arm of Stark 2014 (although
both intervention arms had higher attrition than the enhanced
usual care arm in this trial).
Primary outcomes
Changes in body mass index (BMI) and body weight
All six trials reported BMI z score (Bocca 2012; Lanigan 2010;
Quattrin2012; Stark2011; Stark2014; Taveras2011). Poolingthe

 studies in a random-effects meta-analyses (Analysis 1.1) demon-
strated a reduction in BMI z score in the intervention groups com-
pared with controls at the end of intervention: mean difference
(MD) -0.26 units (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to -0.16);
P < 0.00001; 210 participants; 4 trials; low-quality evidence). At
12 to 18 months’ follow-up, the MD was -0.38 units (95% CI -
0.58 to -0.19); P = 0.0001; 202 participants; 4 trials; low-qual-
ity evidence). One trial, Quattrin 2012, reported outcomes at 24
months’ follow-up (12 months’ postintervention) and found the
benefit was maintained (MD -0.25 units (95% CI -0.40 to -0.10)).
One cluster RCT comparing intervention with control reported
a change in BMI z score from baseline to one year of 0.05 units
(95% CI -0.14 to 0.04); P = 0.28 (Taveras 2011).
Three trials reported BMI at the end of intervention or postinter-
vention: Lanigan 2010 showed a MD of -0.40 kg/m² (95% CI -
0.85 to 0.05) in 64 participants, and the cluster RCT by Taveras
2011 an adjusted (child age, sex, ethnicity, parent education, over-
weight/obesity status at baseline, household income, time elapsed
from baseline to follow-up) MD of -0.21 kg/m² (95% CI -0.50 to
0.07) in 445 participants. Eight months’ postintervention, Bocca
2012 reported a MD of -1.00 kg/m² (95% CI -1.79 to -0.21) in
57 participants (Analysis 1.2).
Three of the trials reporting BMI z score also reported additional
BMI variables, including changes in percent over BMI (Analysis
1.3) and BMI percentile (Analysis 1.4), which reflected the results
in BMI z score.
Five trials reported change in body weight (Bocca 2012; Lanigan
2010; Quattrin 2012; Stark 2011; Stark 2014) (Analysis 1.5).
Pooling the trials in a random-effects meta-analysis showed less
weight gain with the interventions compared with control at the
end of the intervention: MD -1.18 kg (95% CI -1.91 to -0.45); P
= 0.001; 210 participants; 4 trials; low-quality evidence) and at 12
to 18 months’ follow-up: MD -2.81 kg (95% CI -4.39 to -1.22);
P = 0.0005; 202 participants; 4 trials; low-quality evidence).
One trial, Quattrin 2012, reported change in body weight at 24
months’ follow-up (12 months’ postintervention) and found the
benefit was maintained: MD -1.60 kg (95% CI -2.42 to -0.78); 96
participants). Follow-up was low (58%) in the intervention arm
of this trial.
Three trials reported change in parental BMI or weight (Quattrin
2012; Stark 2011; Stark 2014); these trials required the parent to
have a BMI of least 25 or 27 for trial inclusion. Pooling the tri-
als in a meta-analysis demonstrated a reduction in parental BMI
in the intervention group compared with controls at the end of
intervention (6 or 12 months) (MD -2.00 kg/m² (95% CI -2.52
to -1.48); P < 0.00001; 113 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evi-
dence) and at 12 to 18 months’ follow-up (MD -2.08 kg/m² (95%
CI -2.65 to -1.51); P < 0.00001; 112 participants; 2 trials; low-
quality evidence). Quattrin 2012 also reported outcomes at 24
months’ follow-up, where the effect remained stable (MD -2.00
kg/m² (95% CI -2.57 to -1.43); 96 participants) (Analysis 1.6).
The effecton parental body weight was similar (Analysis 1.7), with
parents in the intervention group reducing weight by around 5 kg
more than the control group at the end of the intervention (MD
-4.69 kg (95% CI -7.27 to -2.11); P = 0.0004; 146 participants;
3 trials; low-quality evidence) and at 12 to 18 months’ follow-up
(MD -5.14 kg (95% CI -8.96 to -1.33); P = 0.008; 49 participants;
2 trials; low-quality evidence). Only one trial reported outcomes at
24 months’ follow-up (Quattrin 2012), where the effects remained
(MD -6.70 kg (95% CI -8.42 to -4.98)).
Adverse events
Only one trial reported, as an abstract only, on adverse events
(Lanigan 2010), stating that no adverse events were observed (
Appendix 8). Further details, such as how adverse events were
monitored, were not provided.
Secondary outcomes
Health-related quality of life and self esteem
Three trials reported health-related quality of life (Bocca 2012;
Stark 2011; Stark 2014), but measures and scores used varied be-
tween trials (Appendix 11). Bocca 2012 reported two tools, the
Dutch Child AZL TNO Quality-of-Life (DUX-25), which mea-
sures daily activities, and the Dutch edition of the Child Health
Questionnaire Parent Form (CHQ-PF50), which measures health
perception. At 12 months’ follow-up (eight months postinterven-
tion), a statistically significant higher increase was found in 40
participants in the multidisciplinary intervention group compared
with the usual care group in the DUX-25 total score (change in
median of the total score: +5 in the intervention group versus -5
in the control group; 0 to 100 scale with higher scores indicating
better health-related quality of life) and in one of four domains
(physical score; change in median: +8 in the intervention group
versus -4 in the control group; with higher scores indicating bet-
ter health-related quality of life), but no substantial differences
were found in any of the 15 items on the CHQ-PF50 (Analysis
1.8; Analysis 1.9). Parents of 50% to 57% of randomised children
completed questionnaires.
Stark 2011 reported the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Ped-
sQL) Generic Core scales, using the total score and the physical
functioning, emotional functioning, and social functioning sub-
scales, however only data for physical functioning were reported.
A statistically significant improvement (higher scores indicate bet-
ter quality of life) in the change in health-related quality of life
in physical functioning was found at the end of intervention (six
months, mean +9.5 units in the intervention group versus -1.7
units in the control group) and at 12 months’ follow-up (mean

 +13.8 units in the intervention group versus -2.7 units in the con-
trol group) (Analysis 1.10).
Stark 2014 used the parent version of the PedsQL (total score)
and found no substantial differences between multicomponent
interventions and control in the total score (Analysis 1.11).
No trials measured self esteem.
All-cause mortality
Not reported.
Morbidity
Not reported.
Anthropometric measures other than BMI
One trial reported waist circumference at the end of the six-month
intervention (Lanigan 2010) (Analysis 1.12), and one trial re-
ported a number of anthropometric measures at 12 months’ fol-
low-up (eight months after intervention end) (Bocca 2012), in-
cluding waist circumference (Analysis 1.12), waist circumference
z score (Analysis 1.13), hip circumference (Analysis 1.14), hip
circumference z score (Analysis 1.15), upper arm circumference
(Analysis 1.16), per cent body fat (Analysis 1.17), fat-free mass
(Analysis 1.18), visceral fat (Analysis 1.19), and subcutaneous fat
(Analysis 1.20). Although these outcomes tended to favour the in-
tervention, differences were only statistically significant for upper
arm circumference and visceral fat. Caution is required in the in-
terpretation of these results due to the number of outcomes mea-
sured.
Behaviour change
Four trials reported some form of assessment of behaviour change
(Bocca 2012; Stark 2011; Stark 2014; Taveras 2011).
Four trials measured physical activity, however different methods
and outcomes were used (Appendix 7). Taveras 2011 found no
substantial difference in change in number of hours per day of
outdoor active playtime at the end of intervention (Analysis 1.21),
and Bocca 2012 found no substantial difference in change in num-
ber of steps per day at 12 months’ follow-up (Analysis 1.22) Of the
two trials evaluating LAUNCH (Stark 2011; Stark 2014), both
reported change in average daily minutes of moderate and vig-
orous physical activity (Analysis 1.23; Analysis 1.24). Stark 2011
found no substantial difference in physical activity, and although
data from Stark 2014 suggest a statistically significant effect in the
LAUNCH clinic only group compared with control at 12 months’
follow-up, this result should be viewed with caution as the treat-
ment effect was not statistically significant when computed using
maximum likelihood estimation to account for missing data by
Stark 2014.
One cluster RCT, Taveras 2011, reported a greater reduction in
the number of servings per day of sugar-sweetened drinks (MD
-0.26 (95% CI -0.49 to -0.03); Analysis 1.25), but this was not
statistically significant in an adjusted analysis (MD -0.22 (95%
CI -0.52 to 0.08)). Similarly, there was no substantial difference
in the increase in servings per day of fruits and vegetables (MD
0.06 (95% CI -0.21 to 0.33); Analysis 1.26), adjusted analysis:
MD 0.12 (95% CI -0.17 to 0.42). However, we found a statis-
tically significant difference in the reduction in hours per day of
television and video viewing: MD -0.46 hrs (95% CI -0.70 to -
0.22); Analysis 1.27), adjusted analysis: MD -0.36 hrs (95% CI -
0.64 to -0.09). Analyses were adjusted for child age, sex, and race/
ethnicity; parent education and overweight/obesity status at base-
line; household income; and exact time elapsed from baseline to
follow-up visit.
Participant views of the intervention
Two trials reported the participants’ views of the interventions.
Taveras 2011 reported that 97% were “somewhat” or “very satis-
fied” with the High Five for Kids program, and that 91% would
recommend the program to their family and friends. Using the
Barrier to Treatment Participation Scale questionnaire, Stark 2011
reported no statistically significant difference between LAUNCH
and comparator (paediatric counselling) on parent perceptions of
treatment demands (11 for both groups) or relevance of treatment
(11.3 versus 10.6, respectively). Parents in LAUNCH reported
significantly greater stressors and obstacles compared to parents
in the comparator group (33 ± 8.2 versus 25.6 ± 4.7, P = 0.038).
Parents in LAUNCH and comparator were highly satisfied with
treatment and did not differ substantially in their satisfaction rat-
ings for information on nutrition (4.86 ± .38 versus 4.30 ± 1.25,
P > 0.05) or physical activity (4.71 ± .49 versus 4.00 ± 1.25, P >
0.05), or in their satisfaction with ability to make recommended
changes (4.26 ± .49 versus 4.20 ± 1.23, P > 0.05).
Parent-child relationship or assessment of parenting
Two trials reported the Child Feeding Questionnaire (CFQ), a self
report measure to assess parental beliefs, attitudes, and practices
regarding child feeding (Stark 2011; Stark 2014) (Appendix 7).
However, the trial authors report limited data. The CFQ contains
31 items, loading on seven factors. Four items relate to parental
perception of child and parent weight, and concern about weight,
which may elicit parental control in feeding. Pressure to eat scores
were reduced by 0.9 and 0.6 at six months and by 0.6 and 0.3 at 12
months in the intervention and control groups, respectively (Stark
2011). Restriction to eat was described as “stable at approximately
4” with no statistically significant differences. Stark 2014 state
“from baseline to months 6 and 12, CFQ restriction and pressure
to eat remained relatively low (< 2.3) across all time points with
no significant changes between groups”.

 Socioeconomic effects
No trials reported socioeconomic effects.
Diet interventions versus control
One three-arm trial compared two diets (dairy rich and energy
restricted) plus healthy lifestyle education with health lifestyle
education alone (Kelishadi 2009). The intervention was of six
months’ duration, and follow-up was three years from baseline,
with 90.1%, 77.5%, and 90% follow-up in the dairy-rich, energy-
restricted, and control groups, respectively. We judged the trial to
have a high risk of selective outcome bias and an unclear risk of se-
lection bias, performance bias, detection bias, and other bias. The
reported standard deviations appear very small and could possibly
be standard errors.
Primary outcomes
Changes in body mass index (BMI) and body weight
For change in BMI z score, see Analysis 2.1. At the end of the
intervention, BMI z score was reduced in all groups, however the
reduction was greater with both the dairy-rich diet (MD -0.10
units (95% CI -0.11 to -0.09)) and energy-restricted diet (MD
units -0.10 (95% CI -0.11 to -0.09)) than with control. At 12,
24, and 36 months’ follow-up, the difference between the dairy-
rich diet and control increased (MD units -0.20 (95% CI -0.21
to -0.19); MD -0.60 units (95% CI -0.61 to -0.59); MD -0.70
units (95% CI -0.71 to -0.69), respectively). In contrast, at 12
months’ follow-up, the MD between the energy-restricted diet and
control was 0.00 units (95% CI -0.01 to 0.01), and at 24 and 36
months’ follow-up, the outcome favoured control (MD 0.10 units
(95% CI 0.09 to 0.11); MD units 0.10 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.11),
respectively).

Anthropometric measures other than BMI
Reductions in waist circumference were greater with both the
dairy-rich (MD -0.30 cm (95% CI -0.39 to -0.21)) and energy-
restricted diet (MD -0.80 cm (95% CI -0.91 to -0.69)) at the end
of the intervention (Analysis 2.2). At three years’ follow-up, only
the dairy-rich diet remained better on waist circumference than
control (MD -0.70 cm (95% CI -0.84 to -0.56)), while the en-
ergy-restricted diet had a worse outcome than the control group
(MD 0.40 cm (95% CI 0.23 to 0.57)).
The dairy-rich diet group had a greater reduction in percentage
body fat than control at the end of the intervention (MD -2.00%
(95% CI -2.18 to -1.82)), but this was not maintained at 24
months’ follow-up (Analysis 2.3). There were no substantial dif-
ferences in percentage body fat between the energy-restricted diet
and control at either time point. Data at three years’ follow-up
were not reported for this outcome.
Behaviour change
Kelishadi 2009 stated that “mean daily energy expenditure did not
differ significantly by group at each time period throughout the
study”, however data were presented in a figure only and could
not be accurately estimated by review authors.
Participant views of the intervention
Participant views were not reported.

Socioeconomic effects
Socioeconomic effects were not reported.
Subgroup analyses
We did not perform subgroups analyses because there were not
enough trials to estimate effects in various subgroups.
Sensitivity analyses
We did not perform any sensitivity analyses because there were
not enough trials included in the analyses.

a’’A BMI z score or standard deviation score indicates how many units (of the standard deviation) a child’s BMI is above or
below the average BMI value for their age group and sex. For instance, a z score of 1.5 indicates that a child is 1.5 standard

Summary of main results
This systematic review summarised seven RCTs examining the
effect of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for
treating overweight and obesity in preschool children up to the age
of 6 years. We only included trials with at least a six-month out-
come assessment, with the aim of assessing the longer-term effects
of these interventions. Interventions and comparators varied be-
tween the included trials, and we divided the trials into two main
groups to ease interpretation: multicomponent interventions and
diet-only interventions. Outcomes assessed also varied between
trials; the most commonly reported measure was BMI z score, but
one trial reported BMI only. To allow comparison across trials,
we analysed outcome data at the end of the intervention (whether
this was 6 or 12 months) and at each reported follow-up period.
Four trials had an unclear risk of selection bias, and most had an
unclear or high risk of performance bias. All but two trials had a
high risk of selective reporting bias.
Overall, multicomponent interventions were more successful than
the comparators in reducing BMI and body weight in preschool
children and their parents, and the effects were maintained two
years after the start of the intervention. Improvements were found
in some, but not all, aspects of health-related quality of life. The
trials measured behaviour change inconsistently, and the effects of
the interventions were more equivocal. There was limited assess-
ment of participant views, parent-child relationship, or assessment
of parenting; where these were reported, there was no difference
between groups. Only one trial commented on adverse events,
stating that none were reported.
One three-arm trial found that both the dairy-rich and energy-
restricted dietary interventions resulted in greater reduction in
BMI than the comparator at the end of the intervention period,
but only the dairy-rich diet maintained this at 12 to 36 months’
follow-up. Limited assessment was made of behaviour change;
mean daily energy expenditure did not differ substantially between
groups. Health-related quality of life, adverse effects, participant
views, and parenting were not measured.
A number of outcomes such as all-cause mortality, morbidity, self
esteem, and socioeconomic effects were not measured by any of
the included trials.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
This review identified just seven trials assessing the effects of diet,
physical activity, and behavioural interventions at six months or
longer.
Six trials included multicomponent interventions. One of these
trials had not yet fully reported at the time of writing, but will
be included in the next review update. The duration of the inter-
ventions and length of follow-up varied slightly between these tri-
als, with most reporting outcomes at 12 to 18 months’ follow-up.
Only one trial reported outcomes at two years’ follow-up. Long-
term effects of the interventions therefore remain uncertain.
One trial included two different diet interventions. The dairy-
rich diet was high in curd and dough, which are traditional dairy
products prepared and consumed in Iran, and may not be relevant
to other countries. The benefits of the dairy-rich diet found in this
trial would need to be confirmed in other trials.
Few of the trials reported secondary outcomes of interest to the
review, and where these were reported there was little agreement
in the types of measures used, making comparison difficult.
Results to date indicate that the magnitude of change in BMI z
score with multicomponent interventions is likely to be clinically
significant at all follow-up periods. Available data in adolescents
show that a change of 0.25 or more is associated with improve-
ments in adiposity and metabolic health, with larger changes elic-
iting greater benefits (Ford 2010). Though the populations are
not directly comparable, this nevertheless gives some indication
of clinical relevance.
Quality of the evidence
Overall, the quality of the evidence was low, with six of seven
included trials judged to have a high risk of bias on individual
’Risk of bias’ criteria, and only three trials having a low risk of
selection bias. GRADE assessments of the outcomes in this review
led to trials being downgraded for risk of bias and also imprecision
owing to the small number of trials and small sample sizes. This
makes overall interpretation of the data difficult.
Potential biases in the review process
We carried out a comprehensive search across major databases for
interventions for childhood overweight and obesity for this review.
In addition, we screened the reference lists of systematic reviews.
Each included trial in the review was comprehensively selected,
assessed, data extracted, and quality assessed by two review au-
thors to minimise potential biases in the review process. We made
no decisions about the analysis or investigation of heterogeneity
after seeing the data. There were differences between the trials in
both the interventions delivered and the comparators. We divided
the comparisons in this review into two groups, multicomponent
interventions and dietary interventions, in order to improve com-
parability of trials within groups. We made this decision after ex-
amination of trial characteristics of included trials, but before we
viewed the data. Where relevant data were missing, either to allow
assessment of eligibility or at the data extraction stage, the review
authors contacted the trial authors for further information.

 Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Previoussystematicreviewsidentifiedanabsence of RCTsassessing
interventions for treating overweight or obesity in preschool-aged
children (Bluford 2007; Bond 2009; Bond 2011; Oude Luttikhuis
2009). Since these reviews were undertaken, seven trials have been
published and four trials are still ongoing. The current review
is the first to synthesise the most up-to-date and highest-quality
research available on the effectiveness of interventions for treating
overweight or obesity in preschool-aged children.

C O N C L U S I O N S
Implications for practice
Multicomponent interventions appear to be an effective treatment
option for overweight or obese preschool children up to the age
of 6 years. However, the current evidence is limited, and the trials
had a high risk of bias. Most of the trials did not measure adverse
events.
The role of dietary interventions is more equivocal, with one trial
suggesting that dairy interventions may be effective in the longer
term, but not energy-restricted diets. Again, this trial had a high
risk of bias.
Implications for research
The systematic review identified four ongoing trials of multicom-
ponent interventions, which will contribute data to the results of
an updated review. These trials will improve the robustness of the
results for multicomponent interventions. Further research is re-
quired to determine whether the interventions have any adverse
effects. Further research is also needed into the effects of different
diet-only interventions.

Methods
Parallel randomised controlled clinical trial
Randomisation ratio: 1:1:1
Superiority design
Participants
Inclusion criteria: age 2 to 5 years; ≥ 95th percentile BMI but < 100% above the mean
BMI; 1 parent with a BMI ≥ 25; medical clearance from paediatrician
Exclusion criteria: non-English speaking; living ≥ 50 miles from the medical centre;
disability or illness that would interfere with moderate physical activity; medical condi-
tion/medication associated with weight gain; enrolled in a weight control program
Diagnostic criteria: as above
Interventions
Number of study centres: 1
Treatment before study: -
Description of the interventions (Learning about Activity and Understanding
Nutrition for Child Health (LAUNCH):
LAUNCH home visits: 18-session manualised, aim for small decreases or stabilise the
rate of weight gain, consistent with current recommendations (reference given). 2 phases
to the 6-month intervention: (1) Intensive intervention, 12 weekly 90-minute sessions,
alternating between group-based clinic sessions (parent and child concurrent groups)
, and individual home visits, targeted lifestyle behaviour modification and improving
parenting skills. Parent sessions: psychologist led, education on diet (Weeks 2 to 7)
, physical activity (Weeks 8 to 12), and parenting skills, provided with vegetables at
each session for daily taste tests (14 days) between sessions. Child groups, paediatric
psychologist and research coordinator, topics paralleled the parent group and focused on
education about healthy eating, opportunities to try new foods and engage in physical
activity. Home sessions (60 to 90 minutes) to support generalisation of clinic-taught
skills to the home environment including a “home clean-out” where high-calorie, low-
nutrient foods and beverages were either removed or a plan for eating them in moderation
agreed; (2) Maintenance, 12 weeks of every-other-week sessions, alternating between
group clinic, and individual home sessions, long-term planning, problem-solving around
individual barriers, and use of parenting skills
LAUNCH clinic visits: identical to LAUNCH home except home visits, instead par-
ents were provided a “home clean-out” box to use on their own to eliminate high-calo-
rie, low-nutrient foods from the home. Enhanced standard of care: paediatrician led,
manualised, based on dietary and physical activity recommendations from American
Academy of Pediatrics. One 45-min visit to explain BMI, BMI percentiles, and to review
the child’s growth chart. Modelled on published recommendations for screen time ≤ 2 h
daily; active play ≥ 60 min daily; eliminating soda and ≤ 4 ounces juice daily; fruits and
vegetables ≥ 5 servings daily; limiting eating out; appropriate portion sizes for preschool-
ers. Given a 1-page healthy food and activity brochure created by the Collaboration for
Healthy Ohio. All were reimbursed USD 50 for completing each assessment

Information control: 13 60-minute sessions over 12 months (4 weekly, 2 bimonthly, 4
monthly, and 3 at 8- to 10-week intervals) followed by a 12-month follow-up (3 meetings
at month 16, 20, and 24). Delivered to parents by same leader, content included dietary/
physical and sedentary activities education. Recommendations for calorie intake, portion
size, weight loss, and physical activity goals. Trained staff engaged the children in active
games. Parents received 10 phone calls between meetings by a coach and 3 times in the
follow-up period
Family-based weight control intervention: all aspects of information control described
above. In addition, parenting and behavioural intervention, provided strategies to pro-
mote behaviour change, including parenting-related techniques (selective ignoring, time
out, praising, rewarding, contracting) and changing parental behaviour to facilitate par-
ent and child change (preplanning, stimulus control, shaping, modelling, self monitor-
ing, changing the home environment, social support, changing black-and-white think-
ing). Before or after the group sessions parents attended a 1:1 meeting with an assigned
coach who assisted the parents in shaping behavioural goals. Parents completed icon-
based diaries that allowed for shaping of goals by changing the number of icons on the
page. Parents were asked to weigh themselves and child twice a week. Group leaders and
coaches were closely supervised by investigators

Description of interventions:
Multidisciplinary intervention: children and parents received dietary advice, physical
activity sessions, and, for parents only, psychological counselling. Dietary advice was 6 x
30-minute sessions with dietitian, advised normocaloric diet based on the required daily
intake for this age group, education and advice to improve eating behaviour, personal
goals set with feedback on consecutive sessions. Physical activity was 12 x 60-minute
group sessions supervised by a physiotherapist; exercise programme focused on an active
lifestyle and mimicked the type and intensity of habitual elementary school exercise (e.g.
ball playing and dancing to music). Advised to reduced sedentary activities and parents
asked to stimulate their child’s physical activity to achieve daily physical activity of at
least 60 minutes. Behavioural therapy for parents was 6 x 120-minute group sessions
guided by psychologist, focus on being a health role mode, working with feasible goals
and healthy rewards, change family attitudes towards healthy eating and physical activity.
Total of 25 sessions (30 hours) in 16 weeks
Usual care: children and parents seen by a paediatrician 3 times for 30 to 60 mins each
over 16 weeks. Given information on healthy-eating behaviours, advised physical activity
1 hour per day, children advised to play outside every day, walk or bike to school, ≤ 2
hours/day screen time

Bocca 2011 is an abstract that reports 12-month end values (SD). However, these differ
from the change values reported in the full publication (Bocca 2012), therefore only the
latter data have been extracted
Bocca 2014 reports 3-year follow-up but only presents difference between groups. These

Description of interventions:
High Five for Kids: primary care behavioural change obesity intervention. Based on the
chronic care model, which involved changes to the healthcare system through training of
staff and enhancing of electronic record systems. Delivery to participants by paediatric
nurse practitioners who used tailored motivational interviewing for four 25-minute, in-
person chronic disease management visits and three 15-minute telephone calls in the first
year of the intervention (intensive intervention period). Educational modules targeting
television viewing and fast-food and sugar-sweetened beverage intake that were matched
to a family’s stage of readiness to change; printed and electronic tools for self management
support; lists of local resources for physical activity; and an interactive website with
educational materials, recipes, and other features were used. Small incentives such as
water bottles, books, and snack containers. In addition, interested families were offered
an electronic television monitoring device to assist with the goal of reducing television
viewing. Behavioural goals (’High Five’): (1) < 1 hour television (TV)/video per day,
no TV in child’s room, (2) ≤ 1 serving of fast-food per week, (3) ≤ 1 serving sugar-
sweetened beverages, (4) ≥ 5 servings fruits and vegetables per day, (5) active play at
least 1 hour per day
Followed by a less intensive maintenance period (no further details)
Usual care control: well-child care visits and follow-up appointments for weight checks
with their paediatrician or a subspecialist (e.g. nutritionist)
All participants received USD 20 for completing each telephone interview to collect
outcome data. Intervention participants reimbursed for copay incurred at each visit with
the nurse practitioners

for Child Health (LAUNCH):
Phase 1 (intensive intervention): 12 weekly sessions alternating between group-based
clinic sessions (parent and child concurrent groups) and individual home visits. Parent-
group clinic sessions (90 min each) addressed dietary education, physical activity, and
parenting skills including behavioural control strategies such as stimulus control. Goals
for calories, screen time, and physical activity set. Pedometer and diet diary data were
used as feedback tools. Given 14-day supply of vegetables at clinic sessions. Delivered by
a psychologist. Children were seen concurrently in a group format. Received nutrition
education through games and art activities, tried new foods during a structured meal,
and completed 15 min of moderate to vigorous activity. In-home sessions (60 to 90
min each) were designed to support generalisation of the clinic-taught skills to the home
environment

group sessions in clinic and home sessions. Focused on helping families continue to make
or maintain changes in eating and activity by identifying barriers and problem-solving
with the families on using strategies taught during phase 1 to address these barriers
Control (enhanced standard of care): Paediatric counselling to deliver dietary and physi-
cal activity recommendations outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics. One 45-

Methods
Type of study: interventional
Allocation: randomised
Intervention model: parallel
Masking: open label
Primary purpose: treatment
Participants
Condition: overweight, obese
Enrolment: estimated 240 (160 overweight, 80 obese)
Inclusion criteria: children aged 4 to 6 years with overweight and obesity
Exclusion criteria: do not understand written and spoken Swedish well enough to participate in group
activities
Interventions
Intervention(s):
All start with a 2-hour lecture with general facts about overweight in children (GFO), performed by health
professionals. Also access to a website, Healthy Children (HC), with general information about diet and
exercise recommendations
Obese children randomised to either:
1) Better balance everyday - parenthood and lifestyle (BBE), run by a clinical psychologist, parents attend
six 2-hour sessions over 12 months
2) Lighter Living (LiLi), run by an occupational therapist, based on the theory that alterations in the
parents’ everyday life will induce changes that will gradually lead to a normalisation of their children’s
weight. Groups meet for 13 2-hour sessions over 12 months
Overweight children randomised to 1 of 3 groups:
1) BBE as above
2) Website only: information on health food and physical activity, based on national guidelines and recom-
mendations for preschool children whether overweight or not; parents can ask questions to paediatrician,
a dietitian, a psychologist, or an occupational therapist
3) Control (general lecture only)

aQuestions on risk of bias are answered in relation to the majority of the aggregated evidence in the meta-analysis rather than to
individual trials.
bQuestions on inconsistency are primarily based on visual assessment of forest plots, and the statistical quantification of heterogeneity
is based on I²
cWhen judging the width of the confidence interval, it is recommended to use a clinical decision threshold to assess whether the
imprecision is clinically meaningful.
dQuestions address comprehensiveness of the search strategy, industry influence, funnel plot asymmetry, and discrepancies between
published and unpublished trials.

New citation required and conclusions have changed
This review concludes that combined behavioural
lifestyle interventions compared to standard care or self
help can produce a significant and clinically meaningful
reduction in overweight in children and adolescents
The search was updated to May 2008. Some amend-
ments were made to update the search strategies. No
changes have been made to other aspects of the method-
ology. We have included 46 new studies, among which
contained information on drug interventions for treat-
ing obesity in adolescents. The added evidence suggests
that lifestyle interventions appear to have positive effects

more, orlistat and sibutramine were found to have bene-
ficial effects on adiposity in obese adolescents. However,
a range of adverse effects were noted

Given the rapid growth in the treatment of child and adolescent obesity, the original review has now been split into six separate reviews,
with a specific intervention and age focus.
1. Diet, physical activity. and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in adolescents aged 12 to 17
years.
2. Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in schoolchildren from the age of
6 to 11 years.
3. Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool children up to the
age of 6 years.
4. Drug interventions for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents.
5. Parent-only interventions for childhood overweight or obesity.
6. Surgery for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents.
For lifestyle interventions, we included only randomised controlled trials that were specifically designed to treat obesity in children
and observed participants for a minimum of six months. The rationale for introducing this criterion arose from the belief that many
interventions appear to be effective in the short term (up to three months), but not in the long term (Glenny 1997). It seemed to be
more important to evaluate the longer-term effects of treatments, as this would provide a more valuable indication of effectiveness,
given the chronic nature of obesity.
