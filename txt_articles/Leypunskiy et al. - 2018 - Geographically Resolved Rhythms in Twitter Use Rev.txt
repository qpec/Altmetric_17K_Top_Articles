In Brief
The discrepancy between sleep patterns
on free days and work days is called
‘‘social jet lag’’ and is linked to multiple
health problems. Leypunskiy et al. show
that spatially resolved records of social
media use in the US can be used to detect
social jet lag, determine how it varies
seasonally, and discover geographical
and lifestyle risk factors.

SUMMARY
Daily rhythms in human physiology and behavior are
driven by the interplay of circadian rhythms, environ-
mental cycles, and social schedules. Much research
has focused on the mechanism and function of circa-
dian rhythms in constant conditions or in idealized
light-dark environments. There have been compara-
tively few studies into how social pressures, such as
work and school schedules, affect human activity
rhythms day to day and season to season. To address
this issue, we analyzedactivityon Twitter in >1,500 US
counties throughout the 2012–2013 calendar years in
15-min intervals using geographically tagged tweets
representing z0.1% of the total population each
day. We find that sustained periods of low Twitter ac-
tivity are correlated with sufficient sleep as measured
by conventional surveys. We show that this nighttime
lull in Twitter activity is shifted to later times on week-
ends relative to weekdays, a phenomenon we term
‘‘Twitter social jet lag.’’ The magnitude of this social
jet lag varies seasonally and geographically—with
the West Coast experiencing less Twitter social jet
lag compared to the Central and Eastern US—and is
correlated with average commuting schedules and
disease risk factors such as obesity. Most counties
experience the largest amount of Twitter social jet
lag in February and the lowest in June or July. We pre-
sent evidence that these shifts in weekday activity
coincide with relaxed social pressures due to local
K-12 school holidays and that the direct seasonal ef-
fect of altered day length is comparatively weaker.
INTRODUCTION
Daily rhythms of activity and rest in human life are familiar to all of
us, and there is a growing body of evidence indicating that dis-
rupting this pattern has severe consequences for health [1, 2].
Despite its importance, it is poorly understood how daily activity
varies geographically and seasonally. Further, it is unclear what
role biological clocks and social constraints have in determining
geographical variation in activity [3]. Circadian clocks provide an
innate pressure to sleep at night and be active during the day, but
our internal rhythms can be at odds with the timing of social ob-
ligations, such as work and school. Indeed, studies suggest
that when people deliberately spend time without alarm clocks
or electric lights, their sleep-wake rhythms shift to align to sunrise
and sunset[4, 5]. In non-industrialized societies without accessto
electricity, activity is similarly timed according to availability of
daylight [6, 7]. However, in a modern society where food, enter-
tainment, and social interaction are available around the clock,
many people live out of synchrony with the day-night cycle [8, 9].
To quantify how social pressures disrupt the natural activity
patterns of humans, Roenneberg and colleagues introduced
the concept of ‘‘social jet lag,’’ defined as the difference between
the midpoints of sleep on work and free days [10]. Extensive sur-
veys of sleep timing in Central Europe have revealed that almost
70% of respondents experience over 1 hr of social jet lag, and
nearly a third experience over 2 hr, suggesting that our internal
rhythms are forced to constantly readjust to shifting social de-
mands [11]. People employed on evening, night, or rotating
shifts, who currently comprise roughly 20% of workers [12, 13],
contend with the most extreme social jet lag [14].
The widespread mismatch between sleep timing on work and
free days appears to have negative consequences for human
health [15, 16]. Social jet lag has been shown to correlate with
smoking, consumption of alcohol and caffeine [2, 10, 11, 17],
and mood disorders [18, 19]. Additionally, social jet lag has
been implicated as a risk factor for metabolic dysfunction and
obesity [20–22], and it is thought to lower academic performance
[23–25]. Some of these effects may be exacerbated in ‘‘night
owls,’’ for whom social jet lag goes hand in hand with chronic
sleep debt accumulated during the workweek [1].
Given the mounting evidence of the negative effects of social
jet lag on human health and performance, it is important to gain a
systematic understanding of how social jet lag varies with social
and geographic factors. It is not known how the amount of social

 jet lag varies from region to region, and whether cultural factors
play a role independently of latitude and longitude. The extent of
seasonal variation in social jet lag and, more generally, in the
timing of daily rhythms of human activity is also poorly
understood.
To gain a complete picture of the diversity of human activity
rhythms and to uncover possible demographic and environ-
mental correlates, it is necessary to collect data on natural activ-
ity patterns of populations with different cultural norms, in
different locations, and at different times of year [3, 26]. The
advent of mobile devices and wearable activity trackers is
enabling collection of unprecedented amounts of data on human
behavior in situ, surpassing the geographic reach and temporal
resolution typically achieved with surveys [26–30]. In particular,
records of Twitter use provide spatial and temporal information
about interactions among hundreds of millions of people
[30, 31]. These data present new opportunities for characterizing
activity rhythms, and several studies have analyzed Twitter activ-
ity for this purpose [32–35]. One such study concluded that a
single user’s Twitter activity record can be used to infer sleep-
wake patterns [32]; another found evidence of social jet lag in
German-speaking users [33]. Studies that mine the contents of
tweets have detected diurnal and seasonal changes in mood,
suggesting that Twitter can be a powerful tool to study rhythms
in emotional well-being [34, 35].
In this work, we study daily rhythms in Twitter activity in
approximately half of US counties during 2012–2013, monitoring
the average activity of z0.1% of the population every day
county by county. This dataset provides us with a unique oppor-
tunity to understand how 24-hr activity patterns vary geograph-
ically across the United States, and to examine how daily
rhythms in Twitter usage correlate with county-level demo-
graphics. The ability to monitor how Twitter activity patterns
change season-to-season and county-by-county allows us to
separately assess the influences of the socially defined calendar
and changes in daylight hours throughout the year.
We focus on how daily rhythms in Twitter usage are affected
by four characteristics of US counties: (1) geographic coordi-
nates, (2) seasonal variation in sunrise and sunset (i.e., ‘‘solar cal-
endar’’), (3) school and federal holidays, (i.e., ‘‘social calendar’’),
and (4) demographic and socioeconomic factors that we
consider static throughout the year.
We find that each county has a unique temporal signature of
Twitter activity, with a peak in afternoon or evening hours and
a trough during nighttime. By separately studying activity pat-
terns on weekends and weekdays, we detect an analog of social
jet lag in this signal and analyze how it varies over the year. In
many US counties, shifts in weekday activity decrease Twitter
social jet lag during the summer break in the school calendar,
suggesting that this socially imposed calendar is a major factor
determining rhythms of human activity.
RESULTS
County-Level Records of Twitter Activity Report on the
Aggregate Daily Behavior of over 240,000 Users in over
1,500 US Counties
We analyzed all publicly visible geolocated tweets that were sent
in 2012–2013 by users in the United States. After applying a cut-
off to ensure a sufficient number of users per county, the final da-
taset contains, for each day on average, tweets from z246,000
Twitter users located in 1,521 counties spanning all 50 US states
and Washington, DC. The number of daily Twitter users in our
dataset from a given county is proportional to the county popu-
lation (Pearson r = 0.95, p value < 7e-15). Our dataset contains
tweets from 0.02%–0.4% of the population in every represented
county (Figure S1A). For comparison, this dataset captures
activity from as many individuals on every calendar day as the
total number of records in the MCTQ database to-date and
about half as many individuals as are interviewed annually in
the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey [3, 36].
To study daily patterns of activity on Twitter, we calculated a
normalized average over activity in each county, giving equal
weight to each user (Figure 1A). We refer to the resulting profile
as a ‘‘tweetogram,’’ by analogy with the traditional actograms
used to display logs of activity in laboratory studies, showing
the normalized pattern of activity in a US county [37].
Nighttime Periods of Low Twitter Activity Correspond to
Patterns of Sleep across the United States
In Figure 1B, we show an averaged tweetogram for Cook
County, IL, home to the city of Chicago. Twitter activity is lowest
at night, with a minimum around 4:30 a.m., increases to a local
maximum near lunchtime, then decreases to a local minimum
in late afternoon (z16 hr or 4 p.m.) near the end of conventional
workday [38]. Tweeting becomes more frequent in the evening
[38], then decreases again until the nighttime trough, consistent
with previous reports [39]. We focused our analysis on the
troughs of tweetograms because they are the most consistent
features across different counties. The trough position indicates
the time at which Twitter users in a county are most inactive. The
trough width reflects the typical interval over which users are
inactive, though it may also be affected by variability in sched-
ules between users. Tweetogram widths depend only weakly
on the prevalence of Twitter usage (Figure S1B), suggesting
that changes in width are not artifacts of sparse sampling.
The nighttime lull in activity likely represents the time period
when most users are asleep. To test this idea, we characterized
the positions and widths of the tweetogram troughs for all
counties in our dataset. When we marked the trough widths on
a map of the US (Figure 1C), we observed a striking geographic
dependence. The nighttime troughs of Twitter activity profiles
are widest on the West Coast and become progressively nar-
rower toward the Great Lakes and the Southeast of the US. Fig-
ure 1D shows four example counties that illustrate the broader
trend: the nighttime lull in Twitter activity in Orange County,
CA, is 5.5 hr wide, which is over 1 hr longer than in Suffolk
County, NY, in the Northeast (4.4 hr), and almost 2 hr longer
than in Wayne County, MI (3.6 hr) in the Midwest or in Lafayette
County, LA, in the Southeast (3.8 hr).
To check if the widths of the nighttime lulls in Twitter activity
correlate with patterns of sleep, we compared our calculations
with the county-level data on the prevalence of sufficient sleep
collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of
the United States (CDC) (Figure 1E) [36]. The correlation between
sleep survey data and tweetogram widths suggests that the
period of lowest activity on Twitter reflects regional sleep
patterns.

 Daily Rhythms of Activity on Twitter Exhibit Social Jet
Lag
Roenneberg and colleagues defined social jet lag for an individ-
ual as the difference in midsleep points between work days and
free days. To study an analog of this phenomenon in our aggre-
gated Twitter data, we defined ‘‘Twitter social jet lag’’ for a
county as the shift in trough positions between weekends and
weekdays based on our earlier observation that tweetogram
troughs are correlated with sleep statistics (Figure 1E). We
then calculated Twitter activity profiles averaged separately
over weekdays and weekends for each county in our dataset,
taking care to avoid major holidays in the work and school calen-
dar (Figure 2). Most counties have similar numbers of Twitter
users on weekends and weekdays. 96% of counties have a
change in user number of less than 15% between weekends
and weekdays (average of 4% increase on weekends). We find
that tweetogram troughs generally occur later on weekends
than weekdays, and weekend troughs are typically wider than
weekday troughs (average 22 min longer ± 0.9 min std error of
the mean). For example, in Lafayette County, LA, the trough of
the weekend tweetogram is shifted over 90 min later in the day
relative to the trough of the weekday tweetogram; the corre-
sponding shift in Orange County, CA, is only about 50 min (Fig-
ures 2A and 2B).

 The Magnitudes of Twitter Social Jet Lag across US
Counties Correlate with Geographic, Socioeconomic,
and Health Indicators
We calculated the average magnitude of Twitter social jet
lag for all US counties in our dataset (Figures 2C and 2D).
Twitter social jet lag has a unimodal distribution, with the
average county experiencing about 75 min of social jet lag
(Figure 2D), a value in good agreement with the average social
lag measured in Germany using sleep surveys [22]. However,
different parts of the United States show substantial variation,
with counties in Central and Eastern regions experienc-
ing higher Twitter social jet lag compared to those along the
West Coast (average 77 min for both Central and Eastern

time zone, ANOVA p value < 6e-8).
We sought to understand if social and
cultural factors exert pressures on social
jet lag independently of geography. First,
we compiled a set of 130 descriptors
capturing geographic, demographic, so-
cioeconomic, health, and religious char-
acteristics of US counties (Table S2).
One-way correlations of these predictors
with Twitter social jet lag allowed us to
estimate the importance of different cate-
gories of descriptors and suggested the
most predictive descriptor within each
category. For example, commuting pat-
terns are more strongly correlated with
Twitter social jet lag than employment
characteristics (Figure S2A). We manually
selected a subset of 22 descriptors to
include in a linear model of the magnitude of Twitter social jet
lag (Figures 2E and S2). Descriptors were included in the model
on the basis of preliminary observation of correlation with Twitter
social jet lag (e.g., proportion of students), previous reports of
correlation with social jet lag [18, 22], or if they captured basic
demographic trends (age, race, income, etc.) (Table S1).
We found a significant association (family-wise error rate < 0.1)
in the linear model for nine predictors describing geographic, de-
mographic and Twitter usage characteristics of US counties.
Calculation of the variance inflation factors for these predictors
indicates that they are linearly independent (Table S1). The
magnitude of Twitter social jet lag correlates with latitude and
longitude, supporting our qualitative observation that Twitter
3766
Current Biology 28, 3763–3775, December 3, 2018
 social jet lag tends to increase toward the East of the US. Twitter
social jet lag is also significantly correlated with the position of a
county in its time zone, perhaps owing to the later (in local time)
sunrises to the West.
Counties with older populations, greater proportions of col-
lege students, and later commute times experience lower Twitter
social jet lag, perhaps because these populations have more
flexibility to set their weekday schedules. Twitter social jet lag
also correlates with the incidence of obesity, in agreement with
previous findings [22], and with narrower tweetogram troughs
on weekdays, suggesting that sleep debt may influence Twitter
social jet lag in our sample (Figure 2E).
Because of the known importance of shift work in causing
circadian and sleep disruption [14, 40, 41], we investigated
whether daily patterns of Twitter use are related to the amount
of labor in a county outside of normal working hours. Using
data from the American Time Use Survey, we estimated the frac-
tion of work occurring outside of 8 a.m.–6 p.m [42, 43]. Indeed,
for a subset of 115 counties with sufficient numbers of survey re-
spondents, this shift work measure is negatively correlated with
average trough width (Pearson’s r = –0.27, p < 0.004) and posi-
tively correlated with Twitter social jet lag (r = 0.18, p < 0.05).
Taken together, these findings suggest that the variation in
Twitter social jet lag across the United States is due to both
geographic and lifestyle-related factors.
Seasonal Variation in Social Jet Lag Largely Reflects
Changes in Weekday Tweeting Rhythms
Since the concept of social jet lag was first defined over a
decade ago [10, 44], most studies have surveyed social jet lag
without regard to time of year. In many animal species, seasonal
variation in the environment is linked to dramatic annual changes
in behavior, including altered fertility and metabolism [45, 46].
For humans, external pressures on activity schedules, such as
work and school times, can also exhibit seasonal variation. We
therefore asked if social jet lag varies across the calendar year.
The answer to this question is important because it may uncover
factors that mitigate social jet lag. Because our database of
Twitter activity rhythms spans two calendar years, our dataset
affords an opportunity to examine seasonal variation in social
jet lag.
In many counties, tweetogram trough times vary substantially
during the year, with the largest change occurring on weekdays.
For an example of a location with high seasonal variability,
consider Wayne County, MI (Figures 3A–3C), where the time of
minimum Twitter activity on weekdays varies from z4:25 a.m.
in February–May to z5:35 a.m. in July and August; patterns of
weekend
activity
are
less
variable,
but
nonetheless
are
z45 min earlier in the spring than in the summer. As a result, so-
cial jet lag also exhibits pronounced seasonal variation: weekend
and weekday schedules are misaligned by almost 90 min in
February–March and September–October but are only sepa-
rated by 30 min in July–August (Figure 3D). Though monthly so-
cial jet lag curves in different counties show substantial variability
in magnitude, the broad pattern of lowest social jet lag in the
summer with a maximum in late winter or early autumn is general
(Figures 3D and S3 and Table S5). Because Twitter activity pat-
terns on weekdays generally show higher seasonal variability
than on weekends, seasonal variation in Twitter social jet lag is
primarily due to changes in weekday tweeting rhythms (Figures
3E and 3F).
Patterns of Seasonal Variation in Social Jet Lag Are
Associated with Distinct Geographic and Demographic
Characteristics
To identify counties with similar patterns of seasonal variation,
we clustered the mean-subtracted monthly social jet lag curves
(Figure 4A and Table S6). We analyzed the 943 counties with over
30 average daily users. Counties separated into three major clus-
ters, which differ both in the seasonal amplitude of Twitter social
jet lag and the month of the year when it reaches its minimum
(Figures 4A and 4C). Counties in the first (red) cluster show
similar levels of social jet lag year-round (53 min average ampli-
tude), whereas the other two clusters experience significantly
more seasonal variability (72 and 87 min average amplitudes in
clusters 2 and 3). The second (green) and third (blue) clusters
differ by the timing of the summer dip, which occurs in June-
July in the third (blue) cluster and in July–August in the second
(green) group of counties.
These cluster assignments appear to map onto coherent
geographic regions (Figure 4B). The first (red) cluster covers
much of the Southwest of the US, Hawaii, and Florida, in addition
to urban centers elsewhere in the US. The second (green) cluster
predominantly consists of counties in the North of the US (Fig-
ure 4D), whereas the third (blue) cluster appears frequently in
the Rust Belt and the South. Counties in Central United States
appear mixed between the first (red) and third (blue) clusters,
though the latter is enriched for counties further West in their
time zones (Figure S4).
Do patterns of seasonal changes in social jet lag group
counties into clusters with distinct demographic features? To
address this question, we performed a statistical analysis to
identify
socioeconomic
parameters
that
are
enriched
or
depleted in different clusters (Figure S4). Intriguingly, the first
(red) and third (blue) clusters exhibit opposite trends in several
categories of demographic descriptors. Consider the population
and political characteristics: whereas the first (red) cluster is
enriched in counties with high population, urban status, and a
tendency to vote Democratic, the third (blue) cluster is depleted
for these descriptors (Figure S4). These two clusters exhibit
opposite trends in commuting, occupational, health, and educa-
tional descriptors (Figure S4). These signatures are also evident
in the distributions of the socioeconomic predictors: among
the three clusters, the first (red) cluster begins commuting
latest in the day, has the largest prevalence of college stu-
dents, and lowest incidence of smoking and obesity, whereas
counties in the third (blue) cluster exhibit contrasting trends (Fig-
ure 4D). Along with the analysis in Figure 2, this suggests that
both a high mean level of Twitter social jet lag and high seasonal
variability are predictive of some health outcomes, such as
obesity.
Weekday Tweeting Schedules Are Shifted Later in the
Day during Federal and School Holidays
One of the most striking conclusions from the clustering analysis
in Figure 4 is that nearly all counties experience a drop in Twitter
social jet lag during the summer. One common reason for a
change of schedule during summer months is the school holiday.
Current Biology 28, 3763–3775, December 3, 2018
3767
 We reasoned that if individuals and families tied to the school
schedule set their weekday alarm clocks later during the summer
than the school year, this could lead to a large change in Twitter
social jet lag.
To test this proposal, we examined weekday Twitter activity in
select US counties with unified public-school calendars (Fig-
ure 5A and Table S7). When we marked the dates of important
holidays alongside changes in the timing of Twitter activity, we
observed that weekday tweeting schedules are consistently
shifted 1–2 hr later in the day during summer, spring, and winter
school holidays (Figures 5B–5D). Weekday troughs also occur
later during major public holidays, leading to ‘‘spikes’’ on
Thanksgiving, Memorial Day, and Columbus Day (Figures
5B–5D).
To test whether the onset of summer vacation plays a special
role in shifting weekday tweeting, we identified 19 counties
with unified public-school calendars and compared average
trough times 3 weeks just before the beginning of summer
vacation, the first 3 weeks of summer vacation, and, as a con-
trol, the next 3 weeks of the summer. Though these counties

 with unified calendars cannot be considered a random sample,
we nevertheless find that trough times shift by an average of
40 min immediately following the beginning of summer vacation
versus an average 8-min shift in the next block of three weeks
(p value = 1.8e-6, paired sample t-test). Evidently, the holiday
calendar plays an important role in setting the timing of week-
day Twitter usage. Notably, counties belonging to the second
(green) cluster, which generally experience a drop in social jet
lag later in the summer compared to other clusters, are pre-
dominantly in the North and Northeast of the US (Figures 4B
and S4), where schools conventionally have holiday breaks
from late June to early September, versus many schools in
the South, which traditionally end earlier [47]. Though the
school calendar appears predictive of the timing of the summer
shift in Twitter activity, the magnitude of this shift varies among
counties.

 Seasonal Variation in Twitter Activity Rhythms Is
Primarily Determined by Social Schedules
The pronounced effect of federal and school holidays on Twitter
social jet lag does not exclude the possibility that Twitter activity
is also affected by the daily pattern of dawn and dusk, as has
been suggested in the literature [48]. One way to address this
question is to study how rhythms of tweeting change with the
seasons. If patterns of tweeting are primarily influenced by the
sun, then the timing of Twitter activity might remain aligned to
dawn or dusk as their schedules change from season to season.
On the other hand, if tweeting schedules follow local (i.e., socially
defined) time, we would expect little seasonal variation in the
timing of Twitter activity.
To discriminate between these two scenarios, we plotted the
times of tweetogram troughs for weekdays and weekends, as
well as the average times of dawn and dusk over each month
throughout the 2013 calendar year (Figures S5 and 6). To quan-
tify the preference of Twitter rhythms to align to dawn, dusk, or
social cues, we computed how the time of minimum Twitter
activity scales with day length in a linear model of clock-environ-
ment coupling (Figure 6). In this model, the slope of the scaling
relationship describes whether Twitter activity patterns preferen-
tially align to social time (e.g., 9 a.m.; m = 0), sunrise (m z�0.4)
or sunset (m z0.6) (Figures 6A–6C) [49]. By separately analyzing
seasonal influences on weekend and weekday tweeting, we
quantify how the timing of sunrise and sunset affects the timing
of Twitter activity.
The weekend distribution of m is centered around 0, which
indicates that Twitter activity aligns to local (i.e., social) time
more closely than to dawn and dusk, even on Saturdays and
Sundays when social pressures are reduced (Figure 6C). Tweet-
ing rhythms on weekdays exhibit more seasonal variation and
appear to be influenced by changes in sunset times, particularly
at longer day lengths (Figures 6C and S5). However, this

 apparent dusk-tracking behavior is likely confounded by the
effects of student holidays, discussed in the previous section
(Figure S5). When holiday months are removed from the analysis,
the weekday distribution of m is instead centered near 0, much
like the weekend distribution (Figures 6D–6F).
Though there are some counties at the extremes of the distri-
butions in Figure 6C where Twitter activity tracks sunrise or sun-
set quite closely throughout the year, our analysis suggests that,
for the majority of US counties, timing of Twitter use is more
strongly affected by the social calendar. Yet even in these
counties where social pressures appear to dominate, as in Suf-
folk County, NY, traces of dawn-tracking (in shorter winter
months) and dusk-tracking (in the height of the summer)
behavior may be present on weekends (Figure S5).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we sought to obtain a geographically resolved,
quantitative portrait of human activity rhythms. We asked
whether Twitter activity patterns across the US are predomi-
nantly affected by social or solar factors, and whether differ-
ences between weekdays and weekends vary seasonally.
Though the dataset provides information only at the level of
counties rather than individual users, it nonetheless reveals
distinct temporal and geographical patterns of activity. While
Twitter activity profiles in all counties share common features,
including high activity in the afternoon or late evening and low
levels at night, an important conclusion from our analysis is
that there is broad diversity in the timing of Twitter activity across
the United States that is correlated with geography. In this sense,
different regions of the country are separated not only by space
and culture, but also by their use of time. Indeed, these factors
seem to be interdependent. Patterns of seasonal variability in
Twitter activity rhythms, for example, organize US counties
into clusters with distinct demographic, educational, socioeco-
nomic, and political characteristics (Figure 4).
The temporal axis of human behavior appears to influence
human health [2], for example when patterns of activity on week-
ends are shifted later in the day compared to weekdays. We
found that this phenomenon, known as social jet lag [22, 33], is
prevalent on Twitter. The magnitude of Twitter social jet lag
generally increases from the Southwest to the Northeast of the
United States. Many of the observed correlations with Twitter
social jet lag can be rationalized in terms of work schedules or
geographic effects. Early commute start times (which imply
long commutes) predict greater Twitter social jet lag, while the
fraction of the population in college is correlated with lower
Twitter social jet lag, perhaps because there is reduced weekday
pressure on the schedule of college students. High latitude is
correlated with higher average Twitter social jet lag, possibly
because of photoperiodic effects on biological rhythms. Simi-
larly, proximity to the Western edge of a time zone, where
the sun rises later in local time, is correlated with Twitter social
jet lag.
Particularly for those regions with larger overall Twitter social
jet lag, there is a strong seasonal effect, with a marked decrease
in social jet lag during the summer. This decrease derives primar-
ily from seasonal changes in weekday schedules, which appear
to be strongly affected by school holiday schedules. Data on
individual counties and statistical analyses of the full dataset
both suggest that social factors exert a larger influence on
Twitter activity patterns than do seasonal changes in day length.
Our results complement earlier efforts that used surveys to
determine whether the timing of sleep wake-schedules follows
sunrise, both seasonally and from East to West, in European
populations [44, 48, 50]. Among German respondents, the
mid-sleep point tends to align to seasonal changes in sunrise
from late autumn to early spring, but not during the summer or
when daylight savings time (DST) is in effect [48]. And in Estonia,
sleep schedules display little variation year-round [44]. These
observations are in line with the diversity of seasonal behavior
we observe across US counties, some of which may exhibit
traces of dawn-tracking behavior in late autumn, but generally
show little seasonal variability in the timing of Twitter activity dur-
ing DST. It has been proposed that weakened responses of
modern sleeping schedules to the rising and setting of the sun
are consequences of spending little time exposed to natural
light, particularly in more urbanized environments [4, 50]. In this
regard, one possible explanation for our findings is that the pop-
ulation of Twitter users consists largely of people who spend little
time outdoors and structure their lives irrespective of when the
sun rises and sets, but in accord with social obligations such
as work and school.
Summer shifts in Twitter activity are more pronounced in
certain counties (stronger in clusters 2 and 3 in Figure 5). One
explanation could be that students comprise a large proportion
of Twitter users in those counties and thus dominate the activity.
An important caveat of our study is that Twitter users may not be
representative of the general population. In surveys of internet
users in 2012–2013 from the Pew Research Center [51, 52],
27%–31% of respondents who were 18-29 years old used
Twitter compared with 16%–19% of respondents who were
30–49 years old; 18%–20% of urban respondents used Twitter
compared with 11%–12% of rural respondents. Nevertheless,
all age, education, income, and urbanity groups are substantially
represented in these surveys. Thus, we instead favor the possi-
bility that school schedules influence the activity schedules of
students as well as a much larger portion of society (e.g., par-
ents, caretakers, educators, and other school employees), and
that the large differences we observe in the strength of seasonal
effects between counties may reflect demographic and occupa-
tional differences.
Social jet lag has been previously found to associate with
several disease indicators, including obesity and depression
[18, 22]. We also find that the incidence of obesity is associated
with the magnitude of Twitter social jet lag. It would be interesting
to extend this analysis to individual users to determine activity
patterns that are most strongly associated with disease versus
healthy states in users living in similar environments. For
instance, such findings could aid the development of school
schedules and work schedules matched to individuals’ circadian
rhythms, helping to optimize performance in an increasingly
‘‘round-the-clock’’ work culture.
As portable health monitors and activity trackers become
more widespread, so will real-world measurements linking the
temporal structure of our daily lives with health and disease.
Based on such epidemiological correlations, researchers will
be able to design experiments probing the connection between
3772

 circadian rhythms and illness and incorporate circadian timing
into diagnosis and treatment options [26]. Our study shows
that patterns of social media use can be analyzed to determine
the statistical contexts in which individuals operate and to iden-
tify factors correlated with disrupted activity rhythms.

METHOD DETAILS
Overview of methodology
Starting from a raw dataset containing the timestamps, locations, and user IDs of tweets sent between 2012 and 2013, we calculated
county-level average Twitter activity profiles (i.e., tweetograms). Each tweetogram represents the probability distribution of tweeting
throughout an average 24-hr day in a given county over a particular time period of interest (e.g., weekday activity profile in February).
All tweetograms exhibit pronounced troughs (i.e., periods of low activity at night) and we studied how the timing of troughs differed
county to county, and month to month. We defined Twitter social jet lag as the shift between tweetogram troughs on weekdays and
weekends and performed statistical analyses to relate the magnitude of this shift to various demographic descriptors of US counties.
We also studied how Twitter social jet lag changes monthly, compared the seasonal fluctuations in Twitter social jet lag among US
counties using a clustering analysis, and compared the distributions of various demographic descriptors among the resulting clusters
using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Finally, we studied how the timing of tweetogram troughs changes seasonally in a model where the
timing of tweetogram troughs depends linearly on day length. The following sections describe our data collection, processing,
and analysis steps in detail. Datasets containing all county-level information used for analyses in this study are provided at the
depositories listed in the Key Resources Table.
Generating Tweetograms from Twitter Data
The basic unit of analysis in this study is a tweetogram, an anonymized measure of Twitter activity in a county over a 24-hr time
period, averaged over all days of interest and for all users in each county. To calculate tweetograms from the master dataset
containing the timestamps, user IDs and geolocations of tweets, we assigned tweets to US counties, normalized daily tweet
counts for each user, and binned tweet counts into 15-min intervals. Finally, binned activity profiles in each county were aver-
aged across specific days of interest, with each day contributing equally to the average. Individual steps are described in detail
below.
The master dataset contains all public tweets with publicly listed geolocation metadata that were sent from Jan. 1, 2011 to
June 30, 2014 by users in the United States. We used the timestamps and geolocation metadata of the tweets in the analysis.
Twitter IDs were used only to normalize activity levels among different users, as described below, and to remove counties with a
median number of unique daily users below 10 over the time span of the dataset. We used only the complete years 2012 and
2013 for our analysis of tweeting patterns. The dataset did not contain any text, data, or other metadata from the tweets.

 Detailed descriptions of criteria used to select data for specific figures in the main text and criteria used to reject outliers are
provided in the tables at the end of this section.
On each calendar day, each user was assigned to a given US county based on the geolocation of the first tweet that user sent that
day. Although we do not track movements between counties, our previous analysis suggests that the vast majority of Twitter users
remain in the same county, and to the extent that they travel, it is mainly to neighboring regions [53].
Tweet counts were binned into 15-min intervals and each user’s daily activity was then normalized to unit weight (Figure 1A). For
example, if a user sent 5 tweets on January 1, 2013, then each tweet contributes 0.2 units to the 15-min bin when it was sent. This first
normalization step gives equal weight to all users on any given day and helps ensure that the results are not biased by a small number
of highly-active users.
Each county’s daily activity was then normalized to unit weight. This second normalization step is necessary to avoid biases due to
days with unusually high Twitter activity. Symbolically, if a county has N Twitter users on a given day, and if fi(t) is the number of tweets
from user i during time bin t, then the normalized activity is given by:
A t
ð Þ = 1
N
X
i
fi t
ð Þ
P
tfi t
ð Þ
Twitter activity timeseries were then averaged across different days over the time periods of interest (e.g., across all days of 2012-
2013, or separately by month of the year and by weekdays and weekends), i.e., averaging A(t) above. The resulting curves are tweeto-
grams. For downstream analysis and visualization purposes, tweetograms were smoothed with a 150-min Gaussian kernel.
The table below lists the data that were included in the tweetogram calculations in different figures.
In Figure 2, we specifically disregarded months when major holidays in the work and school calendar occur. Thus, we excluded
May-September due to summer holidays, and November-January due to Thanksgiving, Christmas and winter holidays.
The following table lists which counties were excluded from analysis in different figures.
Characterization of Tweetogram Troughs
To calculate the width of a given tweetogram trough (Figure 1B), we calculated the horizontal distance between trough edges at the
tweetogram value corresponding to 25% of the median height among all tweetograms in the dataset (see dotted line in Figures 1B
and 1D); here, the height refers to the maximum value of the smoothed, interpolated tweetogram. We found this strategy was more
robust than calculating the width of each tweetogram at its own quarter-height position, but the two approaches were in good agree-
ment with each other. We found that computing tweetogram widths at this 25%-height level avoided artifacts arising from variability
in tweetogram structures at the maximum and at the bottom of the trough.

 Calculation of Twitter social jet lag
In prior work, social jet lag has typically been defined as the difference between the midpoints of nighttime sleep on weekends and
weekdays, based on surveys asking respondents when they go to sleep and wake up [10]. Because we do not have access to indi-
vidual users’ data, we defined Twitter social jet lag as the temporal shift between county-level weekday and weekend nighttime
Twitter activity patterns.
Mathematically, we defined Twitter social jet lag as the time delay between weekend and weekday tweetograms that maximizes
the cross-correlation between the troughs of the curves after they were smoothed and linearly interpolated in 1.5-min intervals. To
calculate this value, we computed the Pearson correlation coefficients between the 2 a.m. – 10 a.m. portion of the weekend tweeto-
gram and the corresponding interval on the weekday tweetogram, as the latter was temporally shifted in 1.5-min intervals up to a
maximum delay (t) of ± 4 hours. The time delay leading to the maximum correlation coefficient was defined as Twitter social jet
lag (tSJL). In an equation:
tSJL = argmax
�4 <b
t < 4
r wkend 2am; 10am
ð
Þ; wkday 2am � t; 10am � t
ð
Þ
ð
Þ;
where wkend(t1,t2) refers to the vector of weekend tweetogram values for t1 < t < t2, wkday(t1,t2) refers to the respective portion of
the weekday tweetogram, and r(x,y) is the Pearson correlation coefficient.
We compared this choice with a simpler metric, the difference in the positions of weekend and weekday tweetogram troughs.
Trough positions were estimated by fitting parabolas within ± 3 hours of the minima of the smoothed tweetograms. We reasoned
that this second metric based on trough tweetogram positions approximated the difference in mid-sleep positions on weekends
and weekdays, the traditional definition of social jet lag. We found that the two metrics were in good agreement with each other (Pear-
son r = 0.91, p value < 4e-15, for calculations in Figure 4), but we favor the cross-correlation metric because it is nonparametric and
does not assume that the troughs are parabolic.
Shift-Work Analysis
We downloaded data from the American Time Use Survey [43] for 2012-2013 using the American Time Use Survey Extract Builder
[42] to obtain the reported number of hours worked between the interval 8 a.m.–6 p.m. and the number of hours worked outside of
that interval. We used this to compute a shift work measure: the fraction of hours worked outside of 8 a.m.–6 p.m. We excluded
counties with fewer than 30 survey respondents, resulting in a subset of 115 counties for which we had both tweetograms and
this shift work measure. This subset was used to calculate Pearson correlation coefficients with tweetogram trough widths and
Twitter social jet lag.
Agglomerative clustering analysis
To identify common patterns of seasonal fluctuation in Twitter social jet lag among US counties, we performed a clustering analysis.
To focus on differences in seasonal variability between counties, as opposed to the mean level of Twitter social jet lag, we first sub-
tracted the annual average from each county’s monthly social jet lag values and used the residual seasonal fluctuations for clustering
(Figure 4). Agglomerative clustering was performed using the built-in clusterdata() function in MATLAB 2017b (MathWorks, Inc.), us-
ing Euclidean distance to compare mean-subtracted monthly social jet lag curves and Ward’s linkage to compare clusters with each
other. The choice to cut the hierarchical cluster tree at the level that produced three clusters was made empirically. If counties were
subdivided into fewer clusters, we found noticeable inhomogeneity in at least one cluster by visual inspection of clustering results
(e.g., heatmap in Figure 4A). Selecting four or more clusters led to clusters without social jet lag patterns that were obviously different
by visual inspection. The gap statistic [54] calculated using the MATLAB evalclusters() function for 1-10 clusters confirmed our
choice.
Calculations of Daylength tracking behavior
To understand whether the timing of Twitter activity onset follows the seasonal changes in the time of sunrise throughout the year or
remains aligned to local time, we calculated the linear dependence of the positions of tweetogram troughs on day length. A slope of
0 indicates that the trough position remains aligned to local time and is unchanged throughout the year. A slope of approximately �0.4
suggests that the trough position changes seasonally in accord with changes in the timing of sunrise (e.g., getting earlier with longer
days in the summer); by the same reasoning, a slope near 0.6 reflects dusk-tracking. Slopes in Figure 6 were calculated for each
county by linear regression of monthly tweetogram trough times on day length. Tweetogram trough positions were estimated by
fitting parabolas within ± 3 hours of the minima of the smoothed tweetograms. We estimated 95% confidence intervals for the trough
position from the Jacobian of the parabolic fit using the MATLAB function nlparci() (Table S5). Day length was defined as time elapsed
between sunrise and sunset, when the sun is 0.833 degrees below the horizon, averaged over all days for each calendar month. In
Figures 6A–6C, linear fits were performed only over months when daylight savings time was in effect (filled markers: April-October); in
Figures 6D–6F, fits were performed over months when school was in session and DST was in effect (filled markers: April, May,
September, October). Monthly dawn times were defined as the local times at sunrise averaged over all days for each calendar month.
Tweetogram trough times were analyzed and plotted in local time.

 Demographic and Other Descriptors of US Counties
To perform statistical analyses relating various population characteristics of US counties with the magnitude of Twitter social jet lag,
its seasonal fluctuations, or properties of tweetogram troughs, we compiled a series of descriptors for each county.
Demographic, socioeconomic, commuting, health, and religion data were downloaded from the US Census Bureau and collec-
tions curated by Social Explorer, County Health Rankings and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) [55–62]. These
databases aggregate information from multiple government and proprietary sources, such as US Census, Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Association of Religion Data Archives.
Specifically, data on county-level prevalence of sufficient sleep was obtained from the 2017 County Health Rankings dataset,
which included sufficient sleep data from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey System run by the Centers of Disease
Control and Prevention [36, 55, 63]. The CDC defines prevalence of sufficient sleep as the fraction of respondents reporting over 7
hours of sleep on average.
Astronomical variables were computed with the help of the Astral package in Python [64], which relies on solar calculations from
NOAA [65]. Average precipitation and temperature readings were obtained from the North American Land Assimilation System
(NLDAS) on CDC WONDER [66, 67]. We included two further weather variables. The first weather variable was the number of
‘‘good-weather’’ days. Good-weather days were defined as those with at least 4 hours in a comfort zone based on standards devel-
oped in the building design literature [68, 69]. This zone is defined as a four-point patch with vertices in temperature and humidity
space. For temperature in Celsius (�C) and specific humidity in grams of vapor per kilogram of air, respectively, the four points
are (18, 6.71), (27, 8.85), (27, 13.85), and (18,10). The second weather variable was the number of ‘‘bad-weather’’ days. Bad-weather
days had at least 4 hours in an uncomfortable zone, defined as temperatures below –5�C or above 35�C. Good-weather days and
bad-weather days are not mutually exclusive; for each, the number of days in each county per year (averaged over 2003-2013) was
included in the analyses.
Data on US election outcomes was downloaded from [70], which aggregated election results originally provided by The Guardian
and TownHall.com [71, 72]. We used each county’s vote in the 2012 presidential election as a proxy for political leaning.
Detailed definitions of data variables and data sources are provided in Table S2.
School calendars were downloaded from the websites of indicated school districts. Start and end dates of holiday breaks shown in
Figure 5 and provided in Table S7.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The number of data points used for statistical comparisons and criteria for exclusion of outliers are listed in the tables at the end of
STAR Methods section titled ‘‘Generating Tweetograms from Twitter Data.’’
Linear Modeling and One-Way Correlation Analysis
We studied the relationship between Twitter social jet lag and roughly 130 characteristics of US counties (Table S2, Figure S2). In this
analysis, we calculated average social jet lag only over the months of February-April and October to avoid the influence of school
breaks and major holidays (as in Figure 2).
First, we performed an exploratory analysis, calculating the Pearson correlation coefficients between the magnitude of Twitter
social jet lag and each of the covariates (Table S2, Figure S2). Dotted lines in Figure S2A mark the threshold for statistically significant
non-zero Pearson correlation coefficients controlled at family-wise error rate (FWER) < 0.05 using the Bonferroni correction [73].
Though few variables individually explain more than 6% of the variance in Twitter social jet lag, certain predictors appear more impor-
tant than others (e.g., longitude correlates with extent of social jet lag more strongly than average precipitation). However, it is not
possible to judge from the correlations with individual characteristics how much of the total variance in Twitter social jet lag can
be explained by all of these predictors jointly because they are not independent.
To study the contributions of many predictors while taking into account the statistical relationships between them, we built a linear
model that described Twitter social jet lag as a constant plus a weighted sum of predictors. The best-fit coefficient in front of a given
predictor can be interpreted as the effect of the predictor on the response variable after accounting for the influences of all other
predictors.
We focused on a subset of 22 predictors which were selected (i) if we hypothesized they may relate to social jet lag based on our
preliminary observations (e.g., student population), (ii) if they represented basic demographic variables, or if (iii) they had been
previously shown to correlate with social jet lag in a different population [10, 22, 74]. We excluded strongly correlated predictors
(maximal pairwise Pearson r % 0.7 among 22 predictors). Based on these criteria, the following variables were selected (Table S1):
d basic demographic characteristics (population, the fraction of the population represented in our dataset daily on average, sex,
age, race) or socioeconomic characteristics (employment, income, home ownership)
d commuting characteristics (average commute length and average morning commute start time)
d student population characteristics (fraction of population in high school and college)
d geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude, East-West position in time zone)
d health statistics (smoking, obesity, diabetes, mental health, sleep)
d political leaning (Democratic voters in 2012 election)

 We built the linear model using the fitlm() function in MATLAB. To evaluate the significance of the coefficients, we employed the
Bonferroni p value correction to control the family-wise error rate at 0.1. All eight statistically-significant coefficients are displayed
in Figure 2E. The full model with 22 coefficients and a constant term had an R2
adj = 0.23 (R2 = 0.24, F statistic versus constant model:
19.9, p value < 1e-67); the reduced model, comprised of only the nine variables in Figure 2E plus a constant term, had an R2
adj = 0.21
(R2 = 0.22, F statistic versus constant model: 46.5, p value < 1e-73). We confirmed that the covariates provided independent
information in the linear model by computing variance inflation factors (VIFs) (Table S1) [75].
Cluster Enrichment Analysis
For the enrichment analysis in Figure 4, we used the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test to compare distributions of each socioeco-
nomic predictor among the three clusters. We chose this test because many of the covariates had long-tail distributions. The Kruskal-
Wallis test evaluates the hypothesis that the medians of the three distributions are identical.
For each predictor described in the previous section and each of the four clusters in Figure 4A, we performed the Kruskal-Wallis
test comparing the distribution of this predictor for counties inside and outside the cluster. The corresponding p values are plotted in
Figure S4, where the dashed lines mark the Bonferroni-corrected p value threshold controlling the family-wise error rate at 0.05.
