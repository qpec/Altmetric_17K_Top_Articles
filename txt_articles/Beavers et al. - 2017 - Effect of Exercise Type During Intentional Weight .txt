Objective: To examine the long-term effects of exercise modality during weight loss on body composi-
tion and associations between body composition and physical function changes.
Methods: Two hundred forty-nine older adults (66.9 6 4.7 years, 71% women, 32% African American,
BMI: 34.4 6 3.7 kg/m2) were randomized to weight loss (WL; n 5 82), WL plus aerobic training (WL 1 AT;
n 5 86), or WL plus resistance training (WL 1 RT; n 5 81) for 18 months. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiome-
try–acquired body composition, 400-m walk time, and knee extensor strength were measured at baseline
and at 6 and 18 months.
Results: Total body mass loss was enhanced when WL was combined with exercise (WL: 25.7 6 0.7 kg,
WL 1 AT: 28.5 6 0.7 kg, WL 1 RT: 28.7 6 0.7 kg; P < 0.01). Total body fat mass loss was significantly
greater in WL 1 AT (26.8 6 0.6 kg, 216.4%) and WL 1 RT (27.8 6 0.5 kg, 219.0%) than WL (24.8 6 0.6
kg, 210.9%); both P < 0.01. Lean mass loss was greatest in WL 1 AT (21.6 6 0.3 kg, 23.1%) compared
with WL 1 RT (20.8 6 0.3 kg, 21.5%) or WL (21.0 6 0.3 kg; 22.0%); both P � 0.02. Change in 400-m
walk time was associated with change in fat mass (b/SD 5 16.1 s; P < 0.01), while change in knee exten-
sor strength was associated with change in lean mass (b/SD 5 11.6 Nm; P < 0.01).
Conclusions: WL 1 RT results in less lean mass lost than WL 1 AT; WL plus exercise yields greater fat
mass loss than WL alone.

Introduction
In addition to the well-known cardiometabolic consequences of obe-
sity, excessive adiposity is also a significant contributor to func-
tional limitation in old age (1). Indeed, if left unabated, current
trends suggest that the functionally disabled older adult with obesity
will soon become the most commonly encountered phenotype of
frailty
(2).
Lifestyle-based
interventions
in
older
adults
with
obesity demonstrate immediate improvement in muscle strength and
function, with 5% to 10% weight loss (3-10); yet widespread enthu-
siasm to recommend intentional weight loss in advanced age is
diminished due to significant loss in lean mass (i.e., 10%-50% of
total tissue) (11,12) and uncertainty surrounding implications for
long-term functional status as well as other health outcomes (13).
Weight loss strategies that maximize fat mass loss while minimizing
lean mass loss should provide the greatest health benefit for this
demographic, although evidence from well-designed trials is needed
to guide recommendations (14).
Change in body composition with caloric restriction-induced weight
loss is modifiable with exercise. Randomized controlled trial (RCT)
evidence in older adults with obesity suggests that the addition of
moderate-intensity aerobic (15,16), progressive resistance (9,17), or
combined (3,6) exercise programs to caloric restriction results in a
more favorable shift in body composition compared to either inter-
vention alone. A direct comparison of the effects of aerobic or
resistance exercise during caloric restriction was recently assessed in
a short-term (i.e., 6-month) study, with results suggestive of a supe-
rior ability of resistance training to attenuate weight loss-associated
lean mas loss compared to aerobic training (18); however, confirma-
tory long-term data are lacking. In addition, while exercise itself
does not significantly lower body weight, consideration of the

CLINICAL TRIALS AND INVESTIGATIONS
Obesity
 synergistic effects of exercise added to caloric restriction to augment
loss of total body mass and alter composition in older (i.e.,
601 years at baseline) adults has only been evaluated in a handful
of RCTs (3,9,15,17). Overall, these studies suggest similar weight
and fat mass loss between treatment groups, with exercise modestly
attenuating lean mass loss. Studies, however, are generally small
(n 5 11-28 per treatment group), of relatively short duration (4-12
months), and done under tightly supervised conditions, limiting their
external validity. The paucity of data on this topic, coupled with the
fact that many commercial weight loss programs focus exclusively
on caloric restriction to induce weight loss, creates a rationale for
further investigation into the long-term effects of caloric restriction
with differing exercise modalities compared to caloric restriction
alone on change in body mass and composition in older adults.
Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to compare the long-
term effects of caloric restriction-induced weight loss alone (WL) and
with aerobic training (WL1 AT) or resistance training (WL1 RT) on
change in body composition in older adults with obesity undergoing an
18-month community-based weight loss intervention. This analytic plan
represents a secondary analysis of a previously reported primary outcome
paper (19), and we hypothesized that WL1 RT would better preserve
lean mass than WL1 AT or WL alone. Second, we examined the contri-
butions of change in total body fat and lean masses on change in 400-m
walk time and knee extensor strength, as these objectively measured out-
comes are clinically relevant and highly predictive of subsequent disabil-
ity and death (20,21). We hypothesized that change in total body fat mass
would be associated with change in 400-m walk time and that change in
total body lean mass would be associated with change in knee extensor
strength. Data from this aim contribute a growing body of knowledge
(6,16,22,23) delineating the relative contributions of fat and lean mass
lost during intentional weight loss on physical function.
Methods
Study design
Details of the study design and methods are published (24). Briefly,
the Cooperative Lifestyle Intervention Program (CLIP II; Clinical-
Trials.gov identifier NCT01547182) was a multisite single-blinded
RCT involving three YMCAs in Forsyth County, North Carolina. Par-
ticipants were randomized to one of three treatment groups: caloric
restriction-induced weight loss alone (WL), weight loss plus aerobic
training
(WL 1 AT),
or
weight
loss
plus
resistance
training
(WL 1 RT) for 18 months. The study was approved by the Wake For-
est University Institutional Review Board. The primary outcome
paper, including protocol compliance and the intervention effect on
dual primary outcome measures, time to complete a 400-m walk, and
knee extensor strength, is published (19).
Study participants
A total of 249 participants were enrolled in the CLIP II study. Eligi-
bility criteria consisted of men and women aged 60 to 79 years who
engaged in <60 min/wk of moderately intense physical activity, had
BMI � 28 kg/m2 and < 42 kg/m2, had self-reported limitations with
mobility, and had documented evidence of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) or a National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treat-
ment Panel III (ATP III) diagnosis of metabolic syndrome (MetS).
Individuals were excluded if they had a myocardial infarction or car-
diovascular procedure in the past 3 months, fasting blood gluco-
se � 140 mg/dL, or a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or insulin-
dependent type 2 diabetes or if their primary care physician had
concerns regarding their ability to safely participate. All participants
provided written informed consent prior to study enrollment.
Intervention descriptions
Full intervention descriptions can be found in the published design
paper (24).
Weight loss.
The three study arms received the same behavior-
based WL intervention in three 6-month phases: intensive (months
1-6), transition (months 7-12), and maintenance (months 13-18),
with the goal of eliciting a 0.3 kg/wk weight loss in the intensive
phase (�330 kcal/d reduction) and a total weight loss of 7% to
10%. During the intensive phase, participants met at the YMCA for
three group sessions and one individual sessions per month (all 60
minutes in duration). Group sessions tapered off to three and then
one per month for the subsequent phases, with individual sessions
scheduled as needed. In accordance with the 2010 dietary guidelines
(25), the macronutrient breakdown of the diet was 20% to 25%
protein, 25% to 30% fat, and 45% to 55% carbohydrate. For the
WL-only group, participants were instructed not to begin a formal
exercise program while actively enrolled in the study.
Aerobic training.
The primary mode of AT was an individually
tailored, supervised, over-ground walking program. The program fre-
quency was 4 d/wk, progressing to a duration goal of 45 min/d and
walking intensity of 12 to 14 on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exer-
tion (RPE) Scale (26).
Resistance training.
The RT intervention was also individually
tailored and involved a training frequency of 4 d/wk, progressing to
45 min/d, with an RPE of 15 to 18 as a target intensity for each RT
exercise. Participants completed three sets of 10 to 12 repetitions on
eight machines, with initial resistance determined from one repeti-
tion maximum (1RM) testing (goal of 75% of 1RM). When a partic-
ipant completed 12 repetitions in the third set for two consecutive
days, the resistance was increased to ensure progressive overload.
To assist with recovery time, participants rotated exercises on a 2-
day schedule: day one included leg press, hip adduction, hip abduc-
tion, calf extension, seated row, pectoral fly, shoulder press, and
rotary torso; day two included leg extension, leg curl, lateral pull
down, seated chest press, lateral raise, arm curl, triceps extension,
and abdominal crunch.
Measurements
Participant age, gender, race/ethnicity, and medical history/comorbid
status were captured via self-report at the baseline assessment visit.
Also at baseline, height was assessed without shoes to the nearest
0.25 cm using a stadiometer (Portrod, Health-O-Meter) and body
mass measured to the nearest 0.05 kg using a calibrated and certified
digital scale (Professional 349KLX, Health-O-Meter). All body com-
position variables were collected at baseline (n 5 247), 6 months
(n 5 223), and 18 months (n 5 189). Total body, fat, and lean mass,
as well as appendicular lean/fat masses and trunk fat, were assessed
using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; iDXA, GE Medical
Systems, Waukesha, Wisconsin), following manufacturer recommen-
dations for patient positioning and scanning. Physical function was
also assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 18 months via a validated
400-m walk test (that requires walking 10 laps as quickly as possible

 on a 20-m course between two cones with the time for completion
recorded in seconds) (20) and knee extensor strength assessed as
peak torque in Newton-meters (Nm) using an isokinetic dynamome-
ter (System 4, Biodex, Shirley, New York) (24).
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics were calculated overall and by treatment group
at baseline. Overall treatment group comparisons were made using
contrasts in a mixed-model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with
baseline value of the outcome, gender, treatment group, time (6 or 18
months), and a treatment group-by-time interaction included as fixed
effects and wave included as a random effect. Data are presented as
the average follow-up mean (95% CI) and changes from baseline at 6
and 18 months (95% CI).
To determine the association between change in total body mass,
lean mass, and fat mass and previously published intervention
effects on 400-m walk time and knee extensor strength (19), we
adjusted the above ANCOVA models for two additional pairs of
variables: baseline and follow-up total body mass or baseline and
follow-up total body composition (lean mass or fat mass, respec-
tively) in treatment groups combined. Analyses were performed
using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) and using a
Bonferroni-adjusted type I error rate of 0.025.
Results
Participant characteristics
Table 1 presents baseline demographic and body composition measures,
according to treatment group and overall. Briefly, 249 older (66.964.7
years) adults (71% women, 32% African American) with BMI of
34.463.7 kg/m2 and CVD and/or MetS participated in this 18-month
RCT, of whom 247 had complete DXA data at baseline (90% retention at
6 months, 77% retention at 18 months; see CONSORT diagram in Sup-
porting Information Figure S1). At baseline, overall total body, fat, and
lean masses were 94.4614.9 kg, 42.468.2 kg (45.065.7%), and
49.4610.1 kg (52.165.5%), respectively, with no differences between
treatment groups.
As previously reported (19), median (25th, 75th percentiles) attend-
ance to scheduled WL intervention sessions was 71.1% (40.5, 83.3)
for WL only, 83.1% (47.6, 92.9) for WL 1 AT, and 85.7% (70.7,
92.7) for WL 1 RT. All three treatment groups lost significant
weight from baseline (26.1% [95% CI: 27.5 to 24.7] for WL only,
28.6% [95% CI: 210.0 to 27.2] for WL 1 AT, and 29.7% [95%
CI: 211.1 to 28.4] for WL 1 RT), and both WL plus exercise treat-
ment groups had greater improvement in 400-m walk time than WL
alone (mean difference 16.9 [95% CI: 9.7 to 24.0] seconds,
P < 0.01) and experienced a similar change in knee extensor
strength (combined WL 1 AT and WL 1 RT mean difference 23.6
[95% CI: 27.5 to 0.3] Nm, P 5 0.07).
Intervention effect on body mass and
composition
Adjusted overall intervention effects on body composition are presented
in Table 2. Total body mass was significantly reduced in all treatment
groups (WL: 25.7 6 0.7 kg, WL 1 AT: 28.5 6 0.7 kg, WL 1 RT:
28.76 0.7 kg; all P < 0.01). The two WL plus exercise treatment
groups had lower follow-up total body mass compared to WL alone
(WL 1 AT: 85.9 6 0.9 kg and WL1 RT: 85.66 0.7 kg vs. WL:
88.66 0.7 kg; both P < 0.01) and were not different from each other
(P 5 0.75). Significant overall treatment effects were also observed for
total body fat mass (P < 0.01) and total body lean mass (P < 0.01). As
with total body mass, WL 1 AT and WL1 RT treatment groups had
similar and greater reductions in fat mass compared to WL alone (both
P < 0.01). Interestingly, absolute lean mass was lower in WL 1 AT
(47.8 6 0.3 kg) compared to WL1 RT or WL alone (48.5 6 0.3 kg and
48.46 0.3 kg, respectively; both P < 0.01). However, because of a
greater reduction in fat mass in WL 1 AT compared to WL alone,
follow-up lean mass as a percentage of total body mass was signifi-
cantly higher in WL 1 AT compared to WL alone (55.8 6 0.3% vs.

 54.5 6 0.3%; P < 0.01). Treatment effects for appendicular lean mass,
appendicular fat mass, and trunk fat were similar to those observed for
total body lean and fat masses, respectively (Table 2).
Model-adjusted change estimates for total body mass, partitioned
into total body fat and total body lean compartments and presented
by treatment group, are shown in Figure 1. As pictured and in
accordance with follow-up data, change in absolute lean mass was
20.9 6 0.3 kg, 21.6 6 0.3 kg, and 20.8 6 0.3 kg for the WL,
WL 1 AT, and WL 1 RT treatment groups, respectively, with signif-
icant differences reported between WL and WL 1 AT and between
WL 1 AT and WL 1 RT (both P < 0.01).
Relationship between change in total body mass
and composition and physical function
Modeling results for the association between change in total body
mass and composition and the physical function outcome measures of
400-m walk time and knee extensor strength are presented in Table 3.
No interaction between treatment group and change in total, fat, or
lean mass for either functional outcome was observed. In treatment
groups combined and after adjustment for baseline value of the out-
come, treatment group, gender, time, and treatment group by time
interaction, the magnitude of change in total body mass was associated
with change in 400-m walk time (P < 0.01), with every 1 kg lost asso-
ciated with a 0.97-second reduction in 400-m walk time. This associa-
tion was driven primarily by change in fat mass (b 6 SE: 1.35 6 0.34
seconds; P < 0.01). The magnitude of change in total body mass was
not associated with change in knee extensor strength (P 5 0.06); how-
ever, change in knee extensor strength was directly associated with
change in lean mass (b 6 SE: 1.28 6 0.43 Nm; P < 0.01).
Discussion
Results from this study confirm and extend previous research in
older adults, demonstrating the ability of structured exercise to
attenuate the proportion of weight lost as lean mass (18), while
reporting the novel result of the superior ability of WL 1 RT to pre-
serve absolute lean mass as compared to WL 1 AT in the long-term
and when executed in a community setting. To date, four RCTs
have been published in which the additive effect of exercise to WL
has been compared to WL alone in older (i.e., 601 years at baseline)
adults, with two studies employing RT (9,17), one study employing
AT (15), and one using a combined approach (3). In general agree-
ment with trials employing some form of RT in combination with
WL, we observed a significant reduction in the percentage of total
body mass lost as lean mass when RT is added to WL (10%) com-
pared to WL alone (16%) (3,9,17). Original findings presented here
show half as much lean mass is lost with WL 1 RT compared to
WL 1 AT (20.8 kg vs. 21.6 kg, respectively), despite a similar
overall reduction in total body mass, when interventions are directly
compared. Although novel, given that RT is a well-established stim-
ulus for muscle growth and maintenance in weight-stable older
adults (27), results are not overly surprising. What is surprising,
however, is that we did not find a lean mass sparing effect of
WL 1 AT compared to WL alone. This is in contrast to several
tightly controlled studies conducted in middle-aged and older adults
(28), including results from the similarly aged (i.e., 601 years at
baseline, mean: 67.2 years) and designed (i.e., WL 1 moderate-
intensity walking, 3-5 d/wk for 35-45 min/d vs. WL alone) study by
Chomentowski et al. (15). Differences in study duration (4 months
vs. 18 months in the present study), setting (clinical vs. community-
based), or total WL achieved in the WL-only arms (9.2% vs. 6.1%
in the present study) may contribute to this discrepancy and warrant
further exploration.
Provocative results from this community-based trial also suggest
augmented total body mass loss in WL 1 AT and WL 1 RT com-
pared to WL alone; our data show an unprecedented near doubling
of absolute fat mass (and, therefore, total body mass) loss when
exercise is added to caloric restriction induced WL. In contrast, pre-
vious trials in older adults report significant, yet similar, weight and
fat mass loss between WL only and WL plus exercise arms, with a
5% to 20% reduction in fat mass, depending on the magnitude of
total WL achieved (3,9,15,17). Although the behavior-based WL

 intervention was common to all CLIP II treatment groups, session
attendance was lower in the WL only treatment group (71.1%) as
compared to the WL plus exercise arms (83.1% and 85.7% for
WL 1 AT and WL 1 RT, respectively) and may signal reduced die-
tary compliance. Indeed, the amount of total WL achieved by the
WL plus exercise arms (�9%) aligns more closely to what is
observed in other trials than the WL-only arm (�6%). Nevertheless,
this finding is important, as it contributes to a growing body of liter-
ature examining the effectiveness of single versus multiple health
behavior change interventions among older adults (29) and under-
scores the translational value of combined caloric restriction and
exercise interventions to maximize weight and fat mass loss while
preserving physical function.
Secondary analyses from this study demonstrate that loss of total
body mass is associated with improvement in mobility (as measured
by the 400-m walk), driven by reductions in fat mass, and that
change in knee extensor strength is directly associated with change
in lean mass. Findings contribute to a growing body of data
implicating fat, rather than lean, mass as a primary target tissue
affecting mobility related tasks (6,22,23) and confirm the importance
of preserving lean mass for strength during WL in older adults (30).
Careful
interpretation
of
these
findings,
however,
necessitates
consideration of the magnitude of functional change considered
clinically meaningful. Data from the Lifestyle Interventions and
Independence for Elders Pilot (LIFE-P) study, for instance, suggest
that a 20-second change in 400-m walk time represents the lower
end of the range for clinical significance (31). Using this threshold
and results from our modeling approach, a loss of at least 20.6 kg of
total body mass or 14.8 kg of fat mass would be needed to elicit a
modest improvement in mobility, which are slightly higher than
other reported estimates (22). While the baseline walking speed of
our sample was much greater than that of the LIFE population (32),
calling into question the exact cut-point necessary to achieve clinical
significance, it is important to recognize that the degree of weight
and fat mass loss necessary to induce a meaningful change in mobil-
ity is likely substantial and may be difficult to achieve.
Although clinical cut-points for absolute knee strength have yet to
be established, this association should be considered in light of the
relatively small percentage of lean mass lost, as well as other known
predictors of muscle strength. As presented in the primary outcome
paper (19), using normalized values, both WL 1 RT and WL 1 AT
experienced gains (15% and 14%, respectively) in relative knee
extensor strength. Increases in relative strength signal an improve-
ment in muscle quality, which is arguably more important than mus-
cle quantity, and may be driven by reduced fat infiltration (33,34)
and inflammatory burden (35), as both predict muscle strength inde-
pendent of mass and are improved with weight loss. Collectively,
this framework tempers the concern regarding weight loss-associated
lean mass loss, although data presented here suggest weight loss
interventions that can preferentially reduce fat mass might yield the
greatest functional benefit.
Practically, our findings may be used to inform optimal geriatric
weight management strategies, as there is a dearth of RCT evidence
in this area (14,36), and improve clinical efficacy of diet and exer-
cise recommendations. With regard to the latter, current federal
physical activity guidelines are the same for older and younger
adults and include 150 min/wk of moderate to vigorous physical
activity plus moderate-intensity muscle strengthening activities on
two or more days (37). National surveillance data, however, suggest
that these ambitious guidelines are less likely to be met by older
adults, with just 15% of adults aged 65 to 75 years meeting goals
for both aerobic and strength training activities (38). Moreover,
recent findings from a short-term clinical trial in older adults with
obesity suggest that a combined AT and RT intervention is no better
at attenuating weight loss-associated lean mass loss and promoting
fat mass loss than WL 1 RT (18). Thus, a geriatrician managing the
older adult with sarcopenic obesity may stress the importance of
WL 1 RT therapy—perhaps even more so than a combined exercise
approach, should incorporating both modalities hinder compliance—
although, certainly, final recommendations must be carefully and
individually considered.
Strengths of this study design include the direct comparison of exercise
type during weight loss on body composition, inclusion of a large, het-
erogeneous sample, and long study duration. Moreover, because the
intervention was accomplished in a community setting, results are
highly translatable and align with the recent National Institutes of
Health vision of effectively disseminated clinical intervention research
(39). That said, this study does have weaknesses worth noting. First,
study findings should only be generalized to older adults with obesity
and documented CVD and/or MetS. Second, although DXA-acquired
total body lean and fat mass represents the gold standard in total body
composition assessment, and can provide some regional estimates, it
does not assess change in fat infiltration. Intriguing recent data suggest
decreases in visceral and intermuscular adipose tissue are important
mechanisms underlying improved function with WL and exercise inter-
ventions (23) and should be explored further. Third, while we present
associations between change in body composition and two clinically
meaningful functional endpoints, these analyses are by no means com-
prehensive. Future work formally exploring the mediating effect of
change in total body composition and change in physical function
would significantly add to this area of inquiry.
Conclusion
The primary findings from this 18-month community-based RCT
demonstrate the following: (1) WL 1 RT results in less lean mass
lost than WL 1 AT, and (2) WL plus RT or AT results in greater
overall reductions in total body mass than WL alone, driven by aug-
mented fat mass loss. Second, fat mass loss is primarily responsible
for weight loss-associated improvements in mobility, whereas lean
mass loss is primarily responsible for weight loss-associated declines
in strength. Collectively, these results indicate that the combination
of WL 1 RT may yield the greatest weight loss and the most favor-
able shift in body composition compared to WL 1 AT or WL alone,
thereby maximizing potential functional benefit.O
