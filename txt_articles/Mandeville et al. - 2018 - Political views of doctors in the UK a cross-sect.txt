ABSTRACT 
Background: Little is known about the political views of doctors in the United Kingdom, 
despite their importance in the functioning of the National Health Service.  
Methods: Survey-based cross-sectional study in which we asked questions about voting 
behaviour in 2015 and 2017 UK general elections and 2016 referendum on leaving the 
European Union (Brexit) and questions relating to recent health policies.  
Results: 1,172 doctors (45.1% women) from 1,295 responded to an online survey. 60.5% 
described their political views as ‘left-wing’ and 62.2% described themselves as ‘liberal’. 
79.4% of respondents voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum compared to 48.1% 
of voters as a whole (χ2=819.8, p<0.001). 98.6% of respondents agreed that EU nationals 
working in the NHS should be able to remain in the UK after Brexit. The median score for the 
impact of Brexit on the NHS on a scale of 0 (worst impact) to 10 (best impact) was 2 (IQR=1-
4). Most respondents agreed with the introduction of minimum alcohol pricing in the UK 
(73.9%), charging patients who are not eligible for NHS treatment for non-urgent care 
(70.6%) and protecting a portion of national spending for the NHS (87.1%). 65.8% thought 
there was too much use of NHS-funded private sector provision in their medical practice. 
Specialty, income and grade were associated with divergent opinions. 
Conclusions: UK doctors are left-leaning and liberal in general, which is reflected in their 
opinions on topical health policy issues. Doctors in the UK voted differently from the general 
electorate in recent polls.

INTRODUCTION 
Doctors have the capacity to be trusted and visible advocates for the health system that they 
work in. In the United Kingdom (UK), doctors consistently top polls of the most trusted 
professions by the general public, with 89% of the UK public trusting doctors to tell the truth 
in a 2015 survey.1  Medical leaders have drawn attention to emerging threats to health, such 
as excessive drinking, and campaigned for effective solutions.2 3 Doctors are also crucial 
stakeholders in the implementation of health policy reforms, with unique insight into the 
benefits and risks of proposed changes to the National Health Service (NHS).4 Yet the 
advocacy role of UK doctors in political issues that may affect the population’s health 
appears to be relatively under developed compared to clinical topics.  
The health and social care landscape in the UK is rapidly being redesigned in the context of 
a continued period of significant political flux.5 The last three years have seen referendums 
on Scottish independence and exiting the European Union (“Brexit”), and two general 
elections. In 2010, the historical dominance of two major political parties (Conservative and 
Labour) in regional strongholds fractured into a tapestry of multi-party support, leading to a 
coalition government (Conservative and Liberal Democrats) and the largest vote recorded to 
date for the right-wing populist UK Independence Party (UKIP) in the 2015 general election.6 
The early general election of 2017 saw a movement back to the traditional two big parties, 
with the Conservative government losing its parliamentary majority but holding onto power 
with support of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist party.7  
Major political changes have been echoed in health and social care. Health reforms under 
the last coalition government included one of the largest top-down reorganisations of the 
National Health Survey (NHS) in its history, followed by the rapid escalation of commercial 
contracting of NHS services.8 9 The NHS continues to undergo the largest sustained 
reduction in spending as a percentage of gross domestic product since 1951, accompanied 
by the highest debt ever reported by NHS hospitals in England.10 11 Doctors have reported 
“increasing workload, low levels of morale, plans to retire early and the intention to leave the 
  
 
5 of 23 
UK to practice abroad”,12 and discontent among junior doctors on contract reform led to their 
first strike in 40 years.13  
Little is known, however, about the political views and voting behaviour of doctors 
themselves. Given their potential influence, understanding the political opinions of doctors is 
crucial. In light of recent changes to the political landscape, we sought to investigate the 
political opinions and voting behaviour of the UK medical workforce. To do this, we 
undertook a survey of medical doctors in the UK. We examined views on politics and health 
policy by specialty and other professional and demographic groups. 
 
 
METHODS 
Survey development 
We developed a survey (supplementary file) with three parts:   
 (i) General political views and past voting behaviour 
We asked participants to place themselves on a scale from zero to ten, where zero 
represented extremely left wing political views and ten extremely right wing political views. In 
order to capture an alternative dimension of political beliefs in a short survey, we then asked 
participants to choose a term that best suited their political views, from “extremely liberal” to 
“extremely conservative”.14 Participants were also asked how they voted in the 2015 and 
2017 UK general elections, and the 2016 EU referendum. For those who were not eligible or 
chose not to vote, we asked how they would have voted.  
 
(ii) Views on specific health policy issues 
Participants were asked to rate the potential impact of Brexit on the NHS using a scale from 
zero (worst) to ten (best). We then asked participants whether they agreed with a series of 
statements on topical UK health policy issues using a five-point Likert scale (strongly agree 
to strongly disagree). These were on the following issues: (a) minimum alcohol pricing; (b) 
charges for non-urgent care for patients who are not eligible for free NHS treatment; (c) a 
  
 
6 of 23 
protected proportion of national spending for the NHS; and (d) private sector provision of 
healthcare in the UK. 
 
(iii) Participant characteristics 
We obtained demographic and professional information from participants, including: age, 
gender, region of residence (UK NUTS 1 statistical regions), type of residential area 
(urban/rural/other), specialty, type of workplace in which majority of work is undertaken, 
grade, annual income from clinical activities, and location of medical school (UK/EU member 
state/non-EU member state).  
 
We used the online survey software Qualtrics (Provo, USA) to conduct the survey. The 
survey tool was piloted first within the research team and with 20 doctors across a range of 
specialties and grades, with iterative modification to wording, layout and skip logic.   
 
Data collection 
To reach a representative sample of UK doctors, we collaborated with Doctors.net.uk, the 
largest online professional network, validated against General Medical Council (GMC) 
records of doctors (www.doctors.net.uk). Members were presented with a link to the survey 
after logging into their accounts. Data collection started one day after the 2017 general 
election (8 June 2017) and continued for one week. A preliminary analysis of these 
responses by specialty identified low responses in several specialties, including general 
practice, public health, ophthalmology, and surgery, compared to GMC data. In order to 
obtain a more representative sample by specialty, we then sent the survey link to targeted 
national specialty networks with responses collected for another three weeks. These 
networks included: the Association of Surgeons in Training, the British Orthopaedic Trainees 
Association; a national email group for public health specialty registrars; regional 
representatives of ophthalmology specialty registrars; a national Facebook group for general 
practitioners (GPs), the Trainee Doctors group of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, a 
  
 
7 of 23 
national Facebook group for doctors who are also mothers (Physician Mum’s Group UK) to 
capture doctors on parental leave, and junior doctor and consultant Facebook groups 
focused on professional contracts.  
We obtained comparison data from the GMC to assess the representativeness of our 
survey. This included gender; age; location where primary medical qualification was 
obtained; and region of GMC-registered address. The latter is not necessarily a current 
residential address, but a good proxy. We also obtained 2016 data for doctors on the GP 
register, all individual specialty registers, and those registered with the GMC but not on 
either GP or specialty registers. 
The research was approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee (2744/004). All 
responses were anonymous and the data could not be traced back to an individual. There 
was no specific funding for this study.  
 
Statistical analysis 
Analysis was carried out in SPSS (version 22) and Matlab (2015a). χ2 tests were used to 
compare survey and GMC data, with post-hoc comparison of individual categories compared 
to the sum of all other categories in that variable using χ2 tests with a Bonferroni correction.  
As region of residence is strongly associated with voting behaviour, direct standardisation 
was used to adjust the voting behaviour results by the regional distribution of the overall 
electorate using Electoral Commission data for the EU referendum, 2015 and 2017 general 
elections.15-17 We used Bowker tests to examine changes in voting behaviour between the 
2015 and 2017 general elections based on paired data within our sample. 
Ordinal logistic regressions (Matlab mnrfit command) were used to investigate whether any 
respondent characteristics influenced their views on these issues. Predictors were restricted 
to the pre-specified variables of specialty, grade (with collapsed consultant and GP classes), 
main workplace, type of residential area and income, which were all included in the model. 
The first four categorical variables were effects coded in order to compare against the 
unweighted mean of categories. Increasing categories of income were coded one to ten for 
  
 
8 of 23 
£0-£9,999 up to £90,000 - £99,999 respectively, 11 for £100,00-£150,000, and 16 for ≥ 
£150,000. Income was then treated as a linear predictor in the regression model. Where the 
omnibus model was significant (via a deviance-based test), we went on to consider any 
effects of individual predictors/levels using a Bonferroni correction to adjust for familywise 
error inflation.  
 
RESULTS 
Participants 
Responses were obtained from 1,295 individuals, of which 123 were excluded (see 
supplementary file for flow of responses). Of the 1,172 respondents included in analysis, 
45.1% were women and the modal age group was 30 to 39 years (Table 1). The majority of 
respondents (84.8%) qualified in the UK. Nearly nine out of ten lived in England (87.5%), 
and two thirds in urban areas (66.8%). Over half the respondents were consultants (36.1%) 
or GPs (19.8%), and a third were junior doctors (29.8%). Most respondents’ primary 
workplace was within the NHS (86.1%).

Our sample represented 0.4% of the 282,304 doctors licenced by the GMC in 2016. There 
was no significant difference in gender between our sample and GMC data (Table 1), 
however more respondents were aged over 60 years (χ2 = 72.5, p < 0.001) and from 
Yorkshire and the Humber/North East England (χ2 = 50.9, p < 0.001) than in the general 
medical workforce. We received responses from significantly more consultants (χ2 = 10.6, p 
= 0.001) and fewer GPs (χ2 = 11.0, p = 0.001) compared to the national distribution, but a 
representative number of junior and specialty doctors. The largest group of consultants were 
physicians (76/418, 18.2%), with a representative number of all specialties except pathology 
and occupational medicine (Figure 1). Significantly more doctors who had trained in the UK 
responded to our survey compared to the general medical workforce (χ2 = 218.9, p < 0.001).  
 
Political Views  
On a scale of zero (extremely left wing) to ten (extremely right wing), 60.5% of respondents 
rated their political views as less than five. The median was four (interquartile range (IQR) 3 
to 5) (Figure 2A). Several characteristics were associated with significant divergence on this 
score compared to the average for all groups. Adjusted for all other variables in the model, 
increasing income level was associated with more right-wing views (exp(β) = 1.12, p<0.001, 
95% CI 1.07, 1.17) and being a surgeon doubled the odds of a more right-wing score (exp(β) 
= 2.13, p=0.018, 95% CI 1.39, 3.27). In contrast, being a psychiatrist (exp(β) = 0.44, 
p=0.002, 95% CI 0.29, 0.66) or public health doctor (exp(β) = 0.39, p=0.040, 95% CI 0.22, 
0.69) more than halved the odds of a more right-wing score. Being a junior doctor of ST3 
level or above decreased the odds of a more right-wing score relative to all other grades 
(exp(β) = 0.60, p=0.007, 95% CI 0.46, 0.79).   
62.2% described themselves as liberal, slightly or extremely liberal and 23.6% described 
themselves as conservative, slightly or extremely conservative (Figure 2B). Seventy 
participants (6% of total) opted out of the question and entered an alternative descriptive 
term, for example “socialist” or “libertarian”. The only characteristic affecting scores on this 
  
 
11 of 23 
question significantly was income: higher income was associated with increasing odds of 
more conservative views (exp(β) = 1.08, p=0.021, 95% CI 1.03, 1.13).   
 
Previous voting behaviour 
Over half of respondents who voted, did so for either Labour (29.3%) or Conservative 
(26.2%) in the 2015 General Election (Table 2). In the 2017 General Election, the 
percentage of respondents voting Labour increased to 46.3% and the percentage voting 
Conservative fell to 19.7%. The doctors in our sample who voted in both elections showed a 
significant swing away from the Conservatives (6.43%, B = 23.8, p<0.001), in comparison to 
an increase in support from the general public. For those who were not eligible or chose not 
to vote in the 2017 general election, nearly a third (29.6%, 26/88) would have voted for 
Labour, followed by the Liberal Democrats (22.7%, 22/88) and the Conservatives (21.6%, 
19/88). Doctors were far more likely to vote in both elections than the general public.

In the 2016 EU Referendum, 79.4% of respondents voted to remain a part of the EU, 
significantly more than voters as a whole (48.1%) (χ2 = 819.8, p < 0.001). Of those who were 
not eligible or chose not to vote, 85.5% (65/76) would have voted to remain a member of the 
EU. Only 2.1% of eligible doctors in our sample chose not to vote in the referendum 
compared to 27.8% of the electorate. 
Nearly all doctors (98.6%) agreed that EU nationals working in the NHS should be able to 
remain in the UK after leaving the EU. The median score for the impact of Brexit on the NHS 
on a scale of zero (worst impact) to ten (best impact) was 2 (IQR 1 to 4), with 82.7% 
(920/1113) of doctors scoring the impact of Brexit as less than five. There were no 
characteristics associated with significantly different views on the Brexit questions. 
 
Views on health policy issues 
The majority of respondents either strongly or somewhat agreed with the introduction of 
minimum alcohol pricing (73.9%; 95% CI 71.3, 76.4%), charging patients who are not eligible 
for NHS treatment for non-urgent care (70.6%; 95% CI 67.8, 73.2%) and protecting a portion 
of national spending for the NHS (87.1%; 95% CI 85.1, 89.0%) (Figure 3).  
Public health doctors were the only groups associated with significantly different 
(exaggerated) views on the introduction of minimum alcohol pricing, with public health as a 
  
 
13 of 23 
specialty increasing the odds of stronger agreement with this policy by a factor of 
approximately five compared to all other groups (exp(β) = 5.05, p<0.001, 95% CI 2.38, 
10.71). Specialty was also the only characteristic leading to significantly divergent views on 
charging of non-eligible patients for non-urgent care, with being a surgeon multiplying the 
odds of stronger agreement by three compared to the mean of all other specialities (exp(β) = 
2.94, p<0.001, 95% CI 1.81, 4.78). In contrast, being a psychiatrist (exp(β) = 0.36, p<0.001, 
95% CI 0.24, 0.55) or public health doctor (exp(β) = 0.37, p=0.032, 95% CI 0.21, 0.67) 
decreased the odds of agreement. With regard to a protected portion of national spending 
for the NHS funds, the only significant characteristic leading to divergent views was income, 
with the odds of disagreeing with this policy rising with income level (exp(β) = 1.14, p<0.001, 
95% CI 1.08,1.19).   
Finally, nearly two-thirds of respondents (65.8%) thought there was too much use of NHS-
funded private sector provision in their medical practice (Figure 4). The only characteristic 
leading to significantly divergent views on this issue was being a surgeon, which more than 
halved the odds of thinking there was too much use of the private sector (exp(β) = 0.375, 
p=0.023, 95% CI 0.211, 0.622). 
 
DISCUSSION 
This is the first large-scale representative investigation of the political opinions of UK doctors 
to our knowledge. As a group, UK doctors describe themselves as left-wing and liberal. 
There was a significant shift away from voting Conservative between the last two UK general 
elections. Specialty and income were associated with self-reported political views, with being 
a surgeon or having a higher income being associated with more right-wing views and public 
health doctors and psychiatrists being more left-wing minded. Nearly four fifths of 
respondents voted to remain a member of the EU, significantly more than the general 
population, and four out of five doctors assessed the impact of Brexit on the NHS as 
negative. Nearly all doctors agreed that NHS staff who are EU nationals should be able to 
remain in the UK. Views on health policy issues tended to align with more left-wing opinions.

The majority of doctors thought that there was too much use of NHS-funded private sector 
provision, that the UK should introduce minimum alcohol pricing, that there should be a 
protected portion of national spending for the NHS and that patients should be charged for 
non-urgent care if they are not eligible for free NHS treatment. However, specialty and 
income were associated with divergent opinions on these issues.  
We obtained a large and generally representative sample of the UK medical workforce and 
documented their views in relation to specialty, income and place of work. Most respondents 
qualified in the UK and work in the NHS, therefore their responses are likely to be indicative 
of UK practice. Our survey design captured a large number of respondents from across the 
country, specialties and grades, with further targeted sampling for specialty and 
standardisation for region of residence in order to strengthen representativeness. We cannot 
rule out selection bias, particularly with an online format, however we attempted to overcome 
this with additional targeted sampling that enabled us to match the specialty profile of UK 
doctors and standardisation for region. Ideally, we would have adjusted for age as well, 
given the slightly older age profile in our sample compared to the general medical workforce, 
however the information needed to do this was not available. Despite these efforts, it is likely 
that our sample is not fully representative of other dimensions not examined here, meaning 
these results should be only taken as an indication of the views of the UK medical workforce. 
While an online survey software may have exacerbated selection bias, it offers a confidential 
format that reduces the considerable risk of socially desirable responses on these topics, 
particularly as participant identifiers were not collected.18 We acknowledge that our 
questions were a simplification of complex political identities, but the survey was kept 
deliberately short to maximise participation. More comprehensive tools are available, such 
as the Political Compass, and could be considered in future research.19 In particular, the 
numerical scale for left versus right wing scales could have been improved through the use 
of anchoring vignettes or reference points.20 The question we used on liberal versus 
conservative views was designed for an American context and therefore may be less well-
suited to the UK setting, however all terms are common in UK political discourse and were 
  
 
15 of 23 
recognisable and understood readily in our piloting.21 We could not restrict multiple entry of 
data from a single participant or non-UK doctors from taking the survey, however we think 
this is unlikely as the majority of our respondents were GMC-registered members of 
Doctors.net.uk.  
With the challenges imposed on UK health services from leaving the EU now widely 
recognised in the medical community, , the consensus among UK doctors on the negative 
impact of Brexit is perhaps not surprising.22 23 Doctors’ support for EU staff is mirrored in the 
general population, with a recent survey finding that nearly nine out of ten people believe 
that NHS staff from the EU should be allowed to continue working in the UK post-Brexit.24 
With regard to NHS funding and service delivery, 55% of the general public would prefer to 
use a NHS-provided service, up from 39% in the 2014 British Social Attitudes survey.24 25 In 
addition, 88% of the general public believe that the NHS should be tax-funded, remarkably 
similar to the 87.2% of doctors in this sample, with two thirds of the general population 
agreeing that taxes should be increased to fund the NHS, as now suggested by former 
Minister Nick Boles.24 26 We could not identify any similar research on the political opinions of 
healthcare professionals in the UK. In this vacuum, our study has provided evidence for the 
first time on long-held stereotypes on the political views of different medical specialties. 
Indeed, differences in medical specialties have been shown from car ownership to coffee 
purchases, so political opinions may be just an extension of this divergence.27 28  
Our results suggest that the Conservative government lost support from doctors between the 
2015 and 2017 UK general elections. Given that more of the electorate voted Conservative 
in 2017 than in 2015, this suggests that our representative sample of doctors reacted 
differently to the events of the intervening two years than the general population. The 2017 
general election was widely seen as a mandate for the government’s stance on a ‘hard’ 
Brexit, and this swing may therefore reflect doctors’ assessment of largely negative 
consequences of Brexit for the NHS. Doctors would also be acutely aware of the contribution 
of their EU colleagues in the NHS and the impact of continued government ambiguity on the 
status of EU citizens in the UK post-Brexit. Despite the medical and public support for EU 
  
 
16 of 23 
nationals in the NHS, lack of official clarity on their post-Brexit status has likely contributed to 
the 96% reduction in nurses applying to work in the UK since the referendum and growing 
resignations among EU-trained ambulance staff.29 30 Alternatively, the reduction in support 
for the current government may reflect discontent with declines in real wages, reduction in 
NHS and local government funding, and changes to junior doctor contracts.5 10 13 31 
Another finding in this study was broad support for minimum alcohol pricing, which has just 
been introduced in Scotland.32 Strong backing for this policy among doctors from across the 
UK should lend support to its wider implementation. There was overall agreement with the 
policy introduced in 2017 of charging patients not eligible for NHS treatment upfront for non-
urgent care.33 This is despite debate on the practicalities and relevance of this policy, which 
is more likely to affect migrants to the UK rather than so-called “health tourists”.34 35 We 
speculate that the varying views of surgeons compared to psychiatrists and public health 
doctors may be due to a difference in patient interactions, understanding of the overall 
impact of barriers to the health service access, or their underlying political opinions. Finally, 
the finding of political opinions aligned by specialty has implications for medical leaders and 
educationalists. It may be that doctors self-select into specialties with similar views to their 
own. Alternatively, the specialties themselves may reinforce political opinions. It is easy for 
specialists to exist in their own echo chambers, with views reinforced by colleagues and a 
lack of exposure to contrasting viewpoints. This is a trend noted in wider society, with 
concerns that such siloed dialogue leads to greater political polarisation.36 37 Efforts to break 
down stereotypes and engage across specialties may improve multidisciplinary teamworking 
and diversity in specialty recruitment.  
Further work is essential to obtain a better understanding of UK doctors’ political identities, 
particularly the economic and societal differences. This is important as the political ideology 
of doctors has been shown to influence clinical decisions on contentious issues in other 
contexts.38 This study provides a starting point for understanding the political views of 
doctors during a tumultuous period for the UK. Given the health impact of political and 
  
 
17 of 23 
economic decisions, doctors have an important role in public debates; one which might be 
further developed in the public’s interest.
