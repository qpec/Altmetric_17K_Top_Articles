BACKGROUND: Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) is consistently superior 
to clinic blood pressure (CBP) as a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality risk. A common perception is that ABP is usually lower than 
CBP. The relationship of the CBP minus ABP difference to age has not been 
examined in the United States.
METHODS: Between 2005 and 2012, 888 healthy, employed, middle-
aged (mean±SD age, 45±10.4 years) individuals (59% female, 7.4% 
black, 12% Hispanic) with screening BP <160/105 mm 
Hg and not taking 
antihypertensive medication completed 3 separate clinic BP assessments 
and a 24-hour ABP recording for the Masked Hypertension Study. The 
distributions of CBP, mean awake ABP (aABP), and the CBP−aABP difference 
in the full sample and by demographic characteristics were compared. Locally 
weighted scatterplot smoothing was used to model the relationship of the BP 
measures to age and body mass index. The prevalence of discrepancies in 
ABP- versus CBP-defined hypertension status—white-coat hypertension and 
masked hypertension—were also examined.
RESUL
TS: Average systolic/diastolic aABP (123.0/77.4±10.3/7.4 mm 
Hg) 
was significantly higher than the average of 9 CBP readings over 3 visits 
(116.0/75.4±11.6/7.7 mm 
Hg). aABP exceeded CBP by >10 mm 
Hg much 
more frequently than CBP exceeded aABP. The difference (aABP>CBP) was 
most pronounced in young adults and those with normal body mass index. The 
systolic difference progressively diminished, but did not disappear, at older 
ages and higher body mass indexes. The diastolic difference vanished around 
age 65 and reversed (CBP>aABP) for body mass index >32.5 kg/m2. Whereas 
5.3% of participants were hypertensive by CBP, 19.2% were hypertensive by 
aABP; 15.7% of those with nonelevated CBP had masked hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to a widely held belief, based primarily on cohort 
studies of patients with elevated CBP, ABP is not usually lower than CBP, at 
least not among healthy, employed individuals. Furthermore, a substantial 
proportion of otherwise healthy individuals with nonelevated CBP have masked 
hypertension. Demonstrated CBP−aABP gradients, if confirmed in representative 
samples (eg, NHANES [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]), could 
provide guidance for primary care physicians as to when, for a given CBP, 24-
hour ABP would be useful to identify or rule out masked hypertension.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH 
ARTICLE

t
he era of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) 
monitoring (ABPM) was ushered in with the seminal 
1983 article by Perloff et al1 on the prognostic value 
of ABP. During the subsequent 30-plus years, ABPM has 
been assessed in numerous clinical and population co-
horts. The most profound and replicable finding from these 
studies continues to be the superiority of ABP compared 
with clinic BP (CBP) as a correlate of target organ damage 
and a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 
risk (see systematic reviews,2,3 summarized by Siu4). The 
explanation of this finding remains unclear.
The use of ABPM also led to the identification of white-
coat hypertension, which occurs when the CBP is elevat-
ed but the average awake ABP (aABP) is not elevated, 
in cohorts of clinic patients.5 This in turn led to interest 
in the difference between CBP and aABP, often referred 
to as the white-coat effect. Data from numerous cohorts 
of mostly older patients with hypertension or suspected 
hypertension showed that CBP was consistently greater 
than aABP, often by >10 mm 
Hg,6,7 leading to the com-
monly held perception, as codified by the JNC 7 (Sev-
enth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, 
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure), that 
“[A]mbulatory BP values are usually lower than clinic 
readings” (Chobanian et al,8 page 1214).
When the CBP−ABP difference was subsequently ex-
amined in population and community-based samples with 
a broad age range, all from Europe, Japan, China, and 
South America, a different picture emerged. After the 
exclusion of individuals with a history of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and those taking an antihypertensive med-
ication, the average CBP for the full sample was consis-
tently lower than the average aABP. Further analyses,9–12 
broken down by 10-year age cohorts, showed that the 
CBP−aABP difference was most negative in the young-
est cohorts (aABP higher than CBP) and most positive 
in the oldest cohorts (CBP higher than aABP). This was 
confirmed in a meta-analysis of 27 studies and a recent 
analysis of 9550 untreated individuals.13,14 However, the 
relationship between age and the CBP−aABP difference 
has not been examined in the United States. This article 
extends our understanding of the CBP−aABP difference 
by examining for the first time data from a large-scale, 
healthy community sample in the United States and ex-
tending the search for correlates of this difference to 
other demographic factors and body mass index (BMI).
MethOds
The Masked Hypertension Study is a multisite study conducted 
at Stony Brook University and Columbia University. Between 
2005 and 2012, 1011 employees of these 2 universities, their 
medical schools and affiliated hospitals, and a private hedge 
fund management organization enrolled in the study. The study 
adhered to the guidelines set forth by the Declaration of Helsinki 
and was approved by the institutional review boards of Stony 
Brook University and Columbia University Medical Center.
inclusion/exclusion criteria
Recruitment was restricted to employees ≥21 years of age 
who worked ≥17.5 h/wk, spoke and read English, had a pre-
enrollment screening BP of <160/105 mm 
Hg, and were not 
taking a BP-lowering medication. Individuals with evidence of 
secondary hypertension, a history of overt CVD (myocardial 
infarction, stroke, percutaneous transluminal coronary angio-
plasty), or chronic renal, liver, thyroid, or adrenal disease were 
ineligible, as were those with cancer not in remission for at 
least 6 months, active substance abuse, or a serious men-
tal health illness. Those taking any cardiovascular medication 
(other than a statin) and women who were pregnant were also 
ineligible. Diabetes mellitus was not an exclusion criterion.
Protocol
Recruitment took place on a department-by-department basis 
within each organization. With the permission and support of 
the department head, on-site public health BP screenings were 
conducted by study personnel. All employees were invited to 
have their BP taken (3 readings taken in accordance with the 
American Heart Association guidelines). During the 2-minute 
intervals between readings, the study was briefly described, 
highlighting the findings that ABP can differ substantially from 
CBP and that ABP is a better predictor than CBP of cardiovas-
cular risk. Those with a screening BP (mean of the second and 
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• Contrary to common wisdom, we find that mean 
awake ambulatory blood pressure (BP) is typically 
higher than clinic BP in cardiovascular disease–free, 
employed people not being treated for hyperten-
sion; this difference is observed in men and women, 
blacks and nonblacks, and Hispanics and non-His-
panics and is especially pronounced in younger indi-
viduals and those with lower body mass index.
• Approximately 16% of those who have nonelevated 
BP in the clinic setting, averaged over 3 visits, have 
elevated average awake ambulatory BP and there-
fore have masked hypertension.
What are the clinical implications?
• Among those individuals without a diagnosis of 
hypertension who are seen in a primary care setting, 
perhaps especially for a well-patient visit, physicians 
should probably be more concerned that the clinic 
BP underestimates, rather than overestimates, the 
patient’s average daytime BP.
• Given the substantial evidence that an elevated average 
awake BP over the course of the day increases one’s 
risk for a cardiovascular event, regardless of one’s BP in 
the clinic setting, it is likely that many adults, especially 
those with prehypertension in the clinic, would benefit 
from completing a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring.

third readings) that was <160/105 mm 
Hg who were not taking 
BP-lowering medication and had no history of overt CVD (eg, 
myocardial infarction, cardiac/coronary surgery, stroke) were 
invited to provide their name and contact information for future 
recruitment. (BP screenings were not conducted at the hedge 
fund management firm. Instead, a public presentation about 
the study was made to all employees, and those interested in 
potentially participating provided contact information. Eligibility 
was confirmed during the phone screen, and the BP screening 
criterion was confirmed at the beginning of visit 1.) Individuals 
who provided this information were subsequently contacted 
by phone, at which time the study protocol was described in 
detail and full eligibility was ascertained. Those who agreed to 
participate were then scheduled for the first of 5 study visits 
(Figure 1) and mailed the study’s informed consent document 
to review.
At visit 1, individuals provided signed informed consent 
and then had their CBP taken by a trained technician using 
a mercury column sphygmomanometer (Baum, Copiague, NY) 
and stethoscope. The technician confirmed that the participant 
had not smoked, eaten, or consumed a caffeinated beverage 
during the prior 30 minutes and then measured the arm cir-
cumference of the nondominant arm. After being seated com-
fortably for a minimum of 5 minutes, the participant was asked 
to remain still, feet flat on the floor and back supported, and 
to not talk while 3 BP readings were taken at 1- to 2-minute 
intervals on the nondominant arm with an appropriately sized 
BP cuff. The participant was given an extensive psychosocial 
questionnaire to complete at home and was asked to return it 
by visit 3.
Visit 2 was scheduled for 1 week later (on a different day of 
the week and time of day), when the same protocol was used 
to measure CBP. Visit 3 was scheduled another week later and 
began with CBP being assessed for the third and final time. The 
participant was then fitted with a 24-hour ABPM (SpaceLabs 
90207, Snoqualamie, WA), a waist actigraphy device (Actical, 
Philips Respironics, Bend, OR) to assess physical activity, 
and a wrist actigraphy device (ActiWatch, Philips Respironics, 
Bend, OR) to assess sleep onset/offset and sleep duration. 
Participants were provided a preprogrammed electronic diary 
(Palm Pilot Tungsten 3) in which they were asked to answer 
questions after each BP reading about their situation, activities, 
affect, and social interactions immediately before the reading. 
Participants wore the equipment for 24 hours, returning it the 
next day (visit 4). At this time, they were scheduled for visit 5.
During visit 5, a comprehensive medical history, includ-
ing family history of major disorders, was obtained by inter-
view. Participants were also interviewed about their smoking 
history and completed a health activities questionnaire and 
health-related quality-of-life questionnaire (Short Form-36).15 
Height and weight (no shoes, light clothing) and skinfolds were 
measured. A fasting blood sample was obtained, and urinary 
albumin and creatinine were measured from a complete over-
night urine collection (all voids after going to sleep and first 
morning void after awakening). A 12-lead ECG was obtained, 
and a research 2-dimensional echocardiogram was performed. 
Visits 1 through 4 always took place on a workday, and all 
visits were conducted at either the hospital clinical research 
center or the clinical offices at our laboratory.
BP Measures
The average of the participant’s 3 BP readings taken at visit 
1 is comparable to the assessment of CBP in most epidemio-
logical studies. The average of the 9 readings from visits 1 
through 3 provides a more robust measure of CBP and is the 
measure used in most of our analyses. For comparability with 
prior studies, some results are also presented for the visit 1 
CBP measure.
The ABP monitor was programmed to take readings at 
28-minute intervals, and participants were told that readings 
would be taken every 25 to 30 minutes. Although it is more 
typical to use 15-, 20-, or 30-minute intervals, 28 minutes 
was deliberately chosen to ensure that readings were not 
taken at the same time each hour, thereby reducing par-
ticipants’ ability to anticipate when the next reading would 
occur. On the basis of the manufacturer’s recommendation, 
systolic BP readings outside the range of 70 mm Hg (60 
mm Hg during sleep) to 250 mm Hg and diastolic readings 
outside the range of 40 mm Hg (30 mm Hg during sleep) to 
150 mm Hg were treated as errors. Participants completed 
a device log, recording the times that they went to sleep, 
woke up, took a nap, or removed any of the equipment 
(eg, to exercise or shower). The Actiware software (Philips 
Respironics) was used to analyze the Actiwatch recording 
and, in conjunction with the self-report times, arrive at a 
best estimate of sleep onset and awakening. From these 
times, the average aABP and average sleep ABP were com-
puted. Consistent with the IDACO (International Database on 
ABPM in Relation to Cardiovascular Outcomes),16 a minimum 
of 10 valid readings were required to compute the aver-
age aABP, and a minimum of 5 valid sleep readings were 
required to compute the average sleep (nighttime) ABP. Of 
the 893 participants who were fitted with an ABPM device, 
only 5 had <10 valid awake readings, leaving a final sample 
size of 888 participants for analysis. They had an average 
of 44.3 valid readings (SD, ±7.6; range, 10–60), and 93.1% 
(±8.0) of attempted BP readings were successful on either 
the first try or the automatic retry 2 minutes later; the aver-
age number of valid awake readings was 32.1 (±5.0; range, 
10–43). Seventy-five participants did not wear the device 
to bed, and another 41 had <5 valid sleep readings; the 
remaining 772 participants had an average of 13.5 (±3.1; 
range, 5–21) valid sleep readings.

hypertension categories (BP Phenotypes)
Those with a systolic CBP ≥140 mm 
Hg or diastolic CBP ≥90 
mm 
Hg were classified as having clinic-based hypertension; 
those with systolic CBP <140 mm 
Hg and diastolic CBP <90 
mm 
Hg were classified as having nonelevated CBP or normo-
tension. The corresponding systolic/diastolic aABP thresholds 
used for the diagnosis of ABP-defined hypertension are 135/85 
mm 
Hg.8,17,18 Those with elevated CBP and nonelevated aABP 
were classified as having white-coat hypertension; those with 
nonelevated CBP and elevated aABP were classified as hav-
ing masked hypertension; those whose CBP and aABP were 
either both elevated or both nonelevated were classified as 
having sustained hypertension or sustained normotension, 
respectively.
statistical analysis
The CBP−aABP difference and how it varies in relationship to 
other factors cannot be understood without also examining 
CBP and aABP separately. Accordingly, we describe and com-
pare the distributions of each—CBP, aABP, and the CBP−aABP 
difference—in the sample as a whole and by demographic 
characteristics. We used t tests and ANOVA to test for group 
differences in means; paired t tests were used to compare CBP 
and aABP in the same participant for the full sample and within 
subgroups. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) 
with iterative reweighting was used to model the relationship 
of the BP measures to age and BMI. The prevalence of each 
BP phenotype (sustained normotension, white-coat hyperten-
sion, masked hypertension, and sustained hypertension) was 
calculated. Finally, a LOESS logistic model summarizing how 
the probability of an elevated systolic aABP (ie, ≥135 mm 
Hg) 
varies in relationship to the systolic CBP was estimated in 
the subsample of those with nonelevated CBP; the same was 
done for diastolic BP. After multiple imputation for missing 
visit 5 data using the fully conditional specification approach,19 
multivariable regression models predicting the CBP−aABP dif-
ference in the full sample and logistic regression models pre-
dicting elevated awake systolic and diastolic ABP and masked 
hypertension status in those with nonelevated CBP were esti-
mated. ANCOVA was used to examine differences among BP 
phenotypes in echocardiography-defined left ventricular mass 
index (calculated according to the standard American Society 
of Echocardiography formula,20 indexed by estimated body 
surface error) and overnight urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. 
A 2-tailed value of P=0.05 was used to judge statistical signifi-
cance. All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
resUlts
Approximately 2600 employees participated in the on-
site BP screenings (Figure 2). Of these, 1931 appeared 
potentially eligible, of whom 89.1% provided contact 
information. Phone screens were conducted with 1699 
individuals (including 54 from the financial organization 
where BP screenings were not conducted), and 1254 
met all eligibility criteria. A total of 1011 individuals 
(80.6% of those who were eligible) enrolled in the study 
and completed visit 1; 904 (89.4%) had CBP assessed 
on 3 separate occasions (visits 1, 2, and 3); 893 wore 
the ABPM (888 had ≥10 valid awake readings; 773 had 
≥5 valid sleep readings); and 842 (83.3%) completed 
the cardiovascular evaluation (visit 5).
The sample is middle-aged (mean age, 45.0 years; 
SD, 10.4), 59% female, 7.4% black/African American, 
and 12% Hispanic, with an average BMI of 27.6 kg/m2 
(SD, 5.3 kg/m2). In the medical history interview, 3.6% 
reported having diabetes mellitus (see Table 1). Table I in

the online-only Data Supplement compares the 888 par-
ticipants with a valid ABPM recording with the 123 who 
enrolled in the study but withdrew before completing the 
ABPM (n=118) or had <10 valid aABP readings (n=5). 
Although those who withdrew were younger and more 
likely to be black or Hispanic, there were no differences 
in sex or CBP.
The mean of the visit 1 systolic/diastolic CBP (aver-
age of 3 readings) was 116.1/76.0 mm 
Hg (SD, 12.9/8.9 
mm 
Hg), whereas the mean pooled across all 3 visits (9 
readings in total) was 116.0/75.4 mm 
Hg (SD, 11.6/7.7 
mm 
Hg). The mean of the average awake and average 
sleep ABPs was 123.0/77.4 mm 
Hg (SD, 10.3/7.4 
mm 
Hg) and 106.2/61.9 mm 
Hg (SD, 10.5/7.7 mm 
Hg), 
respectively. The histograms shown in Figure 3 illustrate 
how the entire distribution of aABP is shifted upward, es-
pecially for systolic BP (Figure 3A), relative to that for CBP 
(mean of 3 visits). Systolic and diastolic aABPs were 7.0 
mm 
Hg (SD, 8.0 mm 
Hg) and 2.0 mm 
Hg (SD, 6.5 mm 
Hg) 
higher than CBP (both P<0.0001 by paired t test). Fig-
ure 3C and 3D shows that CBP minus aABP is approxi-
mately normally distributed for both systolic and diastolic 
BPs. Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement shows 
Bland-Altman plots for systolic and diastolic BPs, showing 
that the CBP−aABP difference is relatively uncorrelated 
with the average and that the variance of the difference 
is fairly homogeneous across levels of BP. Table 2 sum-
marizes information about the distribution of difference 
scores. More than one third of participants had a systolic 
aABP that exceeded their CBP by at least 10 mm 
Hg, 
whereas only 2.5% had a systolic CBP that exceeded their 
aABP by this much, a ratio of nearly 14:1. For diastolic BP, 
more than twice as many participants had an aABP that 
exceeded their CBP by at least 5 mm 
Hg (32.4%) as had 
a CBP that exceeded their aABP by this amount (14.2%). 
Table II in the online-only Data Supplement provides the 
correlations among CBP readings at each visit, the 3-visit 
average, and the mean awake and sleep ABP.
We next examine how CBP, aABP, and the CBP−aABP 
difference vary by sex, race, ethnicity, and BMI. As ex-
pected, men had higher BPs (both CBP and aABP) than 
women, blacks had higher BP than nonblacks (although 
the differences were not statistically significant because 
of the relatively small number of black participants), and 
those who were overweight or obese had higher BP than 
those with a normal BMI (Table 3). Hispanics tended to 
have lower systolic BP than non-Hispanics, but the differ-
ence was only statistically significant for systolic aABP. 
Although the subgroup differences in CBP were some-
what larger than in aABP, the CBP−aABP difference did 
not significantly differ by sex, race, or ethnicity; there 
was, however, a tendency for the diastolic CBP−aABP 
difference to be more negative (ie, aABP greater than 
CBP) for women than men (P=0.051). (Smoking status 
[never, past, current] was not significantly associated 
with systolic or diastolic CBP, aABP, or the CBP−aABP dif-
ference; results not shown.) In contrast, the CBP−aABP 
difference varied considerably with BMI. It was most 
negative for the normal BMI group and smallest for the 
obese group; the difference in diastolic BP was slightly 
positive in the obese group.

It is generally recognized that one factor contributing 
to the finding that ABP is a superior predictor of adverse 
cardiovascular events compared with CBP is that many 
studies assessed CBP only at a single visit. Averaging 
CBP across multiple visits increases the reliability of 
the measure by reducing the impact of visit-to-visit vari-
ability. This increased reliability is in turn expected to 
result in statistically stronger associations between CBP 
and other measures (predictors/correlates of CBP, ABP, 
and outcomes). This expectation is shown in Table 3, in 
which a comparison of the t and F statistics for the 2 
versions of CBP demonstrates that the associations of 
demographic factors and BMI with CBP were stronger 
when CBP was measured as the average across 3 visits 
(9 readings) instead of just 1 visit (3 readings). Similarly, 
Table II in the online-only Data Supplement shows that 
the correlations of CBP with aABP and mean sleep ABP 
were higher for the 3-visit average CBP than for the sin-
gle-visit CBP measures.
LOESS models were used to examine the relationship 
of CBP, aABP, and the CBP−aABP difference with age 
and BMI, treated continuously. As shown in Figure 4A, the 
age gradients of systolic aABP and CBP were nonlinear, 
becoming steeper at higher ages. The difference (CBP 
being lower than aABP) was greatest for those who were 
young, but the age gradient of CBP was steeper than 
that of aABP, especially after 50 years of age, resulting

in a steadily decreasing difference at older ages. In this 
study, the systolic CBP−aABP difference was significantly 
 
negative (ie, aABP>CBP) for all ages between 21 and 70 
years. Figure 4B contains the corresponding results for di-
astolic BP. It shows the curvilinear relationships of diastolic 
CBP and aABP with age, with the gradient being steeper 
for CBP than aABP after ≈45 years of age; the diastolic 
aABP was significantly higher than diastolic CBP for all 
ages <60 years. LOESS models of the systolic and dia-
stolic CBP−aABP differences in relation to age are shown 
in Figure IIA and IIB in the online-only Data Supplement).
Figure 4 also shows the relationships of CBP and 
aABP to BMI (Figure 4C and 4D). Systolic and diastolic 
aABPs were substantially higher than CBP for BMI levels 
<25 kg/m2. The differences in systolic BP diminished at 
increasing levels of BMI but remained statistically signifi-
cant up to ≈43 kg/m2; however, the diastolic CBP−aABP 
difference became positive for BMI values of ≥32.5 kg/
m2, and this difference was statistically significant for 
BMI levels >35 kg/m2. Again, the LOESS models for the 
CBP−aABP difference are shown in Figure IIC and IID in 
the online-only Data Supplement.

In multivariable regression models, age and BMI con-
tinue to be significantly associated with the CBP−aABP 
difference in both systolic and diastolic BPs. After taking 
the square root of BMI, its relationship to the CBP−aABP 
is approximately linear for both BP measures. The re-
lationship of age to the CBP−aABP differences in sys-
tolic and diastolic BPs is significantly different for men 
and women. Table III in the online-only Data Supplement 
shows estimates for models that include all predictors 
(full model) and for parsimonious models in which non-
significant factors (P≥0.10) have been removed. Figure 
III in the online-only Data Supplement portrays the rela-
tionship of age to the systolic and diastolic CBP−aABP 
differences for men and women. As in the bivariate 
analyses, black race and smoking status were not as-
sociated with the systolic and diastolic CBP−aABP dif-
ferences; Hispanic ethnicity was marginally associated 
with the systolic CBP−aABP difference (P=0.09, with the 
difference being 1.35 mm 
Hg less negative for Hispan-
ics) only.
diagnostic categories (BP Phenotypes)
In this sample of individuals who were free of CVD, did not 
screen positive for stage 2 hypertension, and were not 
taking any BP-lowering medication, 5.3% of the sample 
were hypertensive by CBP (ie, ≥140/90 mm 
Hg, based 
on the average of 9 readings across 3 visits), whereas 
19.1% were hypertensive by aABP (ie, ≥135/85 mm 
Hg). 
The prevalences of sustained normotension, masked 
hypertension, white-coat hypertension, and sustained hy-
pertension were 79.8%, 14.9%, 1.0%, and 4.3%, respec-
tively. Although 84.1% had the same diagnosis by aABP 
as by CBP, the κ statistic was only 0.29 (95% confidence 
interval, 0.21–0.37), indicating only poor or fair agree-
ment between the 2 diagnoses.21,22 Of particular interest, 
132 (15.7%) of the 841 participants (15.7%) who were 
normotensive on the basis of their CBP had masked hy-
pertension (aABP ≥135/85 mm 
Hg); 9 (19.1%) of the 47 
participants who were hypertensive by CBP had white-
coat hypertension (aABP <135/85 mm 
Hg). Of those with 
masked hypertension, 49 had both elevated systolic and 
elevated diastolic aABPs, whereas 55 had only elevated 
diastolic aABP and 28 had only elevated systolic aABP.
The probability of having masked hypertension is 
not the same for all individuals with nonelevated CBP. 
Figure 5 presents plots based on LOESS logistic analy-
ses of the 841 participants whose systolic and diastolic 
CBPs were both not elevated, showing the predicted 
likelihood of an elevated systolic (Figure 5A) or diastolic 
(Figure 5B) aABP for individuals with different values of 
CBP. It shows, for example, that 10% of those whose 
average systolic CBP over 3 visits was 120 mm 
Hg were 
expected to have a systolic aABP ≥135 mm 
Hg; this in-
creased to 34% for those with a systolic CBP of 130 
mm 
Hg and exceeded 50% for those with a systolic CBP 
of ≥135 mm 
Hg. Similarly, 20% of those whose average 
diastolic CBP over 3 visits was 80 mm 
Hg were expected 
to have a diastolic aABP ≥85 mm 
Hg, and this increased 
to >50% for those whose diastolic CBP was ≥87 mm 
Hg. 
Tables 4 and 5 show the observed probability of hav-
ing masked hypertension for different combinations of 
systolic and diastolic CBPs, depending on whether CBP 
is based on a single visit (Table 4) or 3 visits (Table 5).
Men with nonelevated CBP were more likely than wom-
en to have systolic aABP ≥135 mm 
Hg, diastolic aABP 
≥85 mm 
Hg, and masked hypertension (all P<0.0001). 
Black race, ethnicity, and smoking status were not signif-
icantly associated (all P>0.10). BMI was positively asso-
ciated with systolic aABP ≥135 mm 
Hg (P<0.0001) and

≥85 mm 
Hg (P=0.35). Age was positively associated 
with systolic aABP ≥135 mm 
Hg (P<0.0001), with no dif-
ference between men and women. Age was positively 
associated with diastolic aABP ≥85 mm

hypertension for men (P=0.004 and P<0.0001) but cur-
vilinearly (inverse U shape) related for women (P=0.02 
and P=0.04).
CBP is overwhelmingly the strongest predictor of 
who will have elevated aABP and masked hypertension. 
After controlling for the relationship of systolic CBP with 
systolic aABP ≥135, there was a significant sex×age 
interaction such that age was independently related to 
elevated systolic aABP for men only (P=0.009); BMI 
was no longer associated (Table IV in the online-only 
Data Supplement). After the relationship of diastolic 
CBP to diastolic aABP ≥85 mm Hg was controlled for, 
systolic CBP (P=0.02) was positively associated and 
BMI (P=0.002) was negatively associated. There was 
a significant sex×age interaction (P=0.008) such that 
with increasing age women were less likely (P=0.02) 
and men were marginally more likely (P=0.07) to have 
elevated diastolic aABP. Both systolic and diastolic 
CBPs were strong predictors of masked hypertension 
(both P<0.0001). After these factors were controlled 
for, there was again a significant sex×age interaction 
(P=0.003) such that with increasing age women were 
marginally less likely (P=0.06) and men were substan-
tially more likely (P=0.006) to have masked hyperten-
sion (Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement).
associations of BP Phenotypes With target 
Organ damage
The average left ventricular mass index among those 
with masked hypertension was significantly higher 
than among sustained normotensives but significantly 
lower than in those with sustained hypertension (Table 
V in the online-only Data Supplement). There were 
no significant differences in log-transformed urinary 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio among the BP phenotypes 
(P=0.64).
discUssiOn
In this relatively large US sample of employed adults 
free of CVD who had a pre-enrollment screening BP 
<160/105 mm Hg and were not taking an antihyper-
tensive medication, ABP was not usually lower than 
CBP. We found that, on average, systolic aABP was 
7 mm Hg higher than CBP and diastolic aABP was 2 
mm Hg higher. Examination of the distribution of the 
difference between CBP and aABP revealed that aABP 
exceeded CBP by ≥10 mm Hg in nearly 35% of par-
ticipants and 9% had a comparably large diastolic 
difference. In contrast, CBP exceeded aABP by this 
amount in only 2.5% (systolic) and 4.2% (diastolic) of 
participants. Thus, although the view that ABP is usu-
ally lower than CBP may well hold for older individuals 
with elevated CBP,8 especially those being treated for 
hypertension and those wearing an ABPM to rule out

white-coat hypertension, it is not true in this sample or, 
we suspect, in the general US adult population.
This study confirms findings from non-US population/
community studies that the CBP−aABP difference varies 
systematically with age.9-13 The difference, with aABP be-
ing higher than CBP, is most pronounced in young adults 
and progressively diminishes at older ages. However, un-
like most prior studies in which the difference crossed 
zero and CBP began to exceed aABP somewhere be-
tween 50 and 60 years of age, this never happened for 
systolic BP and happened for diastolic BP only in those 
above the normal retirement age. Importantly, the number 
of individuals >65 years of age in our sample was small, 
and by design, all such individuals were employed. Fur-
ther research is needed to determine whether this pattern 
would hold in other samples of employed individuals (eg, 
in other types of occupations and organizations or outside 
the New York metropolitan area) or in a representative 
sample of employed, nonemployed, and retired individu-
als. The inclusion of ABPM in the US NHANES (National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) would allow 
these and other questions to be addressed.
This is one of only a handful of studies to compare the 
BMI gradients for CBP and aABP. The CBP−aABP differ-
ence was greatest, with aABP being higher than CBP, for 
those with low BMI and became progressively smaller at 
increasing levels of BMI. For systolic BP, there was no 
level of BMI at which CBP exceeded aABP, whereas for 
diastolic BP, CBP began to exceed aABP at 32.5 kg/m2 
and became significantly greater at a BMI of ≈35 kg/m2. 
The CBP−aABP difference was similar for men versus 
women, blacks versus nonblacks, Hispanics versus non-
Hispanics, and cigarette smokers versus past smokers 
versus never smokers.
One plausible explanation for the finding that the age 
and BMI gradients of aABP are less steep than the cor-
responding gradients for CBP is that younger individu-
als and those with lower BMI are more physically active, 
raising their aABP substantially above their resting BP. 
In essence, physical activity might be suppressing the 
associations of aABP with age and BMI. This potential 
suppressor effect of physical activity on the relationship 
of ABP to age and BMI is an important topic for future 
research, which we hope to address in a future analysis 
of the actigraphy data collected in this study.
Multivariate regression analyses confirmed the inde-
pendent associations of age and BMI with the systolic 
and diastolic CBP−aABP differences. They also revealed 
that the relationship of age to the difference is different 
for men and women.
Ideally, primary care physicians will find the results 
presented here useful when evaluating the BP of a pa-
tient during a well-care visit/physical examination. The 
physician’s dilemma is that she/he knows only the pa-
tient’s CBP, but it is the ABP that is most prognostic. 
Knowing that if the patient is young or has a low BMI, 
his/her ABP is likely to be considerably higher than the 
CBP could inform the decision of whether to recommend 
a 24-hour ABPM. On the other hand, if the patient is 60 
years old and mildly obese, then the CBP may be rela-
tively unbiased.
Only 5% of our sample met criteria for hypertension 
based on CBP, whereas 19% had hypertension based on 
their aABP. Furthermore, only 1% met criteria for white-
coat hypertension, and 14.9% met criteria for masked 
hypertension. Although the goal of the 2011 UK National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline and the 
recent US Preventive Services Task Force recommen-
dation that ABPM be performed in those with elevated 
CBP to rule out white-coat hypertension and to reduce 
unnecessary treatment is laudable and apparently cost-
effective,4,23 the present study points to the potential 
utility of ABPM for identifying the sizeable number of indi-
viduals with masked hypertension who are normotensive 
in the clinic setting but have average daytime BPs that 
exceed the threshold for hypertension. Prior research 
has shown that these individuals have target organ dam-
age and are at risk for future adverse cardiovascular 
events at rates that exceed those with sustained normo-
tension (ie, nonelevated CBP and nonelevated aABP) and 
are similar to those with sustained hypertension,24–27 and 
this is supported by recent findings from the US Dallas 
Heart Study (using home BP monitoring) and Jackson 
Heart Study.28,29 In the present study, the average left 
ventricular mass index of those with masked hyperten-
sion exceeded that for sustained normotensives but was 
lower than for sustained hypertensives. Although there 
is a prima facie case for initiating lifestyle changes or 
BP-lowering medication in individuals with masked hy-
pertension, there is, in our opinion, an urgent need for 
randomized, clinical trials testing the effect of potential 
interventions on cardiovascular risk in this population.
Individuals with low CBPs are unlikely to have masked 
hypertension because this would require a very large 
difference between CBP and aABP for aABP to reach 
the ambulatory hypertension threshold. As the CBP in-
creases, it becomes increasing likely that the aABP will 
exceed the threshold for hypertension. This pattern 
probably explains much of the variability in previously 
published prevalence estimates of masked hyperten-
sion. For example, Viera and colleagues30 reported a 
prevalence of 43%, but their sample was restricted to 
individuals who screened positive for prehypertension 
and had a study CBP ≥110/70 mm 
Hg. This excludes 
those with the lowest probability of having masked hy-
pertension and results in a prevalence estimate that is 
considerably higher than that of the general population 
with nonelevated CBP. Again, inclusion of ABPM in the 
NHANES would yield a definitive estimate of the masked 
hypertension prevalence in the US general population.
Sex (male), age (especially for men), BMI, and systolic 
and diastolic CBPs were associated with an increased

likelihood of having masked hypertension; smoking sta-
tus, black race, and ethnicity were not. With the excep-
tion of smoking, these findings are consistent with the 
recent systematic review by Sheppard et al31 (see their 
Figure 2, page 622). Controlling for CBP, the risk of hav-
ing an elevated systolic aABP, elevated diastolic aABP, 
or masked hypertension increases with age for men 
(odds ratio >1.0) but decreases with age for women 
(odds ratio <1.0). Although the association with sex dif-
fers by age, men are at greater risk overall than women. 
There was also an independent association of BMI with 
the risk of elevated diastolic aABP only; black race, His-
panic ethnicity, and smoking status were not significant 
independent predictors.
When we initiated the Masked Hypertension Study, we 
were concerned that one factor that might contribute to 
inflated estimates of the prevalence of masked hyper-
tension and white-coat hypertension (and the superiority 
of ABP over CBP for predicting outcomes) could be the 
poor reliability of the CBP measure, even when taken 
according to American Heart Association guidelines.32 
Readings from a single visit, no matter how carefully 
taken, cannot adjust for the well-documented visit-to-visit 
variability in CBP.33 This is why we assessed CBP at 3 
separate visits. Although not a central focus of the pres-
ent analysis, the information in Table 3 and Table II in 
the online-only Data Supplement illustrates the increased 
reliability for CBP that results from averaging the 9 BP 
readings from 3 clinic visits compared with the more typ-
ical 3 readings taken at a single visit. These tables show 
that the associations of CBP with demographic factors 
and BMI are more clearly revealed with the average of 
3 visits rather than a single visit. Similarly, the correla-
tions of CBP with mean aABP and mean sleep ABP are 
stronger for the 3-visit measure of CBP than for any of 
the single-visit measures of CBP.
The Masked Hypertension Study has several 
strengths. In the absence of a nationally representative 
US sample in which ABPM has been performed, this 
is one of the largest community samples with 24-hour 
ABPM in the United States. The sample was relatively 
healthy, with no evidence of overt CVD (myocardial in-
farction, stroke, congestive heart failure), no use of 
cardiovascular medications (except statins), and no 
use of BP-lowering agents. Therefore, this sample in-
cludes those individuals whom primary care physicians 
are likely to see for well-patient visits, an occasion at 
which screening for hypertension is nearly universal. All 
participants had employer-provided health insurance; 
therefore, lack of access to care cannot account for the 
findings. Furthermore, CBP was assessed on 3 separate 
visits, with 3 research-quality readings taken at each vis-
it, and the average of all 9 readings provides a more reli-
able measure of CBP than readings from a single visit. 
However, the high quality of the CBP assessments limits 
the applicability of our findings, indeed those of almost 
all ABP studies, to the typical primary care setting. As 
others have repeatedly bemoaned,34,35 the assessment 
of CBP in usual care is often seriously flawed, deviating 
procedurally from recommended guidelines. The extent 
to which our results might inform the difference between 
usual care CBPs and ABPs is not known.
Although the present findings contribute to a better 
understanding of the difference between CBP and aABP 
in generally healthy individuals, the study is not without 
limitations. First, the sample is not representative of 
the general population. Participants were all employed 
and had employer-provided health insurance. Second, 
the exclusion of nonemployed individuals resulted in 
relatively few individuals >65 years of age, the group 
in which hypertension is most prevalent. Although the 
sample is well suited to examine the CBP−aABP differ-
ence for individuals with nonelevated CBP, with only 5% 
of participants having elevated CBP (≥140/90 mm 
Hg), 
it is less useful for examining the difference between 
CBP and ABP in the clinically important population of 
individuals with elevated CBP. This study is also unable 
to address the CBP−aABP difference among those tak-
ing an antihypertensive medication. The study did not 
perform home BP monitoring; therefore, the findings 
may not be relevant to the CBP−home BP difference 
or the prevalence and correlates of masked hyperten-
sion defined by home BP instead of aABP. Third, the 
exclusion of those with a screening BP ≥160/105 
mm 
Hg who were not taking medication may introduce 
a slight bias; however, only 25 of the 2591 screened 
individuals were excluded solely for this reason. The 
underrepresentation of blacks in the sample is unfor-
tunate. It is similarly unfortunate that minority (black 
and Hispanic) participants were more likely to withdraw 
from the study before completing the 24-hour ABPM. 
Importantly, attrition was not associated with BP levels 
at either visit 1 or 2. Future population-level research 
that includes ABPM, again as in the US NHANES, would 
address these issues. 
In contrast to previous large cohort studies of patients 
with elevated CBP and thus to a widely held belief of clini-
cians, ABP is not usually lower than CBP in healthy, em-
ployed individuals. Furthermore, a substantial number of 
otherwise healthy individuals have masked hypertension 
that may warrant treatment or at least monitoring. Dem-
onstrated CBP−aABP gradients, if confirmed in studies 
with more diverse samples (eg, NHANES), may provide 
guidance for primary care physicians as to when a given 
CBP indicates the need for ABPM to identify masked hy-
pertension.
