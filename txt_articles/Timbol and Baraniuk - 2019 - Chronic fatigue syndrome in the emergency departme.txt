Purpose: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating disease characterized by fatigue, 
postexertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and widespread pain. A pilot, 
online survey was used to determine the common presentations of CFS patients in the emergency 
department (ED) and attitudes about their encounters.
Methods: The anonymous survey was created to score the severity of core CFS symptoms, 
reasons for going to the ED, and Likert scales to grade attitudes and impressions of care. Open 
text fields were qualitatively categorized to determine common themes about encounters.
Results: Fifty-nine percent of respondents with physician-diagnosed CFS (total n=282) had 
gone to an ED. One-third of ED presentations were consistent with orthostatic intolerance; 42% 
of participants were dismissed as having psychosomatic complaints. ED staff were not knowl-
edgeable about CFS. Encounters were unfavorable (3.6 on 10-point scale). The remaining 41% 
of subjects did not go to ED, stating nothing could be done or they would not be taken seriously. 
CFS subjects can be identified by a CFS questionnaire and the prolonged presence (>6 months) 
of unremitting fatigue, cognitive, sleep, and postexertional malaise problems.
Conclusion: This is the first investigation of the presentation of CFS in the ED and indicates 
the importance of orthostatic intolerance as the most frequent acute cause for a visit. The self-
report CFS questionnaire may be useful as a screening instrument in the ED. Education of 
ED staff about modern concepts of CFS is necessary to improve patient and staff satisfaction. 
Guidance is provided for the diagnosis and treatment of CFS in these challenging encounters.

Introduction
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating condition that can present with a 
myriad of somatic symptoms in the emergency department (ED).1 We examined these 
presentations in a cross-sectional manner using an online questionnaire in physician-
diagnosed CFS subjects. Patients’ comments about their ED experiences were qualita-
tively assessed. These findings are relevant to the unique, time-consuming challenges 
of the CFS patient–ED physician interaction in the fast-paced environment of the ED.
Patient satisfaction studies have examined ED-related factors such as wait time,2 
time pressure and frequent interruptions,3 staff knowledge levels, and accurate informa-
tion delivery to the patient.4,5 These factors negatively impact the quality of interactions 
and lead to patient dissatisfaction.6 Disease-specific factors are less well evaluated. 
The skepticism about the psychological underpinnings of CFS and the high rates of 
depression and anxiety in ED patients7,8 have the potential to lead to misdiagnosis

of CFS as a psychosomatic disorder. Staff have negative 
attitudes toward patients with poorly understood conditions 
such as substance abuse9 and CFS. The limited information 
and ongoing debate into the etiology of CFS has contributed 
to patient experiences of stigmatization and delegitimization 
by health care providers and loved ones.10,11 These factors 
make it imperative to understand the presentation of CFS in 
the ED and to educate ED staff about CFS.
The most commonly used definition is the 1994 Centers for 
Disease Control “Fukuda” criteria of >6 months of disabling 
fatigue (>50% reduction in activity or productivity) plus four of 
eight ancillary consensus complaints: 1) short-term memory or 
concentration problems, 2) sore throat, 3) sore lymph nodes, 4) 
myalgia, 5) arthralgia, 6) headache with onset after the fatigue, 
7) sleep disturbances, and 8) postexertional malaise (PEM).12 
Exclusion of chronic medical and psychiatric diseases is an 
important step for clarifying the ambiguities in this defini-
tion.13,14 Older traditions included neurasthenia as a psychiatric 
component15 and acute viral infections with low-grade fever 
that did not resolve within 6 months.16 The infectious legacy 
remains in the International Classification of Diseases revision 
10 coding of CFS as “Post-viral fatigue syndrome” (G93.3).17 
However, this may not encompass gradual onset, disabling 
fatigue. The newer Canadian Consensus Criteria emphasize 
PEM, add autonomic dysfunction and orthostatic intolerance 
(eg, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome )18 to the criteria, 
and advocate maintaining the name myalgic encephalomyeli-
tis.19,20 An evidence-based analysis by the Institute of Medi-
cine renamed the syndrome “Systemic Exertion Intolerance 
Disease” to emphasize the disability, fatigue, PEM, cognitive 
dysfunction, and orthostatic intolerance.21–23
To date, no studies have examined CFS in the ED. We have 
operationalized the 1994 CFS criteria as an online questionnaire 
that can quickly provide guidance about the diagnosis.24 This 
instrument was used to assess CFS symptom severity in a cross-
sectional online population and to distinguish CFS from chronic 
idiopathic fatigue (significant fatigue without other symptoms) 
and CFS-like with insufficient fatigue (positive review of sys-
tems but without fatigue) subjects.25 Additional questions that 
were evaluated may help distinguish CFS from other conditions 
in the differential diagnosis26 such as depression14 and Gulf War 
Illness.27 Free text comments were analyzed to describe attitudes 
of CFS patients about their interactions in EDs.
Subjects and methods
subjects
An email describing the project, questionnaire, and the survey 
link was sent to a Listserv of previously examined research 
participants who had physician-diagnosed CFS. The materials 
were further disseminated by the CFS patients via word of 
mouth, social media, support groups, and online forums. All 
respondents completed the questionnaire online and remained 
totally anonymous.
The study was approved by the Georgetown University 
Institutional Review Board (IRB #2015–1013).
survey items
The survey was created and disseminated using Google 
Forms.28 Items measured the severities of CFS symptoms,24 
past ED experiences, opinions regarding ED staff and atti-
tudes, and demographics. Participants had to respond to each 
item in order to progress to the next question. As a result, all 
of the submitted questionnaires were 100% complete.
CFS symptom severities were assessed using a previ-
ously validated questionnaire24 that was based on the 1994 
Fukuda criteria.12 Respondents rated the severity of fatigue 
and the eight ancillary criteria over the past 6 months using 
an anchored ordinal scale of 0 (no symptom), 1 (trivial), 2 
(mild), 3 (moderate), and 4 (severe) (Table 1).24 The sum of 
the eight ancillary criteria (Sum8) was calculated as a proxy 
for the diverse ancillary criteria. Receiver operating char-
acteristics found that a Sum8 threshold ≥14 distinguished 
CFS from sedentary control subjects. Fatigue Severity can 
be plotted against Sum8 to create a scattergram. Moderate 
and severe Fatigue and Sum8 ≥14 divided the graph into four 
quadrants that show healthy controls (Fatigue = none, trivial, 
or mild; Sum8 <14), chronic idiopathic fatigue (Fatigue = 
moderate or severe; Sum8 <14), CFS-like with insufficient 
fatigue syndrome (CFSLWIFS: Fatigue = none, trivial, or 
mild; Sum8 ≥14), and CFS (Fatigue = moderate or severe; 
Sum8 ≥14) (Table 1). In addition, fatigue and at least four 
other symptoms had to be present on at least 50% of the days 
in the past 6 months because chronicity is a key feature of the 
CFS diagnosis.12,19–21,23 An updated version of the question-
naire is shown in Table 1 and is freely available for clinical use.
CFS subject responses were compared with those of 1,495 
female and 2004 male subjects in a nationwide survey that 
was representative of the US population29 in order to show 
the influence of exclusionary conditions, and a separate group 
of 706 control and CFS subjects from previous studies in 
order to reinforce the differences between groups with no, 
trivial, and mild fatigue (healthy controls and CFSLWIFS) 
compared with moderate and severe fatigue (CFS and chronic 
idiopathic fatigue).
Additional questions have been used in clinical practice 
to help differentiate CFS from depression30 but have not been

formally investigated. “What would you do if you were better 
tomorrow?” addressed the hope, planning, and ambitions of 
CFS patients in contrast to the flat affect, anhedonia, and bleak 
view of the future that characterizes major depressive disorder. 
“What happens if you walk a long distance?” addressed PEM 
and exertional exhaustion. Exercise has a beneficial effect 
for the treatment of depression with a moderate effect size of 
0.56.31 In contrast, CFS subjects develop exertional exhaustion 
after increased physical effort. “Do you tolerate alcohol?” was 
added to address patient observations that they no longer toler-
ated alcohol compared to before the onset of the fatigue. This 
may identify subjects with acquired metabolomic dysfunction32 
who may be unable to metabolize ethanol properly, and so may 
 
generate excessive acetaldehyde as has been proposed for low-
metabolizing Asians and the so-called chlorpropamide alcohol 
flushers.33 The goal was to determine if CFS subjects had high 
scores so that these items could be prospectively tested against 
depression and other chronic illness patient populations.
ED ratings and expectations
Respondents rated the accuracy of statements related to 
their ED experiences using an ordinal 10-point Likert scale, 
anchored by 0 = “completely unsatisfied” and 10 = “completely 
satisfied”. Other statements were anchored by 0 = “completely

disagree” and 10 = “completely agree”. “Did anyone suggest 
to you ‘it was all in your head’?” addressed the attitudes of 
ED personnel toward CFS patients during their visits.
Free text comments allowed respondents to list their 
reasons for making ED visits and impressions of their ED 
interactions. Comments were reviewed, collated in an itera-
tive manner around similar messages, and finally codified 
according to common themes. Numbers of comments per 
theme were computed including the frequencies of the most 
common symptoms leading to ED visits.
Data analysis
Responses were cut and pasted into Microsoft Excel. Subjects 
were divided into those who did (Y
es_ED), or did not (No_
ED), go to an ED because of symptoms they believed were 
related to CFS. Responses by the two groups were compared 
by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests with Bonferroni cor-
rections using Excel. Data were reported as medians, mean 
± 95% CI, or number (percentage) for categorical variables.
Results
subject demographics
Responses were recorded from September 29, 2015, to 
November 29, 2015 (n=328). Data cleaning removed n=9 
respondents with fatigue scores of 2 (mild, insufficient 
fatigue), and 37 with fatigue and three or fewer symptoms 
on less than 50% of days (not sufficiently chronic). Of 
the 282 CFS respondents, 59% (167) reported going to 
an ED at some time in the past (Yes_ED) (Table 2). The 
most prevalent range for age was the decade of 40–49 
years for both Yes_ED (n=41, 25%) and No_ED (n=33, 
29%) groups. As anticipated from the demographics of 
CFS, 86.5% (n=244) of all respondents were women. 
Seventy percent (n=197) of all respondents reported hav-
ing a college degree or beyond. This may have reflected 
access to the Internet and computer fluency rather than a 
socioeconomic distinction. The majority of respondents 
(n=262, 93%) had a primary care physician. All subjects 
claimed to have physician-diagnosed CFS but this could 
not be confirmed in an anonymous fashion online. The 
groups were equivalent for all demographic measures.
survey items
CFS symptom severities were equivalent between the 
Y
es_ED 
and No_ED groups after correcting for multiple comparisons 
(Figure 1). Fatigue, exertional exhaustion, and unrefreshing 
sleep were the most severe and persistent problems in the 
previous 6 months.
The sum of the eight ancillary CFS criteria scores (Sum8) 
was related to Fatigue severity. Sum8 scores were normally 
distributed in the ED group (median =24) (Figure 2). The 
separate outpatient group with moderate and severe fatigue 
who had been screened for exclusionary conditions had Sum8 
shifted to the left due to the inclusion of chronic idiopathic 
fatigue subjects (median =20).
The distribution in 3,499 subjects representative of the 
2004 US population29 was shifted toward the left (median 
=8) and demonstrated the importance of the exclusionary 
conditions. Quadrant analysis placed 71% in the healthy 
control quadrant, 9.5% chronic idiopathic fatigue, 8.4% 
CFSLWIFS, and 11.3% in the CFS quadrant. The CFS 
quadrant included subjects with depression, arthritis, and 
regular daily exercise that would not be tolerated by CFS 
patients. These three exclusions were met by 9.3% of sub-
jects, and so reduced the net prevalence of CFS to 2.0%. This

prevalence would be reduced further by history, physical, 
and other tests for exclusionary conditions.14 For example, 
a tertiary care referral center found that at least 40% of 
putative CFS patients had a chronic medical disease (47% 
of all alternative diagnoses), primary sleep disorders (20%), 
and psychological and psychiatric illnesses (15%).34 Most of 
these would be identified by standard history and physical 
evaluations in the ED.
CFSLWIFS subjects were relevant to ED care because 
they present with a positive review of systems but mild or no 
fatigue. They represent a large group of health care seekers 
with common but medically unexplained symptoms.35
When asked, “What would you do if you were better tomor-
row?”, 91% of the 
Y
es_ED group and 83% of the No_ED group 
answered they have a list of things to do (Figure 3). Ninety-six 
percent of Y
es_ED and 93% of No_ED respondents indicated 
their symptoms were worse if they walked a long distance. 
This confirmed their exertional exhaustion. In terms of alcohol 
tolerance, 63% of Y
es_ED group and 43% of No_ED group 
noted they avoid alcohol because it makes their symptoms

worse. There were no correlations between CFS severity 
scores and responses to these questions. Given the highly 
skewed responses, these questions will now be assessed for 
sensitivity and specificity against other populations in future 
questionnaires.
ED ratings and expectations
Symptoms at presentation to the ED were evaluated from 
the free text comments of 167 respondents in the Y
es_ED 
group (Figure 4). They made 676 complaints (3.9±3.1 per 
respondent, mean ±95% CI). Orthostatic intolerance was 
suggested as the leading reason for ED visits because the 
most prevalent complaints were “dizzy/lightheaded” (n=88, 
14%), “general weakness” (n=72, 12%), and “fainting” (n=33, 
5%) (Figure 5). Fatigue and PEM occurred in about 8% each. 
Muscle pain (8%), headache (7%), and joint pain (5%) were 
relatively infrequent and suggested that drug seeking (ie, 
narcotics) was not a motivation for CFS patients. Headaches 
were not associated with nausea, vomiting, or visual changes 
(eg, photophobia). Gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea or 
constipation (n=52, 8%) were common, but these occurred 
without abdominal pain (0.2%), nausea, or vomiting (0.7%). 
“Other” complaints (n=58, 9%) included “heart problems” and 
“heart attack”. Cardiovascular disease should be considered 
in the differential diagnosis.34 There were no correlations 
between CFS severity scores and the number of complaints.
CFS respondents reported the ED staff were not knowl-
edgeable about CFS (mean rating 1.9/10) and were not truly 
listening to their concerns (3.7/10) (Figure 5). Attribution to 
stress, anxiety, or other psychological issues had a bimodal 
distribution, suggesting that half of the personnel had a bias 
toward a psychosomatic etiology of the complaints (5.7/10). 
This is consistent with the 41.9% of CFS patients who were 
told by ED staff that “it was all in your head”. In contrast, CFS 
patients expected ED staff to know what CFS was (6.9/10) 
and had the expectation that the ED should be able to treat 
their presenting symptoms (7.2/10). It was not surprising that 
the overall ED experience scored 3.6 demonstrating general 
dissatisfaction by CFS patients.
“Did you share the diagnosis of CFS to the ED? If not, 
“why?” Only 72% (n=121) of the Y
es_ED patients told the 
ED staff they had CFS. The three most common themes 
were lack of knowledge or education about CFS by the ED 
staff (n=28, 25%), feelings of being dismissed or not taken 
seriously (n=26, 23%), and being told explicitly or inferred 
that their symptoms were psychological (n=20, 18%). There 
was a lack of respect or compassion (16%), and patients 
worried they would receive a lower quality of care (13%). 
The other 46 (28%) in the Y
es_ED group did not reveal their 
CFS diagnosis.
An open comment field allowed respondents to explain a 
“no” response (Figure 6). One patient statement was,
I did not share I had ME/CFS because if I do my symp-
toms are dismissed. I’m thought of as a drug seeker, or a 
hypochondriac. I’m belittled and sent home without treatment.
This statement was codified with feelings of “judgment” 
(n=17, 37%), “care would be affected” (n=15, 33%), and 
being dismissed (n=10, 22%). The ED physician did not make 
a diagnosis of CFS in 18/46 (39%) of the Y
es_ED cases who 
did not reveal their diagnosis.
The most common theme in the No_ED patients (n=93) 
was, “I knew there was nothing they could do for me” (n=16,

(n=13, 14%).
Discussion
The most common symptoms leading to an ED visit were 
dizziness and lightheadedness. This is consistent with the 
Canadian19,20 and Institute of Medicine21 criteria that include 
orthostatic intolerance (Table 3). Postural orthostatic tachy-
cardia syndrome (11%–13% of CFS)18,36,37 and idiopathic 
tachycardia are common in CFS.38 When combined with 
symptoms of general weakness, faintness, and palpitations, 
orthostatic intolerance accounted for roughly one-third of the 
complaints leading to ED visits. Acute cardiac, neurological, 
and other life-threatening causes must be excluded by appro-
priate examinations before attributing the symptoms to CFS.
Ten respondents reported “feeling better with intravenous 
fluids” (Figure 6). This is consistent with findings of depleted 
circulating fluid volume, reduced cardiac end-diastolic 
volume, stroke volume and cardiac output,39 “small heart 
syndrome”,40 dysregulated sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone

cholinergic vasodilator effects.42 Intravenous fluids are a 
common recommendation from CFS specialists to ED staff 
in clinical practice, but their use has not been systematically 
studied. Given that there are no Food and Drug Association-
approved, CFS-specific treatments,43 it is reasonable to 
consider administering oral or intravenous fluids to acutely 
alleviate orthostatic intolerance, cognitive impairment, PEM, 
and fatigue complaints in CFS patients after life-threatening 
disorders have been ruled out.
Diarrhea and constipation were common presentations, 
but their etiology in CFS has not been extensively explored. 
The low prevalence of abdominal pain was surprising. Treat-
ment is directed at symptom control.
Migraine with headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual 
changes (ie, photophobia) was not a common presentation 
in our study even though we have estimated that up to 80% 
of CFS had migraine (n=67).44,45 Migraine in CFS was asso-
ciated with poor memory, dizziness, imbalance, numbness, 
perceived heart rhythm disturbances, palpitations, noncar-
diac chest pain, and a high rate of response to sumitriptan.44 
Migraine and tension headaches were comorbid conditions 
in 60%. Headaches were often daily or unremitting. Migraine 
without aura should be considered in the ED and treated 
appropriately.
Noncardiac chest pain may be due to gastroesophageal 
reflux or costochondritis, but cardiac causes should be con-
sidered if the pulse, blood pressure, or EKG is abnormal. 
This is particularly important because of the predominance 
of women and their atypical presentations of angina (eg, 
nausea).46 Diaphoresis is a common component of autonomic 
dysfunction in CFS.19,20 Mortality from cardiovascular and all 
causes may be significantly higher in CFS than in the overall 
US population.47
Chronic total body pain and fibromyalgia are problematic 
because the 2011 fibromyalgia criteria assess widespread 
pain, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, unrefreshing sleep, and 
somatic complaints (Table 3).48,49 The sign of systemic hyper-
algesia (tenderness) that was central to the 1990 criteria50 was 
deleted in 2010.51 As a result, the symptom profile is nearly 
indistinguishable from CFS, leading some to wonder “What 
is fibromyalgia?”.52 However, PEM is a defining element of 
CFS that is not required by fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria.
The criteria for CFS have similarities with the ancillary 
criteria of depression and somatoform disorders including 
fatigue, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and 
reduced activity (Table 3).53,54 This may be a superficial 
subjective oversimplification because major depressive 
disorder and CFS are distinct entities when their objective 
findings such as leukocyte mRNA expression patterns are 
contrasted.55,56 CFS is associated with plasma metabolo-
mics changes indicating mitochondrial dysfunction and 
reduced utilization of amino acids for ATP production.32,57 
Similar findings are not reported in depression. Screening 
for depression often uses short questionnaires that emphasize 
somatic complaints to distinguish depression from healthy 
subjects.58,59 However, questionnaires have high false-positive

rates in conditions that are diagnosed based on unexplained 
somatic complaints. Questionnaires do not follow the psy-
chiatric practice of first diagnosing depressed affect and 
anhedonia, with secondary confirmation by somatic com-
plaints. Hoyer and David propose a better approach to assess 
depression in the ED60 including the mnemonic “In SAD 
CAGES” (loss of Interest in activities/Sleep disturbance/
Appetite change/Depressed mood/difficulty Concentrat-
ing/Activity level change/excessive Guilt/loss of Energy/
Suicidal thoughts, plan, or attempt).61 If the patient answers 
affirmatively to five or more of the nine symptoms having 
been present on a daily basis for 2 weeks, depression should 
remain in the patient’s differential diagnosis. The possibility 
of depression should be discussed with the patient and an 
appropriate referral made. Of course, if a patient might be 
suicidal, emergent psychiatric consultation is indicated.”59–61 
Inappropriate use of antidepressant medications in CFS62 may 
lead to adverse effects such as increased appetite, weight 
gain, and iatrogenic type II diabetes in subjects who cannot 
tolerate exercise to reverse the obesity.
CFS respondents were dissatisfied with their ED visits. 
Their open text themes showed that they expected that ED 
health care providers would have some knowledge about CFS 
and be able to treat their symptoms. These expectations were 
not met as judged by the lack of knowledge and treatment 
strategies by ED staff, and the comments from the No_ED

Notes: Fatigue, sleep, and cognitive difficulties are shared by all of the conditions. Exertional exhaustion/postexertional malaise was shared by CFS, myalgic encephalomyelitis

the durations of symptoms; visceral complaints and 1991 Persian Gulf War exposures in GWI; systemic hyperalgesia measured by thumb pressure and tender points in the 
1990 fibromyalgia criteria but removal of this sign in the 2010 fibromyalgia criteria; and depressed affect, anhedonia, guilt/worthlessness, and suicidal ideation in depression.

respondents that they did not go to the ED for their CFS 
symptoms because “they knew nothing could or would be 
done for them”. CFS patients felt they were being treated 
with a dismissive lack of respect that could sink to accusa-
tions of drug-seeking behavior and Munchausen syndrome. 
The themes in our study are consistent with those voiced by 
CFS patients in other settings.10,11
The CFS Severity Score Questionnaire (Table 1) serves 
as a quick self-report instrument to help narrow the differ-
ential diagnosis of nociceptive, interoceptive, and fatiguing 
illnesses to CFS (Table 4). Follow-up questioning should 
focus on exclusionary conditions and the positive features 
of chronic fatigue, PEM, and unrefreshing sleep that spe-
cifically identify CFS. The fatigue must have been present 
for more than 6 months, and medical or psychiatric causes 
have been evaluated and ruled out. Many CFS patients 
carry reams of medical records with them to doctor and ED 
visits. Instead, they can be encouraged to write a one-page 
summary that encapsulates their history, medications, and 
drug adverse events, and clearly states the specific reason 
for this particular visit. PEM/exertional exhaustion is almost 
the sine qua non of CFS. In normal subjects, excessive 
exertion is fatiguing and leads to sensations of pain and 
bodily heaviness. Cognitive processes inhibit expenditure 
of further effort in order to conserve physical and cogni-
tive reserves and prevent total exhaustion.63 The distressing 
physical and cognitive perceptions improve or disappear 
completely after a refreshing night of sleep. In contrast to 
CFS, cognitive, emotional, or physical effort that is more 
than the patient’s usual level can cause a relapse of that 
patient’s typical spectrum of fatigue, cognitive compromise 
(“brain fog”), pain, and orthostatic intolerance. The onset

cFs in ED
may be immediate or may be delayed up to 24 hours, which 
is highly unusual in healthy subjects. CFS patients may 
have to rest for several days before they can resume usual 
daily activities. Sleep is not refreshing or restorative at the 
best of times for CFS patients and is not refreshing after 
exertion. In contrast to healthy subjects who are refreshed 
after sleeping, CFS PEM symptoms may be delayed until 
after a night’s sleep.
Our study design has inherent limitations. Self-reporting 
of past experiences are subject to recall bias. However, given 
the paucity of information regarding the presentations of CFS 
patients to the ED, this pilot study serves as a starting point for 
future investigations into this topic. The gender distribution 
and peak age range were representative of the general CFS 
population, but our subjects had higher education levels than 
other reports.64 This may indicate a selection bias due to the 
online format, Internet survey dissemination, and access to, 
and skill working with, computers. While the CFS question-
naire has been used extensively online, the other inquiries 
were unique to this study and will need future validation. It 
is possible that some respondents had other conditions that 
would exclude CFS. However, the high severity of chronic 
fatigue, previous diagnosis by a physician, and contact 
through the Listserve makes CFS the more likely diagnosis. 
The number of negative comments about ED attitudes and 
experiences from 
Y
es_ED patients would be biased if the only 
respondents to fill out the surveys were those who wanted to 
report negative encounters. However, the comments by the 
No_ED and Y
es_ED subjects who did not reveal their CFS 
diagnosis were also similar and consistent. CFS patients 
had bad perceptions of the dismissive attitudes of ED staff, 
their psychosomatic bias, and deficient knowledge about 
CFS. These messages are clear despite the limitations of 
this pilot study.
clinical evaluation
The diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome can be scruti-
nized using the scoring sheet in Table 1 that is based on the 
1994 Centers for Disease Control criteria.24,29 The fatigue 
must have been moderate or severe for at least 6 months, 
with other symptoms starting after the fatigue. PEM is a key 
indicator of CFS (Figures 1 and 4). Cognitive, emotional, 
or physical exertion is likely to cause a relapse of cognitive, 
pain, interoceptive, sleep, and fatigue dysfunction in CFS. 
The onset may be delayed hours or until the day after the 
exertion. This is very different from the pattern of recovery in 
virtually all other diseases and in healthy subjects. The CFS 
patient has likely had extensive blood work and other studies, 
and has seen many specialists. They may turn to the ED as 
a last resort hoping for some novel therapy. Unfortunately, 
their expectations are generally not met by knowledge or 
compassion, and lead to poor patient satisfaction. ED staff 
are not knowledgeable about CFS and were deemed to be 
disdainful of CFS patients. Forty-two percent of patients 
were told, “It is all in your head”, which is not a constructive 
approach to enhance medical care. If CFS is suspected, then 
targeted questions about the chronic nature of the fatigue, 
past experiences with PEM, and previous medical evalua-
tions coupled with focused review of the patient’s pertinent 
medical reports and records, followed by selected blood tests 
and EKG, as appropriate, are likely to determine whether 
exclusionary conditions of relevance to the visit have been 
ruled out. These include hypothyroidism, cardiac disease, 
anemia, depression, effects of psychoactive and other drugs, 
and other chronic medical diseases (Table 4).13,14,34 Ortho-
static intolerance was the leading cause for ED visits in this 
study; intravenous or oral fluids in a supportive, noncon-
frontational setting may be beneficial after life-threatening 
conditions have been ruled out. New findings of cardiac, 
brain stem, autonomic, immune cell, and metabolomics 
alterations are beginning to delineate the pathophysiology 
of this condition31,38–41,51 and will lead to future phenotyping 
of CFS subtypes and, hopefully, to biomarkers for diagnosis 
and targeted drug therapies.
Conclusion
CFS patients present to the ED with a complex list of chronic 
symptoms, but the acute reasons for presentation are related 
to orthostatic intolerance, fatigue, PEM, and diarrhea (Figure 
4). Standard history and physical examination should iden-
tify serious cardiovascular and other events, and allow the 
exclusion of cases with other chronic medical and psychiatric 
diseases from the differential diagnosis (Tables 3 and 4). 
The CFS Symptom Severity Questionnaire and supporting 
questions (Table 1) provide a clinical guide and self-report 
instrument for inferring CFS in the busy ED setting. A barrier 
to care was the lack of knowledge of ED staff about CFS, 
and focus on psychosomatic etiology so that 43% of patients 
were told, “It is all in your head”. A successful and efficient 
ED encounter is more likely if 1) ED staff are cognizant of 
CFS, 2) acute life-threatening conditions are identified and 
treated, 3) chronic medical and psychiatric conditions are 
addressed by standard history and physical examination, 
4) CFS is diagnosed by its characteristic features, and 5) 
orthostasis, diarrhea, and other acute symptoms are treated 
in standard fashion.
