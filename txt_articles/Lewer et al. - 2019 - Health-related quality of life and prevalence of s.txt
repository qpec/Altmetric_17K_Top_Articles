AbstrACt 
Objectives To compare health-related quality of life and 
prevalence of chronic diseases in housed and homeless 
populations.
Design Cross-sectional survey with an age-matched and 
sex-matched housed comparison group.
setting Hostels, day centres and soup runs in London and 
Birmingham, England.
Participants Homeless participants were either sleeping 
rough or living in hostels and had a history of sleeping 
rough. The comparison group was drawn from the Health 
Survey for England. The study included 1336 homeless 
and 13 360 housed participants.
Outcome measures Chronic diseases were self-
reported asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), epilepsy, heart problems, stroke and diabetes. 
Health-related quality of life was measured using EQ-
5D-3L.
results Housed participants in more deprived 
neighbourhoods were more likely to report disease. 
Homeless participants were substantially more likely 
than housed participants in the most deprived quintile 
to report all diseases except diabetes (which had similar 
prevalence in homeless participants and the most deprived 
housed group). For example, the prevalence of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease was 1.1% (95% CI 0.7% to 
1.6%) in the least deprived housed quintile; 2.0% (95% CI 
1.5% to 2.6%) in the most deprived housed quintile; and 
14.0% (95% CI 12.2% to 16.0%) in the homeless group. 
Social gradients were also seen for problems in each EQ-
5D-3L domain in the housed population, but homeless 
participants had similar likelihood of reporting problems 
as the most deprived housed group. The exception was 
problems related to anxiety, which were substantially 
more common in homeless people than any of the housed 
groups.
Conclusions While differences in health between housed 
socioeconomic groups can be described as a ‘slope’, 
differences in health between housed and homeless 
people are better understood as a ‘cliff’.
IntrODuCtIOn 
Homelessness is an enduring social problem 
in high income countries.1 2 It is associated 
with poor health outcomes, with cohort 
studies showing mortality risks of three to six 
times the general population.3–7 The most 
common causes of death are usually (but not 
always7) accidents, drug overdoses, suicides 
and liver diseases. Homeless people also have 
substantially increased risk of death due to 
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.3 5 7 8 
There are few studies of morbidity among 
homeless people. Most have examined infec-
tions and mental health problems9 10; finding 
high relative and absolute frequencies. The 
few studies looking at broader outcomes have 
found that respiratory diseases, dental prob-
lems, headaches and skin diseases are also 
more common among homeless people than 
the general population.11–15
Inequalities in health in the general popu-
lation have been widely observed. People in 
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► The study is based on a large survey of 1336 home-
less people.
 
► The survey includes data on outcomes that are rarely 
measured in homeless people, including long-term 
health conditions and health-related quality of life.
 
► An age-matched and sex-matched comparison 
group is used to compare the results with the gen-
eral population.
 
► The cross sectional design means that causal path-
ways between homelessness and health are not 
investigated.
 
► The data were collected as part of a service evalu-
ation and focus on a subset of diseases that cause 
substantial morbidity among homeless people.

lower socioeconomic groups have more risk factors and 
worse health outcomes.16 17 Although poor health has 
been observed in homeless people, it is unclear whether 
homeless people have substantially worse health than 
the most deprived groups in the general population. We 
analysed data from a large survey of homeless people to 
understand how health-related quality of life and preva-
lence of chronic diseases in homeless people compares 
to different socioeconomic groups in the general 
population.
MethODs
Data sources
We used anonymised data from an evaluation of a mobile 
tuberculosis screening unit (‘Find and Treat’) that works 
alongside services for homeless people. Participants were 
people sleeping rough and accessing day centres and 
soup kitchens, or people with a history of rough sleeping 
who are living in temporary hostel accommodations. Staff 
at the screening unit worked with homeless people to 
develop a health survey including questions on chronic 
diseases and health-related quality of life. Interviewer-led 
questionnaires were conducted in London from 1 July 
2012 to 31 August 2012 and in Birmingham from 13 July 
2014 to 18 July 2014 and from 16 March 2015 to 24 July 
2015. We excluded 21 participants aged under 16 or over 
64.
We selected a housed comparison group from the 
Health Survey for England. This is an annual series of 
cross-sectional surveys designed to be representative 
of adults living in private households. Participants are 
selected based on stratified random sampling of house-
holds across England. The full method is described else-
where.18 We used data from the 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011,

2012 and 2014 surveys, limiting to participants from 
urban areas. Within each deprivation quintile, we strati-
fied participants by age group and sex, and within each 
stratum selected a random sample of size double the 
number of homeless participants in the corresponding 
age and sex group. This produced an age-matched and 
sex-matched comparison group with ten housed partici-
pants for each homeless participant.
Variables
The main outcomes are self-reported long-term condi-
tions and health-related quality of life.
To establish prevalence of long-term conditions, home-
less participants were asked whether a doctor or nurse 
had ever given a diagnosis of (1) asthma, (2) bronchitis, 
emphysema or obstructive airways disease (chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), (3) epilepsy, (4) 
heart problems, including heart attack, angina, murmur 
or abnormal heart rhythms, (5) stroke and (6) diabetes. 
Housed participants were asked whether they had a health 
condition lasting or expected to last 12 months or more, 
with corresponding options of (1) asthma, (2) bronchitis, 
emphysema or other respiratory problems, (3) epilepsy, 
fits or convulsions, (4) heart attack, angina or other heart 
problems, (5) stroke, cerebral haemorrhage or cerebral 
thrombosis and (6) diabetes including hyperglycaemia.
EQ-5D-3L19 was used to measure health-related quality 
of life. Participants report no problems, some problems 
or extreme problems in five domains: mobility, pain, 
self-care, usual activities and anxiety. We created a binary 
variable showing whether participants reported ‘none’ 
versus ‘some’ or ‘extreme’ problems’. Participants also 
completed a visual-analogue scale (VAS) of overall health 
on the day of interview, where 0 is the worst imaginable 
state and 100 the best.
The main exposure was deprivation. The homeless 
group were classified as the most deprived, while the 
housed comparison group were classified using quintiles 
of the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2007.20 This is an 
area-based index derived from levels of income, employ-
ment, health, disability, education, skills and training in 
small local areas of roughly 1500 residents.
Age was grouped into 16–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54 and 
55–64, which was consistently available across datasets.
We also reported health behaviours: current smoking, 
drinking every day in the past week and currently injecting 
drugs.

statistical methods
We described homeless and housed participants by age 
group, sex, health behaviours, prevalence of long-term 
conditions and EQ-5D-3L characteristics. χ2tests were 
used to test the difference between categorical variables 
and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test the differ-
ence between the EQ-5D-3L VAS score. We additionally 
calculated the prevalence of long-term conditions and 
EQ-5D-3L problems by deprivation group and calculated 
prevalence ratios with the least deprived housed group 
as the reference population, with Wald CIs. To test for 
social gradients in the housed population, we used χ2test 
for trends with deprivation quintiles scored 1–5. We strati-
fied prevalence of long-term conditions by age group and 
tested the association between age and long-term condi-
tions using χ2 tests.
As a subanalysis of the effect of morbidity on inequal-
ities in health-related quality of life, we used logistic 
regression to estimate the joint effect of deprivation 
and any morbidity (with the least deprived group with 
no long-term conditions as the reference group) on 
each EQ-5D-3L domain, adjusting for age group and 
sex. The results are shown in the online supplementary 
information.

Some of the Health Survey for England data were 
collected several years before the surveys of homeless 
people, so we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which the 
procedures described above were repeated without the 
Health Survey for England years 2006 and 2008. These 
results are shown in online supplementary information.
Six participants in the homeless group did not provide 
their sex and were excluded. Age and long-term condition 
data were complete. 142/1336 (10.6%) homeless partic-
ipants and 1353/13360 (10.1%) housed participants did 
not complete all EQ-5D-3L questions, with similar age (χ2 
p=0.40) and sex (χ2 p=0.61) characteristics to those with 
complete data. These participants were excluded from 
analysis of EQ-5D-3L but retained for other analyses. Data 
on current smoking and everyday drinking were missing 
for 904/1336 (68%) homeless participants because these 
questions were only asked to participants in London. 
These data were missing for less than 1% of the housed 
group (table 1). Drug injection data were missing for 
29/1336 (2.2%) homeless participants and all housed 
participants (as questions about drug injection are not 
included in the Health Survey for England). Data on 
health behaviours are shown in table 1 but associations 
with outcomes were not analysed.
All analyses were carried out using R V.3.4.2.
Patient involvement
Clients of the Find and Treat service were involved in 
selecting the diseases included in this study, and in testing 
and refining the questionnaire.
ethics
This was an analysis of anonymised secondary data. 
We checked the requirement for ethical approval for 
this analysis using the National Health Service Health 
Research Authority/Medical Research Counsil approval 
checklist21 and determined that ethical approval or addi-
tional informed consent was not required.
results
Participants
The homeless sample consisted of 904 participants 
recruited from Birmingham and 432 from London 
(total=1336). The response rate was 77% in London 
and 71% in Birmingham. In the London sample, 73% 
reported current smoking and 23% reported drinking 
alcohol every day in the past week. The corresponding 
values in the housed group were 27% and 9%. Table 1 
summarises the characteristics of the study population.
long-term conditions
The prevalence of any long-term condition was 34.2% 
(95% CI 31.6% to 36.8%) in the homeless group and 
12.1% (95% CI 11.5% to 12.6%) in the housed group. 
Asthma was the most commonly reported condition in 
both groups. All conditions except for diabetes were 
more common in the homeless group than in the housed 
group. COPD, heart problems, stroke and diabetes were 
strongly associated with older age for both homeless 
and housed groups, while epilepsy and asthma were not 
(figure 1 and online supplementary information). 
When we compared long-term conditions across depri-
vation quintiles in the housed population, we observed 
social gradients for all diseases except asthma (p<0.05), 
with participants living in deprived areas having higher 
risk (figure 2). For all conditions except diabetes, there 
were larger relative and absolute differences between 
the homeless group and all housed deprivation groups 
than there were between the housed deprivation groups. 
For example, the prevalence ratio comparing the risk of 
COPD in the most deprived quintile of housed partic-
ipants versus the least deprived was 1.8 (95% CI 1.2 to 
2.9), compared with 12.9 (95% CI 8.8 to 19.0) comparing 
the homeless group to the least deprived quintile.
health-related quality of life (eQ-5D-3l)
The homeless group reported worse overall health, 
with a median of 65 (IQR 50–80) on the EQ-5D-3L VAS, 
compared with median of 80 (IQR 70–90) for the housed 
group (figure 3).
802/1194 (67%) of the homeless group reported prob-
lems in at least one of the EQ-5D-3L domains (mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain and anxiety), compared with 
4292/13360 (35.7%) of the housed group. The homeless 
group reported more problems than the housed group in 
all five domains.
When we compared EQ-5D-3L problems across depri-
vation quintiles in the housed population, we observed 
social gradients for all domains (p<0.0001), with partic-
ipants living in deprived areas more likely to report 
problems (figure 4). In contrast to the results for disease 
prevalence, the homeless group and the most deprived 
housed quintile had similar likelihood of reporting prob-
lems related to mobility, self-care, usual activities and 
pain. For example, the prevalence of problems with usual 
activities in the most deprived quintile of housed partic-
ipants was 2.5 times the least deprived group (95% CI 
2.1 to 2.9), compared with 2.2 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.7) for 
the homeless group. However, the homeless group had 
substantially greater likelihood of reporting problems 
with anxiety than all housed groups. The most deprived 
quintile of housed participants was 1.8 times more likely 
to report problems with anxiety than the least deprived 
group (95% CI 1.6 to 2.0), compared with 3.8 (95% CI 
3.4 to 4.2) for the homeless group.
The joint effects analysis (online supplementary 
information) of morbidity and deprivation showed that 
greater deprivation was associated with higher likelihood 
of reporting problems in all EQ-5D-3L domains, for 
participants both with and without long-term conditions. 
After accounting for morbidity, homeless participants 
had similar or lower likelihood of reporting problems in 
all domains except anxiety, when compared with than the 
most deprived housed participants.

DIsCussIOn
Principle findings
Homeless people report substantially worse health than 
those in stable housing and are three times more likely to 
report a chronic disease. In particular, homeless people 
report higher prevalence of asthma, COPD, epilepsy 
and heart problems. Homeless people also report worse 
quality of life, and are more than twice as likely to report 
problems with anxiety. There are large differences 
between the homeless group and the most deprived 
housed group. When compared with the ‘slopes’ in health 
outcomes across deprivation quintiles, the inequalities in 
outcomes for homeless people appear more like a ‘cliff’.
limitations
This is a cross-sectional study and does not provide insight 
into why homeless people have worse health than housed 
people. We aimed to describe the prevalence of health 
problems rather than understand these causal pathways, 
and therefore did not attempt to control for factors such 
as health behaviours.
EQ-5D-3L has not been validated in homeless people. 
However, it has been used in previous studies of the 
health of homeless people22 and validity has been demon-
strated in overlapping groups such as people who use 
illicit drugs.23 There may be value in future research into 
the interpretation of quality of life instruments by home-
less people.
Comparisons with existing studies
The health of homeless people differs between countries 
and regions. However, the large inequalities between 
homeless and housed people are likely to persist. Studies 
that applied EQ-5D-3L to 73 homeless people in Italy24 
and 155 in Sweden22 both found substantially more prob-
lems related to anxiety than other domains, reflecting our 
results. While there are few studies of long-term condi-
tions in homeless people, existing studies have also found 
high frequency of non-communicable diseases.11–15
Implications
There are many possible causes of the ‘cliff’ in long-term 
conditions and anxiety observed for homeless people, and 
the association between homelessness and poor health 
is most likely bidirectional. Poor health may precipitate 
homelessness if it leads to loss of income or breakdown 
of relationships. This is supported by data from Scot-
land showing high rates of health service use before first 
episodes of homelessness.25 Homelessness is also likely 
to worsen physical health due to poor living conditions; 
use of tobacco, alcohol and drugs11 ; and poor access to 
health services.26
Despite the higher prevalence of long-term condi-
tions, homeless people did not report substantially more 
quality-of-life problems (apart from problems related to 
anxiety). This may reflect a higher threshold for reporting 
problems, due to a low expectations of health or normal-
isation of pain and illness.
The age of onset of long-term conditions is related to 
the patterns observed across age groups (figure 1). The 
prevalence of asthma and epilepsy is flat across age groups 
in both the housed and homeless populations. These 
diseases typically onset in childhood and the higher prev-
alence in the homeless group may relate to circumstances 
in childhood or before homelessness. For example, heavy 
alcohol use and brain injury27 are common precursors of 
homelessness and may contribute to higher prevalence 
of epilepsy. COPD and heart problems are strongly asso-
ciated with adult risk factors, particularly smoking, which 
reflects the higher prevalence observed in older age 
groups, and the higher prevalence in the homeless group. 
The average age of first stroke is 71 (SD 13) in men in the 
UK,28 which is older than the study population, reflecting 
the small number of cases and limited power to observe 
inequalities, though higher prevalence was still observed 
in the homeless group (table 1).
Research into the health of homeless people has 
focused on infections, mental health and ‘external’ 
causes such as drug overdose. Evaluations of interven-
tions have also focused on these areas. For example, 
there is evidence that case management can improve the 
effectiveness of treatments for mental health problems, 
drug dependence and tuberculosis in homeless people.29 
Research into ‘housing first’, an approach that provides 
housing before engaging individuals in treatment for 
substance use or mental health problems, also looks at 
how it can improve outcomes in these areas.30 The focus 
on these areas may have resulted from the high relative 
risks of disease,7 in part due to their rarity in the general 
population, and because in most studies of mortality they 
account for the majority of deaths.
Our results show that respiratory diseases, epilepsy 
and heart problems are also common among homeless 
people in England. Homeless people encounter barriers 
to management of chronic diseases31 and there is a need 
for research into effective healthcare. Case management 
should be further explored for management of chronic 
diseases. Existing evidence-based preventative interven-
tions should also be adapted and evaluated for excluded 
groups. For example, smoking cessation interventions can 
reduce the risk of COPD and improve asthma symptoms, 
and should be tailored to homeless people and evaluated. 
There is also a need for routine surveillance data on the 
health of homeless people, to improve transparency and 
accountability for poor health in this population.
COnClusIOn
There is a ‘slope’ in health outcomes across socioeco-
nomic groups in the general population and a ‘cliff’ when 
we consider homeless people. These extreme differences 
extend to long-term physical health conditions as well as 
infections and mental health.
