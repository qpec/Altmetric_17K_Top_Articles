Objective To determine differences in antibiotic 
prescription rates between conventional General Practice 
(GP) surgeries and GP surgeries employing general 
practitioners (GPs) additionally trained in integrative 
medicine (IM) or complementary and alternative medicine 
(CAM) (referred to as IM GPs) working within National 
Health Service (NHS) England.
Design Retrospective study on antibiotic prescription 
rates per STAR-PU (Specific Therapeutic group Age–sex 
weighting Related Prescribing Unit) using NHS Digital 
data over 2016. Publicly available data were used on 
prevalence of relevant comorbidities, demographics of 
patient populations and deprivation scores.
setting Primary Care.
Participants 7283 NHS GP surgeries in England.
Primary outcome measure The association between IM 
GPs and antibiotic prescribing rates per STAR-PU with the 
number of antibiotic prescriptions (total, and for respiratory 
tract infection (RTI) and urinary tract infection (UTI) 
separately) as outcome.
results IM GP surgeries (n=9) were comparable 
to conventional GP surgeries in terms of list sizes, 
demographics, deprivation scores and comorbidity 
prevalence. Negative binomial regression models showed 
that statistically significant fewer total antibiotics (relative 
risk (RR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.97) and RTI antibiotics (RR 
0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.94) were prescribed at NHS IM GP 
surgeries compared with conventional NHS GP surgeries. 
In contrast, the number of antibiotics prescribed for UTI 
were similar between both practices.
Conclusion NHS England GP surgeries employing GPs 
additionally trained in IM/CAM have lower antibiotic 
prescribing rates. Accessibility of IM/CAM within NHS 
England primary care is limited. Main study limitation 
is the lack of consultation data. Future research should 
include the differences in consultation behaviour of 
patients self-selecting to consult an IM GP or conventional 
surgery, and its effect on antibiotic prescription. Additional 
treatment strategies for common primary care infections 
used by IM GPs should be explored to see if they could be 
used to assist in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.
IntrODuCtIOn   
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the 
inappropriate use of antibiotics represent a 
serious threat to public health internation-
ally.1 Antibiotics are currently indispensable 
throughout the healthcare system, and the 
consequences of AMR, not only in primary 
care, but also in major surgery and cancer 
treatment for example, are dire. Fortunately, 
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► Use of National Health Service (NHS) Digital data 
on antibiotic prescription per Specific Therapeutic 
group Age–sex weighting Related Prescribing 
Unit (STAR-PU) provided a comprehensive insight 
into the prescribing practices of total antibiotics, 
and for respiratory tract infection and urinary tract 
infection separately in conventional General Practice 
(GP) surgeries and GP surgeries employing general 
practitioners (GPs) additionally trained in integrative 
medicine (IM GPs).
 
► NHS England IM GP surgeries were comparable 
to conventional GP surgeries in terms of list sizes, 
demographics, deprivation scores and comorbidity 
prevalence.
 
► Accessibility of IM/complementary and alternative 
medicine (CAM) within the NHS in General Practice 
in England is very limited. IM/CAM provision is 
currently almost exclusively private in the UK.
 
► Results are limited by the lack of data on (1) number 
of consultations, (2) individual GP characteristics, (3) 
individual deprivation scores and (4) continuum of 
care.

reductions in antibiotic use have been shown to be associ-
ated with a reduction in some resistance,2 and the reduc-
tion in the use of antibiotics, especially in primary care, to 
control the development of AMR is therefore a pressing 
national and international priority.1 3 
In the UK, 74% of antibiotics are prescribed in primary 
care making this one of the most important contribu-
tors to the development of AMR.4 National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on respi-
ratory tract infection5 (RTI) management advise that a 
non-antibiotic prescribing strategy or a delayed antibiotic 
prescribing strategy should be considered for patients 
with the following conditions: acute otitis media, acute 
sore throat/acute pharyngitis/acute tonsillitis, common 
cold, acute rhinosinusitis and acute cough/acute bron-
chitis. Nevertheless, antibiotics are commonly prescribed 
for RTIs in adults and children in primary care, and are 
the reason for 60% of all antibiotic prescribing in general 
practice in the UK.6 Several studies have shown that there 
is substantial overprescribing of antibiotics for, often 
viral and self-limiting, RTIs in primary care.7–9 Conse-
quently, there is a large potential to reduce antibiotic 
prescribing for RTIs, potentially by using other treatment 
strategies that do not increase the development or spread 
of AMR. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most 
common confirmed bacterial infection, with about half 
of all women experiencing one of more UTIs in their life-
time.10 Most women with UTIs are currently treated with 
antibiotics, with longer duration and multiple courses 
associated with higher AMR rates.11 12 For example, 
NICE guideline on uncomplicated UTIs in women 
advise offering symptom relief and an antibiotic to all 
women with a suspected UTI. It states that for a woman 
with mild symptoms who has normal immunity, normal 
renal function and a normal renal tract, treatment can 
be delayed if the patient wishes to see if symptoms will 
resolve without treatment. For all other women treatment 
needs to start without delay.13 Therefore, overprescribing 
seems to be much less common for UTIs than for RTIs.14 
Consequently, it may be easier to safely reduce antibiotic 
prescribing for RTIs than for UTIs in primary care.
There is great variability in the use of antimicrobial 
medications between countries, with the lowest prescrip-
tion rates reported in northern European nations, and 
higher rates in southern Europe and the USA.15–17 Vari-
ations in the prescription of antibiotics both within and 
between countries may indicate poor practice18 with 
inappropriate use of antibiotics which increases the 
risk of adverse events for the patient,12 wastes health-
care resources19 and contributes to the rise in antibiotic 
resistance.16 Previous studies have shown that a complex 
array of factors influence antibiotic prescribing, which 
may explain the wide variety of antibiotic usage both at 
the clinician level and worldwide. The attitudes of both 
doctor20–22 and patient23–25 are shown to be of major 
significance in prescribing decisions.
General practitioners (GPs) as a professional group 
are expected, following the principles of evidence-based 
medicine, to apply best available evidence to patient’s 
individual situation, within the framework of national and 
local funding and administrative guidance. Prescription 
style (measured as the prevalence of prescriptions per 
GP) is found to be an important factor in the variation in 
antibiotic prescribing behaviour.18 Underlying factors for 
this finding might be differing views on medicalisation, 
differences in guidelines between countries and between 
specialists and knowledge and use of complementary 
and alternative medicine (CAM)/integrative medicine 
(IM).26–28 The association between the knowledge/use of 
IM/CAM by GPs and antibiotic prescribing has so far not 
been widely scrutinised.
The aim of this study is to determine the differences 
in antibiotic prescription rates between ‘conventional 
General Practice (GP) surgeries and GP surgeries 
employing GPs additionally trained in IM/CAM (here-
after referred to as integrative medicine (IM) GPs), 
and the association between having staff with an addi-
tional training in IM/CAM and antibiotic prescription 
(measured as total antibiotics, RTI-specific antibiotics 
and UTI-specific antibiotics) within the National Health 
Service (NHS) in England.
MethODs
IM GP surgeries
To identify NHS General Practices employing an IM GP 
in 2016, two sequential tasks were required. First, IM GPs 
were identified and then a current working link was made 
to an NHS General Practice.
Identification of NHS GPs registered with an additional CAM 
qualification
We included the ‘Big 5’ CAM therapies as defined in a 
report by the House of Lords in 200029 (chiropractic, 
osteopathy, acupuncture, herbal medicine and homoeop-
athy); as well as Anthroposophic Medicine (AM). AM is 
an extension of conventional medicine and incorporates 
a holistic approach to people and nature and to illness 
and healing and is established in 80 countries, mostly in 
Central Europe.30 AM has been included so that future 
comparison with data in other European countries is 
possible.
In the UK each of these six therapies is either state 
regulated (osteopathy and chiropractic) or has volun-
tary regulation (including a voluntary regulatory body 
for mainstream healthcare practitioners in the case of 
acupuncture and homoeopathy). The regulatory bodies 
were therefore initially approached by email to check the 
best route of establishing which practitioners on their 
registers were trained as a conventional GP and trained 
in IM/CAM as well. Details of the organisations and 
methods by which IM GPs were identified are indicated in 
table 1. Where organisations were not able to provide this 
information, searches were made of the online registers 
(between May and June 2017) for the following:

1. Location: the registers enabled us to search for practi-
tioners either on a nationwide (England/UK) basis or 
by county (in the latter case, all English counties were 
checked, including recent boundary changes).
2. Qualification: in some databases, only healthcare pro-
fessionals (eg, practitioners qualified in biomedicine) 
were included, and GP status was specified. Where 
this was not the case, titles were given and the absence 
of the title ‘Dr’ was used to exclude practitioners from 
our study. Where qualifications were also identified, 
practitioners with PhDs but not being a GP could 
be excluded. And if no additional information was 
given on the register, online searches were made of 
the practitioner to establish their professional quali-
fications. In all cases, putative IM GPs were checked 
against the General Medical Council (GMC) register, 
to confirm whether they were currently permitted to 
work in medical practice in the UK.
Identification of NHS General Practices employing IM GPs
Practice location(s) were indicated for each GP registrant 
identified in the CAM registers indicated in table 1. These 
workplaces were then checked against both the practice 
websites and the NHS website (www. 
nhs. 
uk), which lists 
all NHS practices and gives information such as staff lists. 
This acted to confirm the working location of the GP 
and whether this practice offered provision within NHS 
England.
Data
Monthly prescribing data were obtained from NHS 
Digital. NHS Digital collect data and information about 
a wide range of General Practice (GP) services, for many 
different organisations and purposes. It also collates all 
primary care prescribing data. These data are released for 
monthly download via the NHS Digital website (http:// 
digital. 
nhs. 
uk/ 
searchcatalogue). Data are released at 
the specific healthcare provider level and volumes are 
provided by full British National Formulation code (BNF 
code). To determine mean antibiotic prescription rates, 
we used the total number of oral antibiotic prescriptions 
per general practice for the most recent calendar year for 
which antibiotic prescribing was publicly available via the 
NHS Digital website (January 2016 to December 2016).
Specific Therapeutic group Age–sex weighting Related Prescribing 
Units
Specific Therapeutic group Age–sex weighting Related 
Prescribing Units (STAR-PUs) have been used as the 
denominator instead of the number of registered 
patients as STAR-PUs allow more accurate and mean-
ingful comparisons within a specific therapeutic group 
by considering the types of people who will be receiving 
that treatment. The amount of STAR-PU per practice was 
estimated by multiplying the number of patients in each 
age–gender category.31
Comorbidities
The prevalence of various comorbidities that may 
adversely influence the outcome of infections, based on 
the conditions that indicate high-risk patients who qualify 
for the free seasonal influenza vaccination programme,32 
was also measured to identify potential case-mix differ-
ences that may explain different antibiotic prescribing 
rates. General practice-specific prevalence is available 
for the following high-risk comorbidities via the Quality

Outcomes Framework indicators at the NHS Digital 
website: asthma, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure and diabetes. 
We extracted comorbidity prevalence for the financial 
year 2015–2016.
Indices of multiple deprivation
Previously it has been shown that indices of multiple 
deprivation are indicators of poor health in a popula-
tion. Tosas Auguet et al33 for example, found that more 
deprived areas are at higher risk of methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus infection. The most recent index of 
multiple deprivation was calculated in 2015 and is avail-
able from the Department for Communities and Local 
Government.34 Deprivation scores are available at a 
lower-layer super output area (LSOA), which consists of 
approximately 1500 residents each. Linkage of the data 
from NHS Digital was performed using a lookup table 
from NHS Digital. Where a practice served multiple 
LSOAs, the average deprivation score for that practice 
was calculated, weighted by the number of patients in 
each LSOA.
The final dataset included only practices that were 
present in both the comorbidity and deprivation, and 
antibiotic prescribing files. We removed outliers based 
on practice size, since there were some doubts about the 
validity of these data (eg, a practice with 157 patients 
registered). We removed the outer 2% of data based on 
practice size.
statistical analysis
All analyses are performed on GP surgery level (here-
after referred to as GPs). Potential differences in antibi-
otic prescribing rates per STAR-PU between the IM and 
conventional GPs were evaluated. NHS Digital defines 
a prescription item as: ‘a prescription item is a single 
supply of a medicine, dressing or appliance written on a 
prescription form’. If a prescription form includes three 
medicines, it is counted as three prescription items. We 
tested for between group differences using a random 
effects meta-analysis model for proportions (R package 
‘meta’). For continuous variables like the number of 
STAR-PU per practices Mann-Whitney U tests were used 
to test for statistically significant differences.
The association between the IM GPs and antibiotic 
prescribing rates per STAR-PU was assessed using negative 
binomial regression models with the number of antibiotic 
prescriptions as the outcome and the natural logarithm 
of the number of STAR-PU per practice as an offset. A 
negative binomial regression model was used as this type 
of regression model can handle count data (number of 
antibiotic prescriptions), accounts for differences in the 
number of antibiotics purely caused by practice size (by 
including the offset) and can still provide valid results 
when the variance in antibiotic use does not equal the 
mean antibiotic use.35 Both crude results and results 
adjusted for additional variables to correct for potential 
confounding are presented.
We additionally evaluated associations between IM GPs 
and antibiotics commonly used for RTI (amoxicillin, amox-
icillin and enzyme inhibitor, ampicillin, clarithromycin, 
doxycycline, erythromycin and phenoxymethylpeni-
cillin) and for UTI (cephalexin, cefixime, ciprofloxacin, 
nitrofurantoin, pivmecillinam and trimethoprim).36
results
Identification of nhs IM GPs in england
Eight hundred and fifty CAM practitioner records were 
checked against the various CAM registers (table 1) 
to identify 21 GPs who are conventionally trained as a 
GP and also trained in CAM at 19 NHS GP surgeries in 
England (table 2). It should be noted that the 850 regis-
trants were not the total numbers of CAM practitioners 
on the registers, as (as previously described) some regis-
ters permitted limiting searches to medical practitioners, 
or more specifically to medically qualified doctors.
While some practices were publicly working in an IM 
structure, in others it was unknown whether the iden-
tified GP was using IM/CAM or indeed whether or the 
practice permitted this, as no mention was made of it on 
the websites (including no reference to privately available 
CAM clinics). General Practices were therefore classified 
into two subsets as indicated in table 2. There were further 
IM GPs on the register who were either not practising (or 
at least not in England), or working in private practice. As 
any level of IM/CAM activity in subset 2 practices could 
not be determined, it was decided to exclude these GP 
surgeries from further analysis. Nine NHS IM GP surgeries 
(urban (n=6), semiurban (n=2) and semirural (n=1)) 
were included in the analysis. table 2 also shows the CAM 
therapies for which each IM GP in our subsequent anal-
ysis was registered. Each practice included has at least one 
IM GP, as GP partner or salaried. The number of IM GPs

per practice varies from a minimum of 1 IM GP in a prac-
tice with 12 GPs of whom 6 part time, to a maximum of 3 
IM GPs (all GP practice partners) in a practice with 7 GPs 
(two full-time GPs and five part time GPs).
Antibiotic prescription rates
In total 7283 NHS England General Practices (N_
conventional=7274/N_IMGPs=9) were included in 
the analyses. Table 3 presents the baseline character-
istic of the NHS IM GP surgeries compared with those 
characteristic of NHS conventional GPs in England. 
It also shows the prevalence of various comorbidities 
that may adversely influence the outcome of infections 
and may consequently influence antibiotic prescribing. 
The patient populations of both kinds of practices 
were comparable for most of the listed comorbidities. 
Statistically significant differences (P<0.05) between 
the IM GP- and conventional GP surgery patient popu-
lation were found in the percentage of patients with 
coronary heart disease, cancer and diabetes, although 
absolute differences were relatively small. No statis-
tical differences (P<0.05) were found in deprivation 
score between IM GP surgeries and conventional GP 
surgeries.
IM GP surgeries and antibiotic prescription rates
Overall within the NHS in England, the median prescrip-
tion rates of IM GP surgeries were lower for ‘any anti-
biotic’ and for ‘RTI-specific antibiotic’ compared with 
the rates of the conventional GP surgeries over 2016, 
while the median prescription rates of ‘UTI-specific 
antibiotic’ per STAR-PU were comparable for the two 
groups (table 4).
The relative risks (RRs) in table 4 were obtained using 
negative binomial regression models with the number 
of antibiotic prescriptions as the outcome and taking 
into account differences in practice sizes. Our analysis 
shows that IM GP surgeries were associated with lower 
prescriptions of ‘any antibiotic’ (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 
to 0.97) and with lower prescriptions of ‘RTI-specific 
antibiotic’ (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.94*). Patients 
consulting an IM GP surgery were 22% less likely to 
get ‘any antibiotic’ prescription compared with those 
who consulted a conventional GP surgery. Receiving 
a RTI-specific antibiotic prescription was 26% less 
likely among those who consulted an IM GP surgery 
compared with those who consulted a conventional GP 
surgery. No statistically significant difference (P<0.05) 
was found in the number of prescriptions of UTI-spe-
cific antibiotic prescriptions per STAR-PU between IM 
GP surgeries and conventional GP surgeries within the 
NHS in England.
Adjustment 
for 
deprivation 
score 
or 
diabetes 
resulted in virtually identical results. For ‘any antibi-
otic’ if adjusted for deprivation score the RR for IM GP 
surgeries remains virtually identical (RR 0.78, 95% CI 
0.64 to 0.97), and for diabetes (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 
0.99). This was the case regardless of which confounder 
was added to the model, however adjusting for multiple 
potential confounders was not possible due to the small 
number of cases.

DIsCussIOn
There were 7283 NHS England General Practices 
included in our analyses. Despite the very small propor-
tion of IM GP surgeries, our data show that significantly 
fewer ‘total antibiotics’ and ‘RTI-specific antibiotics’ per 
STAR-PU were prescribed at IM GP surgeries compared 
with conventional GP surgeries within NHS England over 
2016. No statistically significant differences were found in 
median prescription rates of ‘UTI-specific antibiotics’ per 
STAR-PU in the two kinds of NHS GP surgeries.
This is the first (retrospective) study comparing anti-
biotic prescribing rates between IM GP surgeries and 
conventional GP surgeries in England. However, the small 
proportion of NHS IM GPs in England asks for careful 
interpretation of the results. Accounting for one other 
variable (eg, deprivation or diabetes) did not change our 
results, but, due to the low number of cases it was not 
possible to similarly account for more variables.
Lack of information on the number of consultations is 
the main limitation of this study. Consultation rates may 
explain most of the variation in antibiotic prescribing, 
and with the data used in this study, it is not clear whether 
patients consulting at IM GP surgeries consulted less in 
general. If this were the case, they may be equally likely 
to receive antibiotics when they do consult their GP. 
Besides, previous studies show that the consultation rate 
is also dependent on the previous likelihood to receive 
antibiotics for a RTI.37–39 Future studies should therefore 
include consultation behaviour/number of consultations 
as a confounding factor.
Other study limitations that need to be taken into 
account when interpreting the results are the lack of 
information on (1) individual deprivation scores, (2) 
individual GP characteristics and (3) continuum of care. 
First, no statistically significant differences were found 
in deprivation score on practice level. However, this may 
be partly because deprivation scores are area based and 
not based on the individuals registered at the different 
practices. Second, our analyses are at GP practice level 
and include information on GP practice characteristics, 
such as list size and population. Data on GP characteris-
tics on individual level are not part of NHS Digital data 
and are therefore not included in our analysis. However, 
these GP characteristics may partly explain the variation 
in antibiotic prescribing.40–42 Finally, the data used for our 
analysis are based on the number of antibiotic ‘prescrip-
tions’, which may differ from the numbers of antibiotics 
‘consumed’, and do not include information on the 
continuum of care of patients (eg, hospital admissions/
reconsultation). Future studies using clinical practice data 
taking continuum of care into account are warranted.
The lower antibiotic prescription rates of IM GPs are in 
line with the current national guidance aimed at reducing 
antibiotic usage and AMR.1 IM GPs might possible comply 
more closely with this guidance. However, the difference 
found could also be partly explained by the fact that 
patients who consult IM GPs might demand less for anti-
biotics, and that GPs in IM surgeries have other avenues 
to offer to patients than antibiotics or that they are more 
confident to delay prescriptions and to assert themselves 
against the wishes of those patients who appear to want 
antibiotics. Our results are in line with a yet unpublished 
pilot study in The Netherlands in which the prescrip-
tion of antimicrobials for systemic use in 23 unselected 
anthroposophic GP surgeries was compared with the 
national mean GP figures for the years 2012–2014. On 
average AM GPs in the Netherlands prescribed less anti-
microbials: −13% (2012), –10% (2013) and −7% (2014) 
(unpublished data).
Despite the differences we found in RTI antibiotics, no 
statistically significant differences were found in UTI anti-
biotics prescription rates between the two kinds of NHS 
GP surgeries. Although it should be borne in mind that 
the use of prescribing data to infer the type of infection 
may be prone to errors, our finding reflects current UK 
GP clinical guidance.
For the majority of RTIs it is recommended that anti-
biotics should be avoided or delayed, so that this is an

area where the desired reduction in prescribing could 
take place. In the case of UTIs, antibiotics are advised 
more readily.36 For several RTIs, including common 
colds, sore throat, sinusitis and acute bronchitis, 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that 
antibiotics provide no, or negligible benefit compared 
with placebo.43–46 As such, symptom management with 
paracetamol, ibuprofen or the use of CAM therapies 
proven to be effective and safe for RTIs may safely reduce 
antibiotic prescribing among patients with a low risk for 
pneumonia. A recent RCT comparing ibuprofen with 
fosfomycin treatment for UTIs indicates that it may be 
more difficult to safely reduce antibiotic prescribing for 
UTIs using a similar approach.47
Our study shows that accessibility of IM/CAM within the 
NHS in General Practice is very limited, and this limited 
the number of IM GPs included in our analysis. IM/
CAM provision is currently almost exclusively privately 
provided in the UK, which could be at least partly linked 
to the austerity measures currently imposed in the UK 
possibly resulting in NHS IM/CAM provision being with-
drawn at a local level in recent years (and imminently 
nationally). It was seen on practice websites that there was 
a noticeable amount of ‘private’ CAM provision available 
at several NHS surgeries by non-GP CAM practitioners—
in weekly clinics for example. However, these surgeries 
have not been included in our analysis as this study specif-
ically aimed to determine the differences in antibiotic 
prescribing between conventional GP surgeries and GP 
surgeries staffing GPs who were additionally trained in 
IM/CAM.
Attitudes of GPs to IM/CAM are extremely important 
for it to remain available within the NHS. A 2015 study 
of these attitudes in England, showed that, despite 
demand for CAM among the general public, GPs remain 
concerned about its limited evidence base as well as the 
lack of regulation of CAM practitioners. Nevertheless, 
those questioned continue to see a role for CAM in clin-
ical practice.48
In our study each of the NHS IM GP practices included 
at least 1 IM GP. However, as the number of (IM) GP 
partners and salaried (IM) GPs (full time and part time) 
in these practices varies, proportions of the number of 
IM GPs per included NHS IM GP surgery are difficult to 
determine and in addition, will not provide meaningful 
information as they do not take into account the power 
balance of the different GPs within these practices.
The impact which any one IM GP could have in terms 
of antibiotic prescribing may vary hugely between prac-
tices partly depending on their status at the practice—
as a partner or a salaried employee for example, or as a 
full-time or part time worker. In the presented analysis we 
did not include NHS GP practices that are offering NHS 
IM/CAM provision by a ‘non-GP NHS CAM practitioner’ 
or private IM/CAM practitioner. However, having even 
one CAM contact within a surgery might give the possi-
bility for others to experience CAM perspectives either 
formally or informally from them, and for long-held 
attitudes to be perhaps modified. Additionally, it would 
be of interest to explore if patients may be independently 
accessing IM GPs in the private sector and then seeking 
antibiotics from non-IM GPs in the NHS.
In line with Hawker et al49 our results suggest that a 
further decrease in prescribing in conventional surgeries 
might be possible. It may be that advice should be sought 
from this small number of surgeries to establish whether 
their daily clinical practice may differ from other surgeries 
and whether this could be used to assist others in the fight 
against AMR.
Although this study found only a small number of 
CAM practitioners working at NHS General Practices in 
England, the difference seen in antibiotic prescribing 
rates at IM GP surgeries warrants further study. It is 
very likely that, due to similarity in healthcare system 
(NHS) and the number of NHS IM GPs and—surgeries, 
our findings are generalisable to Scotland, Wales and 
Northern Ireland. However, differences in healthcare 
systems and the general level of IM practice may lead to 
other results in other (European) countries. Therefore, 
analysis in comparison with other (European) coun-
tries are indicated to prove whether in general IM GP 
(surgeries) tend to prescribe less antibiotics or whether 
other (socioeconomic) factors dominate the prescription 
rate for specific infections.
As the clear majority of CAM practitioners (mainly 
non-GPs) work privately in England, there is also poten-
tial for research into non-antibiotic strategies in private 
practice, and to analysis of how these practitioners work 
with their patients’ NHS GPs in this regard. However, as 
patients who self-select to consult IM GPs might be less 
likely to demand antibiotics, differences in lifestyle and 
the ‘transferability of lifestyle skills’ need to be taken into 
account as well in future study design.
