Introduction: A number of studies have shown a U-shaped association between sleep duration and mortality. Since sleep duration is partly genetically 
determined, it seems likely that its association with mortality is also genetically influenced. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence on 
heredity on the association between sleep duration and mortality.
Methods: We used a cohort of 14 267 twins from the Swedish Twin Registry.
Results: A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, adjusted for a number of covariates, confirmed a clear U shape with a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.34 and 
95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15–1.57 for a sleep duration of ≤6.5 hours and HR = 1.18 (CI = 1.07–1.30) for sleep of ≥9.5 hours. Reference value was 7.0 
hours. A co-twin analysis of 1942 twins discordant on mortality showed a HR = 2.66 (CI = 1.17–6.04) for long (≥9.5 hours) sleep in monzygotic twins and an 
HR = 0.66 (CI = 0.20–2.14) for short (<6.5 hours) sleep. In dizygotic twins, no association was significant. The heritability for mortality was 28% for the whole 
group, while it was 86% for short sleepers and 42% for long sleepers. Thus, the link with mortality for long sleep appears to be more due to environmental 
factors than to heredity, while heritability dominates among short sleepers.
Conclusions: We found that both long and short sleep were associated with higher total mortality, that the difference in mortality within twin pairs is associated 
with long sleep, and that short sleep has a higher heritability for mortality, while long sleep is associated with more environmental influences on mortality.
Keywords: CVD, cancer, sleep duration, TST, sleep quality, snoring.
INTRODUCTION
One of the most common questions concerning sleep is: “how 
much should we sleep?” Several systematic reviews on sleep 
duration and mortality have found that the optimal sleep dura-
tion is 7 hours, with a significant increase of overall mortality 
for individuals with short (≤6 hours) or long (≥8 hours) sleep.1–3 
In a critical review, Kurina et al.4 argue that results from the 
literature are not totally consistent. The analysis of Kurina et al. 
included 42 studies and only 14 of these showed a U-shaped 
relationship, while 23 studies (43%) showed no association 
at all, and the remainder showed associations for either short 
or long sleep. Their main arguments against the presence of 
a U-shaped association between sleep and mortality are the 
heterogeneity in the measurement of sleep duration and in its 
categorization, the use of different methods and variables for 
adjusting for potential confounders across studies, and different 
age ranges. In a study focusing on age, we found that the asso-
ciation between sleep duration and mortality was stronger in 
young age groups than in older individuals, but the effect was 
significant for those of 70 years of age and below (Akerstedt 
et al., subm).
One weakness with prior studies is that the exposure varia-
ble in most cases has asked for “usual sleep duration” or some 
similar phrasing. This may invoke a more approximate estimate 
than if information on the specific bedtime and time of rising 
were requested. Presumably, this is easier to remember and does 
not require the respondent to mentally compute the difference 
between lights out and time of awakening.
One might also assume that the association between sleep 
duration and mortality depends on genetic factors, apart from 
the exposure to environmental factors. The correlation of sleep 
duration between identical twins is approximately r = 0.30–
0.40.5–7 Thus, using twins for a study of sleep duration and 
mortality may increase the understanding of the association. 
In particular, a low degree of heritability would indicate envi-
ronmental influences on the link between sleep and mortality. 
Such influences would suggest that intervention strategies may 
be successful. No prior work is available on hereditary aspects 
on the link between sleep duration and mortality.
The main purpose of the present study was to quantify the 
association between sleep duration and subsequent mortality in 
a group of twins in the age range of 54–99 years and to com-
pare monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins discordant 
on mortality.
METHODS
Design
The design was a prospective cohort study. All twins born in 
Sweden before 1959 were invited to participate in the Screening 
Across the Lifespan Twin (SALT) study conducted by the 
Swedish Twin Registry.8 Each individual participated in the 
SALT computer-assisted telephone interview once between 
January 1998 and March 2003. The response rate was 74%, the 
total sample encompassed 61 326 individuals.
The interview included a number of items regarding different 
diseases and symptoms, and the procedure for data collection 
and zygosity determination has previously been described in 
detail elsewhere.8 A subsample of SALT was asked a battery 
of questions on sleep length and quality, and 14 267 individu-
als responded to these and were included in the present study. 
Dates and causes of deaths were obtained from the Swedish 
Cause of Death Register and linked to the twins by using the 
Statement of Significance
Apart from confirming previous work showing a U-shaped relation between sleep duration and mortality, the present study adds new information showing 
that the long sleeper in a twin pair has a higher mortality and that the link between short sleep and mortality is strongly hereditary, whereas that of long 
sleep is less hereditary, indicating that environmental factors are more important.

unique person identification number available for all Swedish 
citizens. The project was approved by the Regional Ethical 
Review Board of Stockholm.
Variables
The exposed group was defined according to the sleep dura-
tion obtained from the questions: “When do you normally turn 
out the light to sleep” and “When do you normally wake up?” 
The difference constituted the estimated sleep duration. Since 
this estimate will include periods of time awake, “sleep period” 
would be a more appropriate label, but virtually all the available 
literature uses the label “sleep duration” and we will, therefore, 
retain the latter label. The twins were followed for all cause, as 
well as cause-specific, mortality due to cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) or cancer from the date of interview until the date of 
death or the end of follow-up, December 31, 2014.
The following variables were used as covariates: age, sex, 
educational level (0 = 9 years [reference], 1 = 10–12, 2 = ≥12 
years,). Tobacco use (0 = no tobacco [reference], 1 = tobacco 
use [includes current or previous regular smoking/snuffing as 
well as occasional smoking or snuffing]). Alcohol use (0 = no 
alcohol consumption [reference], 5 = high alcohol consump-
tion). Physical activity (0 = moderate exercise [reference], 1 = 
low exercise, 2 = high exercise). (Question in SALT: “Of these 
7 alternatives, which fits your annual exercise pattern?”). Body 
mass index (BMI) (0 = normal weight [>18.5–25] [reference], 
1 = underweight [≤18.5], 3 = overweight [>25–30], 4 = obesity 
[>30]). Only one participant was underweight and was removed. 
Coffee use (1 = no coffee [reference], 2 = 1–2 cups a day, 3 = 
3–4 cups a day; 4 = ≥5 cups a day). Previous cancer (0 = no 
cancer [reference], 1 = have cancer) at the time of the interview. 
Severity of disease was assessed by asking SALT participants 
“Do you have or have you had [here 53 different health problems 
and conditions were mentioned]” and responses were classified, 
based on their most severe illness, into categories: no disease, 
not at all life-threatening (eg, migraine), somewhat life-threat-
ening (such as high blood pressure), and life threatening (eg, 
stroke), according to the expected impact of the disease. A more 
detailed description of this variable and categorization is found 
elsewhere.9,10 For sleep problems, one item from the Karolinska 
Sleep Questionnaire was used: “How often have you had dis-
turbed or restless sleep during the last 6 months”? Response 
alternatives were: never, seldom, sometimes, most of the time, 
and always. For the present analysis, the last three items were 
combined to one category (disturbed sleep). The first two items 
were combined to “no disturbed sleep”. The other question 
was: “How often have you had heavy snoring during the last 6 
months”? The response alternatives were the same as for dis-
turbed sleep, as was the formation of categories.
Statistical Analysis
Sleep duration was categorized as: <6.5 hours, 6.5–7.4 hours, 
7.5–8.4 hours, 8.5–9.4 hours, and ≥9.5 hours. The reference 
value for sleep duration was based on the review by Cappuccio 
et al.,1 indicating that the most common reference was 7 hours. 
Frequencies were calculated for all variables in each category 
of sleep duration. Multiple Cox Proportional Hazard regres-
sion analyses were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between 
sleep duration and mortality, as well as cause-specific mor-
tality for CVD and cancer. The analyses were clustered on 
twin-pair identity to adjust for twin dependency within pairs. 
In the analyses of associations, covariates were entered step-
wise and consequently individuals with missing information 
on a specific covariate were excluded in the analyses including 
that specific covariate. Conditional Cox Proportional Hazard 
regression was used to assess HR for mortality between twin 
pairs discordant for mortality. These analyses utilize the fact 
that twins in a pair are optimally matched on genetics (MZ 
100% and DZ on average 50%) and shared (early family) envi-
ronmental factors (100%) when reared together, and for age 
and sex. By comparing the results of the conditional model 
with the unconditional model, the impact of familial factors 
on the associations can be assessed. The conditional analyses 
were also stratified on zygosity, as MZ twin pairs are more 
closely matched on genetics than DZ pairs. If the association 
between the risk factor and mortality is due to genetics and 
family background, the association should exist in the analyses 
of the whole cohort but not in discordant twin pairs. However, 
if genetic factors play a role, the association should attenuate 
within MZ twin pairs but not within DZ twin pairs. If the asso-
ciation attenuates in both MZ and DZ discordant pairs, this 
would indicate presence of familial confounding, mainly from 
shared (family) environment. If the association is found to be 
independent from familial effects (caused by nonfamilial envi-
ronmental factors such as adulthood experiences and choices), 
the association should be found in all twin pairs.11 Moreover, 
a conditional model additionally adjusted for education, cof-
fee consumption, smoking, BMI, and severity of disease was 
estimated.
All individuals contributed with time from the date of the 
interview until death or end of follow-up, December 31, 2014. 
Moreover, familial aggregation of mortality among those with 
short and long sleep duration was calculated based on poly-
choric within-pair correlations (r) for MZ and DZ twin pairs. 
Thereafter, the proportion of variance attributed to additive 
genetic effects, that is, the fraction of population variance due 
to genetic variance was estimated as 2(rMZ – rDZ) (heritability 
[h2]), under the basic assumptions of the classical twin study.12 
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4.
RESULTS
Table 1 displays the background variables in the different 
groups of sleep duration.
Table 2 shows that both the shortest and the longest sleep 
duration were significantly associated with mortality. Physical 
activity, alcohol intake, and snoring were excluded from the 
analysis because of a large nonresponse rate (>50%). In a sepa-
rate analysis on a smaller sample for the two first variables, the 
results remained significant. For snoring, short sleep remained 
significant, but the HR for long sleep was reduced to HR = 1.13 
(0.99–1.29) (data not shown). We also tested separately for prior 
CVD, diabetes, and major depression, but the results remained 
almost exactly the same. Sleep problems, which seem to add to 
the ill health effects of short sleep, were also tested as a covari-
ate, but results remained exactly the same.13

Sleep Duration, Mortality, and Heredity—Åkerstedt et al.
Similar analyses were made for death due to CVD and can-
cer, but none of the results were significant after adjusting for 
sex, age, education, coffee intake, smoking, and BMI (data not 
shown). Since there is a possibility of reverse causality, deaths 
within 3 years of the interview were excluded, and a reanalysis 
performed, but the result was almost exactly the same as in the 
original analysis.
Table 3 shows that for discordant twins, long sleep duration 
was significantly associated with mortality during the follow-up 
among all pairs (MZ+DZ) and also among MZ twins when data 
were analyzed separately by zygosity group. HRs for MZ twin 
pairs were even higher than HRs for the whole sample. DZ twins 
showed a higher HR for long sleep duration, however, with wide 
CIs. When the analysis was adjusted for education, coffee con-
sumption, smoking, BMI, and severity of disease, the HR became 
1.58 (CI 1.05–2.37) for the whole group of discordant pairs.
For all twins, regardless of sleep duration, the within-pair cor-
relation for mortality was r = 0.40 for MZ twins and 0.26 for 
DZ twins, with heritability of 28% for mortality (h2 = 0.28). For 
short sleepers (<6.5 hours) the corresponding estimates were 
r = 0.58 for MZ pairs, r = 0.15 for DZ pairs, with h2 = 0.86 
for mortality. For long sleepers (≥9.5 hours), the values were 
r = 0.58 for MZ pairs, r = 0.37 for DZ pairs, with h2 = 0.42 
for mortality. Thus, the heritability for mortality was strong 
among the short sleepers and moderate among the long sleep-
ers. Table 4 shows number of twin pairs in each exposure group 
by zygosity and sleep duration.
DISCUSSION
The results show that both short (<6.5 hours) and long (≥9.5 
hours) sleep were associated with higher mortality. Analyses 
of discordant MZ twins showed longer sleep linked to mortal-
ity, whereas short sleep was not. In addition, short sleep had a 
higher heritability for mortality, while long sleep was associ-
ated with more environmental influences for mortality.

Sleep Duration, Mortality, and Heredity—Åkerstedt et al.
The U-shaped association between sleep duration and mortal-
ity essentially agrees with previous meta-analyses,1–3,14 except 
for Liu et al.,14 who found a J-shaped one. The explanation of 
the U-shaped association between sleep duration and mortality 
has been discussed in most previous work in this area. Thus, 
conditions like comorbidities, BMI, alcohol consumption, 
educational level, employment status, work schedules, snor-
ing, physical activity, napping, use of hypnotics, and depres-
sion were considered and adjusted for, or tested separately, 
and should not have affected our outcomes. Grandner et al.15 
suggested that short sleep might have similar effects to those 
caused by low-grade inflammation, and that increased levels 
of ghrelin, increased lipid levels, and insulin resistance could 
be involved in this process. The mechanism involved in the 
association between long sleep and mortality still defies spec-
ulation, apart from the possibility of residual confounding or 
undetected diseases.
It should be emphasized that the optimal sleep period from 
a longevity point of view in the present study actually spans 
the interval from 6.5 to 9.5 hours. This includes the consensus 
lower limit of sufficient sleep (7 hours) as established by the 
consensus committee of the American Sleep Research Society 
and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.16 It is also note-
worthy that the unadjusted analysis shows significant and con-
siderably higher HRs for sleep ≥7.5 hours, particularly for ≥9.5 
hours. While these high risks are due to confounding, it is also 
what characterizes the population at large, that is, long sleep is 
linked to premature death, whether it is due to severe disease 
or not.
Some input to the discussion of the U-shape mentioned above 
could possibly be derived from the new finding of higher mor-
tality for long sleep in discordant MZ twins. Since the herita-
bility of mortality among short sleepers was strong, but that of 
long sleep duration low, it appears that genetics plays a role for 
the association between short sleep and mortality, but less so 
for long sleep. The implication is that exposure to environmen-
tal factors not shared within twin pairs may be important for 
the association between long sleep duration and mortality. This 
may include differing exposure to work demands, adult family 
demands, socioeconomic disadvantage, contagious diseases, 
boredom, lifestyle, or major life events. The present cohort 
does not contain information on most of these factors; however, 
educational level was adjusted for, which may be considered a 
proxy for some of these but not all. Clearly, there is a need for 
research into the environmental factors behind long sleep. With 
more knowledge about causative factors, interventions to ame-
liorate effects may be designed. In contrast, the results suggest

Sleep Duration, Mortality, and Heredity—Åkerstedt et al.
that short sleep, with its strong influence of genetics, may pres-
ent more of a challenge for interventions.
The heritability of mortality for all participants was 28%. 
This is relatively close to previous estimates of 30%–40%.5–7 
However, the large difference in heritability between long and 
short sleepers was unexpected. No previous data seem availa-
ble, and future studies should attempt to confirm this finding 
and to explain the difference.
The present study has several limitations. Thus, the infor-
mation on exposure is self-reported, but this is the case with 
all other larger studies of the present topic. Still, interpretation 
should be made with caution. Different cutoffs for sleep dura-
tion may have affected the results slightly, but the significant 
increases in HRs for the extreme sleep durations appear robust. 
Information on workload in paid and unpaid work is lacking 
but may to some extent be compensated for through informa-
tion on education. The number of participants is above average, 
compared to other studies, but greater numbers may have been 
useful for subgroup analyses. A strength of the study is the use 
of the Swedish personal number system, which almost com-
pletely prevents loss of information on death. Another strength 
is the high quality of the cause of death registry and the long 
follow-up. A particular advantage is the analysis of heredity, 
which has not been carried out before.
In conclusion, the present study has shown that both long and 
short sleep are associated with higher total mortality, that the 
difference in mortality within twin pairs is associated with long 
sleep, and that short sleep has a higher heritability for mortality, 
while long sleep is associated with more environmental influ-
ences on mortality. Heredity is clearly of importance for the 
link between sleep duration and mortality.
