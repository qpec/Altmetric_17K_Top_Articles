ABSTRACT
Introduction: Lung cancer is the leading cause of years of
life lost because of cancer and is associated with the highest
economic burden relative to other tumor types. Research
remains at the cornerstone of achieving improved outcomes
of lung cancer. We present the results of a comprehensive
analysis of global lung cancer research between 2004 and
2013 (10 years).
Methods: The study used bibliometrics to undertake a
quantitative analysis of research output in the 24 leading
countries in cancer research internationally on the basis
of articles and reviews in the Web of Science (WoS)
database.
Results: A total of 32,161 lung cancer research articles from
2085 different journals were analyzed. Lung cancer research
represented only 5.6% of overall cancer research in 2013, a
1.2% increase since 2004. The commitment to lung cancer
research has fallen in most countries apart from China and
shows no correlation with lung cancer burden. A review
of key research types demonstrated that diagnostics,
screening, and quality of life research represent 4.3%, 1.8%,
and 0.3% of total lung cancer research, respectively. The
leading research types were genetics (20%), systemic ther-
apies (17%), and prognostic biomarkers (16%). Research
output is increasingly basic science, with a decrease in
clinical translational research output during this period.
Conclusions: Our findings have established that relative to
the huge health, social, and economic burden associated
with lung cancer, the level of world research output lags
significantly behind that of research on other malignancies.
Commitment to diagnostics, screening, and quality of life
research is much lower than to basic science and medical
research. The study findings are expected to provide the
requisite knowledge to guide future cancer research pro-
grams in lung cancer.

Introduction
In 2013 it was estimated that there were 14.9 million
incident cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths.1 Of these
cases, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer
death globally in both high-income and low- and middle-
income countries, accounting for 1.6 million cancer
deaths annually (approximately 20% of total cancer
deaths), with an estimated 1.8 million new cases annu-
ally worldwide.2 Importantly, with the cigarette smoking
habit established in lower-resource countries some
years ago, the global burden of lung cancer will continue
to grow for the coming decades.
It is not just the human cost that one needs to
consider but the wider economic burden. A recent
analysis of the costs associated with cancer care in the
European Union demonstrated that relative to other
cancers, lung cancer is associated with the highest eco-
nomic costs (V18.8 billion or 15% of total cancer care
costs) followed by breast cancer (12%) and colorectal
cancer (10%).3 These costs incorporate both the direct
costs of managing the disease at all stages as well as the
opportunity costs associated with the loss of productiv-
ity due to premature mortality and the indirect costs of
informal care.
Although public health and policy efforts aim to
reduce smoking initiation and increase cessation (espe-
cially in emerging economies),4,5 for those in whom lung
cancer has been diagnosed the outcomes remain poor.
The mean age-standardized 5-year survival rate is 13.0%
in Europe (varying from 9% to 14.8% across Europe)6
and 16% in the United States.7 The reasons are multi-
ple and include the absence of a cost-effective screening
tool, late stage at the time of diagnosis (65% of patients
present with locally advanced or metastatic disease8),
socioeconomic inequalities in health care access,9,10 and
the challenge in obtaining a histological diagnosis.11
Furthermore, median survival time in advanced disease
with
standard
chemotherapeutic
regimens
has
not
changed in the past two decades and remains at
approximately 12 months.12
Cancer research is one of the most globally active
domains of science, with more than $14 billion per
annum in public and private expenditure.13 Research is
at the core of achieving improved outcomes from cancer,
be it in defining country-specific epidemiology of the
disease, understanding the pathogenesis of disease,
identifying
new
targets
for
therapeutic
agents,
or
directing policy to achieve affordable and equitable
outcomes.14 It is therefore important to understand
from a public policy perspective how, why, and which
particular research domains evolve and have an impact
on outcomes.
In this article we present the results of a bibliometric
analysis of global research on lung cancer between 2004
and 2013 (10 years) in the 24 leading countries in
cancer research. This type of analysis is now used
routinely to evaluate large numbers of scientific articles
in a given research domain.15,16 We examine the growth
in output from these countries, their relative commit-
ment to lung cancer research compared with all cancer
research output, the main research types (e.g., genetics,
chemotherapy), the amount of international collabora-
tion as a function of the outputs of leading countries, and
the impact of lung cancer research.
Methods
We performed a bibliometric analysis of research
outputs during 2004 to 2013 on the basis of articles and
reviews in the Web of Science (WoS) database. This
analysis contains full bibliographic information about the
articles, including all addresses and the numbers of ci-
tations received by each article. The WoS is considered
the optimum database for undertaking this type of eval-
uation as the use of additional biomedical databases does
not significantly increase the yield of relevant journals.
We identified the lung cancer articles by means of a
specially developed algorithm formed by the intersection
of two filters. Each filter consisted of lists of specialist
journals for cancer (185 journals) and lung disease (11
journals), as well as specific title words relating to both
subjects. All articles within the specialist cancer or lung
disease journals were selected in addition to articles in
nonspecialist journals that contained one or more of the
title words. This approach had a precision or specificity
of 0.95 and a recall or sensitivity of the same value,
which is considered very high.17
This meant that articles in general medical journals
were also covered, and the 32,162 articles were in as
many as 2085 different journals. Nearly all of the articles
were in English (31,000 or 96.4%), but others were in 18
different languages, led by French (554), Spanish (203),
and German (168). A few were in Chinese, Japanese, or
Korean. This double filter would be expected to have
provided excellent coverage of lung cancer research,
although some basic research articles might have been
omitted if there was nothing in their titles to indicate
that they were directly relevant to lung cancer.
The details of the selected articles from the 24 lead-
ing
research-active
countries
internationally
were
downloaded. These countries accounted for approxi-
mately 97% of all lung cancer research articles pub-
lished between 2004 and 2013. The countries included
were as follows: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,
July 2016

 Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, India,
Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Republic
of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey,
United Kingdom, and the United States.
Counts of the numbers of publications per year were
obtained on both integer and fractional count bases. As
an example if an article had two addresses in Germany
and one in France, it would be counted as one for each
on an integer count basis but as 0.67 and 0.33, respec-
tively, on a fractional count basis. The articles’ addresses
were parsed so as to show the fractional contribution of
each of the 24 selected countries by means of a special
macro. The intention was for the most part to base the
analysis on fractional country counts of articles, which
give a much better impression of the relative effort
expended on the research than do integer counts.18,19
We had previously determined the numbers of pub-
lications in cancer research overall for each year and for
each of the 24 selected countries on an integer count
basis. These data were used to determine each country’s
relative
commitment
(RC)
to
lung
cancer
within
oncology overall. For example, in 2004 to 2008, Austria
published 101 lung cancer articles out of a total of 3197
for oncology (3.16%), whereas worldwide there were
12,508 lung cancer articles out of a total of 283,259
oncology articles (4.42%). So Austria’s RC was only 3.16
of 4.42, or 0.715. Similar calculations were made for the
second quinquennium (2009–2013) and for the other
23 countries.
We also investigated whether the relative commit-
ment of the individual countries corresponded to their
relative burden from lung cancer within the total for all
cancers based on the Global Burden of Disease Study for
2010 (for the interactive tool used, see http://vizhub.
healthdata.org/gbd-compare/). For this purpose, we
obtained the percentages of disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs) attributable to all cancers and to cancer of the
“trachea, bronchus and lung” for the world and for the
24 selected countries. Worldwide, the latter represents
1.31% of all DALYs out of the 7.6% for all cancers, and it
is by far the largest of the disease burdens for different
cancers at 17.2%. We then compared these percentages,
which varied from slightly more than 10% in India to
slightly less than 30% in Turkey, with the RC values for
the countries in 2009 to 2013.
Lung cancer research publications were also catego-
rized by their research type, 12 of which were defined by
means of subfilters based on title words and strings.
These subfilters were all determined by R.S. and A.A. in
collaboration with G.L. The research types used for anal-
ysis were as follows: chemotherapy, diagnosis, epide-
miology, genetics, palliative care, pathology, biomarkers,
quality of life (QoL), radiotherapy, screening, surgery, and
targeted therapies. The categories were not mutually
exclusive, and therefore, articles reviewing QoL in rela-
tion to radiotherapy studies would be included in both
categories. Fractional counts of each country and research
type were calculated, and the results were compared with
the values for the world so as to show whether a country
was overperforming or underperforming relative to the
world average in each subject area.
The research level (RL) of a country’s publications
can be calculated in two ways: (1) from the titles of the
individual articles and (2) from the journal in which the
article was published in a given quinquennium. Articles
are classified as clinical (RL ¼ 1.0) or basic (RL ¼ 4.0)
depending on whether their titles contain one or more of
a list of “clinical words” (e.g. , diagnosis, elderly) or “basic
words” (e.g., activation, binding, chromosome). These key
words, which enable classification into basic and clinical
research types, were developed and validated by G.L.20 A
macro was subsequently used to classify the words in
the title of each article and mark the article as clinical,
basic, or both. The journal RL was determined directly
from the WoS for each 5-year period from 2000. It was
possible to determine the journal RL for almost all the
articles (32,096 of 32,162 [99.8%]). Some examples of
journals frequently used for lung cancer research and
their RLs for 2010 to 2013 are as follows: Annals of
Thoracic Surgery (RL ¼ 1.17), Lung Cancer (RL ¼ 1.77),
PLoS One (RL ¼ 2.87), and Cancer Research (RL ¼ 3.28).
The overall RL for each country was determined on
the basis of fractional counts. For example, the fractional
counts for Austria in 2004 to 2008 were 34.9 “clinical”
articles, 8.2 “basic” articles, and 3.96 articles classified as
“both.” The article RL was then calculated as (34.9 þ 4 �
8.2 – 2.5 � 3.96)/(34.9 þ 8.2 – 3.96) ¼ 1.50. The sum of
Austrian fractional presences multiplied by the journal
RL was 106.1, which when divided by the Austrian
fractional total of 58.5 articles, gave a journal RL of 1.81.
This means that Austrian lung cancer researchers were
publishing clinical articles in rather more basic journals
than the average.
Actual citation impact (ACI) is the number of citations
received by an article in the 5 years beginning in the year
of publication. It is created according to a validated al-
gorithm based on actual citations of the article rather
than by using the impact factor of the journals within
which they are published. A 5-year window is used as it
represents a compromise between the need for imme-
diacy (i.e., citations to recent articles) and stability (i.e.,
inclusion of the peak year for citations, usually the sec-
ond or third year after publication). It is best determined
for a country on the basis of fractional counts, because
many of the most cited articles are multinational.
For this purpose, the articles were divided into two
3-year cohorts, 2004 to 2006 and 2007 to 2009. The
fractional counts of a country’s contributions were
1042
Aggarwal et al

 multiplied by the ACI counts for each article, these
products were summed, and the total was divided by the
sum of the country’s fractional counts for the relevant
years. The corresponding quotients for the world were
15.2 and 17.0 citations, respectively.
Another measure of citation impact is the number of
a country’s articles that receive enough citations to put
them in the top 1%, 2%, 5% and 10% of the world’s
most cited lung cancer articles. For example, the number
of articles with 137 or more citations (top 1%), 86 or
more citations (top 2%), 50 or more citations (top 5%),
and 33 or more citations (top 10%) in the 5 years after
publication. These calculations were performed for all 6
years
together
(2004–2009);
otherwise,
for
many
countries the numbers would have been too small to
analyze.
Results
Outputs of Individual Countries
Overall, world outputs have more than doubled during
the decade. Figures 1(A-D) demonstrate that between
2004 and 2013 the fractional counts of lung cancer
research articles from each of the 24 countries have
largely increased year after year. China in particular has
exhibited a marked rise in the volume of research output
over this time. On the basis of integer counts of research
publications, the United States, China, and Japan lead
the way, with Brazil, Norway, and Austria among
the least research-active countries (further detail in
Supplementary Table 1). Using fractional counts, a similar
relationship is observed, but in 2013 China overtook the
United States to become the world leader on a fractional
count
(but
not
on
an
integer
count)
basis
(see
Supplementary Table 2 for further detail). For the entire
10-year period, the United States published more than
twice as many research articles as Japan, the next ranked
country.
RCs and the BoD
Lung cancer research accounted for 4.4% of all can-
cer research in 2004, and by 2013 that figure had
increased to 5.6% in 2013. Apart from China, the RC of
most other countries in fact declined between the two
quinquennia, particularly in Belgium, Poland, France,
Norway, Italy, Spain, Greece, and the Republic of Korea
(Fig. 2). It appears from Figure 3 that there is little
correlation between relative burden of disease (BoD)
from lung cancer and RC to research in the subject area,
except that Brazil and India both suffer less than average
from lung cancer and do relatively little research;
conversely, Turkey and Greece both suffer more than
average and also do more research. Further detail is
available in Supplementary Table 3.

 database, the largest research type (genetics) accounted
for 20% of the articles, and the smallest (QoL) just 0.3%.
Research on systemic therapies, which included articles in
the chemotherapy (11.6%) and targeted agents (5.5%)
categories, was the second largest research type (17.1%).
The different research types varied in how fast they
expanded
during
the
decade
(further
detail
in
Supplementary Table 4). Between the two quinquennia
2004 to 2008 and 2009 to 2013, genetics research
remained dominant whereas research into targeted
therapies, biomarkers, and diagnostics increased relative
to that in other domains. Research into targeted thera-
pies increased more than any other research category,
with an almost parallel decrease in the percentage
of research into chemotherapy drugs. With regard to
screening and palliative care, although the volume of
research nearly doubled in this time period, the relative
contribution of research in these domains to overall lung
cancer research remained the same.
Within each of the research types, we determined the
fractional counts of articles from each of the 24 selected
countries (further detail in Supplementary Table 5). As
expected, the United States accounted for the highest
volume published in each of the categories on the basis
of fractional counts. However, fractional counts alone do
not give us specific information on the predominant
focus of lung cancer research in each individual country,
as otherwise, countries producing the largest volume of
research within a specific category would appear to have
the greatest commitment.

 The RC of the 24 countries to each research type is
presented in Figure 5, which shows a markedly het-
erogeneous picture. For instance, the Netherlands has a
strong commitment to radiotherapy and QoL research
but little commitment in the way of genetics and
epidemiological research. Norway on the other hand has
a strong commitment to epidemiological and biomarker-
based research, and the United Kingdom has a strong
commitment to palliative care and QoL research.
ACIs
These are used as measures of the influence of the
articles and of each country’s senior scientists.
Table 1 shows the countries ordered by their mean
ACI value and with the numbers of their articles (frac-
tional counts) with enough citations to put them in the
top 1%, top 2%, top 5%, or top 10% of articles on the
basis of 5-year citation scores. The United States and
Canada are the only countries with consistently superior
performance at all four of these percentiles. High–
research output countries such as China, Japan, France,
and Germany rank in the lower half of the table. Of note,
France is performing below the world average at all four
percentiles. Conversely, Denmark, Switzerland, and the
Netherlands appear to produce research with greater
impact, despite the low volume of research relative to
that of the other countries.
RL of Outputs
Charts showing the different values of RL for articles
and for journals, and in the two quinquennia, 2004-2008
(1) and 2009-2013 (2), are presented in Supplementary
Figures 1 through 3. The East Asian countries (China,
the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan) are publishing rela-
tively basic articles; this may be because their clinical
articles are published in local journals not covered by the
WoS. Within Europe, a few countries’ publications are
becoming more clinical (e.g., those of Denmark), but most
outputs are becoming more basic (e.g., those of Italy,
France, Spain, Greece, Switzerland, Sweden, and Austria).
International Collaboration
We estimated the extent of international collabora-
tion as a proportion of all published articles from each
individual country. We found that 17.2% (n ¼ 5518) of
all articles involved collaboration with investigators
from two or more countries. Research from Norway,
Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, and Sweden had the
highest proportion of international contributors (see
Supplementary Fig. 4 for more details). By comparison,
relative to their research output, the East Asian countries

Turkey had the least amount of international collabora-
tion. With regard to multinational studies, only 1.2% of

countries and 0.3% (n ¼ 89) from 10 or more countries.
Discussion
Our results provide a comprehensive overview of lung
cancer research in the 24 countries leading in research. Of
concern is that despite a doubling of the volume of lung
cancer research worldwide between 2004 and 2013, it
still only accounts for a small proportion of the overall
oncology research publication output (5.6%). In fact, the
RC to lung cancer research compared with that to total
oncology research output has fallen in most countries
during this period, including in the United States, Italy,
France, Spain, Taiwan, and the Republic of Korea (see
Fig. 2). China is a notable exception. The surge in articles
on lung cancer research emanating from there since 2008
(see Fig. 1) has meant that overall, there has been a 1.2%
increase in the proportion of oncology research devoted
to lung cancer in this period.
When research outputs are analyzed according to
country-specific BoD, no correlation exists (see Fig. 3).
Turkey, Poland, Canada, Greece, and the United States,
despite having the highest country-specific burden of
lung cancer, have all seen a decrease in their RC to lung
cancer research between the two quinquennia (see
Fig. 2). When compared with all 24 countries, Turkey
and Greece publish relatively more research, which is in
line with their increased BoD, but China, the Republic of
Korea, and Taiwan appear to have relatively greater

 commitment to lung cancer research compared with
their lung cancer BoD (see Fig. 3).
Without further investigation, the reason for these
trends can only be hypothesized. One explanation may
be the extent to which certain cancers are covered by
the media21 and the subsequent impact this has on
philanthropic, governmental, and industry funding of
research. One study in the United States analyzing the
content presented by media outlets, including television
and print media, found that breast, colon, and brain
cancers were all overrepresented relative to their inci-
dence, whereas prostate and lung cancers were both
underrepresented.22 Similar findings have been seen in
other countries, with lung cancer frequently under-
represented.23,24 Coverage25 tends to be influenced by
“interested parties,” be they academic, charity, or com-
mercial, and often reflects the degree of celebrity
endorsement and corporate sponsorship.26 The conse-
quent effect this has on research funding needs further
evaluation and will be the subject of a separate article.
In the United Kingdom, despite the difference in
relative burden compared with lung cancer, breast can-
cer and colorectal cancer received approximately 20%
and 13% of Cancer Research UK’s research funding in
2013 compared with 6% for lung cancer.27 In the United
States, National Cancer Institute funding for lung cancer
research was $286 million in 2013, compared with $559
million and $238 million for breast and colorectal can-
cer, respectively.28 From a public policy perspective,
lung cancer research is competing with research into
other cancer types for recognition and research funding,
and not faring well.
The growth in cancer research in China is most likely
a response to the rapidly increasing health burden
associated with lung cancer. It is the most frequent cause
of cancer-related mortality, having overtaken liver can-
cer, and there has been a fivefold increase in mortality
rate over the past three decades.29 This is due in part to
the rapid demographic transition that China is under-
going, but also to growing tobacco consumption and air
pollution.30 As a result, the number of new lung cancer
cases is expected to increase by 120,000 per year by
2020.31
Just as important as the volume of research is the
distribution of research in the different types. Figure 4
highlights the inequity within lung cancer research,
especially given the current challenges in the manage-
ment of this disease. Late diagnosis32,33 remains a key
issue. Mechanisms for improving this include improved
selection of at-risk patients from primary care for

 investigation,34 the development of new innovative
diagnostic tools (especially for indeterminate lung le-
sions), and cost-effective population-based screening.35
Yet our analysis suggests that research on screening
and diagnostics is not a priority relative to other research
types. The United States, Japan, Netherlands, and Ger-
many are currently leading the way in this research
domain (see Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 5).
Given the late stage of presentation of lung cancer for
many patients and poor outcomes from current man-
agement, there is very limited research into palliative care
strategies (see Fig. 4). This is despite published evidence
of benefit from early palliative care input for individuals
presenting with advanced disease.36 Systemic therapies
are predominantly used in the management of stage IV
disease, and although they aim to achieve prolongation of
survival, both effective palliation of symptoms and
improvement in QOL remain core goals. Research into
QOL and research into systemic therapies should there-
fore not be considered to be mutually exclusive, espe-
cially if we hope to achieve outcomes that are in line with
patient preferences.37 This is of equal importance for
radical treatment, where dose escalation of radio-
therapy38 and multimodality therapy39 are increasingly
being examined in trials, but potentially at the cost of
increased toxicities. The United Kingdom, Canada, and
Sweden have demonstrated the greatest commitment to
QOL and palliative care research (see Fig. 5).
The commitment to genetic, biomarker, and targeted
therapy research is increasingly important in the era of
personalized medicine, and our results show that
research outputs have increased in these domains, with
notable recent successes from targeted therapies.40,41
Advances in these research types continue to be well
publicized, as is evidenced by an analysis of cancer
research reporting on the United Kingdom’s British
Broadcasting Corporation website, which found that
cancer stories most frequently focused on new drug or
vaccine developments (20%) and genetics research
(9%).25
However, it is also important to ensure that research
into surgery and radiotherapy continues apace as they
will remain core modalities in the management of early
and locally advanced lung cancer. For instance, stereo-
tactic
body
radiotherapy
using
novel
radiotherapy
delivery techniques has increased the accuracy of
treatment delivery, thus enabling radical treatment of
men and women with early-stage lung cancer that was
previously considered incurable because of comorbid-
ities.42 Furthermore, effective collaboration between
practitioners of these research types is necessary to
development of new paradigms of care (e.g., multi-
modality therapy with targeted agents) that have the
potential to achieve significant gains in outcomes43,44
It is also important that this work be translated into
clinically relevant outcomes for patients. We therefore
analyzed the extent to which published lung cancer
research was considered clinical (1.0) or basic (4.0)
(see Supplementary Figs. 1 through 3). The results
demonstrated that whereas East Asian countries such as
China and Japan have consistently undertaken basic
science research over the 10-year period, other coun-
tries, especially across Europe, were increasingly moving
away from more clinically oriented research between the
two quinquennia. What impact this will have in the long
term and the driving force behind this are unknown, but
a subsequent analysis will look into the main sources of
funding for lung cancer research, be they public, indus-
trial, or charitable, and the potential effect that this has
had.45 One potential factor is the rising costs associated
with developing and supporting clinical trials, which
have been exacerbated by difficulties in coordinating
multiple institutions and recruiting patients.46,47
It is not just the type of research undertaken by each
country that is relevant but the impact that this is likely
to have on changing practice or encouraging further
research work. As part of the analysis, we reviewed the
ACI of published research from each country. When
ranked (see Table 1), output from North America and
Europe, in particular, the United States, Canada and the
Netherlands, has the greatest influence. Conversely,
countries such as China and Japan, which produce a high
volume of lung cancer research, rank 15th and 19th in
terms of their ACI. This may reduce the integration of
research into clinical practice worldwide and potentially
result in duplication of research work or greater inequity
in clinical outcomes.
Although the number of major international clinical
trials is increasing in general, our results demonstrate
that they are not the major contributor to the lung
cancer research oeuvre. For example, only 1.2% of arti-
cles had collaborators from five or more countries. In
terms of individual countries, the level of international
collaboration for China and Japan is low relative to their
research output (Supplementary Fig. 4). Greater efforts
are therefore needed to promote international collabo-
ration with both these countries to assist in knowledge
transfer.
There are several limitations of the present study.
First, we have not provided a detailed analysis of the
factors that have led to the observed trends and can only
hypothesize potential reasons at this stage. Second, we
have selected publications available in the WoS for
analysis, and it is therefore likely that some research
output in national language journals has not been
included in this evaluation, which will affect our results
for country-level outputs. Third, the quantity of research
outputs may be affected by publication bias, with failure
1048
Aggarwal et al

Vol. 11 No. 7
 of up to 20% to 30% of trials to report their results.48
This will have an impact on country-level integer and
fractional counts, as well as on potential underrepre-
sentation of clinical research outputs. Although our
coding scheme for research types was made as explicit
as possible, it is possible that some publications were
miscategorized. Furthermore, we have not included
every country publishing lung cancer research. However,
it is envisaged that by reviewing the 24 leading research-
active countries, we have provided public policy intelli-
gence with respect to the major global patterns of lung
cancer research and regional trends.
Conclusions
To conclude, our findings have established that
despite the huge health, social, and economic burden
associated with lung cancer, the level of international
research output lags significantly behind that for other
malignancies. Of even greater concern is the fact that the
RC to lung cancer research is falling in most of the 24
leading research-active countries, which is likely to have
an effect on the clinical outcomes that research is able to
deliver. This comes at a time when real opportunities
exist to better understand the disease: the drop in
smoking
rates
in
high-resource
countries
and
the
concomitant decline in the attributable fraction of DALYs
from smoking provide an opportunity to better investi-
gate other risk factors. In addition, the rapid rise in lung
cancer in lower-resource countries, where smoking is
just beginning to have an impact on health, should allow
the coming lung cancer epidemic to be studied with
modern technologies.
Greater efforts are required to prioritize lung cancer
research as a whole, and in particular, research into key
areas such as diagnosis and screening, which remain
challenging for a disease that is associated with late
diagnosis. We are also observing a gradual move away
from clinical research toward basic science. It is impor-
tant that translational research be encouraged so as to
ensure that high-quality basic research leads to innova-
tive developments and improves outcomes for a disease
whose patients continue to have poor chances of survival.
