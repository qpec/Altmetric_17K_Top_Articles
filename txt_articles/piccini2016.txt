IMPORTANCE Despite the frequency of atrial fibrillation (AF) in clinical practice, relatively little
is known about sex differences in symptoms and quality of life and how they may affect
treatment and outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether symptoms, quality of life, treatment, and outcomes differ
between women and men with AF.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This observational cohort study included 10 135 patients
with AF. The Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation is a
prospective, nationwide, multicenter outpatient registry of patients with incident and
prevalent AF enrolled at 176 sites between June 2010 and August 2011.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Symptoms, quality of life as measured by Atrial Fibrillation
Effects on Quality of Life scores, AF treatment, cardiovascular outcomes, stroke or
non–central nervous system embolism, and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS Overall, 4293 of the cohort (42%) were female. Compared with men, women were
older (77 years; interquartile range [IQR], 69-83, vs 73 years; IQR, 65-80; P < .001) and had
higher median CHA2DS2-VASc scores (5; IQR, 4-6, vs 3; IQR, 2-5; P < .001), but less sleep
apnea (578 [13.5%] vs 1264 [21.6%]; P < .001). Only 32.1% of women (n = 1378) were
asymptomatic (European Heart Rhythm Association class I) compared with 42.5% of men
(n = 2483) in unadjusted analyses (P < .001). Women had lower (more severe) unadjusted
baseline overall Atrial Fibrillation Effects on Quality of Life scores (n = 2007; 80; IQR, 62-92
vs 83; IQR, 69-94; P < .001). Women had similar rates of anticoagulation and similar time in
therapeutic range. In follow-up, women experienced lower risk-adjusted all-cause mortality
(adjusted hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.49-0.67) and cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard
ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44-0.72); however, they had a higher risk for stroke or non–central
nervous system embolism (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05-1.84; P = .02) compared
with men.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Women with AF have more symptoms and worse quality of
life. Despite higher risk, women have lower risk-adjusted all-cause and cardiovascular death
compared with men, but higher stroke rates. Future studies should focus on how treatment
and interventions specifically affect AF-related quality of life and cardiovascular outcomes in
women.

A
trial fibrillation (AF) is a growing and costly public
health problem for which most studies have focused
on thromboembolic outcomes, although the disease
is known to impair patients’health status: their symptoms,
function, and quality of life (QoL).1,2 While there are well-
documented sex-based differences in treatment, health
status, and other clinical outcomes in other cardiovascular dis-
eases, these have been infrequently described in AF.3-5 If pres-
ent, such sex-related differences could stimulate new efforts
to better manage AF, potentially including antiarrhythmic
therapy and radiofrequency ablation, to minimize health sta-
tus disparities.
The nationwide multicenter Outcomes Registry for Bet-
ter Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF) pro-
vides a unique opportunity to examine this gap in knowledge
because the registry prospectively collects information on AF
treatment and patients’health status. Accordingly, we exam-
ined whether symptoms, functional capacity, and QoL dif-
fered between women and men enrolled in ORBIT-AF. We
hypothesized that women with AF would have worse symp-
toms, lower QoL, and worse clinical outcomes relative to
men.
Methods
The ORBIT-AF study is a prospective, multicenter nationwide,
outpatient registry of patients with incident and prevalent AF.
Patients were enrolled at 176 sites between June 2010 and
August 2011 by a diverse group of health care professionals in-
cluding internists, cardiologists, and electrophysiologists. The
rationale, design, and methods of the ORBIT-AF registry have
beenreportedpreviously.6Thestudyandallitsanalysesareap-
proved under a continuous institutional review board at Duke
University(thecoordinatingcenter)andeachparticipatingcen-
ter obtained local institutional review board approval; all par-
ticipants provided informed consent. Eligible patients were re-
quired to have electrocardiographic AF and be 18 years of age
or older, able to provide consent, and adhere with local follow-
up. Patients with solitary atrial flutter without AF, a life expec-
tancy of less than 6 months, or AF secondary to an easily re-
versible condition were excluded. Patients were followed up at
6-monthintervals.Outcomesassessedinfollow-upincludedall-
causemortality,cardiovasculardeath,hospitalization,strokeor
non–central nervous system (CNS) systemic embolism, new-
onset heart failure, and bleeding.
Health-Related Quality-of-Life Substudy
The ORBIT-AF registry included a health-related QoL sub-
study, which was conducted at 99 of the 176 total study
sites. Patients in the substudy underwent assessment of
AF-related QoL using the validated Atrial Fibrillation Effects
on Quality of Life questionnaire (AFEQT; http://www.afeqt
.org) at baseline (n = 2007), 12 months (n = 1346), and 24
months (n = 988). The development and validation of the
AFEQT have been previously described.7 The AFEQT is a
20-item survey using 7-point Likert response scales that was
developed through serial iterations with patients, factor-
level analysis, and psychometric testing, which measures
AF-specific health status. It quantifies 4 domains of patients’
health status: symptoms, daily activities, treatment concern,
and treatment satisfaction, with the first 3 being used to gen-
erate an overall summary score. The AFEQT scores range from
0 to 100, with 100 representing the best possible health sta-
tus (no impairment) and 0 representing the worst.
Statistical Analysis
For the purpose of this analysis, the ORBIT-AF cohort popu-
lation was stratified and analyzed by sex overall (N = 10 135;
176 sites) and for the patient-reported outcomes cohort
(n = 2007; 99 sites). Patients were included regardless of AF
type or management strategy (rate or rhythm control). Base-
line characteristics were compared between women and men,
including demographics, general medical history, cardiovas-
cular history, AF history, prior procedures, prior and current
medicaltherapies,vitalsigns,echocardiographicdata(leftven-
tricular ejection fraction and left atrial diameter), and labora-
tory studies. An inventory of AF-related symptoms and data
regarding AF-functional limitation were also collected. Risk
scores for stroke (eg, cardiac failure or dysfunction, hyperten-
sion, age ≥75 years [doubled], diabetes, stroke [doubled]–
vascular disease, age 65-74 years, and sex category [female]
[CHA2DS2-VASc]) were calculated and compared. Data are re-
ported as frequencies and percentages for categorical vari-
ables and medians (interquartile ranges [IQRs]) for continu-
ous variables. The χ2 test for categorical variables and the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables were used for
univariate comparisons.
The AFEQT is bounded between 0 and 100 and is not nor-
mally distributed. Therefore, to determine the association be-
tween female sex and QoL at baseline, a multivariable bino-
mial regression model was used to model the proportion of
AFEQT points achieved out of 100.8,9 An empirical variance
was used to account for the fact that AFEQT is a proportion,
butnotasumofindependentBernoullitrials.Additionally,site
was included as a random effect to account for site variabil-
ity.Backwardselectionwitharetentioncriterionofα = .05with
the covariates listed in the eAppendix in the Supplement as
potential candidate variables was used to build the model. Ad-
ditionally, continuous covariates were evaluated for linearity
Key Points
Question Are symptoms, quality of life, and outcomes different in
women and men with atrial fibrillation (AF)?
Findings In this observational cohort study of 10 135 patients with
AF, only 32.1% of women were asymptomatic vs 42.5% of men.
Women had worse adjusted AF-related quality of life. While
women experienced lower risk-adjusted all-cause mortality, they
had a higher risk for thromboembolism compared with men.
Meaning Patient experience and subsequent outcomes are
different in women and men with AF. Women with AF experience
more symptoms, worse quality of life, and higher risk for stroke,
but better overall survival.

Toexaminetheassociationbetweenfemalesexandchange
inQoL,amultivariablehierarchicallinearregressionmodelwas
constructed for change in overall AFEQT score within 1 year
using backward selection with a stay criterion of α = .05 with
the covariates listed in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
Change in overall AFEQT score within 1 year was defined as
overall AFEQT score at 12 months minus overall AFEQT score
atbaseline.Therefore,apositivechangesignifiesimprovedQoL
and a negative change indicates reduced QoL. The overall es-
timate represents the difference in mean change score be-
tweenwomenandmen,holdingothercovariatesconstant.Ad-
justed associations were displayed as regression estimates
(95% CIs).
Subsequently, to determine whether female sex was in-
dependently associated with outcomes, Cox frailty models
(which account for clustered patients within a site by adding
a random effect for site) were used to examine the associa-
tion of female sex and time from enrollment with outcomes
in follow-up (all-cause death, cardiovascular death, noncar-
diovascular death, sudden cardiac death, revascularization,
myocardialinfarction,new-onsetheartfailurediagnosis,stroke
or non-CNS embolism, all-cause hospitalization, cardiovas-
cular hospitalization, bleeding-cause hospitalization, all-
other-cause hospitalization, major bleeding, catheter abla-
tion, atrioventricular node [AVN]/His bundle ablation)
among 9743 patients (392 patients were excluded owing to
no follow-up data). Missing data were less than 1.2% for car-
diovascular death, noncardiovascular death, and sudden
cardiac death. All other outcomes had complete data. Mod-
els were adjusted for all covariates listed in the eAppendix
in the Supplement that were previously identified as statis-
tically significant for each outcome based on backward
selection with a retention criterion of α = .05. Adjusted
associations for outcomes were displayed as hazard ratios
(HRs) (95% CIs).
All candidate variables had less than 2% missingness
except for level of education (4%), estimated glomerular fil-
tration rate (8%), hematocrit level (11%), left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction (11%), and left atrial diameter (14%). To account
for missing data, multiple imputation was used. Five im-
puted data sets were created with values imputed for all vari-
ables included in the modeling. Imputed values were ob-
tained by the Markov chain Monte Carlo method or regression
methods. The results from each model were then combined
to produce statistical valid inferences when imputed data sets
are used. All analyses were performed using SAS software (ver-
sion 9.3; SAS Institute).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
We evaluated 4293 women (42%) and 5842 (58%) men with
AF from 176 US practices. The baseline characteristics of the
cohort according to sex are shown in Table 1. Compared with
men, women with AF were older (77 years; IQR, 69- 83 years,
vs 73 years; IQR, 65-80 years; P < .001), but had lower fre-
quencies of obstructive sleep apnea (578 [13.5%] vs 1264
[21.6%]; P < .001) and coronary artery disease (1175 [27.4%] vs
2470 [42.3%]; P < .001). Women more often had a left ven-
tricular ejection fraction of 50% or greater (3300 [76.9%] vs
3813 [65.3%]; P < .001) but had worse renal function (median
estimated glomerular filtration rate, 63 mL/min/1.73 m2; IQR,
50-76 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs 70 mL/min/1.73 m2; IQR, 56-86
mL/min/1.73 m2; P < .001). Heart rates at baseline were simi-
lar between men and women. Finally, women had higher
median CHA2DS2-VASc scores (5; IQR, 4-6 vs 3; IQR, 2-5;
P < .001).
Symptoms and Functional Status
In the overall ORBIT-AF cohort, women had greater func-
tional impairment as reflected by higher European Heart
Rhythm Association scores (Table 1). Only 32.1% of women
(n = 1378) were asymptomatic compared with 42.5% of men
(n = 2483)(P < .001).AcrosstheAFsymptomchecklist,women
often reported more symptoms than men (Figure). Forty per-
cent of women (1727/4293) experienced palpitations com-
pared with 27% of men (1576/5842), and women more fre-
quentlyreportedlightheadedness/dizziness(23%,974/4293vs
19%, 1110/5842; P < .001) and fatigue (28%, 1216/4293 vs 25%,
1454/5842;P < .001).Whileorthostasisisoftenassociatedwith
antihypertensive medication use, dizziness/lightheadedness
was not more common in women with hypertension com-
pared with women without hypertension (29%, 212/730 vs
35%,48/136;P = .14).However,dizziness/lightheadednesswas
more common in women taking antiarrhythmic drugs than in
women not taking antiarrhythmic drugs (35%, 85/242 vs 28%,
175/624; P = .04).
Quality of Life
In the health-related QoL substudy (n = 2007; eTable 1 in
the Supplement), women had lower overall AFEQT scores
compared with men: 80; IQR, 62-92 vs 83; IQR, 69-94;
P < .001 (Table 2). Overall, patients with recent AF diagnosis
(diagnosed as having AF ≤3 months) had worse QoL (77;
IQR, 57-91 vs 82; IQR, 68-94; P < .001). As shown in Table 2,
women had consistently lower AFEQT domain scores
including symptoms, daily activities, and treatment con-
cern. These sex differences persisted when restricting the
analysis to those aged 75 years or older (Table 2). The
AFEQT scores were also lower in women compared with
men in those with paroxysmal and persistent AF and were
lower in women with CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 2 and greater
(eTable 2 in the Supplement).
After adjustment for baseline characteristics, female sex
was associated with lower QoL (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60-0.75;
P < .001). After controlling for baseline characteristics and
all AF-related symptoms in the regression for AFEQT, female
sex remained associated with lower QoL (OR, 0.76; 95% CI,
0.68-0.84; P < .001). As shown in Table 3, when follow-up
QoL at 1 year was investigated among 1346 patients, women
continued to have lower QoL with no significant improve-
ment in follow-up vs men (adjusted change in AFEQT, −0.55;

Type of AF, Prior Treatment, and Current Therapy
More than half the cohort had paroxysmal AF (51%), while only
5% had first-detected AF. The distribution of AF type was simi-
lar between women and men, although women were less fre-
quently in permanent AF (1109 [25.8%] vs 1721 [29.5%]%;
P < .001; Table 1). Compared with men, women were more
commonly in sinus rhythm at enrollment (1573 [36.6%] vs 1819
[31.1%]; P < .001). Rates of prior treatment with antiarrhyth-
mic drugs (P = .88) were similar between women and men;
however, women were less likely to have a history of cardio-
version (1144 [26.7%] vs 1895 [32.4%]; P < .001) or AF abla-
tion (210 [4.9%] vs 342 [5.9%]; P = .04). Women more

be taking digoxin (1057 [24.6%] vs 131 [22.6%]; P = .02).
Currentantiarrhythmictherapywassimilarinmenandwomen
(1244 [28.9%] vs 1669 [28.6%]; P = .65). Warfarin therapy was
also similar between men and women with a CHADS2 (con-
gestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes
mellitus, and stroke [doubled]) score greater than 1 (2621
[79.6%] vs 3209 [80.5%]; P = .36), although concomitant as-
pirin (oral anticoagulation and aspirin) was used less fre-
quently in women (921 [21.5%] vs 1803 [30.9%]; P < .001). The
median time in therapeutic range was relatively similar
between women and men (67%; IQR, 50-78 vs 68%; IQR, 53-
81; P < .001) as was the median time with supratherapeutic in-
ternational normalized ratio greater than 3 (Table 1). In follow-
up, there were no differences in adjusted rates of catheter
ablation between men and women. Although rates of AVN ab-
lation were very low overall, after adjustment, female sex was
associated with a higher risk for AVN ablation (HR, 1.97; 95%
CI, 1.30-2.97; P = .001).
Clinical Outcomes
Overall,themedianfollow-upwas2.3years(IQR,1.8-2.9years).
Outcomes in full follow-up in women compared with men are
shown in Table 4. The observed rates for mortality, cardio-
vascular death, and noncardiovascular death were similar
between women and men. After accounting for baseline risk,
women had a lower adjusted risk for most adverse outcomes,
including all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.49-
0.67; P < .001), cardiovascular death (adjusted HR, 0.56; 95%
CI, 0.44-0.72; P < .001), and noncardiovascular death (ad-
justed HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.88; P < .001). However, the in-
cidence of new-onset heart failure, myocardial infarction, re-
vascularization, major bleeding, all-cause hospitalization, and
sudden cardiac death were similar between women and men,
even after risk adjustment. Women had a higher risk for stroke
or non-CNS embolism in both unadjusted and adjusted data,

Discussion
In this nationwide analysis of sex differences in patients with
AF, there were 4 main findings. First, women have more symp-
toms,morefunctionalimpairment,andworseQoLdespiteless
persistent forms of AF. Second, after adjustment, women were
more likely to undergo AVN ablation. Third, women experi-
enced a higher risk for stroke or systemic embolism. Finally,
in terms of overall outcomes, despite worse QoL and a higher
risk for stroke, women had higher risk-adjusted survival and
lower risk-adjusted cardiovascular death.
Prior investigations in large registries, including the Reg-
istry on Cardiac Rhythm Disorders Assessing the Control of
Atrial Fibrillation (RECORD AF)10 and Eurobservational Re-
search Programme–Atrial Fibrillation General Registry Pilot
Phase,11 have described the burden of symptoms in AF; how-
ever, to our knowledge, few analyses have focused on sex dif-
ferences in symptoms and health-related QoL. An analysis of
sexdifferencesinrhythm-controltherapyinpersistentAFfrom
the Rate Control vs Electrical Cardioversion Study found that
women reported more palpitations, dyspnea, and fatigue and
had worse QoL but comparable cardiovascular outcomes.12
While this study focused on sex differences, it was limited by
a small sample size (n = 192), exclusion of paroxysmal and per-
manent AF, and the selection bias associated with a random-
ized interventional trial. Data from the larger Euro Heart Sur-
vey on Atrial Fibrillation found that women with AF had lower
general QoL as measured by EuroQol scores (EuroQol 5 Di-
mensions questionnaire and EuroQol visual analogue scale);
however, several reported symptoms were similar between
men and women (dyspnea and fatigue) and there was no
AF-specific QoL measurement.13
In our large, nationwide, observational cohort, women re-
ported more frequent symptoms, including palpitations, fa-
tigue, lightheadedness, and chest discomfort. These differ-
ences in symptoms were significant and occurred despite the
fact that women were more frequently in sinus rhythm at the
time of evaluation relative to men. Following adjustment for
importantpatientcharacteristics(includingdemographics,co-
morbidities, prior treatment, imaging results, and laboratory
evaluations), adjusted QoL was 24% lower in women. Further-
more, analysis of the component domains of the AFEQT dem-
onstrated that women had worse symptoms, more limitation
indailyactivities,andmoreconcernovertheirtreatment.Thus,
thelowerQoLinwomenwithAFmaybeaconsequenceofboth

toms have been reported to have different patterns in parox-
ysmal vs persistent AF in the Atrial Fibrillation: Focus on Ef-
fective Clinical Treatment Strategies Registry,14 this cannot
accountforthedifferencesreportedinourcurrentORBITstudy
because there was no major significant difference in paroxys-
mal or persistent AF frequencies by sex in ORBIT-AF.
GiventheoverallprevalenceofAF,theevaluationandman-
agement of women with AF is commonly encountered in both
primary care and specialty cardiovascular care. Clinical deci-
sion making is often aided by risk stratification. Many pa-
tients in this registry reported symptoms and reduced QoL.
Health status instruments, such as AFEQT, may be a valuable
resource for identifying patients who might benefit from more
aggressive or more specific treatment. More importantly, our
data suggest that women are at increased risk for more severe
symptom burden and lower QoL compared with men, under-
scoring the benefits of directly measuring patient-reported
health status as a means for minimizing differences in AF man-
agement. Clinicians evaluating women with AF should be
aware of these differences and ensure that symptom burden
and QoL are carefully evaluated before selecting a treatment
strategy.
Despite worse QoL, women were no more likely to re-
ceive rhythm control. Recent data have suggested that women
are less likely to undergo catheter ablation of AF; however, af-
ter risk adjustment, we observed similar rates of AF ablation
betweenwomenandmen.15However,womenweremorelikely
to undergo AVN ablation. Although rates of AVN ablation were
very low overall, after adjustment, female sex was associated
with a 2-fold higher risk for AVN ablation. Atrioventricular
nodal ablation is largely considered a treatment of last resort
for medically refractory and symptomatic AF. The higher rate
of AVN ablation in women is surprising as permanent AF was
less common in women (26% vs 30%). Women were older and
more likely to have frailty, and this may have contributed to
the higher use of AVN ablation in women. The reasons for dif-
ferences in AVN ablation require further investigation.
Similar to international data from the Prospective Global
Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD,16 we found that oral an-
ticoagulation was similar in women and men in the United
States. Female sex is an established, yet controversial, risk fac-
tor for stroke in patients with nonvalvular AF.17-19 As ex-
pected, women in our study had higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores
given the nature of the CHA2DS2-VASc score and the older age
of the women relative to men. Our data extend and confirm
the results from other studies that demonstrate increased risk
for stroke in women. After adjustment, the risk for stroke or
systemic embolism was approximately 40% higher in women
compared with only 20% in the Swedish Atrial Fibrillation Co-
hort Study.20 Thus, our nationwide data support the associa-
tion between female sex and stroke. Interestingly, while the
adjusted risk for stroke was 40% higher in women, women ex-
perienced lower adjusted overall and cardiovascular-related
deathratesthanmen.Thereasonsforthisstroke-survivalpara-
dox are not clear; however, the paradox highlights the need
for studies focused on how treatment and interventions spe-
cifically affect cardiovascular outcomes in women and men
with AF. The differences in therapies and response may shed
light on important factors associated with disease progres-
sion and modification of risk. For example, it is possible that
rate and rhythm-control therapies affect disease progression
and subsequent QoL differently in men and women. Such dif-
ferences may help plan studies to guide individualized therapy
selectionthatincorporatessexinadditiontootherpatientchar-
acteristics.
There are limitations that need to be considered when
evaluating these data. First, the ORBIT-AF registry relied on
voluntary participation from sites and patients. Thus, the pa-
tients enrolled may not be entirely representative. The me-

dian age of the ORBIT-AF cohort is older than has been ob-
served in other registries, with a higher proportion of patients
with lone AF but younger than cohorts from Medicare. Thus,
the age and comorbidity profile are likely influenced by the
older patients with AF encountered in clinical practice.21-23 De-
spite our use of a large number of characteristics to adjust for
potential confounding, residual or unmeasured confounding
cannot be excluded. The major differences in unadjusted and
adjusted outcomes suggest that confounding may be influ-
encing the observed outcomes, which is not unexpected given
the baseline differences between the sexes. Recent data have
raised the hypothesis that depression is associated with
increased AF symptom burden.24 Whether sex differences in
AF symptoms and QoL are influenced by depression requires
further study. Finally, palpitations and other symptoms of
AF are not always caused by AF and are often experienced in
sinus rhythm,25,26 thus, the extent to which these symptoms
reflect true arrhythmia in women vs men is also unknown.
Nonetheless, the point estimate for the reduction of QoL
associated with sex and the differences in cardiovascular
outcomes were robust in adjusted analyses. In addition,
health status data were available in only a subset of patients.
Follow-up was for a median of 2.3 years and with longer-
term follow-up different findings may emerge. We did not
measure overall QoL, the QoL data used an AF-specific
instrument that has been validated.7 Finally, we cannot
exclude the possibility that lack of changes in AFEQT scores
could be because patients who were experiencing declines
did not return for follow-up.
Conclusions
Compared with men, women with AF have more symptoms,
more functional limitation, and worse QoL. This impairment
in QoL reflects increased symptoms, reduced capacity to en-
gage in daily activities, and more concern regarding treat-
ment. Despite a higher risk for stroke, women had improved
risk-adjusted all-cause survival and lower risk-adjusted car-
diovascular death compared with men. The reasons for this
stroke-survival paradox may have important implications for
AF-directed therapies in women and men.
