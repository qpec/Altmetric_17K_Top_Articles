Many cancer cells depend on glutamine as they use the glu-
taminolysis pathway to generate building blocks and energy for
anabolic purposes. As a result, glutamine transporters are essen-
tial for cancer growth and are potential targets for cancer chem-
otherapy with ASCT2 (SLC1A5) being investigated most inten-
sively. Here we show that HeLa epithelial cervical cancer cells
and 143B osteosarcoma cells express a set of glutamine trans-
porters including SNAT1 (SLC38A1), SNAT2 (SLC38A2),
SNAT4 (SLC38A4), LAT1 (SLC7A5), and ASCT2 (SLC1A5).
Net glutamine uptake did not depend on ASCT2 but required
expression of SNAT1 and SNAT2. Deletion of ASCT2 did not
reduce cell growth but caused an amino acid starvation response
and up-regulation of SNAT1 to replace ASCT2 functionally.
Silencing of GCN2 in the ASCT2(�/�) background reduced cell
growth, showing that a combined targeted approach would
inhibit growth of glutamine-dependent cancer cells.
Differentiated, non-dividing cells generate energy by metab-
olizing nutrients via the TCA2 cycle and respiratory chain,
resulting in the production of carbon dioxide and water (1).
Synthesis of macromolecules is limited to essential turnover of
proteins and polynucleotides. Rapidly dividing cells, by con-
trast, synthesize significant amounts of protein, DNA, RNA,
and membrane lipids de novo. Synthesis of these compounds
withdraws large amounts of metabolites from metabolic path-
ways. Cyclic pathways, such as the TCA cycle, are very sensitive
to withdrawal of metabolites because depletion of TCA cycle
intermediates will render the cycle non-functional and com-
promise the capacity to generate energy (2). Linear pathways,
by contrast, increase the flow-through to adapt to high meta-
bolic demand. Converting the TCA cycle into a linear pathway
is of considerable advantage to rapidly dividing cells, such as
cancer cells, activated lymphocytes, and stem cells. This linear-
ized version of the TCA cycle has been termed glutaminolysis,
allowing generation of energy and metabolic building blocks (2,
3). Glutamine, the starting substrate of this pathway, is
imported by the cell and deaminated to glutamate. Glutamate is
converted into 2-oxoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase or
by a transaminase reaction. After going through several steps of
the TCA cycle, malate or oxaloacetate is produced. Oxaloace-
tate can be converted into aspartate, which is a major precursor
for nucleotide biosynthesis. Both oxaloacetate and malate can
also be converted into pyruvate, which can be used to generate
alanine, lactate, or acetyl-CoA. As a result, many cancer cells
depend on glutamine unless they express glutamine synthetase
(4). It is worth noting that glutaminolysis through the conver-
sion of 2-oxoglutarate to oxaloacetate produces two NADH,
one FADH, and one GTP and therefore provides the cell with
significant energy. Activation of the glutaminolysis pathway in
cancer cells is accompanied by a reduced entry of pyruvate into
the TCA cycle (5).
The adaptation of metabolism to cellular growth is associ-
ated with transcription factors MYC and HIF, both of which are
up-regulated in many cancer cells (6, 7). In contrast to differen-
tiated cells, expression of glutamine transporters is essential for
fast growing cells. Overexpression of MYC is associated with
the induction of ASCT2 (SLC1A5) (8), a glutamine transporter
highly expressed in many cancer cells (9). As a result, ASCT2
is generally considered to mediate the entry of glutamine
to the glutaminolysis pathway (e.g. Refs. 10 and 11). In addi-
tion, ASCT2 is often expressed together with 4F2hc/LAT1
(SLC3A2/SLC7A5), a heteromeric antiporter that exchanges
large neutral amino acids. Both transporters have been impli-
cated in cancer growth and mTOR signaling in many studies
(e.g. Refs. 12 and 13). It has been proposed that ASCT2 takes up
glutamine, which then acts as an exchange substrate to accu-
mulate leucine via 4F2hc/LAT1 (10). This proposal is problem-
atic as ASCT2 is also an obligatory amino acid exchanger for
small neutral amino acids and does not mediate net uptake of
glutamine unless other amino acids are available for release
(14). Moreover, glutamine is not a good intracellular exchange
substrate for 4F2hc/LAT1 (15). Thus, expression of a net trans-
porter for neutral amino acids is likely to be important for cell
growth.
Net neutral amino acid transporters are found in the SLC38
family of sodium-neutral amino acid transporters (SNAT) (16).
The family is subdivided into two groups, namely system A
amino acid transporters and system N amino acid transporters.
System A amino acid transporters (SNAT1 (SLC38A1), SNAT2
(SLC38A2), and SNAT4 (SLC38A4)) are Na�-neutral amino

 acid cotransporters transporting a wide variety of small neu-
tral amino acids, whereas system N transporters (SNAT3
(SLC38A1), SNAT5 (SLC38A5), and SNAT8 (SLC38A8)) are
more substrate-specific, preferring glutamine, asparagine, and
histidine (16). Functionally, system N transporters are charac-
terized by their tolerance to Na� replacement by Li�, whereas
system A transporters are sensitive to inhibition by the amino
acid analogue N-methylaminoisobutyric acid (MeAIB). SNAT5
has been shown to be activated by MYC, but its contribution to
glutamine uptake in cancer cells has not been studied (17). Here
we demonstrate that system A (SNAT1 and SNAT2) activity is
essential to mediate net glutamine uptake and glutaminolysis in
cancer cell lines, whereas ASCT2 and LAT1 harmonize intra-
cellular amino acid pools. We thus propose a unified model of
amino acid homeostasis in cancer cells.
Experimental Procedures
Cell Lines and Cell Culture—Human cervical adenocarci-
noma epithelial cells (HeLa) and human thymidine kinase-neg-
ative osteosarcoma cells 143B (TK�) (a gift from Dr. David
Tscharke (Research School of Biology, The Australian National
University)) were cultured in DMEM/Ham’s F-12 (Sigma
D8437) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technol-
ogies) at 37 °
C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For
subculturing, cells were detached by trypsinization (0.25% tryp-
sin, EDTA; Gibco). Cell counting was performed using a Scep-
ter cell counter (Millipore) or a hemocytometer. All complete
media for maintaining cells were supplemented with 2 mM
L-glutamine (Gibco). Cell viability after trypsinization was gen-
erally �95% as evaluated by trypan blue exclusion.
Growth Assays—To eliminate effects of serum-derived trace
glutamine, dialyzed FBS was used (Sigma). For growth assays,
HeLa and 143B cells were seeded into 96-well culture plates at a
density of 4,000–5,000 cells/well and kept initially in DMEM/
Ham’s F-12, 10% dialyzed FBS without glutamine. After 4 h, the
medium was replaced with the desired test solutions, and cell
proliferation was measured using an IncuCyte system (Essen
BioScience). IncuCyte data are shown as cell confluence
(mean � S.E.) at set intervals.
Amino Acid Flux Assays—All uptake assays were performed
in a water bath at 37 °
C as described (15) with some modifica-
tions. Briefly, cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm Petri
dishes. For Na�-dependent transport, Hanks’ balanced salt
solution (136.6 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 2.7 mM Na2HPO4, 1.3
mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.44 mM KH2PO4, 0.41 mM MgSO4,
5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 5 mM glucose was
used. For Na�-independent transport, NaCl was substituted
with N-methyl-D-glucamine chloride or LiCl, and sodium
phosphate was substituted with potassium phosphate. L-[U-
14C]glutamine (1.85 MBq/ml, 9.26 GBq/mmol; PerkinElmer
Life Sciences) was used at �2,000 dpm/nmol with unlabeled
L-glutamine adjusted to 100 �M final concentration. Transport
rates were normalized to cell-derived protein content mea-
sured by Bradford reagent (Sigma). Uptake rates were ex-
pressed as mean � S.D., and differences were evaluated by anal-
ysis of variance.
Metabolomics—Labeling of metabolite pools derived from
[13C5]glutamine was carried out as described (18) with some
modifications. 143B cells were labeled in the presence of 4 mM
[13C5]glutamine for 1 or 24 h in otherwise glutamine-free
DMEM/Ham’s F-12 supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS.
After the labeling period, medium was aspirated, and 1 ml of
deionized water was added to the cells. After swirling briefly,
the water was removed, and cells were covered with liquid
nitrogen. Once the liquid nitrogen had evaporated, 600 �l of
ice-cold CH3OH:CHCl3 (9:1) (supplemented with 1 mM ribitol)
was added and incubated for 10 min. The cells were scraped
together, transferred into microcentrifuge tubes, and incubated
for an additional 5 min at 4 °
C. The extracts were centrifuged at
4 °
C for 5 min at 16,100 � g, and the supernatant was trans-
ferred into a fresh 1.5-ml tube. Samples were sent on dry ice to
Metabolomics Australia (Parkville, Victoria, Australia) for
analysis.
High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)—The
HPLC system consisted of a Dionex UltiMateTM 3000 UHPLC
in line with a fluorescence FLD-3400 detector. To measure
amino acid consumption over time, 143B cells were grown ini-
tially in 35- or 60-mm dishes and maintained in complete cul-
ture medium in the tissue culture incubator until grown to full
confluence. Before starting the experiment, the cells were
washed thrice in Hanks’ balanced salt solution, pH 7.4, contain-
ing 5 mM D-glucose and 0.024 mM NaHCO3. Cells were then
incubated for 5 h in the same buffer containing 0.2 mM gluta-
mine. Supernates were sampled at 0, 2, and 4 or 5 h; cleared by
centrifugation; and freeze-dried overnight. Dried samples were
resuspended in 100 �l of 50 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.0. Benzylserine
(3 �l 1 mM) was added as an internal standard, and 10 �l of
2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (10 mM in CH3OH) was
added for amino acid derivatization. Subsequently, samples
were incubated for 2 h at 37 °
C, and 10 �l was injected for
analysis. Samples were eluted off a Kinetex 1.7-�m C18 (2.1 �
100-mm) column at 35 °
C. The mobile phase consisted of 100
mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.0 (solvent A) and acetonitrile
(solvent B). The gradient was A/B � 90/10% at 0 min increasing
to 50/50% after 10 min and to 100% B after 12 min. Eluents were
detected at � � 335 nm. Standard curves were generated for
amino acids of interest by varying the injection volume and
integrating the corresponding peak areas.
Reverse
Transcription-PCR—A
NucleoSpin
RNAII kit
(Macherey-Nagel) was used to isolate total RNA from cells
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentra-
tion was quantified by a NanoDrop spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was reverse transcribed to
cDNA using a SuperScript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitro-
gen). The cDNA of interest was amplified using Taq polymer-
ase (Qiagen) using serial dilutions of the template to optimize
semiquantitative analysis. PCR primer sequences are available
on request.
RNA Silencing—Low passages (�20) of 143B cells were
grown in DMEM/Ham’s F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS and
2 mM glutamine (total concentration, 4 mM). On the day before
transfection, cells were split and seeded out in 35-mm cell cul-
ture dishes at 150,000–300,000 cells. Immediately before trans-
fection, the medium was renewed. For transfection (all volumes
per dish) 4 �l of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies)
was combined with 250 �l of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies),

 and separately 30 pmol of RNAi construct (Ambion Silencer
Select predesigned siRNAs as listed in Table 1) was combined
with 250 �l of Opti-MEM. Both solutions were combined after
5 min and incubated for a further 20–30 min at room temper-
ature before adding the transfection complexes dropwise to the
cells. All transfections were performed in triplicates. Trans-
fected cells were incubated at 37 °
C and 5% CO2 for 4–6 h after
which the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM/Ham’s
F-12, 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine. Transport or Western blotting
analyses were performed after 48 h unless stated otherwise.
Genomic Mutation of the ASCT2 (Slc1a5) Gene—A commer-
cial CRISPR/Cas9 system was used (Sigma). The construct
U6gRNA-pCMV-Cas9–2A-GFP contains a 22-bp guide RNA
(cctcgaagcagtcaacctcccg), resulting in cleavage/repair of the
Slc1a5 gene in exon 7. An endotoxin-free preparation (Mach-
erey and Nagel) of the plasmid was used for transfection of 143B
cells maintained in DMEM/Ham’s F-12, 10% FBS, 2 mM gluta-
mine. Cells were split and seeded out in a 60-mm dish to reach
40% confluence on the day before transfection. Immediately
before transfection, the cells were replenished with fresh
DMEM/Ham’s F-12, 10% FCS, 2 mM glutamine. Plasmid DNA
(4 �g) and 10 �l of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were sep-
arately incubated in 500 �l of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 5 min
at room temperature before combining them and incubating
for a further 20–30 min at room temperature to form com-
plexes. The complexes were then added dropwise to the cells
and placed in an incubator at 37 °
C in 5% CO2 followed by a
medium change after 4–6 h. After 48 h of expression, cells were
trypsinized (0.25% trypsin, EDTA (Invitrogen)) and collected
by centrifugation (500 � g) followed by three washes in Dulbec-
co’s phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mM glu-
cose and 1% dialyzed FBS (Sigma). Cells were then passed
through a cell strainer (70 �m; Corning), centrifuged, and sus-
pended in PBS supplemented with 5 mM glucose and 1% dia-
lyzed FBS. Single cell sorting was performed using an ARIA II
FACS machine (FACS Facility, The Australian National Uni-
versity) with GFP intensity set at two different levels. Single
cells were collected in 96-well plates containing DMEM/Ham’s
F-12, 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine and incubated for up to 3 weeks
at 37 °
C in 5%CO2. Established clones were trypsinized and
seeded into 25-cm2 cell culture flasks (Corning) for further
propagation. A compound heterozygote mutation of human
ASCT2 at the target site was identified by sequencing.
Membrane Protein Preparation and Surface Biotinylation—
Cells were grown on 100-mm dishes and washed thrice in 10 ml
of ice-cold PBS. Cells were collected and spun down for 5 min at
500 � g. The supernatant was replaced by 5 ml of hypoosmotic
buffer (15 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM HEPES,
pH 8.0), and the cells were resuspended by mixing. After incu-
bation on ice for 5 min, membranes were ruptured by 35 strokes
in a Potter homogenizer. Debris and nuclei were removed by
centrifugation at 2,000 � g for 10 min. Membranes were iso-
lated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 180,000 � g at
4 °
C for 60 min. Pellets were resuspended in 200 �l of 5 mM
glycine.
For surface biotinylation, cells were grown on 100-mm
dishes and washed thrice in 10 ml of modified PBS (supple-
mented with 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 8.0). Cells were
then covered with 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) in modified PBS, pH 8.0, and incu-
bated for 45 min at room temperature on a rotary shaker at low
speed. Biotinylation was terminated by washing thrice in mod-
ified PBS supplemented with 100 mM glycine, pH 8.0. Cells were
scraped together, transferred to a 1.5-ml reaction tube, and
lysed by addition of 1 ml of 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20
mM Tris�HCl, pH 7.5. The homogenate was incubated on ice for
1.5 h to complete lysis. Subsequently, the homogenate was cen-
trifuged at 13,500 � g in a table top centrifuge for 10 min, and
the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. After protein
determination, equal amounts of protein homogenate were
added to 150 �l of high capacity streptavidin-agarose beads.
The beads were incubated overnight at 4 °
C on a rotary shaker
before washing four times in lysis buffer. The streptavidin-aga-
rose slurry was mixed with protein sample buffer and sample
reducing reagent. After boiling for 5min, a 40-�l sample was
loaded onto polyacrylamide gels.
SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—For protein extraction,
cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay protein
extraction buffer (Sigma) supplemented with protease inhib-
itor mixture (EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). After
homogenization, samples were centrifuged at 16,000 � g for 10
min. Total soluble proteins from the supernates were measured
using the Bradford reagent using bovine serum albumin as a
standard.
To prepare protein samples for SDS-PAGE, 50–100 �g of
total protein was mixed with 5 �l of 4� lithium dodecyl sulfate
sample buffer (Invitrogen) and 2 �l of reducing agent (Invitro-
gen) and made up to 20 �l using Milli-Q water. Samples were
then incubated at 70 °
C for 10 min before loading onto the
gel. Electrophoresis was performed using 4–12% Bis-Tris
polyacrylamide NuPAGE� gels (Invitrogen) electrophoresed
in an XCell SureLock� Mini-Cell (Invitrogen) under reduc-
ing conditions according to standard manufacturer proce-
dures. The SeeBlue Plus 2 prestained protein ladder (Invit-
rogen) was used to estimate the apparent molecular weight of
fractionated proteins.
Following SDS-PAGE, fractionated proteins were trans-
ferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) using a
Mini Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad)
according to standard protocols. Blots were blocked for 2 h at
room temperature (or overnight at 4 °
C) in 50 ml of 10% (w/v)
skim milk in PBS with 0.15% Tween 20 (PBS-T). After washing
thrice in PBS-T for 10 min each, the blots were incubated with
the first antibody for 2 h or overnight in 5 ml of skim milk (2%,
w/v) in PBS-T at dilutions listed in Table 2. Excess primary

Blots were incubated with 5 ml of diluted secondary antibody
for 1 h. After washing thrice in PBS-T and a final rinse in PBS,
reactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence
using Luminata Crescendo or Forte Western HRP Substrate
(Millipore Merck). For reprobing, the same blots were incu-
bated for 45 min at 70 °
C in 50 ml of stripping buffer (62.5 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). Mem-
branes were then washed thrice with PBS-T and blocked for 3 h
using 10% (w/v) skim milk in PBS-T before reprobing with the
next antibody as described above.
Oocyte Expression Systems and Flux Experiments—Xenopus
laevis (Nasco) oocytes were isolated and maintained as de-
scribed previously (19). Selected oocytes were injected with 10
ng of human ASCT2, human SNAT1, human SNAT2, or
human SNAT5 cRNA and were used as described previously
(20).
Growth and Statistical Analysis—Growth curves were ana-
lyzed using the Gompertz equation for cell growth, y � a �
exp(�exp(k(x � xc))), or the logistic equation, y � a/(1 �
exp(�k(x � xc))). For all experiments, the number of technical
repeats is shown as n, and the number of biological/experimen-
tal repeats is shown as e. Unpaired t tests were performed to
compare means of the combined biological repeats.
Results
Glutamine is an essential amino acid for cells that carry out
the glutaminolysis pathway (3). In agreement with this meta-
bolic phenotype, we found that growth of HeLa cells and 143B
cells highly depended on glutamine. Both cell lines completely
ceased growth in the absence of glutamine (data not shown). At
the same time, both cell lines produced alanine, aspartate, and
glutamate in a glutamine-dependent manner. For instance,
143B cells produced 4 � 0.2 �M aspartate, 23 � 5 �M glutamate,
and 80 � 10 �M alanine from 200 �M glutamine over 5 h. More-
over, metabolic labeling with [13C5]glutamine resulted in
strong 13C enrichment of cellular glutamate, succinate, fumar-
ate, malate, and aspartate pools (results presented further
below). These results confirmed the use of the glutaminolysis
pathway. Accordingly, MYC was detected in the nuclei of both
cell lines (data not shown).
Having established functional glutaminolysis in both cell
lines, we wondered how import of glutamine is mediated in
these cells. Analysis of amino acid transporter expression by
RT-PCR revealed the presence of a variety of glutamine trans-
porters, namely ASCT2, LAT1, LAT2, SNAT1, and SNAT2.
SNAT5 was detected in HeLa but not in 143B cells (Fig. 1, A and
B). A separate analysis of SNAT isoforms in 143B cells showed
high expression levels of SNAT1 and SNAT2 (Fig. 1C). SNAT4,
SNAT7, and SNAT9 were weakly expressed and may serve
roles in addition to glutamine transport. For instance, SNAT9 is
a lysosomal arginine transporter involved in mTOR signaling
(21, 22).
To correlate the expression data with functional data, we
analyzed glutamine uptake into HeLa and 143B cells using
competition experiments. The competing amino acids and ana-
logues were chosen to identify system A activity (MeAIB),
ASCT2 activity (Thr, which is not an inhibitor of system A), and
system L (Leu) in an additive manner as published previously
(23). Despite the dominant mRNA expression of system A iso-
forms SNAT1 and SNAT2, the system A inhibitor MeAIB
decreased glutamine uptake only by a small fraction (Fig. 1, D
and E). Glutamine uptake was predominantly Na�-dependent,
particularly in 143B cells. With the exception of system N
(molecular isoforms SNAT3 and SNAT5), Na�-dependent
transporters cannot use Li� instead of Na�; thus, lithium tol-
erance is a good indicator of the presence of SNAT3 and
SNAT5. However, replacement of NaCl by LiCl reduced gluta-
mine uptake only slightly less than replacement by N-methyl-
D-glucamine, suggesting that Li�-tolerant transporters have a
limited role in glutamine uptake. As a result, glutamine trans-
port appeared to have two broad components: a small Na�-
independent and a large Na�-dependent (Li�-sensitive) com-
ponent. Glutamine uptake was almost completely inhibited by
10 mM threonine, a typical ASCT2 substrate. Combining 10 mM
threonine and 10 mM leucine (a typical substrate of Na�-inde-
pendent system L transporters LAT1 and LAT2) reduced
uptake to background levels. This profile is consistent with a
contribution to glutamine transport by the Na�-independent
transport system L (isoforms LAT1 and LAT2) and by the Na�-
dependent transport system ASC (isoform ASCT2). Although
LAT1 activity has been described in many cancer cells (24), its

 contribution to glutamine uptake is small because this amino
acid is not a good substrate for this transporter (15). The anal-
ysis of glutamine transport can be explained by the action of
three transport systems, namely system ASC (ASCT2) and
smaller contributions by system L (LAT1 and LAT2) and sys-
tem A (SNAT1 and SNAT2). The bulk of glutamine transport is
thus mediated by obligatory antiporters, similar to transport
activities described before in cancer cells (25).
To confirm that ASCT2 is indeed the dominant transport
activity in both cell lines, we attempted to use known pharma-
cological ASCT2 inhibitors, such as benzylserine and L-�-glu-
tamyl-p-nitroanilide (26, 27), and the SNAT5 inhibitor
L-�-glutamylhydroxamate (28). Despite the absence of SNAT5
expression in 143B cells, L-�-glutamylhydroxamate was effec-
tive in suppressing growth of both cell lines at concentrations
�1 mM; �-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide (Fig. 1F) and benzylserine
(not shown) were less effective. This prompted us to investigate
the specificity of these inhibitors using X. laevis oocytes
expressing human cRNAs of ASCT2, SNAT1, -2, -4, and -5 (Fig.
1G). Surprisingly, addition of 3 mM benzylserine failed to
inhibit uptake of glutamine in oocytes expressing human
ASCT2. By contrast, L-�-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide inhibited
glutamine uptake via ASCT2 but also inhibited SNAT1, -2, -4,
and -5. The compound L-�-glutamylhydroxamate inhibited
ASCT2, SNAT1, -4, and -5. Overall, the data suggest that these
published glutamine transporter inhibitors are either ineffec-
tive or nonspecific. As a result, we decided to suppress expres-
sion of ASCT2, SNAT1, SNAT2, and SNAT4 by RNAi (Fig. 2).

 abundance of phospho-eIF2� 26-fold (p � 0.001), consistent
with eliciting an amino acid starvation response (Fig. 2C).
When cultured in the presence of 4 mM glutamine, treatment of
143B cells with SNAT1, SNAT2, and SNAT4 siRNA slightly
reduced transport activity without reaching significance (Fig.
2D, black bars). Silencing of SNAT1 and SNAT4 mRNA was
almost complete, whereas silencing of SNAT2 mRNA was
incomplete (about 50%; data not shown). However, the SNAT2
protein was barely detectable in the plasma membrane of cells
maintained in complete medium (Fig. 2E). This is consistent
with the well known induction of SNAT2 mRNA (Fig. 2F) and
protein under amino acid depletion conditions (29) (Fig. 2E),
restricting its expression in replete medium. SNAT1 showed a
smaller response under amino acid depletion, whereas ASCT2
expression remained constant (Fig. 2E). Consistent with an
amino acid-dependent regulation, the contribution of SNAT1
and SNAT2 to glutamine transport became more obvious and
significant when cells were cultured in medium supplemented
with 2 mM glutamine instead of 4 mM glutamine (Fig. 2D, gray
bars). Accordingly, surface expression of SNAT1 and -2
increased when glutamine supplementation was reduced (Fig.
2G). Overall, these experiments confirmed that Na�-depen-
dent uptake of glutamine (at a concentration of 100 �M) is dom-
inated by ASCT2 with smaller contributions by SNAT1 and
SNAT2, depending on glutamine levels.
Because silencing did not completely abolish ASCT2 protein
expression in the plasma membrane, we generated an
ASCT2(�/�) line through CRISPR/Cas9 methodology (Fig.
3A). Glutamine uptake was reduced by more than 60% consis-
tent with the silencing experiments (Fig. 3B). The remaining
glutamine uptake was sensitive to inhibition by MeAIB and was
abolished by a combination of MeAIB and threonine. The
amount of MeAIB-sensitive glutamine uptake increased signif-
icantly from 5.5 � 0.5 nmol/(6 min � mg of protein) in the
parental 143B cells to 12 � 1 nmol/(6 min � mg of protein) in
the ASCT2(�/�) cells (p � 0.002). Silencing experiments (Fig.
3C) showed that this increase was mainly mediated by SNAT1,
the transport activity of which was barely detectable in the
parental cell line in complete medium containing 4 mM gluta-
mine. A similar contribution of SNAT1 was observed in
medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine (Fig. 3C, gray
bars). In agreement with a higher contribution of SNAT1, a
slight increase of its protein was observed in ASCT2(�/�) cells
(Fig. 3A).
Despite the strongly reduced glutamine uptake, we found
that the growth rate of ASCT2(�/�) cells was essentially unal-
tered compared with the parental cells in the presence of 1 or 3
mM glutamine (Fig. 3D). Consistently, net glutamine consump-
tion was almost the same in the parental cells and ASCT2(�/�)
cells (Fig. 3E). This suggests that ASCT2 has an important role
in avoiding an unloaded tRNA response but is not involved in
net glutamine uptake to sustain glutaminolysis. This notion was
confirmed by metabolic labeling with [13C5]glutamine. In both
143B parental cells and ASCT2(�/�) cells, metabolites of the
glutaminolysis pathway were highly enriched (Fig. 3F). A sec-
ond pathway that was labeled equally strongly in both cell lines
was proline biosynthesis. This pathway has recently been rec-
ognized as a critical pathway for cancer cells and embryonic
stem cells (30, 31) (Fig. 3F).
In agreement with a significant role of SNAT1 in net gluta-
mine uptake, silencing of SNAT1 significantly decreased net
glutamine consumption in 143B cells, whereas silencing of
ASCT2 had little effect. No synergism was observed when
ASCT2 and SNAT1 were silenced together (Fig. 3G). Consis-
tent with the silencing experiments, ASCT2(�/�) cells showed
unaltered mTOR signaling (Fig. 4A) as evidenced by phosphor-
ylation of p70S6 kinase, ribosomal protein S6, and 4E-BP-1 (all
p � 0.05). Moreover, they showed a 20-fold increase (p � 0.002)
in eIF2� phosphorylation, indicating an unloaded tRNA
response (Fig. 4A). Reduced expression of ASCT2 in heterozy-
gous cell clones was consistently accompanied by an increased
signal of P-eIF2� (p � 0.04). The unloaded tRNA response is
known to increase SNAT2 expression (32), thereby compensat-
ing for the loss of ASCT2. We reasoned that blocking the
unloaded tRNA response through silencing of GCN2 should
block cell growth in the background of ASCT2(�/�) cells. In
agreement with this notion, the growth rate of GCN2-silenced
cells was reduced from k � 0.035 to k � 0.0018 (Fig. 4B). Paren-
tal 143B cells, by contrast, showed no difference in the growth
curve when GCN2 mRNA was silenced (Fig. 4C) despite signif-
icant reduction of its mRNA (Fig. 4D). Silencing of SNAT1
alone reduced cell growth only slightly (Fig. 4E). This suggested
a compensatory up-regulation of SNAT2, which we observed at
the protein level (Fig. 4F). As mentioned above, silencing of
SNAT2 mRNA was always incomplete (about 50%). To block
SNAT1 and SNAT2 activity completely, we combined silencing
of SNAT1 with the system A inhibitor MeAIB, which caused
selective withdrawal of SNAT2, but not SNAT1, from the
FIGURE 3. Genomic mutation of ASCT2 in 143B cells. A, CRISPR/Cas9 methodology was used to mutate ASCT2, resulting in complete ablation of ASCT2
protein expression. An increase of a higher molecular weight band was observed upon immunodetection of SNAT1 in ASCT2(�/�) cells, most likely
representing glycosylated SNAT1. Actin was used as a loading control. B, characterization of 100 �M [14C]glutamine uptake in ASCT2(�/�) cells using
amino acids and analogues using the same principles as in Fig. 1D. Glutamine uptake was reduced by 68% when compared with parental cells (column
1 versus column 3). The fraction of glutamine uptake that was inhibited by MeAIB increased in ASCT2(�/�) cells (n � 3, e � 3), indicating an increased
contribution by SNAT1/2. Glutamine transport was completely inhibited by the combination of MeAIB and Thr. 2-Aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-
carboxylic acid (BCH), a typical inhibitor of LAT1 and LAT2, did not affect glutamine uptake. C, silencing of SNAT1, SNAT2, and SNAT4 in ASCT2(�/�) cells

 plasma membrane after its expression was induced by amino
acid depletion (Fig. 4G) (33). The combination of both reagents
drastically reduced the growth rate of 143B cells from k � 0.05
to k � 0.003 (Fig. 4E).
Together, these results demonstrate a crucial role of SNAT1
in supplying glutamine for glutaminolysis with SNAT2 act-
ing as a “backup” under conditions of amino acid depletion.
Analysis of 947 cell lines (34) using Oncomine demonstrated
a consistently strong expression of SNAT1, SNAT2, and
ASCT2 in almost all of the analyzed cell lines (data not shown).
Other glutamine transporters, such as SNAT3, SNAT4, and
SNAT5, by contrast, were inconsistently expressed (data not
shown). This supports a general role for SNAT1 in sustaining
glutaminolysis.

 to the demands of a growing cell (2, 3). Conversion of the
canonical TCA cycle into the linear glutaminolysis pathway
creates the demand for glutamine transporters as an essential
element for glutamine-dependent cancer cells. It was recog-
nized 10 years ago that many cancer cells up-regulate ASCT2
and LAT1 (13). As shown in this and other studies, ASCT2 and
LAT1 are dominantly active transporters in many cancer cell
lines (25, 35–37). Accordingly, both transporters are currently
targeted to reduce cancer growth (38–40). Unfortunately,
many studies assume the ability of ASCT2 to mediate net glu-
tamine uptake (for example, see Fig. 7 in Ref. 10 or Fig. 1 in Ref.
11); moreover, inhibitors, such as benzylserine and �-glutamyl-
p-nitroanilide, that are often used to test involvement of
ASCT2, are nonspecific or ineffective. We demonstrate here
that ASCT2 is important for amino acid homeostasis but that
SNAT1 and SNAT2 mediate net glutamine uptake for the glu-
taminolysis pathway. Whether SNAT1 and SNAT2 have addi-
tional effects as transceptors remains to be shown (41).
We propose a novel view of amino acid homeostasis in cancer
cells that requires three different types of transporters (Fig. 5).
Type 1 transporters are amino acid harmonizers. These are rapid
exchangers for a group of amino acids, such as large amino acids
(LAT1andLAT2)andsmallaminoacids(ASCT1andASCT2).To
maintain a harmonized mixture of all 20 proteinogenic amino
acids, these transporters should be faster than net uptake. Type 2
transporters are amino acid loaders that mediate net uptake of a
group of amino acids including glutamine. Loaders must have at
least one overlapping amino acid substrate with the harmonizers.
Glutamineandalanineareidealsubstratesastheyarehighlyabun-
dant in blood plasma and are major substrates for SNAT1. Type 3
transporters are rescue transporters. As shown here, SNAT2
mRNA is highly abundant, but under homeostatic amino acid lev-
els, it is not translated into protein. Non-harmonized amino acid
mixtures will result in uncharged tRNAs, activating GCN2 (42),
which in turn will cause translation of the abundant SNAT2
mRNA by a cap-independent mechanism (32). Independently, it
appears that SNAT2 protein is degraded after ubiquitination (43),
and this may occur under nutrient-replete conditions but is halted
when amino acids are depleted.
ASCT2 silencing has been shown to induce rapid apoptosis
in hepatoma cells (44) and to reduce growth of melanoma and
pancreatic cancer cells (39, 40). As shown here, an ASCT2-
deficient cancer cell line can display normal growth due to up-
regulation of SNAT1 and SNAT2, which have overlapping sub-
strate specificity with ASCT2. One of the differences may be
that cells that are sensitive to ASCT2 inhibition show reduced
mTOR signaling when ASCT2 is silenced (12). This has been
proposed to involve the amino acid exchanger LAT1, exchang-
ing intracellular glutamine imported by ASCT2 against
branched-chain amino acids, which in turn would activate
mTOR (10). One of the problems with this proposal is that
ASCT2 also requires an exchange substrate. In addition, LAT1
has limited capacity to use intracellular glutamine as an
exchange substrate (15). Activation of mTOR is mediated by
cytosolic and lysosomal leucine levels and lysosomal amino acid
transporters (21, 22). SNAT1 and SNAT2 proficiently provide
exchange substrates to LAT1, thereby explaining the normal
mTOR signaling in ASCT2(�/�) cells.
Targeting SNAT1 could have potential for the treatment of
clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC). Analysis of four differ-
ent sporadic CCRCC sets (45–48) using Oncomine reveals
3–5-fold higher expression of SNAT1 in tumor tissue com-
pared with matched normal tissue (Fig. 6A). The vast majority
of CCRCC is caused by biallelic mutation or inactivation of the
von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (49). The von Hippel-
Lindau tumor suppressor protein is an adapter protein that
interacts with a number of proteins, most notably targeting
HIF1� for degradation by the proteasome. Inactivation of von
Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor thus increases HIF1� expres-
sion. Analysis of HIF1� target genes in CCRCC using the same
FIGURE 5. Proposed model of neutral amino acid homeostasis in cancer cells. Amino acid symporters and exchangers work in combination to ensure a
homeostatic intracellular mixture of all neutral amino acids. SNAT1 is a major net importer (loader) of neutral amino acids including glutamine as a substrate
for glutaminolysis. Amino acid exchangers (harmonizers) quickly harmonize amino acid composition in times of imbalanced amino acid usage. An imbalance
of the amino acid composition results in an amino acid starvation response, which increases SNAT2 expression (rescue). AA, amino acid.

 data sets but also including hereditary CCRCC shows SNAT1
(SLC38A1) among well known targets, such as monocarboxy-
late transporter 4 (SLC16A3), lactate dehydrogenase A, and
hexokinase 2 (Fig. 6B). SNAT1 expression is not only driven by
HIF1� but also by other transcription factors. The ENCODE
database (50) shows a strong signature of MYC binding and
RNA polymerase 2 around the promoter of the SNAT1 gene
Slc38a1 in K562 and HeLa cells (data not shown). Moreover,
hepatocyte growth factor receptor is overexpressed in many
cancers and appears to up-regulate SNAT1 gene expression
through its mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway
(51) (Fig. 6C). This suggests that SNAT1 transport activity is an
important function for many fast growing cancer cells.

FIGURE 6. Database evaluation of SNAT1 expression in cancer tissue and
cells using Oncomine. A, significantly elevated levels of SNAT1 mRNA were
detected in four studies of CCRCC. Depending on the study, samples from
normal adjacent tissue or matched normal control tissue were used to gen-
erate the control microarrays. In all studies, mRNA expression levels were
normalized to the median intensity of all spots on the microarray and plotted
as log2 median-centered intensity. B, coexpression analysis revealed that
SNAT1 (SLC38A1 in the figure) was highly expressed together with HIF1�
target genes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. C, expression of SNAT1 may be
driven by the hepatic growth factor (HGF) oncogenic pathway. Overexpres-
sion of hepatic growth factor in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells sig-
nificantly increases expression of SNAT1. The response can be blocked by
mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors. Data variance is shown as box
plots indicating upper limit, median, and lower limit.
