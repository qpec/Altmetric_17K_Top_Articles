Objective To test the hypothesis that people bereaved by 
suicide are less likely to receive formal or informal support 
than people bereaved by other causes of sudden death.
Design National cross-sectional study.
Setting Adults working or studying at any UK higher 
education institution (HEI) in 2010.
Participants A total of 3432 eligible respondents aged 
18–40 years bereaved by the sudden death of a close 
friend or relative, sampled from approximately 659 572 
bereaved and non-bereaved staff and students at 37 of 
164 UK HEIs invited to participate.
Exposures Bereavement by suicide (n=614; 18%), by 
sudden unnatural causes (n=712; 21%) and by sudden 
natural causes (n=2106; 61%).
Main outcome measures Receipt of formal and informal 
support postbereavement; timing of valued support.
Results 21% (725/3432) of our sample of bereaved adults 
reported receiving no formal or informal bereavement 
support, with no evidence for group differences. People 
bereaved by suicide were less likely to have received 
informal support than those bereaved by sudden natural 
causes (adjusted OR (AOR)=0.79; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.98) or 
unnatural causes (AOR=0.74; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.96) but did 
not differ from either comparison group on receipt of formal 
support. People bereaved by suicide were less likely to have 
received immediate support (AOR=0.73; 95% CI 0.59 to 
0.90) and more likely to report delayed receipt of support 
(AOR=1.33; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.64) than people bereaved by 
sudden natural causes. Associations were not modified by 
gender, or age bereaved, but became non-significant when 
adjusting for stigma.
Conclusions People bereaved by suicide are less 
likely to receive informal support than people bereaved 
by other causes of sudden death and are more likely 
to perceive delays in accessing any support. This is 
concerning given their higher risk of suicide attempt and 
the recommendations within suicide prevention strategies 
regarding their need for support.

InTroducTIon
Empirical research now supports an associa-
tion between bereavement by suicide and a 
range of negative health outcomes, including 
an increased probability of suicide1 and of 
suicide attempt in close contacts.2 US and 
UK suicide prevention strategies recommend 
providing support for people bereaved by 
suicide,3–6 but the extent of implementation 
is unknown. The starting point in addressing 
this task is to provide a description of the 
nature of support services currently used. 
The next challenges are the paucity of trial 
evidence for effective interventions7 and the 
tendency of people bereaved by suicide to 
avoid seeking help8 9 despite expressing clear 
unmet needs.10 This avoidance is likely to be 
linked to stigmatising societal beliefs about 
suicide as a failure of problem solving.9 High 
levels of stigma relative to other bereaved 
groups11 may reduce both willingness to seek 
help and friends’ or relatives’ readiness to 
offer support.9 12 This is concerning if stigma 
adversely affects access to support in a popu-
lation vulnerable to suicide.13
No British study has provided an overview 
of the range of support received by people 
Strengths and limitations of this study
 
► We conducted a large population-based closed 
survey to identify bereaved friends and relatives, 
avoiding the biases inherent to using a help-seeking 
sample.
 
► We captured use of a wide range of formal and 
informal support sources and the time taken to 
access valued support.
 
► We compared support use after different modes of 
sudden bereavement to test a specific hypothesis 
about inequities in support for people bereaved by 
suicide.
 
► Given the age range sampled and the possibility 
of selection bias (favouring higher social classes) 
and male non-response bias, the results of this 
study may only be generalisable to young bereaved 
women and the more highly educated.

bereaved by suicide. US surveys have tended to be small 
and localised14–16 or involve help-seeking samples.17 
Registry-based studies describe health service use18–21 but 
not informal support, a resource known to be valued after 
suicide bereavement.10 For service planning purposes, we 
lack population-based studies describing the prevalence 
and correlates of support received by people bereaved by 
suicide. Our objective was to address this by conducting 
a nationwide population-based survey of bereaved adults, 
collecting data on health outcomes and support received 
after sudden bereavement. We focused on young adults 
given concerns about their vulnerabilities to suicide,22 
their tendency to avoid accessing mental health services23 
and their priority status within UK suicide prevention 
strategies.4–6 Surveying this age range also minimised the 
potential for memory decay and narrowed period effects. 
We aimed to answer the following research questions 
about people bereaved by suicide, compared with those 
bereaved by other sudden forms of death: whether they 
are less likely to receive formal and informal support and 
more likely to receive no support or delayed support; 
whether they are more likely to rely exclusively on formal 
support; whether perceived stigma accounts for reduced 
receipt of support and whether there are gender differ-
ences in support received.

Patient involvement
Our research question was prompted by UK suicide 
prevention strategies4–6 and developed in consultation 
with a group of bereaved adults and bereavement coun-
sellors. This consultation group identified important 
outcomes to capture in relation to the impact of sudden 
bereavement and provision of support and reviewed 
successive drafts of the survey questionnaire. This ques-
tionnaire was piloted with individuals accessing support 
from four national bereavement support organisations: 
Cruse Bereavement Care, Samaritans, Survivors of 
Bereavement by Suicide and Widowed by Suicide. Patients 
were not involved in the population-based recruitment of 
this study or data analysis. All bereaved individuals partici-
pating in the survey were invited to provide contact details 
for dissemination of study findings and to bookmark the 
findings section of the study website: http://www.

bereavementstudy.
Study design and participants
We conducted a national cross-sectional survey of 
young adults working or studying at UK higher educa-
tion institutions (HEIs), avoiding the biases associated 
with recruiting a help-seeking sample.24 In 2010, all 164 
HEIs in the UK were invited to participate, following up 
non-responding HEIs to encourage broad socioeconomic 
and geographic representation. Over 20% (37/164) 
agreed, with a higher response (40%) from those classi-
fied as the more prestigious Russell Group universities. 
This accessed an estimated sampling frame of 659 572 
staff and students. The majority of participating HEIs 
followed study protocol in sending an individual email 
invitation, with embedded survey link, to each staff and 
student member. For reasons of sensitivity, 10 HEIs modi-
fied this strategy, either by emailing students only, using 
their weekly news digest email or advertising via staff and 
student intranet. All recipients, whether bereaved or 
not, were invited to take part in a survey of ‘the impact 
of sudden bereavement on young adults’, with the aim 
of masking them to the specific study hypotheses. As the 
denominator of bereaved people could not be ascer-
tained using survey methods or routine data, there was 
no accurate way of measuring the proportion of bereaved 
people who responded.
Inclusion criteria were people aged 18–40 years who 
had experienced sudden bereavement of a close friend or 
relative. Early childhood bereavements (before age 10) 
were excluded to minimise recall bias. Sudden bereave-
ment was defined as ‘a death that could not have been 
predicted at that time and which occurred suddenly or 
within a matter of days’. Exposure status was subclassified 
by self-report as: bereavement by suicide, bereavement 
by sudden unnatural causes (eg, accidental death) and 
bereavement by sudden natural causes (eg, cardiac 
arrest). For respondents who had experienced more 
than one type of sudden bereavement, we categorised 
exposure as follows: all those bereaved by suicide were 
classified as such, regardless of other exposures. Those 
bereaved by non-suicide death were asked to relate their 
responses to whichever person they had felt closest to, 
with exposure status classified accordingly. We based 
our sample size calculation on the primary outcome for 
a separate study investigating the association between 
suicide bereavement and suicide attempt,2 indicating that 
at least 466 participants were required in any one group 
(two-tailed analysis; 90% power).
The study was approved by the University College 
London (UCL) Research Ethics Committee in 2010 (ref: 
1975/002). All participants provided online informed 
consent.
Procedures
Our online questionnaire2 elicited quantitative data 
on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. We 
described past suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and 
non-suicidal self-harm using standardised measures from 
the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey,25 which distin-
guishes suicide attempt from non-suicidal self-harm 
on the basis of intent.26 We qualified whether each had 
occurred before or after the bereavement or both. Depres-
sion was measured using the Composite International 
Diagnostic Interview screen for lifetime depression,27 
qualified as above. Perceived stigma, the subjective aware-
ness of others’ stigmatising attitudes, was measured using 
the stigma subscale of the Grief Experience Question-
naire.28 Likert-style responses to 10 items (eg, ‘Since the 
death how often did you feel avoided by friends?’) gener-
ated scores of 5–25. We used a fixed-choice question to

ascertain the stage at which respondents felt they had 
been most affected by the loss.
Two tick-box questions probed help received, whether 
sought or offered, after the bereavement: ‘How long 
after the death did you receive help that was valuable to 
you?’ and ‘What help did you receive after the death?’ 
(with 10 options, including None and Other—please 
state). Two tick-box questions probed help-seeking for 
self-harm: ‘If you have harmed yourself since the bereave-
ment did you seek help from anyone?’ and ‘Who did you 
try to get help from?’ (with five options, including Other—
please state). We derived our seven binary outcomes from 
responses to these questions.
Our two primary outcomes were: receipt of any formal 
bereavement support and receipt of any informal bereave-
ment support. Formal and informal support classifications 
were derived from similar British23 and international 
studies of service use.29 Self-help was considered a sepa-
rate category due to problematic formal/informal 
categorisation in relation to bereavement support.30
Four secondary outcomes were: receipt of no valuable 
support, immediate receipt (within 1 week) of valuable 
support, delayed receipt (beyond 6 months) of valu-
able support and exclusive use of formal support. These 
thresholds were agreed on the basis of clinical judgement 
and the published literature.31 A fifth secondary outcome 
was whether those who had attempted suicide postbe-
reavement had sought help for this.
Statistical analysis
We summarised sample characteristics by exposure group 
using χ2 testing (categorical variables) and one-way analysis 
of variance (continuous variables). We used multivariable 
random effects logistic regression to estimate the strength 
of the associations between mode of bereavement expo-
sure (sudden natural causes/sudden unnatural causes/
suicide) and binary outcomes. Our multivariable models 
included eight prespecified confounding variables identi-
fied from existing literature and clinical judgement: age, 
gender, socioeconomic status, preloss depression, preloss 
suicidal and non-suicidal self-harm, other family history 
of suicide (excluding index suicide bereavement), time 
since bereavement and kinship to the deceased. We used 
HEI as random effect to take account of clustering effects 
at the institutional level.
For each outcome we conducted two distinct compar-
isons. The first controlled for the sudden nature of the 
death, using people bereaved by sudden natural causes 
as reference category. The second controlled for the 
violence of the death, using people bereaved by sudden 
unnatural causes as reference category.
To test whether stigma attenuated any associations 
between bereavement exposure and outcomes, we added 
perceived stigma28 to our final models.
We added an interaction term to our final models 
to test a further prespecified hypothesis: that the 
effect of bereavement on receipt of support varied by 
gender such that men bereaved by suicide would show 
a more marked lack of formal and informal support. 
In a post hoc test for interaction, we assessed whether 
age at bereavement (before or after age 18) influenced 
receipt of support, such that bereaved children would 
be better supported.
Finally, we conducted a priori sensitivity analyses to 
assess the impact of simulating predicted non-response 
biases, excluding 918 respondents from the 10 HEIs 
that had modified the protocol recruitment method. We 
conducted an additional sensitivity analysis to compare 
people bereaved by suicide to a reference category of all 
those bereaved by non-suicide sudden death.
All analyses were conducted using Stata V.1232 and 
complete case analysis.
reSulTS
Of the 659 572 bereaved and non-bereaved people invited 
to take part, 5085 people responded to the questionnaire 
by clicking on the survey link. Of these, 91% (n=4630) 
consented to participate and 68% (n=3432) fulfilled eligi-
bility criteria (figure 1). Cluster (HEI) size varied from 
3 to 364 participants (median=52; IQR=25–120). Missing 
data for model covariates and outcomes were less than 
7% for covariates and less than 4% for outcomes.
The sample was primarily female, white and related to 
the deceased by blood (table 1). There were no statistically 
significant group differences by bereavement exposure in 
relation to gender, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, 
personality disorder screen33 or perceived level of social 
support. The mean time elapsed since bereavement was 
4.9 years (SD=5.3; range=1 day–30 years), with no signif-
icant group differences. One quarter (24%; 824/3432) 
reported that they had been most affected in the first week 
after the loss, but a third (38%; 1274/3432) endorsed 
over 6 months after the loss, with no evidence for group 
differences.
Overall, 78% (2572/3432) of the sample reported 
receiving some form of support after the loss, whether 
informal (51%), formal (14%) or both (35%), and 85% 
(2173/2572) perceived some aspect of it to have been 
valuable. Two-fifths (42%; 1438/3432) had received 
valuable support within a week of the loss. Overall, 20% 
of the sample received no support at all, excluding 
the 20 individuals who specified that they had chosen 
to handle the bereavement alone. The most endorsed 
source of informal support was family and friends 
(64%) and of formal support were funeral directors 
(14%) and health professionals (13%). Self-help was 
used by 10% (table 2).
Overall 6% reported having attempted suicide since the 
bereavement, of which 67% (141/210) had not sought 
help for any episode of self-harm occurring postbereave-
ment (table 2). In those who had sought help, the most 
common source was a general practitioner (20%).
People bereaved by suicide were significantly less likely 
to receive informal support than those bereaved by 
sudden natural causes (table 3; adjusted OR (AOR)=0.79;

95% CI 0.64 to 0.98) and those bereaved by unnatural 
causes (table 4; AOR=0.74; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.96). People 
bereaved by sudden unnatural causes were significantly 
more likely to receive formal bereavement support 
than those bereaved by sudden natural causes (table 3; 
AOR=1.28; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.56), but there were no other 
group differences on this outcome.
Compared with people bereaved by sudden natural 
mortality causes, people bereaved by suicide were signifi-
cantly less likely to receive immediate support (table 3; 
AOR=0.73; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.90) and significantly more 
likely to report delayed receipt of support (AOR=1.33; 95% 
CI 1.08 to 1.64). There were no other group differences 
on this or any other secondary outcome. After adding 
perceived stigma to models, all four significant associations 
of suicide bereavement with support outcomes became 
non-significant, as did the association between bereavement 
by sudden unnatural causes and use of formal bereavement 
support.
Interaction tests showed no evidence that gender, or 
childhood versus adult bereavement, modified any of the 
associations identified.

In sensitivity analyses simulating predicted non-re-
sponse biases, the magnitude and direction of 
significant associations between suicide bereavement 
and outcomes were unchanged, apart from the associa-
tion between bereavement by sudden unnatural causes 
and use of formal bereavement support, which became 
non-significant. In an analysis comparing suicide 
bereavement to all non-suicide sudden bereavements, 
we found similar associations in terms of magnitude and 
direction, apart from the association of suicide bereave-
ment with one secondary outcome (delayed receipt of 
valuable support), which became non-significant (see 
online supplementary table).
dIScuSSIon
Main findings
One in four people bereaved by suicide in this national 
sample had received no formal or informal support 
after their loss, despite the major emphasis in English,4 
Northern Irish5 and Welsh6 suicide prevention strate-
gies on improved suicide bereavement support. People 
bereaved by suicide were significantly less likely to have 
received informal support and more likely to describe 
delays in receiving any formal or informal support. These 
findings may not reflect preferences, as receipt of support 
is a function of what is perceived to be available. It is 
therefore unclear whether our findings reflect reduced 
help seeking or an objective lack of help offered. The 
cross-sectional, observational nature of these data limits 
causal inference. However, surveys of the perceived needs 
of people bereaved by suicide indicate clear unmet needs 
for social networks to respond proactively and empathi-
cally and for professionals to offer immediate outreach.10 
This suggests that our findings represent gaps in support 
rather than a rejection or avoidance of help. Whether 
stigma explains the inequalities observed, perhaps by 
inhibiting help-seeking or offers of support, requires 
further research. The low rates of help seeking after 
suicide attempt are particularly concerning in people 
bereaved by suicide given their higher risk of suicide 
attempt2 and the high priority accorded to their needs 
for support within British suicide prevention strategies.
results in the context of other studies
Perhaps reflecting cultural differences, our findings differ 
from those of a representative US sample of suicide-be-
reaved relatives, in which 24% had received either formal 
or informal support and 33% preferred to cope without 
assistance.34 In a US help-seeking sample, 78% reported 
receiving individual therapy after suicide bereavement,17 
a proportion greatly exceeding formal support use in 
our population-based sample. The only British study of 
support after suicide35 did not state the overall propor-
tion receiving support, but the prevalence of counselling 
matched that in our study. Consultation with faith leaders 
was more common than in our sample (10% versus 
2%), perhaps reflecting differing age profiles. Studies 
comparing groups bereaved by suicide and other causes 
have only focused on single measures of perceived social 
support and have, like our study, found weak or no 
evidence for group differences.14–16
Strengths and limitations
This 
national 
sample 
represents 
the 
largest 
and 
most 
compre-
hensive survey of support received by people bereaved by a 
close contact’s sudden death. It included respondents who 
were related and unrelated to the deceased, recognising 
that adverse outcomes and needs for support apply regard-
less of kinship.2 In conducting specific group comparisons, 
we were able to ascertain that reduced receipt of informal 
support was attributable to suicide bereavement rather 
than unnatural losses more widely. Results were robust to 
sensitivity analysis, and use of a precise sampling frame 
allowed us to be clear about the limits of generalisability.

HEIs and the pronounced male non-response bias limit 
generalisability beyond highly educated female groups. The 
limited age-range sampled restricts generalisability beyond 
young adults. Without a denominator, we were unable to 
present a response rate but assume that the majority of 
non-responders were non-bereaved. It was possible that 
those worst affected had biased recall of support received 
and its value. Our multivariable models included pre-be-
reavement depression as a potential confounding variable 
but did not account for pre-bereavement anxiety or other 
mental disorders. If those are differentially elevated prior to 
suicide bereavement, as shown in previous studies,1 stigma 
associated with mental illness and/or poor experiences of 
services might influence receipt of support in this group. 
Models for two secondary outcomes (exclusive use of formal 
support; help seeking for attempted suicide postbereave-
ment) lacked sufficient power due to group sizes <466, and 
larger studies are needed to investigate these hypothesised 
associations. Despite testing for an interaction with gender, 
we acknowledge such tests’ limited statistical power. Given 
gender differences in help-seeking for mental illness,22 
particularly in relation to informal support,23 it would have 
been desirable to have conducted gender-specific analyses, 
but this was not possible due to the low numbers of men 
responding.
Policy implications
The quarter of our suicide-bereaved sample who received 
no support represents failed implementation of UK 
suicide prevention strategies.4–6 This group was distinct 
from the 1% who stated that they preferred to cope 
without assistance. The inequities in informal support we 
identified for people bereaved by suicide suggest a need 
for psychosocial interventions to address social avoid-
ance and stigmatising attitudes within social networks. 
Public education to raise awareness of the vulnerabili-
ties of people bereaved by suicide, the range of support 
available36 and advice on how to support them36 37 could 
encourage social networks to respond more readily after 
suicide loss. This, along with interventions to address self-
stigma, might also encourage the bereaved to seek help 
by reinforcing the idea that they are worthy of support. 
Current UK developments in national systems of early 
outreach after suicide38 will address the identified delays 
in support, particularly at a stage when motivation and 
awareness is low.10
Further research
Research is needed to explore the influence of stigma 
on willingness to seek help after suicide bereavement 
and on others’ readiness to offer support. Thematic 
analysis of our qualitative survey data will permit a more 
nuanced understanding of this. Studies that deepen our 
understanding of help-seeking preferences after suicide 
attempt in people bereaved by suicide might help address 
risk of reattempt. Expanding the limited evidence base 
for interventions after suicide bereavement7 is important, 
as is investigating the potential for adverse psychological 
effects of early39 and peer support40 interventions.
concluSIonS
Our study demonstrated clear inequities in the support 
received by people bereaved by the suicide of a close 
contact, manifested in delayed receipt of support and a 
lesser likelihood of receiving support from family and 
friends. It is concerning that two-thirds of a group featuring 
so prominently in UK suicide prevention strategies receive 
no formal support and that a quarter receive no support 
at all. Those responsible for implementing suicide preven-
tion strategies should commission lay guidance on how to 
support someone bereaved by suicide and improve national 
systems of immediate outreach after suicide loss.
