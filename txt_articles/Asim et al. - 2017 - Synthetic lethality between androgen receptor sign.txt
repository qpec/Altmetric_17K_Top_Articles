Emerging data demonstrate homologous recombination (HR) defects in castration-resistant
prostate cancers, rendering these tumours sensitive to PARP inhibition. Here we demonstrate
a direct requirement for the androgen receptor (AR) to maintain HR gene expression and HR
activity in prostate cancer. We show that PARP-mediated repair pathways are upregulated in
prostate cancer following androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Furthermore, upregulation of
PARP activity is essential for the survival of prostate cancer cells and we demonstrate a
synthetic lethality between ADT and PARP inhibition in vivo. Our data suggest that ADT can
functionally impair HR prior to the development of castration resistance and that, this
potentially could be exploited therapeutically using PARP inhibitors in combination with
androgen-deprivation therapy upfront in advanced or high-risk prostate cancer.

 P
rostate cancer (PCa) is a major cause of male cancer-related
mortality worldwide1. The androgen receptor (AR) is a
ligand-inducible transcription factor that plays a key role in
the initiation, growth and progression of PCa2. Therefore,
androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), which targets the androgen
signalling axis, provides an effective first-line treatment for
advanced PCa3. Progression to lethal castration-resistant prostate
cancer (CRPC) is common and accompanied by restoration or
maintenance of AR signalling, which is involved in the regulation
of metabolism4, 5, cell cycle checkpoints6 and DNA repair7–10.
The recent data also demonstrate mutations in BRCA2, BRCA1,
and ATM genes in about 20% of advanced PCa11. PARP is a
backup DNA repair pathway in cells that have lost BRCA1,
BRCA2 or ATM function12. As a result, BRCA2-deficient cells are
acutely sensitive to PARP inhibition13, 14, a phenomenon known
as synthetic lethality. In line with this, the emerging data
demonstrate profound clinical responses using PARP inhibitors
in CRPC mutated in ATM, BRCA2 and BRCA111, 15, 16.
In PCa, a number of clinical studies have shown that ADT
combined with radiotherapy, which induces DNA double-strand
breaks (DSBs), is a more effective treatment option for locally
advanced disease and is associated with better survival and
disease-free outcome compared with radiotherapy alone17, 18.
Previously,
we
and
others
have
demonstrated
that
non-
homologous end joining repair of DNA DSBs is affected by
ADT, which could be one explanation for this increased sensi-
tivity7–10. Since homologous recombination (HR) is also impor-
tant in radiation-induced DSB repair, here we investigated a
functional link between AR signalling and HR in PCa, which also
could open up a novel therapeutic opportunity using PARP
inhibitors.
In this study, we show that AR signalling regulates the HR and
promotes MRN foci formation, leading to ATM activation in
PCa. Our data suggest that the AR promotes the DNA damage
response (DDR) by facilitating efficient accumulation of үH2AX
and RAD51 foci, promoting HR. Blocking AR signalling in men
receiving ADT activates PARP signalling and thereby inhibition
of AR function is synthetically lethal with PARP inhibition in
PCa.
Results
The AR promotes HR and DDR signalling. Since AR has been
shown to regulate DNA repair7–10, we carried out an in-depth
analysis of the expression pattern of DNA repair genes induced
by AR signalling and revealed a potential link between AR sig-
nalling and HR (Fig. 1a). In line with these results, we observed
that the expression of RAD51, a key player in HR, was sig-
nificantly upregulated in PCa compared with normal benign
prostate tissue (Supplementary Fig. 1a). To interrogate the
functional link between AR signalling and HR, we tested whether
AR signalling affects ionising radiation (IR)-induced RAD51 foci
formation. To test this, we used an isogenic CRPC model C4-2
cell line19, in which ‘high AR’ and corresponding ‘low AR’ levels
are obtained by the doxycycline-mediated induction of a short-
hairpin RNA targeting the AR (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In line
with AR regulating HR genes, we observed decreased numbers of
IR-induced RAD51 foci in ‘low AR’ cells (P < 0.05; 2- and 8 h
post IR) in response to 10 Gy of radiation (Fig. 1b).
To test if there was a direct role of the AR in regulating HR, we
performed a direct repeat-green fluorescent protein (DR-GFP)-
based gene conversion assay in C4-2 cells with a stably integrated
DR-GFP reporter. Consistent with its role in promoting RAD51
foci formation, cells with AR knockdown using a pre-validated
siRNA showed a significant reduction of HR (P < 0.01) (Fig. 1c
and Supplementary Fig. 1c), which appeared to be a true effect on
HR,
as
no
difference
in
cell
cycle
stage
was
observed
(Supplementary Fig. 1d). Next, we determined in detail how the
AR regulates the DDR and repair, and found a strong correlation
between the DDR kinase ATM and the AR-regulated transcrip-
tome of DNA repair genes in PCa cells (Supplementary Fig. 1e).
Supporting this link, we observed an overall defect in IR-induced
үH2AX foci formation in ‘low AR’ cells after 10 Gy of radiation
(P < 0.05 2- and 8 h post IR) (Fig. 1d). In agreement with this, we
found that men with PCa treated with degarelix, a gonadotropin-
releasing hormone analogue, which blocks androgen signalling,
had overall lower levels of үH2AX foci (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
We observed an overall defect in IR-induced үH2AX foci
formation in ‘low AR’ cells 2 h after 10 Gy of radiation in larger
cell numbers by a high-content cytometry method (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2b, c), suggesting that the AR influences the DDR
directly. We also observed that siRNA depletion of ATM in ‘high
AR’ cells reduces the үH2AX intensity comparable to ‘low AR’
levels (P < 0.01) (Supplementary Fig. 2d). A further link between
the AR and ATM signalling was observed using an isogenic
inducible AR point mutant (T878A) expressed in the PC3 cell
line, in which doxycycline treatment triggered AR expression. We
observed that from 48 h after exposure to ionising radiation, the
‘full AR’ cells grew faster than ‘AR null’ cells, but this differential
response was eliminated by ATM inhibitor (KU55399) treatment
(Supplementary Fig. 2e). No differential growth response was
observed in AR null PC3-Empty Vector control cells (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2f).
The ATM and other DDR proteins affect MRE11 activity to
resect DNA ends, which is required for HR. Mining the AR
transcriptome (GEO identifier GDS4113), we observed down-
regulation of the MRE11 transcript by AR knockdown, which was
also directly suppressed at the protein level by AR knockdown
(Supplementary Fig. 2g, h). As ATM regulates MRE11 activity, we
tested formation of hydroxyurea-induced MRE11 foci, which
were higher in ‘high AR’ cells (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1e). That the
MRE11 foci represent active MRE11 resection was demonstrated
by addition of the MRE11 inhibitor Mirin, which reduced the
number of MRE11 foci in “high AR” cells (Fig. 1e). Taken
together, these data suggest that AR is required for effective ATM
signalling in response DNA damage in PCa, influencing MRE11
mediated resection required for proficient HR.
To verify these findings in patients, a prospective study was set
up with PCa patients. PCa was diagnosed at biopsy and patients
then underwent pharmacological castration with neo-adjuvant
leuprolide. A second biopsy was taken 8 weeks post leuprolide
treatment. Half the cohort had leuprolide before radiation
treatment, the other half started radiotherapy before leuprolide.
The proportion of cell positive for Ki67 and RAD51 were
quantified using immune-fluorescence in a randomly selected sub
cohort of 11 patients treated with ADT before
2 × 5 Gy
fractionated
radiation
and
from
12
patients
treated
with
fractionated radiation alone (Fig. 1f). In all biopsies, the intensity
of Ki67 and RAD51 in the nucleus for all epithelial cells was
measured. The fraction of RAD51-positive cells in the population
of cycling cells (Ki67 positive) was calculated for each biopsy.
A significantly lower (P < 0.01) fraction of RAD51-positive cells
in the population of cycling cells was seen in tissue from those
patients who received ADT before radiation compared with those
treated with radiation alone, suggesting that, as in PCa cell lines,
ADT treatment also hampers HR repair after radiation in patients
(Fig. 1g).
Androgen deprivation therapy activates PARP in PCa. Pre-
viously, we demonstrated that PARP1 is activated in HR-defective
cells, and that sensitivity to PARP inhibitors is related to PARP

 activation20. Recently, it was demonstrated that AR upregulation
can cause redioresistance21. Since we found that the AR promotes
HR, we hypothesized that AR inhibition by ADT may impair HR,
leading to an increase in backup PARP activity. To test this
hypothesis, we treated C4-2 cells with the non-steroidal anti-
androgens bicalutamide (Bic) and enzalutamide (Enz). Both
drugs led to an increase of PARP activity (Fig. 2a; Supplementary
Fig. 7a). To further investigate links between ADT, HR and PARP
activity, we transfected C4-2 cells with siRNA against RAD51 and
AR. We observed an increase in PARP activity in both the
RAD51- and AR-depleted cells, suggesting that ADT impairs HR,
leading to an increase in PARP activity (Fig. 2b; Supplementary
Fig. 7b). We next tested whether the increase in PARP activity
was due to AR inhibition induced unresolved DNA damage. IR-
induced DSBs were directly measured in ‘high AR’ and ‘low AR’
C4-2 cells using neutral comet assay but we did not find any
difference in DSBs in ‘high AR’ or ‘low AR’ context, indicating
that the AR inhibition-induced PARP activation was not due to
increased DSBs in the DNA (Supplementary Fig. 2i).
To test if such signalling also occurs in patients, we used the
prospective study with PCa patients described above. Immuno-
fluorescence signalling levels of PARP1 and its substrate PAR
were quantified in cancer areas in corresponding paired slides
(Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3a). To measure the activity of
the PARP1 enzyme, we calculated the ratio of PAR to PARP1
intensity in the nuclei. In leuprolide-treated patients, we found a
significant increase in PARP1 activity as reflected in increased
PARylation (P = 0.003) compared with biopsies taken from the
same patients before castration (Fig. 2c, d), suggesting that
PARP1 is activated as a result of androgen deprivation,
further strengthening our findings showing that AR regulates
HR in PCa.

 It could be speculated that not only the activity of PARP, but
also the PARP1 gene expression is higher as a consequence of the
HR defect. Since our biopsies have part cancer and part non-
malignant tissue, we quantified PARP1 mRNA using RNA-
fluorescence in situ hybridisation (RNA-FISH) while maintaining
spatial resolution in order to be able to correlate PARP mRNA to
the pathologically verified cancer areas. We found no meaningful
increase of PARP mRNA density levels in cancer tissue, as was
also the case of PARP protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 4).
These data are in line with previous demonstration that PARP is
activated at stalled replication forks caused by the HR defect22
thus ruling out that a HR defect would affect PARP1 gene
expression directly.
Synthetic lethality between the AR and poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase. Previously, we demonstrated that HR defective cells
show increased reliance on PARP activity and demonstrated a
synthetic
lethality
between
PARP-
and
BRCA-mutated
cancers13, 14. Here we observed an ADT-induced HR defect,
suggesting that it may be possible to generate a context dependent
synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors following ADT. Because
we observed high PARP activity after ADT in patients (Fig. 2) and
also high PARP activity in PCa cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b), we
reasoned that a combined inhibition of both pathways may
selectively induce a synthetic lethality in PCa.
To test this hypothesis, we used the anti-androgens bicaluta-
mide or enzalutamide in combination with PARP inhibitor
Olaparib. This decreased cell viability of the AR-positive cell lines
C4-2 and LN3 (Fig. 3a, b), which was also confirmed by using
other PCa cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). The proliferation
of C4-2 cells was also reduced by co-treatment with Olaparib and
either bicalutamide or enzalutamide, (Fig. 3c). Also, AR shRNA-
mediated knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation, and this
was further decreased by Olaparib (Fig. 3d). Consistent with that
finding, the synthetic lethality was AR dependent, knockdown of
the ectopically expressed T878A AR mutant in PC3-T878A and
C4-2 cell lines (which endogenously express this mutant) had only
marginal effects on cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 5f, g, 5e, f).
The clonogenic potential of C4-2 cells expressing the control
shNT was unchanged by doxycycline treatment, while C4-2 cells
expressing control shNT cells treated with Olaparib formed fewer
colonies independent of doxycycline treatment (Fig. 3e). In
contrast, the clonogenic potential of doxycycline-treated C4-2
cells expressing shAR ‘low AR’ was severely compromised by
Olaparib (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3f), indicating synthetic lethality.
Two primary modes by which PARP inhibitors act are as
follows: (A) catalytic inhibition of the PARP enzyme and
consequently blocking PARylation of proteins and (B) trapping
of PARP on ssDNA intermediates generated by the DNA
damage23, 24. If left unrepaired, these PARP trapped-ssDNA
intermediates may be converted into DSBs in S-phase and may
lead to cell death. In our study, we observed loss of the growth
inhibitory effect of Olaparib in C4-2 cells in which PARP1 was
knocked down with RNAi, indicating that the growth inhibitory
effect of Olaparib could be partially manifested via the trapping of
PARP1 (Supplementary Fig. 5g). These experiments suggest that
AR and PARP may act through functionally distinct pathways
that converge to promote cell growth under genotoxic stress,
further strengthening the model of contextual synthetic lethality.
Next, we wanted to evaluate the synthetic lethality between
ADT and PARP inhibitors in vivo, and therefore generated
tumour xenografts of C4-2 cells. In the vehicle, bicalutamide- and
Olaparib-treated groups a progressive increase in tumour volume
was observed (Fig. 4a). However, combined treatment with

 clinically relevant material, we used an ex vivo human tumour
culture assay, where treatment of PCa tissue explants with
bicalutamide or enzalutamide had no effect on proliferation index
(measured by Ki67), but proliferation was strongly repressed by
the combination of Olaparib with bicalutamide or enzalutamide
(P < 0.05) (Fig. 4c, d). Treatment with Olaparib alone and by
combined bicalutamide and Olaparib increased levels of cleaved
caspase-3 (CC3) (a marker of apoptosis) compared to controls or
single
treatments
(Supplementary

However,
the
combination of enzalutamide and Olaparib did not result in
increased CC3 (Supplementary Fig. 6h).
Discussion
Radiotherapy combined with ADT is now standard radical
management for men with intermediate- and high-risk PCa. ADT
alone is used for palliative treatment in advanced PCa and relapse
is common. Previous reports of altered gene expression of DNA
repair genes in CRPC25, have now been extended with identifi-
cation of somatic mutations in DNA repair genes in about 20% of
CRPC11, particularly in BRCA2 and ATM. The likely evolu-
tionary advantage of mutations or loss of BRCA2 and ATM in
CRPC is that they act as tumour suppressors in the CRPC.
Remarkably, our finding that inhibition of AR signalling results in
reduced HR and ATM signalling suggests that HR is impaired in
the early phases of ADT treatment. It is tempting to speculate that
HR or ATM signalling would have a tumour suppressor function
after ADT and that down-regulation of HR is a mechanism
whereby the tumour increases its ability to survive treatment.
Mechanistically, we have demonstrated that loss of the AR
leads to downregulated HR gene expression, reduced ATM sig-
nalling and MRE11 foci formation. MRE11 activity is required for
resection at DSBs to generate a substrate onto which RAD51 can
be loaded. Hence, our data suggest that HR is impaired by ADT at
the stage of DNA double-strand end processing, which is
unsurprising, since expression of many HR genes is down-
regulated. It is well established that PARP is a backup repair
system required for survival in absence of HR13, 14. Here we
demonstrate, both in cell lines in vitro and in a prospective
clinical study, that PARP activity is increased in PCa tissue fol-
lowing ADT, in line with the hypothesis that HR is down-
regulated after ADT in vitro.
Different PARP inhibitors have different trapping abilities24, and
hence it is important to determine whether PARP trapping is
important. Our finding that toxicity is removed by PARP1 siRNA
suggests that PARP trapping is relevant for the manifestation of
toxicity, which is in line with current perception of the mechanism
of action for PARP inhibitors in killing HR defective cells24.
Recent reports indicate remarkable responses to PARP inhi-
bitors in the HR defective cohort of CRPC15, 16. About 20% of
CRPC have mutations in either BRCA2 or ATM11, and an
additional ~ 15 % have mutations in other HR genes. The
remaining two-third of CRPC likely gained ADT resistance
through means other than mutation of HR genes, probably
explaining why they do not respond to PARP inhibitor therapy16.
Hence, mutational loss of HR is a possible way of generating ADT
resistance and development of CRPC. Here, we find an
immediate downregulation of HR in response to ADT, which is a
likely reflection of these cells acutely improving fitness for sur-
vival. ADT is commonly used in early treatment of advanced
PCa, but this is not a curative treatment. Here, we demonstrate
that combining ADT with PARP inhibitors improves ADT and
may increase the possibility of receiving more profound and long-
lasting responses.
We suggest that the ADT and PARP inhibitor combination
treatment is likely to be most effective in treatment of the early
disease, rather than at the late CRPC stage. The HR mutated
CRPC would not benefit as they already are defective in HR and
would respond to PARP inhibitors in monotherapy, as already

 demonstrated16. CRPC that acquired resistance by means other
than mutating HR genes would not benefit either as they are
likely not responding to ADT at all, and hence would not
downregulate HR genes and would not acquire PARP inhibitor
sensitivity.
PARP inhibitors are generally well tolerated in patients and in
combination with ADT, the HR defect would be predominantly
restricted to the prostate tissue and toxicity would only occur
there. Hence, we argue that ADT and PARP inhibitor combina-
tion treatment may be particularly beneficial in newly diagnosed
high-risk PCa as (1) they have not generated castration resistance
by means other than loss of HR and (2) the synthetic lethality is
confined to the prostate and is likely to be well tolerated. The
ADT and PARP combination treatment may be offered not only
to newly diagnosed metastatic PCa but potentially as adjuvant
treatment
in
high-risk
men
undergoing
prostatectomy
or
radiotherapy.

Cell culture. Unless stated otherwise, all cell lines were verified by genetic profiling
of polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) loci as per ATCC standards. We used
AmpFISTR test or GenePrint10 test (Promega, Madison, WI) and analysed all the
data using GeneMapper v4.0 software. LNCaP, C4-2, PC3, PNT1a, and DUCaP
cells were obtained from commercial suppliers and grown in RPMI cell culture
medium containing 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin in a humidified
incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. We generated and cultured C4-2-NT control
(expressing non-targeting RNA; siNT) and C4-2-shAR cells as described earlier19.
LNCaP-LN3 cells have been described previously26.
Analysis of γH2AX and Rad51 foci in cells. C4-2 ‘high AR’ and ‘low AR’ shRNA
cells were grown in RPMI medium containing 10% hormone-depleted serum and
cells were treated with R1881 (1 nM) for ‘high AR’ or doxycycline (1 µg/ml) for 72
h to induce shRNA expression for ‘low AR’. Cells were exposed to IR (10 Gy) using
a Cs137 source. For imaging, cells were grown in Ibidi ibiTreat 8-well µ-slides
(Ibidi GmbH, Germany), pre-cleared with PBS containing 0.2% Triton-X-100 for 1
min then fixed in 3% PFA-2% sucrose solution in PBS for 10 min, washed 3× with
PBS and blocked in Odyssey buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were
incubated with the combination of antibodies against үH2AX (1:2500) and Rad51
(1:500) overnight in Odyssey blocking solution and washed 3× with PBS containing
0.1% Triton-X-100. Cells were incubated with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor®
488 and Alexa Fluor® 647 antibodies (both 1:1000; Life Technologies) for 1 h at
room temperature. Cells were again washed with PBS containing 0.1% triton-X-100
and DNA counterstained with DAPI for 10 min followed by mounting with vec-
tashield (Ibidi). Images were acquired on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope (Leica
Microsystems Ltd). Three channels were used for DAPI (blue), үH2AX_Alexa-
Fluor488 (green) and Rad51_AlexaFluor647 (far red). For analysis, the Leica image
file was imported directly into Columbus software (PerkinElmer, UK). Images were
analysed using a custom analysis protocol set up on the three channels. The DAPI
channel was used to segment individual nuclei using standard algorithms within
the software. үH2AX and Rad51 signal per nucleus was calculated by the quanti-
fication of the green and far red signals within the DAPI nuclear mask. The ‘find
spots’ function was added into the protocol to detect үH2AX foci (green channel)
and Rad51 foci (far red channel) within the nucleus, using appropriate settings to
detect each individual focus. Functions were then added in to calculate morphology
allowing foci number to be extracted.
Immunohistochemistry, image processing, nuclei segmentation and spot
quantification for γH2AX. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 3 μm sec-
tions from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples using an automated
immunostainer with cover tile technology (Bond-III system, Leica Biosystems).
A commercial antibody to үH2AX (1:400 dilution) was used as the primary
antibody. Antigen retrieval was carried out using the combination of heat and
Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 1 (Leica Biosystems). The Bond™ Polymer Refine
Detection kit (Leica Biosystems) was used for visualising the antigens. Negative
control experiments, in which primary antibodies were omitted, resulted in a
complete absence of staining.
All the images were processed with FIJI software (or ImageJ, National Institute
of Health, Bethesda, MD) using a set of semi- and fully-automated custom-made
macros. Briefly, artefacts within the image, i.e., bubbles, dust or out-of-focus
regions were detected and removed upon user validation. Haematoxylin and
diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining were then automatically separated as individual
channels using a macro calling the ‘colour deconvolution’ plugin27 set with the
“H&E DAB” vectors. A final macro was used to discard any secretion feature that
could be further detected as a positive signal within the DAB channel. Processed
DAB images were then analyzed with Columbus software (PerkinElmer, Waltham,
MA). Nuclear segmentation was performed and small, large or elongated objects
were removed. However, there was a mixed population of cancer and sparse
stromal cells; a novel method was designed to select cells clustered in a cancer area
automatically. Briefly, regions were defined as an extension by 50 pixels (12.5 μm)
around each nucleus. By default, as no overlap is allowed by Columbus, measured
areas for clustered cells were smaller than isolated stromal cells. Spot detection was
finally achieved only for individually sorted cancer cells. Low-amplitude
(maximum over local background intensity) spots were discarded to limit the
contribution of false positives.
Plasmids, siRNA and transient transfections. In order to achieve potent
reduction in target mRNA expression, siRNA smart pool was used for gene
knockdown (Dharmacon/Life Technologies). Transient transfections with siRNA
were performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Life Tech-
nologies) as per manufacturer’s recommendations. We performed reverse trans-
fections and used 25 nM siRNA in all knockdown experiments; MMTV-Luc and
Renilla-Luc reporter plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies) as per manufacturers’ instructions.
DR-GFP assay. C4-2 cells containing the DR-GFP reporter were generated by
transfecting the cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stable
clones (designated C4-2 DRGFP cells) were selected on puromycin (2 µg/ml) and
maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS. These cells were seeded in six-well culture
dishes and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent with ISce1 (0.75 µg per
well) and siRNA (50 nM). After 72 h, cells were collected and the percentage of
GFP-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry using BD FacsCaliber (BD
Biosciences). The data analysis was carried out using Flowjo software (Tree Star
Inc.).
Western blot analysis. Samples subjected to SDS-PAGE were transferred to a
PVDF membrane (Amersham) and transfer efficiency was checked with Ponceau
red. The membrane was blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer for 1 h at room
temperature and washed with TBS-T (TBS, 0.05% Tween-20), then incubated with
the indicated primary antibody dilutions as per manufacturer’s instruction over-
night at 4 °C. Upon washing with TBS-T, membrane was incubated with HRP
antibody for 1 h at room temperature and chemiluminiscence detected by Licor
Odyssey instrument.
Leuprolide clinical study design. After ethical approval from the regional ethics
committee of Uppsala University (EPN Dnr 2011:066), patients with localised, i.e.,
non-metastatic PCa, eligible for curative RT, were enrolled in the study. After the
completion of a written informed consent, the patients were allocated to one of the
two study arms.
In Arm 1, 25 patients received neo-adjuvant pharmacological castration with
leuprolide, a GnRH analogue, followed by external beam radiotherapy in daily 2 Gy
fractions to a total dose of 78 Gy. In Arm 2, 23 patients first received radiotherapy,
in 2 Gy daily fractions for 5 consecutive days, followed by neo-adjuvant leuprolide
and then an equivalent, higher RT dose to a total of 82 Gy. Before treatment,
needle-core biopsy specimens were obtained from all patients. In Arm 1, a second
biopsy was taken 8 weeks after the leuprolide injection, i.e., before radiotherapy was
started and a third biopsy about 3 h after the fifth fraction. In Arm 2, a second
biopsy was taken about 3 h after the fifth radiation fraction, i.e., before hormone
treatment was initiated and a third biopsy 8 weeks after the administration of
leuprolide.
Histology and immunofluorescence from the Leuprolide clinical study. Paraffin
embedded prostate needle biopsies were sectioned and stained with H&E. In all
biopsies, cancer areas were assessed according to the Gleason system and annotated
by an uropathologist. Two biopsies, predominantly cancer, were picked from each
biopsy session to be further sectioned for immunofluorescence analysis. After

 deparaffinisation and rehydration of the slides, antigen retrieval was performed
with R-Buffer A (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in a pressure cooker. Blocking was
performed with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and the sections were subse-
quently incubated with different primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Rinsing was
performed 3 ×5 min in TBS buffer before incubation with the secondary antibodies
for 1 h at room temperature. After counterstaining of DNA, slides were mounted
with ProLong Gold (Molecular Probes).
For PARP-1 and PAR measurement, slides were stained with the primary
antibodies PARP-1 (1:500, H-250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and PAR (1:500,
H10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the secondary antibodies donkey IgG–Alexa
Fluor 488 (1:500; Molecular Probes) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG–Alexa Fluor 555
(1:500; Molecular Probes). DNA was counterstained with TO-PRO-3 iodide (2 μM,
Molecular Probes). Images from a cancer area with a good immunofluorescence
signal were selected from each biopsy. The corresponding areas in the H&E-stained
section were identified for histological verification of the cancer area. Two areas
from each slide containing 300–600 cells were chosen for analyses. TO-PRO-3 was
used as a DNA marker. All images were analysed, with respect to average staining
intensity inside the nuclei and in the cytoplasm. The nuclear area was defined by
the TO-PRO-3 signal. All measurements were performed using a program written
in-house for National Institutes of Health (NIH) ImageJ. Fluorescence images were
obtained with a Zeiss LSM 780 inverted confocal microscope, using a Plan-
Apochromat 40×/NA 1.2 objective. Through-focus maximum projection images
were acquired from optical sections 0.5 μm apart and with a section thickness of
1.0 μm. H&E-stained images were obtained with a Leica scan system.
For RAD51 and Ki67 measurement, slides were stained with the primary
antibodies RAD51 (1:400, ab63801, Abcam) and Ki67 (1:250, MIB-1, Dako) and
the secondary antibodies were donkey anti-mouse IgG–Alexa Fluor 564 (1:500;
Molecular Probes) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG–Alexa Fluor 647 (1:500; Molecular
Probes). DNA was counterstained with DAPI (1 μg/ml, Thermo Scientific). Tiled
images covering the whole biopsy were acquired for each biopsy with a Zeiss LSM
780 inverted confocal microscope, using a Plan-Apochromat 20×/NA 0.8 objective.
Tiled images were created from single images with a section thickness of 4.0 μm.
Measurements of the average intensity of Ki67 and RAD51 in nucleus of epithelial
cells were done for all biopsies with an in-house written program for National
Institutes of Health (NIH) ImageJ. Cells were considered Ki67 positive if their
average nuclear fluorescence for Ki67 was five times higher than the average Ki67
fluorescence for all nuclei, or if the five times average Ki67 fluorescence was above
200 in a scale from 0 to 255. Ki67-positive cells were considered RAD51 positive if
the RAD51 average intensity in the nuclei was two times higher than the average
RAD51 intensity for all nuclei. For each biopsy the percentage of Ki67-positive cells
that were RAD51 positive was calculated. Biopsies with fewer than five Ki67-
positive cells were excluded from the analyses.
Degarelix clinical study design. Full ethical approval was obtained (11/H0311/2)
for clinical studies NCT01852864 and NCT00967889. Written informed consent
was received from participants prior to inclusion in the study which was carried out
at Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge. A total of 27 patients with high-risk
organ-confined PCa were treated with 240 mg of degarelix s.c. 7 days before sur-
gery. Fresh PCa samples were obtained at the time of radical prostatectomy and
snap frozen. Confirmation of castrate levels of plasma testosterone in degarelix-
treated patients was achieved by mass spectrometry. These results were compared
with matched controlled samples from 20 untreated patients. Tissues were spotted
on microscopic slides to generate tissue microarrays.
C4-2 PARP activity assay. C4-2 cells were transfected with 20 nM of siRNA of
RAD51 (Invitrogen), AR (Gift from Oxford) or AllStars Negative control (Qiagen)
using Interferin (Polyplus). siRNA and interferin mixture were removed after 24 h
and replaced with fresh media or cells were treated with 10 µM of Bicalutamide and
Enzalutamide for 72 h. At the end of incubation, cells were washed twice in PBS
and scraped. Later lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA,
1% Triton X-100, Roche protease inhibitor 10×, Thermo phosphatase inhibitors
100×) was added to the cell pellet, which was then and kept on ice for 30 min
followed by sonication for complete lysis. The protein concentration was measured
and proteins were separated on a 4–12% Bis-Tris acrylamide gel followed by
transfer to a nitro cellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in odyssey
blocking buffer followed by overnight incubation with primary antibody (pADPr
(Santa Cruz, clone10H), AR (Santa Cruz, N-20), PARP1(Santa Cruz, H250),
RAD51 (Santa Cruz, H92), β−actin (Abcam, ab49900) and 1 h incubation with
fluorescent secondary antibodies (HRP-conjugated rabbit and mouse antibodies
from LICOR). Odyssey LICOR was used to analyze western blot band.
Histological and immunofluorescence evaluation of PAR and PARP-1. All
prostatic needle biopsy specimens were embedded in paraffin, sectioned and
stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). In all specimens, the cancer area was
assessed according to the Gleason system28 and marked by a uro-pathologist. Two
cancer-rich specimens from each batch of biopsies were further sectioned for
immunofluorescence analysis. These sections were deparaffinised and rehydrated
before antigen retrieval with Tris/EDTA (Citrus buffer, pH 9) in a pressure cooker.
After blocking with 2% BSA, the sections were incubated with different primary
antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After extensive rinsing, the sections were incubated
with the secondary antibodies (donkey anti mouse IgG-alexa 488 (1:500), Mole-
cular probe and donkey anti rabbit IgG-alexa 555 (1:500), Molecular probe) for 1 h
at room temperature. DNA was counterstained with TO-PRO-3 iodide (Molecular
probe) and slides mounted with pro long gold (Molecular probe). Dual staining
was performed on the same slide PARP1 (1:200, H-250, sc-7150, Santa Cruz)
together with PAR (1:200, pADPr (10H): sc-56198, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Images from a tumour area with a good degree of immunofluorescence signals
were selected from each biopsy. The corresponding areas in the HE-stained section
were identified for histological verification of the tumour area. Selected areas from
each slide containing 300–600 cells were chosen for analyses. TO-PRO-3 was used
as a DNA marker. All images were analysed, with respect to medium intensity
inside the nuclei and in the cytoplasm. The nuclear area was defined by the TO-
PRO-3 signal (Supplementary Fig. 1d). PARP1 is a protein with both nuclear and
cytoplasmic localisation and intensity values are presented without background
subtraction. All measurements were performed using an in house-written pro-
gramme for NIH-imageJ. Fluorescence images were obtained with either a Zeiss
LSM 510-inverted confocal microscope or a Zeiss LSM 780-inverted confocal
microscope, using a planapochromat 40X/NA 1.2 objectives. Through-focus
maximum projection images were acquired from optical sections 0.5 μm apart and
with a section thickness of 1.0 μm. H&E-stained images were obtained with a Leica
scan system.
Single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH). The probe targeting PARP1 was designed
based on our previously described database covering all human transcripts (www.
fusefish.eu) and consisted of 65 × 20 nt-long oligonucleotides targeting the tran-
script variant ENST00000366794 (Supplementary Table 1). We purchased oligos
with a 3′-TEG amino modification from Biosearch Technologies, and coupled
them to Alexa Fluor® 647 NHS Succinimidyl Ester (Molecular Probes, Cat.
A20006) as previously described29. For smFISH, FFPE prostate biopsies were de-
paraffinised in xylene, rehydrated, immersed 5 min in methanol-acetic acid 3:1 (v/
v), and heated for 45 min at 80 °C in 0.01 M sodium citrate pH 6 supplemented
with ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (RVC, NEB, Cat. S1402S) diluted 1:20 (v/v).
All deparaffinisation steps were performed in special plastic jars (EMS, Cat. 71385)
thoroughly decontaminated from RNases using RNaseZap® (Ambion, Cat.
AM9780). All solutions were prepared in RNase-free water (Ambion, Cat.
AM9939). After dehydration, 22 × 22 mm ‘Secure Seal’ hybridisation chambers
(EMS, Cat. 70333-10) were mounted on each coverglass. Tissues were rehydrated
and treated for 15 min with 0.025% pepsin in 0.01 M HCl. Auto-fluorescence was
reduced by repeatedly flushing the chamber with freshly prepared 1% NaBH4 in 1X
PBS solution, over a period of 15 min at room temperature. After washing in
RNase-free water (3 times, 10 min each), the samples were washed in 2× SSC buffer
(Ambion, Cat. 9763). Hybridisation, washings, mounting and imaging were per-
formed as previously described29. Per field of view, we acquired 35 stacked images
every 0.3 µm using a 100X magnification objective.
To quantify the smFISH signal, we selected the 5 most in-focus images in each
stack and then counted all the mRNA molecules in each field of view using custom
scripts in MATLAB®, as previously described29. To get an estimate of the mRNA
density per cell (dots per µm3), we used an approach similar to what we recently
described for quantifying HER2 and estrogen receptor transcriptional
heterogeneity in breast cancer30: we split the z-projection of the mRNA dots
identified in each stack into a regular grid of 13 × 13 squared pseudo-cells, and then
divided the number of dots in each pseudo-cell by the number of focal planes
minus one times the distance between each plane times the pseudo-cell area. In
order to exclude possible background dots, we only considered pseudo-cells
containing ≥3 mRNA dots.
Reporter assay. In all luciferase assays, Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega) was
used as an internal control. All cells treated with androgens, R1881 (1 nM) were
grown in hormone-depleted (charcoal-stripped) FBS. Cells were collected 48 h
post-transfection using passive lysis buffer provided with dual luciferase assay
reagents (Promega) to measure both luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase
activity using luminometer (Pherastar).
Cell viability assay. Cells were trypsinised and counted using a Vicell instrument.
Cell growth assays were carried out in 96 well plates (1500–2000 cells per well).
Cells were plated and simultaneously treated with the indicated chemicals/drugs
until control (vehicle)-treated cells reached 95% confluence level (between 5 and
7 days for the different cell lines). Cell viability was determined by incubating the
culture with MTS reagent (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethox-
yphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) followed by colorimetric assay as per
manufacturers protocol (Promega).
Live cell imaging/confluence analyses. Confluence analyses were performed
using the Incucyte instrument (Essen Bioscience). Cells were plated and simulta-
neously treated with drugs in TPP 96-well culture plates and placed in a humidified
chamber Incucyte instrument. Experiments were conducted with 8 replicates and
live cell images were recorded every 3 h. For clarity of presentation, 12 h time
interval data only are shown.

 Clonogenic assay. Cells were seeded in 6-well culture dishes (Corning); (1000 cells
per well) and 48 h later were treated with antagonists (10 µM) and/or inhibitors
(1 µM). Media and drugs were replenished bi-weekly. Two weeks later, cells were
fixed in acetone:methanol (1:1) for 5 min and stained with Giemsa (Raymond A
Lamb ltd.; diluted and filtered 1:10 in water) for 10–15 min. Plates were washed
under running tap water, air dried and the colonies were counted using colony
analyser (Oxford Optronix). All colonies were counted; experiments were con-
ducted in triplicate.
Immuno histo-chemistry for Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) of ex vivo
culture. Immuno-histochemical staining of paraffin embedded slides was per-
formed to detect Ki67 and CC3. Slides were stained on a BondMax Autostainer
(Leica, Milton Keynes, UK). Antigen retrieval was performed using standard tri-
sEDTA method at 100 °C for 20 min followed by a 15 min incubation with primary
antibodies for Ki67 (Dako, M7240) and CC3 (cleaved caspase-3; 9664, Cell Sig-
naling Technology) at room temperature, 8 min incubation with a secondary
antibody (biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit; cat. No 711-065-152 from Jackson
immunoresearch) using a polymer secondary system (Leica) followed by devel-
oping with DAB using enhancer (SP-2001; vector labs). Haematoxylin counter-
staining was performed automatically on the Bond system, and finally, the slides
were dehydrated, cleared and mounted using a Leica ST5020 attached coverslipper
CV5030 (Leica). Slides were scanned onto Aperio/SpectrumTM v10.2.2.2317 and
were analysed using ImageScope (Aperio software v12.0.0.5039). The intensity and
number of nuclear Ki67 and CC3 was quantified using an algorithm that identifies
nuclear staining, and the number of positive nuclei was counted. In order to
identify epithelial structures for quantification, images, H&E- and cytokeratin-
stained slides were used to pinpoint their exact location on serially sectioned slides.
For each condition, at least 400 cells were counted and the percentage of positively
stained cells was calculated.
Neutral comet assay. Seventy-two hours after treatment with Doxycycline to
induce shRNA for AR, C4-2 cells were exposed to IR and washed twice with PBS
and collected by trypsinisation. Approximately 5 × 103 cells in 10 μl of PBS (−)
were mixed with 90 μl of LMAgarose (Trevigen), placed on GelBond Film (Lonza),
covered with a 22 mm cover slide (VWR International) and left at 4 °C for 1 h. On
removal of the cover slide, the cells were lysed with lysis solution (Trevigen) at 4 °C
for 1 h. Following a wash with TBE (90 mM Tris borate (pH 8.3) and 2 mM
EDTA), the samples were subjected to electrophoresis at 35 V, for 7 min in TBE.
After washing with TBE, samples were fixed with 70% ethanol for 5 min at room
temperature and dried overnight. The nuclei were stained with SYBR Green I
(Invitrogen) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mM EDTA for 5 min at 4 °C.
Images were taken with an IX71 fluorescent microscope (Olympus) with Cell∧F
software (Olympus). Tail moments were measured using CometScore software
(TriTek). The means of tail moment of at least 30–50 cells were measured per
condition. Efficiency of DSB repair was determined as the tail moment ratio
between the time points and the undamaged control cells obtained immediately
after treatment.
Generation of tumour xenografts. All experiments were carried out in com-
pliance with the UK Animals (Scientifics Procedures) Act 1986 under a Project
Licence and with the approval of the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute
Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body. Xenografts were generated in NSG mice
by subcutaneous injection of cells. For PC3/PC3-AR xenografts, 1 million cells in
50 µl PBS were mixed with 50 µl Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected into the
flanks region of each mouse (n = 6; both flanks). Once tumours (n = 8-12 per
group) were palpable, mice were given vehicle (Cyclodextrin, Sigma Aldrich) or
Olaparib (1 mg per mouse daily for 3 weeks) (LC laboratories) via the intra-
peritoneal route. Tumour size was measured weekly using callipers. To generate
C4-2 xenografts, 2 million cells in 50 µl PBS were mixed with 50 µl Matrigel and
injected into the flank region of each mouse (n = 6 per group). Mice were given
vehicle (DMSO) or Olaparib (50 mg/kg twice weekly) and/or bicalutamide (20 mg/
kg twice weekly; Sigma-Aldrich) via the intra-peritoneal route. Tumour size was
measured with callipers weekly. For all xenografts, tumour volumes were calculated
using the formula volume = (π/6)/abc or (π/6)/abb (if only 2 diameters are avail-
able) and a,b,c are the orthogonal axis of the tumour. Mice were culled at com-
pletion of the experiment or when tumours reached 10% of body weight.
Ex vivo prostate explant culture. Fresh human PCa tissue was collected after
informed consent (70-year-old hormone-naive patient with cT3 disease with a PSA
value of 82) and according to institutional policy. Excised tissue was cut into 1–2
mm3 size pieces and grown on collagen cushions placed on steel grids in RPMI
with 10%FBS, 1% penicilln, streptomycin and gentamycin, and were treated with
drugs for 1 week. Collagen cushions were prepared by solidification of 250 μl of
collagen mix (rat tail collagen, plain RPMI media, FBS and 10% RPMI in the ratio
of 7:1:1:1) on a nylon membrane. At the end of the experiment, the tissue was fixed
in formalin for 20 h and then transferred to ethanol before paraffin embedding for
immunohistochemistry.
Statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics were reported as mean ± SEM for
continuous variables and Student’s t-test was used where applicable. In case of
more than two groups, ANOVA method was used. Appropriate nonparametric
tests were used to analyse various datasets, which included Mann–Whitney U test
and Holm–Sidak method. P-value of 0.05 or less was considered significant.
*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
