ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite availability of advanced imaging, distinguishing radiation necrosis from recurrent brain tumors
noninvasively is a big challenge in neuro-oncology. Our aim was to determine the feasibility of radiomic (computer-extracted texture)
features in differentiating radiation necrosis from recurrent brain tumors on routine MR imaging (gadolinium T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of brain tumor MR imaging performed 9 months (or later) post-radiochemotherapy
was performed from 2 institutions. Fifty-eight patient studies were analyzed, consisting of a training (n � 43) cohort from one institution
and an independent test (n � 15) cohort from another, with surgical histologic findings confirmed by an experienced neuropathologist at
the respective institutions. Brain lesions on MR imaging were manually annotated by an expert neuroradiologist. A set of radiomic features
was extracted for every lesion on each MR imaging sequence: gadolinium T1WI, T2WI, and FLAIR. Feature selection was used to identify the
top 5 most discriminating features for every MR imaging sequence on the training cohort. These features were then evaluated on the test
cohort by a support vector machine classifier. The classification performance was compared against diagnostic reads by 2 expert neuro-
radiologists who had access to the same MR imaging sequences (gadolinium T1WI, T2WI, and FLAIR) as the classifier.
RESULTS: On the training cohort, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was highest for FLAIR with 0.79; 95% CI,
0.77–0.81 for primary (n � 22); and 0.79, 95% CI, 0.75–0.83 for metastatic subgroups (n � 21). Of the 15 studies in the holdout cohort, the
support vector machine classifier identified 12 of 15 studies correctly, while neuroradiologist 1 diagnosed 7 of 15 and neuroradiologist 2
diagnosed 8 of 15 studies correctly, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that radiomic features may provide complementary diagnostic information on routine
MR imaging sequences that may improve the distinction of radiation necrosis from recurrence for both primary and metastatic brain
tumors.

reatment of malignant brain tumors involves a combined ap-
proach of surgical resection, radiation therapy (RT), and, de-
pending on the histology, chemotherapy. Cerebral radiation ne-
crosis (RN) is often an unavoidable complication of high-dose
focal RT that typically manifests 6–9 months post-RT and mimics
the symptoms and MR imaging appearance of tumor recurrence,
in both primary and metastatic brain tumor cases.1 RN and tumor
recurrence have substantially different treatment regimens and
need to be identified expediently for determining prognosis, guid-
ing subsequent therapy, and improving patient outcome.

posttreatment evaluation of patients with brain tumor. The Re-

 sponse Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO; http://radiopaedia.
org/articles/rano-criteria-for-glioblastoma) criteria recommend
using 2D measurements (diameter) of contrast enhancement on
posttreatment gadolinium-enhanced (Gd) T1-weighted MR im-
aging (with respect to pretreatment MR imaging) as the funda-
mentally quantifiable imaging criteria for assessment of response
to treatment. However, due to a similar appearance on follow-up
posttreatment Gd-T1WI MR imaging, differentiating RN and tu-
mor recurrence by using 2D measurements of contrast enhance-
ment (as manually identified by an expert) is clinically extremely
challenging.5 Recent studies have shown promise in using semi-
quantitative MR imaging measures such as apparent diffusion
coefficient ratios6; choline, creatine, and N-acetylaspartate ratios
from MR spectroscopy7; and perfusion imaging6 for differentiat-
ing RN from tumor recurrence. These techniques, however, may
not be universally available, are often difficult to reproduce, and
tend to increase the overall cost of the imaging examination.
Hence, there is a need for identification of reliable noninvasive
quantitative measurements on routinely acquired brain MR im-
aging (Gd-T1WI, T2WI, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery)
that can accurately distinguish RN from tumor recurrence.
The physiologic pathways leading to the development of RN
and brain tumor recurrence are fundamentally different. Thus,
there may be subtle variances in the morphologic appearance of
the 2 conditions reflected as differences in the microarchitectural
texture appearance embedded across Gd-T1WI, T2WI, and
FLAIR, which might enable discrimination of RN from recurrent
tumors.8 Radiomic or computer-extracted texture features allow
capture of higher order quantitative measurements (eg, co-occur-
rence matrix homogeneity, neighboring gray-level dependence
matrix, multiscale Gaussian derivatives) for modeling macro- and
microscale morphologic attributes within the lesion area for every
MR imaging protocol. Some of these radiomic features may not
be visually appreciable by a radiologist but may complement their
ability to make a more reliable diagnosis of the disease. Of late,
there has been interest in the use of radiomic features computed
from treatment-naïve MR imaging to distinguish patients with
glioblastoma with long-term and short-term survival.9 Relatively
little work, however, has focused on the use of radiomic analysis
for distinguishing radiation necrosis from brain tumor recur-
rence on MR imaging.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of ra-
diomic analysis on routine MR imaging sequences in identifying
computer-extracted texture differences between RN and tumor
recurrence that may not be visually appreciable on conventional
MR imaging and to distinguish RN and recurrent cancer across
primary and metastatic brain tumor studies. In this study, we
identified a set of radiomic features that best distinguished RN
from tumor recurrence on a training cohort across 3 routine mul-
tiparametric MR images (Gd-T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR). We then
evaluated the validity of these radiomic features on a small hold-
out cohort and performed a head-to-head comparison of their
performance against independent diagnostic reads by 2 expert
neuroradiologists who were presented with the same routine MR
imaging sequences as the classifier (Gd-T1WI, T2WI, and
FLAIR). The ultimate goal of this work was to develop noninva-
sive techniques that can be used in conjunction with routine MR
imaging protocols to complement a radiologist’s diagnosis of RN
versus tumor recurrence for improving patient management both
for primary and metastatic brain tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The study population consisted of independent training and test
cohorts obtained from the local (University Hospitals Case Med-
ical Center) and the collaborating (University of Texas South-
western Medical Center) institution and acquired for this institu-
tional review board–approved and Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act–compliant study. The 2 patient cohorts
were identified by performing a retrospective review of neuropa-
thology in all patients with brain tumor who underwent an oper-
ation for a recurrent or progressive Gd T1WI-enhancing lesion
identified during follow-up at 9 months (or later) after the initial
brain RT. Follow-up MR imaging scans within 0–21 days before
the second resection or biopsy (for disease confirmation) were
used for analysis. Inclusion criteria were that the pathology spec-
imen be obtained by resection (preferably) or by multiple biopsies
(�2) via stereotactic guidance. Single biopsies were not allowed
because of the potential for sampling error. Histology was re-
reviewed by a neuropathologist (M.C. at the local and K.J.H. at the
collaborating institution) blinded to the original diagnosis and
type of RT, to quantify the percentage of RN and recurrent
tumors.
To avoid any training errors due to “mixed” pathologies on
the same lesion, for the training cohort, we strictly defined the
presence of RN as �80% RN and of recurrent tumor as �80%
recurrent tumor (other “mixed” cases with varying proportions
of RN and tumor recurrence were excluded). We identified 43
cases at the local institution from 2006 to 2014 that followed this
strict inclusion criterion, consisting of 22 primary tumors (12
with recurrent tumor, 10 with RN) and 21 metastatic tumors (12
with recurrent tumor, 9 with RN). The test cohort consisted of 15
studies, 11 primary and 4 metastatic cases of patients who under-
went an operation between 2009 and 2015 and were pathologi-
cally confirmed with either “predominant” or a mixture of RN
and tumor recurrence in varying proportions on the same lesion
as confirmed by pathology. Gd-T1WI scans were available for 10
of 15 studies; T2WI scans, for 7 of 15 studies; and FLAIR, for all 15
studies respectively. Table 1 shows the summary of the study pop-
ulation. The details on MR imaging protocol acquisition and pre-
processing steps are provided in the On-line Appendix.

 quence by an experienced radiologist (L.W.) with a hand-anno-
tation tool in 3D Slicer (http://www.slicer.org). To assess the vari-
ability in features due to segmentation, we also segmented the
ROI containing the lesion for every image with an automated
brain tumor segmentation tool, BraTumIA (http://istb-software.
unibe.ch/bratumia/MIA/BraTumIA.html).10 The degree of over-
lap, computed as Dice Index, across manual and automated seg-
mentation was recorded, and the variability of texture features
across manual and automated segmentation was reported as box-
plots (On-line Fig 1).
Radiomic Texture Features
A total of 119 2D radiomic texture features on a per-voxel basis
were extracted from every expert-annotated lesion on contiguous
sections of a patient study. For every patient study, a median fea-
ture value was calculated from the feature responses of all voxels
from across all sections associated with each annotated lesion. All
feature calculations were performed by using in-house software
implemented in the Matlab R 2014b platform (MathWorks,
Natick, Massachusetts). A total of 13 Haralick, 25 Laws, 24 Lapla-
cian pyramid features, and 20 Histogram of Gradient orientations
features were computed in Matlab. A detailed description of a few
representative radiomic features is provided in On-line Table 1.
Feature Selection and Classification on the Training
Cohort
To identify the most discriminating radiomic features across each
of the MR imaging sequences on the training cohort, we used
minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (mRmR)11 fea-
ture-selection analysis in a sequential feed-forward fashion by us-
ing a Matlab R 2014b platform.12 The sequential feed-forward
algorithm is a bottom-up search approach, which starts from an
empty feature set and gradually adds features selected via mRmR
so that redundant features are removed while maximizing dis-
crimination between the 2 classes (RN and tumor recurrence).
Feed-forward mRmR feature selection was used in combination
with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier,13 and the perfor-
mance metric was an area under the receiver operating character-
istic curve (AUC). In our setup, we chose the top 5 most discrim-
inative features from mRmR for each classification task (RN
versus tumor recurrence in primary and metastatic subgroups,
respectively). Inclusion of �5 features did not improve the AUC
of the classifier within the training set. Hence, we limited inclu-
sion of features to the classifier to just the top 5. To mitigate
selection and classifier training bias, we used a 3-fold (1-fold held
out for testing), patient-stratified, cross-validation scheme, which
was repeated 100 times. The best 5 features were identified as the
ones that most frequently appeared in the set of the top 5 most
discriminative features across 100 runs of 3-fold cross-validation.
The analysis was performed independently for every MR imaging
sequence.
Classification on the Test Cohort
The independent test cohort was evaluated within an SVM classi-
fier by using the top 5 most discriminatory features identified
during training, with evaluation being performed separately for
the primary and metastatic subgroups. The radiomics classifier
output was obtained as a binary output in which an output of 1
represented tumor recurrence and zero represented RN for each
of the studies in the test cohort. In cases in which �1 MR imaging
sequence was available, a consensus (agreement of outcome in 2
of 2 or 2 of 3 sequences) across the binary classifier outputs was
used as the final outcome of the radiomics classifier. For cases in
which 2 sequences showed disagreement in diagnosis, the output
of the sequence, identified as the most discriminating within the
training cohort, was used to make the final decision. The final
radiomics classifier output for every patient study was compared
against the histopathologic findings to report the accuracy values.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by using a nonparametric
Wilcoxon signed ranked test while comparing the differences in
feature values across different feature sets for every MR imaging
sequence for both the primary and metastatic cohorts indepen-
dently. To further make the statistical significance test more strin-
gent, the P value was appropriately adjusted at P � .00125 with a
Bonferroni test to account for type I errors. All statistical analyses
were implemented in the Matlab R2014b platform (MathWorks).
All reported confidence intervals are over 95% confidence
intervals.
Comparative Multireader Study
Two board-certified neuroradiologists with 2 years of experience
(A.P.N., A.G), blinded to the pathology reports, read the MR im-
ages (Gd-T1WI, T2WI, and FLAIR, as available) to diagnose the
presence of RN or tumor recurrence on each of the holdout stud-
ies. The same sequence scans exposed to the SVM classifier were
provided to the expert readers to avoid any comparison bias. Nei-
ther the machine-learning classifier nor the readers had access to
the baseline, pretreatment scan. The only additional information
to which the expert readers had access was the type of tumor (ie,
oligodendroglioma, glioblastoma) for the primary brain tumor
cohort and the location of primary disease for the metastatic brain
tumor cohort. No additional clinical information (ie, age, sex,
Karnofsky performance score) was provided. The readers were
allowed to go back to the scans multiple times as required to make
their final diagnosis. Both readers independently assigned a prob-
ability score (between 0.5 and 1 in increments of 0.1) for every
study as belonging to either RN or tumor recurrence based on the
confidence in their diagnostic call. A confidence of 0.5 denotes
that the expert was uncertain of the diagnosis while a confidence
of 1 denotes that the expert was completely confident in his or her
diagnosis of RN or tumor recurrence. The probability scores and
the resulting diagnosis for every threshold value for every study
for the 2 experts are provided in On-line Table 3.

 obtained by using mRmR for the primary brain tumor cohort are
shown in On-line Table 2 and qualitatively represented in Fig 1.
The average feature values for all 3 of the most discriminative
features in the primary cohort were found to be statistically sig-
nificantly different across RN and tumor recurrence (P � .001).
Correlation, energy, and Laws features (combination of level and
edge filters [L5E5]) in the lower Laplacian scale space were con-
sistently identified as the most discriminative ones in distinguish-
ing the 2 classes across all 3 sequences.
The best performing feature sets in distinguishing RN and
tumor recurrence were obtained for FLAIR, with reported AUC
and accuracy values of 0.79 � 0.05; 95% confidence interval,
0.77–0.81; and 0.75 � 0.05; 95% CI, 0.73–0.77. This was followed
by the feature set for T2WI with reported AUC and accuracy
values of 0.77 � 0.06; 95% CI, 0.74–0.80; and 0.72 � 0.08; 95%
CI, 0.69–0.75, respectively. Notably, Gd-T1-weighted MR imag-
ing, a routinely used sequence in the clinic for response assess-
ment, was ranked lowest in terms of accuracy (0.57 � 0.07) and
AUC (0.57 � 0.08) across all 3 sequences for the primary brain
tumor cohort.
Classification of the Independent Test Cohort. The accuracy of
the classifier and the 2 expert readers for the holdout studies, both
for primary and metastatic cases, are reported in Table 2. On-line
Table 3 shows the results of the SVM classifier obtained on the test
cohort by using the top 5 features identified via the mRmR fea-
ture-selection method. On the basis of the output of the classifier
trained either on the FLAIR sequence alone (identified as best
performing sequence on the training cohort) or by using the high-
est consensus (agreement in 2 of 2 or 2 of 3 sequences), 10 of 11
studies were correctly classified. For a threshold of �0.5 in their
confidence scores, radiologist 1 diagnosed 4 of 11 cases correctly
and was unsure about 1 (study 10) (confidence score � 0.5), while
radiologist 2 correctly identified 6 of the 11 cases. The overall
accuracy for radiologist 1 was 54%, while for radiologist 2, it was
36%. One of the patient studies (study 7) comprised a “mixed”
distribution of pathologies with 75% of RN and 25% of the tissue
composing tumor recurrence. However, the patient was clinically
treated as a case of recurrence leading to surgical resection; hence,
the final diagnosis was a recurrence. Study 4 on the pathology
report was identified as having equal (30%) proportions of RN

RN versus Recurrent Tumors in Metastatic Brain Tumor
Subgroup
Feature Discovery and Classification on the Training Cohort. The
top-ranked features in distinguishing RN and tumor recurrence
as obtained from the mRmR feature-selection experiment for the
metastatic brain tumor cohort are shown in On-line Tables 2 and
3. Difference variance (in the Laplacian pyramid domain), sum
average (in Laplacian pyramid domain), correlation, and correla-
tion (in Laplacian pyramid domain), along with Laws features,
were consistently identified as key discriminative features across
the 3 sequences. Several features were consistently identified as
discriminative of RN and tumor recurrence across the 3 MR im-
aging sequences in both the primary and metastatic brain tumor
cohorts. Unlike the primary brain tumor cohort, the P values for
the 3 most discriminating feature sets obtained for the meta-
static cohort were not found to be statistically significantly
different between RN and tumor recurrence.
The 5 most discriminating features (identified via mRmR on
the training cohort) for Gd-T1WI, T2WI, and FLAIR for the met-
astatic brain tumor cohort are listed in On-line Table 2. Similar to
the primary brain tumor cohort, the most discriminative feature
set was obtained for FLAIR with AUC and accuracy values of
0.79 � 0.09; 95% CI, 0.75–0.83; and 0.75 � 0.06; 95% CI, 0.72–
0.78, respectively. This was followed by features extracted from
the Gd-T1 sequence, which had AUC and accuracy values of
0.69 � 0.08; 95% CI, 0.66–0.72; and 0.64 � 0.07; 95% CI, 0.61–
0.67, respectively. While Gd-T1 MR imaging was ranked lowest in
terms of accuracy and AUC for the primary brain tumor cohort,
T2-weighted MR imaging was identified as the sequence with the
lowest accuracy and AUC in distinguishing the 2 classes in the
metastatic brain tumor subgroup.
Classification of the Independent Holdout Cohort. As shown in
On-line Table 3, 2 of 4 metastatic brain tumor recurrence cases
(cases 2 and 3) in the holdout cohort were correctly identified by
the SVM classifier (Table 2). Both neuroradiologists correctly and
consistently identified 2 of the 4 cases (cases 1 and 3). Case 4 was
incorrectly classified by the SVM classifier and the 2 expert
readers.
DISCUSSION
Differentiating RN from recurrent brain tumors is one of the
most challenging clinical dilemmas in neuro-oncology due to the
similar appearance of the 2 conditions on standard MR imaging.
In this study, we investigated the feasibility of computerized tex-
ture features in distinguishing RN and tumor recurrence on Gd-
T1WI, T2WI, and FLAIR across primary and metastatic brain
tumor subgroups in a limited cohort of studies obtained from 2
different institutions.
A strength of this study is that the definition of RN versus
recurrent tumor for our training cohort was stricter than that in
many previously reported imaging studies, which have defined
RN and recurrence on the basis of the suspicion of the disease on
follow-up MRIs (with no histopathology confirmation).6,14 To
evaluate the performance of our classifier across routinely seen
clinical MR imaging studies, we allowed both mixed and predom-
inant RN/tumor recurrence cases to be included within our hold-
out test cohort obtained from another institution (University of
Texas Medical Center). The holdout test cohort was also indepen-
dently analyzed by 2 expert readers who were blinded to the pa-
thology reports and clinical findings. The visual traits for tumor
recurrence that the 2 expert neuro-radiologists took into account
while making the diagnosis included expansile lesion; solid, nod-
ular, or ringlike well-defined enhancements; and internal hemor-
rhages (in primary tumors). Similarly, the experts identified
feathery, geographic, and incomplete enhancements usually asso-
ciated with predominantly radiation-induced effects.
Our study identified Laplacian pyramid texture features as
being discriminative, possibly because this class of features em-
phasizes edge-related differences between RT and RN at lower
resolutions. Similar to the visual features reported by our expert
readers, Reddy et al15 have previously reported meshlike diffuse
enhancement and rim enhancement with feathery indistinct
margins as characteristic of RN. Similarly, tumor recurrence is
reported to have focal solid nodules and solid uniform enhance-
ment with distinct margins.15 Similarly, Laws features, which en-
able capture of a combination of different edge, level, and spot
patterns within the lesion, were identified as being discriminative
possibly because they implicitly model the so-called soap bubble
and Swiss cheese patterns that have previously been suggested as
associated with RN on Gd-T1WI. Additionally, it has been sug-
gested that RN is associated with a diffuse pattern characterized by
periventricular white matter changes,2 while tumor recurrence
has been suggested to be associated with hyper-/hypointensities
indicative of hemorrhagic changes on Gd-T1WI, T2WI, and
FLAIR MR imaging. Haralick texture features modeled on co-
occurring intensity patterns and higher order image derivatives
may be capturing these hemorrhagic changes on FLAIR and
T2WI sequences.
Of the 3 MR imaging sequences (Gd-T1WI, T2WI, and
FLAIR), FLAIR was identified as the most discriminative in the
training cohort in terms of AUC and accuracy for both primary
and metastatic brain tumor cohorts. FLAIR is highly sensitive, but
not specific, for identifying coexisting tumor and edema.16 In
cases of invasive primary brain tumors, malignant tumor cells
have been found up to 4 cm away from contrast-enhancing re-
gions,17 with �90% of the cases of recurrence occurring close to
the tumor margin. Future studies could address the role of ra-
diomic features obtained from peritumoral edema as comple-
mentary measurements to further improve the diagnosis of RN
from tumor recurrence noninvasively.
A recent study14 used Haralick and wavelet texture features on
Gd-T1-weighted MR imaging to distinguish RN from metastatic
brain tumor recurrence with a reported AUC of 94%. However,
we believe that the results, reported on a per-section basis, may
have been affected by the classifier being contaminated by sec-
tions from the same patient being used both in the training and
testing sets during classification. Additionally, in most cases, the
clinical diagnosis was assessed by clinical and radiologic follow-up
(as opposed to a more reliable histologic confirmation).
Our study did have its limitations. As a feasibility study, the

 reported results are preliminary because our study was limited by
a relatively small sample size, both for the training and holdout
cohorts. However, to the extent possible, a rigorous statistical
analysis was performed to evaluate the classification results. Al-
though the different image preprocessing steps performed did not
explicitly account for varying signal-to-noise ratios due to differ-
ent magnetic fields, this effect was largely mitigated because all the
computerized image-based features were derived from cumula-
tive statistics (median) of many pixels. The comparison between
expert readers and the radiomics classifier was kept unbiased to
the extent possible by ensuring that the expert readers were pro-
vided the same routine scans that were available to the classifier.
However, the 2 expert readers who performed the analysis had
only 2 years of experience as board-certified neuroradiologists.
Additionally, the readers did not have access to all 3 sequences in
some cases (due to those sequences not being available). While we
attempted to control for heterogeneity in patient studies by sepa-
rately assessing primary and metastatic tumor cohorts, a larger
dataset is required to identify the influence of other variables on
feature selection, such as treatment type and dose.
CONCLUSIONS
In this feasibility study, we investigated the role of texture features
in distinguishing radiation necrosis from recurrent brain tumors
on Gd-T1WI, T2WI, and FLAIR sequences obtained from 2 dif-
ferent sites, across 2 subgroups of studies, primary and metastatic
brain tumors. Our results suggest that radiomic analysis on rou-
tinely acquired MR imaging might enable discrimination of RN
and tumor recurrence both for primary and metastatic brain tu-
mors. Future work will focus on exploring the added value of
texture features along with the diagnostic reads from expert
radiologists as a part of a prospective clinical study. We will also
prospectively validate the features identified in this study on a
larger, multi-institutional cohort, in the context of differentiating
both pseudoprogression and radiation necrosis from tumor
recurrence.
