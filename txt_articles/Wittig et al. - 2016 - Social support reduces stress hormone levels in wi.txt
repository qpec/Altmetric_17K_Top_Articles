Stress is a major cause of poor health and mortality in humans and other social mammals.
Close social bonds buffer stress, however much of the underlying physiological mechanism
remains unknown. Here, we test two key hypotheses: bond partner effects occur only during
stress (social buffering) or generally throughout daily life (main effects). We assess urinary
glucocorticoids (uGC) in wild chimpanzees, with or without their bond partners, after a
natural stressor, resting or everyday affiliation. Chimpanzees in the presence of, or interacting
with, bond partners rather than others have lowered uGC levels across all three contexts.
These results support the main effects hypothesis and indicate that hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenocortical (HPA) axis regulation is mediated by daily engagement with bond partners
both within and out of stressful contexts. Regular social support with bond partners could
lead to better health through daily ‘micro-management’ of the HPA axis, a finding with
potential medical implications for humans.

 F
or animals, including humans, there is much evidence that
individuals who maintain stable, close social bonds have
greater reproductive success, increased longevity and better
health compared with those who do not1–5. A key mechanism
through which these benefits could operate is through social
buffering, in which social support provided by bond partners
cushions the aversive effects of stressful events through mediation
of
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical
(HPA)
axis6–9.
In particular, the presence of bond partners during a stressful
event can result in lower glucocorticoid (GC) levels7–10 or
help to reduce them sooner after the event, compared with when
bond partners are not available11–13.
Alternatively, bond partners may have a more generalized
positive effect, insofar as subjects can rely on general social
support beyond periods of acute stress. General social support
may create more predictability within social interactions and
more stability in the social environment6,14. This main effects
hypothesis6 is less examined in non-human animals, despite its
potential implications for promoting health and longevity6,14,15.
Although there is some empirical support for this hypothesis in
humans15–17, the underlying mechanism that enables such a
main effect is unknown. Some studies suggest main effects may
also be mediated by the HPA axis6, or by other mechanisms14,17.
Physically
and
psychologically-induced
stress
can
cause
dysregulation of the HPA axis, provided the stress is repeatedly
acute18 or chronic19. This dysregulation can lead to severe health
problems8,20, suggesting that any mechanisms that moderate such
aversive effects will be under positive selection. Social buffering
during stress exposure shows regulatory, stabilizing effects on
HPA activity7,8, but it is equally possible that the same effect is
also caused by everyday affiliations between individuals that
predictably offer social support to one another.
While the main effects hypothesis predicts HPA regulatory
effects of social partners in both stressful and non-stressful
situations, the social buffering hypothesis excludes HPA axis
regulation outside of stressful events. To test between these two
hypotheses and to investigate their predicted impact on HPA axis
activity, we monitored subjects’ urinary glucocorticoid (uGC)
levels in reaction to acute stressors, everyday affiliations and
resting. Since general social support is usually measured as social
integration in the community6,14 or as the presence of reliable
supporters7,11–13, we contrasted subjects’ uGC levels in the three
contexts depending on the participation or presence of a bond
partner, who by definition provides predictable support.
The impact of social support on stress and health is often
posited as a causative relationship; however, whether social
relationships promote lower stress and better health or rather
whether healthier and less stressed individuals are better able to
maintain relationships is not well established, given that most
studies are correlational21. To address this issue, we used a within-
subjects design, so that the same individuals were tested in each
condition and we compared changes in uGC levels due to events.
Another unresolved issue is whether only active support
(instrumental help)6,17 mediates HPA axis activity, or whether
the mere presence of a bond partner (social companionship)6,17 is
enough to do so. Also, it remains unclear whether perceived or
actual support is more beneficial14,17,22, or whether predictability
of support is a key component for stress regulation15,23.
Chimpanzees are a good model species for exploring these
issues. They have highly differentiated relationships with group
members, with individuals maintaining close social bonds with
one or several other group members24. Close social bonds are
defined as high rates of consistent mutual cooperative and
affiliative
behaviours
(grooming,
coalitionary
support
and
food sharing) between two individuals, which are maintained
over several months or years. Bond partners, thus by definition
provide predictable social support24,25. Here, we compared
the effects of partners with predictable support patterns (bond
partners) with those of unpredictable support patterns (non-bond
partners) on uGC levels.
In contrast to previous correlational studies, where GC measures
were typically averaged over extended time periods, which
included a multitude of stressful events9–11,23, we used an event
sampling approach measuring uGC levels that corresponded to a
single event26. Applying a fixed latency for clearance of GCs into
urine26,27, we created relative uGC levels by dividing uGC levels
relating to the event by uGC levels relating to before the event.
Events were stressors (intergroup encounters), everyday affiliations
(grooming) or control periods (resting without social interaction).
Intergroup encounters are highly stressful events, associated
with high GC levels28, in which chimpanzees face potentially
lethal aggression when they encounter rival groups29–31, but
they can also involve social support. A key factor in winning inter-
group encounters is to out-number rivals31,32 through coordinated
attacks
involving
coalitionary
support
against
rivals33,34.
Coalitionary and social support rather than retreat (defection)
from
group
members
is
crucial
to
rout
rivals
in
direct
confrontations29,32. Thus, we noted the occurrence of social
support during intergroup encounters, only when individuals
joined in vocal or physical aggression against rivals.
To test the social buffering hypothesis6–8 in wild chimpanzees
using a within-subjects design, we predict the following: if social
support in chimpanzees is effective during stressors, we expected
the Relationship Quality of the participants to impact on urinary
glucocorticoid (uGC) levels only when experiencing a stressor.
Specifically, we predicted an interaction between Event (intergroup
encounter, resting, grooming) and Relationship Quality (bond,
non-bond) such that uGC levels would be reduced during stressors
(intergroup encounters) but not during resting or everyday
affiliations (grooming), when bond partners rather than other
individuals participated.
To test the main effects hypothesis6,14, we predicted the
following: if social support impacts on uGC levels during
everyday affiliation (grooming), resting and during a stressor
(intergroup encounters), we expected the Relationship Quality of
participants to impact on uGC levels irrespective of context, such
that GC levels would be reduced by bond partners rather than
other individuals across contexts. In addition, we predicted no
interaction effects between Event and Relationship Quality.
We tested the social buffering and main effects hypotheses by
comparing uGC levels in wild chimpanzees associated with
three events: potentially life-threatening stressors (intergroup
encounters29,31), everyday affiliations (social grooming11,23) and
control periods (resting). We show that chimpanzees have
reduced uGC levels when they are together with bond partners
rather than other chimpanzees, irrespective of context. Further
analyses revealed that the ameliorative effects of bond partners
were most pronounced during contexts requiring active support
rather than the passive presence of bond partners, with the largest
effects during stressors then grooming contexts, and least so
during resting contexts. Our results indicate that the predictable
social support of bond partners may help to micro-manage HPA
axis
activity,
during
both
stressful
and
everyday
events,
supporting the main effects hypothesis.
Results
Stressful events and everyday affiliation predict uGC levels. We
first tested if relative uGC levels were influenced by Event
(intergroup encounters, resting, grooming). To control for
physical exertion, security in numbers and sex effects, we added

 Sex as control predictors. Given that subjects were sampled more
than once and sometimes from the same Event, we added Subject
ID and Event ID as random effects (Table 1: General Model).
Both Event and Event Duration significantly affected uGC levels
(likelihood ratio test: df ¼ 2, w2 ¼ 7.98 and P ¼ 0.019), but the
interaction of Event and Event Duration was not significant, and
therefore removed (Wald test: df ¼ 2, w2 ¼ 5.21, P ¼ 0.074,
Supplementary Table 1). Intergroup encounters resulted in
higher relative uGC levels than grooming or resting events
(Fig. 1; Table 1: General Model) and longer events resulted in
higher relative uGC levels (Supplementary Fig. 1), while Number
of Chimpanzees Present and Subject’s Sex did not significantly
influence uGC levels. The effect size of the fixed effects in model 1
was R2 ¼ 0.170.
Social buffering and main effects hypotheses. In the second
model we investigated whether the social buffering or main effects
hypotheses were best supported by the data. We tested if relative
uGC levels were affected by the interaction of predictors
Event and Relationship Quality (bond versus non-bond partners),
while controlling for the Sex and Kin (close maternal kin)
relationships of the two participants, and including Subject ID
and Event ID as random factors. Although the full model was
significantly different from the null model (likelihood ratio test:
df ¼ 5, w2 ¼ 13.93, P ¼ 0.016), we neither found a significant
interaction between Event and Relationship Quality on uGC
levels, nor between Subject’s Sex and Partner’s Sex (Table 2a:
Social Buffering Model, Fig. 2).
After removing both non-significant interactions from the
model, both test predictors (Event and Relationship Quality)
significantly influenced relative uGC levels (Table 2b: Main
Effects Model, Fig. 2). Specifically, relative uGC levels were on
average almost 22% higher after intergroup encounters than after
grooming events and on average 48% higher after resting than
grooming events. In addition, subjects participating in events with
bond partners rather than other individuals had on average 23%
lower relative uGC levels, across events (Table 2b: Main Effects
Model). Neither Kin nor Sex of subject showed a significant
influence on relative uGC levels, while the relative uGC levels
varied depending on the Sex of Partner, with subjects of male
partners having higher relative uGC levels. The effect size of the
fixed effects in model 2 was R2 ¼ 0.196.
Extent of bond partner impact on uGC levels. Engaging with
bond partners lowered relative uGC levels across all events,
although to determine the extent of bond partner impact within
contexts requires further testing. Therefore, using bootstrapping,
we tested whether chimpanzees’ relative uGC levels within each
context
were
significantly
higher
or
lower
than
expected
levels. We calculated the expected relative uGC level by
estimating the diurnal decline in uGC levels (Supplementary
Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 2). The results of the bootsrap
procedure showed that grooming with a bond partner decreased

CI ¼ ( � 6.4, 9.5), N ¼ 11) and engaging in intergroup encounters
with
a

partner
(bootstrap:
mean
deviation±SE ¼
� 0.5±9.0, CI ¼ ( � 17.8; 16.5), N ¼ 8), confidence intervals
included 0 and therefore were not different from expected relative
uGC levels. Finally, relative uGC levels after resting with a bond
partner did not differ from expected values (bootstrap: mean
deviation±SE ¼ � 2.5±5.5, CI ¼ ( � 13.3; 7.0), N ¼ 13), but
resting without bond partners had an insufficient sample size to
be tested (N ¼ 5).
Discussion
Within each event, subjects’ relative urinary glucocorticoid levels
were lower when engaging with bond partners rather than other
individuals, whether during a stressor (intergroup encounters),
everyday affiliation (grooming) or resting. Bond partner effects,

 however, were strongest during intergroup encounters, then
during grooming and least during resting. The social buffering
hypothesis predicts bond partner effects during stressors only,
whilst the main effects hypothesis expects bond partner effects
during both stressors and everyday events. Thus, our results show
support for the main effects rather than the social buffering
hypothesis (see Fig. 2 in ref. 6).
Chimpanzees showed significantly higher relative uGC levels
after stressful events (intergroup encounters) compared with after
resting. However, uGC elevation was evident only when bond
partners did not participate in the encounter. The same
chimpanzees
facing
potentially
life-threatening
intergroup
encounters together with a bond partner did not have elevated
uGC levels. This result demonstrates that the participation of a
bond partner, who by definition provides predictable social
support, regulates HPA activity and buffers the stress reaction
even in potentially lethal situations. Less predictable supporters
were less effective in buffering uGC levels. Our results showing
buffering effects of bond partners on HPA axis activity concur
with experimental studies in humans12,13, where bond partners
buffer psychologically-induced stress, and studies examining
naturally occurring social stressors in non-human primates9–11.
In the non-human primate studies, correlations show that bond
partners seem to buffer baseline GC levels following severe social
stressors, such as, the threat of infanticide11, sudden social
isolation10 and during milder social stressors, such as conspecific
aggression9.
Chimpanzees showed lower relative uGC levels during every-
day affiliative interactions (grooming events) compared with
resting events. However, uGC levels decreased only when
chimpanzees groomed with a bond partner. In contrast, subjects
grooming with a non-bond partner showed uGC levels similar to
resting control samples. This shows that bond partners have
moderating effects on HPA activity during everyday grooming
events, outside of stressor contexts. A correlational study on wild
baboons is also suggestive of this pattern, where female baboons
during periods of social stability had lower baseline GC levels
when they were able to focus their grooming on a few preferred
individuals rather than showing more distributed grooming
patterns23. In both stressful and grooming contexts, our results
indicate a positive relationship between predictable social support
objectively measured from social interaction histories and the
stress buffering potential of supporters.
Model 2 suggests that bond partner effects on uGC levels were
also evident during resting events. This result, however, has to be
treated with caution, since sample size for resting without
bond-partners is low which leads to instability problems.
Nevertheless, the result is interesting since experimental studies
with humans usually do not distinguish between social support

 due to the mere presence of bond partners12, and active support
offered by bond partners13. In our study, although the effect is the
same, the estimates due to bond partners are different (Fig. 2),
increasing from resting to grooming to intergroup contexts. This
finding indicates that active support from bond partners is more
effective in lowering uGC levels than is their mere presence.
Everyday affiliative interactions with bond partners have been
predicted to improve physical and mental health, although the
mechanism through which the benefits might be accrued has
remained evasive14,16. Cohen and Wills6 suggested that benefits
might be mediated through similar mechanisms as social
buffering effects, specifically involving the HPA axis. Our
results suggest that this is indeed the case: engaging in three
types of activity with predictable bond partners lowered subjects’
uGC levels, whether during highly stressful interactions, resting
or everyday affiliative interactions.
Given that both male and female subjects participate in
grooming and intergroup encounters34 (and this study), we
contrasted the relative uGC levels of both female and male
subjects, as well as the sex combination of the dyad. Neither
subjects’ sex nor the sex combination of the dyad influenced
relative uGC levels in any model. Thus, for both male and female
chimpanzees, the impact of participating in stressors or everyday
affiliations with a predictable partner of either sex, compared with
another individual, similarly regulates the HPA axis. This result is
not unexpected, even in intergroup encounters, where both males
and females participate. Females engage often in vocal aggression34
(Supplementary Movie 1), which is highly effective in deterring
within-group24, as well as out-group members34,35. Both sexes can
incur high costs from attacking or being attacked (injury or
death)31,36,37. However, it is likely that males do not gain
comparable vocal or physical support from females as they do
from males, and we cannot rule out that a larger sample may show
some sex effects. It should be noted that in this data set, all mixed-
sex bond partner dyads consisted of mothers and their sons.
For grooming events, the uGC patterns mirror urinary
oxytocin levels found after grooming in the same chimpanzee
population38. In this previous study, grooming with a bond
partner was associated with higher urinary oxytocin levels
compared with grooming with a non-bond partner or periods
of resting, independent of whether subjects were giving or
receiving grooming. These contrasting GC and oxytocin results
are similar to those of two social buffering experiments exposing
humans to a psychological stressor. In trials in which social
support was offered from a bond partner, subjects had earlier
decreasing GC levels. One study showed lower GC levels and
returned faster to baseline in conditions in which urinary
oxytocin levels increased13. The other study showed greatest
GC decreases in trials with both social support by bond partners
and intranasal application of oxytocin before the stressor12. Thus
our observations are in line with the idea that oxytocin has a
dampening role in cortisol secretion7–9. In chimpanzees, active
social
support
from
bond
partners
seems
to
have
more
pronounced effects on urinary oxytocin levels38, as well as on
uGC levels, than the mere presence of bond partners38. Likewise,
it is possible that participating in activities with predictable bond
partners in humans may be more effective in HPA axis
management than either merely associating with bond partners
without active participation, or participation with less predictable
supporters. To date, these conditions have rarely been contrasted
in the human literature12,13. Given that we examined the same
chimpanzees in the same contexts with and without bond partner
participation, and that we measured relative change in uGC levels
after, compared with before, the events, supports a causative effect
between bond partner support and lower HPA axis activity, in
everyday affiliations as well as during stressors. The neuropeptide
oxytocin may be key to the underlying mechanism precipitating
the social regulation of the HPA axis7–9.
Crucially, engaging an oxytocin—HPA axis interaction by
participating with predictable supporters during ordinary everyday
affiliative contexts may help maintain a healthy homoeostasis. We
propose that a possible underlying process could be that daily
affiliative social interactions help regulate—or micromanage—the
HPA axis. This in turn may help to maintain stable immune-
function, cardio-function, fertility, cognition and mood, key
aspects known to be affected by a dysregulated HPA axis8,14,15,39.
The
close
phylogenetic
relationship
between
humans
and
chimpanzees suggests that HPA axis micro-management through
daily affiliative social interactions could also occur in humans.
Bond partner effects were strong such that even during a
potentially life-threatening inter-group encounter, bond partners
buffered the stress response. It could be argued that since the
triggering of the stress response is vital for maximizing the
physical response in a fight situation40, it is not necessarily
adaptive for bond partners to buffer the stress response in fight
contexts. However, bond partners by definition in this study have
a predictable history of providing social and agonistic support to
one another24. Thus, it may be that subjects are indeed safer when
engaging in inter-group encounters when bond partners are also
participating and subjects thus ‘require’ less or shorter HPA axis
activity to ensure survival. This interpretation might offer one
explanation as to why chimpanzees and humans seek bond
partners when initiating conflict with rival groups30,33,36. Another
possible explanation for these results is that our method can only
measure strong changes in relative uGC levels and do not detect
short or minor increases in stress response activity.
In this study, chimpanzees supported by bond partners showed
no significant up-regulation of their HPA axis when participating in
an intense stressor (inter-group encounters), and showed signifi-
cant down-regulation of their HPA axis in everyday affiliations
(grooming) compared with support from other individuals. These
results suggest that bond partners can influence HPA axis activity
both during highly stressful situations, as well as during everyday
activities, such as grooming. The HPA axis is vulnerable to
dysregulation, particularly when exposed to intense or repeated
stressors8,18–20. Such HPA axis dysregulation can have negative and
long-term effects on physical and mental health8,18–20,39,41. Social
buffering may have an immediate effect during a stressor of
reducing HPA axis activity6–8,12,13. However, daily management of
the HPA axis through repeated affiliations from predictable social
supporters may protect against dysregulation of the HPA axis over
the longer term6. The mechanism that might account for
reported effects of better health when engaging in everyday
affiliations with bond partners, has remained elusive6,14,16,17,21.
Here, we demonstrate that, as for stressors, bond partners also
downregulate HPA axis activity even during an everyday affiliation,
grooming and with a weaker effect, by their mere presence when
resting, as proposed by Cohen and Wills’ main effects hypothesis6.
From these results, we hypothesize for future testing that regular
and repeated, everyday affiliations have the potential to regularly
and repeatedly re-align the HPA axis throughout the day. This
could amount to ‘micro-managing’ effects on the regulation of the
HPA axis, resulting in stable HPA activity over time, and providing
long-term benefits to physical and mental health.
Methods
Subjects. We observed chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii,
Supplementary Data 1) of the Sonso community, Budongo Forest (1�350—1�550 N,
31�080—31�420 E), Uganda, from February 2008 to July 2010. The Sonso
community has been continuously observed since 1990 (ref. 42), and was
comprised of 15 males (adults: Z15 years: 10; subadult: 10–14 years: 5), 35 females

 chimpanzees—those that were regularly observed to improve the likelihood of
within-subject sampling across behavioural conditions. Permissions to conduct this
research was granted by Uganda Wildlife Authority (TDO/33/02) and Uganda
National Council for Science and Technology (NS 181) and overseen by Budongo
Conservation Field Station and the University Teaching and Research Ethics
Committee of St Andrews University.
Observation methods. A team of up to six observers followed up to three parties
of chimpanzees (independently moving subgroups of flexible composition) from
B7 a.m. to 5 p.m. through the forest, recording behaviours using ‘all occurrence’
sampling43 for aggressive (agonistic support, contact and non-contact aggression)
and affiliative social interactions (grooming, food sharing, sitting in close proximity
(within 1 m)), and 15 min scan sampling for party composition, where ‘party’ is a
subgroup of individuals in view. In addition, we recorded intergroup encounters
whenever they were observed. We focused on three event types: (1) intergroup
encounters: subjects had auditory or visual contact with a rival community.
Subjects were sampled if classified as engaging in social support of group members,
which required approaching in the direction of the rivals and responding with
chorused (coalitionary) vocal aggressive behaviour (barks, pant roars, buttress
drumming and pant hoots) and/or coalitionary physically aggressive behaviour
(charging, chasing, hitting and biting) towards out-group members. Support was
coded as ‘mutual’ in all cases, given that all receive a benefit from another’s
participation, whether it occurs before or after their own. These intergroup events
were also not characterized by grooming bouts either before, during or after the
intergroup encounters. Since the natural frequency of encounters with the rival
communities was low (nine encounters were sampled during the observation time),
we also conducted four drumming experiments to simulate the presence of a rival
community (see experimental procedure); (2) resting events, in which one
individual had no social interaction for a minimum of one hour and was sitting or
lying for at least the first 30 min; and (3) grooming events, in which two individuals
groomed each other for at least 20 min without a break and had no additional
social interaction for at least 1 h after the beginning of the grooming event.
Grooming duration as well as minutes spent giving, receiving or engaging in both
simultaneously (mutual) were recorded.
Experimental procedure. We waited for a subgroup—or party—of chimpanzees
to rest in the periphery of their territory in an area where we had observed
intergroup encounters during the last year. After resting without vocalising for at
least 10 min, an experienced field assistant mimicked a typical mid-length chim-
panzee buttress tree drum, striking 7 beats with his fists on the buttress roots of a
tree about 100 m away from the resting party in the direction of the rival com-
munity’s territory. Importantly, before and during the drumming simulation, we
took extreme care that Sonso chimpanzees could not see or hear any person
moving in the direction where the drumming experiment would or just had
occurred. In all four trials, the chimpanzees showed behaviour indistinguishable
from natural intergroup encounters (pilo-erection, reassurance behaviours,
cautious and silent approach to the drumming tree followed by aggressive displays,
aggressive vocalizations, like pant-roars and pant-barks and drumming). Eight of
21 intergroup encounter data points were experimentally simulated encounters
(Supplementary Data 1). We found that experimentally simulated intergroup
encounters produced no different reaction in uGC levels than natural encounters
(likelihood ratio test: w2 ¼ 0.869, df ¼ 2, P ¼ 0.648; Supplementary Table 2).
Therefore we merged natural observations and experimental simulations of
intergroup encounters.
Urine collection and hormone data analysis. After observing one of our target
chimpanzees engaging in one of the three events (grooming, resting, intergroup
encounters), we switched to ‘focal animal’ sampling43 of that individual for the next
6 h, collecting every possible urine sample and recording each behaviour and
change in activity (see ref. 26). Urine was either pipetted from plastic bags, after the
bags were tied over a forked stick and held in the urine stream when subjects were
sitting in a tree, or from leaf matter when urination occurred on the ground after
subjects had moved away. After collection, urine samples were stored in a thermos
flask containing ice and were frozen in liquid nitrogen upon arrival in camp, which
was within 10 h after collection. Urine collection did not commence if subjects had
engaged in aggression or grooming within the hour before the activities, and was
aborted if subjects engaged in additional aggression or grooming within two hours
after the activity. We collected a total of N ¼ 574 urine samples from adult
chimpanzees where we were able to determine uGC levels.
We were able to assign N ¼ 394 of these urine samples (nine male and eight
female chimpanzees, Supplementary Data 1) to a single event, either: (1) social
grooming (social support in an everyday context), sustained for 420 min (N ¼ 31
data point including 172 urine samples in 28 events, N ¼ 14 subjects); (2) resting
(no support control), sustained for 430 min (N ¼ 18 data points including 108
urine samples in 18 events, N ¼ 16 subjects); and (3) intergroup encounters (social
support in a stressful context), when chimpanzees saw out-group chimpanzees or
reacted vocally to calls of chimpanzees from real or simulated intergroup
encounters (N ¼ 21 data points from natural encounters including 73 urine
samples in 9 events, N ¼ 7 subjects; and from simulated encounters including 41
urine samples in 4 events, N ¼ 6 subjects). Chimpanzees show intimate reassurance
behaviour after detecting rival groups, including embracing, placing their finger in
others’ mouth, holding others’ testes or grooming (Supplementary Movie 1).
Urinary GC levels were measured at the Behavioural Endocrinology Lab at the
Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology using high-performance
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)44. Samples with a
recovery of the internal standard deviating by o±50% from the expected value
were included in the analysis. In cases of large deviation we re-measured the
samples. If a large deviation persisted, we re-extracted and re-measured the
samples. We excluded samples where the large deviation still persisted.
Examination of LC-MS/MS data was carried out with MassLynx (version 4.1;
QuanLynx-Software). Only a fraction of plasma cortisol can be found in
chimpanzee urine27, while metabolites of cortisol are found in higher quantities44.
To quantify the urinary glucocorticoid excretion (uGC), we used the sum of
urinary cortisol plus four of its metabolites (tetrahydrocortisol,
tetrahydrocortisone, 5b-androstane and 11-oxoetiocholanolon). The sum of uGC
comprised on average 9% cortisol, 37% tetrahydrocortisol, 35% tetrahydrocortison,
5% 5b-androstane and 14% 11- oxoetiocholanolon. We corrected the uGC levels
with the creatinine levels of each sample to control for differences in water content
of urine samples45. We excluded samples with a creatinine level of o0.05 mg
creatinine ml � 1 urine from the analysis.
Using an event-sampling approach26,38,46, we then calculated the relative uGC
levels for each Event, using a method that took the clearance window of cortisol
into urine into account (see Fig. 1 in ref. 26). We defined a pre-period (representing
the uGC levels from before the event) and a peak-period (representing the uGC
levels related to the event), taking into account the delayed GC clearance in
chimpanzee urine26,27 and the diurnal decrease of uGC levels in chimpanzees47
(Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Note 1). We calculated the mean uGC levels
for the pre-period (from samples taken between the start of the event until 135 min
after the start of the event) and the mean uGC levels for the peak-period (from
samples taken between 135 min until 270 min after the event þ event duration) for
each event. Samples taken within 30 min after the pre or the peak-period were still
assigned to the preceding period, if the focal individual had not urinated within the
last 30 min of the preceding period26. Finally we calculated the relative uGC levels
as a percentage of how high the uGC levels were during the peak-period compared
with the pre-period:
relative uGC ¼ uGC peak � period
uGC pre � period �100
ð1Þ
We calculated an average decrease of 5.55% of the uGC level per hour of the day.
Taking an average time difference of 135 min between peak and pre-period
samples, peak-period samples should be 12.49% lower than pre-period samples. A
relative uGC level of about 87.5% therefore reflected a neutral effect of the event
behaviour on the uGC level only including the estimated diurnal decline of uGC.
Levels above the expected relative uGC level of 87.5% would represent an increase
and below the 87.5% would represent a decrease in uGC levels due to the event.
Definition of social bonds. The Relationship Quality of chimpanzees can be
defined by three components48 such that those that share close social bonds engage
in: (1) high rates of socio-positive and cooperative behaviours and low rates of
socio-negative behaviours, (2) balanced or symmetrical offering of high rates of
socio-positive and cooperative behaviours over time, (3) sustained patterns of (1)
and (2) over at least a six month period. We described the quality of social
relationships by calculating the composite relationship index24,38,46 (CRI) over
quarter-year periods for all possible dyads. The CRI contrasts socio-positive and
negative behaviours in relation to average behaviour rates per sex combination
across dyads.

where SP1 ¼ rate of grooming bouts plus rate of resting in 1m proximity;
SP2 ¼ rate of food sharing plus rate of coalitionary support; NP ¼ rate of aggression
and contra-intervention, i ¼ individual (receiver of service) and j ¼ dyad partner
(offering of service). A positive CRI indicated a more socio-positive relationship
and a negative CRI showed a socio-negative relationship. A good indication that
grooming and food-sharing are important bonding behaviours is that both have
been linked with elevated urinary oxytocin levels in chimpanzees38,46. Dyads were
only defined as bond partners when socio-positive relationships were symmetrical
(reflecting similar rates of offered affiliations from both dyad partners) and long
lasting (Z 6 months: at least two consecutive blocks of quarter-year periods).
Balance and duration of relationships: scored through either a mutual socio-
positive relationship (CRI40) during the annual quarter of the sampled event and
the preceding quarter, or a large mutual socio-positive relationship (CRI410)
during one of the quarters and a socio-neutral or positive relationship (CRIZ0)
during the other quarter24,38,46.
Bond partners were defined as those with whom subjects engaged in high rates
of affiliative and cooperative behaviours (grooming, food sharing, coalitionary
support) and low rates of aggression in both directions over at least two consecutive
three month time periods providing an objective measure of historical
predictability of social support24. A histogram of mean CRI scores per dyad shows

 a bimodal distribution, with bonded relationships clustering in the higher scores
and non-bonded relationships clustering around zero (Supplementary Fig. 3). For
this reason, we use Relationship Quality as a binomial variable.
Definition of kin relationships. We used genetic analysis to classify dydas as close
maternal kin (that is, mothers with offspring and maternal siblings) or not.
Previous research suggests that as in most other group-living primates49,
chimpanzees can recognize and discriminate their mothers and maternal siblings25.
However, the ability of chimpanzees to recognize more distant maternal kin, who
anyways would be rare when all males stay in their natal group and the vast
majority of female disperse, as occurs in Sonso, has not been demonstrated. Nor do
chimpanzees seem to recognize and discriminate their paternal kin25. We collected
fresh faecal samples after individually identified chimpanzees were observed
defecating. Samples were either collected in plastic tubes and frozen within a 12 h
period, collected in plastic tubes containing dessicating silica beads or collected in
tubes filled with 95–99% ethanol and then transferred to tubes containing
dessicating silica beads after 12–24 h (ref. 50). DNA was extracted from faeces
using the Qiagen DNA stool kit. We genotyped 92 chimpanzees at up to 19
autosomal microsatellite loci. To guard against allelic dropout at the autosomal
loci, we first estimated the amount of amplifiable DNA in each extract through
quantitative PCR, and then followed previously established guidelines showing that
depending on the amount of amplifiable DNA present in an extract, up to four
independent PCR replications are required to be 99% confident that a putatively
homozygous genotype is indeed homozygous51. For heterozygous genotypes, each
allele was observed in at least two independent PCRs (ref. 51). To guard against
misidentification of individuals during sample collection or sample mix-up, in
dyads that we strongly suspected from behavioural observations to be
mother-offspring pairs we checked that individuals shared at least one allele at
every autosomal locus. For individuals without suspected first-order maternal
relatives, we used a second, independently collected faecal sample to repeat the
genotyping at six or more loci and required a perfect match with the original
genotype. Using these methods, we were able to determine that o1% of samples
came from an incorrectly identified individual. In these cases, we genotyped
additional extracts from independently collected faecal sample until the conflict
was resolved. Microsatellite genotypes were produced through a two-step PCR
multiplex procedure, using unlabelled primers for all 19 primers in the first
amplification, and fluorescently labelled forward primers and nested primers in the
subsequent single locus PCR reaction51. PCR products were electrophoresed on an
ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Allele sizes determined using an internal size
standard (ROX labelled HD400) and Genemapper software version 3.7 (ref. 51).
We used the autosomal genotypes in likelihood based maternity analyses52. All
eight dydas suspected of being mother-offspring from behavioural observations
shared an allele at each autosomal microsatellite locus and had maternity
assignments at the 95% confidence level using the CERVUS likelihood based
parentage program (Supplementary Data 2). There were two dyads (Harriette—
Gladis and Kalema—Kutu), where both members of a pair had unassigned
mothers, because the mothers’ samples were unavailable for genotyping; for these
two dyads the maternity assignments precluded a mother-offspring but not a
maternal sibling relationship. However, for one dyad (Kalema—Kutu) we were able
to exclude the possibility that they were maternal siblings because they had
different 473 base pair haplotypes at the hypervariable region-1 of the maternally
inherited mitochondrial DNA (ref. 53). While we could not use genetic data to
exclude the possibility that the other dyad (Harriette—Gladis) were maternal
siblings, we consider this unlikely given the low incidence of female philopatry at
Sonso and in chimpanzees more generally (suggesting that Harriette and Gladis are
immigrants rather than natal to Sonso), as well as research in another community
showing that it is extremely rare for maternal sisters to transfer from their natal
community to the same new community54. We thus classified Harriette—Gladis as
unrelated in all analyses.
Statistics. We employed linear mixed models55 to test the effects of the test
predictors Event (Model 1) and Event together with Relationship Quality
(Model 2) on relative uGC levels. We included Subject Identity and unique Event
Identity as random factors and included several control predictors as additional
fixed effects. To control for ‘safety in numbers’ we included the Number of
Chimpanzees Present during each event. To control for expected glucocorticoid
release due to energetic costs during intergroup encounters56, we included the
event duration, predicting an interaction with event and event duration such that
longer intergroup encounters should result in higher energetic output and thus
higher uGC levels than shorter ones. This is in contrast to grooming and resting
contexts in which no increase in energetic output was expected with event
duration. To control for effects related to either subject’s sex, or partner’s sex or the
combination of both, we included an interaction of these terms. Finally, when
testing the Relationship Quality we controlled for kin, since we expected close
social bonds would provide uGC level effects regardless of kinship.
The models were fitted in R 3.1.3 (ref. 57) using the function ‘lmer’ of the
R-package lme4 (ref. 58) with Maximum Likelihood. Residuals were normally
distributed and homogenous, as shown by visual inspection of qq plots and
residual plots against fitted values. We checked for model stability by excluding
subjects one at a time from the data and found models were stable, apart from
model 2a (Social Buffering Model) where the interactions of Event and
Relationship Quality, as well as the interaction of Subject’s and Partner’s Sex
showed some instability and thus requires careful interpretation. To investigate
whether or not the skewed distribution in the resting event has caused the
insignificant effect for the test predictors’ interaction term, we run a full versus null
model comparison, testing the interaction of Event and Relationship Quality only
for resting events and intergroup encounters (Supplementary Table 3). This
comparison showed no significant effect of the interaction term (Wald test: df ¼ 1,
w2 ¼ 1.01, P ¼ 0.315), confirming the result of model 2a. Variables did not exhibit
problems of collinearity (Variance Inflation Factor o4 in all cases, derived using
R-package car59, and were tested using a standard linear model excluding the
random effect), suggesting that each predictor variable accounted for a portion of
the variance. We established the significance of the full model as compared with the
null model (comprised of control predictors and random factors) using a likelihood
ratio test60. Since interactions between predictors do not allow interpretation of the
effect of the respective fixed factors in the model, we removed non-significant
interactions to investigate the effects of the predictors. We calculated the marginal
R2 (relative variance explained by fixed factors in relation to total variance) as the
effect size for the model.
Finally, we used bootstrap sampling methods61,62 with 1,000 permutations to
test whether relative uGC levels were significantly smaller or larger than the
expected relative value, which was calculated to include estimated diurnal
decline26,47 (Supplementary Note 1). We calculated the mean for each individual
for each event with or without bond partner engagement and calculated the
deviation from the expected value (expected relative uGC ¼ 87.5%). Values above 0
indicated an increase of uGC levels due to the event, values below 0 indicated a
decrease of uGC levels due to the event. Since we had directed predictions (increase
of uGC when interacting with a non-bond partner, decrease of uGC levels when
interacting with a bond partner), we calculated the 5% interval on the predicted
side of deviation from the expected value.
