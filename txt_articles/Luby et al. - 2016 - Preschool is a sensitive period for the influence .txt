Building on well-established animal data demonstrating the effects of
early maternal support on hippocampal development and adaptive
coping, a few longitudinal studies suggest that early caregiver support
also impacts human hippocampal development. How caregiving con-
tributes to human hippocampal developmental trajectories, whether
there are sensitive periods for these effects, as well as whether
related variation in hippocampal development predicts later child-
hood emotion functioning are of major public health importance. The
current study investigated these questions in a longitudinal study of
preschoolers assessed annually for behavioral and emotional devel-
opment, including observed caregiver support. One hundred and
twenty-seven children participated in three waves of magnetic
resonance brain imaging through school age and early adolescence.
Multilevel modeling of the effects of preschool and school-age
maternal support on hippocampal volumes across the three waves
was conducted. Hippocampal volume increased faster for those
with higher levels of preschool maternal support. Subjects with
support 1 SD above the mean had a 2.06 times greater increase in
total hippocampus volume across the three scans than those with
1 SD below the mean (2.70% vs. 1.31%). No effect of school-age
support was found. Individual slopes of hippocampus volume
were significantly associated with emotion regulation at scan 3.
The findings demonstrate a significant effect of early childhood
maternal support on hippocampal volume growth across school
age and early adolescence and suggest an early childhood
sensitive period for these effects. They also show that this growth
trajectory is associated with later emotion functioning.
maternal support | hippocampus | sensitive period | preschool | emotions
A
large body of developmental data from studies of rodents
has clearly established that the early experience of a highly
nurturing caregiver has a powerful effect on hippocampal de-
velopment in the rat pup, through an epigenetic mechanism
(1–4). Building on these findings in animals, an increasing body
of data in humans has emerged suggesting that early experiences
of support, or conversely of abuse, neglect, or adversity, similarly
impact human hippocampal development (5–7). The hippo-
campus, a region dense with glucocorticoid receptors, plays an
integral role in the hypothalamic pituitary axis stress response (8,
9). Related to this role, reductions in hippocampal volume have
been implicated in maladaptive stress reactivity and coping, as
well as in affective psychopathology (10, 11). Therefore, a greater
understanding of the environmental factors, particularly early
caregiving experiences, that contribute to healthy hippocampal
development in humans is of significant public health importance.
Further, it is critical to examine whether variation in hippocampal
development related to early caregiving predicts later childhood
emotion functioning, as would be expected based on the animal
data but not yet established in humans (12).
Although retrospective studies establish a link between child-
hood trauma and abuse and decreases in hippocampal volume in
adults, these findings are limited by the known bias and possible
inaccuracy of retrospective accounts of early childhood experiences
by adult reporters (13, 14). More recently, some prospective data
have become available to inform this issue. Using one wave of scan
data from the study sample presented here, we have previously
reported a link between higher early childhood maternal support
and larger hippocampal volumes measured at school age in non-
depressed subjects (15). Another prospective study that followed a
small sample of cocaine-exposed infants from birth through ado-
lescence reported decreased hippocampal volumes in adolescents
who experienced higher maternal nurturance at age 4 (16). Al-
though this effect was opposite what would be expected from the
animal literature, the use of a relatively small sample exposed to
drugs in utero may represent a unique developmental trajectory.
Alterations in patterns of connectivity between the medial pre-
frontal cortex and amygdala have been reported in children who
experienced early maternal deprivation (17, 18). Notably, another
unique prospective study of a small group of children exposed to
chronically depressed and less nurturing mothers displayed in-
creases in amygdala volumes but no changes in hippocampus when
scanned at age 10 (19). These conflicting findings underscore the
need for further investigation of these relationships in larger sam-
ples with broader early risk exposures. In addition, there is a need to
examine brain outcomes across the trajectory of brain development
using multiple scan waves longitudinally. It is possible that disparate
findings may reflect the unique risk trajectories of the various study
samples, small sample sizes, as well as the limitations of cross-
sectional imaging outcomes. As such, the question of whether
Significance
Data from a longitudinal neuroimaging study beginning in the
preschool period and including three brain scans through
school age and early adolescence were used to investigate the
effects of maternal support on the development of the hip-
pocampus. Consistent with animal findings showing that early
support enhances hippocampal development and later adap-
tive coping, findings demonstrated that early childhood
maternal support predicted a steeper hippocampal growth
trajectory. The data also suggested that early childhood was
a sensitive period when the effects of support had a more
powerful effect on hippocampal growth. The hippocampal
growth trajectory was associated with better emotion regula-
tion in early adolescence. Findings suggest that enhancing
early childhood maternal support fosters healthy childhood
brain development and emotion functioning.

 the effect of early caregiver support impacts hippocampal devel-
opment across its growth trajectory is of key interest. The current
study aimed to address this question using a longitudinal neuro-
imaging design across childhood to investigate whether there are
effects of support on brain development from school age through
early adolescence.
Another key question that has been of interest in the study of
the effects of caregiving quality on emotional, cognitive, and
related brain development has been whether there are sensitive
periods during which these environmental factors may have a
particularly powerful effect on developmental outcomes. Such
sensitive periods in development, when environmental exposures
have a uniquely large and formative effect on neural structure
and function, are well-established in visual and sensory-motor
systems (20, 21). There has been some emerging evidence for
sensitive periods in emotional development as well. This includes
data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, where in-
stitutionalized children randomized to foster care before the age
of 2 had superior cognitive and socioemotional outcomes to
those randomized at later ages (22). Similarly, Rao et al. (16)
report evidence for a sensitive period for the effects of maternal
support (although in the opposite direction of that expected
from animal studies), with childhood support at age 4 predicting
adolescent brain outcomes whereas later childhood support at
age 8 did not. If sensitive periods for the effects of supportive
caregiving on brain development could be identified, it would have
very important early intervention and prevention implications.
To address these questions, we sought to investigate whether
experiences of maternal support predicted the trajectory of hip-
pocampal development through school age and early adoles-
cence using a longitudinal neuroimaging study with three waves of
structural imaging data. We also tested whether caregiver support
during the preschool versus school-age periods had unique effects
on hippocampal outcomes. Last, to better interpret the functional
significance of any effects found on hippocampal growth trajec-
tories, we examined whether these trajectories predicted emotion
reactivity and/or regulation at late school age.
Results
Subjects were 127 children participating in a longitudinal study
of preschool depression who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria
for magnetic resonance brain imaging at the first of three scan
waves at ages 7–13. These children had usable left and/or right
hippocampus T1-weighted MRI volume data at one or more scan
waves and maternal support data, as well as other data of interest
in the trajectory of hippocampal development, including IQ and
income-to-needs ratio. Demographic characteristics of the study
sample are detailed in Table 1. Multilevel linear models (MLMs)
were used to examine the effect of maternal support on hippo-
campus volume over three scan waves. Two measures of maternal
support, one assessed during the preschool period (centered at
mean 11.65) and one assessed at school age before the first scan
(centered at mean 30.60), were included as independent variables in
the models. At the wave where preschool maternal support was
assessed, 66% of subjects lived with both maternal and paternal
figures in the home. The models included random intercept and
slope components with an unstructured covariance matrix between
the two. Time was coded as scan number, and covariates were age at
scan 1 (centered at mean 10.54 y), quadratic age at scan 1, gender
(1 male, 0 female), income-to-needs ratio at scan 1 (centered at mean
1.72), IQ (centered at mean 103.68), and total gray matter volume.
Degrees-of-freedom calculations used the method of Kenward and
Roger (23), and analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3.
Maternal Support During Preschool and Developmental Trajectories
of Hippocampus Volume During School Age and Early Adolescence.
The results of the MLM of total hippocampus volume are shown
in Table 2. There was a significant increase in total hippocampus
volume over time (P < 0.0001). In addition, the main effect of
total gray matter volume was significantly positively associated
with hippocampus volume (B = 0.0053, SE = 0.0007, t = 7.61, P <
0.0001). IQ score was not significantly associated with hippo-
campus volume. Neither preschool (P = 0.4629) nor school-age
(P = 0.4846) maternal support was significant as a main effect;
however, the interaction between preschool maternal support
and time was significantly associated with hippocampus volume
in a positive direction. That is, total hippocampus volume in-
creased faster for those with higher levels of preschool maternal
support. Specifically, subjects with preschool maternal support 1
SD above the mean (19.9) compared with subjects with pre-
school maternal support 1 SD below the mean (3.3) had a 2.06
times greater increase in total hippocampus volume from scan 1
to 3 (2.70% vs. 1.31%). Fig. 1 shows individually estimated total
hippocampus volume slopes as a function of preschool maternal
support. Effect size was calculated by taking the correlation of
preschool maternal support with subjects’ individual slope esti-
mates, and the effect size for this model was 0.22. Fig. S1 shows
estimated trajectories of total hippocampus volume by preschool
maternal support.
In contrast to preschool support, there was no significant change
in total hippocampus volume over time as a function of school-age
maternal support (B = −0.0001, SE = 0.0011, t = −0.10, P = 0.9228).
To further evaluate any effect of school-age maternal support, an
MLM of total hippocampus volume with school-age, but not pre-
school, maternal support as an independent variable was conducted.
The school-age maternal support by time interaction in that model
was still not significant (B = 0.0012, SE = 0.0011, t = 1.12, P =
0.2647). Importantly, although preschool and school-age support
are correlated at 0.40, there was ample variance in the study sample
of children who had high preschool support and low school-age
support and vice versa to allow us to test the differential effects of
these two variables (SI Materials and Methods).
Of note, the significant preschool maternal support by time in-
teraction remained (B = 0.0034, SE = 0.0012, t = 2.79, P = 0.0067)
when internalizing diagnosis through scan 1 [major depressive dis-
order (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety
disorder, and/or posttraumatic stress disorder] and externalizing
diagnosis through scan 1 (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
conduct disorder, and/or oppositional defiant disorder), and their
interactions with time were included as covariates in the MLM.
To further investigate the relationship between maternal
support and hippocampus volume, separate MLMs were run for
left and right hippocampus volume. Table 3 details the results of
Table 1.

 the models by hemisphere. As in the model of total hippocampus
volume, the main effects of time and total gray matter volume
were significantly associated with left and right hippocampus
volume (P < 0.0001). Additionally, higher IQ scores were sig-
nificantly associated with greater right hippocampus volume (B =
0.0046, SE = 0.0023, t = 2.02, P = 0.0460). To determine whether
verbal or nonverbal IQ had a greater effect on hippocampus
volume, additional MLMs were run replacing IQ score with
verbal IQ and, separately, nonverbal IQ. Results indicated that
verbal IQ was driving the effect, as seen in Tables S1 and S2.
Similar to the total hippocampus volume model, the main effects
of preschool and school-age maternal support were nonsignificant,
but the interaction of preschool maternal support and time was
significantly associated with both left (B = 0.0019, SE = 0.0008, t =
2.37, P = 0.0203) and right hippocampus volume (B = 0.0014, SE =
0.0007, t = 2.10, P = 0.0389). Specifically, subjects with preschool
maternal support 1 SD above the mean (19.9) compared with
subjects with preschool maternal support 1 SD below the mean
(3.3) had a 2.22 times greater increase in left hippocampus volume
from scan 1 to 3 (2.89% vs. 1.30%) and a 1.76 times greater increase
in right hippocampus volume from scan 1 to 3 (2.56% vs. 1.46%).
Fig. 2 shows individually estimated left and right hippocampus
volume slopes as a function of preschool maternal support. Ef-
fect sizes were 0.18 for left and 0.17 for right hippocampus. Fig.
S2 shows estimated trajectories of left and right hippocampus
volume by preschool maternal support.
As with the MLM of total hippocampus volume, the preschool
maternal support by time interaction remained significant when
internalizing diagnosis through scan 1 and externalizing diagnosis
through scan 1, and their interactions with time were included as
covariates in the models of left (B = 0.0019, SE = 0.0008, t = 2.37,
P = 0.0206) and right hippocampus volume (B = 0.0014, SE =
0.0007, t = 2.09, P = 0.0404).
Because school-age maternal support was not significantly
associated with hippocampus volume trajectory, the MLMs were
rerun without this independent variable. Removing school-age
maternal support from the model resulted in an increased sam-
ple size of n = 143 subjects with the same effects found (Tables
S3 and S4).
SI Materials and Methods present additional analyses repli-
cating our previous findings (15) at scan 1, only with the larger
sample used in the current report (see Tables S5 and S6).
Does the Trajectory of Hippocampal Development Predict Emotion
Functioning? Individual-subject intercepts and slopes were gen-
erated from the MLM of total hippocampus volume by preschool
maternal support and were investigated as potential predictors of
the Children’s Emotion Management Scale–Sadness (CEMS-S)
(24) dysregulation and coping subscales. Individual-subject slopes
were significantly associated with CEMS-S dysregulation and
coping in a general linear model with individual intercepts and
slopes as independent variables (B = −26.41, SE = 12.53, t =
−2.11, P = 0.0374).
Discussion
These study findings in a group of children observed in inter-
action with their caregivers during the preschool period and then
scanned three times across school age and early adolescence are
consistent with the body of animal literature documenting the

 powerful effects of maternal support on hippocampal develop-
ment. Study findings confirm and extend earlier cross-sectional
findings in the same sample and suggest that failure to find
similar effects in smaller samples may be related to type II error,
and findings of opposite effects in a cocaine-exposed population
may be unique to those exposures. Findings from this longitudinal
neuroimaging study extend the literature in three important and
previously unidentified ways. First, these results demonstrate that
the effect of maternal support extends beyond one outcome mea-
sure of hippocampal volume at early school age and has an influ-
ence on the trajectory of hippocampal volume growth into later
school age and early adolescence. Second, the findings demonstrate

 that maternal support measured during the preschool period has a
stronger effect on hippocampal volume trajectories compared with
support measured at school age, consistent with the hypothesis of a
sensitive period for the effects of support on hippocampal devel-
opment. Third, alterations in the trajectory of hippocampal growth
had functional significance for adaptive outcomes, as evidenced by
the association between hippocampal volume trajectories and a
later measure of emotion regulation.
Consistent with the animal literature, alterations in hippo-
campal growth trajectories related to early maternal support
were associated with more adaptive later emotion regulation
(12). The hippocampus is a key brain region known to impact
several areas of cognitive and emotion functioning including
emotion regulation (10). Therefore, the identification of modi-
fiable environmental exposures that can impact the development
of the hippocampus and in turn later emotion functioning is a
finding of key public health importance. These findings should
inform prevention and early intervention strategies, a number of
which have been designed and shown to effectively enhance
maternal support (25–27).
These findings are limited by the fact that the study sample
was enriched for preschoolers with emotional and behavioral
problems. Although the findings held when the effects of these
variables were accounted for, this group could have a unique risk
trajectory from healthy developing children or children under
other risk conditions. Based on this, future investigations of
these risk relationships should now be explored in general-pop-
ulation samples. In addition, future studies should further in-
vestigate whether the effects found had regional anterior versus
posterior subfield specificity in the hippocampus, an issue the
current study was unable to address due to the current limita-
tions of FreeSurfer methodology. Although study findings sug-
gest that there is a sensitive period for preschool versus school-
age maternal support on the trajectory of hippocampal volume
growth, future studies that are specifically designed to more
definitively address this question are now needed.
Conclusions
These study findings provide, to our knowledge, the first evi-
dence for the long-term effects of early maternal support on the
development of the hippocampus through school age and early
adolescence. They also suggest that maternal support during the
preschool period may represent a sensitive period when these
experiences have a uniquely powerful effect on brain develop-
ment. The finding that maternal support experienced during the
preschool period has a tangible impact on the trajectory of
hippocampal development through school age and early ado-
lescence further underscores the importance of public health
efforts to enhance maternal support during early childhood, a
goal that has proven to be both feasible and cost-effective (28).
Materials and Methods
All study procedures were approved in advance by the Washington University
Institutional Review Board and informed consent/assent was obtained from all
study subjects (as age-appropriate) and their legal guardians. Subjects were
participants in an ongoing 11-y longitudinal neuroimaging study. Behavioral/
developmental assessments began when subjects were 3.0- to 5.11-y-old and
continued annually over six waves with scanning starting at age 6.11–12.11 and
repeated approximately every 18 mo for three waves of neuroimaging; n = 127
subjects who completed at least one scan (out of three), had maternal support
data available at both preschool and school age (before the first scan), and had a
valid IQ score were included in the primary analysis.
Maternal Preschool and School-Age Support Defined. Maternal support in the
present study was conceptualized as the degree to which mothers view and
approach their children with positive regard overall as well as their efforts to
be emotionally and developmentally aware of their children’s emotional
well-being. Furthermore, caregiver support includes their ability to facilitate
their children’s sense of autonomy by supporting and validating their child’s
intent to lead and strategize to solve problems. More specifically, support
was coded during an interval when parents expressed predominantly posi-
tive emotions during the mildly stressful task, when they remained calm, and
when they were reassuring when reacting to the child’s emotional expres-
sions elicited by the parent–child interaction task. Supportive behaviors in-
cluded acknowledging the child’s accomplishments on the task or behaviors
related to the parent–child interaction. Support includes verbally encour-
aging the child with positive emotional regard (e.g., “You’re really good at
this” or “You got another one right”). Another example of support occurs
when a child becomes visibly upset/anxious and the parent changes their
proximity to the child so that they are closer and the caregiver may rub the
child’s back to help him/her regulate.
Preschool Maternal Support. Preschool maternal support was measured at the
second annual study wave when subjects aged 3.11–6.11 and their caregivers
engaged in a mildly stressful task in the laboratory. This task, known as “the
waiting task,” required the child to wait for 8 min before opening a brightly
wrapped gift sitting within arm’s reach while the parent completed ques-
tionnaires. This paradigm was designed to evoke mild stress for both parent
and child. Staff trained to acceptable interrater reliability coded the in-
teraction for supportive caregiving strategies the parent used to help reg-
ulate the child’s impulse and desire to open the gift before the appropriate
amount of time had elapsed. Each instance of specific types of supportive
caregiving strategies used by the parent was counted as 1 unit and summed
to give an overall preschool maternal support score. Thus, each parent’s
supportive caregiving score represents the total number of supportive be-
haviors they were observed using over the course of the 8-min task. Prior
findings suggest that caregiving support behaviors coded during this task
have good psychometric properties (29, 30). Specifically, Cronbach’s alpha
for the combined supportive behaviors coded was alpha = 0.86.
School-Age Maternal Support. Subjects and their caregivers completed a
different developmentally appropriate mildly stressful task, “the puzzle
task,” at the third annual study wave (child age 4.11–7.11) and again at their
fifth annual assessment wave ∼4–5 y later (child age 8.3–12.6). In this task, a
puzzle of the United States is placed between the parent and child under a
cardboard box. The child is asked to attempt to put together a puzzle within
an enclosed box so that they cannot see the pieces but are instructed only by
the parent, who can see. Children are told that they cannot look and puzzle
pieces are given to the parent, who can clearly see the puzzle board and
where the child’s hands are. Parents are told to give the child instructions on
how to place each piece, and both are told to finish the puzzle in 5 min to
earn a prize. The examiner then sets a timer and tells the pair to begin. The
5-min task was separated into 30-s segments during which coders trained to
adequate interrater reliability provided ratings for the frequency of parents’
supportive caregiving behaviors observed during the task. Maternal support
data coded from the puzzle task were only included in these analyses if the
child completed the task after age 6.0 and before their first scan. In instances
where the subject had two ratings of maternal support from the puzzle task,
school-age maternal support was calculated as the mean of the two values.
Out of the n = 127 subjects included in this analysis, n = 120 (94%) had the
same caregiver at preschool and school-age assessments of support.
Income-to-Needs Ratio. An income-to-needs ratio was calculated as the total
family income at the first scan divided by the federal poverty level based on
family size for the year of data collection.
IQ Score. Subjects were assessed with either the Kaufman Brief In-
telligence Test (KBIT) (31) or the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence
(WASI) (32) (depending upon age at study wave) to determine verbal and
nonverbal intelligence.
Children’s Emotion Management Scale–Sadness. The CEM-S measures is a
parent report of the child’s sadness. The 11 items are on a Likert scale of
hardly ever (1), sometimes (2), and often (3) and are summed to create in-
hibition, dysregulation, and coping subscales. The coping subscale was re-
verse-scored and added to the dysregulation subscale to create an overall
measure of dysregulation and coping.
Imaging and Hippocampal Quantification. Two 3D T1-weighted magnetiza-
tion-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) scans were acquired sagittally
on a Siemens 3.0T Tim Trio using a 12-channel head coil [repetition time (TR)
2,300 ms, echo time (TE) 3.16 ms, inversion time (TI) 1,200 ms, flip angle 8°,
160 slices, 256 × 256 matrix, field of view 256 mm, 1.0-mm3 voxels, 6:18 min

 per scan]. The two MPRAGE scans were assessed visually, and the best one
was selected for further processing by blinded raters. The selected MPRAGE
for each wave was processed using the longitudinal stream in the FreeSurfer
software package, version 5.3 (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) (33). Several
processing steps, such as skull stripping, Talairach transformations, and atlas
registration, as well as spherical surface maps and parcellations were ini-
tialized with common information from an unbiased within-patient template.
This longitudinal stream reduces the bias that would otherwise be present in
selecting a single scan result as baseline, and significantly increases reliability
and statistical power (34). The white and pial surfaces generated by FreeSurfer
were visually inspected and, when necessary, appropriate edits were performed
and the surfaces were regenerated. For ∼10% of scans, poor scan quality re-
quired discarding them from further analysis (n = 15, 11, and 7 at the three
waves, respectively). In those cases, all data were generated from within-subject
templates using the remaining scans. Hippocampal and total gray matter vol-
umes (sum of cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar gray matter) for the left and
right hemispheres were obtained from the “Hippocampus” and “TotalGrayVol”
measures, respectively, in Freesurfer’s “aseg.stats” report.
