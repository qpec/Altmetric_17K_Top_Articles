Background
Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease characterized by joint pain, tenderness, and limitation of movement. At present, no cure is available.
Thus only treatment of the person’s symptoms and treatment to prevent further development of the disease are possible. Clinical trials
indicate that aquatic exercise may have advantages for people with osteoarthritis. This is an update of a published Cochrane review.
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of aquatic exercise for people with knee or hip osteoarthritis, or both, compared to no intervention.
Search methods
We searched the following databases up to 28 April 2015: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the Cochrane
Library Issue 1, 2014), MEDLINE (from 1949), EMBASE (from 1980), CINAHL (from 1982), PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence
Database), and Web of Science (from 1945). There was no language restriction.
Selection criteria
Randomized controlled clinical trials of aquatic exercise compared to a control group (e.g. usual care, education, social attention,
telephone call, waiting list for surgery) of participants with knee or hip osteoarthritis.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials. We analysed
the pooled results using standardized mean difference (SMD) values.

 Main results
Nine new trials met the inclusion criteria and we excluded two earlier included trials. Thus the number of participants increased from
800 to 1190 and the number of included trials increased from six to 13. Most participants were female (75%), with an average age of
68 years and a body mass index (BMI) of 29.4. Osteoarthritis duration was 6.7 years, with a great variation of the included participants.
The mean aquatic exercise duration was 12 weeks. We found 12 trials at low to unclear risk of bias for all domains except blinding
of participants and personnel. They showed that aquatic exercise caused a small short term improvement compared to control in pain
(SMD −0.31, 95% CI −0.47 to −0.15; 12 trials, 1076 participants) and disability (SMD −0.32, 95% CI −0.47 to −0.17; 12 trials,
1059 participants). Ten trials showed a small effect on quality of life (QoL) (SMD −0.25, 95% CI −0.49 to −0.01; 10 trials, 971
participants). These effects on pain and disability correspond to a five point lower (95% CI three to eight points lower) score on mean
pain and mean disability compared to the control group (scale 0 to 100), and a seven point higher (95% CI 0 to 13 points higher)
score on mean QoL compared with control group (scale 0 to 100). No included trials performed a radiographic evaluation. No serious
adverse events were reported in the included trials with relation to aquatic exercise.
Authors’ conclusions
There is moderate quality evidence that aquatic exercise may have small, short-term, and clinically relevant effects on patient-reported
pain, disability, and QoL in people with knee and hip OA. The conclusions of this review update does not change those of the previous
published version of this Cochrane review.

Aquatic exercise for people with osteoarthritis in the knee or hip
Review question
What are the effects of aquatic exercise interventions in the treatment of people with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA)?
Background: what is osteoarthritis of the hip and knee, and what is aquatic exercise?
Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease characterized by joint pain, tenderness, and limitation of movement. At present no cure is available.
Thus only treatment of the person’s symptoms and treatment to prevent further development of the disease are possible. Aquatic exercise
is physical exercises taking place while the participant are immersed in water, typically water with a temperature between 32°C to 36°C.
This is a review update of a published Cochrane review, and presents results from research concerning the effect of aquatic exercise for
treating people with the knee and hip osteoarthritis.
Study characteristics
In this summary of this Cochrane review update we present what we know from research about the effects of aquatic exercise for people
with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip. After searching for all relevant trials up to 28 April 2015, we included nine new trials since the
last version of the Cochrane review. In total we included 13 trials (1190 participants). Most of these trials included participants with
mild to moderate symptomatic knee or hip osteoarthritis.
Key results
Aquatic exercise for a mixed group of people with knee and hip osteoarthritis probably improves pain, disability slightly, and may
improve quality of life slightly immediately after completion of a treatment course (up to 12 weeks of aquatic exercise). This review
update does not change the conclusions of the previous published version of this Cochrane review.
Pain [lower score is better]
People who completed an aquatic exercise programme rated their pain as five points lower (three to eight points lower) on a 0 to 100
scale at the end of aquatic exercise compared with people who did not receive aquatic exercise (5% absolute improvement)
People who completed an exercise program rated their pain to be 41 points on a scale of 0 to 100
People in the control group rated their pain to be 46 points on a scale of 0 to 100.
Disability [lower score is better]

 People who completed an aquatic exercise programme rated their disability as five points lower (three to eight points lower) on a 0 to
100 scale at the end of aquatic exercise compared with people who did not receive aquatic exercise (5% absolute improvement)
People who completed an exercise program rated their disability to be 39 points on a scale of 0 to 100
People in the control group rated their disability to be 44 points on a scale of 0 to 100
Quality of life [higher score is better]
People who completed an aquatic exercise programme rated their quality of life as seven points higher (0 to 13 points higher) on a 0
to 100 scale at the end of aquatic exercise compared with people who did not receive aquatic exercise (13% absolute improvement)
People who completed an exercise program rated their quality of life to be 57 points on a scale of 0 to 100
People in the control group rated their quality of life to be 50 points on a scale of 0 to 100
X-rays of the joints - no studies measured this outcome
Withdrawals from the study
3 more people out of 100 dropped out of the aquatic exercise programme (3% absolute increase)
18 people out of 100 in the aquatic exercise group dropped out of the exercise programme
15 people out of 100 dropped out of the control group
Serious adverse events
No serious side effects were reported with relation to participating in aquatic exercise
Quality of evidence
Moderate quality evidence shows that among people with hip and knee osteoarthritis, aquatic exercise may reduce pain and disability,
and increase quality of life immediately after the end of the programme of treatment. Further research may change these results.

3We estimated the NNTB (Number Needed to Treat for an additional beneficial outcome) from the OR. We transformed the SMD value to the OR using the equation of Chinn
2000. We set the patient expected event rate (PEER) to 0.4 for pain and to 0.26 for disability, based on Tubach 2005.
4The SD value from the largest trial (Cochrane 2005; SD in control group = 27.17) was multiplied with the SMD value of QoL (SMD −0.25, 95% CI −0.49 to −0.01)
5We estimated the NNTB from the OR. We transformed the SMD value to the OR using the equation of Chinn 2000. Since we assumed a strong relation between QoL and
disability, we chose the PEER of 0.26 for disability based on Tubach 2005.
6 We estimated the NNTH (Number Needed to Treat for an additional harmful outcome) from the RR, where the assumed control risk is the number of withdrawals in the
control group

 B A C K G R O U N D
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease characterized by joint pain,
tenderness, limitation of movement, crepitus, occasional effusion,
and variable degrees of local inflammation. The disease process
affects the articular cartilage and also involves the entire joint, in-
cluding the subchondral bone, ligaments, capsule, synovial mem-
brane, and periarticular muscles (Flores 2003). OA occurs most
frequently in people’s hands, hips, knees, back, and neck (Felson
2003). The characteristics of the disease are thickening of the joint
capsule, progressive cartilage loss, and osteophyte formation, lead-
ing to disability (Oliveria 1995; Sowers 2000). Epidemiological
studies show that OA accounts for more sick leave and disability
than the general population (Cross 2014; Hubertsson 2013), and
more trouble in walking and climbing stairs than any other mus-
culoskeletal disease (Guccione 1994). At present, only treatment
of the symptoms and treatment to prevent further development
of the disease are available. Knee and hip OA are widespread dis-
eases seen in up to 6% of the general population aged 30 and
over (Felson 1998). The prevalence of OA increases with age, and
prevalence will probably increase in the future due to the growing
group of elderly people (Cross 2014).
The aim of exercise therapy for people with OA is to improve their
strength and control over the knee joint in order to improve sen-
sorimotor control and achieve compensatory functional stability
(Ageberg 2015). This may be achieved by the following changes:
increased muscle strength, improved balance and coordination of
movements, and improved joint mobility (Ageberg 2015; Hurley
2003). Increased muscle strength in people with OA is correlated
with the person’s functional level (Gur 2002).
Over the years aquatic exercise has been known as pool therapy,
hydrotherapy, or balneotherapy, and describes exercise performed
in water. Most often the water is heated to 32°C to 36°C. Since the
main aim of physical therapy for people with OA is to diminish
painandimprove theirphysical ability, we will onlyinclude trialsin
this Cochrane review that applied an aquatic exercise programme
to participants with OA in the knee or hip joint, or both.
Aquatic exercise may be advantageous for people with OA. When
the element of hot water is included, it is thought to reduce pain
sensation, reduce stiffness of the muscular-skeletal system, and to
cause muscle relaxation in people with arthritis (Elkayam 1991).
Aquatic exercise may therefore be more beneficial as initial exercise
therapy for people with OA than similar training on land.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning
treatment of knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA), or both, with aquatic
exercise compared to a control group (e.g. usual care, education,
social attention, telephone call, or waiting list for surgery).
Types of participants
We included participants with OA in either one and/or both
knee(s) and/or one or both hip(s), as defined by the American
College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (Altman 1986), who did
not suffer from any other arthritic conditions or any other dis-
ease that may affect the joints. Participants with all degrees of os-
teoarthritis, and both primary and/or secondary OA, were eligi-
ble. We only included trials with a mixture of participants with
different rheumatic diseases if we were able to extract data on the
participants with OA.
Types of interventions
Trials including at least one treatment group in which aquatic ex-
ercise was applied. We included trials that used all types of exer-
cises (e.g. ROM, strength, aerobics) performed in a therapeutic/
heated indoor pool. The use of medication, alternative therapies,
or lifestyle changes were described in the included studies, and
must have been comparable in both groups studied.
Types of outcome measures
Beneficial outcome measures recommended by OMERACT III
(Bellamy 1997) included the following.
Primary outcomes
1. Pain.
2. Disability (e.g. measured by the Activities of Daily Living
Scale, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis
Index (WOMAC), physical function subscale).
3. Quality of life.
4. Radiographs (studies that were overone year in duration)
(Bellamy 1997).
Adverse effects
Serious adverse effects from all included trials. .

 Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
Bibliographic databases
We searched the following databases up to 28 April 2015: the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; the
Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2014), MEDLINE (from 1949), EM-
BASE (from 1980), CINAHL (from 1982), and Web of Science
(from 1945) (see Appendix 1).
Furthermore, we checked the following databases: PEDro (Physio-
therapy Evidence Database): Therapy: Hydrotherapy, Balneother-
apy, and the Copenhagen University Library’s catalogue in the sys-
tematic group covering pool therapy to ensure there were no older
studies published as monographs.
Searching other resources
Reference checking
We checked the reference lists of the included trials for further
relevant literature.
Other sources
We contacted institutions, societies, and specialists with known
expertise in aquatic therapy for further information. In addition,
we searched three trials register websites (anzctr.org.au; clinical-
trialsregister.eu; clinicaltrials.gov) for registered trials (on-going or
finished).
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (EMB and HL) independently screened the
abstracts, keywords, and publication type of all articles we ob-
tained from our described literature searches. We resolved any un-
certainties or disagreements by discussion. We obtained the full-
text articles of all studies that were possibly eligible for inclusion,
and assessed them based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
We listed the excluded trials and their reasons for exclusion in the
’Characteristics of excluded studies’ table.
Data extraction and management
Three review authors (EMB, HL, and CBJ) independently ex-
tracted data for statistical analysis. We resolved any uncertainties
or disagreements by discussion with RC, HD, KBH, and BDS.
If more than one measured variable for an outcome domain was
present in the study, we chose the outcome measure for analysis
in accordance with Juhl 2012.
The list of pain measures (in descending order) were as follows.
1. WOMAC pain sub scale (Likert/100 mm).
2. Pain during activity (visual analogue scale (VAS)).
3. Pain during walking (VAS).
4. Global knee pain (VAS).
5. Pain at rest (VAS).
6. SF-36 (Short Form, bodily pain (BP) sub scale).
7. HAQ (Health Assessment Questionnaire, pain subscale),
Lequesne algofunctional index (pain sub scale), AIMS (Arthritis
Impact Measurement Scale, pain subscale), Knee-Specific Pain
Scale (KSPS), McGill Pain Questionnaire (pain intensity), ASES
(Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale, pain subscale), SES
(Schmerzempfindungsskala).
8. Pain at night (VAS), pain during activity (Numeric Rating
Scale (NRS)), pain on walking (NRS), number of painful days
(days).
The list of disability measures was as follows (in descending order).
1. WOMAC sub scale function (Likert/100 mm).
2. SF-36 (subscale physical function (PF)).
3. Physical Composite Score (PCS) based on SF-36, SF-12, or
SF-8.
4. HAQ (Health Assessment Questionnaire disability
subscale), PDI (pain disability index), ASES (disability subscale).
There was no documentation for any order of different measures
for quality of life (QoL). However, we used the following list of
QoL measures (in descending order).
1. SF-36/SF-12/SF-8.
2. EuroQol.
3. KOOS subscore: QoL.
4. Quality of well-being.
5. Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale.
6. Other scales.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Five review authors (EMB, CBJ, HD, KBH, and HL) indepen-
dently assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. As recom-
mended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Inter-
ventions (Higgins 2011), we assessed the following methodological
domains.
1. Sequence generation: was the method used to generate the
allocation sequence appropriate to produce comparable groups?
2. Allocation concealment: was the method used to conceal
the allocation sequence appropriate to prevent the allocation
being known in advance of, or during, enrolment?
8

 3. Blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors:
were methods used to blind study participants, personnel, and
outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a
participant received?
4. Incomplete outcome data: how complete were the outcome
data for the primary outcomes? Were drop-out rates and reasons
for withdrawal reported? Were missing data imputed
appropriately? We considered an overall completion rate of 80%
or higher as a low risk of bias. If completion rates were only
provided by group, a less than 80% completion rate in the
treatment group was considered a high risk of bias.
5. Selective outcome reporting: were appropriate outcomes
reported and were any key outcomes missing?
6. Other potential threats to validity (considering external
validity, e.g. relevant use of co-interventions): e.g. what was the
funding source of each of the studies?
We explicitly judged each of these criteria as either: adequate =
low risk of bias; inadequate = high risk of bias; or unclear = either
lack of information or uncertainty over the potential for bias.
We allocated trials to one of the following groups.
1. Low risk of bias (five or six criteria met).
2. Unclear risk of bias (three to four criteria met).
3. High risk of bias (less than three criteria met).
We documented other methodological issues, such as baseline
comparability, and sample size, in the ’Characteristics of included
studies’ table.
Analyses and presentation
We performed an overall analysis for both knee and hip OA. In
addition, we analysed the results in two subgroups.
1. A group suffering from knee OA alone.
2. A group suffering from hip OA alone.
We analysed the included trials in the following domains: pain,
disability, and quality of life.
Furthermore we performed the analyses at two time points: im-
mediately after the intervention and at follow-up. We performed
an analysis of the relative risk (RR) due to withdrawal from the
aquatic exercise group compared to the control group. Finally, we
estimated the NNTH (Number Needed to Treat for an additional
harmful outcome) from the RR, where the assumed control risk
was the number of withdrawals in the control group.
Comparisons
We only pooled data if there were at least two trials of comparable
aquatic-therapy protocols, with the same conditions and compara-
ble outcome measurements. We used ’after’ data both immediately
after the treatment period, and at follow-up. We performed statis-
tical analyses using Review Manager (RevMan) software (RevMan
2014).
Continuous outcomes
Since trials used similar, but not identical, instruments to measure
pain, disability, and quality of life, we calculated the standard-
ized mean difference (SMD) values. When analysing quality of
life measurements we used a weighted average of subscores, and
estimated the standard deviation (SD) as the square root of the
weighted mean of the variance. A negative value indicates benefit
of the intervention. We assessed heterogeneity by applying a Chi²
test, and the I² test. If the Chi² test gave a statistical significant
result or the I² statistic test showed a value greater than 50%, or
both, we considered this to indicate substantial heterogeneity. We
used a random-effects model in all analyses. In order to change
the SMD into metrics we applied the Bliddal 2009 approach and
then transformed the SMD and 95% CI into a VAS ranging from
0 to 100.
Summary of findings table.
We created a ’Summary of findings’ table by using the following
outcomes: immediate post-treatment pain, disability, quality of
life, withdrawals due to adverse events, and radiographic evalu-
ation. We used the five GRADE (Grades of Recommendation,
Assessment, Development and Evaluation) considerations (study
limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and
publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence for
stated outcomes (Schünemann 2011a; Schünemann 2011b).
Outcomes pooled using SMDs were re-expressed as absolute mean
differences (or changes) by multiplying by a representative control
group baseline SD based on Bliddal 2009 (Bliddal 2009).
In the Comments column of the ’Summary of findings’ table, we
have presented the absolute change, the relative percent change
from baseline and the number needed to treat. We estimated the
NNTB (Number Needed to Treat for an additional beneficial
outcome) from the odds ratio (OR). We transformed the SMD
value to the OR using the equation of Chinn 2000. We set the
patient expected event rate (PEER) to 0.4 for pain and to 0.26 for
disability, based on Tubach 2005.

 studies to be included later (Faulkner 2006; Sct. George Hospital;
Taglietti 2014; Yazigi 2013). Thus we included 13 studies(Figure
1).

 Included studies
The 13 included RCTs with a total of 1190 participants met the
inclusion criteria (Arnold 2008 (N = 51); Cochrane 2005 (N =
312); Foley 2003 (N = 70); Fransen 2007 (N = 96); Hale 2012
(N = 39); Hinman 2007 (N = 71); Kim 2012 (N = 70); Lim
2010 (N = 50); Lund 2008 (N = 54); Patrick 2001 (N = 249);
Stener-Victorin 2004 (N = 30); Wang 2006 (N = 42); Wang 2011
(N = 56). See the ’Characteristics of included studies’ table for
further information.
Most participants were female (75%), with an average age of 68
years, with a range of 62 to 74 years. The average body mass index
(BMI) was 29.4, and the range was 26.6 to 33. The mean duration
of hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA) was 6.7 years, but with a great
variation of the included participants; for example, in one study it
lasted from four months to 15 years (Stener-Victorin 2004). The
mean aquatic exercise duration was 12 weeks, with a range of six to
20 weeks. The mean adherence rate was 87% (standard deviation
(SD) 5.4%). Eight included trials recruited participants with knee
or hip OA, or both (Cochrane 2005; Foley 2003; Fransen 2007;
Hale 2012; Hinman 2007; Kim 2012; Patrick 2001; Wang 2006).
Three trials recruited participants with knee OA only (Lim 2010;
Lund 2008; Wang 2011). Two trials recruited participants with
hip OA alone (Arnold 2008; Stener-Victorin 2004).
In one trial, Foley 2003, the trial authors did not present any mean
and SD values, but instead presented a median and an interquartile
range (IQR). We used the median value as a substitute for the
mean, and recalculated the IQR to a SD by assuming normal
distribution and by calculating SDs from the IQR.
In another trial, Lund 2008, the trial authors gave no SD value
at follow-up, but only at baseline. Therefore we based the SD at
follow-up on a calculation of the SD from the standard error (SE)
value.
Excluded studies
We excluded 44 studies (see the ’Characteristics of excluded
studies’ table for further information): two studies due to the in-
sufficient presentation of outcome data, i.e. the precise estimates
of the effect of the aquatic exercise was not given (Ahern 1995;
Sylvester 1990), and 42 studies as they did not fulfil the inclusion
criteria of this Cochrane review. Thus, it is unlikely that by includ-
ing these two studies the results would have changed significantly.
Also we excluded two studies included in a previous version of this
Cochrane review (Bartels 2007): one because the same trial data
was used in a later published version of a thesis (Wang 2004), and
one as it did not include a control group (Wyatt 2001).
Risk of bias in included studies
Using the ’Risk of bias’ assessment described above, only one in-
cluded trial was at low risk of bias (A) (Hinman 2007). Nine
included trials were at unclear risk of bias (B) (Arnold 2008;
Cochrane 2005; Foley 2003; Fransen 2007; Hale 2012; Lim 2010;
Lund 2008; Patrick 2001; Wang 2011), and three trials were at
high risk of bias (C) (Kim 2012; Stener-Victorin 2004; Wang
2006). In conclusion, the evidence presented in this review is based
upon high risk of bias of the included studies (’Characteristics of
included studies’ table; Figure 2, Figure 3).

Effect of aquatic exercise on pain compared to control
Our analysis of all trials that self-reported pain (12 trials, exclud-
ing Arnold 2008) showed a statistically significant pain reduction
(SMD −0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.47 to −0.15;
Analysis 1.1), and no sign of heterogeneity (Figure 4). This effect
corresponded to five points lower (95% CI three to eight) on a
0 to 100 scale compared to the control group. However, the one
extreme of the 95% CI showed a clinical non-relevant difference
of effect.

to −0.01; Analysis 1.3). This effect corresponded to seven points
higher(95%CI0to13pointshigher)ona 0to 100scale compared

(I² statistic = 65%; Figure 6), and the right extreme of the 95%

Knee alone
The three included trials that only recruited participants with knee
OA showed no statistically significant effect neither after exercise
or at follow-up. We did not observe any heterogeneity in our
analyses of pain (Analysis 2.1), disability (Analysis 2.2), and QoL
(Analysis 2.3).
Hip alone
One trial, Stener-Victorin 2004, evaluated the effect of aquatic
exercise on pain and QoL for participants with hip OA alone,
but showed no statistically significant effect either after exercise
or at follow-up (Analysis 3.1; Analysis 3.3). Two included trials,
Arnold 2008 and Stener-Victorin 2004, examined the effect on
self-reported disability, but there was no statistically significant
result (SMD −1.16, 95% CI −3.11 to 0.78; Analysis 3.2), and a
high degree of heterogeneity.
Effect on pain, disability, and QoL at follow-up after
aquatic exercise
Three included trials performed measurements some weeks after
the end of the aquatic exercise intervention. One trial measured
24 weeks after the exercise period (Cochrane 2005), one trial mea-
sured 12 weeks after the exercise period (Lund 2008), and one
trial measured four, 12, and 24 weeks following the exercise pe-
riod (Stener-Victorin 2004). We did not observe any statistically
significant effect on pain (SMD −0.30, 95% CI −0.92 to 0.32;
; Analysis 4.1), disability (SMD −0.32, 95% CI −0.83 to 0.20;
Analysis 4.2), or QoL (SMD −0.15, 95% CI −0.64 to 0.34;
Analysis 4.3). In all cases we observed high heterogeneity.
For one trial, Lund 2008, that included participants with knee OA
alone, we did not observe any effect on either pain (SMD 0.14,
95% CI −0.39 to 0.68; Analysis 5.1), disability (SMD −0.13,
95% CI −0.67 to 0.40; Analysis 5.2), or QoL (SMD −0.11, 95%
CI −0.65 to 0.42; Analysis 5.3). One trial, Stener-Victorin 2004,
included participants with hip OA and we observed a statistically
significant effect at follow-up on pain (SMD −1.66, 95% CI
−2.82 to −0.51; Analysis 6.1), disability (SMD −1.47, 95% CI
−2.58 to −0.35; Analysis 6.2), and QoL (SMD −1.09, 95%
CI −2.15 to −0.04; Analysis 6.3). However the right extreme of
the 95% CI for QoL showed a clinical non-relevant difference of
effect.
Radiographic evaluation
No included trials performed any type of radiographic evaluation.
However, since all but one trial were less than one year in duration,
this outcome was irrelevant (Bellamy 1997).
Adverse events
Two trials reported no increase in self-reported pain or other symp-
toms (Foley 2003; Wang 2006). Foley 2003 also reported that
there was no difference in drug consumption between the groups.
One trial reported minor adverse effects which were temporary,
such as mild joint discomfort, lumbar pain, and cramps in the
calf or foot, but none that prevented further participation in the
trial (Hinman 2007). One trial, Fransen 2007, reported one with-
drawal from the aquatic group due to low-back pain. Two trials
concluded that none of the people lost to follow-up were due to the
exercise interventions (Cochrane 2005; Hinman 2007). Two trials
reported an accident on the pool deck as the only adverse event
(Arnold 2008; Kim 2012). Two trials had an exercise trainer or as-
sistant to monitor adherence and adverse effects (Lim 2010; Wang
2011). In one aquatic exercise group one participant dropped out
due to a heart problem (Lim 2010), and another participant re-
ported dizziness during exercise (Wang 2011). In one trial, Hale
15

 2012, two participants reported that the water-based exercises ag-
gravated the pain in their legs and stopped attending during week
3 of the programme. The remaining two trials, Patrick 2001 and
Stener-Victorin 2004, didnotreportonadverse effectsatall. Thus,
11 of the 13 included trials reported adverse events, and in all trials
but one (Lim 2010) the adverse events should be characterized
as minor. A meta-analysis of people lost to follow-up from both
the aquatic exercise group and the control group showed a relative
risk (RR) for withdrawal in the aquatic exercise group compared
to control group 1.21 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.56).

Summary of main results
Overall this Cochrane review update shows that aquatic exer-
cise has a small, short-term clinically-relevant effect on patient-
reported pain, disability, and quality of life (QoL) in people with
knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) after completion of an aquatic
exercise programme. However, it is unclear whether this effect is
sustained based on the current evidence. The overall analyses of
the immediate effect of aquatic exercise shows a precise and consis-
tent result, despite a heterogeneous participant group with mixed
knee and hip OA.Compared to the control group, the participants
who did aquatic exercise showed a five point lower mean pain and
mean disability on a 0 to 100 scale, and for QoL a seven point
higher mean QoL on a 0 to 100 scale, based on moderate quality
evidence (’Summary of findings for the main comparison).
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
In order to achieve the effects found in this Cochrane review, the
intervention should be aquatic exercise and not passive aquatic
treatment only, such as spa- or balneotherapy where the main
focus is on the effect of temperature and minerals, but not of an
active intervention. Finally, relevant outcomes must be measured,
i.e. patient-relevant outcomes as pointed out by OMERACT (
Bellamy 1997). The 13 trials clearly included participants with
knee and hip OA, offered a physical exercise intervention in water,
and measured the effect on pain and disability - the main outcome
measures as pointed out by OMERACT (Bellamy 1997). On the
other hand, when we analysed the effect on participants with knee
or hip OA alone, we were only able to include a few trials in our
meta-analyses. Thus the evidence on knee and hip OA alone is
poor, and further studies focusing on knee or hip OA alone are
needed.
The primary results of this Cochrane review are based upon meta-
analyses that combined trials including participants with knee or
hip OA. However, the knee and hip joints are very different both
in type and loading. An exercise programme that shows an effectin
people with knee OA maynotbe efficaciousinpeople with hipOA,
and vice versa. Therefore exercise programmes applied to a group
of people with mixed knee and hip OA may not be as efficacious as
the exercise programmes applied to a group of people with either
knee or hip OA, given the possibility of specifically focusing the
exercise programme towards the group of people. Only two trials
included participants with hip OA alone (Arnold 2008; Stener-
Victorin 2004), and only three trials included participants with
knee OA alone (Lim 2010; Lund 2008; Wang 2011). Eight trials
included a mixed group of participants with knee and hip OA
(Cochrane 2005; Foley 2003; Fransen 2007; Hale 2012; Hinman
2007; Kim 2012; Patrick 2001; Wang 2006). Therefore, we were
unable to make a specific conclusion for each joint alone, but only
a conclusion for a mixed group of participants with knee and hip
OA.
Recently published meta-analyses support the importance of fo-
cusing on one type of exercise with a particular treatment aim
(Escalante 2010; Jansen 2011; Juhl 2013) where single-type exer-
cise programmes were more efficacious than programmes that in-
cluded different exercise types. Resistance exercise can increase the
myofibrillar protein response, and aerobic exercise can increases
mitochondrial proteins in the muscle (Hawley 2009).
Apart from the effect of aquatic exercise on pain, disability, and
QoL in participants with OA found in our Cochrane review, other
studies of aquatic exercise have shown that relevant outcomes can
improve followingtreatment. These include improvementinfunc-
tional tests, such as “sit-and-reach” (Colado 2009), “knee-push-
up” (Colado 2009), “timed-up-and-go” (Tsourlou 2006), knee ex-
tensor strength (Meredith-Jones 2011; Sato 2009), and 60 second
squats (Colado 2009). Overall, it seems possible to achieve the
same degree of improvement in both aerobic capacity and muscle
strength with aquatic exercise as with land-based exercise (Avelar
2010; Avellini1983; Bocalini 2008; Colado 2009; Meredith-Jones
2011; Nikolai 2009), and these improvements are independent of
gender and age (Meredith-Jones 2011).
As this Cochrane review shows, aquatic exercise only seems to
show minor adverse effects which are unimportant for adherence
to treatment. One included trial reported that 11 participants in
the land-based exercise group reported adverse effects of the ex-
ercise, and three of these stopped due to this (Lund 2008). In
the aquatic group only three participants reported adverse effects,
and all continued their exercise programme. Furthermore, another
study of land-based exercise for participants with knee OA indi-
catesanincrease inknee oedemafollowingexercise (Røgind 1998).
Report of adverse events following treatment is important for any
treatment, since adverse events, even minor ones, may decrease
exercise adherence in a group of participants who may naturally
avoid exercise due to fear of increased pain. In future studies of
effect of exercise in people with OA, study authors should report
adverse effects in accordance with the Ioannidis and Lau classifica-
tion (Ioannidis 2001) to give a complete picture of effects of this

 type of treatment.
Knee or hip OA is common and, when assessed by x-ray, appears
to affect older people in particular (Altman 1986). However, knee
traumas (e.g. meniscal tears, anterior cruciate ligament damage)
are related to knee OA at an earlier age (Roos 2009). Currently,
there is no cure, and the main focus of prevention and treatment is
to diminish the symptoms, i.e. pain and disability. The economic
consequences of OA, if it develops into disability, are serious (
Bitton 2009). Exercise may delay development of disability caused
by OA and this Cochrane review supports earlier findings that
show exercise therapy can diminish pain and disability in people
with knee OA (Fransen 2008).
Quality of the evidence
We downgraded the quality of evidence of the included trials due
to high risk of bias (’Characteristics of included studies’ table). We
only considered one of the 13 included trials as at low risk of bias,
and three trials at high risk of bias. However, eight included trials
were unclear regarding blinding as it was not possible to blind
either the therapist or the participant to the intervention, but in
all those trials the outcome assessor was blinded. Even though the
awareness of being treated may provide a positive bias towards
treatment when compared to a control group not exposed to treat-
ment (Sherman 2008), the high number of trials in which the out-
come assessor was blinded reduced the risk of bias. Considering
the high risk of bias, and the wide confidence intervals (CIs), our
conclusions cannot be final. Thus we have tried to be very specific
when making suggestions for further studies. Other reasons for
the lack of an unambiguous conclusion could be the combination
of hip and knee OA, the very different kinds of exercise, and the
different ways to evaluate pain, disability, and quality of life. Initia-
tives, such as OMERACT (Bellamy 1997), to identify the relevant
and useful outcome measures are needed. On the other hand, the
quality of the evidence regarding pain, disability, and quality of
life was of moderate quality (’Summary of findings’ table 1) using
the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
Potential biases in the review process
When performing a systematic review the most important part is
the literature search as the rest of the procedure rests on the avail-
able publications. We expected a low risk of bias in that respect,
as we searched several databases, checked the reference lists of all
included trials and other reviews identified, and asked institutions,
societies, and specialists known to have expertise in aquatic ther-
apy for further information. In addition, we searched three trials
register websites (anzctr.org.au; clinicaltrialsregister.eu; clinicaltri-
als.gov) and identified two trials we had already included (Arnold
2008; Patrick 2001), and four relevant trials to be included when
completed and published (Faulkner 2006; Sct. George Hospital;
Taglietti 2014; Yazigi 2013).
Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full-text
articles, and we resolved any differences by discussion. The high
number of studies that we evaluated as full-text articles may indi-
cate that we identified most available studies dealing with aquatic
exercise for people with knee and hip OA. However, several stud-
ies mixed aquatic exercise and balneotherapy and/or mixed par-
ticipants with rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, and/or
OA in knee, hip, and/or other joints. Thus the clarity of the con-
clusion could have been higher if it was possible to distinguish
between participants with knee and hip OA and other diseases,
and between exercise and spa- or balneotherapy (typically passive
treatment).
We have also minimized the risk of bias regarding ’Risk of bias’
assessments and meta-analyses. Five review authors independently
performed the ’Risk of bias’ assessments, and we achieved consen-
sus by discussion. Two review authors independently performed
data extraction and analyses, and resolved any differences by dis-
cussion.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Since the first published version of this Cochrane review (Bartels
2007), two systematic reviews has been published: one focused
solely on people with knee OA and aquatic exercise (Lu 2015) and
one focused on people with lower limb OA and aquatic exercise
(Waller 2014). Both reviews included trials that we also included
in this Cochrane review. The meta-analyses from both reviews
support the effect on pain, function, and quality of life as found
in this Cochrane review.
Many clinicians and patients have noted that there are specific ben-
efits to using aquatic exercise, and that these benefits are substantial
enough to outweigh the inconvenience of performing exercises in
a swimming pool instead of on land (Becker 2009; Bocalini 2010;
Campbell 2003; D’Acquisto 2001; Hall 2008; Meredith-Jones
2011). Several study authors have also argued that aquatic exer-
cise is fundamentally different from exercise on land, and that
the two exercise methods should not be compared directly (Hall
2008; Meredith-Jones 2011). A number of reasons have been given
for this argument. The hydrostatic pressure during immersion in-
creasesthe preloadvolume of bloodinthe rightventricular, leading
to a higher stroke volume (from 70 mL/min to 100 mL/min), and
with this a lower heart rate (Becker 2009). In addition, the VO2
consumption is three times higher in people who do aquatic-based
exercise compared to people who do land-based exercise at the
same intensity (Becker 2009). Compared to land-based exercise,
the same effect on aerobic capacity may therefore be achieved with
aquatic exercise with less exertion (Becker 2009). Surprisingly, the
amount of blood circulated to the muscles during exercise in water
is increased compared to land-based exercise (from 1.8 mL/min/
17

 100 g tissue to 4.1 mL/min/100 g tissue) (Becker 2009), indicating
that exercise in water could be more effective compared to land-
based exercise. For people with painful joints and a low physical
activity level (Farr 2008), an environment stimulating to higher
exercise efficiency with less exertion seems a promising starting
point when wishing to increase physical activity and exercise level.
However, the increased preload of the heart may be dangerous for
people with a heart condition. This effect is present as soon as the
person is immersed in water, even before the exercise starts, and
will further increase the demands on the heart (Asahina 2010).
Swimming pools for aquatic exercise are typically heated to 32°C
to 36°C (89°F to 97°F) to avoid people getting cold, and warm
water may diminish pain. The pain-relieving effect is suggested to
be due to the joint effect of warm water and buoyancy on thermo-
and mechanoreceptors (Hall 2008), or on the effect of warm water
to increase blood flow and thereby reduce signal molecules respon-
sible for activation of nociceptors (Hall 2008). Another effect of
water immersion is due to the hydrostatic pressure, which leads to
smaller peripheral oedema and possibly a decreased sympathicus
activity, leading to pain reduction (Hall 2008). Just by considering
the pain reduction part, it is unsurprising that people with chronic
pain in one or more joints will be more motivated to perform, and
therefore benefit from, aquatic exercise (Hall 2008).
Exercise while immersed in water is fundamentally different from
land-based exercise due to the buoyancy, resistance to movements
in all directions (due to the viscosity of the water), the turbulence
created by the person’s movements, and the hydrostatic pressure
present. The unique environment leads to less load on weight-
bearing joints, a positive disposition towards the exercise because it
is easier to move, activation of more muscles due to the resistance
in all directions, and a greater range of movement due to buoyancy
(Meredith-Jones 2011; Sato 2009). An important aspect is that
the water environment creates fewer adverse events during exercise
(Lund 2008; Takeshima 2002), it reduces a person’s fear of falling
during exercise, and overweight people have reported that they
like to exercise without showing the whole body during exercise
(Takeshima 2002). Considering that a high proportion of people
with OA typically are overweight, all aforementioned aspects could
lead to higher exercise adherence.
Conversely, although buoyancy is a strong argument for choos-
ing aquatic exercise treatment due to the unloading of joints, ex-
ercises involving loading seem to be beneficial for people with
knee OA (Fransen 2008). Furthermore, land-based exercise seems
to improve the quality of knee cartilage (Roos 2005). However,
malalignment or lack of neuromuscular control may lead to focal
overload of the cartilage during land-based exercise. For example,
varus-malalignment, either functional or biomechanical, or both,
leads to a higher load on the medial part of the knee cartilage
(Chang 2004). Improvement of a person’s neuromuscular control
may diminish the malalignment and lead to a more even distribu-
tion of the load on the cartilage. In such cases aquatic exercise is,
due to presence of turbulence in the water and better possibilities
for advanced neuromuscular training, a promising modality. The
choice of exercise type must therefore be decided based on the
individual person’s condition.
As for other exercise programmes, the lack of a long-term effect is
also seen for aquatic exercise (Bocalini 2010). In light of this, the
goal for aquatic exercise should firstly be to help inactive people
with knee or hip OA to increase their daily physical activity, and
maybe even start maintenance of physical training. Furthermore,
the aquatic exercise could be performed with the aim of improving
the person’s neuromuscular control in their lower extremities, and
thereby diminish the deteriorating consequences of OA. However,
one should bear in mind that very few trials measured the long-
term effect, thus the identified lack of effect could be due to the
paucity of trials, and not the lack of effect. Considering the above-
mentioned considerations and benefits of aquatic exercise, aquatic
exercise may be a relevant option for people with knee and hip
OA. An important consideration when designing an exercise pro-
gramme is to define the objectives behind the choice of exercises
in the programme for each participant or group. Aquatic exercise
may therefore be considered as the first part of an exercise ther-
apy programme to introduce disabled people or people with poor
adherence to land-exercise to training. Further physical therapy
interventions may then continue on land, but the balance between
the two types is still unclear based on the available evidence.

Implications for practice
Based upon moderate quality evidence, aquatic exercise has bene-
ficial effects on people with knee or hip OA, or both, i.e. a small
but clinical relevant decrease in pain and disability, and small but
clinical relevant increase in quality of life. The number of RCTs
in this research area is still too few to give further recommenda-
tions on how to use aquatic exercise to treat people with knee or
hip OA, or both. There is a small short-term effect on for people
with either knee and/or hip OA at the end of an aquatic training
programme. We did not find any statistically significant difference
when we analysed this effect for people with hip OA or knee OA
alone, which may be due to the low number of studies on aquatic
exercise. The long-term effect is unclear due to the paucity of stud-
ies.
Implications for research
Further research is needed in order to optimize the use of aquatic
exercise to treat the symptoms of people with well-established knee
and hip OA (according to the American College of Rheumatol-
ogy (ACR) criteria, or other well-established criteria). Participants
shouldatleastbe characterizedbyage, sex,bodymassindex(BMI),
and duration of disease, and classified as having either mild, mod-

 erate, or severe OA in order to establish evidence for which partici-
pants benefit from which exercise programme. These studies must
be properly designed RCTs comparing aquatic exercise with con-
trol treatment, pharmacological treatment or land-based exercise.
The main outcomes must be at least pain, disability, quality of life,
and fatigue, as recommended by OMERACT (Bellamy 1997),
and the effect should be measured immediately after intervention
and after a sufficient follow-up time. These outcome measures
should be supplemented by measuring structural change in order
to monitor the mechanism behind the effect of aquatic exercise.
Furthermore, the interventions need to be sufficiently described
according to type of exercise and dose (intensity, frequency, and
duration) to establish the optimal intervention.

Methods
Randomization: computer-generated random numbers.
Allocation: concealed by using opaque envelopes (generated and prepared by a person
independent of the research project)
Outcome assessor: blinded.
Losses to follow-up: 4 out of 39 participants (10%).
Trial authors did not perform a sufficient ITT analysis.
Participants
Participants responded to public advertisements.
Participants had hip or knee OA.
Participants had to be aged at least 65 years with at least 1 risk factor for falling according
to part 1 of the Falls Risk Assessment Tool, and self-reported OA in the hip or knee, or
both, with clinical signs measured using the WOMAC.
39 participants were randomized to either water-based exercise intervention (N = 23),
or control (N = 16)
Aquatic intervention: 74% female; control: 75% female.
Mean age (SD): aquatic intervention 73.6 years (1.5), control: 75.7 years (1.1)
BMI: not mentioned.
Severity: not mentioned.
Interventions
12-week period of water-based exercise classes held twice weekly at the local municipal
swimming pool. Class exercise progression was standardized and increased from 20
minutes in the first week up to 60 minutes by week 9. A trained water exercise instructor
conducted the exercise classes following a prescribed format. Exercise sessions included
warm-up and warm-down exercises and a series of progressively more challenging balance
exercises
Participants in the control group attended SeniorNet, a community-based computer-
skills training programme offered for older adults by older adults. Control participants
attended twice weekly for 1-hour sessions during a 12-week period and thus were pro-
vided with social interaction seated activity time equivalent to that of the water-based
exercise classes
Outcomes
Measured after intervention at 12 weeks.
Pain: WOMAC (0 to 20).
Disability: WOMAC (0 to 68).
QoL: Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2 (AIMS2-SF-26) (0 to 104)

Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
Low risk
A - Adequate.
A research assistant who did not recruit
participants carried out the allocation se-
quence using a computer-generated ran-
dom number list
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Low risk
A - Adequate.
Randomized after inclusion by a researcher
not involved in inclusion of participants
Blinding (performance bias and detection
bias)
All outcomes
Unclear risk
B - Unclear.
Participant reported pain and disability us-
ing questionnaire. Five blinded outcome
assessors who were nursing students per-
formed outcome assessment
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
All outcomes
Unclear risk
B - Unclear.
Two participants (7%) in the treatment
group and 2 (7%) in the control group did
not complete the trial. The trial authors did
not perform an ITT analysis
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Low risk
A - Adequate.
A large number of outcomes were tested
and no key outcomes were missing
Other bias
Low risk
A - Adequate.

Appendix 1. Search strategies
The search strategies contained the following elements: osteoarthritis/osteoarthrosis, and if possible osteoarthritis of the knee or the
hip, and all reasonable expressions for aquatic therapy, such as hydrotherapy, pool therapy, and water exercise. There was no language
restriction.
Specified search strategies
We used broad search strategies, which created a high proportion of non-relevant references. However, since a wide range of terms have
been used for aquatic exercise over the years, this did, on the other hand, ensure that we retrieved relevant references. We searched for
both osteoarthritis and the more specific ’knee’ or ’hip’ osteoarthritis. This is important to prevent missing important references using
more specific terminology. Aquatic exercise is not clearly indexed in the bibliographic databases, but the aforementioned considerations
ought to have lead to a fairly complete retrieval.
Search strategies
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)
This database was searched following the strategy for search in MEDLINE and EMBASE (see below).

Description
28 April 2015
New search has been performed
We restricted the inclusion criteria to aquatic exercise
compared to a control group, and not compared to other
interventions. Thus we excluded two trials that compared
aquatic exercise to another intervention (Wang 2004;
Wyatt 2001).
We amended the inclusion criteria for types of stud-
ies from both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
quasi-RCTs to RCTs only
As pain and disability is recommended as the main out-
come forpeople with knee andhiposteoarthritis(Bellamy
1997), we focused only on pain and disability in this
Cochrane review update
We have amended the order of review authors and in-
cluded one new review author, CB Juhl
28 April 2015
New citation required but conclusions have not changed
Due to the new literature search, we included nine new
trials in this review update (Arnold 2008; Fransen 2007;
Hale 2012; Hinman 2007; Kim 2012; Lim 2010; Lund
2008; Wang 2006; Wang 2011), and excluded two for-
merly included trials. Thus the number of participants
increased from 800 to 1186 and the number of included
studies increased from 6 to 13. However, the conclusions
did not change

We have made the following changes since the Cochrane protocol was published (Bartels 2005):
1. Authorship: we added CB Juhl to the list of review authors.
2. In order to secure the highest possible quality of included studies, we only included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and no
quasi-RCTs.
3. In order to focus the systematic review, we restricted the research question to compare aquatic exercise vs no intervention, thus
we only included trials with a control group of no specific intervention, i.e. usual care, education, social attention, telephone call, etc.
That lead to an exclusion of two trials included in the first version of this Cochrane review (Bartels 2007): we excluded Wang 2004
because it is a PhD thesis and Wang 2006 is a scientific paper about the same trial. We excluded Wyatt 2001 because it was only a
comparison between land-based and aquatic exercise.
4. Based upon the recommendations from OMERACT (Bellamy 1997), we only included trials using pain, disability, or
radiographics as outcomes.
5. In order to improve the literature search, we also checked the Cochrane’s Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)
database.
6. Acknowledging the difficulties to reach all study authors, we chose not to contact any authors of the included trials to identify
any additional published or unpublished data.
7. In accordance with the Cochrane recommendations, we based the ’Risk of bias’ assessment on the ’Risk of bias’ tool from the
Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
8. We were unable to make a clear distinction between the major types of aquatic exercise, thus we did not perform any analyses of
subcategories involving type of interventions.

 9. Since the publication of the Cochrane protocol, Juhl 2012 has presented a hierarchy of outcomes. Thus, when an included trial
reported more than one pain or disability outcome, we based our choice upon the outcome hierarchy suggested by Juhl 2012.
10. Since there are a large number of different outcomes covering pain and disability, we performed all meta-analyses using random-
effect models and only presented standardized mean difference (SMD) values.
11. In accordance with Cochrane recommendations, we evaluated heterogeneity in all analyses (i.e. both Cochran’s Q test and the I²
statistic test) (Higgins 2011)
12. In accordance with Cochrane recommendations, we assessed the quality of the evidence according to the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (Higgins 2011).
