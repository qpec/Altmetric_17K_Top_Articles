Summary
Background Although some cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines suggest a need to manage work stress in 
patients with established cardiometabolic disease, the evidence base for this recommendation is weak. We sought to 
clarify the status of stress as a risk factor in cardiometabolic disease by investigating the associations between work 
stress and mortality in men and women with and without pre-existing cardiometabolic disease.
Methods In this multicohort study, we used data from seven cohort studies in the IPD-Work consortium, initiated 
between 1985 and 2002 in Finland, France, Sweden, and the UK, to examine the association between work stress and 
mortality. Work stress was denoted as job strain or effort–reward imbalance at work. We extracted individual-level 
data on prevalent cardiometabolic diseases (coronary heart disease, stroke, or diabetes [without differentiation by 
diabetes type]) at baseline. Work stressors, socioeconomic status, and conventional and lifestyle risk factors (systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, smoking status, BMI, physical activity, and alcohol consumption) were 
also assessed at baseline. Mortality data, including date and cause of death, were obtained from national death 
registries. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to study the associations of work stressors with mortality in 
men and women with and without cardiometabolic disease.
Results We identified 102 633 individuals with 1 423 753 person-years at risk (mean follow-up 13·9 years [SD 3·9]), of 
whom 3441 had prevalent cardiometabolic disease at baseline and 3841 died during follow-up. In men with 
cardiometabolic disease, age-standardised mortality rates were substantially higher in people with job strain 
(149·8 per 10 000 person-years) than in those without (97·7 per 10 000 person-years; mortality difference 52·1 per 
10 000 person-years; multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1·68, 95% CI 1·19–2·35). This mortality difference for 
job strain was almost as great as that for current smoking versus former smoking (78·1 per 10 000 person-years) and 
greater than those due to hypertension, high total cholesterol concentration, obesity, physical inactivity, and high 
alcohol consumption relative to the corresponding lower risk groups (mortality difference 5·9–44·0 per 
10 000 person-years). Excess mortality associated with job strain was also noted in men with cardiometabolic disease 
who had achieved treatment targets, including groups with a healthy lifestyle (HR 2·01, 95% CI 1·18–3·43) and 
those with normal blood pressure and no dyslipidaemia (6·17, 1·74–21·9). In all women and in men without 
cardiometabolic disease, relative risk estimates for the work stress–mortality association were not significant, 
apart from effort–reward imbalance in men without cardiometabolic disease (mortality difference 6·6 per 
10 000 person-years; multivariable-adjusted HR 1·22, 1·06–1·41).
Interpretation In men with cardiometabolic disease, the contribution of job strain to risk of death was clinically significant 
and independent of conventional risk factors and their treatment, and measured lifestyle factors. Standard care targeting 
conventional risk factors is therefore unlikely to mitigate the mortality risk associated with job strain in this population.

Introduction
Meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies have shown 
that psychosocial stress might increase the risk of 
cardiovascular disease and diabetes.1–4 The underlying 
pathophysiological mechanisms include disturbed sym-
pathetic-parasympathetic balance and dysregulation of 
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, which can 
accelerate the development of metabolic syndrome and 
lead to left-ventricular dysfunction, dysrhythmia, and 
proinflammatory and procoagulant responses.5,6 Stress 
has also been linked to worsening health-related lifestyle 
factors, such as physical inactivity and increased alcohol 
consumption, and, in people with existing illness, 
suboptimal treatment adherence.6
Although prevention guidelines for cardiovascular 
disease do not prioritise the management of stress in 
the general population,7–9 some guidelines recommend 
stress management for individuals with established

cardio 
vascular disease or major cardiovascular risk 
factors, such as diabetes.7 The rationale for these 
recommendations is that people with cardio 
metabolic 
disease have many more adverse health events than do 
the general population—therefore, assuming that the 
relative risk associated with stress is the same for all 
people exposed, a greater number of adverse events will 
be prevented by targeting those already at high risk. 
However, the evidence base for this recommendation is 
weak, relying on studies of disease incidence1–4,10,11 with 
very few large-scale studies of mortality11–15 and stress in 
patients with cardiometabolic disease.13–17 Importantly, it 
is unknown whether the excess risk associated with 
stress at work and private life can be mitigated by 
controlling conventional risk factors (eg, blood pressure 
and cholesterol concentration) and improving lifestyle 
(eg, physical activity and weight control).
The 
Individual-Participant-Data 
Meta-analysis 
in 
Working Populations (IPD-Work) consortium is the 
largest multicohort research collaboration on work stress 
and clinically verified cardiovascular disease and 
diabetes.1,3,10 In this study, we sought to clarify the status 
of stress as a risk factor in cardiometabolic disease by 
investigating the associations of two common work 
stressors, job strain and effort–reward imbalance, with 
mortality in individuals with pre-existing diabetes or 
coronary heart disease or a history of stroke. For 
comparison, 
we 
examined 
the 
stress–mortality 
association in individuals without these diseases. To 
investigate whether management of conventional and 
lifestyle risk factors is likely to eliminate any excess risk 
associated with work stress, we also assessed the stress–
mortality relation among patients with cardiometabolic 
disease who otherwise had low risk factor levels (ie, were 
normotensive, non-obese, physically active, had normal 
blood cholesterol concentrations, and were not smokers 
or heavy drinkers). If stress was associated with excess 
mortality, even in subgroups of low-risk patients, then 
better stress management might be an improvement on 
standard care.
Methods
Study population
Established in 2008, the objective of the IPD-Work 
Consortium1,10 is to provide a large-scale harmonised 
database for the longitudinal estimation of associations 
between predefined psychosocial working conditions 
and chronic disease outcomes. The participating studies 
comply with the Declaration of Helsinki and were 
approved by local ethics review boards. Informed consent 
was obtained from all participants.
Of the 12 original studies in the IPD-Work Consortium,1 
seven independent cohort studies, initiated between 
1985 and 2002 in Finland (FPS, HeSSup, Still Working), 
France (GAZEL), Sweden (WOLF S, WOLF N) and the 
UK (Whitehall II), had data relevant to the present 
research. From each cohort study, eligible participants 
were those who were employed at the time of the 
baseline assessment, had data for age, sex, job strain, 
effort–reward imbalance at work, and prevalent 
cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and were being 
followed up for mortality. Data were anonymised and

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Work stressors, such as job strain and effort–reward imbalance 
at work, are common sources of stress in adulthood. Work 
stressors have been examined as risk factors for cardiometabolic 
disease, such as coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, 
but few studies are available on their role as prognostic factors 
for these diseases. We searched PubMed and Embase databases 
from inception up to Feb 1, 2018 using the search terms: 
“work stress”, “job stress”, “job strain”, “effort–reward 
imbalance”, and “mortality”, without language restrictions. 
We identified no large-scale studies comparing the association 
between work stressors and mortality in people with and 
without cardiometabolic disease.
Added value of this study
We pooled individual-participant data from seven European 
cohort studies, including a total of 102 633 men and women. 
Job strain was associated with substantial relative and absolute 
increases in mortality risk in men with cardiometabolic disease. 
The mortality difference between groups with and without job 
strain was clinically significant and independent of 
socioeconomic status and several conventional and lifestyle risk 
factors, including hypertension and dyslipidaemia and their 
pharmacological treatments, obesity, smoking, physical 
inactivity, and high alcohol consumption. In absolute terms, the 
difference in age-standardised mortality was greater for current 
smoking versus not smoking than for with versus without job 
strain, but, job strain was associated with a greater mortality 
difference than were high cholesterol, obesity, high alcohol 
consumption, and physical inactivity. In women and 
participants without cardiometabolic disease, the work 
stress–mortality associations were small or absent, both in 
relative and absolute terms.
Implications of all the available evidence
The finding that job strain increases mortality risk, even in 
subgroups of men with cardiometabolic disease but a favourable 
cardiometabolic risk profile, suggests that standard care 
targeting conventional risk factors is unlikely to mitigate the 
mortality risk associated with job strain. Subsequent research 
should employ intervention designs to establish whether 
systematic screening and management of work stressors such as 
job strain would contribute to improved health outcomes in 
men with coronary heart disease, stroke, or diabetes.

available at the individual level. Details of the studies 
included in the present multicohort analysis are 
summarised in the appendix.
Clinical characteristics
Baseline characteristics recorded were age, sex, and 
harmonised measures of smoking (never smoker, 
ex-smoker, or current smoker), alcohol consumption 
(non-drinkers, moderate drinkers [1–14 drinks per week 
for women and 1–21 drinks per week for men], and heavy 
drinkers [>14 drinks per week for women and >21 drinks 
per week for men]), leisure-time physical activity 
(none or very little, moderate, or vigorous physical 
activity or exercise), BMI (<18·5 kg/m² [underweight], 
18·5–24·9 kg/m² [normal weight], 25–29·9 kg/m² 
[overweight], or ≥30 kg/m² [obese]), and socioeconomic 
status (high, intermediate, or low, defined on the basis of 
an occupational title or, in the HeSSup study, a 
participant’s highest educational qualification).1 In three 
studies (Whitehall II, WOLF S, and WOLF N), assess-
ments of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and 
total cholesterol concentration were also available.1 In 
four studies (FPS, HeSSup, WOLF S, and WOLF N), it 
was pos 
sible to assess prescriptions in participants with 
diabetes, coronary heart disease, or stroke by linkage to 
pre 
scription registers during the baseline year. Pre 
scrip-
tions for antidiabetes (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
[ATC] code A10), antihypertensive (ATC C02, C03, 
C07–C09), lipid-lowering (ATC C10AA), and anticoag-
ulation (ATC B01) medications were considered to 
indicate adherence.
Work stress
Analyses were based on two indicators of work stress: 
job demand–control (ie, job strain) and effort–reward 
imbalance at work. Reports from the IPD-Work 
consortium are based on predefined, harmonised, and 
validated definitions of work stress. The psychometric 
properties of these data were published before the 
extraction of outcome data.18,19 Job strain, referring to a 
combination of high demands and low control at work, 
was measured with sets of questions from the validated 
Job Content Questionnaire and Demand-Control 
Questionnaire, which were included in the baseline 
self-report questionnaire of all of seven studies.18 Using 
both questionnaires, we defined high job demands as 
having a job-demand score that was greater than the 
study-specific median score; similarly, we defined low 
job control as having a job control score that was lower 
than the study-specific median score. The Pearson 
correlations between the harmonised scales used in this 
study and complete versions of the Job Content 
Questionnaire and Demand Control Questionnaire all 
had r greater than 0·9, apart from one study in which 
r was 0·8.18 In the present analyses, the exposure was 
defined as job strain versus no job strain according to 
the job strain model.1
The Effort–Reward Imbalance at Work questionnaire at 
baseline included items on work demands and efforts (the 
effort items) and monetary and non-monetary rewards at 
work (the reward items). Different questionnaire versions 
were harmonised and validated across the constituent 
studies before the mortality analyses.19 Pearson correlation 
coefficients between the harmonised scales used in 
this study and complete versions of the Effort–Reward 
Imbalance questionnaire were high: r was greater than 
0·9 for the effort scales and greater than 0·8 for the 
reward scales.19 For each participant, mean response 
scores were calculated separately for the effort and reward 
items. We constructed a ratio of the two scores to quantify 
the degree of mismatch between effort and rewards. The 
effort–reward ratio was dichotomised at a cutoff point of 1 
with a ratio greater than 1 indicating effort–reward 
imbalance and a ratio of 1 or lower indicating no effort–
reward imbalance at work.19
To examine the combined effects of job strain and 
effort–reward imbalance, we constructed a three-level 
exposure variable, where 0 represented no job strain or 
effort–reward imbalance, 1 represented either job strain or 
effort–reward imbalance (not both), and 2 represented both 
job strain and effort–reward imbalance.2 More details of the 
work stress measurements are provided in the appendix.
Baseline cardiometabolic disease
Baseline (existing) cardiometabolic diseases included 
common causes of death: coronary heart disease, stroke, 
and diabetes (without distinguishing between types of 
diabetes). Coronary heart disease was ascertained from 
national hospital admission records and discharge 
registries (participants were linked to these registers with 
individual identification numbers) and denoted with 
version 10 of the International Classification of Diseases 
(ICD; codes I21–I22 or the corresponding ICD-9 or 
ICD-8 codes),1 or clinical examination with the MONICA 
definition (Whitehall II).20 Agreement between the 
national hospital admission records and clinical exami-
nations for coronary heart disease has been shown to be 
high (sensitivity 70% and specificity >95%, with clinical 
examination used as the gold standard ascer 
tainment 
method).21 We identified history of stroke using 
self-reported doctor-diagnosed events, event tracing, and 
linkage to national hospital admission records (ICD-10 
codes I60, I61, I63, I64).10 Prevalent diabetes was defined 
with information from any of the following data sources: 
hospital admission records with ICD-10 diagnoses 
(E10, E11; all studies apart from Whitehall II), antidiabetes 
drug reimbursements (only FPS, Still Working, and 
HeSSup),3 or 2 h oral glucose tolerance test (WHO criteria) 
complemented by self-report of diabetes diagnosis and 
medication (Whitehall II).22
Mortality follow-up
Mortality data, including date and cause of death, were 
obtained from national death registries. In each study,

participants were linked to mortality records using their 
unique identification numbers. Because these records do 
not include date of death for people who emigrate and 
die abroad, such participants were flagged as emigrants 
 
and censored at the date of emigration.
Statistical analysis
Means and SDs were calculated according to cardio-
metabolic disease status at baseline (prevalent coronary 
heart disease, stroke, or diabetes vs none of these 
diseases). Each participant was followed up from the date 
of the assessment of their work stressors and prevalent 
cardiometabolic disease to the earliest event out of death, 
loss to follow-up, or end of follow-up (maximum 
20 years). We computed time to death to obtain 
age-adjusted incidence rates per 10 000 person-years in 
men and women in the pooled dataset. We used Cox 
proportional hazards regression to study the associations

of work stressors (job strain and effort–reward imbalance 
at work) with mortality in men and women with and 
without cardiometabolic disease. Bonferroni correction 
was used to compensate for multiple testing (a total of 
eight tests from two stressors, two cardiometabolic 
disease statuses, and two sexes). Minimally adjusted 
models included age and study as covariates. Multi-
variable models were also adjusted for socioeconomic 
status, BMI category, smoking status, alcohol con-
sumption, physical activity and, in a subgroup analysis 
of cohort studies with relevant data, blood pressure and 
total cholesterol concentration. Interactions with age 
were tested by grouping participants by age (<45 years, 
45–54 years, and >55 years). Heterogeneity in study-
specific estimates was examined by repeating the main 
analyses with a two-step procedure, with separate 
analyses in each cohort study and then pooling of the 
study-specific hazard ratios by use of random-effects 
meta-analysis.
Robustness of the association between work stressors 
and mortality in subgroups was tested in analyses 
stratified by number of lifestyle risk factors (zero, one, or 
two or more from current smoking, physical inactivity, 
obesity, and high alcohol consumption). To examine 
whether any effect of job strain is present in individuals 
with cardiometabolic disease but an otherwise low-risk 
profile, we assessed the association between work 
stressors and mortality in subgroups of participants who 
had met treatment targets—ie, they had adhered to 
pharmacotherapy, had normal blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg), and normal 
fasting total cholesterol concentration (<6·2 mmol/L 
and, in sensitivity analysis, <5·0 mmol/L). To minimise 
residual confounding, systolic blood pressure and total 
cholesterol concentration, treated as continuous variables, 
were added to the model as covariates.
In further analyses, we examined the association of 
exposure to neither, either, or both of the work stressors 
with mortality and the associations of obesity, current 
smoking, high alcohol consumption, and physical 
inactivity with mortality.
All analyses were done with SAS statistical software 
version 9.4. Statistical significance was inferred at a 
two-sided p value less than 0·05.

Results
105 284 people were recruited into the seven studies 
between 1985 and 2002. Of the eligible population, 
102 663 participants had data on prevalent cardiometabol-
ic disease, at least one of the work stressors (job strain 
or effort–reward imbalance), and mortality, and were 
therefore included in this study (figure 1). Characterist-
ics were similar between the eligible and included 
populations in terms of the proportion of men (43·5% in 
eligible vs 43·4% in enrolled participants), mean age 
(44·0 years vs 43·9 years), and proportion of participants 
of low-socioeconomic status (26·2% vs 25·8%).
Mean follow-up for mortality was 13·9 years (SD 3·9). 
During 1 423 753 person-years at risk, we identified 
3841 deaths, of which 397 were among the 3441 individuals 
with cardiometabolic disease at baseline. Of the 1975 men 
with cardiometabolic disease at baseline, 396 had a 
history of coronary heart disease, 214 had stroke, 1425 had 
diabetes, 54 had two of these disorders, and three had all 
three. Of the 1466 women with cardiometabolic 
disease at baseline, 73 had a history of coronary heart 
disease, 153 had stroke, 1266 had diabetes, 18 had 
two of these disorders, and four had all three (appendix).
In men without cardiometabolic disease at baseline, 
effort–reward imbalance was associated with an in-
creased risk of mortality (mortality difference 6·6 per 
10 000 person-years), and this association remained after 
multivariable adjustment and correction for multiple 
testing (table 1). There was no significant heterogeneity

in the study-specific estimates (I²=0%, p=0·44; appendix) 
or interaction with age (p=0·10). In absolute terms, the 
difference in mortality between those with and without 
effort–reward imbalance was smaller than those related 
to conventional lifestyle factors, such as smoking, 
physical inactivity, and obesity (appendix). In women 
without cardiometabolic disease at baseline, effort–
reward imbalance was not associated with mortality 
(table 1). Job strain alone (table 1 and figure 2A), or in 
combination with effort–reward imbalance (appendix), 
was not associated with mortality in men or women 
without cardiometabolic disease.
In men with cardiometabolic disease at baseline, job 
strain was associated with an increased risk of mortality 
that remained after multivariable adjustment and cor-
rection for multiple testing (table 1). The age-adjusted 
mortality rate per 10 000 person-years was 149·8 in men 
with job strain and 97·7 in those without (risk difference 
52·1 per 10 000; figure 2B). The excess mortality risk in 
men with cardiometabolic disease who reported job 
strain was apparent across the entire follow-up period, 
rather than becoming apparent only in the early or late 
phases of the follow-up (figure 2C), and was robust to 
adjustment for lifestyle risk factors (smoking status, 
alcohol consumption, physical activity, BMI, and 
socioeconomic status; table 1). There was no significant 
heterogeneity in study-specific estimates (I²=0%, p=0·96; 
appendix) or difference in the association between age 
groups (pinteraction=0·62). After further adjustment for 
blood pressure and total cholesterol in the subgroup 
of participants with these data available, the HR for 
job strain compared with no job strain was 1·84 
(95% CI 1·06–3·18; p=0·029; 94 deaths among 
569 participants). In analyses of cause-specific mortality, 
job strain had a minimally adjusted (study and age) HR 
of 1·71 (95% CI 1·08–2·71; p=0·02) for risk of mortality 
from cardiovascular disease (appendix), but no robust 
associations were observed with cancer mortality or 
non-cardiovascular, non-cancer mortality. Effort–reward 
imbalance seemed to be associated with lower risk of 
death in men with previous cardiometabolic disease, but 
this association was lost after correction for multiple 
testing (table 1).
In women with cardiometabolic disease at baseline, the 
age-adjusted death rates per 10 000 were 64·0 for job 
strain and 53·2 for no job strain (difference 10·8 per 
10 000; figure 2) and mortality was not significantly 
associated with job strain or effort–reward imbalance 
(table 1). Job strain in combination with effort–reward 
imbalance was not associated with mortality in men or 
women with cardiometabolic disease (appendix).
To examine the relative importance of job strain as a risk 
factor for mortality in men with cardiometabolic disease, 
we compared death rates associated with job strain with 
those associated with established risk factors. The mortality 
difference between men with and without job strain 
(52·1 per 10 000) was almost the same as that for current 
smokers versus never or former smokers (78·1 per 10 000), 
and higher than those for the presence of hypertension, 
high total cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity, and high 
alcohol consumption (5·9–44·0 per 10 000; figure 3). 
Furthermore, job strain was associated with a two to six 
times higher risk of mortality in subgroups of men with 
cardio 
metabolic disease but favourable risk factor profiles, 
including participants who were not obese, physically 
inactive, smokers, or heavy drinkers (table 2) and 
normotensive participants, those with no dyslipidaemia, 
and those who adhered to antihyper 
tensive, lipid-lowering, 
or anticoagulation treatments, according to prescription 
records (figure 4). Additional adjustments did not alter 
these findings (appendix).
Discussion
Evidence from our pooling of individual-participant data 
from seven European cohort studies suggests that job 
strain is a risk factor for mortality in men with 
cardiometabolic disease, as defined by the presence of 
coronary heart disease, stroke, or diabetes. The mortality 
difference between groups with and without job strain

was clinically significant and independent of socio-
economic status, the conventional and lifestyle risk factors 
measured (current smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, 
high alcohol consumption, hypertension, dyslipidaemia), 
and pharmacotherapy. This finding is unlikely to be 
attributable to type I error due to multiple testing because 
it was robust to correction for multiple comparisons. 
In absolute terms, the difference in age-standardised 
mortality among men with cardiometabolic diseases was 
greater between current and non-smokers than between 
men with and without job strain. However, high 
cholesterol, obesity, high alcohol consumption, and 
physical inactivity were associated with smaller mortality 
differences than job strain.
Our findings agree with those of a study of patients with 
acute myocardial infarction from the USA, in which 
individuals who reported life stress had higher mortality 
than those free of life stress (HR 1·4, 95% CI 1·2–1·8)14 
and the few previous, small-scale prognostic studies on 
patients with cardiovascular disease,23–26 which in com-
bination suggest a 1·6 times (95% 1·2–2·2) increased 
risk of recurrent events associated with job strain.17 The 
observed associations are also biologically plausible. The 
stress hormone cortisol stimulates glucose production 
in the liver and antagonises the action of insulin in 
peripheral tissues—both processes have the potential to 
contribute to worse prognoses in people with diabetes.5,6 
Stress can also have adverse effects on cardiometabolic 
systems by inducing transient endothelial dysfunction, 
myocardial ischaemia, and cardiac arrhythmia and thus 
increasing the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiac events.6
To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to 
examine the work stress–mortality association stratified 
by cardio 
metabolic risk profile. Our data showed that 
job strain substantially increased mortality risk even in 
subgroups of men with prevalent cardiometabolic 
disease but a favourable cardiometabolic risk profile, 
suggesting that standard care targeting conventional and 
lifestyle risk factors (eg, blood pressure, lipids, smoking, 
obesity, physical inactivity) does not necessarily mitigate 
the excess mortality risk associated with job strain. The 
European prevention guidelines7 and the American 
Heart Association policy statements8 highlight psycho-
social stress as a potential barrier to healthy lifestyles and 
optimal medication adherence, and recommend manage-
ment of stress in individuals with high cardiovascular 
risk or established cardiovascular disease. Our findings 
are consistent with these recommendations, but also 
suggest that harmful effects of stress in men were not 
attributable to the lifestyle risk factors measured or poor 
adherence to pharmacotherapy; excess mortality risk 
was observed even among patients successfully treated 
for cardiometabolic disease who were normotensive, 
non-obese, physically active, had normal blood cholesterol, 
and were not smokers or heavy drinkers.
There are various ways of expanding standard care to 
address work stress in patients, including systematic 
screening for stress and, if needed, interventions such as 
consultation, rehabilitation, job redesign, reductions in 
working hours, and retirement on health grounds.6,7 In a 
Cochrane review of 35 randomised controlled trials 
including a total of 10 703 patients with coronary heart 
disease who had at least 6 months’ follow-up, psycho-
logical interventions that alleviated stress and other 
psychological symptoms were successful in reducing 
cardiac mortality for people with coronary heart disease.27 
However, it is unclear whether those inter 
ventions would 
benefit men with job strain and cardiometabolic disease.
For other groups stress-related differences in mortality 
were small or absent, both in relative and absolute 
terms. In working-aged women with cardiometabolic 
disease, for example, job strain was not associated with a

significant increase in mortality risk and the absolute 
mortality difference between those with and without 
job strain was only 10·8 per 10 000 person-years (for 
comparison, the corresponding mortality difference 
in men was 52·1 per 10 000 person-years). Similarly, 
effort–reward imbalance was not associated with 
increased mortality in men or women with cardio-
metabolic disease, suggesting that job strain and 
effort–reward imbalance are of different prognostic 
value. Job strain encompasses only external sources of 
stress, whereas effort–reward imbalance also involves 
the individual’s own behaviours. People with more 
severe cardiometabolic disease tend to shorten their 
working hours as a consequence of their condition, 
thus potentially reducing any effort–reward imbalance 
through reduced effort.10,28 This change could mitigate 
the link between effort–reward imbalance and mortality. 
By contrast, external characteristics of work that relate to 
job strain remain unchanged after the onset of disease. 
Finally, as expected, in healthy people work stress did 
not substantially increase mortality risk, although in 
men free of cardiometabolic disease, we observed a 
moderate association between effort–reward imbalance 
and risk of death.
Our study benefits from a large sample size, predefined 
exposure assessment, coverage of several European 
countries, and a mortality outcome assessed via record 
linkage with very little loss to follow-up. The limitations of 
our study include the use of a single measurement of 
work stressors and risk factors, which does not include 
any measure of chronicity or change over time. There is 
also the possibility that prevalent cardiometabolic disease 
was underestimated in those studies with no measures 
of undiagnosed diabetes and cardiovascular disease 
(eg, silent myocardial infarctions). These drawbacks could 
contribute to an underestimation or overestimation of 
associations with mortality. We adjusted the associations 
for several conventional and lifestyle risk factors, but data 
for blood pressure and blood cholesterol concentration 
were not available in all the studies. This limitation could 
lead to overestimation of the status of job strain as an 
independent predictor of mortality, although there was no 
evidence to support this possibility in supplementary 
analyses of the three cohort studies with relevant data. We 
did not have detailed data on the duration or severity of 
the cardiometabolic diseases. Several factors that are more 
common in individuals with stress that can precipitate a 
fatal cerebrovascular or cardiovascular event, or otherwise 
increase risk of premature death, were not covered by 
our baseline measurement. These include, for example, 
stress-induced ischaemia, cardiac arrhyth 
mia, low-grade 
systemic inflammation, increased blood viscosity, platelet 
activation and increases in the levels of coagulation 
and fibrinolytic factors, short and long sleep durations 
and sleep disorders, and reduced self-care.6,29,30 Further 
research is needed to establish the role of such factors in 
the excess mortality risk seen in men with job strain and 
cardiometabolic disease and to examine mechanisms 
underlying the observed sex differences in the effects of 
job strain.
In conclusion, the results of this large pan-European 
study suggest that in men with cardiometabolic disease, 
the contribution of job strain to risk of death is clinically 
significant and independent of conventional risk factors 
and their treatment, as well as the lifestyle factors 
measured. Subsequent research should employ inter-
vention designs to establish whether systematic screening 
and management of work stressors, such as job strain, 
would contribute to improved health outcomes in men 
with prevalent coronary heart disease, stroke, or diabetes.
