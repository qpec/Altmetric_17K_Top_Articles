 Abstract
To identify common alleles associated with different histotypes of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), 
we pooled data from multiple genome-wide genotyping projects totaling 25,509 EOC cases and 
40,941 controls. We identified nine new susceptibility loci for different EOC histotypes: six for 
serous EOC histotypes (3q28, 4q32.3, 8q21.11, 10q24.33, 18q11.2 and 22q12.1), two for 
mucinous EOC (3q22.3, 9q31.1) and one for endometrioid EOC (5q12.3). We then meta-analysed 
the results for high-grade serous ovarian cancer with the results from analysis of 31,448 BRCA1 
and BRCA2 mutation carriers, including 3,887 mutation carriers with EOC. This identified an 
additional three loci at 2q13, 8q24.1 and 12q24.31. Integrated analyses of genes and regulatory 
biofeatures at each locus predicted candidate susceptibility genes, including OBFC1, a novel 
susceptibility gene for low grade/borderline serous EOC.
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a heterogeneous disease commonly classified into five 
major histotypes of invasive disease 1- (high grade serous (HGSOC), low grade serous 
(LGSOC), mucinous (MOC), endometrioid (ENOC) and clear cell carcinoma (CCOC)) - 
and two histotypes of borderline disease – serous and mucinous. The histotypes have 
differences in lifestyle and genetic risk factors, precursor lesions, patterns of spread, 
molecular events during oncogenesis, response to chemotherapy, and prognosis. HGSOC are 
thought to be derived from fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells through foci of 
endosalpingiosis existing as inclusion cysts lined with tubal epithelium at the ovarian and 
peritoneal surface2. In contrast, CCOC, ENOC, and sero-endometrioid carcinomas appear to 
develop from endometriosis 3,4. MOC resembles adenocarcinoma of the gastric pylorus, 
intestine, or endocervix and the majority of these tumors show gastrointestinal 
differentiation 5.
Approximately 20% of the familial component of EOC risk is attributable to high-to-
intermediate risk genes 6. An unknown fraction is due to more common, lower risk genetic 
variation 7. In European populations, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have 
identified 23 EOC susceptibility alleles including 18 common variants associated with all 
histologies and/or serous EOC 8-15, one with borderline serous tumors 13, three with 
MOC 16 and one with CCOC 12. The majority of these loci also showed associations 
(p<0.05) with EOC risk for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers 15. Five additional loci 
associated with EOC and breast and/or prostate cancer have been identified17; three of these 
were associated with susceptibility to EOC, breast and prostate cancers, and two were 
associated only with breast and EOC risk. However, the common genetic variants explain 
only 3.9% of the inherited component of EOC risk 15 and additional susceptibility loci are 
likely to exist, particularly for the less common, non-serous histotypes.
We designed a custom Illumina array named the ‘OncoArray’, in order to identify new 
cancer susceptibility loci18. The OncoArray includes ~533,000 variants (of which 260,660 
formed a GWAS backbone) and has been used to genotype over 500,000 samples, including 
EOC case-control studies of the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC) and 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers of the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of 
BRCA1/2 (CIMBA). These data were combined with genotype data from the Collaborative 
Oncological Gene-environment Study (COGS) project 14,19 and three EOC GWAS 8,9. We

 present the results of these association analyses together with functional annotation of the 
new genome-wide significant EOC susceptibility loci.
Results
Association analyses
Genetic association analyses were performed using genotype data from 25,509 population-
based EOC cases and 40,941 controls from OCAC and meta-analysis of these data with 
19,036 BRCA1 and 12,412 BRCA2 mutation carriers from CIMBA, of whom 2,933 and 
954, respectively, were affected with EOC. The numbers of participants by study for OCAC 
and CIMBA are shown in Supplementary table 1 and Supplementary table 2, respectively.
We used data from the 1000 Genomes Project 20 reference panel to impute genotypes for 
11,403,952 common variants (MAF>1%) and evaluated the associations of these SNPs with 
EOC risk. In OCAC alone, nine histotypes were investigated (all invasive, serous invasive, 
HGSOC, LGSOC, serous borderline, LGSOC and serous borderline combined, ENOC, 
CCOC and MOC). Association analyses revealed six novel loci associated with serous EOC 
histotypes at genome-wide significance (p<5×10-8): rs9870207 at 3q28, rs13113999 at 
4q32.3, rs150293538 at 8q21.11, rs7902587 at 10q24.33, rs8098244 at 18q11.2 and 
rs6005807 at 22q12.1. Five of these loci were associated with borderline serous EOC (3q28, 
4q32.3, 8q21.11, 10q24.33 and 18q11.2) and four with LGSOC tumors (3q28, 8q21.11, 
10q24.33 and 18q11.2) (Table 1). We also identified two loci associated with MOC 
(rs112071820 at 3q22.3 and rs320203 at 9q31.1) and one locus associated with ENOC 
(rs555025179 at 5q12.3). The meta-analysis of OCAC and CIMBA revealed three additional 
serous EOC loci (rs2165109 at 2q13; rs9886651 at 8q24.21; rs7953249 at 12q24.31). The 
8q24.21 SNP rs9886651 is close to two SNPs previously associated with serous EOC 9 (and 
Gjyshi A, Mendoza-Fandino G, Tyrer J, Woods NT, Lawrenson K et al., personal 
communication). Multi-variable analysis of OCAC data showed that this is a third 
independent-associated variant in this region (unadjusted OR = 1.07, OR adjusted for 
rs1400482 and rs13255292 =1.07). Variant rs6005807 at 22q12.1 was previously reported to 
be associated with serous EOC at sub-genome-wide significance 21.
The association of the top SNP in each region with the nine EOC histotypes studied with 
EOC risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers is shown in Figure 1. Four SNPs, rs8098244 
(18q11.2), rs2165109 (2q13), rs9886651 (8q24.21), rs7953249 (12q24.31) showed 
associations with EOC risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers and one SNP, rs9886651 (8q24.21) 
showed an association with risk for BRCA2 carriers (P<0.05)
Eighteen of the 23 previously published loci were associated with the same histotype at 
genome-wide significance (excluding the 5 pleitropic loci published by Kar et al, 
Supplementary table 3). Of these, 11 showed an association with EOC risk for BRCA1 
mutation carriers and eight showed an association with risk for BRCA2 carriers (P<0.05). 
There was significant heterogeneity of risk between the five main, non-overlapping 
histotypes (high grade serous, low grade/borderline serous, endometrioid, clear cell and 
invasive/borderline mucinous) for 28 of the 40 new and previously published loci 
(Supplementary table 3).

 We carried out a competing-risks association analysis in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation 
carriers in order to investigate whether the observed associations with ovarian cancer in 
mutation carriers are influenced by associations with breast cancer risk. For this we used the 
most significantly associated genotyped SNPs for this 22. The EOC HR estimates were 
consistent with the estimates from the main analysis for all SNPs (results not shown). Some 
evidence suggested that rs7953249 at 12q24.31 was associated with reduced breast cancer 
risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR=0.95, 95%CI 0.91-0.99, p=0.034) and that SNP 
rs2165109 at 2q13 was associated with increased breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation 
carriers (HR=1.08, 95%CI 1.01-1.14, p=0.02). When these associations were analyzed by 
tumor estrogen-receptor status, the associations for the two SNPs were restricted to ER-
negative breast for BRCA1 (p=0.026 for rs7953249) and BRCA2 (p=0.02 for rs2165109) 
mutation carriers.
Association analyses adjusted for the most significant SNP in each region (including 3 
independent SNPs at 8q24.21) did not reveal any additional independent association signals 
in these regions. At the 12 new EOC risk regions, 571 SNPs were deemed potentially causal 
(Supplementary table 4) and carried forward for functional annotation, eQTL and mQTL 
analyses.
Functional and molecular analyses
Of the 571 candidate causal variants in the 12 novel loci, 562 variants are located in non-
coding DNA sequences and may influence the expression of nearby target genes 23. We used 
a variety of in silico approaches to identify putative, tissue-specific, regulatory biofeatures 
and candidate susceptibility genes associated with risk SNPs at each locus. For the few risk-
associated, non-synonymous variants in protein coding genes, we also evaluated predicted 
effects on protein function.
Functional annotation of candidate causal alleles—We mapped the set of 562 non-
protein coding candidate causal SNPs at the 12 susceptibility loci to regulatory biofeatures, 
using a variety of epigenomic marks profiled in normal and cancer tissues relevant to the 
cellular origins of different ovarian cancer histotypes (Supplementary table 5). The cell types 
interrogated included: (1) fallopian tube (FT33; FT246) and ovarian surface epithelial cell 
lines (IOSE4; IOSE11) for serous precursor tissues; (2) serous-related cancer cell lines 
including HGSOC cell lines (UWB1.289; CaOV3) and a LGSOC cell line (OAW42); (3) 
endometriosis epithelial cells (EEC16), as a likely precursor of ENOC; (4) cell types 
relevant to MOC, including MOC cell lines (GTFR230; MCAS) and both colonic normal 
(colon crypt) and cancer tissues (HCT116; HeLa-S3). The epigenomic marks annotated 
were open chromatin, identified using formaldehyde assisted isolation of regulatory element 
sequencing (FAIRE-seq) and DNase I hypersensitivity sequencing (DNase-seq) and 
chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of histone modifications, specifically 
histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac, which denotes active chromatin) and histone H3 
lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1, which marks active and poised enhancers). SNPs 
were also intersected with ENCODE transcription factor ChIPseq data. All tissue types were 
evaluated for all risk loci. The SNP-biofeature intersections by tissue type are illustrated in 
Figure 2 and Supplementary table 6.

 Nine (1.6%) of the 571 candidate causal SNPs lie in protein coding sequences. Five of these 
are synonymous and four are non-synonymous but predicted to be benign by Polyphen-2 
(Supplementary table 6). Four SNPs lie within untranslated regions of protein-coding genes 
and so could affect mRNA stability: rs1051149 and rs1051150 in the 3’ UTR of LAMA3 
and rs12327412 in the 5’ UTR of TTC39C, all at the 18q11.2 locus; and rs1018128 in the 3’ 
UTR of GMNC at 3q28. The majority of biofeature-SNP intersections (n=166, 29% of all 
candidate causal SNPs and 97% of candidate causal SNPs overlapping a biofeature) were for 
SNPs lying within active chromatin, and/or open chromatin. Eleven SNPs lie in the 
promoters of four genes (PVT1, HNF1A, TTC39C and TTC28) (Supplementary Table 6).
At six serous risk loci (4q32.3; 3q28; 8q21; 18q11; 8q24; 22q12) we observed extensive 
SNP-biofeature overlaps, particularly in serous-related tissue types. In contrast, the two 
MOC susceptibility loci (3q22.3, 9q31.1) were biofeature-poor regions and showed little or 
no SNP-biofeature intersections in any of the tissue types under investigation, including 
MOC and ENCODE cell lines. At the endometrioid EOC risk locus (5q12.3) we observed 
enhancers in endometriosis, ovarian, fallopian and EOC cell types flanking the small number 
risk associated SNPs (n=8), none of which coincided with regulatory elements.
Several studies have shown that common variant susceptibility alleles are significantly 
enriched for regulatory elements detected in disease-relevant tissue types. Therefore we 
tested for enrichment of SNP-H3K27ac intersections at each locus because H3K27ac was 
the most comprehensively profiled regulatory feature across different tissue types 
(Supplementary table 7). At the 12q24.31 locus a large region of active chromatin spanning 
the HNF1A promoter drove a strong enrichment for risk SNP-H3K27ac intersects in the 
OAW42 LGSOC cell line (P=4.45×10-22). At 10q24.33 (which is associated with LGSOC 
and borderline SOC) we identified a significant enrichment of acetylated H3K27 in normal 
fallopian cells (FT33 P=1.09×10-4, FT246 P=4.29×10-3), HGSOC ovarian cancer cells 
(UWB1.289 P=6.23×10-3), MOC cells (GTFR230 P=5.16×10-3) as well as, somewhat 
surprisingly, colorectal cancer cells (HCT116 P=2.64×10-4) and cervical cancer cells (HeLa-
S3 P=9.60×10-12). This locus contains several clusters of H3K27ac activity and TF binding 
in ovarian and ENCODE datasets, and these highly active regions showed extensive overlap 
with candidate causal alleles (Figure 3).
Identifying candidate susceptibility gene targets at risk loci—We used several 
approaches to identify candidate target genes at the 12 risk loci. First, we hypothesized that 
target genes underlying disease susceptibility are more likely to display prevalent copy 
number alterations in ovarian tumor tissues. Amplifications were the most frequent 
alteration at 6 of the 12 susceptibility loci (Supplementary figure 1). Contiguous genes were 
commonly amplified in the same sample indicating segmental amplifications (data not 
shown). HNF1A, ORAI1, CHEK2, XPB1, BUB1, and FOXL2 are found inside the same 
topologically associating domain (TAD) as candidate causal SNPs and have been previously 
implicated in ovarian cancer development (Supplementary figure 2). Notably, HNF1A, 
ORAI1, and FOXL2 are amplified in >5% of EOC samples. No TAD was identified for 
8q24.21; but MYC and PVT1 appear to be the targets for multiple enhancer elements 
containing independent EOC risk associations for HGSOC at this locus (Gjyshi et al., 
personal communication).

 We also performed expression and methylation quantitative trait locus (eQTL and mQTL) 
analyses in several data sets comprising methylation/expression profiling and germline 
genotyping in relevant tumor tissues (see Methods). For eQTL analyses, we evaluated 
associations between the candidate causal SNPs and all genes profiled within 1 Mb of the 
index risk SNP at each locus, since this window will contain most cis-eQTL associations 23. 
Results of the eQTL analyses in each data set were adjusted for tumor copy number and 
methylation status 24 and a meta-analysis of the two HGSOC data sets from TCGA and the 
Mayo Clinic are shown in Supplementary table 8-11. The most significant eQTL 
associations in both HGSOC data sets were identified between the candidate causal risk 
SNPs at the 10q24.33 risk locus and OBFC1 expression (TCGA-rs11597399 - P = 3.1 × 
10-10; Mayo-rs7902587- P = 4.0 × 10-4; meta-analysis-rs34379047- P = 2.1 × 10-11). The 
risk (T) allele was associated with reduced OBFC1 expression in both data sets (Figure 3d). 
We then evaluated all SNPs at this locus (not just the candidate causal SNPs) for eQTL 
associations; the SNPs with the most significant eQTL associations for OBFC1 were also 
candidate causal SNPs for the risk association, reinforcing OBFC1 as the target gene. No 
expression associations were identified at P < 10-4 for the candidate causal risk SNPs at any 
other locus in the eQTL meta-analysis. Thirty-two ENOC samples were used to conduct an 
eQTL analysis focused on the 5q13.1 ENOC risk locus but this did not reveal any 
associations at P < 0.05 (Supplementary table 10).
Methylation QTL analyses were restricted to the set of 67 CpGs with the most significant 
association with decreased expression of the 74 genes of interest (within a 1Mb region of the 
index SNP) in the 12 regions. Results are presented for the most significant mQTL 
associations for each SNP based on the reduced set of CpGs (Supplementary table 12). We 
identified two regions with mQTL associations at P<0.005. At 2q13, the risk allele [G] of 
rs56226558 was associated with reduced methylation of the CpG cg21469370 (p=1.4 × 
10-3), with methylation being associated with reduced expression of BCL211 (p=1.1×10-6) 
even though cg21469370 lies in the gene body of ACOXL. At 3q22.3, the risk allele [C] of 
rs68088905 was associated with reduced methylation of the CpG cg06726820 in the 
promoter of RBP1 (mQTL p = 4.9 × 10-3). Methylation was strongly associated with 
reduced RBP1 expression (p=1.7×10-36). We found no highly significant mQTL associations 
for genes at any other locus, and the eQTL SNP at 10q24.33 was not association with DNA 
methylation.
SNPs in the 10q24.33 locus revealed the most significant eQTL with expression of the 
OBFC1 gene. The most significant eQTL SNPs also showed the most epigenetic marks, 
including rs35007589 (eQTL p-value 2.3×10-11), rs35176048 (eQTL p-value 2.6 ×10-11) 
and rs34685262 (eQTL p-value 3.8 ×10-11). These SNPs intersect regions of open 
chromatin, H3K27ac and H3K4me1 signal in normal ovarian and fallopian tube epithelial 
cells and, for rs35176048 and rs34685262, in HGSOC cell lines. These enhancers are not 
specific to ovarian cell types. At this locus, 11 candidate causal SNPs are predicted by 
motifbreakR 25 to alter transcription factor binding sites, of which 8 are predicted to have a 
strong effect on TF binding (Supplementary table 13). Of particular interest, rs2488000 
(eQTL p-value = 1.4 × 10-10) is predicted in silico to strongly impact the binding of CTCF, a 
ubiquitously expressed transcriptional regulator that plays a key role in insulator function 
and chromatin structure (Figure 3c). Furthermore in ENCODE there is evidence from

 ChIPseq experiments that CTCF does bind at this location in monocytes. Other SNPs 
predicted to have a strong effect on the binding of other cancer-relevant TFs are rs11813268 
(ETS1), rs7907606 (FOXP1) and rs2995264 (IRF8) (Supplementary table 13).
At 8q24.21, the candidate causal variants span a region of ~20kb that includes the promoter 
and first exon of PVT1, an oncogenic long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with known roles in 
breast and ovarian cancer 26. The 8q24 region is also a hotspot for association with other 
cancers 27 with PVT1, CMYC and novel lncRNAs identified as candidate target genes. Five 
SNPs (rs10956390, rs10098831, rs6470578, rs6990534 and rs4410871) coincide with 11 or 
more biofeatures in normal ovarian and fallopian epithelial cells, and ovarian cancer cells.
Discussion
We have identified 12 novel loci associated with different histotypes of EOC at genome-
wide significance. Despite the use of a stringent significance threshold it is possible that 
some of these represent false positive associations. Wakefield has suggested the use of an 
approximate Bayes factor to calculate the Bayes false discovery probability (BFDP) 28. We 
have estimated the BFDP based on a plausible odds ratio of 1.2 and a prior probability of 
association of 0.0001. The BFDP was less than 10% for 11 of the 12 associations. We also 
calculated the BFDP for the 22 previously reported loci, of which 17 were <1%, 1 was >1% 
but less than 10% and 4 were greater than 10%. We did not calculate the BFDP for the 5 
pleiotropic loci reported by Kar et al, 2016 17. These five loci together with the 29 loci with 
BFDP<10% bring the total number of susceptibility loci for different histotypes of EOC to 
34 for women of European ancestry, of which 27 are associated with risk of invasive EOC at 
P<0.01. Assuming a polygenic variance of 1.45 29 the 27 loci account for approximately 
6.4% of the polygenic risk in the population. Incorporating common EOC susceptibility 
variants into risk assessment tools will improve risk prediction and may be particularly 
useful for refining risk estimates in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.
Some strata in the OCAC analyses pooled data from several studies from the same country. 
This might increase the potential for bias because of population stratification, but we expect 
any inflation due to population stratification to be effectively removed by adjusting for the 
principal components. In order to evaluate the possible magnitude of such a bias we 
compared the inflation of the median test statistic for the analysis of the OncoArray data 
stratified by study with an analysis in which all the cases and controls were combined into a 
single stratum. There was little difference (λ=1.054 v λ=1.078). As these inflation factors 
are not adjusted for sample size, some of the difference is due to the increase in effective 
sample size of the non-stratified analysis, suggesting that any bias do to pooling data from 
multiple studies will be minimal.
Consistent with previous studies in EOC and other cancer types, the vast majority of the 
risk-associated variants were located in non-protein coding regions of the genome 30 
suggesting these variants impact target gene expression by altering the activity of functional 
element(s) that regulate the expression of one or more susceptibility genes. Since non-
coding biofeatures, such as enhancers, show a high degree of tissue specificity, we 
intersected EOC risk SNPs with regions of active chromatin catalogued in cell lines

 representing the different EOC histotypes (HGSOC, ENOC, LGSOC and MOC) and in EOC 
precursor cells (OSEC/FTSEC for LGSOC/HGSOC, EEC for ENOC and colonic crypt for 
MOC). Enrichment analyses test for over-representation of cell-type specific biofeatures 
intersecting risk variants at confirmed risk loci, compared to a lack of enrichment in non-
disease associated tissues. A major strength of our approach was the ability to interrogate 
histotype-specific epigenomic profiles and so in addition to identifying the putative 
functional targets of risk SNPs, these analyses can also indicate whether some cell types are 
more likely to be relevant to disease pathogenesis compared to other cell types. For example 
we detected a significant enrichment of active chromatin marks coinciding with SNPs in 
fallopian tube epithelial cells at the 10q24.33 LGSOC/borderline serous locus, which could 
reflect recent pathological evidence that some of these tumors arise in the distal fallopian 
tube 31, as well as HGSOC 2. At the same locus, we also identified an enrichment for 
biofeatures in a primary MOC cell line, a cancer histotype that is often associated with 
deregulation of the MAPK pathway; which is also perturbed in LGSOC 32. Given the 
growing evidence that regulatory mechanisms are highly tissue specific, it is perhaps to be 
expected that we find such enrichments in cell types associated with EOC development. 
However, the lack of enrichment at MOC and ENOC risk loci may indicate that alternative 
precursor cell types give rise to these histotypes rather than the cell types evaluated in the 
current study.
Expression QTL analysis identified associations between the most statistically significant 
risk-associated SNPs at 10q24.33 and OBFC1, many of which also coincide with epigenetic 
biofeatures. OBFC1 is a subunit of an alpha accessory factor that stimulates the activity of 
DNA polymerase-alpha-primase, the enzyme that initiates DNA replication. OBFC1 also 
appears to function in a telomere-associated complex that binds telomeric single-stranded 
DNA in vitro and localizes at telomeres in vivo 33. Four SNPs in this region (rs2487999, 
rs4387287, rs9420907 and rs9419958) have previously been reported to be associated with 
telomere length (NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog 27, Supplementary table 14). The r2 between 
these and rs7902587 are between 0.52 and 0.93 (1000 Genomes European populations). 
However, the associations of all four with LGSOC and borderline serous EOC are attenuated 
when adjusted for rs7902587 suggesting a single association peak. The alleles associated 
with a decrease in leukocyte telomere length being associated with an increased risk of 
LGSOC and borderline serous EOC. These findings are consistent with the association 
between borderline EOC and rs7705526 at 5p15 (adjacent to the telomerase reverse 
transcriptase gene)13. Furthermore, the histotype specificity is consistent with the suggestion 
that telomere length differs between the different histotypes of EOC 34.
Candidate causal variants at three of the 12 novel loci are associated with multiple traits in 
the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog (P<5×10-8). These traits converge on pathways involved in 
inflammation and immunity, including monocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, 
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels, N-glycan levels, allergen sensitization, and multiple 
sclerosis (Supplementary table 14). For example, at the 12q24.31 HGSOC risk locus, the 
risk allele of four candidate causal SNPs (rs7979473, rs1183910, rs2393791, rs7310409) 
have previously been associated with raised CRP levels in blood plasma, a marker of 
inflammation. This is consistent with the established link between chronic inflammation and 
increased cancer risk. In addition SNPs within 500kb of the top SNP at 2q13, 8q24.21,

 10q24.33 and22q12.1 are associated with several different cancers although only one of 
these is a candidate causal EOC variant (rs2995264 at 10q24.33 associated with cutaneous 
malignant melanoma).
This study demonstrates the strength of large-scale collaborations in identifying common 
variant risk associations for complex traits such as EOC which is rare, has a high mortality 
rate, and exhibits heterogeneity by histotype. As the largest study to date with over 90,000 
EOC cases and controls including an additional ~25,000 previously unstudied participants, 
we identify several novel risk loci specific to the rarer EOC histotypes: ENOC, MOC, 
LGSOC and borderline EOC. The histotype-specific nature of these associations adds to the 
somatic, epidemiological and clinical data indicating that EOC histotypes can be thought of 
as distinct diseases. The lack of heterogeneity between studies of varying designs, carried 
out in different populations, and the high levels of statistical significance, with confirmation 
of known EOC susceptibility loci, provide evidence that these are robust associations. 
Molecular analyses of genes and the tissue specific regulatory architecture at these loci, 
which combined publicly available datasets with systematic, large-scale genome wide 
profiling experiments, point to a small number of non-coding biofeatures and target genes 
that may play a histotype-specific role in EOC initiation and development. Detailed 
functional studies will be required to define the underlying biology of SNP-regulatory 
interactions to identify the causal SNP(s) at each locus, and to confirm which candidate 
susceptibility genes represent the targets of these risk SNPs. Evolving technologies, in 
particular CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, now enable precision modification of risk SNPs to 
create isogenic models of different alleles 35, enabling the effects of each allele on disease 
pathogenesis to be studied, for example at 19p13 36, 8q24 14, 17q12 12 and 5p15 13. Finally, 
given that several previously identified EOC susceptibility alleles are associated with risk of 
other cancers 17, and that there are similarities in molecular phenotype and/or shared tissue 
of origin between endometrial cancer, endometriosis and ENOC and CCOC 37 as well as 
basal-like breast cancer 38, we anticipate that the loci reported here may be also associated 
with risk of other cancer-related traits.
METHODS
Study samples
Genotype data from six OCAC and two CIMBA genotyping projects were used for these 
analyses (Supplementary table 1). All participating studies were approved by the relevant 
research ethics committee and all participants provided written, informed consent.
OCAC—The OCAC OncoArray data comprised 63 genotyping project/case-controls sets 
(Supplementary table 1). Some studies (e.g. SEARCH) contributed samples to more than 
one genotyping project and some case-control sets are a combination of multiple individual 
studies. The following numbers are for the subjects of European ancestry that passed QC. 
The analyses included 66,450 samples from seven genotyping projects: 40,941 controls, 
22,406 invasive cases and 3,103 borderline cases. The number of cases by histotype were 
serous borderline (1,954), mucinous borderline (1,149), LGSOC (1,012), HGSOC (13,037), 
ENOC (2,810), CCOC (1,366) and other EOC (2,764).

 CIMBA—Eligibility in CIMBA is restricted to females aged 18 years or older with 
pathogenic variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The majority of the participants were sampled 
through cancer genetics clinics, including some related participants. Sixty-three studies 
contributed OncoArray and iCOGS genotype data on 31,448 mutation carriers. For the 
samples genotyped on OncoArray, after quality control (see below), data were available on 
15,694 BRCA1 mutation-carriers and 10,988 BRCA2 mutation carriers, of whom 2,372 and 
849, respectively, were affected with EOC (Supplementary table 2). We also obtained 
genotype data on 3,342 (561 affected) BRCA1 and 1,424 (105 affected) BRCA2 non-
overlapping samples genotyped using the iCOGS array 1,2.
Genotype data and Quality Control (QC)
Data from all the genotyping projects apart from the OCAC and CIMBA OncoArray 
projects have been published previously 1,3-6. Genotypes for OCAC samples were 
preferentially selected from the different projects in the following order: OncoArray, Mayo 
GWAS, COGS, and other GWAS.
Genotyping was performed at five centers: University of Cambridge, Center for Inherited 
Disease Research (CIDR), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Genome Quebec and Mayo 
Clinic. OncoArray sample QC was similar to that carried out for the other projects (as 
described 5). We excluded samples if they had a genotyping call rate < 95%, excessively low 
or high heterozygosity, if they were not female, or were duplicates (cryptic or intended). 
Duplicates and close relatives were identified using in-house software that calculates a 
concordance matrix for all individuals. Samples with concordance>0.86 were flagged as 
duplicates and samples with concordance between 0.74 and 0.86 were flagged as relatives. 
The comparison was performed among all the OncoArray samples, and all the previously 
genotyped samples. The concordance statistics were used to identify cryptic duplicates and 
expected duplicates whose genotypes did not match. We attempted to resolve these with the 
study investigators. If the discrepancy could not be resolved both samples were excluded. In 
OCAC, for confirmed cryptic duplicates and relatives, we retained one sample in the 
analysis. For case-control pairs we excluded the control, while for case-case and control-
control pairs we excluded the sample with the lower call rate. In CIMBA, relatives were 
included in the analysis and the association tests were adjusted accordingly. For confirmed 
duplicates, the sample with the higher call rate was retained.
SNP QC was carried out according to the OncoArray QC Guidelines. 7 Only those SNPs 
that passed QC for all consortia were used for imputation. We excluded SNPs with a call 
rate <95%, SNPs deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<10-7 in controls or 
unrelated samples in CIMBA and P <10-12 in cases) and SNPs with concordance<98% 
among 5,280 duplicate pairs. For the imputation, we additionally excluded SNPs with a 
MAF<1% and a call rate <98% and SNPs that could not be linked to the 1000 genomes 
reference or differed significantly in frequency from the 1000 genomes (European 
frequency) and a further 1,128 SNPs where the cluster plot was judged to be inadequate. Of 
the 533,631 SNPs which were manufactured on the array, 494,813 SNPs passed the initial 
QC and 470,825 SNPs were used for imputation. Samples with overall heterozygosity <5% 
or > 40% were excluded.

 Ancestry analysis
Intercontinental ancestry was calculated for the OCAC samples using the software package 
FastPop (http://sourceforge.net/projects/fastpop/) 8 developed specifically for the 
OncoArray. Only the samples with >80% European ancestry were used for these analyses. 
For the CIMBA samples 33,661 weakly correlated autosomal SNPs (pair-wise r2 less than 
0.1) were used to compute the genomic kinship between all pairs of individuals, along with 
267 HapMap samples (CHB, JPT, YRI and CEU). These were converted to distances and 
subjected to multidimensional scaling. Using the first two components, we calculated the 
proportion of European ancestry for each individual and excluded samples with >27% non-
European ancestry to ensure that samples of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry were included in the 
final sample. Analysis using FastPop provided virtually identical results.
Principal components analysis
Principal component analysis for the OncoArray data was carried out using data from 
33,661 uncorrelated SNPs (pair-wise r2 less than 0.1) with minor allele frequency greater 
than 0.05 using an in house program (available at http://ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/software/
pccalc/). Principal components analysis for the other genotype data sets was carried out as 
previously described. 1,5
Imputation
We performed imputation separately for each genotyping project data set. We imputed 
genotypes into the reference panel from the 1000 Genomes Project (v3 October 2014). 9 We 
initially used an effcient two-step procedure, which involved pre-phasing using SHAPEIT 10 
followed by imputation of the phased data using IMPUTE2 11. We then performed more 
accurate imputation for any region with a SNP with P<10 6 in the OCAC analyses or the 
OCAC/CIMBA meta-analysis. The boundaries were set +/−500kb from the most significant 
SNP in each region. The single-step imputation used IMPUTE2 without pre-phasing with 
some of the default parameters modified. These included an increase of the MCMC 
iterations to 90 (out of which the first 15 were used as burn-in), an increase of the buffer 
region to 500kb and increasing to 100 the number of haplotypes used as templates when 
phasing observed genotypes.
After imputation, 85 per cent of common variants including both single nucleotide variants 
and small indels (MAF>0.05) have an imputation r2 imputation accuracy > 0.9 with 97 
percent having imputation r2 > 0.7. Of the rare variants (0.001 < MAF < 0.05), 28 per cent 
have an imputation r2> 0.9 and 58 per cent have an imputation r2> 0.7.
Association analyses in the unselected ovarian cancer cases and controls from OCAC and 
CIMBA
We excluded SNPs from the association analysis if their imputation accuracy was r2<0.3 or 
their minor allele frequency (MAF) was <0.01. In total, genotypes for 11,595,112 million 
variants were available for analysis.

 Association analyses OCAC
We evaluated the association between genotype and disease using the imputed genotype 
dosage in a logistic regression model. We carried out initial, genome-wide analyses 
separately for OncoArray, COGS and the five GWAS datasets and pooled the results using a 
fixed effects meta-analysis. The analyses were adjusted for study and for population 
substructure by including the eigenvectors of project-specific principal components as 
covariates in the model (nine for OncoArray, five for COGS, two for UK GWAS, and two 
for the US, BWH and POL GWAS, and a single PC for the MAY GWAS). The number of 
eigenvectors chosen was based on the inflection point of a scree plot. After one-step 
imputation of the genotypes in the regions of interest we used genotype dosages in a single 
logistic regression model with adjustment for each genotyping project/study combination 
and nineteen principal components. Principal components were set to zero for samples not 
included in a given project. We used custom written software for the analysis.
EOC is a heterogeneous phenotype with five major histotypes for invasive disease – 
HGSOC, LGSOC, MOC, ENOC and CCOC – and two histotypes of borderline disease – 
serous and mucinous. The pattern of association across the different histotypes varies for the 
known EOC risk loci. We therefore carried out the association analysis on the following nine 
histotypes: all invasive disease; HGSOC; LGSOC; all invasive serous; serous borderline; 
LGSOC and borderline serous combined; ENOC; CCOC; and mucinous invasive/mucinous 
borderline combined.
Association analyses CIMBA
We carried out the ovarian cancer association analyses separately for BRCA1 and BRCA2 
carriers and for OncoArray and COGS samples. The results were pooled using fixed effects 
meta-analysis. The primary analysis was carried out within a survival analysis framework 
with time to ovarian cancer diagnosis as the endpoint. Mutation carriers were followed until 
the age of ovarian cancer diagnosis, or risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) or age 
at study recruitment.
Breast cancer diagnosis was not considered as a censoring event. In order to account for the 
non-random sampling of BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers with respect to disease status we 
conducted the analyses by modelling the retrospective likelihood of the observed genotypes 
conditional on the disease phenotype. We assessed the associations between genotype and 
risk of ovarian cancer using a score test statistic based on the retrospective likelihood. 12 To 
account for the non-independence among related individuals in the sample, we used an 
adjusted version of the score test statistic, which uses a kinship-adjusted variance of the 
score. 13 We evaluated associations between imputed genotypes and ovarian cancer risk 
using a version of the score test as described above but with the posterior genotype 
probabilities replacing the genotypes. All analyses were stratified by the country of origin of 
the samples and for Ashkenazi Jewish origin.
We carried out the analyses using custom written functions in Fortran and Python. The score 
test statistic was implemented in R version 3.0.1.

 OCAC/CIMBA meta-analysis
We conducted a meta-analysis of the EOC associations in BRCA1, BRCA2 carriers and 
OCAC samples using an inverse variance approach assuming fixed effects. We combined the 
logarithm of the per-allele hazard ratio estimate for the association with EOC risk in BRCA1 
and BRCA2 mutation carriers and the logarithm of the per-allele odds ratio estimate for the 
association with EOC (any-subtype) and serous EOC in OCAC. The number of BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 samples with tumor histology information was too small to allow for subgroup 
analyses. However, previous studies have demonstrated that the vast majority of EOCs in 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers are HGSOC. Meta-analyses were carried out using 
the software “metal”, 2011-03-25 release 14.
We evaluated whether there is evidence for multiple independent association signals in the 
region around each newly identified locus by evaluating the associations of genetic variants 
in the region while adjusting for the SNP with the smallest meta-analysis p-value in the 
respective region. This was done separately for BRCA1 carriers, BRCA2 carriers and 
OCAC.
Candidate causal SNPs in each susceptibility region
In order to identify a set of variants most likely to mediate the observed association – the 
credible causal variants - we excluded SNPs with causality odds of less than 1:100 by 
comparing the likelihood of each SNP from the association analysis with the likelihood of 
the most strongly associated SNP.
Functional annotation of risk associated variants
Expression and methylation quantitative trait loci analyses—A TCGA data set15 
was available for 326 HGSOC tumors in women of European ancestry. Ancestry was 
estimated using the Local Ancestry in adMixed Populations (LAMP, 16) software package 
and individuals with > 95% European descent were retained for further analyses. Matched 
gene expression (measured on the Agilent 1M microarray), CpG methylation (measured on 
the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip), copy number alteration (called 
using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0), and germline genotype (called using the Affymetrix SNP 
6.0) were also available. A Mayo Clinic data set was available for 209 serous EOC tumors 
and 32 ENOC tumors in women of European ancestry. Matched gene expression (measured 
on the Agilent whole human genome 4x44K expression microarray), CpG methylation 
(measured on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450), copy number alteration (called 
using the OncoArray), and germline genotype (called using the OncoArray) were available 
for all of these samples. Genotypes were imputed into the 1000 Genomes October 2014 
(Phase 3, version 5) 9 European reference panel for both data sets. Expression QTL analyses 
were performed using linear regression as implemented in the R package Matrix eQTL 17. 
Only variants with imputation accuracy R2 > 0.3 were analyzed. Prior to eQTL analyses the 
effects of tumor copy number and methylation on gene expression were regressed out as 
previously described18. For the Mayo data set, we performed separate analyses on the 
HGSOC and ENOC samples. Results for the two HGSOC data sets were combined in a 
random effects meta-analysis. We focused on local or cis-acting eQTLs between SNPs in the

 1:100 list of potentially causal variants and all genes up to 1 Mb on either side of these 
SNPs.
mQTL analyses for the 1:100 potentially causal SNPs in regions of interest (1 MB on either 
side of the index SNP) were conducted using the Mayo dataset only, because methylation 
was assayed with the much denser 450K array and the Mayo sample included histologies 
other than HGSOC. Within each region, CpG probes were filtered based on their association 
with gene expression. For each expression probe within the region, a linear model was fit by 
CpG probe adjusted for age and CNV overlapping the expression probes. The CpG with the 
strongest negative test statistic for each gene (across multiple expression probes per gene) 
was retained for mQTL analysis in order to reduce the total number of tests. We performed 
VanderWaerden rank transformations of the beta values to account for skewed distributions 
in the beta-values, and conducted linear regression of the SNP genotypes on the transformed 
beta values, adjusted for age and CNV overlapping the CpG probe; missing CNV values 
were imputed using the median for the non-missing samples within each region. As a 
sensitivity analysis, we also performed analyses adjusted only for age. Analyses were 
conducted for all histologies, as well as for the serous, HGSOC, and ENOC subsets. Raw. 
Loci were eliminated from analyses where there were either no Agilent probes for the region 
on the array (9q31.1) or there were no negatively associated CpGs on the 450k array 
(8q21.11).
For eQTL and mQTL analyses two-sided p-values are reported.
Mapping risk SNPs to biofeatures
Cell culture—Cell lines were cultured in their respective media as follows: GTFR230, 
NOSE-CM (1:1 Medium 199: MCDB105 (both Sigma Aldrich), 15% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS, Hyclone), 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin (both Sigma Aldrich) 10 ng/ml 
epidermal growth factor and 34 μg protein/ml bovine pituitary extract (both Life 
Technologies); MCAS, EMEM supplemented with 15% FBS (Seradigm); RMG-II and 
JHOC5, RPMI plus 10% FBS and OAW42, DMEM containing 10% FBS, 20 μg/ml insulin 
and sodium pyruvate (Lonza). Cell lines were authenticated by profiling short tandem 
repeats using the Promega Powerplex 16HS Assay (performed at the University of Arizona 
Genetics Core facility) and all cultures tested negative for contaminating Mycoplasma 
infections using a Mycoplasma specific PCR.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Our ChIP protocol was based on the 
methods of Schmidt et al. 19 Four 15cm dishes of cells were fixed in formaldehyde for 10 
minutes, before quenching the fixation with glycine. Cells were harvested, lysed in a 
sarkosyl-containing lysis buffer, and sonicated using the Covaris E220 evolution Focused-
Ultrasonicator to yield 100-300bp genomic DNA fragments. 5 μg of an antibody raised 
against H3K27ac (Diagenode) was incubated with blocked magnetic Dynabeads (Life 
Technologies) at 4°C for 4 hours. Antibody-bead conjugates were incubated with 100 μg 
chromatin at 4°C overnight, with constant agitation. Beads were washed extensively with 
RIPA buffer and then RNase and proteinase K (both Qiagen) treated. DNA was then eluted 
from the beads in TE buffer and cleaned up using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit

each cell line and each sample was quality checked by site-specific qPCR prior to next 
generation sequencing (NGS).
Next generation sequencing—ChIP libraries were constructed using the Kapa Hyper 
Library Preparation kit, according to manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 2/3 of the 
immunoprecipitated (IP) material was used as the starting amount. For undiluted input 
samples, 100-300 ng of starting material was used. Construction was carried out according 
to manufacturer’s instructions using Bio NextFLex adapters diluted 1:50. Final PCR on a 
portion of the adapter ligation was performed for 12 cycles. Products were evaluated by the 
Agilent Bioanalyzer, using high sensitivity DNA chips. ChIP libraries were quantified using 
Kapa Biosystems Illumina library quantification kit, then 12 pooled for sequencing, which 
was carried out using single end reads with 75 cycles on a NextSeq 500 (with version 2 
chemistry).
Analysis of ChIP-seq data—ChIP-seq data were processed using MACS2 with p value 
cutoff of 0.001. The smaller of input or signal was linearly scaled to the same depth as the 
larger dataset. In order to control the irreproducible discovery rate in ChIPseq analysis, we 
used IDR version 2.0 pipeline. 20 A standard IDR threshold p< 0.05 was applied.
Functional annotation of variants—We used shell scripts with bedtools (http://
bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to generate overlap data between all variants in each 
associated region including likely causal SNPs and bed file versions of all the data 
represented in Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 6. In addition we included 3’UTRs, 
5’UTRs, miRcode high confidence conserved microRNA target sites, high confidence 
microRNA target sites from microRNA.org, and all coding exons. The overlap data thus 
obtained were converted to matrix form by means of python scripts. MicroRNA target sites 
were only considered that overlapped untranslated (UTR) gene regions. Exonic variants 
were further assessed for missense or nonsense mutations by Mutect software 21. The 
NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog was used to identify SNPs among the potentially causal set with 
other genome-wide signification associations (Supplementary table 14).
Locus-specific tissue enrichment of variants—H3K27 acetylation peaks were 
collated from public sources (for HeLa-S3, HCT116, UCSD Ovary, UCSD Sigmoid Colon, 
Colon Crypt) or from in-house data (IOSE4, IOSE11, FT33, FT246, EEC16, CaOV3, 
UWB1.289, OAW42, GFTR230, MCAS) (Supplementary table 5 and Supplementary table 
16). Overlaps were counted for the all SNPs against which genotypes were imputed in 1000 
genomes for each H3K27Ac dataset. The fraction of causal SNPs with overlaps was then 
tested for significance against this background for each cell type in the H3K27ac datasets 
using the hypergeometric distribution. Finally, p values were adjusted for multiple 
comparisons using Bonferroni’s method.

Height of each bar in the histogram represents the number of candidate causal SNPs at each 
locus overlapping H3K27ac marks in a particular cell line. Loci are grouped according to 
their association with different histotypes of ovarian cancer. The number of causal SNPs at 
100:1 odds relative to the top regional SNP is indicated by the red circles (scale below, 
right). In the key cell lines are grouped according to their likely relevance to the different 
histotypes. Abbreviations: mucinous ovarian cancer (MOC), low grade serous ovarian cancer
