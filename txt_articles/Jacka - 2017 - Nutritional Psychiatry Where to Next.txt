The nascent field of ‘Nutritional Psychiatry’ offers much promise for addressing the large disease burden associ-
ated with mental disorders. A consistent evidence base from the observational literature confirms that the quality
of individuals' diets is related to their risk for common mental disorders, such as depression. This is the case
across countries and age groups. Moreover, new intervention studies implementing dietary changes suggest
promise for the prevention and treatment of depression. Concurrently, data point to the utility of selected
nutraceuticals as adjunctive treatments for mental disorders and as monotherapies for conditions such as
ADHD. Finally, new studies focused on understanding the biological pathways that mediate the observed rela-
tionships between diet, nutrition and mental health are pointing to the immune system, oxidative biology,
brain plasticity and the microbiome-gut-brain axis as key targets for nutritional interventions. On the other
hand, the field is currently limited by a lack of data and methodological issues such as heterogeneity, residual
confounding, measurement error, and challenges in measuring and ensuring dietary adherence in intervention
studies. Key challenges for the field are to now: replicate, refine and scale up promising clinical and population
level dietary strategies; identify a clear set of biological pathways and targets that mediate the identified associ-
ations; conduct scientifically rigorous nutraceutical and ‘psychobiotic’ interventions that also examine predictors
of treatment response; conduct observational and experimental studies in psychosis focused on dietary and re-
lated risk factors and treatments; and continue to advocate for policy change to improve the food environment at
the population level.

 supplementation in mood disorders during previous decades (e.g. Su et
al., 2003; Stoll et al., 1999; Taylor et al., 2004), as well as a number of ob-
servational studies focusing on the intake of single nutrients or foods
(e.g. Morris et al., 2003; Hibbeln, 1998), the first studies to examine
and establish a link between overall diet quality and the common men-
tal disorders, depression and anxiety, were not published until the last
decade (Jacka et al., 2010a; Akbaraly et al., 2009; Sanchez Villegas et
al., 2009). Given that nutritional research has, justifiably, moved away
from a focus on single foods or nutrients, cognisant of the fact that
humans do not consume these in isolation (Hu, 2002) and that what
we eat in excess is as important as what we do not eat enough of,
these initial studies were influential and prompted a wider and more
nuanced interest in this topic. We coined the term ‘Nutritional Psychia-
try’ in order to promote a new field of research focused on developing a
comprehensive, cohesive and scientifically rigorous evidence base to
support a shift in thinking around the role of diet and nutrition in men-
tal health (Sarris et al., 2015a,b). This narrative review and commentary
provides an update on the field as it stands to date. It incorporates a dis-
cussion of the methodological issues and challenges, and identifies and
discusses significant gaps in the literature with a view to informing the
developing research agenda.
2. Observational Data in Humans
Since the initial studies the field has grown rapidly, with published
observational studies originating in many different countries. In 2013–
14, the evidence base was advanced enough for systematic reviews,
and there were several published examining the evidence for a relation-
ship between measures of diet quality and mental disorders, particular-
ly depression. Two of these incorporated a meta-analysis. In one of these
studies, 20 observational studies out of a possible 45 were considered
methodologically rigorous to be included in the systematic review (Lai
et al., 2013). Of these, 13 studies (four cohort and nine cross-sectional)
had dietary exposures of sufficient similarity to be included in a meta-
analysis. The results suggested that higher intakes of a ‘healthy’ diet
(i.e. fruit, vegetables, fish, and whole grains) were associated with a re-
duced likelihood of depression (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.92). There was
little evidence of publication bias. The trend for an association between
consuming a ‘western’ (unhealthy) dietary pattern and depression (OR:
1.17; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.41) was not statistically significant in the meta-
analysis, likely due to insufficient power as a result of the small number
of included studies (Lai et al., 2013). The second meta-analysis, which
included eight cohort studies and one case-control study, identified a
dose-response association between high adherence (pooled effect esti-
mate = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.54–0.86) and moderate adherence (pooled effect
estimate 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62–0.95) to a Mediterranean diet and the risk
for depression (Psaltopoulou et al., 2013). In common with the Lai et
al. study (Lai et al., 2013), the study failed to find evidence of publication
bias.
Concordant with these meta-analyses arising from adult data, there
are now many cross-sectional and prospective observational studies
reporting inverse associations between adherence to healthy dietary
patterns and reduced risk for or likelihood of mental health distur-
bances in children and adolescents, while unhealthy dietary habits are
positively associated with mental health problems. These relationships
are, also in common with the adult data, usually observed to be inde-
pendent of other key health behaviours, including physical activity
and smoking, but are also independent of key environmental factors
such as socioeconomic circumstances, family conflict, poor family func-
tioning and social support, and adolescent dieting behaviours (Jacka et
al., 2011, 2010b, 2013a). They are even documented in very young chil-
dren, suggesting important opportunities for preventive interventions
focused on prenatal and early life nutritional exposures (Jacka et al.,
2013b; Pina-Camacho et al., 2015). A systematic review in 2014 con-
firmed an association between higher unhealthy diets and poor mental
health in children and adolescents (O'Neil et al., 2014a), although this
review now requires updating.
The findings of the studies included in these systematic reviews and
meta-analyses are notable for their consistency across countries, cul-
tures and age groups. At their core, the many and varied versions of a
‘healthy’ diet comprise higher intakes of nutrient-dense plant based
foods and quality sources of protein. Thus, healthy diets in Spain,
Norway, Japan, Australia, China, the UK, and the many other countries
from which the published data are derived, are unified in being charac-
terized by these dietary components, despite differing on culturally spe-
cific foods. On the other hand, ‘western’ diets are more homogeneous in
their composition due to their common source (i.e. industry). What is
also notable is that the relationship between both healthy and un-
healthy diets and mental health are consistently independent of each
other, indicating that each (i.e. low intakes of healthy, nutrient and
fibre-dense foods and higher intakes of processed, sugary and fat-
laden foods) are associated with poor mental health via potentially dif-
ferent, although overlapping, pathways. Finally, the extant evidence
largely supports a causal relationship between diet quality and depres-
sion on the basis of the Bradford Hill criteria: that of consistency, with
concordant findings and effect sizes across cultures, genders and age
groups, with multiple methods used to assess diet quality and mental
health; biological gradient; temporality; biological plausibility; and co-
herence of the findings with what we already know about the impact
of habitual diet on noncommunicable disorders (Jacka et al., 2012a).
However, while many results from more recent population-based
studies support the systematic reviews, there are negative findings. In
particular, one prospective study from the very large Nurses Health
Study failed to find strong evidence for the hypothesized relationship
between diet quality and depression in women after adjustments
(Chocano-Bedoya et al., 2013). Moreover, while a large repeated
cross-sectional study (n = 296,121) reported consistent inverse rela-
tionships between fruit and vegetable intake and major depressive dis-
order (McMartin et al., 2013), a more recent longitudinal study in the
same population, utilizing data from more than eight thousands
Canadians, found that the inverse relationship between fruit and vege-
table intake and depression observed in univariate analyses was atten-
uated by the addition of other measures of health behaviours to the
model (Kingsbury et al., 2015). Another large Australian cohort study
also reported that the weak relationships arising from univariate analy-
ses were attenuated by adjustment for other health behaviours or by
measures of socioeconomic position in younger and middle-aged
groups. However, associations between dietary patterns and depression
over time remained significant in the older cohort (Jacka et al., 2014a).
On the other hand, when the dietary data from the Nurses Health
Study were re-analysed according to the ‘inflammatory potential’ of
the diet, by use of a Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), the DII did predict
depression over twelve years of follow up (Lucas et al., 2013). These
studies point to the need to identify and address critical methodological
issues, including those relating to the measurement and quantification
of diet, and issues relating to the shared variance between lifestyle fac-
tors, such as diet, smoking and exercise.
3. Methodological Issues
Methods for accurately measuring people's dietary intakes remain
problematic. Extensive research in nutritional epidemiology points to
high levels of measurement error with the use of the various methods
for capturing dietary intakes (e.g. Freedman et al., 2014). Given that
there is also error associated with the measurement of mental health,
the relationships between diet and health outcomes may be obscured
and attenuated by measurement error. However, an equally important
issue relates to the methods chosen to examine associations between
‘diet quality’ and health outcomes. In many studies, diet quality is mea-
sured using a priori dietary quality indexes derived from recommended
dietary guidelines, or by other composite measures of dietary intake.
25
F.N. Jacka / EBioMedicine 17 (2017) 24–29
 These include indices such as the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), various in-
dices based on national dietary guidelines, or numerous measures of
Mediterranean Diet. Diet quality is also assessed by the use of dietary
pattern analysis, which is a post priori method affording the determina-
tion of habitual dietary patterns in the data at hand. Such studies com-
monly identify two main dietary patterns that reflect healthy dietary
habits (often named ‘prudent’ or ‘wholesome’) and unhealthy dietary
patterns (‘western’). There is evidence that (e.g. Jacka et al., 2010a)
the use of dietary pattern analysis, using factor analytical approaches,
yields better results as these derived their patterns from the data and
sample at hand, rather than from imposing an a priori diet quality
score on dietary information derived from a particular population. As
an exemplar, imposing a Mediterranean-style dietary index is likely
problematic in non-Mediterranean cultures. However, newer methods,
such as the use of a DII (Lucas et al., 2013; O'Neil et al., 2015), are less
influenced by cultural contexts and are starting to be more widely
applied.
Another methodological issue that can obscure and complicate the
assessment of the diet-mental health relationship relates to the covari-
ance between health behaviours such as diet, physical activity and
smoking. As these health behaviours are all associated with depression
in a bidirectional manner, as well as being correlated with each other,
teasing apart the relative contribution of each to the variance in depres-
sion and understanding how each interacts with each other can compli-
cate the interpretation of the results of observational studies. As such,
caution should be employed in such interpretation. Similarly, while sen-
sitivity analyses and study design attempt to assess reverse causality
(e.g. Jacka et al., 2015a) and residual and unmeasured confounding by
other important factors, such as socioeconomic position (Jacka et al.,
2014a), the limitations of observational study designs must always be
recognised. Less commonly-utilized statistical approaches to data anal-
ysis, such as structural equation modeling, may help to mitigate some of
the most pernicious issues relating to residual confounding in observa-
tional studies (Westfall and Yarkoni, 2016). Animal experiments also
offer an important contribution to our understanding, as they allow
for manipulation of diet in a controlled way; however, animal and
human biology and nutritional needs differ substantially and the limita-
tions here are also clear.
Finally, intervention studies using randomised controlled trial de-
signs are considered the gold standard in determining causality, but
these are fraught when it comes to diet. Ensuring and accurately mea-
suring dietary adherence is far more challenging in nutrition than in al-
most any other field of research. Moreover, such studies – by their
nature – preclude the possibility of double-blinding, predisposing to is-
sues such as expectation bias and a failure of allocation concealment.
However, some studies are beginning to yield important and valuable
insights into causality, prevention and treatment and these are now
considered.
4. Intervention Data in Humans
The European PREDIMED study (Estruch et al., 2013) represents the
largest dietary intervention attempted to date. In this study, older adults
with elevated risk factors for cardiac events were randomised to one of
three dietary conditions: one of two forms of a Mediterranean diet or a
‘low fat’ control condition, based on American Heart Association dietary
guidelines. Participants received individualised and group support for
dietary change and adherence, as well as being provided with some rel-
evant foods. The primary outcome of PREDIMED was cardiovascular
events and the study was successful in showing that a Mediterranean
diet could protect against such outcomes (Estruch et al., 2013). Howev-
er, although not statistically powered to assess de novo depression as an
outcome, post hoc analyses of the self-reported depression data from
PREDIMED suggested a non-significant trend towards the prevention
of depression by the Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts
(OR = 0.78 (0.55–1.10)), and this was statistically significant in those
with type 2 diabetes, who comprised approximately half the study sam-
ple (OR = 0.59 (0.36–0.98)) (Sanchez-Villegas et al., 2013). In another
randomised prevention trial, dietary coaching used as a control condi-
tion was unexpectedly equivalent to problem-solving therapy in both
preventing clinical depression (Stahl et al., 2014) and improving
health-related quality of life (Jimenez et al., 2015) in disadvantaged
older Americans.
While these preliminary findings suggest that dietary interventions
or improvement may be useful for preventing depression, up until re-
cently there were no rigorous intervention studies explicitly designed
to take a dietary approach to treatment in populations with existing
mental disorders (Opie et al., 2015a). We have now just published the
first study to do so and the results are noteworthy. In the SMILES
study (O'Neil et al., 2013; Jacka et al., 2017) we aimed to investigate
the efficacy of an adjunctive dietary improvement program for the
treatment of major depressive episodes using a 12-week, parallel
group, single blind randomised controlled trial design. The intervention
comprised the ‘ModiMedDiet’, which is rich in vegetables, fruit and
whole grains, with an emphasis on increased consumption of oily fish,
extra virgin olive oil, legumes and raw unsalted nuts. However, in con-
trast to traditional Mediterranean diets, it advocates for moderate con-
sumption of red meat (Jacka et al., 2012b) and dairy. Participants,
most of whom were already receiving psychotropic medications and/
or psychotherapy, received seven individual dietary coaching sessions
of approximately 60 min each, delivered by an accredited dietitian,
and
the
control
group
received
manualised
social
support
(‘Befriending’) to the same schedule and intensity. The results were no-
table, with the intervention group demonstrating significantly greater
improvement between baseline and 12 weeks than the control group
with a very large effect size (Cohen's d −1.16: 95% CI: −1.73, −0.59)
and a number needed to treat (NNT) of 4.1 (Jacka et al., 2017). Second-
ary outcomes were also concordant with the primary outcome measure
and all effects were independent of any changes in BMI, self-efficacy,
smoking rates and/or physical activity. Finally, dietary adherence corre-
lated strongly with improvements in mood. These results provide the
first RCT evidence for dietary improvement as a treatment strategy for
treating major depressive episodes, as well as providing intervention
evidence supporting causality. Importantly, the study also tells us that
working with patients with mental illness to help them to achieve die-
tary improvements is feasible, despite the fatigue and reduced motiva-
tion often associated with depression. On the other hand, the
relatively small sample size and the inability to blind participants to
group allocation are clear limitations to this study, which now requires
replication using larger study samples.
5. Diet or Supplements?
Supplements in nutrition interventions have often been used to
avoid the difficulties of addressing dietary intakes; however, it needs
to be stressed that diet and nutritional supplements are not equivalent
(Lichtenstein and Russell, 2005) and data supporting the utility of
such supplementation in mental illness are somewhat limited and
equivocal to date. The exception to this is omega-3 fatty acid supple-
ments, which have a more extensive evidence base, particularly for
the use of supplements containing a higher proportion of EPA compared
to DHA (Sublette et al., 2011) and as an adjunctive treatment for mood
disorders including bipolar depression (Sarris et al., 2012).
Sarris et al. reviewed the literature on nutritional supplements for
major depressive disorder and found little support for these as mono-
therapies, but concluded that there was evidence for the utility of folic
acid, S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe), omega-3 fatty acids, and L-trypto-
phan as adjunctive therapies (Sarris et al., 2009). A more recent system-
atic review and meta-analysis of nutraceuticals as adjunctive therapies
for depression confirmed the efficacy of SAMe, omega 3, methylfolate
and Vitamin D, but provided only limited support for zinc, folic acid, vi-
tamin C, and tryptophan (Sarris et al., 2016). Almeida et al. also
26
F. N. Jacka / EBioMedicine 17 (2017) 24–29
 conducted a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the litera-
ture on the short and long term impact of Vitamin B12 and folate as a
treatment for depression (Almeida et al., 2015). They concluded that
the evidence did not support these B-group vitamins as a short-term
treatment, but that they might offer some preventive potential over
the longer term. Other nutraceuticals with methods of action focused
on addressing the pathophysiological aberrations that characterise
many psychiatric disorders, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, re-
duced neurogenesis, and mitochondrial dysfunction, have shown con-
siderable promise. For example, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) – a
bioavailable amino acid that upregulates glutathione and modulates
glutamatergic, neurotropic, and inflammatory pathways – has shown
preliminary efficacy as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia and bi-
polar depression (Berk et al., 2008a,b), but not in major depressive dis-
order (Berk et al., 2014).
Finally, some in the field have argued that the use of single nutrient
supplements is flawed as a strategy, given that nutrients are not ever
consumed singly in the diet and that humans have evolved to require
a broad range of nutrients. In their recent systematic review, which in-
cluded open label trials and case studies in addition to randomised pla-
cebo-controlled trials, Rucklidge and Kaplan (2013) noted the lack of
trials of combined multivitamin-mineral formulations in populations
with clinical depressive, anxiety or psychotic disorders. However, two
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of such formula-
tions in adult ADHD (Rucklidge et al., 2014) and for antisocial behaviour
in young adult prisoners (Gesch et al., 2002) offer support for such an
approach to treatment. Certainly, an assumption that greater efficacy
might be attainable using simultaneous and synergistic combinations
of nutraceuticals has merit, and a trial of a multi-component nutrient
formula, in combination with NAC, for the treatment of bipolar depres-
sion is currently underway (Dean et al., 2015). More research in this
field is warranted and this is discussed further below.
6. Where to Now?
The field of Nutritional Psychiatry is only just starting to generate
data of the quality and consistency required to change public health rec-
ommendations and clinical practice. However, we have recently argued
for such changes on the basis of the precautionary principle and the im-
perative to find new ways to address the very high burden of illness as-
sociated with mental disorders, and the fact that these are shared risk
factors across the suite of non-communicable disorders with which
mental disorders are so commonly comorbid (Dash et al., 2016). Such
recommendations, including dietary recommendations (Opie et al.,
2015b), are also cognizant of the substantial burden of disease associat-
ed with the profound and detrimental changes to food systems globally
(G. B. D. Risk Factors Collaborators et al., 2015) and the urgent need for
governments to address food policy to support better population health
(Jacka et al., 2014b).
While we wait for such changes, there is much to be done to advance
this nascent field. Firstly, there is a clear need to now refine, replicate
and scale-up dietary interventions aimed at both preventing and
treating common mental disorders (Sanchez-Villegas et al., 2013;
O'Neil et al., 2013). The use of technology and the internet is one feasible
way in which scaling up could be achieved. Given that emerging evi-
dence suggests highly individualized responses to food intake, further
research should utilise new sources of data and statistical methodolo-
gies for developing predictive algorithms and individualized dietary
recommendations (Zeevi et al., 2015). Moreover, given the role of pre-
natal and early life nutrition in influencing physical and mental health
outcomes in children, public health strategies for improving nutrition
during pregnancy should also be developed, implemented and evaluat-
ed (O'Neil et al., 2014b; Jacka and Berk, 2014).
Another key imperative is to home in on the biological pathways
that mediate the diet-mental health link. Previous discussions have cen-
tered on inflammatory (Berk et al., 2013) and oxidative stress (Moylan
et al., 2014) pathways, as well as brain plasticity (Jacka et al., 2015b) and
the new evidence regarding intestinal permeability (Maes et al., 2012)
and the gut microbiota (Dash et al., 2015; Sandhu et al., 2017). In partic-
ular, the gut-brain axis is an increasing focus of attention, given the re-
cent understanding regarding the importance of the gut microbiota in
influencing brain and behaviour (Cryan and Dinan, 2012) and the rec-
ognition that diet is a key modulator of gut microbiota and gut health.
Indeed, recent animal work suggests that more than half of the variance
in gut microbiota can be accounted for by dietary changes (Zhang et al.,
2010), while both short and long term diets have a profound influence
on the microbial profiles of humans (Wu et al., 2011). The consumption
of complex carbohydrates, plant-based foods/fruits and vegetables (Wu
et al., 2011; Albenberg and Wu, 2014) positively influence microbial
composition, synthesis of anti-inflammatory metabolites, and host
health, while high fat diets (HFD) in animals appear to trigger microbial
dysbiosis, intestinal permeability (‘leaky gut’) and inflammation (Kim et
al., 2012), with behavioural disruptions that are independent of obesity
(Bruce-Keller et al., 2015). Emerging evidence, although preliminary
(Allen et al., 2016; Tillisch et al., 2013; Akkasheh et al., 2016), also sup-
ports the investigation of probiotics – termed ‘psychobiotics’ (Dinan et
al., 2013) – as psychotropic medications, while fermented foods (Kim
et al., 2016) may also be a useful dietary strategy for mental and brain
health. Equally important to consider is the emerging evidence regard-
ing the noxious impact of components of ‘junk’ and processed foods, in-
cluding dietary emulsifiers (Chassaing et al., 2015), artificial sweeteners
(Suez et al., 2014) and high-fat, refined-sugar diets (e.g. Molteni et al.,
2002; Morrison et al., 2010; Zainuddin and Thuret, 2012) on gut and
brain health.
However, key issues relate to the lack of clarity regarding the poten-
tial differential impact of differing dietary fats, such as saturated vs
mono vs polyunsaturated fats, as well as carbohydrate intake, on gut
health, immune, metabolic and behavioural outcomes, and whether
the results of HFD and similar experimental paradigms in animal studies
are relevant to humans. These issues are currently subject to intense in-
vestigation due to their likely relevance to public health and clinical ap-
proaches. Moreover, relationships between diet and bacteria are likely
dependent on individual factors, and which dietary patterns and com-
ponents promote particular microbial populations is not well under-
stood. More human data are urgently needed to understand the
complex ways in which dietary intakes influence gut microbiota com-
position and activity, and to explicate the relationships between gut mi-
crobiota and health and a range of environmental exposures, health
behaviours, medical conditions, blood biomarkers and mental health.
Another imperative is to move beyond a focus on common mental
disorders to investigate diet, as well as diet-related factors including
food allergy and gut health, as modifiable risk factors in the serious
spectrum of mental illnesses. For example, there are tantalising data
from animal models pointing to the potential for the ketogenic diet in
animal models of psychosis (Kraeuter et al., 2015) and this could be
evaluated as a possible intervention in humans. Similarly, gastrointesti-
nal barrier dysfunction, food sensitivities, inflammation, and the meta-
bolic syndrome are commonly seen in schizophrenia and this
warrants research investigating the possible role of such factors in the
genesis and progression of psychotic illnesses, and the potential of die-
tary interventions addressing immune dysfunction, food sensitivities
and gut health in those with psychosis. There are data to suggest that
targeting inflammation using nutraceutical approaches can prevent
emerging psychotic illnesses (Amminger et al., 2010); however, a re-
cent replication study failed to confirm these findings, pointing to
both the imperative to replicate early studies and to some of the meth-
odological challenges involved in doing so (McGorry et al., 2017).
Finally, as previously described, the extant nutraceutical literature is
currently limited by methodological issues including heterogeneity, a
lack of randomisation and/or blinding, small samples sizes, insufficient
duration of exposure, and non-representative samples. Therefore,
while the use of nutraceuticals represents a potentially useful and
27
F.N. Jacka / EBioMedicine 17 (2017) 24–29
 efficacious approach to mental disorder treatment, more high-quality,
rigorous clinical trials are required to understand what agents are useful,
to whom, under what circumstances, and at what dosage. Moreover, sys-
tematic investigation into the mechanisms and baseline factors that pre-
dict treatment response, including the potential role of genetics,
inflammation, oxidative stress, and the microbiome in influencing treat-
ment efficacy, is also required. As such, an expansion and improvement
of the existing evidence base regarding nutraceutical supplementation is
a key and outstanding imperative for this new field.
7. Conclusion and Recommendations for Research
The emerging field of Nutritional Psychiatry offers promise for a new
approach to both the prevention and treatment of disorders that account
for the leading disability burden globally. Such investigations are also of
relevance to neurodevelopmental (Borre et al., 2014) and neurodegener-
ative disorders (Jacka et al., 2014b, 2015b); these disorders also impose a
substantial disease burden and are – to date – largely intractable to pre-
vention and treatment. Key challenges for the field are to now: refine,
replicate and scale up clinical and population level dietary interventions;
identify a clear set of biological pathways and targets that mediate the
identified associations; conduct scientifically rigorous nutraceutical and
‘psychobiotic’ interventions that also examine predictors of treatment re-
sponse (e.g. microbiome profiles, baseline nutrient and inflammatory sta-
tus, dietary and other lifestyle behaviours); and conduct observational
and experimental studies in psychosis focused on dietary and related
risk factors and treatments. Finally, there is a need to continue to empha-
sise the likely limitations of dietary change to prevent or treat all cases of
mental ill health. Clearly there are many individuals who consume good
quality diets and who are metabolically healthy, but still suffer from de-
pression or other disorders. The factors that contribute to the develop-
ment of mental disorders are complex and multitudinous and dietary
change should be considered part of a range of lifestyle strategies, includ-
ing exercise and smoking cessation, that may support mental health in
addition to – rather than instead of – other established interventions.
However, given the very large burden of illness imposed by mental disor-
ders and the evidence supporting the importance of nutrition to mental
and brain health, it will be critical to continue to liaise with key allies in
public health to advocate for policy change to improve the food environ-
ment at the population level (Jacka et al., 2014b; Logan and Jacka, 2014),
and to develop knowledge and capacity within clinical settings to pro-
mote the benefits of dietary improvement for those with mental illnesses.
