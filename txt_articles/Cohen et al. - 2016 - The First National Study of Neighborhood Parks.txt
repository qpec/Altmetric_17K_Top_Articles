Abstract
Introduction—An extensive infrastructure of neighborhood parks supports leisure time physical 
activity in most U.S. cities; yet, most Americans do not meet national guidelines for physical 
activity. Neighborhood parks have never been assessed nationally to identify their role in physical 
activity.
Methods—Using a stratified multistage sampling strategy, a representative sample of 174 
neighborhood parks in 25 major cities (population >100,000) across the U.S. was selected. Park 
use, park-based physical activity, and park conditions were observed during a typical week using 
systematic direct observation during spring/summer of 2014. Park administrators were interviewed 
to assess policies and practices. Data were analyzed in 2014–2015 using repeated-measure 
negative binomial regressions to estimate weekly park use and park-based physical activity.
Results—Nationwide, the average neighborhood park of 8.8 acres averaged 23 users/hour or an 
estimated 1,533 person hours of weekly use. Walking loops and gymnasia each generated 221 
hours/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Seniors represented 4% of park users, but 
20% of the general population. Parks were used less in low-income than in high-income 
neighborhoods, largely explained by fewer supervised activities and marketing/outreach efforts.

Design-based estimators
The point estimates were based on the Horvitz-Thompson estimator, where the final weights were the product of sampling inclusion 
weight of parks and the day weights. The sampling inclusion weights of parks were the inverse of the probability of a park being 
sampled, where the inclusion probability was calculated according to stratification and two stage clustering. The day weight was 2.5 
for week days and 1 for weekend days to reflect the observation schedule (2 week days and 2 weekend days in a park). Standard errors 
were calculated using the formulas for stratified two-stage complex survey.28 All analyses were implemented by the Survey package 
in Stata version 13.1 and SAS version 9.4.

 Programming and marketing were associated with 37% and 63% more hours of moderate to 
vigorous physical activity/week in parks, respectively.
Conclusions—The findings establish national benchmarks for park use, which can guide future 
park investments and management practices to improve population health. Offering more 
programming, using marketing tools like banners and posters, and installing facilities like walking 
loops may help currently underutilized parks increase population physical activity.
Introduction
Neighborhood parks with large open spaces constitute infrastructure to support adherence to 
national recommendations for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)—at least 60 
minutes/day for youth and 150 minutes/week for adults.1 Because fewer than half of 
Americans meet these guidelines,2 physicians are being encouraged to routinely counsel 
patients about physical activity and to offer “park prescriptions”, identifying nearby parks 
and recommending regular visits.3,4 Yet, the degree to which parks are designed or managed 
to optimize physical activity for all age groups and genders has not been examined at the 
national level.5,6 Many urban parks were created before climate-controlled indoor spaces 
and electronic visual media existed, when work required more physical activity and labor-
saving devices were less available. Parks were originally designed for leisure, recreation, and 
a chance to make contact with nature, not to specifically promote physical activity.7 Given 
high levels of inactivity and associated chronic diseases, like heart disease, diabetes, and 
cancer,1 it is timely to reconsider parks and their potential to improve the nation's health.
Across the US, more than 9,000 local park and recreation departments and organizations 
manage more than 108,000 public park facilities and 65,000 indoor facilities.8 Parks have 
been categorized by size and facilities into different types, including very small parks (under 
2 acres, also called mini-parks, pocket parks, or parklets), neighborhood parks, community 
and large urban parks, sports complexes, and natural resource areas.9 Neighborhood parks 
are considered the backbone of park systems. They often contain multiple diverse facilities
—playgrounds, picnic tables, basketball courts, green spaces, and shade trees-- allowing 
residents of all ages to recreate there on a routine basis. Neighborhood parks are usually 
between 2 and 20 acres, have more facilities than mini-parks, and are intended to serve local 
residents living within a 1-mile radius around parks.9
Funding for park programming, maintenance, and capital improvements is typically 
allocated from city budgets, which also vary across jurisdictions. Many cities employ staff to 
develop, monitor, and market programs for parks, including classes and special events. It is 
plausible that local park management practices and policies could influence population-level 
physical activity.
Prior studies indicate that sociodemographics, size, facilities, aesthetics, and proximity are 
all important factors contributing to park use,10-19 but most studies are local and have 
limited generalizability.20 To that end the authors conducted a national observational study 
of 174 parks from 25 cities in the US with a population greater than 100,000.28 The goals 
were to determine, at the national level, how neighborhood park systems support population-
level physical activity and to identify factors associated with park use and park activities,

 including facilities, management practices, and disparities between parks in high and low 
income neighborhoods, and to understand how park administrators currently measure park 
use and the potential usefulness of such measures.21
Methods
Study design
A two-stage stratified sampling strategy was used to select a representative sample of 
neighborhood parks in the US cities with a population of ≥ 100,000 according to the 2010 
Census.28 The total 289 cities were divided into nine strata, with eight strata based on 
population (200,000-1,000,000, and 100,000-200,000) and region (West, Northeast, 
Midwest, and South), and the ninth stratum comprising cities with more than 1 million 
population. In the first sampling stage 25 cities were randomly drawn from the nine strata 
(Appendix Figure 1 and Tables 1,2). All states were in the sampling frame, and by chance all 
sampled cities were in the 48 continental states. In each of the 25 selected cities a list of 
public parks was retrieved, either directly supplied by the city's Department of Recreation 
and Parks or from their website. The selection was restricted to avoid parks in close 
proximity (< 1 mile from each other) and to ensure distributions of chosen parks were 
similar with regard to sizes and local poverty rates for all neighborhood parks within each 
city. Parks between 3 and 20 acres were initially targeted,9 but in nearly half the cities large 
numbers of neighborhood parks were slightly below 3 acres or just above 20 acres. As a 
result, the selection criteria were relaxed to include ten parks below 3 acres (between 2.2 and 
2.9 acres) in eight cities and five parks above 20 acres (between 20.1 and 23.0 acres) in five 
cities.
One hundred seventy-four parks were included representing approximately a 10% sample of 
all eligible neighborhood parks in the sampled cities. Parks located in a census tract with no 
or very few residents (airport, prison, military base, hospital, industry facility, etc.), pocket 
parks (< 2 or 3 acres), regional parks (> 20 or 23 acres in some cities), parks used as school 
fields during business hours, and parks serving special purposes only (e.g. parkways, boxing 
gyms, etc.) were excluded. Two parks were replaced because police said they were unsafe 
for staff to visit.
Measurement protocol
Data collection was conducted on clement days between April and August, 2014 using the 
System of Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC), a validated 
observational tool.22 The tool uses momentary time sampling and direct observation 
methods to assess aggregated physical activity levels, demographic characteristics of park 
users, and contextual information. From each of the selected cities two to four local field 
staff were recruited and trained.
Each park was mapped and divided into subareas called target areas that could be observed 
in one scan and typically included one type of facility (e.g., play equipment, basketball 
court, lawn) or supported only one type of activity (e.g., tennis). All the target areas were 
numbered so that every single observation occurred in exactly the same order. Observations

 generally took less than one hour to cover the entire park. Based upon a previous study 
indicating that 12 observations selected on different days and different times of day were 
sufficient for reliably estimating weekly park use,23,24 each park was observed according to 
the following schedule: Tuesday, 8AM, 11AM, and 2PM; Thursday, 12PM, 3PM, and 6PM; 
Saturday, 9AM, 12PM, and 3PM; and Sunday, 11AM, 2PM, and 5PM. During each hourly 
observation, all target areas were assessed for specific characteristics, including whether 
they were accessible, usable, or supervised (i.e., a person was in charge to manage and direct 
activities like a lifeguard, park staff or coach). Parks were observed during a single week, 
except when the weather was inclement; on those occasions the observation was rescheduled 
for the next available day (same time of day and day of week) that was not raining.
Each park user in a target area was categorized into one of 24 groups defined by gender 
(male, female), age group, (child, teen, adult, senior), and physical activity level (sedentary 
[e.g. seated, standing], moderate [e.g. walking], vigorous [e.g. running, climbing]). At the 
end of each day, staff completed an assessment of the park conditions, including weather, 
noise, marketing materials (e.g. banners, posters), the amount of litter and graffiti, and 
presence of apparently homeless individuals, people appearing threatening or engaged in 
altercations, and park staff, food vendors, or special events.
During visits, field staff also documented park features and amenities, including signage and 
marketing for park activities, adapted from previously validated park assessment tools.25-27 
To better understand management practices, park administrative staff were surveyed.
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed in 2014-15. Estimates of total weekly park use are based on the 
assumption that, a park was, on average, usable at least 11 hours a day (between 8AM and 
7PM), 7 days a week. Because field staff missed roughly 1% of scheduled target area 
observations by scan hour level, the mean imputation method was used to impute missing 
data.28 To adjust for the complex sampling strategy, design-based estimators were applied to 
estimate average weekly park use in person-hours/week (Appendix).
Moderate and vigorous activity were combined into one category to match with the national 
recommendations for physical activity. To identify factors associated with hourly park use 
and park activities, repeated-measure generalized linear models were fit. The negative 
binomial distribution was used for the outcome due to variance inflation. Binary indicators 
were used for different days of a week and different hours of a day to allow for a flexible 
temporal trend and also included daily weather variables (maximum, minimum, and mean 
temperature), park size, population density, park facilities, accessibility of facilities, 
presence of supervised activities, and the observed park conditions described above.
Associations with predictors were tested by the robust generalized estimation equation 
(GEE) method,29 which accounted for temporal correlations within a park and spatial 
correlations within a city. Neighborhood demographics and socio-economic data were drawn 
from the US Census 2010 and the American Community Survey 2012.30,31 All analyses 
were done in SAS version 9.4 and Stata version 13.1.

 Results
Considering all 174 study parks, the median local population within a 1-mile radius of a 
park was 12,400 people and the median percentage of households in poverty was 17.8%. 
The mean park size was 8.8 acres (range = 2.2-23.0 acres) and parks had a median of 17 
(range = 3-101) target areas and 5 (range = 1 - 11) different facility types (Table 1). 
Although staff observed a mean of 5 supervised activities in park target areas over the 12 
observation periods, the median was zero--more than half the parks had no supervised 
programming at all.
Table 2 shows the most common facilities in neighborhood parks and how much each 
contributed to MVPA for children and teens or adults and seniors. The most common park 
facilities were lawns (97%) and play areas (89%). Nearly half the parks had outdoor 
basketball courts (53%) and baseball fields (49%), 31% had tennis courts and 29% had a 
walking loop. Almost all facilities (97%) were rated usable and 98% were accessible.
On average, the park facility that generated the most MVPA time for adults and seniors was 
a walking loop, where 9% of users were seniors versus 4% in other park areas (data not 
shown). Children and teens accrued similar amounts of MVPA on walking loops as they did 
in a pool or skate park. After walking loops and gymnasiums, fitness zones and exercise 
areas generated the next highest amounts of MVPA for adults and seniors.
Across the 174 parks staff counted 77,300 people during 2088 hourly observations. 
Assuming a park is usable at least 77 hours/week (11 hours/day between 8AM and 7PM, 7 
days/week), adjusting for survey design, it was estimated that the national average park use 
was 1,533 person-hours per week (95% CI: 930, 2,140). Weekly park use varied greatly 
across the parks (range = 0-26,260 person-hours), and the estimated average hourly use was 
20 people per park. Seventy-five percent of target area-level observations recorded no users.
Disparities in Park Use
Table 3 shows significant disparities by gender and age group in park use and park-based 
MVPA. Overall more park users were male (57%) and they accounted for 60% of estimated 
MVPA person hours. The gender disparity was the greatest for teens. Male teens accounted 
for 65% of teen visitors and 68% of teen MVPA person hours (p <.05). Park visitation by 
age group was significantly different than that in the general population (p<.0001). The 
distribution of park users included 38% children and 13% teens, but of the total US 
population, children and teens represent 20% and 7% respectively. Seniors (aged ≥60 years) 
represented only 4% of observed park visitors but comprise 20% of the general population.
There were significant disparities in park use and park characteristics by socio-economic 
status (data not shown). Within the same city, parks in high-poverty neighborhoods 
(identified as above the median of the local poverty levels of all parks in the city) tended to 
be smaller than those in low-poverty neighborhoods (7.8 vs. 10.0 acres; p = 0.003). 
However, there was no difference in the number of accessible facilities. Parks in high 
poverty areas were used less than parks in low-poverty neighborhoods: (1380 versus 1690 
person hours/week, p<.0001) and they had significantly fewer supervised areas (average of

 2.1 vs. 4.5; p = 0.012). Litter was observed more often in low-income area parks, but not 
more graffiti. There was no difference in the presence of homeless people or dogs off leash 
in high versus low income area parks.
Predictors of park use
None of the weather variables were associated with park use or physical activity in any 
model, so these were eliminated. Three basic factors associated with the number of observed 
park users were first examined: park size, local population density, and local neighborhood 
household poverty levels (Model 1 in Table 4). On average, keeping the other two predictors 
constant, 1 additional acre was associated with 9% increase in park use (β=0.09, p<.0001); 
10,000 additional population living in a 1-mile radius was associated with an 13% increase 
in park use (β=0.12, p<.0001); and a 10-percentage point increase in the local household 
poverty level was associated with a 12% decrease in park use (β=−0.01, p=0.04). The 
pattern of relationships between these factors and the amount of MVPA person hours 
occurring in the parks was similar to the model predicting the number of park users (bottom 
of Table 4).
Model 2 includes multiple other observed park characteristics. Park size was not significant 
after controlling for other related factors in the model. Supervised activities and onsite 
marketing were significantly related to increased park use and MVPA person hours. Every 
additional supervised activity increased mean park use by 48% (β= 0.39; p <0.0001) and the 
mean MVPA time by 37% (β=0.37; p < 0.0001). The presence of marketing materials, such 
as banners, posters, and signs was associated with a 62% (β=0.48; p=0.003) increase in the 
number of park users and 63% (β= 0.49; p< 0.001) increase in MVPA person-hours. Each 
additional accessible target area (e.g., basketball court, tennis court, play area) was 
associated with 2% more person-hours of park use (β=0.02, p=0.03) and 2% more minutes 
of MVPA (β=0.02, p=0.006).
Staff interviewed senior administrators from all 25 city park systems in the study. None 
routinely measured park use, other than by tracking whether people registered for specific 
programs or sports leagues. Although two park systems reported doing annual resident 
surveys and using population-level results to inform programming decisions, most provided 
“user-driven” recreational services by responding to requests of vocal citizens. All 
administrators said that park measurements would be useful to guide management decisions, 
targeting and programming, but they currently lacked the necessary skills and resources. 
Limitations in resources were a major barrier to park improvements; among administrators 
of 119 parks (68%) who answered survey questions about resources, roughly 50% indicated 
their parks had budget and staff decreases in the past two years and 40% indicated no 
changes. Only 10% reported budget increases.
Discussion
Conditions in local neighborhood parks can potentially support or limit physical activity. 
The mere presence of a park does not guarantee its use, even when many facilities are 
usable. This study identified multiple disparities in park use, especially low use among 
adults, seniors, girls, and women and lower use in higher-poverty neighborhoods, suggesting 
Cohen et al.

 efforts to improve services for these subpopulations are necessary. Although it is critically 
important for adults and seniors to engage in routine physical activity, most parks are geared 
toward serving youths rather than adults. Few programmed activities that specifically 
targeted adults and seniors were documented. Given that physical activity may have more 
immediate benefits for adults and seniors as far as preventing or mitigating the impact of 
chronic diseases, park systems should consider adding enhancements, like walking loops, 
and more programming that would appeal to older age groups. Neighborhood parks may not 
be adequately serving low-income groups, even though their parks have similar facilities to 
those serving higher income groups. These models suggest that disparities in these 
neighborhoods might be largely overcome by offering more supervised activities, and 
engaging in greater marketing/outreach efforts.
Limitations
This first national observational study of neighborhood parks is cross-sectional so it cannot 
be concluded that the associations between park features, programming, and physical 
activity are causal. However, many other longitudinal studies have shown that investments in 
outreach, programming and park improvements do increase park-based physical 
activity.32-36 Because the observations were limited to the spring and early summer, a time 
when parks may be used more than in other seasons, and all observations for a park were 
conducted over a short period (usually within one week), it may not be possible to estimate 
annual use based on these data. Weather did not appear related to park use, in part because 
these models already controlled for city which is correlated with temperature. These 
estimates, however, do provide a snapshot of park use by age, gender, and activity level. In 
addition, given limited resources, park users and local residents were not interviewed about 
their perspectives on park use and which features they considered more attractive or the 
degree to which their perceptions on park safety might have influenced use of neighborhood 
parks. It is likely that some of the lower use of parks in high-poverty neighborhoods might 
be explained by concerns about personal safety. However, the models suggest that park size, 
supervised activities, and marketing materials each has a comparable or larger effect size 
than the local poverty level, which has been correlated with safety concerns.37 Also, parks 
were observed only between 8AM and 7PM, precluding estimation of park use occurring 
before or after these hours. Previous research observing parks 14 hours/day suggest that 
8AM-7PM is when parks are typically used most.23
The current investment in urban parks across the US is relatively small, considering the 
potential benefits they may yield in health. Physical inactivity contributes to a high 
proportion of chronic diseases and is directly responsible for 11% of all deaths.38 Yet among 
the 100 largest US cities, the average annual per capita expenditure for parks in 2013 was 
$73 (range $9-$247),39 less than 0.8% of the $9,146 per capita expenditure on health care in 
the same year.40 Neighborhood parks are challenged by being financed at the local level, 
although limited federal dollars are sometimes available through Community Development 
Block Grants and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Private philanthropy can help, 
although it rarely occurs in lower-income neighborhoods. Relatively modest investments 
may improve neighborhood park conditions to make them conducive to physical activity for 
everyone, regardless of age, gender, or income-level.

aAssumes that a park is usable 7 days a week and 11 hours a day. All estimates have adjusted for the multi-stage survey sampling design. Estimates 
for bleachers were the marginal means across all parks. Estimates for other facility types controlled for park size, local population, poverty, 
observation time, and temporal correlation and were based on the comparisons with respect to bleachers.
