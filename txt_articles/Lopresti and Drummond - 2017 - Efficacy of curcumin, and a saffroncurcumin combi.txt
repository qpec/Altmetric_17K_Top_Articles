ABSTRACT 
Background:  
Several studies have supported the antidepressant effects of curcumin (from the spice turmeric) 
and saffron for people with major depressive disorder. However, these studies have been 
hampered by poor designs, small sample sizes, short treatment duration, and similar intervention 
dosages. Furthermore, the antidepressant effects of combined curcumin and saffron 
administration are unknown.  
 
Methods: 
In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 123 individuals with major depressive 
disorder were allocated to one of four treatment conditions, comprising placebo, low-dose 
curcumin extract (250mg b.i.d.), high-dose curcumin extract (500mg b.i.d.), or combined low-dose 
curcumin extract plus saffron (15mg b.i.d.) for 12 weeks. The outcome measures were the 
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated version (IDS-SR30) and Spielberger State-
Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). 
 
Results:  
The active drug treatments (combined) were associated with significantly greater improvements 
in depressive symptoms compared to placebo (p=.031), and superior improvements in STAI-state 
(p<.001) and STAI-trait scores (p=.001). Active drug treatments also had greater efficacy in people 
with atypical depression compared to the remainder of patients (response rates of 65% versus 
35% respectively, p=.012). No differences were found between the differing doses of curcumin or 
the curcumin/saffron combination.  
 
  
 
Limitations: Investigations with larger sample sizes are required to examine the efficacy of 
differing doses of curcumin and saffron/curcumin combination. Its effects in people with atypical 
depression also require examination in larger scale studies. 
 
Conclusions: Active drug treatments comprising differing doses of curcumin and combined 
curcumin/saffron were effective in reducing depressive and anxiolytic symptoms in people with 
major depressive disorder.  
 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Major depressive disorder affects 6 to 8 percent of adults every year, and has a lifetime 
prevalence of 15 to 20 percent (Gelenberg, 2010; Richards, 2011). It is a disabling condition that 
has adverse effects on personal, social, occupational, and educational function. Depression is also 
associated with significant medical difficulties as there is a greater risk of mortality from all 
causes in people with depression compared to their non-depressed counterparts (Kozela et al., 
2016). In fact, according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2008), depression is the 
leading cause of disability as measured by Years Lived with a Disability and the fourth leading 
contributor to the global burden of disease. In a recent examination of a cohort of Danish adults, 
depression was associated with a reduced life expectancy of 14 years in men and 10 years in 
women (Laursen et al., 2016). 
Major depressive disorder is primarily treated with psychological and/or pharmacological 
therapies, with research suggesting similar rates of efficacy (Sinyor et al., 2010). Unfortunately, 
these rates are far from ideal as approximately 60 to 80 percent of people do not obtain full 
symptom remission (Sinyor et al., 2010; Warden et al., 2007). Pharmacological interventions are 
also associated with several adverse effects that contribute to their early discontinuation (Goethe 
et al., 2007). 
  
 
Interest in alternative and complementary therapies is high, as evidenced by a 2007 study 
confirming almost 50 percent of women with depression used complementary and alternative 
medicine over a one year period (Wu et al., 2007). In a more recent study of adults with bipolar 
disorder, 29 percent had used a dietary supplement for at least 7 days, and 20 percent used a 
supplement long term (Bauer et al., 2015). A commonly cited reason for their use relates to their 
perceived safety profile. Unfortunately, high-quality research on many herbal and nutraceutical 
therapies for depression is limited, reinforcing the need for ongoing research. 
Curcumin, derived from the spice turmeric, and saffron (Crocus Sativus L.), are two commonly 
used spices that have been increasingly investigated for their antidepressant effects. In recent 
meta-analyses and systematic reviews, it was concluded that curcumin (Al-Karawi et al., 2015) 
and saffron (Hausenblas et al., 2013; Lopresti and Drummond, 2014) were more effective than 
placebo for the treatment of major depressive disorder. In several studies, saffron’s 
antidepressant effects were also found to be similar to the antidepressant medications fluoxetine 
(Akhondzadeh Basti et al., 2007; Noorbala et al., 2005; Shahmansouri et al., 2014) and imipramine 
(Akhondzadeh et al., 2004). However, further research is warranted, particularly in determining 
optimal treatment dosages and length of treatment. Thus far, no study has been longer than 8 
weeks, and investigated doses have often been similar across studies. 
In previous studies on the antidepressant effects of curcumin extracts, a daily dose of 500mg 
b.i.d. has most commonly been used. We sought to determine whether a lower dose comprising 
250mg b.i.d. would have similar antidepressant and anxiolytic efficacy. In addition, our aim was 
to investigate whether saffron augmented the antidepressant effect of curcumin. Both of these 
compounds appear to have similar antidepressant biological mechanisms of action, namely 
through their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, monaminergic, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal 
(HPA) modulating, and neuroprotective effects (Lopresti and Drummond, 2014; Lopresti et al., 
2012). However, saffron also contains four major bioactive compounds, crocins, crocetin, 
  
 
picrocrocin and safranal, which are believed to contribute to its antidepressant activity. We 
hypothesized that the combination of saffron and curcumin, with its broader profile of active 
constituents, would lead to enhanced antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. 
Our aim was also to investigate the symptomatic effects and safety profile of these spices over 
a 12-week period, making it the longest study to date on these ingredients for the treatment of 
major depression. As curcumin has shown particular promise in adults with atypical depression 
(Lopresti et al., 2014), its effects in participants with this subtype of depression were also 
examined.   
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Study design 
This was a 12-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with a 1-week, 
placebo run-in phase (Figure 1). The trial protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics 
Committee at Murdoch University, Western Australia. The trial was registered with the 
Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (Trial ID. ACTRN12615000791538) and 
participants were recruited through social and print media advertisements between August 2015 
and February 2016, across the Perth, Western Australia metropolitan region.  
Participants were randomly and equally allocated into four groups (placebo, high-dose 
curcumin, low-dose curcumin, and low-dose curcumin/ saffron combination) using a 
randomisation calculator (http://www.randomization.com). The randomisation structure 
comprised 8 randomly permuted blocks, containing 20 subjects per block. All capsules were 
packed in identical containers labelled by participant code numbers and were allocated according 
to order of participant enrolment in the study. 
  
 
An a priori power analysis was undertaken to estimate required sample size. We predicted a 
moderate effect size of 0.7 for the treatment groups. Assuming a power of 80% and a type one 
error rate (alpha) of 5%, the number of participants per group to find an effect was estimated as 
34. 
Participants 
Inclusion criteria: Male and female participants aged 18 to 65 years were eligible to 
participate if they met the DSM-IV criteria for current major depressive disorder and had an 
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated version (IDS-SR30) score ≥ 18. The diagnosis 
of major depression and atypical depression subtype was made by the first author, an 
experienced clinical psychologist, using The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6.0 
(MINI 6.0) (Sheehan et al., 1998). Pharmaceutical antidepressants, herbal/vitamin supplements, 
the use of the contraceptive pill and no more than once a week use of analgesics were 
permissible. If participants were on pharmaceutical antidepressants or supplements, the drug 
dosage or type must have been stable for the past 4 weeks and throughout the duration of the 
study. Volunteers were not currently taking turmeric/ curcumin supplements. If volunteers were 
receiving psychological therapy, the treatment must have commenced at least 8 weeks prior to 
participating in the study. 
Exclusion criteria: participants with a psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, comorbid 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorder, or any substance 
abuse or dependence disorder were excluded, as were participants assessed as having high risk 
of suicide. Participants were asked about drug use in the initial interview but a drug screen was 
not conducted. Volunteers were also excluded if they suffered from self-reported medical 
illnesses including diabetes, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, 
neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, and multiple 
  
 
sclerosis), chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia or asthma; were pregnant or intended to fall 
pregnant; currently breastfeeding; had suffered from an infection or illness over the past month; 
were currently taking any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications; or had been diagnosed with 
any coagulation disorder. 
Interventions 
Placebo (cellulose), curcumin, and curcumin/saffron capsules were supplied by Dolcas-
Biotech LLT. (New Jersey, USA), and were identical in appearance. All participants were 
commenced on a one-week, placebo run-in phase, where they were instructed to take one 
capsule, twice daily. After this blinded, one-week phase, they were then randomly allocated to 
one of four treatment conditions comprising twice-daily intake of the following capsules: (1) 
placebo, (2) low-dose curcumin containing 250mg of the patent curcumin, BCM-95® (LDC), (3) 
high-dose curcumin containing 500mg of BCM-95® (HDC), and (4) low-dose curcumin/ saffron 
combination, containing 250mg of BCM-95® and 15mg of saffron (LDC+S). Participants were 
directed to take capsules with or without food for 12 weeks.  
Curcumin used in the capsules was derived from BCM-95® which contains total curcuminoids 
88% (curcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin) and volatile oils 7% from 
rhizomes of Curcuma longa Linn. Saffron (affron®), was derived from the stigmas of Crocus sativus 
L. and is standardised to contain >3.5% Lepticrosalides® (a measure of bioactive compounds 
present in saffron, including safranal and crocin). Medication compliance was measured by 
volunteer-reported pill count at weeks 4 and 8, and 12. Efficacy of participant treatment blinding 
was measured by asking participants to predict group allocation (placebo vs real drug treatment) 
at the completion of the study. 
  
 
Outcomes 
Self-report questionnaires 
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated version (IDS-SR30): The IDS-SR30 was used as 
the primary outcome measure. It contains 30 items measuring depressive symptoms based on the 
DSM-IV criteria for major depressive episode (Rush et al., 1986; Rush et al., 1996).  Respondents 
were asked to rate the severity and frequency of specific symptoms present over the past 7 days. 
The IDS-SR30 has acceptable psychometric properties in depressed outpatients (Rush et al., 2000; 
Rush et al., 1996; Trivedi et al., 2004) and correlates highly with common depression inventories 
such as the HRSD17, BDI, and MADRS (Corruble et al., 1999; Rush et al., 2000; Rush et al., 1996). 
The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): The STAI is a self-report tool for assessing 
anxiety consisting of two subscales (state and trait anxiety) each containing 20 items (Spielberger, 
1983). The STAI is among the most widely researched and commonly used measures of general 
anxiety and has excellent reliability and validity (Metzger, 1976; Okun et al., 1996). The STAI was 
considered an appropriate measure given its strong correlation with measures of depression 
(Kennedy et al., 2001). 
Statistical analysis 
Treatment condition on mood measures 
Two successive analyses were conducted. The first used data from all eligible participants, 
while a second planned analysis compared data from participants diagnosed with atypical 
depression to participants with other depression.  
A one-way ANOVA was used to compare demographic variables across the treatment groups 
for continuous variables, and Pearson’s Chi-square was used to compare categorical data. 
  
 
Individual mood measures (IDS-SR30, STAI) were assessed for differences between baseline and 
the three other time points (weeks 4, 8 and 12) using a mixed repeated-measures analysis of 
variance (ANOVA). Analyses for time (baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 12) within each 
treatment condition, and treatment (LDC, HDC, LDC+S, and placebo) x time effects were 
conducted. Planned contrasts were conducted to investigate treatment x time interactions 
between combined drug treatments (LDC, HDC, & LDC+S) and placebo (to determine whether, 
overall, curcumin was associated with anti-depressant effects); HDC and LDC (to investigate 
dose-response effects of curcumin); and LDC and LDC+S (to determine whether saffron 
augmented the anti-depressant effects of curcumin). There were no significant outliers in data as 
assessed by the visual inspection of Q-Q plots. Although questionnaire data were not normalised, 
repeated measures ANOVA was considered appropriate for statistical analyses as it is relatively 
robust to violations of normality (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007).  Where necessary, degrees of 
freedom were adjusted using the Greenhouse-Geisser approach to correct for violations of the 
sphericity assumption. 
A further analysis was undertaken to compare response rates across treatment conditions. 
Greater than 50 percent reduction in IDS score was defined as a responder and was used for 
statistical comparisons across treatment conditions.  
Participants’ questionnaire data were used if they experienced less than a 30% change in IDS-
SR30 score following the 1-week placebo run-in phase. This was done in an attempt to reduce the 
impact of placebo-effects, and/or to exclude participants with volatile depressive symptoms. 
Questionnaire scores following the one-week, placebo run-in phase were used as baseline data. 
Data from participants were included in analyses if questionnaire data were obtained at week 4 
(intention to treat, with last observation carried forward for missing values).  
For all the tests, statistical significance was set at P< 0.05 (two-tailed). All data were analysed 
using SPSS (version 22; IBM, Armonk, NY). 
  
 
RESULTS 
Study Population 
Baseline questionnaire and demographic information 
309 people were screened for participation in the study and 160 met inclusion/ exclusion 
criteria and were enrolled to participate. All 160 participants were placed on placebo for one-
week prior to randomisation into treatment conditions. Seven people failed to take capsules 
and/or complete repeat questionnaires after the first week, and 30 people experienced greater 
than a 30 percent change in IDS score following the 1-week, placebo, run-in phase, leaving data 
from 123 participants available for analysis. Sample sizes for each treatment condition comprised 
36 in the placebo, 33 in HDC, 28 in LDC, and 26 in LDC+S conditions.   
111 participants complied with all necessary treatment requirements (i.e., consumed >70% of 
capsules and completed all self-report inventories) over the 12-week trial. Five dropped out of the 
placebo condition, 3 in the HDC condition, 2 in the LDC condition, and 2 in the LDC+S condition.  
There were no significant differences between the dropout rates across groups. Reasons for 
withdrawal included medication change, no response/ lost to follow up, and inconsistent capsule 
intake. No participants withdrew from the study due to reported adverse effects from capsule 
intake. 
As shown in Table 1, there were no significant differences between the groups on any baseline 
mood questionnaire score or demographic variable. 
 
 
Exploratory analyses were conducted on 80 participants placed on active drug treatments 
based on depressive subtype (atypical depression, n =34; other depression, n=46). There were no 
  
 
significant differences in baseline mood questionnaires or demographic variables based on these 
depressive subtypes. 
Outcome Measures 
Treatment effects on mood measures 
IDS – Depression measures 
Changes in IDS scores across all treatment groups and repeated measures ANOVA 
significance levels are listed in Table 2. There was a significant reduction in IDS scores across all 
groups over time although IDS scores decreased in the placebo condition only in the first 4 weeks 
of treatment. In contrast, IDS scores decreased in the active drug conditions at several additional 
time points.  
A direct comparison between all active drug treatments combined and placebo revealed a 
significant time x group interaction for IDS from baseline to week 12 (F2.56,279 = 3.181, p = .031). 
Comparisons between HDC and LDC (F2.28,121 = 0.444, p = .675), and LDC and LDC+S (F2.49,120 = 
0.329, p = .766) revealed non-significant time x group interactions for IDS. Changes in depressive 
symptoms are detailed in Figure 2. 
An analysis of IDS response rates revealed the following; 13% in placebo, 28% in active 
treatments combined, 28% in HDC, 27% in LDC, and 31% in LDC+S. The difference in response 
rates between placebo and active treatments combined approached but did not achieve statistical 
significance (χ2(1) = 3.187, p = .074).  
STAI – Anxiety measures 
Changes in STAI-state (STAI-S) and STAI-trait (STAI-T) scores across all treatment groups and 
repeated measures ANOVA significance values are listed in Table 2. Both STAI sub-scale scores 
  
 
decreased significantly across all active drug treatment conditions. STAI-T also decreased 
significantly in the placebo group whereas STAI-S remained stable.  
A direct comparison between all active drug treatments combined and placebo revealed a 
significant time x group interaction for STAI-S (F2.75,300 = 7.201, p < .001) and STAI-T (F2.42,264 = 
6.162, p = .001) from baseline to week 12, favouring active drug treatments. A repeated measures 
ANOVA comparing (1) HDC and LDC, and (2) LDC and LDC+S revealed no significant group x 
time interactions for any STAI subscale scores. Changes in anxiety symptoms are detailed in 
Figure 2. 
Atypical Depression Sub-group 
A comparison between the effectiveness of combined drug treatments in participants 
diagnosed with atypical depression, compared to other depressed participants revealed greater 
efficacy in people with atypical depression in all of the measures used. When using data from all 
the active drug treatments combined, several significant time x group interactions were 
identified. Active drug treatments were significantly more effective for people with atypical 
depression compared to other depressed participants for IDS (F2.64,206 = 4.471, p = .007), STAI-S 
(F2.84,222 = 7.569, p < .001), STAI-T (F2.42,189 = 4.394, p = .009) (figure 3).  
A response rate of 65% was identified in people with atypical depression compared to 35% in 
participants with other depression (χ2(1) = 6.34, p = .012). 
Adverse events 
Details of adverse events reported by participants are listed in Table 3. All reported adverse 
events were of minor severity. There were no significant differences between reported adverse 
events between placebo and active drug treatment groups, although there was a trend suggesting 
increased diarrhoea/ loose bowels in the HDC group, and spicy aftertaste in the HDC and LDC 
group. 
  
 
 
Participant Blinding 
In order to evaluate the efficacy of condition concealment over the study, participants were 
asked at the completion of the study to predict his/her condition allocation (i.e., placebo vs real 
drug treatment). Efficacy of group concealment was shown to be high as the following correct 
predictions were obtained from participants: 55% in LDC, 56% in HDC, 65% in LDC+S, and 68% 
placebo. 
DISCUSSION 
The results of this study add to the existing evidence on the beneficial antidepressant and 
anxiolytic effects of curcumin in people suffering from major depressive disorder. The addition of 
saffron to low-dose curcumin did not enhance treatment efficacy. 
Compared to a placebo, the 12-week administration of active drug treatments comprising 
HDC, LDC, or LDC+S was associated with significantly greater improvements in depressive 
symptoms. A response rate (reduction of greater than 50% in depressive symptoms) of 28% was 
achieved in people on active treatments combined compared to 13% in people on placebo. 
However, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Improvements in depressive 
symptoms were found across each measured 4-week time interval in people taking the active 
drug treatments. In contrast, depressive symptoms improved only in the first 4 weeks of 
treatment in people placed on placebo. Interestingly, this pattern was also observed in a previous 
study by our research group (Lopresti et al., 2014) where placebo effects were identified only in 
the first 4 weeks of treatment. We attempted to minimise this placebo effect by including a one-
week, placebo run-in phase; however, placebo benefits apparently persisted for longer than this 
one-week period. 
  
 
The positive antidepressant effects of curcumin in people with major depressive disorder have 
now been verified in four clinical trials. In a study by Sanmukhani and colleagues (2014), the 6-
week administration of curcumin (1,000mg of BCM-95®, daily) was as effective as the  
antidepressant, fluoxetine. However, this study was flawed by its single-blinded design 
(researcher masked). In a randomised, double-blind study, conducted by our research group, 
there was partial support for the antidepressant effects of a patented curcumin extract (500mg 
b.i.d.) as evidenced by significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms from weeks 4 
to 8 compared to placebo (Lopresti et al., 2014). In a 6-week, double-blind, placebo controlled 
study, Yu and colleagues (2015) demonstrated greater antidepressant effects of curcumin 
(1,000mg/day of a standard curcumin extract) compared to placebo. In another study, the adjunct 
administration of 1,000mg of curcumin to antidepressant treatment enhanced treatment gains 
compared to antidepressant treatment alone (Panahi et al., 2015). However, this study was 
flawed by its open-label design.  
In addition to the beneficial antidepressant effects of curcumin, our findings suggest beneficial 
anxiolytic effects in people with major depressive disorder. Volunteers on the active drug 
treatments experienced significantly greater improvements in anxiety compared to placebo over 
the 12-week intervention. This was evidenced by improvements in both the State and Trait scores 
of the STAI. This anxiolytic benefit was also observed in our previous study of curcumin in 
depression (Lopresti et al., 2014). Interestingly, a study on the effects of curcumin in obese 
individuals demonstrated no significant changes in depressive symptoms compared to a placebo, 
although there were significant improvements in anxiety symptoms (Esmaily et al., 2015). 
However, this sample did not comprise adults with diagnosed major depressive disorder. 
Findings from several animal studies suggest that curcumin has anxiolytic effects, potentially 
via its HPA-modulating, monaminergic, and neuroprotective effects (Benammi et al., 2014; 
Haider et al., 2015). In a recent study, saffron was also found to be beneficial in reducing anxiety 
  
 
symptoms in people with depression and anxiety (Mazidi et al., 2016). This observation is 
promising as anxiety has been reported as an adverse effect following saffron administration 
(Lopresti and Drummond, 2014).  
Our findings indicate that the active drug treatments were associated with improvements in 
both State and Trait anxiety. State anxiety is a measure of present state anxiety/ tension, whereas 
trait anxiety is considered a measure of relatively stable anxiety. In the STAI, trait anxiety is 
measured with the specifier ‘how you generally feel’ (Spielberger, 1983). The improvement in 
trait anxiety over the 12-week intervention suggests that the active drug treatments have 
relatively enduring effects on anxiety symptoms. Mechanisms require further investigation but 
could involve curcumin’s potential neuroprotective and HPA-modulating effects. 
A comparison of the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of two different dosages of 
curcumin did not reveal any significant differences in overall efficacy. These non-significant 
differences suggest that therapeutic/ optimal dosages are realised at the lower daily dose of 
500mg of BCM-95® (approx. 440mg of curcuminoids) or, alternatively, that there was insufficient 
power to detect the magnitude of differing efficacies. A similar statistically non-significant 
finding was also observed when comparing LDC with the LDC+S combination. Again, this may 
reflect an insufficiently powered study to detect subtle differences, or that optimal benefits can be 
obtained from stand-alone curcumin treatment. Conclusions about the antidepressant efficacy of 
saffron alone cannot be made as this was not examined in our study. 
In a previous study conducted by our research group, curcumin had stronger antidepressant 
efficacy in people with atypical depression (Lopresti et al., 2014). Atypical depression represents 
approximately 40 percent of adults with depression and comprises the following symptoms: 
mood reactivity as evidenced by mood improvement following positive events, plus at least two 
symptoms comprising hypersomnia, increased appetite or weight gain, increased sensitivity to 
rejection, leaden paralysis, or a long-standing pattern of interpersonal sensitivity to rejection 
  
 
(Singh and Williams, 2006). The present findings provide further support for the enhanced 
benefits of curcumin in adults with atypical depression. The 12-week administration of the active 
drug treatments was significantly more effective in people with atypical depression compared to 
other depressed participants (response rates of 65% and 35%, respectively). Greater 
improvements state and trait anxiety were also observed in people with atypical depression 
compared to the other depressed participants. 
Superior improvements of curcumin treatment in people with atypical depression could be 
due to elevated inflammation in this subgroup. Compared to healthy individuals, and people 
with melancholic or non-atypical depression, atypical depression is associated with higher levels 
of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) (Hickman et al., 2013; Lamers et al., 
2013), IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (Lamers et al., 2013). Curcumin is traditionally 
considered a potent natural anti-inflammatory with a meta-analysis on clinical trials confirming 
that it lowers CRP levels (Sahebkar, 2014). It can also lower IL-6 (Belcaro et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 
2011) and TNF-α levels (Aggarwal et al., 2013).  
A comparison of the reported adverse effects across different treatment conditions suggest 
that curcumin and the curcumin/saffron combination were well tolerated over a 12-week period. 
There were no statistically significant differences in reported adverse effects compared to 
placebo, despite a trend toward greater incidence of diarrhoea/ loose bowels in the HDC group, 
and spicy aftertaste in the HDC and LDC group. However, these symptoms were not severe 
enough to result in any withdrawals from treatment. 
Limitations and Directions for Future Research 
The population of individuals recruited for this study comprised approximately 70 percent 
suffering from chronic or recurring episodes of depression. Over 50 percent of individuals 
reported struggling with depression for more than 10 years, while another 20 percent reported 
  
 
suffering depression for 6 to 10 years. Approximately 50 percent of participants were also using 
antidepressant medications, and 15% were receiving psychological therapy. Although curcumin 
was effective in reducing depressive and anxiety-related symptoms, it is likely that the benefits of 
treatment were smaller in this population of depressed adults than in others with more recent 
onset of depression. Thus, investigations into the efficacy of curcumin and saffron in individuals 
with early onset depression may produce stronger findings. 
Although an overall sample size of 160 participants was used in the study, data from 
participants experiencing significant depressive changes over the 1-week, placebo run-in phase 
were excluded in analysis. This resulted in a sample size of 123 individuals distributed over four 
treatment conditions. This negatively impacted on the power of the study to detect differing 
efficacies across conditions, particularly between the differing active treatments. Although 
several significant findings were obtained in this study, the capacity to detect small differences 
across groups was compromised. This increased the potential for type II errors (i.e., failing to 
reject the null hypothesis when it was false). Based on estimates using an effect size of 0.4 
between active treatments, future studies with sample sizes over 100 per group will be necessary, 
particularly when examining the efficacies of differing dosages and combination ingredients. 
Moreover, the multiple statistical comparisons undertaken in our analyses increased the potential 
for type I errors (i.e., rejecting the null hypothesis when it was true). However, as analyses were 
based on planned rather than post hoc comparisons, no adjustment to p-values was made. We 
acknowledge that this increases the risk for type I error, so replication of the findings in future 
adequately-powered studies will be required to confirm the validity of our findings. 
Assessment of symptomatic changes relied on two self-report instruments. Although these 
questionnaires have satisfactory reliability and validity, the use of additional measures and 
clinician-rated instruments would have been desirable.  
  
 
Two doses of curcumin were compared in this study, along with a curcumin/saffron 
combination. The findings from this study suggest that the addition of saffron did not enhance 
the efficacy of low-dose curcumin. In addition, an increased dose of curcumin did not enhance 
treatment outcomes.  These findings suggest that there was insufficient power in the study to 
detect group differences, or that there was a ceiling antidepressant effect of these natural spices. 
This ceiling may have been achieved with the administration of the low-dose curcumin alone. 
The inclusion of a stand-alone saffron condition would be desirable in future studies.  
Future examination of these compounds should also take into consideration quality and 
bioavailability. We used a patented curcumin extract (BCM-95®), demonstrated to have 
increased bioavailability compared to standard curcumin, and a curcumin/piperine combination 
(Antony et al., 2008). Whether similar antidepressant efficacy can be achieved with other 
curcumin extracts requires investigation. There should be similar considerations when evaluating 
the efficacy of saffron. In previous studies the stigma and petal of Crocus Sativus L have been 
used. Although a 30mg daily dose of dried saffron extracts has most commonly been evaluated, 
the quality of such extracts is likely to be variable. In some studies, saffron was standardised for 
crocin and/or safranal, while in others no standardisations were reported (Lopresti and 
Drummond, 2014). In the present study we used a patented saffron extract (affron®) 
standardised for Lepticrosalides (a measure of bioactive compounds present in saffron, including 
safranal and crocin). Quality of saffron extracts may influence antidepressant and anxiolytic 
efficacy. 
Finally, it would be valuable to examine the efficacy of curcumin and saffron as an adjunct to 
antidepressant medication. In a recent study by Talaei and colleagues (2015) it was demonstrated 
that crocin, the active constituent in saffron, augmented pharmaceutical antidepressant 
outcomes. Inconsistent findings have been reported with the adjunct use of curcumin and 
antidepressants, as evidenced by one positive (Panahi et al., 2015) and two negative studies 
  
 
(Bergman et al., 2013; Sanmukhani et al., 2014). However, these studies contained significant 
study design flaws. 
In conclusion, the present findings provide support for the antidepressant and anxiolytic 
effects of curcumin in people with major depressive disorder, although no significant differences 
in efficacy between high and low-doses (500mg versus 1,000mg of BCM-95®, daily) were 
detected. The addition of saffron to low-dose curcumin also did not enhance treatment efficacy. 
This study also provides confirmation of the enhanced potency of curcumin in people with 
atypical depression compared to other depressed counterparts. However, this requires further 
validation using more strongly-powered studies.
