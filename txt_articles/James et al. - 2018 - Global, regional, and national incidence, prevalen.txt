Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and 
years lived with disability for 354 diseases and injuries for 
195 countries and territories, 1990–2017: a systematic 
analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017
GBD 2017 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators*
Summary
Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) includes a 
comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 
195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates 
from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the 
non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world’s 
population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, 
ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving 
analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data.
Methods We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated 
and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit 
records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates 
using a total of 68 781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, 
Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan 
(province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of 
estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each 
condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of 
each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), 
a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we 
calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies 
with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting.
Findings Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache 
disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the 
greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent 
tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron 
deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and 
depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates 
decreased by 3·9% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1–4·6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased 
by 7·2% (6·0–8·4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421–723) to 853 million (642–1100). 
The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7·9% (6·6–9·2) for males and 
6·5% (5·4–7·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised 
prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 
included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95% UI 2782–3252] per 100 000 in males vs 1400 [1279–1524] per 
100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082–3583] vs 2336 [2154–2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal 
violence (3265 [2943–3630] vs 5643 [5057–6302]).
Interpretation Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly 
three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing 
numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive 
since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies 
across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global 
improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially 
expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.

Introduction
Measuring non-fatal health loss is one of the most 
complex endeavours in population health research. 
The evolution of modern health-care systems has led 
to an increasing number of diseases and injuries 
being diagnosed and treated in individual patients, 
and developments such as antihypertensive and statin 
medications, percutaneous coronary intervention, and 
antiretroviral therapies have led to averted deaths and 
longer lives. In parallel with the increasing complexity of 
clinical medicine in the past century, measuring non-
fatal health loss has necessitated continuous refinement 
as diagnostic classification systems expand, new diseases 
emerge, and metrics of disability improve. Across the 
global landscape, increased non-fatal health loss para-
doxically reflects both success in terms of diminishing 
rates of premature death but also failure in terms of 
maintaining health care for diseased and injured 
individuals. It is increasingly evident that differential 
access to care, economic inequality, and imbalanced risk 
factor profiles can and do challenge the ability of health 
systems to achieve equitable health outcomes in the face 
of complex and resource-draining diseases and injuries. 
Addressing such lapses in health equity can pose a 
burden to under-resourced health care systems and 
economies.
Global progress in improving the burden of non-fatal 
health outcomes has been limited, in part by a 
predominant focus on mortality rates as a common 
metric of tracking global health progress.1–3 In the latter 
part of the 20th century, the global community focused 
on communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV,

Research in context
Evidence before this study
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 
study is a comprehensive study of health loss designed to 
capture complex patterns of disease and injury burden; for 
non-fatal health outcomes, these are measured in terms of 
incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs). 
Previous versions of the study have increased the estimation 
detail for conditions, locations, ages, and years. This study is a 
reassessment of the incidence, prevalence, and YLDs of diseases 
and injuries from 1990 to 2017 and updates results from 
previous GBD studies. There are no alternative measurements 
of non-fatal health loss that include the level of detail provided 
in the GBD study.
Added value of this study
This study adds new knowledge on non-fatal burden globally 
and improves upon previous iterations of the GBD study in the 
following ways. We expanded our database of non-fatal health 
outcomes by adding 2842 collaborator-provided data sources 
and incorporating new clinical data representing an additional 
149 million admissions and 3·7 billion outpatient visits for use in 
GBD modelling. This resulted in a total of 68 781 sources being 
used in the estimation process for GBD 2017. We improved 
estimation methods including updating the calculation of the 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI), adding the ability to report the 
statistical differences in non-fatal health outcomes for males and 
females, using internally consistent GBD estimates of population 
and fertility, and adopting several cause-specific modelling 
improvements. Cause-specific improvements included the 
following; for diarrhoea, we added additional literature 
informing aetiological attribution; for HIV/AIDS, we updated 
absolute neutrophil count bias adjustments, antiretroviral 
therapy coverage data, and sex-specific survey estimates. For 
hepatitis, we added case fatality rates and hepatitis B vaccine 
coverage to viral hepatitis incidence models. For maternal, 
neonatal, and child health causes, we added in-facility delivery 
rates to the inpatient admission per-capita estimates to more 
accurately measure the denominator for incident cases and 
expanded the age range affected by protein-energy malnutrition. 
For cancer, we applied mortality-incidence ratios directly to 
cause-specific mortality rates to estimate incidence, and then 
calculated prevalence on the basis of incidence and survival 
estimates. For mental and substance abuse disorders, 
we adopted new covariates for opioid use and updated autism 
spectrum disorder designations to be consistent with the most 
recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 
We also added 19 new causes to our cause hierarchy, including 
type 1 and type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease due 
to type 1 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease due to 
type 2 diabetes; cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH); liver cancer due to NASH; invasive non-typhoidal 
salmonella; myelodysplastic, myeloproliferative, and other 
haemopoietic neoplasms; subarachnoid haemorrhage; 
non-rheumatic valvular heart disease including calcific aortic and 
degenerative mitral subtypes; aggregates of vision disorders and 
hearing loss; poisoning by carbon monoxide; poisoning by other 
means; and estimates for natures of injury (eg, fractures).
Implications of all the available evidence
Global non-fatal burden is continuing to increase despite minor 
improvements in age-standardised rates. Three causes 
(low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders) 
have prevailed as leading causes of non-fatal health loss for 
nearly three decades, while diabetes has emerged as the fourth 
leading cause of disability globally. The increase in YLDs reflects 
an ageing global population commensurate with declines in 
premature mortality across the development spectrum. 
Globally, patterns of non-fatal health loss vary dynamically by 
sex, age, location, SDI, and cause. The increasing burden of 
non-fatal diseases, injuries, and impairments could pose 
considerable challenges to health systems and economies not 
equipped to care for complex and expensive conditions.

malaria, and other conditions that cause premature 
mortality. In the past decade, it has become evident 
that measuring non-fatal health loss is important for 
tracking progress as the disease burden, in terms of 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), evolves toward 
being dominated by years lived with disability (YLDs). 
Transitions in ageing populations and reduced mortality 
in many areas of the world have created dynamic 
temporal patterns, particularly within the past decade, 
and measuring such time patterns is important because 
advents such as developing a cure for hepatitis C, 
discovering new therapies for cancer, and improving 
treatments for HIV can rapidly transform the burden in 
populations with access to these developments, and as 
conditions such as diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease become increasingly prevalent in lower-income 
countries.4
Estimates reported in recent iterations of the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) have also illustrated differential health outcomes in 
males and females in certain locations and conditions. 
This topic has received attention in terms of mortality 
rates for sex-specific conditions such as maternal causes,5–9 
gynaecological and breast malignancies,10–13 and long-term 
complications of obstructed labour, such as obstetric 
fistula.14–18 GBD 2016 also highlighted how global, age-
standardised, all-cause YLD rates are approximately 
10% higher in females than males, emphasising how 
there may be sex-specific characteristics of the non-fatal 
burden that have not been explored in detail, particularly 
with respect to the differences in sex-specific health 
outcomes.2 It is increasingly of interest to measure 
differences in male and female non-fatal health loss.
This year’s GBD study represents the continued effort 
of quantifying non-fatal health outcomes in terms of 
incidence, prevalence, and YLDs for a list of 354 GBD 
causes for the years 1990–2017
. Because the study is 
remeasured and published on an annual basis, new 
estimates are provided not only for new estimation years 
but also for all previous estimation years and supersede 
any previous results. This year’s study on non-fatal 
burden incorporates improvements in study design, 
estimation strategy, and data availability, and focuses on 
areas of non-fatal burden that are emerging as topical 
issues in measuring and improving health outcomes. We 
also explore the patterns of non-fatal health loss over 
time and estimate the statistical differences in non-fatal 
health loss for males and females.
Methods
Overview
The GBD study provides a standardised approach for 
estimating incidence, prevalence, and YLDs by cause, 
age, sex, year, and location. The study aims to use all 
accessible information on disease occurrence, natural 
history, and severity that passes a set of inclusion criteria. 
Our objective is to maximise the comparability of data, 
despite different collection methods or case definitions; 
to find a consistent set of estimates between data on 
prevalence, incidence, and causes of death; and to predict 
estimates for locations and causes with sparse or absent 
data by borrowing information from other locations and 
covariates.
The study conducts annual updates to incorporate 
new causes and data (including published literature, 
surveillance data, survey data, hospital and clinical data, 
and other types of data) and to improve demographic and 
statistical methods. In this study, we apply different 
methods to utilise available data and to measure specific 
epidemiological patterns of each cause of non-fatal 
burden. Our standard approach uses the Bayesian meta-
regression tool DisMod-MR 2.1. Subsequently, we use 
data for severity and the occurrence of particular con-
sequences of diseases, or sequelae, to establish the 
proportion of prevalent cases experiencing each sequela. 
There are several classes of alternative approaches for 
estimating non-fatal health outcomes, including for 
injuries, cancers, HIV
/AIDS, other infectious diseases, 
and neonatal disorders. Presented below is a high-level 
description of our study methods; the supplementary 
methods (appendix 1 section 4) provide further detail on 
inputs, analytical processes, and outputs and methods 
specific to each cause in GBD 2017
.
Analyses were completed using Python version 2.7, 
Stata version 13.1, or R version 3.3. Statistical code 
used for GBD estimation is publicly available online. All 
rates are expressed as age-standardised based on the 
GBD reference population19 unless otherwise specified. 
This study complies with the Guidelines for Accurate 
and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER)20 
recommendations (appendix 1).
Geographical units, time periods, and demographics
GBD 2017 is based on a geographical hierarchy that 
includes 195 countries and territories grouped into 
21 regions and seven GBD super-regions (appendix 1). 
Each year, GBD includes sub 
national analyses for a few 
new countries and continues to provide subnational 
estimates for countries that were added in previous cycles. 
Subnational estimation in GBD 2017 includes five new 
countries (Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, Russia) 
and countries previously estimated at subnational levels 
(GBD 2013: China, Mexico, and the UK [regional level]; 
GBD 2015: Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, South Africa, 
Sweden, and the USA; GBD 2016: Indonesia and the UK 
[local government authority level]). All analyses are at the 
first level of administrative organisation within each 
country except for New Zealand (by Māori ethnicity), 
Sweden (by Stockholm and non-Stockholm), and the UK 
(by local government authorities). All subnational 
estimates for these countries were incorporated into 
model development and evaluation as part of GBD 2017
. 
To meet data use requirements, in this publication we 
present all subnational estimates excluding those pending

publication (Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Sweden, 
the UK, and the USA); given space constraints these 
results are presented in appendix tables and figures 
instead of in the main text (appendix 2). Subnational 
estimates for countries with populations larger than 
200 million people (measured using our most recent 
year of published estimates) that have not yet been 
published elsewhere are presented wherever estimates 
are illustrated with maps but are not included in data 
tables. Cause-specific results for non-fatal estimates for 
GBD 2017 cover the years 1990–2017
. A subset of areas in 
this analysis focuses on 1990, 2007, and 2017 to show 
changes over time to better inform policy assessments.
GBD 2017 is the first time that estimation of fertility 
and population has been done within the GBD frame-
work. Previously, the GBD study used external 
sources21,22 for fertility and population estimates, which 
affect estimates throughout the GBD study, particularly 
estimates expressed in terms of population rates. The 
purpose of using internally derived demographic 
estimates is to ensure internal consistency across all 
GBD estimates. That is, mortality rates and fertility 
rates have to match population rate change such that 
there should be no births, deaths, or migrations that are 
not accounted for in our population estimates.
GBD cause list
In GBD 2017, we further refined the existing cause list, 
and added 19 new causes, increasing the number of 
estimated causes in GBD to 359 with 282 causes of death 
estimated and 354 causes of non-fatal health loss 
estimated. In the GBD study, causes and their sequelae 
are organised into hierarchical levels. Level 1 contains 
three broad cause groups: communicable, maternal, 
neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNN); non-
communicable diseases (NCDs); and injuries. For non-
fatal health estimates, there are 22 Level 2 causes, 
167 Level 3 causes, and 288 Level 4 causes. We also report 
estimates for 3484 sequelae, nine impairments, and 
seven nature of injury aggregates.
New for GBD 2017
In GBD 2017, we report on 381 Level 5 sequelae. We have 
opted to include aggregate sequelae for GBD 2017 to 
foster more nuanced interpretations of groups of health 
outcomes that are relevant to policy makers and clinical 
users of the GBD. In addition, this reporting list allows 
for more detailed evaluation of aetiologies and outcomes 
from GBD causes.
For the first time in the GBD study, we present the 
burden of injuries in terms of nature of injury as well as 
external cause of injury. Previously, we reported the 
incidence, prevalence, and YLDs of injuries expressed 
only in terms of what caused the injury—eg, those 
caused by falls. However, the burden that results from 
falls is experienced in terms of the bodily harm that the 
fall itself causes—eg, spinal injury or skeletal fracture. 
We have grouped the 47 nature of injury sequelae into 
seven combined categories that represent 1410 sequelae. 
The supplementary methods (appendix 1) includes the 
full GBD 2017 non-fatal reporting hierarchy from 
Level 1 to Level 6.
Data sources
The process for non-fatal estimation begins with the 
compilation of data sources from a diverse set of possible 
sources, which include 21 possible Global Health Data 
Exchange (GHDx) data types ranging from scientific 
literature to survey data to epidemiological surveillance 
data. Our collaborator network provided 2842 data 
sources for GBD 2017
. We analysed 21 100 sources of 
epidemiological surveillance data (country-years of 
disease reporting) for GBD 2017 and 4734 sources of 
disease registry data. For non-fatal estimation, we did 
systematic data and literature searches for 82 non-fatal 
causes and one impairment, which were updated to 
Feb 11, 2018. Search terms used for cause-specific 
systematic reviews, inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
preferred and alternative case definitions, and study 
methods detailed by cause are available in the 
supplementary methods (appendix 1 section 4). This 
search process contributed to the use of 15 449 scientific 
literature sources and 3126 survey sources used in 
non-fatal estimation, reflecting our updated counting 
criteria for GBD 2017
. Household survey data archived 
in the GHDx were systematically screened together 
with sources suggested by country-level experts, surveys 
located in multinational survey data catalogues, and 
Ministry of Health and Central Statistical Office websites. 
Primary data sources containing disease prevalence, 
incidence, mortality risk, duration, remission, or severity 
were then combined in the estimation process. The 
supplementary methods section provides further details 
on gold standard data sources, adjustments, correction 
factors, and standardisations employed when incorpo-
rating these different types of non-fatal data (appendix 1 
section 4).
In addition to data sources based on primary literature, 
surveys, and surveillance, the GBD study has used an 
increasing number of hospital discharge records, out-
patient visit records, and health insurance claims to 
inform various steps of the non-fatal modelling process. 
This year, we received hospital discharge records for an 
additional 30 country-years, specifically discharge records 
from India (3 country-years), Iran (10), Japan (6), Jordan 
(1), Nepal (1), Brazil (2), China (1), and Italy (6); inpatient 
and outpatient claims from Taiwan (province of China); 
additional years of inpatient and outpatient claims 
from the USA; and inpatient claims from Singapore, 
representing an additional 148 842 107 hospital admis-
sions globally and bringing the total number of 
admissions that inform GBD estimation to more than 
2·6 billion. Additionally, we received 10 years of out-
patient visit records from Norway, representing a total of

153 351 282 outpatient visits over a 10-year period. Overall, 
the study now uses hospital data from 335 country-years, 
outpatient visit data from 45 country-years, and health 
insurance claims data from 33 country-years between 
the USA, Taiwan (province of China), and Singapore. 
These data inform multiple cause models in various 
ways, mainly by providing incidence and prevalence 
estimates adjusted for read 
mission, non-primary diag-
nosis, outpatient utilisation, or a combination of the 
above, but also by estimating parameters such as case 
fatality rates, remission rates, procedure rates, and 
distribution of disease subtypes. The supplementary 
methods provide a more detailed description of how the 
clinical data adjustments are calculated and how 
admission and outpatient visit data are processed and 
utilised (appendix 1 section 2).
In the supplementary methods (appendix 1), we show 
the geographical coverage of non-fatal data, both 
incidence and prevalence, for GBD 2017
. In addition, we 
illustrate the non-fatal data density and availability for 
GBD 2017 from 1990 to 2017 by GBD region and year for 
each of the three Level 1 GBD cause groups. The GHDx 
provides the metadata for all sources used for non-fatal 
estimation.
Non-fatal disease models
For GBD 2017, we modelled non-fatal disease burden 
using DisMod-MR 2.1, a meta-analysis tool that uses 
a compartmental model structure with a series of 
differential equations that synthesise sparse and hetero-
geneous epidemiological data for non-fatal disease and 
injury outcomes. Estimation occurred at the five levels of 
the GBD location hierarchy—global, super-regional, 
regional, national, and subnational—with results of each 
higher level providing guidance for the analysis at the 
lower geographical level. Important modelling strategy 
changes from GBD 2016 to GBD 2017 for specific causes, 
as well as further details on these causes and their 
respective models, can be found in the supplementary 
methods (appendix 1 section 4).
Custom models were created if DisMod-MR 2.1 did not 
capture the complexity of the disease or if incidence and 
prevalence needed to be calculated from other data, or 
both. Further details of these custom models can be 
found in the cause-specific methods sections of the 
supplementary methods (appendix 1 section 4).
Prevalence was estimated for nine impairments, 
defined as sequelae of multiple causes for which better 
data were available to estimate the overall occurrence 
than for each underlying cause: anaemia, intellec-
tual disability, epilepsy, hearing loss, vision loss, heart 
failure, infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, and 
Guillain-Barré syndrome. Different methodological app-
roaches were used for each impairment estimation 
process; these details are described in the supplementary 
methods (appendix 1 section 4).
Severity distributions and disability weights
Severity splits apply a set of proportions that represent the 
distribution of cases of a given non-fatal cause by its 
underlying severities. Severity splits are typically cate-
gorised as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe. This

distinction is important for conditions such as asthma that 
have a broad spectrum of symptomatic severities. Severity 
splits for most conditions use the Medical Expenditure 
Panel Survey (MEPS) data or literature sources identified 
through systematic reviews. Further detail on the severity 
splits for each cause, including changes from GBD 2016, 
are available in the cause-specific modelling write-ups in 
the supplementary methods (appendix 1 section 4).
Disability weight estimation is described in more detail 
elsewhere in the literature,23 but in summary, these 
represent the severity of health loss associated with a 
single given health state. The supplementary methods 
(appendix 1) provide a complete listing of the lay 
descriptions of all 234 health states used in the estimation 
of non-fatal results for GBD 2017
.
Comorbidity
A combined disability weight is required to account for 
individuals with more than one condition. To calculate a 
combined disability weight, the health loss associated 
with two disability weights are multiplied together and 
then a weighted average of each constituent disability 
weight is calculated. The adjusted disability weight is 
proportional to the magnitude of the original disability 
weight. A simulation of 40 000 distinct individuals is 
done that calculates the distribution of comorbid con-
ditions on the basis of the expected distribution of 
each condition’s sequelae in the population. Then, the 
resulting distributions of comorbidity-adjusted disability 
weights are used to calculate YLDs. This process did not 
change from GBD 2016.
YLD computation
YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence 
estimate and a disability weight for health states of each 
mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity as 
described above. The GBD cause hierarchy also includes 
35 residual disease categories to capture YLDs from 
conditions that lack specific estimation models.
Uncertainty analysis
We apply the same technique for propagating uncertainty 
as used elsewhere in the GBD study design.19,24,25 The 
distribution of every step in the computation process is 
stored in 1000 draws that are used for every other step 
in the process. The distributions are determined from 
the sampling error of data inputs, the uncertainty of 
the model coefficients, and the uncertainty of severity 
distributions and disability weights. Final estimates are 
computed using the mean estimate across 1000 draws, 
and the 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) are determined 
on the basis of the 25th and 975th ranked values across 
all 1000 draws.
The Socio-demographic Index
The Socio-demographic Index (SDI) is a summary 
measure that estimates a location’s position on a spectrum 
of development.26 The SDI was originally con 
structed for 
GBD 2015 using the Human Development Index (HDI) 
methodology, wherein a 0–1 index value was determined 
for each of the original three covariate inputs (total 
fertility rate in women aged 15–49 years, educational 
attainment over the age of 15 years, and lag-distributed 
income per capita) using the observed minima and 
maxima over the estimation period to set the scales. In 
response to feedback from collaborators, we have refined 
the indicator with each GBD cycle. For GBD 2017, we 
replaced the total fertility rate with the total fertility rate in 
women under the age of 25 years. The GBD 2017 
Population and Fertility24 analysis of age-specific fertility 
rates revealed that through the process of development, 
many countries exhibited a decline in age-specific fertility 
rates over the age of 30 years and then increased, creating 
a U-shaped pattern; however, age-specific fertility rates in 
ages 10–14 years, 15–19 years, 20–24 years, and total 
fertility under 25 years did not exhibit this pattern. Total 
fertility under 25 years remains highly correlated with 
mortality measures including under-5 mortality rates 
(Pearson’s correlation coefficient r=0·873), and results 
from this revised method for computing SDI and results 
from GBD 2016 are also correlated (r=0·992).24 We 
computed the composite SDI as the geometric mean of 
the three indices for each location-year. The cutoff values 
used to determine quintiles for analysis were then 
computed using country-level estimates of SDI for 2017, 
excluding countries with populations of less than 
1 million. These quintiles are used to categorise and 
present GBD 2017 results on the basis of sociodemographic 
status. The SDI values ranged from a low of 0·191 in 
Niger to a high of 0·918 in Denmark in 2017
. Additional 
details on and results from the SDI calculation are 
available in the supplementary methods (appendix 1 
section 2).

highlights how injuries data are generally less available 
than for the other two cause groups.
Table 1 reports cause-specific global estimates of 
prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for causes at Levels 1–5 
of the GBD hierarchy for 2017, as well as the percentage 
change in YLDs and age-standardised YLD rates between 
1990, 2007, and 2017
. Unless otherwise specified, all rates 
reported in this analysis are age standardised.
Prevalence
For all ages and both sexes combined, globally, in 2017, 
the three most common causes at Level 3 of the GBD 
cause hierarchy in terms of all-age prevalent cases were 
oral disorders (3·47 billion, 95% UI 3·27–3·68), headache 
disorders (3·07 billion, 2·90–3·27), and tuberculosis 
including latent tuberculosis infection (1·93 billion, 
1·71–2·20; table 1).
Global age-standardised prevalence rankings remained 
unchanged for the top two Level 3 causes in the GBD 
hierarchy from 1990 to 2017, with oral disorders and 
headache disorders remaining the two most common 
causes. Tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infec-
tion was the third leading cause in 1990 and became the 
fourth leading cause in 2017, whereas haemoglobin-
opathies were the fourth leading cause in 1990 and 
became the third leading cause in 2017
. Between 1990 
and 2017, the age-standardised prevalence decreased for 
oral disorders by 5·5% (95% UI 4·9 to 6·0) but increased 
for headache disorders by 0·3% (−0·2 to 0·9) and for 
haemoglobinopathies by 4·7% (4·3 to 5·1).
Incidence
Globally, in 2017, for all ages and both sexes combined, the 
three leading Level 3 causes in terms of incident cases 
were upper respiratory infections (17·1 billion, 95% UI 
15·3 to 19·2), diarrhoeal diseases (6·29 billion, 
5·81 to 6·82), and oral disorders (3·60 billion, 3·23 to 3·99; 
table 1). These case rankings remained unchanged for the 
top three causes between 1990 and 2017 despite a decrease 
in age-standardised incidence rates of upper respiratory 
infections of 2·6% (95% UI 2·0 to 3·1), from 232 815 new 
cases (95% UI 207 461 to 260 397) to 226 802 new cases 
(201 716 to 253 367) per 100 000, and in age-standardised 
incident rates of oral disorders of 0·3% (−1·1 to 0·6), from 
48 423 new cases (43 233 to 53 971) to 48 276 new cases 
(43 109 to 53 919) per 100 000, and an increase in the 
number of new cases per 100 000 of diar 
rhoeal diseases of 
11·7% (8·8 to 14·6), from 75 087 new cases (69 475 to 81 367) 
to 83 846 new cases (77 402 to 90 965) per 100 000.
YLDs
The global number of YLDs increased from 562 million 
(95% UI 421–723) to 853 million (642–1097) between 
1990 and 2017, representing a 51·8% (50·2–53·5) increase 
and a 7·2% (6·0–8·4) increase in the all-age YLD rate, 
while age-standardised YLD rates decreased from 
11 310 YLDs (8485–14 506) to 10 871 YLDs (8171–13 980) per 
100 000, representing a 3·9% (3·1–4·6) decrease. CMNN 
causes accounted for 13·8% (12·5–15·1) of total YLDs in 
2017, while NCDs accounted for 79·5% (77·8–81·1) and 
injuries for 6·7% (6·2–7·3), with a total of 118 million 
(86·7–154) YLDs for CMNN causes, 678 million (510–876) 
for NCDs, and 57·2 million (42·1–75·4) for injuries. The 
number of YLDs from CMNN causes increased from 
1990 to 2017 by 13·6% (9·15–19·2), and the YLD rates 
from CMNN causes decreased by 14·8% (10·7–18·0) 
from 1846 YLDs (1343–2472) to 1573 YLDs (1159–2067) per 
100 000 during the same period. The number of YLDs 
from NCD causes increased between 1990 and 2017 by 
61·1% (60·0–62·4), and the YLD rate from these causes 
decreased by 1·2% (0·66–1·8) from 8684 YLDs 
(6540–11 223) to 8579 YLDs (6454–11 084) per 100 000. The 
number of YLDs from injuries increased between 1990 
and 2017 by 52·7% (49·3–56·4), and the YLD rate from 
injuries decreased by 7·8% (6·27–9·28) from 779 
(577–1023) YLDs to 719 YLDs (529–948) per 100 000. In 
2017, the YLD rate for all causes ranged from 9120 YLDs 
(6877–11 622) per 100 000 in Columbia to 14 824 YLDs 
(11 080–19 203) per 100 000 in Yemen.
Globally, in 1990, for all ages and both sexes, the 
leading Level 3 causes of YLDs were low back pain 
(42·5 million YLDs, 95% UI 30·2 to 57·2), headache 
disorders (35·1 million, 22·8 to 49·7), and dietary iron 
deficiency (31·7 million, 21·6 to 45·5). Between 1990 and 
2007, the number of all-age YLDs attributed to low 
back pain increased by 30·0% (27·9 to 31·9) and 
those attributed to headache disorders increased 
by 34·0% (33·0 to 35·1), while the number of all-age 
YLDs for dietary iron deficiency decreased by 0·2% 
(−2·8 to 2·2). Between 1990 and 2007, the number of all-
age YLDs attributed to depressive disorders increased by 
33·4% (31·0 to 35·8), becoming the third leading cause 
of all-age YLDs in 2007, and shifting dietary iron 
deficiency to fourth; the rankings for low back pain and 
headache disorders did not change from 1990 to 2007
. 
From 2007 to 2017, we observed further increases in the 
number of all-age YLDs attributable to the leading three 
causes: low back pain (17·5%, 95% UI 16·2–19·0), 
headache disorders (15·4%, 14·6–16·2), and depressive 
disorders (14·3%, 13·1–15·6).
Figure 2 illustrates the leading Level 3 causes of YLD 
rates by GBD country and select subnational locations in 
2017 for both sexes combined. The geographical variation 
in the leading Level 3 causes of YLD rates across 
countries is shown: low back pain was the leading cause 
in 126 of the 195 countries and territories whereas 
diabetes was the leading cause of YLD rates in Mexico, 
Equatorial Guinea, Congo (Brazzaville), Myanmar, 
Mauritius, and Gabon, as well as parts of the Caribbean 
and most of Oceania. Dietary iron deficiency was the 
leading cause of YLD rates in Yemen, India, Antigua and 
Barbuda, and in parts of western sub-Saharan Africa. 
Conflict and terrorism was the leading cause of YLDs in 
Afghanistan, Eritrea, Rwanda, and Burundi.

The most common Level 3 causes of YLD rates by 
country and subnational locations by sex are shown in 
appendix 2. In both females and males, low back pain 
was the leading Level 3 cause by country. In females, 
the second most commonly leading Level 3 cause 
was headache disorders, which was the leading cause in 
57 countries, followed by diabetes, which was the leading 
cause in 20 countries. In males, the second most 
commonly leading Level 3 cause was diabetes, highest in 
39 countries, followed by drug use disorders and conflict 
and terror, each leading in five countries.
Temporal YLD trends in causes and impairments by 
geographical regions and SDI quintiles
Figure 3 shows rankings and trends of the top causes of 
YLDs by SDI quintile and by sex. SDI-based patterns 
varied by sex: the top cause of YLD rates between 1990 
and 2017 in the lowest SDI quintile was dietary iron 
deficiency for females and low back pain for males, 
whereas in the highest SDI quintile it was low back pain 
for both females and males. In the lowest SDI quintile, 
for both sexes combined, the top three causes of YLD 
rates were low back pain, dietary iron deficiency, and 
headache disorders, while in the highest SDI quintile 
the top three causes were low back pain, headache 
disorders, and depressive disorders (appendix 2). The 
sup 
plementary results show these results for the leading 
six impairments estimated in GBD: anaemia, heart 
failure, vision loss, hearing loss, epilepsy, and infertility 
(appendix 2). The immense burden of anaemia is shown, 
particularly for females in low-SDI regions. The 
differences in the burden of impairments by sex are also 
provided (appendix 2).
Figure 4 shows the all-age and age-standardised YLD 
rates by SDI and GBD region between 1990 and 2017 for 
males and females combined for all causes and then 
separately for Level 1 causes. In general, many regions 
experienced decreases in all-cause age-standardised

YLD rates as SDI increased (figure 4). However, there 
were important exceptions to this finding. First, some 
regions did not follow this trend consistently. Southern 
sub-Saharan Africa showed an increase in YLD rates for 
more than a decade before beginning a more precipitous 
decline coinciding with the apex of the HIV epidemic, 
whereas regions with a higher baseline SDI have generally 
experienced minimal changes or increases in age-
standardised YLD rates over the past decade despite 
advances in SDI. We found that trends also varied over 
time depending on cause. As SDI increased, age-
standardised and all-age YLDs improved for CMNN 
causes in most regions, but this relation was less reliable 
for NCDs. The NCD pattern also differed markedly 
between all-age and age-standardised rates for NCDs, with 
all-age rates increasing as SDI improved with relatively 
little change over time observed in age-standardised rates. 
For injuries, some regions initially experienced a declining 
burden as SDI increased, followed by an increasing 
burden as SDI continued to increase over time, as seen in 
Central Europe, for example.
Age-specific and sex-specific patterns in prevalence 
and YLDs
Table 2 shows global age-standardised prevalence for 
females and males for all Level 2 GBD causes as well as 
the relative difference between the sexes in 1990 and 2017
. 
In both 1990 and 2017, the cause with the greatest relative 
difference between sexes was substance use disorders, 
which had a relative difference of 1·09 (95% UI 1·03–1·15) 
in 1990, which increased to 1·16 (1·09–1·23) in 2017
. In 
1990, 302 million (226–388) YLDs were in females and 
260 million (195–336) were in males. The all-age YLD rate 
for females was 11 273·6 (8455·6–14 492·5) per 100 000 and 
the all-age YLD for males was 9571·4 (7160·9–12 356·1) per 
100 000 in 1990. Among the global sum of YLDs, 53·6% 
(53·3–53·9) or 457 million (344–587) YLDs were in 
females and 46·4% (46·1–46·7) or 396 million (297–510) 
YLDs were in males. In the subset of causes that occur in 
both males and females, there were 761 million (565–987) 
total YLDs, with 53·0% (52·8–53·2) or 444 million 
(334–571) YLDs in females and 47·0% (46·8–47·2) or 
395 million (296–510) YLDs in males. Between 1990 and 
2017, all-age YLD rates increased for females and males,

Figure 5A illustrates the differences in global prevalence 
for females and males for 2017 by age group for the 
22 Level 2 GBD causes of non-fatal health loss, calculated 
as the female-specific estimate subtracted from the male-
specific estimate such that causes on the left side of the 
chart are more prevalent in females while causes on the 
right side of the chart are more prevalent in males in a 
given age group. Females experience overall higher 
prevalence in every age group and the highest age-specific 
global prevalence differences for female-predominant 
causes occur between the ages of 20 years and 49 years. 
From birth to 4 years of age, females have higher prevalence 
of other NCDs, which continues through all age groups, 
and of neoplasms than males, whereas neurological 
disorders are female predominant in all ages, becoming 
notably evident from age 5–9 years and continuing 
through 
 
out all subsequent age groups. Similarly, 
HIV
/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections are female 
predominant in all ages, a trend that becomes evident 
from age 10–14 years. Although nutritional deficiencies are 
more prevalent in males in the earliest age groups up to 
age 9 years, they are more prevalent in females in sub-
sequent age groups up to age 74 years, at which point they 
once again become more prevalent in males up to the 
oldest age group. Females also have higher prevalence of 
self-harm and interpersonal violence starting from age 
1–4 years and continuing until age 84 years, after which 
they become more prevalent in males. Digestive diseases 
are more prevalent in males in all age groups, whereas 
unintentional injuries emerge as a male-predominant 
cause from 5 years of age and remain as such until age 
89 years, after which they become female predominant. 
Transport injuries are male predominant in all age groups 
starting from age 1–4 years. Respiratory infections and 
tuberculosis are male pre 
dominant in all ages. Cardio-
vascular diseases are male predominant starting from age 
50–54 years, whereas chronic respiratory diseases emerge 
as a male-predominant cause from age 65–69 years.
Figure 5B shows the sex differences in the global 
burden of YLDs for 2017 by age group for the 
22 Level 2 GBD causes of non-fatal health loss. Before 
age 10–14 years, males have greater YLD rates than 
females, driven largely by higher rates of nutritional 
deficiencies. From age 10–14 years and older, females 
have greater overall YLD rates in every age group. Under 
the age of 1 year, females experience higher YLD rates 
due to neoplasms and maternal and neonatal disorders, 
whereas male infants experience higher YLD rates due to 
nutritional deficiencies and other NCDs. Starting at age 
10 years, females experience a higher YLD rate due to 
other NCDs (until age 50–54 years), musculoskeletal 
disorders, mental disorders, neurological disorders, and 
chronic respiratory diseases. Males experience higher 
YLD rates due to unintentional injuries, transport 
injuries, and substance use disorders for most of life, 
although females older than 80 years of age experience a 
higher rate of unintentional injuries than do males. For 
self-harm and interpersonal violence, females experience 
higher rates than males until age 30–34 years, at which 
point males experience higher YLD rates. Males also 
experience higher YLD rates from neoplasms, cardio-
vascular diseases, and other NCDs starting in older age 
groups (≥60 years), and from digestive diseases from age 
25–29 years.
Figure 6 shows the extent to which males and females 
in region–cause combinations have diverged in terms of 
achieving equal change over time between 1990 and 2017
. 
Each region–cause combination shows which sex has 
performed better over time either by decreasing more or 
by increasing less in terms of age-standardised YLD rates. 
Among the 462 region–cause combinations (excluding 
any “Global” or “All causes” combinations), females had 
more favourable outcomes over time for 260 combinations 
(56·3%), and males had more favourable outcomes for 
202 combinations (43·7%). The Z score, that is, the 
number of SDs from equality, was 0·433 for the mean 
deviation of female-favourable causes and 0·313 for the 
mean deviation of male-favourable causes.
Figure 7 shows the leading 20 causes of prevalence 
and YLDs for females and males separately for 1990, 
2007, and 2017, with percentage change. In 1990, the 
most common causes for females were oral dis-
orders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies 
and haemolytic anaemias, whereas for males, the most 
common causes were oral disorders, headache disorders, 
and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis. The 
number of prevalent cases in the top three leading causes 
for females increased by 23·1% (95% UI 21·8 to 24·5) for 
oral disorders, 31·5% (30·2 to 32·8) for headache 
disorders, and 29·9% (29·6 to 30·1) for haemo 
globino-
pathies and haemolytic anaemias between 1990 and 2007
. 
Between 2007 and 2017, the number of cases increased 
further by 13·5% (12·9 to 14·1), 14·5% (13·8 to 15·3), and 
13·4% (13·2 to 13·6), respectively (figure 7A). Between 
1990 and 2007, for males, the number of prevalent cases 
of oral disorders increased by 21·6% (20·1 to 23·1), 
the number of headache disorders increased by 31·3% 
(29·9 to 32·8), and the number of prevalent cases 
of tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection 
increased by 26·2% (21·7 to 30·3). Between 2007 and 
Figure 4: Co-evolution of all-age and age-standardised YLD rates with SDI 
globally and for GBD regions for Level 1 causes for both sexes combined, 
1990–2017
Coloured lines are global and region values for YLDs. Each point in a line 
represents 1 year, starting from 1990 and ending in 2017. In all regions, SDI has 
increased over time so progress in SDI is associated with points further to the 
right and later years for a given region, with a downwards gradient indicating a 
reduction in YLD rate. The black lines indicate the trajectories for each geography 
expected on the basis of SDI alone. SDI=Socio-demographic Index. 
YLDs=years lived with disability.

2017, the number of prevalent cases for these three causes 
increased by 12·5% (11·9 to 13·1), 14·3% (13·6 to 15·2), 
and 1·1% (−0·67 to 3·01), respectively (figure 7B). The 
age-standardised prevalence of the top cause for females, 
oral disorders, decreased by 3·8% (3·3 to 4·3) between 
1990 and 2007, and decreased by 1·3% (1·0 to 1·7) 
between 2007 and 2017

causes for females, the age-standardised prevalence 
decreased by 0·4% (−1·0 to 0·3) for head 
ache disorders 
and increased by 4·2% (4·0 to 4·4) for haemo

for males decreased by 4·3% (3·8 to 4·9) for oral 
disorders, increased by less than 0·1% (−0·85 to 0·85) 
for headache disorders, and decreased by 3·1% (0·8 to 5·4) 
for tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection. 
Between 2007 and 2017, the age-standardised prevalence 
for males for oral disorders and tuberculosis further 
decreased by 1·6% (1·2 to 2·0) and 11·5% (10·1 to 12·8), 
respectively, whereas the age-standardised prevalence 
for headache disorders increased by 0·7% (0·4 to 0·9). 
In 2017, oral disorders, headache disorders, and tubercu-
losis including latent tuberculosis remained the three 
Level 3 causes with greatest global age-standardised 
prevalence for males.
In terms of numbers of YLDs, in 1990, the leading 
causes for both females and males were low back pain, 
headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency (figure 8).

Figure 6: Absolute difference in non-fatal trend equality for males and females in terms of age-standardised YLD rates, 1990–2017
This figure shows whether females or males experienced more favourable trends between 1990 and 2017 in terms of age-standardised YLDs by GBD region and 
Level 2 cause. Circles indicate females experienced more favourable trends and triangles indicate males experienced more favourable trends, where more favourable 
refers to either decreasing more or increasing less. Green indicates that the overall trend is improving (ie, decreasing age-standardised YLDs) and red indicates that the 
overall trend is worsening (ie, increasing age-standardised YLDs). Yellow indicates cause-regions where one sex is increasing and the other sex is decreasing. For 
example, in Andean Latin America for substance use, the large yellow triangle means that males have experienced decreasing age-standardised YLDs whereas the 
trend for females is the opposite (ie, increasing age-standardised YLDs). Different sizes refer to greater deviations from equal trends between 1990 and 2017. For 
example, for chronic respiratory conditions, males have experienced more favourable trends in both Andean Latin America and the Caribbean, with both regions 
having decreasing trends over time for both sexes, but the Caribbean is closer to having equal trends for males and females between 1990 and 2017. GBD=Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. STIs=sexually transmitted infections. NCDs=non-communicable diseases. NTDs=neglected tropical diseases.
YLDs=years lived with disability. *Round brackets indicate excluded endpoints whereas square brackets indicate included endpoints.
Figure 7: Leading 20 Level 3 causes of global prevalence for 1990, 2007, and 
2017, with percentage change in number of cases and all-age and age-
standardised rates for each sex
Causes are connected by lines between time periods; solid lines are increases and 
dashed lines are decreases. For the time periods 1990–2007 and 2007–17, three 
measures of change are shown: percentage change in the number of cases, 
percentage change in the all-age prevalence rate, and percentage change in the 
age-standardised prevalence rate. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and 
nutritional diseases are shown in red; non-communicable causes in blue; and 
injuries in green. Statistically significant changes are shown in bold. COPD=chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease. STIs=sexually transmitted infections.

For both males and females, the top two leading causes 
of global YLDs remained consistent between both time 
periods, during which the total number of YLDs for each 
of these causes increased. The third top cause in 2017 
was depressive disorders for females and diabetes for 
males. From 1990 to 2007, for females, the number of 
YLDs attributable to low back pain increased by 
29·8% (95% UI 27·7–31·8) and headache disorders 
increased by 34·0% (32·8–35·3). From 1990 to 2007, for 
females, the number of YLDs attributable to depressive 
disorders increased by 32·2% (29·8–34·4), causing 
depressive disorders to become the third leading cause in 
2007
. The number of YLDs for the three leading causes 
for females continued to increase from 2007 to 2017, by 
17·3% (15·8–18·8) for low back pain, 15·3% (14·4–16·2) 
for headache disorders, and 14·1% (12·8–15·5) for 
depressive disorders. From 1990 to 2007, for males, the 
number of YLDs attributable to the top two leading 
causes increased by 30·2% (28·1–32·2) for low back pain 
and 34·1% (32·7–35·4) for headache disorders. From 
1990 to 2007, for males, the number of YLDs attributable 
to diabetes increased by 79·0% (75·8–82·2), causing 
diabetes to become the third leading cause. The number 
of YLDs for the three leading causes continued to climb 
from 2007 to 2017, increasing by 17·8% (16·5–19·3) for 
low back pain, 15·5% (14·5–16·5) for headache disorders, 
and 30·1% (24·8–36·1) for diabetes.
Between 1990 and 2007, age-standardised YLD rates 
for females decreased for the three leading causes: low 
back pain (by 7·6%, 95% UI 6·2 to 8·9), headache 
disorders (by 0·1%, −0·80 to 0·69), and dietary iron 
deficiency (by 18·8%, 17·0 to 20·7). Between 1990 and 
2007, the YLD rate for depressive disorders decreased by 
3·0% (1·6 to 4·5) and became the third leading cause of 
YLDs in females in 2007 due to the simultaneous large 
decrease in dietary iron deficiency (figure 8A). Between 
1990 and 2017, YLD rates for females decreased for low 
back pain (by 10·1%, 95% UI 8·8 to 11·3), depressive 
disorders (by 6·0%, 5·0 to 7·1), and dietary iron 
deficiency (by 30·7%, 27·4 to 33·7), while headache 
disorders increased by 0·6% (−0·19 to 1·42). Between 
1990 and 2007, the YLD rates for males decreased for 
low back pain (6·8%, 5·6 to 7·8) and dietary iron 
deficiency (15·1%, 10·9 to 18·9), and increased for 
headache disorders (1·1%, 0·15 to 1·9). Between 1990 
and 2007, the YLD rate for diabetes increased by 21·9% 
(20·0 to 24·0) and became the third leading cause of 
YLDs in males in 2007
. From 2007 to 2017, the YLD rate 
for headache disorders increased by 1·5% (0·8 to 2·3) 
and that for diabetes increased by 4·2% (0·0 to 8·7), 
whereas the YLD rate for low back pain decreased by 
1·3% (0·7 to 1·9). Between 1990 and 2017, the YLD rate 
for low back pain decreased by 8·0% (6·9 to 9·1) and 
that for dietary iron deficiency decreased by 26·7% 
(20·6 to 32·5), whereas the rates for headache disorders 
and diabetes increased by 2·6% (1·6–3·6) and 27·0% 
(22·2–32·4), respectively.
Discussion
Main findings
While age-standardised all-cause global YLD rates 
decreased by less than 4% over the nearly three-decade 
period from 1990 to 2017, the number of total YLDs has 
increased by more than 50% during this time. This 
pattern is concerning given the lack of substantial 
improvement in age-standardised rates over time as well 
as the increased magnitude of total health loss. These 
patterns are probably related to population growth and 
ageing as well as increasing numbers of YLDs from 
conditions such as type 2 diabetes and opioid use 
disorders, which were less common in 1990. YLD 
increases, even when age-standardised rates are slightly 
improving, might pose a burden to economies and 
health-care systems that have not expanded proportionally 
to population growth or in populations where economic 
improvements have not been equitably distributed.
Globally, over the 28-year period studied, three chronic 
NCDs (low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive 
disorders) have prevailed as three of the top four leading 
causes of YLDs, collectively causing 162 million (95% UI 
118–216) YLDs in 2017 and representing nearly one in 
five YLDs globally. This substantial portion of global 
YLDs might be amenable to treatment and care access, 
because headache disorders and depressive disorders 
can be treated with low-cost therapeutics. The persistence 
of depressive disorders and low back pain is also 
concerning given the former’s relation with self-harm 
and the latter’s relation with potential loss of functional 
status in the work force.
Emerging trends
For the first time in the GBD study, we estimated the 
burdens of type 1 and type 2 diabetes separately. Our 
estimates illustrate the emergence of diabetes as a leading 
cause of disability globally, ranking as the fourth leading 
cause of age-standardised YLDs in 2017
. This increased 
burden was observed across all levels of development. 
Age-standardised YLDs increased for both females and 
males across all SDI quintiles between 1990 and 2017 
(figure 3). Diabetes poses complicated care challenges 
even in areas with reliable access to medical services. 
Preventive measures such as pre 
diabetes screening, 
lifestyle modification, and treatment with low-cost 
medications such as metformin could avert worsening 
incidence rates, but as prevalence increases, health-care 
systems will also need to provide access to services such as 
wound care, surgical resources, medications including 
insulin, care for diabetic retino 
pathy, and increased focus 
on heightened cardiovascular disease risk.
This is also the first year of GBD estimation for non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cirrhosis and 
liver cancer caused by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH). For cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by NASH, 
we estimated 892 million (95% UI 859–928) global 
cases for cirrhosis due to NASH and 97 400 cases 
 Global Health Metrics
1838

(86 800–108 000) for liver cancer due to NASH, and an 
age-standardised prevalence of 11 061 cases (10 651–11 493) 
per 100 000 for cirrhosis due to NASH and 1·20 cases 
(1·07–1·33) per 100 000 for liver cancer due to NASH in 
2017 (appendix 2), identifying NASH as an increasingly 
important cause of liver disease. We observed that these 
cases were distributed across all GBD regions, although 
more commonly in North Africa and the Middle East 
and in Oceania in terms of age-standardised rates. 
This expansion of NAFLD and liver disease due to 
NASH reflects the worsening burden of metabolic 
conditions globally. Given the complexity of chronic liver 
disease and the difficulty of effectively treating obesity, 
efforts to prevent obesity and to develop therapeutics for 
NAFLD will be increasingly important.
After initial steep reductions in HIV incidence between 
1998 and 2005, the global rate of decline in new HIV 
infections continues, although it has slowed in recent 
years and global prevalence has increased slightly since 
2010, a trend which is probably driven by rapid expansion 
of antiretroviral therapy in high-prevalence countries and 
extended life expectancy of people living with HIV. These 
longer lifespans call for increased resources for treatment 
and continued prevention and treatment interventions to 
maintain declines in incidence.27 For tuberculosis, it is a 
notable success that drug-susceptible tuberculosis has 
declined in terms of age-standardised incidence since 
1990. The burden of malaria has also declined since the 
mid-2000s in terms of age-standardised incidence rates. 
High age-standardised incidence rates of acute viral 
hepatitis have persisted, however, with age-standardised 
incidence rates of hepatitis A and B combined exceeding 
malaria incidence in 2017 despite availability of vaccines. 
The age-standardised incidence rate of acute hepatitis 
did not significantly change from 1990 to 2007, from 2007 
to 2017, or from 1990 to 2017, suggesting that more 
proactive global initiatives are important, particularly 
with respect to vaccine coverage28 and cost-effective 
access to hepatitis C curative treatments.29–31
Incidence rates of lower respiratory infections (LRIs) 
declined among children younger than 5 years by 
32·4% (95% UI 27·2–37·5) since 1990 and caused 
83·0 million (66·4–101) episodes in children younger 
than 5 years in 2017, while the age-standardised incidence 
rate decreased by 5·8% (1·5–10·0) between 1990 and 
2017 (appendix 1). Among all ages, pneumococcal 
pneumonia has prevailed as the leading aetiological 
subtype of LRI, accounting for more than five times 
more YLDs than the second leading cause (influenza). 
Diarrhoeal episodes have persisted as the second most 
common incident cause of health loss after upper 
respiratory infection among all ages, with 6·29 billion 
(5·81–6·82) total episodes in 2017, with rotavirus pre-
vailing as the leading aetiology. The age-standardised 
incidence of diarrhoea varied nine-fold across GBD 
regions, with the lowest rates in Australasia and the 
highest rates in Oceania (appendix 2). The burdens 
of pneumococcal pneumonia and rotavirus diarrhoea 
are notable given the availability of vaccines for these 
pathogens, highlighting the need for continued expan-
sion of vaccine coverage and delivery systems.
While the burden of musculoskeletal disorders, vision 
loss, and hearing loss in older ages has been a consistent 
theme in past GBD studies due to their substantial 
contribution to non-fatal health loss, the burden of 
medically complex, high-resource conditions has also 
become increasingly concerning. Cardiovascular disease, 
chronic respiratory conditions, and neurological disorders 
sum to form more than 15% of age-standardised YLDs in 
every GBD region except two (southern Latin America 
and eastern sub-Saharan Africa; appendix 2). GBD risk 
factor estimates show that the drivers for atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular diseases—high systolic blood pressure,32–34 
high cholesterol, poor diet,35 high fasting plasma glucose,35 
and low physical activity36—prevail in many geographies, 
indicating that this burden can be expected to persist and 
possibly expand as populations age. While the efforts of 
primary prevention approaches such as statin therapy and 
smoking cessation are evident in the gradual declines in 
age-standardised prevalence in high-income countries 
over the past 28 years, the prevalence of cardiovascular 
disease in these popu 
lations still remains high, which 
might also reflect improved survival from acute events 
due to improved response systems and interventions such 
as percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery 
bypass grafting, and rapid stroke treatment guidelines,37–40 
as well as secondary prevention with statins, anti-
hypertensives, and smoking cessation.41–46 As developing 
economies increas 
ingly experience cardio 
vascular disease 
burden, investing in health system infrastructure to 
ensure access to these interventions as well as to primary 
prevention therapeutics could help to mitigate disability 
and improve survival into older ages.40,47,48 Chronic 
respiratory conditions also inflict considerable health loss 
in older people, contributing to more than 5% of YLDs 
starting in the 50–54 year age group, globally, who were 
exposed to risk factors such as smoking and indoor air 
pollution and similarly pose challenges to health systems 
with ageing populations, given the importance of oxygen 
therapy,49–52 access to medical care,53–55 and the risk of 
respiratory infections among these patient populations.56,57 
Neurological con 
ditions continue to show large numbers 
of prevalent cases and YLDs, with consistent increases in 
recent years. We anticipate that this burden will also 
expand as populations age, creating challenges for health-
care systems given the lack of modifiable risk factors for 
some neurological conditions and effective treatments 
for conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. Given the 
extensive care requirements these conditions—in iso-
lation or as comorbidities—demand from both health 
systems and social and familial supports, their morbidity 
can reflect not only diminished health for an individual 
and population but also lost capital in an economy and 
among caretakers.58–63

Opioid use disorders including opioid dependence 
have become an era-defining epidemic in the USA with 
more than 4 million prevalent cases in 2017
. Outside the 
USA, opioid dependence was estimated to cause more 
than 1% of age-standardised YLDs in 135 countries in 
2017, whereas in 12 out of 21 GBD regions, more than 
5% of YLDs in the 15–49 year age group were caused by 
substance use disorders overall (appendix 2). Cumu-
latively, these results show pervasive health loss from 
substance use, which might also cause lost human 
capital given the concentration of the burden in working 
ages. The burden of mental disorders is present in 
both sexes and across all age groups after emerging 
in childhood with idiopathic intellectual disability 
and autism spectrum disorders and continuing into 
older ages with depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, 
and schizo 
phrenia. Mental disorders have consistently 
formed more than 14% of age-standardised YLDs 
for nearly three decades, and have greater than 
10% prevalence in all 21 GBD regions. These findings 
substantiate a global need for increased mental health 
and substance abuse treatment re 
sources, improved 
judiciousness of opioid prescribing patterns particu-
larly for chronic pain, and expanded harm-reduction 
strategies such as opioid substitution therapy and 
needle programmes.
Cross-cutting themes
Among the 22 causes in the Level 2 GBD cause hierarchy, 
14 causes had a relative difference between males and 
females greater than or equal to 10% in terms of prevalent 
cases in 2017, while 12 causes had a relative difference 
greater than 10% in terms of age-standardised prevalence. 
Notably, females had significantly higher prevalence of 
HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (driven 
primarily by higher burden from sexually transmitted 
infections) and self-harm and interpersonal violence, 
among other causes, whereas males had significantly 
higher prevalence of substance use disorders and trans-
port injuries, among other causes. Figure 6 illustrates 
how divergent trends were nearly evenly distributed 
between males and females, despite the overall higher 
numbers of YLDs experienced by females. As indicated 
by the higher Z score in female-favourable causes, the 
cause-regions where females did better over time tended 
to have greater improvements in age-standardised YLD 
rates than did the cause-regions where males did better 
over time. There were important exceptions, however: 
for example, with HIV/AIDS and sexually trans 
mitted 
infections in central sub-Saharan Africa, the age-
standardised YLD rates for females increased by 30·0% 
(95% UI 6·8–68·1), while rates for males decreased 
by 43·0% (23·2–58·5) between 1990 and 2017
. This 
particular trend reveals a striking lapse in health equity 
given the extensive knowledge of treatment and 
prevention methods for HIV
/AIDS and many sexually 
transmitted infections.
These observations imply that health systems might 
have achieved improvements in non-fatal burden that 
have not been shared across sexes. The underlying 
reasons for these imbalances are likely to be complex. 
For causes that are inherently more common in males 
or females, improvements in one sex over the other 
might reflect these causes differing in susceptibility to 
prevention, intervention, and treatment. For example, 
autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis 
can affect both males and females but are ordinarily 
more common in females.64,65 However, such a cause still 
leads to increased disability that might also have 
ramifications not captured in a health study, such as 
income loss due either to disability at young ages or to 
the cost of modern immunotherapies. Similarly, females 
of childbearing age experience risk of pregnancy-related 
and maternal conditions, risks that could be pronounced 
in lower-resource settings without sufficient access to 
modern obstetric facilities and follow-up care.66,67 Other 
causes have firmly established causal risk factors such as 
smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), where the higher COPD rates in males are 
probably due to historically higher rates of smoking 
compared with females. Additionally, some causes 
may be susceptible to systematic misdiagnosis due to 
conventional clinical heuristics based on flawed or non-
existent evidence. For example, in some areas, females 
presenting with acute coronary syndrome are more 
commonly misdiagnosed,68 whereas other causes, such 
as autism spectrum disorders, might be systematically 
underdiagnosed in females compared with males.69–71 
These biases in sex-specific misdiagnosis emphasise the 
need for continued refinement in sex-specific burden 
estimation.
While YLD rates are highest in older ages, globally, 
YLD counts are heavily concentrated in working-age 
males and females (ie, from 20–54 years), a pattern which 
is particularly evident among causes such as mental 
disorders, neurological disorders, and musculoskeletal 
disorders, which sum to more than 45% of all YLDs in 
these age groups. This finding is notable for two main 
reasons. First, these age groups have a considerable 
number of years to live that would otherwise be in full 
health, emphasising how conditions at these ages, even 
if having lower disability weights, can still contribute 
substantially to the non-fatal burden. Second, a disabling 
condition that occurs during this period of life could 
represent lost human capital. This loss will be 
increasingly important to characterise with human 
capital emerging as an important area of focus at the 
World Bank.72,73
In GBD 2017, anaemia is classified as an impairment, 
with aetiologies ranging from rare genetic haemo 
globino-
pathies to iron deficiency. Because these aetiologies 
alone could cause a relatively small proportion of all 
anaemia cases, the magnitude of anaemia’s burden 
would be obscured by the granularity of these aetiologies 
 Global Health Metrics
1840

if it was not also estimated in aggregate. In 2017, the sum 
of YLDs across all causes of anaemia was 58·2 million 
(95% UI 39·5–83·0), with a global age-standardised rate 
of 783·9 YLDs (531·3–1117·8) per 100 000 for both sexes, 
with sex-specific rates of 1012·8 YLDs (689·4–1436·5) per 
100 000 females, and 555·9 YLDs (370·4–801·8) per 
100 000 males. Globally, in terms of YLD rates in 2017, 
anaemia is the leading impairment for females, males, 
and both sexes combined. If anaemia were treated as a 
cause, it would rank as the fourth leading Level 2 cause 
and as the first leading Level 3 cause in terms of age-
standardised YLD rates globally for females in 2017
. The 
third leading impairment for males, females, and both 
sexes combined was blindness and vision impairment 
(1·34 billion [1·29–1·39] cases in 2017), which is notable 
given the economic consequences of vision loss,74,75 the 
relative treatability of many vision loss conditions, and 
the increased risk of injury that stems from visual 
impairment.76,77 Summed together, the impairments 
included in the GBD cause hierarchy comprise a total of 
more than 5 billion prevalent cases worldwide in 2017, 
making it evident that health-care systems and policy 
makers should evaluate non-fatal burden not only for 
diseases and injuries but also for impairments and their 
aetiologies.
Important changes in GBD 2017 compared with 
GBD 2016
Overview
Overall, the most important systemic change to this year’s 
study is the estimation of population and fertility in the 
GBD framework. In addition, we made changes to the 
GBD cause hierarchy (for example adding an aggregate 
Level 3 headache disorders cause), which limits certain 
cause-specific comparisons with past GBD cycles; this is 
discussed in more detail in the Limitations section below. 
Other notable cause-specific considerations, comparisons, 
and limitations that are new as of GBD 2017 are as 
follows. More details for each cause can be found in the 
supplementary methods (appendix 1 section 4).
Cause-specific considerations, comparisons, and limitations
In GBD 2017, we added the Malnutrition and Enteric 
Disease (MAL-ED) study to our existing use of the Global 
Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS)78–80 to measure diar-
rhoeal aetiologies, which affected our aetiological 
distributions with increased norovirus and rotavirus 
attributions. Our overall diarrhoea incidence estimates 
were not affected. The Walker and colleagues’ study81 
estimated 1·7 billion episodes of diarrhoea among 
children younger than 5 years in 2010, a value that is 
greater than the GBD 2017 estimate in the same year 
(1·16 billion, 95% UI 1·00–1·34). For pneumonia, a study 
by Rudan and colleagues82 estimated a global pneumonia 
incidence of 0·22 episodes (IQR 0·11–0·51) per child-
year among children younger than 5 years in 2010, 
accounting for 122·6 million episodes, a value that is 
greater than the GBD 2017 estimate of 94·5 million 
(79·5–112). These two studies are part of the Maternal 
and Child Epidemiology Estimation (MCEE). The MCEE 
methodology for diarrhoea and pneumonia incidence 
differs from GBD in that MCEE uses only community-
based studies. By contrast, the GBD uses a greater 
volume of data including Demographic and Health 
Surveys, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, and clinical 
data records. We also used diarrhoea-specific and LRI-
specific summary exposure values as covariates in our 
models, which include location-specific and year-specific 
estimates of risk factors associated with diarrhoea or LRI. 
We observed that these covariates had significant 
relationships with diarrhoea and LRI incidence rates and 
therefore strengthened our estimates, particularly in 
data-sparse areas. Further modelling details are described 
in the supplementary methods (appendix 1 section 4).
For HIV
/AIDS, we used new methods to adjust for 
representativeness bias in ANC surveillance data,83 which 
led to our models predicting a lower peak and flatter 
trend of the epidemic in southern sub-Saharan Africa 
compared with GBD 2016. We updated our inputs of 
antiretroviral therapy coverage distribution informed by 
data from the International Epidemiology Databases to 
Evaluate AIDS and CD4+ progression parameters for 
children.84,85 We also improved our sex-specific modelling 
strategy in Spectrum by sex-splitting incidence based on 
a model fit to the sex ratio of prevalence observed in 
countries with representative surveys. Our estimated 
global prevalence results are similar to UNAIDS 2017 
values, with some variation at the national level. 
Estimates in recent years are expected to be less stable 
due to improvements in HIV treatment coverage and 
prevention. Further modelling details are described in 
the supplementary methods (appendix 1 section 4).
The hepatitis estimation process has changed to 
improve internal consistency between mortality and non-
fatal estimates for GBD 2017
. First, we included case-
fatality rates from clinical data in our mortality models to 
improve the distribution of hepatitis deaths by virus. 
Second, we developed a time series of hepatitis B 
virus vaccine coverage in infants to use as a covariate. 
Third, the aggregate cause-specific mortality rate of acute 
hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer due to hepatitis B 
and hepatitis C was combined with virus-specific sero-
prevalence data to ensure internal consistency among 
incidence, prevalence, remission, and excess mortality 
rates. Fourth, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B and C 
are now captured in the cirrhosis and other chronic liver 
diseases cause group rather than in the prevalence 
estimates for acute hepatitis B and acute hepatitis C. 
Overall, this caused prevalent cases of hepatitis B and C to 
be shifted from the acute hepatitis B and C causes to 
the cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases cause. 
Specifically, in terms of global age-standardised prevalence 
rates for both sexes in 2016, acute hepatitis B decreased 
from 6295 cases (95% UI 5349–7436) per 100 000 in GBD 
 Global Health Metrics
www.thelancet.com   Vol 392   November 10, 2018 
1841
2016 to 219 cases (193–248) per 100 000 in GBD 2017, while 
its corres 
ponding chronic cause, cirrhosis and other 
chronic liver diseases due to hepatitis B, increased from 
170 cases (159–184) to 5625 cases (5159–6118) per 100 000. 
Similarly, acute hepatitis C decreased from 2152 cases 
(1927–2382) per 100 000 in GBD 2016 to 8·11 cases 
(7·37–8·98) per 100 000, while its corresponding chronic 
cause, cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases due to 
hepatitis C, increased from 149 cases (136–164) to 
1723 cases (1517–1969) per 100 000 (appendix 2).
Maternal, neonatal, and child health
Several changes were adopted for GBD 2017
. Adding 
clinical and claims records from outside the USA to 
our models affected congenital birth defects, haemo-
globinopathies, and maternal disorders. Updating our 
inpatient admission per-capita estimates to include in-
facility deliveries as a newborn admission affected neonatal 
disorders and congenital birth defects. Adopting in-facility 
delivery estimates for processing clinical data for maternal 
disorders led to lower estimates of pregnancy compli-
cations, especially in high-utilisation settings. We refined 
our method for estimating age-specific preterm birth and 
its complications to be consistent with GBD risk factor 
analysis, which resulted in preterm birth prevalence being 
higher than in previous GBD estimates. We enforced 
internal consistency among our estimates such that, for 
example, the sum of all specific types of congenital heart 
disease must equal the total number of cases of congenital 
heart disease. These methodological changes have lowered 
global estimates for many of the specific causes of birth 
defects, enforced the internal consistency of mortality and 
non-fatal estimates, narrowed the unexplained geo-
graphical variation in disease incidence, and strengthened 
the empirical re 
lationship with known environmental, 
nutritional, and behavioural deter 
minants of these con-
ditions. For nutri 
tional deficiencies, we extended our 
analysis of protein-energy malnutrition past age 5 years, 
incorporated cause-specific mortality rates, and included 
the prevalent cases of moderate wasting without oedema. 
Although the net result might seem to be an increase in 
the number of protein-energy malnutrition cases, it 
instead reflects a more comprehensive assessment of 
acute malnutrition than was estimated previously.
Diabetes
Diabetes has been estimated in previous GBD studies, 
but this is the first year that type 1 and type 2 diabetes 
were estimated and reported separately. The estimation 
strategy for diabetes is provided in more detail in the 
supplementary methods (appendix 1 section 4), but in 
summary, we measured overall diabetes and type 1 
diabetes. We subtracted estimates of type 1 from overall 
diabetes to produce estimates for type 2 diabetes. One of 
the main limitations to measuring type 2 diabetes is that 
surveys of diabetes in adults do not make a distinction 
between cases of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
NASH and NAFLD
In GBD 2017, for the first time we estimated NASH as a 
cause of liver cancer and cirrhosis and NAFLD as an 
asymptomatic health state. Our global age-standardised 
prevalence estimate of NAFLD and NASH that leads 
to cirrhosis or liver cancer was 10 935 cases (95% UI 
10 522–11 365) per 100 000 in 2017, which was lower than 
a study by Younossi and colleagues,86 which estimated a 
global prevalence of 24%. This difference is due to how 
we adjust for alcohol use in the population, which helps 
to distinguish these conditions from alcohol-driven liver 
disease. Our study shows a similar geographical pattern 
to the Younossi study, with higher rates in North America 
and the Middle East, corresponding to higher rates 
of obesity.
Cardiovascular diseases
We split haemorrhagic stroke into subarachnoid 
haemor 
rhage and intracerebral haemorrhage as sub-
types of stroke and added non-rheumatic valve disease 
as an additional cause and aetiology of heart failure. The 
overarching limitation in cardiovascular estimation is 
that low-income and middle-income locations are less 
likely to have diagnostic tests such as treadmill tests, 
ankle-brachial index measurement, and other modern 
diagnostics. This also limits the identification of 
preclinical atherosclerotic disease for individuals who 
have not had clinical events but who might have 
ischaemic changes with provocative cardiac testing. For 
stroke, there were few sources of incidence data in 
many low-income and middle-income countries, and 
many clinical records used the ICD code for “acute, 
unspecified stroke”, which does not differentiate 
between ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, 
and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Future incorporation 
of more clinical record data might help to address these 
limitations by providing more diagnostic detail for 
cause subtypes.
Chronic respiratory diseases
We added several data sources that had lower estimates 
than the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in 
Childhood studies, which were the main source of 
asthma prevalence previously. Additionally, the adjust-
ment factor for studies reporting on physician-diagnosed 
asthma without an additional question on wheezing 
changed between GBD 2016 and GBD 2017 after new 
data sources were added.
Neurological conditions
For dementia, we added covariates for whether studies 
had common features present in their diagnostic protocol, 
such as a review of clinical records or a diagnosis by a 
clinician to try to correct for some of the heterogeneity 
between studies, because only a very small fraction of 
studies used the same methods. We do not have reliable 
covariates for prevalence or incidence of dementia and 
 Global Health Metrics
1842 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 392   November 10, 2018
other neurological disorders, although in future studies, 
estimates of neurological disorders will benefit from the 
increased use of clinical and claims records.
Cancer
For GBD 2017, we added the new cause “myelodysplastic, 
myeloproliferative, and other haemopoietic neoplasms”, 
which were previously estimated as part of the “other 
neoplasms” group. In addition, we added new causes 
for three categories of benign and in-situ neoplasms: 
intestinal, cervical and uterine, and other.
Mental and substance use disorders
We estimated burden for a combined group of autism 
spectrum disorders consistent with the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 designations in 
GBD 2017 as opposed to separately estimating autism 
and Asperger’s syndrome and other autism disorders.87 
Modelling improvements were made for opioid use 
disorders by incorporating new country-level covariates, 
including a measure of opioid analgesic consumption by 
country and the prevalence of injection drug use. 
Enhancements in the fatal modelling of opioid use 
disorders also contributed to these improved estimates. 
Improvements were also made in terms of data additions, 
particularly for cocaine and amphetamine dependence, 
where new data showed greater subnational variation in 
Mexico and Brazil.
Injuries
For GBD 2017, improvements were made to the com-
putational framework required for injuries non-fatal 
measurement. These updates included incorporating 
GBD 2017 age groups and updating the differential 
equation solver for converting incidence to prevalence. 
Poisoning was divided into the two subcauses of 
poisoning by carbon monoxide and poisoning by other 
agents. Our estimate of 172 million (95% UI 152–194) 
falls per year resulting in any short-term or long-
term disability was higher than those of WHO, which 
estimated 37 million falls88 that required medical 
attention per year—a difference that might be explained 
by GBD’s inclusion of a wide spectrum of injury 
severities including minor injuries that result from falls. 
The WHO and GBD estimates on road injuries were 
more similar, with WHO estimating 20–50 million 
people experiencing non-fatal road injuries per year89 and 
GBD 2017 estimating 54·2 million (47·4–61·6) road 
injuries in 2017
. For fires, WHO and GBD 2017 had 
similar estimates when comparisons were available—for 
example, in the USA, WHO reported 410 000 burn 
injuries90 in 2008 and GBD 2017 reported 360 000 
(313 000–380 000) fire, heat, and hot substance injuries.
Limitations
As is evidenced in figure 1 and the supplementary 
methods, there is considerable heterogeneity in terms of 
data density for each Level 1 location-cause combination 
in the GBD study. Data availability does not consistently 
correlate with burden—that is, high-burden causes and 
locations can have relatively sparse data for non-fatal 
outcomes. This will also be increasingly problematic 
as more countries start to experience greater burden 
from NCDs.
Currently, we inform most of the severity distributions 
that affect YLD calculation using the Medical Expenditure 
Panel Survey from the USA. This poses a limitation as 
the severities experienced in this population probably do 
not reflect global severity distributions or reflect that 
severity distributions are likely to vary over time, location, 
age, and by treatment access. As such, YLDs estimated 
might not reflect improvements in disability over time as 
SDI increases. Even for the limited diseases such as 
COPD, epilepsy, and stroke for which data from epi-
demiological studies allow us to differentiate severity by 
age, time, and location, the underlying data sources are 
still extremely limited in coverage by age, time, and 
location. Relying on published data on severity is unlikely 
to provide improved estimates in the near future. We also 
plan to access linked data between administrative records 
with diagnostic information and health surveys using 
health status measures to quantify severity of disease and 
how this changes over time and by age and sex.
Comorbidity adjustment in GBD 2017 assumes inde-
pendent distributions of comorbid conditions. This is a 
limitation because comorbidity distributions are known 
to vary by cause, age, sex, location, and time. For example, 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease are more likely to be 
comorbid than asthma and gynaecological disorders but 
currently our comorbidity adjustment does not capture 
these correlations.
Clinical data records have known selection bias for 
subsets of the population that have access to health care. 
Some GBD causes rely heavily on clinical data given the 
lack of other sources, with efforts made to correct for this 
bias by using representative studies as a reference group. 
In recent years, the GBD study has used USA claims 
records to inform hospital data adjustments and various 
other elements of GBD estimation. Relying on data from 
a privately insured cohort in a high-income country 
poses limitations to the generalisability of these adjust-
ments. This year, we also used tabulated claims records 
from Taiwan (province of China) for the first time in the 
GBD study, and in future publications we plan to 
continue incorporating claims data from additional 
countries to address this limitation. Acquiring further 
health insurance claims data will not only inform 
estimates in terms of incidence and prevalence measures 
but will also help to develop more accurate parameters 
that affect GBD estimates in other modelling steps.
With regard to age-time patterns, in DisMod-MR 2.1, 
we start by estimating a global model that uses all the 
available data and covariates with hierarchical random 
effects for geographies to estimate a prior distribution 
 Global Health Metrics

1843
that is passed down the geographical cascade. Time 
trends in our estimates result from where the covariates 
are changing over time, when year is included as a 
covariate or when data in different time periods lead 
to variation in the posterior estimates. This frame-
work, however, does not capture true cohort effects. 
For example, we do not directly take into consideration 
prevalence in 30-year-olds in 1990 when estimating 
prevalence in 50-year-olds in 2010. This is a limitation for 
some diseases with known cohort effects such as the 
high incidence of hepatitis C in the USA in younger 
adults in the 1970s. We are continuing to develop a 
version of DisMod that explicitly incorporates a full age-
time-period model in a Bayesian framework that will 
help to address this issue.
While our cause list currently specifies 354 diseases 
and injuries, there is great interest in incorporating a 
greater level of detail. Going forward, we intend to 
become more granular in our cause list, but every new 
disease requires a substantial amount of new reviews 
and model building. In consultation with our Scientific 
Council, we will need to balance our available resources 
with this growing list of priorities for new additions.
Similar to the cause reporting list, the hierarchy of the 
cause list and the method by which conditions are 
classified and grouped is a complex component of the 
GBD framework that has undergone nearly continuous 
improvement and refinement in years past. Grouping 
GBD causes into broad cause groups is a necessary part 
of the study’s estimation and reporting process, but it 
can also cause limitations and challenges in the absence 
of broad consensus on objective frameworks for 
organising cause hierarchies. Other studies that measure 
burden of disease exemplify how disease groupings can 
affect a study’s implications and interpretation. A recent 
study91 cited medical errors as the third leading cause 
of death in the USA but grouped all heart disease and 
all cancer as the first and second leading causes, 
respectively. A different aggregation or level of detail in 
terms of the disease grouping in such a study could 
change these rankings, which become important in the 
realm of health policy and resource allocation as well as 
popular and political perception of what causes death 
and disability in a population. In the GBD study, we have 
strived to retain as much detail as is methodologically 
possible given available data, and additionally we have 
incorporated input from the GBD collaborator network 
in terms of refining our cause hierarchy to represent a 
heterogeneous mix of medical specialties, research 
expertise, and location-specific knowledge. In addition, 
our framework allows us to revise the cause hierarchy 
for specific specialties such as the burden of neurological 
disorders.92
Future directions
The methods and data that inform YLD estimation in the 
GBD study will continue to evolve. Several specific 
improvements have been suggested by the GBD collab-
orator network and the global research community, and 
the following future directions are planned to be 
incorporated in the coming cycles.
Because the GBD cycle continues to be published on 
an annual basis, it will be important to incorporate 
updated data sources for older estimation years but also 
to add sources for the most recent estimation year. This 
necessitates data inclusion immediately after the end of 
the calendar year in order to be incorporated for the 
following year’s estimation. This is challenging because 
some surveys, surveillance systems, and literature 
studies have a lag period between data collection and 
publication. One solution to this challenge would be 
adding, updating, and incorporating clinical data records 
from inpatient and outpatient visits from hospitals 
and clinics from more locations. Clinical data provide a 
level of detail, demographic information, and diagnostic 
accuracy that enhances the GBD study’s ability to 
produce accurate estimates in the more recent estimation 
years. Relying more heavily on clinical data will require 
improved methods for adjusting for known repre-
sentativeness biases. In the future, we plan to link 
medical records to representative survey results, which is 
possible with certain claims databases such as the 
Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey in the USA.93
In the next iteration of the GBD study, we plan to 
incorporate improved age-time estimation using a new 
tool, DisMod-AT, that simultaneously quantifies the 
relationships over time, by age, and by age cohorts. 
DisMod-AT will address the age-time measurement 
limitation described above.
We plan to continue updating and refining our cause 
and location hierarchies including the causes described 
above. This is the first year that estimates for a non-geo-
graphical subnational grouping (ie, Māori and non-Māori 
populations in New Zealand) were modelled, and in 
future GBD studies it would be compelling to similarly 
estimate disease burden in groups within a location not 
strictly determined by geographies—for example, race 
groups within the USA or refugee populations in host 
countries.
Conclusion
The global burden of non-fatal health loss in 2017 
represents a complex culmination of nearly three decades 
of evolving disease patterns and risk factor profiles, 
improving health care, and dynamic populations. This 
study provides comprehensive updates from prior GBD 
studies and identifies topical themes that can be used to 
guide future research and discussion in the arena of non-
fatal health loss. Continuing a trend from throughout 
the history of the GBD study, we show how YLDs 
continue to increase as countries improve along the 
develop 
ment spectrum and emphasise how economies 
should anticipate difficulties in caring for older popu-
lations suffering from complex conditions such as

diabetes, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and 
neuro 
logical conditions. Additionally, we report hetero-
geneity in outcomes experienced across different sexes, 
geo 
graphies, and income levels, and identify regions and 
causes where sexes have had divergent health trends over 
time. These findings should help to focus prevention 
and treatment efforts on groups and areas that have 
experienced inequitable health outcomes. Continuing 
the theme of health equity, we highlight the extensive 
amount of health loss experienced globally for conditions 
that are treatable or preventable such as viral hepatitis, 
emphasising the profound impact that health-care 
systems can produce with increasing investment in and 
access to health-care resources. Finally, we emphasise 
the burden of non-fatal health loss in younger and 
middle ages, where it is speculated that non-fatal health 
loss could ultimately lead to loss in human capital.
