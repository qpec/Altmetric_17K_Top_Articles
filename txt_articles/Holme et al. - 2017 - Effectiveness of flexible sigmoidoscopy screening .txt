ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To compare the effectiveness of flexible 
sigmoidoscopy in screening for colorectal cancer by 
patient sex and age.
Design
Pooled analysis of randomised trials (the US Prostate, 
Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial 
(PLCO), the Italian Screening for Colon and Rectum trial 
(SCORE), and the Norwegian Colorectal Cancer 
Prevention trial (NORCCAP)).
Data sOurCes
Aggregated data were pooled from each randomised 
trial on incidence of colorectal cancer and mortality 
stratified by sex, age at screening, and colon subsite 
(distal v proximal).
eligibility Criteria fOr seleCting stuDies
Invited individuals aged 55-74 (PLCO), 55-64 (SCORE), 
and 50-64 (NORCCAP). Individuals were randomised to 
receive flexible sigmoidoscopy screening once only 
(SCORE and NORCCAP) or twice (PLCO), or receive 
usual care (no intervention).
results
287 928 individuals were included in the pooled 
analysis; 115 139 randomised to screening and 172 789 
to usual care. Compliance rates were 58%, 63%, and 
87% in SCORE, NORCCAP, and PLCO, respectively. 
Median follow-up was 10.5 to 12.1 years. Screening 
reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer in men 
(relative risk 0.76; 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 
0.83) and women (0.83; 0.75 to 0.92). No difference in 
the effect of screening was seen between men younger 
than 60 and those older than 60. Screening reduced 
the incidence of colorectal cancer in women younger 
than 60 (relative risk 0.71; 95% confidence interval 
0.59 to 0.84), but not significantly in those aged 60 or 
older (0.90; 0.80 to 1.02). Colorectal cancer mortality 
was significantly reduced in both younger and older 
men, and in women younger than 60. Screening 
reduced colorectal cancer incidence to a similar extent 
in the distal colon in men and women, but there was 
no effect of screening in the proximal colon in older 
women with a significant interaction between sex and 
age group (P=0.04).
COnClusiOn
Flexible sigmoidoscopy is an effective tool for 
colorectal cancer screening in men and younger 
women. The benefit is smaller and not statistically 
significant for women aged over 60; alternative 
screening methods that more effectively detect 
proximal tumours should be considered for these 
women.
Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the third most frequently occurring 
cancer worldwide,1  and screening has been imple-
mented in many countries. In four large scale ran-
domised trials, flexible sigmoidoscopy screening has 
been shown to reduce both incidence and mortality 
from colorectal cancer,2-5  and one meta-analysis has 
shown consistent effects across the trials, with similar 
length of follow-up.6  Flexible sigmoidoscopy visualises 
only the distal part of colon. To partly overcome this 
limitation, individuals with pathological findings in the 
distal colon are referred for colonoscopy, because they 
might have clinically significant pathology in the prox-
imal colon.7-9
The effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening in 
younger versus older individuals and in women versus 
men is currently unknown. There are reasons to believe 
that the effectiveness might differ in men and women. 
Women have proximal advanced neoplasia without a 
distal adenoma more frequently than men, which could 
trigger referral for colonoscopy.10 11  Furthermore, in 
past decades, there has been a proximal shift in the 
localisation of colorectal cancer that appears more pro-
nounced in women than men, especially among older 
women.12-15 Thus, the effectiveness of flexible sigmoid-
oscopy screening might be small or negligible in older 
women. If this hypothesis is confirmed, screening rec-
ommendations for colorectal cancer might need to be 
reconsidered.
To investigate the impact of sex and age on the effec-
tiveness of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening, we 
launched a collaboration between the investigators of 
three of the four large scale randomised trials.3-5 We 
merged aggregated data and conducted a pooled anal-
ysis of subgroups for sex and age.
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC? 
Flexible sigmoidoscopy screening has been shown to reduce incidence and 
mortality from colorectal cancer in randomised trials
The effectiveness of such screening by age and sex is unknown
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Aggregated data from three large scale randomised trials showed a difference in the 
effect of screening between the sexes; flexible sigmoidoscopy screening reduces 
incidence of colorectal cancer in men, and in women younger than 60
In women aged 60 and over, incidence of colorectal cancer was not reduced by 
screening, possibly because of increased prevalence of cancers in the proximal 
colon in older women
Other screening modalities that more effectively detect proximal tumours should be 
considered in older women

Methods
We examined data from three trials: the US Prostate, 
Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial 
(PLCO), the Italian Screening for COlonREctum trial 
(SCORE), and the NORwegian Colorectal CAncer Pre-
vention trial (NORCCAP).3-5  We invited the investigators 
of a fourth large scale flexible sigmoidoscopy screening 
trial (the UK Flexi Scope trial) to participate, but they 
declined.2 Data from a fifth flexible sigmoidoscopy 
screening trial, the Telemark Polyp Study, were not 
included owing to the trial’s small size (799 enrolled 
individuals). Accordingly, data from 60% of control par-
ticipants and 67% of screening participants of all flexi-
ble sigmoidoscopy screening trials were available for 
analyses.
PlCO
The flexible sigmoidoscopy screening part of the PLCO 
trial included individuals aged 55-744 who were invited 
by post. Individuals were enrolled between 1993 and 
2001 at 10 screening centres in the USA. Exclusion crite-
ria were a history of prostate, lung, ovarian, or colorec-
tal cancer; ongoing treatment for any type of cancer 
except basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer; or a his-
tory of lower endoscopy in the previous three years 
(beginning in 1995). Those who accepted the invitation 
were randomised to flexible sigmoidoscopy at inclusion 
and after three to five years, or to usual care (with no 
organised screening). Compliance with the first screen 
was 83.5%, and 86.6% of participants underwent at 
least one screening examination. A positive screening 
test was defined as any lesion or mass that was detected 
during sigmoidoscopy, and all individuals with a posi-
tive test were referred to their primary care physician for 
further investigation, of which 95.6% included a colo-
noscopy. Colorectal cancer was defined as adenocarci-
noma or carcinoid in the colon or rectum. Cancers were 
ascertained through questionnaires that were mailed 
annually, and all were verified through medical records. 
The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT00002540).
sCOre
The SCORE investigators invited individuals aged 55-64 
in six regions of Italy between 1995 and 1999.5 Exclusion 
criteria were a history of colorectal cancer, adenomas, 
inflammatory bowel disease, having had a lower endos-
copy within the previous two years, two or more first 
degree relatives with colorectal cancer, or a medical 
condition that precluded a possible benefit from screen-
ing. Individuals who accepted the invitation were ran-
domised to once only flexible sigmoidoscopy, or to 
usual care (no screening). Compliance with screening 
was 58.3%. A positive screening test was defined as col-
orectal cancer, any polyp that was greater than 5 mm in 
diameter, three or more adenomas, or any adenoma 
with high grade dysplasia or villous histology. Screened 
patients who tested positive were referred for colonos-
copy at the screening centres. Colorectal cancer was 
defined as adenocarcinoma in the colon or rectum. 
Cases of colorectal cancer were ascertained by periodic 
linking of the trial database to the hospital discharge 
records and databases of the pathology departments. 
Blinded experts from the local cancer registries 
reviewed the candidate colorectal cancer cases. The 
trial is registered at isrctn.gov (ISRCTN27814061).
nOrCCaP
Between 1999 and 2001, individuals aged 50-64 living 
in two areas of Norway were identified through the Pop-
ulation Registry.3 A personal history of colorectal can-
cer was the only exclusion criterion. A random sample 
of people was offered once only flexible sigmoidoscopy 
or the combination of once only flexible sigmoidoscopy 
and once only immunochemical testing for faecal 
occult blood (FlexSure OBT, Beckman-Coulter). The 
remaining population aged 50-64 who lived in the same 
areas served as controls and were not offered screening. 
Compliance with screening was 63%. A positive screen-
ing test (defined as colorectal cancer, any adenoma, a 
polyp with diameter 10 mm or greater, or a positive fae-
cal immunochemical test) qualified for colonoscopy 
referral at the screening centres. Colorectal cancer was 
defined as adenocarcinoma in the colon or rectum. Data 
were extracted by linking the participants’ national 
identity numbers to the nationwide Norwegian Cancer 
Registry. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT00119912).
aggregated analyses
The investigators of the three trials provided aggregated 
data stratified by sex and age (in 5 year age groups), the 
number of individuals at risk, and the number of events 
(colorectal cancer cases and deaths) for each year of fol-
low-up. From the three groups, we collected data on 
compliance with screening, follow-up colonoscopy, 
quality of bowel cleansing, and insertion depth during 
screening. The a priori primary outcome of the present 
study was to determine the incidence of colorectal can-
cer in the distal and proximal colon by sex and age 
group. Mortality due to distal or proximal colorectal 
cancer by sex and age group was the secondary out-
come. We chose this approach to optimise power in the 
analyses (the event ratio of colorectal cancer cases to 
deaths was about 4:1). The distal colon was defined as 
the rectum and sigmoid, while the proximal colon was 
defined as the colon proximal to the sigmoid descend-
ing junction. Patients provided written, informed con-
sent in the context of each trial (only screening 
attenders in NORCCAP). No new consent was obtained 
for the pooled analysis.
statistics
Data were extracted from the databases used in the most 
recent publications. Data from the PLCO trial differed 
somewhat from those previously published,4 owing to 
the withdrawal of consents and updating of the trial 
database. We performed pairwise comparisons (strati-
fied by sex and age group) of flexible sigmoidoscopy 
screening versus no screening using a Mantel-Haenszel 
fixed effects model and report relative risks with 95% 
confidence intervals and forest plots. We applied a

random effects model in a sensitivity analysis, and the 
results were comparable. Heterogeneity (I2) was assessed 
according to recommendations from the Cochrane Col-
laboration: 
0-30%=might 
not 
be 
important, 
30-50%=moderate heterogeneity, 50-75%=substantial 
heterogeneity, 75-100%=considerable heterogeneity.16
We also constructed standardised cumulative risk 
plots using the screening group as the standard. The 
risk per year of follow-up was calculated as the number 
of colorectal cancer cases or deaths during that year 
divided by the mean number of people at risk for the 
same year. In the primary analyses, we included data 
for individuals aged 50-74 and stratified the analyses 
according to sex and age at screening (<60 years v ≥60 
years).
We performed sensitivity analyses of the 55-64 year 
age group only because this was the age range covered 
by all three trials. We also analysed the data after 
extending the definition of distal colon to include the 
descending colon. To explore the impact of compliance 
with screening and the quality of the examination 
(screening flexible sigmoidoscopy and follow-up colo-
noscopy), we included compliance, bowel cleansing, 
and insertion depth at screening, and colonoscopy 
referral rate in univariate random effect metaregression 
models. The caecum intubation rate for colonoscopy 
examinations was not available for all trials.
To assess the heterogeneity between sex and age 
groups, we also included an interaction term between 
sex and age group and performed a multivariate metare-
gression analysis. Using the metareg program17 in Stata, 
we weighted the regression model to include variance 
within the study as well as residual variance between 
trials. Because the stratified data in the metaregression 
model were extracted from the same trials, we included 
indicator variables for the different trials in the regres-
sion model in addition to sex, age group, and the inter-
action term. All analyses were conducted with Stata 
13.0 software (StataCorp) and Review Manager software 
version 5.2 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collabo-
ration). P<0.05 was considered statistically significant 
and all analyses were by intention to treat.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to 
 
disseminate the results of the research to study partici-
pants or the relevant patient community.
Results
Altogether, the three trials comprised 115 139 individu-
als randomised to screening and 172 789 individuals 
randomised to usual care; 144 846 (50.3%) were women 
and 143 082 (49.7%) were men. Median follow-up in the 
three trials was 10.5 to 12.1 years. Trial characteristics 
are displayed in table 1, and procedural characteristics 
in web tables 1 and 2.
incidence of colorectal cancer
A total of 1494 individuals in the screening group were 
diagnosed with colorectal cancer, compared with 2663 
in the control group. This corresponds to a risk reduc-
tion of 21% (relative risk 0.79; 95% confidence interval 
0.74 to 0.84), with no heterogeneity between the trials 
(I2=0%, P=0.67; figs 1-5).
In men, incidence of colorectal cancer in the entire 
colorectum fell by 24% (relative risk 0.76; 95% confi-
dence interval 0.70 to 0.83), with no difference between 
the age groups (table 2 ). In women, colorectal cancer 
incidence was reduced by 17% (0.83; 0.75 to 0.92). This 
effect was confined to the younger women (0.71; 0.59 to 
0.84), while women 60 years and older had a small, 
 
statistically non-significant effect of screening (0.90; 
0.80 to 1.02; table 2).
Our a priori assumption was that the reduced effec-
tiveness of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening in older 
women might be caused by limited effect in the proxi-
mal colon. Accordingly, we performed stratified analy-
ses by subsite.
For colorectal cancer incidence in the distal colon, 
the effectiveness of flexible sigmoidsocopy screening 
was similar in men and women, and in the age group 
younger than 60 compared with the age group of 60 and 
over (table 2 , fig 6).
The incidence of proximal colorectal cancer was sig-
nificantly reduced in men (relative risk 0.83; 95% confi-
dence interval 0.73 to 0.94; fig 4 ), but not in women 
(0.91; 0.79 to 1.03; fig 5; P=0.04 for interaction). In men, 
there was no apparent difference in the effectiveness of 
screening across the age groups (heterogeneity I2=0%; 
fig 4). There was moderate heterogeneity (I2=33%, 
P=0.16) between the studies when the results for all 
women were pooled (fig 5). The heterogeneity disap-
peared completely when data for women younger and 
older than 60 years were pooled separately (I2=0% for

both comparisons). Screening reduced the incidence of 
proximal colorectal cancer by 35% in younger women 
(relative risk 0.65; 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.84), 
while women aged 60 years and older did not benefit 
from screening (1.03; 0.88 to 1.20; table 2 , figs 5 and 6 ). 
This finding was consistent in all three trials (fig 5).
In a sensitivity analysis, we included the descending 
colon in the definition of distal colon, and the results 
were comparable with those presented above: only 160 
(3.8%) of 4157 cases of colorectal cancer were located in 
the descending colon. In a second sensitivity analysis, 
we included procedural characteristics (compliance 
with screening, colonoscopy referral rate, bowel cleans-
ing, and insertion depth of the endoscope at the screen-
ing examination) in univariate metaregression models, 
but none of these procedural characteristics was statis-
tically significant. Thirdly, we included only individuals 
in the age group 55-64 years (the age range covered by 
all three trials, web table 3). Finally, we excluded the 
PLCO trial because of its large size compared with 
SCORE and NORCCAP. The results were comparable 
with the main analysis (web table 4, web figs 1 and 2).
To explore whether the difference in effectiveness of 
screening could be attributable to the distribution of col-
orectal cancer in the distal and proximal colon among 
men and women in different age groups, we used the 
control group (no screening) and calculated the propor-
tion of colorectal cancers in the distal  
(rectosigmoid) 
colon compared with the proximal colon (fig 7). As 
shown, the proportion of distal versus proximal colorec-
tal cancer was smaller for women than for men in all age 
groups. Proximal location of colorectal cancer occurs 
more frequently with increasing age. The distal/proxi-
mal ratio was about one in women aged 55-59, and less 
than one in those age 60 and over, while the same obser-
vation was made for men aged 70 and over.
Colorectal cancer mortality
A total of 373 individuals in the screening group and 740 
in the usual care group died from colorectal cancer. The 
results from the meta-analysis are presented in table 2. 
Overall, colorectal cancer mortality was reduced by 
27% (relative risk 0.73; 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 
0.83), 33% in men (0.67; 95% 0.57 to 0.80), and 18% in 
women (0.82; 0.67 to 1.00, P=0.048).
Screening reduced colorectal cancer mortality in the 
distal colon in men (relative risk 0.51; 95% confidence 
interval 0.40 to 0.65), but not significantly in women 
(0.79; 0.58 to 1.09). There was no effect in either men or 
women on mortality from colorectal cancer due to prox-
imal cancers (table 2). When the analyses were 
restricted to the 55-64 year age group, colorectal cancer 
mortality was statistically significantly reduced in men 
(0.70; 0.57 to 0.86) and in younger women (0.68; 0.47 to 
0.98), but not in women aged 60 years and older (1.07; 
0.77 to 1.48; web table 5).

by sex and age groups. Cooperation between our 
research groups enabled us to include aggregated data 
from almost 300 000 individuals followed for 10 to 12 
years. We found that flexible sigmoidoscopy is an effec-
tive screening tool in men. Incidence of colorectal can-
cer decreased by 24% and mortality by 33%, regardless 
of age at screening. In women, the effect was smaller, 
and confined to women younger than 60 years.
The uniform effectiveness in the distal colon is 
expected, because this part is visualised during the 
screening examination. The effectiveness of screening in 
the proximal colon, however, depends on concomitant 
pathological findings in the distal and proximal colon. 
Several studies have found such an association,8 
9  but 
others report that proximal advanced neoplasia without 
distal lesions are more common in women than in 
men,10 
11 which could explain why flexible sigmoidos-
copy is less effective in women. Our results support this 
suggestion, but we also show that the smaller effect in 
women depends on age at screening.
In women younger than 60, flexible sigmoidoscopy 
screening reduces the incidence of colorectal cancer in 
the proximal colon, and in the sensitivity analyses for 
women aged 55-59 at screening, mortality was also 
reduced. The age difference in women might be due to 
technical issues with the procedures for sigmoidoscopy 
and subsequent colonoscopy (for those women who 
test positive at screening). Studies have identified 
greater difficulties in undertaking colonoscopies in 
women.18 
19  However, we found no large differences in 
performance or compliance (bowel cleansing, endo-
scope insertion depth, adherence to colonoscopy fol-
low-up, caecum intubation rate) in older women 
compared with younger women (web table 1), and pro-
cedural characteristics were not statistically significant 
when they were tested in univariate meta regression 
models. More men than women were referred for colo-
noscopy due to findings at screening, which could 
explain the difference between the sexes in the proxi-
mal colon, but this cannot explain the age difference 
observed in women. This difference might be due to dif-
ferences in the location of colorectal cancers in younger 
versus older women. As shown in figure 7
, distal col-
orectal cancer is more frequent than proximal colorec-
tal cancer in younger women, whereas after the age of 
55-60, proximal colorectal cancer dominates. A similar 
trend is seen in men, but the shift from a higher 
 
proportion of distal to a higher proportion of proximal 
cancers occurs 10 years later than in women.
Comparison with other studies
Reports from several countries have shown similar find-
ings, in addition to a temporal trend towards greater 
incidence of proximal colorectal cancer in recent 
decades, especially in women. 12 
13 
15 
20-23  This is unlikely 
to be the only explanation for the observed difference in 
sex and age, however. The ratio of distal to proximal 
cancers is only marginally different in women between 
the age ranges of 55-59 and 60-64 (fig 7), while there 
seems to be a change in the effectiveness of flexible sig-
moidoscopy screening at around age 60.
In recent years, it has become evident that colorectal 
cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Current screening 
strategies focus on the detection of adenomas, but ade-
nomas—through 
the 
adenoma-carcinoma 
sequence24 
25 —is only one of the precursors to colorectal 
cancer. About 16% of colorectal cancers develop 
through the serrated pathway, with the sessile serrated 
adenoma or polyp (SSA/P) as the precursor lesion.26 
 
These lesions are most often proximal, and in one 
study, 52% of individuals with advanced proximal ser-
rated polyps (defined as SSA/P ≥10 mm with dysplastic 
features, or traditional serrated adenomas) did not have 
a distal lesion that could be detected at flexible sig-
moidoscopy and which would trigger a full colonos-
copy.7 In the same study, distal adenomas were 
associated with proximal adenomas, but not with prox-
imal advanced serrated lesions. Thus, flexible sigmoid-
oscopy could be inadequate in detecting these polyps.

Risk factors for adenomas and serrated polyps might 
differ between men and women and could be important 
when flexible sigmoidoscopy is considered as a screen-
ing tool.27  Being male is a well established risk factor for 
adenomas, but the evidence for sex as a risk factor for 
SSA/P is limited and conflicting.28-30  Some reports have 
found that being female is an independent risk factor for 
SSA/P, but others have not confirmed this finding.27 
31 
 
There is unlikely to be a male predominance for SSA/P, 
however. Advancing age is probably also a risk factor for 
SSA/P, as it is for adenomas.27 
28 Thus, with increasing 
age, proximal SSA/P and proximal adenomas become 
more prevalent. A considerable proportion of these 
proximal polyps might not have a distal lesion that 
could trigger a full colonoscopy. The proportion without 
a distal adenoma might be more pronounced in women 
than men and could explain the difference that we 
observe in women in the present pooled analysis.
The analysis of colorectal cancer mortality is more 
difficult to interpret. The number of deaths are few and 
the confidence intervals wide when the data is stratified 
in subgroups. This could explain why the point esti-
mates for death due to proximal colorectal cancer seem 
discordant with those for proximal colorectal cancer 
incidence. Flexible sigmoidoscopy screening reduces 
the incidence of colorectal cancer and mortality via pol-
ypectomy, which prevents incidence of colorectal can-
cer and results in fewer tumours being at risk for 
causing death due to colorectal cancer. Flexible sig-
moidoscopy also reduces mortality via early detection, 
because screen detected tumours have a more favour-
able prognosis. An interesting finding is illustrated in 
figure 6. Cancers detected through screening are almost 
exclusively located in the distal colon, as evident from 
the starting points of the curves. Possible explanations 
are that the proximal colon is not visualised in most 
screening participants, that distal polyps are poor pre-
dictors of synchronous proximal colorectal cancer, and 
that few proximal colorectal cancers were prevalent at 
the time of sigmoidoscopy screening. Because few prox-
imal cancers were detected early at screening, any 
screening effect in the proximal colon needs to be medi-
ated through prevention, and not by early detection.
strengths and limitations of study
Strengths of this study include the large number of indi-
viduals and consistent results between trials, with no 
heterogeneity in the stratified analyses, but there are 
several limitations. Firstly, the statistical test for hetero-
geneity has limited power to detect differences between 
trials when the number of studies is small.32 Secondly, 
the PLCO trial is larger than the other two trials and 
includes older individuals (>65 years), which could cre-
ate bias. For example, in the screening group, 79% of 
individuals 60 years or older were recruited from the 
PLCO trial, which might limit the generalisability of the 
results. Results from the sensitivity analyses do not sup-
port the existence of such a bias, however. In the analy-
ses restricted to the 55-64 year age group from all three 
trials, and in analyses restricted to SCORE and NORC-
CAP only, the results were comparable with the main 
findings (supplementary material).
Thirdly, even if our findings were consistent across 
the three trials and the numbers are large and of high 
statistical precision, we would appreciate validation in 
independent samples. The only available data source 
for validation is the UK Flexi Scope trial, which would 
have added 50% more individuals to the pooled screen-
ing group and might have affected our results.2  In the 
UK trial, however, proximal colorectal cancer incidence 
rates were almost identical in the group that was 
screened and the group that received usual care, proba-
bly due to the low rate of colonoscopy referrals (5%), 
compared with the three other trials (8.8-21.9%).2-5 
 
Inclusion of the UK trial in the present pooled analysis 
might thus have obscured the difference in sex and age 
with regards to the proximal colon, because few partic-
ipants had visualisation of the proximal large bowel.2 
 
Finally, even if almost 300 000 individuals were 
included in our pooled analysis, there were no statisti-
cally significant differences between men and women 
in any age group, and the results should be interpreted 
with this in mind. However, almost 72 000 women were 
60 years and older, of whom 662 were diagnosed with

proximal colorectal cancer. Not at any point since ran-
domisation was there any difference between the 
screening group and the control group (fig 6).
Conclusion and policy implications
Currently, screening recommendations for colorectal 
cancer are similar for men and women, both with 
respect to screening modality and screening age. Our 
results could serve as a basis for more individualised 
recommendations determined by the age and sex of 
those eligible for screening. The idea of screening rec-
ommendations that are specific to these categories, 
however, raises concerns about acceptability in the 
population and also whether different life expectancy 
between men and women should be taken into account.

Most important is to offer a screening programme that 
indeed reduces colorectal cancer morbidity. According 
to our findings, flexible sigmoidoscopy is a valid screen-
ing option for men and younger women, but is not as 
effective for women aged 60 years and older. Whether 
other screening tools to more effectively detect proximal 
tumours—such as colonoscopy or the faecal occult 
blood test—offer a better alternative for older women is 
currently unknown and warrants further investigation.
