Background: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, and radical prostatectomy (RP) often results in erec-
tile dysfunction (ED) and a substantially reduced quality of life. The efficacy of current interventions, principal treat-
ment with PDE-5 inhibitors, is not satisfactory and this condition presents an unmet medical need. Preclinical studies
using adipose-derived stem cells to treat ED have shown promising results. Herein, we report the results of a human
phase 1 trial with autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) freshly isolated after a liposuction.
Methods: Seventeen men suffering from post RP ED, with no recovery using conventional therapy, were enrolled in a
prospective phase 1 open-label and single-arm study. All subjects had RP performed 5–18 months before enrolment,
and were followed for 6 months after intracavernosal transplantation. ADRCs were analyzed for the presence of stem
cell surface markers, viability and ability to differentiate. Primary endpoint was the safety and tolerance of the cell
therapy while the secondary outcome was improvement of erectile function. Any adverse events were reported
and erectile function was assessed by IIEF-5 scores. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02240823.
Findings: Intracavernous injection of ADRCs was well-tolerated and only minor events related to the liposuction and
cell injections were reported at the one-month evaluation, but none at later time points. Overall during the study
period, 8 of 17 men recovered their erectile function and were able to accomplish sexual intercourse. Post-hoc strat-
ification according to urinary continence status was performed. Accordingly, for continent men (median
IIEFinclusion = 7 (95% CI 5–12), 8 out of 11 men recovered erectile function (IIEF6months = 17 (6–23)), corresponding
to a mean difference of 0.57 (0.38–0.85; p = 0.0069), versus inclusion. In contrast, incontinent men did not regain
erectile function (median IIEF1/3/6 months = 5 (95% CI 5–6); mean difference 1 (95% CI 0.85–1.18), p N 0.9999).
Interpretation: In this phase I trial a single intracavernosal injection of freshly isolated autologous ADRCs was a safe
procedure. A potential efficacy is suggested by a significant improvement in IIEF-5 scores and erectile function. We
suggest that ADRCs represent a promising interventional therapy of ED following prostatectomy.

1. Introduction
The promising potential of stem cell therapy for various diseases has
been subject to much basic research and has attracted significant clinical
interest. In clinical practice, however, such interventions remain largely
experimental outside of bone marrow transplantation and autologous
stem cell transplantation as related to chemotherapy (Dohner et al.,
2015). Clinical implementation of stem cell treatment for erectile dys-
function (ED) represents a plausible candidate for such an approach. It

 has been reported that mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow or
adipose tissue can correct ED in animal models (Gimble et al., 2012;
Lin et al., 2012). Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer affect-
ing 17% of all men (Chung and Gillman, 2014), of which approximately
25% receive a prostatectomy. Due to penile nerve injury, up to 86% of
patients experience ED (Salonia et al., 2012; Tal et al., 2009; Weyne
and Albersen, 2014) following prostatectomy. ED is defined as the
consistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain an erection suffi-
cient for satisfactory sexual performance (JAMA, 1993; Montorsi et al.,
2010). ED following prostatectomy is an important medical condition
that substantially decreases quality of life of the afflicted men and
their sexual partners (Litwin et al., 1998). Besides prostatectomy, ED
risk factors include widespread diseases such as hypertension and
obesity, but also medications such as β-blockers and anti-depressants,
as well as major life-style factors like smoking and alcohol use cause
ED (Shabsigh et al., 2005). Moreover, age is a risk factor; approximately
one third of men in their forties report ED symptoms, while more than
half of men over 60 years suffer from ED (Lewis et al., 2010). Although
the prevalence and impact of ED remain substantial, current penile
rehabilitation therapy following prostatectomy mainly consists of treat-
ment with PDE-5 inhibitors or injection therapy, which have an unim-
pressive clinical efficacy around 27% or lower (Chung and Gillman,
2014; Weyne and Albersen, 2014; Weyne et al., 2015). This condition
therefore presents a significant unmet medical need.
At the cellular level, ED is thought to be caused by neuro-vascular or
hormonal dysfunction resulting in impaired vasodilatation of penile
arteries (Salonia et al., 2012; Weyne and Albersen, 2014). When the
natural nocturnal erection is lost, the penis tissue enters a chronic
hypoxic state leading to vascular dysfunction (Mulhall et al., 2010).
Adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs, also referred to as stromal
vascular fraction, SVF) are able to differentiate into vascular cells and
neurons in vitro (Gimble et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2008; Zuk, 2010), and
a large body of preclinical work shows a surprisingly good effect of
ADRC injection into the corpora cavernosa (Lin et al., 2012). One
human study reported improved erectile function using umbilical cord
blood cells in 7 diabetic ED patients (Bahk et al., 2010). This latter
study demonstrates proof of concept for the use of cell therapy in
clinical ED treatment, even if the etiology of ED in diabetics may reflect
less nerve injury as compared to patients after radical prostatectomy
(RP) (Schauer et al., 2015). The safety of applying freshly isolated autol-
ogous ADRCs for non-homologous use in intracavernous injections has
not previously been explored.
We here report safety and preliminary efficacy outcomes from a
phase 1 clinical trial using autologous ADRCs for the treatment of ED
in 17 men after radical prostatectomy.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Design and Eligibility Criteria
Study population (Fig. 1): Seventeen patients with ED after RP (3
open, 14 robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomies) were enrolled
between May 2014 and September 2015 in this prospective, open-
label, single-arm and single-center study. All subjects had RP performed
at Odense University Hospital, Denmark, 5–18 months prior to enrol-
ment. Inclusion criteria were: age N18 years. Clinical follow-up was
required to show organ-confined prostate cancer without metastasis.
Patients had to be sexually active before RP and expressing a wish to
remain sexually active. Appropriate pharmacological intervention
(PDE-5 or PGE1 analog) must have been tried and deemed insufficient
to allow for inclusion. The participants were suggested to continue
medication throughout the study period if they felt the slightest effect.
Patients with no initial effect were encouraged to retry pharmacological
treatment, to see if they had changed responder-status. Patients were
told to continue other regular medications and pelvic physiotherapy
during the trial.
Exclusion criteria: treatment with anticoagulants; insufficient
subcutaneous fat; lack of sexual interest. We used the following

 outcome measurements. As described in (Olsen et al., 2015), the Inter-
national Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) and Erection Hardness
Score (EHS) were used to assess erectile function before RP at study
inclusion and 1, 3 and 6 months after ADRC treatment. Information on
urinary incontinence was assessed by International Consultation on In-
continence Questionnaire – Urinary Incontinence – Short form ques-
tionnaire (ICIQ-UI SF). Adverse events were recorded at each visit by
inspection of the injection site and posing the patients an open question,
“Did you experience any discomfort related to the operation since the
last visit?”, followed by specific questions regarding pain, bleeding and
swelling at the liposuction site as well as at the penis area.
2.2. Approvals
The study was approved by the Danish National Ethics Committee
(no. 37054), The Danish Health and Medicines Authority (EUDRA-CT
number 2013–004220-11) and the Danish Data Protection Agency
(2008–58-0035). The study was performed in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and ICH-GCP guidelines and monitored by the
GCP Unit at Odense University Hospital. All patients gave written
informed consent before participation. This study is registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02240823, Phase 1 Study. Can Fat Derived Stem
Cells (SVF) be used in the Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction After
Prostatectomy).
2.3. Procedures
2.3.1. Adipose Tissue Collection, ADRC Preparation, − Delivery and
Characterization
Briefly, adipose tissue collection was conducted during general
anesthesia, and harvesting was performed with water-jet-assisted lipo-
suction. Following immediate isolation of ADRCs, using an automated
processing Celution® 800/CRS system (Cytori Therapeutics, San Diego,
California, USA), these were injected into corpus cavernosum. ADRCs
were characterized by cell count, viability and subpopulation. For
details, refer to supplementary material.
2.4. Statistical Analysis
This was an exploratory pilot study and no sample size estimates
were calculated. We planned to include 30 patients with an interim
efficacy analysis upon reaching 15 evaluable patients. In case of a clini-
cally relevant positive signal at the interim analysis, the inclusion of
patients would be discontinued at this point. Data are presented as
medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) with exception of ADRC
characteristics, which are mean (SD). IIEF outcomes were analyzed by
repeated measurement two-way ANOVA with Sidak's post-hoc test for
multiple comparisons, following log transformation of data. Effect
sizes are presented as geometric mean differences with 95% confidence
intervals. EHS outcomes were analyzed by Friedman's test for multiple
non-parametric comparisons with Dunn's post-hoc test for multiple
comparisons. ICIQ-UI SF outcomes were analyzed by Wilcoxon's
matched pairs signed rank test. Associations between ADRCs and
volume of liposuction and donor age were analyzed by Pearson's
product–moment correlation. ADRC phenotypes between groups were
analyzed by the Mann–Whitney U test.
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).

bility for the decision to submit for publication.
3. Results
We included 17 men (Fig. 1) aged between 46 and 69 years (63 (9),
median (IQR)) years with ED after prostatectomy to intracavernosal
injection with their own ADRCs freshly isolated after a liposuction. All
patients had high IIEF-5 scores (23 (3), median (IQR)) and EHS scores
(4 (1), median (IQR)), and reported an active sex life before RP. Eleven
men were continent while 6 were incontinent at the time of inclusion,
but baseline characteristics including age, BMI, smoking, alcohol intake,
physical activity, degree of co-morbidities and medication were similar
for the two groups (Table 1). Time between RP and ADRC treatment
10.1 (5.7) (median (IQR) months with no difference (p = 0.2450,
Mann–Whitney test) between continent and incontinent men is
shown in Supplemental Fig. S1.
The characteristics of ADRCs isolated by the automated Celution®
system (Table 2) were comparable to those previously reported for
other ADRCs/SVF (Domenis et al., 2015) including yield (ADRCs/g fat
tissue, 1.4 × 105, 3.7 × 104; mean, SD), cell size (10.7, 0.2; mean, SD),
viability (84.7, 3.0; mean, SD) and, percentage of fibroblastoid colony
forming units (%CFU-F, 1.5, 0.8; mean, SD). The number of ADRCs
obtained per patient was strongly correlated to the amount of
lipoaspirate (Fig. 2A), while we observed no relationship between age
and yield per gram fat tissue (Fig. 2B). A large proportion of the freshly
isolated ADRCs expressed the surface markers CD34 (67.3, 11.0%; mean,
SD) and CD90 (71.3, 7.4%; mean, SD), whereas CD31 and CD73 each
defined smaller subpopulations (14.8%, 6.4% and 24.2%, 12.1%,
respectively; mean, SD) (Fig. 2C). The fraction of stromal stem cells as
defined phenotypically by the markers CD235a-CD45-CD31-CD34+,
encompassed approximately 26% of the parent ADRCs (Fig. 2D), which
is similar to what has been shown by others (Domenis et al., 2015;
Aronowitz and Ellenhorn, 2013).
The men received between 8.4–37.2 million ADRCs immediately
after cell isolation and were discharged from hospital the same day.
No serious adverse events were reported. Five patients reported minor
events related to the liposuction and ADRC injection at the one-month
evaluation time point. Two men had experienced transient redness
and swelling at the injection sites. One had a scrotal and penile hemato-
ma that resolved within 14 days. This patient had taken large doses of
NSAID medicine for back pain in the days before the treatment. Finally,
2 patients reported abdominal pain and tenderness for 2–6 days after

 the liposuction. All events resolved without intervention and at the 3-
and 6-month evaluations, no patients reported any side- or adverse
events.
During the study period, eight out of 17 participants recovered
erectile function after ADRC injection with the ability to complete inter-
course (Fig. 3A). Post-hoc stratification according to urine continence at
inclusion revealed an apparent strong conditional association to the
regain of function. Preliminary efficacy was solely demonstrated in the
patients that were continent at inclusion (Fig. 3). In the continent
group, the IIEF-5 score was unchanged 7 (Shabsigh et al., 2005) (median
(IQR) (mean 0.92 (95% CI 0.78–1.1), p = 0.3859, RM one-way ANOVA
with Sidak's multiple comparisons test) 1 month after the treatment,
but significantly increased to 11 (Gimble et al., 2013) (0.66, (0.44–
0.98), p = 0.0414) after 3 months and to 17 (Gimble et al., 2013)
(0.57 (0.38–0.85), p = 0.0069) after 6 months (Fig. 3B). The EHS scores
supported these data although with slight differences. The EHS data
were significantly increased at 6 months (3(1) (p = 0.0314, Friedman's
with Dunn's multiple comparisons test) as compared to inclusion
(1(1)), while no change was observed after 1 month and 3 months
(Fig. 3D). In the group of incontinent men, the IIEF-5 scores were
similar after 1, 3 and 6 months and did not differ from the score at the
time of inclusion (5 (1)(median (IQR) (mean 1 (95% CI 0·85–1.18),
p N 0.9999, RM one-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparisons
test), Fig. 3C). Likewise, EHS data for this group were unchanged
throughout the study period (fig. 3E). There were no differences
in ADRC characteristics between the groups of continent versus
incontinent men (table 2). To estimate the rate of spontaneous rever-
sion of ED post RP in our department, we reviewed the medical records
for 2010–2013. These included records of 165 prostatectomized men
with information about their sexual status and urine continence.
There were 135 urine continent men and 30 incontinent men. In these
groups, 40 and 4 men, respectively, reported having adequate sexual
function, and were able to complete intercourse with or without medi-
cation 6 and 12 months after operation (Fig. 3F).
Additionally, urinary incontinence scores (ICIQ-UI SF) were signifi-
cantly lower 6 months after ADRC injection in continent men 0
(Dohner et al., 2015) (median (IQR))(p = 0.0234, Wilcoxon matched
pairs signed rank test) as compared to inclusion 3 (Tal et al., 2009)
and a trend (8 (9) versus 12.5 (10.25)(p = 0.1875) was seen in
incontinent men as well (Supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that ADRC
treatment may also have a positive effect on incontinence per se.
4. Discussion
In this clinical trial autologous non-expanded stem cells have been
used for the treatment of ED following radical prostatectomy. In recent
years, much attention has been given to stem cell-based therapies in
general, and specifically in the field of urology where there has been a
great deal of hype in relation to treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED)
(Khera et al., 2015). Until now, there has been only one other published
clinical trial reporting a beneficial effect of non-autologous umbilical
cord cell transplantation in 3/7 men with type 2 DM (Bahk et al.,

207
M.K. Haahr et al. / EBioMedicine 5 (2016) 204–210
 2010). Earlier this year, this lack of substantial evidence from clinical
trials led to a commentary in which Khera et al. raised their concerns re-
garding stem cell treatment of ED patients outside an approved protocol
(Khera et al., 2015).
In this study, a single intracavernous injection of freshly isolated
autologous ADRCs was a feasible, safe and well-tolerated approach for
treating ED following radical prostatectomy. We did not observe any
serious adverse events within a 6-month time frame, which – while
clearly not sufficient for a long-term safety evaluation – nevertheless
is reassuring. The safety from clinical trials encompassing more than
1000 patients receiving bone marrow or adipose tissue-derived mesen-
chymal stem/stromal cells, does not suggest that serious adverse events
is a clinically important issue (Casiraghi et al., 2013). Importantly, post-
hoc stratification demonstrated that the majority of continent men with
ED after RP recovered erectile function within 3 months, and that this
effect persisted for 6 months. This potential efficacy of the ADRC therapy
was promisingly high, reaching 8/11 (73%). In contrast, such effect was
absent in the group of incontinent men. These different outcomes are
unlikely to result from underlying differences in the amount of injected
stem cells or in their phenotypes, since all analyzed parameters were
statistically equal between groups. However, the incontinent men may
represent individuals where damage to the neurovascular bundle has
resulted in partial disruption of urethral rhabdosphincter innervation
as reported recently (Reeves et al., 2015). Also, it should be noted that
these patients had lower inclusion IIEF5 and EHS scores compared to
the continent group and that 5 of the 6 incontinent men were initially
referred for prostate evaluation due to irritable lower urinary tract
symptoms before the RP. This suggests that the incontinent men, have
a more advanced neurovascular degeneration altogether which agrees
with previous reports showing a difference in spontaneous recovery
between continent and incontinent patients (Gandaglia et al., 2012). Fi-
nally, there is likely to be a psychological element, since incontinent
men may feel less sexually attractive because of the incontinence. We
believe the observation that incontinent men have no effect of ADRC
therapy for ED is important for future studies and clinical decisions
regarding which patient groups should be offered the therapy. ADRC
therapy seems to partly alleviate the patient's urinary incontinence
symptoms as measured by the ICIQ-UI SF scores (Supplemental
Fig. S2). While the clinical significance thereof is unclear, these data
are promising for treatment of incontinence per se.
Our results hold promise for the outcome of other ongoing clinical
trials with stem cells for ED therapy, especially one trial in RP patients
using allogeneic cultured stem cells derived from bone marrow
(NCT01983709), and for tests of mesenchymal stem cells in a wide
range of human diseases. For evaluation of the clinical impact, it will
be important to characterize the quality, stability and potency of differ-
ent types and preparations of mesenchymal stem cells. For instance, it is
not known if cultured ADRCs or ADRCs from another person, other mes-
enchymal stem cells or even induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells would
work as well as the freshly isolated stem cells used herein. If cultured
non-autologous ADRCs or iPS cells work equally well both from a safety
and efficacy point of view, this would have a large impact for the field
since cells from stem cell banks could then be used. We investigated
ED after RP, which is considered a severe form of ED with nerve injury;
however, it is not known if stem cell therapy would work in patients
with ED due to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lower urinary tract
diseases or simply age. Our results as well as results from the Korean
study in diabetic men (Bahk et al., 2010) suggest that stem cell therapy
may be effective for different types of ED.
Our study has several limitations. This pilot study was unblinded
without a control group. We cannot discern if the positive effect is a
result of the urologist interviews or the patient's own expectations to
stem cell therapy or if in fact the stem cells themselves by differentiation
have helped regenerate the erectile function (Gimble et al., 2013; Zuk,

in the group of incontinent men (n = 6) during the study period (RM one-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparisons test, following log transformation). Similarly, the EHS scores
were significantly improved after 6 months in the continent (D) but not in the incontinent group (E) (Friedman's test with Dunn's multiple comparisons test). (F) Spontaneous
reversion of ED post RP in our department was established reviewing 165 medical records. In groups of 135 urine continent men and 30 incontinent men, 40 and 4 men, respectively,
showed spontaneous reversion of ED.

 2010) or if a paracrine mechanism is responsible (Fandel et al., 2012;
Kimbrel et al., 2014). In general, reported degrees of ED after RP vary
greatly (14%–86%) depending on risk stratification and patient
selection, the experience of the surgeon, type of operation and the
measure and definition of ED (Weyne and Albersen, 2014). The result
that 8/11 (73%) of the continent men recovered erectile function after
ADRC therapy is promising, although further placebo-controlled trials
are needed to differentiate possible stem cell effects from spontaneous
regeneration. Regarding spontaneous regeneration, background data
from review of 165 medical journals from our urology department
showed that only 40/135 (29.6%) continent men and 4/30 (13.3%)
incontinent men recovered their erectile function 6 months and 1 year
after RP using conventional therapy. In a previous RCT study of much
milder forms of ED from our group (Olsen et al., 2015), only 7/57
(12.3%) men in a placebo control group recovered erectile function
(IIEF scores above 10) after 6 months. Likewise, others have analyzed
all 11 reported, randomized, controlled trials to enclose a penile rehabil-
itation of 20–25% following RP (Schauer et al., 2015). In the present
paper, we report that a much higher number of the stem cell-treated
RP-induced ED men with urinary continence had high IIEF scores after
6 months. Finally, the nine months' IIEF score data from 423 men with
ED after RP in the REACTT placebo-controlled study showed relatively
low recovery of erectile function after RP; 25.5% had high IIEF scores
in the “5 mg tadalafil (Cialis®) 3 times a day group” versus 14.2% with
high IIEF scores in the placebo group (Montorsi et al., 2014).
We did not include objective measurement for the recovery of
erectile function, like measurements of penile hemodynamics or nerve
impulse speed. We used EHS and IIEF scores that are generated on the
basis of patient questionnaires and thus could be biased by several
factors including interviewer effects and differences in the patients' un-
derstanding of the questions. In order to mitigate interviewer bias, we
used the same interviewer throughout the study, and interviewed the
patients at different time points using the same questions. A recent
study shows correlation between objective measurements and EHS
(Matsuda et al., 2014).
In conclusion, our findings suggest that autologous, freshly isolated
ADRCs are safe to use and possess potential efficacy in the treatment
of ED after RP. These findings need confirmation in an adequately
powered, randomized and placebo-controlled trial.

Interpretation
Our pilot data suggest that a single intracavernous injection of fresh-
ly isolated autologous ADRCs is a safe, and potentially efficient treat-
ment of ED following radical prostatectomy. These results suggest that
ADSCs can restore normal erectile function and such therapy may
become a significant in the treatment of ED. Our results hold promise
for the outcome of other ongoing clinical trials with stem cells
for ED therapy, especially one trial in RP patients using allogeneic,
cultured stem cells derived from bone marrow (NCT01983709),
and for tests of mesenchymal stem cells in a wide range of human
diseases.
