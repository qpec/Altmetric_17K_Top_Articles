Abstract
IMPORTANCE Despite the absence of data from randomized clinical trials, professional societies
recommend inferior vena cava (IVC) filters for patients with venous thromboembolic disease (VTE)
and a contraindication to anticoagulation therapy. Prior observational studies of IVC filters have
suggested a mortality benefit associated with IVC filter insertion but have often failed to adjust for
immortal time bias, which is the time before IVC filter insertion, during which death can only occur in
the control group.
OBJECTIVE To determine the association of IVC filter placement with 30-day mortality after
adjustment for immortal time bias.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This comparative effectiveness, retrospective cohort
study used a population-based sample of hospitalized patients with VTE and a contraindication to
anticoagulation using the State Inpatient Database and the State Emergency Department Database,
part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,
from hospitals in California (January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2011), Florida (January 1, 2005, to
December 31, 2013), and New York (January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2012). Data analysis was
conducted from September 15, 2015, to March 14, 2018.
EXPOSURE Inferior vena cava filter placement.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were
constructed with IVC filters as a time-dependent variable that adjusts for immortal time bias. The Cox
model was further adjusted using the propensity score as an adjustment variable.
RESULTS Of 126 030 patients with VTE, 61 281 (48.6%) were male and the mean (SD) age was 66.9
(16.6) years. In this cohort, 45 771 (36.3%) were treated with an IVC filter, whereas 80 259 (63.7%)
did not receive a filter. In the Cox model with IVC filter status analyzed as a time-dependent variable
to account for immortal time bias, IVC filter placement was associated with a significantly increased
hazard ratio of 30-day mortality (1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.22; P < .001). When the propensity score was
included in the Cox model, IVC filter placement remained associated with an increased hazard ratio of
30-day mortality (1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.22; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE After adjustment for immortal time bias, IVC filter placement was
associated with increased 30-day mortality in patients with VTE and a contraindication to
anticoagulation. Randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy of IVC filter
placement in patients with VTE and a contraindication to anticoagulation.

 Introduction
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes both pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein throm-
bosis (DVT), is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with an incidence of 117 cases
per 100 000 person-years1 and a 1-year mortality for PE of at least 22% in patients with Medicare.2
Treatment of patients with VTE is based on anticoagulation, but for many patients, this therapy is con-
traindicated owing to recent surgery or underlying coagulopathies. In patients with VTE and a contrain-
dication to anticoagulation, major professional societies, including the American College of Chest
Physicians,3 American Heart Association,4 Society of Interventional Radiology,5,6 American College of
Radiology,7 and the British Committee for Standards in Haematology8 recommend consideration of IVC
filter placement. While IVC filters have been widely available since the 1960s, their use in the United
States has steadily and dramatically increased from 2000 procedures in 1979 to more than 100 000
procedures in 2005.9 More recently, rates have begun to decline with approximately 96 000 proce-
dures in 2014.10 This use has occurred despite the absence of data on a mortality benefit associated
with IVC filter placement. An early randomized clinical trial showed a reduction in the number of symp-
tomatic PEs but no reduction in mortality after IVC filter insertion. Importantly, this trial excluded pa-
tients with a contraindication to anticoagulant therapy,11 which is, to our knowledge, the most widely
accepted indication for IVC filter placement and the only indication for which the several professional
societies agree. Retrievable IVC filters were analyzed in a randomized clinical trial12 of patients with PE
and a high likelihood of recurrence. In this trial,12 IVC filters did not lower recurrent PE, but patients with
a contraindication to anticoagulation were excluded. Thus, the findings of existing randomized clinical
trials are not applicable to a large segment of the VTE population.
As a result, in the last 3 years, observational studies have attempted to understand the
association between IVC filter placement in patients with VTE and a contraindication to
anticoagulation and their outcomes. These studies have often failed to adjust for immortal time bias,
which is the interval between hospital admission and IVC filter placement, during which time death
cannot occur in the intervention group but can occur in the control group.13 Failing to account for this
potential source of bias can erroneously skew the results in favor of the intervention by falsely
conferring a survival advantage to the treated group.13 Given this concern for unaccounted biases in
the context of a relatively common invasive procedure for which there is no evidence of a mortality
benefit, we conducted an analysis incorporating adjustment for immortal time bias using 2 different
statistical models to evaluate the outcomes of IVC filter placement in patients with VTE and a
contraindication to anticoagulation.
Methods
This comparative effectiveness, retrospective cohort study used the State Inpatient Database (SID)
and the State Emergency Department Database, a part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project
of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, from hospitals in California (January 1, 2005, to
December 31, 2011), Florida (January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2013), and New York (January 1, 2005,
to December 31, 2012).14,15 This study conformed to the International Society for
Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) reporting guideline. The SID includes inpatient
discharge records from nonfederal, short-term general hospitals. The SID data sets from California,
Florida, and New York contain an encrypted person identifier allowing longitudinal follow-up. Records
with a missing person identifier and records from psychiatric, dependency, and rehabilitation hospitals
were excluded. Same-day hospital transfers were considered a single hospitalization. Each SID record
contains International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis
and procedure codes. Diagnosis codes are assigned at discharge without corresponding timing
information and include 1 primary admitting diagnosis code that reflects the principle reason for
hospitalization. Each procedure code has corresponding timing information indicating the day of the
procedure during the hospitalization. The State Emergency Department Database includes records for

 hospital-affiliated emergency department visits not resulting in hospitalization. Emergency department
visits resulting in hospitalization are included in the SID. The Washington University Human Research
Protection Office granted this study an exemption from institutional review board oversight due to
the deidentified nature of the data set.
Study Population
Adult patients (aged ï¿½18 years) with inpatient records coded for PE and/or DVT were identified from
California (2006-2010), Florida (2006-2012), and New York (2006-2011). The earliest
hospitalization of a patient with PE or DVT was defined as the index hospitalization and was required
to have the preceding 12-month period free of inpatient records coded for PE, DVT, or IVC filter
insertion. Contraindications to anticoagulation were identified by ICD-9-CM diagnosis or procedure
codes and included any of the following: intracranial bleeding, other major bleeding,
thrombocytopenia, active gastrointestinal bleeding, aortic dissection, pericardial disease, bacterial
endocarditis, threatened abortion, preeclampsia and eclampsia, malignant hypertension, brain
surgery, spinal surgery or spinal puncture, and eye surgery coded at the index hospitalization or
within the prior 15 days (Table 1). In addition, hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, and cerebral
aneurysm coded at the index hospitalization or within the prior year were considered
contraindications to anticoagulation. Index hospitalizations with missing sex, residence outside the
hospital state, and hospitalization length of stay of more than 6 months were excluded.
Primary Exposure, Outcomes, and Other Baseline Characteristics
During the index hospitalization, IVC filter insertion was identified by the ICD-9-CM procedure code
38.7. Comorbidities were identified using the Elixhauser classification16 derived from the index
hospitalization and admissions within the preceding year. Medical insurance (Medicare, Medicaid,
private insurance, and other) and admission through the emergency department were identified at
the index hospitalization.
Statistical Analysis
Our primary method of analysis was a multivariable Cox model with IVC filter status as a time-
dependent variable to account for immortal time bias. The start time for this analysis was the date of
index hospitalization. Patients were followed up until the time of an event or censored at 30 days.
Patients with IVC filters were not identified until the time of procedure to allow for a time-dependent
IVC filter status. The following variables were used in the multivariable, time-dependent Cox model
and to build a propensity score with a logistic regression model: age, sex, primary payer, admission
through emergency department, thromboembolism, intracranial bleeding, other major bleeding,
thrombocytopenia, active gastrointestinal ulcer, hemophilia or von Willebrand disease, cerebral
aneurysm, aortic dissection, pericardial disease, bacterial endocarditis, preeclampsia and eclampsia,
malignant hypertension, brain surgery, spinal surgery, eye surgery, congestive heart failure, valvular
disease, pulmonary circulation disease, peripheral vascular disease, paralysis, other neurologic
disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, renal
failure, liver disease, peptic ulcer disease, lymphoma, metastatic cancer, solid tumors without
metastasis, rheumatoid arthritis, coagulopathy, obesity, weight loss, fluid and electrolyte disorders,
chronic blood loss anemia, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, psychoses, and depression. A second Cox
model was created that included the original variables and the propensity score as an additional
adjustment variable. The follow-up period started at the admission date of the index hospitalization
for individuals with and without IVC filter insertion. The primary outcome of interest was mortality at
30 days. Baseline characteristics of patients with and without IVC filter were compared using
2-sample t test for continuous variables and Ï2 test for categorical data. To account for any
overdispersion, the Pearson Ï2 test was used to adjust standard errors via quasi-likelihood
estimation. A 2-sided t test was used, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses
were conducted using SAS, version 9.3 and SAS Enterprise Guide, version 7.1 (SAS Institute Inc).

 Results
We identified 132 355 patients 18 years and older with an ICD-9-CM hospitalization code for PE, DVT,
or both along with a contraindication to anticoagulation from California (2006-2010), Florida
(2006-2012), and New York (2006-2011). After application of exclusion criteria, 126 124 patients
remained in the study. Of these, 94 patients with IVC filter had incomplete data for analysis, leaving
126 030 patients in the final study population (Figure), with 45 771 (36.3%) receiving an IVC filter
and 80 259 (63.7%) who did not receive an IVC filter. Baseline characteristics and coexisting
conditions are presented in Table 2. Of the 126 030 patients, 61 281 (48.6%) were male and the
mean (SD) age was 66.9 (16.6) years. The median time to IVC filter placement was 5.0 days
(interquartile range, 2.0-11.0 days).
When evaluated in a multivariable Cox model with IVC filter placement analyzed as a time-
dependent variable to account for immortal time bias, IVC filter placement was associated with an
increased hazard ratio of mortality (1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.22; P < .001). After the addition of the
propensity score to the multivariable Cox model, IVC filter placement continued to be associated
with an increased hazard ratio of mortality (1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.22; P < .001).
Discussion
The most significant finding of this study of IVC filter use in patients with VTE and a contraindication
to anticoagulation is that treatment with an IVC filter was associated with a higher 30-day mortality
than treatment without IVC filter placement after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities,
immortal times bias, and the propensity to receive a filter.
The initial long-term evaluation of IVC filter use was by Greenfield et al in 198117 and was
expanded in the late 1980s18 to include 469 patients. This study showed a 4% rate of PE in patients
after placement of an IVC filter but had suboptimal follow-up and lacked a control group. Largely
based on this work, IVC filter implantation increased from 2000 procedures in 1979 to more than
100 000 in 2005.9 At present, there are 2 randomized clinical trials evaluating the long-term
outcomes of IVC filter use. The first, originally published in 199811 with a follow-up report in 2005,19
found that patients with VTE who were randomized to receive IVC filters experienced a reduction in
symptomatic PE, no change in mortality, and an increased risk of recurrent DVT. Importantly, this trial
excluded patients with a contraindication to anticoagulation, negating its applicability to the subset
of patients in whom IVC filters are most universally recommended. The second study,12 published in
2015, randomized 399 patients with PE and a high probability of recurrence to anticoagulation and
a retrievable IVC filter vs anticoagulation alone. The outcomes of the 2 groups did not differ with
respect to the primary outcome of recurrent PE or secondary outcomes including death or DVT at 3

 or 6 months. Because both groups had anticoagulation, patients with a contraindication to
anticoagulation were excluded. In contrast, our study evaluates a diverse patient population with
multiple contraindications to anticoagulation and not only extends the findings of prior IVC filter
publications but also adjusts for the effect of immortal time in observational studies to bias results in
favor of intervention.
Given the widespread use of IVC filters and persistent questions regarding their efficacy, several
observational studies within the last 5 years have attempted to further evaluate the association of
IVC filter use and mortality.2,20-22 These studies, which involved different subgroups of patients with
VTE having varying ability to tolerate anticoagulation, were similar in that none of them adjusted for
immortal time bias. In contrast, a 2016 study23 did attempt to address the issue of immortal time bias
in the assessment of IVC filter efficacy. This study retrospectively analyzed patients without cancer
in California with acute VTE and included both patients who could tolerate anticoagulation and those
with a contraindication. The only group of patients in whom IVC filter use significantly reduced the
short-term risk of death was the approximately 3000-patient subset with acute VTE and a
contraindication to anticoagulation owing to active bleeding. Referring an actively bleeding patient
for an invasive procedure is likely to involve selection bias whereby the sickest patients are
considered too high risk for the procedure and are relegated to the control group, thus possibly
confounding the results. This study attempts to expand on these findings by analyzing a diverse
patient cohort including multiple states, patients with cancer, patients with a contraindication to
anticoagulation, and patients who are and are not actively bleeding.
Limitations
Our findings should be interpreted within the context of several limitations. This study is
retrospective and uses observational data derived from codes designed for reimbursement. A 2016
study proposed that the use of diagnostic codes from claims data can lead to an underestimation of
event rates.24 Furthermore, retrospective observational studies may be subject to various types of
bias that persist despite various techniques to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics.
Therefore, these results should be considered hypothesis generating only. Second, this study only
captured patient deaths during the index hospitalization, on a repeated admission or at a subsequent
emergency department visit in the same state as the index hospitalization, thereby allowing for the
possibility that some out-of-hospital or out-of-state deaths were not captured. However, there is no
reason to believe these uncaptured events would occur more frequently in one group than in the
other. Third, contraindications to anticoagulation span a range from minor relative contraindications
to severe absolute contraindications. The lack of granularity of administrative data precludes the
determination of the degree of absoluteness of any patientâ
s contraindication to anticoagulation,
whether therapeutic anticoagulation was attempted but required discontinuation, or if a patient was

 a suitable candidate for an IVC filter. Fourth, we are unable to determine whether the IVC filters used
were retrievable and whether they were ever retrieved.
Conclusions
This analysis suggests that patients with a contraindication to anticoagulation who receive an IVC
filter have an increased risk of death at 30 days after adjustment for baseline differences,
comorbidities, immortal time bias, and propensity score compared with similar patients who did not
receive an IVC filter. Randomized clinical trials are required to determine the efficacy of IVC filter
placement in patients with VTE and a contraindication to anticoagulation.
