Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most prominent cell types in the stromal 
compartment of the tumor microenvironment. CAFs support multiple aspects of cancer progression, 
including tumor initiation, invasion, and metastasis. The heterogeneous nature of the stromal 
microenvironment is attributed to the multiple sources from which the cells in this compartment 
originate. The present study provides the first evidence that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are one of 
the key sources of CAFs in the tumor niche. We generated CSC-like cells by treating mouse induced 
pluripotent stem cells with conditioned medium from breast cancer cell lines. The resulting cell 
population expressed both CSC and pluripotency markers, and the sphere-forming CSC-like cells formed 
subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. Intriguingly, these CSC-like cells always formed heterogeneous 
populations surrounded by myofibroblast-like cells. Based on this observation, we hypothesized 
that CSCs could be the source of the CAFs that support tumor maintenance and survival. To address 
this hypothesis, we induced the differentiation of spheres and purified the myofibroblast-like cells. 
The resulting cells exhibited a CAF-like phenotype, suggesting that they had differentiated into the 
subpopulations of cells that support CSC self-renewal. These findings provide novel insights into the 
dynamic interplay between various microenvironmental factors and CAFs in the CSC niche.
The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an indispensable role in the development and progression of cancer. 
The stromal compartment of the TME is comprised of a variety of cell types, including endothelial cells, fibro-
blasts, and immune cells, each possessing distinct yet complementary functions that support tumor architecture 
and maintenance1. Recent insights into the dynamic coevolution of mutated epithelial cells and the adjacent 
stromal compartment during cancer progression have prompted researchers to focus on the study of stromal cells. 
Stromal cells make up more than 80% of tumor volume in pancreatic and breast cancer and play a key role in the 
development and progression of cancer2.
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the stromal compartment of the TME play a key role in tumorigenesis 
by mediating tumor growth, angiogenesis, inflammation, stromal remodeling, drug resistance, and metastasis. 
The multifunctional role of CAFs is attributed to their ability to mediate crosstalk between numerous signaling 
pathways by secreting essential factors and via the extracellular matrix. Recent studies indicate that CAFs have 
substantial clinical implications in disease staging and cancer recurrence. However, CAFs have not been fully 
characterized due to several limitations3. First, the origin of CAFs remains unclear. CAFs potentially originate 
from epithelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells, adipocytes, resident fibroblasts, and bone marrow stem cells4. The

heterogeneous origin of CAFs accounts for their broad range of characteristics and molecular markers, a feature 
that makes it difficult to accurately distinguish CAF subpopulations from one another. Second, since CAFs have 
the innate ability to utilize the surrounding microenvironment to support their own growth therefore it is diffi-
cult to isolate and maintain them. Notably, the microenvironment that supports the growth of CAFs is similar to 
the microenvironment that supports the viability of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recent studies suggest that several 
types of stromal cells in the CSC niche play pivotal roles in maintaining the small population of CSCs respon-
sible for cancer recurrence and drug resistance4. However it is unclear if CSCs directly support tumor mainte-
nance and survival by generating CAFs. Although there is evidence to support the hypothesis that CAF-mediated 
paracrine signaling preserves the stemness of patient-derived primary CSCs over time5, this hypothesis has yet 
to be confirmed. Our group recently developed a unique CSC model from mouse induced pluripotent stem 
(miPS) cells cultured with cancer cell-conditioned medium that mimicked the conditions of the tumor niche6. 
Using this model, we found that CSCs gave rise to vascular endothelial-like cells, thereby creating a niche that 
maintained the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, and supported the growth of heterogeneous 
tumors7. Furthermore, we generated a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma CSC model to study the effects of TME 
factors in vivo and a mechanism of CSC differentiation mediated by the maintenance of self-renewal potential 
and integrity8.
In the present study, we tested our hypothesis that CSCs can differentiate into CAF-like cells (CAFLCs) in the 
cancer niche. We generated CSCs by treating miPS cells with conditioned medium from BT549 or T47D cells, 
two breast cancer cell lines representing different hormone subtypes. The resulting CSC-like cells formed spheres 
that differentiated into various cell types, including myofibroblast-like cells. Further analysis revealed that the 
myofibroblast-like cells phenotypically resembled CAFLCs, supporting our hypothesis that CSCs might be a key 
source of CAFs in the tumor niche. Furthermore, our in vitro CSC model system provides a unique tool for ana-
lyzing the role of CAFs derived from CSC-like cells in the tumor microenvironment.
Results
miPS cells treated with breast cancer cell-conditioned medium differentiate into CSC-like 
cells. 
Our group previously established a protocol to generate CSC-like cells by culturing miPS cells in con-
ditioned medium from mouse cancer cell lines. Our findings suggested that cancer cell-conditioned medium is 
a rich source of secreted factors that potentially mimic the TME6, 8. In this study, we used miPS cells expressing 
a gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of Nanog promoter, thereby allowing us to 
distinguish self-renewing undifferentiated CSCs from differentiated CSCs by the presence or absence of GFP 
expression, respectively. Conditioned medium was generated from two different breast cancer cell lines, T47D 
and BT549; respective culture medium was collected in 5% serum condition according to the previously estab-
lished protocol6. Subsequently, the miPS cells were treated with this conditioned medium for a period of four 
weeks by changing the medium every second day. Untreated miPS cells failed to survive beyond one week because 
they require Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and feeder cells to survive in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In 
contrast, miPS cells cultured in conditioned medium (CM-T47D and CM-BT549 cells) proliferated. CM-T47D 
and CM-BT549 cells were morphologically heterogeneous and consisted of a significant number of GFP-positive 
subpopulations (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1b). To determine if CM-T47D and CM-BT549 cells maintained 
the expression of pluripotency markers, we analyzed gene expression in both GFP-positive and GFP-negative 
cells using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). CM-T47D and CM-BT549 cells expressed the 
pluripotency markers Oct3/4 and Sox2, whereas they did not express the Klf4 and c-Myc transgenes, suggesting 
that the identity of CM-T47D and CM-BT549 cells could primarily be controlled by undetermined endoge-
nous genes (Fig. 1b,c). Notably, the key CSC marker CD133 and the epithelial carcinoma marker EpCam were 
expressed at levels 3- to 10-fold higher in CM-T47D and CM-BT549 cells compared with untreated miPS cells. 
Furthermore, the sustained expression of GFP supports the hypothesis that CM-T47D and CM-BT549 cells had 
differentiated into CSC-like cells (Fig. 1a) because Nanog reportedly promotes CSC-like characteristics9. These 
findings suggest that differentiation into CSC-like cells was induced by changes in endogenous gene expression 
mediated by factors secreted from the conditioned medium and that the conditioned medium mimics the TME. 
Next, we evaluated the tumorigenicity of the heterogeneous CSC-like cell population by subcutaneously trans-
planting the cells into Balb/c nude mice. The transplanted cells formed tumors with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic 
ratio and poorly-differentiated glandular structures characteristic of adenocarcinoma (Fig. 1a,d and e). Notably, 
we previously demonstrated that untreated miPS cells subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice only formed 
non-cancerous teratomas6. Flow cytometry analysis showed that conditioned medium-treated cells, CM-T47D 
and CM-BT549 were composed of a certain degree of CD44+/CD24−
/low expressing population, while its expres-
sion seems to be more pronounced in the primary culture cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). Subsequently, serial sub-
cutaneous transplantations also gave rise to tumors, indicating that the cells were enriched for CSCs and that they 
maintained their tumorigenicity (Supplementary Fig. 3a). It is also suggested that human epidermal growth factor 
receptor (Her2) is a marker found to be associated with the CSC population in breast cancer tumors10. Therefore, 
we evaluated Her2 expression in tissue sections from orthotropic tumor transplants in the third mammary fat 
pad of Balb/c nude mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis of tumor tissue sections revealed high levels of Her2, 
indicating that breast CSCs population had become enriched in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 3b).
As the original miPS cells express a puromycin resistance gene, we used puromycin selection to completely 
deplete the tumors of cells originating from the nude mice. Following this selection process, the cells were 
renamed CSCcmT47D or CSCcmBT549 cells according to the conditioned medium in which they had origi-
nally been cultured. After the puromycin selection, primary CSCcmT47D and CSCcmBT549 cells exhibited a 
greater number GFP-expressing colonies surrounded by myofibroblast-like cells. This observation confirmed 
that miPS-derived CSC-like cells were present in the primary cultures (Fig. 1a). Since our flow cytometry analysis 
clearly indicated the enrichment of cells displaying markers associated with CSC in primary cultures and previous

studies regarding the establishment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma mouse model had demonstrated the 
same by RNA sequencing analysis8. Therefore, all further experiments were conducted using primary culture 
cells.
Sphere-formation and differentiation are critical for a hierarchy of cancer stem progenitor cells. 
 
Previous evidence suggests that the ability to form spheres is associated with CSC properties11. Therefore, we con-
ducted sphere formation assays to further evaluate the CSC-like characteristics of CSCcmT47D and CSCcmBT549 
cells. Sphere formation was significantly enhanced in CSCcmT47D and CSCcmBT549 cells compared to control 
cells (Fig. 2a), and single cells derived from dissociated spheres gave rise to new spheres over serial passages 
(Supplementary Fig. 4). RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the CSC marker CD133 was expressed at higher levels 
in spheres (sphereT and sphereB in Fig. 2b) compared with primary CSCcmT47D and CSCcmBT549 adherent 
cells, suggesting that the spheres were enriched for CSC-like cells (Fig. 2b). Sphere-forming cells subcutane-
ously transplanted into nude mice formed tumors, indicating that they retained their tumorigenicity (Fig. 2c). To 
determine the lineage of cells originating from the enriched CSC, the spheres were induced to differentiate under 
anchorage-dependent conditions. The cells were cultured in conditioned medium collected from CSCcmT47D or 
CSCcmBT549 cells that had been cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% knockout serum replacement (KSR) 
(Fig. 2d). As differentiated cells did not survive in the original 1:1 conditioned medium, we assumed that unde-
termined factors in the primary cell-conditioned medium induced the spheres to differentiate. The differentiated 
cells consisted of heterogeneous sphere-like colonies of GFP-expressing cells surrounded by myofibroblast-like 
cells. Interestingly, even after multiple rounds of dissociation and passaging, both undifferentiated and differenti-
ated cells were observed. Notably, the myofibroblast-like cells directly surrounded the sphere-like cells. Based on 
these observations, we hypothesized that the close interaction between these subpopulations might be required 
for CSC self-renewal and maintenance (Fig. 2e)7.
Myofibroblast-like cells from CSC colonies exhibit a CAF-like phenotype. 
Although multiple ori-
gins of CAFs have been proposed in recent studies, the origin of TME heterogeneity remains elusive12. To investi-
gate the role of CAFs in the TME, we separated differentiated myofibroblast-like cells from sphere-derived CSCs 
using mouse feeder-specific magnetic microbeads or magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) (Fig. 3a). To gen-
erate control cells, the original miPS cells were induced to differentiate into fibroblast-like cells using previously 
reported protocols13, 14. After the cells differentiated, they were separated using magnetic beads. The pure fibro-
blasts isolated from the original miPS cells are referred to as miPS-fibroblasts (Fig. 3b). We quantitatively analyzed 
the expression of the CAF markers fibroblast specific protein (FSP1), α
-smooth muscle actin (α
-SMA), stromal 
derived factor-1 (CXCL12), and transforming growth factor (TGFβ
1), as well as platelet derived growth factor 
(PDGFα
), alpha-1 type collagen (Col1α
1), and the fibroblast-specific marker vimentin. All of these genes were 
upregulated in myofibroblast-like cells compared with miPS-fibroblasts (Figs 3c and 4a). These findings supported 
our hypothesis that differentiated myofibroblast-like cells from sphere-derived CSCs resemble CAFs. Therefore, 
we named these cells CSCcmT47D-CAFLCs or CSCcmBT549-CAFLCs. A recent study of the TME reported 
that tumors are composed of various subpopulations of CAFs15. Consistent with these findings, spheres gener-
ated from primary CSCcmT47D and CSCcmBT549 cells differentiated into a heterogeneous population of CAFs 
(CSCcmT47D-CAFLCs or CSCcmBT549-CAFLCs). Compared with miPS-fibroblasts, CSCcmT47D-CAFLCs 
expressed higher levels of α
-SMA, CXCL12, TGFβ
1, Vimentin, and PDGFα
; whereas, α
-SMA expression was 
undetectable (Fig. 3c and data not shown). In contrast, CSCcmBT549-CAFLCs expressed high levels of genes 
encoding CAF secretory factors, as well as α
-SMA, Vimentin, and Col1α
1 (Fig. 4a). Moreover, hematoxylin and 
eosin (H&E) staining revealed that CSCcmT47D and CSCcmBT549 spheroid cell-derived tumors were highly 
enriched for stromal cells (Fig. 4b), consistent with the results of our in vitro experiments (Figs 3c and 4a). These 
observations further confirm that breast cancer cell-conditioned medium plays a pivotal role in the differentiation 
of CSC spheres.
CSC-derived CAFs express CAF markers and have high invasive potential. 
Recent studies char-
acterizing CAFs used multiple markers, as there is no single distinguishing marker associated with CAFs. We 
chose to analyze the CAF markers FSP1, α
-SMA, and fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) using immu-
nohistochemistry, because these proteins are considered key markers for identifying major subpopulations of 
CAF4. CSCcmBT549-CAFLCs expressed all three markers, whereas CSCcmT47D-CAFLCs expressed FSP1 
and FAP, but not α
-SMA (Fig. 5a,b). These findings were consistent with the results of RT-qPCR assays (Figs 3c 
and 4a). Therefore, we propose that the respective CSC-conditioned medium could contribute significantly to 
the differentiation from CSCs to CAFs. A previous study using GFP-labelled CAFs demonstrated that CAFs 
might guide tumor cell migration at the invasive front16. Using a Matrigel invasion assay, we confirmed that 
CSCcmT47D-CAFLCs and CSCcm BT549-CAFLCs were highly invasive compared with miPS-fibroblasts 
(Fig. 6a). To trace the lineage of CSCcmT47D-CAFLCs, we conducted in situ hybridization for GFP in combi-
nation with immunofluorescence staining for FSP1. Unexpectedly, the GFP and FSP1 signals were significantly 
stronger in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm (Fig. 6b). In contrast, GFP florescence intensity in primary 
CAFLCs was attenuated. We speculate that, although CSCs differentiate into CAFLCs, they could be multipotent 
and maintain phenotypic plasticity. A previous study reported that multipotent primary CAFs were present in 
hepatocellular carcinoma tissue16. Another study reported that CAFs isolated from colon cancer patients retained 
a stem cell-like phenotype17. These previous reports reinforce our findings that CAFLCs originate from CSC-like 
cells.

Discussion
The present study provides the first experimental evidence suggesting that CSCs are a key source of CAFs in the 
TME. We generated CSCs by treating miPS cells with conditioned medium from BT549 (claudin low) or T47D 
(luminal A) breast cancer cells. These cell lines were initially established from invasive ductal breast carcinoma. 
We chose to use cancer cell-conditioned medium to evaluate the effects of diverse tumor niche-derived factors 
on CSC differentiation in order to evade the caveats associated with introducing genetic modifications. We found

that GFP-positive cells treated with conditioned medium upregulated the expression of CD133 and and the epi-
thelial carcinoma marker found to overexpressed in breast carcinoma Epcam in addition to CD44+/CD24−
/low, 
suggesting that they had differentiated into CSC-like cells. Indeed, previous studies from several groups have 
demonstrated that conditioned medium from non-cancerous cell type did not support the generation of cells with 
oncogenic potential, although this medium was inducing differentiation of the pluripotent stem/iPS cells18–21. 
Therefore, it is unlikely that the conditioned medium from non-cancerous cells is capable of converting iPS cells 
into cancer stem cell state. The CM-T47D and CM-BT549 cells were morphologically heterogeneous; therefore, 
we conducted subcutaneous transplantation experiments to enrich the population of CSC-like cells. In vivo trans-
plantation is a valuable approach for evaluating the tumorigenic potential of CSCs, as the tumor microenviron-
ment facilitates CSC enrichment22. Cells treated with the conditioned medium formed tumors with a high nuclear 
to cytoplasmic ratio and glandular structures indicative of adenocarcinoma-like phenotype. Moreover, subse-
quent serial transplantations did not attenuate their tumorigenicity. Therefore, this approach facilitated the study

of CSC lineage in vitro. In addition, the enrichment of CSCs in vivo allowed us to evade the limitations associated 
with CSCs isolated from cancer cell lines7.
Sphere formation is a key indicator of CSC tumorigenicity11. The CSCs we established gave rise to a sig-
nificant number of spheres in non-adherent serum-free conditions. GFP expression facilitated the selection of 
self-renewing spheres from aggregates. Sphere-forming CSCs are considered more tumorigenic than their adher-
ent counterparts18. Accordingly, spheres that were subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice formed tumors 
with adenocarcinoma-like features, thereby confirming their tumorigenic potential. Expression levels of CD133, 
a gene essential to CSC enrichment, increase 3- to 7-fold in CSC spheres23.
Under adherent conditions, spheres have the distinctive ability to differentiate into various cell types and to 
proliferate24. Notably, during this differentiation, feeder-like myofibroblast cells surrounded undifferentiated cell 
populations. We induced differentiation of spheres with primary CSCcmBT549- and CSCcmT47D-conditioned 
medium in which FBS was replaced with a low concentration of KSR medium diluted in DMEM. Many recent 
studies have preferentially used serum-free medium to avoid the potential for spontaneous and uncontrolled 
differentiation. The serum-free primary CSC-conditioned medium facilitated slower and more controlled

differentiation in adherent conditions, thereby enabling us to evaluate the cell types that play an important role in 
maintaining the CSC population. Differentiated myofibroblast-like cells exhibited a spindle-shaped morphology 
with prominent nucleoli, and they expressed elevated levels of the CAF markers α
-SMA, Vimentin. To confirm 
that this cell population did not include normal or activated fibroblasts, we compared them with miPS-fibroblasts.

miPS-fibroblasts cells did not express CAF markers, indicating that CAFLCs originated from CSC-derived fibro-
blasts. Moreover, genes encoding CAF secretory factors that promote cancer cell invasion and disease progres-
sion, including CXCL12, TGFβ
1, and PDGFα
, were upregulated in CSC-derived fibroblasts. Consistent with 
these findings, immunohistochemistry assays demonstrated that CSC-derived fibroblast cells expressed the CAF 
markers FSP, α
-SMA, and FAP. However, these markers were upregulated at the mRNA level but not the protein 
level. This discrepancy could be due to limitations associated with a lack of paracrine signaling and an inability 
to mimic the tumor niche in vitro. CAFs exhibited strong invasive potential compared with miPS-fibroblasts, 
consistent with the results of a previous study in which CAFs isolated from patient samples were more invasive 
then tumor cells25.
We also characterized the distinct subpopulations of CSC-derived CAFLCs. Zeisberg et al. previously reported 
that different types of CAFs express different markers and that the stromal compartment of the TME has dis-
tinct subpopulations of CAFs that exclusively express either FSP1 or α
-SMA along with several other classes of 
unknown markers26. Our results indicate that CAF heterogeneity might result from the differences in epigenetic 
and TME changes associated with their CSC progenitors. Consistent with a previous report, we could not main-
tain CSC-derived CAFs for more than five passages27. Notably, some isolated CAFs subpopulations were able to 
revert to a stem cell-like state, and fully differentiated CSC-derived CAFs did not survive. This phenomenon was 
not observed in normal miPS cells. Ishikawa et al. demonstrated that primary cultures of patient-derived breast 
cancer cells exhibited both CAF and CSC-like properties28. Similarly, primary CSCcmBT549 and CSCcmT47D 
cells that gave rise to GFP-positive stem cell colonies surrounded by differentiated fibroblast-like cells survived 
repeated passages. Madar et al. proposed that the CAF is not a cell but a “state”
. Consistent with this hypothesis, 
CAFs can switch between a stem cell-like state and a fully differentiated CAF-like state, thereby providing a niche 
that supports CSC survival1. A recent study demonstrated that primary cultures of patient-derived lung CSCs 
could be maintained for extended periods of time when CAFs were used as feeder cells5. This finding supports 
our hypothesis that CSCs require CAFs to survive.
To determine if our findings could be reproduced in other stem cell types, we conducted similar experi-
ments using mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells treated with conditioned medium from BT549 cells to gener-
ate iPS-CSCs as previously described6. As these cells constitutively expressed GFP, we could continuously trace 
them as they differentiated into CAFs from CSC-like cells. The resulting CSC-like cells were subcutaneously 
injected into nude mice, and primary cells were cultured from the resulting tumors. Interestingly, the majority 
of the tumor stromal cells originated from the injected CSC-like cells (Supplementary Fig. 5). Cells expressing 
fibroblast-specific markers were isolated from the primary cell cultures using MACS and subsequently analyzed 
using immunohiostochemistry assays for the CAF markers FSP1, FAP, and α
-SMA (Supplementary Fig. 6). 
CSC-like cells that gave rise to CAFLCs were identified by the coexpression of GFP and CAF markers. To further 
verify that CSC-like cells could differentiate into CAFLCs, we evaluated spheres generated from BT549 cells. 
Spheres collected from cells cultured in serum-free conditions were allowed to differentiate in adherent con-
ditions in the presence of BT549-conditioned medium. Some differentiated cells expressed the CAF markers 
FSP1 and α
-SMA (Supplementary Fig. 7). Together, these observations support our hypothesis that CSCs are a 
potential source of CAFLCs.
The present study demonstrated that CAFs in the TME play an indispensable role in the maintenance of 
CSCs. There are several reports that CAFs and/or CAF-conditioned medium contribute to cancer cell metasta-
sis by promoting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition15. Although the precise mechanism by which CSCs 
differentiate into CAFs needs to be deciphered, we generated preliminary evidence that TGFβ
1 plays a role in 
this process. CSCcmT47D spheres cultured in serum-free differentiation medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml 
TGFβ
1 differentiated into CAFLCs that express FSP1, Vimentin, Col1α
1, and CXCL12. Similar to spheres cul-
tured in conditioned medium, these cells did not express α
-SMA. However, the CAFLCs could not be maintained 
for more than two passages, and they did not form GFP-positive CSC colonies surrounded by fibroblast-like cells. 
These findings indicate that additional niche factors and paracrine signaling are required for this phenomenon 
(Supplementary Fig. 8).
In summary, we demonstrated that CSCs are a key source of CAFLCs in the TME. CAFLCs are dependent on 
one other for survival. The heterogeneity of CAFs in different types of cancer could be explained by understand-
ing the mechanism of CSC-to-CAF conversions. We propose that inhibiting the conversion of CSCs to CAFs 
might have potential therapeutic implications in the future.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture. 
The human breast cancer cell lines, T47D (ATCC HTB-133) and BT549 (ATCC HTB-122), were 
cultured in RPMI-1640 (Sigma) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, NY) and 100 
U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Wako, Japan). The conditioned medium (CM) was collected as previously 
described6. miPS (iPS MEF-Ng-20D-17) cells (Riken Cell Bank, Japan)29 were maintained in DMEM (Sigma) sup-
plemented with 15% FBS, 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids (NEAA) (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Nacalai 
Tesque, Japan), 50 U/ml P/S, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Millipore, MA), and 1000 U/ml Leukemia Inhibitory 
Factor (LIF) (Millipore, MA) on a feeder layer of mitomycin-treated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells 
(Reprocell, Japan). The miPS cells expressed GFP under the control of the Nanog promoter. For the conditioned 
medium treatment, miPS cells were cultured with CM and miPS medium (1:1) in the absence of LIF and MEF 
feeder cells, and the medium was changed every 24 hours for 4 weeks. Primary CSCs derived from mouse allo-
grafts was maintained in the same medium. To induce sphere formation, primary CSCs were cultured in miPS 
medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 U/ml P/S until they reached 80% cell confluence. Then, the medium 
was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 5% knockout serum replacement (KSR) (Gibco), 0.1 mM NEAA, 
2 mM glutamine, and 50 U/ml P/S. The medium was collected after the cells reached 100% confluence. The CM

was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes, purified through a filter with 0.22 μ
m-diameter pores (Millipore, 
Ireland), and stored at −
20 °C until further use.
Sphere formation, differentiation, and separation. 
The cells (5 ×
 104) were seeded on 6-cm ultra-low 
 
attachment dishes (Corning Incorporated, NY) in FBS-free DMEM supplemented with Insulin-Transferrin- 
Selenium-X (ITS-X) (Life Technologies, CA), 0.1 mM NEAA, 2 mM L-glutamine, and P/S. After 3–4 days, 
sphere-forming cells were collected by centrifuging the cells at 300 rpm for 5 minutes and resuspending them 
in 1×
 phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After aspirating the PBS, the spheres were dissociated using Accutase® 
cell detachment solution (Sigma, USA). Then, the cells were seeded at a density of 1 ×
 104 cells/ml in ultra-low 
attachment dishes the same medium. After 4 days, spheres with a diameter of approximately 100 μ
m were seeded 
in 6-cm adherent dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma) containing a 1:1 ratio of DMEM supplemented with 
5% KSR and P/S, and CM from the primary CSCs. The medium was changed every other day, and differentiated 
cells were maintained for no longer than 2–3 passages before being dissociated. Differentiated cells were separated 
using feeder removal microbeads, an LS column, and a Midi MACS separator (Miltenyi Biotec, Singapore). The 
cells were subsequently maintained in the same medium supplemented with KSR for up to 5 passages.
Animal experiments. 
Four-week-old female Balb/c-nu/nu mice (Charles River, Japan) were subcutaneously 
injected with 1 ×
 106 cells suspended in 200 μ
l of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Gibco). Tumors were 
harvested once they grew to a size of approximately 1000 mm3. Primary spheres were resuspended in 200 μ
l of 
Matrigel matrix (Corning Incorporated, NY) and subcutaneously injected into 4-week-old nude mice. The proto-
col for the animal experiments was reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Okayama 
University under ID OKU2013252, OKU2014157, OKU2014429, and OKU2016078. All of the experiments were 
conducted in accordance with the Policy on the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Okayama University.
Histological analysis. 
Tumors were excised from the mice 4 weeks post-transplantation. The tumors were 
fixed in 4% paraformaldehye (Wako, Japan) and embedded in paraffin. The paraffin tumor blocks were sectioned 
into 5 μ
m thick slices. Then, the sections were deparaffinized and stained with 0.5% hematoxylin (Sigma Aldrich) 
and Eosin Y (Sigma Aldrich) for histological analysis.
Immunofluorescent staining. 
The cells were seeded at a density of 1 ×
 105 cells/ml on 0.1% gelatin-coated 
coverslips in 24-well culture plates. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehye for 20 minutes at room temper-
ature, and subsequently permeabilized using 0.2% Triton-X (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) in PBS for 5 minutes. Then, 
the cells were washed and incubated in blocking solution (PBS supplemented with 5% BSA and FBS) for 1 hour. 
The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-rabbit FSP1 (1:300) (Merck 
Millipore, Ireland), anti-rabbit α
-SMA (1:200) (Abcam), and anti-rabbit FAP alpha (1:200) (Abcam). After being 
washed with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:300) (Invitrogen, USA) 
for 1 hour. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′
,6-diamino-3-phenylidole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Sigma). The 
cells were mounted on glass sides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs, USA). Images were acquired 
using an Olympus microscope equipped with a fluorescence lamp (Olympus, Japan).
RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). 
Total RNA was 
extracted from cells using an RNAeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany), and the extracted RNA was treated 
with DNase I (Invitrogen, USA). One μ
g of RNA was reverse transcribed using a Superscript First-Strand 
kit (Invitrogen). qPCR assays were conducted using LightCycler 480 SYBR green I Master Mix (Roche, 
Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers used for the qPCR assays are described 
in Supplementary Table 6.
Cell invasion assay. 
Cell invasion potential was evaluated using a Corning Matrigel Invasion Chamber, 
which consisted of a Matrigel-coated Transwell and Transwell inserts (Corning). The cells (5 ×
 104 cells in 500 μ
l 
of DMEM) were added to the upper chamber, and medium supplemented with 15% FBS was added to the lower 
chamber. The cells were allowed to invade for 72 hours. Non-invasive cells were removed by wiping, and cells that 
had invaded the Matrigel were fixed in 4% paraformaldehye for 5 minutes and subsequently fixed in methanol 
(Wako, Japan) for 20 minutes. The cells were stained with Azure EMB Giemsa (Merck Millipore) and quantita-
tively analyzed under a light microscope at a magnification of 10x.
Combined fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence. 
Combined 
FISH and immunofluorescence assays were conducted according to the manufacturers’ protocols. A Stellaris 
FISH probe (GFP labeled with Quasar 570 dye) “VSMF-1018-5” Biosearch Technologies, Inc., Petaluma, CA) 
was used for the FISH assays. Anti-FSP1 (1:300) (Merck Millipore) was used for the immunofluorescence 
assays.
Flow cytometry. 
To isolate CD44+/CD24low cells, primary cells derived from 3 independent tumor sam-
ples were separately stained with monoclonal anti-CD44 (Miltenyi Biotec), monoclonal anti-CD24 (CD24-PE: 
Miltenyi Biotec), and isotype controls (Rat IgG2b-APC and Rat IgG2b-PE) (Miltenyi Biotec) for 30 minutes on 
ice. The stained cells were analyzed using an Accuri™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo Software 
(Treestar Inc., San Carlos, CA).
