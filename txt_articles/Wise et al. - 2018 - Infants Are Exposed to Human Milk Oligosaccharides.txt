Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are complex carbohydrates that are highly
abundant in and, in their complexity, unique to human milk. Accumulating evidence
indicates that exposure to HMOs in the postnatal period affects immediate as well
as long-term infant health and development. However, studies reported in the 1970s
showed that HMOs already appear in maternal urine and blood during pregnancy and
as early as the first trimester. In this pilot study we aimed to determine whether or
not HMOs also appear in amniotic fluid. We enrolled women during pregnancy and
collected their urine and amniotic fluid at birth as well as their milk 4 days postpartum.
We analyzed the samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass
spectrometry and identified several HMOs including 2′-fucosyllactose, 3-fucosyllactose,
difucosyllactose, and 6′-sialyllactose to be present in different relative abundancies in
all three tissues. This is the first report that HMOs appear in amniotic fluid and that the
fetus is already exposed to HMOs in utero, warranting future research to investigate the
immediate and long-term implications on fetal and infant health and development.

INTRODUCTION
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a group of complex carbohydrates that are highly
abundant in human milk but not in infant formula (1). Most recently, two of the more than
150 HMOs naturally occurring in human milk have been approved for food use in the European
Union and the US and are being added to some infant formula (2–4). Therefore, current research
focuses on the short- and long-term consequences for health and development when infants are
exposed to the complex mixture of HMOs through breastfeeding and individual HMOs through
formula-feeding.
Accumulating evidence demonstrates that HMOs are human milk prebiotics that serve
as metabolic substrates for specific and potentially beneficial microbes (5). HMOs are also
antimicrobials with direct bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects or antiadhesives that mimic
glycocalyx structures on epithelial cell surfaces and serve as soluble decoy receptors to block the
attachment of potentially pathogenic microbes (1, 6, 7). The combined prebiotic, antimicrobial,
and antiadhesive effects of HMOs contribute to shaping the infant gut microbiome early in life,
reducing the risk of acute diseases including infectious diarrhea or necrotizing enterocolitis (8–10),
and potentially also that of non-communicable diseases such as asthma and allergic diseases

Oligosaccharides in Amniotic Fluid
(11, 12), diabetes and obesity (13, 14). In addition, HMOs
also modify immune system maturation and responses—both
dependent and independent of the microbiome (15, 16).
Thus, exposure to HMOs in the post-partum period has both
immediate as well as long-term implications for infant health and
development.
Exposure to HMOs however, may already begin long before
birth. Already in the 1970s, Hallgren et al. applied exchange
chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography and reported
that HMOs appear not only in human milk, but also in the
maternal circulation and urine as early as at the end of the first
trimester (17). Taking these findings and recent demonstration
suggesting that the mother may provide the inoculum of
microbial colonization already in utero (18, 19), we aimed to
determine whether or not HMOs also appear in amniotic fluid,
which had not been studied before, and reach the growing fetus
before birth.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was conducted at the University of California San
Diego and approved by the University’s Institutional Review
Board. We enrolled 48 women during pregnancy with the goal
to collect their urine before delivery, their amniotic fluid during
planned c-section or after spontaneous rupture of membrane,
as well as their milk 4 days after birth. All samples were
collected in sterile cups and stored at −20◦C until analysis.
Out of the enrolled 48 women, eight not only provided urine
and milk, but also amniotic fluid samples that appeared clear
and were free of blood (pink samples) or meconium (turbid
samples). The mean gestational age for these eight subjects
was 39 weeks (minimum: 38 weeks; maximum: 39 weeks
and 5 days). Two of the eight deliveries were c-sections, two
were vaginal delivery. Oligosaccharides from these eight sample
sets were isolated by solid phase extraction chromatography
over C18 and carbograph, labeled with 2-aminobenzamide
(2AB), and analyzed by HPLC with fluorescence detection. In
addition and to obtain a confirmation of HMOs in the sample,
oligosaccharides were partially methylated, premixed with sDHB
matrix, spotted on Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization
(MALDI) plates, and analyzed by MALDI Time-of-Flight (TOF)
(Autoflex, Bruker). The mass spectral data was acquired in
positive, reflectron mode. To obtain structural details on
specific oligosaccharides, samples were dissolved in methanol
containing 1% formic acid and directly injected into a Linear
Trap Quadropol (LTQ)-Orbitrap Discovery mass spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific). The spectral data was collected on positive
mode and selected ions were further fragmented to obtain
ms/ms data.
RESULTS

but also in maternal urine and in amniotic fluid. However,
their relative abundance differs between sample types, suggesting

gland, kidneys, or placenta or differential degradation in or on
the way to the different tissues. For example, 2′-fucosyllactose
(2′FL) is the dominant oligosaccharide in all three sample
types. 3-fucosyllactose (3FL) is more abundant in maternal urine
than in milk and amniotic fluid. Difucosyllactose (DFLac) is
more abundant in milk and urine than in amniotic fluid. 6′-
sialyllactose (6′SL) is more abundant in urine and amniotic
fluid and less in milk. Several other oligosaccharides with higher
retention times and molecular weights can be detected in all
three sample types, but structure elucidation in urine and
amniotic fluid samples was not conclusive due to sensitivity
issues.
DISCUSSION
This is the first report that HMOs appear in amniotic fluid
and that the fetus is already exposed to HMOs in utero. Here,

HMOs may have similar effects to what has been described for
the post-partum period. If amniotic fluid is indeed not sterile
as suggested (5), HMOs may act as prebiotics and contribute
to shaping the amniotic fluid microbiome and set the stage for
the developing infant microbiome post-partum, which may affect
life-long health and disease risk. HMOs in maternal urine and
amniotic fluid may also serve as antimicrobials and antiadhesives
and help fight infections and inflammation, reducing the risk of
chorioamnionitis and preterm delivery.
Unlike glycans that are part of glycoproteins or glycolipids
(20), all HMOs carry lactose at the reducing end (1). Thus,
mass spectrometric analysis can easily distinguish HMOs from
any other non-HMO glycans or glycan fragments, proving
unequivocally HMOs indeed appear in amniotic fluid. While
we can clearly detect HMOs in amniotic fluid, we are not
comfortable reporting absolute concentrations solely based on
our HPLC and MS analysis.
While HMOs appear in maternal urine as early as at the end
of the first trimester (17), our pilot study only analyzed amniotic
fluid collected at birth and was not designed to assess how early
HMOs appear in amniotic fluid. Additional research will be
required to investigate when HMOs start to appear in amniotic
fluid, whether or not the composition changes over time, and how
much the composition varies between women.
Nonetheless, the observation that HMOs appear in amniotic
fluid is novel and warrants future clinical research to identify
associations and cause-and-effect relationships between amniotic
fluid HMO composition and clinical outcome measures, which
may lay the foundation for future applications with the aim to
alter and improve amniotic fluid HMO amount and composition
