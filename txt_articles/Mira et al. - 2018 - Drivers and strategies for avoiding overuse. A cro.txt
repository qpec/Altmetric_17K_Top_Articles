Objectives Identify the sources of overuse from the point 
of view of the Spanish primary care professionals, and 
analyse the frequency of overuse due to pressure from 
patients in addition to the responses when professionals 
face these demands.
Design A cross-sectional study.
setting Primary care in Spain.
Participants A non-randomised sample of 2201 providers 
(general practitioners, paediatricians and nurses) was 
recruited during the survey.
Primary and secondary outcome measures The 
frequency, causes and responsibility for overuse, the 
frequency that patients demand unnecessary tests or 
procedures, the profile of the most demanding patients, 
and arguments for dissuading the patient.
results In all, 936 general practitioners, 682 
paediatricians and 286 nurses replied (response rate 
18.6%). Patient requests (67%) and defensive medicine 
(40%) were the most cited causes of overuse. Five 
hundred and twenty-two (27%) received requests 
from their patients almost every day for unnecessary 
tests or procedures, and 132 (7%) recognised granting 
the requests. The lack of time in consultation, and 
information about new medical advances and treatments 
that patients could find on printed and digital media, 
contributed to the professional’s inability to adequately 
counter this pressure by patients. Clinical safety 
(49.9%) and evidence (39.4%) were the arguments that 
dissuaded patients from their requests the most. Cost 
savings was not a convincing argument (6.8%), above all 
for paediatricians (4.3%). General practitioners resisted 
more pressure from their patients (x2=88.8, P<0.001, 
percentage difference (PD)=17.0), while nurses admitted 
to carrying out more unnecessary procedures (x2=175.7, 
P<0.001, PD=12.3).
Conclusion Satisfying the patient and patient uncertainty 
about what should be done and defensive medicine 
practices explains some of the frequent causes of overuse. 
Safety arguments are useful to dissuade patients from 
their requests.
IntrODuCtIOn 
Among the causes of lack of quality are the 
incorrect use of diagnostic or therapeutic 
resources due to medical errors,1 2 underuse3 
and overuse.4 
Overuse is understood to be the provi-
sion of healthcare when lacking evidence 
or when the potential benefits from the 
procedure or treatment do not outweigh its 
risks.5 Overuse of diagnostic and therapeutic 
resources is present in all specialties, all 
health systems4 6 and at all care levels,7 and it 
represents a threat to patient safety and the 
sustainability of health systems.8 Reducing 
overuse in primary care is particularly rele-
vant when the general practitioner is the 
gatekeeper of the health system. However, in 
many countries the actual pattern of overuse 
remains virtually unknown.9
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► The strengths of the present study include its large 
sample of providers working on an ample number 
of Spanish primary care health organisations. This 
sample included general practitioners, paediatri-
cians and nurses.
 
► Frequency and causes of overuse were analysed be-
side the profile of the most demanding patients, and 
arguments to dissuade the patient.
 
► Although data are derived only from Spain, it is likely 
to be representative of the rest of the health systems 
where general practitioners are the gatekeepers.
 
► The study did not based on a random selection of 
participants. A limited number of males in the cas-
es of paediatrics and nursing were involved even 
though their number is proportional to that of their 
presence within these professional groups. The data 
correspond to a health model funded by taxes.

Causes of overuse
The immediate causes of overuse include10–15 insufficient 
updating of knowledge by professionals, defensive medi-
cine, the custom of doing things that have always been 
done, lack of time in consultation, inadequate incentives, 
influence by the pharmaceutical industry and inadequate 
communication with patients. Patients requesting diag-
nostic tests9 16 17 or treatments based on personal beliefs 
or from information obtained by other patients or from 
the internet9 18 19 have been also identified as a cause of 
overuse.
Patients in primary care usually request diag-
nostic tests, referrals to specialists and medications, 
more frequently antimicrobials and for reducing 
pain.9 20 These requests generate dissatisfaction and 
make professionals uncomfortable21 because they 
call their clinical expertise into question,22 and this 
affects the quality of the relationship with the patient. 
Primary care physicians accept and handle the rela-
tionship with the patient better in the case of requests 
for tests and referrals to specialists than when the 
patient requests certain medications.23 However, they 
often manifest in a desire to fulfil their patients’ expec-
tations, increasing overuse.24 Other drivers of medical 
overuse from a primary care perspective also includes 
the lack of communication skills or medical work 
experience, insufficient time during consultation and 
fear of malpractice.9 24 25
Questions to be answered
There is little research on the role of the patient and 
the professional in overuse, and most of it has been 
carried out in the USA, which has an organisational envi-
ronment different from the models based on a national 
health system.11 The little data there are suggest that 
medical recommendations to reduce overuse are difficult 
to follow and difficult for patients to accept,26 although 
research is needed to discern the profile of patients 
prone to accept or refuse these recommendations. It is 
hoped that the organisational model of the provision 
of healthcare has a direct influence on overuse. In the 
case of models where the primary care physician is the 
gatekeeper, one could expect greater pressure on this 
professional.27
Objectives
This study identified the sources of overuse from the 
point of view of Spanish primary care professionals, 
and analysed the frequency of overuse due to pres-
sure from patients in addition to the responses when 
professionals face these demands. Specifically, this 
study searched for answers to the following questions:
Perceived causes and responsibility of overuse from 
the primary care front-line providers.
Patient profiles and their requests and responses from 
healthcare professionals and how they dissuade pa-
tients.
MethOD
A cross-sectional study was conducted based on an online 
survey directed at a group of primary care professionals 
in Spain: general practitioners, paediatricians and nurses. 
The field study took place between March and July 2017.
setting
In Spain, primary care provides stepped care based on the 
right care at the right place at the right time, balancing 
quality and costs. This system strengthens the gatekeeper 
role of general practitioners (and paediatricians in the 
case of children). They are the ones who make diagnostic 
and therapeutic decisions in every case, which includes 
the possibility of referrals to other specialists at hospitals.
Spanish territory is divided into health districts, and 
in turn, these are divided into health zones. Each zone 
contains a health centre that is responsible for providing 
healthcare for that territorial demarcation, with general 
practitioners, paediatricians and nurses. One health 
district attends to an average of some 250 000 residents. 
The composition of professionals on primary health teams 
varies depending on the population of the health zone 
(ratio around 1300 residents per general practitioner28 
and 1029 residents between the ages of 0 and 14 years per 
paediatrician).29 The number of nurses is similar to that 
of general practitioners and paediatricians.30
Materials
The scope of the survey was based on the instrument 
employed by the ABIM (American Board of Internal 
Medicine) Foundation.11 Seven blocks of questions were 
analysed and 28 questions formulated. Specifically anal-
ysed were the causes and responsibility of unnecessary 
overuse, tests or procedures demanded most by patients, 
the profile of the patient who insists on these requests, the 
frequency of receiving requests and the frequency that 
the professional orders them, the arguments employed 
for dissuading the patient and the extent to which they 
succeed, and the reactions by the patient to the profes-
sional’s refusal. A pilot test on comprehending the ques-
tions was carried out with six professionals whose profiles 
were similar to those who participated in the study. 
Proposals for changes to the wording or response scales 
were incorporated into the final draft of the questions.
Participants
A non-randomised sample of primary care providers was 
surveyed. To carry out this survey on a population of 
63 753 professionals (28 294 general practitioners, 6251 
paediatricians and 29 208 nurses), a minimal sample of 
2201 professionals from all groups (general practitioners, 
paediatricians and nurses) was determined, considering 
a 1% error, a confidence level of 95%, p=q=0.50 and a 
response rate of 20%.
The field study was conducted in collaboration with the 
health services of Andalucía, Aragón, Madrid, Navarra, 
and the Comunidad Valenciana, the Spanish Associa-
tion of Primary Care Paediatrics, the Spanish Society of

Outpatient and Primary Care Paediatrics, the Illustrious 
Official College of Physicians of Valencia, the Council of 
Nursing of the Valencian Community, and the Spanish 
Society of General and Family Practitioners. These organ-
isations invited their associates to participate in this study, 
and sent a total of 12 787 emails (88% of the emails were 
expected to be opened). They explained the study’s 
scope to each group of primary caregivers, its volun-
tary nature and the guarantees for the confidentiality of 
their responses, instructions on how to respond; it also 
provided a link to a Google Forms page where they could 
respond. A reminder to motivate responses was given.
non-eligible participants
The responses from professionals who indicated that 
they worked at hospitals or other centres different 
from primary care were excluded. Also, participants 
were excluded when three or more questions were not 
answered. Incomplete questionnaires were not consid-
ered during the statistical analysis.
Patient and public involvement
Patients and public were not involved in this study.
Potential sources of bias
The reasons why some professionals answered the survey 
and others did not could affect the meaning of their 
answers. A sampling error of 1% was defined to reduce 
its effect.
statistical methods
The answers by physicians, paediatricians and nurses 
were compared. Professional experience and gender 
were used to compare the responses of each group and 
to assess their trends. The opinions of these professionals 
working in the public or private sectors were compared.
Data analysis was completed using descriptive and infer-
ential descriptive statistics, with χ2 and analysis of variance 
to establish relationships between qualitative variables, 
and between qualitative and quantitative variables, 
respectively. The overuse experience was distinguished 
by different types of providers. The null hypothesis was 
rejected when P<0.05.
results
In all, 2098 professionals provided complete responses 
(response rate 18.6%), achieving 95.3% of the expected 
responses. Of these, 194 indicated they were working 
in hospitals, so the responses from 1904 professionals 
(936 general practitioners, 682 paediatricians and 286 
nurses) (table 1) were coded and analysed. Most of 
these, 1190 (62.5%), were recruited by invitation from 
professional societies, and 714 (37.5%) were invited by 
their health services. There were 1816 (95.4%) working 
at health centres from the Spanish public health system, 
with the remainder either working in private health 
or practising in both professional fields. Three-quar-
ters of the sample (n=1432, 75.2%) had more than 15 
years of professional experience. Men in paediatrics 
and nursing, in addition to the professionals from the 
private sector, were under-represented in a manner 
similar to their proportion in the make-up of primary 
care in Spain.30
Causes of overuse
The reasons that general practitioners and paediatri-
cians gave as being more directly responsible for inap-
propriate overuse were patient (or guardian) insistence 
and the need to attain greater safety or control over the 
process (table 2). Male general practitioners, compared 
with their female counterparts, showed a greater 
tendency to justify inappropriate overuse on the grounds 
of satisfying the patient (x2=5.2, P=0.024, percentage 
difference (PD)=6.1). As causes of overuse, less experi-
enced general practitioners indicated following regula-
tions (x2=14.4, P=0.002, PD=19.1), making the patient 
feel satisfied with the care received (x2=11.0, P=0.011,

PD=21.2) and avoiding possible claims (x2=8.6, P=0.035, 
PD=14.8). When comparing the opinions of general 
practitioners who only worked within the public sector 
with those who worked in both public and private, it 
was observed that the former tended to consider the 
lack of time in consultation as a reason for overuse 
more frequently (x2=13.1, P=0.001, PD=27.8). However, 
for the latter (with activities in both the public and 
private systems), avoiding a claim by patients was 
more important (x2=21.2, P=0.001, PD=27.9), and they 
more frequently considered that the practice guides 
they used as reference were obsolete (x2=6.8, P=0.009, 
PD=6.6). Paediatricians who combined activities in both 
sectors reported more frequently on the difficulties of 
dissuading the guardian and making him/her see that 
the procedures requested for the child were unneces-
sary (x2=4.6, P=0.037, PD=13.8). General practitioners 
(x2=11.8, P=0.001, PD=25.0) and paediatricians (x2=5.9, 
P=0.018, PD=18.7) who only worked in the public sector 
felt more pressured by patients than those who prac-
tised in both sectors.
responsibility for overuse
The responsibility for overuse was assigned to, in order, 
the patients’ relatives, the mass media, the professionals 
themselves, health pages on the internet and defen-
sive medicine practices (table 3). Male professionals 
attributed the responsibility for overuse of resources due 
to pressure by patients more directly on health service 
senior management (F=4.3, P=0.038, 95% CI –0.01 to 
0.53). Those solely working in the public health system 
(as opposed to those who also worked in private practice) 
held the media (F=6.4, P=0.011, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.52) and 
patients’ relatives (F=4.5, P=0.03, 95% CI –0.07 to 1.06) 
more directly accountable. No cross-effects from the 
interaction of these variables were observed.
Pressure by patients and responses from professionals
Only 31 (1.6%) of those surveyed said that they had 
not received any requests from patients (more frequent 
among professionals with more than 15 years of experi-
ence), while 103 (5.4%) said that they received requests 
like these from patients every day (normally younger 
professionals). General practitioners were those who 
claimed to be under greater pressure to carry out unnec-
essary tests or procedures (x2=88.8, P<0.001, PD=17.0). 
However, it was the nurses who admitted to carrying out 
these types of unnecessary procedures more frequently; 
paediatrics did so the least (x2=175.7, P<0.001, PD=12.3) 
(table 4).
The physicians who reported receiving requests from 
patients for unnecessary tests or procedures more 
frequently were those who acknowledged either ordering 
tests (every day or almost every day) for them or carrying 
out unnecessary procedures themselves for patients 
(x2=419.0, P<0.001, PD=16.8). They also stated that the 
reaction by the patient (or guardian) when a request 
for tests or procedures was denied was more negative or 
aggressive (x2=247.7, P<0.001, PD=20.1).
Male nurses, compared with their female counter-
parts, reported greater pressure from patients to carry 
out unnecessary procedures (x2=14.8, P=0.005, PD=12.7) 
and, compared with the female nurses, carried out these 
unnecessary procedures more frequently (x2=14.1, 
P=0.007, PD=10.2). The ability to dissuade patient 
requests was similar in men and women in all three 
professional profiles. However, male nurses, compared 
with female, reported receiving an aggressive response 
more frequently (x2=13.6, P=0.009, PD=11.1).
Paediatricians with less than 5 years of experience 
reported receiving requests for unnecessary tests or 
procedures most frequently (x2=52.6, P<0.001, PD=21.3). 
Paediatricians who had practised fewer years stated that

when refusing a patient’s request, the patient’s reac-
tion was frequently more negative or even aggressive 
in comparison to their more experienced colleagues 
(x2=68.4, P<0.001, PD=6.5).
What patients request
The most frequent requests from patients were for routine 
analytical examinations, referrals to specialists, antimi-
crobial treatments, radiological studies and requests 
for healing materials without indication (table 5). The 
profile of the patient who requested unnecessary nursing 
procedures the most corresponded to that of a woman 
(145, 50.7%) over 66 years of age (158, 55.2%) who 
suffered various chronic conditions (154, 53.8%). In the 
case of general practitioners, these were usually women 
(604, 64.5%) between 51 years and 65 years of age (411, 
43.9%) with a low prevalence pathology (296, 31.6%) or 
one that was unspecified (219, 23.4%) and who consulted 
the internet about their concerns (172, 18.4%). In paedi-
atrics, the profile of the guardian who most persistently 
requested unnecessary tests or procedures corresponded 
to the mother of a patient (480, 70.4%) who suffered 
an unspecified pathology (367, 53.8%) and who usually 
sought information on health web pages (130, 19.1%).
Ideas that work to dissuade the patient
According to the majority of those surveyed, the argu-
ments that worked best for dissuading the patient or 
guardian that the request was inadequate were clinical 
reasons and patient safety (table 6). The safety of the 
child (x2=31.7, P<0.001, PD=8.5) and avoiding discomfort 
to the child (x2=57.7, P<0.001, PD=10.0) were considered 
more effective arguments above all for paediatricians. 
Cost savings was the least effective argument for paedi-
atricians (x2=43.9, P<0.001, PD=6.9), while avoiding 
patient discomfort was least effective for general practi-
tioners (x2=57.7, P<0.001). For more experienced paedia-
tricians (x2=30.6, P=0.002, PD=17.0) and nurses (x2=23.6, 
P=0.023, PD=28.8), arguing clinical reasons to dissuade 
the patient or guardian’s request worked better.
Paediatricians were more successful than general prac-
titioners and nurses at dissuading their patients that the 
requested test or procedure was unnecessary or that 
it posed unnecessary risk (x2=45.0, P<0.001, PD=5.4). 
Nurses reported more frequently that the patient’s reac-
tion to a request being refused due to being unnecessary 
was either negative or aggressive (x2=129.5, P<0.001, 
PD=14.4). Men and women from all three professional 
profiles expressed a similar ability for dissuading a 
patient’s request. Less experienced paediatricians stated 
they were able to dissuade patients more frequently than 
other paediatricians (x2=23.9, P=0.021, PD=12.4).
Patients who requested healing materials to take home 
(24/48, x2=15.2, P=0.004, PD=14.4), vaccinations outside 
the vaccine calendar (11/34, x2=10.1, P=0.039, PD=14.5) 
and antibiotic treatments (31/491, x2=33.4, P<0.001, 
PD=4.2) were those who, in the opinion of the profes-
sionals surveyed, were least willing to accept explanations 
and refusals by the professionals for their request.
According to 1231 (64.7%) of those surveyed, an educa-
tional campaign directed at the population would help 
reduce the number of requests for unnecessary tests and 
procedures by patients. Such a campaign was seen as most

DIsCussIOn
The results of this study confirm the role that patients’ 
requests and defensive medicine play in overuse. In this 
study, health professionals reported greater pressure 
from female patients and patients who suffer an unspeci-
fied or yet-undiagnosed pathology. For the former group, 
and in order to interpret this result, it needs to be taken 
into consideration that in many European countries 
women frequently accompany the patient to the consul-
tation (adult or minor).31 As for the latter case, one 
needs to consider that in addition to the fears the patient 
experiences due to the uncertainty of not knowing what 
is happening to him/her, there is added pressure from 
family members, the effect from consulting health news 
on the internet, and news from the printed and digital 
media about medical advances and new techniques.
In this case, it has been proven that overuse also has 
roots in the insecurity that an ill-defined pathology instils 
within the professional, the fear of an uncertain outcome 
for the indicated treatment, as well as the potential effects 
from a subsequent complaint by the patient or a lawsuit 
filed in a court of law. The lack of a diagnosis, the lack of 
time in consultation, and the need for greater security in 
the diagnosis are another of the main causes of overuse.31 
Curiously enough, these results show that as requests 
from patients become more insistent, for example, vacci-
nating a minor outside the vaccine calendar, an antibiotic 
when it is contraindicated or giving healing materials to 
the patient so he/she can take them home, the response 
from these patients is more negative. Both of these results 
could support the opinions of those surveyed about the 
usefulness of carrying out an educational campaign 
among the population32 and the measures that have been 
adopted to prevent aggression towards professionals.
Previous research had found that, when compared 
with other specialties, general practitioners were under 
greater pressure by their patients for unnecessary medical

tests or procedures to be carried out on them.33 The fact 
that patients in primary care exert greater pressure than 
in hospitals is observed in both organisational models of 
payment for medical acts as well as in systems where the 
physician is the gatekeeper.27 33 34 These results should 
be interpreted keeping in mind the assessment patients 
give about care levels in every country and the belief that 
super specialisation might be a key to quality medicine.
The frequency of requests for medical tests or proce-
dures in the study by Zambrana and Lozano35 in Spanish 
hospitals exceeded the frequency of requests that physi-
cians in American hospitals reported by 16 percentage 
points. In this study in primary care, the frequency that 
general practitioners said they receive requests from 
their patients was 38 percentage points higher than 
what American physicians reported (78% vs 40%). The

tendency of published figures of overuse from organ-
isational models of primary care similar to that of the 
Spanish model27 point to a similar direction, and suggests 
the gatekeepers need support to prevent (or at least 
reduce) overuse. Moreover, this debate remains open 
because other studies conducted in the USA34 indicate 
that overuse in the wake of patient requests is similar at 
health centres in both wealthy areas and areas with lower 
income levels.
This study’s findings reveal that as perceived pressure 
from patients becomes more insistent, the professionals 
either order or carry out a greater number of unneces-
sary tests and procedures, extending the initial observa-
tions that general practitioners tend to accept requests 
from their patients more so than other specialists.34 
General practitioners perceive more pressure from their 
patients than paediatricians or nurses, although the latter 
are those who carry out unnecessary procedures more 
frequently, probably because this group acknowledges 
being on the receiving end of more aggressive responses 
from patients when turning down requests. Nevertheless, 
these results should be qualified based on the request 
the patient makes and by the dissemination of practice 
guides between professionals. It is unlikely that ordering 
a test such as the prostate-specific antigen test (PSA) in 
an asymptomatic male patient who insists so he can ‘rest 
easy’ is the same as initiating a totally contraindicated 
treatment and one that poses immediate risks for the 
patient. Most physicians accept the first situation more 
easily,36 but resist the second.23 31
Although professionals are directly responsible for 
overuse, and this and other research recognise this as 
such,27 33 we must also consider the role that patient asso-
ciations, accreditation systems of websites and associations 
of health news informers could play a role to succeed, 
among everybody, in reducing overuse figures. Ignorance 
on behalf of the population has been analysed in other 
research, especially that regarding the use of therapies 
and requests for diagnostic imaging tests irrespective of 
the risk from the ionising radiation involved.37
Information does not always contribute to fulfil these 
recommendations.26 However, providing the patient 
with clear and direct information about the clinical and 
safety reasons that advise against carrying out certain tests 
or starting certain treatments contributes to reducing 
overuse.38 39 These results follow this line and confirm find-
ings from research conducted in other countries where 
primary care physicians draw on evidence to dissuade a 
patient’s request for a certain diagnostic test when they 
deem it unnecessary.23 The other argument that has also 
demonstrated its usefulness for dissuading the patient 
is safety, above all for paediatricians. Considering the 
Spanish study with hospital physicians,35 the effectiveness 
of general practitioners and paediatricians in dissuading 
patients is similar to that of their colleagues at hospitals. 
The paediatricians in this study did not report a dissuasive 
capacity any different from that of their colleagues who 
care for adults.
Professionals who fail to dissuade patients from their 
requests feel as if they are under great pressure and end up 
carrying out more unnecessary tests and procedures, and 
they also perceive more aggressive responses from their 
patients when refusing to carry out any of their requests. 
Although we do know that the lack of time in consultation 
has a negative effect on clinical safety,32 these data do not 
permit us to determine whether the ability to dissuade 
patients from their requests might be different if more 
time were dedicated per patient. For a significant portion 
of physicians, and for those surveyed in this study as well, 
maintaining a positive relationship with the patient was 
essential,25 27 probably because it is one of the basic ther-
apeutic resources in primary care.40 Not responding to 
a request or not knowing how to dissuade the patient 
muddies the relationship. Furthermore, when the patient 
questions the physician’s clinical expertise, their relation-
ship worsens and defensive medicine tends to increase.4 8
The frequency of overuse resulting from movements 
grouped together under the ‘Less is More Medicine’ 
label41 has begun to be studied systematically, and 
various campaigns have been launched to raise aware-
ness in professionals about what must not be done,42–44 
but studies analysing the roles of patients and profes-
sionals in overuse and the impact from campaigns to 
reduce overuse directed at the population are still scarce. 
Furthermore, campaigns for reducing overuse in the 
style of Choosing Wisely44 confirm the need to influence 
health education, and are directed especially at drawing 
attention to the risks from interpreting health websites 
without the appropriate information, like, for example, 
considering their latest update, sources of information, 
and the commitment to the quality of their contents,45 
and reducing the negative impact that these sources of 
information are beginning to have on the relationship 
between patients and professionals.14 46 This is also true in 
the case of publicly financed health systems, to carry out 
campaigns to fortify solidarity behaviour and to properly 
use diagnostic and therapeutic resources.
Practical implications
These results have direct implications on the professional 
level. First, fostering training in communication skills, 
highlighting how to approach communication with a 
patient who applies pressure to receive an unnecessary 
and/or harmful test or treatment for him or herself. For 
example, by promoting the so-called web prescription 
by recommending safe sites to patients where they can 
become informed, an aspect in which Spain lags some-
what behind.46 Second, establishing a framework of 
greater legal security for professionals who act in accor-
dance with practice guides. Third, identifying if Do not 
Do has a higher chance to produce an adverse event 
to define it as a target in a public campaign to reduce 
patients' requests.
On the health organisation level, these results reinforce 
the need to establish the implementation in primary care 
of up-to-date practice guides and to establish alerts and

assistance algorithms (including safety arguments for 
patients) on the ordering of tests, referrals and prescrip-
tions for limiting overuse. The lessons learnt using deci-
sion aids to reduce more aggressive choices could be 
applied to design these algorithms.47 Management indi-
cators and annual or biennial targets could include indi-
cators related to overuse, especially in those cases where, 
furthermore, the risk to patient safety increases.
Generalisability
These results and recommendations could be applied 
to the healthcare systems where the general practi-
tioners (or paediatricians in the case of children) are the 
gatekeepers.
limitations
This study was based on a non-random selection of 
participants. This sample included approximately 3% 
of the general practitioners, 11% of the paediatricians 
and 1% of the nurses in terms of the total of healthcare 
professionals in Spanish primary care in 2016. Studies 
using email and electronic questionnaires are frequent; 
however, some professionals might have considered that 
these systems would not guarantee their privacy and so 
decided not to answer. The willingness to respond could 
bias the sample selection, and in some other cases physi-
cians or nurses might not admit to overuse. Although the 
public sector is over-represented, this over-representation 
is also observed in the reference population. The limited 
number of men who answered in the cases of paediatrics 
and nursing limits the strengths of the comparisons, even 
though their number is proportional to that of their pres-
ence within these professional groups. The data corre-
spond to a health model funded by taxes. Although the 
questionnaire was used in a previous study,12 it has not 
been previously validated. This quantitative approach 
should be complemented with qualitative studies 
exploring experiences and coping styles to avoid overuse.
Outlook
Overuse is a challenge for health systems, particularly 
those where the general practitioner is the system gate-
keeper, and it requires responses from both the clinical as 
well as economic points of view.
