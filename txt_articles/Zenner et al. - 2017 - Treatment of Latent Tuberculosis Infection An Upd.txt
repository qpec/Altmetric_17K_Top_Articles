Background: Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is
an important component of tuberculosis (TB) control, and this
study updates a previous network meta-analysis of the best LTBI
treatment options to inform public health action and program-
matic management of LTBI.
Purpose: To evaluate the comparative efficacy and harms of
LTBI treatment regimens aimed at preventing active TB among
adults and children.
Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from in-
dexing to 8 May 2017; clinical trial registries; and conference
abstracts. No language restrictions were applied.
Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials that evaluated
human LTBI treatments and recorded at least 1 of 2 prespecified
end points (hepatotoxicity and prevention of active TB).
Data Extraction: 2 investigators independently extracted data
from eligible studies and assessed study quality according to a
standard protocol.
Data Synthesis: The network meta-analysis of 8 new and 53
previously included studies showed that isoniazid regimens of 6
months (odds ratio [OR], 0.65 [95% credible interval {CrI}, 0.50
to 0.83]) or 12 to 72 months (OR, 0.50 [CrI, 0.41 to 0.62]),
rifampicin-only regimens (OR, 0.41 [CrI, 0.19 to 0.85]), rifampicin-
isoniazid regimens of 3 to 4 months (OR, 0.53 [CrI, 0.36 to 0.78]),
rifampicin-isoniazid-pyrazinamide regimens (OR, 0.35 [CrI, 0.19
to 0.61]), and rifampicin-pyrazinamide regimens (OR, 0.53 [CrI,
0.33 to 0.84]) were efficacious compared with placebo. Evidence
existed for efficacy of weekly rifapentine-isoniazid regimens
compared with no treatment (OR, 0.36 [CrI, 0.18 to 0.73]). No
conclusive evidence showed that HIV status altered treatment
efficacy.
Limitation: Evidence was sparse for many comparisons and
hepatotoxicity outcomes, and risk of bias was high or unknown
for many studies.
Conclusion: Evidence exists for the efficacy and safety of
6-month isoniazid monotherapy, rifampicin monotherapy, and
combination therapies with 3 to 4 months of isoniazid and
rifampicin.

T
uberculosis (TB) is a global priority infectious dis-
ease that caused an estimated 1.4 million deaths in
2015 (1). Many strategies are required to reach the
United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of end-
ing the global TB epidemic by 2030 (2); tackling latent
TB infection (LTBI), including providing preventive
treatment to persons at high risk for TB, is a key action
in achieving both the Sustainable Development Goal
and the targets of the World Health Organization's End
TB Strategy (3).
Many treatment regimens for LTBI are available
globally; 5 are recommended by the World Health Or-
ganization (4), and 4 of these by the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (5). Evidence on the effi-
cacy of shorter regimens with a reduced pill burden is
evolving, but more information on effectiveness is still
urgently needed (6).
We previously published a network meta-analysis
(NMA) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that
identified the most effective and least harmful preven-
tive treatment regimens (7). The results of this meta-
analysis and Bayesian network analysis served as the
evidence base for the World Health Organization's
2014 LTBI guidelines (4, 8). As part of the European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's decision to
provide new guidance on programmatic LTBI control in
the European Union/European Economic Area and
candidate countries, we identified the need to update
our 2014 review (9). The results are presented in this
report.
METHODS
To ensure consistency, we used the same method-
ology as in our previous study (7). We summarize this
approach below. We registered this study in the
PROSPERO database (CRD42016037871).
Data Sources and Searches
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and gray litera-
ture were searched until 8 May 2017 with no language
restrictions. We reviewed and included our previous
search and added all relevant articles, focusing on the
time after the previous search (Supplement, available
at Annals.org).
Study Selection and Extraction
We used the same selection criteria as before and
included RCTs that analyzed LTBI treatments. We

 excluded nonrandomized, observational, and animal
studies and those that had insufficient information on
one or both of our main end points (hepatotoxicity and
development of active TB). As in our previous study, 2
of 5 potential reviewers (D.Z., N.B., H.R.S., M.C.L., and
M.v.d.W.) independently screened titles, abstracts, and
full-text articles and resolved discrepancies by consen-
sus or, if needed, by consultation with a third reviewer.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two reviewers (D.Z. and N.B.) independently ex-
tracted data to a standardized template, which in-
cluded details of the study, population, follow-up, treat-
ment regimens, and outcomes of interest. Study quality
was assessed by the same 2 reviewers using Higgins
and colleagues' quality assessment tool (10). Disagree-
ments were resolved in consultation with a third re-
viewer (M.v.d.W.).
Data Synthesis and Analysis
We compared both of the main outcomes, active
TB prevention and hepatotoxicity, using conventional
random-effects meta-analysis and an NMA approach.
Analyses included grouping and stratifying treatment
regimens and estimating differences in treatment ef-
fects between groups using ratios of odds ratios (RORs)
according to study-level variables, as described by
Stagg and colleagues (Supplement) (7). Predefined
stratified analyses required study populations to be
grouped by HIV status (HIV-positive, non–HIV-positive
[including
low-proportion
HIV-positive,
defined
as
≤5%], or not stated), age (adults vs. children), immuno-
suppression status (as a result of HIV infection or other
conditions), and TB incidence when and where the RCT
was done (high vs. low). The robustness of the HIV strat-
ification was also tested by sensitivity analysis using a
stricter definition of non–HIV-positive status (only stud-
ies where being HIV-positive was an exclusion criterion
and those from before 1990, when endemic levels
were low) (11).
Study and review quality were also analyzed as pre-
viously. We assessed the effect of study quality do-
mains (such as blinding, allocation concealment, ran-
domization, and outcome assessment) on estimated
treatment efficacy by estimating RORs between studies
with adequate domains and those with inadequate or
unclear domains. Publication bias was similarly as-
sessed to determine whether average SEs of log odds
ratios for each study were associated with a difference
in estimated treatment efficacy. We examined network
consistency by informally comparing estimated treat-
ment effects from NMA with those from standard pair-
wise meta-analysis and by comparing deviance infor-
mation
criterion
statistics
for
the
NMA
using
an
inconsistency model. In this model, the difference be-
tween comparisons is unconstrained, rather than the
usual NMA assumption of consistent treatment effects
for different comparisons.
We used STATA, version 13 (StataCorp), for data
processing and classical analysis and WinBUGS, version
1.4.3 (Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit of
the University of Cambridge), for the Bayesian NMA.
Most figures were also produced with STATA, except
flow charts, for which we used PowerPoint for Mac
(Microsoft).

RESULTS
We identified 1576 articles in the database search,
and of these, 1434 were left after deduplication (Sup-
plement Figure 1; all supplement tables and figures are
available at Annals.org). Eight articles were selected
and used to update or add to the 53 studies included in
the original review (Supplement Table 1). Two of the
added reports provided data from studies that had
been included in the original review (12, 13). Saman-
dari and colleagues' 2015 article (12) overlapped with
their 2011 article (14); the former was used to provide
an update for the outcome of development to active TB
but did not report any additional hepatotoxicity results.
Sterling and associates' 2016 article (13) provided an
update solely for the persons living with HIV included in
their original 2011 article (15). In the interest of analytic
power, we thus retained the earlier study for the overall
analysis but used the later study for the HIV-stratified
analysis. Danel and colleagues (16) included 4 groups,
2 comparing patients with deferred antiretroviral ther-
apy (ART) and 2 comparing patients with early ART ini-
tiation. We extracted and analyzed data separately for
both groups. Two additional trials were initially consid-
ered but then excluded from our analysis. Hosseinipour
and associates (17) compared preventive with active TB
treatments in an HIV-positive population (not compara-
ble to our eligible studies), and Torre-Cisneros and col-
leagues (18) compared levofloxacin with an isoniazid
(INH) preventive treatment regimen in transplant recip-
ients. The trial was stopped early for toxicity events and
did not yield interpretable efficacy or toxicity data due
to heterogeneity among the groups, among other
reasons.
Four of the new articles contained extractable data
on hepatotoxicity (12, 16, 19, 20), and all 8 on develop-
ment of active TB (12, 13, 16, 19–23). Of the 8 reports,
6 were done in countries with high incidence of TB (12,
16, 19, 21–23) and 6 were done solely in persons living
with HIV (12, 13, 16, 19–21). All new studies included
INH monotherapy in at least 1 group; in addition, 1
included INH-rifapentine (RPT) (13), 1 included INH-
ethambutol (EMB) (23), and 1 included both INH-
rifampicin (RMP) and INH-pyrazinamide (PZA) (20)
(Supplement Table 2). Sixteen regimens were thus in-
cluded in the evidence network, 1 more (INH-EMB for
12 months) than in the previous review (Table 1 and
Figures 1 and 2).
Study Quality
Many newly included studies had high or unknown
risk of bias (Supplement Table 3). However, as previ-
ously, all indicators for high risk of bias were associated
with only weak evidence for modification of treatment

 efficacy; for instance, inadequate or unclear allocation
concealment had an ROR of 0.74 (95% credible interval
[CrI], 0.31 to 1.42). Similar results were seen for high or
unclear risk of bias due to inadequate randomization
and blinding, which is consistent with other studies
(24). The ROR for incomplete or unclear versus ade-
quate outcome reporting was 0.91 (CrI, 0.42 to 1.43),
and for selective reporting, 1.03 (CrI, 0.55 to 1.75).
Results for hepatotoxicity were highly uncertain for
all domains due to the sparsity of data, and no firm
evidence enabled us to confirm or reject any modifica-
tion of treatment effects according to study quality
domains.
Prevention of Active TB
An assessment of 16 regimens found that INH reg-
imens of 6 months or 12 to 72 months; RMP-only regi-
mens; RMP-INH regimens of 3 to 4 months; and RMP-
INH-PZA, RMP-PZA, and INH-EMB regimens of 12
months were efficacious (P < 0.05). Table 1 shows esti-
mated odds ratios (ORs) for each regimen versus pla-
cebo and no treatment under the NMA model. The
INH-EMB 12-month regimen showed the greatest ef-
fect but with substantial uncertainty (OR vs. placebo,
0.20 [CrI, 0.04 to 0.82]), and the shorter INH-EMB reg-
imen showed no evidence of efficacy. Two INH-
rifabutin (RFB) regimens, which used different doses of
RFB, showed ORs (vs. placebo) of 0.30 but with sub-
stantial uncertainty. The RMP-INH-PZA regimen showed
a two-thirds reduction in active TB and was strongly
statistically significant (OR vs. placebo, 0.35 [CrI, 0.19 to
0.61]). In addition, the use of RMP or RMP-INH for 3 or
4 months seemed to be efficacious, with reductions in
active TB of half or more, although these results are
based on limited data. The ORs for all lengths of INH
regimens had overlapping CrIs and varying levels of
uncertainty, with the most robust evidence for 6 or
more than 12 months and the greatest efficacy for 12
months or more. Treatment rankings, although not pro-
viding quantified differences in treatment efficacy, are
also useful in understanding uncertainty in the evi-
dence base. For instance, the INH-EMB 12-month reg-
imen had the highest median rank, but its CrI (rank 1 to
11) also included some of the lowest ranks. The INH
regimen of 12 months or more had more certainty but
was ruled out of being one of the best treatments, and
several other regimens (RFB-INH, RMP, and RMP-INH-
PZA) had CrIs that included rank 1. Treatment rankings
are shown in Table 1, and histograms of rankings are in
Supplement Figure 2 and Supplement Table 4.
Stratifying the results on the basis of HIV status
showed no statistically significant differences in effect
estimates for each regimen or the overall pattern of
results when studies in exclusively HIV-positive popula-
tions (24 studies) were compared with those in non–
HIV-positive or unspecified populations (28 studies)
(Supplement Table 4). The estimated ROR for the over-
all difference in treatment efficacy (1.45 [CrI, 0.89 to
2.31]) indicates an inconclusive but potentially weaker
efficacy for treatment versus placebo or no treatment in
HIV-positive patients. The SD of the random effect for
treatment modification was 0.164 (CrI, 0.007 to 0.957),
indicating reasonable consistency across regimens for
differences in treatment efficacy, albeit with wide CrIs.
Inclusion of high versus low TB incidence in the
country of study as a covariate reduced between-study
variability; treatment was generally less efficacious in
high-incidence populations (ROR, 1.58 [CrI, 1.01 to
2.48]). Subgroup analysis by year and age also resulted
in little change in treatment rankings. Using covariate
models, we saw lower treatment effects in more recent
years, although the evidence for this was fairly weak
(ROR for 1992 to 2004 vs. pre-1992, 1.58 [CrI, 0.82 to
2.82], and for 2005 onward vs. pre-1992, 1.34 [CrI, 0.59
to 2.38]). No evidence indicated a relationship between
adherence and efficacy (ROR per 10% decrease, 0.94
[CrI, 0.54 to 1.30]). Restricting analysis to culture-
confirmed TB cases did not alter our conclusions.
Comparing results derived from a random-effects
pairwise meta-analysis with corresponding estimates
from the NMA model revealed some differences in OR
estimates between the models (Figure 2; Supplement
Table 5 and Supplement Figure 3). Many treatment

 comparisons showed a stronger beneficial effect in a
standard pairwise meta-analysis than in an NMA; how-
ever, the differences had P values greater than 0.05
and were found predominantly where the effect esti-
mates from pairwise meta-analysis were imprecise.
Hepatotoxicity
Because of the limited data on hepatotoxicity, we
present results from the direct comparisons. Hepato-
toxicity results from the NMA are shown in Table 2.
Estimates were largely consistent with the direct com-
parisons (Supplement Table 3, 4, and 6). Twenty pair-
wise comparisons were available. Results from the
standard meta-analysis suggest that the RMP-only and
RPT-INH regimens had lower rates of hepatotoxicity
than an INH-only regimen of 6, 9, or 12 to 72 months
(Supplement Table 7 and Supplement Figure 3). RMP-
INH regimens also had lower hepatotoxicity than the
INH-only regimen, although evidence for this was good
only when compared with INH regimens of 12 to 72
months. We found good evidence that regimens con-
taining PZA had higher hepatotoxicity compared with 6
months of INH or 12 weeks of RPT-INH. No data were
available on the hepatotoxicity of the RFB-INH and INH-
EMB regimens. Stratifying the results on the basis of
immunosuppression, HIV status, and TB incidence did
not affect our conclusions.
Inconsistency
Comparing inconsistency models with consistency
models found no evidence that the additional complex-
ity of the former was required (Supplement Figure 4).
However, because this study used a full random-effects
model and the data exhibited a moderate level of
between-study heterogeneity, the power to detect in-
consistency was low and this result cannot be inter-
preted as conclusive evidence of network consistency.
Results from 4 studies, including that of Ma and col-
leagues (23), were extreme in comparison with other
studies, but these data points fitted poorly in both the
NMA and the inconsistency model, indicating extreme
heterogeneity rather than nontransitivity.
Publication Bias
In a pairwise meta-analysis, no evidence suggested
that treatment effects had been exaggerated in smaller
studies (a proxy for publication bias) in any of the com-
parisons (Harbord test P ≥ 0.300). In NMA, the covari-
ate effect for study SE indicated that estimated treat-
ment effects tended to show a greater benefit in
smaller, less precise studies, although this result was
not statistically significant (ROR per 0.2-change in SE,
0.83 [CrI, 0.66 to 1.04]) (Supplement Figure 5).

 DISCUSSION
We present the results of an updated review and
meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and toxicity of
treatment regimens for LTBI (7). This review confirms
that all currently recommended regimens (4) are safe
and efficacious and provides more robust evidence to
demonstrate the efficacy of rifamycin-containing regi-
mens, including 3- to 4-month RMP monotherapy, to
prevent active TB. Although we also included a new
study on the efficacy of INH-EMB combination therapy,
no TB cases were seen in the groups receiving INH or
INH-EMB, so this small study did not add statistically
significant evidence to the network. We did not find
statistically significant differences in treatment efficacy
between regimens in HIV-positive and HIV-negative pa-
tients, although efficacy may have been weaker in HIV-
positive populations. Studies in HIV-positive popula-
tions have been done only recently and are therefore

for each pair of treatments in turn. The resulting estimates are then compared with those obtained from the NMA analysis, which incorporates
indirect evidence and the overall network structure in addition to the direct evidence. EMB = ethambutol; INH = isoniazid; NMA = network
meta-analysis; PZA = pyrazinamide; RFB = rifabutin; RMP = rifampicin; RPT = rifapentine.

 highly correlated with year of publication; more recent
studies were also associated with a modest decrease in
treatment efficacy, so some confounding may exist.
In addition to a regimen's efficacy, toxicity, and risk
for adverse events, 3 other key factors should be con-
sidered when making recommendations in clinical
practice: cost, length of treatment, and pill burden. A
recent systematic review showed that shorter regimens
were associated with higher treatment completion
rates (25). The relatively brief 3-month RPT-based regi-
men, with only 12 doses, has obvious advantages in
shortened treatment length. Publications focusing on a
general population (15), HIV-infected persons (13), and
children and adolescents (26) have demonstrated
good efficacy and safety. Unfortunately, because these
publications derive from the same core study, they add
limited evidence to our network.
Few other systematic reviews on this topic have
been published recently. Our search revealed 2 articles
in which LTBI treatment efficacy and toxicity were part
of a wider review (27, 28) and 3 that focused on specific
populations, 2 on children (29, 30) and 1 on HIV-
infected adults (31). The study collection in these re-
views was more restricted than ours, but the results of
all studies are compatible with ours.
Our search also revealed 2 ongoing registered tri-
als. One of these (NCT02651259), which aims to evalu-
ate the pharmacokinetics, acceptability, and safety of
the RPT-INH regimen in pregnant and postpartum
women, is expected to complete recruitment in De-
cember 2018 (32). The other (NCT02980016) is a prag-
matic trial that investigates incidence and treatment
completion rates in an HIV-positive population, com-
paring a single RPT-INH course with a 6-month INH reg-
imen and with a periodic RPT-INH regimen (33). This
trial is scheduled to complete recruitment in June
2019. Both trials look at important aspects of RPT-
based regimens and support the much-needed devel-
opment of shorter LTBI treatment regimens with less
frequent doses.
Our study presents 2 parallel forms of meta-
analysis. Effect estimates can sometimes show greater
benefit in pairwise comparisons than in NMA, with the
latter constraining treatment effects to be consistent
across comparisons. Although the difference was not
statistically significant, it is possible that treatment ef-
fects reported in our pairwise results could be slightly
overestimated.
The main limitation of our work is the underlying
studies, many of which have a high risk of bias, are
small, or use nonstandard end point definitions. Many
publications reported on overlapping RCT populations;
we carefully avoided double counting by applying stan-
dard inclusion rules to these studies. In general, this
meant including the study with the largest cohort and
longest follow-up, which was often the most recent
work. Because LTBI reactivation risk is usually highest
shortly after infection, prolonging cohort follow-up time
may lead to decreased effect estimates, particularly for
long-term regimens. Our replacement of efficacy esti-
mates from Samandari and colleagues' 2011 article
(14) with those from their 2015 article (12) demon-
strated this; the efficacy of 36 months' INH treatment
waned over time. It is possible, therefore, that our anal-
ysis provides conservative efficacy estimates in some
instances, particularly for longer regimens and in set-
tings with a high TB burden where the potential for
reinfection is greater. We tested for publication bias;
however, our ability to do so was limited for some com-
parisons owing to sparse data. Lastly, although we pro-
vide stratified analyses for many covariates, including
HIV co-infection, little evidence exists on how concom-
itantly administered treatments, such as HIV ART, may
affect LTBI treatment efficacy. Although some recent
insights (34) have shown that beginning ART early
affects TB incidence—independent of LTBI treatment
(16)—data points were too limited to include ART as a
cofactor in our analysis.
In conclusion, despite limitations that include qual-
ity and reporting standards of the underlying studies,
the evidence for safety and efficacy of most standard
treatment regimens is robust (although evidence re-
mains sparse for the 9-month INH regimen). The evi-
dence for rifamycin-containing regimens, including
RPT, is improving. More evidence is needed, particu-
larly for RPT-based regimens; for the INH-RMP combi-
nation; for alternative treatments with a shorter dura-
tion and lower pill burden; and to assess the effect of
covariates, such as ART. It is reassuring nonetheless to
reaffirm the strengthening evidence for shorter rifamy-
cin regimens.
