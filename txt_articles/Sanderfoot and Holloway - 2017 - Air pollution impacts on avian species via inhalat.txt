Abstract
Despite the well-established links between air pollution and human health, vegetation, and
aquatic ecosystems, less attention has been paid to the potential impact of reactive atmospheric
gases and aerosols on avian species. In this literature review, we summarize findings published
since 1950 regarding avian responses to air pollution and discuss knowledge gaps that could be
addressed in future studies. We find consistent evidence for adverse health impacts on birds
attributable to exposure to gas-phase and particulate air pollutants, including carbon monoxide
(CO), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), smoke, and heavy metals, as well as mixtures of urban
and industrial emissions. Avian responses to air pollution include respiratory distress and illness,
increased detoxification effort, elevated stress levels, immunosuppression, behavioral changes, and
impaired reproductive success. Exposure to air pollution may furthermore reduce population
density, species diversity, and species richness in bird communities.
1. Introduction
It is well established in the peer-reviewed literature that
exposure to air pollution causes adverse human health
outcomes, including increased risk of respiratory
disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality
(West et al 2016, and references therein). Public health
research dating back to the 1950s has established
linkages between these adverse health outcomes and
respiratory
exposure
to
ambient
air
pollutants,
including tropospheric ozone (O3), aerosols (or
particulate matter, PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), heavy
metals (e.g. lead, mercury), certain hydrocarbons, and
other chemically and biologically active species present
in the air. Beyond human health, research suggests that
all ecosystem types are vulnerable to the effects of air
pollution (Lovett et al 2009), with most work to date
focused on characterizing the impacts of air pollution
on vegetation and aquatic environments. Ozone, in
particular, has been shown to reduce rates of
photosynthesis in plants (Reich and Amundson
1985), and the acidification of lakes resulting from
SO2 and NOx (NO2 þ NO) emissions affects both
species diversity and species richness in freshwater
communities (Brönmark and Hansson 2002).
To date, few studies have explored how chemical
characteristics of the air affect non-human animal
species, especially in wild populations. In fact,
searching the Clarivate Analytics Web of Science
platform in November 2016 (referred to hereafter as
WoS) for articles related to ‘air pollution’ and ‘human
health’ published since 1950 produced 2388 results,
while searching for articles related to ‘air pollution’
and ‘animals’ or ‘air pollution’ and ‘wild populations’
produced 658 and 3 results, respectively.
Among non-human animal species, birds may be
particularly vulnerable to health-damaging air pollu-
tants. The avian respiratory system, unlike the
mammalian respiratory system, is characterized by
unidirectional airflow and cross-current gas exchange,
features that improve the efficiency of respiration. In
fact, birds respire more efficiently than any other type
of terrestrial vertebrate. Avian species are therefore
more likely to be susceptible to high concentrations of
reactive gases and aerosols in the air than mammalian

 species, and so may serve as useful indicators of air
quality (Brown et al 1997). The literature on this topic
is limited: WoS searches for articles related to ‘air
pollution’ and ‘birds’ and ‘air quality’ and ‘birds’
produced just 132 and 87 results, respectively. Of the
articles found in the latter search, the top three were
focused on the effects of poor air quality on poultry,
not on wild bird populations. Smith et al acknowledge
the lack of understanding of avian responses to
inhalation exposure to atmospheric contaminants in a
2007 review article on exposure pathways affecting
terrestrial vertebrates (Smith et al 2007).
Birds have long been recognized as sentinel species
for environmental change. In the early 20th century,
caged canaries were brought down into coal mines to
signal when concentrations of toxic gases, such as
carbon monoxide, in the mines reached unsafe levels, a
practice which led to the use of the colloquial phrase
‘canary in the coal mine’ to refer to early warning signs
of future danger. Rachel Carson’s award-winning book
Silent Spring, published in 1962, brought attention to
the widespread impact of pesticide and insecticide
applications on songbirds. A number of avian species
have been assessed for their value in the biomonitoring
of metals (Burger and Gochfeld 1995, 1997, Saldiva
and Böhm 1998, Dauwe et al 2003, Manjula et al 2015)
as well as polychlorinated biphenyls and other organic
microcontaminants (Arenal et al 2004, Miniero et al
2008). Chronic dietary exposure to heavy metals—
including mercury and lead—has been shown to limit
avian reproductive success (Scheuhammer 1987,
Swiergosz et al 1998), and dietary exposure to
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)—a chemical
commonly used in pesticides and insecticides in the
mid-20th century—affects calcium metabolism in
avian species (Jefferies 1969) and leads to death in
songbirds (Wurster et al 1965, Hill et al 1971).
Research has also shown that changes in calcium
metabolism linked to exposure to DDT results in the
production of thin eggshells and the impaired
reproductive success of birds of prey (Ratcliffe
1967). Ecologists have also identified a number of
responses to climate change in wild bird populations,
including phenological shifts in the timing of spring
migration and altered species composition of over-
wintering bird communities (Jones et al 2012, Princé
and Zuckerberg 2015). A WoS search for articles
related to ‘climate change’ and ‘birds’ found 3507
results, with the top paper cited nearly 3800 times.
Birds could also serve as sentinel species for air
quality, as they are found globally, in both urban and
rural areas, and make use of many different habitat
types (Brown et al 1997, Baesse et al 2015). Their wide
flight ranges could be beneficial in studying and
understanding the spatial distribution of air pollutants
(Saldiva and Böhm 1998). Here we present a summary
of findings regarding avian responses to air pollution,
with an emphasis on inhalation exposure. Our focus
on the respiratory system is motivated by the high
metabolic rates of birds and expansive literature on
human health outcomes associated with inhalation
exposure to air pollutants. Below we outline study
methods, discuss key findings, and highlight the role of
future research. Key findings are divided into five
sections: (1) respiratory distress and illness, (2)
increased detoxification effort, elevated stress levels,
and immunosuppression, (3) behavioral changes, (4)
habitat degradation, and (5) impaired reproductive
success and demographic consequences. We aim to
provide foundational knowledge on avian responses to
air pollution, and to support a broader research effort
on air pollution impacts on birds.
2. Methods
An initial literature review was performed in January
2016 to gather peer-reviewed studies on avian
responses to reactive gases and aerosols. This literature
review was performed again in November 2016 to
capture more recent publications. Searches were
conducted using the Clarivate Analytics WoS platform,
accessed through the University of Wisconsin library
system. Key search terms included:
air pollution
air quality
ozone (O3)
smog
particulate matter
(PM)
PM2.5
PM10
particulates
aerosols
haze
nitrogen dioxide
(NO2)
nitric oxide (NO)
nitrogen oxides
(NOx)
sulfur dioxide (SO2)
carbon monoxide
(CO)
smoke
soot
metals
lead
DDT
mercury
Each term was paired with the words ‘birds’ and
‘avian’ in various combinations, utilizing both the
‘title’ and ‘topic’ fields in the basic search function.
Over 200 searches were performed. Search results were
refined so that only articles or reviews available in
English since 1950 were included in the lists of studies
generated by WoS. References cited in these studies or
citing
these
studies
were
also
considered,
and
additional citations were included where appropriate
to ensure full coverage of related research. Studies
examining poultry-keeping systems were excluded, as
these studies did not provide insight into how
exposure to outdoor air pollution may affect wild
birds.
However,
laboratory
studies
designed
to
investigate the effects of inhalation exposure to
ambient air pollutants in birds were included,
although some of these studies did use domesticated
species, such as chickens, as study specimens.
3. Key findings
To date, three general approaches have been used to
characterize avian responses to respiratory exposure to

 air pollution. Researchers have exposed birds to
gaseous mixtures or specific concentrations of gases or
aerosols in laboratory experiments, an approach which
we refer to as ‘controlled exposure.’ Birds have also
been monitored in natural habitats or caught in the
wild for further study, capturing in situ exposure.
Finally, we include case studies relevant to avian
sensitivity to air pollution. We report key findings
below
and
note
which
of
these
three
general
approaches (controlled exposure, in situ exposure,
or case study) was used to elucidate these findings.
3.1 Respiratory distress and illness
Studies have shown that both controlled and in situ
exposure to air pollutants cause morphological and
physiological changes in the avian respiratory system.
Exposure to air pollution clearly causes respiratory
distress in birds and increases their susceptibility to
respiratory infection.
3.1.1. Controlled exposure
Birds, like other vertebrate species, are susceptible to
carbon monoxide poisoning. CO is a product resulting
from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and
biomass. Exposure to CO results in the formation of
carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO), limiting the capacity of
hemoglobin to transport oxygen to tissues throughout
the body (Baker and Tumasonis 1972). Treatment for
carbon monoxide poisoning in birds typically includes
provision of supplemental oxygen, which reduces the
half-life of HbCO (Verstappen and Dorrestein 2005,
Simone-Freilicher 2008). The avian carbon monoxide
poisoning mechanism was explored in a 1974 study
(TschornandFedde1974),whichsuggestedthatCOmay
depress inhibitory interneurons in the central nervous
system, resulting in the abnormal breathing associated
with CO poisoning observed in the study specimens.
O3 also appears to pose a health risk to birds by
causing morphological and physiological changes in
the avian respiratory system (Rombout et al 1991,
Cuesta et al 2005). Ozone in near-surface environ-
ments
is
chemically
formed
through
reactions
involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. In a
study by Rombout et al (1991), adult male Japanese
quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were exposed to
varying O3 concentrations. Exposure to 0.50 ppm O3
resulted in the reduction and shortening of cilia in the
trachea and bronchi (figure 1), hypertrophy in the
secondary bronchi, hemorrhaging and inflammation
in the capillary network, necrosis of epithelial cells
lining the air capillaries, and symptoms of pulmonary
edema. Quail exposed to higher concentrations of O3
(1.50 ppm) were more severely affected. Individuals in
this treatment group showed a dramatic reduction in
the number of ciliated cells in the trachea and bronchi.
Hemorrhaging and changes in the structure of the
atrial epithelium resulted in the closing of the atrial
space, reducing air flow and possibly contributing to
the labored breathing exhibited by this treatment
group during the experiment. Only the birds in this
treatment group presented a statistically significant
increase in lung weight and lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) activity (Rombout et al 1991), often considered
a response to injury or stress. Cuesta et al (2005) also
found a statistically significant increase in expression
of adrenomedullin-like protein in pigeons (Columba
livia domestica) exposed to high levels of O3 as
compared to those in a control group, which appears
to be the only study to date on air pollution impacts on
adrenomedullin-like immunoreactivity in birds, a sign
of respiratory distress.
Exposure to SO2 may impair the avian immune
response to inhaled antigens, making birds more

 susceptible to disease (Wakabayashi et al 1977). SO2 is
a gas that is emitted from the combustion of sulfur-
containing fuels, such as coal or petroleum oil. Results
from a 1977 study show that exposure to SO2, even at
concentrations as low as 1.4 ppm, compromises the
effectiveness of the mucocilliary system in White
Leghorn chickens, which plays a crucial role in
reducing the incidence of respiratory disease by
clearing contaminants, including infectious agents,
from the airway (Wakabayashi et al 1977). Fedde and
Kuhlmann (1979) found that White Leghorn chickens
exposed to much higher concentrations of SO2
(>1000 ppm) exhibited signs of respiratory distress,
and the majority of those exposed to SO2 at a
concentration of 5000 ppm died.
Multiple studies have shown that birds are also
likely affected by elevated concentrations of particle
pollution (Sterner 1993a, 1993b, Tell et al 2006, Tell
et al 2012). PM includes any liquid or solid suspended
in the air, typically classified by size such that PM2.5
represents PM less than 2.5 microns in diameter and
PM10 represents PM less than 10 microns in diameter.
Health-relevant PM can include directly emitted
particles, such as wind-blown dust or smoke from
fires, and/or chemically formed particles, such as
sulfate and nitrate aerosols. Tell et al (2006) examined
the use of an aerosolized fluorescent microsphere
technique of their own design to study particle
deposition in adult domestic pigeons. Their results
demonstrated that smaller particles (those less than
three microns in diameter) are more likely to be well
dispersed in the avian respiratory system than larger
particles (those greater than six microns in diameter),
which are more likely to remain in the upper airway
(Tell et al 2006). Tell et al (2012) confirmed that the
extent of deposition increases with exposure time (Tell
et al 2012). Understanding how particles are deposited
in the respiratory system and cleared from the airway
will be important in differentiating responses to acute
and chronic exposure to air pollution.
3.1.2. In situ exposure
A number of studies have used microscopic imagery
and chemical analysis to compare the morphology and
biochemistry of lung tissue from birds captured in
urban and rural areas in order to discern physiological
differences that are likely attributable to urban air
pollution (Lorz and López 1997, Cuesta et al 2005,
Sicolo et al 2009, Ejaz et al 2014, Steyn and Maina
2015). Birds exposed to urban air pollution may
exhibit a buildup of cellular and mineral debris leading
to
lung
parenchymal
consolidation
or
alveolar
consolidation, a characteristic condition of pneumo-
nia (Ejaz et al 2014). Researchers in Spain have shown
that exposure to urban air pollution may also impact
the avian pulmonary surfactant system (Lorz and
López 1997, Cuesta et al 2005).
Pulmonary surfactant is a lipoprotein complex,
and the secretion of pulmonary surfactant helps
reduce tension in
the respiratory system, thus
preventing the lungs from collapsing during expiration
(Lorz and López 1997, Cuesta et al 2005). Pulmonary
surfactant also plays an important role in the defense
mechanisms of the lung. The lipids and proteins that
make up the surfactant are stored in lamellar bodies—
dense structures found in the cytoplasm of type 2
pneumocytes (Lorz and López 1997). In a 1997 study,
pigeons were captured and examined to determine if
the number of lamellar bodies in lung tissue differed
between birds living in rural habitats (collected from a
farm in the village of Guadalajara) and urban habitats
(captured in the city of Madrid). If more pulmonary
surfactant is excreted by type 2 pneumocytes, the
number of lamellar bodies would be expected to
decline. The researchers found a 33% reduction in the
quantity of lamellar bodies in urban birds as compared
to rural birds, indicative of elevated secretion of
pulmonary surfactant and, therefore, respiratory
distress (Lorz and López 1997).
Phosphatidylcholine is an important component
of pulmonary surfactant. In mammals, secretion of
phosphatidylcholine is stimulated by adrenomedullin,
a peptide hormone. Elevated
concentrations
of
adrenomedullin
have
been
documented
in
the
pathologies for several mammalian respiratory dis-
eases, including asthma. A 2005 study demonstrated
the presence of an adrenomedullin-like protein in the
avian respiratory system (Cuesta et al 2005). In this
study, pigeons were captured and observed to
determine if expression of this adrenomedullin-like
protein differed between birds living in rural and
urban habitats. Results showed that expression of the
adrenomedullin-like protein was higher in birds
exposed to chronic urban air pollution, evidence of
greater stimulation of phosphatidylcholine secretion
and elevated levels of pulmonary surfactant. This
finding suggests that pigeons exposed to urban air
pollution suffer from respiratory distress (Cuesta et al
2005).
In Johannesburg, South Africa, Steyn and Maina
(2015) found that house sparrows (Passer domesticus),
Cape glossy starlings (Lamprotornis nitens), and
laughing doves (Streptopelia senegalensis) exposed to
urban air pollution had a greater number of free
surface macrophages in the lungs than those from
rural areas. Macrophages play an important role in
immune response by destroying or sequestering
foreign particulates and aerosols. The doves exhibited
the greatest numbers of macrophages, followed by the
starlings, while the sparrows had the least (Steyn and
Maina 2015). These results align with observations by
Lorz and López (1997), which demonstrated that
domestic pigeons from urban areas had a greater
number of macrophages in lung tissue than those from
rural sites (figure 2).
A series of studies conducted at the University of
Barcelona in the 1990s sought to investigate changes in
the tracheal epithelium of birds exposed to SO2, NOx,
Environ. Res. Lett. 12 (2017) 083002

 and particulate emissions from coal-fired power plants
in northeastern Spain (Llacuna et al 1993, 1996, Gorriz
et al 1994). Goldfinches (Carduelis carduelis) exposed
to emissions from a power plant showed greater
mucus production, a shortening of the cilia in the
epithelial cells lining the trachea, and an increase in the
number and size of secretory vesicles. These changes to
the tracheal epithelium were less pronounced in rock
buntings (Emberiza cia) and great tits (Parus major),
which the authors suggest may be attributable to the
study design which prevented the goldfinches, trapped
in cages, from moving away from the source of
emissions (Llacuna et al 1993). A related study found
abnormal orientation of the cilia in rock buntings and
great tits exposed to emissions from a power plant,
possibly resulting from increased production of
mucus, but not in goldfinches or blackbirds (Turdus
merula). Normal orientation of cilia helps to clear
particles from the airway and support air flow (Gorriz
et al 1994).
3.1.3. Case studies
Smoke is known to cause both thermal and chemical
damage to avian lung tissue, as well as increase a bird’s
susceptibility to respiratory infection (Morris et al
1986, Verstappen and Dorrestein 2005, Simone-
Freilicher 2008, Kinne et al 2010). Morris et al
(1986) linked exposure to smoke with an outbreak of
the contagious respiratory disease laryngotracheitis in
a flock of chickens, as well as a short-term increase in
mortality and a short-term decline in egg production.
Verstappen and Dorrestein (2005) documented the
effects of indoor smoke exposure in blue-fronted
Amazon parrots (Amazona aestiva aestiva) kept in an
aviary. Within hours following exposure, the parrots
developed dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and minor
damage
to
their
lung
tissue
(Verstappen
and
Dorrestein 2005). A female ruby blue-headed pionus
parrot (Pionus menstruus rubrigularis) showed similar
symptoms, as well as weight loss, secondary respira-
tory infections, and decreased activity after repeated
incidences of indoor smoke exposure (Simone-
Freilicher 2008). Kinne et al (2010) suggest that
carbon monoxide poisoning is usually the cause of
death in birds following smoke exposure, but that
mycotic air sacculitis, pneumonia, and additional
responses to other compounds present in smoke may
continue for days or weeks.
Smoke inhalation may also compromise the ability
of birds to escape during wildfire events. While the
eggs and chicks of ground-nesting species and
waterfowl undergoing molt are thought to be most
susceptible to fire events, monitoring of wading bird
species in the Everglades showed that even adult,
flighted birds may die during wildfires. A fire in April
of 1999 caused the death of 50 adult white ibises
(Eudocimus albus) found on a cattail island. The ibises
likely became trapped due to the presence of thick
smoke (Epanchin et al 2002).
3.2. Increased detoxification effort, elevated stress
levels, and immunosuppression
Laboratory and field studies have also determined that
exposure
to
air
pollutants
results
in
increased
detoxification effort and elevated stress levels in birds,
providing further evidence of the negative health
impacts of air pollution on avian species. This research
also shows that the avian immune response may be
impaired following acute or chronic exposure to air
pollution, giving added weight to the previous
discussion of how birds exposed to health-damaging
air pollutants may be more susceptible to respiratory
disease (see section 3.1).
3.2.1. Controlled exposure
Inhalation exposure to air pollution may increase the
stress response and detoxification effort in birds
(Cruz-Martinez et al 2015b). SO2, NO2, and VOCs are
the major air pollutants associated with oil sands
operations, an important point source of air pollution.
VOCs are a class of chemicals that contain carbon and
hydrogen, many of which are associated with direct
human health impacts, especially cancer. To study how
emissions from oil sands operations may impact
avifauna, researchers exposed Japanese quail and
American kestrels (Falco sparverius) to gaseous
mixtures of SO2, NO2, and VOCs in whole-body
inhalation chambers and measured resulting cortico-
sterone (CORT) and 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase
(EROD) concentrations in blood samples. CORT

 activity is an indicator of stress, while EROD activity is
often used to signal the body’s increased detoxification
effort, especially of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
Japanese quail were randomly assigned to three
groups: control (hydrocarbon-free air), low exposure
(0.5 ppm SO2, 0.2 ppm NO2, 0.6 ppm benzene, and 1
ppm toluene), and high exposure (50 ppm SO2, 20
ppm NO2, 60 ppm benzene, and 100 ppm toluene).
Quail were exposed to these gaseous mixtures for 1.5 h
each day for 20 d. American kestrels were separated
into a control and experimental group and exposed to
hydrocarbon-free air and 5.6 ppm SO2, 2 ppm NO2,
0.6 ppm benzene, and 1 ppm toluene, respectively, for
1.4 h each day for 18 d (Cruz-Martinez et al 2015b).
CORT activity increased and EROD activity
doubled in the kestrels exposed to experimental
conditions compared to those exposed to hydrocar-
bon-free air, though these results were not statistically
significant. CORTactivity increased in the quail in the
low exposure group as compared to the control and
high exposure groups. These results are characteristic
of a hormetic response to toxins, in which low doses of
toxins prompt a response that is inhibited at higher
doses. There was no statistically significant difference
in the detoxification effort amongst quail in exposure
trials. Quail, like other species in the Galliformes
order, may be more resistant than other avian species
to toxic gases (Cruz-Martinez et al 2015b). Though the
results of this study demonstrate a specific physiologi-
cal response to elevated levels of common atmospheric
contaminants, it is not possible to isolate the response
to any of the four distinct compounds the quail and
kestrels were exposed to in these trials (Cruz-Martinez
et al 2015b). Fernie et al (2016) also show that
exposure to a gaseous mixture of benzene, toluene,
NO2, and SO2 might upregulate function of the
hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis in kestrels, which
could affect the hormonal control of many key
activities, including metabolism and reproduction.
Additional research is needed to further characterize
the role of the thyroid gland in the stress response and
detoxification effort in birds following exposure to air
pollution (Fernie et al 2016).
According to a study conducted in 2005 and 2006,
exposure to VOCs may compromise the avian
immune system (Olsgard et al 2008). In 2005,
American kestrels caught in the wild near Prince
Albert, Saskatchewan, Alberta were divided into two
groups: control (breathing grade air) and high
exposure (10 ppm benzene and 80 ppm toluene).
The kestrels were exposed to these gaseous mixtures
for 1 h each day for 28 d. In 2006, captive kestrels were
assigned to one of three groups: control (breathing
grade air), low exposure (0.1 ppm benzene and 0.8
ppm toluene), and high exposure (10 ppm benzene
and 80 ppm toluene). The kestrels were exposed to
these gaseous mixtures for 1.5 h each day for 27 d.
The results of this study indicate that while the
humoral immune response might not be impacted by
inhalation exposure to VOCs, the cell-mediated
immune response is suppressed in kestrels exposed
to gaseous mixtures of benzene and toluene, at both
the low dose and high dose levels (Olsgard et al 2008).
These findings support earlier studies indicating that
exposure to air pollution may increase the risk of
respiratory infection in birds.
3.2.2. In situ exposure
Exposure to industrial air pollution has been linked to
genotoxic effects in birds (Baesse et al 2015), including
higher rates of heritable genetic mutations (Yauk and
Quinn 1996, Yauk et al 2000, King et al 2014).
Exposure to air pollution has also been associated with
the bioaccumulation of metals in the tissues of vital
organs of birds that occupy habitats near point sources
of air pollution (Nyholm 1994, 1995, Llacuna et al
1995, Hui 2002, Lovett et al 2009, Berglund et al 2011)
or habitats affected by long-range transport of air
pollution (Nybø et al 1996). Exposure to metals may
lead to oxidative stress in some birds (Koivula and
Eeva 2010, Rainio et al 2013). Avian exposure to
mercury is correlated with neurological damage and
impaired reproductive success (Lovett et al 2009) while
the uptake of lead has been shown to affect the
behavioral development of chicks and negatively
impact their growth and survival rates (Burger and
Gochfeld 2000). Exposure to lead also reduces the
activity of d-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD),
an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the production of
heme. Findings from a study of European starlings
(Sturnus vulgaris) in Prince George’s County, Mary-
land, United States linked respiratory and dietary
exposure to lead emitted by motor vehicles to
decreased ALAD activity (Grue et al 1986).
A 1996 study focused on characterizing hemato-
logical changes in great tits, rock buntings, and
blackbirds exposed to emissions from power plants
(Llacuna et al 1996). The study found that exposure to
industrial emissions from a coal-fired power plant
decreased erythrocyte (red blood cell) counts by 11.4%
in great tits and by 16.2% in rock buntings.
Erythrocytes were also noticeably larger. This is likely
due to the immune system’s targeted destruction of
defective erythrocytes and rapid production of new,
immature erythrocytes, which are bigger. Blackbirds
also showed statistically significant weight loss and
greater concentrations of transaminases, a symptom
indicative of liver disease. Plasma samples from rock
buntings captured near the power plant also showed a
decrease in beta globulins, indicative of infection
(Llacuna et al 1996).
Industrial air pollution associated with oil sands
activity may also negatively affect the health of
avifauna. A recent study by Cruz-Martinez et al
studied detoxification effort and immune response in
tree swallow nestlings (Tachycineta bicolor) at sites
near oil sands operations (2015a). Exposure to
elevated concentrations of ambient air pollutants

 associated with oil sands activity was linked to
increased detoxification effort and suppression of
cell-mediated immunity (Cruz-Martinez et al 2015a).
Exposure to high levels of urban air pollution was
found to increase concentrations of elemental toxins
in the tissues of vital organs in wild birds, including
starlings, owls, crows, and pigeons, captured in
Lahore, Pakistan. The magnitude of this increase
varied by tissue type and species. Researchers also
noted symptoms of degeneration and necrosis of liver
tissue in captured birds (Ejaz et al 2014).
Findings from a study of pigeons in the city of
Milan, Italy indicate that porphyrin concentrations in
bird excrement and blood methemoglobin levels may
serve as useful bioindicators of urban air pollution.
Results from this study showed that excreta collected
from the pigeons exposed to urban air pollution had
significantly higher total porphyrin concentrations
and greater proportions of protoporphyrins compared
to that collected from control pigeons. Methemoglo-
bin levels were also higher in blood samples collected
from the urban birds. This was one of the few studies
we discuss in our review that included measurements
of ambient air quality, which allowed the researchers to
link
increased protoporphyrin concentrations
in
excreta
to elevated
concentrations
of
polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons and higher blood methemo-
globin levels to elevated concentrations of ozone and
benzene (Sicolo et al 2009).
3.3. Behavioral changes
Few studies have assessed how exposure to air
pollutants may alter bird behavior, but existing
research suggests that many different behaviors could
be affected, from spontaneous activity to homing.
3.3.1. Controlled exposure
Avian exposure to phosphoric acids aerosols may result
in changes in activity and weight loss (Sterner 1993a,
1993b). A series of studies conducted by Sterner in 1993
was designed to determine if acute exposure to
phosphoric acids aerosols affected spontaneous activity
such as walking and preening in rock doves (Columba
livia). Twenty-four rock doves (11 males and 13
females) were exposed to phosphoric acids aerosols at
concentrations of 0.0, 1.0, and 4.0 mg l�1 for 80 min
day�1 for two days. Preening and ambulatory activity
were found to significantly decline in the 4.0 mg l�1
group following the first exposure (Sterner 1993a).
Sterner’s studies also determined that rock doves
exposed to phosphoric acids aerosols at concentrations
of 1.0 mg l�1 and 4.0 mg l�1 exhibited reduced water
intake, food intake, and body weight as compared to
control groups, with recovery dependent on both
concentration and sex (figure 3) (Sterner 1993b).
3.3.2. In situ exposure
A recent study also established a connection between
behavioral changes and exposure to particulate
pollution in cities. It is possible that high concen-
trations of particulate matter resulting in the haze seen
in metropolitan centers may motivate city pigeons to
home faster. Further study is needed to determine if
this change in behavior is seen in other cities or as a
result of exposure to different types of air pollutants
(Li et al 2016).
3.4. Habitat degradation
Industrial emissions often include NOx, SO2, and
heavy metals. Emitted NOx and/or SO2 react in the
atmosphere to form nitric and sulfuric acid, which
when deposited in wet or dry form contribute to acid
deposition (commonly referred to as ‘acid rain’) and
soil acidification. Acid deposition has been hypothe-
sized to contribute to the bioaccumulation of metals in
birds (Scheuhammer 1991), possibly by increasing the
solubility of elements such as aluminum (Scanes and
McNabb 2003). Exposure to acid rain also affects
calcium and phosphorus metabolism, production of
stress hormones, food intake, growth rate, and
reproductive success (Scanes and McNabb 2003).
Acid deposition and heavy metal uptake of soils near
point sources of industrial emissions often affect the
composition of the plant and invertebrate communi-
ties on which birds depend for their food supply (Eeva
et al 1998, 2003, 2005, Belskii and Belskaya 2009,
2013c, Costa et al 2011, Belskii and Grebennikov
2014). Changes in the chemical environment may
promote ecological shifts that increase food availability
for some species. For example, great tits may have
greater reproductive success at sites near point sources
of emissions associated with the pulp and paper
industry due to higher abundance of caterpillars—a
key food resource for this species—in these areas
(Costa et al 2011, 2014). However, other avian species
may suffer if air pollution reduces the quantity or

 quality of food resources (Eeva et al 2003, 2005, Belskii
and Grebennikov 2014).
Changes in food supply may also result in a
decrease in the availability of foods bearing pigments
(i.e. carotenoids), which in turn could indirectly affect
reproductive success by reducing the vibrancy of a
bird’s plumage. Faded plumage is a disadvantage for
males, as more vibrant, colorful plumage appears to be
a sign of good physical condition, rendering males
more attractive to potential female mates (Eeva et al
1998). The antioxidant activity of pigments also helps
to protect birds from oxidative stress.
Food intake may also be affected by behavioral
changes that limit foraging time. Birds may spend less
time foraging if tree canopies thin as a result of air
pollution, making birds more susceptible to predation
(Brotons et al 1998). Changes in forest structure or
the composition of local habitat may also affect the
prevalence of ectoparasites, which could affect the
health of both nestlings and adult birds (Belskii et al
2005, Eeva and Klemola 2013).
3.5. Impaired reproductive success and demographic
consequences
Both
the
direct,
toxic
effects
of
exposure
to
atmospheric contaminants as well as the indirect
effects of air pollution on avifauna (i.e. shifts in food
availability) have been linked to impaired reproductive
success. Reproductive success is a measure of how
effective a parent generation is in passing their genes
on to subsequent generations, and as such is often
assessed by determining not only the number of
offspring produced but also the fitness of those
offspring.
3.5.1. Controlled exposure
While previous studies had established that embryos
do respond to their gaseous environments, a 1972
study provided further insight into how CO diffusion
through the eggshell and inner and outer shell
membranes may affect the growth and development
of bird embryos. Baker and Tumasonis (1972) found
that the hatchability and viability of White Leghorn
chicken eggs declined as CO levels increased (figure 4),
and 425 ppm CO was determined to be the critical
concentration for these parameters. Vasodilation of
blood vessels was noted in embryos exposed to CO
concentrations above 425 ppm. LDH concentrations
in the blood serum also increased in embryos exposed
to CO at the critical level, a common indicator of
injury or stress. Exposure to higher concentrations of
CO also resulted in increased mortality, and exposure
to 1000 ppm CO resulted in 100% mortality. Chicks
that hatched following exposure to CO were smaller
than control chicks and showed physical abnormalities
if exposed during the embryonic stage to CO
concentrations above 425 ppm (Baker and Tumasonis
1972). Furthermore, the results of this study show that
while
the
eggshell
and
inner
and
outer
shell
membranes of White Leghorn chicken eggs limit
the diffusion of CO, the ability of these layers to
protect embryos from CO poisoning appears to
degrade with time. Both the age of the egg and the shell
condition therefore affect the permeability of an
embryonated egg (Baker and Tumasonis 1972). If the
eggshell and inner and outer shell membranes of eggs
provide only limited protection against elevated
concentrations of CO, it is plausible that other
atmospheric contaminants might also be able to
diffuse through the egg’s layered surface and affect bird
embryos.
3.5.2. In situ exposure
Recent studies in Finland, (Eeva and Lehikoinen 1995,
1996), Russia (Belskii et al 1995a, 1995b, 2005),
Belgium (Dauwe et al 2005), Sweden, (Nyholm 1994,
1995), Portugal (Costa et al 2011, 2014), and Tunisia
(Alaya-Ltifi et al 2012) have examined the reproduc-
tive success of birds living within industrial air
pollution gradients, as well as the fitness of their
offspring. It should be noted that because these field
studies examined how proximity to point sources of
air
pollution
impacts
reproductive success,
any
observed effects could be due to habitat degradation,
inhalation exposure to atmospheric contaminants,
and/or ingestion of pollutants that deposit to Earth’s
surface and are consumed with food.
As part of an ongoing study first begun in the
1990s, researchers observed pied flycatchers (Ficedula
hypoleuca), a migratory species, and great tits, a
resident species, at nest boxes constructed at 14 study
sites located within an elliptical air pollution gradient
surrounding a copper-smelter complex in Harjavalta,
Finland. The research team used the heavy metal
content of the soil at this industrial site as a proxy
measurement for total air pollution exposure associ-
ated with operation of the smelter, known to emit SO2
and heavy metals (copper, lead, and nickel). The heavy
metal content decreased exponentially with distance
from the smelter. The researchers wanted to determine

 if the reproductive success of these birds was impaired
at study sites closer to the copper smelter due to the
production of low-quality eggs and increased nestling
mortality. This hypothesis was based on previous work
showing that exposure to heavy metals and acidifying
compounds might impair avian reproductive success
by affecting calcium metabolism and reducing the
availability of calcium in local food resources, all of
which results in eggs with thinner shells and growth
abnormalities in nestlings (Scheuhammer 1991, Eeva
and Lehikoinen 1995, 1996).
Both the pied flycatchers and the great tits
occupying nest boxes at sites closest to the smelter
laid fewer eggs, but the pied flycatcher showed an
overall greater vulnerability to exposure to industrial
air pollution than did the great tit. Hatching success of
pied flycatchers was also dramatically reduced at sites
closest to the complex (Eeva and Lehikoinen 1995).
Production of low-quality eggs did appear to drive the
impairment in reproductive success at this industrial
site. The eggs of the pied flycatchers were 8% smaller
by volume with 17% thinner shells at sites closest to
the factory complex as compared to sites located
10 km away, and microscopy revealed that the surface
of the eggs collected from sites nearest the factory were
more rough and porous (Eeva and Lehikoinen 1995).
The foraging strategy of the pied flycatcher was
suggested to account for its greater sensitivity to
industrial pollutants (Eeva and Lehikoinen 1995).
Later work by this group also found that pied
flycatchers, unlike great tits, exhibit stress responses
suggestive of a direct toxic effect in the vicinity of point
sources of industrial air pollution (Eeva et al 2000).
Species-specific differences in avian responses to air
pollution have been noted in other studies as well. For
example, researchers in Flanders, Belgium were
surprised to find no statistically significant differences
in the breeding performance of blue tits (Parus
caeruleus) within an industrial air pollution gradient
resulting from the operation of a metallurgic smelter
(Dauwe et al 2005).
The impacts of heavy metal and SO2 emissions
from a copper-smelting plant on pied flycatchers were
also studied in Russia by Belskii et al (1995a, 1995b,
2005). Results from these studies indicate that
reproductive success is impaired at nesting sites
closest to point sources of industrial emissions (Belskii
et al 1995a, 1995b, 2005). At nests more than 15 km
from the copper smelter, clutch size increased by a
factor of 1.5, and both the number of hatched chicks
and the number of fledglings per nest doubled
compared to nests located in the nearby vicinity of
the plant. At those sites closest to the plant, egg
mortality was also 3.5 times greater (Belskii et al 2005).
In addition, the results of this study showed that the
proportion of nestlings infested by parasitic fly larvae
as well as the severity of infestation (as measured by
the average number of fly larvae per infested chick)
increased with decreasing distance to the plant. Higher
liver indices, reduced hemoglobin concentrations, and
greater proportions of immature erythrocytes in
nestlings were linked to both the direct toxic effect
of air pollutants and greater incidence and severity of
parasitic infestation, leading the authors to suggest
that exposure to industrial air pollution leads to a
general weakening in nestlings, rendering them more
susceptible to infestation and subsequent infection
(Belskii et al 2005).
Fortunately, Eeva and Lehikoinen (2000, 2015)
show that reducing industrial emissions from point
sources improves the reproductive success of birds
living nearby. As emissions at the copper smelter in
Harjavalta declined, both the clutch size of pied
flycatchers and the number of fledglings per nest
increased (Eeva and Lehikoinen 2000, 2015). However,
recovery is often slow. Even as emissions and the
resulting atmospheric deposition of heavy metals
decline, birds are still exposed to high concentrations
of metals in soils due to the much more gradual rate of
soil cycling (Berglund and Nyholm 2011).
Research suggests that impaired reproductive
success in birds resulting from exposure to air
pollution may also have demographic consequences.
Several studies have linked declines in bird population
density (Flousek 1989, Eeva et al 2002, 2012, Saha and
Padhy 2011, Belskii and Belskaya 2013a, 2013b, Alaya-
Ltifi and Selmi 2014), species diversity (Saha and
Padhy 2011, Eeva et al 2012, Belskii and Belskaya
2013a, 2013b, Alaya-Ltifi and Selmi 2014), and species
richness (Belskii and Lyakhov 2003, Belskii and
Belskaya 2013a, 2013b) to exposure to industrial air
pollution. As proximity to a point source of industrial
air pollution increases, population density, species
diversity, and species richness decrease. Researchers
point out that changes in the structure and composi-
tion of soils and vegetation resulting from air pollution
may affect a number of variables important to the life
histories of the birds studied, including food supply
and the availability of nesting sites. None of these
studies causally linked inhalation exposure to indus-
trial air pollutants to changes in population density,
species diversity, or species richness. Within an air
pollution gradient, it is difficult to determine how
much of the variation in these metrics is due to direct
exposure to airborne toxins and how much is due to
other abiotic and biotic changes associated with
industrial pollution in the local environment (Belskii
and Belskaya 2013b). Noise pollution may also be a
confounding variable in assessing the impacts of
industrial air pollution on birds, as noise pollution
often increases with proximity to industrial sites (Saha
and Padhy 2011).
It is possible that species-specific differences in
reproductive success following exposure to air pollu-
tion could lead to shifts in the composition of avian
communities. Studies have already linked changes in
avian community composition to habitat degradation
caused by air pollution. Damage caused by air

 pollution to trees alters the structure of forest
ecosystems. While some birds may be able to colonize
these habitats, others may make use of ecological
niches that are no longer available within that
landscape. Over time, this may change the community
composition of forests exposed to industrial air
pollution (Capek 1991, Capek et al 1998, Belskii
and Lyakhov 2003, Eeva et al 2012, Belskii and
Belskaya 2013a). For example, point counts of birds in
an air pollution gradient resulting from industrial
emissions from the Karabash Copper Smelter in
Russia showed that the proportion of canopy-nesting
and ground-nesting species in the area increased along
the gradient while the proportion of hole-nesting
species decreased (Belskii and Belskaya 2013a).
4. Discussion
This review finds clear evidence that birds are affected
by exposure to a range of reactive gases and particles in
the air, including air pollutants with established
adverse impacts on human health. Avian responses to
air pollution include respiratory distress and illness,
increased detoxification effort, elevated stress levels,
immunosuppression, behavioral changes, and im-
paired reproductive success. Air pollution may also
reduce population density, species diversity, and
species richness in bird communities (table 1, figure
5). These demographic consequences are a result of
both the direct, toxic effect of exposure to air pollution
as well as habitat degradation resulting from poor air
quality. Although available
evidence consistently
demonstrates that exposure to air pollution impacts
birds, the total number of studies on this topic is
limited, and important gaps remain.
Researchers have documented avian responses to
both industrial and urban air pollution by studying
birds in air pollution gradients and by comparing the
characteristics of birds captured from industrial and
urban areas to those from less polluted sites. While
some studies do include information about atmo-
spheric contaminants at study sites, many do not
quantify exposure or nearby ambient concentrations
of
specific
chemicals.
Quantitative
measures
of
pollutants are rarely used to characterize the sensitivity
of a response to specific contaminants. Rather, most
study results reflect a comparison between birds of the
same species from more or less polluted sites. While
the statistical significance of these comparative studies
indicates that direct exposure to air pollution is
affecting birds, additional confounding variables such
as habitat degradation and changes in diet may also
contribute
to
the
responses
observed.
Without
exposure estimates for individual contaminants, there
is insufficient data to quantify air pollution risk to wild
bird populations.
The main challenge in characterizing birds’
exposure to specific air pollutants is the availability
of ambient air pollution measurements for compari-
son with ecological and biological outcomes. Epide-
miological studies of human health risk from air
pollution often rely on centrally located ambient
monitors as a proxy for individual exposure (e.g. the
network of surface air monitors run by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency). These
surface monitors could also support analysis of risks
to birds, with sufficient information on species habitat
and migration patterns. However, most areas of the
world do not have ground-based air pollution
monitors, and short-term measurements can be
difficult, expensive, and of limited relevance to
long-term exposure (depending on the duration of
the measurements and the variability of the pollutant).
Two additional data sources from the atmospheric
chemistry community could supplement in situ
chemical
measurements
for
the
benefit
of
the
ornithology community: chemical transport models
(CTMs) and satellite data. Most widely used CTMs
provide calculated concentrations of the gas and
particulate pollutants discussed in this review, and
models have been used to estimate human and
vegetation exposure in the absence of in situ
measurements. CTMs take information on natural
and anthropogenic emissions, with a global example
shown in figure 6, and calculate ambient concen-
trations based on chemical reactions and meteorolog-
ical transport. Satellite retrievals also offer promise for
health- and ecosystem-relevant pollutants, including
NO2, CO, and PM, with available global data on a near
daily basis going back as far as 1999, depending on the
instrument. Laboratory-based risk factors, discussed
above, and ambient air pollution concentrations from
measurements, models, and/or satellite data could be
combined to estimate bird health risk on a local,
regional, or global scale.
While potentially informative, such integration of
laboratory exposure studies and ambient pollution
estimates would have limitations. Rombout et al
(1991) point out that results from laboratory studies
must be interpreted with caution, as these studies
often use inhalation chamber techniques, which
require that birds are stationary during exposure. In
the wild, birds would have higher metabolic rates,
which would potentially magnify the negative effects
of air pollution on the respiratory system (Rombout
et al 1991, Gorriz et al 1994). Sterner (1993a, 1993b)
discusses how restricting birds to cages may result in
behavioral changes that are not actually due to
elevated concentrations of reactive gases and aerosols.
He refers to this as the ‘chamber confinement effect.’
Finally, Llacuna et al (1993) also point out that the
results
of
laboratory
studies
examining
avian
responses to exposure to a single pollutant are
important, though not sufficient, in characterizing
the impacts of air pollution on avifauna in natural
settings, where they are exposed to a combination of
atmospheric contaminants of varying concentrations.

 Some of these same limitations already affect the
characterization of air pollution risk to humans,
including the challenge of extrapolating laboratory
studies to real-world conditions (e.g. toxicological
results of rats and other non-human species), and
isolating the effects of a single pollutant health risk
when exposure occurs simultaneously to multiple
pollutants.
While physiological responses to exposure to air
pollutants may serve as examples of phenotypic
plasticity, this is not discussed in the studies cited in
this review. The capacity for both phenotypic plasticity
and adaptation in response to increased concentra-
tions of near-surface reactive gases and aerosols could
inform which species may face a greater long-term risk
from air pollution exposure.
As we improve the characterization of air pollution
risk to birds, it is important to consider interaction of
the chemicals in the air with other aspects of global
environmental change, including shifts in land use and
climate change (Lovett et al 2009). For example,
urbanization affects both land use and air quality, and
warmer temperatures associated with climate change
affect air pollution emissions (e.g. smoke from

and thus serves as an indicator of emissions from all fuel types. This map does not show the ambient concentrations of pollutants birds
are exposed to, but rather highlights where anthropogenic air pollution would be expected to pose the greatest risk to bird
communities. Map created using ECCAD (Emissions of Atmospheric Compounds & Compilation of Ancillary Data), maintained by

 wildfires) and chemical reactions in the atmosphere
(e.g. production of ozone) (Jacob and Winner 2009).
Of the roughly 10 000 species of birds known
worldwide,
only
a
few
have
been
studied
to
characterize avian responses to air pollution, and
the animals used in laboratory experiments may not be
representative of the wild bird species most at risk
from air pollution. Future studies should work to
identify which species across the globe may be most
sensitive to air pollution, as well as any potential
differences in response dependent on age and/or sex.
Future research on avian responses to air pollution,
especially of endangered species, could inform bird
conservation programs and improve management of
wild bird populations.
