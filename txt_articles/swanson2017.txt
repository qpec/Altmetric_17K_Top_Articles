Background: The Multimodal Treatment Study (MTA) began as a 14-month randomized clinical trial of behavioral
and pharmacological treatments of 579 children (7–10 years of age) diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD)-combined type. It transitioned into an observational long-term follow-up of 515 cases consented for
continuation and 289 classmates (258 without ADHD) added as a local normative comparison group (LNCG), with
assessments 2–16 years after baseline. Methods: Primary (symptom severity) and secondary (adult height) outcomes
in adulthood were specified. Treatment was monitored to age 18, and naturalistic subgroups were formed based on
three patterns of long-term use of stimulant medication (Consistent, Inconsistent, and Negligible). For the follow-up,
hypothesis-generating analyses were performed on outcomes in early adulthood (at 25 years of age). Planned
comparisons were used to estimate ADHD-LNCG differences reflecting persistence of symptoms and naturalistic
subgroup differences reflecting benefit (symptom reduction) and cost (height suppression) associated with extended
use of medication. Results: For ratings of symptom severity, the ADHD-LNCG comparison was statistically
significant for the parent/self-report average (0.51 � 0.04, p < .0001, d = 1.11), documenting symptom persistence,
and for the parent/self-report difference (0.21 � 0.04, p < .0001, d = .60), documenting source discrepancy, but the
comparisons of naturalistic subgroups reflecting medication effects were not significant. For adult height, the ADHD
group was 1.29 � 0.55 cm shorter than the LNCG (p < .01, d = .21), and the comparisons of the naturalistic
subgroups were significant: the treated group with the Consistent or Inconsistent pattern was 2.55 � 0.73 cm
shorter than the subgroup with the Negligible pattern (p < .0005, d = .42), and within the treated group, the
subgroup with the Consistent pattern was 2.36 � 1.13 cm shorter than the subgroup with the Inconsistent pattern
(p < .04, d = .38). Conclusions: In the MTA follow-up into adulthood, the ADHD group showed symptom persistence
compared to local norms from the LNCG. Within naturalistic subgroups of ADHD cases, extended use of medication
was associated with suppression of adult height but not with reduction of symptom severity. Keywords: Attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder; follow-up studies; growth; longitudinal studies; treatment trials; medication effects.

 Introduction
The Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD),
known as the MTA, was initiated in 1994 (just
before release of DSM-IV) and continued until 2013
(just before release of DSM-5), spanning the entire
DSM-IV era. The background, design, methods, and
findings from childhood to adolescence have been
presented in over 100 publications (Appendix S1).
This
report
describes
outcomes
of
the
MTA
follow-up into adulthood (at an average age of
25 years).
The MTA began as a 14-month randomized clinical
trial (RCT) to test hypotheses about four treatment
strategies: medication management (Med), behavior
modification (Beh), their combination (Comb), or
treatment-as-usual for a community comparison
(CC). After diagnosis with ADHD-combined type, 579
children (7.0–9.9 years old) were randomly assigned
to treatment conditions and showed high compliance
and adherence to the MTA protocol. Intent-to-treat
(ITT) analyses revealed a significant relative benefit
(greater decline in ratings of symptom severity) as well
as relative cost (reduced height gain) in the groups
with (Med and Comb) compared to without (Beh and
CC) stimulant medication provided by-protocol for
14 months (MTA Cooperative Group, 1999).
After the RCT, the MTA transitioned into an
observational long-term follow-up (LTF), and analy-
ses were performed to generate hypotheses for future
studies (see Appendix S2). At 2 (MTA Group, 2004a,
2004b), 3 (Jensen et al., 2007), and 8 (Molina et al.,
2009) years after baseline, ITT analyses of the
randomly assigned groups were continued and indi-
cated
the
initial
symptom-related
benefit
and
growth-related cost dissipated after the 14-month
treatment-by-protocol phase. During the LTF phase,
medication use was monitored prospectively. This
documented different patterns of starting and stop-
ping medication resulting in convergence in the rates
of medication use across the assigned treatment
groups, generating the hypothesis that continued
relative benefit and cost may be associated with
continued use of medication (MTA Group, 2004b).
However, subsequent comparisons of naturalistic
subgroups (see Swanson et al., 2007) with different
patterns of extended treatment (i.e. no use, new use,
inconsistent use, and consistent use of medication in
childhood) showed that symptom severity was not
significantly different for these naturalistic sub-
groups. This generated the hypothesis that symp-
tom-related
benefit
may
dissipate
even
when
medication is continued. In contrast, childhood
height was reduced in the naturalistic subgroup
with
consistent
treatment.
This
generated
the
hypothesis that growth-related costs may not dissi-
pate when medication is continued.
Here, additional hypothesis-generating analyses
will be performed using adult outcomes based on the
final assessment of the MTA. Methods developed by
Swanson et al. (2001) will be used to focus on a
primary outcome, to limit the number of statistical
tests, and to apply contrast coding for planned
comparisons. The primary outcome, adult symptom
severity averaged across domains and sources, will
be used instead of many outcomes (to limit the
number of statistical tests). The end-point in adult-
hood will be analyzed, instead of trajectory into
adulthood (to simplify interpretation of findings).
Three planned comparisons of the four groups will be
used
instead
of
six
pair-wise
comparisons
(to
address efficiently the main questions): ‘Do symp-
toms persist into adulthood?’, ‘Is there a significant
long-term
symptom-related
benefit
(e.g.
reduced
symptom severity) of extended use of medication
compared to no use?’, and ‘Does continuous use of
medication result in greater benefit than interrupted
use?’.
Following
the
Consolidated
Standard
of
Reporting
Trials
(CONSORT)
revised
guidelines
(Ioanndis et al., 2004), parallel analyses will be
performed to address the same questions about
adult physical size and a possible growth-related
cost (i.e. suppressed adult height).
Methods
Ethical guidelines
This research met the ethical guidelines of the United States
National Institutes of Health and the multiple universities that
participated in the study, and it adhered to the legal require-
ments for research of the United States and Canada.
MTA sample
The CONSORT diagram of the MTA is presented in Table 1.
Entry into the LTF phase occurred 2 years after baseline, when
540 of the ADHD participants from the RCT phase were
assessed and 515 reconsented for the follow-up. At the same
time, 289 local normative comparison group (LNCG) partici-
pants were recruited from the same schools as the ADHD cases
and assessed with the same protocol. Following the precedent
set by Molina et al. (2009), 31 LNCG participants with a
diagnosis of ADHD at recruitment were excluded, so only 258
were included in the analyses reported here. Participants were
assessed eight times from 2 to 16 years after baseline. As
shown in Table 2, retention was high in childhood, adoles-
cence, and adulthood. Previous analyses of adult outcomes
(Howard et al., 2016) indicated MTA participants with and
without complete data were not significantly different on most
baseline demographic variables and ‘missing at random’
criteria were met.
Use of medication
Starting at the 14-month assessment and continuing through
the 10-year assessment (or until participants were 18 years of
age), the Services for Children and Adolescents Parent Inter-
view (SCAPI: Jensen et al., 2004) was administered. Part of
this interview documented the number of days treated with
stimulant medication and the daily doses administered since
the previous assessment. In most cases, the stimulant med-
ication was immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate (Ritalin�
or Metadate�, 50:50 racemic mixtures of the d- and l-isomers).

 Doses of other approved and available stimulants were trans-
formed to d,l-methylphenidate equivalent (ME) doses. For the
d-methylphenidate isomer (Focalin�), dose was multiplied by
2; for amphetamine (Dexedrine�, a pure d-isomer, or Adder-
all�, a 75:25 racemic mixture), the dose was multiplied by 2;
for pemoline (Cylert�), the dose was divided by 6. Sustained-
release (SR) formulations of d,l-methylphenidate (Ritalin SR�,
Concerta�, Ritalin LA�, and Metadate CD�) were included at
the prescribed doses, and prescribed doses of SR formulations
of d-methylphenidate (Focalin XR�) and amphetamine (Dexe-
drine Spansules� or Adderall XR�) were multiplied by 2. If an
IR and an SR formulation were administered on the same day,
the sum of daily ME doses was used. Nonstimulant medica-
tions were excluded. The total ME dose for each interval was
estimated as the product of the days treated times the daily
dose. The totals were summed for the six intervals from
baseline to the 10-year assessment to estimate the cumulative
ME dose from childhood through adolescence.
Furthermore, a minimum ME regimen (at least 10 mg/day
for at least 50% of days since the previous assessment) was
used to classify treatment during each assessment intervals as
‘≥ minimal’ or ‘< minimal’ (see Jensen et al., 2007). Rather than
representing adequate or optimal treatment for all cases, this
was intended to avoid exclusion of regimens based on low
doses that might be effective for a few cases and regimens with
medication administered only on school days (i.e. with planned
drug holidays). Extending a previous method (Swanson et al.,
2007), sequences of intervals above or below the cutoff were
used to define three long-term patterns of prospective treat-
ment with medication from childhood through adolescence:
Consistent (≥ minimal in all intervals), Inconsistent (≥ minimal
in some but not all intervals), and Negligible (< minimal in all
intervals). Prior use of medication before entering the MTA was
documented in the baseline assessment, but the SCAPI was
not administered at baseline to provide the same detailed
information on prior as for prospective treatment. Prior Status
was specified as a binary variable based on the presence
or absence of a history of prior treatment with stimulant
medication.
Outcomes
In adulthood (i.e. at assessments 12, 14, and 16 years after
baseline), the primary outcome was symptom severity mea-
sured by the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS:

 per-item
for
the
nine
Inattention
and
nine
Hyperac-
tive/Impulsive items were highly correlated with each other
(r ~.70 to .80), as well as with the overall average for the
18
ADHD
items
(r
~.90
to
.95).
After
decreasing
from
baseline, the symptom severity ratings were stable across
the three assessment points in adulthood, indicating an
asymptote in early adulthood. Correlations of adjacent points
in adulthood were high (r ~.61 to .76), indicating adequate
test–retest
reliability
in
adulthood.
At
each
assessment,
correlations of ratings from the two sources were significant
but low for the ADHD group (r ~.22 to .29) and LNCG
(r ~.26 to .47).
A composite measure (CAARS-avg) was created to reflect
symptom persistence in adulthood by averaging parent- and
self-ratings to capture source convergence (Kraemer et al.,
2003) and to increase precision of measurement (Swanson
et al., 2001). Typically, self-ratings by children with ADHD are
lower than parent-ratings (see Owens, Goldfine, Evangelista,
Hoza, & Kaiser, 2007), but it is unclear whether the difference
continues (see Sibley et al., 2012) or dissipates (see Barkley,
Murphy, & Fischer, 2008) in adulthood. To evaluate this, a
second composite measure (CAARS-diff) was created to reflect
source divergence by taking the difference of parent- and self-
ratings of symptom severity.
At clinic visits, MTA staff measured height (in cm) with
stadiometers, as well as weight (in kg) with digital scales. For
comparison to critical studies in the literature (i.e. Spencer,
Biederman, & Wilens, 1998 and Swanson et al., 2007), norms
for the United States (Kuczmarski et al., 2002) were used to
transform the absolute (raw score) to a relative (z-score)
measure adjusted for age and sex.
Analyses
Using the statistical analysis system (SAS, Cary, NC) general
linear model (GLM) program, simple one-way analyses of the
primary
outcome
(CAARS-avg)
and
secondary
outcome
(Height-cm) were performed, using a between-group factor
with four levels: Consistent, Inconsistent, Negligible, and
LNCG. Sex and Age were included to evaluate possible gender
and developmental effects. For Height-cm, Mid-Parent height
(average z-score) was included to account for expected genetic
effects. Comparisons of the groups were made using the SAS-
GLM estimates of least square means (LSMs) adjusted for the
other factors in the model.
To decompose a significant Group effect, three planned
comparisons (see Appendix S3) were used instead of six (all
possible) paired-comparisons. This limited the number of
comparisons and addressed critical questions specified in the
literature. As recommended by Barkley et al. (2008), a norm-
based comparison (i.e. ADHD vs. LNCG) was used to provide
an estimate of symptom persistence in adulthood. As recom-
mended by Spencer et al. (1998, p. 503), a comparison of
‘. . . treated children with ADHD with untreated children, and
not with unaffected control subjects’ was used to differentiate
treatment and disorder effects, with the treated group repre-
sented by the pooled naturalistic subgroups with Consistent or
Inconsistent treatment and the untreated group represented
by the naturalistic subgroup with Negligible treatment. As
recommended by Faraone, Biederman, Morley, and Spencer
(2008, p 994), to evaluate ‘. . . continuous treatment from
childhood to adulthood’ the group with treatment through age
18 (the naturalistic subgroup with Consistent treatment) was
comparedtoagroupwithinterruptedtreatment(thenaturalistic
subgroup with Inconsistent treatment). Each comparison
represents a difference between two groups, which was stan-
dardizedbydividingbythepooledstandarddeviation(RMSE,the
square root of the mean square error in the model defined for the
SAS-GLM analysis of the outcome measure) to estimate effect
size (Cohen’s d).
Within the ADHD group, supplementary regression analyses
were performed to address effects of cumulative ME dose on
adult outcomes. This approach was suggested by Charach,
Figueroa, Chen, Ickowicz, and Schachar (2006, p 419), who
proposed that height suppression would not ‘. . . become
statistically significant until the dose of MPH is ≥2.5 mg/kg/
day for ≥4 years’. In the MTA, cumulative ME dose was specified
as absolute instead of relative dose, and escalation over time
with increasing size was not observed, as implied by the
longitudinal mg/kg dose. For a typical case in the MTA (e.g.
an 8.4-year old with an average weight of 30.5 kg at baseline),
the high 2.5 mg/kg dose would be 76.5 mg/day. For 4 years,
this would result in a cumulative ME dose of 111,325 mg, but
over 10 years the cumulative ME dose would be much higher
(i.e. 278,313 mg). To accommodate such a wide range (e.g. 0–
300,000 mg), cumulative ME dose was dividing by 10,000, and
the natural logarithm (after adding 1 to avoid 0) was used as
the predictor in the regression analysis. As in the analyses
of Group (see above), Age and Sex were included as factors
in the regression analyses of CAARS-avg and Height-cm,
and also Mid-Parent Height was included in the analysis of
Height-cm.
Results
By the 12-year assessment point, all participants in
the MTA were beyond age 18 (and thus in adulthood),
so retention was based on the percentage having at
least one observation from this point forward. This
was higher than the percentage observed at any one
assessment point, as some participants returned to
the follow-up after missing an earlier assessment. As
shown in Table 2a, observations in adulthood were
available for 92.4% (476/515) of the ADHD and
93.4% (241/258) of the non-ADHD LNCG partici-
pants consented for the LTF, representing 82.2%
(476/579 for the ADHD group) and 83.4% (241/289
for the LNCG) of those recruited for the study. The
final assessments in adulthood were used for all
participants, which were primarily from the 16-year
assessment (88.0% for the ADHD group and 92.1%
for the LNCG), with progressively fewer from the 14-
year (8.6% and 5.8%) and 12-year (3.4% and 2.8%)
assessment points.
Prospectively gathered information from the SCAPI
was used to estimate patterns of extended use of
medication for the 476 ADHD cases. As shown in
Table 2b,
in
adolescence
there
was
a
fourfold
decrease in the overall percentage of the ADHD
cases with >minimal medication use at successive
assessment points (i.e. from 59.2% at the 3-year
assessment to 14.3% at the 10-year assessment).
For the individual patterns based on sequences of
use from childhood (baseline) through adolescence,
23.5% of the ADHD cases had the Negligible pattern
(< minimal in all intervals), 69.1% had the Inconsis-
tent pattern (≥minimal in some but not all intervals),
and 7.4% had the Consistent pattern (≥minimal in all
intervals). For these naturalistic subgroups, the
prospective
average
cumulative
ME
doses
were
2,153, 60,567, and 117,102 mg.

 use were dramatically different for the four assigned
treatment groups (e.g. 90.2% for Med to 13.9% for
Beh), but then converged in adolescence, resulting
in 10-year averages for cumulative ME dose that
were similar but not identical (e.g. 58,986 mg for
Med and 41,140 mg for Beh). Before performing the
analyses of naturalistic subgroups, ITT analyses of
the initially assigned treatment groups were per-
formed to evaluate possible ‘sleeper effects’. How-
ever, there were no reemergent significant assigned

differences:

(see Table 2b).
As shown in Table 2c, the naturalistic subgroups
did not differ significantly on most demographic
variables
assessed
in
the
children
at
baseline,
including age at entry into the MTA, percentage
male, symptom severity (except for slightly lower
parent-ratings
for
the
Negligible
subgroup),
or
birthweight. However, the naturalistic subgroups
differed (p < .05) on some of the demographic vari-
ables: the Consistent naturalistic subgroup had
significantly higher family income, greater house-
hold advantages, and higher percentage of White
participants. The LNCG differed from the overall
ADHD group and was similar to the Consistent
naturalistic
subgroup
with
higher
income
and
greater household advantages. As these differences
were not predicted or considered during the design
phase of the MTA to set the sample size and
statistical power (see Kraemer, 2015), these vari-
ables were not included initially as covariates, but
subsequently
they
were
included
separately
as
possible moderators of findings in the initial anal-
yses of the outcome variables.
Analysis of primary and secondary outcomes
The
analyses
of
symptom
severity
(CAARS-avg
and CAARS-diff) and adult height (Height-cm and
Height-z) outcomes are shown in Table 3. The three
planned comparisons (ADHD vs. LNCG; Consistent
or Inconsistent vs. Negligible; Consistent vs. Incon-
sistent) are shown in Table 3 (for more detail, see
Appendix S3). The observed means and standard
deviations for the four levels of the between-group
factor (as well as for the overall ADHD group based
on the pooled naturalistic subgroups) are shown in
Figure 1.
The
SAS-GLM
analyses
also
provided
estimates of LSMs (estimates of marginal means
over a balanced population) as well as observed
means. The LSMs (see Table 3, footnotes c and f)
were used for the planned comparisons.
In the analysis of CAARS-avg, the Group factor
was significant (p < .0001), but effects of Age and
Sex were not significant. As shown in Table 3a and
Figure 1a, the comparison of diagnostic groups
(ADHD vs. LNCG) was significant (p < .0001), due
to a higher value for the parent/self-report average
rating in the ADHD group than the LNCG (by
0.51 � 0.04), with a large effect size (d = 1.11).
Within the ADHD group, the medication-related
comparisons of the naturalistic subgroups were not
significant. In analyses of CAARS-diff, the Group
factor was significant, and the ADHD-LNCG com-
parison revealed significant (p < .0001) parent/self-
report discrepancy (by 0.21 � 0.04), with a medium
effect size (d = .61), due to higher parent- than self-
ratings in the ADHD group but not in the LNCG (see
Figure 1a). Within the overall ADHD group, the two
medication-related comparisons of the naturalistic
subgroups were not significant.
In analysis of Height-cm, the effect of the Group
factor was significant (p < .0001). Age was not signif-
icant, as expected in adulthood (age 25) when final
height has been achieved, but Sex and Mid-Parent
Height were significant. As shown in Table 3b and
Figure 1b, the ADHD group was significantly (p < .01)
shorter than the LNCG (by 1.29 � 0.55 cm or about
0.51 of an inch) with a small effect size (d = .21).
Within the overall ADHD group, the two medication-
related comparisons of the naturalistic subgroups
were significant with small to medium effect sizes for
Height-cm: (a) the average was significantly (p <
.0005, d = .42) lower for the treated ADHD group
(the pooled Consistent and Inconsistent subgroups)
compared to the Negligible subgroup (by 2.55 �
0.73 cm or about 1 inch) and (b) the average was
significantly (p < .0378, d = .38) lower for the Con-
sistent
compared
to
Inconsistent
subgroup
(by
2.36 � 1.13 cm or about 0.93 inch). To supplement
the three planned comparisons, the six paired-
comparisons are provided in Appendix S3, which
show a 4.7 cm difference between the extreme sub-
groups (Consistent vs. Negligible).
Analyses of Height-z showed similar significance
levels and effect sizes for relative height (see Table 3b
and Figure 1c) as for absolute height adjusted for
Sex and Age. The Negligible subgroup had a LSM of
0.434, which indicated that the ‘untreated’ clinical
control group was taller than the population average
(z-score = 0). In the previous report (Swanson et al.,
2007), a speculative hypothesis was proposed that
the larger-than-average size of the untreated ADHD
cases may be associated with a theoretical biological
factor (a dopamine deficit), which is expected to
increase growth. However, also the LNCG was taller
than the population average (with a LSM of 0.351),
confirming a previous finding in childhood (Swanson
et al., 2007) and suggesting secular factors (e.g. the
recruitment methods, the site locations, etc.) con-
tributed to increased height compared to the popu-
lation average.

aRatings of symptom severity by both sources were required for the composite scores (Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS)
parent/self-report-average and parent/self-report difference). Ratings from both sources were available in adulthood for n = 233
participants in the local normative comparison group (LNCG) (90.5%) and for n = 439 participants in the attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) group (85.2%), with n = 102 (N), n = 307 (I), and n = 30 (C) in the subgroups.
bAnalyses were performed with SAS-GLM program, using the end-point observations in adulthood for each participant. For the
Group factor, four levels were used: LNCG (L), Negligible (N), Inconsistent (I), and Consistent (C).
cThe GLM least square mean (LSM) estimates of symptom severity (adjusted for other factors in the model) for the four groups were
C = 0.929, I = 0.940, N = 0.876, L = 0.420 (for CAARS-avg) and C = 0.198, I = 0.159, N = 0.138, L = �0.055 (for CAARS-diff).
dFor the three comparisons, contrast coding was used to combine the four LSM estimates, with the LSMs either equally
(‘unweighted’) or proportionally weighted by the subgroup sample size/total sample size of the subgroups being combined (see
Appendix S2). In the GLM analyses, the ‘root mean square error’ (RMSE) for CAARS-avg was 0.4619, for CAARS-diff was 0.3483, for
Height-cm was 6.145 and for Height-z was 0.8816.
eSome participants were assessed by telephone instead of at a clinic visit. Clinic visits occurred and height was measured for
n = 221 of the LNCG (85.7%) and n = 402 of the ADHD group (78.1%), with n = 92 (N), n = 276 (I), and n = 33 (C) in the subgroups.
fThe LSM estimates of adult height for the four groups were C = 168.3, I = 170.7, N = 173.0, L = 172.3 (for Height-cm) and
C = �0.226, I = 0.106, N = 0.434, and L = 0.351 (for Height-z).
gThese analyses included the ADHD participants with information from the Services for Children and Adolescents Parent Interview
(SCAPI) on the use of medication. As described in the text, the natural logarithm of cumulative ME dose of medication (after dividing

 added (whether they were significant or not), and
significance levels and effect sizes for outcome vari-
ables were essentially unchanged.
Weight-kg was not a primary outcome, but explora-
tory analyses revealed that the ADHD group was
significantly (p < .0001) heavier (by 4.6 � 1.78 kg)
than the LNCG (see Figure 1b). Unlike for Height-cm,
the medication-related comparisons of naturalistic
subgroups were not significant (p > .05). Analyses of
BMI-m/kg2 paralleled those for Weight-kg, with

 significantly higher body mass for the ADHD group
than the LNCG, but neither comparison of the
naturalistic subgroups was significant. Analyses of
relative measures showed similar significance levels
and effect sizes as analyses of absolute measures
adjusted for Sex and Age.
The naturalistic subgroups were divided further
based on history of prior use of medication before
entry into the MTA (Prior Status, see Table 2b). The
naturalistic subgroups differed in the percentage of
participants with prior treatment with medication
(28% for Negligible, 41% for Inconsistent, and 67%
for Consistent). Prior Status was added as a factor in
analyses with three levels of Group (without the
LNCG). Neither Prior Status nor its interaction with
Group was significant in any of the analyses of adult
outcome (see Appendix S4).
Regression analyses
Regression analyses of cumulative ME dose in the
ADHD group are shown in Table 3c for adult height.
Scatter plots of the observed outcomes are presented
for CAARS-avg (Figure 2a), Height-cm (Figure 2b),
and Height-z (Figure 2c). For CAARS-avg, the slope
was positive but not significant (+0.04 � 0.03 cm/
ln-unit, p = .14), suggesting cumulative ME dose
was not related to symptom severity in adult-
hood (see Figure 2a). Neither Age nor Sex was
significant.
For Height-cm, the slope was negative and signif-
icant (�1.02 + 0.34 cm/ln-unit, p < .003), suggest-
ing an increase in cumulative dose was associated
with lower adult height (see Figure 2b). For a cumu-
lative ME dose of 100,000 mg, the regression equa-
tion predicts height suppression in adulthood of
2.4 � 0.33 cm or almost an inch. Age was not
significant, but Sex was significant (with female
participants 14.26 cm shorter on average than male
participants – see Table 3c). Regression analysis of
the relative measure adjusted for age and sex
(Height-z, see Figure 2c) showed a similar effect of
cumulative ME dose (i.e. a significant slope) as in the
analysis of the absolute measure (Height-cm) with
Age and Sex included as factors.
Analyses with covariates added for Income, House-
hold
Advantage,
and
Race/Ethnicity
were
per-
formed,
but
none
of
these
were
significant
or
changed the findings. Analyses were repeated with
Prior Status (and its interaction with cumulative ME
dose) added as predictors, but neither was signifi-
cant (see Appendix S4).
In additional analyses for weight and body mass,
the slopes were not significant for raw scores (Weight-
kg and BMI-m/kg2) or for standard scores (Weight-z
and BMI-z), suggesting cumulative ME doses was not
related to these outcome measures in adulthood.
These findings are consistent with the nonsignificant
medication-related comparisons of the ADHD sub-
groups for these outcomes (Figure 1).
Discussion
The findings from LTF phase of the MTA address the
three critical questions specified in the introduction
about
long-term
symptom-related
and
growth-
related outcomes of children with ADHD and about
possible long-term benefits (adult symptom reduc-
tion) and costs (adult height suppression) associated
with the treatment of ADHD with stimulant medica-
tion. First, comparisons of the ADHD group to con-
temporary
(as
well
as
prospective)
norms
from
unaffected classmates (the LNCG) suggest significant
persistence of the disorder due to higher levels of
symptom severity in adulthood. Second, the compar-
isons of ADHD-treated and ADHD-untreated groups
suggest that in the long-term, symptom-related ben-
efit of treatment with medication may dissipate and
not remain significant but growth-related cost may
remain statistically significant in adulthood. Third,
the comparisons of groups with continuous and
interrupted
use
of
medication
from
childhood
through adolescence suggest greater treatment may
not result in greater symptom-related benefit but may
result in greater growth-related cost. These findings
add to the literature and to some controversies about
long-term outcomes and long-term effects of treat-
ment of ADHD.
The
significant
symptom
persistence
effect
described here was based on a dimensional outcome
(a scaled outcome based on effect size) instead of a
traditional categorical outcome (a binary outcome
based on a cutoff). Kraemer and Kupfer (2006)
discussed issues about when each of these alterna-
tive approaches should be used, and described the
decision as a ‘. . . struggle between statistical consid-
erations favoring dimensional outcomes and clinical
consideration favoring categorical outcomes’. One
reason for using the dimensional approach was to
maximize statistical power for detecting possible
long-term benefits and costs of medication. A cate-
gorical approach (based on symptom count rather
than symptom severity) was presented in a compan-
ion article to enhance clinical relevance related to
symptom persistence. Sibley et al. (2017) described
persistence rates for combinations of three factors:
cutoff criteria (six symptoms for DSM-IV, five for
DSM-5, and four for statistical norms), source (par-
ent-report or self-report), and method (interview or
rating scale). A broad range (from 1.9% to 61.4%)
highlighted the controversy about which combina-
tion to use. Hechtman et al. (2016) evaluated the
validity of one combination that is currently clini-
cally relevant (DSM-5 criteria, rating scale method,
and combined sources, with a persistence rate of
49.9%) and showed significant differences between
Persistent and Desistent subgroups on functional
adult outcomes assessed in the MTA (educational,
occupational,
sexual,
emotional,
and
substance
use). These large dimensional and categorical effects
of symptom persistence are consistent with the

 notion that ADHD is a chronic condition. This adds
to the controversy about the magnitude of persis-
tence of ADHD in adulthood, which depends on how
it is measured (see Barkley, Fischer, Smallish, &
Fletcher, 2002 and Faraone, Biederman, & Mick,
2006). Also, this confirmed other findings in the

 literature on the effect of stimulant medication on
persistence of ADHD, which was not significant in
one
of
the
earliest
long-term
follow-up
studies
(Weiss, Kruger, Danielson, & Elman, 1975) or in
one of the most recent (Biederman, Petty, Clarke,
Lomedico, & Faraone, 2011).
The
significant
source
discrepancy
effect
described here adds to the literature on another
controversial
issue.
For
example,
Barkley
et al.
(2008) followed (to age 27) a group of 158 cases
(diagnosed with hyperactivity in 1979–1980 before
the criteria were established for diagnosing ADHD)
and 81 nonaffected controls, and concluded ‘. . . self-
reported information [converges with] parent/other
reported information’ (p. 66), but Sibley et al. (2012)
followed (to age 20) a group of 200 cases (diagnosed
with ADHD from 1986 to 1997) and 121 nonaffected
controls, and
concluded ‘. . .
young adults with
ADHD tended to underreport symptoms’ (p. 1). If
source convergence occurs, when is this mani-
fested? As reported here for the MTA, using a larger
sample,
a
dimensional
outcome
with
statistical
advantages, and follow-up to age 25, source dis-
crepancy was still significant in adulthood. For
categorical outcomes, Sibley et al. (2017) also found
symptom persistence to be 40–137% higher for
parent-report than self-report depending on the
combination of factors used to classify cases. These
findings from the MTA are consistent with the
hypothesis that self-report of symptoms remains
far below parent-report in early adulthood (at least
to age 25).
The significant height suppression effect described
here adds to the controversy about a possible growth-
related cost of long-term use of medication. The
findings from the MTA are not consistent with many
LTF studies in the literature (see below), but they are
consistent with a recent study that was based on
similar methods. Poulton et al. (2013) described a
small clinical sample (n = 22 ADHD cases) selected
for consistent use of medication from childhood to
adolescence (i.e. average ME dose starting at 46 mg/
day with continuous treatment for an average of
7 years,
suggesting
a
cumulative
ME
dose
of
117,530 mg). For this naturalistic subgroup, average
adolescent height (assessed between 14 and 16 years
of age) was significantly (p < .01) lower (by 2.7 cm or
more than an inch) than for a non-ADHD group
(n = 132). For an equivalent comparison in the MTA,
the
height
of
Consistent
naturalistic
subgroup
(n = 33) – with about the same cumulative ME dose
(117,102 mg) – was compared to a non-ADHD group,
the LNCG (n = 221). Average height in adulthood was
significantly (p < 0,001, d = .65) lower (by 4.0 cm or
about 1.5 inch). This replicates and extends the
findings of Poulton et al. (2013) with a larger sample
and longer follow-up.
The discrepancy with other LTF studies in the
literature may be related to changes in the clinical
use
of
medication
over
the
past
50 years
and
differences in the average cumulative ME dose for
treatment-as-usual. For example, most studies of
ADHD and growth report average ME daily dose
(mg/day) and average duration (years) for treated
cases, and for some often-cited studies, the product
provides an estimate of cumulative ME dose. For a
clinical sample recruited in the 1960s (Kramer et al.,
2000), the product (31.2 mg/day 9 3.02 years) was
34,350 mg. For a clinical sample recruited in the
1970s
(Klein
&
Mannuzza,
1988),
the
product
(44.9 mg/day 9 2.24 years) was 36,710 mg, indi-
cating a slight increase in cumulative ME dose. For a
population-based sample of ADHD cases identified
from an epidemiological cohort in the 1980s (Har-
stad
et al.,
2014),
the
product
(26.2 mg 9
4.42 years) was 42,268 mg, indicating a substantial
increase in cumulative ME dose over the decade
from 1970 to 1980. However, none of these studies
reported a significant difference in adult height
between the treatment-as-usual ADHD group and a
non-ADHD control group. To match the methods of
these historical studies, the pooled group of treated
cases with the Inconsistent or Consistent pattern
(i.e. with treatment-as-usual in the LTF during the
1990s and 2000s) was considered. The cumulative
ME
dose
was
66,003 mg,
representing
a
92%
increase from the 1960s, an 80% increase from the
1970s, and a 56% increase from the 1980s. Com-
pared to the LNCG, adult height was significantly
lower (by 2.0 cm, p < .01), suggesting height sup-
pression with a small to medium effect size (d = .32).
The cumulative exposure hypothesis (see Charach
et al., 2006) and this post hoc finding from the MTA
generate a hypothesis about the discrepancy with
previous studies: a secular trend of increasing
cumulative ME dose occurred from the 1960s to
the 1990s, and in the MTA (initiated in the 1990s),
the average exposure was sufficient to produce
significant height suppression in cases treated with
medication.
The MTA findings generate hypotheses about other
prominent studies that do not report cumulative ME
dose. For example, based on a 10-year follow-up in a
study initiated in the 1980s, Biederman, Spencer,
Monuteaux, and Faraone et al. (2010) reported that
duration of treatment (dose was not available) was
not significantly related to adult height. However, in
a previous report on substance use outcomes in the
male subjects, Biederman et al. (2008) reported that
27% of the ADHD cases were untreated, but this
naturalistic subgroup was not excluded or compared
to the treated subgroup as recommended by Spencer
et al. (1998). Furthermore, they reported that many
of the participants (50%) were treated for <2 years,
suggesting 23% of the sample had extended use of
medication for 2 years or more. The MTA findings
generate the hypothesis that in a post hoc analysis,
the naturalistic subgroup of males with extended
use of medication would show height suppression
compared to the clinical control group of untreated

11
 cases. In addition, consider the example provided by
Peyre et al. (2013). In a large representative sample
of over 35,000 adults identified in 2004–2005, adult
ADHD cases with (n = 216) and without (n = 591)
use of stimulant medication were identified. Peyre
et al. (2013) reported that these subgroups did not
differ in adult height. However, they also reported
the
average
age
of
treatment
initiation
was
15.9 years, which likely resulted in a high percent-
age of cases with treatment only after most growth
was attained. The MTA findings generate the hypoth-
esis that a subgroup of cases with treatment initiated
in childhood and continued through adolescence
would show height suppression. Thus, findings from
the MTA suggest alternative analyses that may be
warranted before accepting the null hypothesis that
extended use of medication does not suppress adult
height.
Implications for guidelines
The most recently published guidelines (American
Academy of Pediatrics, 2011) recommend expanding
the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD and using
stimulant medication as first-line treatment for ado-
lescents as well as school-aged children. As this
would increase the average duration of treatment
and cumulative ME dose of medication in some
individuals, the MTA findings suggest growth-related
costs may increase. This possibility may need addi-
tional emphasis, similar to the contemporary Euro-
pean guidelines for managing adverse side effects of
medication for ADHD (Graham et al., 2011), which
presciently highlight this relevant issue: ‘It is possi-
ble that the effects of stimulants on growth are dose-
dependent. Significant effects on weight and height
may
require
average
doses
of
methylphenidate
exceeding 1.5 mg/kg per day which are given con-
tinuously’ (p 24). The regression analyses of the MTA
support this speculation. Revised guidelines could
address strategies for reducing cumulative ME dose.
In the RCT phase of the MTA, combining behavioral
intervention with the use of medication reduced
average daily dose by 20% without a reduction in
efficacy (see Vitiello et al., 2001), and recently,
Pelham et al. (2016) showed that initiating treatment
with low-intensity psychosocial treatment before
adding medication reduced the daily dose on school
days by 25% without a reduction in efficacy. The
findings of the MTA suggest that these strategies –
which appear to achieve full short-term symptom-
related benefits in childhood – may reduce long-term
growth-related costs in adulthood.
Limitations
First, as for any observational study, the findings
from the LTF phase of the MTA should be used to
generate hypotheses and not be interpreted as tests
of hypotheses. Without protection by randomization,
the suggestions based on comparisons of naturalis-
tic subgroups are speculative, both for significant
effects and for nonsignificant effects. It remains
unclear how much selection or confounding factors
contribute to or account for the findings reported
here. For example, the cases receiving consistent
treatment with medication may have been the most
severe cases based on factors not evaluated in the
MTA, and if so, this could have masked benefit.
Therefore, the possibility of long-term symptom-
related benefits should not be excluded by the
hypothesis-generating analyses of the LTF phase of
the MTA. Instead, the findings should be used to
design future studies to test refined hypotheses
about alternative treatments and to identify alterna-
tive follow-up methods that may reveal some long-
term benefits of medication in some cases in some
conditions.
Second, with alternative designs, the findings of
the MTA may have been different. For example,
treatment provided as usual in the follow-up likely
resulted in lower doses and fewer adjustments than
treatment-by-protocol would have provided. If treat-
ment according to the MTA medication algorithm
had continued (including monthly 30-minute physi-
cian visits, with adjustments to the medication
regimen based on regular review of current status
based on parent and teacher ratings), the significant
relative benefit of medication observed in the RCT
phase (relative reduction of symptom severity) may
have persisted into early adulthood. In addition, the
acute effect of medication in adulthood was not
evaluated.
For
example,
a
placebo
substitution
manipulation was not used to evaluate the cases
that continued to use medication in adulthood. If
this design had been incorporated into the LTF
phase of the MTA, support for continued benefit of
medication may have emerged due to increased
symptom severity on placebo, even though when on
medication, overall symptom severity may not have
been reduced compared to other subgroups.
Third, the nonsignificant effect of medication on the
primary outcome reported here (symptom severity)
may not hold for other outcomes. Other studies have
reported long-term benefits of stimulant medication
on nonsymptom outcomes, including reduction in
substance use in adolescence (e.g. see Wilens, Far-
aone, Biederman, & Gunawardene, 2003 for a review).
However, apparent protective effects in adolescence
may not be manifested later in adulthood (see Bieder-
man et al., 2008). Mannuzza et al. (2008) suggested
that a protective effect on substance use in adulthood
may depend on starting stimulant medication early,
and this hypothesis was supported by recent epi-
demiological studies of medication records in Norway
(Dalsgaard, Mortensen, Frydenberg, & Thomsen,
2014) and a high-school survey in the United States
(McCabe, Dickinson, Brady, West, & Wilens, 2016).

hood are in progress.

 Fourth, the large symptom persistence effect and
the medium source discrepancy effect reported here
were based on the CAARS rating scale, which in the
nonclinical population (i.e. the LNCG) is not nor-
mally distributed. The impact of this on the signif-
icance
levels
and
effect
sizes
reported
here
is
unclear. Further evaluation of this is planned for
future reports. These effects were also observed in
early adulthood (at an average age of 25 years), and
if the MTA LTF had been continued into midadult-
hood, it is possible that smaller or nonsignificant
effects of symptom persistence and source discrep-
ancy may have been observed (see Klein et al., 2012).
Fifth, the significant association of extended use of
medication with suppressed adult height may not be
causal. The formation of naturalistic subgroups
using SCAPI-based sequences of extended use of
medication may have resulted in selection biases or
confounding
(see
Hernan,
Hernandez-Diaz,
&
Robins, 2004) related to physical size as well as to
severity (see above). For unknown reasons, selective
treatment of ADHD cases that are constitutionally
short may have occurred. If so, then the height
suppression reported here would be due to charac-
teristics of the treated cases rather than to their
treatment with medication. An analysis was per-
formed to evaluate the possible association of future
use of medication with the baseline height of the
naturalistic subgroups described here (i.e. before
pattern of medication use could have caused height
suppression). This did not show a significant effect
of prospective medication use on baseline height,
but the sample size of the MTA was not sufficient to
evaluate fully multiple factors and their possible
interactions (age, sex, maturation, and prior use of
medication).
A
previous
analysis
(see
Swanson
et al., 2007) noted that among the ADHD cases
without a history of prior use of medication before
entry into the MTA, those remaining untreated
prospectively during childhood were already about
1 cm taller at baseline than those destined to receive
consistent prospective treatment. To compensate for
this, Swanson et al. (2007) suggested a reduction in
estimates of medication-related height suppression
in late childhood by 1 cm (i.e. from about 3 to 2 cm).
A similar adjustment may be prudent for estimates
of height suppression in adulthood.
Sixth, the lack of complete information on prior
medication use limited the analysis of this important
factor (see Poulton & Nanan, 2008). In analyses of
the naturalistic subgroups, neither the main effect of
Prior Status nor the interaction of Prior and Prospec-
tive use of medication in the MTA (defined by
different patterns of extended use by the naturalistic
subgroups or by cumulative ME dose) had a signif-
icant effect on adult height. However, the direction of
small effects (lower intercept and reduced slope in
cases with a history of prior use of medication)
suggests with a larger sample, the effect of Prior
Status may reach significance.
Seventh, timing of treatment may affect growth
mediated by different underlying biological pro-
cesses (e.g. growth hormone and sex hormones).
Differential exposure to medication during child-
hood and adolescence were not evaluated here, as
suggested by the tempo hypothesis proposed by
Spencer et al. (1998). Also, analyses using mathe-
matical modeling to identify effects of medication on
milestones of growth (i.e. height, height velocity,
and age of the ‘take-off’ or ‘peak’ points of the
adolescent growth spurt) were not reported here.
Analyses of trajectory of height from childhood to
adulthood (rather than analyses of the adult end-
point) may provide additional information on mech-
anisms
involved
in
suppression
of
final
adult
height. These possibilities will be addressed in
future reports.
Eighth, outcomes related to weight and body mass
were considered secondary here. In the limited
analyses of these outcomes, the findings from the
planned comparisons are consistent with the find-
ings from some studies in the literature about
disorder-related effects, such as those suggesting
adults with ADHD are at risk for obesity (see Cortese
et al., 2008), overweight (see Hanc et al., 2014), and
increased body mass (Schwartz et al., 2014). How-
ever, the findings from the MTA generate the hypoth-
esis that extended use of medication in childhood
and adolescence may increase adult BMI by sup-
pressing adult height but not adult weight.
Ninth, the SCAPI was used to establish the natu-
ralistic subgroups, but the use of this instrument
has several limitations. The SCAPI was a new mea-
sure developed for the MTA, and information was not
available on reliability and validity of parent reports
of medication use. The parent-based interview was
not administered after the age of 18 years, so infor-
mation on use of medication in adulthood was not
obtained. The SCAPI-based patterns of extended
medication use were based on logical analysis of all
possible sequences across the assessment intervals
from childhood through adolescence, and recently
developed
data-driven
classification
methods
to
establish subgroups with different trajectories of
medication use (see Schweren et al., 2016) were
not evaluated here.
Conclusions
The observational LTF phase of the MTA generated
hypotheses that could be tested in future studies. The
findings of the MTA suggest the following: childhood-
onset ADHD is a chronic disorder with persistence of
symptoms into adulthood; source discrepancy due to
lower self-ratings than parent-ratings is manifested
in early adulthood; and extended use of stimulant
medication from childhood through adolescence is
associated with suppression of adult height but is
not associated with reduced symptom severity in
adulthood.

 Key points
• ADHD is a chronic disorder that persists into adulthood in some cases, but the magnitude of persistence has
been unclear. Also, when initiated in childhood, stimulant medication has clear benefits (e.g. reduced
symptom severity) that may outweigh costs (e.g. reduced height gain), but the long-term effects of extended
use of medication on these outcomes have been unclear.
• The MTA follow-up provides an opportunity to explore long-term outcome of ADHD and effects of long-term
treatment with stimulant medication. The findings reported here indicate:
○ In comparison to local norms, a group of cases with childhood-onset ADHD-combined type showed high
levels of symptom severity that persisted into adulthood.
○ Treatment-as-usual with stimulants in community settings did not alter symptom severity (or symptom
persistence), but it was associated with slight height suppression in adulthood.
○ Extended use of medication consistently from childhood to adulthood occurred in <10% of ADHD cases,
and this pattern of adherence to medication was associated with greater suppression of adult height but
still no relative reduction in symptom severity in adulthood.
• Short-term treatment with stimulant medication seems to be well justified by benefits that outweigh costs, but
long-term treatment may be associated with residual growth-related costs that may not be balanced by
residual symptom-related benefits in adulthood.
