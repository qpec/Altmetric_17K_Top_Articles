Summary
Background Reliable information on the incidence of induced abortion in India is lacking. Official statistics and 
national surveys provide incomplete coverage. Since the early 2000s, medication abortion has become increasingly 
available, improving the way women obtain abortions. The aim of this study was to estimate the national incidence of 
abortion and unintended pregnancy for 2015.
Methods National abortion incidence was estimated through three separate components: abortions (medication and 
surgical) in facilities (including private sector, public sector, and non-governmental organisations [NGOs]); medication 
abortions outside facilities; and abortions outside of facilities and with methods other than medication abortion. 
Facility-based abortions were estimated from the 2015 Health Facilities Survey of 4001 public and private health 
facilities in six Indian states (Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh) and from 
NGO clinic data. National medication abortion drug sales and distribution data were obtained from IMS Health and 
six principal NGOs (DKT International, Marie Stopes International, Population Services International, World Health 
Partners, Parivar Seva Santha, and Janani). We estimated the total number of abortions that are not medication 
abortions and are not obtained in a health facility setting through an indirect technique based on findings from 
community-based study findings in two states in 2009, with adjustments to account for the rapid increase in use of 
medication abortion since 2009. The total number of women of reproductive age and livebirth data were obtained 
from UN population data, and the proportion of births from unplanned pregnancies and data on contraceptive use 
and need were obtained from the 2015–16 National Family Health Survey-4.
Findings We estimate that 15·6 million abortions (14·1 million–17·3 million) occurred in India in 2015. The abortion 
rate was 47·0 abortions (42·2–52·1) per 1000 women aged 15–49 years. 3·4 million abortions (22%) were obtained in 
health facilities, 11·5 million (73%) abortions were medication abortions done outside of health facilities, and 
0·8 million (5%) abortions were done outside of health facilities using methods other than medication abortion. 
Overall, 12·7 million (81%) abortions were medication abortions, 2·2 million (14%) abortions were surgical, and 
0·8 million (5%) abortions were done through other methods that were probably unsafe. We estimated 
48·1 million pregnancies, a rate of 144·7 pregnancies per 1000 women aged 15–49 years, and a rate of 70·1 unintended 
pregnancies per 1000 women aged 15–49 years. Abortions accounted for one third of all pregnancies, and nearly half 
of pregnancies were unintended.
Interpretation Health facilities can have a greater role in abortion service provision and provide quality care, 
including post-abortion contraception. Interventions are needed to expand access to abortion services through better 
equipping existing facilities, ensuring adequate and continuous supplies of medication abortion drugs, and by 
increasing the number of trained providers. In view of how many women rely on self-administration of medication 
abortion drugs, interventions are needed to provide women with accurate information on these drugs and follow-up 
care when needed. Research is needed to test interventions that improve knowledge and practice in providing 
medication abortion, and the Indian Government at the national and state level needs to prioritise improving policies 
and practice to increase access to comprehensive abortion care and quality contraceptive services that prevent 
unintended pregnancy.

Introduction
Reliable, current information on the incidence of induced 
abortion 
in 
India 
is 
not 
available. 
The 
only 
two approximate national estimates1,2 that exist are now 
very dated. In 2010–14, the abortion incidence in the 
south and central Asian subregion, which includes India, 
was estimated to be 37 abortions per 1000 women aged 
15–44 years.3 However, this study did not provide country-
level measures, and its modelled estimates are affected 
by data from all countries in each subregion and by

available country-level data. Statistics compiled by the 
Indian Government on the number of abortions provided 
in facilities are known to greatly underestimate abortion 
incidence because coverage of facility-based services is 
incomplete and in addition, many abortions occur 
outside of a facility setting.4 In some surveys, women in 
India are asked about abortion experience, but direct 
questions to women are known to result in very high 
under-reporting because of stigma.5–7 This evidence gap 
not only hinders the government’s ability to design 
policies and programmes on reproductive health but also 
weakens global estimates of abortion incidence.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
National abortion incidence in India was previously estimated in 
1994 and 2002. These estimates used approximate measures 
based on small-scale studies that were not nationally 
representative or designed to capture national abortion 
incidence. In 1994, investigators estimated the abortion rate to 
be 33 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–49 years by using an 
assumption of the ratio of abortions to livebirths. In 2002, 
investigators included a small sample of providers in the formal 
(n=380) and informal (n=1270) sectors in six states (20% of the 
national population) and estimated a national rate of 
26 abortions per 1000 women of reproductive age by assuming 
that population-per-site ratios and average caseloads per formal 
and informal type of facility represented the situation in all 
states. Notably, findings from small-scale, population-based 
surveys (in the states of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu and part 
of the same study) with the objective of estimating state-level 
abortion incidence show much higher rates of abortion 
(45 abortions and 70 abortions per 1000 women of 
reproductive age, respectively).
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has recorded 
621 000–770 000 abortions each year for the past 15 years. 
The most recent data are from 2014–15, when 
701 415 abortions were recorded. These data greatly 
underestimate the incidence of abortion because they exclude 
abortions by private-sector doctors who are trained in abortion 
provision but do not work in registered facilities and abortions 
provided by other formally trained health professionals who do 
not have specific training in abortion but nonetheless provide 
the services. The latter include providers trained in systems 
other than the allopathic or Western system of medicine, 
principally Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy, some of 
whom provide abortion services. These data also exclude 
abortions using medication abortion drugs sold without a 
prescription and abortions by untrained providers.
Government-sponsored, large-scale, representative, 
community-based surveys such as the National Family Health 
Survey (NFHS) collect information about abortion through 
face-to-face interviews with women. In the 1998–99 NFHS-2 
and the 2007–08 District Level Household and Facility Survey 3, 
women reported that 1·7–1·8% of pregnancies ended in 
abortions. This approach is known to result in high levels of 
under-reporting.
Women’s experience with accessing abortion services has been 
assessed in a few state-specific studies in the past decade. 
Although abortion incidence was not reported, a measure of 
prevalence was included in some studies (eg, lifetime 
experience of abortion) but with some limitations (limited in 
coverage and with potentially high under-reporting).
Added value of this study
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study designed to 
measure the national incidence of abortion in India. To estimate 
the total number of abortions in the country as a whole, we 
combined data on the number of facility-based abortions 
(surgical and medication), the number of medication abortions 
outside facilities, and the number of abortions outside facilities 
using methods other than medication abortion.
Implications of the findings
The new national estimate of abortion incidence in India and 
the distribution of abortions by component (facility-based, 
using medication abortion outside of facilities, and outside of 
facilities with methods other than medication abortion) have 
important implications in terms of access and safety in the 
provision of abortion services. Most abortions are medication 
abortions, and most medication abortions are obtained outside 
health facilities. Although the combined medication abortion 
protocol of mifepristone plus misoprostol is highly effective 
and safe when administered correctly, little is known about 
what kind of information women are getting when they obtain 
this method from chemists and informal vendors, and whether 
they are taking it correctly. This is an important evidence gap 
that should be further explored.
The public sector has a relatively small role in abortion service 
provision. An implication of these findings is that the broader 
role of the public sector in providing high-quality health care to 
poor and vulnerable women needs to be reviewed and assessed 
in terms of possible need for an expanded role in providing 
abortion care. Pending amendments to the Medical 
Termination of Pregnancy Act (including the proposal to permit 
trained mid-level health professionals to provide abortion 
services) would be a feasible option for expanding access to 
safe, legal abortion services.
The incidence of unintended pregnancies and incidence of 
abortion are consistent with the level of unmet need for 
contraception among women in India and underscore the need 
for further investment to meet women’s and couples’ 
contraceptive needs and ensure access to safe abortion services.
The updated estimate of abortion incidence will be 
incorporated into future estimates of abortion incidence at the 
subregional, regional, and global levels and will improve the 
accuracy of these estimates.

Since the passage of the Medical Termination of 
Pregnancy Act in 1971, abortion has been legally available 
in India under a broad range of criteria, including to save 
a woman’s life, to protect her physical and mental health, 
in cases of economic and social necessity, and if 
contraception has failed between married couples.8 The 
act also requires abortion services to be provided by 
trained, certified doctors in registered facilities. In the 
case of medication abortions, a prescription is required. 
However, access to safe, legal abortion services has 
lagged, so women now commonly obtain medication 
abortion from pharmacists, chemists, and informal 
vendors, and the information they receive on how to use 
the drugs and on recommended gestational limits is 
often inaccurate or absent.9–12 Yet since the early 2000s, 
with the increased availability of medication abortion in 
India, a steady improvement in providing access to 
abortion has been facilitated by the passage in 2002 of an 
amendment to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy 
Act, permitting medication abortion up to 7 weeks’ 
gestation, and in 2003 by a further amendment, allowing 
certified abortion providers to prescribe medication 
abortion drugs outside of a registered facility as long as 
emergency facilities were available to them.13,14 Surgical 
abortion procedures continue to be provided in health 
facilities, and some women continue to use unsafe 
methods to self-induce.9
To address the evidence gap on abortion incidence in 
India, we provide national estimates of the incidence of 
abortion, pregnancy, and unintended pregnancy for 
India in 2015.
Methods
Data sources
The 2015 Health Facilities Survey (HFS), fielded from 
March to August, 2015, collected data on the number of 
induced abortions provided annually, by type of 
procedure (surgical and medication), from 4001 public 
and private health facilities in Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, 
Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh 
(appendix). These six states were selected for the survey 
on the basis of geographical location, population size, 
and key sociodemographic characteristics. The HFS 
represents facility-based provision of reproductive health 
care for about 45% of all women in India aged 15–49 years. 
Sampled facilities in the public sector were at or above 
the primary health centre level. Facilities in the private 
sector (registered or unregistered) had basic operating 
theatre capacity (ie, are equipped to provide vacuum 
aspiration procedures). Doctors’ consultation rooms and 
health posts were not included in the HFS (table 1). 
Respondents for the HFS were senior staff who had 
worked in the facility for at least 6 months and who were 
identified as most knowledgeable about abortion 
provision at their facility. Further details about the 
sample are provided in the appendix.

Universes for public hospitals, community health centres, and primary health centres are from comprehensive lists obtained from the Indian Government Health Management Information System. Universes for 
medical colleges are from lists published by the Medical Council of India. Because no comprehensive lists exist for private health facilities and certain public health facilities (see other public urban facility), 
the study team did a listing exercise in a random sample area in each of the six states to identify facilities of these types that at least had a minor operating theatre and provided reproductive health services. The 
ratio of facility to population of women aged 15–49 years (specific to each type of such facilities within four categories of town or city sizes and rural areas) was used to scale up from the number listed to estimate 
the total number of each category of facilities in the six states and, from these, to major regions and summed to provide a national estimate.

2015 were obtained from IMS Health, a company that 
regularly surveys a national sample of 5600 stockists. 
These data cover the two main types of medication 
abortion drugs used: a combination drug regimen of 
mifepristone and misoprostol packaged in the correct 
dosage for early terminations (hereafter referred to as 
MA Combipacks); and mifepristone, a drug that is used 
only to induce abortion (sold as pills and used in 
combination with misoprostol). IMS Health assesses its 
coverage to be 95% of all for-profit drug sales.15
Additionally, we obtained data from the six principal 
non-profit organisations that provide medication abortion 
drugs: DKT International, Marie Stopes International, 
Population Services International, World Health Partners, 
Parivar Seva Santha, and Janani. The two largest non-
profit organisations, DKT International and Marie Stopes 
International, provided data for 2015 on their MA 
Combipack distribution by state.
The number of livebirths in 2015 was estimated from 
UN population data,16 and the number of women aged 
15–49 years was estimated by projections done by the 
International Institute for Population Sciences (Mumbai, 
India) using census data. The proportion of births that 
were from unplanned pregnancies and other contextual 
measures such as contraceptive use and unmet need 
were extracted from the 2015–16 National Family Health 
Survey-4 (NFHS-4).
Abortion incidence
National abortion incidence was estimated through 
three separate components: (1) facility-based abortions; 
(2) medication abortions outside of facilities; and 
(3) abortions outside of facilities and with methods other 
than medication abortion (other abortions).
For the first component, facility-based abortions, we 
used data collected by the HFS on the number of women 
who received induced abortion services (surgical and 
medication abortion) at that health facility during the 
past month or year and the typical month or year. The 
annual number of abortions done in each facility is 
estimated as the average of the past year and typical year 
totals (appendix). The total number of facility-based 
abortions for each surveyed state was estimated by 
applying sample weights (appendix).
Data from the six surveyed states were the basis for 
estimating the number of facility-based abortions 
provided in non-surveyed states. Scaling up findings to 
the national level required three assumptions. First, 
each surveyed state represented the non-surveyed states 
in its region. Second, for the private sector (clinics of all 
sizes, maternity and nursing homes, and hospitals) and 
for certain types of public sector facilities (railway 
hospitals, military hospitals, municipal hospitals, urban 
health centres, and urban family welfare centres), data 
were not available on the universe of such facilities. We 
estimated the universe of these facility types by 
assuming that surveyed states have the same ratio of 
women of reproductive age per facility as non-surveyed 
states (specific to each region). For the public sector, 
data on the universe of facilities are available for all 
other facility types other than those mentioned above 
for all states from the Ministry of Health & Family 
Welfare’s Health Management Information System 
(HMIS). Third, scaling up findings from the six states 
included in the HFS to other states in their respective 
regions required the assumption that the average 
caseload in surveyed states is the same as in non-
surveyed states for each type of facility.
On the basis of these assumptions, the national total 
number of facility-based abortions was obtained by 
combining the total number of abortions provided in 
public and private sector facilities with the number of 
abortions provided by NGO facilities (appendix).
Several steps are required to estimate the second 
component of abortion incidence, medication abortions 
outside of health facilities. First, the total amount of 
MA Combipacks distributed in India in 2015 was 
obtained by combining the quantities provided by the 
for-profit and non-profit sectors. Each MA Combipack 
is used to induce one abortion. In addition to MA 
Combipacks, the quantity of mifepristone pills sold by 
the for-profit sector was converted to the equivalent 
number of abortions. Although one pill of mifepristone 
(200 mg) is medically indicated for one abortion, 
evidence suggests that some women are instructed by 
their providers to take more than one pill for one 
induced abortion.17 To account for this, we used the 
following assumption: 80% of women who use 
mifepristone pills sold separately used one pill per 
abortion; 10% used two pills per abortion; and 10% 
used three pills per abortion (Sheriar N, Hinduja 
Healthcare Surgical and Holy Family Hospitals, 
personal communication). This is equivalent to every 
130 mifepristone pills accounting for 100 abortions. 
The total number of medication abortions is the sum 
of MA Combipacks and equivalent number of 
mifepristone-only abortions, from both the for-profit 
and the non-profit sectors.
The following additional adjustments were needed to 
estimate the number of medication abortions. First, 
for-profit sales were increased by 5% to account for IMS 
Health’s incomplete data coverage. Second, total medi-
cation abortions (for-profit and non-profit) were 
reduced: (1) by 10% to account for wastage on the basis 
of available data of drug wastage in general (data on 
medication abortion drug wastage are unavailable);18,19 
(2) by 5% of all facility-based abortions to avoid double 
counting women who attempted a medication abortion 
outside of a facility but eventually received a successful 
abortion within a facility, where they are already 
counted in the HFS;20 and (3) by 72 000 medication 
abortions in states that have borders with Nepal (Puri 
M, Center for Research on Environment Health and 
Population Activities, personal communication)21 and

by 21 000 medication abortions in states that have 
borders with Bangladesh (A Hossain, Bangladesh 
Association for Prevention of Septic Abortion, personal 
communication)22 to account for cross-border exports of 
medication abortion drugs to these countries.
Finally, we subtracted all relevant categories of facility-
based medication abortions (those occurring in private 
and NGO facilities and those given as prescriptions in 
public sector facilities) from total medication abortion 
sales to obtain the number of medication abortions 
occurring outside health facilities. Public sector 
medication abortions for which women are given the 
medication abortion drug by the provider are not 
subtracted because the public sector procures its own 
supplies of drugs directly from manufacturers. In our 
estimates, medication abortions that occur outside 
facilities are heterogeneous and include abortions that 
are self-sourced directly from informal sector providers, 
especially chemists, and some abortions that are initiated 
or prescribed in private doctors’ offices or consultation 
rooms because this type of provider is not covered by the 
HFS and the number of such abortions was not 
quantified.
The third component of abortion incidence includes 
abortions outside of health facilities with methods other 
than 
medication 
abortion. 
These 
abortions 
are 
performed by untrained providers using unsafe methods 
such as insertion of sticks and roots, ingestion of herbal 
medicines, abdominal massage, or those performed 
under unhygienic conditions.23,24 Unlike the previous 
two components, it was not possible to obtain data on 
the number of other abortions. We therefore used an 
indirect technique based on a 2009 community-based 
study in two states in which the average proportion of 
women having these types of abortions was estimated to 
be 7%.9,10 However, we adjusted this estimate because the 
rapid increase in use of medication abortion since 2009 
probably reduced women’s use of other unsafe methods. 
We used the increase in medication abortion drug sales 
in 2009–15 (almost a 30% increase) as a proxy for 
estimating the decrease in the proportion of women 
having other abortions since 2009. We estimated that by 
2015, 5% of abortions could be classified as other 
abortions. The HFS data confirmed that a small 
proportion of women having abortions continue to use 
damaging methods. Across the six surveyed states, 
4–16% of patients receiving post-abortion care (a fraction 
of all women having abortions) were being treated for 
serious complications (including infection of the uterus, 
injury, perforation, sepsis, and shock).
To account for uncertainty in our estimates, we did 
sensitivity analyses to estimate upper and lower bound 
ranges, which we refer to as high and low estimates, 
around the medium estimate. The first component 
(facility-based abortions) relies entirely on survey data, 
so confidence intervals based on the HFS provide lower 
and upper limits. The second component (medication 
abortions outside of facilities) relies on several ad-
just 
ments, so upper and lower bounds were calculated 
for each adjustment made, depending on the certainty of

the data underlying each. For example, adjustments for 
cross-border export of medication abortion drugs to 
Nepal and Bangladesh are based on large-scale HFS 
surveys, so we assumed a relatively low level of 
uncertainty for these two adjustments when calculating 
upper and lower bounds. Adjustments for the percentage 
of women who unsuccessfully use medication abortion 
outside a facility and then obtain an abortion in a facility 
is based on a small study in one state,20 so we assumed a 
relatively high level of uncertainty for this adjustment 
with a wider range for the upper and lower bound 
estimates. For the third component (other abortions), 
where the medium estimate is based on community-
based studies in two states and national data on trends 
in the use of medication abortion, we assumed a level of 
uncertainty that is intermediate between these two in 
the sensitivity analysis. We aggregated ranges across all 
three components and their subcomponents to obtain 
upper and lower bounds around the estimated total 
number of abortions (referred to as the medium 
estimate; appendix).
Incidence of intended and unintended pregnancies
The total number of pregnancies includes births, 
abortions, and miscarriages. We applied NFHS-4 
estimates of unwanted and wanted fertility to the number 
of livebirths to estimate planned and unplanned births. 
All abortions are assumed to be unplanned pregnancies 
(appendix).25 The number of miscarriages was estimated 
based on natural patterns of pregnancy loss: 20% of 
livebirths and 10% of abortions.26–28 Because miscarriages 
are highly under-reported in face-to-face survey interviews, 
it is necessary to use data from clinical studies to estimate 
this component (appendix). Intended pregnancies are the 
sum of planned births and miscarriages resulting from 
intended pregnancies (ie, 20% of planned births), and 
unintended pregnancies are the sum of unplanned births, 
induced abortions, and miscarriages that resulted from 
unintended pregnancies (20% of unplanned births and 
10% of abortions).
Statistical analysis
We used SPSS version 22 for statistical analyses of HFS 
data and SAS version 9.3 to compute standard errors 
around facility-based abortions estimates. We used STATA 
version 13.1 to analyse supplementary data from the 
NFHS-4.
Role of the funding source
The sponsors of the study had no role in study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. The authors had full access to all 
the data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
We estimated that 15·6 million abortions (range 
14·1 million–17·3 million) took place in India in 2015 
(table 2), giving an abortion rate of 47·0 (42·2–52·1) per 
1000 women aged 15–49 years (table 3).
3·4 million abortions (range 2·8 million–3·9 million; 
22%) were provided in health facilities. 64% of facility-
based abortions were surgical, and the remaining were 
medication abortions. Public sector facilities accounted 
for 24% of these abortions, whereas private sector facili-
ties accounted for 73% of all facility-based procedures, 
and NGO facilities accounted for the remainder (data 
not shown).
11·5 million induced abortions (range 10·8–12·2 million; 
73%) were medication abortions that took place outside of 
health facilities (table 2). MA Combipacks were used for 
87% of these medication abortions, and the remainder 
were induced with mifepristone and misoprostol sold 
separately (data not shown). The estimated number of

includes some medication abortions that are provided 
by doctors working in private practice; these were 
not captured by the HFS. 0·8 million abortions 
(0·4 million–1·2 million; 5%) are estimated to be done 
outside of facilities and with methods other than 
medication abortion.
12·7 million abortions (81%) were medication abortions 
obtained either in or outside facilities (figure 1). 
2·2 million abortions (14%) were by surgical methods, and 
0·8 million abortions (5%) were done outside of facilities 
by methods other than medication or surgical abortion.
With an estimated total of 48·1 million pregnancies 
(figure 2), the rate was 144·7 pregnancies per 1000 women 
aged 15–49 years. 25·8 million pregnancies (54%) resulted 
in births, 33% of pregnancies ended in induced abortions, 
and 14% of pregnancies ended in a miscarriage. 52% of all 
pregnancies were intended, (ie, births occurring at the 
time they were wanted and miscarriages resulting from 
planned pregnancies). The rate of unintended pregnancy 
was estimated at 70·1 pregnancies per 1000 women aged 
15–49 years.
Discussion
This study is the first large-scale study specifically designed 
to estimate abortion incidence in India. At 47·0 abortions 
per 1000 women aged 15–49 years, the abortion rate in 
India is within the range of reported estimates of abortion 
incidence in three other south Asian countries 
(figure 3).21,22,29 Additionally, our estimate of 3·4 million 
facility-based abortions in 2015 is nearly five times the 
number that was reported4 to government sources in 
2014–15 (701 415 abortions). The difference was expected 
because official data on abortion are known to be highly 
underreported.
47 abortions per 1000 women is, however, a substantially 
higher rate than the model-based estimate for the south 
Asian subregion (37 abortions per 1000 women aged 
15–44 years).2,3 This is partly because the model necessarily 
used the only national estimate of abortion incidence 
available for India at the time it was developed, for 2002 
(26 abortions per 1000 women) that is probably an 
underestimate because the study was not designed to 
estimate abortion incidence and used a very rough 
calculation based on a small sample of facilities. Never-
theless, our estimated abortion incidence is within the 
uncertainty interval around the model-based estimate for 
the subregion (uncertainty interval 30–50 abortions per 
1000 women aged 15–44 years). If the subregional 
abortion incidence of 37 abortions per 1000 women were 
applied to the whole country in 2015, there would be an 
estimated 11·2 million abortions in that year.
Direct measurement is preferable to indirect estimation 
techniques when estimating abortion incidence because 
it is more robust and reliable. Indirect estimation 
techniques are applied in countries that restrict abortion 
by law and where measurement must necessarily rely on 
a number of assumptions. We relied on two direct sources 
of data that together accounted for 95% of all abortions: a 
large-scale survey of health facilities in six states that 
provide reproductive health services for about 45% of 
women of reproductive age in the country (scaled up to 
represent all states); and available data on the quantity of 
medication abortion drugs distributed in the entire 
country (no scaling up needed). Indirect methods were 
used to estimate the incidence of other abortions, the 
third component in our calculation of abortion incidence, 
which accounts for a very small proportion of all abortions 
(5%). The method 
ology used to estimate the inci-
dence of abortion in India might be considered an 
improve 
ment com 
pared with previous indirect estimation 
methodologies.30 However, these improved approaches 
were feasible because abortion is broadly legal in India, 
facilitating the collection of abortion service provision 
data from facilities. The broadly legal status of abortion in 
India also means that mifepristone is an authorised drug. 
That a very high proportion of current use of medication 
abortion is in the form of MA Combipacks (mifepristone 
plus misoprostol), with each package used for a single 
abortion, made it feasible to estimate number of abortions 
from the number of sold packages. Quantities of 
mifepristone distributed as a separate drug were used to

estimate the number of abortions with an assumption 
of the number of pills women were likely to use to 
induce abortion. The estimates do not integrate use of 
misoprostol alone for abortion because the many uses of 
this drug meant that it was not feasible to determine the 
quantity used to induce abortions. Although the 
widespread availability of the MA Combipack suggests 
that use of misoprostol alone to induce abortion is likely 
to be relatively infrequent, to the extent that misoprostol 
is still used, the estimated rate of 47 abortions per 
1000 women of reproductive age is an underestimate.
This new estimate of abortion incidence also permits 
estimation of unintended pregnancy. 70 unintended 
pregnancies per 1000 women aged 15–49 years in India is 
within the range of incidence of unintended pregnancies 
in other south Asian countries (figure 3). Unintended 
pregnancy is a strong indicator of the need for improve-
ment in contraceptive services. This rate of unintended 
pregnancy is consistent with the level of unmet need for 
effective contraception in 2015–16. The unmet need for 
contraception among married women in India was 13%, 
and an additional 6% of married women used traditional 
methods of contraception with relatively high failure 
rates. Other factors that might be contributing to both 
unintended pregnancy and abortion include contraceptive 
failure from incorrect and inconsistent use, sexual activity 
among unmarried women, and women’s and couples’ 
strength of motivation to have small families. The latter 
factor alone will probably reflect a number of other 
broader factors such as urbanisation, educational 
attainment, and the changing status and roles of women 
in society.
This study has several limitations. The nationwide 
incidence of facility-based abortions was estimated from 
survey data collected from health facilities in six states 
(selected to represent the six large regions of the country). 
These health facilities provide reproductive health services 
to about 45% of women of reproductive age in the country. 
A number of assumptions were made to generalise 
estimates from these six surveyed states to other states 
within each of the six large regions of India. Although 
these are plausible assumptions and similar assumptions 
have been used in an earlier study of abortion incidence in 
India (based on a much smaller sample of facilities), the 
2015 estimates are an approximation of the true national 
number of facility-based abortions. Additionally, although 
data on medication abortion drugs were national, which is 
a strength of this study, several assumptions were 
necessary to obtain the best estimate of the proportion of 
these drugs that were actually used to induce abortions. In 
estimating the number of abortions within the component 
we referred to as other abortions, assumptions were also 
necessary because large-scale data on this component are 
scarce. These assumptions are based on existing relevant 
data or on expert opinion, so further research on these 
factors is needed to provide solid empirical data. We also 
estimated medication abortions outside of health facilities 
covered by the HFS. This large component includes some 
abortions that are legally provided by doctors in settings 
that were not included in the HFS (eg, private consultation 
rooms). When estimating the 2015 abortion incidence, we 
could not take into account use of misoprostol alone to 
induce abortion, and hence, to an unknown extent, the 
abortion incidence reported here is an underestimate of 
the true abortion incidence.
Because this is the first comprehensive study to estimate 
the incidence of unintended pregnancy and abortion, 
these new estimates for 2015 do not permit interpretation 
of trends in related reproductive behaviours and outcomes 
such as contraceptive prevalence and total fertility. The 
study findings also do not provide insights into reasons for 
abortion, including sex-biased abortion. However, it is 
notable that the national sex ratio at birth (number of girls 
per 1000 boys) has changed little in the past decade 
(901 girls per 1000 boys in 2005–07 vs 906 girls per 
1000 boys 2012–14).31,32 Worldwide, the sex ratio is about 
950 girls per 1000 boys at birth; the most recent sex ratio at 
birth in India (906 girls to 1000 boys) indicates that sex-
biased abortion is occurring.33 More in-depth research is 
needed to understand these important issues, and the 
findings of this study can contribute to such analyses.
A number of policy and programmatic recommendations 
follow from the study’s results. Most abortions are 
happening without prescriptions and outside of facilities 
via chemists and informal vendors, which suggests the 
need to improve facility-based services. Most primary 
health centres and a large proportion of community 
health centres do not provide abortion services, and the 
shortage of trained staff and inadequate supplies are the 
primary reasons survey respondents gave for not 
providing this service. A first step is therefore to address 
these shortages through increased training and better 
logistical support for supplies. Examples of these 
improvements include expanding the provider base by: (1) 
training and certifying more medical doctors (ie, general 
practitioners) to perform abortions; (2) permitting and 
training practitioners who are trained in traditional or 
alternative medicine, midwifery, nursing, or auxiliary 
nursing–midwifery (ie, mid-level providers) to offer 
medication abortion services; (3) streamlining the process 
for approving private-sector facilities to provide abortion 
care; (4) ensuring adequate supplies of medication 
abortion pills and manual vacuum aspiration equipment 
in public-sector facilities; and (5) improv 
ing the quality of 
abortion and contraceptive services in the public sector by 
training providers to offer women confidential and 
respectful services and in-depth counselling.
Many of these recommendations are particularly 
needed at primary health centres because these facilities 
are the most accessible to the majority of women who 
live in rural areas and who are least likely to be able to 
afford private services. Some women might only have 
access to medication abortion from chemists and 
informal vendors, so it is also important for policy

makers to consider adopting harm reduction strategies 
to support women’s self-use of medication abortion. Self-
administration of medication abortion can be a safe and 
effective option if women have accurate information and 
access to health care if complications arise. Interventions 
are needed to provide women with accurate information 
on self-use of medication abortion, and on the availability 
of services in public facilities; also, research is needed to 
test interventions to improve chemists’ and informal 
vendors’ knowledge and practice in providing medication 
abortion. Studies in other countries have shown some 
measure of success with this type of intervention.34–36 
Additionally, the Indian Government needs to increase 
attention to improving policies and practice regarding 
provision of contraceptive services to improve the ability 
of women and couples to prevent unintended pregnancy.
A rate of 70 unintended pregnancies per 1000 women 
and the finding that nearly half of all pregnancies are 
unintended suggest that there is great need for 
improvements in contraceptive services for women and 
for couples in general and in the context of abortion care. 
Consideration should be given to improving coverage, 
particularly in the public sector, and improving the quality 
of care (eg, by making a range of contraceptive methods 
available, having reliable supplies of contraceptive 
commodities, and ensuring that staff are trained to provide 
comprehensive counselling and follow-up services). With 
respect to abortion services, it is essential to ensure that 
contraceptive counselling and services are a standard 
component of care after abortion proced 
ures and after 
treatment 
for 
abortion 
complications. 
Inadequate 
contraceptive services at the point of abortion care is a 
missed opportunity to help women prevent a subsequent 
unintended pregnancy and possible abortion.
Further research on the reasons women do not seek 
abortion care at health facilities is essential to understand 
how to change existing service provision practices and 
approaches and how to improve the abortion care that 
women receive outside of facilities. To monitor the effect 
of any efforts to improve services, better data collection 
systems need to be implemented, starting with training of 
providers and health-systems staff in the implementation 
of existing HMIS reporting systems.
The new estimates of incidence of abortion and 
unintended pregnancy in India will hopefully motivate 
and guide policies and programmes to improve the 
provision of abortion services and contraceptive care.
