uman papillomavirus (HPV) infection 
causes cervical dysplasia that can prog-
ress into invasive cervical cancer.1 
Screening programs for cervical cancer use the 
Papanicolaou (Pap) test to detect preinvasive cer-
vical abnormalities.1,2 Recently, HPV vaccination 
programs have been added to efforts to prevent 
cervical cancer.3,4 Vaccination against HPV should 
reduce the prevalence of cervical dysplasia; thus, 
screening outcomes provide early evidence of the 
effectiveness of HPV vaccination against can-
cer.5–8 Data are lacking on the association between 
Pap test results and HPV vaccination in the North 
American context.9–11 The province of Alberta has 
a population-based program for cervical cancer 
screening and HPV vaccination, and is well posi-
tioned to address this knowledge gap.
In 2008, Alberta implemented a school-based 
HPV vaccination program for female students in 
grade 5 (age 10–11 yr) and, in 2009, added a 
3-year catch-up program for female students in 
grade 9 (age 14–15).12 The HPV vaccination pro-
gram expanded to include male students in 2014.13 
The current program provides 3 doses (months 0, 
2 and 6) of quadrivalent vaccine that includes pro-
tection against 2 oncogenic HPV types (16 and 
18), which together account for 70% of cases of 
cervical cancer.14,15 The Alberta Cervical Cancer 
Screening Program (ACCSP) recommends routine 
screening for cervical cancer with Pap tests begin-
ning at age 21; however, some women elect to 
begin screening at a younger age.16
The objective of this study was to assess the 
impact of the Alberta school-based HPV vaccina-
tion program on Pap test cytology results using 
databases of province-wide vaccination and cer-
vical cancer screening. The study population is 
the first cohort of women in Alberta who were

Background: A school-based program with 
quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vacci-
nation was implemented in Alberta in 2008. We 
assessed the impact of this program on Pap test 
cytology results using databases of province-
wide vaccination and cervical cancer screening.
Methods: We conducted a nested case–control 
study involving a cohort of women in Alberta 
born between 1994 and 1997 who had at least 
1 Pap test between 2012 and 2015. Women 
with negative cytology results were controls. 
Women with low-grade (atypical squamous 
cells of undetermined significance or low-grade 
squamous intraepithelial lesion) and high-
grade (atypical squamous cells, cannot rule out 
a high-grade lesion; or high-grade squamous 
intraepithelial lesion) cervical abnormalities 
were cases. Exposure status was assigned accord-
ing to records of HPV vaccination. Odds ratios 
(ORs) for abnormal cytology results by vaccina-
tion status were adjusted for neighbourhood 
income, laboratory service, rural versus urban 
residency, and age.
Results: The total study population was 10 204. 
Adjusting for age, vaccinated women had a 
higher screening rate than unvaccinated women 
(13.0% v. 11.4%, p < 0.001). Among women 
who received full vaccination (≥ 3 doses), the 
adjusted OR for cervical abnormalities was 0.72 
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63–0.82). For 
high-grade lesions, the adjusted OR was 0.50 
(95% CI 0.30–0.85). With 2-dose HPV vaccination, 
the adjusted OR for cervical abnormalities was 
1.08 (95% CI 0.84–1.38).  
Interpretation: Quadrivalent HPV vaccination 
significantly reduced high-grade cervical abnor-
malities but required 3 doses. Vaccination 
against HPV was associated with screening 
uptake. Population-based vaccination and 
screening programs should work together to 
optimize cervical cancer prevention.

age-eligible for the school-based HPV vaccina-
tion program and participated in any cervical 
cancer screening.
Methods
Alberta has a universal public health care sys-
tem, available to all residents. Residents of the 
province are required to register with the 
Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan, with more 
than 99% of the population registered.17 A per-
sonal health number for each registered person 
acts as a unique lifetime identifier. This number 
can be used to support deterministic linkage 
across administrative health databases.
Study design
Given that the school-based HPV vaccination 
cohort was screened for cervical cancer oppor-
tunistically (i.e., at a younger age than recom-
mended by the ACCSP), we conducted a nested 
case–control analysis.
Data sources
We collected cytology results from the ACCSP 
database and collected vaccination records from 
Alberta’s provincial immunization repository 
(Immunization and Adverse Reaction to Immu-
nization [Imm/ARI]) and the Pharmaceutical 
Information Network (PIN).
The ACCSP database receives all of the labo-
ratory test data for women who are residents of 
Alberta and aged 18 to 69 years. The cervical 
cancer screening application has linkages to mul-
tiple provincial repositories including Pap test 
laboratory results and cancer registry data.2 
Demographic information is obtained from 
Alberta Health’s Person Directory.18 The cervi-
cal cancer screening application undergoes con-
tinuous reviews for quality assurance, and its 
data elements are validated and verified against 
the multiple provincial information linkages.
The Imm/ARI repository captures all vacci-
nations administered through public health pro-
grams, including those administered through 
the school-based program. In 2013 and 2014, 
74.1% of the public vaccination program’s tar-
get population completed 3 doses of HPV vac-
cination by grade 9.19 The Imm/ARI repository 
has strict guidelines that promote high-quality 
data submissions and is believed to capture all 
publicly funded vaccinations in the province.20
The Pharmaceutical Information Network is 
used for privately dispensed vaccines to capture 
women who are age-eligible for the school-
based program but vaccinated outside of the 
program. Less than 5% of the total HPV vacci-
nations were provided from PIN. We assumed 
that the vaccination event is an appropriate 
proxy for the dose administered. More than 
95% of pharmacists submit records to PIN,21 
and every dispensation record in PIN follows 
data-quality protocols to ensure the accuracy of 
information entered at the pharmacy level.
Study population
Our study population included women born 
between 1994 and 1997, who had at least 1 Pap 
test between 2012 and 2015, and who had per-
manent residency in Alberta, as per the ACCSP 
eligibility criteria. Women identified as First 
Nations or Inuit, based on the Provincial Regis-
try, were excluded because they were unlikely 
to have been completely captured within the 
data sets used in the current analyses. First 
Nations and Inuit people are indigenous popula-
tions in Canada that receive health care services 
from federally funded health centres for which 
the province of Alberta has limited information. 
We also excluded women who moved to 
Alberta after 2008 and who had no vaccination 
record. If these groups of women were vacci-
nated outside of the province, they could have 
been misclassified as unvaccinated. Those who 
had only unsatisfactory Pap test results were 
excluded because their case–control status could 
not be determined. 
Outcome and exposure measures
To assign case–control status, we used the most 
severe cytology results (reported based on the 
Bethesda System22) captured in the ACCSP data-
base between Jan. 1, 2012, and Aug. 14, 2015. 
Women with negative cytology results were the 
controls, and women with low-grade (atypical 
squamous cells of undetermined significance 
[ASC-US] or low-grade squamous intraepithelial 
lesion [LSIL]) and high-grade (atypical squa-
mous cells, cannot rule out a high-grade lesion 
[ASC-H]; or high-grade squamous intraepithelial 
lesion [HSIL]) cervical abnormalities were 
cases.22 We considered a woman “vaccinated” if 
there was a record of at least 1 dose of HPV vac-
cination before the Pap test used for the case–con-
trol assignment, “fully vaccinated” if she had 3 or 
more recorded doses of the HPV vaccination and 
“partially vaccinated” if fewer than 3 doses were 
recorded. “Unvaccinated” women were those 
with no record of vaccination before the Pap test. 
The first HPV vaccination in the study popula-
tion took place in 2006, when the vaccine was 
approved in Canada.12
Covariates
Our covariates included neighbourhood income, 
urban versus rural residency, the laboratory service

that processed the cytologic specimens and age 
in years (as of July 31, 2015), similar to other 
studies.6,8 Statistics Canada provided neighbour-
hood income quintiles based on dissemination 
area, which was further linked to postal code. 
Rural residency designation was created by 
Alberta Health, based on population densities and 
travel times to a variety of health services. In 
Alberta, 2 laboratory services in Calgary and 
Edmonton process cytologic specimens. Col-
lected samples are processed using different tech-
nologies (ThinPrep in Calgary; SurePath in 
Edmonton). Both are considered valid technolo-
gies, but SurePath has a slightly higher positive 
predictive value (PPV).23,24 Given the low preva-
lence of cervical abnormality in the study popula-
tion, the results were adjusted for laboratory. 
There are other known risk factors for HPV 
infection and cervical cancer, such as smoking.16 
However, we could not obtain such data for the 
study population. Covariates with missing values 
were excluded from the analysis. 
Statistical analysis
We compared the sociodemographic character-
istics of cases and controls using a χ2 test. We 
used logistic regression analysis to regress 
case–control status on vaccination status to esti-
mate the exposure odds ratio (OR) and 95% 
confidence interval (CI), and then adjusted for 
covariates. We calculated vaccine effectiveness 
as a percentage [(1 – adjusted OR) × 100%]. 
All statistical tests were 2-sided with a 0.05 
level of significance. Data linkage and analyses 
were conducted using SAS version 9.3.
Results
Figure 1 illustrates the selection of our study 
population. In Alberta, 91 273 women born 
between 1994 and 1997 were age-eligible for 
the school vaccination program that started in 
2008. From this cohort, 10 204 women were 
eligible for inclusion in our study: 1481 were 
cases (14.5%) and 8723 were controls (85.5%).

Of the study population, 5712 (56.0%) were 
unvaccinated and 4492 (44.0%) had at least 
1 dose of HPV vaccine before cervical cancer 
screening, between 2006 and 2015. Adjusting 
for age, vaccinated women had a higher screen-
ing rate than unvaccinated women (13.0% v. 
11.4%, p < 0.001). Among the vaccinated 
women, the median separation between their last 
vaccination and Pap test was 1374 (interquartile 
range [IQR] 1119–1603) days. Table 1 details 
the characteristics by birth cohort.
Among cases, 1384 (93.5%) had low-grade 
cervical abnormalities and 97 (6.5%) had high-
grade cervical abnormalities. Cases were older 
(p = 0.046) and more likely to have had their 
Pap tests processed at the laboratory in Calgary 
(p < 0.001). Cases and controls were similar in 
regard to neighbourhood income and rural ver-
sus urban residency. Table 2 shows the sociode-
mographic characteristics of cases and controls. 
Less than 1% of covariates had missing values. 
Among the vaccinated women, 83.8% com-
pleted 3 or more doses of the vaccine. Vaccina-
tion rates were higher in younger women: 
76.6% of the 18-year-old group had at least 
1 dose of HPV vaccine compared with 20.4% of 
the 21-year-old group (p < 0.001). Table 3 details 
characteristics of the vaccinated and unvacci-
nated sub 
populations.
Table 4 summarizes the main study outcomes. 
Among women who received full HPV vaccina-
tion (≥ 3 doses) (compared with no vaccination), 
the adjusted OR for abnormal cytology results 
was 0.72 (95% CI 0.63–0.82). Vaccine effec-
tiveness of full HPV vaccination for abnormal 
cytology results was 28% (95% CI 18%–37%). 
Among the fully vaccinated women (n = 3675), 
11.8% had abnormal cytology results, whereas 
among unvaccinated women (n = 5712), 16.1% 
had abnormal cytologic results.
Among partially vaccinated women, (i.e., 
2-dose vaccination compared with 0 doses), the 
adjusted OR for abnormal cytology results was 
1.08 (95% CI 0.84–1.38), indicating that the 
2-dose vaccination was not effective. The 
adjusted OR for high-grade cervical abnormalities 
was 0.16 (95% CI 0.02–1.17) among partially 
vaccinated women. Median separation between 
first and second doses was 91 (IQR 56–147) days. 
We conducted a sensitivity analysis by sepa-
rating the high-grade and low-grade cases, and 
redefining controls as negative or low-grade cyto-
logic results to isolate vaccine effectiveness in 
high-grade cases. Among women who received 
full vaccination (compared with no vaccination), 
the adjusted OR for high-grade cervical abnor-
malities was 0.50 (95% CI 0.30–0.85), which 
translates into a vaccine effectiveness of 50% 
(95% CI 15%–70%). The adjusted odds of high-
grade cervical abnormalities with at least 1 dose 
of vaccination compared with no vaccination 
were lower when the control was redefined as 
both normal cytology outcomes and low-grade 
cervical abnormalities (adjusted OR 0.46, 95% 
CI 0.28–0.75).
A separate analysis of Alberta’s cervical 
screening outcomes found that the PPV of Pap 
tests processed at SurePath was higher than the 
PPV of those processed at ThinPrep for women 
aged 18–21 (57.3% v. 46.6%, p = 0.02), and 
the difference decreased but persisted in other 
age groups.

Interpretation
Eight years after a school-based HPV vaccination 
was initiated in Alberta, 3-dose HPV vaccination 
has demonstrated early benefits, particularly 
against high-grade cervical abnormalities, which 
are more likely to progress to cervical cancer.1
The HPV vaccine effectiveness we report is 
comparable to that of other observational studies 
with pathology outcomes,6,8 but greater than an 
Australian study’s age-adjusted vaccine effec-
tiveness against high-grade cytologic abnormali-
ties with complete vaccination (39%, 95% CI 
22%–52%).7 The substantial vaccine effective-
ness found in the current study may be attribut-
able to our study population of only young 
women, likely to be HPV-naive when vacci-
nated.6 Furthermore, North American populations 
have a higher proportion of vaccine-targeted 
HPV types 16 and 18 than other regions.25
Effective HPV vaccination will disrupt the 
balance of harms and benefits of cervical cancer 
screening.26 The reduced prevalence of HPV-
related cervical abnormalities will reduce the 
PPV of the screening test.27 The reduced preva-
lence also means that there will be fewer referrals 
to colposcopy, which is associated with discom-
fort and potential obstetric complications.16,28 
Thus, with population-based HPV vaccination, 
guidelines for cervical cancer screening may

need to include a later age for screening initiation 
and/or a longer interval between screenings.
Optimal cervical cancer prevention requires both 
effective HPV vaccination and screening.4 Screen-
ing may prevent cervical cancer for both unvacci-
nated and vaccinated women, considering that not 
all cancers and tumours are associated with the 
HPV strains included in the quadrivalent vac-
cine.27,29 Thus, it is concerning that unvaccinated 
women are less likely to be screened (Table 1). The 
interaction between vaccination and screening 
behaviour leads to the population becoming strati-
fied into 3 distinct categories for cancer risk: low-
risk groups are both vaccinated and being screened; 
medium-risk groups are either vaccinated or fol-
lowed up appropriately with screening; and high-
risk groups are neither vaccinated nor screened. 
Emergence of the high-risk group, more vulnerable 
to cervical cancer, means that vaccination and 
screening programs should work together to iden-
tify, monitor and intervene with individuals margin-
alized by both programs. The collaboration can 
extend to the low-risk group to avoid overscreening.
A topical issue in Canada and elsewhere is the 
effectiveness of 2-dose HPV vaccination; the 
National Advisory Committee on Immunization 
(NACI) in Canada allows a 2-dose HPV vaccina-
tion schedule.30 The lack of effectiveness of the 
2-dose schedule found in this study might be from 
secondary vaccine failure, as the separation

between last vaccination and Pap test was longer 
than 36 months known for immunogenicity of the 
two-dose vaccination.30,31 Furthermore, median 
separation between first and second doses in our 
study was shorter than the recommended 6 
months.14 A 6-month period is required for affinity 
maturation of memory B cells for lasting immu-
nity.32 The efficacy of the 2-dose schedule in trials 
has not been reproduced in observational studies 
that did not have the recommended dose spac-
ing.6,8,30 An Australian study with proper spacing 
found that the 2-dose schedule had substantial vac-
cine effectiveness in cytology outcomes but not in 
pathology outcomes.33 At this point, a policy 
change to a 2-dose schedule for HPV vaccination 
should be done with caution given that evidence for 
vaccine effectiveness is still inconclusive. 
There was a significant difference in the pro-
portion of cervical abnormalities between the 
2 laboratories in Alberta. The laboratories are 
different in the geographical distribution of 
their clients. In Alberta, prevalence of sexually 
transmitted infections is different along the 
north–south geographical division, although 
patterns are mixed; the incidence rate of chla-
mydia is higher in the northern half whereas the 
incidence of syphilis is higher in the southern 
half.34 The finding merits further investigation, 
and the ACCSP has plans to investigate these 
laboratory differences in Alberta.
Strengths and limitations
A strength of our study is the use of determinis-
tically linked population-based surveillance 
databases for both cervical cancer screening 
and HPV vaccination. This approach reduces 
selection bias, as well as misclassification risk 
from probabilistic linkage. In addition, our pop-
ulation is restricted to the cohort targeted by the 
school vaccination program. Thus, confounding 
that may occur from prevaccination HPV infec-
tion if age ranges are too wide is reduced.
A limitation of the study is that we did not 
use pathology outcomes. The accuracy of cytol-
ogy compared with pathology varies, especially 
for low-grade abnormalities,35 which accounted 
for most of our study’s cases. Because most of 
our study population are not candidates for col-
poscopy owing to young age,36 we did not have 
large enough and representative biopsy out-
comes for the study purpose. Despite this limi-
tation, cytology outcomes are worthwhile to 
study given that they have been used to deter-
mine the outcomes of screening programs.26
Conclusion
Quadrivalent HPV vaccination significantly 
reduced high-grade cervical abnormalities but 
required 3 doses. Vaccination against HPV was 
associated with screening uptake. Our study pro-
vides early evidence for the effectiveness of 
HPV vaccination. A cohort study using a popu-
lation with both appropriate vaccination and 
screening age may validate our study’s finding 
of an interaction between HPV vaccination and 
screening uptake. When outcomes from areas 
implementing 2-dose HPV programs become 
available, the effectiveness of a 2-dose schedule 
will be clearer. Evidence from this study and 
future studies can be used to improve integration 
of HPV vaccination and screening programs for 
preventing cervical cancer.
