Maternal immune activation has been highlighted as a factor that might increase the risk and severity of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) in children. Preclinical animal evidence shows that immune activation in mothers during pregnancy causes ASD-like
behavioural traits in offspring. To this point, there has been no investigation of whether immune system activation in human
mothers during pregnancy is associated with more severe symptoms in children with ASD. In this study, data from an existing ASD
cohort (N = 220) were analysed to investigate whether immune conditions in the mother were associated with greater severity of
autism-related symptoms. Results showed that children whose mothers reported a history of immune activation (allergies and
asthma) had significantly higher scores on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS; P = 0.016), suggesting more severe social
impairment symptoms in these children. This increasing severity of social impairment symptoms was further shown on the SRS
cognition (P = 0.007) and mannerisms (P = 0.002) subscales. While immune history was associated with an increase in the severity of
social impairment symptoms, history of autoimmune conditions in the mother did not have any effect in this cohort. To the best of
our knowledge, this study is the first to show an association between immune activation history in the mother and increased ASD
symptom severity in children with ASD. These findings support the idea of an immune system-mediated subtype in ASD, where the
immune history of the mother may be an important factor.

INTRODUCTION
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a group of neurode-
velopmental disorders characterised by impairment in reciprocal
social interaction and communication, along with restricted and
repetitive
behaviours
and
interests.
In
2010,
a
worldwide
prevalence of ASD was estimated at 1 in 132 individuals,1 but
more recently the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
indicated a prevalence of 1 in 68.2 Autism is associated with
substantial physical and mental health problems across the
lifespan3,4 which places a large financial, social and personal
burden on individuals, families and society.5 There are no single
known causes of ASD; it is believed to be caused by a complicated
interplay between genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors.6
Similarly, the clinical presentation, developmental course and
treatment
outcomes
of
ASD
are
heterogeneous,7,8
posing
challenges for diagnosis and treatment.
In recent years, research has developed to suggest the immune
system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of ASD.9–12
Maternal immune activation (MIA), resulting from either genetic or
environmental causes, has been highlighted as a factor that can
increase the risk of ASD.13–16 MIA is broadly defined as an active
immune response during pregnancy. MIA can be considered from
two perspectives: externally triggered or autoimmune. MIA in
response to infections, particularly when associated with fever or
hospitalisation, has been shown to increase the risk of delivering a
child with ASD.17–19 Similar findings have also been reported for
asthma and severe allergies during pregnancy, which are also
externally triggered.20 Maternal history of autoimmune disorders
has also been associated with increased incidence in the diagnosis
of ASD,15,21,22 providing further support for the notion that
maternal immune response, especially during gestation, is an
important factor in the aetiology of ASD.
External immune insults and autoimmune conditions can both
produce an immune response in the mother, mediated by
cytokines, chemokines, inflammatory cells and antibodies, result-
ing in an altered immune system environment for the fetus.
Preclinical animal models have already shown that immune
activation during pregnancy causes ASD-like phenotypes in
offspring, which supports the MIA hypothesis,14,23,24 although
the molecular mechanisms through which MIA increases the risk
of ASD are still largely unknown.
It has been suggested that prenatal exposure to cytokines and
chemokines may alter the expression of genes associated with the
development and regulation of the central nervous system and
immune system.25,26 Additionally, MIA may compromise the ability
of the placenta to regulate the maternal–fetal immune interface,
causing an increase in fetal cytokine levels and disrupting the
development of the fetal central nervous system and immune
system.25,27,28 Many studies have shown that a proportion of
individuals with ASD have elevated levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines, which aid in the recruitment of
inflammatory cells, while anti-inflammatory cytokine levels are
reduced.29,30 This state of chronic inflammation has also been
correlated with an increase in ASD symptom severity,29,31,32
indicating a possible link between the immune system and the
observed ASD phenotype.
Furthermore, some mothers of children with ASD show
antibody reactivity to fetal proteins, raising the possibility that

 these antibodies interfere with development of the fetus and
contribute to ASD symptoms.33–35 Although a family history of
autoimmune disease has been associated with an increased risk of
ASD,15,22 it is not yet clear whether autoimmune disease in the
mother is related to the generation of these detrimental
antibodies in the mother or to ASD symptom severity in the child.
Considered together, the developing research suggests the
potential of an immune-mediated subtype in ASD that may be
driven by alterations in cytokine, chemokine or antibody levels in
the mother and/or child. In many cases, these immune system
aberrations are a result of MIA, which may be externally triggered
or due to an autoimmune disease. This raises the possibility that a
history of MIA in mothers of children with ASD may be related to
increased severity of ASD symptoms. To our knowledge, no study
has examined whether MIA is associated with poorer outcomes for
children with ASD. In this study, we use an existing ASD cohort
with collected data from parents about immune history. We aim to
test whether having an immune or autoimmune-driven MIA is
associated with increased severity of ASD symptoms for the child.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The cohort used for this study were participants in the Western Australian
Autism Biological Registry (WAABR), located at the Telethon Kids Institute
in Perth, Western Australia.36 Ethics approval for the WAABR was granted
by the Human Ethics Committee at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children
in Perth, Western Australia. Participants were recruited between the period
of January 2011 and September 2014 through newspaper advertisements
and flyers, distributed among local clinicians and service providers. The
study included participants with a DSM-IV clinical diagnosis of Autistic
Disorder (autism), Asperger’s Syndrome or Pervasive Developmental
Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDDNOS). Informed consent to be a
part of the WAABR was provided by the primary caregiver of the
participant.
ASD phenotype
The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) was
administered to each participant by research accredited professionals.
The ADOS-G is a standardised, semistructured assessment which uses
simple activities and questions that are designed to prompt and observe
the communicative, social and stereotyped behaviours which are relevant
to the diagnosis of ASD.37 For each participant, the ADOS-G raw scores and
total scores were converted to the updated ADOS-2 calibrated severity
score, as this score is less influenced by child characteristics.38–40 The ADOS
calibrated severity scores are based on a scale on 1–10, where 1 represents
minimal evidence of ASD-related symptoms and 10 denotes a high
severity of symptoms. A primary caregiver also completed the Social
Responsiveness Scale (SRS), which is a 65-item rating scale that measures
social interaction, language, and repetitive/restricted behaviours and
interests in the child.41 The SRS provides a total score, as well as separate
scores for five subscales: awareness, cognition, communication, motivation
and mannerisms. Higher SRS scores indicate heightened severity of ASD-
related social impairment.
Demographics and maternal medical history
A primary caregiver completed a family history questionnaire, which
included
participant
demographics
such
as
age,
gender,
head
circumference, height and weight. It also included a section addressing
the medical history of the biological mother, where details regarding any
diagnosed illnesses or chronic conditions were reported, along with age of
any diagnosis.
RESULTS
Data were analysed from 220 children in the registry who
completed the ADOS assessment and whose primary caregiver
completed the family history questionnaire and SRS assessment.
The SRS total scores (T scores; M = 88.06, Mdn = 88, s.d. = 15.25)
and ADOS calibrated severity scores (M = 5.96, Mdn = 6, s.d. = 2.45)
were used as measures of ASD symptom severity. Demographics
of the child with ASD and the biological mother are provided in
Table 1. The children were separated into categories based on
maternal medical history. Children whose mothers reported a
history of chronic immune activation were placed in the immune
category. Allergies and asthma were the only reported chronic
immune conditions in this cohort. Children whose mothers
reported a diagnosis of any autoimmune conditions were grouped
together in the autoimmune category. In this cohort, the reported
autoimmune conditions included type 1 diabetes (N = 7), optic
neuritis (N = 1), rheumatoid arthritis (N = 4), coeliac disease (N = 1),
eczema/psoriasis
(N = 2),
sarcoidosis
(N = 1),
systemic
lupus
erythematosus (N = 1) and thyroid problems (N = 16), with three
mothers reporting more than one autoimmune condition. As
there were eight children whose mother reported both immune
history (asthma or allergies) and autoimmune history (previous
list), these two groups were analysed separately against the non-
immune history category.
After checking the data for normality, T-tests were run to
compare each medical history category against the demographic
variables. Results showed that there we no significant differences
in the demographics between mothers with an immune activation
history (allergies or asthma) and those without. However, mothers
with a history of autoimmune activation were older in age than
those without (t(216) = 3.53, P = 0.001).
We then conducted multivariate ANOVAs for each category to
examine the relationship between MIA history and outcome
measures of the SRS and ADOS. There was no significant influence
of autoimmune history on SRS total scores or ADOS calibrated
severity scores (F(2, 202) = 2.36, P = 0.09), even when mother’s age
was included as a covariate. No further analysis was conducted
regarding the influence of autoimmune history. For the immune
history category (allergies or asthma), a one-way multivariate
ANOVA examining the effect of immune status on both SRS total
scores and ADOS calibrated severity scores revealed a significant
effect (F(2, 202) = 3.27, P = 0.041). Follow-up ANOVAs revealed a
significant influence of immune status on SRS total scores (F(1,
207) = 5.88, P = 0.016), meaning that children of mothers with a
history of immune activation showed higher SRS total scores
(Figure 1). Subscale analysis of the SRS showed that a history of
immune activation was associated with higher SRS scores,
particularly
on
the
cognition
(P = 0.007)
and
mannerisms
(P = 0.002) treatment subscales (Figure 1). There was, however,

 no influence of immune status on ADOS calibrated severity scores
(F(1,212) = 0.10, P40.05). All of these analyses remained similarly
significant when the three mothers who were not diagnosed with
an immune condition until after pregnancy were removed.
DISCUSSION
We believe this is the first study that has explored the relationship
between maternal immune history and severity of autism
symptoms in a well-characterised cohort of children with ASD.
Specifically, we examined whether a history of immune activation
in mothers of children with autism, driven by either an immune
condition (allergies or asthma) or autoimmune condition, would
be associated with an increase in severity of ASD symptoms in the
child. Results showed that a positive immune history (allergies or
asthma) was associated with increased severity of social symp-
toms in child. A history of autoimmune conditions in the mother
did not influence autism symptom severity in this cohort,
although we cannot rule out that this was due to a large number
of mothers being diagnosed with autoimmune problems post-
pregnancy. Our results provide further support of a relationship
between a history of immune activation in the mother and
caregiver rated severity of ASD-related symptoms in the child.
Preclinical animal models have shown that immune activation
during pregnancy results in offspring displaying autism like
symptoms, such as abnormal communication, decreased socia-
bility and repetitive/restricted behaviours.14 These models have
demonstrated that the type, severity and timing of the immune
insult can influence the observed ASD-like phenotype24 and that
MIA can lead to permanent immune dysregulation in offspring.23
In humans, it has been shown that MIA increases the risk of
children being born with ASD.13–15,17–19,22 For instance, asthma
and allergies during pregnancy have been associated with a
twofold elevated risk of ASD.20 Our results build upon the existing
literature by showing an association between MIA (caused by
asthma and allergies) and ASD symptom severity in children with
ASD. Children of mothers who reported a history of immune
activation had significantly higher SRS total scores, meaning that
they
show
more
severe
caregiver
reported
social
deficits.
Specifically, they had higher scores on the cognition and
mannerisms subscales, suggesting that they have more difficulty
understanding social situations and display more restricted
behaviours or unusual interests. Interestingly, this association of
maternal immune history was not seen on the ADOS calibrated
severity scores. The ADOS is, however, primarily a diagnostic
measure that has poor capacity for differentiating both severity
and change.42,43
Our study extends the MIA hypothesis and indicates that MIA
may contribute to increasing the severity of autism symptoms in
the child. This may be caused by prenatal exposure to cytokines,
chemokines or antibodies which interfere with the development
and
regulation
of
the
fetal
central
nervous
system.25,27,44
Furthermore, immune activation in the mother may have been
associated with immune system dysregulation in the child,23
leading heightened inflammation to increase ASD symptom
severity.29,31,32 Immune profiles of the mothers and children in
the immune category now need to be examined in order to
determine whether maternal immune history and increased
symptom severity are correlated with elevated levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines in the mother and/or child. We also note
that the scope of the MIA hypothesis may include all types of
maternal immune responses, including infections and fevers,17–20
asthma and allergies,20 as well as autoimmune diseases.15,21,22 The
interplay between these various immune responses, in terms of
type, timing and molecular pathways, may be a crucial part of
characterising the immune system-mediated subtype in ASD.
This study was conducted retrospectively in an existing cohort
and relied on accurate caregiver report in terms of the SRS and
medical history of the mother. The ADOS provided a measure of
observed ASD symptom severity, but the influence of maternal
immune history was not significant on this outcome measure.
While the sample size of the immune and non-immune categories
was large, the autoimmune category was much smaller. Within the
autoimmune category, only 16 mothers were diagnosed prior to
pregnancy and it remains unclear how many of these who
reported thyroid problems were specifically related to autoimmu-
nity. It is possible that the 14 mothers who were diagnosed post-
pregnancy and possible thyroid cases that were not autoimmune
conditions influenced the nonsignificant result in this category.
This study needs to be repeated in a larger cohort with equal
numbers in each category and more objective immune activation
details and records regarding specific medical conditions. Future
prospective studies collectively examining externally triggered
immune activation and autoimmune conditions are now required
to shed further light on the nature of the relationship between
immune history and symptom severity.
In conclusion, this study is the first to show a relationship
between immune history in the mother and increased severity of
social symptoms in children with ASD. While we were not able to
determine a causative relationship, this study suggests that
children with ASD who are born to mothers with an immune
activation history (in this case, asthma or allergies) present with
more severe social deficits than those born to mothers without an
immune history. Findings support the role of an immune system-
mediated subtype in ASD, which may be driven by MIA and
changes in levels immune markers. Identification of such a
subtype in ASD will enable more streamlined diagnosis and
management in clinical environments. It supports investigation of
biomarkers in this subgroup and presents novel targets for
immune-modulating pharmacotherapies. Further studies, using a
prospective, longitudinal approach and larger cohorts are needed
to elucidate the interplay between MIA, immune profiles and ASD
symptom severity to further understand the role of mother’s
immune history status in ASD.
