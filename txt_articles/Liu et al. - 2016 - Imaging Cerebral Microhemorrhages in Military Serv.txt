Purpose:
To detect cerebral microhemorrhages in military service 
members with chronic traumatic brain injury by using 
susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imag-
ing. The longitudinal evolution of microhemorrhages was 
monitored in a subset of patients by using quantitative 
susceptibility mapping.
Materials and 
Methods:
The study was approved by the Walter Reed National Mili-
tary Medical Center institutional review board and is com-
pliant with HIPAA guidelines. All participants underwent 
two-dimensional conventional gradient-recalled-echo MR 
imaging and three-dimensional flow-compensated multi-
echo gradient-recalled-echo MR imaging (processed to 
generate susceptibility-weighted images and quantitative 
susceptibility maps), and a subset of patients underwent 
follow-up imaging. Microhemorrhages were identified by 
two radiologists independently. Comparisons of microhe-
morrhage number, size, and magnetic susceptibility de-
rived from quantitative susceptibility maps between base-
line and follow-up imaging examinations were performed 
by using the paired t test.
Results:
Among the 603 patients, cerebral microhemorrhages 
were identified in 43 patients, with six excluded for fur-
ther analysis owing to artifacts. Seventy-seven percent 
(451 of 585) of the microhemorrhages on susceptibility-
weighted images had a more conspicuous appearance 
than on gradient-recalled-echo images. Thirteen of the 
37 patients underwent follow-up imaging examinations. In 
these patients, a smaller number of microhemorrhages 
were identified at follow-up imaging compared with base-
line on quantitative susceptibility maps (mean 6 standard 
deviation, 9.8 microhemorrhages 6 12.8 vs 13.7 microhe-
morrhages 6 16.6; P = .019). Quantitative susceptibility 
mapping–derived quantitative measures of microhemor-
rhages also decreased over time: 20.85 mm3 per day 6 
1.59 for total volume (P = .039) and 20.10 parts per bil-
lion per day 6 0.14 for mean magnetic susceptibility (P 
= .016).
Conclusion:
The number of microhemorrhages and quantitative sus-
ceptibility mapping–derived quantitative measures of mi-
crohemorrhages all decreased over time, suggesting that 
hemosiderin products undergo continued, subtle evolution 
in the chronic stage.

institutional review board and is com-
pliant with Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act guidelines. Mil-
itary service members were recruited 
between March 1, 2011, and November 
14, 2013, after obtaining informed con-
sent at the National Intrepid Center of 
Excellence, Walter Reed National Mili-
tary Medical Center, Bethesda, Mary-
land. Inclusion criteria included clinical 
diagnosis of TBI, active duty or Defense 
Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System 
eligible individuals, men and women 
between the ages of 18 and 60 years, 
and women who were not pregnant or 
breast feeding. Exclusion criteria were 
patients with TBI who were unable to 
consent to the study, those who were 
actively enrolled in other treatment tri-
als with which this study would inter-
fere, a history of prior severe neurolog-
ical or psychiatric conditions, and metal 
implants or shrapnel. All participants (n 
= 603) underwent imaging with an ex-
tended MR imaging protocol. Figure 1 
 
is a diagram of the patient population 
recruitment and exclusion. The subjects 
with TBI had predominantly chronic TBI 
(median time to MR imaging, 856 days 
after injury) and mild TBI (92.7%, 559 
of 603 subjects). Forty-three patients 
to characterize CMH burden (4,5). 
Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) 
reinforces 
susceptibility 
effects 
by 
manipulating magnitude images with 
phase information (6) and therefore 
provides better sensitivity compared 
with GRE imaging (7–9). Quantitative 
susceptibility mapping (QSM) is used 
to estimate the underlying susceptibility 
distribution. This represents an intrin-
sic tissue property, is independent of 
data acquisition parameters, and should 
reflect the actual spatial extent of le-
sions (10–13). Liu et al demonstrated 
that the total susceptibility measure-
ment of CMH is more consistent than 
the size measurement obtained over a 
large range of echo times (14). It has 
also been shown that QSM enables dis-
crimination between diamagnetic and 
paramagnetic lesions (15). Moreover, 
because the magnetic susceptibility of 
an iron-containing lesion is related to 
the concentration of iron, QSM can be 
applied to noninvasively measure iron 
concentration in microhemorrhages and 
other lesions (16).
CMH is a common finding in patients 
with TBI at the acute stage (17–19). 
Blood products in the brain undergo 
a complex degradation process from 
oxyhemoglobin to hemosiderin over a 
period of several months. The ability to 
monitor the evolution of microhemor-
rhages could provide important infor-
mation regarding disease progression 
or recovery. In the present study, we 
characterized CMHs in military ser-
vice members with chronic TBI by us-
ing SWI. The longitudinal evolution of 
microhemorrhages was monitored in a 
subset of the patients by using QSM.

Advances in Knowledge
 
n Patients with traumatic brain 
injury (TBI) showed a reduced 
number of cerebral microhemor-
rhages (CMHs) at follow-up com-
pared with baseline images 
(mean 6 standard deviation, 9.8 
microhemorrhages 6 12.8 vs 
13.7 microhemorrhages 6 16.6; 
P = .019).
 
n The total volume and mean mag-
netic susceptibility of the CMHs 
in patients with TBI both 
decreased over time: 20.85 mm3 
per day 6 1.59 for total volume 
(P = .039) and 20.10 parts per 
billion per day 6 0.14 for mean 
magnetic susceptibility (P = 
.016).
 
n The results suggest that hemosid-
erin products undergo continued, 
subtle evolution in the chronic 
stage of traumatic brain injury.
Implication for Patient Care
 
n Performing MR imaging in 
patients with TBI as early as pos-
sible would facilitate better evalu-
ation of CMHs.
T
raumatic brain injury (TBI) is a 
leading cause of death and dis-
ability in young people at the most 
productive time of their lives (1). Each 
year, an estimated 1.5 million people in 
the United States sustain nonfatal TBI 
(2). It has been estimated that 10%–
20% of military personnel deployed to 
Iraq and Afghanistan have experienced 
TBI, with most cases (80%) being mild 
(3). The damage to the brain from TBI 
has traditionally been grouped into pri-
mary and secondary injuries. Primary 
injuries, such as cerebral microhemor-
rhage (CMH), occur as a direct result 
of the traumatic impact. Primary trau-
matic injuries can trigger secondary in-
sults by increasing the intracranial pres-
sure, which leads to cerebral swelling, 
vasospasm, ischemia, infarction, and 
herniation. Characterization of CMH 
may help to explain clinical symptoms 
and characterize the severity of brain 
damage due to trauma.
Traditionally, T2*-weighted gradient-
recalled-echo (GRE) magnetic res-
onance (MR) imaging has been the 
method of choice to detect CMH. The 
presence, number, distribution, and 
especially size of the round paren-
chymal signal voids have been used

sequence 
with 
a 
repetition 
time 
of 45 msec, a total of five echoes 
 
(time of the first echo, 13 msec) with 
echo spacing of 6 msec, flip angle of 
20°, field of view of 24 3 24 cm, matrix 
of 512 3 256, and 88 sections acquired 
with 1.5-mm thickness.
Data Reconstruction
SWI images were processed from the 
magnitude and phase images of the 
Instruments; Minneapolis, Minn). GRE 
images were acquired by using a two-
dimensional gradient-echo sequence 
with a repetition time (msec)/echo time 
(msec) of 550/30, flip angle of 20°, 
field of view of 24 3 24 cm, matrix of 
288 3 192, and 45 sections acquired 
with 3-mm thickness. The images 
used for SWI and QSM were acquired 
by using a three-dimensional flow-
compensated multiecho gradient-echo 
(7.1%, 43 of 603) were identified who 
had at least one CMH. Six of the pa-
tients were excluded because of se-
vere susceptibility or motion artifacts, 
leaving a total of 37 patients included 
in the conspicuity analysis. A subset 
of the patients (n = 55) returned for 
follow-up imaging. CMH was identified 
in 13 of the 55 patients with follow-up 
images. Table 1 summarizes the demo-
graphics of these patients. For patients 
who underwent multiple follow-up im-
aging examinations, the statistics were 
based on their first follow-up imaging 
examination findings. For patients who 
underwent follow-up imaging, multivi-
tamins, pain relievers, antidepression 
medications, anti-inflammatory med-
ications, and laxatives were the most 
common medications that were taken 
at the time of MR imaging.
Data Acquisition
The protocol included high-spatial-res-
olution ana 
tomic T1-weighted imaging, 
T2-weighted imaging, and T2-weight-
ed fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery 
imaging; four functional MR imaging 
sequences; diffusion-tensor imaging; 
perfusion imaging with dynamic sus-
ceptibility contrast material–enhanced 
imaging; spectroscopic imaging; and 
GRE 
and 
multiecho 
gradient-echo 
imaging. Images were acquired with 
a 3-T whole-body MR imaging unit 
(Discovery MR750; GE Healthcare, 
Milwaukee, Wis) equipped with a 
32-channel phased-array head coil (MR

was 96.4% according to k analysis. 
Figure 2 contains representative SWI, 
GRE, and QSM images in a patient 
with TBI. The arrows indicate a CMH 
that is visible on SWI, GRE, and QSM 
images. Magnetic susceptibility from 
blood products presented in the lesion 
yields the hypointensity at GRE imag-
ing and SWI. In contrast, this lesion 
appears hyperintense on QSM images, 
representing higher magnetic suscepti-
bility compared with its surroundings. 
The arrowheads indicate a CMH that is 
visible on the SWI and QSM images but 
not on the GRE image.
On SWI images, 585 microhemor-
rhages were detected in 37 patients, 
compared with 362 microhemorrhages 
detected on GRE images. Significantly 
more CMHs were detected with SWI 
compared with GRE imaging for indi-
vidual patients (mean 6 standard devi-
ation, 17.7 CMHs 6 20.7 vs 11.0 CMHs 
6 12.6; P , .001). All microhemorrhag-
es were scored as more conspicuous or 
equally conspicuous at SWI compared 
with GRE imaging. In fact, most micro-
hemorrhages (451 of 585, 77%) at SWI 
appeared more conspicuous than on 
GRE images (Fig E1 [online]). Figure 3 
 
illustrates the distribution of the micro-
hemorrhages detected with SWI in the 
cerebral hemispheres. Frontal subcor-
tical regions exhibited the most occur-
rences, with 101 microhemorrhages on 
more conspicuous than that on GRE 
images. k analysis was performed to 
assess the interobserver reliability be-
tween the two radiologists.
For patients who underwent fol-
low-up imaging, QSM images were 
transferred to a Mac Pro desktop com-
puter (Apple, Cupertino, Calif). Man-
ual segmentation was performed on 
QSM images by an MR imaging data 
analyst (W.L., with 15 years of expe-
rience) for each lesion using Analysis 
of Functional NeuroImages software 
(AFNI, National Institute for Men-
tal Health, Bethesda, Md) (20). The 
volume of the lesion, mean magnetic 
susceptibility, and total magnetic sus-
ceptibility were determined on the 
basis of the manually depicted regions 
of interest. The comparison between 
baseline and follow-up imaging findings 
was performed by using a paired t test. 
A one-sample t test was used to assess 
the changes identified between base-
line images and follow-up images. The 
Pearson correlation coefficient was 
used to assess the changes between 
total volume and mean magnetic sus-
ceptibility of CMH.
Results
The two radiologists agreed on findings 
in 41 of 43 patients with microhemor-
rhages. The interobserver reliability 
third echo (echo time of 25 msec) by 
using custom software (6). QSM im-
ages were calculated from the real 
and imaginary data by using the mor-
phology-enabled dipole inversion, or 
MEDI, approach (11,14), which was 
implemented as part of the MEDI 
software (T.L. holds a patent [no. 
US20130221961 A1], which refers to 
the MEDI reconstruction method used 
for reconstructing QSM images). All 
five echoes were used to generate the 
QSM images. Minimum (SWI) and 
maximum (QSM) intensity projections 
were generated over five adjacent sec-
tions (7.5 mm thick).
The reconstructed SWI and QSM 
images, together with GRE images, 
were sent to a picture archiving and 
communication system (Agfa Health-
care, Mortsel, Belgium) for radiologic 
interpretation. CMH was identified by 
two radiologists independently (G.R., 
with 16 years of experience; and K.S., 
with 3 years of experience) on GRE, 
SWI, and QSM images. The reported 
CMH represents the consensus be-
tween the two radiologists. The conspi-
cuity of the CMH at SWI was scored 
relative to the appearance on the con-
ventional GRE images by one radiolo-
gist (K.S.) using the following criteria: 
appearance less conspicuous than that 
on GRE images, appearance equivalent 
to that on GRE images, and appearance

the left side and 73 microhemorrhages 
on the right side, for a combined to-
tal of 30% (174 of 585) of detected 
microhemorrhages. The second most 
affected region was the parietal sub-
cortical region, with 15% of the total 
microhemorrhages (87 of 585 microhe-
morrhages, 41 on the right and 46 on 
the left), followed by the temporal sub-
cortical region, with 14% of the total 
microhemorrhages (79 of 585 microhe-
morrhages, 48 on the right and 31 on 
the left).
When patients were classified into 
four groups on the basis of time since 
injury, the occurrence of CMH in pa-
tients who underwent imaging more 
than 1 year after injury was much lower 
than those who underwent imaging at 
earlier stages: 5.2% (24 of 461 patients) 
versus 24% (six of 25 patients) in pa-
tients who underwent imaging less than 
3 months after injury, 18.4% (seven of 
38 patients) in patients who underwent 
imaging 3–6 months after injury, and 
7.6% (six of 79 patients) in patients 
who underwent imaging 6–12 months 
after injury, respectively (Table 2). Sta-
tistical data for patients with mild TBI 
are presented in Table E1 (online).

under 
went imaging 6 months, 12 
months, and 36 months after injury. It 
is obvious that the number of micro-
hemorrhages in this cluster decreased 
dramatically over time. The evolution of 
microhemorrhages in two other patients 
is presented in Figures E2 and E3 (on-
line). Among the 13 patients, the total 
number of microhemorrhages decreased 
in 11 patients at SWI and in 10 patients 
at QSM (Table 3). The number of CMHs 
detected decreased significantly from 
baseline to follow-up imaging for both 
measurements (P = .013 for SWI and 
 
P = .019 for QSM).
QSM-derived total volume and mean 
magnetic susceptibility of individual 
patients both decreased significantly 
from baseline to follow-up imaging 
(P = .042 for total volume [Fig 5, A], 
 
P = .009 for mean magnetic suscepti-
bility [Fig 5, E]). The total magnetic 
susceptibility showed a trend toward 
decreasing from baseline to follow-up 
imaging (P = .078, Fig 5, C). Figure 5, 
B, D, and F, illustrate the changes in 
the total volume of microhemorrhages, 
total magnetic susceptibility, and mean 
magnetic susceptibility (from baseline 
to follow-up imaging), respectively, for 
each individual patient. The negative 
bars demonstrated that the total vol-
ume of microhemorrhages decreased 
in all 13 patients (Fig 5, B). In all but

two patients, the total magnetic suscep-
tibility of individual patients decreased 
at follow-up imaging compared with 
baseline (Fig 5, D), while the mean 
magnetic susceptibility also decreased 
in another 11 patients. Two of the pa-
tients, however, demonstrated slightly 
increased mean magnetic susceptibility 
(Fig 5, F 
).
In Figure 6, the changes in total 
volume are plotted (Fig 6, A), along 
with total magnetic susceptibility (Fig 
6, B) and mean magnetic susceptibility 
(Fig 6, C) of individual patients ver-
sus time between follow-up and base-
line imaging. The rate of changes in 
terms of CMH volume, total magnetic 
susceptibility, and mean magnetic sus-
ceptibility is shown in Table 4. The rate 
of changes was 20.85 mm3 per day 6 
1.59 for total volume (P = .039), 2238 
ppb per day 6 506 for total magnetic 
susceptibility (P = .058), and 20.10 ppb

application in military clinics is still 
limited. Our results indicate that for 
the identification of the presence or 
absence of CMHs, SWI should be the 
method of choice clinically.
In a subset of patients who under-
went follow-up imaging, quantitative 
measurements of microhemorrhages 
derived from QSM decreased over 
time. Aging of the hemorrhagic lesion 
is largely an unsolved issue. Zhang et 
al observed that the magnetic sus-
ceptibility of thrombus changed from 
strongly paramagnetic to slightly dia-
magnetic at the hyperacute stage by 
using an in vitro flow-driven thrombus 
model (21). We showed, for the first 
per day 6 0.14 for mean susceptibility 
 
(P = .016). No significant correlation 
was observed between the changes in 
total volume and mean magnetic sus-
ceptibility (r = 20.053, P = .864).
Discussion
The current study demonstrated that 
SWI was used to detect a higher 
number of microhemorrhages in mil-
itary patients with TBI and exhibited 
better conspicuity compared with con-
ventional GRE imaging. Even though 
previous studies have shown that SWI 
is superior to GRE in the detection 
of hemorrhage (17–19), its clinical

time to our knowledge, the longitudi-
nal evolution of CMH in the chronic 
stage. Conventional teaching holds 
that the brain has no mechanism to 
remove hemosiderin once it is formed, 
and it is therefore present in the brain 
for the rest of one’s life as a marker of 
prior hemorrhage. Our results, how-
ever, demonstrated that not only the 
total number of microhemorrhages 
decreased from baseline to follow-up 
imaging, but quantitative measure-
ments, such as total volume of micro-
hemorrhages and mean magnetic sus-
ceptibility, also decreased over time. 
In a recent study, investigators report-
ed that the magnetic susceptibilities 
of multiple sclerosis lesions relative to 
normal-appearing white matter were 
higher for early to intermediately aged 
nonenhanced lesions than for chronic 
nonenhanced lesions (22). Since iron 
is the major contributor to the mag-
netic susceptibility in both CMH and 
multiple sclerosis lesions, both results 
suggest that the iron concentration 
in brain lesions continues a chronic,

most concentrated in the center, the 
smaller the volume drawn, the larger 
the mean susceptibility. Therefore, 
the volume of the CMH is negatively 
correlated with the mean magnetic 
susceptibility for a specific lesion. Our 
results demonstrated that both the 
size and mean magnetic susceptibility 
of CMH decreased over time. There-
fore, it is unlikely that a subjective bias 
toward later imaging examinations 
caused the results. Nevertheless, this 
study was a retrospective study from 
a larger research project. All patients 
underwent a prolonged neuroimaging 
protocol to apply state-of-the-art MR 
imaging techniques in the investigation 
of TBI. The multiecho images used for 
SWI and QSM analysis were acquired 
near the end of the 90-minute exami-
nation. As a result, some images were 
subject to moderate motion artifacts. 
This was especially pronounced in 
the follow-up imaging examination of 
one patient, which may explain why 
the mean magnetic susceptibility of a 
patient increased at the follow-up im-
aging examination, even though it was 
pointed out by the radiologist (G.R.) 
that this lesion was less conspicuous at 
follow-up imaging.
In summary, in the current study 
we found that the number of micro-
hemorrhages and QSM-derived mea-
surements of microhemorrhages all 
decreased over time, suggesting that he-
mosiderin products undergo continued, 
subtle evolution in the chronic stage 
of TBI. However, our study included a 
limited number of patients who under-
went follow-up imaging examinations. 
In future studies, this method will need 
to be replicated in a larger patient pop-
ulation. Furthermore, by correlating 
microhemorrhages with regional brain 
volumes, abnormalities such as fiber 
discontinuities or hyperintensities on 
T2-weighted fluid attenuation inversion-
recovery images will facilitate the inves-
tigation of this disease.

similar for groups who underwent im-
aging 3–6 months (four of 38 patients, 
10.5%) and 6–12 months (11 of 79 pa-
tients, 13.9%) after injury. However, 
the incidence of CMH was much lower 
in the 6–12-month group (7.6% vs 
18.4%), suggesting that the injury se-
verity in these patients was not the pri-
mary cause for this observation. The 
low incidence of TBI-related CMH in 
the chronic TBI population and higher 
incidence of TBI-related CMH at ear-
lier stages of TBI could be related to 
evolution of the blood products over 
time.
There are some limitations in the 
current study. The volume assessment 
of the CMH lesions was performed 
manually. Owing to the small size 
of the lesions, this process might be 
prone to measurement errors. In the 
longitudinal study, the region of inter-
est drawing was not completely blind-
ed to the longitudinal time point, since 
this was a 2-year study and some of the 
baseline images were already analyzed 
prior to follow-up image analysis. Be-
cause iron in microhemorrhage is the 
subtle evolution, even in the chronic 
stage.
The incidence of CMH in this TBI 
population was lower than initially 
anticipated. In our military subject 
population, most of the traumatic in-
juries occurred in theater (an area 
where warfare events occur), where 
there is no access to MR imaging in 
the acute phase. The median time to 
MR imaging for our subject population 
was 856 days after injury. However, 
the percentage of patients with iden-
tified 
microhemorrhages 
increased 
dramatically when MR imaging was 
performed closer to the injury date. 
Microhemorrhages were identified in 
24% of the patients who underwent 
imaging within 3 months after injury 
and in 18.4% of patients who under-
went imaging 3–6 months after injury. 
This finding is consistent with previous 
studies of TBI in civilian populations 
that demonstrated higher incidences 
of central nervous system hemorrhage 
in the acute or subacute time frame 
(17–19). The percentages of patients 
with moderate to severe TBI were
