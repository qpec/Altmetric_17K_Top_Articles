Abstract
Deleterious mutations are expected to evolve under negative selection and are usually purged from the population.
However, deleterious alleles segregate in the human population and some disease-associated variants are maintained at
considerable frequencies. Here, we test the hypothesis that balancing selection may counteract purifying selection in
neighboring regions and thus maintain deleterious variants at higher frequency than expected from their detrimental
fitness effect. We first show in realistic simulations that balancing selection reduces the density of polymorphic sites
surrounding a locus under balancing selection, but at the same time markedly increases the population frequency of the
remaining variants, including even substantially deleterious alleles. To test the predictions of our simulations empirically,
we then use whole-exome sequencing data from 6,500 human individuals and focus on the most established example for
balancing selection in the human genome, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Our analysis shows an elevated
frequency of putatively deleterious coding variants in nonhuman leukocyte antigen (non-HLA) genes localized in the
MHC region. The mean frequency of these variants declined with physical distance from the classical HLA genes,
indicating dependency on genetic linkage. These results reveal an indirect cost of the genetic diversity maintained by
balancing selection, which has hitherto been perceived as mostly advantageous, and have implications both for the
evolution of recombination and also for the epidemiology of various MHC-associated diseases.
Key words: balancing selection, exome, simulations, deleterious variation, mutation load, MHC/HLA.
Introduction
A large number of population genetics studies point to the
existence of numerous mildly deleterious alleles segregating in
the human population (Henn et al. 2015). This abundance of
deleterious alleles is evident from the comparison of human
DNA polymorphism to human–chimpanzee sequence diver-
gence (Bustamante et al. 2005), from the analysis of allele
frequency distribution (Kryukov et al. 2007, 2009; Boyko
et al. 2008) and estimated allelic ages (Kiezun et al. 2013).
Deleterious alleles are present in individual human genomes
at functionally significant sites in both protein-coding genes
and regulatory regions (Maurano et al. 2012; Fu et al. 2013).
Understanding the maintenance of deleterious variation in
the population is critically important for evolutionary models
of complex traits including common human diseases.
Persistence of common diseases is paradoxical from the evo-
lutionary standpoint, and the stable existence of deleterious
variation in spite of the action of purifying selection requires
an explanation.
Different hypotheses have been put forward to explain the
occurrence of deleterious genetic variants in the population.
Mutation-selection balance in combination with demogra-
phy and genetic drift certainly account for a significant part
of the genetic load and for the persistence of rare deleterious
variation (Dudley et al. 2012; Fu et al. 2013). The occurrence of
more frequent variants, on the other hand, is commonly hy-
pothesized to involve selective forces favoring genetic diver-
sity. However, selection should not necessarily target the
variants in question. With the improved understanding of
the recombination landscape and of the extent of genetic
linkage, it is becoming increasingly clear that many sites in
the genome do not evolve completely independently and
allele frequency changes may be influenced by variation at
neighboring linked sites (Gillespie 2000; Charlesworth et al.
2003; Barton 2010).
Previous research has already addressed the evolutionary
fate of genetic variation around sites under selection, focusing
mostly on neutral variation. Background selection has been
shown to result in the reduction of neutral diversity sur-
rounding regions under purifying selection (Charlesworth
et al. 1993). Genetic hitchhiking events associated with pos-
itive selection generally eliminate surrounding genetic

 variation. On the other hand, they transiently increase allele
frequencies of variants residing on the same haplotype as the
positively selected variant (Maynard Smith and Haigh 1974;
Fay and Wu 2000; Chun and Fay 2011), and theoretical anal-
ysis and empirical data suggest that hitchhiking events can
also elevate the frequency of deleterious variants (Chun and
Fay 2011; Hartfield and Otto 2011; Marsden et al. 2016).
Conversely, existing recessive deleterious variation may also
slow the fixation of beneficial alleles on the same haplotype
(Assaf et al. 2015). However, since hitchhiking eventually re-
duces the absolute amount of genetic diversity, it is not suf-
ficient to explain regions with generally elevated levels of
sequence diversity across the genome.
In contrast, balancing selection leads to a long-term per-
sistence of common genetic variation in surrounding loci
(Charlesworth 2006; Gao et al. 2015). Consequently, it has
been proposed that balancing selection may also lead to an
excess of deleterious variation around the balanced locus.
This scenario is supported by studies of neutral variation
that showed increased variation in regions linked to loci un-
der both simple and multilocus balancing selection (Kaplan
et al. 1988; Grimsley et al. 1998; O’hUigin et al. 2000; Navarro
and Barton 2002). However, a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical investigation of this scenario for deleterious vari-
ants, which is of critical interest for both population genetics
and medical genetics, is lacking so far.
The prevalence of balancing selection in the human pop-
ulation and its role in shaping genetic variation is still debated.
In contrast to models developed in the 1960s (e.g., Lewontin
and Kojima 1960), studies of the genomic era have generally
assumed that balancing selection is an exception rather than
the rule (Asthana et al. 2005; Bubb et al. 2006). However, an
accumulating number of recent studies are identifing geno-
mic features characteristic of balancing selection (Bustamante
et al. 2005; Andre
´s et al. 2009; Fumagalli et al. 2009; Sellis et al.
2011; Gokcumen et al. 2013; Leffler et al. 2013; DeGiorgio et al.
2014; Teixeira et al. 2015).
A classical locus to investigate the effect of balancing se-
lection on multiple sites and its influence on neighboring
variation is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).
The MHC is one of the most prominent examples of balanc-
ing selection in the vertebrate genome. This is thought to be
due to the so-called classical MHC genes (in humans called
human leukocyte antigen; HLA), whose products present an-
tigenic peptides on the cell surface and by that play a key role
in the adaptive immune response (Neefjes et al. 2011). These
classical HLA genes are scattered across the MHC region and
exhibit exceptional allelic polymorphism and an extreme level
of heterozygosity, which is thought to increase pathogen re-
sistance and thus to be maintained by pathogen-mediated
balancing selection (Trowsdale 2011). Based on well-
documented signatures of balancing selection at the classical
HLA genes, this gene complex thus provides a perfect study
system to explore the effect of balancing selection on the
frequency of linked deleterious variation. In fact, a striking
feature of the MHC, potentially related to the maintenance
of deleterious variation, is that the MHC region is highly en-
riched in variants associated with common human diseases
identified by Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS;
fig. 1). Many of the GWAS peaks are not caused by variation
in classical HLA genes, and a significant number of pheno-
types associated with genetic variants within the MHC region
are not classic autoimmune or infectious diseases (Trowsdale
2011).
To investigate the potential of balancing selection for
maintaining deleterious genetic variation, we first use a for-
ward simulation approach and then analyze empirical data to
test the predictions of the simulations. Previously, the large
scale sequencing data required to compare the mutational
load in the MHC region against the rest of the genome has
been lacking. Here. we make use of a whole-exome sequence
data set of about 6,500 individuals, which provides detailed
population-level information of coding sequence variation
across the entire human genome.
Results
Simulating Multilocus Balancing Selection
We used forward simulations to investigate the effect of
multilocus balancing selection at HLA genes on the evolution
of deleterious genetic variants throughout the MHC region.
The simulations were based on empirical parameter values
from the human MHC region and included a central HLA
gene, surrounded by non-HLA regions that represented the
variation in neighboring non-HLA genes. In order to simulate
multilocus selection, multiple scattered sites along the virtual
HLA gene evolved under different HLA selection scenarios:
either neutrally, under balancing selection, or, as a contrast,
under recurrent sweeps of positive selection. We then ex-
plored the effect of these different HLA selection scenarios
on the evolution of variants in HLA-neighboring regions that
evolved themselves under different levels of purifying selection.
Our simulations showed that multilocus balancing selec-
tion at HLA generally reduces the number of segregating sites
in the neighboring sequence regions compared to a scenario
with no selection at HLA (fig. 2a). With moderate or high
levels of purifying selection acting at neighboring sites, the
number of segregating sites was even lower. Interestingly, the
reduction in the density of segregating sites by balancing

 selection was mainly due to the removal of sites with rare
variants (fig. 2b). And as nucleotide diversity (p) is strongly
dependent on variant frequencies, the removal of rare
variants had little effect on overall diversity in the neighboring
regions. Instead, balancing selection at the HLA led to a sig-
nificant increase in nucleotide diversity in the neighboring
regions surrounding the HLA and was elevated even in the
presence of moderate purifying selection (fig. 2c). Nucleotide
diversity increased in spite of the reduction in number of
segregating sites because derived allele frequencies at the re-
maining sites were, on average, strongly elevated, resulting in
a site frequency spectrum that was enriched with intermedi-
ate frequency alleles (fig. 3a). This increase in the number of
segregating sites with intermediate frequency alleles then
caused an overall increase in nucleotide diversity, irrespective
of the significant loss of rare variants around the HLA gene. As
expected, increasing purifying selection in the surrounding
region reduced allele frequencies overall. However, relative
to the other HLA selection scenarios, balancing selection at
the HLA in all simulated cases maintained a significant frac-
tion of deleterious variation at moderate frequencies coun-
teracting the effect of purifying selection (Wilcoxon rank-sum
test, all P< 0.001; fig. 3b–d). The effect of balancing selection
on variant frequency in the neighboring regions was strongly
dependent on the rate of recombination: Artificially increas-
ing the recombination rate by an order of magnitude basically
removed the effect, while an equivalent reduction in recom-
bination led to a substantially stronger enrichment for inter-
mediate frequency variants at all levels of purifying selection
(supplementary figs. S1 and S2, Supplementary Material
online).
We contrasted these results with the alternative sce-
nario of recurrent complete selective sweeps at the HLA
due to continuous environmental change, for example
constantly adapting or newly arising pathogens with
“sweeping” selective effects (e.g., the Bubonic plague).
Similarly to the balancing selection scenario, recurrent
sweeps in HLA genes led to a reduction in the number
of segregating sites in the neighboring regions (fig. 2a).
Compared to the balancing selection scenario, this reduc-
tion in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density is
stronger if there is no purifying selection on the surround-
ing regions and weaker when purifying selection exerts
pressure on the neighboring sequence. This reduction is
primarily affecting SNPs with common derived alleles,
with almost no removal of rare variants (fig. 2b).
Consequently, in sharp contrast with the balancing selec-
tion scenario, nucleotide diversity is reduced rather than
elevated (fig. 2c).
Overall, our simulations showed that multilocus balancing
selection can lead to a distinct signature of a reduced number
of polymorphic sites with elevated allele frequencies. The el-
evated site frequency spectrum suggests that balancing selec-
tion has the realistic potential to significantly increase of even
frequencies of strongly deleterious variants in regions around
the classical HLA genes.

data set of the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (from a

 genes within the MHC region). Excluding 11 of the latter that
are classical HLA genes, expected to evolve under balancing
selection, our analyses of the MHC region included variant
data from 113 genes. The median number of polymorphic
sites averaged 48 for these genes, significantly lower than the
exome-wide median of 74 (Wilcoxon rank-sum test,
P< 0.001; fig. 4a) and was mainly due to a difference in the
number of sites with low frequency variants (fig. 4b). Our
simulations also showed fewer polymorphic sites under the
balancing selection scenarios than without it. The reduced
number of polymorphic sites affected all SNP categories, in-
cluding variants likely to be deleterious (as predicted by
PolyPhen-2 [Adzhubey et al. 2010]); this distinguishes the
effect of balancing selection from other scenarios, such as
genetic hitchhiking during selective sweeps where the higher
frequency synonymous variants are preferentially removed
from the population (Chun and Fay 2011). In contrast, the
population frequency of derived alleles at polymorphic sites
was substantially elevated within the MHC region compared
to the rest of the genome (fig. 5a).
This result is not caused by local differences in mutation
rate, since the rate of de novo mutations (as estimated from
trio sequencing; Francioli et al. 2015) in the MHC region does
not differ from the average exome-wide rate (Wilcoxon rank-
sum test, MHC vs., whole exome, P> 0.05). The frequencies
of derived alleles correlated with their position relative to the
nearest classical HLA locus: derived alleles at sites physically
close to an HLA locus were at higher frequencies than at sites
further away (Spearman’s q ¼ �0.14, P< 0.001; fig. 5b), sug-
gesting that their frequencies are influenced by linkage dis-
equilibrium to HLA genes.
Since we were especially interested in potentially deleteri-
ous variants, we focused our analyses on loss-of-function var-
iants and missense variants classified as “probably damaging”
by PolyPhen-2 (Adzhubey et al. 2010), which are expected to
evolve under moderate to strong purifying selection. This
expectation was supported by a substantially lower exome-
wide derived allele frequency of “probably damaging” vari-
ants, compared with variants classified as “benign” (Wilcoxon
rank-sum test, both P< 0.001; supplementary fig. S3,
Supplementary Material online). We found a significant ele-
vation in average derived allele frequencies within the MHC
region, for both probably damaging missense variants
and loss-of-function variants, compared to the average
frequency across the entire exome (Wilcoxon rank-sum
test, both P< 0.001; fig. 6). This shift in the variant frequencies
was observed within both African American and European
American subpopulations of the ESP6500 data (supplemen

Discussion
Our simulations of genomic regions around a classical HLA
gene showed that balancing selection has a similar effect on
the number of linked variants as recurrent sweeps of positive
selection in the way it reduces the absolute number of seg-
regating sites. However, while positive selection simulta-
neously reduces the frequency of variants at the remaining
sites, balancing selection has the opposite effect and substan-
tially increases derived allele frequencies, leading to a site fre-
quency spectrum with an excess of intermediate frequency
alleles. As expected, derived allele frequencies also depended

 on the strength of selection against the deleterious variants.
This is in agreement with previous studies on the evolution of
neutral variation around balanced loci, showing generally el-
evated sequence diversity (Kaplan et al. 1988; Grimsley et al.
1998; Horton et al. 1998; O’hUigin et al. 2000; Navarro and
Barton 2002; Connallon and Clark 2013).
Results from deep population sequencing data supported
our simulation results empirically, by showing the same pat-
tern of a reduced number of polymorphic sites but elevated
allele frequencies in the MHC region compared to the rest of
the exome. This observation held for both loss-of-function
mutations, which are likely to be highly deleterious, as well as
presumably deleterious variants, some of which reside in
genes with known disease associations, again suggesting mod-
erate to strong purifying selection. The dependency of allele
frequencies on the proximity to classical HLA genes supports
the notion that balancing selection acts on neighboring var-
iation via linkage disequilibrium. Independent support for our
findings comes also from two earlier studies that described
elevated levels of genetic diversity around specific MHC genes
and suggested that this might be maintained by balancing
selection on the given neighboring MHC locus (Horton et al.
1998; Shiina et al. 2006).
The observed reduction in the number of polymorphic
sites in regions close to loci under multilocus balancing selec-
tion both in simulations and empirical data is an interesting
observation, given the expectation that balancing selection
generally increases genetic diversity around the loci under
selection (Navarro and Barton 2002; Charlesworth 2006).
This is also a significant difference to the effect of genetic
hitchhiking after selective sweeps, which has been shown to
reduce the number of neutral variants in neighboring regions
but not to affect the number of deleterious variants (Chun
and Fay 2011). However, the unexpected reduction in the
number of polymorphic sites with balancing selection at
the neighboring HLA is likely due to the recurrent occurrence
of new mutations at one of the balanced HLA sites, a central
aspect of our multilocus simulation model. Such a new var-
iant, being subject to overdominant selection, would drive
the haplotype on which it occurred to higher frequency (but
not to fixation), dragging along any linked neighboring vari-
ant. At the same time the rising frequency of this haplotype
would replace other haplotypes that do not carry the new
balanced variant. Consequently, a polymorphic site linked to
a balanced locus can have two fates: Either one of its minor
alleles is present on the new balanced haplotype, so that its
frequency rises together with the balanced haplotype, or the
new balanced haplotype does not carry the site’s minor al-
leles, so that its frequency declines. For very low frequency
variants (e.g., singletons) the latter fate will potentially lead to
a complete loss of the minor allele at this neighboring site,
and thus to a complete loss of the segregating site. Together
these two mechanisms lead to the signature that we observe:
Less polymorphic sites around the HLA gene but a higher
derived allele frequency at those sites that remain in the
population.
Such a scenario of recurrent but incomplete sweeps could
indeed result from several mechanisms of balancing selection,
such as negative frequency-dependent selection and fluctu-
ating selection in time and space, which are also thought to
affect the HLA (Meyer and Thomson 2001; Spurgin and
Richardson 2010). Previous theoretical work has even sug-
gested that symmetrical overdominance alone is not suffi-
cient to explain the entire allelic diversity seen at the HLA
(De Boer et al. 2004). Furthermore, the HLA exhibits identity-
by-descent patterns that cannot be explained by ancient bal-
ancing selection, suggesting ongoing selection and very recent
selective events (Albrechtsen et al. 2010), for instance through
local adaptation after human migration and/or drastic epi-
demic events in recent human history (Zhou et al. 2016). All
these processes are likely to contribute to the distribution of
linked deleterious variation around the classical HLA genes.
Mechanistically, it had also been proposed that the exces-
sive heterozygosity in the MHC region, caused by balancing
selection, may reduce the phenotypic expression of recessive
deleterious variants, rendering purging mechanisms less effec-
tive and thus allowing for the accumulation of a recessive
“sheltered load” that could ultimately even contribute to

 inbreeding depression (Charlesworth and Willis 2009). Such a
scenario was first invoked to explain the unexpectedly long
terminal branches in genealogies of genes under balancing
selection (Uyenoyama 1997; for a schematic see van
Oosterhout 2009) and has since been investigated by theo-
retical and empirical studies on the self-incompatibility de-
termining S locus, the most compelling example for balancing
selection in plants. Those studies suggested that recessive
deleterious mutations may accumulate around the S locus,
presumably protected from purifying selection by the exces-
sive heterozygosity in this region, and, once established, con-
tribute to the disadvantage of homozygotes (Stone 2004;
Llaurens et al. 2009). Such a sheltered load mechanism has
later also been proposed to contribute to the diversity found
in the MHC region in vertebrates (van Oosterhout 2009;
Llaurens et al. 2012). However, in contrast to previous work,
our models are based on empirical parameter values, showing
an accumulating deleterious load under realistic levels of re-
combination. In addition we here provide direct empirical
evidence of elevated deleterious variation in the human
MHC region. While it is conceivable that some of these ob-
served deleterious variants represent such a sheltered load,
our simulations assume additive (and not recessive) effects
for all non-HLA variants, indicating that there must be other
mechanisms besides the “heterozygosity shelter” for recessive
variants that contribute to the observed deleterious load.
Contributing to the observed excess of deleterious variants
could also be a local alteration of the effective population size,
and consequently of the efficacy of selection. Balancing selec-
tion, and specifically symmetrical overdominance, can lead to
a limited number of dominating haplotypes that are stably
balanced at intermediate frequencies in the population.
Without recombination, such dominating haplotypes could
be seen as essentially subdividing the population in this ge-
nomic region (Charlesworth 2006), so that genetic drift of
linked variants occurs only within the same haplotype back-
ground. This would result in a locally reduced effective pop-
ulation size per haplotype, rendering selection less efficient
within a given haplotype background, even though, when
estimated across all haplotypes, balancing selection increases
the effective size of the total population (Charlesworth 2009).
This phenomenon is strongly based on genetic linkage, and
with recombination the effect on linked variants will quickly
break down with increasing distance to the balanced locus
(Hudson and Kaplan 1988). Such a dependence between the
excess deleterious load and the rate of recombination could
indeed be observed both in the simulations and in the em-
pirical data (here using physical distance along the chromo-
some as a proxy for genetic linkage).
Overall, our results show that balancing selection has the
potential to maintain deleterious genetic variants at consid-
erable frequencies in natural populations, especially if they are
only moderately deleterious, for example causing late-onset
autoimmunity. The extent of the deleterious mutational load
on a given MHC haplotype will ultimately depend on its
aggregate detrimental effect and the role of linked HLA alleles,
resulting from an evolutionary trade-off between the antag-
onistic effects of the number (and severity) of accumulating
deleterious variants and the selective advantage of individual
allelic variability at the classical HLA genes. Interestingly, more
divergent HLA genotypes are assumed to confer broader
immune-surveilance against antigens (Lenz 2011), and a pos-
itive correlation between the pathogen diversity in a given
population and its HLA allele pool diversity has been reported
(Prugnolle et al. 2005). It could thus be hypothesized that
environments with higher pathogen diversity, and thus stron-
ger selection for high individual allelic diversity at HLA, may
allow for the maintenance of MHC haplotypes with a larger
deleterious load (Dean et al. 2002). Once the selective path-
ogenic pressure declines (either through host migration to a
less pathogenic environment or through environmental
changes), this could then result in increased expression of
phenotypes associated with the deleterious load. Indeed, first
evidence associating heterozygosity at the HLA with increased
risk for some autoimmune diseases has been reported (Lenz
et al. 2015), but further analyses are required to evaluate this
hypothesis.
The observed effect of balancing selection on linked vari-
ation is evidently dependent on recombination rate around
the locus under balancing selection (Hudson and Kaplan
1988; Barton 2010). The MHC region is in fact known to
harbor a substantial number of recombination hot-spots
(de Bakker et al. 2006), which might have evolved due to
the above described dynamics. On the other hand, the
MHC region also exhibits even more extreme cases of multilo-
cus balancing selection than modeled here, where LD spans
across separate HLA loci. For instance, the well-documented
COX haplotype covers the entire MHC region and has a
population frequency of about 10% in Northern Europe
(Stewart et al. 2004). Epistasis among different HLA genes,
for instance due to advantageous allele combinations, may
select against recombination and maintain such long-range
haplotypes (Penman et al. 2013). The genome-wide extent of
the observed effect remains to be investigated, but given the
increasing number of regions detected to evolve under bal-
ancing selection (Leffler et al. 2013), there is reason to expect
that this mechanism may significantly contribute to the prev-
alence of heritable human diseases.

GWAS Summary
Data for GWAS hit summary was downloaded from the
NHGRI GWAS catalog (available at: http://www.genome.
gov/gwastudies, accessed [February 15, 2015]) (Welter et al.
2014). This catalog represents a comprehensive collection of
published GWAS (currently 1,755 studies), including the in-
vestigated trait and the chromosomal location of one or more
(median: 4) independent associations per study. For some
traits the data contains multiple studies (top 5: type 2 diabe-
tes: 37, breast cancer: 26, schizophrenia: 22, body mass index:
21, height: 21; median number of studies per trait: 1), but
preferentially lists novel associations to avoid redundancy.
While this data may suffer from a bias toward overstudied
traits, it also reflects the frequency and thus importance of a
given trait in the population. We focused only on autosomal

 associations and chromosome length was standardized to 30
location bins per chromosome for better visualization.
Simulating Multilocus Balancing Selection
In order to test whether balancing selection on a particular
locus can lead to a shift in the site frequency spectrum of
adjacent genomic regions and prevent deleterious mutations
from being purged by purifying selection, we employed a
forward simulation approach. To this end, we developed
the program Forward Simulation (available at http://forward
simulation.sourceforge.net), which is based on the Wright–
Fisher model and allows to define distinct selection regimes
for separate regions or sites of the simulated genome. The
program uses a multiplicative fitness framework with diallelic
sites, with fitness f¼ (1 þ sh)n, where s and h are the selection
and dominance coefficients per site, respectively, and n is the
number of sites in the genome. A negative selection coeffi-
cient s leads to negative (purifying) selection and vice versa.
The simulated genome contained a virtual HLA gene of the
median genomic length of classical HLA genes (start of first
exon to end of last exon, including introns; 5,385bp). This
HLA gene was flanked on both sides by surrounding regions
(set to evolve under different levels of purifying selection).
The length of these two regions equaled half the median
distance between adjacent classical HLA genes in the MHC
region (total length: 37,122bp). Following the multilocus bal-
ancing selection scenario by Navarro and Barton (2002), a
number of polymorphic sites along the virtual HLA gene
were specified to evolve under the HLA selection regime at
the beginning of each simulation (after burnin). Once the
sites had been specified, they were free to maintain, lose, or
regain polymorphism throughout the simulation. These sites
mimic the functional polymorphism seen in classical HLA
genes, where sites along the exons coding for the antigen
binding groove of the HLA molecule show variation that is
thought to evolve under balancing selection (Reche and
Reinherz 2003; Furlong and Yang 2008). See supplementary
fig. S5, Supplementary Material online, for a schematic of the
simulated genome. For exploring the effect of balancing se-
lection on surrounding regions in a near-realistic scenario of
MHC evolution, we used empirical values from the literature
for all fixed parameters: effective population size Ne¼ 10,000
(Takahata et al. 1995), mutation rate m¼ 1.38e-8 (Scally and
Durbin 2012), recombination rate r¼ 0.44cM/Mb (de Bakker
et al. 2006; Taylan and Altiok 2012). Average selection at the
classical HLA genes has been estimated as s¼ 0.013 (Satta
et al. 1994; Slatkin and Muirhead 2000; Yasukochi and Satta
2013). Following Navarro and Barton (2002), we simulate
multilocus balancing selection as symmetrical overdomi-
nance, setting the selection coefficient sHLA for all sites with
HLA selection regime to 0.013 for heterozygotes and to 0
for homozygotes. For simulation scenarios with no selection
at HLA, sHLA was set to 0. The scenarios with recurrent selec-
tive sweeps at the HLA gene were simulated by setting
sHLA¼ 0.013, with a dominance coefficient h¼ 0.5, and re-
verting sites with fixed derived allele back to the ancestral
allele in order to allow for sweeps to reoccur. The number of
sites to evolve under the HLA selection regime was 117, which
corresponds to the average number of amino acid residues
coding for the peptide binding domain of the classical HLA
molecules. All other sites along the entire genome were set to
evolve either neutrally (s at non-HLA or “neighboring” sites:
snb¼ 0) or under purifying selection, with snb ranging from
�0.0001 to �0.01, and dominance h¼ 0.5 (additive). The
simulations were run for 150,000 generations, after an initial
burnin of 100,000 generations intended to generate an equi-
librium level of neutral variation (p � 4Nm; supplementary fig.
S6, Supplementary Material online). During the burnin pe-
riod, selection at the HLA gene was turned off (sHLA¼ 0), so
that all sites evolved according to the specified level of puri-
fying selection (snb¼ 0 to �0.01), including the possibility for
fixation of derived alleles. Each simulated scenario was repli-
cated 100 times. Reported results are based only on variants
in the surrounding region, thus excluding the virtual HLA
gene.
Exome Sequencing Data and MHC Region
Genome-wide coding sequence variation data of about 6,500
human individuals were obtained from the Exome Variant
Server (NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP6500 re-
lease), Seattle, WA; http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; ac-
cessed 11/2012) and parsed with custom scripts. Only
variants that passed the internal EVS quality filter were re-
corded and their number and frequencies averaged per gene
to account for differences in cds length among genes.
Missense variants were further split into functional categories,
as determined by Polyphen-2 (Adzhubey et al. 2010). All
functional annotations used here are based on the nonrefer-
ence allele. For simplicity we subsequently call this the derived
allele, even though the true ancestral state may not in all cases
be reliably resolved. However, our analyses rely only on the
functional annotation of a given allele and are independent of
the true ancestral/derived state.
The 3.5Mb region of the classical MHC on chromosome 6
was defined following Horton et al. (2004), starting with the
gene ZFP57 at position chr6:29640169 and ending with the
gene HCG24 at position chr6:33115544. This excludes the ex-
tended MHC regions which contain large numbers of olfac-
tory receptor and histone genes that are likely subject to
different types of selection regimes and are thus outside the
scope of this study. Within the classical MHC region, the
ESP6500 data provided sequence variation data for 124 genes,
which corresponds to 73.4% of the known protein-coding
genes in this region. This fraction corresponds well with the
genome-wide proportion (73.5%) of genes sufficiently cov-
ered by the ESP data. Eleven of the 124 genes covered in
the MHC region are classical HLA genes (class I: HLA-A, -B,
-C; class II: HLA-DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQA2, -DQB1, -DRA,
-DRB1, -DRB5).
Site frequency spectra (SFS), based on derived allele fre-
quencies, were obtained for each of the variant categories
across the entire exome as well as for only the MHC region.
SFS were compared using the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-
sum test. Within the MHC region, we also calculated for each
variant the distance in base pairs from the nearest classical
HLA locus and correlated this distance with the derived allele

 frequency using Spearman correlation. We furthermore com-
pared observed parameter values in the MHC region with
genome-wide expectations by Monte Carlo sampling (1,000
replications) from all covered genes in the ESP6500 data. Data
analysis was done in R (ver. 3.1.2) (R Development Core Team
2014).
Disease associations for genes in the MHC region with the
highest average frequency of potentially deleterious variants
were obtained from NHGRI GWAS catalog (see above) and
the NIH Genetic Association Database (available at: http://
geneticassociationdb.nih.gov, last accessed December 14,
2013) (Becker et al. 2004).
