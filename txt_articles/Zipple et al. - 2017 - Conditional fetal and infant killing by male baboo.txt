Sexuallyselected feticide—the death of infants in utero as a result of male behav-
iour—has only rarely been described or analysed, although it is presumed to be
favoured by the same selective pressures that favour sexually selected infanti-
cide. To test this hypothesis, we measured the frequency of feticide and
infanticide by male baboons of the Amboseli basin in Kenya, and examined
which characteristics of a male and his environment made him more likely to
commit feticide and/or infanticide. We found a dramatic increase in fetal
and infant death rates, but no increase in death rates of 1- to 2-year-old individ-
uals, following the immigration of males who stood to benefit from feticide and
infanticide. Specifically, fetal and infant death rates were highest following
immigrations in which: (i) the immigrant male rapidly attained high rank,
(ii) that male remained consistently resident in the group for at least three
months, (iii) food availability and social group range overlap was relatively
low and (iv) relatively many pregnant females and/or dependent infants
were present. Together, these results provide strong evidence for the existence
of both sexually selected feticide and infanticide in our population, and they
indicate that feticide and infanticide are conditional male behavioural strategies
employed under particular circumstances.
1. Introduction
Sexually selected feticide and infanticide are behaviours that involve spon-
taneous abortions and the death of infants as a result of male behaviour,
yield reproductive benefits to those same males and alter population structures.
Infanticide has been the subject of dozens of studies in wild animal populations
[1] and has been discussed as an important mechanism in the evolution of pri-
mate sociality in particular [2–8]. By contrast, studies of feticide are very rare.
Within primates, case studies of apparent sexually selected feticide have pre-
viously been described in savannah baboons from Amboseli [7,9,10] and in
langurs at Jodhpur [11–13], but no long-term study has quantitatively assessed
the population-wide prevalence of sexually selected feticide.
The sexual selection hypothesis for infanticide [14,15] posits that males derive
a fitness benefit from killing infants by accelerating the return of lactating females
to ovulatory cycling. This hypothesis yields three main predictions: (i) that infants
will be killed by unrelated males, (ii) that inter-birth intervals of mothers of infants
that are killed will be shorter than they would be in the absence of infanticide
and (iii) that infanticidal males are likely to mate with infants’ mothers follow-
ing infant death [16]. Among mammals, sexually selected infanticide has been
documented in lions [17], cetaceans [18,19], murid rodents [20] and especially
in primates, where support for the sexual selection hypothesis has been found
in 84 populations of 54 species of primates [1]. In both single-male and multi-
male social groups, infanticide is most often committed by recently immigrated
males (e.g. ursine colobus monkeys: [21]; chacma baboons: [22]). The frequency

 of infanticide varies within and across populations of a given
species, but sources of variance in the frequency of infanticide
are poorly understood [22–24].
Males will experience selection to reduce waiting time
for reproductive opportunities. By killing an infant, an
infanticidal male causes the infant’s mother to return to a
reproductive state sooner than she otherwise would by
eliminating a period of continued lactation during which she
would not be cycling. A feticidal male gains even greater repro-
ductive benefits, as he is able to eliminate periods of both
pregnancy and lactation. Feticide and infanticide can be con-
sidered closely related phenomena, differing primarily in the
stage of development at which the developing offspring
dies [8]. In a social group in which both feticide and infanti-
cide are possible, committing feticide provides a male with
greater reproductive benefits than does committing infanticide,
and committing both feticide and infanticide creates greater
reproductive opportunity still (see electronic supplementary
material, figure S1).
Importantly, sexually selected feticide is related to, but dis-
tinct from, the Bruce effect—a phenomenon in which pregnant
females spontaneously terminate their pregnancies following
their exposure to a non-paternal breeding male [25,26]. Direct
or indirect evidence of a Bruce effect has been documented
in captive rodents, [27], lions [28] and gelada monkeys [29].
Notably, a recent study identified a Bruce effect in domestic
horses [30], leading to the suggestion that previous studies
suggesting sexually selected feticide in equids [31,32] were
instead documenting a Bruce effect [29,30].
Under a Bruce effect, physical contact with the non-
paternal male is not necessary to induce abortion. In the
case of rodents, chemical signals have been demonstrated to
be the proximate mechanisms for pregnancy termination
[33–35]. Because the Bruce effect is mediated by signals
that are readily received by all females in a population, the
Bruce effect tends to yield very high rates of abortion follow-
ing the replacement of a breeding male (for example,
termination of 71–76% of pregnancies in mice [25], 81% of
early pregnancies in prairie voles [36], 100% of early pregnan-
cies in wild horses [32] and 80% of pregnancies in geladas
[29]). In populations in which a Bruce effect is acting, abor-
tion appears to be an obligate response to exposure to a
non-paternal, breeding male.
Unlike the Bruce effect, sexually selected feticide is induced
by male aggression (electronic supplementary material, figure
S2). Females that terminate their pregnancy following trauma
do so as a result of damage that has been inflicted on them
or their fetus [37]. Following the immigration of a feticidal
male, some females experience fetal loss, but many others do
not. Sexually selected feticide is defined as fetal loss that
occurs only when specific females are successfully targeted
by feticidal males, and therefore constitutes a facultative
female response to exposure to a non-parental male.
We tested for the presence of both feticide and infanticide
in the Amboseli population of savannah baboons by com-
paring rates of fetal and infant death immediately before
and after the immigration of adult males who stood to bene-
fit most from feticide or infanticide [38]. We also tested
whether the patterns of feticide and infanticide we detected
support the predictions of the sexual selection hypothesis,
and whether feticide and infanticide are contingent male
behavioural strategies that depend on the reproductive
environment in which he lives.
2. Material and methods
(a) Study area
The Amboseli Baboon Research Project is a long-term longitudi-
nal study of a population of baboons in an East African semi-arid
short-grass savannah with interspersed woodland [39] in and
near Amboseli National Park, Kenya. A detailed description of
the study system can be found elsewhere [38]. Behavioural,
environmental and demographic data have been continuously
collected from the population since 1971. All subjects are recog-
nized visually on sight. A census is conducted every time an
observer is with a group, allowing us to detect, during each
observation day, the presence or absence of all group members,
including which adult males are in the groups being observed
that day.
The near-daily observation of groups allows for the precise
assignment of infant birth and death dates, as well as conception
dates and fetal loss dates. For these latter dates, we rely on a
well-developed method that has been consistently employed
throughout the study period [40]. This method combines men-
struation, sex skin swelling and bleeding data as well as
changes in the colour of the paracallosal skin [41], and allows
for the precise assignment of pregnancy start and end dates for
females in our population. Endocrinological analyses from our
study population, combined with decades of close observation,
confirm that these visual methods are greater than 97% accurate
for identifying the timing of the onset of pregnancy [40]. Male
dominance ranks are assigned monthly for all males in a group
based on wins and losses in dyadic agonistic interactions
between males. Males are taken to be winners of an agonistic
interaction if they give only non-submissive gestures while
their opponent gives only submissive gestures [42].
The number of study groups has fluctuated over the course of
the study as groups have fissioned or occasionally fused, and has
varied from 1 to 6 at any given time. Some groups have been
dropped for logistical reasons and others maintained as study
groups. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, our two original study
groups, Alto’s and Hook’s, initiated a home range shift from an
area of low social group overlap and relatively poor habitat to
an area of higher resource availability and higher social group
overlap [39,43,44]. For Alto’s Group, periods of low resource avail-
ability occurred from 1971 to 1987, and for Hook’s Group, low
resource availability occurred from 1980 to 1991 [43]. During
these time periods, baboon groups were relatively spread out
from each other. As a result, males often spent considerable time
alone between leaving one group and entering a new one,
making immigration relatively more costly [45]. The home range
shifts were associated with changes in social and foraging
behaviours [39] and with an increase in population growth rate.
(b) Detecting feticide and infanticide
Feticide and infanticide can be difficult to directly observe in natu-
ral animal populations, especially if they are relatively uncommon.
Infanticidal attacks are generally quite swift, making it easy for
observers to miss them [11,22]. In the case of feticide, instances
of fetal loss can be difficult to trace to male attacks on pregnant
females in the absence of extremely intensive and detailed behav-
ioural observations. This is true even in species in which pregnancy
and fetal loss can be relatively easily observed such as baboons, in
which females have external indicators of reproductive status and
pregnancy that allow researchers to identify pregnancies with a
high degree of accuracy [40,41].
This study includes no direct observations of feticide or
infanticide or behavioural evidence of male aggression. Instead,
we measured the frequency of feticide and infanticide by com-
paring fetal and infant death rates immediately before and
after male immigrations. Specifically, for a set of immigrations

 of adult males into baboon study groups in Amboseli, we used
Fisher’s exact test to compare the rates of fetal and infant
deaths in the destination groups in the two weeks prior to each
immigration to rates in the two weeks after each immigration.
A systematic increase in fetal and infant death rates in the two
weeks following male immigrations would indicate the presence
of feticide and infanticide. We considered infants to be individ-
uals less than 1-year old. In Amboseli, 60% of females have
resumed sexual cycling by the time their offspring reaches 1
year of age, and 95% have resumed by the time their offspring
reaches 1.4 years of age.
The narrow time window of our analysis (two weeks before and
afterimmigrations),coupledwithalackofseasonalityinimmigrations
in this population, help to rule out the possibility that an increase in
fetal and/or infant death rates could be explained by coincidental
increases in male immigration immediately prior to the systematic
occurrence of fetal and infant deaths from other causes. To further
confirm that any increase in fetal and infant death was linked to
male immigrations, we also compared fetal and infant death rates in
the groups into which males immigrated to rates in groups into
which males did not immigrate over the same time period.
We reasoned that some immigrations were more likely to
result in feticide or infanticide than others. High-ranking male
baboons mate with females more often than low-ranking
males, and rank is determined by fighting ability [46–49]. There-
fore, immigrant males that rapidly attain a high rank in a new
group simultaneously have the most to gain by killing fetuses
and infants and are the most capable of carrying out successful
attacks [21,22,50]. We predicted that the risk of feticide and infan-
ticide would be higher after the immigration of such males. We
also predicted that the males most likely to be feticidal or infan-
ticidal would be those males that remain resident in a group after
immigrating. It is not unusual for males in Amboseli to enter a
group for a few days before leaving, only to return a few days
later. This behaviour, here called ‘shopping’, might be repeated
by a male several times before he becomes consistently resident
in a group; occasionally, males that engage in extensive shopping
never achieve consistent residency in a given group.
We compiled a list of first-time immigrations of males into a
given study group between 1978 and 2015, drawing on our long-
term census records. We divided these immigrations into two
categories according to whether they represented males that we
predicted would be more versus less likely to commit infanticide
or feticide. We defined Category 1 immigrations (N ¼ 75, 71 dis-
tinct males) as those in which an immigrant attained high rank
(an ordinal dominance rank of 1, 2 or 3) within 90 days, did
not shop before attaining high rank and remained in the group
for at least 90 days after attaining high rank. By contrast, we
defined as Category 2 (N ¼ 84, 80 distinct males) immigrations
as those in which males met at least one of the following criteria:
(i) they failed to attain high rank within 90 days but did attain
high rank within 180 days or (ii) they attained high rank
within 90 days but also participated in shopping, and/or left
the group within 90 days after the attainment of high rank. We
excluded from consideration males that never attained high
rank after immigrating. This is a conservative exclusion, because
such males might have committed feticide or infanticide,
although they had less to gain by doing so.
(c) Measuring the benefits and costs of feticide and
infanticide
Males stand to benefit from feticide and infanticide if they mate
with females that would not otherwise be sexually receptive. To
confirm that presumed feticidal and infanticidal males gained
reproductive benefits from their behaviours, we counted the
number of mothers of dead fetuses or infants that mated with pre-
sumed feticidal and infanticidal males after the death of their
infant or fetus. A potential cost of feticide and infanticide is the
concurrent killing of the mother of the dead fetus or infant.
We assessed whether killing females in the process of committing
feticide or infanticide imposes prohibitive costs on males. We
determined the median length of time that a Category 1 male
maintained an ordinal rank of 1, 2 or 3 (how long he retained a
reproductive advantage in the social group) and compared this
tenure to the length of time that he would have to wait for the
median pregnant female (three months pregnant) or median lactat-
ing female (infant age approx. six months) to resume cycling in
the absence of a feticidal or infanticidal attack. The death of any
female that would be expected to resume cycling before the end
of a male’s tenure in the absence of any feticidal or infanticidal
behaviour constitutes the loss of reproductive opportunity.
(d) Testing for environmental contingency
To test whether environmental characteristics influence the likeli-
hood of a male committing feticide and infanticide, we built a
logistic regression model using the R function glm. We used an
increase of two or more infant or fetal deaths following Category
1 immigration, relative to background deaths (measured as the
number of deaths in the two weeks prior to immigrations) as the
response variable. Our model included as predictors the number
of infants and fetuses present in a group at the time of immigration,
and whether an immigration occurred during a period of relatively
low-resource availability. Four ‘Category 1’ immigrations involved
males that also appeared in the dataset at a subsequent point in
their life. In order to avoid pseudoreplication, only males’ first
immigrations (N ¼ 71) were included in the model. This approach
did not affect our results: including these males’ second immigra-
tions as independent immigrations had a negligible impact on
model coefficients and p values.
(e) Data queries
All data were extracted from the long-term database of the Ambo-
seli Baboon Research Project. Specifically, we extracted a list of
immigrations that were then separated into Category 1 and Cat-
egory 2 immigrations. We excluded immigrations that occurred
during fission periods, because these periods have been linked to
elevated infant death rates in other primates [51]. We then counted
the number of infant and fetal deaths that occurred in the two-
week period before and after each immigration event for both
Category 1 and Category 2 immigrations. We also counted the
total number of dependent infants (less than 1 year) and fetuses
(pregnant females) that were present in a group for at least 1 day
during the two weeks before and after immigrations and then cal-
culated the rate at which those fetuses and infants died during the
periods before and after male immigration. We repeated this pro-
cedure for 1- to 2-year-olds, who represent a control group, i.e.
individuals that are vulnerable to aggressive males but having
little-to-no nutritional dependence on the mother. We also queried
the database to count sexual acts between feticidal or infanticidal
males and mothers who had lost an infant or fetus following
those males’ immigrations. We also extracted the male tenure
length at high rank (ordinal dominance ranks 1–3) for each Cat-
egory 1 immigration, and the waiting time to cycling resumption
for females that lost fetuses and infants after male immigrations.
By using a two-week time frame, we sought to prevent the
overlap of multiple immigration time frames. We were able to iso-
late the effect of the immigration of a single Category 1 male in all
cases except for one. Males KIM and SHO were two Category 1
males that immigrated into Alto’s group on 18 February 1984.
Prior to analysis, we decided that because the effects of their immi-
grations could not be isolated, we would treat the immigrations of
KIM and SHO as a single unit. Deaths that occurred before and
after their immigration were counted a single time, and they
represented a single immigration in logistic regression analysis.

 3. Results
(a) Presence of feticide and infanticide
Significantly more fetuses (Fisher’s exact test, p ¼ 0.009), infants
(p ¼ 0.037), and fetuses and infants combined (p ¼ 7 � 1024)
died in the two weeks following Category 1 immigrations
when compared with thetwoweekspriorto these immigrations,
indicating that the period after a Category 1 immigration was a
period of elevated risk for both fetuses and infants. No signifi-
cant difference was found in the death rates of 1- to 2-year-olds
following Category 1 immigrations (p ¼ 0.6). We found no
significant difference in the rates of fetal deaths (p ¼ 0.7),
infant deaths (p ¼ 0.8), combined fetal and infant deaths (p ¼
1), or 1- to 2-year-old deaths (p ¼ 0.7) following Category 2
immigrations when compared with the two weeks before Cat-
egory 2 immigrations. These results are summarized in
figure 1 and table 1.
(b) Cases of multiple deaths following immigrations
Most fetal and infant deaths following Category 1 immigra-
tions were attributable to just seven of 75 Category 1
immigrations (no male was involved in more than one of
these seven immigrations). Multiple fetal and infant deaths
(range ¼ 224 were associated with each of these seven immi-
grations, totalling six infant and 13 fetal deaths. Both fetal
and infant deaths occurred following five of these seven immi-
grations, while only fetal deaths occurred following two of
these seven immigrations. Multiple infant and fetal deaths
did not occur during the two-week period before any of the
75 Category 1 immigrations. The pattern of multiple deaths
occurring within 14 days after, but never before, male immigra-
tion is consistent with two previously published case studies of
apparent feticide in Amboseli [9,10]. In both of these studies,
multiple females experienced fetal losses shortly after being
attacked by particularly aggressive immigrant males. We
obtained a conservative estimate of the frequency of fetal and
infant deaths due to feticide and infanticide in this population
by counting only these cases of multiple deaths in our fre-
quency
estimation.
This
highly
conservative
estimate
indicates that a minimum of 6.2% of fetal deaths (13/210)
and 2.3% of infant deaths (6/258) that have occurred in the
study groups are attributable to sexually selected feticide and
infanticide.
(c) Ruling out environmental influences
In the two weeks following Category 1 immigrations, there
was no significant change in fetal ( p ¼ 0.2), infant ( p ¼ 0.8),
or combined fetal and infant ( p ¼ 0.4) death rates in the
study groups other than the one into which males were immi-
grating as compared to the two weeks before immigration.
During the two weeks following Category 1 immigrations,
rates of fetal ( p ¼ 2 � 1024), infant ( p ¼ 0.005) and combined
fetal and infant ( p ¼ 3 � 1026) death were significantly
higher in the study groups into which males immigrated as
compared to those groups into which males did not immigrate.
During the two weeks prior to Category 1 immigrations, no
significant differences in fetal (p ¼ 0.2), infant ( p ¼ 0.8) or
combined fetal and infant ( p ¼ 0.6) death rates existed between
groups into which Category 1 males would soon immigrate
and other study groups (electronic supplementary material,
table S1).
(d) Testing the predictions of the sexual selection
hypothesis
No extra-group paternity has ever been detected in more than
550 paternity assignments in this population, and none has
ever been reported in other savannah baboon populations.
Thus, a newly immigrated male is not the father of any
infants or fetuses in the groups into which they immigrate.
Fifteen females survived the death of their fetus or infant
and all returned to cycling a median 41 days after fetal or
infant death (interquartile range ¼ 37.5–65 days). Thus,
except in the case of infants whose mothers are nearing the
end of post-partum amenorrhoea (population mean for live
births ¼ 323 days), infanticide would be expected to cause a
female to return to cycling sooner than she otherwise
would. Of the six presumed infanticides associated with
these seven immigrations, none of the six females had
begun cycling before the loss of their infant and four involved
infants that were 31 days old or younger.
Of the surviving 15 females that lost a fetus or infant to pre-
sumed feticide or infanticide, 11 were mate-guarded by the
immigrant male in question following the death of their fetus
or infant. Seven of these mate-guarding episodes were
observed before the female’s next conception and five were
observed within a week of the female’s next conception,
when conception probability is highest [52,53]. If these females
had not lost their fetuses and infants, none would have
been sexually receptive during the time of these conceptive
mate-guarding episodes, so any mating with these females
constitutes an increase in reproductive opportunities when
compared with the reproductive environment that would
have existed in the absence of fetal and infant death. The
study animals are not under constant observation, and these
results represent the most conservative estimate of the frequen-
cies with which mothers that recently lost infants and fetuses
mated with the male that caused their offspring’s death.

 (e) The costs of maternal deaths following male
immigration
In our study, four of 19 mothers died along with their fetus or
infant following the immigration of a presumed feticidal or
infanticidal male, including three mothers on the same day.
Three of these four females that died were lactating and
one was pregnant. These deaths represent 80% (4/5) of all
adult female deaths that occurred following Category 1
immigrations; i.e. aside from these four deaths, female
death following immigrations was very rare.
The median length of time that Category 1 males spent at
ranks 1, 2 or 3 following immigration was 12.5 months (inter-
quartile range ¼ 4.5–24), just longer than the average length
of post-partum amenorrhoea in the population (mean ¼ 323
days). For the median Category 1 male, the killing of a preg-
nant female along with her fetus does not impose a major
immediate
reproductive
cost
(electronic
supplementary
material, figure S2), as most males would not still be high rank-
ing by the time that female would have resumed cycling in the
absence of male interference (approx. 14 months after immigra-
tion for a female that is three months pregnant at the time of
immigration). By contrast, the killing of the mother of a six-
month-old infant constitutes a cost to the median Category 1
male, as that male would likely still be at high rank when
that female would have resumed cycling (approx. six months
after immigration) in the absence of male interference. Still,
so long as maternal death remains an infrequent occurrence,
the occasional loss of potential future reproductive opportu-
nities is not enough to outweigh the benefits gained by
feticidal and infanticidal males that successfully accelerate
females’ return to cycling.
(f) Contingent feticide and infanticide
We found that both feticide and infanticide were more
common when more fetuses and infants were present in a
group (coefficient ¼ 0.54, p ¼ 0.024) and when resource avail-
ability was relatively low (coefficient ¼ 4.19, p ¼ 0.016).
Overall, the logistic regression model accounted for 52% of
the variation in the presence of feticide and infanticide after
the immigration of Category 1 males (electronic supplemen-
tary material, table S2). We also ran the model substituting
the number of adults present in the group at the time of
male immigration in place of the number of fetuses and
infants. Although these two predictors are moderately corre-
lated (r2 ¼ 0.35), the number of adults present in the group
was not a significant predictor of the occurrence of presumed
feticide and infanticide ( p . 0.05).
4. Discussion
(a) Evidence for sexually selected feticide and
infanticide
This study contributes two novel findings to our understanding
of the conflict between pregnant and lactating females, whose
preference is for their offspring to survive, and non-paternal
males, whose preference is for females to be sexually receptive.
First, our data indicate that sexually selected feticide exists in a
wild population under the same conditionsthat favour the evol-
ution of infanticide according to the sexual selection hypothesis.
Specifically, we have shown that presumed feticidal and infan-
ticidal males are unrelated to the individuals that die after their
immigration, that females return to oestrous following pre-
sumed feticide and infanticide sooner than would otherwise
be expected, and that females who have recently lost fetuses
or infants often mate with presumed feticidal or infanticidal
males. Our evidence does not support the hypothesis that
fetal and infant deaths following male immigrations are the
result of generalized male aggression towards all members of
the population: rates of death among 1- to 2-year-old juveniles
did not increase following male immigration. It is possible that
immigrant males behave aggressively towards all females in a
social group, and that this is one of the mechanisms involved
in facilitating feticide and infanticide. We do not have ade-
quately detailed behavioural observations over all decades of
our study to make a strong test of this possibility, but it is not
in accord with observations in chacma baboons, in which
males have been observed to specifically target infants [16].
Second, we have shown that the likelihood of presumed feticide
and/or infanticide occurring depends on characteristics of both
the immigrant male and of his environment. Feticide and infan-
ticide constitute contingent behavioural strategies that are
employed by some males, at some times.
Strong evidence indicates that increases in fetal and infant
death rates were not due to environmental causes. First, the
use of a narrow temporal window for analysis (two weeks
before and two weeks after each immigration) controls for all
but the most acute environmental effects. The absence of sea-
sonality in male immigrations, combined with the presence
of increased fetal and infant death rates following Category 1
but not Category 2 immigrations provides further evidence
that elevated death rates are linked to the immigration of par-
ticular males rather than environmental effects. Finally, if the
environment were responsible for increases in fetal and
infant death rates we would expect to see a parallel increase
in fetal and infant death rates in the study groups into which
males were not immigrating over the same time period.

 No such increase was observed, and fetal and infant death rates
were greater in groups into which males immigrated than those
into which they did not immigrate.
(b) Feticide versus the Bruce effect
The rate of fetal death following Category 1 immigrations (17/
305 pregnancies) is much lower than fetal death rates reported
from studies of the Bruce effect [29,32,36,54], suggesting that
fetal loss in our population is not an obligate response to
male immigration. This finding, combined with previous case
studies that document males physically attacking pregnant
females [9,10], suggests that the increase in fetal death rate
observed following the immigration of Category 1 males is
the result of sexually selected feticide rather than a Bruce effect.
Bruce effects are believed to evolve in populationsas afemale
counterstrategyagainstfutureinfanticide.Ifitishighlylikelythat
afemale’s offspring will bekilled shortlyafter its birth, then natu-
ral selection favours a strategy in which she ceases to invest in a
developing offspring [55]. Findings from this study suggest
that sexually selected feticide might also drive the evolution of
the Bruce effect. In populations where the risk of traumatic feti-
cide is especially high, selection should favour the spontaneous
abortion of pregnancies to prevent such aggression. A Bruce
effect has likely failed to evolve in our population because of
the relatively uncommon and unpredictable nature of feticidal
and infanticidal behaviour. The majority of immigrant males
in the study population are not feticidal or infanticidal, and on
averagethe riskoffetal or infantloss following male immigration
is low. Most of the time, then, Amboseli females can continue
to invest energy in a pregnancy after the immigration of a
new male without risking fetal or infant loss as a result of male
behaviour. Hence, thereis limited selective pressure in this popu-
lation for females to terminate their pregnancies following the
immigration of novel males.
(c) Feticide and infanticide as contingent male
strategies
In several populations, infanticide has been described as a be-
havioural strategy that only some males employ [22–24], and
our model provides some insight into the factors that create
this contingency. Only Category 1 immigrations were associ-
ated with presumed feticide or infanticide, a finding that was
consistent with expectations that high-quality males that
became resident would be responsible for any male-induced
increases in fetal and infant death in the population. Our logistic
regression model demonstrated that presumed feticide and
infanticide were also more likely to occur in groups that had a
relatively large number of fetuses and infants present, which
is consistent with a study in red howlers which found infanti-
cide to be more likely to occur when more females were
present in a group [56].
One third of Category 1 immigrations (6/18) that occurred
during periods of low resource availability [39,43] were associ-
ated with multiple fetal and infant deaths. Two characteristics
of low-resource periods may explain the increase in the fre-
quency of presumed feticide and infanticide. First, during
periods of low resource availability, inter-birth interval lengths
were 15% longer on average [44]. This longer wait for females
to become available following their offspring’s birth would
increase the pressure on males to commit feticide and infanti-
cide. Second, during periods of low resource availability, social
groups’ home ranges overlapped with the home ranges of rela-
tively few other groups. Males typically disperse into social
groups whose range overlaps with their own, and males are
known to preferentially immigrate into groups with a relatively
large number of available females [45,57]. However, this prefer-
ence is more difficult to exercise when a dispersing male has
fewer neighbouring social groups to choose between. In such
circumstances, males are more likely to be forced to disperse
into a group that contains relatively few available females.
These males, in turn, may be more likely to employ feticide
and infanticide in order to generate available females.
(d) Low frequency of infanticide in Amboseli
Although ourestimate of the impact of presumed infanticide on
infant mortality is very conservative, assessing only potential
deaths that occurred within two weeks of male immigrations,
the rate of infanticide in Amboseli (2.3% of infant mortality)
appears to be much lower than that reported in the chacma
baboons of Moremi. This assessment is based not only on the
relatively low frequency of inferred feticide and infanticide
reported here, but on the fact that infanticide by an immigrant
male has only been directly observed twice in our population,
which has been under observation since 1971. By contrast,
infanticide by immigrant males in Moremi has been frequently
documented and accounts for 29.4% [58] to 37% [22] of infant
deaths (see electronic supplementary material, table S3).
This difference might be explained by the relative difference
in benefits realized by males that kill infants in the two popu-
lations. In Moremi, the highest ranking male in a group
reliably accounts for 78% of the total number of mate-guarding
days during conceptive cycles and 45% of mate-guarding days
during non-conceptive cycles [47]. By contrast, high-ranking
males in Amboseli experience very high variance in the per-
centage of mate guarding they monopolize, with top-ranking
males accounting for more than 80% of mate guarding during
some periods, but less than 10% during other periods and only
about 20% on average across the entire study [48]. Thus, being
thehighest rankingmale in a group in Amboseli does not predict
a male’sability to matewith a newlyavailablefemaleas well as it
does in Moremi, reducing the relative benefits of feticide and
infanticide in Amboseli relative to Moremi.
(e) Feticide versus infanticide from the male
perspective
Presumed feticide has a greater impact on fetal death rates in our
study population (accounting for at least 6.2% of all fetal deaths)
than presumed infanticide on infant death rates (accounting for
at least 2.3% of all infant deaths). This difference may reflect the
greater difficultyof attacking and killing an infant than attacking
a pregnant female [32]. Baboons have developed counter-strat-
egies to infanticide, including the establishment of protective
relationships with both paternal and non-paternal males [7]. In
both yellow [59–61] and chacma [22,62–64] baboons, this pro-
tective relationship becomes dramatically stronger after birth,
suggesting that males are more protective of infants than they
are of fetuses. In addition, a male experiences a greater reduction
in waiting time after committing feticide when compared with
infanticide, as he is able to eliminate periods of both pregnancy
and lactation (electronic supplementary material, figure S1), and
this may also contribute to the higher rates of presumed feticide
in Amboseli when compared with presumed infanticide. The

 relative lack of protection afforded to fetuses, in combination
with the relatively large potential benefits of inducing abortion
as compared to killing infants, could make pregnant females
the most attractive targets for immigrant males.
5. Conclusion
Many authors have argued that sexually selected infanticide
results in selective pressures that have played an important
role in the evolution of various social characteristics in primates
(but see [65]), including male–female friendship [2], female
coalitions [3], monogamy ([4,5], but see [66]) and social organ-
ization [6]. Yet sexually selected feticide, which should evolve
under similar conditions as infanticide, receives relatively little
attention in empirical studies or in discussions of the role of
sexual conflict in social evolution. We argue that sexually
selected feticide may have as strong an influence on the evol-
ution of mammalian societies as does sexually selected
infanticide. Given the relative difficulty of detecting fetal loss
when compared with infant death, sexually selected feticide
may occur, but remain undocumented, in many of the same
populations in which infanticide has been observed. In these
populations, sexually selected feticide can be seen as strength-
ening the selective pressures that result from sexually selected
infanticide. It has been argued that feticide also occurs in popu-
lations where males are unable to kill infants, but are able to
bring about fetal loss through male–female aggression [32].
In such populations, feticide in the absence of infanticide
would represent a potentially important selective force that
has not been previously considered.
