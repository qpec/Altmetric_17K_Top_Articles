abstract
This is the fi
 rst clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of 
Pediatrics that specifi
 cally applies to patients who have experienced an 
apparent life-threatening event (ALTE). This clinical practice guideline has 
3 objectives. First, it recommends the replacement of the term ALTE with a 
new term, brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). Second, it provides an 
approach to patient evaluation that is based on the risk that the infant will 
have a repeat event or has a serious underlying disorder. Finally, it provides 
management recommendations, or key action statements, for lower-risk 
infants. The term BRUE is defi
 ned as an event occurring in an infant younger 
than 1 year when the observer reports a sudden, brief, and now resolved 
episode of ≥1 of the following: (1) cyanosis or pallor; (2) absent, decreased, 
or irregular breathing; (3) marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia); and 
(4) altered level of responsiveness. A BRUE is diagnosed only when there is 
no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history 
and physical examination. By using this defi
 nition and framework, infants 
younger than 1 year who present with a BRUE are categorized either as (1) 
a lower-risk patient on the basis of history and physical examination for 
whom evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and management 
are offered or (2) a higher-risk patient whose history and physical 
examination suggest the need for further investigation and treatment but 
for whom recommendations are not offered. This clinical practice guideline 
is intended to foster a patient- and family-centered approach to care, reduce 
unnecessary and costly medical interventions, improve patient outcomes, 
support implementation, and provide direction for future research. Each key 
action statement indicates a level of evidence, the benefi
 t-harm relationship, 
and the strength of recommendation.

INTRODUCTION
This clinical practice guideline 
applies to infants younger than 1 
year and is intended for pediatric 
clinicians. This guideline has 
3 primary objectives. First, it 
recommends the replacement of 
the term apparent life-threatening 
event (ALTE) with a new term, 
brief resolved unexplained event 
(BRUE). Second, it provides an 
approach to patient evaluation that 
is based on the risk that the infant 
will have a recurring event or has 
a serious underlying disorder. 
Third, it provides evidence-based 
management recommendations, or 
key action statements, for lower-risk 
patients whose history and physical 
examination are normal. It does not 
offer recommendations for higher-
risk patients whose history and 
physical examination suggest the 
need for further investigation and 
treatment (because of insufficient 
evidence or the availability of 
clinical practice guidelines specific 
to their presentation). This clinical 
practice guideline also provides 
implementation support and suggests 
directions for future research.
The term ALTE originated from a 
1986 National Institutes of Health 
Consensus Conference on Infantile 
Apnea and was intended to replace 
the term “near-miss sudden infant 
death syndrome” (SIDS).1 An 
ALTE was defined as “an episode 
that is frightening to the observer 
and that is characterized by some 
combination of apnea (central or 
occasionally obstructive), color 
change (usually cyanotic or pallid 
but occasionally erythematous or 
plethoric), marked change in muscle 
tone (usually marked limpness), 
choking, or gagging. In some cases, 
the observer fears that the infant 
has died.”2 Although the definition 
of ALTE eventually enabled 
researchers to establish that these 
events are separate entities from 
SIDS, the clinical application of this 
classification, which describes a 
constellation of observed, subjective, 
and nonspecific symptoms, has raised 
significant challenges for clinicians 
and parents in the evaluation and 
care of these infants.3 Although 
a broad range of disorders can 
present as an ALTE (eg, child abuse, 
congenital abnormalities, epilepsy, 
inborn errors of metabolism, and 
infections), for a majority of infants 
who appear well after the event, the 
risk of a serious underlying disorder 
or a recurrent event is extremely 
low.2
CHANGE IN TERMINOLOGY AND 
DIAGNOSIS
The imprecise nature of the original 
ALTE definition is difficult to apply 
to clinical care and research.3 
As a result, the clinician is often 
faced with several dilemmas. First, 
under the ALTE definition, the 
infant is often, but not necessarily, 
asymptomatic on presentation. 
The evaluation and management 
of symptomatic infants (eg, those 
with fever or respiratory distress) 
need to be distinguished from that 
of asymptomatic infants. Second, the 
reported symptoms under the ALTE 
definition, although often concerning 
to the caregiver, are not intrinsically 
life-threatening and frequently are 
a benign manifestation of normal 
infant physiology or a self-limited 
condition. A definition needs enough 
precision to allow the clinician to 
base clinical decisions on events that 
are characterized as abnormal after 
conducting a thorough history and 
physical examination. For example, a 
constellation of symptoms suggesting 
hemodynamic instability or central 
apnea needs to be distinguished from 
more common and less concerning 
events readily characterized as 
periodic breathing of the newborn, 
breath-holding spells, dysphagia, 
or gastroesophageal reflux (GER). 
Furthermore, events defined as 
ALTEs are rarely a manifestation 
of a more serious illness that, if left 
undiagnosed, could lead to morbidity 
or death. Yet, the perceived 
potential for recurring events or a 
serious underlying disorder often 
provokes concern in caregivers 
and clinicians.2, 
4, 
5 This concern can 
compel testing or admission to the 
hospital for observation, which 
can increase parental anxiety and 
subject the patient to further risk 
and does not necessarily lead to a 
treatable diagnosis or prevention 
of future events. A more precise 
definition could prevent the overuse 
of medical interventions by helping 
clinicians distinguish infants with 
lower risk. Finally, the use of ALTE 
as a diagnosis may reinforce the 
caregivers’ perceptions that the 
event was indeed “life-threatening, 
” 
even when it most often was not. 
For these reasons, a replacement of 
the term ALTE with a more specific 
term could improve clinical care and 
management.
In this clinical practice guideline, a 
more precise definition is introduced 
for this group of clinical events: brief 
resolved unexplained event (BRUE). 
The term BRUE is intended to better 
reflect the transient nature and lack 
of clear cause and removes the “life-
threatening” label. The authors of 
this guideline recommend that the 
term ALTE no longer be used by 
clinicians to describe an event or as 
a diagnosis. Rather, the term BRUE 
should be used to describe events 
occurring in infants younger than 
1 year of age that are characterized 
by the observer as “brief” (lasting 
<1 minute but typically <20–30 
seconds) and “resolved” (meaning 
the patient returned to baseline 
state of health after the event) and 
with a reassuring history, physical 
examination, and vital signs at the 
time of clinical evaluation by trained 
medical providers (Table 1). For 
example, the presence of respiratory 
symptoms or fever would preclude 
classification of an event as a BRUE. 
BRUEs are also “unexplained, 
” 
meaning that a clinician is unable to 
explain the cause of the event after

an appropriate history and physical 
examination. Similarly, an event 
characterized as choking or gagging 
associated with spitting up is not 
included in the BRUE definition, 
because clinicians will want to pursue 
the cause of vomiting, which may be 
related to GER, infection, or central 
nervous system (CNS) disease. 
However, until BRUE-specific codes 
are available, for billing and coding 
purposes, it is reasonable to apply 
the ALTE International Classification 
of Diseases, 9th Revision, and 
International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th revision, codes 
to patients determined to have 
experienced a BRUE (see section 
entitled “Dissemination and 
Implementation”).
BRUE DEFINITION
Clinicians should use the term 
BRUE to describe an event 
occurring in an infant <1 year of 
age when the observer reports a 
sudden, brief, and now resolved 
episode of ≥1 of the following:
 
• cyanosis or pallor
 
• absent, decreased, or irregular 
breathing
 
• marked change in tone (hyper- 
or hypotonia)
 
• altered level of responsiveness
Moreover, clinicians should 
diagnose a BRUE only when there 
is no explanation for a qualifying 
event after conducting an 
appropriate history and physical 
examination (Tables 2 and 3).
Differences between the terms ALTE 
and BRUE should be noted. First, the 
BRUE definition has a strict age limit. 
Second, an event is only a BRUE if 
there is no other likely explanation. 
Clinical symptoms such as fever, 
nasal congestion, and increased work 
of breathing may indicate temporary 
airway obstruction from viral 
infection. Events characterized as 
choking after vomiting may indicate 
a gastrointestinal cause, such as GER. 
Third, a BRUE diagnosis is based on 
the clinician’s characterization of 
features of the event and not on a 
caregiver’s perception that the event 
was life-threatening. Although such 
perceptions are understandable and 
important to address, such risk can 
only be assessed after the event has 
been objectively characterized by a 
clinician. Fourth, the clinician should 
determine whether the infant had 
episodic cyanosis or pallor, rather 
than just determining whether “color 
change” occurred. Episodes of rubor 
or redness are not consistent with 
BRUE, because they are common 
in healthy infants. Fifth, BRUE 
expands the respiratory criteria 
beyond “apnea” to include absent 
breathing, diminished breathing, and 
other breathing irregularities. Sixth, 
instead of the less specific criterion of 
“change in muscle tone, 
” the clinician 
should determine whether there was 
marked change in tone, including

hypertonia or hypotonia. Seventh, 
because choking and gagging usually 
indicate common diagnoses such as 
GER or respiratory infection, their 
presence suggests an event was 
not a BRUE. Finally, the use of 
“altered level of responsiveness” is a 
new criterion, because it can 
be an important component of 
an episodic but serious cardiac, 
respiratory, metabolic, or neurologic 
event.
For infants who have experienced a 
BRUE, a careful history and physical 
examination are necessary to 
characterize the event, assess the 
risk of recurrence, and determine 
the presence of an underlying 
disorder (Tables 2 and 3). The 
recommendations provided in this 
guideline focus on infants with a 
lower risk of a subsequent event or 
serious underlying disorder (see 
section entitled “Risk Assessment: 
Lower- Versus Higher-Risk BRUE”). 
In the absence of identifiable risk 
factors, infants are at lower risk and 
laboratory studies, imaging studies, 
and other diagnostic procedures are 
unlikely to be useful or necessary. 
However, if the clinical history 
or physical examination reveals 
abnormalities, the patient may 
be at higher risk and further 
evaluation should focus on the 
specific areas of concern. For 
example, 
 
• possible child abuse may be 
considered when the event 
history is reported inconsistently 
or is incompatible with the 
child’s developmental age, or 
when, on physical examination, 
there is unexplained bruising 
or a torn labial or lingual 
frenulum;
 
• a cardiac arrhythmia may be 
considered if there is a family 
history of sudden, unexplained 
death in first-degree relatives; and
 
• infection may be considered 
if there is fever or persistent 
respiratory symptoms.

The key action statements in this 
clinical practice guideline do not 
apply to higher-risk patients but 
rather apply only to infants who meet 
the lower-risk criteria by having 
an otherwise normal history and 
physical examination.
RISK ASSESSMENT: LOWER- VERSUS 
HIGHER-RISK BRUE
Patients who have experienced a 
BRUE may have a recurrent event 
or an undiagnosed serious condition 
(eg, child abuse, pertussis, etc) that 
confers a risk of adverse outcomes. 
Although this risk has been difficult 
to quantify historically and no studies 
have fully evaluated patient-centered 
outcomes (eg, family experience 
survey), the systematic review of 
the ALTE literature identified a 
subset of BRUE patients who are 
unlikely to have a recurrent event or 
undiagnosed serious conditions, are 
at lower risk of adverse outcomes, 
and can likely be managed safely 
without extensive diagnostic 
evaluation or hospitalization.3 In 
the systematic review of ALTE 
studies in which it was possible to 
identify BRUE patients, the following 
characteristics most consistently 
conferred higher risk: infants <2 
months of age, those with a history 
of prematurity, and those with more 
than 1 event. There was generally an 
increased risk from prematurity in 
infants born at <32 weeks’ gestation, 
and the risk attenuated once infants 
born at <32 weeks’ gestation reached 
45 weeks’ postconceptional age. Two 
ALTE studies evaluated the duration 
of the event.6, 
7 Although duration 
did not appear to be predictive of 
hospital admission, it was difficult to 
discern a BRUE population from the 
heterogeneous ALTE populations. 
Nonetheless, most events were less 
than one minute. By consensus, the 
subcommittee established <1 minute 
as the upper limit of a "brief event, 
" 
understanding that objective, 
verifiable measurements were rarely, 
if ever, available. Cariopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR) was identified as 
a risk factor in the older ALTE studies 
and confirmed in a recent study, 
6 
but it was unclear how the need for 
CPR was determined. Therefore, 
the committee agreed by consensus 
that the need for CPR should be 
determined by trained medical 
providers. 
PATIENT FACTORS THAT DETERMINE A 
LOWER RISK
To be designated lower risk, the 
following criteria should be met (see 
Fig 1):
 
• Age >60 days
 
• Prematurity: gestational age ≥32 
weeks and postconceptional age 
≥45 weeks
 
• First BRUE (no previous BRUE ever 
and not occurring in clusters)
 
• Duration of event <1 minute
 
• No CPR required by trained 
medical provider
 
• No concerning historical features 
(see Table 2)
 
• No concerning physical 
examination findings (see Table 3)
Infants who have experienced a 
BRUE who do not qualify as lower-
risk patients are, by definition, 
at higher risk. Unfortunately, the 
outcomes data from ALTE studies 
in the heterogeneous higher-risk 
population are unclear and preclude 
the derivation of evidence-based 
recommendations regarding 
management. Thus, pending further 
research, this guideline does not 
provide recommendations for the 
management of the higher-risk 
infant. Nonetheless, it is important 
for clinicians and researchers to 
recognize that some studies suggest 
that higher-risk BRUE patients may 
be more likely to have a serious 
underlying cause, recurrent event, 
or an adverse outcome. For example, 
infants younger than 2 months 
who experience a BRUE may be 
more likely to have a congenital or 
infectious cause and be at higher risk 
of an adverse outcome. Infants who 
have experienced multiple events or 
a concerning social assessment for 
child abuse may warrant increased 
observation to better document the 
events or contextual factors. A list 
of differential diagnoses for BRUE 
patients is provided in Supplemental 
Table 6.

and experts in the fields of general 
pediatrics, hospital medicine, 
emergency medicine, infectious 
diseases, child abuse, sleep medicine, 
pulmonary medicine, cardiology, 
neurology, biochemical genetics, 
gastroenterology, environmental 
health, and quality improvement. 
The subcommittee also included a 
parent representative, a guideline 
methodologist/informatician, and an 
epidemiologist skilled in systematic 
reviews. All panel members declared 
potential conflicts on the basis of the 
AAP policy on Conflict of Interest and 
Voluntary Disclosure. Subcommittee 
members repeated this process 
annually and upon publication of the 
guideline. All potential conflicts of 
interest are listed at the end of this 
document. The project was funded by 
the AAP.
The subcommittee performed 
a comprehensive review of the 
literature related to ALTEs from 
1970 through 2014. Articles 
from 1970 through 2011 were 
identified and evaluated by using 
“Management of Apparent Life 
Threatening Events in Infants: A 
Systematic Review, 
” authored by 
the Society of Hospital Medicine’s 
ALTE Expert Panel (which included 
4 members of the subcommittee).3 
The subcommittee partnered with 
the Society of Hospital Medicine 
Expert Panel and a librarian to 
update the original systematic 
review with articles published 
through December 31, 2014, with 
the use of the same methodology 
as the original systematic review. 
PubMed, Cumulative Index to 
Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 
and Cochrane Library databases 
were searched for studies involving 
children younger than 24 months 
by using the stepwise approach 
specified in the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.8 
Search terms included “ALTE(s), 
” 
“apparent life threatening event(s), 
” 
“life threatening event(s), 
” “near 
miss SIDS” or “near miss sudden 
infant death syndrome, 
” “aborted 
crib death” or “aborted sudden infant 
death syndrome, 
” and “aborted SIDS” 
or “aborted cot death” or “infant 
death, sudden.” The Medical Subject 
Heading “infantile apparent life-
threatening event, 
” introduced in 
2011, was also searched but did not 
identify additional articles.
In updating the systematic 
review published in 2012, pairs 
of 2 subcommittee members 
used validated methodology to 
independently score the newly 
identified abstracts from English-
language articles (n = 120) for 
relevance to the clinical questions 
(Supplemental Fig 3).9, 
10 Two 
independent reviewers then critically 
appraised the full text of the 
identified articles (n = 23) using 
a structured data collection form 
based on published guidelines for 
evaluating medical literature.11,

1 reviewer judged an article to be 
relevant on the basis of the full text, 
subsequently at least 2 reviewers 
critically appraised the article and

quality. The final recommendations 
were based on articles identified 
in the updated (n = 18) and 
original (n = 37) systematic review 
(Supplemental Table 7).6, 
7, 
13–28 
The resulting systematic review 
was used to develop the guideline 
recommendations by following 
the policy statement from the AAP 
Steering Committee on Quality 
Improvement and Management, 
“Classifying Recommendations 
for Clinical Practice Guidelines.”29 
Decisions and the strength of 
recommendations were based on 
a systematic grading of the quality 
of evidence from the updated 
literature review by 2 independent 
reviewers and incorporation of 
the previous systematic review. 
Expert consensus was used when 
definitive data were not available. 
If committee members disagreed 
with the rest of the consensus, they 
were encouraged to voice their 
concern until full agreement was 
reached. If full agreement could not 
be reached, each committee member 
reserved the right to state concern 
or disagreement in the publication 
(which did not occur). Because the 
recommendations of this guideline 
were based on the ALTE literature, 
we relied on the studies and 
outcomes that could be attributable 
to the new definition of lower- or 
higher-risk BRUE patients.
Key action statements (summarized 
in Table 5) were generated by 
using BRIDGE-Wiz (Building 
Recommendations in a Developers 
Guideline Editor), an interactive 
software tool that leads guideline 
development teams through a series 
of questions that are intended 
to create clear, transparent, and 
actionable key action statements.30 
BRIDGE-Wiz integrates the quality 
of available evidence and a benefit-
harm assessment into the final 
determination of the strength of each 
recommendation. Evidence-based 
guideline recommendations from 
the AAP may be graded as strong,

Implication
Strong recommendation
A particular action is favored because anticipated benefi

clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and quality of 
evidence is excellent or unobtainable.
Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation 
unless a clear and compelling rationale for an 
alternative approach is present.
Moderate recommendation
A particular action is favored because anticipated benefi
 ts 
clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of 
evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable).
Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate 
recommendation but should remain alert to new 
information and sensitive to patient preferences.
Weak recommendation (based on low-
quality evidence)
A particular action is favored because anticipated benefi

clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of 
evidence is weak.
Clinicians would be prudent follow a weak 
recommendation but should remain alert to new 
information and very sensitive to patient preferences.
Weak recommendation (based on 
balance of benefi

Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate 
database shows evidence of both benefi
 t and harm that 
appear to be similar in magnitude for any available 
courses of action.
Clinicians should consider the options in their 
decision-making, but patient preference may have a 
substantial role.

moderate, weak based on low-quality 
evidence, or weak based on balance 
between benefits and harms. Strong 
and moderate recommendations are 
associated with “should” and “should 
not” recommendation statements, 
whereas weak recommendation may 
be recognized by use of “may” or 
“need not” (Fig 2, Table 4).
A strong recommendation means 
that the committee’s review of the 
evidence indicates that the benefits 
of the recommended approach 
clearly exceed the harms of that 
approach (or, in the case of a strong 
negative recommendation, that the 
harms clearly exceed the benefits) 
and that the quality of the evidence 
supporting this approach is excellent. 
Clinicians are advised to follow 
such guidance unless a clear and 
compelling rationale for acting in 
a contrary manner is present. A 
moderate recommendation means 
that the committee believes that the 
benefits exceed the harms (or, in the 
case of a negative recommendation, 
that the harms exceed the benefits), 
but the quality of the evidence on 
which this recommendation is based 
is not as strong. Clinicians are also 
encouraged to follow such guidance 
but also should be alert to new 
information and sensitive to patient 
preferences.
A weak recommendation means 
either that the evidence quality 
that exists is suspect or that well-
designed, well-conducted studies 
have shown little clear advantage to 
one approach versus another. Weak 
recommendations offer clinicians 
flexibility in their decision-making 
regarding appropriate practice, 
although they may set boundaries 
on alternatives. Family and 
patient preference should have a 
substantial role in influencing clinical

decision-making, particularly when 
recommendations are expressed 
as weak. Key action statements 
based on that evidence and expert 
consensus are provided. A summary 
is provided in Table 5.
The practice guideline underwent 
a comprehensive review by 
stakeholders before formal 
approval by the AAP, including AAP 
councils, committees, and sections; 
selected outside organizations; 
and individuals identified by the 
subcommittee as experts in the field. 
All comments were reviewed by the 
subcommittee and incorporated into 
the final guideline when appropriate.
This guideline is intended for use 
primarily by clinicians providing 
care for infants who have 
experienced a BRUE and their 
families. This guideline may be of 
interest to parents and payers, but 
it is not intended to be used for 
reimbursement or to determine 
insurance coverage. This guideline 
is not intended as the sole source 
of guidance in the evaluation and 
management of BRUEs but rather 
is intended to assist clinicians by 
providing a framework for clinical 
decision-making. 
KEY ACTION STATEMENTS FOR LOWER-
RISK BRUE
1. Cardiopulmonary
1A. Clinicians Need Not Admit 
Infants Presenting With a Lower-
Risk BRUE to the Hospital Solely for 
Cardiorespiratory Monitoring (Grade B, 
Weak Recommendation)
Infants presenting with an 
ALTE often have been admitted 
for observation and testing. 
Observational data indicate that 12% 
to 14% of infants presenting with a 
diagnosis of ALTE had a subsequent 
event or condition that required 
hospitalization.7, 
31 Thus, research 
has sought to identify risk factors 
that could be used to identify infants 
likely to benefit from hospitalization. 
A long-term follow-up study in 
infants hospitalized with an ALTE 
showed that no infants subsequently 
had SIDS but 11% were victims of 
child abuse and 4.9% had adverse 
neurologic outcomes (see 3. 
Neurology).32 The ALTE literature 
supports that infants presenting with 
a lower-risk BRUE do not have an 
increased rate of cardiovascular or 
other events during admission and 
hospitalization may not be required, 
but close follow-up is recommended. 
Careful outpatient follow-up is 
advised (repeat clinical history and 
physical examination within 24 
hours after the initial evaluation) to 
identify infants with ongoing medical 
concerns that would indicate further 
evaluation and treatment.
Al-Kindy et al33 used documented 
monitoring in 54% of infants 
admitted for an ALTE (338 of 625) 
and identified 46 of 338 (13.6%) 
with “extreme” cardiovascular events 
(central apnea >30 seconds, oxygen 
saturation <80% for 10 seconds, 
decrease in heart rate <50–60/
minutes for 10 seconds on the basis

of postconceptional age). However, 
no adverse outcomes were noted 
for any of their cohort (although 
whether there is a protective effect 
of observation alone is not known). 
Some of the infants with extreme 
events developed symptoms of 
upper respiratory infection 1 to 2 
days after the ALTE presentation. 
The risk factors for “extreme” events 
were prematurity, postconceptional 
age <43 weeks, and (presence 
of) upper respiratory infection 
symptoms. Importantly, infants with 
a postconceptional age >48 weeks 
were not documented as having 
an extreme event in this cohort. A 
previous longitudinal study also 
identified “extreme” events that 
occurred with comparable frequency 
in otherwise normal term infants and 
that were not statistically increased 
in term infants with a history of 
ALTE.34
Preterm infants have been shown 
to have more serious events, 
although an ALTE does not further 
increase that risk compared with 
asymptomatic preterm infants 
without ALTE.34 Claudius and 
Keens31 performed an observational 
prospective study in 59 infants 
presenting with ALTE who had been 
born at >30 weeks’ gestation and 
had no significant medical illness. 
They evaluated factors in the clinical 
history and physical examination 
that, according to the authors, would 
warrant hospital admission on the 
basis of adverse outcomes (including 
recurrent cardiorespiratory events, 
infection, child abuse, or any life-
threatening condition). Among these 
otherwise well infants, those with 
multiple ALTEs or age <1 month 
experienced adverse outcomes 
necessitating hospitalization. 
Prematurity was also a risk factor 
predictive of subsequent adverse 
events after an ALTE. Paroxysmal 
decreases in oxygen saturation in 
infants immediately before and 
during viral illnesses have been 
well documented.33, 
35 However, the 
significance of these brief hypoxemic 
events has not been established.
1B. Clinicians May Briefl
 y Monitor 
Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk 
BRUE With Continuous Pulse Oximetry 
and Serial Observations (Grade D, Weak 
Recommendation)
A normal physical examination, 
including vital signs and oximetry, 
is needed for a patient who has 
experienced a BRUE to be considered 
lower-risk. An evaluation at a single 
point in time may not be as accurate 
as a longer interval of observation. 
Unfortunately, there are few data 
to suggest the optimal duration 
of this period, the value of repeat 
examinations, and the effect of 
false-positive evaluations on family-
centered care. Several studies have 
documented intermittent episodes of 
hypoxemia after admission for 
ALTE.7, 
31, 
33 Pulse oximetry 
identified more infants with 
concerning paroxysmal events 
than cardiorespiratory monitoring 
alone.33 However, occasional oxygen 
desaturations are commonly observed 
in normal infants, especially during 
sleep.36 Furthermore, normative 
oximetry data are dependent on the 
specific machine, averaging interval, 
altitude, behavioral state, and 
postconceptional age. Similarly, there 
may be considerable variability in the 
vital signs and the clinical appearance 
of an infant. Pending further research 
into this important issue, clinicians 
may choose to monitor and provide 
serial examinations of infants in the 
lower-risk group for a brief period 
of time, ranging from 1 to 4 hours, to 
establish that the vital signs, physical 
examination, and symptomatology 
remain stable.
1C. Clinicians Should Not Obtain a Chest 
Radiograph in Infants Presenting With 
a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade B, Moderate 
Recommendation)
Infectious processes can precipitate 
apnea. In 1 ALTE study, more than 
80% of these infections involved the 
respiratory tract.37 Most, but not 
all, infants with significant lower 
respiratory tract infections will be 
symptomatic at the time of ALTE 
presentation. However, 2 studies 
have documented pneumonia in 
infants presenting with ALTE and an 
otherwise noncontributory history 
and physical examination.4, 
37 These 
rare exceptions have generally been 
in infants younger than 2 months 
and would have placed them in the 
higher-risk category for a BRUE in 
this guideline. Similarly, Davies and 
Gupta38 reported that 9 of 65 patients 
(ages unknown) who had ALTEs had 
abnormalities on chest radiography 
(not fully specified) despite no 
suspected respiratory disorder 
on clinical history or physical 
examination. Some of the radiographs 
were performed up to 24 hours 
after presentation. Davies and Gupta 
further reported that 33% of infants 
with ALTEs that were ultimately 
associated with a respiratory disease 
had a normal initial respiratory 
examination.38 Kant et al18 reported 
that 2 of 176 infants discharged 
after admission for ALTE died within 
2 weeks, both of pneumonia. One 
infant had a normal chest radiograph 
initially; the other, with a history 
of prematurity, had a “possible” 
infiltrate. Thus, most experience 
has shown that a chest radiograph 
in otherwise well-appearing infants 
rarely alters clinical management.7 
Careful follow-up within 24 hours 
is important in infants with a 
nonfocal clinical history and physical 
examination to identify those 
who will ultimately have a lower 
respiratory tract infection diagnosed.
1D. Clinicians Should Not Obtain 
Measurement of Venous or Arterial 
Blood Gases in Infants Presenting With 
a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade B, Moderate 
Recommendation)
Blood gas measurements have 
not been shown to add significant 
clinical information in otherwise 
well-appearing infants presenting 
with an ALTE.4 Although not part of 
e11

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
this guideline, future research may 
demonstrate that blood gases are 
helpful in select infants with a higher 
risk BRUE to support the diagnosis 
of pulmonary disease, control-of-
breathing disorders, or inborn errors 
of metabolism (IEMs).
1E. Clinicians Should Not Obtain an 
Overnight Polysomnograph in Infants 
Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE 
(Grade B, Moderate Recommendation)
Polysomnography consists of 8 to 
12 hours of documented monitoring, 
including EEG, electro-oculography, 
electromyography, nasal/oral 
airflow, electrocardiography, 
end-tidal carbon dioxide, chest/
abdominal excursion, and oximetry. 
Polysomnography is considered by 
many to be the gold standard for 
identifying obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA), central sleep apnea, and 
periodic breathing and may identify 
seizures. Some data have suggested 
using polysomnography in infants 
presenting with ALTEs as a means 
to predict the likelihood of recurrent 
significant cardiorespiratory events. 
A study in which polysomnography 
was performed in a cohort of 
infants with ALTEs (including 
recurrent episodes) reported that 
polysomnography may reveal 
respiratory pauses of >20 seconds 
or brief episodes of bradycardia that 
are predictive of ensuing events over 
the next several months.40 However, 
without a control population, the 
clinical significance of these events 
is uncertain, because respiratory 
pauses are frequently observed in 
otherwise normal infants.35 Similarly, 
Kahn and Blum41 reported that 10 
of 71 infants with a clinical history 
of “benign” ALTEs had an abnormal 
polysomnograph, including periodic 
breathing (7 of 10) or obstructive 
apnea (4 of 100), but specific data 
were not presented. These events 
were not found in a control group 
of 181 infants. The severity of the 
periodic breathing (frequency 
of arousals and extent of oxygen 
desaturation) could not be evaluated 
from these data. Daniëls et al42 
performed polysomnography in 
422 infants with ALTEs and 
identified 11 infants with significant 
bradycardia, OSA, and/or oxygen 
desaturation. Home monitoring 
revealed episodes of bradycardia 
(<50 per minute) in 7 of 11 infants 
and concluded that polysomnography 
is a useful modality. However, 
the clinical history, physical 
examination, and laboratory findings 
were not presented. GER has also 
been associated with specific 
episodes of severe bradycardia in 
monitored infants.43 Overall, most 
polysomnography studies have 
shown minimal or nonspecific 
findings in infants presenting with 
ALTEs.44, 
45 Polysomnography 
studies generally have not been 
predictive of ALTE recurrence 
and do not identify those infants 
at risk of SIDS.46 Thus, the routine 
use of polysomnography in infants 
presenting with a lower-risk BRUE is 
likely to have a low diagnostic yield 
and is unlikely to lead to changes in 
therapy.
OSA has been occasionally associated 
with ALTEs in many series, but 
not all.39, 
47–49 The use of overnight 
polysomnography to evaluate 
for OSA should be guided by an 
assessment of risk on the basis of a

comprehensive clinical history and 
physical examination.50 Symptoms of 
OSA, which may be subtle or absent 
in infants, include snoring, noisy 
respirations, labored breathing, 
mouth breathing, and profuse 
sweating.51 Occasionally, infants 
with OSA will present with failure 
to thrive, witnessed apnea, and/
or developmental delay.52 Snoring 
may be absent in younger infants 
with OSA, including those with 
micrognathia. In addition, snoring in 
otherwise normal infants is present 
at least 2 days per week in 11.8% 
and at least 3 days per week in 5.3% 
of infants.53 Some infants with OSA 
may be asymptomatic and have 
a normal physical examination.54 
However, some studies have 
reported a high incidence of snoring 
in infants with (26%–44%) and 
without (22%–26%) OSA, making 
the distinction difficult.55 Additional 
risk factors for infant OSA include 
prematurity, maternal smoking, 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, 
obesity, and specific medical 
conditions including laryngomalacia, 
craniofacial abnormalities, 
neuromuscular weakness, Down 
syndrome, achondroplasia, Chiari 
malformations, and Prader-Willi 
syndrome.34, 
56–58
1F. Clinicians May Obtain a 12-Lead 
Electrocardiogram for Infants 
Presenting With Lower-Risk BRUE 
(Grade C, Weak Recommendation)
ALTE studies have examined 
screening electrocardiograms 
(ECGs). A study by Brand et al4 found 
no positive findings on 24 ECGs 
performed on 72 patients (33%) 
without a contributory history or 
physical examination. Hoki et al16 
reported a 4% incidence of cardiac 
disease found in 485 ALTE patients; 
ECGs were performed in 208 of 480 
patients (43%) with 3 of 5 abnormal 
heart rhythms identified by the 
ECG and the remaining 2 showing 
structural heart disease. Both studies 
had low positive-predictive values 
of ECGs (0% and 1%, respectively). 
Hoki et al had a negative predictive 
value of 100% (96%–100%), and 
given the low prevalence of disease, 
there is little need for further testing 
in patients with a negative ECG.
Some cardiac conditions that 
may present as a BRUE include 
channelopathies (long QT syndrome, 
short QT syndrome, Brugada 
syndrome, and catecholaminergic 
polymorphic ventricular 
tachycardia), ventricular pre-
excitation (Wolff-Parkinson-White 
syndrome), and cardiomyopathy/
myocarditis (hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, dilated 
cardiomyopathy). Resting ECGs are 
ineffective in identifying patients 
with catecholaminergic polymorphic 
ventricular tachycardia. Family 
history is important in identifying 
individuals with channelopathies.
Severe potential outcomes of any of 
these conditions, if left undiagnosed 
or untreated, include sudden death 
or neurologic injury.59 However, 
many patients do not ever experience 
symptoms in their lifetime and 
adverse outcomes are uncommon.

who died of SIDS in Norway showed 
an association between 9.5% and

or novel gene findings at the long 
QT loci.60 A syncopal episode, 
which could present as a BRUE, is 
strongly associated with subsequent 
sudden cardiac arrest in patients 
with long QT syndrome.61 The 
incidence and risk in those with 
other channelopathies have not been 
adequately studied. The incidence 
of sudden cardiac arrest in patients 
with ventricular pre-excitation 
(Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) 
is 3% to 4% over the lifetime of the 
individual.62
1G. Clinicians Should Not Obtain an 
Echocardiogram in Infants Presenting 
With Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, 
Moderate Recommendation)
Cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic 
and dilated cardiomyopathy) and 
myocarditis could rarely present 
as a lower-risk BRUE and can be 
identified with echocardiography. 
The cost of an echocardiogram is high 
and accompanied by sedation risks.
In a study in ALTE patients, 
Hoki et al16 did not recommend 
echocardiography as an initial 
cardiac test unless there are 
findings on examination or from 
an echocardiogram consistent 
with heart disease. The majority of 
abnormal echocardiogram findings 
in their study were not perceived 
to be life-threatening or related 
to a cause for the ALTE (eg, septal 
defects or mild valve abnormalities), 
and they would have been detected 
on echocardiogram or physical 
examination. Brand et al4 reported 
32 echocardiograms in 243 ALTE 
patients and found only 1 abnormal 
echocardiogram, which was 
suspected because of an abnormal 
history and physical examination 
(double aortic arch).
1H. Clinicians Should Not Initiate Home 
Cardiorespiratory Monitoring in Infants 
Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE 
(Grade B, Moderate Recommendation)
The use of ambulatory 
cardiorespiratory monitors in infants 
presenting with ALTEs has been 
proposed as a modality to identify 
subsequent events, reduce the risk 
of SIDS, and alert caregivers of the 
need for intervention. Monitors 
can identify respiratory pauses 
and bradycardia in many infants 
presenting with ALTE; however, 
these events are also occasionally 
observed in otherwise normal 
infants.34, 
40 In addition, infant 
monitors are prone to artifact and 
have not been shown to improve 
outcomes or prevent SIDS or improve 
neurodevelopmental outcomes.63 
Indeed, caregiver anxiety may be 
exacerbated with the use of infant 
monitors and potential false alarms. 
The overwhelming majority of 
monitor-identified alarms, including 
many with reported clinical 
symptomatology, do not reveal 
abnormalities on cardiorespiratory 
recordings.64–66 Finally, there are 
several studies showing a lack of 
correlation between ALTEs and 
SIDS.24, 
32
Kahn and Blum41 monitored 50 
infants considered at “high risk” of 
SIDS and reported that 80% had 
alarms at home. All infants with 
alarms had at least 1 episode of 
parental intervention motivated by 
the alarms, although the authors 
acknowledged that some cases of 
parental intervention may have been 
attributable to parental anxiety. 
Nevertheless, the stimulated infants 
did not die of SIDS or require 
rehospitalization and therefore 
it was concluded that monitoring

but this was not firmly established. 
Côté et al40 reported “significant 
events” involving central apnea 
and bradycardia with long-term 
monitoring. However, these events 
were later shown to be frequently 
present in otherwise well infants.34 
There are insufficient data to 
support the use of commercial 
infant monitoring devices marketed 
directly to parents for the purposes 
of SIDS prevention.63 These monitors 
may be prone to false alarms, 
produce anxiety, and disrupt sleep. 
Furthermore, these machines are 
frequently used without a medical 
support system and in the absence of 
specific training to respond to alarms. 
Although it is beyond the scope 
of this clinical practice guideline, 
future research may show that home 
monitoring (cardiorespiratory and/
or oximetry) is appropriate for some 
infants with higher-risk BRUE.
2. Child Abuse
2A. Clinicians Need Not Obtain 
Neuroimaging (Computed Tomography, 
MRI, or Ultrasonography) To Detect 
Child Abuse in Infants Presenting With 
a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, Weak 
Recommendation)
2B. Clinicians Should Obtain an 
Assessment of Social Risk Factors To 
Detect Child Abuse in Infants Presenting 
With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, 
Moderate Recommendation)
Child abuse is a common and serious 
cause of an ALTE. Previous research 
has suggested that this occurs in 
up to 10% of ALTE cohorts.3, 
67 
Abusive head trauma is the most 
common form of child maltreatment 
associated with an ALTE. Other forms 
of child abuse that can present as an 
ALTE, but would not be identified 
by radiologic evaluations, include 
caregiver-fabricated illness (formally 
known as Münchausen by proxy), 
smothering, and poisoning.
Children who have experienced 
child abuse, most notably abusive 
head trauma, may present with a 
BRUE. Four studies reported a low 
incidence (0.54%–2.5%) of abusive 
head trauma in infants presenting to 
the emergency department with an 
ALTE.22, 
37, 
67, 
69 If only those patients 
meeting lower-risk BRUE criteria 
were included, the incidence of 
abusive head trauma would have 
been <0.3%. Although missing 
abusive head trauma can result in 
significant morbidity and mortality, 
the yield of performing neuroimaging 
to screen for abusive head trauma 
is extremely low and has associated 
risks of sedation and radiation 
exposure.32, 
70
Unfortunately, the subtle 
presentation of child abuse may lead 
to a delayed diagnosis of abuse and 
result in significant morbidity and 
mortality.70 A thorough history and 
physical examination is the best way 
to identify infants at risk of these

conditions.67, 
71 Significant concerning 
features for child abuse (especially 
abusive head trauma) can include 
a developmentally inconsistent or 
discrepant history provided by the 
caregiver(s), a previous ALTE, a 
recent emergency service telephone 
call, vomiting, irritability, or bleeding 
from the nose or mouth.67, 
71
Clinicians and medical team members 
(eg, nurses and social workers) 
should obtain an assessment of 
social risk factors in infants with a 
BRUE, including negative attributions 
to and unrealistic expectations of 
the child, mental health problems, 
domestic violence/intimate partner 
violence, social service involvement, 
law enforcement involvement, and 
substance abuse.68 In addition, 
clinicians and medical team members 
can help families identify and use 
resources that may expand and 
strengthen their network of social 
support.
In previously described ALTE cohorts, 
abnormal physical findings were 
associated with an increased risk of 
abusive head trauma. These findings 
include bruising, subconjunctival 
hemorrhage, bleeding from the nose 
or mouth, and a history of rapid head 
enlargement or head circumference 
>95th percentile.67, 
70–74 It is 
important to perform a careful 
physical examination to identify 
subtle findings of child abuse, 
including a large or full/bulging 
anterior fontanel, scalp bruising or 
bogginess, oropharynx or frenula 
damage, or skin findings such as 
bruising or petechiae, especially on 
the trunk, face, or ears. A normal 
physical examination does not rule 
out the possibility of abusive head 
trauma. Although beyond the scope 
of this guideline, it is important for 
the clinician to note that according 
to the available evidence, brain 
neuroimaging is probably indicated 
in patients who qualify as higher-risk 
because of concerns about abuse 
resulting from abnormal history or 
physical findings.67
A social and environmental 
assessment should evaluate the 
risk of intentional poisoning, 
unintentional poisoning, and 
environmental exposure (eg, home 
environment), because these can 
be associated with the symptoms 
of ALTEs in infants.75–78 In 1 study, 
8.4% of children presenting to the 
emergency department after an 
ALTE were found to have a clinically 
significant, positive comprehensive 
toxicology screen.76 Ethanol or other 
drugs have also been associated with 
ALTEs.79 Pulmonary hemorrhage 
can be caused by environmental 
exposure to moldy, water-damaged 
homes; it would usually present with 
hemoptysis and thus probably would 
not qualify as a BRUE.80
3. Neurology
3A. Clinicians Should Not Obtain 
Neuroimaging (Computed Tomography, 
MRI, or Ultrasonography) To Detect 
Neurologic Disorders in Infants 
Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE 
(Grade C, Moderate Recommendation)
Epilepsy or an abnormality of brain 
structure can present as a lower-
risk BRUE. CNS imaging is 1 method 
for evaluating whether underlying 
abnormalities of brain development 
or structure might have led to 
the BRUE. The long-term risk of a 
diagnosis of neurologic disorders 
ranges from 3% to 11% in historical 
cohorts of ALTE patients.2, 
32 One 
retrospective study in 243 ALTE 
patients reported that CNS imaging 
contributed to a neurologic diagnosis 
in 3% to 7% of patients.4 However, 
the study population included 
all ALTEs, including those with a 
significant past medical history, non–
well-appearing infants, and those 
with tests ordered as part of the 
emergency department evaluation.
In a large study of ALTE patients, 
the utility of CNS imaging studies 
in potentially classifiable lower-
risk BRUE patients was found to be 
low.32 The cohort of 471 patients was 
followed both acutely and long-term 
for the development of epilepsy and 
other neurologic disorders, and the 
sensitivity and positive-predictive 
value of abnormal CNS imaging for 
subsequent development of epilepsy 
was 6.7% (95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 0.2%–32%) and 25% (95% CI: 
0.6%–81%), respectively.
The available evidence suggests 
minimal utility of CNS imaging to 
evaluate for neurologic disorders, 
including epilepsy, in lower-risk 
patients. This situation is particularly 
true for pediatric epilepsy, in which 
even if a patient is determined 
ultimately to have seizures/epilepsy, 
there is no evidence of benefit from 
starting therapy after the first seizure 
compared with starting therapy 
after a second seizure in terms of 
achieving seizure remission.81–83 
However, our recommendations 
for BRUEs are not based on any 
prospective studies and only on a 
single retrospective study. Future 
work should track both short- and 
long-term neurologic outcomes when 
considering this issue.
3B. Clinicians Should Not Obtain an 
EEG To Detect Neurologic Disorders 
in Infants Presenting With a Lower-
Risk BRUE (Grade C, Moderate 
Recommendation)
Epilepsy may first present as a lower-
risk BRUE. The long-term risk of 
epilepsy ranges from 3% to 11% in 
historical cohorts of ALTE patients.2, 
32 
EEG is part of the typical evaluation 
for diagnosis of seizure disorders. 
However, the utility of obtaining an 
EEG routinely was found to be low 
in 1 study.32 In a cohort of 471 ALTE 
patients followed both acutely and 
long-term for the development of 
epilepsy, the sensitivity and positive-
predictive value of an abnormal 
EEG for subsequent development 
of epilepsy was 15% (95% CI: 
2%–45%) and 33% (95% CI: 
4.3%–48%), respectively. In contrast, 
another retrospective study in 243 
ALTE patients reported that EEG 
contributed to a neurologic diagnosis 
in 6% of patients.4 This study

population differed significantly from 
that of Bonkowsky et al32 in that 
all ALTE patients with a significant 
past medical history and non–well-
appearing infants were included in 
the analysis and that tests ordered 
in the emergency department 
evaluation were also included in the 
measure of EEG yield.
A diagnosis of seizure is difficult to 
make from presenting symptoms 
of an ALTE.30 Although EEG is 
recommended by the American 
Academy of Neurology after a first-
time nonfebrile seizure, the yield and 
sensitivity of an EEG after a first-time 
ALTE in a lower-risk child are low.86 
Thus, the evidence available suggests 
no utility for routine EEG to evaluate 
for epilepsy in a lower-risk BRUE. 
However, our recommendations for 
BRUEs are based on no prospective 
studies and on only a single 
retrospective study. Future work 
should track both short- and long-
term epilepsy when considering this 
issue.
Finally, even if a patient is 
determined ultimately to have 
seizures/epilepsy, the importance of 
an EEG for a first-time ALTE is low, 
because there is little evidence that 
shows a benefit from starting therapy 
after the first seizure compared with 
after a second seizure in terms of 
achieving seizure remission.81–83, 
85
3C. Clinicians Should Not Prescribe 
Antiepileptic Medications for Potential 
Neurologic Disorders in Infants 
Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE 
(Grade C, Moderate Recommendation)
Once epilepsy is diagnosed, 
treatment can consist of therapy 
with an antiepileptic medication. 
In a cohort of 471 ALTE patients 
followed both acutely and long-
term for the development of 
epilepsy, most patients who 
developed epilepsy had a second 
event within 1 month of their 
initial presentation.32, 
87 Even if a 
patient is determined ultimately to 
have seizures/epilepsy, there is no 
evidence of benefit from starting 
therapy after the first seizure 
compared with starting therapy 
after a second seizure in terms of 
achieving seizure remission.81–83, 
85 
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy 
(SUDEP) has a frequency close to 1 
in 1000 patient-years, but the risks 
of SUDEP are distinct from ALTEs/
BRUEs and include adolescent age 
and presence of epilepsy for more 
than 5 years. These data do not 
support prescribing an antiepileptic 
medicine for a first-time possible 
seizure because of a concern for 
SUDEP. Thus, the evidence available 
for ALTEs suggests lack of benefit for 
starting an antiepileptic medication 
for a lower-risk BRUE. However, our 
recommendations for BRUEs are 
based on no prospective studies and 
on only a single retrospective study. 
Future work should track both 
short- and long-term epilepsy when 
considering this issue.

detected during the initial workup. 
However, on further review of 
such cases with serious bacterial 
infections, these infants did not 
qualify as lower-risk BRUEs, because 
they had risk factors (eg, age <2 
months) and/or appeared ill and 
had abnormal findings on physical 
examination (eg, meningeal signs, 
nuchal rigidity, hypothermia, shock, 
respiratory failure) suggesting a 
possible severe bacterial infection. 
After eliminating those cases, 
it appears extremely unlikely 
that meningitis or sepsis will 
be the etiology of a lower-risk 
BRUE.2–4, 
37, 
88, 
89 Furthermore, 
performing these tests for bacterial 
infection may then lead the clinician to 
empirically treat with antibiotics with 
the consequent risks of medication 
adverse effects, intravenous 
catheters, and development of 
resistant organisms. Furthermore, 
false-positive blood cultures (eg, 
coagulase negative staphylococci, 
Bacillus species, Streptococcus 
viridans) are likely to occur at times, 
leading to additional testing, longer 
hospitalization and antibiotic use, and 
increased parental anxiety until they 
are confirmed as contaminants.
Thus, the available evidence suggests 
that a complete blood cell count, 
blood culture, and lumbar puncture 
are not of benefit in infants with the 
absence of risk factors or findings 
from the patient’s history, vital 
signs, and physical examination (ie, a 
lower-risk BRUE).
4B. Clinicians Need Not Obtain a 
Urinalysis (Bag or Catheter) in Infants 
Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE 
(Grade C, Weak Recommendation)
Case series of infants with ALTEs 
have suggested that a urinary tract 
infection (UTI) may be detected at 
the time of first ALTE presentation 
in up to 8% of cases.3, 
4, 
37, 
88 Claudius 
et al88 provided insight into 17 cases 
of certain (n = 13) or possible (n = 
4) UTI. However, 14 of these cases 
would not meet the criteria for a 
lower-risk BRUE on the basis of age 
younger than 2 months or being ill-
appearing and/or having fever at 
presentation.
Furthermore, these studies do 
not always specify the method of 
urine collection, urinalysis findings, 
and/or the specific organisms and 
colony-forming units per milliliter 
of the isolates associated with the 
reported UTIs that would confirm the 
diagnosis. AAP guidelines for 
the diagnosis and management of 
UTIs in children 2 to 24 months of 
age assert that the diagnosis of UTI 
requires “both urinalysis results 
that suggest infection (pyuria and/
or bacteruria) and the presence of at 
least 50 000 colony-forming units/mL 
of a uropathogen cultured from a 
urine specimen obtained through 
catheterization or suprapubic 
aspirate.”90 Thus, it seems unlikely 
for a UTI to present as a lower-risk 
BRUE.
Pending more detailed studies that 
apply a rigorous definition of UTI to 
infants presenting with a lower-risk 
BRUE, a screening urinalysis need 
not be obtained routinely. If it is 
decided to evaluate the infant for a 
possible UTI, then a urinalysis can be 
obtained but should only be followed 
up with a culture if the urinalysis has

leukocyte esterase).
4C. Clinicians Should Not Obtain a Chest 
Radiograph To Assess for Pulmonary 
Infection in Infants Presenting With a 
Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade B, Moderate 
Recommendation)
Chest radiography is unlikely to 
yield clinical benefit in a well-
appearing infant presenting with a 
lower-risk BRUE. In the absence of 
abnormal respiratory findings (eg, 
cough, tachypnea, decreased oxygen 
saturation, auscultatory changes), 
lower respiratory tract infection is 
unlikely to be present.
Studies in children presenting with 
an ALTE have described occasional 
cases with abnormal findings on 
chest radiography in the absence of 
respiratory findings on history or 
physical examination.4, 
37 However, 
the nature of the abnormalities and 
their role in the ALTE presentation in 
the absence of further details about 
the radiography results make it 
difficult to interpret the significance 
of these observations. For instance, 
descriptions of increased interstitial 
markings or small areas of atelectasis 
would not have the same implication 
as a focal consolidation or pleural 
effusion.
Kant et al, 
18 in a follow-up of 176 
children admitted for an ALTE, 
reported that 2 infants died within 
2 weeks of discharge and both 
were found to have pneumonia 
on postmortem examination. This 
observation does not support the 
potential indication for an initial 
radiograph. In fact, one of the 
children had a normal radiograph 
during the initial evaluation. 
The finding of pneumonia on 
postmortem examination may 
reflect an agonal aspiration 
event. Brand et al4 reported 14 
cases of pneumonia identified at 
presentation in their analysis of 95 
cases of ALTEs. However, in 13 of 
the patients, findings suggestive of 
lower respiratory infection, such as 
tachypnea, stridor, retractions, use 
of accessory muscles, or adventitious 
sounds on auscultation, were 
detected at presentation, leading to 
the request for chest radiography.

Respiratory Viral Testing If Rapid 
Testing Is Available in Infants

Respiratory viral infections 
(especially with respiratory syncytial

patients tested being positive for 
RSV.2,

observed predominantly in children 
younger than 2 months and/or those 
who were born prematurely. Recent 
data suggest that apnea or an ALTE 
presentation is not unique to RSV 
and may be seen with a spectrum of 
respiratory viral infections.90 The 
data in ALTE cases do not address 
the potential role of other respiratory 
viruses in ALTEs or BRUEs.
In older children, respiratory viral 
infection would be expected to 
present with symptoms ranging 
from upper respiratory to lower

considerations in deciding whether 
to order rapid testing for respiratory 
viruses. Because lower-risk BRUE 
patients do not have these symptoms, 
clinicians need not perform such 
testing.
In addition, until recently and in 
reports of ALTE patients to date, 
RSV testing was performed by 
using antigen detection tests. More 
recently, automated nucleic acid 
amplification-based tests have 
entered clinical practice. These 
assays are more sensitive than 
antigen detection tests and can 
detect multiple viruses from a single 
nasopharyngeal swab. The use of 
these tests in future research may 
allow better elucidation of the role 
of respiratory viruses in patients 
presenting with an ALTE in general 
and whether they play a role in 
BRUEs.
As a cautionary note, detection of 
a virus in a viral multiplex assay 
may not prove causality, because 
some agents, such as rhinovirus and 
adenovirus, may persist for periods 
beyond the acute infection (up to 
30 days) and may or may not be 
related to the present episode.92 In a 
lower-risk BRUE without respiratory 
symptoms testing for viral infection 
may not be indicated, but in the 
presence of congestion and/or 
cough, or recent exposure to a viral 
respiratory infection, such testing 
may provide useful information 
regarding the cause of the child’s 
symptoms and for infection control 
management. Anticipatory guidance 
and arranging close follow-up at the 
initial presentation could be helpful 
if patients subsequently develop 
symptoms of a viral infection.
4E. Clinicians May Obtain Testing for 
Pertussis in Infants Presenting With 
a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade B, Weak 
Recommendation)
Pertussis infection has been reported 
to cause ALTEs in infants, because 
it can cause gagging, gasping, and 
color change followed by respiratory 
pause. Such infants can be afebrile 
and may not develop cough or lower 
respiratory symptoms for several 
days afterward.
The decision to test a lower-risk 
BRUE patient for pertussis should 
consider potential exposures, vaccine 
history (including intrapartum 
immunization of the mother as well 
as the infant’s vaccination history), 
awareness of pertussis activity in 
the community, and turnaround 
time for results. Polymerase chain 
reaction testing for pertussis on 
a nasopharyngeal specimen, if 
available, offers the advantage of 
rapid turnaround time to results.94 
Culture for the organism requires 
selective media and will take days to 
yield results but may still be useful in 
the face of identified risk of exposure.

5. Gastroenterology
5A. Clinicians Should Not Obtain 
Investigations for GER (eg, Upper 
Gastrointestinal Series, pH Probe, 
Endoscopy, Barium Contrast 
Study, Nuclear Scintigraphy, and 
Ultrasonography) in Infants Presenting 
With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, 
Moderate Recommendation)
GER occurs in more than two-
thirds of infants and is the topic 
of discussion with pediatricians at 
one-quarter of all routine 6-month 
infant visits.96 GER can lead to 
airway obstruction, laryngospasm, or 
aspiration. Although ALTEs that can 
be attributed to GER symptoms (eg, 
choking after spitting up) qualify as 
an ALTE according to the National 
Institutes of Health definition, 
importantly, they do not qualify as a 
BRUE.
GER may still be a contributing 
factor to a lower-risk BRUE if the 
patient’s GER symptoms were not 
witnessed or well described by 
caregivers. However, the available 
evidence suggests no utility of 
routine diagnostic testing to evaluate 
for GER in these patients. The brief 
period of observation that occurs 
during an upper gastrointestinal 
series is inadequate to rule out the 
occurrence of pathologic reflux at 
other times, and the high prevalence 
of nonpathologic reflux that 
often occurs during the study can 
encourage false-positive diagnoses. 
In addition, the observation of the 
reflux of a barium column into the 
esophagus during gastrointestinal 
contrast studies may not correlate 
with the severity of GER or the 
degree of esophageal mucosal 
inflammation in patients with reflux 
esophagitis. Routine performance 
of an upper gastrointestinal series 
to diagnose GER is not justified 
and should be reserved to screen 
for anatomic abnormalities 
associated with vomiting (which 
is a symptom that precludes the 
diagnosis of a lower-risk BRUE).98 
Gastroesophageal scintigraphy scans 
for reflux of 99mTc-labeled solids or 
liquids into the esophagus or lungs 
after the administration of the test 
material into the stomach. The lack 
of standardized techniques and age-
specific normal values limits the 
usefulness of this test. Therefore, 
gastroesophageal scintigraphy is 
not recommended in the routine 
evaluation of pediatric patients 
with GER symptoms or a lower-
risk BRUE.97 Multiple intraluminal 
impedance (MII) is useful for 
detecting both acidic and nonacidic 
reflux, thereby providing a more 
detailed picture of esophageal events 
than pH monitoring. Combined 
pH/MII testing is evolving into the 
test of choice to detect temporal 
relationships between specific 
symptoms and the reflux of both 
acid and nonacid gastric contents. 
In particular, MII has been used in 
recent years to investigate how 
GER correlates with respiratory 
symptoms, such as apnea or 
cough. Performing esophageal 
pH +/- impedance monitoring is not 
indicated in the routine evaluation of 
infants presenting with a lower-risk 
BRUE, although it may be considered 
in patients with recurrent BRUEs and 
GER symptoms even if these occur 
independently.
Problems with the coordination 
of feedings can lead to ALTEs and 
BRUEs. In a study in Austrian 
newborns, infants who experienced 
an ALTE had a more than twofold 
increase in feeding difficulties 
(multivariate relative risk: 2.5; 95% 
CI: 1.3–4.6).99 In such patients, it 
is likely that poor suck-swallow-
breathe coordination triggered 
choking or laryngospasm. A clinical 
speech therapy evaluation may 
help to evaluate any concerns for 
poor coordination swallowing with 
feeding.

pump inhibitors may be indicated 
in selected pediatric patients with 
GER disease (GERD), which is 
diagnosed in patients when reflux of 
gastric contents causes troublesome 
symptoms or complications.98 Infants 
with spitting up or throat-clearing 
coughs that are not troublesome 
do not meet diagnostic criteria for 
GERD. Indeed, the inappropriate 
administration of acid suppression 
therapy may have harmful adverse 
effects because it exposes infants to 
an increased risk of pneumonia or 
gastroenteritis.100
GER leading to apnea is not always 
clinically apparent and can be the 
cause of a BRUE. Acid reflux into 
the esophagus has been shown 
to be temporally associated 
with oxygen desaturation and 
obstructive apnea, suggesting that 
esophageal reflux may be one of the 
underlying conditions in selected 
infants presenting with BRUEs.101 
Respiratory symptoms are more 
likely to be associated with GER 
when gross emesis occurs at the 
time of a BRUE, when episodes 
occur while the infant is awake 
and supine (sometimes referred 
to as “awake apnea”), and when 
a pattern of obstructive apnea is 
observed while the infant is making 
respiratory efforts without effective 
air movement.102
Wenzl et al103 reported a temporal 
association between 30% of the 
nonpathologic, short episodes of 
central apnea and GER by analyzing 
combined data from simultaneous 
esophageal and cardiorespiratory 
monitoring. These findings cannot 
be extrapolated to pathologic infant 
apnea and may represent a normal 
protective cessation of breathing 
during regurgitation. Similarly, 
Mousa et al104 analyzed data from 
527 apneic events in 25 infants 
and observed that only 15.2% 
were temporally associated with 
GER. Furthermore, there was no 
difference in the linkage between 
apneic events and acid reflux 
(7.0%) and nonacid reflux (8.2%). 
They concluded that there is little 
evidence for an association between 
acid reflux or nonacid reflux and 
the frequency of apnea. Regression 
analysis revealed a significant 
association between apnea and 
reflux in 4 of 25 infants. Thus, in 
selected infants, a clear temporal 
relationship between apnea and 
ALTE can be shown. However, larger 
studies have not proven a causal 
relationship between pathologic 
apnea and GER.105
As outlined in the definition 
of a BRUE, when an apparent 
explanation for the event, such as 
GER, is evident at the time of initial 
evaluation, the patient should 
be managed as appropriate for 
the clinical situation. However, 
BRUEs can be caused by episodes 
of reflux-related laryngospasm 
(sometimes referred to as “silent 
reflux”), which may not be clinically 
apparent at the time of initial 
evaluation. Laryngospasm may 
also occur during feeding in the 
absence of GER. Measures that have 
been shown to be helpful in the 
nonpharmacologic management 
of GER in infants include avoiding 
overfeeding, frequent burping 
during feeding, upright positioning 
in the caregiver’s arms after feeding, 
and avoidance of secondhand 
smoke.106 Thickening feedings 
with commercially thickened 
formula for infants without milk-
protein intolerance does not alter 
esophageal acid exposure detected 
by esophageal pH study but has been 
shown to decrease the frequency of 
regurgitation. Given the temporal 
association observed between 
GER and respiratory symptoms in 
selected infants, approaches that 
decrease the height of the reflux 
column, the volume of refluxate, 
and the frequency of reflux episodes 
may theoretically be beneficial.98 
Combined pH/MII testing has 
shown that, although the frequency 
of reflux events is unchanged with 
thickened formula, the height of the 
column of refluxate is decreased. 
Studies have shown that holding the 
infant on the caregiver’s shoulders 
for 10 to 20 minutes to allow for 
adequate burping after a feeding 
before placing the infant in the “back 
to sleep position” can decrease 
the frequency of GER in infants. 
In contrast, placing an infant in 
a car seat or in other semisupine 
positions, such as in an infant 
carrier, exacerbates esophageal 
reflux and should be avoided.98 
The frequency of GER has been 
reported to be decreased in 
breastfed compared with formula-
fed infants. Thus, the benefits of 
breastfeeding are preferred over 
the theoretical effect of thickened 
formula feeding, so exclusive 
breastfeeding should be encouraged 
whenever possible.

IEMs are reported to cause an ALTE 
in 0% to 5% of cases.2, 
27, 
38, 
99, 
107, 
108 
On the basis of the information 
provided by the authors for these 
patients, it seems unlikely that 
events could have been classified as 
a lower-risk BRUE, either because 
the patient had a positive history 
or physical examination or a 
recurrent event. The most commonly 
reported disorders include fatty 
acid oxidation disorders or urea 
cycle disorders.107, 
109 In cases of 
vague or resolved symptoms, a 
careful history can help determine 
whether the infant had not received 
previous treatment (eg, feeding 
after listlessness for suspected 
hypoglycemia). These rare 
circumstances could include milder 
or later-onset presentations of IEMs.
Infants may be classified as being 
at a higher risk of BRUE because 
of a family history of an IEM, 
developmental disabilities, SIDS, 
or a medical history of abnormal 
newborn screening results, 
unexplained infant death, age younger 
than 2 months, a prolonged event 
(>1 minute), or multiple events 
without an explanation. Confirmation 
that a newborn screen is complete and 
is negative is an important aspect of the 
medical history, but the clinician must 
consider that not all potential disorders 
are included in current newborn 
screening panels in the United States.
Lactic Acid
Measurement of lactic acid can 
result in high false-positive rates if 
the sample is not collected properly, 
making the decision to check a lactic 
acid problematic. In addition, lactic 
acid may be elevated because of 
metabolic abnormalities attributable 
to other conditions, such as sepsis, 
and are not specific for IEMs.
Only 2 studies evaluated the specific 
measurement of lactic acid.27, 
38 
Davies and Gupta38 reported 65 
infants with consistent laboratory 
evaluations and found that 54% of 
infants had a lactic acid >2 mmol/L 
but only 15% had levels >3 mmol/L. 
The latter percentage of infants are 
more likely to be clinically significant 
and less likely to reflect a false-
positive result. Five of 7 infants 
with a lactic acid >3 mmol/L had a 
“specific, serious diagnosis, 
” although 
the specifics of these diagnoses 
were not included and no IEM was

confirmed in this study. This study 
also reported a 20% positive yield 
of testing for a bicarbonate <20 
mmol/L and commented that there 
was a trend for lower bicarbonate 
and higher lactic acid levels in those 
with a recurrent event or a definitive 
diagnosis. The second publication27 
found no elevations of lactate in 4 
of 49 children who had an initial 
abnormal venous blood gas, of which 
all repeat blood gas measurements 
were normal.
Serum Bicarbonate
Abnormal serum bicarbonate levels 
have been studied in 11 infants, of 
whom 7 had a diagnosis of sepsis 
or seizures.38 Brand et al4 studied 
215 infants who had bicarbonate 
measured and found only 9 
abnormal results, and only 3 of these 
contributed to the final diagnosis. 
Although unknown, it is most likely 
that the event in those infants would 
not have been classified as a BRUE 
under the new classification, because 
those infants were most likely 
symptomatic on presentation. 
Serum Glucose
Abnormal blood glucose levels 
were evaluated but not reported 
in 3 studies.4, 
38, 
110 Although 
abnormalities of blood glucose can 
occur from various IEMs, such as 
medium-chain acyl–coenzyme A 
dehydrogenase deficiency or 
other fatty acid oxidation disorders, 
their prevalence has not been 
increased in SIDS and near-miss 
SIDS but could be considered as a 
cause of higher-risk BRUEs.111 It 
is important to clarify through a 
careful medical history evaluation 
that the infant was not potentially 
hypoglycemic at discovery of the 
event and improved because of 
enteral treatment, because these 
disorders will not typically self-
resolve without intervention (ie, 
feeding).
Serum Electrolytes and Calcium
ALTE studies evaluating the 
diagnostic value of electrolytes, 
including sodium, potassium, blood 
urea nitrogen, and creatinine, 
reported the rare occurrence of 
abnormalities, ranging from 0% to 
4.3%.4, 
38, 
110 Abnormal calcium levels 
have been reported in 0% to 1.5% 
of infants with ALTE, although these 
reports did not provide specific 
causes of hypocalcemia. Another 
study reported profound vitamin D 
deficiency with hypocalcemia in 
5 of 25 infants with a diagnosis of an 
ALTE over a 2-year period in 
Saudi Arabia.4, 
21, 
38, 
110 In lower-risk 
BRUE infants, clinicians should not 
obtain a calcium measurement 
unless the clinical history raises 
suspicion of hypocalcemia 
(eg, vitamin D deficiency or 
hypoparathyroidism).
Ammonia
Elevations of ammonia are typically 
associated with persistent symptoms 
and recurring events, and therefore 
testing would not be indicated in 
lower-risk BRUEs. Elevations of 
ammonia were reported in 11 infants 
(7 whom had an IEM) in a report 
of infants with recurrent ALTE 
and SIDS, limiting extrapolation to

49 completed, all of which were 
normal on repeat measurements 
(along with normal lactate and 
ammonia levels). Blood gas detection 
is a routine test performed in acutely 
symptomatic patients who are being 
evaluated for suspected IEMs and 
may be considered in higher-risk 
BRUEs.
Urine Organic Acids, Plasma Amino 
Acids, Plasma Acylcarnitines
The role of advanced screening for 
IEMs has been reported in only 1 
publication. Davies and Gupta38 
reported abnormalities of urine 
organic acids in 2% of cases and 
abnormalities of plasma amino acids 
in 4% of cases. Other reports have 
described an “unspecified metabolic 
screen” that was abnormal in 4.5% 
of cases but did not provide further 
description of specifics within 
that “screen.”4 Other reports have 
frequently included the descriptions 
of ALTEs with urea cycle disorders, 
organic acidemias, lactic acidemias, 
and fatty acid oxidation disorders 
such as medium chain acyl–
coenzyme A dehydrogenase 
deficiency but did not distinguish 
between SIDS and near-miss 
SIDS.107, 
109, 
111 Specific testing of 
urine organic acids, plasma amino 
acids, or plasma acylcarnitines may 
have a role in patients with a higher-
risk BRUE.
7. Anemia
7A. Clinicians Should Not Obtain 
Laboratory Evaluation for Anemia 
in Infants Presenting With a Lower-
Risk BRUE (Grade C, Moderate 
Recommendation)
Anemia has been associated with 
ALTEs in infants, but the significance 
and causal association with the event 
itself are unclear.38, 
112, 
113 Normal 
hemoglobin concentrations have also 
been reported in many other ALTE 
populations.69, 
112, 
114 Brand et al4 
reported an abnormal hemoglobin in 
54 of 223 cases, but in only 2 of 159 
was the hemoglobin concentration 
associated with the final diagnosis 
(which was abusive head injury 
in both). Parker and Pitetti22 also 
reported that infants who presented 
with ALTEs and ultimately were 
determined to be victims of child 
abuse were more likely to have a 
lower mean hemoglobin (10.6 
vs 12.7 g/dL; P = .02).
8. Patient- and Family-Centered Care
8A. Clinicians Should Offer Resources 
for CPR Training to Caregivers (Grade C, 
Moderate Recommendation)
The majority of cardiac arrests in 
children result from a respiratory 
deterioration. Bystander CPR 
has been reported to have been 
conducted in 37% to 48% of pediatric 
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and

in 34% of respiratory arrests.116 
Bystander CPR results in significant 
improvement in 1-month survival 
rates in both cardiac and respiratory 
arrest.117–119
Although lower-risk BRUEs are 
neither a cardiac nor a respiratory 
arrest, the AAP policy statement on 
CPR recommends that pediatricians 
advocate for life-support training for 
caregivers and the general public.115 
A technical report that accompanies 
the AAP policy statement on CPR 
proposes that this can improve 
overall community health.115 CPR 
training has not been shown to 
increase caregiver anxiety, and in 
fact, caregivers have reported a 
sense of empowerment.120–122 There 
are many accessible and effective 
methods for CPR training (eg, 
e-learning).
8B. Clinicians Should Educate 
Caregivers About BRUEs (Grade C, 
Moderate Recommendation)
Pediatric providers are an important 
source of this health information 
and can help guide important 
conversations around BRUEs. A 
study by Feudtner et al123 identified 
4 groups of attributes of a “good 
parent”: (1) making sure the child 
feels loved, (2) focusing on the 
child’s health, (3) advocating for 
the child and being informed, and 
(4) ensuring the child’s spiritual 
well-being. Clinicians should be the 
source of information for caregivers. 
Informed caregivers can advocate 
for their child in all of the attribute 
areas/domains, and regardless of 
health literacy levels, prefer being 
offered choices and being asked for 
information.124 A patient- and family-
centered care approach results in 
better health outcomes.125, 
126
8C. Clinicians Should Use Shared 
Decision-Making for Infants Presenting 
With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, 
Moderate Recommendation)
Shared decision-making is a 
partnership between the clinician 
and the patient and family.125, 
126 
The general principles of shared 
decision-making are as follows: (1) 
information sharing, (2) respect and 
honoring differences, (3) partnership 
and collaboration, (4) negotiation, 
and (5) care in the context of family 
and community.125 The benefits 
include improved care and outcomes; 
improved patient, family, and 
clinician satisfaction; and better use 
of health resources.126 It is advocated 
for by organizations such as the AAP 
and the Institute of Medicine.126, 
127 
The 5 principles can be applied to 
all aspects of the infant who has 
experienced a BRUE, through each 
step (assessment, stabilization, 
management, disposition, and 
follow-up). Shared decision-making 
will empower families and foster 
a stronger clinician-patient/family 
alliance as they make decisions 
together in the face of a seemingly 
uncertain situation.
DISSEMINATION AND 
IMPLEMENTATION
Dissemination and implementation 
efforts are needed to facilitate 
guideline use across pediatric 
medicine, family medicine, 
emergency medicine, research, and 
patient/family communities.128 
The following general approaches 
and a Web-based toolkit are 
proposed for the dissemination and 
implementation of this guideline.

1. Education
Education will be partially achieved 
through the AAP communication 
outlets and educational services 
(AAP News, Pediatrics, 
 and PREP). 
Further support will be sought from 
stakeholder organizations (American 
Academy of Family Physicians, 
American College of Emergency 
Physicians, American Board of 
Pediatrics, Society of Hospital 
Medicine). A Web-based toolkit (to 
be published online) will include 
caregiver handouts and a shared 
decision-making tool to facilitate 
patient- and family-centered care. 
Efforts will address appropriate 
disease classification and diagnosis 
coding.
2. Integration of Clinical Workfl
 ow
An algorithm is provided (Fig 1) 
for diagnosis and management. 
Structured history and physical 
examination templates also are 
provided to assist in addressing all 
of the relevant risk factors for BRUEs 
(Tables 2 and 3). Order sets and 
modified documents will be hosted 
on a Web-based learning platform 
that promotes crowd-sourcing.
3. Administrative and Research
International Classification 
of Diseases, 9th Revision, and 
International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision, diagnostic 
codes are used for billing, quality 
improvement, and research; and 
new codes for lower- and higher-risk 
BRUEs will need to be developed. 
In the interim, the current code for 
an ALTE (799.82) will need to be 
used for billing purposes. Efforts will 
be made to better reflect present 
knowledge and to educate clinicians 
and payers in appropriate use of 
codes for this condition.
4. Quality Improvement
Quality improvement initiatives that 
provide Maintenance of Certification 
credit, such as the AAP's PREP and 
EQIPP courses, or collaborative 
opportunities through the AAP's 
Quality Improvement Innovation 
Networks, will engage clinicians 
in the use and improvement of the 
guideline. By using proposed quality 
measures, adherence and outcomes 
can be assessed and benchmarked 
with others to inform continual 
improvement efforts. Proposed 
measures include process evaluation 
(use of definition and evaluation), 
outcome assessment (family 
experience and diagnostic outcomes), 
and balancing issues (cost and length 
of visit). Future research will need 
to be conducted to validate any 
measures.
FUTURE RESEARCH
The transition in nomenclature from 
the term ALTE to BRUE after 30 years 
reflects the expanded understanding 
of the etiology and consequences 
of this entity. Previous research 
has been largely retrospective or 
observational in nature, with little 
long-term follow-up data available. 
The more-precise definition, the 
classification of lower- and higher-
risk groups, the recommendations 
for the lower-risk group, and the 
implementation toolkit will serve 
as the basis for future research. 
Important areas for future 
prospective research include the 
following.
1. Epidemiology
 
• Incidence of BRUEs in all infants 
(in addition to those seeking 
medical evaluation)
 
• Influence of race, gender, ethnicity, 
seasonality, environmental 
exposures, and socioeconomic 
status on incidence and outcomes
2. Diagnosis
 
• Use and effectiveness of the BRUE 
definition
 
• Screening tests and risk of UTI
 
• Quantify and better understand 
risk in higher- and lower-risk 
groups
 
• Risk and benefit of screening tests
 
• Risk and benefit and optimal 
duration of observation and 
monitoring periods
 
• Effect of prematurity on risk
 
• Appropriate indications for 
subspecialty referral
 
• Early recognition of child 
maltreatment
 
• Importance of environmental 
history taking
 
• Role of human psychology on 
accuracy of event characterization
