Abstract
Background: Physician communication about human papil-
lomavirus (HPV) vaccine is a key determinant of uptake. To
support physician communication, we sought to identify mes-
sages that would motivate HPV vaccination.
Methods: From 2014 to 2015, we surveyed national samples of
parents of adolescents ages 11 to 17 (n ¼ 1,504) and primary care
physicians (n ¼ 776). Parents read motivational messages, select-
ed from nine longer messages developed by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and six brief messages developed
by the study team. Parents indicated whether each message would
persuade them to get HPV vaccine for their adolescents. Physicians
read the brief messages and indicated whether they would use
them to persuade parents to get HPV vaccine for 11- to 12-year-old
children.
Results: The highest proportion of parents (65%) and physi-
cians (69%) found this brief message to be persuasive: "I strongly
believe in the importance of this cancer-preventing vaccine for
[child's name]." Parents disinclined to vaccinate were most recep-
tive to messages with information about HPV infection being
common, cancers caused by HPV, and HPV vaccine effectiveness.
Parents' endorsement did not vary by race/ethnicity, education,
child age, or child sex (all P > 0.05).
Conclusions: Our national surveys of parents and physicians
identified messages that could motivate HPV vaccination, even
among parents disinclined to vaccinate their children. The lack of
difference across demographic subgroups in parental endorse-
ment may suggest that these messages can be used across these
subgroups.
Impact: Our findings support physicians' use of these mes-
sages with parents to help motivate uptake of this important
cancer-preventing vaccine. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(10);

Introduction
Low uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is a
serious public health problem that is thwarting progress in cancer
prevention (1). Each year, an estimated 21,300 cancers in the
United States are attributable to HPV types 16 and 18 (2). These
types are preventable through vaccination, yet only 40% of
females and 22% of males ages 13 to 17 have received all three
doses in the vaccine series (3). This low HPV vaccination coverage
is despite national guidelines for routine administration (4, 5)
and relatively high levels of coverage for other adolescent vaccines
(6). Missed clinical opportunities for concomitant vaccination,
defined as clinical visits at which a child received another vaccine
but not HPV vaccine, are an important reason HPV vaccine
initiation is not higher (7).
Healthcare provider recommendations are uniquely persua-
sive in motivating HPV vaccination. However, many physicians
offer weak (8) or late recommendations (9), if they offer a
recommendation at all. Physicians' HPV vaccine recommenda-
tions can be inconsistent, with many physicians selectively
recommending the vaccine to patients they perceive are at
higher risk for infection rather than all patients (9). This
practice is especially worrisome as receiving a physician rec-
ommendation is a robust predictor of HPV vaccine uptake (10–
15). Given the central role physicians' recommendations play
in vaccine uptake, low-quality or absent physician communi-
cation about HPV vaccine undermines the vaccine's tremen-
dous potential to prevent anogenital cancers.
Recognizing the need for improved physician communication
about HPV vaccination, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) developed and widely disseminated resources
for healthcare providers through the national "You Are the Key"
campaign (16). To help strengthen physicians' communication,
CDC offers nine messages physicians could use to recommend
HPV vaccine to parents (6, 17). These messages were designed to
address common parental barriers to HPV vaccination (e.g.,
vaccine safety, efficacy, necessity) and resulted from several
rounds of testing with parents and physicians. Beginning with
a larger pool of messages, CDC surveyed mothers to assess their
perceptions of messages that would help them make the decision
to get their children vaccinated. CDC then interviewed pediatri-
cians to assess their understanding and usability of the messages,
and conducted focus groups with parents to refine the messages

 (J. Roark, MPH, written communication, June 2016). However,
parents' perceptions of these messages remain unknown in the
absence of published evaluation data. Moreover, at an average
length of 52 words, these messages are fairly long, which may
make them challenging to remember and thus deter physicians'
use. Our study sought to identify messages physicians would use
to recommend HPV vaccine and that would motivate parental
acceptance. The study team also developed shorter messages and
examined whether they were as effective as the longer CDC-
developed messages.
Materials and Methods
Participants and procedures
We conducted two national, online surveys of parents and
physicians in the U.S. who were members of standing panels
maintained by a survey research company (18, 19). Parents
were part of a panel of about 55,000 adults identified through a
probability-based sampling of addresses from the U.S. Postal
Service's Delivery Sequence File. This sample frame covers
about 97% of U.S. households. The survey research company
recruited its physician panelists through lists compiled by the
American Medical Association (20). The University of North
Carolina Institutional Review Board approved both study pro-
tocols. We described the participants, procedures, and survey
instruments previously (9, 21, 22) and summarize them here
briefly.
Parent survey
Parents completed our online survey between November 2014
and January 2015 (22). Eligible respondents were parents of an
11- to 17-year-old child who lived in the household at least half of
the time. For parents who had more than one child in this age
range, the survey asked parents to respond with regard to the child
who had the most recent birthday. This selection method is quick,
easy, and relatively noninvasive for participants (23), compared
with a potentially more burdensome enumeration approach in
which we obtain an identifier and request responses for every
eligible child. Parents provided a name or nickname for the
referent child, which was used in item stems throughout the
survey. To support inclusion of lower-income respondents, the
survey company provided a computer and free Internet access to
panel members without these resources for the duration of their
participation in the survey panel (19). Parents who already had a
computer and Internet access received points for completing the
survey, which could be redeemed for cash, products, or sweep-
stakes entries.
The survey company emailed invitations to 2,845 randomly
selected parents. Of those, 1,760 accessed the survey site, provided
informed consent, and completed an eligibility screener. A total of
1,518 parents met eligibility criteria and completed the survey.
After excluding 14 parents who had incomplete data, the final
analytic sample included 1,504 parents. We estimated that
13.75% of our total sample was not eligible for the survey,
resulting in 2,454 eligible parents. Using American Association
for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) definition 5 (24), the
overall response rate was 61% (1,504/2,454).
Physician survey
Physicians completed our online survey between April and
June 2014 (9, 21). Eligible respondents were pediatricians and
family physicians providing preventive care, including vaccina-
tions, to patients ages 11 to 12. We were particularly interested in
patients in this age group because they represent the target ages for
routine HPV vaccination (2). The survey company emailed invi-
tations to all 2,368 panel members with pediatric or family
medicine specialties, and 1,022 (43%) clicked on the link pro-
vided to access the survey site. Of these, 776 (76%) met eligibility
criteria and completed the survey. The survey company was
unable to provide the information required to calculate a
response rate using AAPOR definitions (24). Although data on
the percentage of ineligible respondents were unavailable, overall,
33% of physicians in the panel completed the survey. Physicians
received $25 to $45 for participating, with higher incentives used
to encourage participation later in the fielding process.
Motivational messages
The brief and longer motivational messages and their sources
appear in Supplementary Table S1. In consultation with pedia-
tricians, family physicians, and other experts on HPV vaccina-
tion, the study team developed six brief messages (defined as
25 words or fewer; messages B1–B6) designed to motivate HPV
vaccination. Nine longer messages (defined as 26 words or
longer; messages L1–L9) came from materials that the CDC
developed to aid physician communication with parents and
adolescents about HPV vaccination (6, 17). Although relatively
little is known about the relationship between health-related
print literacy and health-related oral literacy, the cognitive
processes necessary to understand information presented orally
and in writing are closely connected (25). Thus, we calculated
message readability using five standard approaches (Flesch–
Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning-Fog Score, Coleman–Liau Index,
Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) Index, Automated
Readability Index) and calculated an average readability grade
level for each message; grade 8 or lower is a minimum standard
for readability for patient communication materials, and grade
6 or lower is desirable (26). On average, the brief messages were
17 words long, and the reading grade level was 6.3 (Supple-
mentary Table S1). The longer messages averaged 52 words and
a reading grade level of 9.8.
Measures
Study surveys are available online at www.unc.edu/�ntbrewer/
hpv.htm.
Parent survey. The parent survey included the six brief motiva-
tional messages, plus nine longer messages (17), for a total of
fifteen messages. Parents were randomly assigned to panels (Panel
A, Panel B, Panel C), each of which included two brief messages
and three longer messages in a random order. The survey asked
parents, "Which of these statements made by a doctor would
persuade you to get the HPV vaccine for [child's name]?" Before
viewing the messages, parents indicated the number of HPV
vaccine doses their children had received (coded as 0 or �1
doses). For children who had not initiated HPV vaccination, the
survey assessed parents' HPV vaccination intention by asking,
"How likely are you to get [child's name] the HPV vaccine in
the next year? Would you say you . . . [definitely won't, probably
won't, probably will, definitely will]." The survey also evaluated
attitudes toward adolescent vaccines, including importance
of HPV vaccine: "I feel that the HPV vaccine for [child's name]
is . . . [not important, slightly important, moderately important, very
important, extremely important]." On demographic and household
characteristics, the survey assessed respondents' sex, age, race/

 ethnicity, education, marital status, household income, and state
of residence. It also assessed the index child's sex and age.
Physician survey. The physician survey included the six brief
motivational messages presented to parents and asked, "Which
of these statements would you use to persuade parents to get HPV
vaccine for their 11–12 year olds?" Physicians could choose as
many messages that applied or select none of these. On demo-
graphic and professional characteristics, our survey assessed
respondents' medical specialty, sex, and number of years in
practice since residency. Respondents also indicated their typical
adolescent patient volume per week and the percentage of vaccine
doses they administer that are provided by the federal Vaccines for
Children (VFC) program. On clinical practice characteristics,
respondents reported their practice type and the total number of
physicians in the clinic. Respondents also reported the state in
which their clinic is located, which we categorized these locations
into one of four U.S. census regions.
Data analysis
We calculated frequencies and percentages of respondents who
indicated that a given message would persuade them (parents) or
that they would use a given message to persuade parents (phy-
sicians) to get HPV vaccine for their child. For parent data, we used
bivariate logistic regression models to determine if message
endorsement differed by child's HPV vaccination status. Among
parents whose child was not previously vaccinated, we conducted
bivariate logistic regression models to assess whether message
endorsement differed by HPV vaccine intention. For all parents,
we used bivariate logistic regression to identify correlates of
endorsement of each motivational message. Candidate correlates
were child's HPV vaccination status, parent's intention to vacci-
nate their child, parent's race/ethnicity, parent's education level,
child's age, child's sex, and parents' perception of HPV vaccine
importance. The parent Panels A, B, and C were similar on 10 of 11
demographic variables, indicating that randomization success-
fully created largely equivalent groups; as the panels differed on
income (P ¼ 0.05), analyses controlled for income. Given that
message endorsement differed by child's vaccination status, anal-
yses also controlled for this variable. For physician data, we used
c2 tests to identify correlates of endorsement of each motivational
message. Candidate correlates were medical specialty and years in
practice. We conducted analyses using SAS Version 9.4. Statistical
tests were two-tailed with a critical alpha of 0.05.
Results
Sample characteristics
Parents. About half of parents were female (56%; Table 1). About
9% of parents were non-Hispanic black and 14% were Hispanic.
Nearly two-thirds (62%) had at least some college education.
Almost half (47%) reported an annual household income of
$75,000 or more, and the majority (84%) lived in a metropolitan
area. About one-quarter (28%) responded with regard to an 11- or
12-year-old child. About half (51%) of parents reported their
index child was male and just over half (54%) reported their child
had not received any doses of HPV vaccine.
Physicians. Just over half of respondents were pediatricians
(53%), roughly two-thirds (68%) were male, and over half
(55%) had been practicing for 20 or more years. The largest
proportion saw 10 to 24 adolescent patients weekly (45%).
Most respondents worked in private practices (85%), and about
half (51%) reported that their practice had four or fewer
physicians.
Parents' endorsement of messages
Parents' endorsement of message persuasiveness averaged 41%
(range, 9%–65%) for brief messages and 60% (range, 42%–70%)
for longer messages (Table 2). At least half of parents supported
eight of the nine longer messages and three of six brief messages.
About 18% of parents endorsed all messages they read, whereas
22% did not endorse any.
Among the brief messages, the highest proportion of parents
endorsed a message that explicitly expressed a strong recom-
mendation for HPV vaccine (B5 important cancer prevention
vaccine; 65%; Fig. 1). Many parents also supported messages
that speak directly to their role in preventing their child from
getting anal/cervical cancer through HPV vaccination (B3 pre-
vent cancer; 59%) and messages that emphasize their control
over whether their child becomes infected with HPV (B4 control
getting HPV; 58%). For the longer, CDC-developed messages,
the highest proportion of parents supported a message with
information about HPV vaccine effectiveness shown in clinical
trials and studies in the U.S. and other countries (L8 effective
vaccine; 70%; Table 2). About two-thirds of parents also
endorsed messages about the prevalence of HPV infection and
the cancers and precancerous conditions HPV vaccine protects
against (L7 HPV causes cancers; 67%), messages about vaccine
safety and an emphasis on minor, short-term side effects (L2
safe vaccine; 65%), and a longer version of the brief message in
which a physician clearly gives a strong recommendation for
HPV vaccine (L6 important cancer prevention vaccine; 65%).
HPV vaccination status. Endorsement of each of the 15 messages
was higher among parents whose children had received HPV
vaccine (all P < 0.05; Table 2). Parents whose children had not
received any doses of HPV vaccine favored five longer messages
(L2 safe vaccine, L5 HPV is common, L6 important cancer pre-
vention vaccine, L7 HPV causes cancers, and L8 effective vaccine;
53%–56%) and three short messages (B3 prevent cancer, B4
control getting HPV, and B5 important cancer prevention vaccine;
48%–49%). Few parents of unvaccinated children endorsed brief
messages B6 (5%), which uses a car seatbelt analogy, and B1
(16%), in which a physician draws on the experience of vacci-
nating his or her own child. About two-thirds (67%) of parents of
unvaccinated children supported at least one message, as did 91%
of parents whose child received �1 dose of HPV vaccine.
In an exploratory analysis, we examined sociodemographic
correlates of not endorsing any messages among parents of an
unvaccinated child. In bivariate logistic regression analyses, we
identifiedparent race and marital status as significant predictors of
not endorsing any messages. In a multivariable model containing
these two predictor variables, parents who reported black, non-
Hispanic race had lower odds of not endorsing any messages
compared with white, non-Hispanic parents [odds ratio (OR),
0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.24–0.92]. Parents who
reported they were not married had lower odds of not endorsing
any messages compared with parents who were married (OR,
0.58; 95% CI, 0.37–0.89).
HPV vaccination intentions. For 14 of the 15 messages, parents
with higher prior intentions to vaccinate were more likely to say

 the messages would be persuasive (all P < 0.001; Supplementary
Table S2; Fig. 2). Of parents who probably would not get their child
vaccinated, more than 60% endorsed three longer messages (L5
HPV is common, L7 HPV causes cancers, L8 effective vaccine;
61%–64%). About half endorsed three brief messages (B3 prevent
cancer, B4 control getting HPV, and B5 important cancer preven-
tion vaccine; 48%–51%). Of parents who definitely would not get
their child vaccinated, about one-quarter indicated three brief
messages would persuade them to vaccinate their child (B3
prevent cancer, B4 control getting HPV, and B5 important cancer
prevention vaccine; 23%–25%). Two longer messages would be
effective with about one-quarter of these parents (L5 HPV is
common and L8 effective vaccine; 23%–24%). About one-third
(33%) of parents who definitely would not get their child vaccinated
and 75% of parents who probably would not get their child vacci-
nated endorsed at least one message (Fig. 3).
Demographics. Endorsement was not associated with parent race/
ethnicity, parent education, child age, or child sex (all P > 0.05;
Supplementary Table S3).
Physicians' endorsement of messages
Physicians' endorsement of the brief messages averaged 39%;
about 4% of physicians endorsed all messages, whereas 7% did
not endorse any messages. Of the six brief messages presented to
physicians, the highest proportion of physicians endorsed B5
(important cancer prevention vaccine, 69%), closely followed by
B3 (prevent cancer, 64%; Fig. 1). The lowest proportion of
physicians (9%) reported they would use message B6 (seatbelt
analogy) to persuade parents to agree to HPV vaccine.
Compared with pediatricians, a higher proportion of family
physicians endorsed message B3 (preventcancer, 59% vs. 69%, P ¼
0.002), but a lower proportion of family physicians endorsed
messages B1 (physician vaccinates own child, 35% vs. 25%, P ¼
0.003) and B5 (importantcancerprevention vaccine,74%vs. 63%,
P < 0.001). Relative to clinicians who have been in practice for �19
years, a higher proportion of those practicing longer endorsed

redness in the arm. This should go away quickly, and HPV vaccine has
not been associated with any long-term side effects. Since 2006,
about 57 million doses of HPV vaccine have been distributed in the
United States, and in the years of HPV vaccine safety studies and

Discussion
Through our national survey of parents, we identified three
brief (B3–B5) and eight longer (L1–L3, L5–L9) messages that at
least half of parents reported would persuade them to agree to
HPV vaccination for their children. Physicians also endorsed two
of these brief messages touching on the strong belief "in the
importance of this cancer-preventing vaccine" (B5) and that the
child could get cancer asan adult "but you can stop that rightnow"
(B3). Given the importance of provider recommendation in HPV
vaccine uptake (7, 27), perhaps it is not surprising that a high
proportion of parents endorsed a straightforward and strong
recommendation for HPV vaccine. Equally high proportions of
parents endorsed the brief and longer versions of this message,
suggesting that such a recommendation need not be lengthy so
long as the physician clearly states that he or she strongly recom-
mends HPV vaccine.
Many parents also endorsed messages that included infor-
mation about vaccine safety and effectiveness (L2, L8), the
importance of vaccinating prior to sexual activity (L3), HPV

 infection being common (L5), and cancer prevention (L1, L6,
L7, L9). These messages address the primary parental barriers to
HPV vaccination, including concerns about vaccine safety, lack
of knowledge, and belief that HPV vaccine is not needed or not
necessary (7). Moreover, the messages align with communica-
tion best practices that suggest effective messages highlight HPV
vaccine's role in cancer prevention, explain risks and prevalence
of HPV infection, and provide evidence about HPV vaccine
safety (28).
These messages may be especially useful as part of a larger HPV
vaccine recommendation strategy. The survey used in the current
study informed an intervention in which we developed and led a
training that taught clinicians an HPV vaccine recommendation
strategy. As part of the strategy, we trained clinicians on an
approach for eliciting and easing parents' primary concern about
HPV vaccine, and to end with a strong recommendation. In the
context of this strategy, we foresee physicians using the messages
from the current study during these steps. These messages may be
particularly helpful once physicians have identified a focal point
for discussion by eliciting parents' primary concern about HPV
vaccine. To support their communication with parents, physicians
can use the motivational message that best addresses the parent's
specific concern. Also, physicians can use a message to end the
discussion with a strong recommendation for HPV vaccine (e.g.,
B5 important cancer prevention vaccine). Given that we did not
identify a difference in parental endorsement of messages across
demographic subgroups, physicians may be able to effectively use
these messages across demographic subgroups.
Of particular interest, some parents without prior intentions
to vaccinate their child identified messages that would be
persuasive. Two messages that were the most highly endorsed
by these parents placed the onus of protection on the parent
(B3) and emphasized the control they possess over their child's
health (B4). This finding is aligned with the tenets of various
theories of fear appeals, which posit that fear messages inspire
action if the receiver believes he or she has some control over
the situation (29). Parents without prior intentions to vacci-
nate their child may be particularly receptive to messages that
arouse fear while fostering a sense of efficacy. Our findings
offer promise for appealing to parents with a range of prior
intentions to vaccinate.
Concordance between parents' and physicians' perceptions of
the brief messages was fairly high. One exception was message B4
(control getting HPV), where many parents (58%) reported the
message was persuasive, yet only 37% of physicians would use
this message to persuade parents. It is especially concerning that
so few physicians would use this message given that it was one of
the top messages that would persuade parents without prior
intentions to vaccinate their child. It is unclear whether physicians
were not amenable to using this message because they personally
do not believe in its content, or because they do not think the
message would motivate parents.
We also identified some differences in message endorsement by
physician specialty and length of time in practice. Pediatricians
typically are stronger proponents of vaccination compared with
other physician specialties, including family physicians (30, 31).
Thus, it may be unsurprising that pediatricians preferred messages
B1 (physician vaccinates own child) and B5 (important cancer
prevention vaccine), both of which reflected personal endorse-
ment and experience, whereas family physicians preferred mes-
sage B3 (prevent cancer), which does not use language that reflects
their personal beliefs. Given that so many parents reported
message B5 (important cancer prevention vaccine) would per-
suade them to pursue HPV vaccination, it would be worthwhile to
encourage family physicians to use this message or further explore
their hesitancy to use it. Using this message could be easily
incorporated into routine clinical practice and included in train-
ing materials targeted to helping family physicians make effective
HPV vaccine recommendations.
To facilitate comprehension, experts recommend that health
information be written at a sixth-grade or lower reading level (32,
33). We found that the brief messages were generally around this

 recommended grade level, whereas the longer messages were
around four grades above the recommended level. CDC has
since disseminated a new set of messages for physicians to use
to address parents' questions about HPV vaccine that are
somewhat shorter than the previous CDC messages but still
lengthy (38 vs. 52 words; ref. 34). Grade level of the new
messages remained high and unchanged at around tenth grade.
Given that the messages are designed for physicians to deliver
to parents orally, it is worthwhile for future research to explore
parents' comprehension of the messages when spoken by a
physician. Also of note, the highest proportion of parents
endorsed the brief statement (B5 important cancer prevention
vaccine) with the highest reading grade level (10), and over half
of parents endorsed most of the longer statements, with grade
levels ranging from 7 to 12. Future research also is needed to
understand the trade-offs between message reading grade level,
persuasiveness, message length, and ability for providers and
patients to remember the messages.
Study strengths include data from large, national samples of
parents, and primary care physicians, including physicians who
practice in specialties that deliver the majority of HPV vaccine
doses in the U.S. (10). To our knowledge, our study is among the
first to evaluate the messages developed and disseminated by the
CDC. Study weaknesses include that we achieved a modest
cooperation rate for the physician survey, which is a common
challenge for physician surveys (35). The study relied on parents'
and physicians' self-report in response to hypothetical scenarios;
thus, we were unable to account for clinical context or other
factors that may affect physicians' use of and parents' receptivity to
the messages. For instance, physicians' nonverbal cues may influ-
ence parents' perceptions of message persuasiveness. Also, it is
possible that physicians will modify the messages rather than say
them verbatim; these modifications may enhance or undermine
the messages' persuasiveness. Moreover, we did not clarify with
parents whether they were motivated by the message in its entirety
or if there was a specific component of the message that was
particularly stimulating. These limitations highlight that this
research should be augmented with future studies that further
test these messages. Future research also should extend this work
by examining whether these messages lead to HPV vaccine uptake.
Furthermore, future work should distinguish between messages
designed to address parent concerns and messages intended to
direct parents to vaccinate.
Conclusion
Our national study of parents and physicians identified mes-
sages perceived as persuasive for motivating HPV vaccination,
even among parents disinclined to vaccinate their children. The
lack of difference across demographic subgroups in parental
endorsement of messages may suggest that these messages can
be used across demographic subgroups, and warrants further
investigation. Our findings provide physicians with evidence
that using these messages may help them to communicate
effectively with parents about this important cancer-preventing
vaccine.
