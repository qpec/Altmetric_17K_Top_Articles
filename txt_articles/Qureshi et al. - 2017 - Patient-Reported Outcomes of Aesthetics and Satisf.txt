Abstract
Background: Direct-to-implant (DTI) and tissue expander/implant (TE/I) reconstructions are the most common implant-based reconstructions after 
nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM). However, there are little data beyond complication rates comparing these options. Fat grafting has emerged as an 
adjunct in NSM reconstructions to improve aesthetic results; however, its impact on patient perceptions of aesthetic outcomes remain unknown. To 
improve patient-centered care, aesthetic outcomes must be considered from the patients’ perspective.
Objectives: To evaluate patient-reported outcomes of aesthetic satisfaction and quality of life in patients undergoing immediate DTI vs TE/I recon-
struction after NSM and to assess the role of fat grafting on these outcomes.
Methods: This is a prospective cohort study comparing NSM patients undergoing DTI or TE/I reconstruction. Patient-reported outcomes were evalu-
ated using the BREAST-Q. Continuous and categorical variables were analyzed using t test and Fisher’s exact test, respectively.
Results: Fifty-nine patients underwent 113 reconstructions with either DTI (n = 41) or TE/I (n = 18). Mean follow up was 12.1 months. DTI and TE/I 
patients had comparable satisfaction with outcome, though TE/I patients had significantly larger final implant sizes. TE/I who underwent fat grafting also 
had significantly higher satisfaction with outcome and psychosocial wellbeing.
Conclusions: Patient-reported outcomes are comparable between DTI and TE/I reconstructions after NSM. In order for TE/I patients to achieve a 
similar level of satisfaction, they may require a larger final implant and additional operations compared to DTI patients. Additionally, fat grafting improves 
overall satisfaction. TE/I patients may have different aesthetic expectations than DTI patients, emphasizing patient-centered discussions are essential to 
optimizing outcomes after NSM.

Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) is an oncologically safe 
option for the treatment of breast cancer in appropriately 
selected patients.1,2 For patients undergoing postmastec-
tomy breast reconstruction, preservation of the nipple-areola 
complex with NSM is associated with higher psychosocial 
and sexual well-being, as well as more favorable aesthetic 
outcomes, compared to skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM) 
with nipple reconstruction.1,3-5 Over the last several years,

NSM has increased in popularity as both a surgical treat-
ment for breast cancer and a surgical treatment for the 
prevention of breast cancer (for patients undergoing contra-
lateral or bilateral prophylactic mastectomy).5-9 NSM with 
breast reconstruction is performed as an aesthetic breast 
reconstruction with the knowledge that nipple sensation 
or function is not likely to be preserved.3,5,10 Therefore, it 
could be argued that the main benefit of NSM over other 
mastectomy techniques is the aesthetic outcome.
Prosthetic breast reconstruction remains the predominant 
reconstructive method following mastectomy and prosthetic 
reconstruction after NSM can be performed either in a sin-
gle-stage direct-to-implant (DTI) reconstruction or 2-stage 
reconstruction with a tissue expander followed by exchange 
for a permanent implant prosthesis (TE/I). Proponents of 
DTI reconstruction emphasize the “breast in a day” concept 
of a single-stage operation; however, recent studies have 
demonstrated the average number of operations in DTI 
reconstruction to often be greater than one.11 TE/I breast 
reconstruction will require more planned operations than 
DTI breast reconstruction because it is a 2-stage, 2-opera-
tion procedure by definition. However, in our experience, 
patients who experience complications in TE/I reconstruc-
tion after SSM are likely to require more than 2 operations.12 
With the advent of fat grafting, even patients without com-
plications after SSM are likely to have additional procedures 
as fat grafting is frequently used as an adjunct procedure to 
improve the aesthetic result in breast reconstruction.13 More 
operations increases the recovery time and healing pro-
cess for breast cancer patients, but whether more surgery 
translates to inferior patient-reported outcomes remains 
unknown. Patients may be willing to undergo more surgery 
if it leads to a better aesthetic outcome.
Beyond complication profiles, there are limited data com-
paring DTI and TE/I breast reconstruction after NSM from the 
patient’s perspective using patient-reported outcomes.11,14,15 
Furthermore, the impact of fat grafting on patient-reported 
aesthetic outcomes in implant-based reconstructions after 
NSM remains unknown. Increasingly, patient-reported out-
comes in aesthetic and reconstructive surgery are being 
used as a way to more clearly depict patients’ satisfaction 
and health-related quality of life.16-18 Information about 
patients’ perceptions of aesthetic outcome and satisfaction 
is integral to promote patient-centered care in breast recon-
struction and enable patients to make informed decisions 
between reconstruction types after NSM.
The objective of this study was to evaluate outcomes in 
patients undergoing immediate breast reconstruction after 
NSM using implants and fat grafting, with a specific focus 
on patient-reported outcomes of aesthetic satisfaction 
and health-related quality of life. We hypothesized that 
patient-reported outcomes, including overall satisfaction 
with outcome, would be higher in DTI breast reconstruction 
compared to TE/I breast reconstruction because patients 
would require fewer operations. We also hypothesized that 
patients who had fat grafting as an adjunct procedure to 
improve the aesthetic appearance of a reconstructed breast 
would have higher satisfaction and health-related quality 
of life on a validated patient-reported outcome instrument 
(the BREAST-Q).
METHODS
Study Population
This study is a retrospective analysis of patients pro-
spectively enrolled into a study to assess perfusion and 
patient satisfaction in NSM (NCT01969448: Study to 
Assess Perfusion and Patient Satisfaction in Nipple-Areola 
Mastectomy with Immediate Reconstruction). Patients 
were treated at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center and 
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis from 
August 2013 to July 2016. A separate institutional review 
board approval (201608129) was obtained for this cohort 
study. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from 
hospital and clinical records. Two-physician review con-
firmed the fidelity of data. Patients who underwent DTI 
reconstruction were compared to those who underwent 
TE/I reconstruction. All patients had minimum of 6 months 
follow up from the time of permanent implant placement.
All patients in this study underwent NSM for either 
breast cancer treatment or prophylaxis. Patients were 
eligible for inclusion if they were age 18 or older, had a 
Karnofsky Performance Scale of >80%, were able to pro-
vide informed consent, and had either DTI or TE/I recon-
struction following NSM.19 All patients were treated by 2 
oncologic surgeons (independent of the study) with expe-
rience in NSM techniques and 2 senior plastic surgeons 
(T.M.M. and M.M.T.) with experience in both DTI and 
TI/E reconstruction. Patients with concomitant autologous 
reconstruction were excluded from this analysis. Patients 
with breast weight greater than 800 grams or less than 
100 grams in predicted weight were also excluded from 
this study. The decision to have either DTI or TE/I breast 
reconstruction was made by the plastic surgeon based on 
patient preference, skin flap perfusion and redundancy, 
and desired volume goals. Patients who were undecided 
about their volume goals or wanted to have the option to 
be larger than their existing breast size were essentially 
planned TE/I reconstructions. TE/I were also used in 
patients who had ptotic breasts and the surgeon wanted 
to allow the skin to retract to the size of a smaller device. 
Conversely, in young women with a tight skin envelope, 
TE/I were used to expand the skin to allow for a simi-
lar or larger size permanent implant. DTI reconstructions 
were performed in patients who knew preoperatively they 
wanted to maintain their breast size. If there were concerns 
about mastectomy flap viability based on intraoperative

assessment, a TE/I may have been placed or a smaller per-
manent implant for a DTI reconstruction. There was little 
deviation from the plastic surgeon and patient’s preopera-
tive plan for DTI vs TE/I, though all patients desiring DTI 
reconstruction also provided informed consent for TE/I 
reconstruction.
All tissue expanders were textured Allergan (Allergan, 
Inc., Dublin, Ireland) 133MV devices. Implants were either 
Allergan or Sientra (Sientra, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA) devices 
and included anatomic and round, smooth, and textured 
implants as these were on consignment at our institution. 
Implants were all placed in a partial subpectoral plane with 
the use of acellular dermal matrix (Alloderm RTU, LifeCell 
Corp., Branchburg, NJ) using nonperforated 8 × 16 cm or 
10 × 20 cm sheets for lower pole coverage. Incisions for 
NSM were either inframammary or lateral radial incisions, 
and assessment of perfusion and incision placement is an 
objective of NCT01969448 in which all patients in this study 
are enrolled. Implant choice was based on discussions 
between patient and surgeon. Fat harvest was performed 
using the “super wet” technique with lactated ringers with 
15 mL of 1% lidocaine, 1 ampule of 1:1000 epinephrine per 
liter, and tissue liquefaction technology (TLT; Hydrasolve 
Lipoplasty System, Andrew Technologies, Irvine, CA). We 
have previously reported our technique for TLT.20 The fat 
grafting donor site was based on physical exam and in all 
cases was either the abdomen or flank area. Harvested fat 
was separated using gravity filtration in large sterilized can-
isters with no centrifugation and injected in 1 cc aliquots 
into areas of contour irregularity in the superomedial or 
lateral axillary tail areas.
Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated using the 
BREAST-Q, a validated instrument specific to breast recon-
struction that is designed to measure health-related qual-
ity of life and patient satisfaction.21 Patients completed the 
preoperative (baseline) BREAST-Q Reconstruction mod-
ule and a postreconstruction BREAST-Q at 3 months after 
placement of a permanent implant as a part of the study. 
All questionnaires were completed electronically using 
research electronic data capture (REDCap) software. There 
are different domains including in the BREAST-Q; in this 
study, patients completed the Satisfaction with Outcome, 
Satisfaction with Breasts, Psychological Well-Being, 
Physical Well-Being, and Sexual Well-Being domains.21,22 
The primary endpoints were patient-reported outcomes as 
measured by the BREAST-Q Reconstruction modules. All 
BREAST-Q scores are calculated using the Q-Score software 
program (New York, NY), and transformed on a scale from 
0 to 100; higher scores correlate with better outcomes.21 
We also examined the total number of operative procedures 
in DTI and TE/I reconstructions, incidence of fat grafting, 
and volume of fat grafted. Complications were defined as 
postoperative adverse events requiring an operative inter-
vention and these were assessed from the medical record.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics in each group (DTI and TE/I) 
were compared using a two-tailed t test for continuous 
variables, and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. 
Continuous variables are reported as mean ± standard 
deviation (SD), and categorical variables as a raw num-
ber (per cent). A P-value of <0.05 was used to determine 
significance. BREAST-Q scores were calculated using the 
Q-Score software program, and raw differences in preop-
erative and postoperative scores were reported and com-
pared between groups. All statistical tests were performed 
using SAS 9.4 software system (Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The study population comprised of 59 patients undergoing 
113 NSM procedures with immediate breast reconstruction. 
Patients in this study had a mean age of 44 ± 11 years (DTI, 
43 ± 10 years; TE/I, 47 ± 12 years; P = 0.21) and a mean 
body mass index of 23.5 ± 3.3 kg/m2 (DTI, 23.4 ± 3.2; TE/I, 
23.7 ± 3.7; P = 0.71). Of these, 59 patients, 41 (69.5%) 
had DTI reconstruction (Supplementary Figure 1) and 18 
(30.5%) had TE/I reconstruction (Supplementary Figure 2). 
The mean follow up for all patients was 15.2 ± 8.4 months 
(range, 6.1-35.9 months) for the study population with 
no difference in follow-up time between study groups 
(DTI, 14.7 ± 8.3 months; range, 6.1-31 months; TE/I, 
16.5 ± 8.8 months; range, 6.8-35.9 months; P = 0.49). All 
patients with fat grafting had at least 6 months follow up 
from the time of their fat grafting. Among patients, 93.2% 
had a permanent anatomic implant while 6.8% had a per-
manent round implant placed. No patients in the present 
study were diabetic or active smokers.
Bilateral procedures were performed in 90.2% of DTI and 
94.4% of TE/I reconstructions, respectively (P = 1.00). In 
regards to operative indication, 43.9% of DTI reconstruc-
tions were for patients who had prophylactic NSM for cancer 
prevention while only 11.1% of TE/I patients had bilateral 
NSM for prophylaxis (P = 0.01). None of the TE/I patients 
had bilateral cancers. Two TE/I patients had bilateral pro-
cedures for prophylaxis while the remainder had a unilat-
eral cancer and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy with 
TE/I reconstruction. Only one patient had a mastectomy 
for cancer but did not have a contralateral prophylactic 
mastectomy. Three DTI patients and one TE/I patient had 
adjuvant radiation therapy (P = 1.00). One TE/I patient 
had neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Mastectomy specimen 
weights did not differ between groups (DTI = 371 ± 166 g 
vs TE/I = 342 ± 145 g, P = 0.49). Initial fill of the implant 
at the time of mastectomy and final implant size were 
different between groups (Table 1). Fill volumes were

significantly lower in the TE/I group when compared to the 
average permanent implant in the DTI group (P < 0.001), 
but TE/I reconstructions permanent implants were eventu-
ally larger (540 cc vs 454 cc in the DTI group, P < 0.005).
DTI vs TE/I Reconstruction Outcomes and 
Fat Grafting
The mean number of operative procedures was signif-
icantly different between the study cohorts: DTI patients 
had 1.3 ± 0.5 operative procedures while TE/I patients 
had 2.3 ± 0.6 operative procedures (P < 0.001). Fat graft-
ing was performed in 24.4% of DTI (Figure 1) and 55.6% 
of TE/I reconstructions (Figure 2) (P = 0.04). Patients, on 
average, had 1.0 and 1.1 ± 0.31 rounds of fat grafting in the 
DTI and TE/I groups, respectively (P = 0.34). The average 
volume of fat grafted was 104 ± 35 cc and 73 ± 35 cc for 
DTI and TE/I reconstructions, respectively (P = 0.06).
There were 2 major complications requiring operative 
intervention and both occurred in the DTI group, result-
ing in an overall complication rate of 3.39% and a com-
plication rate of 4.88% in the DTI group. Indications for 
reoperation were for a hematoma and an implant infection 
requiring an explant.
Patient-Reported Outcomes for DTI vs 
TE/I Reconstruction
When comparing BREAST-Q Reconstruction scores between 
DTI (n = 28) and TE/I patients who did not have fat graft-
ing (n = 6), patients with DTI reconstructions, on average, 
had higher satisfaction with breasts, psychosocial well-being, 
physical well-being, and sexual well-being, though this did 
not reach statistical significance (Table 2). Taken together, 
DTI patients had a higher satisfaction with outcome than TE/I 
reconstructions (80 ± 19 vs 66 ± 12, P = 0.09, Table 2).
When 
comparing 
numerical 
average 
differences 
between DTI and TE/I patients, the change in satisfaction 
with breasts were higher for DTI patients (17 ± 19) than 
TE/I patients (−2 ± 30), however this was not significant 
(P = 0.05). Changes in psychological well-being were sim-
ilar (13 ± 23 vs 4 ± 22, P = 0.44) for DTI and TE/I recon-
struction, respectively. Physical well-being decreased more 
in DTI (−6 ± 16) than TE/I patients (−2 ± 23), though 
this was not significant (P = 0.61). Change in sexual 
well-being was higher in DTI (13 ± 18) than TE/I patients 
(−4 ± −34) and was not significantly different (P = 0.27)
The magnitude of changes in satisfaction with breasts, 
psychosocial well-being, physical well-being, and sexual 
well-being were all greater in the DTI cohort and must 
be interpreted to a clinically meaningful endpoint. The 
BREAST-Q Score Manual classifies changes of 0 to 10 as 
“little,” 10 to 20 as “moderate,” and greater than 20 as 
“very much.”23 Based on this interpretation, patients with 
DTI reconstructions had moderate changes in their satis-
faction with breasts, psychological well-being, and sexual 
well-being while patients with TE/I implant reconstruction 
had little changes in these domains. Both TE/I and DTI 
groups had little changes in physical well-being.
Patient-Reported Outcomes With Fat 
Grafting
Because DTI patients who underwent fat grafting did 
so after the 3-month time point at which the postrecon-
struction BREAST-Q was administered, we were unable 
to compare patient-reported outcomes by reconstruction 
type after fat grafting was performed. However, because 
all patients in the TE/I group had fat grafting at the time 
of permanent implant exchange, we were able to com-
pare patient-reported outcomes of TE/I patients who did

(n = 9) and did not have fat grafting (n = 6). Patients 
who had TE/I breast reconstruction with fat grafting had 
significantly higher satisfaction with outcomes (87 ± 17) 
compared to patients undergoing TE/I reconstruction 
without fat grafting (66 ± 12, P = 0.02, Table 3).
Patients who had TE/I reconstruction had similar prere-
construction satisfaction with breast scores regardless if they 
went on to have fat grafting (TE/I with fat grafting 65 ± 24 
vs TE/I without fat grafting 59 ± 16, P = 0.59). Patients 
who went on to have fat grafting had lower psychological 
well-being preoperatively than those who did not have fat 
grafting (63 ± 17 vs 73 ± 12, P = 0.33). Interestingly, 
patients who would later have fat grafting also had higher 
physical well-being scores (91 ± 9 vs 81 ± 13, P = 0.1). 
Sexual well-being was higher in patients who would not go 
on to have fat grafting (66 ± 19) vs those who did have fat 
grafting (52 ± 12), though this was not significantly differ-
ent (P = 0.1). These differences are clinically significant 
per the BREAST-Q scale, while not statistically significant.
When comparing mean differences between TE/I with 
fat grafting to TE/I without fat grafting, the satisfaction 
with breast scores decreased more in patients undergoing 
TE/I reconstructions with fat grafting (−3 ± 31) than those 
patients undergoing TE/I reconstructions without fat graft-
ing (−2 ± 31); however this was not significant (P = 0.94). 
Psychological well-being increased more in TE/I reconstruc-
tion with fat grafting than without fat grafting (16 ± 16 vs 
5 ± 19, P = 0.21). Physical well-being decreased more in 
TE/I with fat grafting group (−7 ± 15) than the without fat 
grafting group (−2 ± 25), though this was not significant 
(P = 0.68). Additionally, sexual well-being increased more 
in patients who had fat grafting (7 ± 30) than those who 
did not have fat grafting (−4 ± 34, P = 0.52).
When interpreting these changes in the setting of clini-
cally meaningful endpoints, patients who had fat grafting 
with TE/I reconstruction had moderate changes in psycho-
logical well-being from their reconstructions while those 
without fat grafting only had little change. Little change 
occurred in satisfaction with breasts, physical well-be-
ing, and sexual well-being in patients who either had 
fat grafting or did not have fat grafting after TE/I breast 
reconstruction.

DISCUSSION
Immediate implant-based reconstruction after nipple-spar-
ing mastectomy is a popular option for postmastectomy 
breast reconstruction because it is an aesthetic breast 
reconstruction that preserves the nipple-areola complex 
and native skin envelope.4,14,24 Direct-to-implant recon-
struction and tissue expander placement followed by 
exchange for a permanent implant prosthesis are the most 
common implant-based techniques. However, to date, there 
is minimal data comparing DTI vs TE/I reconstruction after 
NSM from the patient’s perspective. Prior studies have 
almost exclusively focused on complication rates associ-
ated with these 2 options and did not examine patient-re-
ported outcomes.11,14,15 To our knowledge, this is the first 
study to compare patient-reported outcomes using a val-
idated instrument, the BREAST-Q, for DTI vs TE/I recon-
struction after NSM. The BREAST-Q includes domains 
related to aesthetic outcomes, specifically the satisfaction 
with breasts domain considers satisfaction with the overall

breast appearance (size, symmetry, softness, implant place-
ment, and cleavage) and scar appearance.21 We therefore 
used the BREAST-Q as a tool to study patients’ perceptions 
of the aesthetic outcome and satisfaction with immediate 
reconstruction after NSM with different implant-based 
techniques and with autologous fat grafting.
Though satisfaction with outcome was higher in DTI 
patients, it was not significantly different from TE/I patients, 
indicating that patients have similar overall satisfaction with 
either implant-based technique following NSM. Our analy-
sis did not find a statistically significant difference between 
the DTI vs TE/I groups in the numerical BREAST-Q scores 
of psychological well-being, physical well-being, and sex-
ual well-being; however, we observed a greater, but not sta-
tistically significant, improvement in the satisfaction with 
breasts domain in DTI reconstructions. BREAST-Q scores 
should be interpreted with clinically relevant meaning as 
plastic surgeons need to translate patient-reported out-
come measures to meaningful conclusions regarding the 
reconstructive options provided to patients. In this study, 
patients who had DTI reconstructions had clinically sig-
nificant, moderate improvements in their satisfaction with 
breasts, psychological well-being, and sexual well-being. 
TE/I reconstruction patients only had little changes in these 
domains. Both groups had little changes in physical well-be-
ing suggesting the morbidity of subpectoral permanent 
implant placement is no different than placement of a tissue 
expander and subsequent expansion.
Patients in our study who had TE/I reconstructions 
had a larger final implant placed at the time of implant 
exchange, despite the fact that mastectomy specimen 
weights did not differ by study group. This suggests that 
TE/I reconstruction may afford an opportunity for the 
patient and physician to “augment” the breast and expand 
the breast envelope to a size larger than the patient was 
before mastectomy or may be able to achieve with a DTI 
reconstruction. On average, the final implant in a TE/I 
reconstruction was 20% larger than those used in DTI 
reconstructions. From clinical experience it is known that 
the skin envelope and perfusion can limit the size of the 
implant that can be placed. Interestingly, despite having 
larger permanent implants, patients with TE/I reconstruc-
tion had a lower satisfaction with outcome, though this 
was not statistically significant, and little changes in all 
BREAST-Q domains suggesting that final implant size 
may not necessarily predict higher patient satisfaction in 
breast reconstruction. This parallels data from the breast 
augmentation literature demonstrating implant volume is 
not associated with higher postoperative satisfaction with 
breasts.25 Though patient-reported outcomes were compa-
rable in this study between the 2 cohorts, patients under-
going TE/I reconstruction may have different expectations 
and may require a larger, “augmented” breast to achieve 
similar satisfaction with the aesthetic outcome.
One hypothesized advantage to DTI reconstruction is 
the need for fewer overall operations. This is especially true 
after NSM as preservation of the nipple-areola complex, 
while doing little to preserve nipple sensitivity, avoids the 
need for further operations to reconstruct the nipple.4,24 
By definition, TE/I reconstruction is at least a 2-stage, two 
operation reconstruction following a skin-sparing or nip-
ple-sparing mastectomy, and the outcome pathways can 
change if complications occur.12 Alternatively, DTI recon-
struction is appealing for being a single-stage or “breast 
in a day” immediate reconstruction.11 In our study, over a 
quarter of DTI and over half of TE/I reconstruction patients 
had autologous fat grafting to improve the overall aesthetic 
outcome. While both anatomic and round implants were 
used, fat grafting was used as a way to improve super-
omedial fullness and improve the transitions in contour 
between chest wall and implant to create a more natural, 
aesthetic contour to the breast. In our experience, TE/I 
reconstruction patients were more likely to undergo fat 
grafting than DTI patients, a finding that was statistically 
significant. It is possible that TE/I patients had higher aes-
thetic demands and expectations, wanted a larger implant, 
and/or also expected a more natural appearing breast than 
DTI patients who may have wanted a more simple, sin-
gle operation reconstruction. There also may be a lower 
threshold to fat graft TE/I patients at the time of implant 
exchange because these patients are already committed 
to a second operation for tissue expander exchange for a 
permanent implant. In our experience, however, fat graft-
ing was done in DTI or TE/I reconstructions only if it was 
felt to improve the aesthetic outcome and correct contour 
irregularities that were bothersome to the patient. Though 
our follow-up time does not differ between DTI and TE/I 
patients, it is possible that DTI patients who during the 
study period did not undergo fat grafting may eventually 
go on to have fat grafting because of changes in con-
tour or aging of the breast, Longitudinal studies of these 
groups will be better able to examine the reconstructive 
pathways of DTI and TE/I patients. Additionally, our num-
ber of operations closely matches published data on DTI

reconstruction after NSM.11 As expected, TE/I reconstruc-
tion required exactly one more operation on average than 
DTI reconstruction. TE/I patients may have been more 
willing to undergo a longer reconstructive journey for the 
option of a larger final implant; however, our existing data 
do not allow us to explore specific patient reasons for deci-
sion-making or patient expectations and this should be a 
focus of future studies on the topic.
Patients who had fat grafting, on average, had a sin-
gle round of fat grafting with average volumes that were 
not significantly different in DTI vs TE/I reconstructions. 
In TE/I patients, this was done at the time of permanent 
implant exchange. While there are concerns about the lon-
gevity of fat grafting and need for multiple rounds of fat 
grafting, our study did not find that one reconstruction 
required more rounds of fat grafting than the other. Our 
conclusions about longevity of fat grafting are limited to 
the fact that all patients who had fat grafting could have 
had as little as 6 months follow up after fat grafting; how-
ever, patients on average were followed for 15 months in 
this study. When looking at our overall cohort, a single 
round of fat grafting either at the time of implant exchange 
in TE/I reconstruction or as a separate adjunct procedure 
for DTI patients sufficed. Further studies specifically look-
ing at the longevity of fat grafting in nipple sparing mas-
tectomies are warranted. The use of fat grafting for select 
patients in implant-based reconstruction after NSM paral-
lels the experience for select patients undergoing breast 
augmentation, where the lack of adequate breast tissue to 
cover an implant in augmentation is compensated with fat 
grafting.26,27 Fat grafting in our cohort differs from compos-
ite breast augmentation in that no fat grafting was done in 
DTI patients at the time of implant placement.
In order to examine the effects of fat grafting on 
patient-reported outcomes and perceptions of aesthetic 
outcome, our analysis was limited to TE/I patients only 
as the BREAST-Q was administered at the 3-month post-
permanent implant placement time point and patients 
with DTI reconstruction typically had fat grafting after this 
time point. Our analysis of the impact of fat grafting in 
NSM reconstruction is therefore limited to patients who 
had TE/I reconstruction. Patients with TE/I reconstruction 
who had fat grafting had a statistically significant greater 
satisfaction with their outcome. They also experienced 
moderate increases in their psychological well-being. The 
improvement in psychological well-being may be attribut-
able to fat harvested from an area of extra adiposity, result-
ing in a combined benefit from the fat grafting with regards 
to body contour and improvement in breast appearance. 
This would parallel possible perceived improvements 
in body image in patients who have autologous breast 
reconstruction with abdominal tissue and subsequently 
have improved abdominal contour in addition to a recon-
structed breast.28,29
While the strengths of our study include the prospective 
design and emphasis on patient-reported outcomes, our 
study does have some limitations that merit discussion. For 
one, our data does not allow us to analyze patients’ motiva-
tions to undergo DTI vs TE/I breast reconstruction, poten-
tially representing a selection bias. The decision on which 
type of implant-based reconstruction to have is made by 
the patient after discussing all potential options with their 
surgeon, as is standard practice at most centers. To date, 
there are limited data to help patients and physicians 
decide between reconstructive options following NSM. 
While 43.9% of DTI patients had prophylactic surgery, only 
11% of TE/I had prophylactic surgery. While this differ-
ence is significant, we did not favor TE/I reconstruction in 
patients with cancer for oncologic reasons, such as possible 
need for radiation as radiation exposure did not differ by 
reconstruction type in our study. Our study does not spe-
cifically examine differences in the psychological profile of 
patients with cancer vs those who undergo reconstruction 
for prophylaxis in nipple sparing mastectomies, though this 
has been explored elsewhere in a limited fashion.33,34
In our experience, the decision on reconstruction 
type must be made taking into account numerous fac-
tors, including a patients’ anatomy and ideal breast size, 
patients’ goals, willingness to have a prosthetic reconstruc-
tion, and understanding of possibly requiring more than 
one operation. It can also be impacted by intraoperative 
factors such as perfusion to the mastectomy flaps. If there 
was concern about mastectomy flap viability, which could 
include a more aggressive mastectomy on a cancerous 
breast, a TE/I could be placed unless the patient was will-
ing to have a smaller breast and desired a DTI reconstruc-
tion. Ptotic breasts may have more skin to perfuse and 
therefore may need an expander because the mastectomy 
flaps may not be adequately perfused for a permanent 
implant. However, ptotic breasts also translate to a more 
lax skin envelope, which would mean the breast oncologic 
surgeon might have an easier time performing the mastec-
tomy with less traction injury from retractors.
Our experience suggests that DTI and TE/I are indeed 
different sets of patients with different anatomy and 
aesthetic expectations, which can be elucidated preop-
eratively. This information and an understanding of expec-
tations is useful to the plastic surgeon who must also 
consider intraoperative factors that can only be known 
once the mastectomy is complete. In our experience, there 
was rare deviation from preoperative plans discussed with 
patients after understanding their anatomy and aesthetic 
expectations to perform a DTI or TE/I reconstruction.
Our evaluation of patient-reported outcomes are limited 
to the 3-month postoperative period. While this is stan-
dard for most studies evaluating patient-reported outcomes 
using the BREAST-Q, there are data to suggest health-re-
lated quality of life and satisfaction evolves over time.30-32

Additional studies evaluating long-term patient-reported 
outcomes with different implant-based techniques are 
necessary to characterize changes in satisfaction over 
time. An additional limitation is that we were unable to 
directly compare patient-reported outcomes after fat graft-
ing between the DTI cohort and the TE/I cohort. Further 
studies that directly compare DTI reconstruction with and 
without fat grafting and DTI reconstruction with fat graft-
ing to TE/I reconstruction with fat grafting can further 
examine the impact of reconstruction type and fat graft-
ing on health-related quality of life and satisfaction out-
comes. Implant choice was not standardized in the study 
as implants were chosen after discussing risks, benefits, 
and alteratives of different implants available on consign-
ment at our institution. Finally, our study, by design, did 
not include surgeon appraisal of aesthetic outcome, but 
rather focused on patients’ perceptions of outcomes.
This study expands on the current literature to provide 
data on patient-reported outcomes for the 2 most common 
types of implant-based breast reconstruction techniques after 
NSM. Our study is the first of its kind to evaluate patient-re-
ported outcomes specifically in DTI and TE/I reconstructions 
following NSM and furthers the ability of providers to engage 
in patient-centered care discussions about breast reconstruc-
tion. It also provides a better understanding of differences in 
the aesthetic expectations of DTI and TE/I patients.
CONCLUSIONS
Immediate breast reconstruction with DTI or TE/I tech-
niques after NSM is truly an aesthetic breast reconstruc-
tion. While there is a trend towards higher patient-reported 
outcomes in DTI reconstruction, TE/I patients may be will-
ing to undergo more surgeries for a larger, “augmented” 
breast at the time of implant exchange. These patients 
may have different aesthetic expectations for their recon-
structed breast than DTI patients. Fat grafting in patients 
who have TE/I reconstruction have significantly higher 
satisfaction with outcome suggesting fat grafting can be 
used to improve the patients’ satisfaction with the aes-
thetic outcome of a reconstructed breast after NSM.
