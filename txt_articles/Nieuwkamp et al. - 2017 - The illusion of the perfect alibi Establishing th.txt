Abstract
The present study was designed to establish the base rate of alibis
and supportive evidence for alibis of non‐offenders. That is impor-
tant because the presence and lack of an alibi are often seen as a
clear indicator of innocence and guilt, respectively, of a suspect. A
large sample of laypersons (N = 841) was randomly assigned to
one of 32 conditions in which they were asked to generate a true
alibi after they were falsely accused of being the perpetrator of a
mock robbery. Each condition consisted of either a Tuesday or a
Saturday and one of 16 timeframes. In general, the majority of the
participants had an alibi (99.5%) and supportive evidence for their
alibis (92.4%). The supportive evidence often consisted of a combi-
nation of supportive evidence rather than one distinct form of sup-
portive evidence (33.3%). Although it is widely assumed that the
alibi believability is determined based on the strength of the sup-
portive evidence, our results show that the type of evidence that
can be presented by laypeople depends upon the day and the
timeframe wherein the crime has been committed. The results of
the study therefore imply that determining alibi believability solely
on the strength of the supportive evidence is not a fair measure.
We suggest that the believability should also be based on the base
rate of alibis and its supportive evidence.

INTRODUCTION
Over the years, multiple people have been wrongfully convicted all over the world (e.g., Saks & Koehler, 2005) of
which some had an alibi for the moment that the crime was committed to prove their innocence but were not believed

 (Burke & Marion, 2012; Burke, Turtle, & Olson, 2007; Dahl & Price, 2012; Simon, 2012). In the criminal justice system,
there appears to be an assumption that innocent people can generate an accurate and believable alibi (Olson &
Charman, 2012), which means that the alibi should be correct and be supported by strong evidence. For an innocent
person, it can, however, be very difficult to provide such strong evidence as also appears in the cases of wrongfully
convicted people where convincing evidence is often lacking (Marion, Kukucka, Collins, Kassin, & Burke, 2015). If
people were not at the crime scene but elsewhere and they can remember where they were at that time and evidence
to support their alibis, it is perhaps the best chance to prove their innocence.
The fact that the alibis of wrongful convicted people were not believed can be explained by the skeptical attitude
of police detectives towards suspects in general (e.g., Kassin, Goldstein, & Savitsky, 2003; Meissner & Kassin, 2002;
Vrij, 2008) and to their alibis in particular (Dysart & Strange, 2012). If a suspect, for example, changes his alibi, about
80% of the police detectives believe that the suspect lied about the initial alibi and that it is easy for a suspect to
fabricate a false alibi (Dysart & Strange, 2012). According to the police detectives, an alibi should be mentioned at
the beginning of the criminal investigation, supported by strong evidence, and remains consistent over time, to be
believable (Dysart & Strange, 2012).
Theskepticalattitude towardsalibisdoes notonlyappearfromwrongfulconvictionscasesbut alsoappearsfromthe
results of alibi research. The results from research show that without strong evidence (mock), jurors find the alibi not
believable. When evidence is presented, the strength of the evidence is important because the stronger the evidence,
the more believable the alibi becomes (e.g., Hosch, Culhane, Jolly, Chavez, & Shaw, 2011; Jung, Allison, & Bohn, 2013).
Research on alibi evidence and research on alibi believability were boosted by the introduction of alibi taxonomy
by Olson and Wells (2004). With the taxonomy, the strength of the supportive evidence can be evaluated. The
supportive evidence in the taxonomy consists of only witness evidence, only physical evidence, or a combination of
both (Culhane et al., 2013; Fawcett, 2015).
From alibi research, we also know that the impact on alibi believability of physical evidence is larger than of
witness evidence. Even the weakest form of physical evidence is still considered stronger evidence than the strongest
type of witness evidence (Olson & Wells, 2004). The rationale is that witnesses can either be motived to lie in favor of
the suspect or that they can be mistaken (Burke & Marion, 2012).
Although recent research also shows that evidence is an influential factor determining alibi believability (e.g., Jung
et al., 2013; Pozzulo, Pettalia, Dempsey, & Gooden, 2015), it is also known that, contrary to what Olson and Wells
(2004) argued, other factors affect the alibi believability too. For instance, the consistency of the alibi (Culhane &
Hosch, 2012; Nieuwkamp, Horselenberg, & Van Koppen, 2016a), the context in which the alibi is first presented
(Sommers & Douglass, 2007), and the salaciousness of the alibi (Allison, Jung, Sweeney, & Culhane, 2014; Allison,
Mathews, & Michael, 2012; Jung et al., 2013; Nieuwkamp et al., 2016a).
Thus, in order to present a believable alibi, according to both police detectives and scholars, strong evidence is of
the essence. It can, however, be questioned if all genuine alibis of non‐offenders can meet these expectations of the
“perfect” believable alibi. The alibis that were presented in cases of wrongful conviction show that, despite being true,
they were not believed because they were not supported by strong enough evidence (e.g., Wells et al., 1998). Given
the importance of strong supportive evidence, we will focus in the present paper on the question if such evidence may
be expected from non‐offenders when asked for their alibis. To determine how realistic the criteria are for the perfect
alibi, three sources of information can be examined: cases with wrongful conviction, alibis given in court, and alibis
generated by non‐offenders.
First, the examination of alibis presented by convicts who were innocent provides little information, besides that not
every convict gave an alibi (11 out of 40 cases in the study by Wells et al., 1998) and that if the convict did present an alibi,
it was not believed (Connors, Lundregan, Miller, & McEwen, 1996; Garrett, 2011; Simon, 2012; Wells et al., 1998). Because
little information is available on the specific alibis in these cases and because these cases only shed a light on the alibis of a
specific subpopulation of people (i.e., wrongful convicts), these alibis are not indicative of the alibis of all non‐offenders.
A second source of information is the study of alibis presented by defendants in court. A study by Nieuwkamp
(2015) showed that only three out of 191 alibis given in court (1.6%) were found to be believable. That is not
24

 surprising because alibis presented in court are found to be less believable than when the same alibi is presented dur-
ing a police questioning (Sommers & Douglass, 2007). Furthermore, the alibis presented in court typically are
supported by relatively weak witness evidence (Nieuwkamp, 2015).
Because trial‐based alibis are seriously biased, that is, believed alibis are not presented there, a third source of
information can be examined to answer the question how realistic the criteria for the perfect alibi are. The third source
of information consists of the alibis that non‐offenders can present. By analyzing the alibis of innocent people, the
base rate of non‐offenders' alibis can be determined. In such studies, also referred to as alibi generation studies (Burke
et al., 2007), non‐offenders are asked to imagine that they are a suspect of a (mock)crime that they did not commit.
They are then asked to describe where they were at the time of the (mock)crime and whether they have evidence
to support their alibi. Using that method, knowledge can be gained on what alibis and evidence non‐offenders are
expected to present when police detectives questions them on their involvement in a crime. The results of base rate
research have the potential to provide rich information on what true alibis can be given by non‐offenders and also
provide information on how likely it is to expect strong supportive evidence of a suspect.
The few studies on determining the base rate of non‐offenders' alibis until now show three important things.
First, most non‐offenders (about 95%) have an alibi, and second, they can support their alibi with evidence (about
90%; Culhane, Hosch, & Kehn, 2008; Culhane et al., 2013; Olson & Charman, 2012). Third, the supportive evidence
they present more often consists of witness evidence (about 85%) than of physical evidence (about 25%). These
findings led researchers to conclude that a discrepancy seems to exist between which alibis can be presented by
non‐offenders compared to which alibis are found to be believable (Culhane et al., 2008). The alibis generated by
non‐offenders are often supported with evidence that is considered to be relatively weak, while strong evidence is
required in order for the alibi to be believable. It can therefore be questioned whether determining the alibi believabil-
ity mainly on the strength of the supportive evidence is a fair measure. Although these studies on alibi generation
indicate a critical issue, three important limitations should be mentioned.
First, in all studies, undergraduate students were asked for their alibi for a certain day and time (Allison, Michael,
Mathews, & Overman, 2011; Culhane et al., 2008; Culhane et al., 2013; Leins & Charman, 2013; Olson & Charman,
2012; Olson & Wells, 2012). The use of undergraduate students in such studies can, however, be problematic for gen-
eralizing the results (Culhane et al., 2008; Eastwood, Snook, & Au, 2016) and to determine which alibis and evidence
can be expected by non‐offenders in the criminal justice system, because older adults “are more likely to have addi-
tional family members (spouse and children) [who could support their alibis] and less likely to spend the same amount
of time with friends” (Culhane et al., 2013, p. 627).
In the previous studies on alibi generation, the participants were asked for their alibi mainly in the evening
(Allison, Michael, Mathews, & Overman, 2011; Culhane et al., 2008; Culhane et al., 2013), which is a second limita-
tion for the generalizability of the results. Alibis were seldom asked between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm because it “would
result in a high number of work‐related alibis” (Culhane et al., 2013, p. 627). Only information about the alibis in the
evening is available and not about alibis for the morning, the afternoon, or the night. However, crimes occur through-
out the entire day (e.g., Felson & Poulsen, 2003), and therefore, establishing the base rate of non‐offenders' alibis
should cover all times of day on various days because the routines of people may be different on weekdays and
in the weekend (Culhane et al., 2008). Next, in all previous studies, the participants were not allowed to use any
resources to generate their alibis. Olson and Charman (2012) asked their participants to generate an initial alibi
and report possible supportive evidence when they returned to the lab 48 hr later. Between both sessions, the par-
ticipants were instructed to determine whether or not their alibi was valid or had to be changed, and they were
asked to collect the supportive evidence they claimed. About 11% of the participants were mistaken about the
presented alibi, and about a quarter of the participants had been mistaken or were unable to collect the reported
supportive evidence. Olson and Charman (2012) stated that in practice, police officers might allow suspects to check
their personal calendar when asked for their alibi. Olson and Charman (2012) wanted to study the potential memory
failures when generating an alibi too, and therefore, the participants in their study were not allowed to use any
resources.

 Given the limitations, previous alibi studies are perhaps less suited to establish the base rate of alibis and its sup-
portive evidence of the population of non‐offenders. Establishing the base rate of alibis is, however, important to
determine what the whereabouts of people are at various times and various days, to determine if they can report sup-
portive evidence for it and, if so, what evidence they present. In order to do so, the present study was designed. The
first objective of the present study was to establish the base rate of alibis and its supportive evidence of non‐
offenders. Next, we were in particular interested in what alibis and what types of supportive evidence are reported.
Last, we were interested in whether or not one can assume an equal number of alibis and types of supportive evi-
dence among all presented alibis, days, and timeframes.
In line with the results of earlier studies (e.g. Culhane et al., 2013), we first hypothesized that most of our
participants would be able to present an alibi. Next, we hypothesized in accordance with previous research
findings that the participants would more often have witness evidence than physical evidence to support their
alibi (e.g., Culhane et al., 2008; Olson & Charman, 2012). Moreover, we hypothesized that the participants would
less often have supportive evidence during the night compared to the other timeframes because most of them are
assumed to be asleep. Last, we expected differences in the alibi and supportive evidence between (a) a week and
weekend day and (b) between the parts of the day, that is, an interaction between the type of day and the part of
the day.
To overcome the limitations of alibi generation research, we have chosen to ask a large sample of people from the
community for their alibis to generalize the results to the population of non‐offenders. To establish the base rate, we
aimed to reach a broader group of participants than only students, although students are also a part of the population
of non‐offenders. Some might furthermore argue that the base rate of alibis could be determined using actual sus-
pects or convicted criminals. However, in our opinion, a true alibi should differentiate between a guilty and an inno-
cent suspect, because by definition, a guilty suspect cannot present a true alibi for the crime that he or she committed.
In addition, asking convicted criminals for their alibis about a mock crime is for three reasons less informative than the
alibis of community members. First, asking convicted criminals for their alibi in the near past would highly likely result
in an alibi as “I was in jail.” Second, if they were asked for their alibis in the period before they got arrested, questioned,
and eventually convicted, the study would become a memory study rather than an alibi study. Third, because the
majority of the innocent people who were wrongfully convicted had an alibi that was not believed (e.g., Culhane
et al., 2013; Wells et al., 1998) in the pre‐trial investigation, we believe that the alibis of non‐offenders should rather
be studied than those people who are convicted. Knowledge of the alibis of non‐offenders is necessary to learn the
discriminative value of alibis, both given by offenders and non‐offenders. Therefore, the present study aims at
obtaining a more complete view of the alibis of non‐offenders and gaining insight what alibis and evidence are most
often reported and as a consequence how likely the perfect alibi is at various days and times.
To address the second limitation in alibi generation research, we decided to ask our participants for their alibis on
a wide range of timeframes across days, because crimes can occur throughout an entire day (Felson & Poulsen, 2003).
With regard to the last limitation, in the present study, the participants were explicitly instructed that resources could
be used to generate their alibi. In the present study, we are not interested in potential memory errors but only in
determining what alibis non‐offenders can report and what types of supportive evidence they present.

Participants
Participants from the community responded to an online questionnaire. The questionnaire can be found in the
Appendix. They received an e‐mail with an online link to the questionnaire. At first, friends, colleagues, and family
from the first author were sent an e‐mail with the link. They were in turn asked to send their colleagues and friends
the link to the questionnaire because we aimed at a large sample of participants, a similar method as used by
26

 Nieuwkamp et al. (2016a). In that study, the authors selected two groups of community members. One group was
recruited in the same way as in the present study. To control for a possible selection bias, a second group was
recruited at a dance school. No differences were found between groups for their demographics and their answers
on the dependent variables. Given that outcome, we believe that a possible selection bias in the selection of partici-
pants in the present study does not affect the results in another way than when the participants would have been
recruited offline.
The questionnaire was completed by 862 participants of whom 21 participants were excluded. Fifteen participants
were excluded because they failed to complete the questions about their alibi and supportive evidence. Six other par-
ticipants were excluded because they did not complete the questionnaire seriously, for instance, by answering each
question with an x. Three participants did not report their gender, and 17 participants did not report their highest com-
pleted education. They were nevertheless included in the analyses because it would not hamper the outcomes.
In total, 841 participants (261 men, 31.0%) were included in the analyses. Their ages varied between 17 and
79 years, with a mean age of 30.2, (SD = 12.7) and a median of 25.0 years. Most of the participants were employed
and had a partner with whom they were living together (see Table 1, for demographics). Most of the participants in our
sample were well educated compared to the average Dutch citizen. Because 65.3% of the participants in our sample
had achieved a bachelor degree either from college or university, while only 28.3% of the Dutch population has such a
degree (CBS, 2013), our participants are higher educated compared to the average at the time of data collection.

Research design
We tested our hypotheses using a 2 (day: Tuesday and Saturday) × 4 (time: morning, afternoon, evening, and night)
between‐subjects factorial design. Two different days (i.e., Tuesday and Saturday) were chosen because the activities
of people may vary between weekdays and weekend days (Culhane et al., 2008). Although Culhane et al. (2008) did
not find a difference between both days, the authors argued that differences between the days might exist when

 testing non‐student adults. The 4‐day parts consisted each of four times: the morning (06:45–10:45 am), the after-
noon (1:45–5:45 pm), the evening (6:45–9:45 pm), and the night (11.45 pm–4:45 am). The timeframes were chosen
based upon when most robberies were committed per hour on a single day (Felson & Poulsen, 2003), because the par-
ticipants had to present their alibi for a mock robbery. The timespan varied between the day parts because only the
highest numbers of robberies were included (Felson & Poulsen, 2003). The combination of “day” and “time” results in
eight conditions, and each condition had a minimum of 80 participants. The responses over the conditions were not
equally distributed because for each condition, a new link to the questionnaire was randomly created. It caused an
unequal distribution over the timeframes for which we controlled in our analysis (see Table 2, for the number of par-
ticipants per day and time).

Materials
After the participants read an informed consent, they were presented with the questionnaire that consisted of four
parts: demographics, case vignette, alibi generation, and last, report possible supportive evidence for it.
The case vignette detailed that a mock robbery was committed last Tuesday or Saturday at one of the timeframes.
A robbery was chosen as mock crime comparable to previous studies (e.g., Allison et al., 2014; Allison et al., 2012;
Culhane & Hosch, 2004, 2012; Eastwood et al., 2016; Pozzulo et al., 2015). To increase the ecological validity, we
asked the participants to imagine that he or she was a suspect and that the police asked them where they had been
during the robbery. In previous studies, the participants were only asked to generate an alibi for a particular day and
time (e.g., Culhane et al., 2013). The participants in the present study were asked for their alibis for either last Tuesday
or Saturday (range: 1–7 days). A delay not greater than 7 days was chosen because people can remember up to 90% of
the details from a one‐time experience about a week ago (Wagenaar, 1986). In addition, they were explicitly
instructed that they could use resources (e.g., agenda or diaries) to determine where they had been because the
results from memory studies show that participants can reliably reconstruct memories using such cues up to 6 years
ago (Odinot & Wolters, 2006).
Comparable to the method used by Allison, Michael, Mathews, and Overman (2011), the participants were first
asked to write down their alibi in an open‐ended question as detailed as possible. Afterwards, they were asked in a
cued‐recall question if they could support their alibi with physical evidence (e.g., camera recordings or a receipt). In
case they had physical evidence, they were asked of what item(s) the physical evidence consisted. Similar to the
method of Culhane, Hosch, and Kehn (2008), participants reported the physical evidence in an open‐ended question.
Next, they were asked if their alibi could be supported by witness evidence. If they reported witness evidence, they
were asked to indicate their relationship with the alibi witness(es) in a cued question listing six types of witnesses.
Four types of witnesses were identical to those used in the study by Olson and Charman (2012): “family member,”
“friend,” “acquaintance,” and “stranger.” A family member is closely related to the suspect and may therefore have a
possible motive to lie in favor of the suspect. A friend and a co‐worker (Culhane et al., 2008) also might have a pos-
sible motive to lie for the suspect but into a lesser degree than a family member. Those types of witnesses are there-
fore referred to as a motivated familiar other witness (Olson & Wells, 2004). An acquaintance (e.g., the neighbor) is a
type of non‐motivated familiar other witness (Culhane et al., 2008; Olson & Wells, 2004) and is characterized by a
large relational distance to the suspect while also being familiar to the suspect and therefore being unlikely to be
mistaken about the suspect's identity. A stranger also has no motive to lie but can be mistaken about the suspect's
identity and is therefore referred to as a non‐motivated stranger (Olson & Wells, 2004). We added “partner” to the
list of possible alibi witnesses as another witness who is a motivated familiar other witness. Last, we asked the par-
ticipants whether or not they had any other additional supportive evidence that they had not mentioned before to
support their alibi. The participants were then thanked for their cooperation and given the opportunity to provide
their contact information if they wanted to receive a brief summary of the study results once the data were
analyzed.

RESULTS
No differences between men and women are found in the analyses. To avoid redundancy in describing the results,
potential differences due to gender are not discussed.
3.1
|
Alibis
If the participant was able to describe where he or she had been, the answer was coded as an alibi. If the participant
answered “I don't know” or “I cannot remember,” it was coded as no alibi. In general, almost all of the participants were
able to report an alibi (N = 837; 99.5%). The presented alibis of the participants were post hoc categorized into 19 alibi
locations (see Table 2, for an overview of the presented alibis).
3.2
|
Supportive evidence
The vast majority of participants reported to have supportive evidence (N = 777; 92.4%) that most often consisted of
only witness evidence or a combination of evidence. All the types of evidence are displayed in Table 3.
3.2.1
|
Physical evidence
About 25% (N = 209) of the participants reported to have at least one item of physical evidence, and of them, 37 par-
ticipants (17.7%) had more than one item to support their alibi. They described a total of 260 items (range 1–5 items),
and these items were post hoc clustered into 19 categories (see Table 4, for an overview). Most of the participants
reported a receipt (32%), one of the weakest items of physical evidence, while only 7% of the participants reported
video recordings on the items of strong physical evidence.
3.2.2
|
Witness and additional evidence
A total of 757 (90.0%) of the participants reported that at least one witness could support their alibi; however, most of
them (N = 537; 63.9%) reported more than one alibi witness. They reported a total of 1,363 witnesses (see Table 5, for
an overview). About 65% of the participants reported the weakest alibi witness (i.e., a motivated familiar other), while
a stronger alibi witness was only reported by 16% of the participants.
Additional evidence was reported by 117 participants (13.9%). Besides the classic types of supportive evidence
(witness and physical evidence), nine participants (1.1%) reported a type of evidence that could be categorized as
knowledge evidence (e.g., someone who reported to have been at home without witness or physical evidence but
the participant reported the content of all the television shows he had watched that evening). The last type of evi-
dence reported was categorized as unclear evidence (N = 14; 1.7%). It was categorized as unclear evidence when it
could not directly be linked to the presented alibi and/or to the time when the alleged crime took place (e.g., someone
who reported to have been running through the forest and said that the mud on his running shoes could support his
alibi).
The supportive evidence varied between the presented alibis (see Table 6, for an overview). When the participant
had no evidence to support his alibi, he was most often at home. When the participant only had witness evidence, he
was most likely to be with friends, at the library, at a repetition, with their families, or at the cinema. Last, the combi-
nation of physical and witness evidence was most likely when the participant was at work, in class, or at a concert.
Thus, it appears that the presented alibi influences which supportive evidence can be expected. In the next section,
the differences among the conditions will be discussed.

Differences in alibis and supportive evidence between the conditions
It is interesting to determine if the alibis and evidence of non‐offenders differ at various times and between a week-
day and the weekend to understand at what time or what day people are most likely to report supportive evidence for
their alibis and what type of evidence they can present. In order to do so, binary logistic regression analysis was used
because the responses were unequally distributed among the conditions. The baseline for each separate regression
was determined with the dependent variable with the lowest overall percentage (see Table 7, for the baselines).
For example, if an alibi was least often reported for the afternoon, the afternoon was chosen as the baseline for that
variable. In the analysis, we compared the three other timeframes to the baseline and analyzed if possible differences
exist between the times and days. For each variable, the factors “day” and “time” and the interaction term were step-
wise entered forward in the binary logistic regression analysis.
The day and time did not influence whether or not the participants had an alibi but whether supportive evidence
was reported, differed between the conditions (model χ2 (2, N = 837) = 13.67, p = .001, Nagelkerke R2 = .038). The
participants were 2.59 times more likely to have supportive evidence for their alibi in the evening compared to the
night. In addition, on Saturdays, participants were 3.62 times more likely to have supportive evidence in the afternoon
compared to the night (see Figure 1).

 An alibi in absence of any supportive evidence was 2.83 times more likely to be reported in the night com-
pared to the afternoon (model χ2 (2, N = 837) = 15.31, p < .001, Nagelkerke R2 = 0.42). In addition, on Tuesday,
the participants were 2.46 times more likely to have no supportive evidence for the alibi in the morning compared
to the afternoon (see Figure 2). Although the results seem logical and obvious, the general assumption is also
supported by the data. In addition, the results contribute to the understanding of what evidence can be expected
by non‐offenders at various times. The results imply that a perfect alibi can only be seldom expected of non‐
offenders. Moreover, the evidence that can be expected by non‐offenders varies depending on when the crime
is committed.
A combination between witness and physical supportive evidence was 1.80 times more likely to be
reported in the afternoon than during the night (model χ2 (1, N = 774) = 8.65, p = .003, Nagelkerke
R2 = .017). Only witness evidence was 2.25 times more likely for an alibi in the night than in the afternoon
(model χ2 (2, N = 774) = 19.07, p < 0.001, Nagelkerke R2 = .033). The combination of witness, physical, and
additional evidence was 3.74 times more likely to be reported in the evening than in the morning. In addition,
such a combination of supportive evidence was 5.92 times more likely to be reported in the afternoon

DISCUSSION
The objective of the present study was to establish the base rate of alibis and its supportive evidence of non‐
offenders. Despite the fact that most non‐offenders report an alibi, the vast majority of their alibis do not match

 the criteria of the perfect alibi by the police because strong evidence is lacking. The reported evidence is more often
weak, and the evidence for their alibi differs depending on when the alleged crime was committed (i.e., during the
morning, afternoon, evening, or night). In addition, an alibi without supportive evidence—the least believable alibi—
is most likely to be expected during the night compared to other timeframes. An alibi supported with evidence is most
likely to be expected on Saturday afternoon. The results show that the perfect alibi to which police detectives com-
pare a suspect's alibi is an illusion because only 7% of innocent people can present strong physical evidence (i.e., video
recordings), and therefore, the base rate of alibis should be taken into account when evaluating alibis.
The present study was the first in which participants from a large community sample were asked to generate an
alibi. Although the results of the present study are comparable to the results from studies with students as participants
(e.g., Culhane et al., 2008), we also analyzed the locations of the presented alibis and the reported supportive evidence
in more detail than in previous studies. In addition, it came to light that different types of evidence can be expected
dependent on the reported alibi location. Olson and Wells (2004, p. 159), however, argued that factors other than the
strength of the evidence (such as the alibi location) are unimportant to determine the alibi believability. The results of
the present study thus show that what evidence can be expected varies depending on the alibi location.
One of the greatest challenges in the study was to classify supportive evidence. A combination of evidence was
reported by about one third of the participants. We have therefore chosen to describe the three forms of supportive
evidence separately because we did not know how to determine the strength of the combinations of supportive evi-
dence. Previously, Olson and Charman (2012), for example, only reported the strongest form of witness or physical
evidence when multiple items of evidence were reported. Because the amount of alibi witnesses is of great influence
to determine the alibi believability rather than the quality of the relationship between the witness and the suspect
(Eastwood et al., 2016), we decided to display all the reported evidence.
It also raises the question whether the strength of supportive evidence can be determined with the taxonomy of
Olson and Wells (2004). Although Olson and Wells (2004) have determined the strength of the combination of witness
and physical evidence, it remains unclear how the strength of a combination of evidence within one category of support-
ive evidence should be determined. For instance, are two motivated familiar other witnesses (e.g., the suspect's partner
and his mother) equally strong witness evidence as one unmotivated familiar other witness (e.g., the suspect's neighbor)?
We suggest conducting more research on how to determine the strength of multiple items of supportive alibi evidence
presented by one suspect, especially because about 64% of our participants reported more than one alibi witness.
Most of the new additional evidence that was reported in our study consisted of witness or physical evidence.
However, nine participants reported additional evidence that could be labeled as unique knowledge evidence.
Because about 7% of the participants in earlier studies had an alibi without supportive evidence, it could be the case
that they had unique knowledge evidence to support their alibi. In the study by Olson and Charman (2012), the
authors provided an example of an uncorroborated alibi:
An alibi might be of such nature that there is no way to verify it independently, despite its accuracy. For
example, a person who accurately recalls watching television alone for the two hour period during which
a crime was committed has no witness and no physical records of his behaviour (Olson & Charman,
2012, p. 5).
When that person can correctly recall what he or she has watched on television within the 2 hr, it might also be
classified as knowledge evidence. More research is needed to determine whether or not the taxonomy of Olson and
Wells (2004) could be expanded with knowledge evidence. The first results on how believable the new type of sup-
portive evidence is compared to witness and physical evidence are promising (Nieuwkamp, Horselenberg, & Van
Koppen, 2016b). In that study, knowledge evidence is rated to be equally believable as an unmotivated familiar other
witness among students, laypersons, and police detectives.
One of the limitations of the present study is that we did not include all the different age groups of the commu-
nity equally. The average age of the participants was around 30 years (mdn = 25.0), although the range was
17–79 years. The elderly community members were less represented in the present study than the younger ones.
38
NIEUWKAMP ET AL.
 An obvious explanation is that not everyone has access to the Internet and that an online survey is less useful to reach
a widespread sample of participants (Dillman, 2002). The results of the present study are therefore less representative
for the elderly community members. A selection bias could be a second limitation of the present study because at first,
the friends and family of the first author were asked to fill out and forward the questionnaire. Nieuwkamp et al.
(2016a) used a similar methodology where a second group of participants (i.e., a sample of community members
who were recruited in a dance school) was added to control for a possible selection bias. No difference was observed
between both groups of participants for their demographics and their answers on the dependent variables. We there-
fore believe that the possible effect of a selection bias in the present study would be very small. A third limitation to the
study is that only 2 days were chosen for the participants to present and validate an alibi. We chose a Tuesday and a
Saturday: one day during the week and one in the weekend. It could be the case that the alibis are different for other
weekdays and Sunday, although we could not find a reason why Tuesday and Saturday would be very different. Last,
for practical reasons, we did not ask our participants to send the supportive evidence to us. However, we tried to con-
trol for that limitation by providing the participants with the opportunity to use all sorts of cues to generate a valid alibi.
The results of the present study can be beneficial to determine how believable an alibi is. For example, when a
suspect is asked for his or her alibi during a night, it is known that the suspect is most likely to report only witness
evidence (about 66% of the non‐offenders). On the one hand, it would be odd to expect strong physical evidence dur-
ing the night because the base rate indicates that only one person was reported to have such evidence at that
moment. On the other hand, the base rate indicates that on Saturday afternoon, camera recordings can most often
be expected. Thus, depending on what time the suspect is asked for his or her alibi can influence the reportable sup-
portive evidence. We therefore argue that besides the strength of the supportive evidence, one should also critically
examine how likely it is to expect certain evidence at different moments. In addition, when the location of the
presented alibi is studied, the evidence that can be expected to support the alibi also varies. When a person says that
he or she was at home, it is most likely that the alibi can be supported with only witness evidence (66%) or no evi-
dence (14%). However, when the person says he or she was at a concert or playing sports, a combination between
witness and physical evidence is most likely to be expected (62% and 53%), which also implies that the person is highly
likely to present an item of physical evidence.
In sum, because most of the alibis of non‐offenders are supported by (weaker) evidence that police detectives
would not find believable, the strict criteria police detectives demand in practice for a believable alibi are based on
an illusion. Furthermore, in alibi research, it was assumed that the alibi believability could be determined by assessing
the strength of the supportive evidence. The results of the present study show that one cannot assume supportive
evidence regardless of the alibi location and day and time of the alleged crime. Accordingly, the strength of the sup-
portive evidence alone is not indicative of the believability of an alibi and in that sense does not allow for differenti-
ating between innocent and guilty suspects. Especially, it is known that also the consistency and salaciousness, for
example, need to be taken into account because these factors also affect the alibi believability.
We therefore argue that also the base rate of alibis and its supportive evidence should be taken into consider-
ation to determine the alibi's believability, both in practice and alibi research.
