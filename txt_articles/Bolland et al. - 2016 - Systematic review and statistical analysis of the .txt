Systematic review and statistical analysis of
the integrity of 33 randomized controlled
trials
ABSTRACT
Background: Statistical techniques can investigate data integrity in randomized controlled trials
(RCTs). We systematically reviewed and analyzed all human RCTs undertaken by a group of re-
searchers, about which concerns have been raised.
Methods: We compared observed distributions of p values for between-groups differences in
baseline variables, for standardized sample means for continuous baseline variables, and for
differences in treatment group participant numbers with the expected distributions. We assessed
productivity, recruitment rates, outcome data, textual consistency, and ethical oversight.
Results: The researchers were remarkably productive, publishing 33 RCTs over 15 years involv-
ing large numbers of older patients with substantial comorbidity, recruited over very short peri-
ods. Treatment groups were improbably similar. The distribution of p values for differences in
baseline characteristics differed markedly from the expected uniform distribution (p 5 5.2 3
10282). The distribution of standardized sample means for baseline continuous variables and
the differences between participant numbers in randomized groups also differed markedly from
the expected distributions (p 5 4.3 3 1024, p 5 1.5 3 1025, respectively). Outcomes were
remarkably positive, with very low mortality and study withdrawals despite substantial comor-
bidity. There were very large reductions in hip fracture incidence, regardless of intervention
(relative risk 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.15–0.31, p , 0.0001, range of relative risk
0.10–0.33), that greatly exceed those reported in meta-analyses of other trials. There were
multiple examples of inconsistencies between and within trials, errors in reported data, mislead-
ing text, duplicated data and text, and uncertainties about ethical oversight.
Conclusions: A systematic approach using statistical techniques to assess randomization out-
comes can evaluate data integrity, in this case suggesting these RCT results may be unreliable.

GLOSSARY
RCT 5 randomized controlled trial.
Investigating concerns about the integrity of data from biomedical research is difficult.1 One
approach is to use statistical techniques to compare the observed distributions of baseline variables
from a group of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for which concerns about data integrity exist,
with the expected distributions that would arise if treatment allocation occurred by chance. This
approach was previously used to identify a case of fraudulent data involving at least 168 RCTs.2
Meta-analysts may identify concerns about data integrity during their careful review of large
numbers of publications. While undertaking systematic reviews in osteoporosis, we considered
RCTs by Yoshihiro Sato et al. (“the researchers”) for inclusion. This group of authors has
published a very large number of RCTs (appendix e-1, table e-1A, references A1–A33 at
Neurology.org) that collectively have substantially influenced relevant systematic reviews.
Dr. Sato is the first author on 79% of these trials and holds primary oversight of the majority
of these publications. Questions had been raised in journal correspondence regarding some of
these papers,3–7 and we had additional concerns about aspects of a number of papers identified

 for our reviews. We wondered whether the
statistical techniques previously used for com-
paring distributions of baseline variables2
could be applied to a systematic review of
RCTs from the researchers that included 3
papers published in Neurology® (A9, A17,
A23, which have been retracted; for a full list
of papers in this study retracted to date, see
table e-1B.). In addition, we assessed some
other potentially relevant aspects of the body
of RCTs including the researchers’ productiv-
ity and recruitment rates, outcome data, tex-
tual consistency within and between RCTs,
and ethical oversight.
METHODS In November 2012, we searched MEDLINE and
Embase for all RCTs with Y. Sato or Yoshihiro Sato listed as an
author, published in English or Japanese. Two hundred fifty-
three potentially relevant publications were identified. After
excluding unrelated articles and articles by other individuals
with the same name, we identified 33 RCTs in humans (table
e-1A). For each report, we extracted data on study design, ethical
approval, randomization, baseline characteristics, and outcomes,
and identified inconsistencies in reporting of methods and results.
Halbekath et al.6 suggested that “baseline data indicate that
the study groups are strikingly well matched” in many RCTs
reported by the researchers,6 who responded that this occurred
“not by design but by chance.” Since allocation of participants in
an RCT is random, comparisons between randomized groups for
independent variables at baseline should produce a uniform dis-
tribution of p values; for example, there is an equal likelihood of
a p value of ,0.1 and .0.9, of ,0.2 and .0.8, etc. Baseline
variables within an RCT are not always independent and may be
correlated. However, this interdependence is unlikely to translate
into substantial between-group similarities where simple random-
ization is used. Clustering of the p values for differences between
groups may not occur in the same direction or to the same degree
in other trials. Since any differences between groups are attribut-
able to chance, if there is consistent clustering of variables in
multiple trials, the distribution of p values across multiple trials
from a group of clustered variables should still be approximately
uniform. Therefore, across a body of RCTs, clustering is unlikely
to affect the distribution of p values markedly. We compared the
observed distribution of p values in deciles for all baseline com-
parisons with the expected distribution using the x2 test (Excel
2007; Microsoft, Redmond, WA). We used reported p values
from the papers, and when these were not reported, we calculated
p values from the reported summary data (mean, SD, or percent-
age) using t tests or 1-way analysis of variance for continuous
variables and x2 or Fisher exact test for categorical variables
(OpenEpi version 2.3.1, www.OpenEpi.com).
We undertook a complementary analysis to assess the sam-
pling distribution of continuous variables. The central limit the-
orem states that if a population is repeatedly sampled, the means
of these samples are approximately normally distributed. The
mean of the sample means (x) approximates the population mean
(m) and the SD of the sample means is the standard error of the
mean (which is the population SD/On). Any normal distribution
curve can be standardized to produce a curve with mean 0 and SD
1 using the formula (x 2 m)/SD. A randomized group in an RCT
can be considered as a random sample from the entire trial
population. We calculated the trial population mean and SD for
each baseline continuous variable from the summary data pre-
sented in the trial report. We then selected the control group (or
the first presented treatment group when only active treatments
were compared) and standardized the sample mean ([x 2
m]/SEM). We tested whether the distribution of these standard-
ized sample means differed from the expected distribution (stan-
dardized SD of 1) using an F test for the equality of variance (Excel
2007), in an approach similar to that used by Carlisle.2
We assembled a dataset of 13 RCTs8–20 conducted by the
Auckland Bone and Joint Research Group (table e-2) as a matched
control group of trials that were similarly sized to the RCTs of
interest, conducted over a similar time frame, and also focus on
the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis in older people. We
compared the distributions of p values and standardized sample
means between this control dataset and the dataset of interest.
Bootstrap resampling was used to account for ignorance of the
dependence structure between differences in baseline variables
and single group variance structures. We randomly selected
between 350 and 450 baseline p values (with replacement) and
between 250 and 350 baseline standardized sample means
(with replacement) from both datasets, performed 2-sample
Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests on these values (SAS v9.4; SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and repeated this 1,000 times.
In a trial with simple randomization, the proportion of partic-
ipants in each group is determined by chance, and thus the num-
bers of participants in the randomized groups in a set of trials will
be binomially distributed.21,22 For a 2-arm trial with 2 partici-
pants, the probability of equal number of participants in each
group (i.e., one) is 50%, for 4 participants is 37.5%, for 10
participants is 25%, and for 50 participants is 11%. For block
randomization, the number of participants in each trial arm is
equal in each block. Thus, any differences between the size of
randomized groups arise from the last block. If the block is filled,
the groups will be equal in size. For a block size of 2 or 4 in a 2-
arm trial, an odd number of total participants means the groups
differ by one. For a block size of 4, 2 participants in the final block
gives a 2/3 probability the groups are equal in size, and a 1/3
probability that they differ by 2 participants.22 When block ran-
domization is stratified, the same principle applies for each stra-
tum. We used the approach of Carlisle2 to assess whether the
distribution of differences in numbers of participants between
treatment groups in the trials conducted by the researchers is
consistent with the binomial distribution.
Hip fracture was the most frequently reported fracture out-
come, reported for 23 trials. Using random-effects models, we
pooled these outcome data from trials by the researchers and com-
pared the results to published contemporaneous meta-analyses
of trials from other investigators. Statistical heterogeneity bet-
ween trial-level summary data was assessed using the Cochran
Q statistic (p , 0.10) and the I2 statistic (I2 . 50). Analyses
were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version
2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ).
RESULTS Productivity and recruitment rates. Table 1
shows the characteristics of the 33 human RCTs
(A1–A33). Of note, these 33 RCTs were published
over a 15-year period and included 5,894 partici-
pants. Three (A9, A17, A23) were published in
Neurology. Y. Sato was the first author for 26
RCTs. Another author was the first author for the
remaining 7 RCTs and a coauthor for 25 RCTs, and
3 others coauthored at least 10 RCTs. The rate of

who,
nonetheless, are willing trial participants. Considering
these practical requirements, it was surprising that
there was no statement regarding funding for 30 of
the 33 human RCTs. Furthermore, none of the
RCTs contained a statement on trial registration,
although many trials were published before this
became customary.
The human RCTs represent remarkable produc-
tivity, particularly given the frailty of the participants
in several of the trials. For example, in the 5 months
between March 2003 and July 2003, the researchers
recruited 500 ambulatory female patients older than
70 years with Alzheimer disease living in the

 community in 2 months (A18), 280 male patients
older than 65 years with hemiplegic stroke in 2
months (A15), and 374 female patients older than
65 years with acute hemiplegic stroke in 4 months
(A17). Compounding the workload of recruiting for
these 3 trials, participants were also reviewed every
4 weeks, and during this period, there was also ongo-
ing intensive follow-up in 3 trials involving 774 par-
ticipants (A13, A14, A20) and recruitment and
intensive follow-up for 2 other trials involving 292
participants (A11, A23). Despite the high workload
required to conduct clinical trials on such a scale, 4
of these 8 trials listed only the same 4 coauthors
(A14, A15, A17, A18), and only one additional coau-
thor was listed for 2 of these trials (A13, A23). How-
ever, the recent Journal of Bone and Mineral Research
retraction notice for one paper (A16) states that the
coauthors of Dr. Sato “are named as such for honor-
ary reasons and are not responsible for the content of
the manuscript.”23 Two of the 3 papers in Neurology
reported details on potential participant eligibility. In
one, ,10% of potential participants were ineligible
despite very restrictive inclusion criteria (A9). In
both, .85% of people approached were enrolled
(A9, A23).
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome can rarely occur
following reduction or withdrawal of levodopa the-
rapy. The researchers identified 40 patients with
Parkinson disease with this syndrome over 3 years
in a single institution, Futase Social Insurance Hospi-
tal, which has only 55 inpatient beds and 4 clinicians
(http://futase-hp.jp/about/outline.php) (A8). A cor-
respondent found this astonishing because clinicians
at their institution, which has a special interest in
Parkinson disease, could only “recall 2 such cases in
living memory.”3 Correspondents also expressed dis-
belief at the recruitment rate in the female stroke trial
(A17) because, in their experience, ,10% of stroke
admissions would meet the eligibility criteria.4
Improbably similar randomized treatment groups. In 32
human RCTs, baseline data for all participants in all
randomized groups were presented for 513 variables;
data were only presented for study completers in one
RCT (A1). Figure 1A shows the distribution of
p values for between-groups comparisons of these
513 variables. Of note, 52% of p values were .0.8,
while only 6%, 14%, and 27% of p values were ,0.2,
,0.4, and ,0.6, respectively. This distribution is
highly unlikely to have arisen by chance (p 5 5.2 3
10282). In the 25 RCTs with Y. Sato as the first
author,
the
distribution
of
p
values
differed
significantly from the expected distribution (p 5
3.8 3 102100) (figure 1C). Figure 1B shows the
distribution of the standardized sample means for
402 baseline continuous variables. The SD of these
standardized sample means was 0.84, and the
distribution differed markedly from the expected
distribution
(p

1024),
with
values
clustered more tightly around the mean than
expected. Figure 1D shows that in the 25 RCTs
with Y. Sato as the first author, the distribution of
standardized
sample
means
differed
from
the
expected distribution with values clustered tightly
around the mean (p 5 1.5 3 10211).
The distribution of p values from 918 baseline
variables from 13 RCTs in the control dataset was
consistent with the expected independent uniform
distribution (p 5 0.07, figure e-1), and the SD of
the standardized sample means from 726 baseline
variables was 1.02, also consistent with the expected
distribution (p 5 0.78). However, comparison of
baseline p values and standardized sample means from
the RCTs of interest and the control RCTs using
bootstrap resampling showed marked differences in
distributions (baseline p values: p , 0.001 in all
1,000 comparisons; standardized sample means:
median p value 6 3 1024, 95% confidence interval
2 3 1027 to 0.021).
Table 2 shows that the numbers of participants in
each treatment group were the same in 27 of 30 two-
arm RCTs. For all 33 trials, randomization in blocks
was stated specifically for 10 RCTs, using computer-
generated random numbers for 13 RCTs, no details
were reported for 9 RCTs, and one trial was pseudor-
andomized using alternate allocation. Four trials that
used block randomization were stratified by site, and
for one trial, participant numbers by site were re-
ported in correspondence about the paper (A18).
For another 2 trials (A13, A15), stratified randomi-
zation was not described, but multiple sites and par-
ticipant numbers by site were reported in corrections
or correspondence about the papers. We assumed
randomization was stratified by site for these 2 trials.
Figure 2 shows that the distribution of differences in
participant numbers between the treatment groups
differs from the expected distribution (p 5 5 3
10233) in 20 two-arm RCTs presumed to use simple
randomization (i.e., unless block randomization was
stated). For the 10 RCTs that used block randomi-
zation, the observed distribution of differences was
consistent with the expected distribution (p 5
0.48). When all 30 two-arm trials were considered,
the observed distribution of differences differed from
the expected distribution (p 5 1.5 3 1025). Finally,
we treated all trials as if they used randomization with
a block size of 4 unless another approach was explic-
itly stated (except trial A1, which has a difference of 6
participants between groups meaning that block
randomization is very unlikely). The distribution of
differences in participant numbers between the
treatment groups still differs from the expected

 distribution. The expected number of trials with
equal participants is 22/30 and with a difference of
2 participants is 5/30, whereas the observed number
of trials was 27 and 0, respectively (p 5 0.04).
The results of these separate but complementary
analyses strongly suggest there has been a systematic
failure of randomization in these trials because the
randomized groups are much more similar than
would be expected by chance, if randomization had
occurred successfully.
Remarkably positive outcomes. The outcomes reported
by the researchers are generally extremely positive and
inconsistent
with
contemporaneous
literature.
Despite studying frail elderly individuals with sub-
stantial comorbidity, table 2 shows that participant
withdrawals from the trials were few in number and
very well matched between treatment groups. In fact,
only 519 participants (8.8%) did not complete the
trials, which is surprising because participants had
very high rates of hip fracture (table 2) and substantial
background comorbidity, both of which are associ-
ated with high mortality.
Figure 3 shows the observed reductions in hip
fracture in RCTs with a control group that received
either placebo or no treatment for the various treat-
ments studied by the researchers. There were consis-
tent and substantial reductions in hip fracture
incidence regardless of the treatment studied (relative
risk 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.15–0.31, p ,
0.0001, range of relative risk 0.10–0.33) with very
little statistical heterogeneity between the results.
This lack of heterogeneity is very surprising given
the relatively large numbers of agents and the diver-
sity of the populations studied. Furthermore, figure 3
also shows that the magnitude of these reductions is
substantially greater than those observed in meta-
analyses of other trials for these agents,24–26 and the
confidence intervals around the pooled result for the
researchers’ trials do not overlap the confidence inter-
vals around the pooled results for trials conducted by
other investigators. Thus, the very positive results of
the trials by the researchers are inconsistent with re-
sults from other groups.
Logical and other inconsistencies. There are a number
of inconsistent results between trials conducted by
the researchers. For example, in a trial in Alzheimer
disease (A29), the control group received risedronate
and calcium and had a hip fracture rate of 86/1,000
patient-years. Yet, the active treatment arm of another
trial in patients with Alzheimer disease (A18) who
received risedronate, calcium, and vitamin D had
a
hip
fracture
rate
of
15/1,000
patient-years.
Similarly, trials in Parkinson disease in which the
control group received placebo plus vitamin D
reported very high rates of hip fracture (49, 37, and
55/1,000 patient-years) (A22, A23, A30) but when
sunlight exposure was used as the active treatment
arm to improve vitamin D status, the hip fracture
rate was only 9/1,000 patient-years (A31). Likewise,
when vitamin D was used in the placebo arm of trials,
bone density decreased substantially by 0.9% to 3.2%
(A18, A22, A23, A30), whereas when sunlight
exposure
was
studied
as
active
treatment,
bone mineral density increased by 2.7% to 3.8%
(A16, A31).
There are also inconsistencies within trials. For
example, in one Neurology paper (A9), the authors
state that 109 participants were randomized to one
group and 108 to the other. However, the partici-
pant flow diagram shows 129 participants in each
group with 109 and 108, respectively, completing
the trial. In one study (A22) it is stated that random-
ization was performed by one of the authors “(J.I.),”
and in the same paragraph, it is stated that “follow-
up assessment of patient’s condition was performed
by physicians (Y.S., J.I.) who did not participate in
the initial randomization.” In one study (A29), it is
stated that randomization was stratified by site, yet
only one site was mentioned in the methods section.
In another study (A15), participants were eligible for
inclusion if they had sustained a stroke at least 3
months before the study began, but the mean dura-
tion of illness at baseline in both randomized groups
was 90 days, or slightly less than 3 months, which
appears implausible.
There are also errors in the reported outcome
data. In 14 RCTs, rates of hip fracture per 1,000
patient-years are reported (table 2). For 11 of these
trials, the reported rates can simply be calculated
with the equation: rate 5 number with hip frac-
ture/(participants 3 duration of trial). These rates
are not correct because they do not account for loss
to follow-up or censoring of participants who have
sustained a hip fracture. Data on adverse events are
also misreported. For example, in 2 of the 3
Figure 1 legend, continued:
the subject of the recent expression of concern from the Journal of the American Medical Association27 (E), and study A23,
published in Neurology (G). The dotted line shows the expected proportion (0.1) for each decile. (B, D, F, H) The observed vs
expected distribution of standardized sample means for all continuous baseline variables in these 32 trials (B) and in 25
trials with Y. Sato as first author (D), and for all continuous baseline variables in study A13 (F) and study A23 (H). The
expected distribution is a normal distribution curve with mean 0 and SD 1 (dotted line). The solid line is a normal curve of
best fit to the observed data. All the graphs show that the observed distribution differs markedly from the expected
distribution.

 Neurology papers, it was stated that no adverse events
(A17) or no serious adverse events (A23) occurred
during the trial. However in A17, 10 participants
withdrew because of death or intercurrent illness,
87 experienced at least one fall, and 8 had a hip
fracture. Likewise, in A23, 7 participants withdrew
because of death or intercurrent illness, 12 had a hip
fracture, and there was an average of 1.5 falls per
participant during the trial.
Misleading text. In one study (A13), the researchers
claimed to have recruited 628 trial participants from
a single site. In a later correction, they stated that
there were 3 additional unnamed hospitals and that
the originally stated site actually recruited only 53 of
628 participants, the smallest number by some
degree. Similarly, in 2 studies (A15, A18), the re-
searchers claimed to have recruited 280 male patients
with stroke and 500 patients with Alzheimer disease,
respectively, from a single site. In a later correction,
they stated that there were 2 additional unnamed
hospitals. The researchers stated that the reason
for this misinformation was that “these hospitals
were reluctant to have their names in the article.”
Given the large size and intensive nature of these
trials, and the absence of statements regarding fund-
ing, we presume the trials were effectively funded by
the hospitals involved, with substantial trial input
from other unnamed hospital staff. It is hard to
understand why the hospital and its staff would
not accept any recognition of their substantial
contributions.
Duplicate data and text. There are examples of strik-
ingly similar text in the reports, including duplicate
outcome data. Table 3 shows that the reported
mean and SD for fall rates were identical in 3 stud-
ies (A4, A6, A9) for both the treatment and control
groups, and another study (A19) had identical SD
to the earlier studies but the mean differed by l unit
for both the treatment and control groups. Later,
these data were altered without explanation in cor-
rections for 2 of these trials (A6, A9). Duplicated
text is also apparent when logical errors arise.
Table 3 shows an example of 2 studies with iden-
tical exclusion criteria, but one criterion does not
make sense for one trial because it only applies to
women, but only men were eligible to participate in
the trial. Some examples of duplicated text are
extensive. The majority of the text in one article
(A16) is identical or nearly identical to that of a later
article (A31) (table e-3).
Ethical oversight. In the 33 RCTs, the ethics commit-
tee that approved the research was usually listed as
the institutional or local ethics committee (22 stud-
ies). By using all the published information regard-
ing the ethics committee approval and the location
of the study, it appears that ethical approval was
granted by the ethics committee of Futase Social
Insurance Hospital in 11 RCTs, Mitate Hospital
for 10 RCTs, Keiyu Orthopaedic Hospital for 5
RCTs, multiple hospital committees in 2 RCTs,
and in 5 RCTs, the committee could not be identi-
fied. We searched the internet for “ethics” and
“Mitate Hospital” or “Futase” and were unable to
identify any studies performed by other groups
approved by either of these ethics committees. With
only 4 clinicians practicing at Futase Hospital, it
seems likely that members of the Futase Hospital
ethics committee had at least some clinical relation-
ships with at least some of the coauthors of the papers
by the researchers. In fact, in at least 6 studies (A9,
A16, A17, A21, A27, A31), the chairperson of the
ethics committee appeared to be involved with the

DISCUSSION Our systematic review and application
of established methods to examine data integrity to
the 33 human RCTs published by the researchers rai-
ses serious concerns about the integrity and validity of
the reported results. Objective evidence for these con-
cerns is provided by the statistical analyses, which
demonstrate a systematic failure of randomization,
and the consistently outlying outcome data when

Relative risk of hip fracture in randomized controlled trials by the researchers
Meta-analysis showing a 78% reduction in relative risk (p , 0.0001) of hip fracture in 19 randomized controlled trials by
the researchers with a control group that received either a placebo or no treatment. For comparison, the results for agents
in meta-analyses of other trials are shown.24–26 There are insufficient data for hip fracture outcomes from trials of alpha-
calcidiol,26 B12/folate, or vitamin K by other investigators, but vitamin K is reported to have no effect on bone density29 or
vertebral fracture risk.30 There was a statistically significant (p , 0.05) interaction between the risk of hip fracture in the
researchers’ trials and the risk of hip fracture for each of the agents in trials by other investigators.

 compared to those from other researchers. Taken
together with the implausible productivity of the
group, internal inconsistencies for outcome data in
their work, duplication of data, numerous misleading
statements and errors, and concerns regarding ethical
oversight, our analysis suggests that the results of at
least some of these trials are not reliable. Recently,
the Journal of the American Medical Association has
issued an expression of concern about one trial
(A13), and the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research
an expression of concern followed by retraction
of another trial (A16), both precipitated by our
concerns.23,27,28
Two issues arise from our analyses of distribution
of p values and standardized sample means for con-
sidering the success or failure of randomization.
There will be differences in p values and standard-
ized sample means calculated from published sum-
mary data compared to values calculated from raw
data because of rounding of variables. However, any
differences would be small and could not explain the
marked departure from the expected distributions
that we found. A second issue is that some of the
baseline variables may not be independent. For
example, if by chance, one randomized group is old-
er than the other, this group may have similar differ-
ences in variables correlated with age, such as
bone mineral density. This could lead to clustering
of p values and standardized means within an indi-
vidual RCT. However, clustering may not occur in
the same direction or magnitude in other trials.
Since any differences between groups are attributed
to chance, consistent clustering of variables should
still produce an approximately uniform distribution
of p values of between-groups comparisons from
a group of clustered baseline variables across multi-
ple trials. Therefore, clustering of results from indi-
vidual RCTs is unlikely to affect the analysis of
a body of RCTs markedly. However, results from
individual RCTs or small differences from expected
variations for a body of RCTs should be interpreted
cautiously.
Previously, Carlisle analyzed the distribution of
standardized sample means from 168 RCTs published
by an individual author, the integrity of whose work
had been questioned, along with data from 366 RCTs
from other authors.2 He reported that the observed
distribution of standardized sample means for weight,
height, and age from the 366 control RCTs were con-
sistent with expected (range of standardized SD 0.93–
1.06), whereas the distributions of sample means from
the 168 RCTs of interest were not (range SD 0.55–
0.62). Similarly, pooling all continuous variables pro-
duced a distribution similar to expected for the 366
RCTs from other authors, whereas the distribution was
markedly different to expected for the variables from
the 168 RCTs of interest.2 The results of our analyses
of the data from the researchers were similar to the
results of Carlisle’s analysis, with observed distributions
of sample means markedly different to expected. A
limitation of this work, and the previous work by
Carlisle, is that the statistical theory underpinning
the methods used has not been fully developed.
In summary, statistical techniques, such as those
used in this report and similar approaches used previ-
ously by Carlisle,2 that involve comparisons of the
observed distributions of baseline p values or baseline
variables in RCTs with the expected distributions
may be useful when considering or investigating the
integrity of a group of RCTs.
