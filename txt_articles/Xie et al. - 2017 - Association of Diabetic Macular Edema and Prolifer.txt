IMPORTANCE Previous studies on the relationship between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and
cardiovascular disease (CVD) focused on the early stages of DR. Understanding whether
patients with type 2 diabetes and severe stages of DR (diabetic macular edema [DME] and
proliferative diabetic retinopathy [PDR]) have a higher risk of CVD will allow physicians to
more effectively counsel patients.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of severe stages of DR (DME and PDR) with incident
CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes.
DATA SOURCES English-language publications were reviewed for articles evaluating the
relationship of DR and CVD in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, and the Cochrane
Library from inception (January 1, 1950) to December 31, 2014, using the search terms
diabetic retinopathy OR macular edema AND stroke OR cerebrovascular disease OR coronary
artery disease OR heart failure OR myocardial infarction OR angina pectoris OR acute coronary
syndrome OR coronary artery disease OR cardiomyopathy.
STUDY SELECTION Among 656 studies screened for eligibility, 7604 individuals were included
from 8 prospective population-based studies with data on photographic-based DR grading,
follow-up visits, and well-defined incident CVD end point.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers conducted a systematic
search of the 4 databases, and a single pooled database was developed. Incidence rate ratios
(IRRs) were estimated for patients with DME, PDR, and vision-threatening DR, compared
with persons without these conditions, by using individual participant data followed by a
standard inverse-variance meta-analysis (2-step analysis). The review and analyses were
performed from January 1, 2009, to January 1, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Incident CVD, including coronary heart disease, stroke, or
death from cardiovascular causes.
RESULTS Among 7604 patients with type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of DME was 4.6% and
PDR, 7.4%. After a mean follow-up of 5.9 years (range, 3.2-10.1 years), 1203 incident CVD
events, including 916 coronary heart disease cases, were reported. Persons with DME or PDR
were more likely to have incident CVD (IRR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.16-1.67) and fatal CVD (IRR, 2.33;
95% CI, 1.49-3.67) compared with those without DME or PDR.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with type 2 diabetes and DME or PDR have an
increased risk of incident CVD, which suggests that these persons should be followed up
more closely to prevent CVD.

 D
iabetic retinopathy (DR) is a frequent microvascular
complication of diabetes.1 In the past few decades,
studies have shown that presence of any DR is asso-
ciated with a range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as
stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), and myocardial infarc-
tion,andCVD-associatedmortality.2,3TheAtherosclerosisRisk
in Communities study reported a 3-fold higher risk (hazard ra-
tio [HR], 3.35; 95% CI, 1.40-8.01) of fatal CHD events among
persons with any DR,4 whereas the Wisconsin Epidemiologic
Study on Diabetic Retinopathy revealed a nonsignificant in-
crease in CHD-associated mortality among older persons with
mild nonproliferative DR (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.95-1.53) and pro-
liferative DR (PDR) (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.94-2.17).5 Evidence
from other studies has been inconclusive, possibly because of
differences in the exposures compared (eg, nonproliferative
DR vs PDR), methods used (eg, fundus photography vs clini-
cal ophthalmoscopy), and outcome definitions (eg, fatal CHD
vs nonfatal stroke). However, these studies were focused
mainly on the early stages of DR, because the prevalence of
severe DR stages was relatively low in individual studies.6,7

to effectively counsel patients.
To address this critical gap, we conducted a systematic re-
view and an individual participant meta-analysis to specifi-
cally determine the association of DME and PDR with CVD out-
comes by using data from population-based cohort studies.
Methods
Data Sources and Searches and Study Selection
We conducted a systematic review of the literature. All pro-
spective population-based cohort studies that reported asso-
ciationsbetweenthepresenceofDRandincidentCVDwerecon-
sideredforinclusion.Ouroverallsearchstrategytargetedstudies
that satisfied the following 5 criteria: (1) evaluated any cardio-
vascularoutcomebyDRstatus,(2)followedupparticipantswith
diabetesrecruitedfromthegeneralpopulationforatleast1year,
(3) included analysis of original data, (4) used retinal photog-
raphy findings for the diagnosis, and (5) reported a risk esti-
mate (eg, HR or relative risk [RR] adjusting for age, sex, and key
potential confounders) relating preexisting DR to subsequent
CVD by using survival analysis regression models.
Two independent reviewers (J.X. and M.K.I.) conducted
a systematic search of 4 databases, including MEDLINE,
EMBASE, Current Contents, and the Cochrane Library,
from January 1, 1950, to December 31, 2014, for articles
evaluating the relationship of DR and CVD. We used the
following MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) search terms:
diabetic retinopathy OR macular edema AND stroke OR
cerebrovascular disease OR coronary artery disease OR
heart failure OR myocardial infarction OR angina pectoris
OR acute coronary syndrome OR coronary artery disease OR
cardiomyopathy. No limits were placed on the year of publi-
cation, but we limited our search to English-language publi-
cations. The reference lists of included articles were also
reviewed to identify other potentially relevant studies. Stud-
ies were systematically excluded if the titles and abstracts
did not meet the 5 aforementioned inclusion criteria.
Data Extraction
We contacted principal authors of eligible studies and
requested individual participant data regarding CVD, CHD,
stroke, presence and severity of DR, DME status, age, sex, race/
ethnicity, diabetes type and duration, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
level, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lipid profile, smok-
ing status, body mass index, and current use of diabetes, an-
tihypertensive, and lipid-lowering medications. Data were
checkedforcompletenessandexplanationsforcodingchanges,
and uncertain or missing data items were clarified with prin-
cipal authors; a single pooled database was developed. The re-
view and analyses were performed from January 1, 2009, to
January 1, 2017. All studies had institutional review board ap-
proval and provided appropriately deidentified data for
individual-level meta-analysis.
Definition of Exposures
In all included studies, diabetes was defined as a self-
reported physician diagnosis of diabetes in combination with
use of oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin. In addition,
in each of the 8 studies, undiagnosed diabetes was deter-
mined by one of the following blood glucose measurements:
a fasting glucose level of 126 mg/dL or higher (to convert to
millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555), a non-fasting glu-
cose level of 199.8 mg/dL or higher, or an HbA1c level of 7.0%
Key Points
Question Do patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic macular
edema or proliferative diabetic retinopathy have an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 7604
participants with type 2 diabetes, patients with diabetic macular
edema or proliferative diabetic retinopathy had a higher risk of
incident cardiovascular disease and fatal cardiovascular disease
compared with patients without diabetic macular edema or
proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
Meaning Persons with diabetic macular edema or proliferative
diabetic retinopathy have an increased risk of incident
cardiovascular disease, and thus these individuals should be
followed up more actively to prevent cardiovascular disease.

In those studies, if data on age at diagnosis of diabetes were
available, participants were classified as having type 1 diabe-
tes if they were diagnosed before 30 years of age and as hav-
ing type 2 diabetes if they were diagnosed with diabetes after
30 years of age. In the present study, the analyses were lim-
ited to persons with type 2 diabetes.
Included studies graded DR on the basis of fundus photog-
raphy findings using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy
Scale(ETDRS),asdescribedpreviously.1Diabeticretinopathyse-

Cardiovascular Outcomes
In each study, information on incident cardiovascular out-
comes was obtained through follow-up interviews, identify-
ing hospitalizations and deaths during follow-up, and review-
ing local hospital discharge lists and death certificates from
state statistics offices.
Coronary heart disease was defined as evidence of a first
physician-diagnosedmyocardialinfarction,coronaryarteryby-
pass graft surgery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary an-
gioplasty abstracted from medical records (International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
[ICD-9-CM] codes 402, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 427, 428, 429,
429.2, 440, 518.4, 798, and 799).
Stroke was defined as a first cerebral ischemic (embolic or
thrombotic) or hemorrhagic (subarachnoid or intracerebral)
event with associated clinical features of sudden focal neuro-
logical deficits diagnosed by a physician and abstracted from
medicalrecords(ICD-9-CMcodes430-438).Acasewasalsoeli-
gible if review of the medical record revealed diagnostic com-
puted tomography or magnetic resonance imaging with cere-
brovascular findings.
Coronary vascular disease was defined as a diagnosis of
CHD or stroke. Furthermore, we distinguished studies that re-
ported nonfatal, fatal, or any (either fatal or nonfatal) CHD,
stroke, or CVD outcomes. The following 4 outcomes were used
for the present meta-analysis: (1) first CVD event, (2) fatal CVD,
(3) first CHD event, and (4) fatal CHD.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Funnel plots were constructed to assess potential publica-
tionbiasinourmeta-analysis.Multipleregressionmodelswith
Poisson distribution and robust error variance were used to es-
timate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) among patients with DME,
PDR, and VTDR compared with persons without these condi-
tions by using individual participant data followed by a stan-
dard inverse-variance meta-analysis (2-step analysis). This
method has advantages when analyzing rare events in indi-
vidual participant data meta-analyses, particularly when stud-
ies have different follow-up times.11 Because of the small num-
bers of patients with stroke, this outcome was not analyzed
as an individual outcome but instead was included only in the
analysis of first-ever and fatal CVD. Because the Blue Moun-
tains Eye Study12 and the Cardiovascular Health Study13 had
shorter diabetes duration and shorter follow-up time, we per-
formed a sensitivity analysis by excluding these 2 studies. We
used the Cochran Q test to assess between-study differences
and the I2 statistic to quantify the proportion of observed in-
consistency across study results not explained by chance. Fur-
thermore, a Galbraith plot was constructed to assess hetero-
geneity. A fixed-effect meta-analysis was used if there was no
statisticalheterogeneityinthetrueeffectsunderlyingthestud-
ies; otherwise, a random-effect meta-analysis was used. Fur-
thermore, forest plots were constructed. Studies that did not
havedataonallrequiredconfounderswereexcludedfromsub-
sequent multivariable analyses. All statistical analyses were
performed using Stata, version 14.1 (StataCorp). A 2-tailed
P < .05 was considered as statistically significant.

 DME,PDR,andVTDRcasesandincidentCVDoutcomesineach
study. After a mean follow-up time of 5.9 years (range 3.2-
10.1 years) across studies, there was a total of 1203 incident
cases of first CVD events (with 286 fatal cases), including 916
CHD cases (with 242 fatal cases).
Meta-analysis
Funnel plot results for potential publication bias are shown in
eFigure 1 in the Supplement. The Gilbraith plot showed no sig-
nificant heterogeneity in this meta-analysis (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). Both DME and PDR were related to an in-
creased risk of first-ever CVD (IRR for DME, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.24-
2.19]; IRR for PDR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.03-1.58]) and fatal CVD (IRR
for DME, 2.85 [95% CI, 1.43-5.68]; IRR for PDR, 1.85 [95% CI,
1.04-3.28]) (Table 3 eFigure 3 in the Supplement). These as-
sociations were consistent after multivariable adjustment for
vascular risk factors, including smoking, systolic blood pres-
sure, use of hypertension medication, total cholesterol level,
and body mass index. When duration of diabetes, use of any
treatment for diabetes, and glycated HbA1c level were in-
cludedinthemultivariablemodel,theassociationbetweenthe
presence of VTDR (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.10-4.39) and fatal CVD
remained significant.
With respect to CHD, DME and PDR were related to an in-
creased risk of first-ever CHD (IRR for DME, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.16-
2.14]; IRR for PDR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.09-1.76]) and fatal CHD (IRR
forDME,3.55[95%CI,1.76-7.15];IRRforPDR,2.11[95%CI,1.19-
3.76]) (Table 3). These associations were consistent after mul-
tivariable adjustment for vascular risk factors, including smok-
ing, systolic blood pressure, use of hypertension medication,
total cholesterol level, and body mass index. When duration
of diabetes, use of treatment for diabetes, and glycosylated he-
moglobin level were included in the multivariable model, the
association between the presence of VTDR (HR, 2.47; 95% CI,
1.21-5.06) and fatal CHD remained significant.
Finally, in an analysis excluding the Blue Mountains Eye
Study12 and the Cardiovascular Health Study13 (Table 4),
results were similar to our main analysis.
Discussion
In this individual participant meta-analysis, we revealed that
among patients with type 2 diabetes, the presence of DME or
PDR was associated with an increased risk of incident CVD, in-
cluding CHD, compared with those without these conditions.

 These associations persisted after adjusting for other cardio-
vascular risk factors.
Diabetic macular edema and PDR are distinct constella-
tionsofretinalmicrovascularsignsthatreflectsmall-vesseldis-
ease caused by hyperglycemia. The presence of microvascu-
lar disease in the eye raises the possibility of more generalized
microangiopathic processes affecting not only the eye but also
other sites including the myocardium and brain. Further-
more, it has been suggested that in addition to macrovascular
disease, as reflected by the effects of accelerated atheroscle-
rosis and large-vessel occlusive disease, microvascular pathol-
ogy plays an important role in these end organs.22 Our find-
ings suggest that the presence of DME or PDR may be a marker
of generalized microvascular disease, which may contribute
to the development of CVD in persons with diabetes. In sup-
port of this hypothesis, histopathologic findings have shown
that small-vessel disease present in the retina is also evident
in the heart and brain of individuals with diabetes.23,24 In ad-
dition, evidence from histologic studies have shown that DR
is associated with subclinical coronary microvascular patho-
logic findings, such as endothelial dysfunction, impaired coro-
nary hypoxic-vasodilation, myocardial perfusion defects, and
poorer coronary flow reserve.25-28 Cardiac failure has also been
reported in diabetes, even in the absence of angiographically

 detectable coronary artery disease.29 These findings suggest
a role for microvascular disease in the development of CHD in
persons with type 2 diabetes. The pathophysiologic path-
waysunderlyingtheseobservationsarestilluncertain,butsev-
eral putative factors, such as oxidative stress, inflammation,
endothelial dysfunction, and advanced glycation end prod-
ucts, have been reported.30-36
Unlike previous studies, our findings address the specific
relationship of the most severe clinically relevant stages of DR
(ie, DME and PDR) with incident CVD. These data are impor-
tant because anti-VEGF treatments for DME and possibly PDR
are the current standard of care. A major concern with anti-
VEGF agents is the potential increased risk of CVD secondary
to long-term systemic suppression of VEGF.9,10,37,38 Interim
analysis of the Safety Assessment of Intravitreal Lucentis for
Age-Related Macular Degeneration trial revealed an in-
creased risk of stroke in patients treated with 0.5 mg of intra-
vitreal ranibizumab injection compared with patients treated
with 0.3 mg (1.2% vs 0.3%; P = .02).37 Although subsequent
analysis at completion of that trial showed no significant in-
crease in stroke risk, it raised a concern about the safety of
ranibizumab.9,10 Furthermore, the Comparison of Age-
relatedMacularDegenerationTreatmentsTrialssuggestedthat
bevacizumab treatment may also result in a higher risk of se-
rious adverse events among persons with age-related macu-
lar degeneration.38 This raises a concern that treatment with
anti-VEGF for persons with VTDR, who already have a greater
risk of fatal CHD and CVD events, could lead to an additional
increase in risk of severe CVD events. However, because the
studies included were conducted before the introduction of
anti-VEGF therapy for DME and DR, data on whether anti-
VEGF use modified the relationship are not available. Never-
theless, our study provides an assessment of the baseline risk
of the relationship that will provide a foundation for
future studies.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of our study include its comprehensive, systematic
review of the literature using a broad search strategy to iden-
tify all relevant studies and the inclusion of primary data from
high-quality studies. The availability of individual partici-
pant data provided by authors allowed for more robust calcu-
lation of the multivariable adjusted risk estimates. Our data
collection enabled us to stratify risk estimates by specific fa-
tal and nonfatal CVD end points and to provide adjustment for
key potential confounders. Our study had several limita-
tions. First, DME grading was based on solely fundus photog-
raphy findings because no data were available from optical co-
herence tomography at baseline. This factor could have led to
an underestimation of the number of patients with DME. De-
spite this underestimation, we found a significant associa-
tion between DME and incident CVD. Second, we could not in-
clude all 8 studies in subsequent multivariable analyses
(models 2 and 3 in Table 3 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement)
because of the lack of data on key confounders in some stud-
ies. Therefore, a smaller sample size was available for the fully
adjusted models, leading to wider CIs and loss of statistical sig-
nificance.However,thepointestimatesremainedstable.Third,

 because of the small number of patients with type 1 diabetes
and incident stroke, we were not able to examine separately
the association of type 1 diabetes with incident stroke.
Finally, most of these studies were conducted at a time when
the clinical management and standard of care of diabetes and
DRmighthavebeendifferent.Forexample,tighterglucoseand
blood pressure control could be expected in the current man-
agement of type 2 diabetes. As already indicated, studies were
conducted before the era of anti-VEGF therapy, and the im-
pact of this on our results are unknown. However, because of
the nature of our study, in which we required sufficient inci-
dent CVD and CHD cases over time, it was not possible to in-
clude newer studies because there would be too few incident
CVD and CHD cases for analysis.
Conclusions
In conclusion, persons with type 2 diabetes and DME or PDR
had an increased risk of incident CVD and CHD events com-
pared with those with mild or no DR. These data suggest that
persons with type 2 diabetes and more severe stages of DR
should be followed up more actively by their physicians, with
interventions as appropriate, to prevent CVD complications.
