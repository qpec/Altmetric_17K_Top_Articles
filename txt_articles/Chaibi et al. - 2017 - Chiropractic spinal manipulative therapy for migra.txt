Background and purpose:
To investigate the efficacy of chiropractic spinal
manipulative therapy (CSMT) for migraineurs.
Methods:
This was a prospective three-armed, single-blinded, placebo, ran-
domized controlled trial (RCT) of 17 months duration including 104 migrai-
neurs with at least one migraine attack per month. The RCT was conducted
at Akershus University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. Active treatment consisted of
CSMT, whereas placebo was a sham push manoeuvre of the lateral edge of
the scapula and/or the gluteal region. The control group continued their usual
pharmacological management. The RCT consisted of a 1-month run-in,
3 months intervention and outcome measures at the end of the intervention
and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. The primary end-point was the number
of migraine days per month, whereas secondary end-points were migraine
duration, migraine intensity and headache index, and medicine consumption.
Results:
Migraine days were significantly reduced within all three groups from
baseline to post-treatment (P < 0.001). The effect continued in the CSMT and
placebo group at all follow-up time points, whereas the control group returned
to baseline. The reduction in migraine days was not significantly different
between the groups (P > 0.025 for interaction). Migraine duration and head-
ache index were reduced significantly more in the CSMT than the control
group towards the end of follow-up (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04 for interaction,
respectively). Adverse events were few, mild and transient. Blinding was
strongly sustained throughout the RCT.
Conclusions:
It is possible to conduct a manual-therapy RCT with concealed
placebo. The effect of CSMT observed in our study is probably due to a
placebo response.
Introduction
The socio-economic costs of migraine are enormous
due to its high prevalence and disability
during
attacks [1–3]. Acute pharmacological treatment is usu-
ally the first treatment option for migraine in adults.
Migraineurs with frequent attacks, insufficient effect
and/or
contraindication
to
acute
medication
are
potential
candidates
for
prophylactic
treatment.
Migraine prophylactic treatment is often pharmaco-
logical, but manual therapy is not unusual, especially
if pharmacological treatment fails or if the patient
wishes to avoid medicine [4]. Research has suggested
that spinal manipulative therapy may stimulate neural
inhibitory
systems
at
different
spinal
cord
levels
because it might activate various central descending
inhibitory pathways [5–10].
Pharmacological
randomized
controlled
trials
(RCTs) are usually double-blinded, but this is not
possible in manual-therapy RCTs, as the interven-
tional therapist cannot be blinded. At present there is
no consensus on a sham procedure in manual-therapy

 RCTs that mimics placebo in pharmacological RCTs
[11]. Lack of a proper sham procedure is a major limi-
tation in all previous manual-therapy RCTs [12,13].
Recently, we developed a sham chiropractic spinal
manipulative therapy (CSMT) procedure, where par-
ticipants with migraine were unable to distinguish
between real and sham CSMT evaluated after each of
12 individual interventions over a 3-month period
[14].
The first objective of this study was to conduct a
manual-therapy three-armed, single-blinded, placebo
RCT for migraineurs with a methodological standard
similar to that of pharmacological RCTs.
The second objective was to assess the efficacy of
CSMT
versus
sham
manipulation
(placebo)
and
CSMT versus controls, i.e. participants who continued
their usual pharmacological management.
Methods
Study design
The study was a three-armed, single-blinded, placebo
RCT
over
17 months.
The
RCT
consisted
of
a
1-month baseline, 12 treatment sessions over 3 months
with follow-up measures at the end of intervention, 3,
6 and 12 months later.
Participants
were,
before
baseline,
randomized
equally into three groups: CSMT, placebo (sham
manipulation)
and
control
(continued
their
usual
pharmacological management).
The design of the study conformed to the recom-
mendations of the International Headache Society
(IHS) and CONSORT (Appendix S1) [1,15,16]. The
Norwegian Regional Committee for Medical Research
Ethics and the Norwegian Social Science Data Ser-
vices approved the project. The RCT was registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov (ID no: NCT01741714). The full
trial protocol has been published previously [17].
Participants
Participants were recruited from January to Septem-
ber
2013
primarily
through
the
Department
of
Neurology, Akershus University Hospital. Some par-
ticipants were also recruited through General Practi-
tioners from Akershus and Oslo Counties or media
advertisement. All participants received posted infor-
mation about the project followed by a telephone
interview.
Eligible
participants
were
migraineurs
of
18–
70 years old with at least one migraine attack per
month and were allowed to have concomitant tension-
type headache but no other primary headaches. All
participants were diagnosed by a chiropractor with
experience in headache diagnostics during the inter-
view and according to the International Classification
of Headache Disorders-II (ICHD-II) [2]. A neurolo-
gist had diagnosed all migraineurs from Akershus
University Hospital.
Exclusion criteria were contraindication to spinal
manipulative
therapy,
spinal
radiculopathy,
preg-
nancy, depression and CSMT within the previous
12 months. Participants who received manual therapy
[18], changed their prophylactic migraine medicine or
became pregnant during the RCT were informed that
they would be withdrawn from the study at that time
and regarded as drop-outs. Participants were allowed
to continue and change acute migraine medication
throughout the study period.
Eligible participants were invited to an interview
and physical assessment including meticulous spinal
column investigation by a chiropractor (A.C.). Partici-
pants randomized to the CSMT or the placebo group
had a full spine radiographic examination.
Randomization and masking
After written consent was obtained, participants were
equally randomized into one of the three study arms
by drawing one single lot. Numbered sealed lots with
the three study arms were each subdivided into four
subgroups
by
age
and
gender,
i.e.
18–39
or
40–70 years, and men or women.
After each treatment session, the participants in the
CSMT and the placebo group completed a question-
naire on whether they believed CSMT treatment was
received, and how certain they were that active treat-
ment was received on a 0–10 numeric rating scale,
where 10 represented absolute certainty [14].
Both the block randomization and the blinding ques-
tionnaire were exclusively administered by a single
external party.
Interventions
The CSMT group received spinal manipulative ther-
apy using the Gonstead method, a specific contact,
high-velocity, low-amplitude, short-lever spinal with
no post-adjustment recoil that was directed to spinal
biomechanical dysfunction (full spine approach) as
diagnosed by standard chiropractic tests at each indi-
vidual treatment session [19].
The placebo group received sham manipulation, a
broad non-specific contact, low-velocity, low-ampli-
tude sham push manoeuvre in a non-intentional and
non-therapeutic directional line of the lateral edge of
the scapula and/or the gluteal region [14]. All of the

 non-therapeutic contacts were performed outside the
spinal column with adequate joint slack and without
soft tissue pre-tension so that no joint cavitations
occurred. The sham manipulation alternatives were
pre-set and equally interchanged among the placebo
participants according to protocol during the 12-week
treatment period to strengthen the study validity. The
placebo procedure is described in detail in the avail-
able trial protocol [17].
Each intervention session lasted for 15 min and
both
groups
underwent
the
same
structural
and
motion assessments prior to and after each interven-
tion. No other intervention or advice was given to
participants during the trial period. Both groups
received interventions at Akershus University Hospital
by a single experienced chiropractor (A.C.).
The control group continued their usual pharmacolog-
ical management without receiving manual intervention
by the clinical investigator.
Outcomes
The participants filled in a validated diagnostic head-
ache diary throughout the study and returned them
on a monthly basis [20]. In the case of unreturned dia-
ries or missing data, the participants were contacted
by phone to secure compliance.
The primary end-point was number of migraine
days per month (30 days/month). At least 25% reduc-
tion of migraine days from baseline to end of inter-
vention, with the same level maintained at 3, 6 and
12 months follow-up was expected in the CSMT
group.
Secondary
end-points
were
migraine
duration,
migraine intensity and headache index (HI), and medi-
cine consumption. At least 25% reduction in duration,
intensity and HI, and at least 50% reduction in medi-
cine consumption were expected from baseline to end
of intervention, with the same level maintained at 3, 6
and 12 months follow-up in the CSMT group.
No change was expected for primary and secondary
end-point in the placebo and the control group.
A migraine day was defined as a day on which
migraine with aura, migraine without aura or probable
migraine occurred. Migraine attacks lasting for >24 h
were calculated as one attack unless pain-free intervals
of ≥48 h had occurred [21]. If a patient fell asleep dur-
ing a migraine attack and woke up without a migraine,
in accordance with the ICHD-III b, the duration of
the attack was recorded as persisting until the time of
awakening [22]. The minimum duration of a migraine
attack was 4 h unless a triptan or drug containing
ergotamine was used, in which case we specified no
minimum
duration.
HI
was
calculated
as
mean
migraine days per month (30 days) 9 mean migraine
duration
(h/day) 9 mean
intensity
(0–10 numeric
rating scale).
The primary and secondary end-points were chosen
based on the Task Force of the IHS Clinical Trial
Subcommittee’s clinical trial guidelines [1,15]. Based
on previous reviews on migraine, a 25% reduction
was considered to be a conservative estimate [12,13].
The outcome analyses were calculated during the
30 days after the last intervention session and 30 days
after
the
follow-up
time
points,
i.e.
3,
6
and
12 months, respectively.
All adverse events (AEs) were recorded after each
intervention in accordance with the recommendations
of CONSORT and the IHS Task Force on AEs in
migraine trials [16,23].
Statistical analysis
We based the power calculation on a recent study of
topiramate in migraineurs [24]. We hypothesized the
average difference in reduction of number of migraine
days per month between the active and the placebo,
and between the active and the control groups of
2.5 days, with SD of 2.5 for reduction in each group.
As primary analysis includes two group comparisons,
the significance level was set at 0.025. For the power
of 80%, a sample size of 20 patients was required in
each group to detect a significant difference in reduc-
tion of 2.5 days.
Patient characteristics at baseline were presented as
means and SD or frequencies and percentages in each
group and compared by independent samples t-test
and v2 test.
Time profiles of all end-points were compared
between the groups. Due to repeated measurements
for each patient, linear mixed models accounting for
the intra-individual variations were estimated for all
end-points. Fixed effects for (non-linear) time, group
allocation
and
interaction
between
the
two
were
included. Random effects for patients and slopes were
entered into the model. As the residuals were skewed,
the bootstrap inference based on 1000 cluster samples
was used. Pairwise comparisons were performed by
deriving individual time point contrasts within each
group at each time point with the corresponding
P-values and 95% confidence intervals. Medicine con-
sumption within groups was reported by mean doses
with SD, and groups were compared by an indepen-
dent samples median test. A dose was defined as a
single administration of a triptan or ergotamine;
paracetamol 1000 mg � codeine; non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (tolfenamic acid, 200 mg; diclofe-
nac, 50 mg; aspirin, 1000 mg; ibuprofen, 600 mg;

 naproxen, 500 mg); and morphinomimetics (tramadol,
50 mg). None of the patients changed study arm and
none of the drop-outs filled in headache diaries after
withdrawal from the study. Hence, only per protocol
analysis was relevant.
The analyses were blinded to treatment allocation
and
conducted
in
SPSS
v22
(IBM
Corporation,
Armonk, NY, USA) and STATA v14 (JSB) (Stata-
Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA). A significance
level of 0.025 was applied for the primary end-point,
whereas elsewhere a level of 0.05 was used.
Ethics
Good clinical practice guidelines were followed [25].
Oral and written information about the project was
provided in advance of inclusion and group alloca-
tion. Written consent was obtained from all partici-
pants. Participants in the placebo and control group
were promised CSMT treatment after the RCT, if the
active intervention was found to be effective. Insur-
ance was provided through the Norwegian System of
Compensation to Patients (Patient Injury Compensa-
tion), an independent national body that compensates
patients injured by treatments provided by the Norwe-
gian health service. A stopping rule was defined for
withdrawing participants from this study in accor-
dance with the recommendations in the CONSORT
extension for Better Reporting of Harms [26]. All AEs
were monitored during the intervention period and
acted on as they occurred according to the recommen-
dations of CONSORT and the IHS Task Force on
AEs in migraine trials [16,23]. In case of severe AE,
the participant would be withdrawn from the study
and referred to the General Practitioner or hospital
emergency department depending on the event. The
investigator (A.C.) was available by mobile phone at
any time throughout the study treatment period.
Results
Figure 1 shows a flow chart of the 104 migraineurs
included in the study. Baseline and demographic charac-
teristics were similar across the three groups (Table 1).
Outcome measures
The results on all end-points are presented in Fig. 2a–
d and Tables 2–4.
Primary end-point
Migraine days were significantly reduced within all
groups from baseline to post-treatment (P < 0.001).
The effect continued in the CSMT and the placebo
groups at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up, whereas
migraine days reverted to baseline level in the control
group (Fig. 2a). The linear mixed model showed no
overall significant differences in change in migraine
days between the CSMT and the placebo groups
(P = 0.04) or between the CSMT and the control
group (P = 0.06; Table 2). However, the pairwise com-
parisons at individual time points showed significant
differences between the CSMT and the control group
at all time points starting at post-treatment (Table 3).
Secondary end-points
There was a significant reduction from baseline to
post-treatment in migraine duration, intensity and HI
in the CSMT (P = 0.003, P = 0.002 and P < 0.001,
respectively) and the placebo (P < 0.001, P = 0.001
and P < 0.001, respectively) groups, and the effect
continued at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up.
The only significant differences between the CSMT
and control groups were change in migraine duration
(P = 0.02) and in HI (P = 0.04; Table 2).
At 12 months follow-up, change in consumption of
paracetamol was significantly lower in the CSMT
group as compared with the placebo (P = 0.04) and
control (P = 0.03) groups (Table 4).
Blinding
After each of the 12 intervention sessions, >80% of
the participants believed they had received CSMT
regardless of group allocation. The odds ratio for
believing that CSMT treatment was received was >10
at
all
treatment
sessions
in
both
groups
(all
P < 0.001).
Adverse effects
A total of 703 of the potential 770 intervention ses-
sions were assessed for AEs (355 in the CSMT group
and 348 in the placebo group). Reasons for missed
AE assessment were drop-out or missed intervention
sessions. AEs were significantly more frequent in the
CSMT than the placebo intervention sessions (83/355
vs. 32/348; P < 0.001). Local tenderness was the
most common AE reported by 11.3% (95% CI, 8.4–
15.0) in the CSMT group and 6.9% (95% CI, 4.7–
10.1) in the placebo group, whereas tiredness on the
intervention day and neck pain were reported by
8.5% and 2.0% (95% CI, 6.0–11.8 and 1.0–4.0), and
1.4% and 0.3% (95% CI, 0.6–3.3 and 0.1–1.9),
respectively. All other AEs (lower back pain, face
numbness, nausea, provoked migraine attack and
fatigue in arms) were rare (<1%). No severe or seri-
ous AEs were reported.

SPINAL MANIPULATIVE THERAPY FOR MIGRAINE
147
 Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first manual-therapy
RCT with a documented successful blinding. Our
three-armed, single-blinded, placebo RCT evaluated
the efficacy of CSMT in the treatment of migraine
versus
placebo
(sham
chiropractic)
and
control
(usual
pharmacological
treatment).
The
results
showed that migraine days were significantly reduced
within all three groups from baseline to post-treat-
ment. The effect continued in the CSMT and pla-
cebo groups at all follow-up time points, whereas

SPINAL MANIPULATIVE THERAPY FOR MIGRAINE

 three major obstacles as compared with pharmacologi-
cal RCTs. Firstly, it is impossible to blind the investi-
gator in relation to the applied treatment. Secondly,
consensus on an inert placebo treatment is lacking
[11]. Thirdly, previous attempts to include a placebo
group have omitted validating the blinding, thus, it
remains unknown whether active and placebo treat-
ment were concealed [27]. Due to these challenges we
decided
to
conduct
a
three-armed,
single-blinded
RCT, which also included a control group that con-
tinued usual pharmacological treatment in order to
obtain an indication of the magnitude of the placebo
response.
It has been suggested that, in pharmacological dou-
ble-blind placebo RCTs, only 50% will believe that
they receive active treatment in each group, if the
blinding is perfect. However, this may not be true in
manual-therapy RCTs, because the active and placebo
physical stimulus might be more convincing than a
tablet [28]. A single investigator reduces inter-investi-
gator variability by providing similar information to
all participants and it is generally recommended that

 the placebo intervention should resemble the active
treatment in terms of procedure, treatment frequency
and time spent with the investigator to allow for simi-
lar expectations in both groups [28]. The importance
of our successful blinding is emphasized by the fact
that all previous manual-therapy RCTs on headache
lack placebo. Thus, we believe that our results dis-
cussed below are valid at the same level as a pharma-
cological RCT [14].
Prospective data are more reliable than retrospec-
tive data in terms of recall bias; however, non-compli-
ance can be a challenge, especially at the end of the
study. We believe the frequent contact between partic-
ipants and the investigator, including monthly contact
in the follow-up period, probably maintained high
compliance throughout our study.
Although our study sample ended with 104 partici-
pants in the three groups, the power calculation
assumption and the high completion rate support the
data achieved being valid for the investigated popula-
tion. The Gonstead method is used by 59% of chiro-
practors [19] and, thus, the results are generalizable for
the profession. Diagnostic certainty is one of our major
strengths as nearly all of the participants had been diag-
nosed by a neurologist according to the ICHD-II [2]. In
contrast to previous chiropractic migraine RCTs that
recruited participants through media such as newspa-
pers and radio advertisement [12], the majority of our
participants were recruited from the Department of
Neurology, Akershus University Hospital, indicating
that the migraineurs may have more frequent/severe
attacks that are difficult to treat than the general popu-
lation, as they were referred by their General Practi-
tioner and/or practicing neurologist. Thus, our study is
representative of primarily the tertiary clinic popula-
tion, and the outcome might have been different if
participants had been recruited from the general popu-
lation. The percentage of neck pain has been found to
be high in patients with migraine [29] and, thus, the
high percentage of non-radicular spinal pain in our
study might be a confounder for which effect was seen
on migraine days.
Three pragmatic chiropractic manual-therapy RCTs
using the diversified technique have previously been
conducted for migraineurs [12,30–32]. An Australian
RCT showed within-group reduction in migraine fre-
quency, duration and intensity of 40%, 43% and
36%, respectively, at 2 months follow-up [30]. An
American study found migraine frequency and inten-
sity to reduce within-group by 33% and 42%, respec-
tively, at 1 month follow-up [31]. Another Australian
study, which was the only RCT to include a control
group, i.e. detuned ultrasound, found a within-group
reduction of migraine frequency and duration of 35%
and 40%, respectively, at 2 months follow-up in the
CSMT
group,
as
compared
with
a
within-group
reduction of 17% and 20% in the control group,
respectively [32]. The reduction in migraine days was
similar to ours (40%) in the CSMT group from base-
line to 3 months follow-up, whereas migraine dura-
tion and intensity were less reduced at 3 months
follow-up, i.e. 21% and 14%, respectively. Long-term
follow-up comparisons are impossible as neither of
the previous studies included a sufficient follow-up
period. Our study design including strong internal
validity allows us to interpret the effect seen as a
placebo response.
Our RCT had fewer AEs as compared with previ-
ous manual-therapy studies, but of similar transient
and mild character [33–39]. However, it was not suffi-
ciently powered to detect uncommon serious AEs. In
comparison, AEs in pharmacological migraine pro-
phylactic
placebo
RCTs
are
common
including
non-mild and non-transient AEs [40,41].
Conclusion
The blinding was strongly sustained throughout the
RCT, AEs were few and mild, and the effect in the
CSMT and placebo group was probably a placebo
response. Because some migraineurs do not tolerate
medication because of AEs or co-morbid disorders,
CSMT might be considered in situations where other
therapeutic options are ineffective or poorly tolerated.
