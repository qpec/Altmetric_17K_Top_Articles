Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants. The major risk factor for GBS
disease is maternal and subsequent infant colonisation. It is unknown whether human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) protect
against GBS colonisation. HMO production is genetically determined and linked to the Lewis antigen system. We aimed to
investigate the association between HMOs and infant GBS colonisation between birth and postnatal day 90. Rectovaginal swabs
were collected at delivery, as well as colostrum/breast milk, infant nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs at birth, 6 days and days
60–89 postpartum from 183 Gambian mother/infant pairs. GBS colonisation and serotypes were determined using culture and
PCR. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to characterise the mother’s Lewis status and HMO profile in breast
milk. Mothers who were Lewis-positive were significantly less likely to be colonised by GBS (X2 = 12.50, Po0.001). Infants of
Lewis-positive mothers were less likely GBS colonised at birth (X2 = 4.88 P = 0.03) and more likely to clear colonisation between
birth and days 60–89 than infants born to Lewis-negative women (P = 0.05). There was no association between Secretor status
and GBS colonisation. In vitro work revealed that lacto-N-difucohexaose I (LNDFHI) correlated with a reduction in the growth of
GBS. Our results suggest that HMO such as LNDFHI may be a useful adjunct in reducing maternal and infant colonisation and
hence invasive GBS disease. Secretor status offers utility as a stratification variable in GBS clinical trials.

Streptococcus agalacticae (Group B Streptococcus (GBS)) is a Gram-
positive bacterium that colonises the maternal gastrointestinal tract
and vagina.1 GBS is the leading cause of infection in the first 3 months
of life in the United Kingdom2 and United States of America3 and is
increasingly described as a major cause of infection in Sub-Saharan
Africa.4–6 GBS is vertically transmitted to approximately 50% of
neonates born to colonised mothers and causes pneumonia, sepsis
and/or meningitis in approximately 1–2% of these infants in the first 3
postnatal months.7 Maternal and subsequent infant colonisation
precedes invasive disease.8
In order to resist infection, the neonate is initially reliant on
maternal
protection,
primarily
via
transplacentally
derived
immunoglobulin G (IgG). However, IgG mainly provides protection
once a pathogen has already entered the blood stream.9 In addition
to maternally derived IgG in blood, breast-fed infants obtain
protection against various pathogens through many bioactive factors
in breast milk.10 Breast feeding is important for neonatal health
and decreases infant susceptibility to gastrointestinal and respiratory
tract infections, botulism and necrotising enterocolitis, and reduces
mortality.9,11,12
Protection by breast milk occurs primarily at the mucosal surface
from factors including secretory IgA and human milk oligosaccharides
(HMOs).9,13 HMOs are soluble complex carbohydrates. The biosynth-
esis of HMO structures is known to depend on maternal genotype,
including the genes that determine the Lewis blood group antigen,
which regulates the expression and activity of several different
glycosyltransferase enzymes in the mammary tissue. These determine
different HMO profiles and their concentrations in breast milk.14–17
For example, a fucosyltransferase enzyme, FUT3, dependent on Lewis
gene expression, attaches fucose in an α1–3 or α1–4 linkage,
elongating the HMO chain and producing different types of HMOs,
depending on the links between the monosaccharides and their
stereochemical configuration.17 Similarly, an additional group of
HMOs, including 2′-fucosyllactose (2′-FL), is only synthesised if the
woman has an active copy of the Secretor gene (FUT2) and therefore
expresses
the
α1–2-fucosylatransferease
enzyme,
responsible
for
synthesising 2′-FL, as well as other structurally similar HMOs.15
Once ingested by the infant, multiple functions have been attributed
to HMOs, including the ability to inhibit the adherence of pathogens
to the intestinal epithelium. By acting as decoy receptors and thereby

 preventing pathogen attachment to host cells, HMOs inhibit invasion
and subsequent infection.18 For example, Campylobacter jejuni is less
likely to infect infants of mothers whose breast milk contains high
concentrations of the HMO 2′-FL.13
The Lewis blood group type of children in Burkina Faso and
Nicaragua is associated with susceptibility to and incidence of rotavirus
infection owing to host phenotype and pathogen genotype. These
observations provide an explanation for the reduced efficacy of the live
oral rotavirus vaccine in Africa.19 Similarly, an observational study in
the United States found severe rotavirus gastroenteritis to be absent in
non-secretor children, providing important evidence into the epide-
miology of this infection and the likely efficacy of vaccination in
different populations.20
Several in vivo studies have also identified the ability of HMOs to
reduce Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation of the oropharynx.21
HMOs also provide a source of energy for the non-pathogenic
intestinal microbiota,22 thus preventing infection by allowing the
microbiota to outcompete potential pathogenic organisms.23,24
Because of these beneficial effects, it has been proposed that HMOs
could be used therapeutically, for example, as an adjunct to standard
antibiotics.25,26
HMO research to date has primarily focused on the antiadhesive
effects against gut viruses and bacteria in vitro. Work of other
investigators indicates that GBS is unable to proliferate in the presence
of specific HMO in vitro,26 with certain non-sialylated HMOs
identified as possessing a bacteriostatic effect against GBS. Further
in vitro investigation revealed that GBS uses a glycosyltransferase,
which incorporates HMOs into the cell membrane, preventing
bacterial proliferation. This mechanism of action is similar to various
classes of antibiotic. Furthermore, a GBS mutant lacking the gene
encoding for this glycosyltransferase enzyme was found to be non-
susceptible to the bacteriostatic effects of HMOs.26
We used 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to
test the hypothesis that the type and quantity of HMOs in breast milk
influences GBS colonisation status in mothers and their breast-fed
infants. Furthermore, we used an in vitro challenge model to identify
which HMOs were associated with reduction in GBS growth.
RESULTS
Metabolic phenotyping of breast milk HMOs
The principal component analysis score plots indicated milk samples
were dominated by variance mainly arising from the different
fucosylated HMOs, in particular 2′-FL, 3′-fucosyllactose (3′-FL),
lacto-N-difucohexaose
I
(LNDFHI),
lacto-N-difucohexaose
II
(LNDFHII), lacto-N-fucopentaose I, lacto-N-fucopentaose III and
lactodifucotetraose. Fucosylated HMOs were present in different
abundances in the breast milk of different mothers and are indicated
in the spectra provided in Figures 1 and 2. Statistical total correlation
spectroscopic plots provided more detailed structural definition for
each of the HMO (Supplementary Figure S1).
In the colostrum samples (n = 109), 70% of mothers were identified
as Secretors and 30% were identified as non-Secretors. Similarly, 68%
of mothers were identified as Lewis positive and 32% were identified
as Lewis negative. Non-Secretor mothers appeared to compensate for
not producing 2′-fucosylated oligosaccharides by producing an
increased quantity of 3′-fucosylactose. Colostrum sample composition
was not associated with maternal ethnicity, weight, age, gravida, infant
sex or weight at birth or 3 months postpartum, as determined by
orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS).
Comparing the spectral region containing fucosylated HMOs long-
itudinally, the HMO profiles remained the same between time points.
However, colostrum samples had higher quantities of HMOs in
comparison to breast milk (Figure 3).

 Association between HMO profiles and GBS colonisation
We observed a significant negative association between maternal
Lewis-positive (Le+) phenotype and maternal GBS colonisation at
delivery and for infant GBS colonisation at birth (Table 1). However,
this association was not observed for infants at days 60–89, possibly
owing to the low numbers of infants colonised at this time point
(n = 19; Table 1).
In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference between
maternal or infant GBS colonisation at birth or at days 60–89 between
Secretor (Se+) and non-Secretor (Se − ) mothers (Table 2).
When combining mothers into milk groups dependent on their
Le/Se status, mothers in milk group 3 (Se+/Le − ) were more likely to
be GBS colonised than any other milk group (X2 = 16.57, Po0.001,
Tables 3 and 4). Infants of mothers in milk group 3 were also more
likely to be colonised at birth (Tables 3 and 4).
Specific HMO types and GBS colonisation in infants and in breast
milk
We observed a negative correlation between the relative concentration
of
3′-FL
and
infant
GBS
colonisation
(colony-forming
units
(CFU) ml − 1) at birth, (n = 27, R = − 0.54, P = 0.004). There was
also a positive correlation between the relative concentration of
2′-fucosyllated oligosaccharides (associated with Se positivity) and infant
GBS colonisation (CFU ml− 1) at birth (n= 27, R=0.45, P= 0.02).
A similar negative correlation was observed for the concentration of
GBS in breast milk and relative concentration of 3′-FL (n = 10,
R = − 0.66, P = 0.04). Likewise, 2′-fucosyllated oligosaccharides and
GBS abundance in breast milk correlated positively, nearing signifi-
cance (n = 10, R = 0.59, P = 0.07; Supplementary Tables S1–S3;
Supplementary Figures S5 and S6).
Clearance of colonisation between birth and day 6 or between birth
and days 60–89 was associated with peaks at 1.29 (F= 1.29, P = 0.12),
5.03 (F= 2.62, P = 0.05), δ 5.16 (F= 2.09, P = 0.10), all corresponding
to the HMO LNDFHI, which is associated with the Lewis antigen
group and only produced by mothers who are both Le+/Se+.
HMOs and GBS growth in vitro
Presence of LNDFHI and other similar branched HMOs in breast milk
were associated with a 50% reduction in GBS growth in vitro
(X2 = 2.05, P = 0.048). Table 5 displays the Pearson correlation
coefficients between peak heights and difference in CFU ml − 1 over
24 h.
These breast milk originated from women who were both GBS
colonised and uncolonised (12 GBS-colonised, 28 GBS-uncolonised at
delivery).
DISCUSSION
Our study findings suggest that Lewis phenotype and its related HMOs
in breast milk are strongly associated with inhibition of GBS
colonisation in the mother and a reduced risk of transmission to
the infant. In addition, we demonstrate that clearance of colonisation
in infants is associated with certain HMOs.
We demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on GBS growth in vivo
and in vitro with certain HMO structures associated with Lewis gene
activity, primarily LNDFHI and other similar branched HMOs
produced only by Le+/Se+ mothers. Furthermore, the HMO 3′-FL
was inversely correlated with the abundance of GBS in both infants
and breast milk. Our in vitro results also suggest a bacteriostatic role
for these HMOs against GBS that may be clinically meaningful.
Taken together, our results indicate that LNDFHI and other similar
branched HMOs are able to inhibit the growth of GBS. Similar results
have been reported in a recent study by Bode et al.,26 although the
details of the specific HMOs involved are not mentioned. Our results
indicate a possible role for specific HMOs in the prevention and
clearance of maternal GBS colonisation during pregnancy. Once
additional studies have been undertaken to validate these results,
and definitively identify the HMO(s) involved in protection against
GBS disease, a clinical application could be to use HMOs as a potential
adjuvant to antibiotics for the treatment of GBS colonisation.
In the clinical context, it may be possible to supplement Lewis-
negative mothers with synthetic LNDFHI and other similar branched
HMOs during pregnancy and lactation. This supplementation could
‘convert’ the mother’s Lewis group, in an attempt to reduce the
incidence of maternal GBS colonisation, and hence reduce the vertical
transmission to their neonates. This supplementation has recently
become feasible owing to advances in bioengineering, allowing for
various HMOs to be synthesised using whole-cell biocatalysis.27

 Likewise, these HMOs, particularly LNDFHI and 3′-FL, could be
provided to infants of non-Lewis positive mothers colonised with GBS,
in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of the infant becoming
colonised with GBS.
The percentage of Secretor mothers found in the present study
closely reflects the results of a previous study conducted in The
Gambia, which reported 73% of mothers as Secretors.28 There is
considerable variation in HMO type and abundance globally.29 The
higher proportion of Lewis-positive mothers and lower proportion of
Secretor mothers in Asia might account for differences observed in
GBS colonisation here, although this is speculative at present.
Our study has several limitations. First, we were unable to quantify
exact HMO concentrations owing to the binding of the TSP standard
to proteins, which remained in the milk, affecting the TSP concentra-
tion and therefore the reference value. To account for this, we used the
intensity of the HMO peaks in the spectra, which are directly related to
the concentration of these molecules. Second, a further difficulty was
the extensive overlap in the 1H NMR spectra regions of HMOs,
making identification of further HMOs difficult. This was partially
accounted for by using statistical total correlation spectroscopy, but
implementation of more sensitive analytical techniques such as mass
spectrometry may be better suited for this task. Finally, we did not
stratify the in vitro results according to maternal GBS colonisation
status. The focus of the functional assay was to assess HMO activity on
GBS in vitro and a sample size of 40 (12 colonised women) would be
too small to infer results. In subsequent studies, we would seek to
assess a larger cohort of colonised women expressing each of the
HMOs of interest. Fuelled by the increasing concerns about the effect
of antibiotics on the infant microbiome as well as driving antimicro-
bial resistance, it is increasingly important that alternative methods of
preventing maternal and infant colonisation with GBS are identified.
We have demonstrated in vivo and in vitro that specific HMOs
associated with the Lewis and Secretor phenotype can inhibit GBS
growth. Establishing whether specific HMOs are an effective adjunct to
prevent colonisation in the pregnant woman and thus transfer of GBS
peri-partum to her infant would be an important advance. In addition,
we suggest that Lewis and Secretor phenotypes offer potential as
stratification variables in clinical trials.
Mothers undergo blood tests in pregnancy to determine blood
group. If those mothers who are Lewis negative are at increased risk of
GBS colonisation, this simple blood test could be used to identify this
group and enable supplementation throughout pregnancy. By redu-
cing the burden of maternal, and therefore infant, colonisation, HMOs
may be a low cost, non-invasive first step in reducing the burden of
neonatal GBS disease globally.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was nested in a larger study in The Gambia aimed to determine the
association between GBS colonisation and maternally derived antibody.
Methods for recruitment, sample collection and microbiological investigation
have been previously described.6
Maternal GBS status was obtained for mothers at delivery, while infants' GBS
status was determined at delivery, as well as at postnatal day 6 and 60–89 days.
Infants were exclusively breast fed throughout the study period. Women were
excluded from the study if they had used antibiotics within 4 weeks of labour.
None of the infants were exposed to antibiotics during the study period.

Clinical & Translational Immunology
 One hundred and eighty-three mothers and their infants were included in
the study. One hundred and nine colostrum samples, 61 breast milk samples
from day 6 postpartum and 63 breast milk samples collected at 3 months
postpartum were analysed. Differences in sample size between time points is
due to the fact that some women were unable to donate a breast milk sample at
each time point.
Sample size
Based on results from the original study where 33.7% of women were GBS
colonised and 52% of mothers transferred GBS to their infant (17.5% infants
colonised) and Secretor status of 70%,28 a sample size of 180 women would be
required to give 126 Secretor-positive women. One hundred and eighty
mothers would allow at least 10 mothers in each of the 4 milk groups and
give 80% power to detect a correlation of ⩾70% between HMOs and
colonisation.
Research ethics
This project was approved by The Gambia Government/MRC Joint ethics
committee (Ref SCC 1350v3). Prior to enrolment, participants who met the
inclusion criteria gave either written consent or, if illiterate, a thumb print,
witnessed by an impartial witness.
Colostrum and breast milk sample preparation
Mothers were provided with soap and asked to wash their hands and wipe their
breasts with alcohol wipes before hand-expressing a colostrum/milk sample
within the first 12 h after birth, at day 6 and between days 60 and 89. From
each breast 2–3 ml of colostrum and 4–5 ml of breast milk was collected before
mothers fed their infants. Milk was collected in sterile containers and
immediately refrigerated at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 3000 g for
30 min to remove lipids. Samples were frozen within 4 h of collection at
− 70 °C. A modified Folch extraction30 previously validated for use with breast
milk samples was used to further remove lipids and protein from samples.31,32
Finally, samples were transferred to 5 mm NMR capillary tubes for analysis.
Quality control samples were prepared by pooling 50 μl of each sample and
prepared in the same manner as the study samples.
1H NMR spectroscopic analysis
A Bruker 600MHz spectrometer (Coventry, UK) was used to acquire spectral
data. Each sample underwent a standard 1D pulse sequence to achieve water
suppression using acquisition pulse sequence using the first increment of the
NOE parameters defined in Dona et al.33 and a Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill
pulse sequence33 at a probe temperature of 300 and 310 K, respectively at the
Clinical Phenome Centre at Imperial College. Spectra were acquired using 4
dummy scans and 32 scans.
Preprocessing of spectral data
Spectral data were imported into MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA),
referencing the chemical shifts (δ) to glucose (α anomeric, δ 5.24). Regions
containing the water and TSP resonance were removed from the spectra. Peak
alignment was performed using recursive segment-wise peak alignment,34 and
data were normalised using probabilistic quotient normalisation (median fold
change normalisation).35
Functional assay for GBS growth in breast milk
Breast milk from 40 mothers with different HMO profiles, as determined from
the 1H NMR breast milk profiles, were selected and cultured with GBS to assess
the effects of HMOs on the growth of GBS in vitro. Frozen stock of GBS STIII
bacteria (COH-1, kind donation from Carol Baker) was defrosted and grown in
Todd Hewitt Broth made selective with colistin and naladixic acid until an
OD600mm of 1 (1 × 107 bacteria) was reached. In all, 100 μl of GBS was pipetted
into a 96-well plate containing 10 μl of breast milk, and 10 μl of this
preparation was plated directly onto Colombia agar (T0 sample). The
remainder was incubated overnight prior to streaking onto Colombia agar.
The following day, CFU were manually counted from the T0 samples and the
overnight plated samples (T24). Each assay was performed in duplicate and the
mean CFU ml− 1 was used for analysis.
Statistical analysis
Data were imported into SIMCA 14.1 (Umetrics, Malmo, Sweden) for
multivariate statistical analysis using principal component analysis and OPLS.
The logged bacterial abundances were used as the Y variable for the OPLS
analysis. Pareto scaling was applied in order to scale the data. Robustness of the
models was assessed by leaving every seventh sample out and back predicting
into the model, and by permutation testing over 100 iterations where sample
class labels are scrambled and the predictivity of model compared with the
correctly classified model in order to establish the likelihood of obtaining the
same statistical values by chance. Metabolites were identified based on their δ
and peak splitting, comparing these with the literature and the Human
Metabolome Database (http://www.hmdb.ca/). Statistical total correlation
spectroscopy was used to aid in the assignment of the HMOs.36
Mothers were grouped into five milk groups based on their HMO profile,
according to groupings described in Pratico et al.,37 plus an additional two milk
groups detected in this study. Maternal Secretor status (Se) (mothers possessing
an active FUT2 gene) was determined based on the presence or absence of
peaks corresponding to 2′-FL and other structurally similar HMOs (containing
an α1–2 linkage of fucose to the Galb(a1–3)GlcNAc unit of the oligosaccharide
chain) in the 1H NMR spectra (δ 1.22–1.25). Maternal Lewis status (Le)
(mothers possessing an active FUT3 gene) was determined based on the
presence or absence of peaks corresponding to LNDFHI and LNDFHII
in the
1H NMR spectra (δ 5.02–5.04). Mothers’ breast milk containing
α1,3-fucosylated oligosaccharides was determined by the presence or absence
of peaks at δ 1.14–1.20 (Supplementary Table S4).
Breast milk from milk group 1, Secretor positive/Lewis positive (Se+/Le+),
contained all classes of fucosylated oligosaccharides, breast milk from milk
group 2 (Se − /Le+) did not contain α1,2-fucosylated structures (2′-fucosyllac-
tose, lactodifucotetraose, lacto-N-fucopentaose I and LNDFHI), while indivi-
duals in milk group 3 (Se+/Le − ) contained α1,2- and α1,3-fucosylated
oligosaccharides but not lacto-N-fucopentaose II, LNDFHI and LNDFHII,
characterised by α1,4-fucose linkages. Breast milk from mothers in breast milk
group 4 did not contain either α1,2-fucosylated oligosaccharides or α1,4-
fucosylated oligosaccharides (Se − /Le − ). In addition to these groups, a final
group was assigned, milk group 5, where mothers did not produce any
fucosylated HMOs at all, including 3′-FL.
For the functional assay for GBS growth in breast milk, the T24 concentra-
tion was subtracted from the T0 concentration to give a reduction in
CFU ml − 1 for each sample.
GBS abundance showed skewed distributions, therefore log transformations
were performed. To determine whether any associations existed between HMO
profiles and GBS colonisation, two-way Pearson correlations were performed
on logged bacterial abundances, correlated against the intensity value calculated
from peak height at the apex of peaks at δ = 1.15, 1.18, 1.23, 1.27, 1.29, 5.03,
5.13, 5.16, 5.27 and 5.40, corresponding to multiple HMOs.38
Chi-square tests were performed to determine whether any association
between maternal Secretor (Se) or Lewis status (Le) and maternal and infant
GBS colonisation occurred.
Univariate statistical analyses were completed using SPSS version 22 (IBM,
Armonk, NY, USA) and Stata V12 (Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA).
P-values o0.05 were considered significant. Individuals in milk group 5 were
not included in the analysis as there were only two mothers in this group.
