BACKGROUND: With advances in antiretroviral therapy, most deaths 
in people with HIV are now attributable to noncommunicable illnesses, 
especially cardiovascular disease. We determine the association between 
HIV and cardiovascular disease, and estimate the national, regional, and 
global burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to HIV.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review across 5 databases from 
inception to August 2016 for longitudinal studies of cardiovascular disease in 
HIV infection. A random-effects meta-analysis across 80 studies was used to 
derive the pooled rate and risk of cardiovascular disease in people living with 
HIV. We then estimated the temporal changes in the population-attributable 
fraction and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) from HIV-associated 
cardiovascular disease from 1990 to 2015 at a regional and global level. 
National cardiovascular DALYs associated with HIV for 2015 were derived for 
154 of the 193 United Nations member states. The main outcome measure 
was the pooled estimate of the rate and risk of cardiovascular disease in 
people living with HIV and the national, regional, and global estimates of 
DALYs from cardiovascular disease associated with HIV.
RESULTS: In 793 
635 people living with HIV and a total follow-up of 3.5 
million person-years, the crude rate of cardiovascular disease was 61.8 (95% 
CI, 45.8–83.4) per 10 
000 person-years. In comparison with individuals 
without HIV, the risk ratio for cardiovascular disease was 2.16 (95% CI, 1.68–
2.77). Over the past 26 years, the global population–attributable fraction 
from cardiovascular disease attributable to HIV increased from 0.36% (95% 
CI, 0.21%–0.56%) to 0.92% (95% CI, 0.55%–1.41%), and DALYs increased 
from 0.74 (95% CI, 0.44–1.16) to 2.57 (95% CI, 1.53–3.92) million. There 
was marked regional variation with most DALYs lost in sub-Saharan Africa 
(0.87 million, 95% CI, 0.43–1.70) and the Asia Pacific (0.39 million, 95% CI, 
0.23–0.62) regions. The highest population-attributable fraction and burden 
were observed in Swaziland, Botswana, and Lesotho.
CONCLUSIONS: People living with HIV are twice as likely to develop 
cardiovascular disease. The global burden of HIV-associated cardiovascular 
disease has tripled over the past 2 decades and is now responsible for 2.6 
million DALYs per annum with the greatest impact in sub-Saharan Africa and 
the Asia Pacific regions.

urrently, >35 million people are infected with HIV, 
with two-thirds being resident in sub-Saharan Af-
rica.1 Although the global incidence for HIV has 
stabilized, the provision and widespread distribution 
of combined antiretroviral therapy2 has dramatically 
improved survival with the prevalence of HIV steadily 
increasing over the past 2 decades.3 This improvement 
in survival has been primarily attributed to a reduction 
in opportunistic infections, especially in the low- and 
middle-income nations.1,4 Indeed, most deaths now 
arise from noncommunicable illnesses, especially car-
diovascular disease.5–7
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mor-
bidity and mortality worldwide.8,9 The past 2 decades 
have seen a substantial increase in the morbidity at-
tributable to cardiovascular disease, with a significant 
proportion of the burden borne by low- and middle-
income nations.10,11 The highest prevalence rates of HIV 
have been observed in sub-Saharan Africa. This region 
has also seen a steady increase in the burden of car-
diovascular disease over the past 2 decades.2,12 Recent 
studies have shown a link between the development of 
cardiovascular disease and HIV infection with multiple 
potential mechanisms, including direct vascular inflam-
mation,13,14 dyslipidemia,15 and insulin resistance.16,17
The aim of this systematic analysis was to review and 
to meta-analyze the rate of cardiovascular disease in 
people living with HIV, to determine the association be-
tween HIV infection and the risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease, and to estimate the national, regional, and global 
burden of HIV-associated cardiovascular disease.
METHODS
Data and the corresponding R analysis code will be available 
at https://github.com/anoopsshah/hiv_cvd.
Databases, Sources, and Searches
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Cumulative 
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of 
Science by using the following key words: myocardial infarc-
tion, stroke, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular dis-
ease, and HIV (Text I in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Bibliographic reference lists of studies selected for inclusion in 
our meta-analysis and relevant review articles were manually 
searched (Figure 1). We limited our search to studies pub-
lished between 1948 and August 30, 2016.
Selection of Articles, Extraction of Data, 
and Data Synthesis
All longitudinal studies, including case-control, cohort, and 
randomized controlled trials, were included. There were no 
language restrictions, and only peer-reviewed original articles 
were included. Many studies provided data on the same 
cohort at extended follow-up time points. In such cases, 
we selected the published study with the longest follow-up 
period. Data were extracted independently, and any discrep-
ancies were adjudicated by 4 investigators (A.S.V.S., D.S., 
K.K.L., and S.A.). We contacted authors for additional data 
or clarification where required. The study methodology, 
results, and presentation were conducted as per the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
guidelines (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).18
Crude Rate
The pooled incident crude rates of cardiovascular disease 
studies were only included if they provided the number of 
cardiovascular events (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction 
or stroke) and the follow-up period. Crude incidence rates 
were pooled per 10 
000 person-years and presented for all 
incident cardiovascular events and deaths. The analysis was 
substratified by etiology classified as either myocardial infarc-
tion or cerebrovascular disease, where applicable.
Risk Ratio
For estimating the pooled risk ratios of cardiovascular dis-
ease, cases were defined as any hospitalization with, 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Recent studies have identified plausible biological 
mechanisms, including endothelial dysfunction and 
arterial inflammation, to explain the association 
between HIV infection and atherosclerotic disease.
• This article represents a systematic analysis to evalu-
ate the association between HIV and cardiovascular 
disease and estimate the burden of HIV-associated 
cardiovascular disease at a national, regional, and 
global level.
• We report that the risk of cardiovascular disease 
is increased 2-fold in people living with HIV, and 
the global burden of HIV-associated cardiovascular 
disease has tripled over the past 2 decades with the 
majority of the burden experienced in sub-Saharan 
Africa and the Asia Pacific region.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• The combined burden of HIV and cardiovascular 
disease, especially in high-prevalence regions, has 
important implications with respect to regional 
health policies, guidelines, and resource allocation.
• Risk stratification and identification of patients at 
risk of future cardiovascular disease are already 
challenging in these regions.
• Whether patients living with HIV should be consid-
ered high-risk and appropriate primary prevention 
pharmacotherapy such as statin therapy should be 
implemented remains unclear.
• Our estimates have important policy implica-
tions for implementing appropriate cardiovascular 
risk stratification and treatment strategies across 
healthcare systems, especially in low- and middle-
income nations where both HIV and cardiovascular 
disease remain highly prevalent.

or mortality from, cardiovascular events (fatal or nonfa-
tal myocardial infarction or stroke) in individuals with and 
without HIV. Studies were also included if the outcome was 
defined as a cardiovascular event and included but was not 
exclusive to myocardial infarction or stroke. Risk ratio esti-
mates for disease incidence and case fatality for cardiovas-
cular events in HIV-infected populations in comparison with 
populations not infected by HIV were pooled and presented 
with 95% CIs.
Pooled risk ratio estimates were assessed for publication 
bias by visually assessing funnel plots and for asymmetry by 
using the Egger regression test.19 The trim-and-fill method 
was used to adjust for selection bias attributable to poten-
tial unpublished studies or bias attributable to small-study 
effects.20 Sensitivity analysis was performed by removing stud-
ies where adjustment for important confounders was omitted 
(Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). Across both the 
pooled rate and risk ratios, subgroup analysis was only per-
formed where ≥3 estimates were available. Studies providing 
estimates for the risk ratio were further stratified by type of 
event and publication year.
Regional and Global Estimates for HIV 
Prevalence and Cardiovascular Disability-
Adjusted Life-Years
Global and regional estimates of cardiovascular disease attrib-
utable to HIV were derived annually from 1990 to 2015.
Cardiovascular Disability-Adjusted Life-Years 
National disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) estimates for car-
diovascular disease (consisting of the sum of DALYs attrib-
utable to ischemic heart disease and stroke) were available 
from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. Countries 
were grouped into Joint United Nations Programme on 
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) regions (Table III in the online-only Data 
Supplement). The DALYs for cardiovascular disease in each 
country were summed to derive the regional cardiovascular 
burden. These data were available at 5-year intervals, from 
1990 to 2015, with intervening years obtained via linear 
interpolation.
Regional Prevalence of HIV
Prevalence estimates for HIV were available from 1990 to 
2015, for the population from 15 to 49 years of age, from 
UNAIDS at a global and regional level.
Population-Attributable Fraction and 
HIV-Attributable Cardiovascular DALYs
At the global and regional levels, we applied the HIV preva-
lence estimates for the 15- to 49-year age group across the 
entire adult population. As such, the calculated population-
attributable fraction was applied to the entire adult popula-
tion when calculating the cardiovascular DALYs attributable 
to HIV at global and regional levels.
National Estimates for HIV Prevalence 
and Cardiovascular DALYs
National estimates of HIV prevalence and cardiovascular bur-
den were available from 160 and 179 countries, respectively, 
of the 193 United Nations member states, and both were 
available from 154 countries. National HIV prevalence esti-
mates were available for the >15-years age group for 2016, 
and national DALY estimates for cardiovascular disease were 
available for 2015.
We also calculated estimates of burden in the nations with 
a high HIV prevalence by combining data for the UNAIDS-
defined 21 Global Plan priority countries (Table III in the 
online-only Data Supplement).21,22 National-level data for 
cardiovascular DALYs for 2015 and HIV prevalence for 2016 
were available for 20 of the 21 Global Plan priority countries 
(Table III in the online-only Data Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Using the pooled risk ratio for cardiovascular disease in 
people living with HIV and the prevalence of HIV, we esti-
mated the population-attributable risk fraction at national, 
regional, and global levels. At regional and global levels, 
we further estimated the yearly changes in attributable risk 
to take into account temporal changes in the population 
prevalence of HIV. The population-attributable fraction for 
HIV for cardiovascular disease was calculated as described 
previously:23,24

We anticipated heterogeneity between studies when esti-
mating both the crude incidence rates and the risk ratio 
because of different study designs, methods of analysis and 
varying adjustment, and geographical and population differ-
ences. We therefore used a random-effects model with the 
maximum likelihood estimator to account for both within- 
and between-study heterogeneity.25 Heterogeneity, when 
estimating the pooled estimate of the risk ratio, was exam-
ined using the standard I2 test. Publication or small-study 
bias was assessed using the regression test, and the trim-
and-fill method was used for correcting funnel plot asymme-
try. Risk of bias was assessed at a study level according to the 
level of adjustment undertaken (Table II in the online-only 
Data Supplement). Studies at low risk of bias were defined 
if adjustment of age, sex, and at least 1 other covariate was 
undertaken. Moderate risk was defined as adjustment of at 
least age or sex, and studies were classified as high-risk if 
no adjustment was undertaken. Full statistical methods are 
explained in the online-only Data Supplement (Text II in the 
online-only Data Supplement, Figure IA and IB in the online-
only Data Supplement). All analyses were performed in R 
Version 3.2.3 with the estimates derived using the meta-
for package. Statistical significance was taken as a 2-sided 
P<0.05.
RESULTS
A total of 80 studies were identified to estimate the rate 
and risk ratio of cardiovascular disease in people living 
with HIV. One hundred twenty-two estimates from 73 
studies were used to calculate the pooled crude inci-
dent rates of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease 
in people living with HIV (Table IV in the online-only

Data Supplement; Figure 1). This comprised 793 
635 
people with HIV and a total follow-up of 3.5 million 
person-years. The crude incidence rate for cardiovas-
cular disease per 10 
000 person-years was 61.8 (95% 
CI, 45.8–83.4). When stratified by incident myocardi-
al infarction and stroke, the rate was 25.9 (95% CI, 
20.3–33.0) and 17.9 (95% CI, 13.2–24.3), respectively 
(Figure IIA through IIC in the online-only Data Supple-
ment). The cardiovascular mortality rate was 14.1 per 
10 
000 person-years (95% CI, 10.3–19.4) (Figure IID 
through IIF in the online-only Data Supplement). Of 
the 122 estimates, only 12 (9.8%) estimates (across 
11 studies) provided information on crude rates in the 
non-HIV population (Table V in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
A further 17 estimates from 16 studies were identi-
fied to estimate the pooled risk ratio of incident cardio-
vascular disease in individuals with HIV infection (Table, 
Figure 2B). Studies originated mainly from Europe, 
North America, and the Asia Pacific region with few 
studies from low- and middle-income nations (Table) 
and primarily involving black and white participants 
(Table VI in the online-only Data Supplement). The ma-
jority of studies used physician diagnosis or the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases coding system to define 
cardiovascular disease. The pooled risk ratio was 2.16 
(95% CI, 1.68–2.77) (Figure 2B). The risk ratio when 
stratified by type of event was 2.36 (95% CI, 1.50–
3.70) for any cardiovascular disease (including myocar-
dial infarction and stroke), 1.79 (95% CI, 1.54–2.08) 
for myocardial infarction, and 2.56 (95% CI, 1.43–4.61) 
for stroke. Risk ratios for older studies, those with mod-
erate/high risk of bias, and those with longer follow-up 
were larger (Table VII in the online-only Data Supple-
ment). Selection bias attributable to potential unpub-
lished studies or to small-study effects was noticed for 
the overall risk ratio. Imputing for asymmetry using the 
trim-and-fill method did not alter the effect direction, 
but, as expected, did attenuate the effect size (Table VII 
in the online-only Data Supplement and Figure III in the 
online-only Data Supplement). We observed substantial 
heterogeneity for the overall estimate (Figure 2).
Trends in the Global and Regional Burden 
of Disease
Globally, the population-attributable fraction for car-
diovascular disease associated with HIV infection in-
creased from 0.36% (95% CI, 0.21%–0.56%) in 1990 
to 0.92% (95% CI, 0.55%–1.41%) in 2015. This was 
associated with a >3-fold increase in DALYs from HIV-
associated cardiovascular disease from 0.74 million 
(95% CI, 0.44–1.16) in 1990 to 2.57 million (95% CI, 
1.53–3.92) in 2015 (Figure 3A). Similar temporal in-
creases were seen when stratified by sex (Figure 3B, 
Table VIII in the online-only Data Supplement).
There was marked regional variation in the temporal 
change in the DALYs because of cardiovascular disease 
attributable to HIV (Figure 3C). In 2015, East and South-
ern Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and West and Central 
Africa accounted for over two-thirds of all DALYs (Fig-
ure 3C). The largest annual increase across the 26-

Botswana, Lesotho, and South Africa (Figure 4A, Table 
X in the online-only Data Supplement). Similarly, the 
largest burden was observed in sub-Saharan Africa (Fig-
ure 4B). In the UNAIDS Global Plan priority countries, 
the population-attributable fraction was comparable to 
other traditional cardiovascular risk factors (Table XI in 
the online-only Data Supplement).
Data for the burden of cardiovascular DALYs attrib-
utable to HIV were available for 20 of the 21 priority 
countries from sub-Saharan Africa in the UNAIDS Glob-
al Plan.22 HIV-associated cardiovascular DALYs across 
these countries increased from 0.21 million (95% CI, 
0.11–0.38) in 1990 to 0.74 million (95% CI, 0.39–1.37) 
in 2015 (Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement).
DISCUSSION
In this systematic review, meta-analysis, and burden as-
sessment, we evaluated the association between HIV 
infection and cardiovascular disease, and estimated 
the national, regional, and global burden of cardiovas-
cular disease attributable to HIV infection. We make 
a number of important and novel observations. First, 
the crude rate for incident cardiovascular disease was 
60 per 10 
000 person years and is comparable to other 
high-risk cardiovascular groups, such as diabetes melli-
tus.42 Second, the risk of incident cardiovascular disease 
was 2-fold higher in people living with HIV. Third, the 
number of DALYs attributable to HIV-associated cardio-
vascular disease has increased 3-fold over the past 2 de-
cades, but has now plateaued. Finally, there were major 
regional variations in both the attributable fraction and 
the rates of cardiovascular disease attributable to HIV, 
with much of the burden seen in sub-Saharan Africa, 
followed by Asia and the Pacific.
Many factors may have affected the estimates that 
we have derived and are based on several assumptions 
that merit discussion. First, the pooled risk ratios used 
to calculate the population-attributable fraction and 
the subsequent cardiovascular burden were primarily 
obtained from developed nations but were applied to 
all regions. This approach is ubiquitous in these types 
of analyses43,44 and highlights the paucity of data from 
these regions. In a recent analysis evaluating the global 
burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to hyper-
tension and obesity, <10% of cohorts originated from 
low- and middle-income nations.44,45 Second, the inci-
dence rate does not consider competing risk from non-
cardiovascular mortality. This would further underesti-

population-attributable fraction for DALY for ischemic 
heart and cerebrovascular disease was obtained solely 
from studies including acute myocardial infarction or 
stroke and so did not specifically include estimates for 
angina pectoris or other chronic manifestations of ath-
erosclerotic disease. However, relative to the overall car-
diovascular DALY attributable to ischemic heart disease, 
the burden from angina is minimal.10 Therefore, the im-
pact of this limitation on the overall burden estimate is 
likely to be small. Fifth, the majority of studies evaluat-
ing the risk of cardiovascular disease in people living 
with HIV have recruited participants before 2010, with 
a large number conducted in the previous century. The 
epidemiology of HIV diagnosis and care has changed 
significantly over the past 2 decades, with better provi-
sion of antiretroviral therapy and improved survival, re-
sulting in an increased prevalence of HIV.46 Sixth, when 
calculating the burden at a global and regional level, 
we have made the assumption that the prevalence of 
HIV infection in the younger age group (15–49 years 
old) is consistent across the entire age range. There is 
a paucity of data in the prevalence of HIV in the older 
population, especially in high-prevalence regions such 
as sub-Saharan Africa.47 However, analysis of the popu-
lations in these regions shows that the prevalence in 
the older population remains similar to that of the 
15- to 49-year group.47 Finally, we noticed substantial 
heterogeneity for our overall pooled risk ratios. The 
source for this degree of heterogeneity is likely to be 
multifactorial and reflect differences in population de-
mographics, sample size and small-study effect, patient 
characteristics, selection or publication bias, and case 
ascertainment bias because the majority of data were 
based on national statistics.
Many studies have evaluated the association be-
tween HIV infection and the risk of atherosclerotic 
disease including the potential role of antiretroviral 
therapy.17,48–50 This is the first study to review and meta-
analyze systematically the association between HIV in-
fection and cardiovascular disease, and to estimate the 
burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to HIV. The 
mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly 
understood.17 Possible mechanisms include endothelial 
dysfunction51 and increased systemic13 and coronary ar-
terial inflammation14 associated with elevated inflam-
matory markers.13 Furthermore, patients with HIV have 
more traditional metabolic risk factors for cardiovascu-
lar disease17 including dyslipidemia,15 insulin resistance 
and abnormal glucose homeostasis,16 and abnormali-
ties in body fat composition.52–54 The increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease in people living with HIV is thus 
a consequence of both accelerated atherosclerosis at-
tributable to chronic infection and the increased preva-
lence of traditional risk factors.
The global burden of cardiovascular disease attribut-
able to HIV infection has tripled over the past 2 decades,

especially in the low- and middle-income nations, and 
is likely to be a product of both temporal increases in 
the prevalence of HIV and the morbidity and mortal-
ity from cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of HIV 
varies by region with the greatest proportions seen in 
sub-Saharan Africa and the Asia Pacific region. Cardio-
vascular disease now accounts for >10% of all morbid-
ity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa with rates that 
are comparable to high-income regions. Consequently, 
the sub-Saharan region accounted for half of all DALYs 
from cardiovascular disease attributable to HIV. The 
population-attributable fraction of HIV-associated car-
diovascular disease in the UNAIDS high-priority coun-
tries was up to 25% and similar to traditional lifestyle, 
metabolic, and environmental risk factors.23,24
The combined burden of HIV and cardiovascu-
lar disease in the UNAIDS high-priority countries is 
of growing concern and has important implications 
with respect to regional health policies, guidelines, 
and resource allocation. Risk stratification and iden-
tification of patients at intermediate or high risk of 
future cardiovascular disease are already challenging 
in resource-limited nations.55 Furthermore, traditional 
risk scores perform poorly because they consistently 
underestimate risk in HIV-infected populations.35,56,57 
Whether patients living with HIV should be considered 
high risk and started on primary prevention, such as 
statin therapy, remains unclear. A recent randomized 
controlled trial of rosuvastatin in patients with HIV 
demonstrated a reduction in carotid artery intima-
media thickness despite these individuals having low 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations at 
baseline.58 Although the latest international guide-
lines have expanded the use of lipid-lowering therapy

in the general population, over two-thirds of people 
living with HIV with evidence of high-risk morphology 
coronary atherosclerotic plaque would not have been 
recommended for statin therapy.59 The REPRIEVE study 
(Randomised Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV) is 
now underway to evaluate the efficacy of statin thera-
py in people living with HIV who are deemed low-risk 
based on traditional risk scores.60,61
CONCLUSIONS
This analysis evaluates the association between HIV and 
cardiovascular disease, and estimates the global burden 
of HIV-associated cardiovascular disease. We report that 
the risk of cardiovascular disease was 2-fold higher in 
people living with HIV. Moreover, the global burden of 
HIV-associated cardiovascular disease has tripled over the 
past 2 decades and is now responsible for 2.6 million 
DALYs per annum, with the majority in sub-Saharan Af-
rica and the Asia Pacific regions. Our estimates have im-
portant policy implications for implementing appropriate 
cardiovascular risk stratification and treatment strategies 
across healthcare systems, especially in those countries 
with the greatest burden where resources remain limited.
