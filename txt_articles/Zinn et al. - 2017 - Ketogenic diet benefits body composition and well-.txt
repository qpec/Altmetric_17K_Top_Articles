Abstract
Background: Low-carbohydrate, high-fat and ketogenic diets are increasingly adopted by athletes for body
composition and sports performance enhancements. However, as yet, there is no consensus on their efficacy in
improving performance. There is also no comprehensive literature on athletes’ experiences while undertaking this
diet. The purpose of this pilot work was two-fold: i. to examine the effects of a non-calorie controlled ketogenic
diet on body composition and performance outcomes of endurance athletes, and ii. to evaluate the athletes’
experiences of the ketogenic diet during the 10-week intervention.
Methods: Using a case study design, five New Zealand endurance athletes (4 females, 1 male) underwent a 10-week
ketogenic dietary intervention. Body composition (sum of 8 skinfolds), performance indicators (time to exhaustion, VO2
max, peak power and ventilatory threshold), and gas exchange thresholds were measured at baseline and at 10 weeks.
Mean change scores were calculated, and analysed using t-tests; Cohen’s effect sizes and 90% confidence limits were
applied to quantify change. Individual interviews conducted at 5 weeks and a focus group at 10 weeks assessed
athletes’ ketogenic diet experiences. Data was transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis.
Results: All athletes increased their ability to utilise fat as a fuel source, including at higher exercise intensities.
Mean body weight was reduced by 4 kg ± SD 3.1 (p = 0.046; effect size (ES):0.62), and sum of 8 skinfolds by
25.9 mm ± SD 6.9; ES: 1.27; p = 0.001). Mean time to exhaustion dropped by ~2 min (±SD 0.7; p = 0.004; ES: 0.53).
Other performance outcomes showed mean reductions, with some increases or unchanged results in two
individuals (VO2 Max: −1.69 ml.kg.min ± SD 3.4 (p = 0.63); peak power: -18 W ± SD 16.4 (p = 0.07), and VT2: -6 W ± SD
44.5 (p = 0.77). Athletes reported experiencing reduced energy levels initially, followed by a return of high levels
thereafter, especially during exercise, but an inability to easily undertake high intense bouts. Each athlete reported
experiencing enhanced well-being, included improved recovery, improvements in skin conditions and reduced
inflammation.
Conclusions: Despite performance decrements and some negative experiences, athletes were keen to pursue a
modified low-carbohydrate, high-fat eating style moving forward due to the unexpected health benefits they
experienced.

 Background
Low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diets, including their
extreme version i.e., ketogenic diets have recently become
popular dietary regimes for athletes for several reasons.
However, there is no consensus regarding the efficacy of
ketogenic diets on sports performance. The overarching
mainstream nutrition philosophy for endurance athletes,
is one that emphasises a carbohydrate-dominant, low fat
paradigm. Under these dietary conditions, athletes utilise
carbohydrate as their predominant fuel source to fuel high
volumes of aerobic exercise [1]. The appeal of LCHF
eating for endurance athletes is likely due to the shift in
fuel utilisation, from a carbohydrate-centric model to one
that utilises fat predominantly, of which stores are unlim-
ited compared to carbohydrate (i.e., muscle glycogen).
This metabolic shift, seen after a period of dietary alter-
ation is often referred to as being ‘fat-adapted’
, which has
been well-documented in studies since the 1980s [2, 3].
Despite the physiological advantage of utilising fat as
a fuel source during sub-maximal exercise, to date
there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that this
results in subsequent performance enhancement [4].
Some individual responses to a ketogenic diet have
shown dramatic benefits in both fat metabolism and
performance, and are worth further investigation [5, 6].
However, studies have also shown a reduction in max-
imal aerobic performance [7] with some evidence indi-
cating a negative effect on exercise intensity >70% of
VO2 max [8, 9]. The majority of these studies have been
criticised for not being long enough to allow for the full
adaptive mechanisms to occur, which appear to require
at least 21 days.
Despite the lack of peer-reviewed evidence for per-
formance enhancement, athletes continue to be in-
trigued with the LCHF dietary paradigm. It is likely that
this is the case for two reasons that go beyond the desire
to obtain the extra performance edge: 1. a reduction in
body fat that is frequently cited when athletes undertake
LCHF or ketogenic diets [10], and 2. the anecdotal
benefits that are cited by athletes eating this way. There
is very little athlete-specific literature, particularly of a
qualitative
nature,
addressing
non-performance
out-
comes of LCHF or ketogenic eating in an athlete cohort.
In a translational case study design, this pilot study set
out to investigate the effect of a 10-week ketogenic diet
on body composition and performance outcomes in five
New Zealand endurance athletes, as well as to evaluate,
qualitatively, the athletes’ experiences of undertaking the
ketogenic diet during their training season.
Methods
Study design
This was a pilot, 10-week intervention undertaken with
five case studies. A control group was not included.
The study took place at AUT, Human Potential Centre;
ethics was approved by the AUT Ethics Committee
(application 15/415).
Participants
Five recreational endurance athletes (four females, one
male) consented to participate in this study. All partici-
pants were known to the primary investigator and were all
highly motivated athletes regularly involved in high-level
competitive endurance sport for at least five years. All par-
ticipants were non-smokers, healthy and injury-free as per
a health screening questionnaire and not consuming a low
carbohydrate diet (defined as carbohydrates less than 45%
of total energy intake). See Table 1 for participant demo-
graphics. The athletes were curious about the efficacy of
the ketogenic diet on their body composition and sports
performance. None of them had any previous experience
with, or pre-conceptions about low carbohydrate or keto-
genic diets prior to this trial.
Study protocol
Prior to the start of the intervention, participants under-
went a series of tests and a full consultation for dietary
instruction and planning as follows:
Performance test. Participants reported to the lab
in the morning in a fasted state and underwent a
performance test on three occasions: i. one week prior
to the intervention (familiarisation), ii. immediately
prior to the intervention (baseline), and iii. Immediately
post the intervention (post). To determine V
:
O2peak and
gas exchange thresholds (GET) an incremental cycle
test was performed using an electromagnetically
controlled cycle ergometer (Ergoselect 100, Ergoline,
Bitz, Germany) in a temperature-controlled laboratory
(21 °C, 65% rH). The test commenced at 30 W and
increased by 30 W every 3 min until volitional
exhaustion. Participants were instructed to maintain a
cadence of 80 revolutions.min−1. Oxygen uptake (V
: O2)
was measured continuously using a breath-by-breath
metabolic system (Metamax 3b, Cortex, Leipzig,
Germany), and heart rate was continuously
measured using a short-range telemetry device
(Suunto M2, Suunto, Vantaa, Finland). The V
: O2peak
was defined as the highest 30s V
: O2 value and the
GET was identified independently by two experienced
investigators using the V-slope method [11].
Dietary instruction. An initial consultation was
conducted with each participant by the primary
researcher/Registered Dietitian directly after the
performance test. Participants were provided with a
daily macronutrient prescription of <50 g total
Zinn et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2017) 14:22

 carbohydrate, 1.5 g.kg protein and ad libitum fat.
A detailed explanation of the practical application
of the ketogenic dietary principles along with
appropriate tracking and monitoring procedures
was provided. Participants were provided with
a sample diet and were advised to add variations as
long as they adhered to the carbohydrate and
protein macronutrient thresholds.
They were instructed to track their diet using a
dietary analysis programme Easy Diet Diary®
(Xyris Software (Australia) Pty Ltd). Diets were
monitored weekly by the primary researcher, and
participants were contacted and offered additional
support if they deviated. The primary researcher
maintained regular contact with all participants
throughout the 10-week study duration.
Exercise instruction. The participants were all
seasoned athletes, and participated on a regular basis
in endurance events, i.e., mountain biking, road biking,
running and multisport events (which included
running, cycling and kayaking), both recreationally
and competitively. Hence, their training protocols did
not vary much from month-to-month. They were
instructed to continue with their existing training
volumes for the duration of the intervention.
Ketone blood testing. Each participant was shown
how to measure blood ketone levels via finger
prick, and provided with a FreeStyle Optium
ketone meter and ketone strips. They were
instructed to measure their blood ketone levels
daily between 2 pm and 4 pm. Nutritional ketosis was
defined as a blood ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate)
level > 0.5 mmol/l.
Anthropometric testing. Body weight and skinfolds
were measured by an ISAK level one accredited
anthropometrist, prior to and at the conclusion of
the intervention, at the same time of the day. A sum of
(∑) 8-site skinfold ISAK protocol was applied: triceps,
biceps, subscapular, iliac crest, supraspinale, abdominal,
front thigh and medial calf [12].
Interviews and focus group. A 20–30 min individual
interview was conducted on the phone during week
5 week and a 60-min focus group was conducted in
person once the intervention had concluded. The
importance of this qualitative work was to assess both
the individual and the groups’ overall experiences
of being on this diet for 10 weeks. The group session
provided a chance for athletes to compare experiences
and translate findings to future practice.
Data analysis
Due to the explorative nature of this study, and our
small sample size, quantitative data is presented as indi-
vidual responses. Data was analysed using mean change
scores, with Cohen’s effect sizes and associated confi-
dence limits applied to quantify magnitude of change.
We also elected to apply a probability statistic using a
student’s t-test to determine the statistical meaning of
the change. All statistics were generated and applied
using Microsoft Excel 2016. We acknowledge that ap-
plying statistical models hold limited meaning in this
context and it is not our intention to make any infer-
ences about these outcomes to athlete populations. As
such, outcomes with a significance level of p < 0.05
should be considered a trend only; and p < 0.01 signifi-
cant only in the sense that further work is required to
substantiate these findings. Interviews and the focus
group were recorded and transcribed, after which data
was analysed using thematic analysis. The data for the
interviews and focus groups were combined and is pre-
sented as key themes with supporting transcripts.
Results
Diet and ketosis
The diets were geared to induce nutritional ketosis,
which all the athletes achieved by the end of week 2. All
athletes adhered to the macronutrient thresholds pro-
vided for the 10 weeks, apart from on two occasions

 during the first two weeks, once, where protein intake
exceeded the recommended threshold over several days
in one athlete and alcohol intake was excessive in
another athlete, thereby preventing ketosis from being
achieved. Table 2 presents an example of a day’s food
intake for each participant along with the average energy
and macronutrient breakdown for that day. The sample
day was selected at random during week 5. The athletes
varied little from the sample diets provided to them
throughout the 10 weeks, with adherence to the diets
verified
by
blood
ketones
always
staying
above
0.5 mmol/l from week 2 onwards. Blood ketones ranged
from 0.5–4.2 mmol/l; females ranged 0.5–1.9 mmol/l,
and never exceeded 1.9 mmol/l. The male athlete ranged
1.0–3.5 mmol/l, went below 1.0 mmol/l on two occa-
sions (0.8 and 0.6 mmol/l) and measured 4.2 mmol/l on
one occasion.
Substrate oxidation
Figure 1 presents the pre and post intervention fuel util-
isation (also termed metabolic efficiency) curves, along
with associated peak fat oxidation (g/min) and fat max
(%Wmax) for each participant.
Each curve displays the cross-over point i.e., the point
at which peak fat oxidation is reached, and the point at
which carbohydrate takes over as the predominant fuel
source. Mean peak absolute fat oxidation and stand-
ard deviation (SD) increased by 41.3% (0.6 ± 0.1 to
0.8 ± 0.1 g.min−1, p = 0.001). All of the athletes in-
creased their peak fat oxidation. The exercise inten-
sity relative to
V
: O2 max
at which peak absolute fat
oxidation occurred (Fatmax) increased by 31.2% from
pre- to post-intervention (48.2 ± 8.7 to 63.2 ± 5.7%
V
: O2 max, p = 0.06). Similarly, Fatmax relative to WRmax
increased by 21.5% from pre- to post-intervention
(39.5 ± 11.9 to 48.0 ± 8.9%WRmax, p = 0.18). Two
out of the five athletes showed an increase in Fatmax
relative to WR max, and the remaining three showed
no change.
Body composition/performance
Figure 2 shows individual pre and post scores for an-
thropometric and performance data. All five participants
had reductions in body weight and skinfolds. The mean
loss in weight and SD was −4.0 ± 3.1 kg (p = 0.046), and
in skinfolds was −25.9 ± 6.9 mm (p = 0.001). The skin-
fold outcome showed a large effect size (1.27) with asso-
ciated confidence limits not crossing zero, together
indicating clinical significance in the context of their
limited application to this data.
All participants showed a decrease in time to exhaus-
tion (TTE), the mean time and SD reduction was
2 ± 0.7 min (p = 0.004). More varied responses were
noted in the change in VO2 Max (mean change
−1.69 ± 3.4 ml.kg.min (p = 0.63)), peak power (mean
change −18 ± 16.4 W (p = 0.07)) and ventilatory thresh-
old, VT2 (mean change −6 ± 44.5 W (p = 0.77)), with
some athletes improving (VT2 and VO2 max) or staying
the same (VT2 and peak power).
Athlete experiences
Table 3 presents the key positive and negative themes
extracted from the focus group. Overall, there were
more positive themes than negative; with an improved
sense of general health and well-being coming through
as a strong theme. The majority of the negative experi-
ences related to tiredness, experienced in the first few
weeks of the intervention, and a feeling of loss of power,
experienced towards the last few weeks. Each athlete re-
ported the following subjective parameters: enhanced
well-being, improved recovery, improved skin conditions
and reduced inflammation.
Discussion
This study presents a real-life insight into the lives of
five seasonal endurance athletes who by virtue of their
own curiosity wished to experience the effects of a keto-
genic diet on their sports performance. Overall, partici-
pants were able to increase the substrate utilisation of
free fatty acids, reduce body fat and experience positive
health benefits, but their maximal aerobic performance
was compromised.
Body composition
The reduced body fat can likely be explained by a result-
ant calorie deficit created by the diet, as participants re-
ported enhanced feelings of satiety and a reduction in
overall food intake. This outcome was unsurprising and
comparable to findings in previous research on both
strength and endurance athletes [13–15]. Initial weight
reduction can be associated with a loss in body water
through glycogen depletion, [16, 17], and this was also
likely the case in this study; however fat loss was evident
as per skinfold changes. A further theory relating to
weight loss, which is as yet, rigorously tested, is an in-
creased drive for fat breakdown rather than storage as
circulating levels of insulin remain low during ketogenic
diets [18]. Perhaps a combination of all three mecha-
nisms can explain the weight loss. A limitation of the
study was a lack of energy comparison prior to, and
during the study, which would have provided some
clarity about these mechanisms.
Metabolic efficiency
All participants had a greater fatty acid oxidation at a
higher given intensity at the end of the trial compared to
baseline. This finding of enhanced fat utilisation aligns

 with those of several other groups that have incorpo-
rated ketogenic and non-ketogenic dietary protocols
[5, 19, 20]. Furthermore, this substrate utilisation
alteration can be attributed to the change in diet as
training was kept relatively consistent throughout the
intervention. Our participants also had a higher oxy-
gen cost at sub-maximal workloads due to the higher
use of fat as an energy substrate. However, this did
not benefit exercise capacity.
Performance
On the whole, maximal aerobic performance was re-
duced, another comparable outcome to similar research
[21–23], the exception being one athlete in Phinney et
al.’s 4-week cycling study [5], and Zajac et al.’s eight off-
road cyclists [6], who all showed performance increases.
The performance decrement in our study, and others, is
likely due to changes in metabolic pathways that impair

 [24–26]. Specifically, a down-regulation of the carbohy-
drate oxidative enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH),
which via conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A,
links the glycolytic pathway with the Krebs cycle [27].
PDH is said to be reduced rapidly through a reduction in
circulating insulin and an increase in circulating levels of
free fatty acids [28]. Evidence suggests that PDH is upreg-
ulated upon carbohydrate reintroduction [25]; however,
there is little insight into its fate along with other mito-
chondrial enzymes in the context of low carbohydrate
availability. Despite similarities in findings with other
studies, some of these studies are limited by short-
duration low carbohydrate diets [28–30]. Future research
with chronically fat-adapted athletes is needed to investi-
gate these micro-level mechanisms alongside performance
outcomes. Recently, Volek et al.’s work [19] with chronic-
ally fat-adapted ultra-endurance athletes (>6 months) not
only demonstrated a 2.3 times greater fat oxidation rate in
the LCHF group compared with the mainstream dietary
group, but also demonstrated no difference in resting and
replete muscle glycogen stores between groups. Authors
suggest a homeostatic muscle glycogen repletion mechan-
ism arising from hepatic gluconeogenesis, which might
serve to provide clues into why many athletes report opti-
mal performance, anecdotally, when having eaten in an
LCHF manner for extended periods of time. While this is
a plausible speculation, a similar study by Webster et al.,
[20] showed no difference in gluconeogenic rates during
exercise in fasting LCHF and mixed-diet athletes. In fact,
glucose was produced endogenously to a greater extent in
the mixed diet group, and was attributed to greater rates
of hepatic glycogenolysis. Researchers concluded that glu-
coneogenesis during exercise may remain stable across a
range of dietary regimes after an overnight fast, but that
hepatic glycogenolysis is influenced by dietary carbohy-
drate. Further exploration of fuel contributions to gluco-
neogenesis and the effect of different feeding protocols on
endogenous glucose producing mechanisms is warranted.
It is important to note that both of these studies did not
incorporate a performance measure, leaving the questions
to this key issue unanswered [19, 20].
Athlete experiences
This is one of the few studies to report specifically on
endurance athletes’ experiences of undertaking a keto-
genic diet. Athletes reported similar negative physio-
logical experiences to those reported by athletes in
comparable ketogenic diet studies [13, 14, 31]. However,
they also reported experiencing benefits throughout the
trial. One of these benefits was enhanced recovery;
possibly, the rise in blood ketones had some influence,
as beta-hydroxybutyrate has been associated with upreg-
ulating
antioxidant
gene
expression
and
decreasing
reactive oxygen species [32]. However, further re-
search is required to substantiate this within athletic
populations.
From a physical well-being perspective, the cases of im-
proved skin, and the resolution of an ongoing prostate issue,
were major points of discussion of benefits experienced. We
speculate that it is the reduction of systemic inflammation
as a result of a lower total sugar [33] and Omega 6 fatty acid
intake, thereby rebalancing the Omega 6:3 fatty acid ratio in
an anti-inflammatory direction [34] that gave rise to these
outcomes. All participants were consuming high-Omega 6
industrial seed oils prior to the study (used as cooking fat
and derived from processed foods). During the study these
fats were replaced with coconut oil, butter and olive oil;
i.e., fats containing minimal Omega 6 fatty acid content.
Being a translational study, we followed up partici-
pants informally 12 months after the study concluded.
They were all still competing in endurance events, and
while not eating a ketogenic diet, none of them had
returned to their previous high carbohydrate, low fat
style of eating. Collectively, they reported that once the

 study concluded they gradually increased their carbohy-
drate intake until the point at which they felt their per-
formance at high intensities return. They were still
restricting carbohydrate and eating more fat than main-
stream guidelines recommend, and reported having dis-
covered the optimal macronutrient ratio that satisfied a
performance, body composition and a health goal.
This study had several limitations: Its design as a pilot
case study, with no standardisation of training prevents
any inference from being made to athletic populations.
However, it is still relevant to both the researcher and the
practitioner as it provides insights into what is considered
important for athletes, particularly those in the 40+ age
range. i.e., alongside improving performance, they are also
more cognisant of their overall health and well-being. A
lesson learned from undertaking this research, and a key
consideration for researchers and practitioners, is to
encourage a reduction in athlete training intensity and
volume in the early weeks of embarking on a ketogenic
diet. This will likely induce less early fatigue and other
negative symptoms related to training, and allow for meta-
bolic adaptations to occur in a lower stress milieu.
Conclusion
Despite a decrease in performance, athletes reduced body
fat and experienced unexpected well-being benefits. While
performance outcomes are key to the field of sports
science and medicine, what might be overlooked, is the in-
tegration of health and well-being, alongside performance.
Further
research,
both
conceptual
and
translational,
should challenge this type of diet further to understand its
potential uses to achieve what an endurance athlete and
their support team should ultimately be striving for i.e.,
optimal body composition, health and performance.
Table 3 Themes from interviews and focus group with supporting transcripts
Positive themes
Negative themes
Physical recovery
Loss of power during exercise/training
“The recovery each time was amazing. I would go for a 4–5 h run
then be able to mountain bike the next day, just to be able to do it
without sore muscles”.
“The next day after a 4-h run I could have got up and done it
again - my legs weren’t tired or sore”.
“Certainly I’ve had the recovery benefits I felt fine to go out the next
day and do stuff I didn’t feel the muscle soreness I would have
expected”.
“I don’t feel sore”.
“I was surprised that I could run comfortably for that long so I think
the recovery was huge I never felt this, it’s unheard of”
“It was embarrassing to the point where I just got to the point
where you just don’t have any energy”. (weeks 1–5)
“I got too tired and I got to the point where I might have had some
big runs, 4 or 5 h runs and wake in the night before hand, worried
about it. I’d think, how am I going to do that tomorrow… it’s going to
be hard”. (weeks 1–5)
“The lack of power, I just couldn’t get up the hill.” (weeks 6–10)
Negative symptoms (weeks 1–3)
“I hadn’t been for 4 days and I was starting to get bound up”.
(constipation).
“One of the downsides is that I had cramps, massive cramps”.
“I may have seemed a bit irritable for a while. People close to me
realised I was down and I’m pretty good at hiding that but people
picked it up”.
Enjoyment of this way of eating
“It’s given me the freedom to eat the things that I stopped eating for
a long time because I thought it was a no-no”.
“Not feeling hungry has been amazing”. (X2)
“Not being bothered about food, you know food doesn’t bother me
anymore, as before I had a meal and 3 h later I’d feel irritable if
I didn’t eat”.
“It’s been fantastic for me having food I couldn’t for a long time and
I really enjoy it, the flavour, for me the reason why I want to carry on
with this way of eating is because I actually enjoy it, I enjoy it far
more than my previous diet”.
Food regime boredom
“Bored with the food regime, actually I’m back on fruit …”
“…but I am starting to get sick of the diet plan”.
“You can’t even free load in your veggies.”
Weight management
“Being able to shed that 5 kg was definitely a benefit”.
“The benefit now of me being able to understanding how to manage
my weight, that’s been a real effect, actually that’s been for all of us”.
Feel better overall (well-being)
“My skin hasn’t been this good since I can remember”.
“My prostate, a million times better because I can sleep”.
“The other thing I noticed is my tinnitus is a lot better, I can’t hear
the ringing in my ears I used to have”.
“Just general health - I just feel better, I need less sleep”.
“I noticed that I didn’t fart for 2 months, no gas”.
“Yes, no gas, that’s the same as me.”
“I feel sharper mentally”.
“Food used to dictate my moods, and now it doesn’t”.
“Positive skin, I have a facial every 6 weeks, I didn’t tell the facial lady
what I was doing and she said to me what’s happened to your skin?
No extractions in the last 8 weeks, no blockages”.
