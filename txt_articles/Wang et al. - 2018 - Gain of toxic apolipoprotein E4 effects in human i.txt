Abstract
Efforts to develop drugs for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have shown promise in animal studies, only 
to fail in human trials, suggesting a pressing need to study AD in human model systems. Using 
human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells carrying the major genetic risk factor 
apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), we demonstrate that apoE4 neurons have higher levels of tau 
phosphorylation unrelated to their increased Aβ production and displayed GABAergic neuron 
degeneration. ApoE4 increased Aβ production in human, but not in mouse, neurons. Converting 
apoE4 to apoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of apoE4. 
Neurons lacking apoE behaved like those expressing apoE3, and introducing apoE4 expression 
recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from apoE4. Treating 
apoE4 neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, 
providing a proof of concept that correcting the pathogenic conformation of apoE4 is a viable 
therapeutic approach for apoE4-related AD.

 INTRODUCTION
The complexity and multifactorial etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pose unique 
challenges for studying its pathogenesis and developing therapies. Efforts to target AD-
related pathways have shown promise in animal studies, only to fail in human trials1,2. There 
is a pressing need to identify novel mechanisms and therapeutic targets for AD using human 
model systems, such as human neurons.
AD is pathologically characterized by the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles 
(NFTs), comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and extracellular amyloid plaques, 
comprised of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides1. Apolipoprotein (apo) E4, the major genetic risk 
factor for AD3,4, is found to be associated with increases in both pathologies1. In general, 
apoE4 increases AD risk and lowers the age of onset in a gene-dose dependent manner5. 
Remarkably, the lifetime risk estimate of developing AD by age 85 is ~65% in people with 
two copies of the apoE4 allele but only ~10% in people with two copies of the apoE3 allele6. 
This striking difference highlights the importance of apoE4 in the pathogenesis of AD.
Human apoE3 and apoE4 differ from each another only at one amino acid residue at the 
position 112. ApoE3, the common isoform, has Cys-112, whereas apoE4 has Arg-1121,7,8. 
Structurally, apoE has two domains: the amino-terminal domain and the carboxyl-terminal 
domain, which contain the receptor-binding region and the lipid-binding region, 
respectively. The two domains are linked by a structurally flexible hinge region. Interaction 
between the carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains, called domain interaction, is a unique 
biophysical property of apoE41,7,8. In apoE4, domain interaction occurs as a result of a salt 
bridge formation between Arg-61 and Glu-255 due to the effect of Arg-112. This interaction 
occurs to a much less extent in apoE3 because the side chain of Arg-61 adopts a different 
conformation owing to Cys-112, resulting in a less accessible side chain conformation for a 
salt bridge formation with Glu-2551,7,8. Domain interaction has been suggested to be a 
molecular basis for apoE4’s detrimental effects in AD pathogenesis, and consequently has 
been pursued as a drug target to identify small molecule structure correctors capable of 
converting apoE4 to apoE3 both structurally and functionally1,7,8.
Studies in animal models and postmortem human tissues have provided key insights into the 
pathogenesis of AD1,2,9. However, mouse models of AD do not recapitulate many AD 
features, and postmortem human brain tissues have characteristics of end-stage disease that 
may not be present at earlier stages1,2,9. Until recently, studies of the cellular and molecular 
mechanisms of AD have been hindered by the lack of access to live human neurons. Now, 
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from human somatic cells with AD-linked 
mutations or polymorphisms, together with gene-editing techniques, are promising in vitro 
models for studying disease pathogenesis in relevant cell types, including human 
neurons10–15.
Here, we analyzed AD-related phenotypes of cultured neurons derived from human iPSC 
(hiPSC) lines of different apoE genotypes, including gene-edited isogenic and apoE-
deficient lines. We also tested the effects of gene editing to convert apoE4 into apoE3 and of 
a small-molecule structure corrector to render apoE4 apoE3-like. Our data demonstrate that

 apoE4 induces AD-related pathological phenotypes, due to a gain of toxic effects, 
specifically in human neurons, which can be dramatically ameliorated by a small-molecule 
apoE4 structure corrector.
RESULTS
Generating hiPSC lines from apoE3 and apoE4 homozygotes
hiPSC lines were generated from apoE3/3 and apoE4/4 subjects (Supplementary Table 1) as 
described16,17. All hiPSC lines were morphologically similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 1b) and expressed ES cell markers, such as Nanog, Sox2, TRA-1-60, 
and TRA-1-81 (Supplementary Fig. 1c–e). DNA sequencing confirmed the apoE genotypes 
of all hiPSC lines, and chromosomal analysis revealed normal karyotypes (Supplementary 
Fig. 1f). After injection into immunodeficient mice, all hiPSC lines formed teratomas, 
confirming their pluripotency16,17. Three apoE3/3-hiPSC lines (E3/3-A, E3/3-B, and E3/3-
C) and three apoE4/4-hiPSC lines (E4/4-A, E4/4-B, E4/4-C), each derived from a subject 
with the corresponding apoE genotype, were fully characterized and used in the current 
study (Supplementary Table 1). All six of these hiPSC lines developed well into neural stem 
cells expressing Sox2, nestin, Pax6, and FoxG1 (Supplementary Fig. 1g–i) and then into 
mature neurons that had neuronal morphology (Supplementary Fig. 1j) and expressed 
neuronal markers, Tuj1 and MAP2 (Supplementary Fig. 1k,l). Quantification shows that 90 
± 1.5% (mean ± SEM, n = 12 randomly collected images from three independent 
experiments with total of 326 cells counted) of the cells are positive for neuronal marker, 
MAP2, indicating the high purity of neuronal culture.
Human apoE4/4 neurons produce less full-length apoE and more apoE fragments than 
human apoE3/3 neurons
Western blot analyses of neuronal lysates and culture medium revealed that human apoE4/4 
neurons produce ~35% less full-length intracellular apoE and secrete ~60% less full-length 
apoE into the medium than human apoE3/3 neurons, both in individual lines (Supplementary 
Fig. 2a) and as shown by mean values (Fig. 1a–c). Consequently, the ratio of intracellular 
apoE to secreted apoE was over 20% higher for apoE4 than apoE3, suggesting that apoE4 
tends to be retained inside neurons. The ratio of apoE fragments to full-length apoE in 
neuronal lysates was also significantly higher in apoE4/4 neurons (Fig. 1d,e and 
Supplementary Fig. 2b). The major apoE fragments were ~12–20 kDa (Fig. 1d), similar in 
size to those in brains of neuron-specific apoE4 transgenic mice18 and AD patients with an 
apoE4 genotype19. ApoE4 fragments were undetectable in the culture medium, suggesting 
that the fragments tend to accumulate inside neurons.
Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels are higher in human apoE4/4 neurons than human 
apoE3/3 neurons
Western blot analysis with p-tau-specific antibodies (AT8, AT180, PHF1, and AT270) 
revealed significantly higher p-tau levels in apoE4/4 neurons than apoE3/3 neurons, both in 
individual lines (Supplementary Fig. 2c–f) and as shown by mean values (Fig. 1f–j). Double 
immunostaining with anti-p-tau (AT8 or PHF1) and anti-MAP2 antibodies consistently 
showed that significantly higher percentages of apoE4/4 neurons were also positive for p-tau

 (Fig. 1k–m). Furthermore, p-tau accumulated mostly in the soma and dendrites of apoE4/4 
neurons, suggesting that apoE4 induces both tau phosphorylation and mislocalization of p-
tau in human neurons, a pathological hallmark of p-tau in AD brains1,20,21.
Human apoE4/4 neurons produce more Aβ than human apoE3/3 neurons
The levels of Aβ peptides in neuronal culture media were measured by an ELISA10,22. 
ApoE4/4 neurons secreted >2-fold more Aβ40 and Aβ42 into the culture medium than 
apoE3/3 neurons, both in individual lines (Supplementary Fig. 2g,h) and as shown by mean 
values (Fig. 1n,o). The apoE4/4 neurons also secreted greater amounts of soluble APP 
(sAPP) into the medium (Fig. 1p,q), suggesting increased processing of APP. Interestingly, 
the full-length APP protein (Fig. 1r,s) and mRNA (Fig. 1t) levels were similar in apoE4/4 
and apoE3/3 neurons, as determined by western blot and qRT-PCR analysis respectively, 
suggesting that apoE4 does not alter APP expression in human neurons. Importantly, the 
ratios of Tuj1 to actin were similar in apoE3/3 and apoE4/4 neuronal cultures (Fig. 1r,u), 
indicative of comparable neuronal populations.
Since it has been reported that in human apoE3 and apoE4 knock-in (KI) mice expressing 
human APP with mutations that cause familial AD, apoE4 appears to reduce Aβ clearance 
and stimulate Aβ deposition in the brain without affecting Aβ production23, we wondered 
whether the difference in apoE4’s effect on Aβ production between the current human 
neuron study and the previously reported mouse data reflects species difference in apoE 
regulation of Aβ metabolism. To address this question, we also generated mouse iPSC 
(miPSC) lines from human apoE3-KI and apoE4-KI mouse fibroblasts, differentiated them 
into neurons in culture for 7–8 weeks, and measured Aβ secretion from the miPSC-derived 
neurons in culture. Clearly, there were no significant differences in both Aβ40 and Aβ42 
levels in the culture medium of neurons derived from apoE3/3-miPSC and apoE4/4-miPSC 
lines (Supplementary Fig. 3). These data indicate the species difference in apoE isoform 
regulation of Aβ metabolism—apoE4 stimulates Aβ production in human neurons but not in 
mouse neurons.
Increased p-tau levels in apoE4/4 neurons are independent of high levels of Aβ
It has been suggested that Aβ accumulation could increase phosphorylation and 
accumulation of tau24,25. To assess the potential causal relationship between increased Aβ 
production and increased p-tau levels, we treated apoE4/4 neurons with an inhibitor of β-
secretase (OM99-2) or γ-secretase (compound E) for 1 week10. Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in the 
culture medium decreased by 60–75% (OM99-2) and >95% (compound E) (Fig. 2a,b). 
Strikingly, despite these drastic reductions of Aβ levels, p-tau levels were unaffected in 
apoE4/4 neurons, as shown by western blot analysis with monoclonal antibodies AT8 and 
AT180 (Fig. 2c–e).
ApoE4 causes GABAergic neuron degeneration/loss in hiPSC-derived neuronal culture
Immunofluorescent staining revealed significantly fewer GABA-positive neurons derived 
from apoE4/4-hiPSCs than from apoE3/3-hiPSCs, both in individual lines (Supplementary 
Fig. 2i) and as shown by mean values (Fig. 3a–c). Levels of GAD65/67 (GABAergic neuron 
marker) were lower in neuronal cultures derived from apoE4/4-hiPSCs than in those derived

 from apoE3/3-hiPSCs, both in individual lines (Supplementary Fig. 2j) and as shown by 
mean values (Fig. 3d,e). Immunostaining revealed no significant difference in the numbers 
of GABA-positive neurons at early time points (within 4 weeks) in culture between 
apoE4/4-hiPSCs and apoE3/3-hiPSCs (relative to apoE3/3 as 1 ± 0.11, mean ± SEM, n = 5 
fields with total of 570 GABA+ neurons counted, apoE4/4 is 0.98 ± 0.14, mean ± SEM, n = 
8 fields with total of 894 GABA+ neurons counted), suggesting that the detrimental effect of 
apoE4 on GABAergic neurons in culture is not a developmental effect. The decrease in 
GABAergic neuron numbers occurred during the late stage of neuronal differentiation of 
apoE4/4-hiPSCs, suggesting that apoE4 induces GABAergic neurodegeneration/loss. 
Importantly, apoE3/3-hiPSCs and apoE4/4-hiPSCs had similar efficiencies in generating 
Tbr1-positive glutamatergic neurons and TH-positive dopaminergic neurons in culture 
(Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting a specific detrimental effect of apoE4 on GABAergic 
neurons. Furthermore, ~60% of GABAergic neurons derived from apoE4/4-hiPSCs, but only 
~30% of those derived from apoE3/3-hiPSCs, were immunopositive for p-tau (Fig. 3f–h).
To further determine the detrimental effects of apoE4 on GABAergic interneurons, we 
adapted a protocol of differentiating hiPSCs to medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) cells, 
which are GABAergic progenitors, and then to mature GABAergic interneurons in 
culture26–28. The purity of MGE cells and GABAergic interneurons were 96.03 ± 1.25% and 
93.15 ± 0.99 (mean ± SEM), respectively, as determined by anti-NKX2.1 (a MGE cell 
marker) and anti-GABA immunostaining and flow cytometry analysis (Supplementary Fig. 
5a–d). Anti-p-tau western blot (AT8 and PHF1) revealed significantly increased p-tau levels 
in apoE4/4-GABAergic neurons compared to apoE3/3-GABAergic neurons at 5 weeks of 
culture, while there were no significant differences at 1 and 2 weeks of culture (Fig. 3i–k). 
Furthermore, immunostaining with p-tau-specific antibodies (AT8 and PHF1) also revealed 
that 70–100% more GABAergic neurons derived from apoE4/4-MGE cells than from 
apoE3/3-MGE cells were immunopositive for p-tau (Supplementary Fig. 5e,f). Importantly, 
p-tau accumulated in degenerating (beading) axons, as determined by anti-p-tau (PHF1) and 
anti-total tau double immunostaining, in apoE4/4-GABAergic neurons, but not in apoE3/3-
GABAergic neurons at 5 weeks of culture (Fig. 3l,m). As in AD brains, p-tau also 
mislocalized to dendrites of apoE4/4-GABAergic neurons, but not much in apoE3/3-
GABAergic neurons, as revealed by anti-p-tau (PHF1) and anti-MAP2 double 
immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. 5h,i). Quantification of Caspase-3 and GABA double 
positive cells suggested significantly more apoptotic cell death of apoE4/4-GABAergic 
neurons than apoE3/3-GABAergic neurons (Supplementary Fig. 5g). Taken together, these 
data demonstrate clearly that apoE4 induces human GABAergic neuron degeneration/death 
in culture.
Gene editing reveals the specificity of apoE4 in eliciting AD-related pathologies in human 
apoE4/4 neurons
To determine whether the AD-related pathologies in apoE4/4 neurons are specifically 
induced by apoE4, we used gene editing to generate an isogenic apoE3/3-hiPSC line from 
the apoE4/4-hiPSC-A line (Supplementary Fig. 6a)29. As in the parental line, the isogenic 
apoE3/3-hiPSC line (iE3/3) had normal expression of pluripotency genes (Supplementary 
Fig. 6b,c) and a normal karyotype (Supplementary Fig. 6d), and it generated normal neural

 stem cells, which expressed Sox2, nestin, and FoxG1 (Supplementary Fig. 6e,f) and 
developed into mature neurons (Supplementary Fig. 6g). Importantly, DNA sequencing 
analyses revealed no off-target effects of the gene-editing at least on some major AD-related 
genes (Supplementary Table 2).
Next, we assessed AD-related pathologies in neurons derived from the isogenic apoE3/3-
hiPSC line. The conversion from apoE4 to apoE3 had striking phenotypic effects. It 
increased the levels of full-length apoE (Fig. 4a), decreased the level of apoE fragments in 
neuronal lysates (Fig. 4b) and the secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 into the culture medium (Fig. 
4c,d). P-tau levels decreased (Fig. 4e–g), and there were fewer p-tau-positive neurons (Fig. 
4i–k and Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). The conversion also rescued the degeneration/loss of 
GABAergic neurons in apoE4/4-hiPSC neuronal cultures, as shown by significant increases 
in GAD67 levels (Fig. 4e,h) and in the number of GABA-positive neurons (Fig. 4l–n). The 
isogenic apoE3/3-hiPSC cultures also had significantly fewer p-tau-positive GABAergic 
neurons (Supplementary Fig. 7d–i) than parental apoE4/4-hiPSC cultures. Likewise, 
GABAergic neurons generated from the isogenic apoE3/3-hiPSC-derived MGE cells also 
had decreased p-tau levels and axonal degeneration compared to GABAergic neurons 
derived from the parental apoE4/4-hiPSC-derived MGE cells (Supplementary Fig. 8). In 
sum, conversion of apoE4 to apoE3 by gene editing abolished the detrimental effects of 
apoE4 and resulted in cellular phenotypes similar to those of apoE3, strongly suggesting that 
the AD-related pathologies in apoE4/4-neurons are induced specifically by apoE4.
Reintroducing different apoE isoforms into apoE-deficient human neurons reveals a gain 
of toxic effects from apoE4 in hiPSC-derived apoE-null neurons
To determine whether apoE4 induces a loss of function or a gain of toxic effects in human 
neurons, we also generated a hiPSC line from a subject with apoE deficiency (apoE−/−)30. 
The apoE−/− hiPSC line had ES cell–like morphology (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b), expressed 
pluripotency marker genes (Supplementary Fig. 9c–f), and generated neural stem cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 9g,h) and neurons (Supplementary Fig. 9i). Interestingly, the p-tau 
levels (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Fig. 10a) and the pattern of p-tau immunostaining 
(Supplementary Fig. 10b–d) in these neurons were similar to those in neurons derived from 
the isogenic apoE3/3-hiPSCs. ApoE−/− hiPSC-derived neurons and the isogenic apoE3/3-
hiPSC-derived neurons secreted similar levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 into the medium (Fig. 
5c,d). Furthermore, apoE−/− hiPSCs and the isogenic apoE3/3-hiPSCs generated similar 
numbers of GABA-positive neurons (Fig. 5e–g). Thus, the phenotypes of apoE-null neurons 
were similar to those of apoE3/3 neurons.
To further test the potential gain of toxicity conferred by apoE4, we transfected apoE−/− 
hiPSC-derived neurons with lentiviral cDNA constructs encoding apoE3 or apoE4. The 
transfected neurons expressed similar protein levels of apoE3 and apoE4 (Fig. 5h,i); 
however, those expressing apoE4 had higher p-tau levels (Fig. 5h,j) and fewer GABA-
positive neurons (Fig. 5m,n) and produced more Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Fig. 5o,p) than neurons 
expressing apoE3 or controls (Fig. 5j–l, 5n–p). Interestingly, treating apoE−/− hiPSC-derived 
neurons with purified recombinant human apoE3 or apoE4 did not significantly alter Aβ 
production (Supplementary Fig. 10e,f), suggesting that the effect of apoE4 on Aβ production

 depends on the endogenous expression of apoE. Together, these findings strongly suggest 
that apoE4 confers a gain of toxic effects in hiPSC-derived neurons.
The gain of toxic effects of apoE4 is neuron specific
Although astrocytes are the major source of apoE production in brains1,7, neurons can also 
produce apoE, especially under stress or in response to injuries1,7,31–33. We confirmed that 
hiPSC-derived neurons, including glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, did express apoE 
in culture (likely represents a “stress” condition) as determined by anti-apoE and anti-
neuronal marker double immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. 11). Since our neuronal 
culture is highly pure, with negligible astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 12a,c,e), the neuronal 
apoE is unlikely taken up from astrocyte-secreted pool.
To further determine whether human astrocyte-derived apoE4 also displays detrimental 
effects in hiPSC-derived neurons, we differentiated hiPSC with different apoE genotypes 
into mature astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 12b,d,e) and collected the conditioned media 
(ACM) with secreted apoE3 or apoE4. The apoE−/− hiPSC-derived neurons in culture were 
treated for 1 week with the ACM containing 0.35 nM (12 ng/ml) or 1.47 nM (50 ng/ml) of 
apoE. These concentrations of apoE were similar (0.35 nM) to or 3–4-fold higher (1.47 nM) 
than those in brain interstitial fluid (ISF) of mice34, which largely reflect the pool of 
astrocyte-secreted apoE in brains. Clearly, apoE4-ACM treatment at both concentrations did 
not significantly affect the levels of p-tau (AT8 and PHF1), GAD67 (GABAergic neuron 
marker), and Aβ40 and Aβ42 production/secretion in apoE−/− hiPSC-derived neuron culture 
(Supplementary Fig. 13). Thus, human astrocyte-derived apoE4 does not confer detrimental 
effects in human neurons (at least for tau phosphorylation, GABAergic neuron degeneration, 
and Aβ production), supporting the conclusion that the gain of toxic effects of apoE4 is 
neuron specific.
Detrimental effects of apoE4 in hiPSC-derived neurons are ameliorated by a small-
molecule structure corrector
We previously reported apoE4 domain interaction (Supplementary Fig. 14a)1,35 and 
identified small-molecule structure correctors that render apoE4 apoE3-like both structurally 
and functionally (Supplementary Fig. 14b)36–38. In apoE4/4-hiPSC-derived neurons, 
treatment with one of the structure correctors, PH002 (Supplementary Fig. 14b)36–38, 
significantly decreased apoE4 fragment levels (Fig. 6a,b), increased GABAergic neuron 
numbers (Fig. 6c) and GAD67 levels (Fig. 6d,f), reduced p-tau levels (Fig. 6d,e), and 
decreased Aβ40 and Aβ42 production/secretion (Fig. 6g,h) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 
6i–l). Thus, the detrimental effects of apoE4 in hiPSC-derived neurons can be ameliorated 
by a small molecule apoE4 structure corrector. Importantly, treatment of apoE−/− hiPSC-
derived neurons with different concentrations of PH002 did not show any significant effects 
on Aβ production/secretion, p-tau levels, or GAD67 levels (Supplementary Fig. 14c–f), 
indicating that the efficacy of PH002 depends on the presence of apoE4.

 DISCUSSION
In this study, we assessed the phenotypes of cultured neurons derived from multiple hiPSC 
lines of different apoE genotypes, including gene-edited isogenic and apoE-deficient lines. 
We found that apoE4 specifically induces AD-related pathologies, including the increase in 
apoE fragmentation, tau phosphorylation, and Aβ production, as well as the degeneration/
loss of GABAergic neurons. Importantly, these AD-related pathologies were associated with 
a neuron-specific gain of toxic effects of apoE4 and were ameliorated by a small-molecule 
structure corrector that renders apoE4 structurally and functionally similar to apoE336–38.
Lower levels of apoE4 than apoE3 have been reported in human apoE4 and apoE3 knock-in 
mouse brains39 and in samples of human brain and cerebrospinal fluid1. Indeed, we found 
that cultured human neurons have ~35% less intracellular apoE4 than apoE3 and secrete 
~60% less apoE4 than apoE3. Consequently, the ratio of intracellular apoE to secreted apoE 
was over 20% higher in apoE4/4 neurons, suggesting that apoE4 tends to be retained inside 
neurons. These findings might reflect a prolonged retention time of apoE4 in the 
endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, as reported in cultured rat neuronal cells37. 
ApoE fragments accumulate in the brains of neuron-specific apoE4 transgenic mice and AD 
patients carrying apoE417,18. However, our study shows for the first time in cultured human 
neurons that apoE4 is more susceptible than apoE3 to proteolytic cleavage, generating more 
neurotoxic fragments.
In humans and transgenic mice, apoE4 is associated with increased Aβ accumulation and 
amyloid plaque formation in the brain1,40. In apoE3 and apoE4 knock-in mice expressing 
human APP with mutations that cause familial AD, apoE4 appears to reduce Aβ clearance 
and stimulate Aβ deposition, especially during the initial seeding stage of plaque 
formation41,42, in the brain without affecting Aβ production23. We found that the 
endogenously expressed apoE4 significantly stimulates Aβ production in cultured human 
neurons, likely by enhancing APP processing. Thus, apoE4’s effects on Aβ production are 
species specific. Importantly, conversion of apoE4 to apoE3 by gene editing significantly 
lowered Aβ production, consistent with a specific effect of apoE4. This observation 
highlights the phenotypic differences between mouse and human cellular models of AD. 
Those differences must be recognized to understand why so many AD drugs in development 
failed in human clinical trials, even though they worked beautifully in mouse models of AD, 
and to develop drugs that are more likely effective in AD patients.
It has recently been reported that apoE4 enhances APP expression, leading to increased Aβ 
production, in a pure excitatory human neuron culture system43. However, we did not 
observe a similar effect of apoE4 on APP expression in a mixed human neuronal culture 
system. This could be due to the following differences between the two experimental 
systems. First, the induced excitatory neurons were generated by artificially expressing a 
transcription factor Ngn2 in hiPSCs, without inhibitory neurons in the culture43. As reported 
in previous in vitro and in vivo studies, Aβ production is regulated by neuronal activity—
increasing neuronal activity stimulates Aβ production and secretion44,45. Thus, in this pure 
excitatory neuronal culture, in which there is no inhibitory neurons to control the activity, 
Aβ production pathway and its regulation could be altered in a way that might not be

 physiologically relevant. In contrast, in the mixed neuronal culture, the presence of 
inhibitory neurons balances neuronal activities, as seen under a physiological condition, 
making Aβ production more physiologically controlled. Second, in the pure excitatory 
neuron study, conditioned media containing 294 nM (10 µg/ml) of apoE3 or apoE4 were 
collected from transfected HEK293 cells and were then used to treat pure excitatory neurons 
in culture43. This apoE concentration is >800-folds higher than the physiological 
concentrations of apoE (~0.35 nM) in mouse brain ISF34. In addition, it has been reported 
that HEK293 cell-secreted apoE differs from astrocytes-secreted apoE, including their poor 
lipidation status, self-aggregation, and not binding well with the LDL receptor46. In our 
study, however, we used astrocyte-secreted apoE3 or apoE4 at concentrations (0.35 or 1.47 
nM) similar to those in mouse brain ISF34.
ApoE4 has been associated with AD-related tau pathologies in both humans and transgenic 
and gene-targeted mice1,7,17,18. The current study shows that apoE4 in fact increases p-tau 
levels in cultured human neurons. ApoE4/4 neurons in culture were positive for multiple p-
tau-specific monoclonal antibodies (e.g, AT8, AT180, AT270, and PHF1), suggesting 
hyperphosphorylation of tau. Furthermore, p-tau in apoE4/4 human neurons was largely 
mislocalized to the soma and dendrites, as seen in AD brains. Again, conversion of apoE4 to 
apoE3 by gene editing significantly lowered p-tau levels, consistent with a specific effect of 
apoE4. It has been suggested that Aβ accumulation leads to increase in phosphorylation and 
accumulation of tau24,25. However, we showed that treatment of apoE4/4 human neurons 
with a β-secretase or a γ-secretase inhibitor drastically reduced Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels 
without altering p-tau levels at all. These findings strongly suggest that apoE4 induces p-tau 
accumulation in an Aβ-independent manner in human neurons at least in culture. In line 
with this conclusion, a recent study suggests that apoE4 also has an Aβ-independent and 
gain-of-toxic effect on tau-mediated neurodegeneration in a tauopathy model of mice 
expressing mutant human tau47.
ApoE4 also had a detrimental effect on GABAergic neurons in hiPSC-derived neuronal 
cultures. This was especially true in relatively pure GABAergic neuronal cultures derived 
from hiPSCs and is consistent with observations in human apoE4 knock-in mouse 
brains48–51. Hyperphosphorylated tau was accumulated in axons of GABAergic neurons, 
leading to axonal degeneration, and also mislocalized to neuronal dendrites, as seen in AD 
brains. These effects, too, were apoE4-specific, as they were abolished by conversion of 
apoE4 to apoE3. GABAergic interneuron loss and neuronal hyperactivity due to loss of 
inhibitory tone have been observed in apoE4 knock-in mice48,49,52. Importantly, GABAergic 
interneuron deficits in apoE4 knock-in mice correlate with spatial learning and memory 
impairment48,49, and deletion of the apoE4 gene in GABAergic interneurons in LoxP-floxed 
apoE4 knock-in mice restores normal learning and memory and rescues apoE4-induced 
impairment of hippocampal network activity53,54. Thus, apoE4-induced GABAergic 
interneuron degeneration/dysfunction could contribute significantly to dementia in AD 
patients.
A long-standing question has been whether the detrimental effects of apoE4 in AD 
pathogenesis reflect a loss of normal function or a gain of toxic effects1,55. Studies in 
animals suggest both possibilities1,55, and it has been difficult to address this question in

 humans. Our hiPSC-derived neuron model of apoE deficiency and the complementary 
experiments of reintroducing apoE4 into the apoE-null human neurons strongly argue for a 
gain of toxic effects of apoE4 in AD pathogenesis, at least for its effects on tau 
phosphorylation, Aβ production, and GABAergic neuron degeneration. This conclusion is in 
line with the report of an apoE-deficient patient that detailed neurocognitive studies failed to 
demonstrate any defects30. This information has critical implications for developing drugs 
targeting apoE4: reducing apoE4 expression might be an attractive strategy.
Lastly, our findings in hiPSC-derived neurons provide a proof of concept that correcting the 
pathogenic conformation of apoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for apoE4-related 
AD1,8,36–38. Treating apoE4/4 hiPSC-derived neurons with the apoE4 structure corrector 
PH00236–38 ameliorated the detrimental effects of apoE4 on tau phosphorylation, Aβ 
production, and GABAergic neuron degeneration in a dose-dependent manner. These 
findings warrant further development of apoE4 structure correctors and, ultimately, testing in 
clinical trials.
ONLINE METHODS
Generating and Characterizing hiPSC and miPSC Lines with Different ApoE Genotypes
hiPSC lines were generated as described16,17 from skin fibroblasts of subjects with different 
apoE genotypes or apoE deficiency (Supplementary Table S1). miPSC lines were generated 
from fibroblasts derived from human apoE3-KI and apoE4-KI mice using a similar 
protocol16,17. The hiPSCs were maintained under feeder-free condition in mTeSR1 medium 
or on irradiated SNL feeder cells in hES cell medium consisting of Dulbecco’s modified 
Eagle’s medium /F12 with 20% Knockout Serum Replacement, 2 mM glutamine, 0.1 mM 
nonessential amino acids (all from Life Technologies), 4 ng/ml recombinant human basic 
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (PeproTech), and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol56. hiPSCs 
were routinely passaged at 1:2–1:4 by brief treatment with Accutase (Millipore) and 
scraping. The hiPSC protocol was approved by the Committee on Human Research at the 
University of California, San Francisco.
Generating and Characterizing Isogenic ApoE3/3 hiPSC Lines by Zinc Finger Nuclease 
(ZFN)–mediated Gene Editing
To generate isogenic apoE3/3-hiPSC lines, we dissociated the parental apoE4/4 hiPSCs with 
Accutase (Millipore) and placed 2×106 cells in nucleofection solution (Lonza) containing 4 
µg of the APOE-ZFN mRNA pair together with 5 µg of apoE3 donor DNA. A specific pair 
of six-finger ZFNs engineered to target a region around the Arg-112 of apoE4 allele was 
designed and prepared by Sigma. The ZFNs bound (uppercase) and cut (lowercase) the 
following sequence on the APOE gene: 
CGGGCACGGCTGTCCAAGgagctGCAGGCGGCGCAGGCCCG. The mixture was 
transferred to a cuvette and nucleofected with Nucleofector II (Lonza) at Nucleofector 
setting A-23 and the Human Stem Cell Nucleofector Kit I, as reported29. Nucleofected cells 
were quickly transferred to 500 µl of prewarmed (37°C) hES cell medium, incubated at 37°C 
for 5 min, and plated at 1×106 cells per well in an irradiated SNL-coated six-well plate

 containing hES medium supplemented with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor (ROCKi) (Tocris). To 
maximize viability and efficiency, the entire procedure was completed within 20 min.
Transfection efficiency was assessed by nucleofecting 5 µg of pmaxGFP vector into another 
set of cells to monitor GFP expression. For clonal isolation of modified hiPSCs after 
nucleofection, cultures were dissociated into single cells with Accutase and plated at 1 cell/
well in 96-well plates coated with irradiated SNL feeders. Cloned hiPSCs were maintained 
in hES medium supplemented with 10 µM ROCKi for 1 week. Single colonies in 96-well 
plates were passaged into 48-well plates and expanded in 24-well plates. Cells were then 
harvested for isolation of genomic DNA with a GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA 
Miniprep Kit (Sigma), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA (250 ng) 
was amplified by PCR with Phusion High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and 0.5 µM forward and reverse primers flanking the ZFN binding sequence on 
APOE to yield a 326-bp fragment. The primer sequences were 5´-
CTCGGCCGCAGGGCGCTGATGGA-3´ (forward) and 5´-
GCCCCGGCCTGGTACACTGCCA-3´ (reverse). The PCR products were sequenced to 
identify the ZFN-introduced apoE4 to apoE3 conversion. The converted apoE3 isogenic 
clones were further confirmed by genomic sequencing of the APOE allele covering the 
donor region and upstream and downstream regions. The hiPSC lines were karyotyped by 
Cell Line Genetics.
For immunostaining, hiPSCs cultured in 24-well plates were fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde and stained with primary antibodies against Nanog (ab21624, Abcam), 
human nuclei (MAB1281, EMD Millipore), Sox2 (sc-17320, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 
Oct-3/4(sc-5279, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SSEA4 (ab16287, Abcam), TRA-1-81 
(MAB4381, EMD Millipore), and TRA-1-60 (MAB4360, EMD Millipore). The secondary 
antibodies were IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 (Life 
Technologies). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Images were taken with a Leica 
epifluorescence microscope, a Keyence BZ-9000E fluorescence microscope, or a Leica 
confocal imaging system.
For the teratoma formation assay, 1×106 cells of each hiPSC line were dissociated with 
Accutase (Millipore), spun down, and resuspended in 100 µl of PBS. NOD-SCID mice were 
anesthetized by standard procedures, and the cell suspensions were injected into the right 
and left thigh muscles (1×106 cells per site) of three mice. The mice were monitored during 
recovery. Tumors were apparent by about 4 weeks. The tumors were collected, fixed, 
sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin to identify teratomas. The protocol was 
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees of the Gladstone Institutes and the 
University of California, San Francisco.
cDNA Sequencing of Alzheimer’s Disease Related Genes
Total RNAs were purified from neurons derived from the parental apoE4/4-hiPSC and the 
isogenic apoE3/3-hiPSC lines using Qiagen Rneasy mini kit. cDNAs were reverse 
transcribed from total RNA using oligo dT as primers (SuperScript™ III First-Strand 
Synthesis System, ThermoFisher Scientific). Using the resultant cDNAs as templates, the 
coding sequence of APP, MAPT (Tau), BACE1, and PS1 were amplified with corresponding

 2–3 pairs of PCR primers. The coding sequence of the NPLOC4 gene was also amplified 
because it was predicted as a potential off-target gene of the gene editing approach using the 
program Prognos. All PCR products were then purified and sequenced. The sequencing data 
were then used to blast search database for DNA sequence alignment.
Neuronal Differentiation of hiPSCs and miPSCs
hiPSCs were differentiated into neurons as described57,58 with modifications. hiPSCs were 
treated with collagenase IV (Stem Cell Technologies) and grown in suspension as embryoid 
bodies in hES medium without bFGF. The medium was replaced every day for 5 days. On 
day 5, embryoid bodies were grown in Neural Induction Medium containing Dulbecco’s 
modified Eagle’s medium/F12 and Neurobasal Medium (1:1, Thermo Fisher), 1% N2 
Supplement (Life Technologies), 1% B27 Supplement (Life Technologies), nonessential 
amino acids, and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) supplemented with 
inhibitors of the TGF-β receptor (SB431542, Stemgent; 5 µM) and the bone morphogenetic 
protein receptor (LDN-193189, Stemgent; 0.25 µM). On day 7, spheres were transferred to 
wells coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in Neural Progenitor Medium, 
which consisted of Neural Induction Medium without SB and LDN, but containing 10 ng/ml 
bFGF (PeproTech), 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) (PeproTech), and 2 µg/ml 
heparin (Sigma). Attached neuroepithelial cells were fed every other day for 7 days. Neural 
rosette structures appeared by around day 15, were lifted off the plate, and grown in 
suspension in Neural Progenitor Medium to form neurospheres. For neuronal differentiation, 
neurospheres were dissociated with Accutase and plated on culture plates coated with 100 
µg/ml poly-l-ornithine (Sigma) and 10 µg/ml laminin (Sigma). Neuronal cultures were 
maintained in Neural Differentiation Medium consisting of Neural Progenitor Medium, 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (10 ng/ml; PeproTech), and glial cell–derived growth 
factor (10 ng/ml; PeproTech) without bFGF, EGF, or heparin. Neurons were observed after 
several days and were further differentiated for 30 days or longer. Most of the experiments 
were performed on the neuronal culture differentiated beyond 8 weeks.
miPSCs were differentiated into neurons using a similar protocol as described above. This 
culture condition generated 92 ± 3% MAP2+ neurons, including 74 ± 4% vGLUT+ total 
glutamatergic neurons, 32 ± 4% Tbr1+ subclass of glutamatergic neurons, 13 ± 3% GABA+ 
GABAergic neurons (for apoE3/3-miPSCs; 5 ± 2% for apoE4/4-miPSCs), and 5 ± 2% TH+ 
dopaminergic neurons. In this neuronal culture, GFAP+ astrocytes were 3 ± 1%. The 
percentages of these different cell types generated from miPSCs were very similar to those 
generated from hiPSCs.
Generation of MGE Cells and Maturation into GABAergic Neurons from hiPSCs
hiPSCs were differentiated into MGE progenitors as previously reported with 
modifications26–28. On day 1 through day 8 of differentiation, MGE spheres were grown in 
suspension in KSR medium supplemented with Rock Inhibitor (RI, Tocris Bioscience), the 
TGF-ß receptor inhibitor SB431542 (SB, Stemgent), the Wnt pathway inhibitor Wnt 
Antagonist II (IWP-II, Millipore), the Hedgehog pathway activator Smoothened Agonist 
(SAG, Millipore), and the bone morphogenetic protein receptor inhibitor LDN-193189 
(LDN, Stemgent). On day 8, MGE spheres were transferred to KSR media supplemented

 with FGF-8 (PeproTech), IWP-II, SAG, and LDN. On day 21, MGE-progenitors were 
dissociated with Accutase and plated on culture plates coated with PLL overnight at 37°C 
and Laminin for ≥ 1hour at 37°C in neural induction medium containing DMEM/F12 and 
Neurobasal Medium (1:1, Thermo Fisher), N2 Supplement, B27 Supplement (Life 
Technologies), NEAA, Glutamax, and penicillin/streptomycin supplemented with Brain-
Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF, PeproTech), Glial-Derived Neurotrophic Factor 
(GDNF, PeproTech), the γ secretase inhibitor DAPT (Tocris), the MEK/ERK pathway 
inhibitory SU5402 (STEMCELL Technologies), and the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 
(Tocris). From day 28 on, maturing GABAergic inhibitory interneurons were cultured in 
neural induction medium containing BDNF and GDNF for up to 5 weeks.
Flow Cytometry Analysis of hiPSC-derived MGE Progenitors and Mature GABAergic 
neurons
Flow cytometry analysis was performed at Day 35 of GABAergic interneuron differentiation 
in order to assess the purity of the cell population. Cells were dissociated and fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde and stained with the following antibodies: NKX2.1 (sc-13040, Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology), and GABA (A2052, Sigma). The secondary antibody was IgG-conjugated 
Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies). Live and dead cells were identified using the Zombie 
UV Fixable Viability Kit (Biolegend). Unstained as well as IgG-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 
(Life Technologies) secondary antibody alone was used as a control and to gate positive 
populations. Cells were analyzed on a BD LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences), and 
data were interpreted with FlowJo Version 10.
Immunocytochemical Analysis of hiPSC-derived Neuronal Cultures
All neural progenitors, including MGE cells, and further differentiated cells, including MGE 
cell-derived GABAergic neurons, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with the 
following primary antibodies: nestin (MAB5326, EMD Millipore), Pax6 (Developmental 
Studies Hybridoma Bank), FoxG1 (sc-48788, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), MAP2 
(MAB3418, AB5622, EMD Millipore), Tuj1 (MAB1637, EMD Millipore; MRB-435P, 
Covance), apoE (178479, Calbiochem), PHF1 (gift from Peter Davies), AT8 (MN1020, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific), AT180 (MN1040, Thermo Fisher Scientific), Tau5 (577801, 
EMD Millipore), total-tau (T6402, Sigma), NKX2.1 (sc-13040, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 
GABA (A2052, Sigma), and cleaved Caspase-3 (D3E9, Cell Signaling Technology). The 
secondary antibodies were IgG-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 (Life 
Technologies). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Images were taken with a Leica 
epifluorescence microscope, a Keyence BZ-9000E fluorescence microscope, or a Leica 
confocal imaging system.
Western Blot Analysis of hiPSC-derived Neurons
hiPSC-derived neurons, including MGE cell-derived GABAergic neurons, in culture were 
washed with PBS and collected in the presence of a high-detergent buffer consisting of 50 
mM Tris, 150 mM sodium chloride, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 4% 
sodium dodecyl sulfate, and supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail 
(Roche), phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 1 (P2850, Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 
2 (P5726, Sigma). The total protein in cell lysates was quantitated with the BCA protein

 assay kit (#23227, Pierce). In some experiments, the media were also collected for analysis 
of apoE and soluble APP levels by western blot. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE 
on 4−20% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (Life Technologies) or Criterion XT 4–12% Bis-
Tris gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes 
were then blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (PBS) (LI-COR) and probed with the 
following primary antibodies: apoE (178479, Calbiochem), actin (A5060, Sigma), Tuj1 
(MAB1637, EMD Millipore; MRB-435P, Covance), GFAP (Z0334, Dako), PHF1 (gift from 
Peter Davies), AT8 (MN1020, Thermo Fisher Scientific), AT180 (MN1040, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific), AT270 (MN1050, Thermo Fisher Scientific), Tau-5 (577801, EMD Millipore), 
soluble APP-β (SIG-39138, Covance), 22C11 (MAB348, EMD Millipore), GAD65/67 
(AB1511, EMD Millipore), and GAD67 (MAB5406, EMD Millipore). The secondary 
antibodies were IgG labeled with IRDye 800 or IRDye 680 (LI-COR). The blotted 
membranes were scanned with an Odyssey CLx Imaging System (LI-COR). Signals were 
analyzed with Image Studio Lite 4.0 (LI-COR). Unprocessed original scans of blots are 
shown in Supplementary Figure 15.
Measuring Aβ40 and Aβ42 in hiPSC- and miPSC-derived Neuron Culture Medium
Medium from neuronal cultures was harvested and stored at –80°C. Cell lysates were 
collected for cellular protein normalization and analysis of p-tau levels by western blot 
analysis. Human and mouse Aβ peptides were measured with MSD Human V-PLEX Aβ 
Peptide Panel 1 (6E10) Kit (K15200E, Meso Scale Discovery) and Thermo Fisher Mouse 
Aβ Peptide ELISA Kits (KMB3481 and KMB3441, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to 
the product manuals. For human Aβ measurement, the plates were read with a Sector Imager 
2400, and the data were acquired and analyzed with Discovery Workbench software. For 
mouse Aβ measurement, the plates were read with a FlexStation-III, and the data were 
analyzed with Prism-6 software. For experiments with secretase inhibitors, neuronal cultures 
were treated with a γ-secretase inhibitor (compound E, Copd-E, at a final concentration of 
200 nM), a β-secretase inhibitor (OM99-2, final concentration of 750 nM), or dimethyl 
sulfoxide (vehicle) as described10. All inhibitors were from EMD Millipore.
Astrocyte Differentiation of hiPSCs and Treatment of Neurons from ApoE-deficient hiPSCs 
with Conditioned Media from Astrocyte Culture
hiPSCs were differentiated into astrocyte progenitors and astrocytes as previously reported 
with some modifications59. The astrocyte progenitors were generated using the procedure as 
described for neuronal differentiation of hiPSCs. Instead, these progenitor spheres were kept 
in suspension for further expansion in the presence of 10 ng/ml bFGF (PeproTech) and 10 
ng/mL EGF (PeproTech), and passaged by disaggregating into small clusters with a Pasteur 
pipette for around 90 days. For astroglial differentiation, progenitor spheres were dissociated 
with accutase to single cells, and seeded onto the plates coated with PLL and laminin in 
Neural Differentiation Medium without bFGF and EGF. The astrocyte conditioned media 
(ACM) were collected from the astrocyte culture, and the apoE levels of these media were 
measured with Human ApoE (AD2) ELISA kit (Cat # EHAPOE, Thermo Scientific). The 
amount of ACM for treatment of the neurons derived from apoE-deficient hiPSCs were 
adjusted to the same apoE concentration (0.35 nM or 1.47 nM), based on apoE levels in the 
ACM collected from apoE3/3 or apoE4/4 astrocyte culture. After ACM treatment for 1

 week, the media and cell lysates of neurons derived from apoE-deficient hiPSCs were 
collected and further analyzed.
Treatment of hiPSC-derived Neurons with a Small-molecule Structure Corrector
Neuronal cultures derived from hiPSC lines were treated with a small-molecule structure 
corrector, PH002 (final concentration, 100 nM; prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide) as 
described36–38. After 7 days of treatment, culture medium was collected for measurement of 
Aβ40 and Aβ42, and cells were homogenized for western blot analyses. For the dose-effect 
experiments, different doses of PH002 (i.e., 0 nM, 10 nM, 30 nM, and 100 nM) were used to 
treat the culture neurons for 1 week.
Treatment of hiPSC-derived Neurons with Recombinant Human ApoE
Neuronal cultures derived from apoE−/− hiPSCs were treated with purified recombinant 
human apoE3 or apoE4 (final concentration, 220 nM or 7.5 µg/ml). After 2 days of treatment 
with recombinant human apoE, culture medium was collected for measurement of Aβ40 and 
Aβ42, and cells were homogenized for protein normalization and western blot analysis.
Statistical Analyses
Power analysis of a pilot cohort (n = 3) showed that a sample size of three would be 
sufficient to show genotype effects; all groups have n ≥3. Values are expressed as mean ± 
SEM. All n numbers represent the numbers of biological replicates or fields used for image 
analysis. The distribution of data was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk normality test; most of 
the data were normally distributed. The variances between groups were similar as shown by 
Bartlett’s test. Statistical significance was calculated with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad 
Software). Differences between groups were determined with the unpaired two-sided t test. 
For multiple comparisons, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post-test 
was used. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Researchers were not blinded to genotypes 
during experiments.
