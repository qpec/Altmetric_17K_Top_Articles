IMPORTANCE Presently, 81 countries mandate the fortification of grain products with folic
acid to lessen the risk of neural tube defects in the developing fetus. Epidemiologic data on
severe mental illness suggest potentially broader effects of prenatal folate exposure on
postnatal brain development, but this link remains unsubstantiated by biological evidence.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate associations among fetal folic acid exposure, cortical maturation, and
psychiatric risk in youths.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective, observational clinical cohort study was
conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) among 292 youths 8 to 18 years of age
born between January 1993 and December 2001 (inclusive of folic acid fortification rollout
±3.5 years) with normative results of clinical magnetic resonance imaging, divided into
3 age-matched groups based on birthdate and related level of prenatal folic acid fortification
exposure (none, partial, or full). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed between
January 2005 and March 2015. Two independent, observational, community-based cohorts
(Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort [PNC] and National Institutes of Health Magnetic
Resonance Imaging Study of Normal Brain Development [NIH]) comprising 1078 youths 8 to
18 years of age born throughout (PNC, 1992-2003) or before (NIH, 1983-1995) the rollout of
folic acid fortification were studied for replication, clinical extension, and specificity.
Statistical analysis was conducted from 2015 to 2018.
EXPOSURES United States–mandated grain product fortification with folic acid, introduced in
late 1996 and fully in effect by mid-1997.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Differences in cortical thickness among nonexposed,
partially exposed, and fully exposed youths (MGH) and underlying associations between age
and cortical thickness (all cohorts). Analysis of the PNC cohort also examined the association
of age–cortical thickness slopes with the odds of psychotic symptoms.
RESULTS The MGH cohort (139 girls and 153 boys; mean [SD] age, 13.3 [2.3] years)
demonstrated exposure-associated cortical thickness increases in bilateral frontal and
temporal regions (9.9% to 11.6%; corrected P < .001 to P = .03) and emergence of quadratic
(delayed) age-associated thinning in temporal and parietal regions (β = –11.1 to –13.9;
corrected P = .002). The contemporaneous PNC cohort (417 girls and 444 boys; mean [SD]
age, 13.5 [2.7] years) also exhibited exposure-associated delays of cortical thinning (β = –1.59
to –1.73; corrected P < .001 to P = .02), located in similar regions and with similar durations of
delay as in the MGH cohort. Flatter thinning profiles in frontal, temporal, and parietal regions
were associated with lower odds of psychosis spectrum symptoms in the PNC cohort (odds
ratio, 0.37-0.59; corrected P < .05). All identified regions displayed earlier thinning in the
nonexposed NIH cohort (118 girls and 99 boys; mean [SD] age, 13.3 [2.6] years).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this study suggest an association between
gestational exposure to fortification of grain products with folic acid and altered cortical
development and, in turn, with reduction in the risk of psychosis in youths.

n March 1996, the US government mandated that all food
manufacturers fortify enriched grain products with 140 μg
of folic acid per 100 g of food by January 1, 1998.1 This in-
tervention was implemented to provide increased fetal expo-
suretofolicacid(asyntheticandmorehighlybioavailableform
of naturally occurring folate) in the first month of gestation, a
timecriticaltoneuraltubedevelopmentbutbeforemanypreg-
nancies are recognized. The fortification rollout rapidly
doubled blood folate levels in women of childbearing age2 and
substantially diminished neural tube defects in newborns.3,4
At present, 81 countries require folic acid fortification of grain
products (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Folate may play other important roles in the develop-
ment of the fetal central nervous system, given its contribu-
tionstoDNAsynthesis,DNAandhistonemethylation,andgene
expression. The hypothesis that prenatal exposure to folate
may also influence postnatal brain development arises in part
from epidemiologic studies that linked starvation during early
fetal life with both neural tube defects and schizophrenia,5 and
is further supported by studies that linked periconceptional
folic acid supplements to lower risk of language delay and
autism6-9;however,1studyfailedtofindsuchanassociation.10
A critical unanswered question is whether variation in fetal ex-
posure to folate subsequently influences brain development
duringtheformativeyearsprecedinglateadolescenceandearly
adulthood, a period associated with heightened risk for psy-
chiatric disorders.
The present study used the US rollout of folic acid fortifica-
tion of grain products to examine the association between in-
creased fetal exposure to folic acid and subsequent cortical de-
velopment. Our primary measurement was cortical thickness
obtainedfrommagneticresonanceimaging(MRI)scansbecause
it provides a clinically relevant developmental marker. Studies

school-aged children with autism.18
Using data from normative clinical brain MRI scans ac-
cessed from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH),19 we
compared cortical thickness indices within a large cohort of
youths born just before, during, or just after the rollout of fo-
lic acid fortification and who, therefore, would have received
progressively greater exposure to folic acid during gestation.
Although little, if any, fortification was in place by September
1996, its rapid deployment ensured that the transition was
nearly complete within New England by July 1997.20 There-
fore, comparison groups were predefined based on date of
birth,sothatnoindividualsinthepre-rolloutgroup(bornprior
to July 1, 1996) were exposed to fortification during any part
of gestation, every individual in the post-rollout group (born
after June 30, 1998) was exposed during the entire preg-
nancy,andindividualsintherolloutgroup(bornbetweenthese
dates) were intermediately exposed. We then turned to 2 ad-
ditional large, US-based pediatric MRI repositories, the Phila-
delphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) and the National
Institutes of Health MRI Study of Normal Brain Development
(NIH), to test the reliability and specificity of fortification-
related associations with cortical development, and the
relevance of fortification-associated MRI changes to psycho-
pathologic characteristics.
Methods
MGH Cohort
Patients with brain MRI scans were identified through pur-
poseful sampling of the MGH medical record (eFigure 2A in the
Supplement).Thesearchreturned3311radiologyreports,based
on both general inclusion criteria (8.0-18.0 years of age at time
of scan, date of birth between January 1993 and December
2001, and MRI scans occurring between January 2005 and
March 2015) and a predetermined algorithm to optimize age
matching of groups. After excluding MRI scans with abnor-
malities that were identified in the corresponding radiology
reports (eTable 1 in the Supplement), and then subjecting the
remainingscanstostringentqualitycontrolproceduresblinded
to birthdate (eFigure 2B in the Supplement), we arrived at 292
usable, clinically normative scans, comprising 97 pre-rollout
(nonexposed), 96 rollout (partially exposed), and 99 post-
rollout (fully exposed) unique individuals (Table 1 and the
eAppendix in the Supplement). Study procedures were ap-
provedbyPartnersHumanResearchCommittee,whichgranted

Key Points
Question Is increased fetal exposure to folic acid, implemented
through population-wide fortification of grain products,
associated with clinically meaningful changes in postnatal brain
development?
Findings In a cohort of 292 youths 8 to 18 years of age with
normative results of clinical magnetic resonance imaging, delayed
age-associated thinning of the cerebral cortex, a pattern
suggesting reduced risk for severe mental illness, emerged among
individuals who gestated during and after the fortification rollout
in the United States (1996-1997). Studies of 2 additional
independent US cohorts (N = 1078) confirmed the reliability and
temporal specificity of fortification-associated delays of cortical
thinning and demonstrated an associated reduction in psychosis
risk.
Meaning Beyond its known association with the prevention of
neural tube defects, increased gestational exposure to folic acid
through food fortification may protect against psychosis through
altered postnatal cortical development.

settings in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Participants under-
went standardized clinical and MRI assessment using a single
3-T magnet. Clinical assessment23 characterized participants
as either typically developing or exhibiting psychiatric symp-
toms, categorized as psychosis spectrum, attenuated psycho-
sis, or other types of psychopathologic conditions (eAppen-

NIH Cohort
The NIH participants have been characterized elsewhere.25 In
brief, healthy youths were recruited across 6 sites nation-
wide and underwent MRI scans on 1.5-T magnets up to 3 times
at various ages. Here, we selected a subsample from this co-
hort whose MRI scans previously passed stringent image qual-
ity control,11 and we constrained it to our age interval of inter-
est (8.0-18.0 years). We also excluded participants who might
have been exposed to folic acid fortification based on their age
at first enrollment. The final sample included 217 individual
participants and 383 MRI scans. All procedures were ap-
proved by the relevant institutional review board at each of the
6 pediatric study centers, where the MRI scans took place, at
a clinical coordinating center at Washington University in St
Louis, and at a data coordinating center at the Montreal
NeurologicalInstitute,McGillUniversity.Writteninformedcon-

MGH Cohort
Includedandexcludedpatientswerecomparableacrossdemo-
graphic measures (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Among in-
cluded individuals, exposure groups did not differ signifi-
cantly by age at MRI scan, sex, scan indication, or insurance
status; a slight but nonsignificant increase in use of psycho-
tropic medications was noted over time, consistent with pre-
viousepidemiologicstudies.26Thedistributionofscannerfield
strengths differed among groups owing to a shift from 1.5- to
3-T clinical magnets in the late 2000s, a factor taken into ac-
count in the main analyses. Tagging patients’last known ad-
dresses to block-level data obtained through the 2010 Ameri-
can Community Survey, we observed no differences among
fortification groups in per capita use or spending on nonpre-
scription vitamins, or in other measures that could affect fo-
late intake (eg, median income, household educational level,
or unemployment rate) (Table 1).
Group differences in cortical thickness were observed in
bilateral frontal and inferior temporal regions. In each
significant cluster, cortical thickness was higher in the fully
exposed group compared with the nonexposed group, with
intermediate effects observed in the partially exposed group
(Figure 1A and B; eFigure 4 and eTable 3 in the Supplement).

 Sensitivity analyses revealed significant associations of
scanner field strength and manufacturer with cortical thick-
ness, but the direction of these associations varied by region,
consistent with prior studies.27,28 Between-group differ-
ences remained significant after adjustment for these vari-
ables, and no significant group × field strength or
group × manufacturer interactions were observed (eTable 4
in the Supplement).
To understand this pattern in the context of age-
associated change in cortical thickness, we next assessed for
group differences in intercept (ie, thickness means centered
at 8 years of age) and slope (linear age effects), as well as for
anydifferencesinnonlinear(quadratic)age-associatedchange.
Intercept in the bilateral frontal cortex (pars orbitalis and pre-
central) and the right inferior temporal gyrus was higher in the
fully exposed group than in the nonexposed group; these dif-
ferences diminished with age (Figure 1C; eFigure 5 and eTable
3 in the Supplement; and Video). There were no significant dif-
ferences in the cortical thickness–age slope that contributed
totheincreasedcorticalthicknessintheexposedgroups.How-
ever, in the left inferior temporal cortex, as well as in the left
inferior parietal cortex, we observed significant differences in
age-squared effects, where cortical thinning in fully exposed
participants was delayed compared with cortical thinning in
nonexposed participants (Figure 2A and B; and eTable 5 in the
Supplement). Additional modeling using least squares regres-
sion localized the onset of cortical thinning in fully exposed
participants, defined by the optimal break point between flat
and sloped lines, to 13.0 years of age (left inferior temporal gy-
rus) and 13.8 years of age (left inferior parietal lobule; eFigure
6A in the Supplement).
PNC and NIH Cohorts
The MGH data set relied on clinical MRI scans that were ac-
quired through nonuniform clinical protocols, using differ-
ent magnets, and within a single US city. To verify and gener-
alize the findings from the MGH cohort, we next turned to 2
additional large US cohorts that were studied prospectively in
standardized research settings (Table 2): 1 cohort with birth-
dates centered around the folic acid fortification rollout and
MRI scans performed with a single 3-T magnet (PNC; eFigure
3 in the Supplement), and 1 cohort that included only youths
who were born prior to folic acid fortification (NIH).
Because MRI scans in the PNC data set were collected dur-
ingarelativelybrieftime,nonexposedparticipantsweresignifi-
cantlyolderthanpartiallyexposedorfullyexposedparticipants.
Whereasbetween-groupcorticalthicknessdifferenceswouldbe
strongly confounded by age differences, examination of age-
associated thinning contours provided an opportunity to repli-
catefindingsfromtheMGHcohort.Specifically,youngerPNCpar-
ticipants (who were exposed to folic acid fortification) should
demonstratedelayedcorticalthinning,whereasyoungerNIHpar-
ticipants(whowerenotexposedtofolicacidfortification)should
not demonstrate delayed cortical thinning.
Within the PNC cohort, quadratic (delayed) age-related
thinning was observed in 4 clusters that overlapped with those
identified in the MGH analysis: left frontal, right inferior tem-
poral, left inferior parietal, and right inferior parietal (Figure 2C
and D; and eFigure 7A and B and eTable 6 in the Supple-
ment). Least squares regression localized the onsets of corti-
cal thinning to between 13.0 and 14.3 years of age (eFigure 6B
in the Supplement). Conversely, bilateral lingual gyrus (which
was not implicated in the MGH cohort) exhibited signifi-
cantly accelerated cortical thinning.
To confirm that quadratic thinning effects emerged largely
after folic acid fortification, we turned to the NIH cohort, in
which all included participants were born prior to the rollout.
Age-related associations with cortical thickness were as-
sessed within the same 6 clusters that showed delayed thin-
ning in the MGH (left inferior temporal gyrus and left inferior
parietal lobule) or PNC (right inferior temporal gyrus, left fron-
tal cortex, left inferior parietal lobule, and right inferior pari-
etal lobule) cohorts. Consistent with a previous analysis11 that
included a more extended age range and that was not limited
to nonexposed participants, nonlinear cortical thinning in the
NIH cohort was sparse, with only 1 cluster demonstrating sig-
nificant quadratic thinning (left frontal cortex; Figure 2E and
F; and eFigure 7C and eTable 7 in the Supplement). Even so,
within this cluster, the break point for thinning occurred at a
significantly younger age when compared with the PNC break
point (χ2 = 11.87; P < .001; eFigure 6C in the Supplement).
Risk of Psychosis
To gauge the association of altered cortical thinning with clini-
cally relevant phenotypes, we again turned to the PNC cohort,
whichincludedadetailed,standardizedclinicalcharacterization
of all participants. Of the 861 youths included in the MRI analy-
sis, clinical evaluations determined that 248 were typically

Finally, to confirm that the associations of fortification ex-
posure with cortical thinning were not themselves con-
founded by the inclusion of individuals with psychosis spec-
trum symptoms in the PNC cohort, we repeated the original
analysis of quadratic thinning using only typically develop-
ing individuals or participants with other types of psycho-

Discussion
Evaluating 3 independent MRI cohorts of 8- to 18-year-old
youths, we investigated the association of prenatal exposure
to folic acid fortification with subsequent cortical develop-
ment through adolescence. Within a large clinical cohort
(MGH), we observed widespread increases in frontal and tem-
poral cortical thickness between comparable groups of youths
who gestated just after, compared with just before, the roll-
out of folic acid fortification. Youths who gestated during the
rollout, and who therefore had partial exposure, demon-
strated intermediate increases, consistent with a dose asso-
ciation. Exposure-associated differences were most pro-
nounced in younger individuals, and in 2 regions (left inferior

A, Surface-wide maps of age-squared associations with cortical thickness in fully
exposed (n = 99) minus nonexposed (n = 97) Massachusetts General Hospital
(MGH) cohort scans reveal increased age-related quadratic thinning among
individuals exposed to folic acid fortification during gestation. Nonexposed
greater than fully exposed indicates that cool colors show regions for which β
values are greater in the group that was not exposed to fortification. More
negative β values reflect stronger quadratic thinning. The cool color (ie, shades
of blue) reflects the negative age-squared term in the fully exposed group.
B, Age-thickness scatterplot of MGH cohort, indicating emergence of quadratic
(delayed) left inferior parietal lobule thinning in participants born after
fortification was implemented. C, Surface-wide maps of age-squared
associations with cortical thickness in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental
Cohort (PNC) (n = 861) indicate age-related quadratic thinning in frontal,
inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) regions, again
driven by delayed thinning in fully exposed individuals. D, Age-thickness

right (R) ITG. E, Within the L IPL cluster that demonstrated exposure-associated
differences in quadratic thinning in the MGH cohort (A and B), analysis of the
nonexposed National Institutes of Health Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of
Normal Brain Development (NIH) cohort indicates linear thinning (evident at
the earliest time point). F, Similarly, within the L IPL and R ITG clusters that
demonstrated quadratic thinning in the PNC cohort (C and D), only linear
thinning was seen in the NIH cohort (383 scans). A and B, Images are masked to
show only clusters that survive correction for multiple comparisons (P < .05,
clusterwise; for PNC cohort L IPL, the displayed cluster was too small to survive
correction at P < .05 but is significant at P < .01). Cortical thickness values in
scatterplots represent z-transformed residuals after controlling for nuisance
covariates.

 temporal and inferior parietal), we observed a delay in the on-
set of age-associated cortical thinning. An analogous pattern
was evident in the contemporaneous PNC cohort: individu-
als who were exposed to folic acid fortification exhibited de-
lays of cortical thinning of similar duration, which occurred
in similar frontal, temporal, and parietal regions as those iden-
tified in the MGH cohort. Flatter age-related thinning profiles
wereassociatedwithreducedriskofpsychosisspectrumsymp-
toms in this cohort. In contrast, the NIH cohort, comprising
only individuals who were not exposed to fortification, ex-
hibited earlier cortical thinning in the same regions. Collec-
tively, these data suggest an association of prenatal exposure
to folic acid fortification with increased cortical thickness
through early adolescence, accompanied by delayed onset of
cortical thinning and reduced risk of psychosis.

A, In each of the 4 clusters exhibiting delayed cortical thinning in the PNC
cohort, local cortical thinning slope was calculated for each individual based on
the best-fit line of thickness vs age among all nearby individuals (±6 months).
Insets demonstrate local slopes for an 11.0-year-old (left) and a 15.0-year-old
(right) participant. B, Mean local slopes for participants in each diagnostic
group, in each of the 4 clusters. For example, individuals with psychosis
spectrum (PS) symptoms tended to have more negative slopes than those with
other diagnoses. Local slopes reflect change in z-transformed cortical thickness
scores (adjusted for nuisance covariates) during 1 year. C, Multinomial logistic
regression models associated with diagnosis (PS, psychosis low [PL], or other
psychopathologic condition [OP] relative to typically developing [TD]; n = 248)
of each participant based on local slope, covarying for age, sex, total brain
volume, and method of ascertaining diagnosis. Lower adjusted odds ratios
indicate reduced odds of psychopathologic condition in the presence of flatter
(less negative) local thinning slope, a pattern that was significant for PS in 3 of 4
regions tested. All P values are false discovery rate corrected. All error bars
indicate 95% CIs. IPL indicates inferior parietal lobule; ITG, inferior temporal

The present findings also raise questions about the long-
lasting effects of variation in the fetal methylome because fo-
late supplies 1-carbon moieties that regulate gene expres-
sion. One possibility suggested by the present results is that
programming of cortical maturation in youths is sensitive to
fetal folate levels, potentially via epigenetic modification of
genes that regulate cortical development,34 repair of de novo
mutations,35 or mitigation of toxic exposures.36-39 Although,
to our knowledge, these results are the first to link prenatal ex-
posure to folic acid fortification to changes in subsequent cor-
tical development, the specific mechanisms underlying these
effects have yet to be elucidated.
