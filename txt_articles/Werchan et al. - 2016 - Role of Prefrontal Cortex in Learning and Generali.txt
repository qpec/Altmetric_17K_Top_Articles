Introduction
A defining feature of flexible human cognition is the ability to
derive hierarchical rules from experience. Hierarchical rules
group together sets of lower-order rules that can be cued by
higher-order contexts (Frank and Badre, 2012; Collins and
Frank, 2013; Collins et al., 2014; Donoso et al., 2014; Collins and
Frank, 2016). For instance, individuals in bilingual environments
might use hierarchical rules to help learn and separate multiple
languages specifying object–label mappings. In this framework,
individuals may use a higher-order context, such as the identity of
a speaker, to determine an appropriate rule set to use (e.g., lan-
guage grouping together object–label mappings; Fig. 1).
Prior behavioral work suggests that adults spontaneously and
incidentallycreatehierarchicalruleswhenlearningsimplestimulus-
action rules through reinforcement, which supports learning in new
contexts (Collins and Frank, 2013; Collins et al., 2014, 2016). Com-
putational models suggest that the formation of hierarchical rules is
supported by dopamine-innervated circuits between PFC and stria-
tum (Frank and Badre, 2012; Collins and Frank, 2013). Specifically,
these models posit that frontostriatal circuits are hierarchically
nested, such that a higher-order context cues a valid rule set to up-

Significance Statement
Hierarchical rule learning is a powerful learning mechanism that allows rules to be selected in a context-appropriate fashion and
transferred or reused in novel contexts. Data from computational models and adults suggests that this learning mechanism is
supported by dopamine-innervated interactions between prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum. Here, we provide evidence that
PFC also supports hierarchical rule learning during infancy, challenging the current dogma that PFC is an underdeveloped brain
system until adolescence. These results add new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms available to support learning and
generalization in very early postnatal life, providing evidence that PFC and the frontostriatal circuitry are involved in organizing
learning and behavior earlier in life than previously known.

 date and maintain in PFC in an anterior circuit, which then con-
strainsthestimulus–responserulesthatcanbeselectedinaposterior

work to learn which rule sets are valid for a given context, as well as
thevalidstimulus–responserulesforagivenruleset.Theyalsoallow
a learner to discover when a previously valid rule set can be trans-
ferred to a novel context.
Recent research provides behavioral evidence that 8-month-
old infants also spontaneously construct hierarchical rules when
learning simple visual stimulus–response associations, which
supports generalization in novel contexts (Werchan et al., 2015).
Infants’ eye blink rate, which is an exploratory measure of striatal
dopamine activity (Karson, 1983), also increased when higher-
order rules switched during learning. However, PFC has a pro-
tracted developmental course, not reaching maturity until
adolescence (Huttenlocher, 1979). Therefore, one prediction is
that behavioral evidence of hierarchical rule learning in infants is
not supported by the same frontostriatal circuitry as seen in
adults. For example, because the striatum shows relatively high
functionality compared with PFC in early infancy (Chugani,
1996), hierarchical rule learning may weight striatal involvement
more heavily than frontal involvement until PFC is sufficiently
mature to contribute to this form of learning later in life.
Alternatively, hierarchical rule learning might be supported by
similar frontostriatal circuitry in infants as in adults. In this view,
protracted development might reflect adaptation to increasingly
complexnichesoverdevelopment,ratherthanchangesinthenature
of the computations performed by PFC. In infancy, PFC may sup-
port hierarchical rule learning relevant to structuring language or
social cognition, for example. When the environment requires
learning of more complex rules for action during childhood and
adolescence, such as those required to play a musical instrument or
drive a car, this circuitry (and hierarchical extensions thereof in an-
terior PFC) may be adapted to support these increasingly complex
demands.
Therefore, in the current study, we used near-infrared spec-
troscopy (NIRS) to examine PFC activity during a simple hierar-
chical rule-learning task that required 8-month-old infants to
learn sets of audiovisual toy–word pairings across different
higher-order face–voice contexts (Fig. 1). We predicted that, if
PFC is involved in hierarchical rule learning in infants, then in-
creased PFC activity should be observed when infants switch be-
tween two higher-order rules (switch conditions) compared with
when the higher-order rule stays the same (stay conditions). In
this context, “rule switching” refers, not to response switching,
but rather to switching between observing two different hierar-
chical rule structures (Fig. 1). Importantly, we expected that these
differences would emerge to a greater extent over the course of
learning. Specifically, computational models and prior work with
adults suggest that switching-related PFC activity should be
greater after rule structures are learned (Collins and Frank, 2013;
Collins et al., 2014).
Materials and Methods
Participants
The final sample consisted of 37 healthy 8-month-old human infants (20
females, 17 males; mean age � 8.5 months, SD � 0.43). All infants were
full-term with no current or past history of severe health problems, de-
velopmental delays, or birth complications. An additional 3 infants were
tested, but their data were discarded due to fussiness or crying (n � 2) or
NIRS recording interference from hair (n � 1). The study was approved
by the local institutional review board and all parents or legal guardians
provided written, informed consent before participation. All families
were compensated for time and travel to our laboratory.
Procedure
Behavioral procedures
Task overview. Behavioral procedures replicated the methods used by Wer-
chan et al. (2015). During the study, infants participated in a learning task, a
generalizationtask,andaviolation-of-expectationinferencetest.Duringthe
learning and generalization task, infants were familiarized with trials that
consisted of a face followed by an audiovisual toy–word pairing during a
learning task and a generalization task (Fig. 1). The faces were discriminable
female faces (taken from the NimStim Face Stimulus Set; Tottenham et al.,
2009)andthetoysweredifferentanimatedtoys.Fourartificialmonosyllabic
words (“jic,” “mip,” “dax,” and “tiv”) were used, with a different word as-
signed to the same object in each of the two rule sets. Each unique word was
spoken by one of two female speakers. The mappings among faces, voices,
toys, and words were counterbalanced.
The learning task was designed so that infants could learn the pairings
in multiple ways: infants could either learn the face–voice/toy–word
pairings as four simple individual associations or use the face–voice map-
pings as higher-order contexts to create two rule sets (RS1 and RS2)
grouping together simpler toy–word associations or rules (i.e., a rudi-
mentary language, which could then be transferred to other contexts
cueing that same set). This is similar to learning that mom is associated
with an “English” rule set and that dad is associated with a “Spanish” rule
set in our earlier example. The initial learning task was split into two
blocks in which the higher-order stimulus (e.g., face–voice speaker con-

 texts) switched from one trial to the next, requiring infants to update the
currently relevant rule set into working memory (Switch 1 and Switch 2
conditions) and two blocks in which the higher-order rule stayed the
same on each trial (Stay 1 and Stay 2 conditions; Fig. 1B). We recorded
infants’ frontal cortical activity across left and right dorsolateral PFC
(dlPFC) and medial PFC (mPFC) during the learning task using NIRS
(Fig. 2A,B).
After the learning task, we presented infants with a novel face and voice
that was associated with a previously learned rule set during a generaliza-
tion task (RS1-A; similar to observing that grandma also uses object–
label mappings consistent with a “Spanish” rule set). Importantly, we
also introduced a novel toy–word pairing that could be appended to this
rule set (similar to observing grandma speaking a Spanish word for a new
object that had not been previously experienced with dad; Fig. 1). During
a final inference test, we presented infants with trials in which faces and
voices from the initial learning task were presented with the novel toy–
word pairing from the generalization task. The purpose of this inference
test was to determine whether infants had appended the novel toy–word
pairing to the existing latent rule set (rather than only to the specific face
with which it was presented) and transferred it back to other speakers
associated with that rule set (similar to inferring that dad, but not mom,
should use the novel object–label mapping used by grandma; Fig. 1). If
infants learned the rule structures and used these structures to make
inferences about novel face–voice/toy–word pairings, then we predicted
that infants should look longer to the inconsistent pairings that violated
the learned rule structures. If infants did not adopt a hierarchical rule set
structure, then we expected to find no difference in looking time between
the consistent and inconsistent trials.
Learning task. During the learning task, infants saw four different pair-
ings of faces and voices with toys and words. Two discriminable female
faces and voices, two toys, and four monosyllabic pseudowords were
used in these pairings. All mappings among faces, voices, toys, and words
were counterbalanced. Each face was associated with a unique voice (e.g.,
Face 1 was always associated with Voice 1, and Face 2 was always associ-
ated with Voice 2). Both of the face–voice mappings were associated with
the same two toys (e.g., both Face 1 and Face 2 were paired with a cartoon
duck and a rattle); however, each face–voice mapping used different
words to label the same toys, akin to learning in a bilingual environment.
Infants received four blocks of eight trials during learning, for a total of 32
trials (eight trials per pairing). During each trial, infants would first see the
face on the left side of the screen. After 500 ms, a toy appeared on the right
side of the screen for an additional 1500 ms while a recorded female voice
said the artificial word associated with the pairing. There was a 1000 ms
interval between trials. The four blocks consisted of two rule switch condi-
tions (Switch 1 and Switch 2) in which the higher-order face–voice context
changed each trial and two rule stay conditions (Stay 1 and Stay 2) in which
the higher-order face–voice context stayed the same each trial. Each block
was preceded by a 10 s baseline interval to allow blood volume to return to
baseline levels, during which time a black screen with a white fixation cross
was presented. Previous studies indicate that 10 s is sufficient for blood
volume to return to baseline levels (Wilcox et al., 2008, 2009). The order of
blocks was counterbalanced between participants.
Generalization task. Immediately after the learning task, we presented
infants with three new pairings of faces, voices, toys, and words. These
pairings could again be grouped by the face and voice to form a rule set
(RS1-A) identical to one experienced during the learning task (RS1);
however, this rule set was now associated with a novel higher-order face–
voice context. In addition, one novel toy–word association was added to
the rule set (Fig. 1A). Infants again received eight trials per pairing, as in
the learning task, for a total of 24 trials.
Inference test. After the generalization task, infants saw the faces and
voices from the original learning task paired with the novel toy–word
association from the generalization task. One of these pairings of faces,
voices, toys, and words was consistent with the rule set structure formed
during the tasks, whereas the other pairing was inconsistent with this
rule-set structure (Fig. 1A). Infants received two consistent trials and two
inconsistent trials during the inference test. The order of test trials was
intermixed and counterbalanced across subjects. During each test trial,
infants saw the face and toy while a recorded voice said the word associ-
ated with the toy once every 3 s. Each trial continued until the infant
looked away for �2 s, up to a maximum of 60 s. The dependent behav-
ioral measure was the average looking time during the consistent trials
compared with the average looking time during the inconsistent trials.
Looking time was measured by condition-blind manual coding of the
video recordings. Reliability was verified by a second rater coding a sub-
set of the videos (n � 10). Interrater reliability was high (r � 0.97).
NIRS recording procedures
Infants’ frontal cortical activity was recorded during the learning task
using a TechEn CW6 NIRS system with wavelengths set at 695 and 830
nm. Raw signals were continuously sampled at 50 Hz. An array consisting
of 12 optodes (4 sources and 8 detectors, resulting in 10 source-detector
channels) with an interoptode separation of 3 cm was placed over infants’
frontal brain regions on each hemisphere. The array was arranged in a
lattice pattern (Fig. 2A), which was fixed on sturdy, flexible plastic to
ensure that the distance between the sources and detectors remained
constant at 3 cm. The optode array was then attached inside of an adjust-
able neoprene headband to secure the optodes to the scalp. The array was

 placed over infants’ scalps using standardized coordinates corresponding
to frontal cortical regions, with the lower edge of the optode array posi-
tioned in line with the Fp1–Fpz–Fp2 line in the international 10–20
system (Fig. 2A; Jasper, 1958). The vertical midline of the optode array
was centered across the nasion–inion line.
After recording, the data were preprocessed in HomER 2.0 using the
default preprocessing pipeline (Huppert et al., 2009). First, the raw sig-
nals (acquired at 50 Hz) were digitally band-pass filtered at 0.01–0.1 Hz
to remove systematic physiological and movement artifacts (White et al.,
2009; Homae et al., 2010). Second, the change in optical density was
calculated for each wavelength relative to the 10 s baseline before block
onset, during which a black screen with a white fixation cross was pre-
sented. Third, changes in the concentration of oxygenated and deoxy-
genated hemoglobin were calculated from the changes in optical density
using the modified Beer–Lambert law. Next, motion artifacts were de-
tected by identifying signal fluctuations ��5 �M over a 0.5 s range in
each channel (Lloyd-Fox et al., 2009; Emberson et al., 2015). This indi-
cated that no motion artifacts occurred during the four blocks of interest
(Stay 1, Stay 2, Switch 1, and Switch 2), so all blocks were retained for
subsequent data analysis. Finally, changes in oxygenated hemoglobin
(relative to the 10 s baseline) in each of the 10 source-detector channels
were exported for subsequent analysis by averaging across every 4 s of
each 24 s block starting 4 s after block onset to account for the hemody-
namic response lag (Miezin et al., 2000). This created a total of five time
intervals for each block during the learning task.
The 10 source-detector channels were divided and averaged into four
regions of interest for subsequent data analysis, with the two left-most
channels corresponding to left dlPFC, the three center-left channels cor-
responding to left mPFC, the three center-right channels corresponding
to right mPFC, and the two right-most channels corresponding to right
dlPFC (Fig. 2A). These regions of interest were verified by estimating
measurement sensitivity to these cortical regions (based on the position-
ing of the optode array in reference to standardized 10–20 coordinates as
described above) using AtlasViewer NIRS image reconstruction tools
(Fig. 2B; Aasted et al., 2015).
Eye blink rate measures
Inadditiontomeasuringfrontalactivity,wealsomeasuredinfants’eyeblink
rate during learning, which is thought to be a physiological correlate of
striatal dopamine activity (Karson, 1983; Shukla, 1985; Blin et al., 1990;
Kleven and Koek, 1996; Taylor et al., 1999; e.g., Colzato et al., 2009). Evi-
dence for this association comes from several sources. For example, the use
of dopamine agonists and antagonists systematically increases and decreases
eye blink rate in nonhuman primates (Karson, 1983; Elsworth et al., 1991;
KlevenandKoek,1996;JutkiewiczandBergman,2004).Eyeblinkrateisalso
altered in clinical populations associated with dopaminergic dysfunction.
For example, increased eye blink rate is observed in schizophrenic patients
(Freed et al., 1980; Mohr et al., 2005), who have increased striatal dopami-
nergic activity, whereas decreased eye blink rate is observed in Parkinson’s
disease patients (Deuschl and Goddemeier, 1988; Bodfish et al., 1995; Blan-
dini et al., 2000) and in recreational cocaine users (Colzato et al., 2008), two
populations associated with substantial loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic
cells. Numerous studies also provide evidence that eye blink rate is reliably
altered during cognitive tasks that are associated with dopaminergic func-
tioning. For example, in adults, increased eye blink rate is associated with
increased cognitive flexibility (e.g., flexibly switching between tasks), during
positive compared with negative feedback learning (Slagter et al., 2015), and
during working memory tasks (Dreisbach et al., 2005; Mu
¨ller et al., 2007),
whereas phasic decreases in eye blink rate are associated with increases in
visualattentionandcognitiveload(Tada,1978;Fukudaetal.,2005;Ohetal.,
2012). Blink rate is also predictive of the effects of dopamine agonists on
reinforcement learning (Cavanagh et al., 2014). Although less is currently
known about the relation between eye blink rate and dopaminergic func-
tioningduringinfancy,eyeblinkrateisfoundtoincreaseduringfeedingand
presentation of novel stimuli in infants, which is also influenced by dopa-
mine agonists (for review, see Bacher and Smotherman, 2004). Notably,
increased eye blink rate has also been observed when infants switch between
higher-order rules during hierarchical rule-learning tasks (Werchan et al.,
2015).
We used this evidence to generate a specific prediction about the rela-
tionship between infants’ eye blink rate and PFC activity to consider an
exploratory analysis that could implicate the involvement of dopamine-
innervated frontostriatal circuitry during learning (note that we do not
have the ability to image subcortical areas directly with NIRS). Infants’
eye blink rate was measured during the learning task by manually review-
ing the recorded videos frame by frame to identify eye blinks during the
learning task. Eye closures were counted as a blink when both of infants’
eyelids closed symmetrically for 100–500 ms. Eye closures due to coughs,
sneezes, or yawns were not counted as valid blinks. We predicted that, if
hierarchical rule learning and generalization is supported by dopamine-
innervated circuits between PFC and striatum in infants, then a relation-
ship between infants’ eye blink rate and PFC activity should be greatest
during the switch conditions, when infants must update learned rule sets
into working memory, relative to the stay conditions during the learning
task. Moreover, we also predicted that infants’ eye blink rate and PFC
activity during rule switching should together predict infants’ ability to
make inferences about novel face–voice/toy–word pairings during the
final inference test, as measured by infants’ looking to the inconsistent
relative to the consistent pairings.
Results
Behavioral results
We examined infants’ looking time between the pairings that
were consistent versus inconsistent with the rule set structure
during the final inference test (Fig. 3A). We predicted that infants
should look longer at the inconsistent relative to the consistent
pairings if the hierarchical rule structure was learned. This test
indicated that infants looked longer at the inconsistent pairing
than at the consistent pairing (t(36) � 1.975, p � 0.05), replicating
our earlier finding that infants created hierarchical rule sets and

longer at the inconsistent pairing, providing evidence that they constructed hierarchical rule sets and used these sets to make inferences about novel pairings. Error bars indicate SEM.

 used these sets to generalize toy–word mappings across speaker
contexts (Fig. 3B).
Eye blink rate
We next examined infants’ eye blink rate during the initial learn-
ing task. Specifically, we tested the prediction that infants’ aver-
age eye blink rate per trial should be greatest during the second
half of rule switching, after the rule sets are likely learned, based
on prior findings showing that infants have increased eye blinks
when higher-order rules switch after learning (Werchan et al.,
2015). We conducted a repeated-measures ANOVA using block
(Block 1 vs Block 2) and condition (switch vs stay) as within-
subject factors. This test revealed a block by condition interaction
(F(1,36) � 4.084, p � 0.051). Subsequent within- and between-
condition comparisons showed that this interaction was driven
by increased eye blinks per trial during Switch 2 relative to Switch
1 (t(36) � 3.104, p � 0.004, Bonferroni corrected � set to 0.008;
Fig. 4).
NIRS results
We examined differences in infants’ cortical activity, as measured
by changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2), during each of
the four conditions of the learning task (Stay 1, Stay 2, Switch 1,
and Switch 2) and across the four regions of interest (left dlPFC,
left mPFC, right dlPFC, and right mPFC; Fig. 2A,B) and assessed
whether this neural activity varied as a function of whether in-
fants successfully generalized learned rules. Changes in HbO2
responses were calculated by averaging the HbO2 response across
every 4 s of each 24 s block (starting 4 s after block onset to
account for the hemodynamic response lag; Miezin et al., 2000).
This created a total of five time intervals for each block. Changes
in HbO2 responses were measured relative to a 10 s baseline pe-
riod before block onset for each condition, where the baseline
period consisted of presenting a black screen with a white fixation
cross. We conducted an omnibus repeated-measures ANOVA
with time interval (average HbO2 response across the five time
intervals for each condition), region of interest (left dlPFC, left
mPFC, right dlPFC, and right mPFC), and condition (Stay 1, Stay
2, Switch 1, and Switch 2) as within-subject factors and learning
score (infants’ looking to the inconsistent–consistent test trials)
as a continuous variable. This analysis revealed a significant
3-way interaction among time interval, region, and condition
(F(36,1260) � 1.686, p � 0.007, �p
2 � 0.046). To determine which of
the four regions of interest exhibited significant differences in
activity
in
this
three-way
interaction,
we
next
conduc-
ted four separate repeated-measures ANOVAs with time interval
and condition as within-subject factors and learning score as a
continuous variable. This test (� set to a corrected 0.0125 value)
revealed significant interactions between time interval and con-
dition for right dlPFC only (F(12,420) � 2.219, p � 0.01, �p
2 �
0.060). This interaction was not significant for left dlPFC
(F(12,420) � 0.798, p � 0.653, �p
2 � 0.022), left mPFC (F(12,420) �
0.601, p � 0.842, �p
2 � 0.017), or right mPFC (F(12,420) � 0.575,
p � 0.862, �p
2 � 0.016).
We next examined right dlPFC activity separately for all com-
binations of conditions from the previous interactions (Switch 1
vs Stay 1, Switch 1 vs Switch 2, Stay 1 vs Stay 2, Stay 2 vs Switch 2,
Switch 1 vs Stay 2, and Stay 1 vs Switch 2). We compared the
change in right dlPFC activity over time between conditions
rather than within single conditions to test the prediction that
switching between higher-order rules (in the switch conditions)
would evoke a greater increase in PFC activation than switching
between simpler, lower-order rules (in the stay conditions). We
used a Bonferroni-corrected � value set to 0.008 (0.05/6). These
analyses showed a significant 3-way interaction among interval,
condition, and learning score for right dlPFC in Stay 2 versus
Switch 2 only (F(4,140) � 5.328, p � 0.001, �p
2 � 0.132; full results
for all comparisons are reported in Table 1), which indicates that
infants who had better learning and subsequent transfer of the
rule structures also had a greater increase in right dlPFC activity
across the Switch 2 block relative to the Stay 2 block (Figs. 5, 6A).
To verify this interpretation, we tested the precise relations
among infants’ learning scores and HbO2 responses across the
significant conditions from the prior analyses (Switch 2 and Stay
2). To examine this, we performed two regression analyses using
infants’ right dlPFC activity during either Switch 2 or Stay 2 as
predictor variables and infants’ learning scores as the dependent
variable. Results indicated that right dlPFC activity during Switch
2 was trending toward predicting learning scores (F(5,31) � 2.081,
p � 0.095, R 2 � 0.251), but right dlPFC activity during Stay 2 was
not a significant predictor of learning scores (F(5,31) � 1.324, p �
0.280, R 2 � 0.176).
Interactions among eye blink rate, PFC activity, and learning
Next, we examined the interaction between increased PFC activ-
ity and infants’ eye blink rate to consider exploratory evidence of
dopamine-mediated frontostriatal involvement during learning.
Specifically, we tested the prediction that a relationship between
increased PFC activity and eye blink rate would be greatest when
infants must switch between higher-order rules during the sec-
ond rule switch block, after the rule sets are likely learned. To
investigate this, we calculated the interaction between the change
in right dlPFC activity and eye blink rate by multiplying the
change in right dlPFC activity (from the beginning of each block
to the end of each block, which is captured in the prior interac-
tions between learning score with time interval; Fig. 5), with the
average eye blink rate for each of the four conditions. We then
performed six repeated-measures ANOVAs comparing differ-
ences between this interaction in all combinations of conditions
(Switch 1 vs Stay 1, Switch 1 vs Switch 2, Stay 1 vs Stay 2, Stay 2 vs
Switch 2, Stay 1 vs Switch 2, and Switch 1 vs Stay 2) using learning
score as a continuous variable. We used a Bonferroni-corrected �
value set to 0.008 (0.05/6). These analyses indicated that there was
a significant main effect of condition in the interaction for Switch
2 relative to Switch 1 only (F(1,35) � 8.447, p � 0.006, �p
2 � 0.194),
which reflected the fact that right dlPFC activity and eye blink rate

action between right dlPFC activity and eye blink rate was greater in

We then conducted a regression analysis to determine
whether the interaction between right dlPFC activity and eye
blink rate during Switch 2 was related to transfer performance
during the inference test. We used right dlPFC activity, eye blink
rate, and the interaction between right dlPFC activity and eye
blink rate during Switch 2 as predictor variables. This regression
analysis indicated that the conjunction between eye blink rate
and the change in right dlPFC activity significantly predicted
transfer performance (� � 0.885, p � 0.001; Fig. 6B). We per-
formed a control regression analysis using infants’ learning score
rank order as a dependent variable to ensure that the results were
not due to any one infant with an unusually high or low learning
score. The results indicated that the conjunction between eye
blink rate and PFC activation remained marginally significant
(� � 0.512, p � 0.097) and explained statistically more variance
than either eye blink rate or PFC activation alone (� � �0.242,
p � 0.371, and � � �0.218, p � 0.300, respectively). Together,
these findings indicate that infants who had better learning and
subsequent transfer of the hierarchical rule structures also had
increased right dlPFC activity combined with increased eye

Discussion
Here, we examined the neural circuitry supporting hierarchical
rule learning in 8-month-old infants by using NIRS to record
infants’ PFC activity during a hierarchical rule-learning task. Our
behavioral results replicated previous findings and showed that
infants spontaneously create hierarchical rule structures during
incidental learning and use these structures to make generaliza-
tions in novel contexts (Werchan et al., 2015). Notably, however,
our results showed that increases in PFC activation relate to this
learning mechanism in 8-month-old infants, a skill that was pre-
viously assumed to emerge later in life in parallel with the pro-
tracted anatomical development of PFC. In particular, we
provide novel evidence that infants had increased right dlPFC
activity during the second half of learning, when higher-order
rules switched from one trial to the next, requiring infants to
update the currently relevant rule representation in working
memory relative to when the higher-order rules stayed the same
from one trial to the next. We also measured eye blink rate, which
is thought to be a physiological correlate of striatal dopamine
activity (Karson, 1983; Shukla, 1985; Blin et al., 1990; Kleven and
Koek, 1996; Taylor et al., 1999; Colzato et al., 2009), and found
that infants had increased eye blink rate during the second half of
rule switching, replicating prior findings (Werchan et al., 2015).
Critically, we also found novel evidence that infants’ transfer of
hierarchical rule structures was related to the conjunction of right
dlPFC activity and eye blink rate, potentially indicative of
dopamine-mediated frontostriatal circuitry in hierarchical rule
learning in infancy.
Our finding that infants had increased eye blink rate during
the second half of rule switching suggests the potential in-
volvement of dopamine-related processes during learning,
based on prior findings indicating a relationship between in-
creased eye blink rate and tonic dopamine firing (Karson,
1983; Shukla, 1985; Blin et al., 1990; Kleven and Koek, 1996;
Taylor et al., 1999; e.g., Colzato et al., 2009). However, com-
putational models suggest that phasic dopamine firing relates
to reward prediction errors during learning, which drives
learning of hierarchical rule structures (Frank and Badre,
2012; Collins and Frank, 2013). This raises the question of
what increased eye blink rate reflects in relation to hierarchical
rule learning in our current findings. One possibility is that
tonic dopamine may reflect accumulation of phasic dopamine
across learning (due to spillover; Niv et al., 2007); therefore, as
learning occurs, tonic dopamine levels may increase, leading
to increased eye blink rate during the second switch block
relative to the first. It is also possible that either tonic or phasic
changes in dopamine translate to changes in eye blink rate.
However, given that eye blink rate is an exploratory measure,
particularly in infants and in relation to phasic changes in
dopamine, more research is needed to corroborate these find-
ings and come to a more conclusive understanding of the exact
nature of eye blink rate in relation to learning in infants.
Our finding that infants had increased right dlPFC activity
during rule switch trials in the second half of learning also aligns
with prior electrophysiology work showing that ERPs over right
dlPFC are related to switching between hierarchical rules during
incidental hierarchical rule learning in adults (Collins et al.,
2014). It also aligns with predictions that arise from neural net-
work models of spontaneous hierarchical rule learning, which
indicates that the network must first learn relevant mappings
between contexts and rule structures before PFC reliably switches
between the rule structures (Collins and Frank, 2013). Before this
learning, the network model could update PFC representations
even when a switch had not occurred or it could fail to update
when a switch did occur, so the model predicts no reliable differ-
ence in PFC activity between switch and stay blocks during early
learning. Moreover, our finding that the conjunction between
infants’ dlPFC activity and eye blink rate during rule switch trials
predicted behavioral performance during the inference test is
consistent with findings in adults indicating that ERP responses
over dlPFC also predict generalization of learned rule structures
in novel contexts (Collins et al., 2014). These findings are also
consistent with prior work showing a more general role for dlPFC
in the application and maintenance of abstract rules after initial
learning (White and Wise, 1999; Goel and Dolan, 2000; Seger et
al., 2000; Strange et al., 2001; Bunge, 2004).
An alternative possibility is that the increased dlPFC activity
that was observed during rule switching might reflect cortical
responses to changes in perceptual features, such as changes in
the perceptual features of the faces, rather than cortical responses
to changes in the higher-order rule from one trial to the next.
However, if dlPFC activity reflected changes in perceptual fea-
tures rather than changes in the higher-order rule, then dlPFC
activity should be similar during the first and second switch
blocks, which were perceptually equivalent to one another. Be-
cause significant dlPFC activity was only observed during the
second rule switch block, after the rule structures were likely
learned, it is unlikely that our results reflect cortical responses to
changes in perceptual features. Further, the fact that right dlPFC
activity combined with eye blink rate predicted transfer perfor-
mance during the final inference test provides further support
that our results reflect cortical responses to switching between
higher-order rules.
Another important note is that, in the PFC activation data,
differences were found between Stay 2 and Switch 2, whereas
differences were found between Switch 1 and Switch 2 for the eye
blink rate data. These apparent discrepancies may reflect differ-
ences in the underlying processes captured by eye blink rate and
PFC activity. For instance, if eye blink rate reflects dopamine-
related processes, then differences in blink rate may gradually
emerge as the rule sets are acquired through dopaminergic-based
reward prediction learning, leading to differences between
Switch 1 and Switch 2 over the course of learning. In contrast, if
PFC activation reflects updating or switching between acquired
rule sets, then differences in PFC activity during rule switch rel-
ative to rule stay blocks would likely only emerge after the rule
sets are acquired, leading to differences between Stay 2 and
Switch 2. These findings are supported by computational models,
which suggest that reward prediction errors are greatest early in
learning and that relevant mappings between contexts and rule
structures must be learned before PFC can reliably switch be-
tween the rule structures (Collins and Frank, 2013).
Our results are somewhat surprising, however, given that PFC
is not thought to reach maturity until adolescence (Huttenlocher,
1979) and rule learning and working memory processes are
thought to have a similarly protracted course of development
(Crone et al., 2006; Bunge and Zelazo, 2006). How, then, can we
reconcile our current findings with what is known about the
maturational state of PFC in infancy? One possibility is that PFC
is functional and performs similar computations across the lifes-
pan, but these computations are adapted for learning demands
and inputs that are appropriate to infants in their unique ecolog-
10320 • J. Neurosci., October 5, 2016 • 36(40):10314–10322

 ical niche (Rovee-Collier and Cuevas, 2009). For instance, this
general mechanism may help infants raised in bilingual environ-
ments separate languages without having to learn every word in
each context, as supported by our current behavioral findings.
Similarly, it may also help infants organize visual information
in such a way that affords generalization in novel contexts
(Werchan et al., 2015). As the learning demands present in an
individual’s ecological niche change across development, this
PFC-supported learning mechanism (and hierarchical exten-
sions thereof in anterior PFC) might then be adapted to support
more complex learning demands in the environment, such as
cognitive control of complex thought and action in more mature
learners. Therefore, previous studies that have observed pro-
tracted developmental trajectories of complex rule learning may
broadly reflect mismatches between the niche-specific functions
that these mechanisms are adapted to support and the functions
that a particular task tests, rather than reflecting immaturity of
PFC per se.
A further possibility is that adults might use a more advanced
hierarchical nesting of frontostriatal circuits to perform such rule
learning and transfer. Although the hierarchical structure in the
current task is analogous to that in the adult studies (Collins and
Frank, 2013; Collins et al., 2014; Collins and Frank, 2016), the
latter studies clearly impose more demands on using hierarchical
rules to contextualize selection of arbitrary actions, where both
the rule structures and the actions have to be learned simultane-
ously, whereas the infant studies do not require such action con-
trol. Therefore, infants might engage similar circuits and
computations that do not require as advanced processing across
multiple stages along the rostrocaudal axis of PFC.
In summary, our results provide evidence that dlPFC is impli-
cated in hierarchical rule learning in 8-month-old infants, sup-
porting the formation of abstract rules that afford flexible
behavior and generalization in novel environments. Our results
showing a relationship between dlPFC activity and eye blink rate
in predicting transfer performance also provides exploratory ev-
idence for involvement of dopamine-innervated frontostriatal
circuitry in hierarchical rule learning in infancy. In addition to
increasing our general understanding of the fundamental learn-
ing mechanisms available to infants, these results also provide
novel insights into the functional role of PFC and frontostriatal
circuitry in learning and behavior during early life. In contrast to
prior notions that PFC and complex rule learning mechanisms
are slow developing, these results suggest an important role for
PFC and frontostriatal circuitry in learning during early life.
Future work is needed to examine how this basic learning
mechanism and its supporting neural circuitry might then be
adapted to support increasingly complex learning demands
across development.
