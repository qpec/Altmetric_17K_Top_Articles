Malignancies after mitoxantrone for
multiple sclerosis
A retrospective cohort study
ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess the therapy-related risk of malignancies in mitoxantrone-treated patients
with multiple sclerosis.
Methods: This retrospective observational cohort study included all mitoxantrone-treated pa-
tients with multiple sclerosis seen at our department between 1994 and 2007. We collected
follow-up information on medically confirmed malignancies, life status, and cause of death, as
of 2010. Malignancy rates were compared to the German national cancer registry matched for
sex, age, and year of occurrence.
Results: Follow-up was completed in 676 of 677 identified patients. Median follow-up time was
8.7 years (interquartile range 6.8–11.2), corresponding to 6,220 person-years. Median cumula-
tive mitoxantrone dose was 79.0 mg/m2 (interquartile range 50.8–102.4). Thirty-seven patients
(5.5%) were diagnosed with a malignancy after mitoxantrone initiation, revealing a standardized
incidence ratio of 1.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–2.08). Entities included breast cancer
(n 5 9), colorectal cancer (n 5 7), acute myeloid leukemia (n 5 4, 0.6%), and others (each entity
n 5 1 or 2). The standardized incidence ratio of colorectal cancer was 2.98 (95% CI 1.20–6.14)
and of acute myeloid leukemia 10.44 (95% CI 3.39–24.36). It was not increased for other
entities including breast cancer. Multivariate Cox regression identified higher age at treatment
initiation but neither cumulative mitoxantrone dose (.75 vs #75 mg/m2) nor treatment with other
immunosuppressive drugs or sex as a risk factor. Fifty-five patients had died, among them 12 of
a malignancy and 43 reportedly of other causes.
Conclusions: While the overall incidence of malignancies was only mildly increased, the risk of leu-
kemia and colorectal cancer was heightened. If confirmed, posttherapy colonoscopy could
become advisable. Neurology® 2016;86:2203–2207
GLOSSARY
AML 5 acute myeloid leukemia; CI 5 confidence interval; MS 5 multiple sclerosis; SIR 5 standardized incidence ratio.
The cytotoxic anthracenedione mitoxantrone has shown efficacy as a disease-modifying therapy
in patients with worsening relapsing-remitting, progressive relapsing, and secondary progressive
multiple sclerosis (MS).1 It is the only approved disease-modifying agent for patients with
secondary progressive MS without superimposed relapses.2 Generic mitoxantrone is still being
used for highly active relapsing MS in countries facing economic limits for the newer immu-
nomodulatory drugs.3 Its application is limited mainly by the occurrence of systolic cardiac
dysfunction in about 12% and of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in approximately 0.8% of
treated patients.4 The mitoxantrone-associated incidence of AML has been investigated in
several cohorts,4–6 but the incidence of other types of malignancies was analyzed in only
a few studies, in which no increased risk was observed.7–9
We retrospectively evaluated the occurrence of all types of malignancies in a large cohort of
mitoxantrone-treated patients with MS seen at our department between 1994 and 2007 and

 calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs)
based on a comparison to the German general
population.
METHODS Study design. Using an electronic search of our
medical reports for “multiple sclerosis” AND “mitoxantrone”
followed by manual chart review, we identified all patients
with MS seen at our large German hospital-based MS center
between January 1994 and December 2007 who had received
mitoxantrone according to our medical records. Patient charts,
questionnaires sent to patients and treating physicians, letters
to registration offices, and phone calls to patients, relatives,
and physicians were used to locate patients and to define
patient demographics, immunosuppressive treatment history
(azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, methotrexate
or
treosulfan; not
interferon
b,
glatiramer
acetate, or
glucocorticosteroids) before or after mitoxantrone, diagnoses
of medically confirmed malignancies, life status, and cause of
death. As prospectively defined, follow-up was considered
complete in all patients for whom information on medically
confirmed malignancies, present life status, and cause of death
was available as of January 2011, allowing a minimum follow-
up of 3 years after therapy initiation. Figure 1 shows our
algorithm for patient ascertainment and characterization.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine at
the University of Würzburg approved the study. All patients who
could be personally contacted gave written informed consent.
Because of the nature of the study and based on German law,
the Ethics Committee waived the requirement for informed con-
sent and allowed collection and analysis of information from
registration offices, physicians, and relatives on all patients who
could not be contacted, e.g., because they were deceased. All
persons disclosing information including relatives and doctors
were informed about the purpose of this study and the Ethics
Committee approval, and gave consent. Collected information
was anonymized by code numbers and solely used for this study.
Statistical analyses. The SIR was used to describe the incidence
of malignancies in our cohort as compared to the German general
population (data from Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany).
The SIR was defined as the ratio of observed to expected cases,
taking into account age, sex, and year of occurrence in the
mitoxantrone-treated
patients
with
MS.
Multivariate
Cox
regression was used to analyze malignancy risk factors using R
software (version 2.15.2, package “survival”). A p value ,0.05
was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS We identified 677 mitoxantrone-treated
patients with MS, of whom 676 received a complete
follow-up as defined above. Among them, 17 had
started mitoxantrone treatment before 1994. The table
describes patient demographics, immunosuppressive
treatment history, and follow-up. In most patients,
mitoxantrone was administered at 12 mg/m2 every 3
months while a
minority (n 5
152) received
induction therapy with 3 monthly cycles of 12 mg/m2
followed by maintenance infusions every 3 months.
Mitoxantrone standard doses were adjusted according
to the leukocyte nadir 10 to 14 days after
infusion (target range: 2–3 3 109/L). Upon
clinical stabilization, mitoxantrone was reduced
to 5 mg/m2 per infusion as maintenance dose.
Malignancies. We identified 37 patients (5.5%) in
whom a malignancy was confirmed after mitoxan-
trone initiation according to medical reports. Enti-
ties included breast cancer (n 5 9, all female),
colorectal cancer (n 5 7), AML (n 5 4, 0.6%),
glioblastoma multiforme, lung, pancreatic, or pros-
tate cancer (each n 5 2), and 9 other types of
malignancies (each n 5 1).
Acute myeloid leukemia. Three patients with AML
were diagnosed with the French-American-British
M3 and one with the M4Eo subtype, all previously
unreported.
Median
time
from
mitoxantrone
initiation to AML diagnosis was 35 months (24,

 30, 40, 265) at a median age of 38 years (22, 28, 47,
60). The patient with a latency of more than 20 years
had also received azathioprine for 1 year, 2 years
before
starting
mitoxantrone,
while
the
other
patients had not received other immunosuppressive
drugs. Median cumulative mitoxantrone dose was
98 mg/m2 (108, 87, 112, 51). All 4 patients with
AML experienced full remission upon treatment
and were alive at the end of follow-up.
Colorectal cancer. The 7 patients with colorectal can-
cer had a median age at cancer diagnosis of 58 years
(range 53–73). Median cumulative mitoxantrone
dose was 61 mg/m2 (range 36–115). The median
interval between mitoxantrone initiation and cancer
diagnosis was 74 months (range 12–135). At diagno-
sis, the tumor stage was pT3 in 6 cases and pT4 in
one case; 6 had local lymph node and 4 distant metas-
tases. Three of these patients died at age 53, 61, and
67, all from their cancer. One of 7 patients had
received immunosuppressive drugs other than mitox-
antrone (azathioprine for 11 years, and methotrexate
or cyclophosphamide for shorter periods).
Mortality. In the whole cohort, 55 patients (8.1%)
had died, 12 of a malignancy and 43, as reported
by treating physicians, of other causes. Among these,
17 patients had died of a bacterial infection, 11 of
respiratory failure ascribed to MS, 4 of suicide, 3 of
acute heart failure, 2 of status epilepticus, 1 of ileus,
1 of cachexia, and the remaining 4 patients of other
reported reasons. No patient had a postmortem
examination.
SIRs and malignancy risk factors. The SIR for any type
of malignancy was mildly increased compared to the
German general population. The SIRs for AML and
for colorectal cancer were increased but not for any
other entity including breast cancer (figure 2A).
Finally, we performed multivariate Cox regression
analyses to identify potential malignancy risk factors.
Higher age at mitoxantrone initiation was identified
as a risk factor while neither cumulative mitoxantrone
dose (.75 vs #75 mg/m2) nor treatment with other
immunosuppressive drugs nor sex showed an influ-
ence (figure 2B).
DISCUSSION In our cohort of mitoxantrone-treated
patients with MS, we observed a previously
undescribed 3-fold increased incidence of colorectal
cancer and a 10-fold increased incidence of AML,
while the overall rate of all malignancies was only
mildly
increased
as
compared
to
the
general
population.
Unfortunately,
all
7
patients
with
colorectal cancer were diagnosed at an advanced
stage—with a type of cancer that usually takes long
to develop and can be treated more effectively when
diagnosed earlier.10 Our incidence of AML was
within the reported range.4–6 All 4 patients with
AML were successfully treated, while 3 of 7 patients
with colorectal cancer had died of their tumor,
making colorectal cancer appear to be a more life-
threatening adverse effect than AML in our cohort.
Our study is limited by its relatively small cohort
size. The risk of an underreporting bias appears low
as the diagnosis of a malignancy usually represents
a life-changing event for the patient that is made
known to all treating physicians and the family. Bias
was further reduced by collecting redundant infor-
mation from various sources. The high rate of a com-
plete follow-up in a prespecified cohort helped in
overcoming some inherent weaknesses of the retro-
spective design. We cannot exclude that additional
malignancies may have escaped proper diagnosis,
because a thorough checkup was not routinely done
and none of the deceased patients had an autopsy.
Moreover, additional mitoxantrone-related malig-
nancies might have developed if longer follow-up
periods had been available. Both factors could result
in underestimating the mitoxantrone-related risk of
malignancies. Because of inconsistent data on the
incidence of malignancies in patients with MS as
compared to the general population, it remains
unclear whether and how the chosen control group
influenced our results.11 No data on the incidence
of malignancies in a sizable control cohort of

 German patients with MS not having received mi-
toxantrone were available for our study. Treatment
of about one-third of our patients with other immu-
nosuppressive drugs might have led us to overesti-
mate the mitoxantrone-related risk. This may only
weakly apply to colorectal cancer, as only one of 7
patients had received other immunosuppressive
drugs.
Despite an increased risk of AML and colorectal
cancer, the overall incidence of all malignancies in
our cohort appears acceptably low to justify mitoxan-
trone treatment in severely affected patients with MS
if no better therapeutic alternative is available. Mitox-
antrone is currently the only approved treatment for
patients with secondary progressive MS without
superimposed relapses and should be considered in
patients with rapidly evolving disabling disease; more-
over, many of the new and highly effective immuno-
therapies are not available to the majority of patients
in a number of countries for economic reasons and
therefore mitoxantrone is still being used for patients
with very active relapsing forms of the disease.3 In
practical terms, posttreatment colonoscopy might
improve the risk–benefit ratio of this highly active
immunosuppressive drug.
