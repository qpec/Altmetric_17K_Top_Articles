Background and aims: The Burden of Communicable 
Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) study aimed to calculate 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 31 selected 
diseases in the European Union (EU) and European 
Economic Area (EEA). Methods: DALYs were esti-
mated using an incidence-based and pathogen-based 
approach. Incidence was estimated through assess-
ment of data availability and quality, and a correc-
tion was applied for under-estimation. Calculation of 
DALYs was performed with the BCoDE software toolkit 
without applying time discounting and age-weight-
ing. Results: We estimated that one in 14 inhabitants 
experienced an infectious disease episode for a total 
burden of 1.38 million DALYs (95% uncertainty interval 
(UI): 1.25–1.5) between 2009 and 2013; 76% of which 
was related to the acute phase of the infection and its 
short-term complications. Influenza had the highest 
burden (30% of the total burden), followed by tubercu-
losis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection/
AIDS and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Men 
had the highest burden measured in DALYs (60% of 
the total), adults 65 years of age and over had 24% and 
children less than 5 years of age had 11%. Age group-
specific burden showed that infants (less than 1 year 
of age) and elderly people (80 years of age and over) 
experienced the highest burden. Conclusions: These 
results provide baseline estimates for evaluating 
infectious disease prevention and control strategies. 
The study promotes an evidence-based approach to 
describing population health and assessing surveil-
lance data availability and quality, and provides infor-
mation for the planning and prioritisation of limited 
resources in infectious disease prevention and control.
Introduction
Countries of the European Union (EU) and European 
Economic Area (EEA) increasingly face the challenge 
of how best to allocate limited resources for infectious 
disease prevention and control. Evidence to determine 
priorities is often limited and epidemiological data may 
be unavailable, of uncertain quality or difficult to com-
municate to decision makers. Burden of disease esti-
mates, using composite health measures, provide clear 
and comprehensive information for transparent and 
accountable decision making and have the potential 
to play an important role in health policy formulation 
[1]. Numerous studies have addressed the challenge of 
estimating disease burden regionally, nationally and 
globally [2-8].
In high-income countries, the incidence of infectious 
diseases has decreased over the last century, but 
recent outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging diseases 
worldwide, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), 
measles, avian and pandemic influenza, chikungunya 
 2

virus, Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Zika virus dis-
ease, have resulted in a renewed focus on infectious 
diseases [9-14]. In addition, the traditional bounda-
ries between non-infectious diseases and infectious 
diseases have become blurred as increasing evidence 
of the aetiological role of the latter in triggering non-
infectious conditions is available [15,16].
In 2006, the European Centre for Disease Prevention 
and Control (ECDC) commissioned a pilot disease bur-
den study using seven selected infectious diseases in 
order to propose a methodology for a burden of disease 
study tailored towards infectious diseases and assess 
the feasibility of, and interest in, such an approach 
[17]. Based on this pilot, the Burden of Communicable 
Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) project was launched [18], 
funded by ECDC and implemented in collaboration 
with a European consortium led by the Dutch National 
Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) 
and consisting of academic and national health insti-
tutes from EU countries.
The main objective of the BCoDE project was to develop 
a methodology to assess the impact of infectious dis-
eases on population health in EU/EEA countries. It also 
intended to promote an evidence-based approach to 
assess population health, foster analysis of surveil-
lance data quality and availability, facilitate the com-
munication of complex health information to decision 
makers, and provide a tool for the planning and prioriti-
sation of infectious disease prevention, preparedness 
and control measures.
To achieve these objectives, a methodology was devel-
oped [19,20] that uses a composite health measure, 
the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) [21], to express 
the disease burden of an infectious disease in a sin-
gle metric and is therefore suitable for comparing their 
relative burden.
In line with the overall objectives of the BCoDE pro-
ject, the specific aim of the BCoDE 2009–2013 study 
described in this paper was to provide a baseline

average annual estimate of the EU/EEA burden of 
selected infectious diseases surveyed by ECDC and 
measured in DALYs.
Methods
Outcome measure and disease models
The methodological framework of the BCoDE 2009–
2013 study was based on the BCoDE project [19,20]. 
This methodology uses an incidence-based approach 
with a disease progression pathway to estimate DALYs, 
an outcome measure that describes the impact of years 
lived with disability (YLD) following the onset of a dis-
ease and of years of life lost due to premature mortal-
ity (YLL) compared with a standardised life expectancy 
[22]. The incidence-based approach acknowledges cur-
rent and future sequelae of infections, and sets the 
baseline for estimating the impact of prevention and 
control interventions. The disease progression model 
(i.e. outcome tree) links possible sequelae to an initial 
infection and allocates that future burden to the time 
of infection.
To calculate DALYs, the incidence of acute, sympto-
matic disease is a key input variable. Besides the 
number of symptomatic infections, computation of 
DALYs requires several additional age group and sex-
specific variables. These variables include the risk of 
developing short- and long-term complications (health 
outcomes), their duration, and weights reflecting their 
severity. These variables are described through dis-
ease models or outcome trees, which represent the 
progression of a disease over time by ordering relevant 
health outcomes following infection and illustrating 
their conditional dependency [19,20].
To determine the life expectancy at age of death, we 
used the same standard reference life table as the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010) [23]. 
Disability weights were selected from the set devel-
oped by the European disability weight project [24]. 
Outcome trees, their parameters and literature reviews 
for each disease included in this study are described in 
the BCoDE toolkit, version 1.2 [25] and are available in 
Supplement 1. No age-weighting and time-discounting 
was applied.
Selection of communicable diseases
Diseases for inclusion in the present BCoDE 2009–
2013 study were selected from those listed in Decision 
2119/98/EC with amendments, which fall under the 
mandate of ECDC as part of its responsibilities for 
epidemiological surveillance in support of the identi-
fication, assessment and communication of threats to 
health due to communicable diseases in the EU/EEA 
countries [26]. The selection criteria were data avail-
ability, incidence, outbreak potential and whether 
the disease is preventable with widely used vaccines 
(Supplement 2). Final disease selections were made by 
an ad hoc working group of the ECDC Advisory Forum,

ECDC Director [27].
Study population and European Union/
European Economic Area countries included
Results represent the burden of infectious diseases 
in all of the EU/EEA countries, except for Croatia, 
which joined the EU in 2012. However, due to the wide 
variability of data availability and/or quality across 
countries and in order to balance data quality and 
representativeness, for some diseases the estimation 
was based on a subset of countries. Details are avail-
able in Supplement 3. Reasons for excluding countries 
included data availability (e.g. countries not reporting 
surveillance data to ECDC) and data completeness (e.g. 
countries reporting only aggregate or sentinel-based 
surveillance data but with the denominator popula-
tion being unreported or unknown). Age group and 
sex-specific demographic data were obtained from the 
Eurostat database, 2011 [28].
Estimation of annual number of cases
Cases of diseases notified to ECDC through The 
European Surveillance System (TESSy), a database of 
communicable diseases cases in EU/EEA countries, 
were used as the main data source for estimating inci-
dence of acute infections. In order to remove the effect 
of large fluctuations in incidence data, for example 
that because of seasonality of disease or outbreaks, 
notified cases during five years, 2009 to 2013, were 
averaged to obtain an annual notified number of inci-
dent cases.
The annual number of cases was estimated in a step-
wise approach, generally by multiplying the age group 
and sex-specific number of cases notified to ECDC by 
a multiplication factor adjusting for underestimation 
[29]. For full details see Supplement 3 and Table 1. In 
order to determine the most suitable multiplication fac-
tors, we reviewed the available TESSy data.
The first step involved determining the availability of 
notification data: which countries reported and for 
which years. Countries not reporting or reporting lim-
ited information on sex and age of cases data were 
excluded from the study. The second step involved 
reviewing annual notification rates separately for 
each country, and the third step involved comparing 
the average rates across different countries. During 
these steps, together with ECDC surveillance experts, 
we considered surveillance systems’ characteristics, 
including case definition, case-based vs aggregate 
reporting, compulsory vs voluntary reporting, compre-
hensive vs sentinel surveillance and whether or not the 
surveillance system had national coverage. Notification 
rates were also reviewed in relation to epidemiological 
circumstances (e.g. outbreaks and disease exposure), 
reporting practices, healthcare providers’ awareness, 
and healthcare system characteristics.

For a number of diseases, i.e. campylobacteriosis, 
chlamydia infection, congenital toxoplasmosis, influ-
enza, pertussis and salmonellosis, it was concluded 
that it was not possible to estimate the incidence from 
notified data and alternative methods were applied 
(see Supplement 3). In particular, no published large 
community study was found for influenza except 
for the results of the Flu Watch cohort study in the 
United Kingdom [30], which we chose as the main data 
source to model the incidence of influenza in EU/EEA 
countries.
All the approaches above were explored in order to 
estimate the incidence of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection in the general population. However, only pub-
lished serological studies based on limited popula-
tions at risk were found, which would have introduced 
an unmeasurable bias and uncertainty and would not 
have allowed to estimate the incidence in the total pop-
ulation. Therefore, we excluded HCV infection from our 
disease burden estimation as no reliable data on the 
annual incidence of acute HCV was identified.
Computational analysis and uncertainty
For each disease, a model was generated using the 
BCoDE toolkit. Within each model, the age group-
specific and sex-specific annual number of cases, 
multiplication factors adjusting for underestima-
tion and population were inserted in the software. 
Uncertainty intervals (UI) were expressed as Uniform 
(2 values) or Project Evaluation and Review Techniques 
(PERT) (3 values) distributions; we ran the models at 
10,000 iterations of the Monte Carlo simulations, with-
out time discounting and age-weighting. For each dis-
ease, results included DALYs per case and the following 
per 100,000 population: incidence, deaths, YLL, YLD 
and DALYs. For all the outputs, we showed the median 
and the 95% UI.
Ethics statement
The BCoDE 2009–2013 study used a combination 
of aggregate health information (i.e. without per-
sonal identifiers) notified to ECDC through TESSy and 
information stemming from the scientific literature; 
therefore, informed consent was not required. Other 
information included in the study was drawn from pub-
lished literature.
Results
We estimated that between 2009 and 2013, the 
selected 31 infectious diseases accounted for 7,577 
cases per 100,000 population per year (95% UI: 
6,445–8,141) and there were 9.67 deaths per 100,000 
population annually (95% UI: 8.47–10.3) (Table 2).

Considering the EU/EEA population in 2011, these num-
bers would correspond to 37,784,603 cases (95% UI: 
32,139,602–40,597,130) and 48,222 deaths (95% UI: 
42,238–51,364).
The annual burden of the infectious diseases included 
in our study was 275 DALYs per 100,000 population 
(95% UI: 249–299). The disease with the highest bur-
den was influenza, with 81.8 DALYs per 100,000 popu-
lation (95% UI: 76.9–86.5), followed by tuberculosis 
(TB), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection/
AIDS and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) with 
53.5 (95% UI: 52.5–54.4), 48.2 (95% UI: 44.5–51.9) and 
30.1 (95% UI: 29.3–30.8 DALYs per 100,000 population 
respectively (Table 2, Figure 1). These four top-ranking 
infections accounted for 78% of the total burden of 
communicable diseases in EU/EEA countries. 
Legionnaires’ disease, campylobacteriosis and hepati-
tis B had a significantly lower burden compared to the

four diseases discussed above. Invasive Haemophilus 
influenzae disease, invasive meningococcal disease, 
chlamydia, salmonellosis, pertussis and Shiga toxin/
verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC/VTEC) 
infection had an even lower burden. The remaining 
diseases were ranked with a significantly lower bur-
den. YLL accounted for 71% of the total burden (Figure 
2).
Diseases with higher incidence and mortality as com-
pared with other diseases were found to be influenza, 
campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis (Figure 3), 
although only the former has a high burden in DALYs. 
Pertussis and chlamydia have high incidence and low 
mortality, whereas TB, HIV/AIDS, IPD, Legionnaires’ 
disease, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and inva-
sive Haemophilus influenzae disease (IHID) had low 
incidence and high mortality.

Burden of congenital infections in newborns
In terms of burden of congenital infections in the new-
borns, almost all the burden (97%) was attributable to 
toxoplasmosis, listeriosis and rubella infections (Table 
3).
Comparison of DALYs at the individual and 
population level
The diseases with the highest number of DALYs per 
case, which represents the individual burden and to a 
certain extent the severity of the disease, were rabies 
and variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which are ulti-
mately fatal conditions. HIV/AIDS, invasive menin-
gococcal disease, listeriosis, TB, IHID, Legionnaires’ 
disease, HBV infection, IPD, congenital toxoplasmo-
sis, tetanus and diphtheria followed, with DALYs per 
case ranging from 6.03 to 1.16. Diseases determined 
to have a high individual and population burden were 
Legionnaires’ disease, IPD, HIV/AIDS and TB, while 
influenza was determined to have a low individual but 
high population burden (Figure 4).
DALYs by sex and age
Most DALYs, around 60%, were due to infections 
occurring in males. Considering more detailed results 
presented in Supplement 4, diseases such as TB, HIV/
AIDS, Legionnaires’ disease, were found to impact 
mostly men while chlamydia and gonorrhoea had a 
higher burden in women.
When considering DALYs over the total population, 11% 
occurred in children less than 5 years of age, 15% in 
individuals less than 15 years of age and 24% in indi-
viduals aged 65 years and over (see Supplement 4); 
most DALYs were found in age groups between 25 and 
49 year of age (Figure 5). However, when considering 
the age group-specific DALYs per 100,000 population 
of the age group, those with the highest overall burden 
were infants under one year of age and individuals 80 
years of age and over (Figure 6). 
Compared with the age groups of between 15 and 64 
years of age (adults) and 65 years of age and over 
(elderly population), the total burden of disease in the 
population under 15 years of age is lower (Figure 7). The 
diseases with the highest burden in the under 15 years 
age group are HBV infection, influenza, IHID, IPD and 
invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). HIV/AIDS, TB 
and influenza are the diseases with the highest burden 
in the adult population, whereas influenza, IPD and TB 
have the highest impact in the elderly population.
Contribution of the acute phase of the disease 
and of years of life lost due to premature 
mortality to disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs)
The acute phase of diseases had the highest impact on 
the total burden (76%) (see Supplement 4). This was 
the result of the outcome trees that modelled case 
fatality proportions (CFP) as a direct risk to the acute 
infection. The high share of YLLs (72% of total DALYs, 
see Table 2) compared with YLDs was due to the limited 
amount of time lived with a disability, which is typical 
for infectious diseases.
Comparison of rankings
The final ranking of the burden of disease gives a new 
picture of the impact of infectious diseases when com-
pared with notification data (Figure 8).
Discussion
This study presents the estimation of the burden of 31 
selected infectious diseases in the EU/EEA in DALYs, 
adopting an incidence- and pathogen-based method-
ology and a consistent approach to surveillance and 
outcome data assessment. The results allow ranking 
of infectious diseases taking morbidity, disability and 
premature mortality resulting from acute infections 
and their sequelae into account.
The incidence-based approach chosen for this study 
allows for the effect of future long-term complications

of a disease to be included in the calculation of DALYs, 
resulting in a more comprehensive estimate of the 
effect of prevention and control interventions [31]. 
Compared to a prevalence-based approach, in the 
incidence-based DALYs, the potential future burden 
avoided, for example, by vaccination as a possible 
intervention measure, is included [19,20,32].
We did not apply time discounting, which is gener-
ally applied in economic studies, because we did not 
consider there to be reasons justifying the decline of 
healthy life years over time. Similarly, age-weighting 
was also not applied because it was considered that 
a healthy life year should be valued equally, irrespec-
tive of the age at which it is lived or lost. Both choices 
are consistent with current methodologies used by the 
World Health Organization’s (WHO) Foodborne Disease 
Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG) and the 
Global Burden of Disease studies [23,33].
Access to healthcare varies across countries but is 
largely universal. Although healthcare and surveillance 
systems vary, incidence data included in this study is 
mainly based on cases of disease notified to national 
surveillance systems and reported to TESSy during 
years when the reporting procedures were considered 
to be consolidated. Surveillance in the EU/EEA differs 
in terms of purpose and systems for collecting data. 
This study enabled a thorough review of surveillance 
data availability and quality for each disease and each 
country. As a result, this study increases our knowl-
edge and indicates areas for improving European infec-
tious disease surveillance.
The averaging of annual number of cases over 5 years 
removed the effects of large fluctuations in incidence, 
i.e. flattened the effects of outbreaks. However, it could 
still be valuable to show the effect of an outbreak given 
that such can cause rankings to substantially change 
from the baseline. For example, the burden of disease 
was 35.5 DALYs per 100,000 Bulgarian population per 
year considering the 2010 measles outbreak of just 
under 22,000 cases [34]. This burden would have led 
to this outbreak ranking fourth in our results, between 
HIV/AIDS and IPD.
Our study ranked influenza as the infectious disease 
with the highest impact on population health in the EU/
EEA. Although the CFP chosen for the influenza disease 
model was low, the incidence was significantly higher 
than that of any other disease included in our study 
(Table 2). The main driver of the high burden of influ-
enza is the contribution of premature mortality asso-
ciated with the infection (YLL). Our study estimated a 
mortality of 5.89 per 100,000 population, slightly lower 
than the ECDC-estimated annual average influenza 
deaths in EU/EAA countries of 7.60 per 100,000 popu-
lation (range: 1.07–15.5) within the same period based 
on the published figures of 38,500 deaths (range: 
5,400 to 78,200) [35]. Similar mortality rates were pub-
lished in national studies in the Netherlands: 3.69 to 
18.8 per 100,000 population [36], 2.62 per 100,000 
population [37] and 3.45 per 100,000 population [38]. 
Our estimated influenza mortality rates, based on the 
BCoDE outcome-tree method, are reasonably consist-
ent with other published rates.
However, it is important to note the limitations of our 
estimation of DALYs for influenza, namely the single 
incidence data source, the Flu Watch cohort study in 
the United Kingdom, representing a limited geographi-
cal region [30] which may have a different epidemio-
logical profile and vaccination coverage from other 
EU/EEA countries. However, the Southern Hemisphere 
Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and 
Surveillance project (SHIVERS) in New Zealand 
found a very similar incidence of symptomatic influ-
enza (personal communication, Sue Huang and Don 
Bandaranayake, July 2016). Moreover, the Netherlands 
national burden of disease study [5] estimated the inci-
dence of influenza from the general practitioner sen-
tinel system [37]. Using the 8,670 DALYs/year of the 
study and the Eurostat population in the Netherlands 
in 2009, we calculate an average annual burden of 52.6 
DALYs per 100,000 population in the period 2007 to 
2011, placing it in line with our findings.
Our results for influenza support the recommendations 
of the Council of the European Union [39], reiterated 
by the 2015 ECDC influenza vaccination report [40], 
to develop a national seasonal influenza vaccination 
action plan and to achieve target vaccination cover-
age for older population groups, people with chronic 
medical conditions, pregnant women and healthcare 
workers.
Our estimation of TB mortality rate was in line with 
national notified deaths of TB. For example, the 
Eurostat mortality for TB was 1.07 per 100,000 popula-
tion in the 28 EU countries in 2011 [41], very much in 
line with our estimated rate of 1.10 per 100,000 popu-
lation. Our findings reinforce the need for increasing 
efforts in EU/EEA countries to eliminate TB.
HIV/AIDS has a high burden of disease in Europe 
despite the low mortality risk compared with the pre-
antiretroviral treatment era. This is reflected in the 
overwhelming contribution of YLD to the total DALYs 
(ca 90%). As significant HIV transmission continues in 
Europe [42] and the high associated burden found in our 
study highlights the need to strengthen prevention and 
testing efforts. This study estimated that 0.15 deaths 
per 100,000 population were due to HIV/AIDS. Given 
our incidence-based approach, one must consider that 
this estimation is a projection of future mortality rates 
for people being infected in the time-period analysed, 
i.e. 2009 to 2013. The Eurostat (EU 28 countries) noti-
fied standardised death rate from HIV/AIDS went from 
1.2 per 100,000 population in 2002 to 0.74 per 100,000 
population in 2013 [41]. In our model, we projected a 
lower fatality assuming further decrease in the future 
due to improved treatment options, increased testing/
 16
www.eurosurveillance.org
early ascertainment of cases and increased treatment 
compliance.
Published data on observed number of deaths of IPD 
are comparable to those in our study: in our study CFP 
was 11% (see Supplement 4) while in a European study 
in 17 countries, death was reported in 9.0% to 10.6% 
of cases and changed according to age [43], in line with 
the models used for our study. Similarly, published IPD 
incidence and mortality estimates in the Netherlands 
based on sentinel surveillance and statistical esti-
mation methods [44] reported incidence of 13.8 per 
100,000 population and deaths of 1.6 per 100,000 
population, which are very similar to those presented 
in our paper. Based on our study, most of the burden 
of IPD is experienced by adults over 55 years of age, 
although children aged under 5 years also significantly 
contribute to the total DALYs (see Supplement 4). 
These findings are relevant to discussions about vac-
cination strategies since, according to ECDC’s report 
on invasive bacterial diseases in 2012, ‘the majority 
of infections were caused by serotypes covered by the 
13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV13’ [45].
Ranking of diseases can be also tailored to specific 
age groups as illustrated in Figure 7. It is interesting to 
note that all five top ranking diseases among the less 
than 15 years of age group are preventable through vac-
cination. Within the adult population, further research 
on the main risk groups affected by HIV/AIDS and 
TB, which by far are the two infections with the high-
est impact, would be advantageous in order to better 
inform intervention strategies. The elderly population 
is mostly affected by respiratory diseases (influenza, 
IPD, TB and Legionnaires’ disease) and gastro-intesti-
nal diseases (campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis). 
Age-specific vaccination campaigns could help prevent 
the burden of influenza and IPD in particular.
Results from this study must be placed in a broader 
perspective. Recently, the burden of a six selected 
healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) was estimated 
in DALYs based on the BCoDE methodology [46]. Their 
cumulative burden of 501 DALYs per 100,000 popula-
tion in that study was almost twice the one found in 
this one. These results imply that, among those sur-
veyed by ECDC, HAIs represent the infections with the 
highest burden on European population. However, the 
methodological differences relating to the syndromic 
approach chosen for the burden of HAIs vs the patho-
gen-based approach of this study may limit comparing 
the results of the two studies. In particular, a number of 
diseases included in the current study may have been 
healthcare-associated (e.g. Legionnaires’ disease, 
diseases attributable to Streptococcus pneumoniae), 
leading to some degree of double-counting [47,48]. 
However, this would likely be limited given that other 
diseases included in the present study may be uncom-
mon causes of HAIs (e.g. infections due to Neisseria 
meningitidis, TB, hepatitis A and B and invasive menin-
gococcal disease) [47,48].
The 2013 Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD 2013) 
estimated DALYs for a large number of diseases [7]. 
By downloading GBD 2013 country-specific estimates 
from the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) website 
and totalling the DALYs for 2013, we were able to esti-
mate the EU/EEA burden of several infectious diseases 
included in our project. HIV/AIDS and TB overwhelm-
ingly ranked higher than other infectious diseases in 
both studies. However, the GBD 2013 calculated preva-
lent DALYs, assuming a steady state and not taking into 
account the projected future burden, so comparisons 
must be made with caution.
The Ontario Burden of Infectious Disease Study 
(ONBOIDS) [4] used a comparable incidence-based 
DALY estimation approach as applied in our study. 
Similarly to our findings, the ONBOIDS found that infec-
tions caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, HIV and 
influenza virus had high burden. Differences in rank-
ing of diseases might be explained by differences in, 
for example, case definitions and disability weights. 
Epidemiological differences should also be consid-
ered, as for example, the incidence of TB is higher in 
EU/EEA countries than in Ontario.
Another burden of disease study based on incidence 
is the World Health Organization (WHO) Food-borne 
Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG) 
[8,49]. Considering the overlapping diseases, the dis-
eases with the highest burden based on the published 
results for WHO European Region EUR A of that study 
and the results of this study were campylobacteriosis, 
salmonellosis and listeriosis. The only difference, the 
burden of STEC/VTEC, might be due to the higher risk 
of developing haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the BCoDE toolkit 
disease progression model.
Strength and limitations
One strength of our study is that it is based on a rigor-
ous assessment of national surveillance systems, which 
provided important information on sensitivity; where 
possible, notified data for a disease was adjusted spe-
cifically for each country. For example, country multi-
plication factors based on a self-reported survey of the 
national sensitivity towards IPD surveillance [50] were 
applied to the notification data and DALYs were esti-
mated using the resulting cumulative number of cases. 
In other instances, such as for Legionnaires’ disease, 
countries were grouped according to ECDC disease pro-
gramme expert opinion into higher, intermediate and 
lower surveillance system sensitivity and different mul-
tiplication factors were then applied for each sensitivity 
group. The sensitivity of surveillance systems does not 
only depend on their intrinsic characteristics; systems 
are also prone to temporary changes, for example, dur-
ing outbreaks, when increased awareness might also 
increase willingness and capacity to detect and report 
cases. For the estimation of the incidence of measles, 
for example, notification of cases from countries and 
years experiencing an outbreak were adjusted with a 
 17
www.eurosurveillance.org
multiplication factor of 1.5 [51], as opposed to 2.5 for 
other countries and years [52,53].
Another strength of this study is that it captures the 
different risks of developing sequelae or death accord-
ing to age group. Examples include the age group-spe-
cific risk of developing HUS after STEC/VTEC infection, 
a crucial step towards the estimation of its burden, and 
the redistribution of the CFP of salmonellosis, campy-
lobacteriosis and influenza according to observed age-
specific mortality data in order not to overestimate the 
number of deaths in younger age groups [25].
Disability weights included in the disease models are 
derived from a study performed in Europe and thus 
have the potential to better reflect the preferences and 
values of the EU/EEA population [24]. Most infectious 
diseases cause temporary mild disabilities; it is impor-
tant to note that according to the methodology used to 
estimate disability weights, these may differ substan-
tially for similar health states [54].
A further strength is that the freely accessible and 
transparent methodology, parameters and variables 
of this study allow for reproducing the estimates and 
making comparisons with results from similar studies. 
For example, the burden of infectious diseases in the 
Netherlands is a national study that was based on the 
BCoDE project methodology with national adaptations 
[5].
A number of limitations need to be taken into account 
when interpreting the results of this study. First, the 
selection of diseases was limited to those included in 
Decision 2119/98/EC with amendments. This list does 
not include other infectious diseases with a potentially 
significant burden in EU/EEA countries, such as infec-
tions with human papillomavirus (HPV), Helicobacter 
pylori, rotavirus, norovirus and human respiratory syn-
cytial virus (HRSV).
Second, multiplication factors adjusting for underesti-
mation of notified data were selected from information 
found in the literature. Few country-specific multipli-
cation factors were available and ranges based on 
the limited number of published studies were applied 
consistently across EU/EEA countries. Moreover, mul-
tiplication factors were not adjusted for different age 
groups, although some diseases causing diarrhoea, 
such as salmonellosis for instance, had high notifi-
cation rates in children. This may be due to a testing 
bias, i.e. children may be tested more often, or to their 
reduced immunity or to higher exposure. Regardless 
of the reason, This means that there is a risk that the 
results may be underestimated or overestimated.
Third, the disease models (outcome trees) in the 
BCoDE toolkit are based on several assumptions [55]. 
Variables for each model parameter represent the 
available information in the literature and the age-spe-
cific risk of developing a certain sequelae or death was 
often not available. Outcome trees were developed 
considering the incidence of disease and the risks of 
developing sequelae as currently observed in EU/EEA 
countries. Therefore, treatment and preventive meas-
ures were implicitly considered and this should be 
taken into account when interpreting the results. For 
example, vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) with 
high coverage had a lower burden of disease, but they 
had the potential to substantially increase their burden 
and their resulting position in the final ranking during 
outbreaks. In addition, the disease models included in 
this study are static and do not consider future infec-
tion transmissions. Dynamic models, such as SIR com-
partmental models for infection transmission, should 
be developed when assessing the impact of prevention 
and control interventions.
Fourth, the probability of developing sequelae or death 
were estimated based on the limited information in the 
literature, except in some cases where information was 
derived from surveillance data (Supplement 1), and 
considered the competing risks of dying or developing 
complications to the extent possible. At older ages, for 
example, co-morbidities may worsen the severity of a 
given infectious disease, suggesting modification of 
disability weights or the need to consider the attribut-
able fraction due to the infections as opposed to the 
other underlying condition.
Fifth, the burden of HBV was based on the average 
annual number of acute infections but like other long-
term disease progression pathways, other subsequent 
stages of the disease have an impact on popula-
tion health. It would be beneficial to complement the 
incidence-based HBV results with prevalence studies 
given that our burden of HBV estimates do not consider 
prevalent long-term complicated cases.
The methodology and results in this study are based 
on a fully transparent and reproducible approach. 
We believe that the burden of disease methodology 
described in this study provides a clear and compre-
hensive view on the impact of infectious diseases on 
population health.
Conclusion
Calculation of DALYs through incidence-based dis-
ease progression models represents a comprehensive 
approach suitable for infectious diseases and provides 
useful information for prioritisation and planning in 
public health, among other purposes. For example, a 
recent Scientific Opinion by the European Food Safety 
Authority recommended using the BCoDE approach for 
ranking risks [56]. Another example is the Slovenian 
national estimation of the burden of tick-borne enceph-
alitis that identified age groups with the highest DALYs 
in order to inform vaccination strategies [57].
However, as quantitative results alone might not fully 
encompass all unknowns, uncertainties and variability 
[58] other dimensions of health should be considered.

Burden of disease measured in DALYs could be inte-
grated with risk-ranking methodologies such as multi-
criteria decision analysis (MCDA).
That being said, this study provides useful information 
for planning and prioritising surveillance strategies 
and intervention options aimed at preventing and con-
trolling infectious diseases as the estimates provide 
a useful picture of the impact of infectious diseases 
in EU/EEA countries. The findings will help to inform 
assessment of the impact of epidemics and of public 
health interventions.
