A growing body of research suggests that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota induced by environmental pollutants,
such as pesticides, could have a role in the development of metabolic disorders. We have examined the long-term
effects of 3 doses of the Roundup(R) herbicide (made of glyphosate and formulants) on the gut microbiota in
male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. A total of 141 bacteria families were identified by a 16S sequencing
analysis approach. An OPLS-DA analysis revealed an increased Bacteroidetes family S24-7 and a decreased
Lactobacillaceae in 8 out of the 9 females treated with 3 different doses of R (n = 3, for each dose). These effects
were confirmed by repetitive sequence-based PCR fingerprinting showing a clustering of treated females. A
culture-based method showed that R had a direct effect on rat gut microbiota. Cultivable species showed dif-
ferent sensitivities to R, including the presence of a high tolerant or resistant strain identified as Escherichia coli
by 16S rRNA sequencing. The high tolerance of this E. Coli strain was explained by the absence of the EPSPS gene
(coding glyphosate target enzyme) as shown by DNA amplification. Overall, these gut microbiome disturbances
showed a substantial overlap with those associated with liver dysfunction in other studies. In conclusion, we
revealed that an environmental concentration of R (0.1 ppb) and other two concentrations (400 ppm and
5,000 ppm) have a sex-dependent impact on rat gut microbiome composition and thus warrants further in-
vestigation.
1. Introduction
Human gut microbiome is inhabited by 1013 −1014 bacteria, more
or less the same order as the number of human cells [1]. A growing
body of research indicates that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is im-
plicated in a wide range of clinical conditions, some of which develop
local in intestine as could be anticipated such as inflammatory bowel
disease or colorectal cancer [2], with some others developing in distant
organs being more surprising such as diabetes, obesity, asthma, liver
and cardiovascular diseases, or even autism spectrum disorder [3]. A
number of studies have indicated that changes in dietary patterns and
lifestyle, as well as the presence of toxic food contaminants, can mod-
ulate the composition and the activity of the gut microbiome even if
their role in the development of this disease is still poorly understood
[4]. However, although human genetic variation in immune-related
genes is correlated with gut microbiome composition [5], the recent
rise of gut disease in Western industrialised countries cannot be fully
explained by genetic drift in human populations and environmental
factors plays a major role [6].
Human populations are exposed to an increasing number of dif-
ferent types of xenobiotics through their diets and lifestyles. Being di-
rectly in contact with the ingested food, the gut microbiome is sensitive
to the nutritional quality of the diet [7] and its content in biologically
active compounds acting as prebiotics to favour the development of
beneficial intestinal microbes [8]. Some other studies have shown that
the presence of food contaminants such as emulsifiers [9], heavy metals
[10], mycotoxins [11,12], polysaccharides [13] or even pesticide re-
sidues [14] can alter the composition of the gut microbiome.
Glyphosate (G)-based herbicides (GBH) are the most used herbicides
used
worldwide
[15].

T
 enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) inhibiting the
production of 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP), a precursor
of aromatic amino acids synthesis (shikimate pathway) [16]. EPSPS is
not specific to higher plants but is also found in many bacterial and
fungal species [17]. This has been used to propose the use of glyphosate
as an antibacterial or an anti-parasite agent for the prevention of in-
fections provoked by Streptococcus pneumonia [18] and Toxoplasma
gondii, Plasmodium falciparum (the parasite that causes malaria) and
Cryptosporidium parvum [19]. However, G was poorly active alone and
the addition of dicarboxylic acids was needed to achieve an anti-
parasitic activity. Similarly, G technical grade is not a potent herbicide
and commercial formulations of GBH always include toxic formulants
[20]. These formulants have been shown to be potent toxicants also in
mammals [21].
A number of studies have suggested that G and its commercial
formulations could act as antibiotics in the mammalian gut micro-
biome. G acted as a bactericide [22], a fungicide [23], and affected
antibiotic susceptibility [24] in some in-vitro studies. Some farm animal
studies have suggested that G is responsible for epidemics of C. botu-
linum-mediated diseases in poultry [25] and dairy cows [26]. There are
at least three possible mechanisms by which G could alter the gut mi-
crobiome, (i) by a direct toxic effect: the differential toxicity of G and
GBHs on chicken gut microbiota has been demonstrated in-vitro [25],
(ii) by differential G metabolization capacity: bacterial metabolism of G
in the gut leads to the production of toxic secondary metabolite AMPA
which has been found in rat feces [27], (iii) by mucus barrier mod-
ification: the impact of dietary emulsifiers on gut microbiota showed
that the mucus barrier could be sensitive to exogenous toxicants [9].
However, possible alterations of the mammalian gut microbiome by an
exposure to environmental concentrations of a GBH have never been
explored in a controlled laboratory animal study.
Historically, our knowledge about the microbiome in general and in
the gut in particular was limited to cultivatable flora representing less
than 1% of the total bacterial population. Meta-omics studies have a
wide range of applications ranging from phylogeny to metabolomic
studies [28]. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have allowed
new and complete information on microbiome diversity. In this work
we studied for the first time the long-term impact of Roundup (R) on
the mammalian gut microbiome using two complementary approaches:
(i) a new high-throughput 16S sequencing (IonTorrent®) phylogenic
analysis of the microbiome from rats having received ad libitum water
supplemented with different doses of R throughout 2-years (ii) tradi-
tional culture methods in order to study in-vitro short-term impacts of R
on isolated gut bacterial strains.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Ethics
The experimental protocol was conducted in accordance with the
regulations of ethics in an animal care unit authorized by the French
Ministries of Agriculture and Research (Agreement Number A35-288-
1). Animal experiments were performed according to ethical guidelines
of animal experimentations (CEE 86/609 regulation).
2.2. Animals and samples
Feces samples were collected from rats which were part of a long-
term study in which 3 doses of R (0.1 ppb, 400 ppm and 5000 ppm) had
been administrated in tap water ad libitum [29]. The commercial GBH
formulation used was R Grand Travaux Plus® (450 g/L glyphosate, ap-
proval 2020448; Monsanto, Belgium). The glyphosate concentration in
drinking water, as well as the glyphosate stability during the 7 day
period between two preparations of the test was confirmed by
HPLC–MS/MS (corresponding to 50 ng/L, 0.1 g/L and 2.25 g/L of G
respectively). The samples (n = 24) were collected after 673 days of R
administration. They were kept at −80 °C. Samples were selected from
independent cages as recommended [9] to avoid pre-clustering micro-
biota, and correspond to 3 females and 3 males per group, at the ex-
ception of two males treated with R 0.1 ppb which were housed to-
gether.
2.3. 16S sequencing analysis
The 24 fecal samples were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing
IonTorrent® in AdGène laboratory (Thury-Harcout, France) according to
the manufactureŕs instructions. Samples were homogenized and 200 mg
were treated with Nucleospin Tissue (Macherey Nagel, Hoerdt, France)
for DNA extraction. DNA quantity was measured by spectrophotometer
(Biophotometer, Eppendorf, Montesson, France). A total of 7 hyper
variable zones (V2, V4, V8, V3, V6, V7 and V9) of 16S rRNA gene were
amplified with the Ion 16™ Metagenomics Kit (Life Technologies, Saint-
Aubin, France). The amplification was made with two sets of primers
(V2-4-8 and V3-6,7-9). The results were controlled by capillary elec-
trophoresis
analyses
using
QIAxcel
Advanced
System
(Qiagen,
Courtaboeuf, France). Amplified DNAs were purified with the MinElute
Purification Kit (Qiagen). Preparation of libraries was performed with
the Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit (Life Technologies) and 4 samples
were treated in each sequencing run using Ion Xpress Barcodes
Adapters
1-16
and
Ion
Xpress
Barcode
Adapters
17-32
(Life
Technologies). All libraries correspond to DNA fragments from 200 bp
to 400 bp. Emulsion PCR was made with the Ion PGM™ Template OT2
400 Kit in OneTouch2, the enrichment of balls was realized in
OneTouchES. Quality control was carried out with the Ion Sphere™
Quality Control Kit in Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. Sequencing was under-
taken in the 316v2 microchip with Ion PGM Hi-Q Sequencing Kit on the
ION PGM sequencer. All the corresponding raw data has been posted on
the
ENA
database
with
the
accession
number
ERP104935
(PRJEB23198).
2.4. Repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR)
A total of 72 fecal samples (coming from 24 rats, 3 samples each)
were analyzed by (GTG)5-PCR. DNA was extracted as described above.
DNA samples were further diluted 10 times to prevent any risk of sa-
turation of the polymerase. The reaction mixes (25 μL) were prepared
using 5 μL of template DNA, 0.4 μM concentration of primers (5′-GTG
GTG GTG GTG GTG-3′) and 12.5 μL of DreamTaq PCR Master Mix
(Thermo Scientific). PCR amplifications were performed with an initial
denaturation step (95 °C, 3 min) followed by 40 cycles of denaturation
(95 °C, 30 s), annealing (51 °C, 30 s) and extension (72 °C, 1.5 min), and
a final extension step (72 °C, 10 min). Capillary electrophoresis analysis
was performed on the QIAxcel Advanced System (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf,
France) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. For each elec-
trophoresis process, a QIAxcel DNA High Resolution Cartridge, an
Alignment Marker 50 bp/5000 bp, a size marker 250 bp-4000 bp, and
the OM 500 method were used. The electrophoresis analyses were
performed using the QIAxcel Screengel Software v1.2.0 (Qiagen), and
the DNA fingerprint gel images were analyzed with the GelJ v1_3
software, according to Heras et al. [30]. Dendrograms were generated
using the following parameters: similarity method (Pearson’s correla-
tion), linkage (UPGMA) and tolerance of 2%.
2.5. Bioinformatic analysis
The analysis of 16S sequencing data was performed with the Torrent
Suite Software (v4.4) and ION Reporter (v4.4). The bioinformatics
workflow corresponded to Metagenomics 16S beta. The following
parameters were used: Curated MicroSEQ® 16S Reference Library
V2013.1 (Data Bank), size minimum of reads 150 bp, percentage of
alignments for identification 90%, minimal read abundance for vali-
dation 10, cut-off Gender 97% minimal alignment, cut-off species 99%

 minimal alignment, slash-call was defined as 0.8%. The data was ex-
pressed as percentages of phylum and families from taxonomical con-
sensus between the 7 hypervariable regions.
16S sequencing data were then analyzed by multivariate analysis
with the SIMCA-P (V13) software (Sartorius Stedim Data Analytics AB
Malmö, Sweden). Variables (phylum and families) were mean-centered
but not scaled (all the variables are expressed in the same unit) prior to
analysis. A first analysis was carried out by Principal Component
Analysis (PCA). A second analysis was carried out by using an
Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA)
[31]. The objective of a discriminant analysis is to find a model that
separates classes of observations on the basis of their X variables. The X
matrix consists of the 16S sequencing data. The Y matrix contains
dummy variables which describes the class of each observation. Binary
variables are used in order to encode a class identity. Discriminant
analysis finds a discriminant plan in which the projected observations
are well separated according to class. Orthogonal PLS is a recent
modification of the PLS method [32]. The objective of OPLS is to divide
the systematic variation in the X-block into two model parts, one that is
linearly related to Y (in the case of a discriminant analysis, the class
membership), and one unrelated (orthogonal) to Y. Components that
are related to Y are called predictive, and those that are unrelated to y
are called orthogonal. This partitioning of the X data results in im-
proved model transparency and performance.
The SIMCA software has a dedicated plot, called S-plot. The S-plot is
a useful and reliable tool to identify important discriminating variables.
This plot combines in a scatter plot the modelled covariance [Cov
(t1,X) = p1] and modelled correlation [Corr (t1,X) = p(corr)1] of each
X-variable with the predictive component from the OPLS-DA model.
The p1-axis will describe the magnitude of each variable, the p(corr)1-
axis will represent the reliability of each variable. X-variables which
combine high magnitude and high reliability are of relevance in the
search for discriminating variables. The extraction of the discriminating
variables from the S-plot could be combined with the jack-knifed con-
fidence intervals seen in the loading plot [33,34].
2.6. Microbial strains and culture conditions
Traditional culture-methods were applied to study gastrointestinal
microbiota of rats exposed to R. First, we performed a selection protocol
on fecal samples from control (n = 6) and R 5000 ppm (n = 6) treated
rats using media prepared as previously described [35,36]. It allowed
us to compare the results of traditional culture-methods to those of our
16S sequencing analysis. Briefly, dilutions of fecal samples (aiming to
obtain 30–300 CFU per Petri dish) were incubated in selective agar
medium (Table 1) in triplicate and counted (252 cultures). Then, with
the objective of reproducing bacterial community and its interactions,
we studied the effects of R on bacterial strains isolated from rat feces of
the control group in order to see if a short-term R exposure can re-
produce the effects observed after a chronic exposure in vivo. Control
bacterial strains were incubated in liquid media (RCM broth) with
different concentrations of R (0.1 ppb, 400 ppm and 5000 ppm) in tri-
plicate. After 24 h of treatment, samples were diluted to appropriate
factor to allow counting, cultured (24 h) in selective agar media and
afterward all colonies were counted. Ultimately, we studied the dose-
response relationship of R toxic effects by exposing the different strains
isolated from rat feces (control group) to R for 24 h. R and Glyphosate
have been adjusted with NaOH to pH = 7 to avoid acidity impacts and
filtered (0.22 μm) to eliminate possible contamination. After 24 h of
exposure, the absorbance (600 nm) was measured and the 50% of
growth inhibition (MIC50) intervals were estimated. Inhibition rate was
confirmed on agar plates with the same concentration of R. Statistical
differences were determined by a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test,
using InfoStat® version 2012 software (InfoStat Group, Cordoba, Ar-
gentina).
2.7. Characterization of a Roundup-tolerant or resistant bacterial strain
One strain isolated on RCM agar plate (Biokar Diagnostics, France)
had a particular phenotype when cultivated with 5000 ppm of R. A
colony was pelleted and seeded with and without 5000 ppm of R in
10 mL of liquid RCM. After 72 h at 37 °C, cells were centrifuged, washed
in physiological water, and concentrated to be analyzed by Fourier
Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). IR spectroscopy is a simple
and cheap tool able to give rapid global information about the phy-
siological status of microorganisms, as IR spectra reflect the global
chemical composition of the sample [37]. It can provide information on
existing taxonomic differences, or on chemical changes owing to
stressful environments [38]. Registered spectra were analyzed with
OPUS 6.5 (Bruker) software, on spectral windows 3100–2800 +
1500–1350 cm−1, 1800–1500 cm−1 and 1200–900 cm−1 for studying
fatty acids, proteins and polysaccharides, respectively [37]. Spectra
comparisons were performed by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)
using vector normalization of first derivative and Ward́s algorithm.
Taxonomical determination was performed by the API® 20E™ pheno-
typic assay (bioMérieux SA, France) and Sanger sequencing of 16S RNA
gene as follows.
DNA was extracted with the Kit EZ1 DNA Tissue (Qiagen). A total of
200 μL of bacterial strain was centrifugated for 5 min at 8000 rpm. The
supernatant was removed and 200 μL of G2 buffer was added. The
suspension was vortexed and placed into an EZ1 2 mL microtube before
extraction was done with the automatic extractor EZ1 Advanced system

cycles made of a denaturation step of 30 s at 95 °C, an annealing step of
30 s at 60 °C and an elongation step of 90 s at 72 °C. Amplification re-
sults were controlled by capillary electrophoresis analyses performed
on the QIAxcel Advanced System (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Am-
plified DNAs were purified with MinElute Purification Kit (Qiagen)
following manufacturer protocol. Purified amplicons were sent to
Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany) for Sanger sequencing.
3. Results
3.1. Roundup chronic effects: microbiome genomic diversity
Total DNA extracted from feces (4,033,668,501 bases) were se-
quenced passing 93,2% the Q20, a quality score representing the
probability of incorrect base call (1 error for every 100 bases). A total of
2,305,131 reads (sequences) were obtained and 776,220 were mapped
to known reference sequences. Details are showed in Table 2.
We started by an examination of the variance-covariance structure
at the phylum level. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the 6
phyla identified accounted for 96.1% of the variation (R2X) with two
components. The score plot (Fig. 1A) revealed a separation in two
groups on the first component, one group with both sex controls and all
treated males and the other, with treated females except for 5000 ppm-
F3 observation which is in the treated males and control group. R
treatment clearly separate phyla by sex, not controls. No dose effect was
observed at this step. The loading plot of variables (Fig. 1B) revealed
that Bacteroidetes variable had a high positive loading on the first
component characterizing the treated females while the Firmicutes
variable had a high negative loading on the first component char-
acterizing the controls (males and females) and treated males.
The same analysis was repeated at the family level. A total of 58
variables were excluded, out of 141 detected, because they contained
only zero, one or two different values from the median. First, a score
plot of the two first principal components in a PCA analysis and a score
contribution plot (Supplementary Material 1) revealed a strong outlier
observation (5000 ppm-M2). This observation had an abnormally high
value for the Lactobacillaceae variable in comparison with the average
(greater than 3 SD). As a result this observation was excluded and the
model refitted. The new PCA model is very similar to the previous and
explains 82% of the X-variation with two components (Fig. 2A). The
loading plot (Fig. 2B) revealed that the S24-7 variable, which belongs to
the Bacteroidetes phylum, has a high positive loading on the first com-
ponent, characterizing the treated females. Contrastingly, Lactobacilla-
ceae and Erysipelotrichaceae variables, belonging to Firmicutes phylum,
have negative loadings on the first component and characterize the
group of controls (males and females) and treated males.
Second, on the basis of PCA results, an OPLS-DA model on the 16S
sequencing dataset of families was built with two classes of observa-
tions: treated males and controls (n = 14) and treated females (3
groups of n = 3). The computed model is very significant (CV-ANOVA
test with p-value = 5 10−7). A permutation test (n = 200) was also
performed. The permutation plot displays the values of R2 and Q2 for
each model in function of the correlation coefficient between the ori-
ginal response vector and the permuted response vector. The y values at
the intersection with the regression lines indicate that R2 and Q2 values
were 0.00504 and −0.187, respectively, which confirmed the validity
of the model (Supplementary Material 2).
The model has one predictive component which explains 65.9% of
the variation in X (R2X) correlated to class separation. The model ex-
plains 79.4% of the variation of Y (R2Y) suggesting a good class se-
paration visible on the score plot (Supplementary Material 3) and a
cross-valided predictive ability Q2Y of 76.5%. In order to identify which
variables are the best discriminators between the two classes a S-plot
was produced (Supplementary Material 4). The S24-7 variable has both
high magnitude (p1 = 0.69) and high reliability (p(corr)1 = 0.98). In
the same way the Lactobacillaceae variable has a strong model con-
tribution (p1 = −0.46) and high reliability (p(corr)1 = −0.89). The
extraction of discriminating variables from the S-plot has been com-
bined with the loading plot of the variables with jack-knifed confidence
intervals (Supplementary Material 5). It confirms that S24-7 and
Lactobacillaceae variables have significant loadings (95% confidence
level) and are reliable to characterize the treated females from the
treated males and controls. This is confirmed by the analysis of

 individual phyla (Fig. 3A) and family (Fig. 3B) composition. One female
(5000 ppm-F3) treated with 5000 ppm of R presents a profile typical of
males and controls, which explains its position on PCA and OPLS-DA
analysis (Figs. 1–2 and Supplementary Material 3). Comparable results
were found by applying a different transformation data method sug-
gested by a new compositional approach [40] (Supplementary Material
6).
At this stage, our results highlight significant differences between
treated females and all others groups of rats (control males, control
females and treated males). These differences mostly consisted of an

Lactobacillaceae in 8 out of the 9 females treated with different doses of
R. In order to control possible distortion of DNA extraction and/or
amplification repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) profiles were
realized, using the same batch of extraction (Fig. 4A) and 2 additional
extractions (Fig. 4B and C). The three profiles are slightly discordant
but they all confirm the 16S sequencing results in 8 of the 9 treated
females, which clearly separate from controls (males and females) and
treated males.
3.2. Roundup chronic effects in vivo: microbiome cultivable biodiversity
High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA has progres-
sively replaced traditional culture methods in the last decade even if the
latter are still interesting. In order to compare the results of both
methods, we have measured total anaerobes, total aerobes, Clostridia,
Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli, Enterococci and Coliforms in feces of 3 males
and 3 females treated with 5000 ppm of R and their relative control
(Fig. 5). The results did not reflect the trends observed in the 16S se-
quencing analysis. We observed very strong method deviation, espe-
cially in Enterococci and Coliform populations making it very difficult to
observe possible treatment related effects. It is thus not clear whether

 our protocol based on Poulsen et al., 2007 was reliable to test for al-
terations in microbiome composition.
3.3. Roundup short-term effects in vitro
Parallel investigations on other organs from the same animals have
shown that the exposure to R has provoked liver and kidney damage
[29,41]. It is difficult to definitively attribute the gut microbiome al-
terations seen in our study to a direct effect of R because other studies
have shown that gut microbiome alterations can be secondary to liver
damage [42]. We have thus exposed isolated gastrointestinal strains
from feces of a control male rat to different concentrations of R over
24 h in order to ascertain if R can have a direct effect on bacterial
growth (Fig. 6A). We observed a significant growth inhibition at the
two highest concentrations (400 and 5000 ppm) of total anaerobes
population, Bifidobacteria, Clostridia, and Enterococci. Lactobacilli were
less sensitive; their growth was not altered at 400 ppm Coliforms were
not sensitive to any of the R concentrations tested. This is confirmed by
the study of the effects of increasing concentrations on isolated gas-
trointestinal strains (Fig. 6B). The estimated MIC50 were (in ppm)

 100–500 for Enterococci, Clostridia and Bifidobacteria; 1000–5000 for
Lactobacilli, and up to 10,000 for Coliforms. These results demonstrated
a differential sensitivity of the main cultivable families of the rat gut
microbiota including a global higher sensitivity of the anaerobe com-
munity. It suggests that gut microbiome disturbances provoked by R
exposure can be due to a direct selective bactericidal action, although
the MIC50 were very high in comparison to the R concentration ad-
ministered in vivo.
We observed an unusual colony morphotype (Fig. 7A) on agar RCM
with 5000 ppm of R after growth under aerobic conditions (72 h). Co-
lonies were bigger than those observed under lower R concentrations or
controls. This strain reversed to a normal morphotype when it was re-
seeded into another plate without R. This probably resulted from a
metabolic adaptation rather than to a random mutation because a new
seeding with R 5000 ppm led again to this unusual morphotype. We
observed a high tolerance or resistance to R and even G (results not
shown) after 24 and 72 h of liquid culture. An infrared spectral analysis
was undertaken in order to understand these physiological adaptations.
FT-IR spectra of the two morphotypes showed differences in lipids
(3100–2800 cm−1 + 1500-1300 cm−1),
proteins
(1800–1500 cm−1)
and carbohydrates (1200–900 cm−1) windows, the last being the most
important (Fig. 7B). A microscopic observation after Gram coloration
(Fig. 7A) showed altered bacterial cells suggesting cell wall modifica-
tions as confirmed by IR carbohydrate band modifications. Identifica-
tion was performed first by testing different culture media. The strain
grew on MacConkey Agar but did not grow on Slanetz and Bartley
medium or in the presence of polymyxine B (inhibition of Gram −).
These results suggest a coliform colony type. We then also undertook an
API 20E detection system combined with 16S RNA gene sequencing
analysis of these bacteria. This confirmed that the selected strain be-
longs to the Escherichia coli family (Supplementary Material 7). A DNA
amplification of the EPSPS gene (G target) was undertaken in order to
explain the particular morphotype of the E. coli selective strain. It was
unsuccessful showing a possible absence of this gene and the shikimate
pathway.
4. Discussion
We present the first investigation on the long-term effects of an
exposure to R on the gut microbiome composition of a laboratory ro-
dent. The microbiome of Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to different
concentrations of R for 673 days was compared to control rats of the
same age raised in similar conditions. The high-throughput 16S se-
quencing analysis revealed that R exposure via drinking water caused
sex-specific alterations of the rat gut microbiome (discussed below),
reflected by an increase in the Bacteroidetes family S24-7 and a decrease
in Lactobacillaceae in females. R had a direct selective bactericidal
action on isolated gastrointestinal strains which could explain the ef-
fects observed in vivo.
The material analyzed formed part of a chronic (2 year) study
looking at potential toxic effects arising from the consumption of R.
Animals exposed to R from an environmental level presented signs of
liver and kidney damage at an anatomorphological and blood/urine
biochemical level [29]. An integrated analysis of liver molecular pro-
files (transcriptome, proteome, metabolome) revealed non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease and its progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatosis
[41,43]. It is remarkable to see that gut microbiome alterations pre-
sented by mice developing fatty liver disease after an alcohol exposure
was also characterized by reduced Firmicutes spp., including Lactoba-
cillus spp., and increased Bacteroidetes spp., and thus considerably
overlap our results [44]. An increase of Bacteroidetes spp. and more
specifically, the S24-7 Gram negative family, is also observed in cases of
dysbiosis associated with obesity and inflammatory events in a mice
model [45]. In another study in rats exposed to the insecticide chlor-
pyrifos also presented a gut dysbiosis characterized by a proliferation of
Bacteroides spp. and decreased levels of Lactobacillus spp. in a simulation
of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem [46].
The alteration of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio by the exposure
to environmental pollutants, including by R as shown in this study, has
a profound effect on human gut function because Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes are the two dominant phyla in human gut microbiota [47].
Families such as Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, are considered as “positive”

 commensal bacteria as well as probiotics used as therapeutic agents
(immune system and gut transit strengthening, protection against
diarrhea). Clostridia and Enterococci also include commensal gut species,
even if some species can be pathogenic (i.e. Clostridium difficile and
Enterococcus faecalis). Although the clinical relevance of our observa-
tions remains to be ascertained, particularly as there is limited data
available, our data suggests that the exposure to an environmental
concentration of R residues could have a role in the current epidemic of
gut dysbiosis.
The gut microbiome disturbances evidenced in this report presented
a sex-specific pattern. Sex-dependent microbiome gut response has
been already reported in some animals including mammals [48]. The
sex-dependent response could show an endocrine-gut microbiome re-
lationship which is now well documented [49]. For example, Fuhrman
and colleagues [50] have found a relationship between estrogen me-
tabolism in post-menopausal women and fecal microbiota diversity.
Additionally, R has been suggested to have endocrine disrupting effects
in mammals although the existence of these effects at typical world

ferent extractions (A: batch used in 16S sequencing analyses; B, C: addi-

 levels of exposure remains debated [21]. It could thus be possible that
the increase of tumor incidence observed in treated females from this
study could have a relationship with the sex-dependence response of
gut microbiota because some studies suggest a possible link between
breast cancer and gut microbiota function [51,52]. This result can also
originate from more complex mechanisms involving multiple interac-
tions with distant organs because bacterial community effects or other
types of systemic mechanisms are not yet completely known.
Our results do not show a dose response relationship as expected by
most toxicological studies. This could have been expected at the highest
dose since the other components present in the formulation are very
disruptive. However, the gut microbiome has been shown to be resilient
[53]. In another study, the gut microbiome of mice exposed to cadmium
in early life later recovered [54]. In opposite sense, another possibility
could be that the liver pathology causes the gut dysbiosis, being the first
toxicological target the liver and not gut microbiome. This could also
explain the non-observed linear dose-response effect, as the liver-da-
mage has low-threshold toxicity as was previously observed [43]. Al-
though we observed that gut bacteria growth inhibition was present at
much higher concentrations, the cultivatable strains represent less than
1% of total diversity and so we cannot discard the hypothesis that non-
cultivatable bacterial communities of the microbiome are sensible to

 environmental concentrations of the R herbicide.
We demonstrate in this report G selectivity on isolated gastro-
intestinal strains, providing an explanation for gut microbiome altera-
tions induced by R. The possible selectivity of G bactericide function
had already been suggested in previous in-vitro studies [22,24]. Anti-
biotic efficacy of R reported in this study is in the range of those
measured with other common antibiotics. The MIC50 of R on Bifido-
bacteria was around 100–500 ppm in our study. By comparison, MIC50
for 13 antibiotics on Bifidobacterium longum varied from 0.12 ppm
(clindamycin) to 512 ppm (kanamycin) [55]. Lactobacillus were glob-
ally less sensitive and MIC50 ranged from 120 ppm (clindamycin) to
3000 ppm (ciprofloxacin) [52], and were 1000–5000 ppm in our study.
Several mechanisms of adaptation to metabolic inhibitors could explain
the different effect of R on different bacteria. For instance, Aerobacter
aerogenes is able to adapt to G exposure by increasing EPSPS activity
[56]. In Escherichia coli, the overexpression of a membrane transporter
encoded by the yhhS gene seems to be also implicated in a differential
toxicity to G [57]. Insensitivity to G can also result from single site
mutations (T97I/P101S double mutations) in E. coli [58]. Klebsiella sp.
strain PS19 shows a high resistance to many herbicides (including
GBHs) which could be due to resistance to common toxic formulants
[59]. Several species of Azobacter are able to grow in the presence of G
without affecting their metabolic activities [60]. The oxidative stress
induced by pesticides could result in selective pressure on bacteria
leading to an increase of pesticides tolerance and/or resistance.
We also studied short terms effects of R in vitro on microbiota by
cultivation of fecal bacteria. We did not find any global community
impact of R in vitro on the cultivatable microbiota isolated from feces of
rats exposed in vivo. One should notice that cultivatable strains re-
present a minor part of total gut microbiota diversity, as we mentioned
above, and as a consequence the probability of finding treatment re-
lated effects is low. It is also important to emphasize that the microbiota
has a spatial pattern in the gastrointestinal system [61]. Different po-
pulations are found along the digestive system and the community
isolated in vitro, as well as by the 16S sequencing analysis, could thus
not be representative of the actual communities inhabiting the upper
digestive system.
Concerning the coliform isolated strain with a particular unusual
morphotype, API 20E determination and 16S sequencing were con-
cordant and confirmed its identity as E. coli. DNA amplification of the
EPSPS gene which is the target of glyphosate was undertaken in order
to explain its particular morphotype, but it was unsuccessful showing a
possible absence of this gene. However, the strain was still cultivatable,
which suggest a bypass of the shikimate pathway. It could show the
natural tolerance of some gut microbiota to glyphosate due to the ab-
sence of this pathway. In fact, the shikimate pathway can be incomplete
in host-associated bacteria [62]. Furthermore, the existence of other
non-specific mechanisms of G tolerance, such as drug efflux transpor-
ters [57] could help the selection of multi-tolerant bacteria in gut mi-
crobiome [24]. In recent years, the increase in genetically modified
crops with tolerance to R and other herbicides is associated to an in-
crease in the risk of gene transfer to natural species and to a positive
selection of herbicide resistant weeds [58]. Environmental impacts of
herbicide resistance are still being studied. Soil and animal micro-
biomes should be considered as important targets. Ecological ap-
proaches are needed to study the complexity of environmental impacts
[59].
The number of animals per group (n = 3) remains a limitation of
this work, although similar results were observed on 3 treated groups.
Samples were taken towards the end of a chronic study [29] when some
animals had already died. Our findings are coherent with another re-
cently published study showing that a GBH (but not G alone) caused an
alteration in the microbiome of male Sprague-Dawley rats after a 2-
week exposure below the regulatory no-observed-adverse-effect level
[58] and other related pathologies are evidenced to be due to the
treatment, their specificity being now demonstrated [43]. Considering
the low statistical power provided by the sample size in this study, this
work should be considered as a pilot study. Sex-dependence and long-
term impact on gut microbiome of environmental relevant GBH re-
sidues should be investigated with larger numbers of animals.
An important consideration is that R is a mixture of G with various
formulants and ingredients. These compounds can be sometimes up to
10,000 times more toxic than G in human cells in vitro [61] and have
endocrine disrupting effects [62]. The toxicity of pesticides detected
after some epidemiological studies has been attributed to an exposure
to formulants. For instance, populations of farmers exposed to solvents
or petroleum distillates have a higher risk of their children developing
hypospadias [63] and more allergic and non-allergic wheeze conditions
[64]. A recent study has shown that dietary emulsifiers, which are
chemically similar to pesticide formulants, promoted colon cancer in a
mouse model through gut microbiome alterations [65]. The toxicity of
R could be either due to G or its formulants, or to a synergistic effect of
all components. As mixtures are held confidential, it is difficult to at-
tribute the toxicity to a given component, and several could be in-
volved. Future studies involving a parallel administration of either G or
R would shed light on this issue. This is in line with new methodological
approaches aiming to identify the potential hazards arising from cu-
mulative exposures to mixtures of chemicals [66,67]. Additionally,
longitudinal studies will be needed to provide insight into the temporal
dynamics of R toxic effects.
5. Conclusions
We have shown for the first time in vivo the long-term toxicity of R
on a mammalian gut microbiome. This toxicity appears to be sex de-
pendent since only treated females showed a dysbiosis. Microbiome
disturbances substantially overlapped with those associated with liver
dysfunction [43]. Molecular mechanisms of R tolerance or resistance
observed in the coliform isolated strain would need to be investigated
in further studies. Overall, the alteration of the Firmicutes to Bacter-
oidetes ratio by the exposure to environmental pollutants, including by
R as shown here, can have a role in the epidemic of intestinal disorders.

 The traditional vision implying that only compounds that are systemi-
cally absorbed have a toxicological relevance is outdated in regard of
the latest discoveries attributing major physiological roles of the gut
microbiome. The study of gut microbiome composition in long-term
toxicity studies performed prior to chemical market authorization
would be an important step to protect human populations from the
toxicity of gut microbiome disruptors.
