OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of guided home-
based tai chi chuan (TCC) and lower extremity training
(LET) and of levels of self-practice on falls and functional
outcomes in older fallers.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Taipei, Taiwan.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 60 and older who had
fall-related emergency department visits at least 6 months
before participating in the study and ambulated indepen-
dently at baseline (N = 456).
INTERVENTION: Six months of TCC or LET.
MEASUREMENTS: Four types of fall measures (falls,
time to first fall, fallers, recurrent fallers) and six func-
tional measures (handgrip strength, balance, mobility, fear
of falling, depression, cognitive function).
RESULTS: The TCC group was significantly less likely
than the LET group to experience any falls during the 6-
month intervention (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.30,
95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.15–0.60), and the effects
remained
significant
after
12 months
of
follow-up
(IRR = 0.32,
95%
CI = 0.14–0.71).
These
effects
remained significant for injurious falls during the 6-month
intervention (IRR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.16–0.68) and the
entire 18-month study (IRR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.18–0.83).
Similar results were obtained when another two fall mea-
sures (time to first fall, number of fallers) were used.
Moreover, participants who independently practiced TCC
or LET seven times per week or more were significantly
less likely to experience injurious falls during the 6-month
intervention (IRR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.20–0.83) and the
18-month study (IRR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.21–0.87) than
their counterparts, had a significantly longer time to first
injurious fall, and were significantly less likely to have an
injurious fall during the 6-month intervention. Cognitive
function improved to a greater extent in the TCC group
than in the LET group over the 18-month study.
CONCLUSION: Home-based TCC may reduce the inci-
dence of falls and injurious falls more than conventional
LET in older fallers, and the effects may last for at least
1 year. J Am Geriatr Soc 64:518–525, 2016.

E
ffective interventions have been developed for lowering
the incidence of falls in older people,1 but practical
application of these interventions is challenging because
developing cost-effective programs that require broad dis-
semination, adoption, and implementation is necessary to
reduce the burden of falls.2
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force states that the
net benefits of exercise or physical activity in preventing falls
are moderate and that those of multifactorial interventions
are small.3 Tai chi chuan (TCC) has demonstrated efficacy
in reducing falls and associated injuries4–6 and reducing
symptoms of certain chronic illnesses and improving overall
health and well-being.7,8 Nonetheless, whether TCC is a
more-effective preventive and therapeutic exercise than con-
ventional

in
reducing
falls
remains
unknown because only a few studies have directly compared
the effects of TCC with those of other forms of exercise on

 fall reduction, and their results are inconsistent.9–12 Further-
more, qualitative information rather than quantitative
aspects of the practice frequency of TCC or other exercise
interventions was assessed in the previous studies, and the
effect of self-practice on reducing falls has rarely been
reported. Therefore, it is essential to have a setting where
older people at high risk of falls can be identified and effi-
cient interventions can be delivered. The emergency depart-
ment (ED) may be an appropriate place for targeting people
in high-risk groups who should receive fall interventions
because falls are the most common cause of injuries treated
in the ED13 and are the most consistent predictor of subse-
quent falls in older people.14 However, older adults who
have presented to an ED after a fall have seldom been identi-
fied to receive a fall-prevention intervention.
To address the aforementioned concerns, a randomized
controlled trial was designed to compare the effects of
TCC with those of conventional lower extremity training
(LET) on reducing falls and injurious falls in older fallers
who presented to an ED. The potential effects of the fre-
quency of TCC or LET self-practice were also investigated.
METHODS
Study Participants
Study participants were recruited from two hospitals affili-
ated with Taipei Medical University. People aged 60 and
older who received fall-related medical attention between
January 2011 and December 2012 in the ED of either of
the two hospitals at least 6 months before the study (an
older person was presumed to have recovered from a fall
injury within 6 months15) and who could independently
ambulate were invited by telephone to enroll in the study
and participate in the baseline assessment. Exclusion crite-
ria were major unstable cardiopulmonary disease (ischemic
chest pain or shortness of breath on mild exertion), cogni-
tive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
score <24), and contraindications to physical exercise (e.g.,
severe arthritis that limits exercise capability). The of Tai-
pei
Medical
University
(Taipei,
Taiwan)
institutional
review board approved the study protocol, and written
consent was obtained from each participant.
Of the 735 eligible persons, 456 who participated in
the baseline assessment were randomized. After random-
ization and before starting any intervention program, 88
persons (43 and 45 in the TCC and LET groups, respec-
tively) received no intervention because they died; were
hospitalized; moved out of Taipei; or were discouraged by
family who were concerned about safety of the exercise
programs, allowing a stranger (trainer) to enter their
homes, or who would be responsible for their children’s
care during exercise sessions. The study duration was
18 months and comprised a 6-month intervention and 12-
month follow-up. The progression of participants through
the trial is illustrated in Figure 1.
Randomization
After completing the baseline assessment, potential partici-
pants were block-randomized in groups of eight to one of
the two intervention groups: TCC and LET. An indepen-
dent statistician performed randomization using software
without stratification of hospital or other variables, and
the allocation was concealed using an automated secure
website operated by an off-site independent service.
Interventions
Intervention programs were primarily delivered at the resi-
dence of each participant once a week over a 6-month
(24-week) period. The programs were also conducted in a
park or a community center close to the residence of par-
ticipants upon their request. All participants were asked to
practice TCC or LET every day.
Yang-style TCC with 18 movements was taught individ-
ually each week for 24 consecutive weeks. TCC instructors
from the Association of Taipei City Yang-style TCC who
were invited to participate and each had practiced TCC for
more than 10 years. Single movements were practiced each
week for the initial 6 weeks and mastered through multiple
repetitions, and multiple movements were practiced in the
subsequent weeks. Each TCC session lasted 60 minutes and
comprised a 10-minute warm-up followed by a review of
previous movements, an introduction of new movements,
and 5 minutes of relaxation. Deep diaphragmatic breathing,
weight shifting, displacement of the center of mass, ankle
sways, and leg stepping were integrated into each movement.
The LET intervention comprised stretching, muscle
strengthening, and balance training at increasing difficulty
levels. The training was individualized for each participant,
supervised by a physical therapist, and reviewed every week
for 24 weeks. Each session lasted 60 minutes and consisted
of a 10-minute warm-up, 45 minutes of exercise, and a 5-
minute cool-down. Stretching involved the neck, shoulders,
hips, knees, and ankles. A series of exercises was performed
to increase the stability of the trunk muscles and strengthen
the hip extensors and abductors, knee flexors and extensors,
and ankle dorsiflexors and plantar flexors. Balance training
included rising from a sitting position to a standing position,
standing on one leg, tandem walking, walking backward
and sideways, and turning 360°.
At the end of the 6-month intervention, each partici-
pant in the two intervention groups was reminded to prac-
tice the TCC or LET every day if possible to maximize the
benefits of the exercise intervention program.
Intervention Participation and Self-Practice
Participants were asked to complete at least 80% of the
intervention sessions (≥20 sessions), because learning TCC
movements or LET in fewer intervention sessions would
impede the progress of the intervention schedule and the
benefits of the intervention. They were also reminded to
practice TCC or LET every day during the 6-month inter-
vention and 12-month follow-up. The frequency of self-
practice during the previous week was calculated monthly
through telephone interviews.
Primary Outcomes
Over the 18-month study period, falls were prospectively
monitored and recorded daily using a diary, and these
records were mailed monthly to the study coordinator.

 When a participant failed to return the diary or provided
incomplete data, two research assistants blinded to the
group assignment provided telephone reminders, making a
maximum of five calls. Monthly follow-up of fall records
was continued in participants who were unavailable for
certain periods. Four fall measures (time to first fall, fall
count, number of fallers, number of recurrent fallers) were
obtained. A fall was defined as the unintentional loss of
balance, with the body hitting the floor or ground from a
standing height or lower.16 An injury was assessed using
the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and scored from 0 to
5,17 and a fall resulting in an AIS score of 1 or greater
was defined as an injurious fall.
Secondary Outcomes
Two assessors, blinded to the group assignment, evalu-
ated

outcomes

strength,
balance,
mobility, fear of falling, depression, and cognitive func-
tion)
at
baseline,
the
6-month
intervention,
and
12-
month follow-up. Grip strength of the right hand was
assessed using a handgrip dynamometer and measured in
kilograms of isometric force; the average of two mea-
surements was used. The Tinetti Balance Test involves
13 maneuvers, with a higher score indicating greater
balance ability. The Tinetti Gait Test comprises nine
components,
with
a
higher
score
indicating
greater
mobility.18 Fear of falling was assessed using the Falls
Efficacy Scale International test, which measures self-effi-
cacy in avoiding falls during seven essential nonhaz-
ardous
activities
of
daily
living,
with
a
higher
score indicating greater fear.19,20 Depression symptoms

 Adverse Events
No participant, TCC instructor, or physical therapist
reported any adverse events.
Statistical Analysis
A sample size of 364 participants provided 90% power to
detect a 50% difference in the incidence of falls between
the LET and TCC groups, according to a previous fall-
related study on community-dwelling Taiwanese elderly
people over an 18-month period.23 Considering loss to fol-
low-up (20%), 456 participants were recruited.
The distributions of the four fall measures in the TCC
and LET intervention groups over the 6-month interven-
tion and 18-month study were calculated, and the inter-
vention groups were compared to ascertain the presence of
any difference in attending the two follow-up assessments,
and the factors associated with incomplete follow-ups were
subsequently
controlled
for,
eliminating
a
potential
response bias in the study results.
A proportional hazards model was used to investigate
the relationship between intervention type and time to first
fall during the 6-month intervention and 18-month study
period. Data on participants who did not experience falls
by the end of the study or the time of death were cen-
sored, and hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated. To account
for overdispersion (standard errors being underestimated)
caused by correlations of recurrent falls within partici-
pants, correlations between TCC or LET instructors, and a
substantial proportion of participants having no falls, a
negative binomial regression model24 was used to investi-
gate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of falls between the two
intervention groups. A logistic regression model was used
to compare the effects of TCC and LET on the occurrences
of fallers and recurrent fallers; the odds ratio was con-
verted to a relative risk (RR) because falls are a common
outcome in older fallers.25 The effects of the intervention
session and the practice frequency of exercise and their
interactions with the intervention program on each of the
fall measures were analyzed. The two models were also
applied to an injurious falls analysis.
A
sensitivity
analysis
was
conducted
to
examine
whether distributions of baseline characteristics were com-
parable between subgroups divided according to the fre-
quency of exercise (≥7 vs <7 times per week) in the TCC
and LET groups, because practice frequency could depend
on participant characteristics (e.g., healthy participants
might practice an intervention exercise program more fre-
quently than other participants). Characteristics that were
incomparable between the groups were adjusted for in the
multivariable models.
Crude score changes for secondary outcomes (hand-
grip strength, Tinetti balance and gait, fear of falling,
depression, cognition) over the 6-month intervention and
18-month study period in the TCC and LET groups were
compared using paired t-tests. Because these secondary
outcomes were repeated continuous measures, a mixed-
effect model for each outcome was used to estimate how it
changed before and after the intervention and how the
change depended on the intervention type and other vari-
ables.26
All statistical analyses were based on the intention-to-
treat principle and were performed using SAS version. 9.3
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Of the 735 eligible persons, 456 agreed to participate in
the trial. The 279 nonparticipants were older (73.8 vs
72.4), more likely to be male (45% vs 33%), had less edu-
cation (18% vs 35% ≥college), and less frequently engaged
in regular exercise (66% vs 75%). At the two follow-up
assessments, the characteristics of the TCC and LET
groups remained similar. Results of the logistic regression
analysis for incomplete follow-up revealed that partici-
pants who were older, consumed alcohol regularly, and
used a walking aid were significantly less likely to have
completed the two follow-up assessments.
The
distributions
of
the
baseline
characteristics
(Table 1) between the TCC and LET groups were similar.
The distributions of intervention participation, self-prac-
tice, and the fall measures during the 6-month intervention
and 18-month study are summarized in Table 2. During
the 6-month intervention, 145 (78%) participants in the
TCC group and 132 (72%) in the LET group participated
in 20 or more sessions. During the 6-month intervention,
93 (50%) participants in the TCC group and 122 (67%)
in the LET group and during the 18-month study, 74 par-
ticipants (42%) in the TCC group and 81 (44%) in the
LET group independently practiced the exercise program
seven or more times per week; the difference between the
groups during the 6-month intervention was statistically
significant.
Significant differences were observed in median time
to first fall, rate of falls, and percentage of fallers for all
falls in the TCC and LET groups during the 6-month
intervention and the entire 18-month study period. Signifi-
cant differences were also observed in median time to first
injurious fall, rate of injurious falls, and percentage of
injured fallers between the two intervention groups during
the 6-month intervention and the 18-month study for inju-
rious falls alone. A significant difference was observed in
the percentage of recurrent injured fallers between the two
intervention groups during the 6-month intervention.
Results of the multivariable analysis for each of the
four fall measures over the 6-month intervention and 18-
month study period are summarized in Table 3. After
adjustment for age, regular alcohol consumption, and use
of walking aids (to account for follow-up differences), par-
ticipants who participated in 20 or more sessions did not
significantly differ from their counterparts in any of the
fall measures. The TCC group was significantly less likely
to experience a fall during the 6-month intervention
(IRR = 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.15–0.60)
and the entire 18-month study period (IRR = 0.32, 95%
CI = 0.14–0.71). Similar results were obtained when time
to first fall and number of fallers were used. The TCC
group was also significantly less likely to experience injuri-
ous falls during the 6-month intervention (IRR = 0.33,
95% CI = 0.16–0.68) and the 18-month study period
(IRR = 0.39,
95%
CI = 0.18–0.83).
The
difference
in
effects between TCC and LET on time to first fall and
number of fallers remained significant, despite their magni-

 tudes being smaller. Moreover, participants who indepen-
dently practiced the TCC or LET program seven or more
times per week were significantly less likely to experience
an
injurious
fall
during
the
6-month
intervention
(IRR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.20–0.83) and the 18-month

(IRR = 0.43,

than
those who did not. The effects of self-practice on time to
first injurious fall and number of injured fallers during the
6-month intervention were also statistically significant.
Results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that partici-
pants who practiced the TCC or LET program seven or
more times per week were significantly more likely to be
older, be male, and exercise regularly than their counter-
parts. After age, sex, and regular exercise were included in
the final model of the multivariable analysis, similar results
were obtained on the effects of self-practice on any injuri-
ous fall (IRR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.19–0.77), first injurious
fall (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.40–1.01), and being an
injured faller (RR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.78–1.00) during the
6-month intervention and on any injurious fall alone
(IRR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.20–0.88) during the 18-month
period.
Secondary outcomes in the TCC and LET groups at
the baseline and two follow-up assessments of the 6-month
intervention
and
18-month
study
are
summarized
in
Table 4. For the TCC group, handgrip strength, Tinetti
balance
and
gait,
depression,
and
cognition
scores
improved significantly during the 6-month intervention,
and improvements in handgrip strength, depression, and
cognition remained significant during the entire 18-month
study period. For the LET group, handgrip strength,
Tinetti balance and gait, fear of falling, depression, and
cognition scores improved significantly during the 6-month
intervention,
but
only
the
improvement
in
handgrip
strength remained significant during the 18-month period.
Only the change in cognition score at 18 months differed
significantly
between
the
two
intervention
groups.
A
mixed-effect analysis revealed similar results regarding
change in MMSE score during the 18-month period, and
TCC scores were 0.49 points (95% CI = 0.01–0.96) higher
than LET scores after adjustment for age, alcohol con-
sumption, use of walking aids, number of intervention ses-
sions, and self-practice level.
DISCUSSION
There are several possible reasons for the inconsistent find-
ings of previous studies that compared the effect of TCC
with that of other exercise types on fall reduction. First,
similar to other exercise types, the effectiveness of TCC
might depend on the characteristics of the practitioners.
TCC was more effective in healthy and prefrail commu-
nity-dwelling older people than in frail people or those
with serious health conditions.27,28 Nevertheless, the exer-
cise practice level may have confounded the results; specifi-
cally, healthy older people may be more likely to practice
an intervention program than frail elderly people. Second,
certain TCC intervention programs may not provide a suf-
ficient dose to produce a response, particularly in those
with low attendance, adherence, and intensity (<1 session
per
week)
or
an
insufficient
intervention
period
(<3 months).11,28,29 Under such circumstances, the role of
exercise self-practice must be considered. Third, the esti-
mate of the effectiveness of TCC in fall reduction may
vary according to the type of exercise that the control
group participated in (e.g., stretching, functional walking,
resistance exercise, balance training) because the risk of
falls in each exercise control group may differ. Similar to
the TCC exercise components, the LET program had mul-
tiple components of stretching, strengthening, and balanc-
ing.
Furthermore,
to
avoid
social
support
and
environmental effects, the TCC and LET intervention pro-
grams were home based and individualized. Finally, vari-
ous fall measures, such as time to first fall; fall counts; and
numbers of fallers, recurrent fallers, and injured fallers,

 have been used in studies, but some subtle differences exist
between these fall measures that affect evaluations of the
efficacy of TCC or other exercise types. For instance, the
number of falls rather than the number of recurrent falls
was reduced, implying that the natures of the first fall and
subsequent falls may have differed. Therefore, self-practice

TAI CHI, CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE, AND FALLS
523
 exercise levels, an exercise control group, and different
fall measures were used in this study to produce robust
results.
Because self-practice level could depend on participant
characteristics, and certain intrinsic factors directly related
to poor physical health could influence whether falls result
in injury,30 whether participants in better health and who
had a lower risk of injurious falls were more likely to
practice the exercise intervention program at a high fre-
quency was examined. Despite the results of additional
analyses
disproving
this
conjecture,
reverse
causality
between the self-practice level and injurious falls that pre-
vailed in unmeasured or unknown situational and disposi-
tional factors could have confounded the observational
results. A high frequency of exercise practice was signifi-
cantly associated with fewer injurious falls and injured
fallers but not of all falls and fallers. Regular practice of
an exercise program reduces the risk of falling,31 but fre-
quent physical activity could increase the opportunity for
falls.32 Perhaps the two forces pulling in different direc-
tions account for the null effect of exercise practice levels
on reducing the number of all falls and fallers, whereas
TCC may have improved upper extremity strength, reac-
tion times, and cognitive executive function, affecting the
probability of injury during a fall.33 Finally, practice fre-
quency of exercise intervention was seldom assessed in
previous intervention trials, but if frequency had not been
assessed, then the effectiveness of TCC in reducing injuri-
ous falls would have been underestimated because practice
levels were lower in the TCC group than in the LET
group.
Both interventions improved balance and motor con-
trol, muscular strength, depressive symptoms, and cogni-
tive function, although the TCC group did not exhibit
greater improvements in the aforementioned functional
outcomes than the LET group except in cognition. Previ-
ous studies have reported no differences in physical func-
tion between people practicing TCC and other active
exercise groups.9–12 One possible explanation is that most
of the selected functional measures do not capture specific
aspects of the functions that TCC improved, and TCC
may have benefited older people by improving cognitive
function, particularly in the executive functioning domain,
which mitigates the risk of falls. TCC practitioners may
have improved hand–eye coordination during tasks involv-
ing cognitive processing,34 and they have better neuromus-
cular control for postural recovery from a potential fall
than age-matched controls.35 Conversely, a healthy-volun-
teer effect or a ceiling or floor effect of functional mea-
sures for the secondary outcomes probably caused the
small difference in the cognitive outcome between the two
intervention groups and improvements in the secondary
outcomes in the TCC or LET groups. Nonetheless, because
the significant results might be attributable to the large
sample size, and their small difference is not likely to be
clinically meaningful, confirmatory evidence of the differ-
ence in cognitive improvement between TCC and LET is
required.
Several limitations of this study were observed. First,
the presence of a volunteer effect and loss to follow-up
may restrict the generalization of results to frail elderly
people. Older participants, men, those with low educa-
tional levels, those who smoked, and those who seldom
performed regular exercise refrained from participating in
the trial, and those who were older, consumed alcohol reg-
ularly, and used a walking aid were less likely to complete
the study. Second, differences between exercise instructors
could have resulted in a performance bias. Because the
number of participants with a particular instructor differed
markedly, differences in characteristics between the TCC
and LET instructors were not considered in the analysis,
although correlations between exercise instructors were
adjusted for. Third, fall measures and the frequency of
exercise practice were self-reported and not validated using
other sources. Nevertheless, data on all falls and injurious
falls were consistent, and the monthly exercise practice
level consistently declined after the 6-month intervention,
indicating that the results are reliable. Fourth, more-severe
injurious falls, such as fractures and brain injuries, were
not analyzed because of their rare occurrence (11 TCC, 12
LET); therefore, inferences regarding severe injurious falls
should be made with caution. Finally, the costs of the
TCC and LET interventions were not estimated or com-
pared, although payments lower than the market rates to
were made to the tai chi instructors and physical thera-
pists. The National Health Insurance Administration does
not cover payments for home-based physical therapy in
Taiwan.

 CONCLUSIONS
Home-based TCC may reduce falls and injurious falls in
older people who present to the ED more than conven-
tional LET, and the reduction can be maintained for at
least
1 year.
Further
research
is
required
to
confirm
whether actively practicing an exercise intervention pro-
gram can reduce injurious falls to a greater extent and lead
to differences in cognitive functioning between individuals
who practice TCC and LET.
