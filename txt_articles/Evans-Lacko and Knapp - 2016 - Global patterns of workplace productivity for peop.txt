Abstract
Purpose Depression is a leading cause of disability
worldwide. Research suggests that by far, the greatest
contributor to the overall economic impact of depression is
loss in productivity; however, there is very little research
on the costs of depression outside of Western high-income
countries. Thus, this study examines the impact of
depression on workplace productivity across eight diverse
countries.
Methods We estimated the extent and costs of depression-
related absenteeism and presenteeism in the workplace
across eight countries: Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, South
Korea, Mexico, South Africa, and the USA. We also
examined the individual, workplace, and societal factors
associated with lower productivity.
Results To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to examine the impact of depression on workplace pro-
ductivity across a diverse set of countries, in terms of both
culture and GDP. Mean annual per person costs for
absenteeism were lowest in South Korea at $181 and
highest in Japan ($2674). Mean presenteeism costs per
person were highest in the USA ($5524) and Brazil
($5788). Costs associated with presenteeism tended to be
5–10 times higher than those associated with absenteeism.
Conclusions These findings suggest that the impact of
depression in the workplace is considerable across all
countries, both in absolute monetary terms and in relation
to proportion of country GDP. Overall, depression is an
issue deserving much greater attention, regardless of a
country’s economic development, national income or
culture.

Introduction
According to the most recent Global Burden of Disease
statistics, depression ranks as a leading cause of disability
worldwide [1], affecting 350 million people [2]. Among all
medical conditions, depression may have the greatest
negative impact on time management and productivity
[3, 4]. In high-income countries, trends suggest that sick
days lost to mental health problems such as depression
have increased in recent years [5]. In addition to the sig-
nificant personal consequences associated with depression,
the economic impact of these trends can be considerable,
including for employers.
In the workplace, depression can influence productivity
through increased absenteeism. In addition, depression can
influence the performance of workers who are ‘present’ at
work, i.e., presenteeism. Previous research suggests that
presenteeism accounts for the majority of the costs [6–8].
However, most research has been done in Western, high-
income countries, and little is known about how the rela-
tionship between depression and workplace productivity

 varies across countries. Labor market circumstances and
culture may influence the relationship between depression
and workplace productivity [9]. We (1) estimate workplace
productivity (absenteeism and presenteeism) associated
with depression across eight diverse countries; (2) make
population-level country estimates of annual absenteeism
and presenteeism costs associated with depression; and (3)
examine individual, workplace and societal factors asso-
ciated with lower productivity.
Methods
Data source
We performed secondary analysis on data collected in the
Global IDEA (Impact of Depression in the Workplace in
Europe Audit) survey which collected data on presenteeism
and absenteeism associated with depression and their cor-
relates. Participants were recruited through an online
market research panel. Before joining the panel, partici-
pants were screened to: remove duplicates, validate name
and surname, validate country based on internet protocol
address, validate town and zip/postal code according to
official
lists,
check
for
valid
correlations
between
sociodemographic data (gender, and age of parents and
children), and validate contact information. Individuals,
who worked in advertising and/or market research, and
those aged under 16 years old were excluded.
Employed people across Brazil, Canada, China, Japan,
South Korea, Mexico, South Africa, and the USA were
sampled from the online research panels. Selected panel
members were invited to participate in the survey through
Ipsos
MORI
(http://www.ipsos-mori.com/)
via
email.
Quotas were set to include equal distributions of age and
gender, and the sample was designed to be geographically
representative of each country. In addition, as managers
were considered of key interest, ten percent of the sample
for each country was represented by managers. Response
rates varied by country. Reported estimates ranged from
around 5 % in China, 8 % in the USA, 10 % in Brazil,
Mexico, Canada, and South Africa, 15 % in Japan, and
37 % in South Korea. Questionnaires were collected from
approximately 1000 respondents per country.
Measures
Sociodemographic information included age band (18–24,
25–44, and 45–64 years), gender, education level com-
pleted (tertiles were created for each country to indicate
locally relevant high, medium, and low education cate-
gories). Data were collected on annual or monthly house-
hold income from individuals in all countries except for
China,
where
individual-level
income
details
were
collected.
Previous diagnosis of depression was determined via
self-report by asking respondents: Have you ever person-
ally been diagnosed as having depression by a doctor/
medical professional?
Did not tell employer because of fear of losing job
Employees who reported a previous diagnosis of depres-
sion which they did not disclose to their employer were
asked whether they did not tell their employer, because
they felt it would put their job at risk or in this economic
climate they felt that it was too risky.
Country variables
We used data from the IDEA survey to describe the overall
population prevalence of employees with a diagnosis of
depression. We derived annual prevalence rates from life-
time prevalence rates based on nationally representative
psychiatric epidemiological surveys. Given the standard-
ized cross-country methodology, we used World Mental
Health Survey data where available. The ratio of lifetime to
annual prevalence of depression ranged from 1.7 in China
to 3.0 in Japan. We applied individual country ratios based
on data from their own country surveys and also performed
sensitivity analyses based on the lowest (1.7) and highest
(3.0) ratios from participating study countries. Country
unemployment rates for 2013 were taken from the Inter-
national Labor Organization global employment trends
report (World Health Organization 2014). Figures for gross
domestic product (GDP) per capita (US $) for each par-
ticipating country were taken from the World Bank (World
Bank [11]).
Work performance
Self-reported presenteeism was assessed using the WHO
Health
and
Work
Performance
Questionnaire
(HPQ)
[12, 13]. For this assessment, respondents rate their overall
work performance during the past 4 weeks and this is
transformed to a 0–100 scale where 0 corresponds to doing
no work at all (while at work) and 100 signifies top work
performance. Presenteeism as assessed by the HPQ has
been found to be valid when, for example, compared to
independent employer records of job performance and
supervisor ratings [14]. Absenteeism was assessed using
the following question: ‘The last time you experienced
depression, how many working days did you have to take
off work because of your depression’? Data collected from
individuals on their reported salary was used to convert the
measures of absenteeism and presenteeism into US dollar

 purchasing parities based on a conversion factor from the
World Bank [15] to estimate the cost associated with
depression in the workplace using a human capital
approach.
Statistical analysis
Individual and country characteristics are presented for
each country. A high proportion of participants had zero
costs associated with presenteeism/absenteeism, and thus,
the data followed skewed distributions. We, therefore, used
a modified Park test [16] to select the most appropriate
distribution. Parameter estimates suggested a Gaussian
distribution had the best fit for presenteeism costs, while a
Poisson distribution had the best fit for absenteeism costs.
Consequently, two generalized linear models were used to
examine bivariate and multivariable factors associated
with: (a) depression-related absenteeism costs and (b) de-
pression-related presenteeism costs. Country contextual
variables (i.e., prevalence of employees with a previous
diagnosis of depression and per capita GDP) were com-
puted as an average rating for each country across
respondents, and each variable was standardized (i.e.,
z-score was computed). Post-stratification survey weights,
based on gender, age and region of residence, which were
aligned with nationally representative figures, were used in
all analyses. We used generalized estimating equations
(GEE) with robust variance estimates to model within-
country correlations [17]. We selected GEE instead of
mixed regression models as we were interested in under-
standing the influence of overall cultural factors rather than
individual country-level effects. As GEE is a non-likeli-
hood-based method, Pan’s QIC was used for variable
selection and to select the working correlation matrix [18].
Given the diversity in country economic circumstances, we
also investigated whether the relationship between fear of
losing one’s job and productivity (absenteeism and pre-
senteeism) differed by country GDP, testing the interaction
between these variables. All analyses were carried out
using SAS version 9.3 and Stata version 11.
Ethics statement
This study was classified as exempt by the King’s College
London, Psychiatry, Nursing, and Midwifery Research
Ethics Subcommittee as this was secondary data and was
fully anonymized. Data collection was performed inde-
pendently by Ipsos MORI in accordance with the standards
of ESOMAR, AIMRI, and EFAMRO in Europe, and is in
line with the data protection act 1998. Data were collected
as part of a market research survey and are hosted with the
market research agency Ipsos MORI. All data for the
market research survey are anonymous and did not include
any personal information. No minors or children were
involved in the study, and written consent was obtained.
Results
Participant characteristics and country averages
Individual sociodemographic characteristics and weighted
country averages for mental health and employment char-
acteristics are described in Table 1. As expected, given the
diversity of countries included in the sample, there was
some variation between countries in relation to education
and income.
Less than 10 % of respondents in China (6.4 %) and
South Korea (7.4 %) reported having a previous diagnosis
of depression by a doctor or medical professional, while
more than 20 % reported a previous diagnosis in Canada
(20.7 %), USA (22.7 %) and South Africa (25.6 %). There
was substantial inter-country variation in number of days
off, with sample proportions reporting 21? days off work
due to their depression varying from 2.3 % in Mexico to
21.8 % in Japan. Respondents in Japan and the US were
the most likely to report not telling their employer about
their depression because of fear of losing their job or due to
the economic climate (12.0 and 11.4 %, respectively), in
contrast to fewer than 5 % in Brazil and Mexico.
Productivity costs of depression associated
with absenteeism and presenteeism across countries
Mean annual per person costs for absenteeism associated
with depression were lowest in South Korea at $181.
Although Japan had a relatively low prevalence of
employees who reported a diagnosis of depression, the
average cost of absenteeism associated with depression was
highest in Japan ($2674) as a high number of employees
took time off of work for at least 10 days. Japan also had
the highest aggregate costs of absenteeism associated with
depression (almost $6 billion), when considering the size of
the labor force in the country and the estimated annual
prevalence of depression among employed persons. To
account for differences in, for example, salary levels across
countries, we also expressed the aggregate costs as a pro-
portion of country GDP. The proportion was highest in
Brazil and South Africa (0.7 %) and lowest in South Korea
(0.01 %) (see Table 2).
Mean presenteeism cost per person associated with
depression was lowest in China at $547; however, it is
likely an underestimate relative to the other countries as it
is based on individual income rather than household
income as is done for the other countries. The USA ($5524)
and Brazil ($5788) had the highest presenteeism costs per

 person associated with depression. Costs of presenteeism
associated with depression tended to be 5–10 times higher
than those for absenteeism. When taking into account the
size of the labor force and the estimated annual prevalence
of depression among employed persons, the US was the
highest at more than $84 billion and Brazil second at over
$63 billion. In terms of proportion of GDP; however,
presenteeism costs associated with depression accounted
for the greatest proportion in South Africa (4.2 %) and the
lowest in Korea (0.1 %). Interestingly, the ratio of pre-
senteeism costs to absenteeism costs varied across coun-
tries—being more equal in Japan (1.4) and Canada (2.7),
whereas presenteeism accounted for much greater propor-
tions of costs in the US (14.2) and South Africa (6.8) (see
Table 3).
Factors associated with absenteeism
When adjusting for all covariates, individuals of middle age
(relative to younger age), those with higher levels of edu-
cation and those with higher incomes tended to have lower
levels of depression-related absenteeism. There was a mar-
ginal trend for the interaction term for GDP per capita by
non-disclosure due to fear of losing one’s job (p = 0.08),
suggesting that individuals living in countries with higher
GDP per capita who did not tell their employer because they
feared losing their job were more likely to have higher levels
of absenteeism. We repeated the analyses excluding China
(due to the difference in income measurement), and the
results did not change significantly (see Table 4).
Factors associated with presenteeism
After adjusting for covariates, individuals with higher
levels of education and individuals who did not tell their
employer, because they feared losing their job tended to
have lower depression-related presenteeism. Individuals
with higher incomes had higher depression-related pre-
senteeism. Individuals living in a country with higher
prevalence of depression also tended to have higher pre-
senteeism. There was a significant interaction for GDP per
capita by non-disclosure due to fear of losing one’s job
(p \ 0.08) suggesting that individuals living in countries
with a higher GDP per capita who did not tell their
employer because they feared losing their job had higher
levels of presenteeism (p = 0.0002). As with absenteeism,
we repeated the analyses excluding China, and the results
did not change significantly (see Table 5).

 Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
examine the impact of depression on workplace produc-
tivity across a diverse set of countries, in terms of both
culture and GDP. Previous research on the economic case
for tackling depression in the workplace is mainly relevant
for Western countries and high-income countries. These
findings suggest the impact of depression in the workplace
is considerable across all countries, both in absolute
monetary terms and in relation to proportion of country
GDP. In other words, depression is an issue deserving
attention, regardless of a country’s economic development,
national income or culture [19–21]. Moreover, with the
growth in non-communicable diseases globally—with
mental illnesses contributing substantially—the scale of the
problem is likely to increase (Bloom et al. [22]).
Although the impact of depression on workplace pro-
ductivity is universal, there were significant inter-country
differences in terms of the prevalence of employees with
depression taking time off work, number of days taken off,
level of presenteeism and ratio of presenteeism to absen-
teeism. Most previous studies have been conducted in
western or high-income countries, and thus, this study

 provided an opportunity to explore global similarities and
differences. Our study provides higher estimates of work
productivity costs compared with previous US studies
[8, 23, 24]; however, these studies were based on samples
collected more than a decade ago, and there were some
methodological differences. We found lower overall pro-
ductivity costs (in relation to proportion of GDP) associ-
ated with depression in Asian countries compared to the
US. One driver of lower costs was the lower prevalence of
employees diagnosed with depression in Asian countries.
In line with previous epidemiological research [25, 26],
Asian countries had the lowest prevalence of diagnosis of
depression and this may be due to a true difference and/or
measurement bias. In the case of the present study, dif-
ferences could also be due to lower diagnostic rates or a
cultural
reluctance
to
disclose
depression.
Previous
research from Japan found a significant relationship
between depression (as identified by a psychiatric epi-
demiological survey using the WHO Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview [27]) and lower presenteeism,
but did not identify a significant relationship between
presence of depression and absenteeism [9]. It may be that
our sample identified a relationship between depression
and absenteeism in Japan as our criteria for depression
identified individuals with more severe depression, given
they had to receive a diagnosis by a medical professional
(Brown et al. [28]; Bebbington et al. [29]) and that there is
a high threshold of depression severity which warrants
absenteeism in Japan.
We found that presenteeism rates varied according to
country characteristics. Individuals living in a country with
a higher prevalence of depression diagnoses had higher
levels of presenteeism. It may be that prevalence of
depression diagnoses also reflects comfort in seeking
treatment and or disclosing one’s diagnosis. Previous
research has shown that a cultural context which is more
open and accepting of mental illness is associated with
higher rates of help-seeking, antidepressant use and
empowerment, and lower rates of self-stigma and suicide
among people with mental illness (Evans-Lacko et al. [30];
Schomerus et al. [31]; Lewer et al. [32]). We also know
that openness and support by managers in the workplace
are associated with more social acceptance for employees
with depression [33]. Thus, it seems that sociocultural and
workplace attitudes which promote acceptance and open-
ness
about
depression
could
also
be
important
for
improving workplace productivity of employees with
depression; further research is needed to understand whe-
ther this may be at least partially mediated by increased
treatment and help-seeking.
Differences in absenteeism and presenteeism were
related to economic climate and per capita GDP. Greater
reluctance to disclose one’s depression to an employer due
to a fear of losing one’s job was related to lower levels of
presenteeism. For both absenteeism and presenteeism, this
seemed to depend on per capita GDP, in that individuals
living in countries with higher per capita GDP who did not
disclose their depression to their employer, because they
feared losing their job, had higher levels of presenteeism
and absenteeism; however, this only reached the level of a
trend for absenteeism. Thus, in higher income countries,
individuals with depression who experience added stress
due to the economic climate may cope through taking time
off of work, as this might be more acceptable when the
economy is stable, as there is likely to be a stronger social
safety net. On the other hand, in lower income countries,
individuals who fear disclosing their depression because
they may lose their job do not feel comfortable taking time
off of work. Consequently, they may remain at work, but
have lower levels of productivity, and this is reflected in
their relatively lower levels of presenteeism. Some varia-
tion may also be due to the fact that the probability of
people with depression being employed varies by country
and we do not know about differences in the experiences or
rates of unemployed people with depression across coun-
tries. There is a paucity of data on unemployment rates of
depressed persons, though we know that people with
mental illness are at a considerable employment disad-
vantage; for example, in OECD countries, there is a dif-
ference in unemployment rate of around 30 percentage
points for those with a severe mental disorder and 10–15
percentage points for those with a moderate disorder, when
compared to those with no disorder [34]. We also know
that adverse labor market conditions and stigmatizing
attitudes have a disproportionately negative impact on
employment of individuals with mental illness [35]. This
difference may be even greater in lower and middle income
countries [36].
We also found that absenteeism and presenteeism were
associated with individuals’ characteristics. Higher income
and education were associated with lower levels of absen-
teeism. This is supported by previous research, including a
large European survey of employed individuals [33] and a
meta-analysis of work strain which showed that individuals
with higher status occupations had lower levels of absen-
teeism, and this may be due to their greater financial and
interpersonal resources to deal with adverse circumstances
[37]. Interestingly, our analyses showed that higher levels of
income were associated with higher levels of presenteeism,
which would be in line with the importance of financial
1532

123
 support. Higher levels of education, however, were associ-
ated with lower levels of presenteeism. It is possible that
individuals with higher levels of education have a more
cognitively demanding job and, therefore, may feel more
severely impacted by the cognitive impairments associated
with depression (Schultz [38]). Some research has shown
that among employees with depression, presenteeism was
lower among individuals with jobs involving strong judge-
ment and communication skills [39].
Strengths and limitations
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine
workplace productivity associated with depression across a
diverse range of countries using a common methodology.
Our findings come from a unique data set including
employees and managers from eight countries, with infor-
mation on their personal experiences and perceptions of
depression in the workplace. Nevertheless, there are several
limitations. Diagnosis of depression was based on self-re-
port, and we were not able to control for clinical character-
istics, such as severity and/or type of symptoms, and
response rates were relatively low. However, the character-
istics of respondents are in line with other epidemiological
research, as study respondents reporting a diagnosis of
depression were more likely to be female, divorced and
working part-time. In addition, prevalence of depression
diagnosis was lowest in Asian countries. In addition, as the
survey only asked about lifetime experience of depression,
we had to derive annual prevalence rates from secondary
sources. We used estimates from nationally representative
psychiatric epidemiology surveys available for each country.
We used the human capital approach to estimate pro-
ductivity costs, which is still the most commonly used
approach across health economics; however, it assumes a
societal perspective, and therefore, the associated costs are
higher than when using other methods such as friction costs
calculations [40, 41]. National mental health policies,
employment assistance programs available in the work-
place and other policies could be important factors which
help explain relationships between depression and pro-
ductivity in the workplace, and it is a limitation that we
have not included this information in our analyses; how-
ever, this was beyond the scope of this paper. Additional
limitations are that data from this study did not include
information on variables such as functioning and work
roles, or number and duration of depressive episodes, all of
which might be related to workplace productivity.
Conclusion
Previous research has noted the significant impact of
depression on workplace productivity. Our study highlights
the individual and country contextual characteristics which
influence absenteeism and presenteeism among employees
with depression. The trends toward escalating rates of
chronic diseases alongside growing economic pressures are
an increasing challenge for governments and employers
worldwide [42, 43]. There is some evidence of growing
interest in improving workplace mental health and an
increase in workplace health promotion programs; yet, still
only a minority of companies participates in these pro-
grams and rates are much lower in low and middle income
countries compared to high-income countries [44]. There
are a few interventions which have been shown to be cost-
effective for addressing depression in the workplace [45],
but almost all the available evidence comes from Western,
high-income
countries.
Interventions
which
support
employees with depression need to be developed, adapted,
implemented, and evaluated across all countries to mitigate
the high personal and societal impacts and economic costs
of depression in the workplace.
