Study objective: We compare utilization, price per visit, and the types of care delivered across freestanding emergency
departments (EDs), hospital-based EDs, and urgent care centers in Texas.
Methods: We analyzed insurance claims processed by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas from 2012 to 2015 for patient
visits to freestanding EDs, hospital-based EDs, or urgent care centers in 16 Texas metropolitan statistical areas
containing 84.1% of the state’s population. We calculated the aggregate number of visits, average price per visit,
proportion of price attributable to facility and physician services, and proportion of price billed to Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Texas versus out of pocket, by facility type. Prices for the top 20 diagnoses and procedures by facility type are compared.
Results: Texans use hospital-based EDs and urgent care centers much more than freestanding EDs, but freestanding ED
utilization increased 236% between 2012 and 2015. The average price per visit was lower for freestanding EDs versus
hospital-based EDs in 2012 ($1,431 versus $1,842), but prices in 2015 were comparable ($2,199 versus $2,259). Prices for
urgent care centers were only $164 and $168 in 2012 and 2015. Out-of-pocket liability for consumers for all these facilities
increased slightly from 2012 to 2015. There was 75% overlap in the 20 most common diagnoses at freestanding EDs versus
urgentcarecentersand60%overlapforhospital-basedEDsandurgentcarecenters.However,pricesforpatientswiththesame
diagnosis were on average almost 10 times higher at freestanding and hospital-based EDs relative to urgent care centers.
Conclusion: Utilization of freestanding EDs is rapidly expanding in Texas. Higher prices at freestanding and hospital-
based EDs relative to urgent care centers, despite substantial overlap in services delivered, imply potential inefficient
use of emergency facilities. [Ann Emerg Med. 2017;70:846-857.]

INTRODUCTION
Background
A freestanding emergency department (ED) is a facility
that is structurally separate and distinct from a hospital that
provides emergency care. Some are satellite facilities of
acute care hospitals and others are independently operated.
No organization tracks the growth of freestanding EDs
throughout the country, although various parties have
counted the number of facilities at one point. One research
article estimated a total of 80 freestanding EDs (satellite
and independent) in the country in 2007.1 A recent study
counted 360 as of 2015, with Texas having the most (181)
of any state.2
Importance
Proponents of freestanding EDs claim that they relieve
crowding and deliver more timely care than hospital-based
EDs and decrease health care spending by delivering care in
a lower-cost setting. Freestanding EDs may also provide
emergency care to patients in markets that have
experienced hospital closures, or offer convenience to
patients who live far from hospital-based EDs. However,
critics of freestanding EDs argue that the facilities increase
spending because they serve as supplements to traditional
EDs rather than substitutes, delivering care that could be
provided in alternative lower-cost settings.3 In particular,
several local media outlets have reported cases of patients
mistaking freestanding EDs for lower-cost urgent care
centers, because both facilities are commonly located in

HEALTH POLICY/ORIGINAL RESEARCH
 Editor’s Capsule Summary
What is already known on this topic
There has been significant growth in freestanding
emergency departments (EDs), particularly in Texas.
What question this study addressed
Using Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas claims data,
the authors compared the types and costs of
emergency and urgent care services delivered by
freestanding EDs, hospital-based EDs, and urgent
care centers between 2012 and 2015.
What this study adds to our knowledge
There is considerable overlap in the types of clinical
conditions treated in the 3 settings. For the same
diagnostic category, average costs were 10 times
higher at freestanding and hospital-based EDs
compared with urgent care centers. However, because
the latter have different costs, staffing, hours of
operation, diagnostic capabilities, and Emergency
Medical Treatment and Labor Act expectations than
EDs, direct comparison and conclusions about
efficiency are not valid.
How this is relevant to clinical practice
In Texas, for comparable conditions, freestanding EDs
are not delivering less costly emergency or urgent care
compared with hospital-based EDs. Better data for
comparison of operational costs is needed.
suburban strip malls.4-6 Despite the opposing claims on the
costs and benefits of freestanding EDs, to our knowledge
there are no studies that provide evidence from a
sufficiently sized sample to conclude whether freestanding
EDs increase or decrease costs or whether the services
provided justify the amounts billed to consumers and
insurers.
Goals of This Investigation
In this study, we analyze emergency care and urgent care
claims from one of the largest insurers in Texas to examine
changes in utilization of these facilities over time, as well
as prices and type of services delivered. Multiple media
reports mentioning freestanding EDs in Texas suggest that
this state is one of the first to experience significant growth
in these facilities.7-9 This state’s experience may provide
guidance to other states as policymakers consider whether
to regulate entry of these new providers. The Texan
population of 27 million, which is larger than that of the 19
smallest US states combined, provides a large sample size to
draw inferences on how utilization and prices evolve in
this market.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Setting
We conducted a secondary analysis of all insurance claims
(including facility and professional) processed for care at
hospital-based EDs and freestanding EDs, as well as urgent
care centers, through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas
(BCBSTX) for January 2012 through December 2015.
States that license freestanding EDs differ in their
requirements for these facilities, but the American College of
Emergency Physicians has issued a policy statement that
freestanding EDs should be available to the public 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week, and they should be staffed by qualified
emergency physicians.10 Urgent care centers are walk-in
health care centers that treat episodic conditions that need
immediate but not emergency care. They are not open 24
hours a day, have different equipment and staffing, and do
not have Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act
obligations.11 Although they do not provide exactly the same
services, we compare EDs to urgent care centers because no
better comparable billing or cost data are available, and past
research has found that 27.1 percent of all ED visits could be
managed at a retail clinic or urgent care center.12
We accessed all 2012 to 2015 claims processed as of July
2016. The Texas Prompt Pay Statutes and Rules require
that all claims submitted by providers be processed within
45 days,13 so the documented care in these data is
comprehensive for this 4-year period. Almost all of these
payments were submitted to BCBSTX electronically.
Physicians and other practitioners must submit a
diagnosis and related procedure code with each claim to
receive reimbursement. Each facility type must submit a
procedure code, diagnosis related group, or revenue code.
The strengths of private insurer claims databases in
documenting treatment costs and dates of service in large
populations have been previously noted.14 We excluded
any claims in which BCBSTX was not the primary insurer.
The nonprofit health insurer had 5.5 million individuals
enrolled in health maintenance organization or preferred
provider organization plans in 2012, which increased to 5.8
million beneficiaries in 2015. The majority of individuals
covered had employer-provided health insurance, but the
sample includes those who purchased insurance directly
from BCBSTX, including customers covered by federal
Health Insurance Marketplace plans from January 2014
onward. The insurer was estimated to account for 48% of
the commercial insurance market in 2013.15

Ho et al
Comparison of Usage and Costs of Freestanding Versus Hospital Emergency Departments
 To avoid biasing comparisons across facility types, we
excluded claims from metropolitan statistical areas in which
there was no freestanding ED open during the sample
period. This exclusion limited the analysis to claims for
patients living in the metropolitan statistical areas: Amarillo,
Austin, Beaumont, Bryan, Corpus Christi, Dallas/Ft Worth,
El Paso, Houston, Lubbock, Midland, San Antonio,
Texarkana, The Valley, Tyler, Victoria, and Waco. These
areas represent 84.1% of the Texas population.
A protocol for analysis of the freestanding ED data was
submitted to Rice University’s institutional review board
and found to be exempt from the need for further review
according to Title 45, Part 46, Section 101 (b)4 of the
Code of Federal Regulations. Statistical analyses were
performed with SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, NC).
Methods of Measurement
The BCBSTX claims files contain a provider-type code
with roughly 330 categories that encompass professions (eg,
licensed practical nurses, occupational therapists) and
facility types (eg, diagnostic imaging facilities, nursing
homes). Claims with the code for “free standing ER (24/7)”
were classified as freestanding ED claims. There were 7
different codes (eg, urgent care facility, urgent care clinic)
that were then used to identify urgent care center claims.
Because the provider-type codes for hospitals were even
more diverse than for urgent care centers (eg, specialty
hospitals, psychiatric hospitals), it was more straightforward
to identify claims associated with hospital-based ED visits
by using a 2-step process, in which we first used a different
variable to identify claims from an “institution” (as opposed
to a professional, pharmacy, etc, claim). We then selected
claims with an institutional revenue code for an ED visit
(codes 450 to 459) or a current procedure terminology
(CPT) code for ED visit for evaluation and management of
a patient (codes 99281 to 99285) that did not have a
provider-type code for a freestanding ED. Any provider
that is seeking reimbursement from BCBSTX must submit
valid licensing and certification proof, plus undergo an
onsite inspection. Although we likely do not have data on
all freestanding EDs, hospital-based EDs, and urgent care
centers in Texas, the Blue Cross Blue Shield verification
process supports the accuracy of facility types.
For each visit, the claims contain the “total allowed
amount,” which is the amount the provider should be paid
by the insurer and patient together. We refer to this
amount as the “price” of each visit. The claims also specify
the “paid amount,” which is the portion of the total
allowed amount paid by the insurer. We assumed the
remainder of the total allowed amount was paid out of
pocket by the patient. We lack information on hospital-
based ED visits that resulted in hospitalization because it
was impossible to determine which portion of these bills
was attributable to the ED visit and which was attributable
to the admission.
Primary Data Analysis
For each year, we calculated the aggregate number of
visits to each facility type for beneficiaries with claims
processed by BCBSTX. All claims from the same facility
within a 24-hour period are assumed to represent one visit.
However, if there are claims associated with more than one
facility on the same day (eg, claims from a freestanding ED
and a hospital-based ED), they represent 2 separate visits in
the sample. We also calculated the mean and median price
per visit to each facility type by year, proportion of the price
attributable to facility versus professional services, and the
mean and median amounts for which the patient was liable
out of pocket. Professional services encompass health care
provided by physicians, nurses, and any other personnel at
the facility.
Almost all visits to an ED require medical screening of
each patient, which results in both the facility’s and the
physician’s billing separately for evaluation and
management services. The billing code ranges from 99281
to 99285, with the facility code determined by the intensity
and volume of resources utilized, and physician billing
based on the complexity and cognitive effort expended
to treat the patient. Higher codes result in higher
reimbursement to the provider.16 We report the
distribution of evaluation and management visits by billing
code and year for freestanding and hospital-based EDs.
We determined the most common diagnoses according to
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for each facility
type during the 4-year sample period. The ICD-9-CM codes
were collapsed into 285 clinically meaningful categories,
using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
Clinical Classifications Software methodology.17 We list the
20 most common diagnostic categories and report the mean
and median price for each diagnosis and the percentage of all
visits each diagnosis represents by facility type. We then
compute the ratio of the treatment price for each diagnosis at
a freestanding ED compared with an urgent care center and
the price ratio for hospital-based EDs versus urgent care
centers. An average of these ratios over all diagnostic
categories that either freestanding EDs or hospital-based
EDs have in common with urgent care centers summarizes
the difference in costs of care by provider type.
Procedures were defined in the claims data with the
Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System. We

848 Annals of Emergency Medicine
Volume 70, no. 6 : December 2017
 collapsed these system codes into approximately 500
clinically related categories, using a method developed by
Truven Health Analytics.18 We then used these categories
to determine the 20 most common procedures performed
during each visit. At freestanding and hospital-based EDs,
both the facility and the physician submit claims to
BCBSTX for treatments provided. At urgent care centers,
there is no facility claim. For some visits, more than one
procedure was performed. In these cases, we included each
billed procedure in our counts. We list the 20 most
common procedures and report the mean and median price
for each procedure by facility type and the share of all visits
where this procedure was found.
RESULTS
Characteristics of Study Subjects
The freestanding ED claims processed by BCBSTX
came from 52 facilities in 2012. The number of facilities
submitting claims increased to 86 in 2013, 134 in 2014,
and 207 in 2015. The smaller number for 2012 is
consistent with a previous count of 191 hospital-affiliated
freestanding EDs open nationally at the end of 2008, with
an additional 31 independent freestanding EDs serving
patients, mostly in Texas.19 The count of 206 freestanding
EDs through December 2015 is higher than the report of
181 freestanding EDs in Texas by Schuur et al,2 but their
count was current only through March 31, 2015. The
insurer BCBSTX gained enrollees between 2012 and 2015,
but at an uneven rate. There were small declines in
enrollment in 2013 and 2015, along with a much larger
enrollment increase in 2014.
Main Results
Figure 1 graphs the number of visits to freestanding
EDs, hospital-based EDs, and urgent care centers by year
in the 16 Texas metropolitan statistical areas in which at
least one freestanding ED was open between 2012 and
2015. Trends in total visits by year and facility type
highlight the differential growth in utilization by facility
type. Between 2012 and 2015, visits to freestanding EDs
that filed claims with BCBSTX increased 236% (from
54,696 to 183,971). In contrast, hospital-based ED visits
increased 10% (from 954,548 to 1,046,545), and visits to
urgent care centers increased 24% (from 748,213 to
926,933). The absolute decrease in hospital-based ED and
urgent care center visits between 2012 and 2013 is likely
due to the slight decrease in enrollment that BCBSTX
experienced in 2013.
Figure 2 graphs the average price paid for care by facility
type and year. Between 2012 and 2015, the average price
per visit at freestanding EDs increased 54%, from $1,431
to $2,199. During this same period, the average price per
visit at hospital-based EDs increased 23%, from $1,842 to
$2,259. Prices at urgent care centers were substantially
lower and increased only 2% (from $164 to $168) between
2012 and 2015. As prices increased, the amount patients
were liable for out of pocket also increased. Freestanding
ED patients were liable for 32% out of pocket in 2012
($462/$1,431) but 35% ($763/$2,199) in 2015. Patients
treated in hospital-based EDs were liable for 29% out of
pocket in 2012 ($541/$1,842) but 33% ($749/$2,259) in
2015. Even urgent care center patients were liable for more
out of pocket over time: 36% in 2012 ($58/$164) versus
38% in 2015 ($63/$168). Median prices by provider type
and year are reported in Table E1 (available online at
http://www.annemergmed.com). The median prices are
lower than mean prices for freestanding and hospital-based
EDs, suggesting that payments to these providers are
skewed to the right. Changes in mean prices paid out of
pocket for freestanding ED patients are greater than the
change in median prices, indicating that freestanding ED
patients with the highest out-of-pocket costs fared the
worst over time.
Figure 3 graphs the average price per visit for emergency
care and the share attributed to the facility fee versus the
professional fee. Urgent care facilities do not charge a
facility fee. In each year, the facility accounts for at least
80% of the total visit price for both freestanding and
hospital-based EDs. Between 2012 and 2015, the growth
rate in the facility component was greater for freestanding

of 10%, 24%, and 236% in visits between 2012 and 2015
respectively, for hospital-based emergency departments,

 EDs than hospital-based EDs (47.0% versus 21.9%). The
growth rate for the professional component was also greater
for freestanding EDs relative to hospital-based EDs (95.0%
versus 25.7%). Table E1 (available online at http://www.
annemergmed.com) shows that mean prices paid to
facilities and physicians are higher than median prices
among freestanding and hospital-based EDs. Similar to
mean prices, increases in median prices are greater for
freestanding versus hospital EDs.
Figure 4 graphs the distribution of ED visits by
acuity level as coded in facility and professional bills for
freestanding and hospital-based EDs by year. In the facility
bills, of all visits for freestanding and hospital-based EDs,
levels 1 and 2 visits declined, respectively, from 11.1% and
16.3% in 2012 to 5.8% and 13.0% in 2015. Level 3 visits
of all visits for freestanding and hospital-based EDs also
decreased, respectively, from 49.1% and 40.8% in 2012 to
44.5% and 36.5% in 2015. In contrast, level 4 and 5 visits
of all visits for freestanding and hospital-based EDs
increased, respectively, from 25.3% and 42.8% in 2012 to
49.7% and 50.4% in 2015. Changes in the distribution of
acuity levels were similar in the professional bills, although
physicians were less likely to code visits as 99281 to 99282
relative to facilities.
Table 1 lists the 20 most common diagnoses by facility
type for 2012 to 2015 combined. The top 20 diagnoses
account for 68% of all conditions treated at freestanding
EDs, 57% at hospital-based EDs, and 77% at urgent care
centers. These figures suggest that the patient population
at hospital-based EDs is more heterogeneous than at
freestanding EDs and urgent care centers. There was
noticeable overlap in the diagnoses noted across facility
types. Fifteen of the 20 most common diagnoses treated
at freestanding EDs and 12 of the most common for

 hospital-based EDs were also in the top 20 for urgent care
centers. However, prices for patients with the same diagnosis
were on average almost 10 times higher at freestanding and
hospital-basedEDsrelativetourgentcarecenters.Forexample,
the most common diagnostic category treated at freestanding
EDs is “other upper respiratory infections,” which had an
average price of $1,351, 8.2 times the price of $165 that was
paid for the same diagnosis at urgent care centers. Hospital-
based EDs were paid $1,074 for this diagnostic category,
which was 6.5 times the price paid at urgent care centers. The
average of these price ratios for the 15 diagnostic categories
treated at both freestanding EDs and urgent care centers was
9.8. The average of these prices ratios for the 12 diagnostic
categories treated by hospital-based EDs and urgent care
centers was also 9.8. Median prices by diagnosis are reported in
Table E2 (available online at http://www.annemergmed.com).
The ratio of median prices for freestanding EDs versus urgent
care centers and for hospital-based EDs versus urgent care
centers were both on average equal to 8.0.
To check whether the higher prices in EDs versus urgent
care centers might be due to differences in patients with
specific ICD-9 codes presenting at different facilities, we
examined visits with clinical classifications software code
789 (abdominal pain) more closely. The 4 most common
5-digit ICD-9 codes in this category were epigastric pain
(789.06), generalized pain (789.07), other specified site
(789.09), and unspecified site (789.00). The 2015 price for
visits with these codes as the primary diagnosis ranged from
$3,167 to $3,785 for freestanding EDs, from $2,614 to
$3,137 for hospital-based EDs, and from $149 to $158 for
urgent care centers. Therefore, the observed price
differentials do not appear to be a consequence of
inappropriate aggregation of diagnoses.
Table 2 lists the 20 most common procedures by facility
type for the study period 2012 to 2015. The prices in
Table 2 include both the facility and professional
component of each procedure’s price.
Almost all visits to freestanding and hospital-based EDs
(98.3% and 97.1%, respectively) included a claim for an
ED visit for evaluation and management of a patient (CPT
codes 99281 to 99285). For urgent care center patients,
96.4% of visits included a claim for an office visit for a new
or established patient. There was slightly less overlap in
procedure codes between EDs and urgent care centers
Figure 4. ED visits by severity level and facility type.

 relative to the overlap in diagnoses. Thirteen of the most
common procedure codes associated with freestanding ED
visits were also one of the 20 most common for urgent care
centers, and hospital-based EDs and urgent care centers
reported 11 procedures in common. In cases in which
procedure codes overlapped, the total price per visit was 13
times higher in freestanding EDs versus urgent care centers
and 11 times higher in hospital-based EDs versus urgent
care centers. For example, the price for a therapeutic or
intravenous injection at a freestanding ED was $203, which
was 11.9 times the $17 price at an urgent care center.
Hospital-based EDs had a price of $145 for the same
injections, 8.5 times the urgent care center price. These
injections were billed for in 37.6% and 41.7% of visits to
freestanding and hospital-based EDs, respectively, and
20.6% of urgent care center visits. Median prices by
procedure are reported in Table E3 (available online at
http://www.annemergmed.com). The ratio of median
prices for freestanding EDs versus urgent care centers was
on average equal to 10.8. The ratio for hospital-based EDs
versus urgent care centers was on average equal to 11.1.
LIMITATIONS
Caveats remain in regard to our analysis. Patients may not
have paid their portion of allowed costs in the claims, which
would have led to overestimated prices. We have no reason to
believe that hospitals are more successful in collections from
insured patients than freestanding EDs, so any overestimate
of price could be similar for both. Even if patients do not pay
the full out-of-pocket price, the anxiety caused by high bills
and the potential for medical debt distresses them. Data from
one insurer may not track the full effect of freestanding EDs
in the Texas market. Other insurers may differ in their
population case mix and the number of freestanding EDs and
urgent care centers in their network.

Comparison of Usage and Costs of Freestanding Versus Hospital Emergency Departments
Ho et al

Volume 70, no. 6 : December 2017
 We lack information on hospital-based ED visits that
resulted in hospitalization because it was impossible to
determine which portion of these bills was attributable to
the ED visit and which was attributable to the admission.
For a sensitivity analysis, we removed from the sample
freestanding ED visits that resulted in a hospital admission
(1.6% of all freestanding ED visits), and the calculations on
prices and utilization remained virtually the same.
Texas’s population has increased steadily, so it would
have been informative to report the number of visits per
capita by facility type. However, we lack information on
the total number of insured consumers that BCBSTX is
responsible for. In addition to the number of BCBSTX
enrollees whom we reported, BCBSTX also processes
claims for Texas residents who are employed by
corporations based outside of Texas with Blue Cross Blue
Shield Association insurance coverage, ie, coverage from a
Blue Cross Blue Shield insurer in other states. BCBSTX
receives data only for beneficiaries who consume services
that result in a claim. It is likely that the share of all claims
coming from residents with out-of-state coverage is the
same across years, although we have no way to confirm this
statement. Because we do not report any statistics based on
rates, the presence of out-of-state coverage does not
influence the statistics that we do report.
Even though we identified significant overlap in
diagnoses across facility types, the disease severity may have
been higher for patients within disease categories treated at
emergency facilities versus urgent care centers. Previous
studies have also noted that EDs have experienced an
increase in high-intensity visits from patients with more
comorbidities and higher case-mix indices, as the population
ages and the prevalence of chronic diseases has risen.20,21
Yet, we cannot rule out the possibility that freestanding EDs
and urgent care centers that are owned by physicians who
work there3 have greater incentives to upgrade the disease
severity of claims to a higher code to receive higher
reimbursement. Future analyses with more detailed clinical
data should examine overlapping diagnoses and the potential
for rising disease severity versus upgrading more closely.

Comparison of Usage and Costs of Freestanding Versus Hospital Emergency Departments
Volume 70, no. 6 : December 2017
Annals of Emergency Medicine 853
 This study did not quantify potential benefits to patients
of faster access to care through freestanding EDs versus
hospital-based EDs, nor did we consider whether any of the
health care examined in this study (particularly care at
urgent care centers) could have instead been delivered in a
regular physician office at lower costs.
DISCUSSION
Texas passed legislation in 2009 regulating the
capabilities and operation of independently operated
freestanding EDs, including a required state license to
open. The regulations require insurance companies to cover
any initial screening examination at a licensed freestanding
ED to determine whether an emergency condition exists. If
one does, then the insurance company must also cover
treatment costs.3 Thus, freestanding EDs can earn a steady
stream of revenues in Texas if they can serve a well-insured
patient population. A recent study found that freestanding
EDs preferentially locate in zip codes with higher rates of
population growth, higher median income, higher shares
of residents with private insurance, and lower shares of
residents covered by Medicaid than in zip codes without a
freestanding ED.2 Although many freestanding EDs in
Texas are unaffiliated with hospitals, satellite emergency
facilities may be advantageous for expanding service into
suburban areas, which can then refer patients to the
flagship hospital when inpatient care is needed.22-24
Our analysis revealed that although Texans use hospital-
based EDs and urgent care centers much more than
freestanding EDs, the latter facility type experienced a 236%
increase in utilization between 2012 and 2015. The average
total price per visit was lower for freestanding EDs versus
hospital-based EDs in 2012 ($1,431 versus $1,842), but
prices in 2015 for freestanding and hospital-based EDs were
comparable ($2,199 versus $2,259). In contrast, prices for
urgent care centers were only $164 and $168 in 2012 and
2015. Out-of-pocket liability for consumers was between
29% and 36% for all these facilities in 2012 and increased to
a range of 33% to 38% in 2015. There was 75% overlap in
the 20 most common diagnoses at freestanding EDs versus
urgent care centers and 60% overlap for hospital-based EDs
and urgent care centers. However, prices for patients with
the same diagnosis were on average almost 10 times higher
at freestanding and hospital-based EDs relative to urgent
care centers. This increase in freestanding ED utilization
tracks that in the number of freestanding ED facilities year
over year. An April 2015 news article reports that 162
freestanding emergency facilities had opened in Texas since
2010 when they were first licensed by the state.9
At least 80% of the price in each year is attributable to the
facility fee for both freestanding and hospital-based EDs.
Unlike urgent care centers, both freestanding and hospital-
based EDs must provide continuous access to an emergency
physician, an emergency nurse, laboratory and radiology
technicians, moderate-complexity blood testing (such as
urinalysis with microscopy and D-dimer), and advanced
imaging such as computed tomography and
ultrasonography.25 The cost for meeting these requirements
is substantial, supporting the need for a facility fee. However,
one would expect that the operating costs of a freestanding
ED would be lower than for hospital-based EDs, which must
have costly facilities and on-call services that are prepared to
provide care for trauma, stroke, and acute coronary patients.
Past research has observed that ambulances preferentially
route higher-acuity patients with diseases or injuries that will
be more costly to hospitals instead of freestanding EDs.26
Moreover, it is difficult to claim that hospital-based EDs have
a cost advantage over freestanding EDs owing to economies
of scale because past research has concluded that the average
cost per visit does not decline as the number of patients
treated increases in EDs.27 Future studies should be
conducted examining detailed cost data by facility type to
determine in which instances the relatively equivalent prices
between freestanding and hospital-based EDs for specific
diagnoses and procedures may be justified.
Freestanding and hospital-based EDs report relatively low
proportions of visits with a billing code of 99281 and 99282.
Visits with code 99283 were more common, ranging from
36.5% of all visits for hospital-based EDs in 2015 to 49.1%
for freestanding EDs in 2015. Code 99283 reflects visits
with “moderate severity” of disease. Future studies should
investigate what proportion of these cases could be treated at
urgent care centers at lower cost, with similar outcomes for
the patient. The proportion of all visits coded at acuity levels
4 and 5 increased from 39.8% to 49.7% between 2012 and
2015 for freestanding EDs and from 42.8% to 50.4% for
hospital-based EDs. Future studies should also undertake
multiple comparisons of diagnoses and treatments across
facility types to determine what proportion of the increase in
the level of billing codes reflects true increases in disease
severity versus increased upgrades in coding.
The overlap in diagnoses across facility types that we
found, accompanied by higher prices for both freestanding
and hospital-based EDs relative to urgent care centers,
suggests that patients’ inefficient use of hospital-based EDs
found in older studies is apparent among freestanding
EDs.28-30 Patients bear a significant portion of this excess
cost, with approximately 30% or higher out-of-pocket
liability for emergency care. These out-of-pocket payments
are particularly high for visits to freestanding and hospital-
based EDs, exceeding $700 per visit in 2015. All
consumers eventually assume some burden for these high

 prices because insurance companies raise premiums to
cover increased costs. Freestanding EDs potentially waste
societal resources because they represent a high-cost
provider for services that could be delivered in lower-cost
settings. This case is particularly troublesome because
anecdotal evidence suggests patients often confuse
freestanding EDs for urgent care centers and experience
sticker shock when they receive their bills.7,31
Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,
emergency services were included as one of 10 essential
health benefits that must be covered in insurance plans.
Furthermore, the law specifies that insurers may not impose
more restrictive requirements on patients for accessing
out-of-network providers relative to conditions imposed on
in-network care. Although this language enables better
access to emergency care for patients in dire circumstances,
it also decreases the incentive for EDs to negotiate lower
prices with insurers for delivering in-network care.32
Our findings suggest that policymakers should consider
options for encouraging more efficient freestanding ED
utilization. Texas enacted legislation effective September 1,
2015, requiring freestanding EDs to notify incoming patients
that the facility charges rates comparable to those of a hospital
ED and that the facility may not be in the patient’s insurer
network.33 However, this language is weaker than the
wording in the original version of the bill, which would have
required freestanding EDs to post the minimum and
maximum physician charges and the facility fee they would
likely charge per visit.34 Patients inexperienced with the
health care system may benefit from seeing explicit potential
prices, rather than generalities of the comparability of
freestanding ED and hospital-based ED fees. Moreover, this
stronger wording would benefit freestanding ED patients who
mistakenly believe they are visiting an urgent care center.31
Policymakers could consider limiting the amount for
which freestanding EDs can balance bill patients for out-of-
network care. In Texas, insurers are required to pay out-of-
network freestanding EDs “usual and customary charges”
when no in-network provider is reasonably available.
However, the state’s rules do not prohibit balance billing
patients for out-of-network care.35 Limiting balance billing
for facility fees, which compose more than 80% of total
freestanding ED prices, seems particularly appropriate.
Texans with health maintenance organization coverage are
not liable for balance bills; the health maintenance
organization is fully responsible for paying the provider.
However, most Texans are unaware of this rule, and state
law does not prohibit providers from sending a balance bill
to health maintenance organization customers.35 New York
State is recognized as having the most comprehensive
consumer protection; the law requires consumers in
state-regulated plans to pay only in-network cost sharing
amounts for emergency services. Maryland and New
Mexico, like Texas, provide only partial protection against
balance billing.36 Policymakers might also require that
freestanding EDs display the logos of insurance companies
with negotiated in-network rates, similar to businesses
displaying the logos of credit card companies.
Employers and insurers should educate consumers on
what conditions require emergency care versus illnesses that
can be treated in alternative settings. Most major insurers
post information on their Web sites advising consumers to
seek emergency care for symptoms such as chest pain,
difficulty breathing, or head or eye injuries. These Web
sites also give examples of symptoms that can be handled at
an urgent care center, including fever without rash, ear
pain, or a sore throat. Education supplements monetary
incentives included in insurance plans, which charge higher
co-payments for visits to an emergency facility versus other
outpatient options.37
In summary, we find that the rapid growth of freestanding
EDs in Texas has been accompanied by an equally high
increase in utilization at relatively high prices that lead to
sizable out-of-pocket costs to patients. Local news reports
suggest that freestanding ED growth is faster in Texas than
other parts of the country. However, entry of freestanding
EDs has been reported elsewhere, including Alabama,
Colorado, North Carolina, and Rhode Island.3,38-40 Only
some states maintain certificate-of-need regulations that
limit entry of new health care providers, and many rules
pertaining to the regulations do not include language about
freestanding EDs.19 Our findings suggest that careful
thought must be applied when one designs insurance plans
and policies that cover freestanding EDs so that utilization
of new services is delivered in a cost-effective manner.
