Your Cheatin’ Voice Will Tell on You:
Detection of Past Infidelity from Voice
Susan M. Hughes1 and Marissa A. Harrison2
Abstract
Evidence suggests that many physical, behavioral, and trait qualities can be detected solely from the sound of a person’s voice,
irrespective of the semantic information conveyed through speech. This study examined whether raters could accurately assess
the likelihood that a person has cheated on committed, romantic partners simply by hearing the speaker’s voice. Independent
raters heard voice samples of individuals who self-reported that they either cheated or had never cheated on their romantic
partners. To control for aspects that may clue a listener to the speaker’s mate value, we used voice samples that did not differ
between these groups for voice attractiveness, age, voice pitch, and other acoustic measures. We found that participants indeed
rated the voices of those who had a history of cheating as more likely to cheat. Male speakers were given higher ratings for
cheating, while female raters were more likely to ascribe the likelihood to cheat to speakers. Additionally, we manipulated the
pitch of the voice samples, and for both sexes, the lower pitched versions were consistently rated to be from those who were
more likely to have cheated. Regardless of the pitch manipulation, speakers were able to assess actual history of infidelity; the one
exception was that men’s accuracy decreased when judging women whose voices were lowered. These findings expand upon the
idea that the human voice may be of value as a cheater detection tool and very thin slices of vocal information are all that is needed
to make certain assessments about others.

The sound of the human voice can communicate a wealth of
information to listeners that is irrespective of semantic content.
Evidence suggests that there are cues in the human voice that
can reveal accurate information about a speaker’s sex (Lass,
Hughes, Bowyer, Waters, & Bourne, 1976; Lass, Tecca,
Mancuso, & Black, 1979), age (Hughes & Rhodes, 2010;
Krauss, Freyberg, & Morsella, 2002), race (Lass et al., 1979;
Walton & Orlikoff, 1994), height and weight (Krauss et al.,
2002; Lass & Colt, 1980; Lass & Davis, 1976), body size and
configuration (Hughes, Harrison, & Gallup, 2009; Pisanski
et al., 2015), social status (Brown & Lambert, 1976), person-
ality traits (Addington, 1968; Zuckerman, Hodgins, & Miyake,
1990), and emotional and mental state attributes related to
deception (Ekman, Friesen, & Scherer, 1976; Streeter, Krauss,
Geller, Olson, & Apple, 1977). Voice attractiveness has been
linked to greater bilateral body symmetry (Hughes, Harrison, &
Gallup, 2002; Hughes, Pastizzo, & Gallup, 2008), greater facial
symmetry (Abend, Pflu
¨ger, Koppensteiner, Coquerelle, &
Grammer, 2015; Hill et al., 2017), lower waist-to-hip ratio in
women and higher shoulder-to-hip ratio in men (Hughes, Dis-
penza, & Gallup, 2004), and to the fertile phase of a woman’s
menstrual cycle (Pipitone & Gallup, 2008). Additionally, sub-
jects can accurately match voice samples to a target’s facial
photograph over 75% of the time (Krauss et al., 2002). Voice is
also used in clinical assessment for identifying certain neuro-
logical disorders such as motor neuron disease, conditions
affecting the basal ganglia (Gamboa, Jimenez-Jimenez, Mate,
& Cobeta, 2001), and for monitoring psychoactive drug effects
(Scherer & Zei, 1988).

 In particular, voices relay important information pertaining
to mating success and sexual behavior. For instance, Apicella,
Feinberg, and Marlowe (2007) found that men with lower voice
pitch have higher reproductive success (i.e., fathered more
children). Likewise, Atkinson et al. (2012) found a direct rela-
tionship between female fundamental frequency and several
measures of genetic fitness among a group of indigenous
women. There is also evidence showing that both sexes with
voices rated as sounding more attractive had first sexual inter-
course at an earlier age, a greater number of sexual partners, a
greater number of extra-pair copulation (EPC) partners, and a
higher number of partners whom they had intercourse with who
were involved in another relationship (i.e., were themselves
chosen as an EPC partner; Hughes et al., 2004).
It appears that listeners are unconsciously tuning into voice
pitch to ascribe infidelity risk to speakers. O’Connor, Re, and
Feinberg (2011) manipulated the pitch of men’s and women’s
voices to test whether raters would make cheating ascriptions
based on voice pitch. Using a forced-choice paradigm, they
found that women, but not men, rated men with lower pitched
(masculinized) voices as more likely to cheat. In contrast,
men, but not women, rated women with higher pitched (fem-
inized) voices as more likely to cheat. O’Connor et al. (2011)
attributed these results to listeners cuing in to the hormonal
profiles typically associated with opposite-sex infidelity risk.
That is, testosterone is associated with a lower pitched voice
in men (Dabbs & Mallinger, 1999; Evans, Neave, Wakelin, &
Hamilton, 2008), and it has been positively associated with
number of sex partners (Bogaert & Fisher, 1995). Indeed, it
has been shown that men’s pitch was negatively correlated
with their reported number of sexual partners over the past
year (Puts, 2005).
On the other hand, for women, estrogen is associated with
higher pitched voices (Abitbol, Abitbol, & Abitbol, 1999) and
has been positively associated with a greater likelihood to
engage in flirting, kissing, or having serious affairs with some-
one other than a primary partner (Durante & Li, 2009). Further,
women generally find lower pitched male voices as more
attractive and prefer deeper voices to higher ones (Apicella,
Feinberg, & Marlowe, 2007; Collins, 2000; Feinberg, Jones,
Little, Burt, & Perrett, 2005; Karpf, 2006; Riding, Lonsdale, &
Brown, 2006; Re, O’Connor, Bennett, & Feinberg, 2012), espe-
cially during the most fertile time of the menstrual cycle (Puts,
2005). Men assess higher pitched female voices as sounding
more attractive (Collins & Missing, 2003; Feinberg, DeBruine,
Jones, & Perrett, 2008; Re et al., 2012), particularly in short-
term mating contexts (Puts, Barndt, Welling, Dawood, & Bur-
riss, 2011). However, other studies have shown that when
females lowered the pitch of their voice, men rated their voices
as sounding “sexier” (Hughes, Farley, & Rhodes, 2010;
Hughes, Mogilski, & Harrison, 2014). Similarly, Babel,
McGuire, and King (2014) also found that female voices with
slightly lower than average fundamental frequency (i.e., pitch)
were rated as more attractive by listeners. When Puts and col-
leagues (2016) examined a large sample of female voices and
statistically controlled for several other acoustic parameters,
they found that pitch did not predict women’s attractiveness
for either short- or long-term relationships. Despite the contra-
dictory literature of what constitutes an attractive female voice,
listeners may simply have assumed that those with more attrac-
tive voices were more likely to cheat simply due to increased
sexual opportunity.
These findings raise the questions of whether voice can be
used to determine whether another has engaged in sexual infi-
delity in actuality, and if this is possible, whether vocal signals
of high mate value (e.g., voice attractiveness and attractive
pitch) are the only determinants used to assess if a speaker has
a history of infidelity. There may be subtle signals in the human
voice and/or the way in which a person speaks that can lead to
accurate perceptions of a speaker’s history of infidelity. This
idea is in line with Ambady and Rosenthal’s (1992) “thin slice”
theory that posits people can make reasonably accurate assess-
ments of others based on very minimal observations. As an
example, Rhodes, Morley, and Simmons (2013) showed that
women could accurately judge an unfamiliar man’s past unfaith-
fulness from minimal facial cues, and women used masculinity
as the valid cue to do so. People are also able to identify infide-
lity in romantic relationships simply from brief observations of
behavior. Lambert, Mulder, and Fincham (2014) found that par-
ticipants could accurately detect which targets had cheated on
their romantic partners by watching a short video clip of the pair
interacting. Lambert and colleagues determined that this detec-
tion was mediated by ascriptions of commitment and trust-
worthiness of the persons they were observing.
Research in evolutionary psychology has also routinely
supported this thin slice notion in the arena of vocal
research (i.e., very brief voice samples can be used to pre-
dict a myriad of physical and behavioral elements). For
instance, Hughes, Harrison, and Gallup (2009) showed that
listeners can select a speaker’s body configuration at a
degree greater than chance from only hearing their voice.
Specifically, listeners were able to match a man’s voice
with a silhouette approximating his shoulder-to-hip ratio,
and listeners were able to match a woman’s voice with a
silhouette approximating her waist-to-hip ratio. This ability
may be important in mate selection, as these ideal sex-
specific body configurations are a result of hormonal pro-
files signaling mate quality (see Hughes et al., 2009).
Infidelity Detection
Aside from using vocal cues, there seem to be other features
that individuals use for infidelity detection. Shackelford and
Buss (1997) identified a long list of specific behavioral cues
that can lead people to suspect a partner’s infidelity (whether
they were real or alleged) and included among them were
observations of partner engaging in changes in their normal
routines; exaggerated affection; a sudden increase in sexual
interest; emotional disengagement; passive rejection; being
overly critical, argumentative, or apathetic; reluctance to
spend time with one’s partner; and reluctance to discuss a
particular individual.

Evolutionary Psychology
 The proclivity to cheat may also be revealed through per-
sonality traits. As examined across 10 world nations, high
extroversion strongly predicts infidelity (Nettle, 2005; Nettle
& Clegg, 2008) while low agreeableness and conscientiousness
is associated with infidelity (Schmitt, 2004). Therefore, it can
be argued that choosing a long-term mate with such traits may
expose oneself to a higher risk of infidelity.
From an evolutionary standpoint, it would be reproduc-
tively advantageous for both men and women to assess
accurately a partner’s proclivity to cheat, especially consid-
ering that acts of infidelity occur at high rates. Wiederman
and Hurd (1999) found that 75% of men and 68% of women
admitted to engaging in extradyadic (ED) dating activity
and/or some form of ED sexual behavior (e.g., kissing,
fondling, intercourse) while involved in a committed,
romantic relationship. For a man, it is adaptive to be able
to detect signs of infidelity because of the possibility of
cuckoldry and investing in offspring who are not genetically
related. For a woman, it is adaptive to be able to detect
signs of infidelity so as to avoid diversion of resources by
her mate and/or avoid abandonment, which would have left
a woman and her offspring vulnerable in the ancestral envi-
ronment (Buss, 1995; Buss & Shackelford, 1997). Thus,
both men and women have different but reproductively nec-
essary reasons for detecting cheaters. Because of the inter-
personal and reproductive costs that men and women can
incur from a partner’s EPC (Shackelford, 1997), humans
have likely evolved strategies of detecting individuals that
have an increased likelihood of being unfaithful.
Presumably, because the high cost of failing to detect a
partner’s infidelity places men at risk for cuckoldry, men’s
infidelity detection system evolved to overestimate the likeli-
hood of their partner’s infidelity even more so than is the case
for women. This idea is in line with Haselton and Buss’s (2000)
error management theory; the costs of a compromised paternity
by failing to detect cues of sexual infidelity may cause men to
err by inferring infidelity even where none exists. As such,
Andrews et al. (2008) documented that men were more likely
than women to generate false positives than false negatives
when making judgments about their partner’s past infidelities.
Similarly, Goetz and Causey (2009) found that despite the fact
that men were more likely than women to report that they
themselves would commit sexual infidelity in the future, they
were still more suspicious of their partner’s future infidelity
than were women.
Despite these sex differences in suspicion, when it comes to
intrasexual competition, both sexes view rivals with a high
mate value as particularly threatening (Buss, Shackelford,
Choe, Buunk, & Dijkstra, 2000), especially when the rivals
have a more attractive body configuration (Buunk & Dijkstra,
2005; Dijkstra & Buunk, 2001) or a more attractive face (Mas-
sar & Buunk, 2010). This is even the case with voice; men with
more masculine-sounding voices and women with more
feminine-sounding voices elicit greater jealousy responses and
are perceived more frequently to be intrasexual threats and
rivals (O’Connor & Feinberg, 2012).
Current Study
We examined whether it was possible to determine whether an
individual had previously cheated on an exclusive, romantic
partner by solely listening to that person’s voice. First, we
expanded upon the procedures of O’Connor et al. (2011) by
using nonmanipulated, natural voices, and compared listen-
ers’ ratings for likelihood to cheat with reports of speakers’
actual history of infidelity. Because of the possibility that
raters may assume that those with higher mate value were
more likely to cheat simply due to increased sexual opportu-
nity, we aimed to control for aspects of the voice that may
contribute to the perception of a speaker’s mate value, partic-
ularly voice attractiveness and vocal pitch. Therefore, we
selected voice samples from a larger pool of speakers
obtained from a previous study (see Hughes et al., 2004) as
our stimuli that differed between groups on self-reported
cheating history but matched for several attributes related to
mate value. Second, in an attempt to replicate the findings of
O’Connor et al. (2011), we also manipulated the voice sam-
ples for pitch to see whether raters ascribed cheating beha-
viors more for the higher pitched female voices and lower
pitched male voices, and we examined how this may relate
to actual records of infidelity. However, evidence regarding
the effect of a higher vocal pitch on perceptions of women’s
attractiveness is not conclusive in the literature, with several
studies demonstrating higher attractiveness ratings for low-
ered pitch female voices (Babel, McGuire, & King, 2014;
Hughes et al., 2010, 2014). Because a lowered female voice
may relate to sexual intent and/or arousal by the female
speaker (Henton & Bladon, 1985; Hughes et al., 2010;
Karpf, 2006), we predicted that women with lowered pitched
voices may be evaluated as having a greater likelihood of
committing infidelity.
Method
Participants
One hundred fifty-two undergraduate students (64 men and 88
women) from a small northeastern U.S. college served as
independent raters for this study. Their mean age was 20.01
(SD ¼ 2.13; age ranging from 18 to 32). Participants’ reported
ethnicities were as follows: 65% Caucasian/White, 23%
African-American/Black, 7% Hispanic/Latino, 4% Asian, and
1% other. Only those who reported having a heterosexual
orientation were included in the analyses reported above.
Additionally, 45% reported currently being in an exclusive,
committed, romantic relationship, while 55% reported that
they were not.
Participation in this study was voluntary, and all procedures
were approved by the local institutional review board. Partici-
pants who were enrolled in psychology courses at the college
were given the opportunity to receive extra credit as compen-
sation for their participation, although some participants
volunteered for no remuneration.

 Vocal Stimuli
We obtained voice samples from a larger data set (see Hughes
et al., 2004) that were of a number count from 1 to 10, where
speakers were instructed to speak at a pace of approximately
one numeral per second. Following the procedures of O’Con-
nor et al. (2011) who had used nine original male voices and
nine original female voices, we selected 10 male voices and
10 female voices for this study. Half of the speakers for each
sex reported that they had sexual intercourse with a person
outside of a previous or current, exclusive and committed
romantic relationship at some point in their lives (i.e., were
“cheaters”), and the other half reported never cheating on
their partners. All voice samples were of individuals who
reported being heterosexual, White, unmarried, and were cur-
rently in a committed, exclusive relationship, thus assuring
that speakers had at least one relationship opportunity to cheat
in their lives.
In an attempt to control for aspects of the voice that may
contribute to the perception of a speaker’s mate value, we
selected voice samples of speakers who matched between the
cheater and noncheater groups on criteria related to mate value.
As shown in Table 1, there were no mean differences between
the cheater and noncheater voice samples in terms of the speak-
er’s age, independent voice attractiveness ratings made on a 5-
point rating scale (as described in Hughes et al., 2004), and
voice pitch for each sex, all of which may affect one’s percep-
tion of a speaker’s mate value (Apicella & Feinberg, 2009;
Hughes et al., 2004; Hughes & Rhodes, 2010).
Table 1 also presents a comparison between speaker groups
for other acoustic measures that relate to the perception of
voice quality such as fundamental frequency SD, jitter, shim-
mer, harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), and voice sample dura-
tion. Using Praat 5.3.70 software, five jitter measures were
taken (local, local absolute, relative average perturbation,

 5-point period perturbation quotient, and difference of differ-
ences of periods) and six shimmer measures were taken (local,
local dB, 3-, 5-, and 11-point amplitude perturbation quotient,
and difference of differences of periods). A principal compo-
nent factor analysis was performed for the jitter and shimmer
measurements separately, resulting in one jitter factor (eigen-
value: 4.823; Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin sampling adequacy: 0.850;
Bartlett’s test of sphericity:w2 ¼ 304.12, p < .001) and one
shimmer factor (eigenvalue: 5.911; Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin sam-
pling adequacy: 0.891; Bartlett’s test of sphericity:w2 ¼ 510.06,
p < .001). Factor regression scores were compared between
cheater and noncheater groups for each sex and are reported
in Table 1. Our acoustic measures are similar to other reports of
voice measures in normal, young adults (Naufel de Felippe,
Grillo, & Grechi, 2006; Toran & Lal, 2009).
Further, since previous investigations have shown that voice
is related to particular body measures (see Hughes et al., 2004,
2009) and sexual behaviors (Hughes et al., 2004), we also
selected speakers between the two groups who showed no dif-
ference in their height, weight, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR),
shoulder-to-hip ratio (SHR), or body mass index (BMI), and
reported measures of certain sexual behaviors (i.e., age of first
masturbation, age of first sexual intercourse, number of sexual
partners throughout lifetime) for each sex, as shown in Table 1.
Pitch Manipulation
In addition to using natural voice samples, we created two
versions of each voice recording, a raised pitch version, and
a lowered pitch version, using Pratt 5.3.70 software. Following
the procedures of O’Connor et al. (2011), voice pitch was
manipulated by þ0.50 ERB for a higher pitch and �0.50 ERB
for a lower pitch from their baseline, allowing for the degree of
pitch manipulation to be perceived equivalently regardless of
the natural pitch. The manipulated pitches for female voices
were significantly different from normal pitch (M ¼ 197.60 Hz,
SD ¼ 8.44) for both raised pitch samples, M ¼ 232.28 Hz, SD
¼ 10.04; t(9) ¼ 11.40, p < .001, and lowered pitched samples,
M ¼ 169.84 Hz, SD ¼ 10.20; t(9) ¼ 9.84, p < .001. Likewise,
the manipulated pitches for male voices were significantly dif-
ferent from normal pitch (M ¼ 135.17 Hz, SD ¼ 16.27) for both
raised pitch samples, M ¼ 159.29 Hz, SD ¼ 16.79; t(9) ¼ 6.96,
p < .001, and lowered pitched samples, M ¼ 104.61 Hz, SD ¼
13.34; t(9) ¼ 5.72, p < .001.
The pitch of the raised male voices was not significantly
different between the cheater (M ¼ 158.51 Hz, SD ¼ 21.77)
and noncheater groups (M ¼ 160.07 Hz, SD ¼ 12.61), t(8) ¼
0.14, p ¼ .893, nor was the pitch for the lowered male voices
for cheater (M ¼ 102.91 Hz, SD ¼ 13.78) and noncheater
groups (M ¼ 106.31 Hz, SD ¼ 14.25), t(8) ¼ 0.38, p ¼ .712.
Similarly, there was no difference in pitch between cheater
(M ¼ 230.00 Hz, SD ¼ 8.91) and noncheater groups (M ¼
234.56 Hz, SD ¼ 11.61) for the raised female voices, t(8) ¼
0.70, p ¼ .505, or between cheater (M ¼ 170.02 Hz, SD ¼ 6.01)
and noncheater groups (M ¼ 169.66 Hz, SD ¼ 14.07) for the
lowered female voices, t(8) ¼ 0.05, p ¼ .960.
To assure that our manipulated samples sounded natural,
prior to the study, we conducted a perceptual manipulation
check using independent raters (N ¼ 7). Each of these raters
were asked to listen to each manipulated voice sample to deter-
mine whether the voice sounded like a natural voice or manipu-
lated voice sample, and all raters (100%) confirmed that each
manipulated voice had the quality and naturalness of a nonma-
nipulated voice.
Independent Ratings
We tested participants either individually or in small groups in a
private, quiet setting. After raters completed a brief demographic
questionnaire, they answered a set of questions designed to
determine the degree to which they thought engaging in certain
sexual behaviors with others when in an exclusive committed,
romantic relationship was considered an “act of cheating” on
their partner. Respondents were asked to rate different sexual
acts using a 10-point scale ranging from 1 ¼ not at all cheating
to 10 ¼ very much so cheating. The five sexual acts rated were
kissing on the lips, kissing with tongue, intimate touching/fond-
ling, oral sex, and sexual intercourse. These questions were gen-
erated by the research team to first gain a sense of what
respondents considered were acts of cheating since they were
later asked to assess how likely they believed speakers had
cheated on their partners. The interrater reliability was relatively
high for these items (Cronbach’s a ¼ .83).
Participants then listened to voice samples through stereo-
phonic computer speakers and were asked, “Using the follow-
ing scale, please rate how likely you think the person speaking
has ‘cheated’ on their romantic partner with whom they are in
an exclusive, committed relationship.” They gave responses for
each voice on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 ¼ not at all likely
to 10 ¼ very likely. In contrast to the forced-choice paradigm
that O’Connor et al. (2011) used, we obtained interval scale
measures to allow for greater variability in ratings and for
parametric analyses.
To avoid fatigue effects, we did not ask raters to judge all 60
voice ratings (20 natural and 40 manipulated voices samples).
Rather, each participant rated 20 voice samples. The 20 natural
voice samples were rated by 54 participants (25 men and 29
women). The manipulated female voices were rated by another
set of 45 participants (19 men and 26 women) while the
manipulated male voice samples were rated by another 53
participants (20 men and 33 women). Voice samples were
played by the experimenter in a counterbalanced order. The
interrater reliability was adequate for both the normal voice
samples (Cronbach’s a ¼ .71) and for the manipulated pitch
samples (Cronbach’s a ¼ .73).
Results
Assessment of “Acts of Cheating”
We conducted a 5(type of sexual act) � 2(respondent sex)
mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine the
Hughes and Harrison

 extent to which respondents thought a given sexual behavior
was considered an “act of cheating” on a partner when in an
exclusive, committed, romantic relationship. There was a main
effect for sexual act, F(4, 496) ¼ 36.73, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .228,
and post hoc analysis revealed that all pairwise comparisons
were significantly different from one another with the excep-
tion of touching/fondling and kissing with tongue (presented in
the order of magnitude: sexual intercourse, M ¼ 9.89, SE ¼
0.07; oral sex, M ¼ 9.76, SE ¼ 0.09; intimate touching/fond-
ling, M ¼ 9.07, SE ¼ 0.14; kissing with tongue, M ¼ 9.03, SE
¼ 0.16; and kissing on the lips, M ¼ 8.33, SE ¼ 0.22; p values <
.001). There was no main effect for the sex of the respondent,
F(1, 124) ¼ 1.51, p ¼ .222, Z2 ¼ .012, nor a significant inter-
action between respondent sex and sexual act, F(4, 496) ¼
0.82, p ¼ .511, Z2 ¼ .007.
Cheating Assessment: Natural Voices
A binary logistic regression was performed to determine which
of the acoustic measures (mean pitch, F0SD, jitter factor, shim-
mer factor, HNR, duration) along with speaker sex were pre-
dictors of the whether a speaker’s voice was that of a cheater or
not. The overall logistic regression model was not reliable in
distinguishing between the voices of cheaters and noncheaters,
w2(7) ¼ 8.15, p ¼ .320; Nagelkerke R2 ¼ .446, �2 log like-
lihood ¼ 19.58, and none of the variables in the equation added
significantly to the model.
We used a 2(cheater/noncheater group) � 2(speaker sex) �
2(rater sex) mixed-model ANOVA to analyze mean ratings of
how likely participants thought the speakers had cheated on a
romantic partner while in an exclusive, committed relationship
for the nonmanipulated voice samples. The within-subject fac-
tors were the speaker cheater group and the speaker sex, as
these voice samples were heard by each rater, while the rater
sex was the between-subject factor. Dependent measures were
calculated as mean values for each of the four vocal conditions
heard by each rater: (1) male voices/cheater group, (2) male
voices/noncheater group, (3) female voices/cheater group, and
(4) female voices/noncheater group. Preliminary assumptions
were performed to check for normality, linearity, outliers, and
homogeneity of variance with no significant issues noted.
There was a main effect of cheater versus noncheater group,
whereby raters thought speakers who reported that they had
cheated on a romantic partner were more likely to be suspected
as being a cheater (M ¼ 5.02, SE ¼ 0.13) than speakers who
reported not to have cheated on romantic partners (M ¼ 4.59,
SE ¼ 0.11), F(1, 52) ¼ 11.95, p ¼ .001, Z2 ¼ .187. There was
also a main effect for the sex of the speakers, F(1, 52) ¼ 27.67,
p < .001, Z2 ¼ .347; overall, male speakers were rated as more
likely to have cheated (M ¼ 5.14, SE ¼ 0.13) than were female
speakers (M ¼ 4.47, SE ¼ 0.11). Likewise, there was a main
effect for the sex of the raters, F(1, 52) ¼ 7.03, p ¼ .011, Z2 ¼
.119, whereby female raters gave higher ratings for cheating (M
¼ 5.08, SE ¼ 0.14) than had male raters (M ¼ 4.53, SE ¼ 0.15).
There were no significant interactions found (see Table 2 for
descriptive statistics).
To account for any effects of ethnicity, we considered the
mean ratings made only by raters who were of the same ethni-
city as all the speakers (White, N ¼ 40, 23 men). The main
effect for cheater group, F(1, 38) ¼ 18.57, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .328,
and main effect for sex of speaker, F(1, 38) ¼ 20.85, p < .001,
Z2 ¼ .354, remained; however, there was no main effect for sex
of rater, F(1, 38) ¼ 2.11, p ¼ .154, Z2 ¼ .053. Both the age and
relationship status of the raters did not affect the findings.
Cheating Assessment: Manipulated Voices
A 2(cheater/noncheater group) � 3(lower/higher pitch) �
2(rater sex) factorial analysis was used to examine whether the
manipulated pitch voice samples influenced ratings of the like-
lihood speakers were thought to have cheated on their partners.
Because the manipulated voices of male and female speakers
were judged by different raters, we analyzed male and female
voices separately (see Table 2 for descriptive statistics). For
manipulated male voices, the main effect of cheater versus
noncheater group remained evident, whereby raters thought
male speakers who reported that they had cheated on a roman-
tic partner were more likely to be suspected as being a cheater
(M ¼ 4.94, SE ¼ 0.13) than speakers who reported not to have
cheated on their romantic partners (M ¼ 4.61, SE ¼ 0.12), F(1,
51) ¼ 6.93, p ¼ .011, Z2 ¼ .120. There was also a main effect
for voice pitch whereby manipulated lower pitched male voices
(M ¼ 5.08, SE ¼ 0.15) were given higher cheating ratings than
manipulated higher pitched male voices (M ¼ 4.47, SE ¼ 0.12),
F(1, 51) ¼ 14.01, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .216. Further, there was a main
effect for the sex of the raters, F(1, 51) ¼ 5.51, p ¼ .023, Z2 ¼
.097, whereby female raters gave speakers of manipulated male
voices higher ratings for cheating (M ¼ 5.03, SE ¼ 0.13) than
had male raters (M ¼ 4.52, SE ¼ 0.17). There were no signif-
icant interactions found for the manipulated male voices.
For manipulated female voices, the main effect of cheater
versus noncheater group also remained, whereby raters thought
female speakers who reported that they had cheated on a
romantic partner were more likely to be suspected as being a
cheater (M ¼ 5.11, SE ¼ 0.15) than speakers who reported not
to have cheated (M ¼ 4.56, SE ¼ 0.14), F(1, 43) ¼ 12.52, p ¼
.001, Z2 ¼ .225. There was also a main effect for voice pitch
whereby manipulated lower pitched female voices (M ¼ 5.20,

 SE ¼ 0.16) received higher cheating scores than manipulated
higher pitched voices (M ¼ 4.48, SE ¼ 0.18), F(1, 43) ¼ 9.05,
p ¼ .004, Z2 ¼ .174. Unlike for male manipulated voices, there
was no main effect for sex of rater for female manipulated
voices, F(1, 43) ¼ 0.53, p ¼ .472, Z2 ¼ .012. In addition, there
was a significant three-way interaction between voice cheater
group, manipulated pitch, and rater sex, F(1, 43) ¼ 10.76, p ¼
.002, Z2 ¼ .200. When divided by rater sex, male raters were
able to distinguish between manipulated higher pitched female
voices of women who had reported cheating (M ¼ 4.68, SD ¼
1.51) from women who had not (M ¼ 4.17, SD ¼ 1.45), t(18) ¼
2.42, p ¼ .026, Cohen’s d ¼ .344. However, male raters did not
rate female voices with a manipulated lower pitch any differ-
ently based upon whether the speaker had a history of cheating
(M ¼ 5.04, SD ¼ 1.02) or not (M ¼ 5.11, SD ¼ 1.15), t(18) ¼
0.21, p ¼ .833. On the other hand, female raters found female
speakers who reported having cheated on a romantic partner as
more likely to have cheated regardless if their pitch was
manipulated to sound higher (cheater: M ¼ 4.80, SD ¼ 1.05;
noncheater: M ¼ 4.25, SD ¼ 1.23, t(25) ¼ 2.39, p ¼ .025,
Cohen’s d ¼ .481) or lower (cheater: M ¼ 5.93, SD ¼ 1.69;
noncheater: M ¼ 4.72, SD ¼ 0.99, t(25) ¼ 4.56, p < .001,
Cohen’s d ¼ .873).
To examine whether listeners were performing above or
below chance levels, several single-sample t-tests were con-
ducted and reported in Table 2. Only natural voices of male
cheaters and manipulated, lowered voices of female cheaters
had mean infidelity ratings that exceeded the chance value of
5 on the 10-point rating scales. Natural voices of female non-
cheaters, manipulated, raised voices of male cheaters and
noncheaters, and manipulated, raised voices of female non-
cheaters had infidelity ratings that fell significantly below
chance value.
Discussion
What Is Cheating?
We first wanted to gain a better understanding of which sexual
acts our raters agreed had constituted cheating behaviors since
they were later asked to rate how likely a speaker was a cheater.
We found that although most behaviors (even fondling, touch-
ing, and kissing) were rated high on the scale as acts considered
to be cheating, participants thought sexual intercourse and oral
sex were the most likely behaviors to signify cheating. These
findings are in line with more comprehensive studies that have
documented which sexual and erotic acts are perceived as
cheating behaviors (Kruger et al., 2013; Yarab, Sensibaugh,
& Allgeier, 1998). It is also worth noting that there were no
sex differences in defining which behaviors represented cheat-
ing. Similarly, Kruger et al. found that men and women were in
agreement as to which sexual or erotic acts are deemed cheat-
ing behaviors. However, these researchers addressed the pos-
sibility that the data were limited by a ceiling effect, since both
men and women rated most acts as being highly indicative of
cheating, as was the case in our study. Needless to say, the
identification of “cheating” behaviors was operationalized by
our participants and revealed that engaging in a variety of sex-
ual acts was considered “cheating.”
Voice and Cheater Detection
We found that individuals can use cues in a voice to determine
whether a speaker had cheated on their romantic partners. By
simply hearing a brief voice recording, raters judged actual
cheaters as more likely to have cheated. These data provide
further evidence that the human voice can be of value as a
cheater detection tool. Since we controlled for voice attractive-
ness, voice pitch and other acoustic measures, and a variety of
features related to mate value (e.g., age, BMI, WHR, SHR,
certain sexual behaviors), this effect was not dependent upon
obvious vocal cues that may signal a speaker’s higher mate
value or on features to suggest the person may have had more
sexual opportunity to have affairs.
These findings also extend those of O’Connor et al. (2011)
by showing that the sound of one’s voice can be used as a
medium to assess a person’s reported past history of infidelity.
While O’Connor and colleagues’ study showed how manipu-
lating pitch plays a role in appraising a speaker’s proclivity to
be unfaithful, our study demonstrated that perceptions of a
speaker’s actual history of infidelity could, in fact, be deter-
mined through voice alone. Further, these findings demonstrate
the validity of Ambady and Rosenthal’s (1992) thin slice the-
ory, whereby one can make accurate assessments of another
based on merely brief observations. These data also suggest
that cognitive strategies have evolved to facilitate wise mate
choices, holding true even when only the auditory sensory
modality is operating.
We were unable to identify exactly which acoustic qualities
were driving the perception of cheating ascriptions, albeit a
detailed acoustical analysis beyond the aims and scope of this
perceptual study. It is interesting, then, to speculate what
aspects of the human voice raters were using to make these
accurate assessments because we eliminated differences
between groups for the more conspicuous cues of a voice that
could be driving factors (i.e., variations in vocal attractiveness,
voice pitch, and other basic acoustic features). While evidence
shows that a voice can be used to assess various traits and
behaviors, the acoustic parameters that allow for these various
voice assessments are largely unknown (Hughes et al., 2008).
There is also considerable debate about which exact properties
of a voice allow for the perception of assessing an attractive-
sounding voice (see Hughes & Gallup, 2008), and it may be a
unique constellation of different acoustic features that contrib-
ute to perceived vocal attractiveness (Babel et al., 2014).
There could be a host of possible vocal parameters beyond
those measured in this study that may be responsible for
“leaking” information about one’s history of infidelity, as
demonstrated from studies examining vocal emotion expres-
sion (see Patel, Scherer, Bjo
¨rkner, Sundberg, 2011). Other
vocal cues such as clarity of articulation may have also con-
tributed to perceptions of infidelity. For example, masculine
Hughes and Harrison
7
 men tend to display less clarity in their speech and show pho-
netic patterns indicative of masculinity, which in turn could be
associated with infidelity threat (Kempe, Puts, & Ca
´rdenas,
2013). However, as mentioned, a more detailed acoustic anal-
ysis of our voice samples was beyond the scope of this percep-
tual study and would have required a far larger sample size of
vocal stimuli to allow one to appropriately interpret such anal-
yses. Further, because we used stimuli that were not intended
for a more detailed acoustic analysis (i.e., we did not have
speakers provide sustained vowel utterances), we were limited
in the features we could accurately assess (Parsa & Jamieson,
2001). As Parsa and Jamieson noted, analysis of continuous
speech can be more challenging than examining sustained
vowels because of the inherent inconsistency of the signal and
unvoiced silent regions of speech.
It may be the case that appraisal for the “propensity for
infidelity” is a reflection of personality traits that can be
revealed through the voice (Mairesse, Walker, Mehl, & Moore,
2007). For instance, extroverts show greater variation in fun-
damental frequency, greater voice quality, and fewer silent
pauses (see Mairesse et al., 2007 for review), and high extro-
version strongly predicts infidelity (Nettle, 2005; Nettle &
Clegg, 2008). While our sample of voices was too small to
appropriately make this sort of determination, it would be inter-
esting to see whether particular speech patterns exist for those
who have been identified via voice as having a greater
proclivity to cheat on their partners and if this relates to par-
ticular personality measures.
It could be argued that these results are a reflection of past
experience, and participants may have generalized attributes of
voices of previous partners they had known to have cheated in
order to make these assessments. While there is evidence that
one can learn to better uncover deception and improve lie
detection accuracy through vocal cues, the effect only holds
true for decoding practice with a particular target, and it does
not generalize to accuracy in detecting lies enacted by other
deceivers (Zuckerman, Koestner, & Alton, 1984). A high level
of accuracy when detecting deceit through voice is also thought
to occur when spoken deceptions involve emotion (Ekman,
O’Sullivan, Friesen, & Scherer, 1991). However, it is important
to realize that the voice samples used in this study were not
capturing a transient state of intentional deceit (as we had
removed any content and emotion from the vocal samples by
using a number count) but were revealing of more enduring
trait aspects of the voice.
Sex Differences in Cheating Detection
These findings also extend reports of sex differences in judging
a partner’s faithfulness. Whereas the female raters in this study
were not necessarily more accurate in ascribing whether a male
speaker had actually cheated, they were more likely to suspect
that male speakers had cheated than did the male raters asses-
sing female speakers, and this held true for both natural and for
manipulated male voices. This finding corroborates reports that
both male and female raters tend to think that men are more
likely to have cheated in their past (DeVries & Ajzen, 1971)
and a large questionnaire study found that college women were
much more likely to believe that all men cheat on a partner at
least once (Knox, Zusman, & McNeely, 2004). In addition, we
found that among the natural voices, male cheaters were the
only group whose mean infidelity ratings exceeded chance
level, while female voices of noncheaters fell below chance
level. Perhaps this sex difference can be explained by reports
that men are more likely to commit infidelity (Michael, Gag-
non, Laumann, & Kolata, 1995) and adultery (Kinsey,
Pomeroy, Martin, & Gebhard, 1953). Data from more recent
studies also substantiate the claim that men are more likely to
engage in extradyadic sexual activity than are women (Allen &
Baucom, 2004) and men were more likely than women to
report that they themselves would commit sexual infidelity in
the future (Goetz & Causey, 2009).
When it comes to sex differences in cheater detection, Ein-
Dor, Perry-Paldi, Hirschberger, Birnbaum, and Deutsch (2015)
showed that women displayed greater alertness to cues of a
potential partner unfaithfulness than do men; however, while
women were quicker and more accurate in detecting cues of
infidelity, they were not better at detecting actual threats from
others. Further, Rhodes et al. (2013) found that women could
accurately judge a man’s past infidelity simply from minimal
facial cues and used masculinity as the valid cue to do so,
whereas men were comparably less adept at this task. Andrews
et al. (2008) also found sex differences in making inferences
about a romantic partner’s infidelity, but in their study, men
made more accurate inferences than women, as men’s ratio of
positive to negative errors was greater. These findings are con-
sistent with the error management theory which posits that, for
men, the costs of failed pursuits (false positive errors) outweigh
the costs of missed sexual opportunities (false-negative errors;
Haselton & Buss, 2000). More research is needed to elucidate
sex differences in infidelity detection.
Voice Pitch and Cheater Detection
When manipulating pitch to determine its impact on percep-
tions of speakers’ infidelity, the effect of correct cheater iden-
tification remained despite these changes in pitch; participants
were still attributing higher cheating ratings to those who had
reported a history of cheating regardless of the manipulations
in pitch. The one exception was that male raters could not
distinguish between cheaters and noncheaters for women with
lower pitch voices.
We replicated O’Connor et al.’s (2011) finding that men
with manipulated lower pitched voices were more likely to
be ascribed as cheaters. Similarly, a subsequent study con-
ducted by O’Connor and Barclay (2017) also showed that lis-
teners perceived higher pitched male voices as being more
trustworthy, less likely to commit infidelity, and less likely to
poach another’s romantic partner than lower pitched male
voices. O’Connor, Pisanski, Tigue, Fraccaro, and Feinberg
(2014) found that the more likely a woman believed that men
with lower pitch voices engage in infidelity, the more likely she
8
Evolutionary Psychology
 preferred men with low-pitch voices for short term as compared
to long-term relationships. The authors suggested that this
mechanism allows women to assess fitness and abandonment
costs associated with infidelity.
Similar to O’Connor and Barclay (2017), we were also
unable to replicate the findings of O’Connor et al. (2011) with
regard to perceptions of infidelity relating to women with
voices manipulated to be a higher pitch. Just as with male
voices, we documented that women with voices manipulated
to have a lower pitch were also thought to be more likely to
have cheated than those with higher pitches. In fact, female
cheaters whose voices were lowered were the only group of
manipulated voices whose mean infidelity ratings exceeded
chance level. O’Connor and colleagues (2011) attributed their
findings to that fact that higher pitched female voices reflect
higher estrogen and mate value, and therefore these women
may have more opportunity to cheat. However, our findings
suggest that perhaps testosterone, which is linked to both lower
pitch (Abitbol et al., 1999; Damrose, 2009; Evans et al., 2008;
Grisa et al., 2012) and sex drive, even in women (Abitbol et al.,
1999; Davis, 2000), is what may be driving this perception for
both sexes. Further, our findings are in line with evidence
showing that women tend to speak with deeper voices when
conveying sexual interest to men (Hughes et al., 2010; Karpf,
2006). In fact, when participants were asked to intentionally
display a “sexy voice,” women had decreased the pitch of their
voices even more than had men and showed greater success in
being perceived as having a sexier voice (Hughes et al., 2014;
Tuomi, & Fisher, 1979). Therefore, it is possible that raters
associated a lower pitched female voice to women who were
intentionally seeking casual sexual encounters such as affairs.
In this same vein, it has been shown that female voices with a
breathier voice quality were rated as more attractive (Babel
et al., 2014). Henton and Bladon (1985) suggested that when
a woman displays a breathier voice, she is imitating a voice
quality associated with arousal, and if a woman can manage to
sound as though she is sexually aroused, she may be regarded
as more desirable by men. In our study, manipulated lower
pitched female voices appeared to have made actual cheater
detection for men more difficult; men were unable to decipher
which speakers were cheaters for the lower pitch voices but
were able to do so for the higher pitch female voices.
Another possible reason why our findings for manipulated
female voices did not confirm those of O’Connor et al. (2011)
may be methodological differences. O’Connor et al. used a
two-alternative, forced-choice paradigm to select which
speaker was more likely to cheat, whereas our study presented
voice samples individually and used interval rating scales to
generate more variability in responses. Our study also utilized
longer vocal samples (i.e., a number count) as stimuli while
O’Connor et al. used sustained vowel sounds. Studies examin-
ing how stimulus type affect voice attractiveness ratings have
shown that word length samples tend to be rated as more attrac-
tive to the opposite sex than vowel sounds taken from the same
targets (Ferdenzi et al., 2013), so perhaps the type of stimuli
used in each study examining the detection of infidelity from
voice captured different percepts. Nonetheless, O’Connor and
Barclay (2017) were also unable to replicate the findings of
O’Connor et al. (2011) by failing to demonstrate that female
voice pitch had a significant effect on perceptions of infidelity.
Because the authors used similar stimuli and degree of pitch
manipulations as the previous investigation, they concluded
that their failure to replicate the findings of O’Connor et al.
(2011) was unlikely due to methodological differences between
the two studies. Thus, additional work on how pitch contributes
to the perception of infidelity of female voices is warranted.
Limitations and Future Directions
There were limitations to this study. Our data regarding infide-
lity were based on self-report and may not have accurately
depicted participants’ histories (i.e., because of social desirabi-
lity, participants may have underreported their EPC history). It is
also possible that given our young sample of speakers, there may
have been less opportunity to cheat than in an older sample. In
addition, we did not examine the cheating status of raters. Future
studies could account for whether raters’ own history of infide-
lity plays a role in their ability to determine another’s infidelity,
and this may better parse apart whether cheater detection apti-
tude through voice is more of an inherent or experiential ability.
Moreover, it would be interesting to replicate these findings
with those of different sexual orientations.
Because this was a perceptual study, we wanted to use con-
tinuous speech as our stimuli since this is a better representa-
tion of how perceptual judgments occur in “the real world” and
would allow for greater ecological validity. Unlike examining
sustained vowels which have been used in other perceptual
studies, continuous speech can account for rapid voice onset
and termination, variations in voice fundamental frequency and
amplitude, and voice breaks (Parsa & Jamieson, 2001). None-
theless, use of continuous speech stimuli comes at a cost in
terms of acoustic analyses. When individual acoustic measures
are considered in isolation, it has been shown that classification
of voice quality is more accurate for measures derived from
sustained vowels than for continuous speech samples (Parsa &
Jamieson, 2001). In particular, perturbation measures such as
shimmer and jitter extracted from continuous speech samples
are likely to be influenced by intonation and other modulation
effects and reduce the identification of voice quality, thus mak-
ing it more challenging to examine objectively because of its
dynamic signal.
Future work on this topic could also manipulate other fea-
tures of the voice to assess what acoustic components are used
to make this assessment outside of voice pitch. For instance,
future investigations that utilize larger sample sizes of vocal
stimuli could take into account how certain indexical features
of speech may be revealing of personal information about the
speakers. As an example, both men and women judge a breath-
ier female voice to be more attractive, and this appears to
indicate healthier, younger, more feminine larynges (Babel
et al., 2014). Future studies may wish to manipulate breathiness
to determine effects on cheating ascriptions.

 If pitch is a salient signal that impacts infidelity perceptions,
matching pitch between cheaters and noncheaters may have
obscured performance accuracy. It is possible that judgment
would be influenced and even improved by allowing raters to
hear naturally occurring pitch differences between speakers.
Therefore, future investigations could also examine naturally
occurring voices that are not matched in pitch to see if their
accuracy to detect infidelity improves further with pitch
variation.
Conclusion
In sum, this study provides further evidence that voice may be
used as a cue of mate infidelity. We were able to demonstrate
that is it possible to determine whether a person had cheated on
their romantic partners from hearing their voice alone. By using
natural voice samples (i.e., those that were not experimentally
manipulated) and self-reports of an actual history of infidelity,
we were able to extend the external validity of previous inves-
tigations (O’Connor, Re, & Feinberg, 2011) by showing how
voice can be used to uncover a speaker’s actual history of
infidelity. While we cannot exactly pinpoint all the features
about a voice that our perceptual system is using to make this
assessment, we know that pitch plays a role, but does not rep-
resent the entire picture. We were able to replicate previous
findings showing that pitch seems to be of importance when
making this assessment, albeit not a necessary component since
raters were still able to identify cheaters regardless of pitch
manipulation (with the one exception of men’s assessment
of lower pitch female voices). In addition to the many other
cheater detection mechanisms we hold in our mating strategy
repertoire, using voice to detect infidelity may have important
implications for our mating success as seen from an evolu-
tionary standpoint.
