quantity of emission sources such as inappropriate 
vehicles.[11‑13] About 4.3 million people die from 
household air pollution and 3.7 million from ambient 
air pollution, most of whom (3.3 and 2.6 million, 
respectively) live in Asia.[14] In Iran, as a developing 
country, the level of air pollutants has increased 
gradually since the beginning of industrialization in the 
1970s, but it has reached a very harmful level in some 
megacities such as Tehran, Mashhad, Tabriz, Isfahan, 
Ahvaz, Arak, and Karaj over the past two decades. Iran 
is the world’s third main polluted country in the world, 
which results in 16 billion $ annual loss.[15] In fact, four 
of the top ten air‑polluted cities are in Iran. Ahvaz is 
the most air polluted city in the world with microdust 
blowing in from neighboring countries, and particulate 
levels three times that of Beijing, and nearly 13 times that 
of London.[16] Air pollution caused almost 4460 deaths in 
2013 only in Tehran although the reality seemed higher 
and is getting worse every year.[17] Therefore, it is of great 
importance to describe the problem, particularly its toxic 
INTRODUCTION
Air pollution is a major problem of recent decades, 
which has a serious toxicological impact on human 
health and the environment. The sources of pollution 
vary from small unit of cigarettes and natural sources 
such as volcanic activities to large volume of emission 
from motor engines of automobiles and industrial 
activities.[1,2] Long‑term effects of air pollution on the 
onset of diseases such as respiratory infections and 
inflammations, cardiovascular dysfunctions, and cancer 
is widely accepted;[3‑6] hence, air pollution is linked with 
millions of death globally each year.[7‑9] A recent study 
has revealed the association between male infertility 
and air pollution.[10]
Air pollution has now emerged in developing countries 
as a result of industrial activities and also increase the 
Air pollution is a major concern of new civilized world, which has a serious toxicological impact on human health and the environment. 
It has a number of different emission sources, but motor vehicles and industrial processes contribute the major part of air pollution. 
According to the World Health Organization, six major air pollutants include particle pollution, ground‑level ozone, carbon monoxide, 
sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. Long and short term exposure to air suspended toxicants has a different toxicological impact 
on human including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, neuropsychiatric complications, the eyes irritation, skin diseases, 
and long‑term chronic diseases such as cancer. Several reports have revealed the direct association between exposure to the poor 
air quality and increasing rate of morbidity and mortality mostly due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Air pollution is 
considered as the major environmental risk factor in the incidence and progression of some diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, 
ventricular hypertrophy, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, psychological complications, autism, retinopathy, fetal growth, and 
low birth weight. In this review article, we aimed to discuss toxicology of major air pollutants, sources of emission, and their impact 
on human health. We have also proposed practical measures to reduce air pollution in Iran.

effects on human health and provide recommendations as a 
basis for environmental guidelines and standard protocols 
in the field of air pollution in Iran.
The present article is neither a systematic review nor 
a descriptive, educational study. It is a problem‑based 
descriptive review in which the authors try to explain a 
problem which is the major health and ecological problem 
in developing countries like Iran. In this review, we have 
tried to summarize the toxicology of air pollutants and 
related diseases with a possible mechanism of action and 
appropriate management of the patients. Therefore, it shall 
be useful for the environmental and health professionals 
particularly policy makers, emergency physicians, and 
other clinicians who may be involved in air pollution and 
related diseases. In this paper, we also discuss sources of 
air pollution and proposed some feasible solutions which 
may be beneficial for the environmental legislators and 
decision makers.
DEFINITIONS
Air pollution is defined as all destructive effects of any 
sources which contribute to the pollution of the atmosphere 
and/or deterioration of the ecosystem. Air pollution is 
caused by both human interventions and/or natural 
phenomena. It is made up of many kinds of pollutants 
including materials in solid, liquid, and gas phases.[18] Air 
pollutions of indoors will not be specifically considered in 
this article.
The Pollutant Standard Index (PSI) is a numerical value and 
indicator of pollutants that is normally used to facilitate risk 
assessment. It is a numeric value between zero to 500.[19] 
PSI is a guideline for reporting air quality which was first 
introduced by Thom and Ott in 1974.[20] Hence, it would 
provide a method of comparing the relative contribution of 
each pollutant to total risk.[21] The calculation of PSI is based 
on the concentration of five major air pollutants including 
particulate matters (PMs), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) in 
the air.
According to Johnson et al., “air quality index (AQI) is 
defined as a measure of the condition of air relative to 
the requirements of one or more biotic species or to any 
human need.”[22] AQI is divided into ranges, in which they 
are numbered, and each range is marked with color codes. 
It provides a number from healthy standard level of zero 
to a very hazardous level of above 300 to indicate the level 
of health risk associated with air quality. Based on PSI, air 
quality is classified into six major indices, which is marked 
by color codes and each color corresponds to a different 
level of health concerns. Principally, green is defined as a 
color indicator for healthy air quality; while yellow, orange, 
red, purple, and maroon colors indicate as moderate, 
unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy, very unhealthy, 
and hazardous air quality, respectively. These ranges and 
codes may differ in the different methods of classifications 
in different countries.[22]
TOXICOLOGY OF AIR POLLUTION
Effects of air pollutants on living organism will not only be 
limited to the human and animal health but also include 
the whole environment. Different geographical conditions, 
global climate changes, and the environmental variations 
affect the human health and the environment including 
the animal life.
Environmental damages
Ecologically, air pollution can cause serious environmental 
damages to the groundwater, soil, and air.[23,24] It is 
also a serious threat to the diversity of life. Studies on 
the relationship between air pollution and reducing 
species diversity clearly show the detrimental effects of 
environmental contaminants on the extinction of animals 
and plants species.[25] Air suspended toxicants may also 
cause reproductive effects in animals.[26,27] Acid rain, 
temperature inversion, and global climate changes due to 
the emissions of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere are 
other major ecological impacts of air pollution.[28]
Air pollutants and their toxicities
Every material in the air which could affect human 
health or have a profound impact on the environment 
is defined as air pollutants. According to the World 
Health Organization (WHO), particle pollution, 
ground‑level O3, CO, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, 
and lead (Pb) are the six major air pollutants which 
harm human health and also the ecosystem. There are 
many pollutants of suspended materials such as dust, 
fumes, smokes, mists, gaseous pollutants, hydrocarbons, 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs), and halogen derivatives in the air 
which at the high concentrations cause vulnerability to 
many diseases including different types of cancers.[29‑32] 
The most important air pollutants and their toxic effects 
on different human body organs and related diseases have 
been briefly described below.
Particle pollutants
Particle pollutants are major parts of air pollutants. In a 
simple definition, they are a mixture of particles found in the 
air. Particle pollution which is more known as PM is linked 
with most of pulmonary and cardiac‑associated morbidity 
and mortality.[33,34] They have varied in size ranging mostly 
from 2.5 to 10 μm (PM2.5 to PM10).

The size of particle pollutants is directly associated with 
the onset and progression of the lungs and heart diseases. 
Particles of smaller size reach the lower respiratory tract 
and thus have greater potential for causing the lungs and 
heart diseases. Moreover, numerous scientific data have 
demonstrated that fine particle pollutants cause premature 
death in people with heart and/or lung disease including 
cardiac dysrhythmias, nonfatal heart attacks, aggravated 
asthma, and decreased lung functions. Depending on the 
level of exposure, particulate pollutants may cause mild 
to severe illnesses. Wheezing, cough, dry mouth, and 
limitation in activities due to breathing problems are the 
most prevalent clinical symptoms of respiratory disease 
resulted from air pollution.[35‑37]
Long‑term exposure to current ambient PM concentrations 
may lead to a marked reduction in life expectancy. The 
increase of cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality 
are the main reasons for the reduction in life expectancy. 
Reduced lung functions in children and adults leading to 
asthmatic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) are also serious diseases which induce lower 
quality of life and reduced life expectancy. Strong evidence on 
the effect of long‑term exposure to PM on cardiovascular and 
cardiopulmonary mortality come from cohort studies.[38‑40]
Ground‑level ozone
O3 with the chemical formula of O3 is a colorless gas which is 
the major constituent of the atmosphere. It is found both at 
the ground level and in the upper regions of the atmosphere 
which is called troposphere. Ground‑level ozone (GLO) is 
produced as a result of chemical reaction between oxides 
of nitrogen and VOCs emitted from natural sources and/or 
due to human activities. GLO is believed to have a plausible 
association with increased risk of respiratory diseases, 
particularly asthma.[41]
As a powerful oxidant, O3 accepts electrons from other 
molecules. There is a high level of polyunsaturated fatty 
acids in the surface fluid lining of the respiratory tract 
and cell membranes that underlie the lining fluid. The 
double bonds available in these fatty acids are unstable. O3 
attacks unpaired electron to form ozonides and progress 
through an unstable zwitterion or trioxolane (depending 
on the presence of water). These ultimately recombine 
or decompose to lipohydroperoxides, aldehydes, and 
hydrogen peroxide. These pathways are thought to initiate 
propagation of lipid radicals and auto‑oxidation of cell 
membranes and macromolecules. It also increases the risk 
of DNA damage in epidermal keratinocytes, which leads 
to impaired cellular function.[42]
O3 induces a variety of toxic effects in humans and 
experimental animals at concentrations that occur in 
many urban areas.[43] These effects include morphologic, 
functional, immunologic, and biochemical alterations. 
Because of its low water solubility, a substantial portion of 
inhaled O3 penetrates deep into the lungs but its reactivity 
is scrubbed by the nasopharynx of resting rats and humans 
in around 17% and 40%, respectively.[44,45] On ecological 
aspect, O3 can reduce carbon assimilation in trees leading 
to deforestation which may affect global food security in 
long‑term exposure.[46,47]
Carbon monoxide
CO is a colorless and odorless gas, which is produced 
by fossil fuel, particularly when combustion is not 
appropriate, as in burning coal and wood. The affinity of 
CO to hemoglobin (as an oxygen carrier in the body) is 
about 250 times greater than that of oxygen. Depending on 
CO concentration and length of exposure, mild to severe 
poisoning may occur. Symptoms of CO poisoning may 
include headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, 
and finally loss of consciousness. The symptoms are very 
similar to those of other illnesses, such as food poisoning 
or viral infections.
No human health effects have been showed for 
carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels lower than 2%, while 
levels above 40% may be fatal. Hypoxia, apoptosis, and 
ischemia are known mechanisms of underlying CO 
toxicity.[48] The mechanism of such toxicity is the loss of 
oxygen due to competitive binding of CO to the hemoglobin 
heme groups. Cardiovascular changes also may be observed 
by CO exposures that create COHb in excess of 5%. In the 
early 1990s, Health Effects Institute performed a series of 
studies associated with cardiovascular disease to determine 
the potential for angina pectoris with COHb levels in the 
range of 2–6%.[49] The results showed that premature angina 
can occur under these situations but that the potential for the 
occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias remains uncertain. 
Thus, the reduction in ambient CO can reduce the risk of 
myocardial infarction in predisposed persons.
Sulfur dioxide
SO2 is a colorless, highly reactive gas, which is considered as 
an important air pollutant. It is mostly emitted from fossil 
fuel consumption, natural volcanic activities, and industrial 
processes. SO2 is very harmful for plant life, animal, and 
human health. People with lung disease, children, older 
people, and those who are more exposed to SO2 are at higher 
risk of the skin and lung diseases.
The major health concerns associated with exposure to 
high concentrations of SO2 include respiratory irritation 
and dysfunction, and also aggravation of existing 
cardiovascular disease. SO2 is predominantly absorbed 
in the upper airways. As a sensory irritant, it can cause

bronchospasm and mucus secretion in humans. Residents of 
industrialized regions encountered with SO2 even at lower 
concentrations (<1 ppm) in the polluted ambient air might 
experience a high level of bronchitis.
The penetration of SO2 into the lungs is greater during 
mouth breathing compared to nose breathing. An increase in 
the airflow in deep, rapid breathing enhances penetration of 
the gas into the deeper lung. Therefore, people who exercise 
in the polluted air would inhale more SO2 and are likely 
to suffer from greater irritation. When SO2 deposits along 
the airway, it dissolves into surface lining fluid as sulfite 
or bisulfite and is easily distributed throughout the body. 
It seems that the sulfite interacts with sensory receptors 
in the airways to cause local and centrally mediated 
bronchoconstriction.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
of the USA, the level of annual standard for SO2 is 0.03 ppm. 
Due to its solubility in water, SO2 is responsible for acid rain 
formation and acidification of soils. SO2 reduces the amount 
of oxygen in the water causing the death of marine species 
including both animals and plants. Exposure to SO2 can 
cause damages to the eyes (lacrimation and corneal opacity), 
mucous membranes, the skin (redness, and blisters), and 
respiratory tracts. Bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, 
pneumonitis, and acute airway obstruction are the most 
common clinical findings associated with exposure to SO2.[50]
Nitrogen oxide
Nitrogen oxides are important ambient air pollutants 
which may increase the risk of respiratory infections.[50] 
They are mainly emitted from motor engines and thus are 
traffic‑related air pollutants. They are deep lung irritants 
that can induce pulmonary edema if been inhaled at high 
levels. They are generally less toxic than O3, but NO2 can 
pose clear toxicological problems. Exposures at 2.0–5.0 ppm 
have been shown to affect T‑lymphocytes, particularly 
CD8+ cells and natural killer cells that play an important 
role in host defenses against viruses. Although these levels 
may be high, epidemiologic studies demonstrate effects of 
NO2 on respiratory infection rates in children.
Coughing and wheezing are the most common complication 
of nitrogen oxides toxicity, but the eyes, nose or throat 
irritations, headache, dyspnea, chest pain, diaphoresis, 
fever, bronchospasm, and pulmonary edema may also 
occur. In another report, it is suggested that the level of 
nitrogen oxide between 0.2 and 0.6 ppm is harmless for the 
human population.[51]
Lead
Pb or plumb is a toxic heavy metal that is widely used in 
different industries.[52] Pb pollution may result from both 
indoor and outdoor sources. It is emitted from motor 
engines, particularly with those using petrol containing Pb 
tetraethyl. Smelters and battery plants, as well as irrigation 
water wells and wastewaters, are other emission sources of 
the Pb into the environment.[52,53] Evaluation of the blood 
Pb level in traffic police officers shows that environmental 
pollution may be considered as a source of Pb exposure.[54] 
Fetuses and children are highly susceptible to even low 
doses of Pb.[55] Pb accumulates in the body in blood, bone, 
and soft tissue. Because it is not readily excreted, Pb can 
also affect the kidneys, liver, nervous system, and the other 
organs.[56]
Pb absorption by the lungs depends on the particle 
size and concentration. Around 90% of Pb particles in 
the ambient air that are inhaled are small enough to 
be retained. Retained Pb absorption through alveoli 
is absorbed and induces toxicity. Pb is a powerful 
neurotoxicant, especially for infants and children as the 
high‑risk groups. Mental retardation, learning disabilities, 
impairment of memory, hyperactivity, and antisocial 
behaviors are of adverse effects of Pb in childhood.[57,58] 
Therefore, it is very important to reduce the Pb level of 
ambient air.[59]
Pb exposure is often chronic, without obvious 
symptoms.[60] It can affect the different parts of the 
body including cardiovascular, renal, and reproductive 
systems, but the main target for Pb toxicity is the nervous 
system.[61] Pb disrupts the normal function of intracellular 
second messenger systems through the inhibition of 
N‑methyl‑D‑aspartate receptors. Pb may also replace 
calcium as a second messenger resulting in protein 
modification through various cellular processes including 
protein kinase activation or deactivation.
Abdominal pain, anemia, aggression, constipation, 
headaches, irritability, loss of concentration and memory, 
reduced sensations, and sleep disorders are the most 
common symptoms of Pb poisoning. Exposure to Pb is 
manifested with numerous problems, such as high blood 
pressure, infertility, digestive and renal dysfunctions, and 
muscle and joint pain.
Other air pollutants
Other major air pollutants that are classified as carcinogen 
and mutagen compounds and are thought to be responsible 
for incidence and progression of cancer in human include 
VOCs such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, 
PAHs such as acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, 
and benzopyrene, and other organic pollutants such as 
dioxins, which are unwanted chemical pollutants that 
almost totally produced by industrial processes and human 
activity.[62‑64]

In Table 1, the standard level of some conventional air 
pollutants is presented in which the values were defined as 
air quality standards that provide public welfare protection.
As it can be easily understood, fossil fuel consumption shares 
the largest part of air contamination. Air pollutants can also 
be classified into anthropogenic and natural according to 
their source of emission. From anthropogenic aspect, air 
contamination occurs from industrial and agricultural 
activities, transportation, and energy acquisition. While 
from natural contaminant has different sources of emission 
such as volcanic activities, forest fire, sea water, and so 
on.[65,66]
Health hazards
In terms of health hazards, every unusual suspended material 
in the air, which causes difficulties in normal function of 
the human organs, is defined as air toxicants. According 
to available data, the main toxic effects of exposure to air 
pollutants are mainly on the respiratory, cardiovascular, 
ophthalmologic, dermatologic, neuropsychiatric, 
hematologic, immunologic, and reproductive systems. 
However, the molecular and cell toxicity may also induce 
a variety of cancers in the long term.[67,68] On the other 
hand, even small amount of air toxicants is shown to be 
dangerous for susceptible groups including children and 
elderly people as well as patients suffering from respiratory 
and cardiovascular diseases.[69]
Respiratory disorders
Because most of the pollutants enter the body through the 
airways, the respiratory system is in the first line of battle 
in the onset and progression of diseases resulted from air 
pollutants. Depending on the dose of inhaled pollutants, 
and deposition in target cells, they cause a different level of 
damages in the respiratory system. In the upper respiratory 
tract, the first effect is irritation, especially in trachea which 
induces voice disturbances. Air pollution is also considered 
as the major environmental risk factor for some respiratory 
diseases such as asthma and lung cancer.[70,71] Air pollutants, 
especially PMs and other respirable chemicals such as dust, 
O3, and benzene cause serious damage to the respiratory 
tract.[72‑77] Asthma is a respiratory disease which may 
be developed as a result of exposure to air toxicants.[78] 
Some studies have validated associations between both 
traffic‑related and/or industrial air pollution and increasing 
the risk of COPD.[79‑81] Treatment of respiratory diseases due 
to air pollution is similar to the other toxic chemical induce 
respiratory disorders.
Cardiovascular dysfunctions
Many experimental and epidemiologic studies have 
shown the direct association of air pollutant exposure and 
cardiac‑related illnesses.[82‑85] Air pollution is also associated 
with changes in white blood cell counts[86] which also may 
affect the cardiovascular functions. On the other hand, a 
study on animal models suggested the close relationship 
between hypertension and air pollution exposure.[87] The 
traffic‑related air pollution, especially exposure to high 
levels of NO2, is associated with right and left ventricular 
hypertrophy.[88,89] In addition to the antidote therapy that 
exists only for a few cardiotoxic substances like CO, usual 
treatment of cardiovascular diseases should be carried out.
Neuropsychiatric complications
The relationship between exposure to air suspended toxic 
materials and nerve system has always been argued. 
However, it is now believed that these toxic substances have 
damaging effects on the nervous system. The toxic effect 
of air pollutants on nerve system includes neurological 
complications and psychiatric disorders. Neurological 
impairment may cause devastating consequences, 
especially in infants. In contrast, psychiatric disorders 
will induce aggression and antisocial behaviors. Recent

studies have reported the relationship between air pollution 
and neurobehavioral hyperactivity, criminal activity, 
and age‑inappropriate behaviors.[90,91] Studies have also 
revealed the association between air pollution and higher 
risk of neuroinflammation,[92] Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s 
diseases.[93] Some studies showed that aggression and 
anxiety in megacities are in close relationship with the high 
level of air pollutants.[94‑96]
Other long-term complications
Skin is the body’s first line of defense against a foreign 
pathogen or infectious agent and it is the first organ that may 
be contaminated by a pollutant. The skin is a target organ 
for pollution in which the absorption of environmental 
pollutants from this organ is equivalent to the respiratory 
uptake.[97] Research on the skin has provided evidence that 
traffic‑related air pollutants, especially PAHs, VOCs, oxides, 
and PM affect skin aging and cause pigmented spots on 
the face.[98‑100]
Theoretically, toxic air pollutants can cause damage to 
organs when inhaled or absorbed through the skin.[101] Some 
of these pollutants are hepatocarcinogen chemicals.[102,103] 
There are some proven data which highlighted the role 
of air pollutants, especially traffic‑related air pollution on 
the incidence of autism and its related disorders in fetus 
and children.[104‑107] Disrupting endocrine by chemical 
components of pollutants has been described as a possible 
mechanistic pathway of autism or other neurological 
disorders.[93,108] Some studies showed that there are 
relationships between air pollution exposure and fetal 
head size in late pregnancy,[109] fetal growth,[110] and low 
birth weight.[111,112]
Many of the diseases that are linked to immune system 
dysfunction can be affected by several environmental 
factors such as poor air quality.[113,114] Poor air quality 
can cause serious complications in the immune system 
such as an abnormal increase in the serum levels of the 
immunoglobulin (Ig); IgA, IgM, and the complement 
component C3 in humans as well as chronic inflammatory 
diseases of the respiratory system.[115] Exposure to these 
immunotoxicants may also cause immune dysfunction at 
different stages which can serve as the basis for increased 
risks of numerous diseases such as neuroinflammation, 
an altered brain innate immune response.[93,116] Air 
pollutants modify antigen presentation by up‑regulation 
of costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86 on 
macrophages.[117]
The eye is a neglected vulnerable organ to the adverse 
effects of air suspended contaminants even household 
air pollution.[118,119] Clinical effects of air pollution on the 
eyes can vary from asymptomatic eye problems to dry eye 
syndrome. Chronic exposure to air pollutants increases 
the risk for retinopathy and adverse ocular outcomes. 
In addition, there are now evidence suggesting the 
association between air pollution and irritation of the eyes, 
dry eye syndrome, and some of the major blinding.[118,120] 
According to data, the level of air pollution is linked to 
short‑term increases in the number of people visiting the 
ophthalmological emergency department.[121,122]
Air pollution in Iran
Air pollution in Iran as a developing country has 
recently caused several health and environmental 
problem. According to a report, the quality of air in Iran, 
especially in Tehran metropolis is very unhealthy and 
most of the pollution indices, specifically indices for 
CO and PM are above the standard and at sometimes 
at dangerous level.[123] Nonstandard motor engines and 
other traffic‑related sources of air pollution are the most 
important cause of poor air quality. For example, more than 
90% of the CO gas as an important air pollutant is generated 
by motor vehicles in Tehran.[124] Moreover, reports have 
shown that more than 80% of air pollution in Iran is 
attributed to motor vehicles.[125,126] Official reports show 
that in Tehran, 9.4% of the cars, 22.1% of vans, and 4.7% of 
taxis are carburetor vehicles. Around 9% of the vehicles in 
Tehran are responsible for the production of almost 400 tons 
pollutants annually.[127] Other reports demonstrated that 
cars are responsible for 80% of air pollution. Unpublished 
data show that a motorcycle produces air pollution 60 times 
more than a standard car. Based on reports, annual average 
of air toxicants including PM 10, SO2, NO2 and O3 in Tehran 
capital city of Iran with around 8.3 million inhabitants 
were 90.58, 89.16, 85, and 68.82 μg/m3, respectively. These 
values are more than standards defined by EPA and WHO. 
Therefore, as expected, air pollution is the main casualty of 
excess 2194 out of total 47284 deaths in a year. According 
to a recent report, SO2, NO2, and O3, respectively, have 
caused about additional 1458, 1050, and 819 cases of total 
mortality in 2011.[128] According to an official report in 2013, 
air pollution leaves almost 4,460 deaths annually only in 
Tehran.[129]
Reports of the World Bank in 2005 show that mortality due 
to urban air pollution in Iran has led to about 640 million 
dollars annual losses which contribute to 0.57% of the gross 
domestic product.[130] Another report has also shown that 
Iran is the world’s third main polluted country in the world, 
which results in 16 billion $ annual loss for the country.[16] 
Many regulatory programs including planting projects have 
been developed to reduce urban air pollution in Iran, but 
due to lack of enough stewardship and standardization of 
new technologies including those related to car engines and 
also nonstandard energy production, no significant output 
has been obtained so far.[17]

Practical measures to reduce air pollution in Iran
The industrialization of societies is necessary to develop, 
but a long‑term health problem and ecological impacts of 
such growth should always be considered prior to imposing 
a large financial burden on the societies. Therefore, 
it is suggested to adopt a balance between economic 
development and air pollution by legislating policies to 
control all activities resulting in air pollution.[131‑133] There 
are some temporary but not trustworthy strategies to reduce 
air pollution in Iran. For example, increasing the price of 
fuels, planting trees around and inside the city, replacing 
old cars with modern ones, and increasing road taxes and 
car insurance may reduce the amount of air pollutants, 
but in order to keep the constancy or even optimization, 
these strategies should be continued. The most air‑polluted 
capital cities of Asia are Delhi and Tehran.[134] Causes of 
air pollutions including cheap and low quality of vehicle’s 
fuel particularly gas oil, nonstandard motor engines, 
inappropriate public transport, overuse of fossil fuel, lack 
of public awareness and transparency, legislation, and 
cooperation between different departments and green 
societies are similar in the two cities. Therefore, urgent 
and concerted actions at national and international levels 
are required.
Some mega capital cities in the other countries like London 
and Tokyo have controlled their air pollutions over the 
years following appropriate legislations and strict controls, 
whereas moving the capital cities in India and Pakistan in 
the last century have not solved the problem of air pollution 
in the long term in these countries. Therefore, moving 
capital city will not solve the problem of air pollution 
and only reduces the problem in the short term. Some 
recommended strategies to reduce the air pollution in Iran 
are summarized as the followings:
• Standardization of vehicle’s fuel as much as possible and 
also finding a new source of energy for motor engines 
has attracted great attention. A great part of emission 
comes from vehicle exhaust, especially those which use 
diesel and gasoline. Using other clean source of energy 
such as compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural 
gas (LNG), and alcohol is of great interests. Hence, 
exhorting researchers and also companies in the era of 
interest to find a way for replacing petrol and other fossil 
fuels with new suitable power generation sources will 
be beneficial.[135,136] Expanded of more CNG and LNG 
stations in big cities of Iran and producing more vehicles 
using CNG and LNG are recommended
• Standardization of motor engines and manufacturing 
engines with low fuel consumption is another strategy to 
reduce the level of air pollutants. Surely, motor vehicles 
will not use fossil fuel and derivatives anymore in the 
near future. Recently, some car makers in Japan and 
Western countries have made electrical cars that use 
electricity from a battery storage for low speeds which 
is usually enough for driving inside the cities with traffic 
and/or controlled speeds. Hence, designing new motor 
engines, companies of interests should look forward.[137] 
This might be implemented in Iran in the future
• Improving public transportation systems by using 
more subways (metro), trams, and electrical bus 
routes. Reducing the costs for the people who are 
using such systems is an optimal solution for lowering 
air pollution.[14] The people and governments will 
gain profits from reducing air contaminations in the 
long term, both economically and in cases of health 
issues.[138‑140] At the present, there are only limited 
metro lines in Tehran, Mashhad, and Esfahan. It is 
recommended to expand the metro lines in these cities. 
Trams and electrical buses have unfortunately not been 
established in Iran. They should be implemented soon 
in big cities of Iran
• Increasing the cost of fuel in Iran can be considered 
as an effective solution to reduce the proportion of air 
contaminants. According to the report by Barnett and 
Knibbs, higher fuel price is associated with lower air 
pollution level[141]
• Imposing penalties for polluting industries and 
implementing low tax policy for clean technologies. 
Applying more taxes on automobiles in Iran, particularly 
on those older than 20 years to distinguish between dirty 
and clean vehicles. The government should establish 
exhorting plans for car makers and other producers 
who adhere to environmental standards. Moreover, 
exhorting plans should be designed for all sources of 
emissions. These plans may contain discount on taxes 
or other financial supports for customers and producers
• Since the phenomenon of air pollution was a global 
issue over the centuries since the industrial revolution, 
it is proposed to establish an interdisciplinary academic 
field on air pollution. It is also suggested that more 
communication and collaboration between specialists in 
different sciences including toxicology, environmental 
health, analytical chemistry, mechanics, and applied 
physics will be performed
• Continuous monitoring of air quality, designing and 
developing tools to identify the pollutants, finding the 
origin of the particles, and the use of particulate filter 
for diesel engines and other nonroad cars are other 
suggested practical approaches to reduce air pollution
• Extensive media campaign to increase public awareness 
about air quality, environmental, and public health 
issues.
Inadequate legislation and also a lack of appropriate 
policies in Iran result in higher levels of environmental 
pollution and its impact on the incidence of diseases, 
which will undeniably impose a heavy financial burden

on the community. Increasing risk of diseases due to air 
contamination has necessitated defining the standard values 
for air quality and also a normal range for pollutants and 
daily control of air pollution. Thus, monitoring air quality 
plays an important role in developing regulatory policies.[142] 
These should be implemented in all big cities of Iran.
Regulatory programs should apply high taxes per unit 
of emission not only as a penalty for air polluters but 
also should give rise to the cost of pollution for them in 
order to ensure the efficient reduction of pollutants. Final 
achievement is to reduce the pollution and not only paying 
the cost of damages by polluters.[143]
Advantages and breakpoints of these strategies should 
be carefully documented. Tax on vehicles is the most 
controversial issue in controlling and management of air 
pollution. It would be helpful providing all necessary 
facilities including subway, and other transportation 
systems prior to applying penalties. In other word, taxes 
should be applied, but public transportation systems should 
be improved, and also its cost should be reasonable enough.
It is important to balance between all suggested strategies, 
and discuss all aspects of each plan. Each of these controlling 
policies has an impact on each other and also on the 
society. Ideally, an optimum solution for the problem of air 
pollution is that in which no additional problem resulted 
from controlling policies impose on the society. Therefore, 
a suitable controlling policy should contain penalties for 
each unit of air pollutants’ emission. The sources of emission 
vary from small unit of cigarettes to large volume of 
emission from motor engines of automobiles and industrial 
activities.[144]
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Air pollutions have major impacts on human health, 
triggering, and inducing many diseases leading to high 
morbidities and mortalities, particularly in the developing 
countries such as Iran. Therefore, air pollutions control 
is vital and should be on the top of priority list of the 
governments. The policy makers and legislators in these 
countries must update all laws and regulations related to 
air pollutions. Coordination between different departments 
involving in air pollutions must be leaded by a powerful 
environmental protection organization. An effective 
environmental protection organization should have 
enough budgets for administration, research, development, 
monitoring, and full control of the environment including 
air pollution.
