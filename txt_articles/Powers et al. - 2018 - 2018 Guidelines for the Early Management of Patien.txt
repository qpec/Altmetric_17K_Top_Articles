Background and Purpose—The purpose of these guidelines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of recommendations 
for clinicians caring for adult patients with acute arterial ischemic stroke in a single document. The intended audiences 
are prehospital care providers, physicians, allied health professionals, and hospital administrators. These guidelines 
supersede the 2013 guidelines and subsequent updates.
Methods—Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association Stroke Council’s Scientific 
Statements Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Strict adherence to the American 
Heart Association conflict of interest policy was maintained. Members were not allowed to participate in discussions or 
to vote on topics relevant to their relations with industry. The members of the writing group unanimously approved all 
recommendations except when relations with industry precluded members voting. Prerelease review of the draft guideline 
was performed by 4 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council’s Scientific Statements Oversight

N
ew high-quality evidence has produced major changes 
in the evidence-based treatment of patients with acute 
ischemic stroke (AIS) since the publication of the most 
recent “Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients 
With Acute Ischemic Stroke” in 2013.1 Much of this new 
evidence has been incorporated into American Heart 
Association (AHA) focused updates, guidelines, or scientific 
statements on specific topics relating to the management of 
patients with AIS since 2013. The purpose of these guide-
lines is to provide an up-to-date comprehensive set of rec-
ommendations for clinicians caring for adult patients with 
acute arterial ischemic stroke in a single document. These 
guidelines address prehospital care, urgent and emergency 
evaluation and treatment with intravenous (IV) and intra-
arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including 
secondary prevention measures that are often begun during 
the initial hospitalization. We have restricted our recommen-
dations to adults and to secondary prevention measures that 
are appropriately instituted within the first 2 weeks. We have 
not included recommendations for cerebral venous sinus 
thrombosis because they were covered in a 2011 scientific 
statement and there is no new evidence that would change 
those conclusions.2
An independent evidence review committee was commis-
sioned to perform a systematic review of a limited number of 
clinical questions identified in conjunction with the writing 
group, the results of which were considered by the writing 
group for incorporation into this guideline. The systematic 
reviews “Accuracy of Prediction Instruments for Diagnosing 
Large Vessel Occlusion in Individuals With Suspected 
Stroke: A Systematic Review for the 2018 Guidelines for the 
Early Management of Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke”3 
and “Effect of Dysphagia Screening Strategies on Clinical 
Outcomes After Stroke: A Systematic Review for the 2018 
Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients With Acute 
Ischemic Stroke”4 are published in conjunction with this 
guideline.
These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology 
(ACC)/AHA 2015 Class of Recommendations (COR) and 
Levels of Evidence (LOE) (Table 1) and the new AHA guide-
lines format. New or revised recommendations that supersede 
previous guideline recommendations are accompanied by 
250-word knowledge bytes and data supplement tables sum-
marizing the key studies supporting the recommendations in 
place of extensive text. Existing recommendations that are 
unchanged are reiterated with reference to the previous pub-
lication. These previous publications and their abbreviations 
used in this document are listed in Table 2. When there is no 
new pertinent evidence, for these unchanged recommenda-
tions, no knowledge byte or data supplement is provided. For 
some unchanged recommendations, there are new pertinent 
data that support the existing recommendation, and these are 
provided. Additional abbreviations used in this guideline are 
listed in Table 3.
Members of the writing group were appointed by the AHA 
Stroke Council’s Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, 
representing various areas of medical expertise. Strict adher-
ence to the AHA conflict of interest policy was maintained 
throughout the writing and consensus process. Members were 
not allowed to participate in discussions or to vote on topics 
relevant to their relationships with industry. Writing group 
members accepted topics relevant to their areas of expertise, 
reviewed the stroke literature with emphasis on publications 
since the prior guidelines, and drafted recommendations. Draft 
recommendations and supporting evidence were discussed by 
the writing group, and the revised recommendations for each 
topic were reviewed by a designated writing group member. 
The full writing group then evaluated the complete guidelines. 
The members of the writing group unanimously approved all 
recommendations except when relationships with industry pre-
cluded members voting. Prerelease review of the draft guideline 
was performed by 4 expert peer reviewers and by the mem-
bers of the Stroke Council’s Scientific Statements Oversight 
Committee and Stroke Council Leadership Committee.
Committee and Stroke Council Leadership Committee. These guidelines use the American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association 2015 Class of Recommendations and Levels of Evidence and the new American Heart 
Association guidelines format.
Results—These guidelines detail prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation and treatment with intravenous and 
intra-arterial therapies, and in-hospital management, including secondary prevention measures that are appropriately 
instituted within the first 2 weeks. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care in both the 
prehospital and hospital settings.
Conclusions—These guidelines are based on the best evidence currently available. In many instances, however, 
only limited data exist demonstrating the urgent need for continued research on treatment of acute ischemic 
stroke. (Stroke. 2018;49:e46–e99. DOI: 10.1161/STR.0000000000000158.)

1.1. Prehospital Systems
COR
LOE
New, Revised, or Unchanged
1.  
Public health leaders, along with medical professionals and others, 
should design and implement public education programs focused on 
stroke systems and the need to seek emergency care (by calling 9-1-1) 
in a rapid manner. These programs should be sustained over time and 
designed to reach racially/ethnically, age, and sex diverse populations.
I
B-R
Recommendation revised from 2013 Stroke 
Systems of Care. COR and LOE added.
Early stroke symptom recognition is essential for seeking timely care. Unfortunately, knowledge of stroke 
warning signs and risk factors in the United States remains poor. Blacks and Hispanics particularly have 
lower stroke awareness than the general population and are at increased risk of prehospital delays in seeking 
care.17 These factors may contribute to the disparities in stroke outcomes. Available evidence suggests that 
public awareness interventions are variably effective by age, sex, and racial/ethnic minority status.18 Thus, 
stroke education campaigns should be designed in a targeted manner to optimize their effectiveness.18
See Tables I and II in online Data Supplement 1.
2.  
Activation of the 9-1-1 system by patients or other members of the 
public is strongly recommended. 9-1-1 dispatchers should make 
stroke a priority dispatch, and transport times should be minimized.
I
B-NR
Recommendation and Class unchanged 
from 2013 AIS Guidelines. LOE amended 
to conform with ACC/AHA 2015 
Recommendation Classification System.
Emergency medical services (EMS) use by stroke patients has been independently associated with earlier 
emergency department (ED) arrival (onset-to-door time ≤3 hours; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.00; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.93–2.08), quicker ED evaluation (more patients with door-to-imaging time ≤25 
minutes; OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.78–2.00), more rapid treatment (more patients with door-to-needle [DTN] time 
≤60 minutes; OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.28–1.63), and more eligible patients being treated with alteplase if onset is 
≤2 hours (67% versus 44%; OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.33–1.64),18 yet only ≈60% of all stroke patients use EMS.19 
Men, blacks, and Hispanics are less likely to use EMS.17,19 Thus, persistent efforts to ensure activation of the 
9-1-1 or similar emergency system by patients or other members of the public in the case of a suspected stroke 
are warranted.
See Table I in online Data Supplement 1.
3.  
To increase both the number of patients who are treated and the 
quality of care, educational stroke programs for physicians, hospital 
personnel, and EMS personnel are recommended.
I
B-NR
Recommendation and Class unchanged 
from 2013 AIS Guidelines. LOE amended 
to conform with ACC/AHA 2015 
Recommendation Classification System.
On 9-1-1 activation, EMS dispatch and clinical personnel should prioritize the potential stroke case, minimize 
on-scene times, and transport the patient as quickly as possible to the most appropriate hospital. A recent 
US-based analysis of EMS response times found that median EMS response time (9-1-1 call to ED arrival) in 
184 179 cases in which EMS provider impression was stroke was 36 minutes (interquartile range, 28.7–48.0 
minutes).20 On-scene time (median, 15 minutes) was the largest component of this time, and longer times were 
noted for patients 65 to 74 years of age, whites, and women and in nonurban areas. Dispatch designation of 
stroke was associated with minimally faster response times (36.0 versus 36.7 minutes; P<0.01). Notably, only 
52% of cases were identified by dispatch as stroke.
See Table I in online Data Supplement 1.
1.2. EMS Assessment and Management

New, Revised, or Unchanged
1.  
The use of a stroke assessment system by first aid providers, 
including EMS dispatch personnel, is recommended.
I
B-NR
Recommendation reworded for clarity from 
2015 CPR/ECC. Class and LOE unchanged.
See Table LXXXIII in online Data Supplement 1

2.  
EMS personnel should begin the initial management of stroke in 
the field. Implementation of a stroke protocol to be used by EMS 
personnel is strongly encouraged.
I
B-NR
Recommendation revised from 2013 AIS 
Guidelines.
In 1 study, the positive predictive value for a hospital discharge diagnosis of stroke/transient ischemic attack 
(TIA) among 900 cases for which EMS dispatch suspected stroke was 51% (95% CI, 47–54), and the positive 
predictive value for ambulance personnel impression of stroke was 58% (95% CI, 52–64).21 In another study of 
21 760 dispatches for stroke, the positive predictive value of the dispatch stroke/TIA symptoms identification 
was 34.3% (95% CI, 33.7–35.0), and the sensitivity was 64.0% (95% CI, 63.0–64.9).22 In both cases, use of a 
prehospital stroke scale improved stroke identification, but better stroke identification tools are needed in the 
prehospital setting.

EMS leaders, in coordination with local, regional, and state agencies 
and in consultation with medical authorities and local experts, should 
develop triage paradigms and protocols to ensure that patients with a 
known or suspected stroke are rapidly identified and assessed by use 
of a validated and standardized instrument for stroke screening, such 
as the FAST (face, arm, speech test) scale, Los Angeles Prehospital 
Stroke Screen, or Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale.

See Table IV in online Data Supplement 1.
2.  
Regional systems of stroke care should be developed. These should 
consist of the following: (a) Healthcare facilities that provide initial 
emergency care, including administration of IV alteplase, and, (b) 
Centers capable of performing endovascular stroke treatment with 
comprehensive periprocedural care to which rapid transport can be 
arranged when appropriate.

Patients with a positive stroke screen and/or a strong suspicion 
of stroke should be transported rapidly to the closest healthcare 
facilities that can capably administer IV alteplase.
I
B-NR
Recommendation reworded for clarity from 
2013 AIS Guidelines.
See Table LXXXIII in online Data Supplement 1

The 2013 recommendation referred to initial emergency care as described elsewhere in the guidelines, which 
specified administration of IV alteplase as part of this care. The current recommendation is unchanged in intent 
but reworded to make this clear.
 
3.  
EMS personnel should provide prehospital notification to the 
receiving hospital that a suspected stroke patient is en route so 
that the appropriate hospital resources may be mobilized before 
patient arrival.
I
B-NR
Recommendation reworded for clarity from 
2013 AIS Guidelines. Class unchanged. LOE

See Table LXXXIII in online Data Supplement 1 
for original wording.
In the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG) registry, EMS personnel provided prearrival notification to the destination ED 
for 67% of transported stroke patients. EMS prenotification was associated with increased likelihood of alteplase 
treatment within 3 hours (82.8% versus 79.2%), shorter door-to-imaging times (26 versus 31 minutes), shorter 
DTN times (78 versus 80 minutes), and shorter symptom onset-to-needle times (141 versus 145 minutes).23

It is recommended that DTN time goals be established. A primary 
goal of achieving DTN times within 60 minutes in ≥50% of AIS 
patients treated with IV alteplase should be established.
I
B-NR
Recommendation revised from 2013 AIS 
Guidelines.
In GWTG-Stroke hospitals, median DTN time for alteplase administration decreased from 77 minutes (interquartile 
range, 60–98 minutes) during the 2003 to 2009 preintervention period to 67 minutes (interquartile range, 
51–87 minutes) during the 2010 to 2013 postintervention period (P<0.001). The percentage of alteplase-treated 
patients having DTN times of ≤60 minutes increased from 26.5% (95% CI, 26.0–27.1) to 41.3% (95% CI, 
40.8–41.7) (P<0.001). Comparing the quarter immediately before the intervention (quarter 4 of 2009) to the final 
postintervention quarter (quarter 3 of 2013) showed that DTN times of ≤60 minutes increased from 29.6% (95% 
CI, 27.8–31.5) to 53.3% (95% CI, 51.5–55.2) (P<0.001).35 In a subsequent study evaluating a cohort of hospitals 
from 2014 to 2015, 59.3% of patients received IV alteplase within a DTN time of 60 minutes.36
See Table VII in online Data Supplement 1.
3.  
It may be reasonable to establish a secondary DTN time goal of 
achieving DTN times within 45 minutes in ≥50% of patients with 
AIS who were treated with IV alteplase.
IIb
C-EO
New recommendation.
In a cohort of 888 GWTG-Stroke hospitals surveyed between June 2014 and April 2015, 16 901 patients with 
ischemic stroke were treated with IV alteplase within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The patient-level median DTN 
time was 56 minutes (interquartile range, 42–75 minutes), with 30.4% treated within 45 minutes after hospital 
arrival.36 This recommendation mirrors Target: Stroke phase II objectives.37
See Table VII in online Data Supplement 1.
4.  
Designation of an acute stroke team that includes physicians, 
nurses, and laboratory/radiology personnel is recommended. 
Patients with stroke should have a careful clinical assessment, 
including neurological examination.
I
B-NR
Recommendation wording modified from 2013 AIS 
Guidelines to match Class I stratifications. Class 
unchanged. LOE added to conform with ACC/AHA 
2015 Recommendation Classification System.
5.  
Multicomponent quality improvement initiatives, which include ED 
education and multidisciplinary teams with access to neurological 
expertise, are recommended to safely increase IV thrombolytic treatment.
I
A
New recommendation.
Multicomponent quality improvement programs to improve stroke care have demonstrated utility in safely increasing 
alteplase use in the community hospital setting. The US cluster-randomized INSTINCT trial (Increasing Stroke 
Treatment Through Interventional Change Tactics) demonstrated increased rates of alteplase use among all stroke 
patients. In the intervention group hospitals, alteplase use increased from 59 of 5882 (1.00%) before intervention to 
191 of 7288 (2.62%) after intervention. This compared favorably with the change in the control group hospitals from 
65 of 5957 (1.09%) to 120 of 6989 (1.72%), with a relative risk (RR) of 1.68 (95% CI, 1.09–2.57; P=0.02). Safety 
was also demonstrated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (within 36 hours) in 24 of 404 (5.9%) treated 
strokes.38 In the PRACTISE trial (Penumbra and Recanalisation Acute Computed Tomography in Ischaemic Stroke 
Evaluation), a multilevel intervention was conducted in a sample of 12 Dutch hospitals. After implementation of an 
intensive stroke treatment strategy, intervention hospitals treated 393 patients with IV thrombolysis (13.1% of all 
patients with acute stroke) versus 308 (12.2%) at control hospitals (adjusted OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.93–1.68).39

Studies of teleradiology to read brain imaging in acute stroke have successfully assessed feasibility; agreement 
between telestroke neurologists, radiologists, and neuroradiologists over the presence or absence of radiological 
contraindications to IV alteplase; and reliability of telestroke radiological evaluations.40–45

The STRokEDOC (Stroke Team Remote Evaluation Using a Digital Observation Camera) pooled analysis supported 
the hypothesis that telemedicine consultations, which included teleradiology, compared with telephone-only 
resulted in statistically significantly more accurate IV alteplase eligibility decision making for patients exhibiting 
symptoms and signs of an acute stroke syndrome in EDs.46
See Table XI in online Data Supplement 1.
5.  
Administration of IV alteplase guided by telestroke consultation for 
patients with AIS may be as safe and as beneficial as that of stroke 
centers.
IIb
B-NR
New recommendation.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV alteplase 
delivered through telestroke networks in patients with AIS. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) rates 
were similar between patients subjected to telemedicine-guided IV alteplase and those receiving IV alteplase 
at stroke centers. There was no difference in mortality or in functional independence at 3 months between 
telestroke-guided and stroke center–managed patients. The findings indicate that IV alteplase delivery through 
telestroke networks is safe and effective in the 3-hour time window.47
See Table XII in online Data Supplement 1.
6.  
Providing alteplase decision-making support via telephone 
consultation to community physicians is feasible and safe and may 
be considered when a hospital has access to neither an in-person 
stroke team nor a telestroke system.
IIb
C-LD
New recommendation.
The advantages of telephone consultations for patients with acute stroke syndromes are feasibility, history of 
use, simplicity, availability, portability, short consultation time, and facile implementation.48
See Table XIII in online Data Supplement 1.
7.  
Telestroke networks may be reasonable for triaging patients with 
AIS who may be eligible for interfacility transfer in order to be 
considered for acute mechanical thrombectomy.
IIb
B-NR
New recommendation.
An observational study compared clinical outcomes of endovascular treatment (EVT) between patients with 
anterior circulation stroke transferred after teleconsultation and those directly admitted to a tertiary stroke 
center. The study evaluated 151 patients who underwent emergency EVT for anterior circulation stroke. Of 
these, 48 patients (31.8%) were transferred after teleconsultation, and 103 (68.2%) were admitted primarily 
through an ED. Transferred patients were younger, received IV alteplase more frequently, had prolonged 
time from stroke onset to EVT initiation, and tended to have lower rates of symptomatic intracranial 
hemorrhage and mortality than directly admitted patients. Similar rates of reperfusion and favorable 
functional outcomes were observed in patients treated by telestroke and those who were directly admitted. 
Telestroke networks may enable the triage and the delivery of EVT to selected ischemic stroke patients 
transferred from remote hospitals.49

Between 2006 and 2010, the proportion of ischemic strokes undergoing computed tomography (CT) angiography 
(CTA) increased from 3.8% to 9.1% (P<0.0001). CT perfusion (CTP) increased from 0.05% to 2.9% over the 
same period (P<0.0001). Reperfusion treatment was more common among those who were imaged with CTA 
(13.0%) and CTP (17.6%) compared with those with CT of the head alone (4.0%; P<0.0001).50 However, when 
considering implementation of multimodal CT imaging at small or remote access hospitals, resource availability

IIb
C-EO
Recommendation revised from 2013 Stroke 
Systems of Care.
Multiple studies evaluating fibrinolytic therapy and mechanical thrombectomy, alone or in combination, 
have demonstrated substantial cost-effectiveness of acute stroke treatment across multiple countries. Pre–
mechanical thrombectomy era data demonstrate that, in the United States, cost savings of approximately US $30 
million would be realized if the proportion of all ischemic stroke patients receiving thrombolysis was increased to 
8%. This excludes any gain from increased quality-adjusted life-years gained, a source of tremendous additional 
economic and patient value. Before the implementation of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services diagnosis-
related group 559 payment in 2005, treatment of acute stroke was economically discouraged at a hospital 
level because of a high hospital cost-reimbursement ratio. Diagnosis-related group 559 favorably altered the 
cost-reimbursement ratio for stroke care. In a single-hospital study, this ratio decreased from 1.41 (95% CI, 
0.98–2.28) before diagnosis-related group 559 to 0.82 (95% CI, 0.66–0.97) after diagnosis-related group 559. 
The subsequent years corresponded to a period of rapid growth in the number of primary stroke centers and 
increasing total stroke treatment cases. Addressing emerging economic barriers to treatment is important as 
acute stroke care complexity evolves.51–56

1.  
All patients admitted to hospital with suspected acute stroke 
should receive brain imaging evaluation on arrival to hospital. In 
most cases, noncontrast CT (NCCT) will provide the necessary 
information to make decisions about acute management.
I
B-NR
Recommendation revised from 2013 AIS 
Guidelines.
Diagnostic testing is most cost-effective when it leads to a change in treatment that improves outcomes, not just 
a change in treatment. Although diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is more sensitive than 
CT for detecting AIS,66,67 routine use in all patients with AIS is not cost-effective.68,69 NCCT scanning of all patients 
with acute stroke has been shown to be cost-effective primarily because of the detection of acute ICH and the 
avoidance of antithrombotic treatment in these patients.70 In many patients, the diagnosis of ischemic stroke can be 
made accurately on the basis of the clinical presentation and either a negative NCCT or one showing early ischemic 
changes, which can be detected in the majority of patients with careful attention.66,71,72 In some patients with negative 
NCCT such as those with puzzling clinical presentations or those with uncertain clinical stroke localization for early 
carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or stenting, demonstration of an area of restricted diffusion on DW-MRI may lead to a 
change in treatment that improves outcomes. There are inadequate data at this time to establish which patients will 
benefit from DW-MRI, and more research is needed to determine criteria for its cost-effective use.
See Table XV in online Data Supplement 1.
2.  
Systems should be established so that brain imaging studies can be 
performed within 20 minutes of arrival in the ED in at least 50% of 
patients who may be candidates for IV alteplase and/or mechanical 
thrombectomy.
I
B-NR
New recommendation.
The benefit of both IV alteplase and mechanical thrombectomy is time dependent, with earlier treatment within the 
therapeutic window leading to bigger proportional benefits.32,73 A brain imaging study to exclude ICH is recommended as 
part of the initial evaluation of patients who are potentially eligible for these therapies. Reducing the time interval from ED 
presentation to initial brain imaging can help to reduce the time to treatment initiation. Studies have shown that median 
or mean door-to-imaging times of ≤20 minutes can be achieved in a variety of different hospital settings.74–76
See Table XVI in online Data Supplement 1.
3.  
There remains insufficient evidence to identify a threshold of acute 
CT hypoattenuation severity or extent that affects treatment response 
to IV alteplase. The extent and severity of acute hypoattenuation or 
early ischemic changes should not be used as a criterion to withhold 
therapy for such patients who otherwise qualify.
III: No Benefit
B-R
Recommendation revised from 2015 IV 
Alteplase.
Analysis of data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of IV alteplase for AIS has shown no statistically significant 
deleterious interaction on clinical outcomes between alteplase treatment and baseline CT hypodensity or  
hypoattenuation.77–81 In the National Institute of Neurological Disorders (NINDS) rtPA (recombinant tissue-type 
plasminogen activator) trial, subsequent analysis showed there was no significant modification of the effect of alteplase 
by the following findings on baseline CT: early ischemic changes (loss of gray/white matter distinction, hypoattenuation, 
or compression of cerebrospinal fluid spaces), the Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score 
(ASPECTS), or the Van Swieten score for leukoaraiosis.78 In both ECASS (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study) II and 
IST (International Stroke Trial)-3, there was no interaction with baseline ASPECTS.77,79 A meta-analysis of NINDS rtPA, 
ECASS II, PROACT (Intra-Arterial Prourokinase for Acute Ischemic Stroke) II, and IST-3 showed no significant interactions 
for IV alteplase with functional outcomes for ASPECTS subgroups.77 A pooled analysis of NINDS rtPA, ECASS I, ECASS II, 
and IST-3 showed no significant interaction between baseline CT leukoaraiosis and the effect of IV alteplase.82 
Patients with baseline CT hypoattenuation of greater than one third of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory 
were excluded from both ECASS I and ECASS II but not from NINDS rtPA and IST-3.
See Table XVII in online Data Supplement 1.
4.  
The CT hyperdense MCA sign should not be used as a criterion to 
withhold IV alteplase from patients who otherwise qualify.
III: No Benefit
B-R
New recommendation.
Analyses of data from RCTs of IV alteplase for AIS have shown no statistically significant deleterious interaction on 
clinical outcomes between alteplase treatment and the hyperdense MCA sign on baseline CT. In the NINDS rtPA 
trial, there was no interaction between hyperdense MCA sign and treatment for outcomes at 3 months measured by 
any of the 4 clinical scales (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0–1, NIHSS score 0–1, Barthel Index ≥95, Glasgow 
Outcome Scale score 0–1) or for death.83 In IST-3, no significant interaction of the hyperdense MCA sign with 
benefit of alteplase measured by the Oxford Handicap Score at 6 months was observed.77,84
See Table XVIII in online Data Supplement 1.
5.  
Routine use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to exclude 
cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) before administration of IV alteplase 
is not recommended.
III: No Benefit
B-NR
New recommendation.
No RCTs of IV alteplase in AIS with baseline MRI to identify CMBs have been conducted, so no determination 
of the effect of baseline CMB on the treatment effect of alteplase with CMB is available. Two meta-analyses of 
the association of baseline CMBs on the risk of sICH after IV alteplase have shown that sICH is more common 
in patients with baseline CMBs (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.12–4.22; OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.21–4.61).85,86 However, sICH 
in patients with baseline CMBs is not more common (6.1%, 6.5%)85,86 than in the NINDS rtPA trial (6.4%).87 One 
meta-analysis reported that the sICH rate was 40% in patients with >10 CMBs, but this was based on only 6 
events in 15 patients, and patients with >10 CMBs constituted only 0.8% of the sample.86

efficacy in patients with various pretreatment imaging biomarkers compared with those without those markers.88–95
See Table XX and XXI in online Data 
Supplement 1.
8.  
For patients who otherwise meet criteria for EVT, a noninvasive 
intracranial vascular study is recommended during the initial 
imaging evaluation of the acute stroke patient, but should not delay 
IV alteplase if indicated. For patients who qualify for IV alteplase 
according to guidelines from professional medical societies, initiating 
IV alteplase before noninvasive vascular imaging is recommended for 
patients who have not had noninvasive vascular imaging as part of 
their initial imaging assessment for stroke. Noninvasive intracranial 
vascular imaging should then be obtained as quickly as possible.

Recommendation reworded for clarity 
from 2015 Endovascular. Class and LOE

See Table LXXXIII in online Data Supplement 1 
for original wording.
A recent systematic review evaluated the accuracy of prediction instruments for diagnosing LVO.3 In the setting where 
confirmed ischemic stroke patients would be assessed by a neurologist or emergency physician in the ED, the authors 
suggested that the NIHSS is the best of the LVO prediction instruments. According to their meta-analysis, a threshold of 
≥10 would provide the optimal balance between sensitivity (73%) and specificity (74%). To maximize sensitivity (at the 
cost of lower specificity), a threshold of ≥6 would have 87% sensitivity and 52% specificity. However, even this low 
threshold misses some cases with LVO, whereas the low specificity indicates that false-positives will be common.
 
9.  
For patients who otherwise meet criteria for EVT, it is reasonable 
to proceed with CTA if indicated in patients with suspected 
intracranial LVO before obtaining a serum creatinine concentration 
in patients without a history of renal impairment.
IIa
B-NR
New recommendation.
Analyses from a number of observational studies suggest that the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy secondary 
to CTA imaging is relatively low, particularly in patients without a history of renal impairment. Moreover, waiting 
for these laboratory results may lead to delays in mechanical thrombectomy.96–101
See Table XXII in online Data Supplement 1.
10.  
In patients who are potential candidates for mechanical thrombectomy, 
imaging of the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries, in addition to 
the intracranial circulation, is reasonable to provide useful information 
on patient eligibility and endovascular procedural planning.
IIa
C-EO
New recommendation.
Knowledge of vessel anatomy and presence of extracranial vessel dissections, stenoses, and occlusions may 
assist in planning endovascular procedures or identifying patients ineligible for treatment because of vessel 
tortuosity or inability to access the intracranial vasculature.
 
12.  
In selected patients with AIS within 6 to 24 hours of last known 
normal who have LVO in the anterior circulation, obtaining CTP
, 
DW-MRI, or MRI perfusion is recommended to aid in patient 
selection for mechanical thrombectomy, but only when imaging 
and other eligibility criteria from RCTs showing benefit are being 
strictly applied in selecting patients for mechanical thrombectomy.
I
A
New recommendation.
The DAWN trial (Clinical Mismatch in the Triage of Wake Up and Late Presenting Strokes Undergoing 
Neurointervention With Trevo) used clinical imaging mismatch (a combination of NIHSS and imaging findings on 
CTP or DW-MRI) as an eligibility criterion to select patients with large anterior circulation vessel occlusion for 
mechanical thrombectomy between 6 and 24 hours from last known normal. This trial demonstrated an overall 
benefit in functional outcome at 90 days in the treatment group (mRS score 0–2, 49% versus 13%; adjusted 
difference, 33%; 95% CI, 21–44; posterior probability of superiority >0.999).108 The DEFUSE 3 trial (Diffusion and 
Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution) used perfusion-core mismatch and maximum 
core size as imaging criteria to select patients with large anterior circulation occlusion 6 to 16 hours from last 
seen well for mechanical thrombectomy. This trial showed a benefit in functional outcome at 90 days in the 
treated group (mRS score 0–2, 44.6% versus 16.7%; RR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.60–4.48; P<0.0001).109 Benefit was 
independently demonstrated for the subgroup of patients who met DAWN eligibility criteria and for the subgroup 
who did not. DAWN and DEFUSE 3 are the only RCTs showing benefit of mechanical thrombectomy >6 hours 
from onset. Therefore, only the eligibility criteria from one or the other of these trials should be used for patient 
selection. Although future RCTs may demonstrate that additional eligibility criteria can be used to select patients 
who benefit from mechanical thrombectomy, at this time, the DAWN or DEFUSE 3 eligibility should be strictly 
adhered to in clinical practice.

The limited data available on the utility of HBO therapy for AIS (not related to cerebral air embolism) show no 
benefit.114 HBO therapy is associated with claustrophobia and middle ear barotrauma,115 as well as an increased 
risk of seizures.116 Given the confines of HBO chambers, the ability to closely/adequately monitor patients may 
also be compromised. HBO thus should be offered only in the context of a clinical trial or to individuals with 
cerebral air embolism.

New recommendation.
The blood pressure (BP) level that should be maintained in patients with AIS to ensure best outcome is 
not known. Some observational studies show an association between worse outcomes and lower BPs, 
whereas others have not.117–124 No studies have addressed the treatment of low BP in patients with 
stroke. In a systematic analysis of 12 studies comparing colloids with crystalloids, the odds of death or 
dependence were similar. Clinically important benefits or harms could not be excluded. There are no data 
to guide volume and duration of parenteral fluid delivery.125 No studies have compared different isotonic 
fluids.
See Table XXVIII in online Data Supplement 1.
2.  
Patients who have elevated BP and are otherwise eligible for 
treatment with IV alteplase should have their BP carefully lowered 
so that their systolic BP is <185 mm Hg and their diastolic BP is 
<110 mm Hg before IV fibrinolytic therapy is initiated.

The RCTs of IV alteplase required the BP to be <185 mm Hg systolic and <110 mm Hg diastolic before 
treatment and <180/105 mm Hg for the first 24 hours after treatment. Options to treat arterial hypertension in 
patients with AIS who are candidates for acute reperfusion therapy are given in Table 5. Some observational 
studies suggest that the risk of hemorrhage after administration of alteplase is greater in patients with 
higher BPs126–132 and in patients with more BP variability.133 The exact BP at which the risk of hemorrhage 
after thrombolysis increases is unknown. It is thus reasonable to target the BPs used in the RCTs of IV 
thrombolysis.

1.  
IV alteplase (0.9 mg/kg, maximum dose 90 mg over 60 minutes with initial 
10% of dose given as bolus over 1 minute) is recommended for selected 
patients who may be treated within 3 hours of ischemic stroke symptom 
onset or patient last known well or at baseline state. Physicians should 
review the criteria outlined in Table 6 to determine patient eligibility.
I
A
Recommendation reworded for clarity 
from 2013 AIS Guidelines. Class and LOE 
unchanged.
See Table LXXXIII in online Data Supplement 1 
for original wording.
The safety and efficacy of this treatment when administered within the first 3 hours after stroke onset are solidly 
supported by combined data from multiple RCTs90,139,140 and confirmed by extensive community experience 
in many countries.141 The eligibility criteria for IV alteplase have evolved over time as its usefulness and true 
risks have become clearer. A recent AHA statement provides a detailed discussion of this topic.15 Eligibility 
recommendations for IV alteplase in patients with AIS are summarized in Table 6. The benefit of IV alteplase is 
well established for adult patients with disabling stroke symptoms regardless of age and stroke severity.73,142 
Because of this proven benefit and the need to expedite treatment, when a patient cannot provide consent (eg, 
aphasia, confusion) and a legally authorized representative is not immediately available to provide proxy consent, 
it is justified to proceed with IV thrombolysis in an otherwise eligible adult patient with a disabling AIS. In a recent 
trial, a lower dose of IV alteplase (0.6 mg/kg) was not shown to be equivalent to standard-dose IV alteplase for the 
reduction of death and disability at 90 days.143 Main elements of postthrombolysis care are listed in Table 7.
See Table XXXIV in online Data Supplement 1.
2.  
IV alteplase (0.9 mg/kg, maximum dose 90 mg over 60 minutes with 
initial 10% of dose given as bolus over 1 minute) is also recommended 
for selected patients who can be treated within 3 and 4.5 hours of 
ischemic stroke symptom onset or patient last known well. Physicians 
should review the criteria outlined in Table 6 determine patient eligibility.

One trial (ECASS-III) specifically evaluating the efficacy of IV alteplase within 3 and 4.5 hours after symptom onset144 
and pooled analysis of multiple trials testing IV alteplase within various time windows90,139,140 support the value of IV 
thrombolysis up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset. ECASS-III excluded octogenarians, patients taking warfarin regardless 
of international normalized ratio, patients with combined history of diabetes mellitus and previous ischemic stroke, and 
patients with very severe strokes (NIHSS score >25) because of a perceived excessive risk of intracranial hemorrhage in 
those cases. However, careful analysis of available published data summarized in an AHA/American Stroke Association 
 
scientific statement indicates that these exclusion criteria from the trial may not be justified in practice (Table 6).15
See Table XXXIV in online Data Supplement 1.
3.  
For otherwise eligible patients with mild stroke presenting in the 3- 
to 4.5-hour window, treatment with IV alteplase may be reasonable. 
Treatment risks should be weighed against possible benefits.
IIb
B-NR
New recommendation.
In ECASS III, there was no significant interaction of benefit (mRS score 0–1 at 90 days) or safety (sICH or death) with 
stroke severity when patients were categorized by baseline NIHSS score of 0 to 9, 10 to 19, and >20.144 Patients 
with a minor neurological deficit were excluded. Only 128 patients with an NIHSS score of 0 to 5 were included, 
and they were not analyzed separately.145 In SITS-ISTR (Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke–International 
Stroke Thrombolysis Registry), good functional outcomes (mRS score 0–1 at 90 days) and risk of sICH were similar 
or the same in mild stroke treated in 0 to 3 and 3 to 4.5 hours.146 Similarly, in the GWTG registry, good functional 
outcomes, mortality, and risk of sICH were the same in mild stroke treated in 0 to 3 and 3 to 4.5 hours.147
See Tables XXXV and XXXVI in online Data 
Supplement 1.
4.  
In otherwise eligible patients who have had a previously 
demonstrated small number (1–10) of CMBs on MRI, administration 
of IV alteplase is reasonable.
IIa
B-NR
New recommendation.
5.  
In otherwise eligible patients who have had a previously 
demonstrated high burden of CMBs (>10) on MRI, treatment with IV 
alteplase may be associated with an increased risk of sICH, and the 
benefits of treatment are uncertain. Treatment may be reasonable if 
there is the potential for substantial benefit.
IIb
B-NR
New recommendation.
MRI with hemosiderin-sensitive sequences has shown that clinically silent CMBs occur in approximately one fourth 
of patients who have received IV alteplase. No RCTs of IV alteplase in AIS with baseline MRI to identify CMBs have 
been conducted, so no determination of the effect of baseline CMB on the treatment effect of alteplase with CMB 
is available. Two meta-analyses of the association of baseline CMBs on the risk of sICH after IV alteplase have 
shown that sICH is more common in patients with baseline CMBs (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.12–4.22; OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 
1.21–4.61).85,86 However, sICH in patients with baseline CMBs is not more common (6.1%, 6.5%)85,86 than in the 
NINDS rtPA trial (6.4%).87 In patients with >10 CMBs, the sICH rate was 40%, but this is based on only 6 events in 
15 patients, and patients with >10 CMBs constituted only 0.8% of the sample.86 Meta-analysis of the 4 studies that 
provided information on 3- to 6-month functional outcomes showed that the presence of CMBs was associated with 
worse outcomes after IV alteplase compared with patients without CMBs (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.18–2.14; P=0.002).85 
Thus, the presence of CMBs increases the risk of ICH and the chances of poor outcomes after IV alteplase, but it 
is unclear whether these negative effects fully negate the benefit of thrombolysis. It is also unknown whether the 
location and number of CMBs may differentially influence outcomes. These questions deserve further investigation.

For severe stroke symptoms, IV alteplase is indicated within 3 h from symptom onset of ischemic stroke. Despite increased risk of 
hemorrhagic transformation, there is still proven clinical benefit for patients with severe stroke symptoms.† (Class I; LOE A)
For patients with mild but disabling stroke symptoms, IV alteplase is indicated within 3 h from symptom onset of ischemic stroke. 
There should be no exclusion for patients with mild but nonetheless disabling stroke symptoms, in the opinion of the treating 
physician, from treatment with IV alteplase because there is proven clinical benefit for those patients.† (Class I; LOE B-R)‡

Xa inhibitors unless laboratory tests such as aPTT, INR, platelet count, ecarin clotting time, thrombin time, or appropriate direct factor Xa 
activity assays are normal or the patient has not received a dose of these agents for >48 h (assuming normal renal metabolizing function).
(Alteplase could be considered when appropriate laboratory tests such as aPTT, INR, ecarin clotting time, thrombin time, or direct 
factor Xa activity assays are normal or when the patient has not taken a dose of these ACs for >48 h and renal function is normal.)
(Recommendation wording modified to match Class III stratifications.)
  
Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa 
receptor inhibitors
Antiplatelet agents that inhibit the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor should not be administered concurrently with IV alteplase outside a 
clinical trial.† (Class III: Harm; LOE B-R)‡§
(Recommendation wording modified to match Class III stratifications.)
 Infective endocarditis
For patients with AIS and symptoms consistent with infective endocarditis, treatment with IV alteplase should not be administered 
because of the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage.† (Class III: Harm; LOE C-LD)‡§
(Recommendation wording modified to match Class III stratifications.)
 Aortic arch dissection
IV alteplase in AIS known or suspected to be associated with aortic arch dissection is potentially harmful and should not be 
administered.† (Class III: Harm; LOE C-EO)‡§

For patients taking warfarin and with an INR ≤1.7 who present in the 3- to 4.5-h window, IV alteplase appears safe and may be 
beneficial.† (Class IIb; LOE B-NR)‡
In AIS patients with prior stroke and diabetes mellitus presenting in the 3- to 4.5- h window, IV alteplase may be as effective as 
treatment in the 0- to 3-h window and may be a reasonable option.† (Class IIb; LOE B-NR)‡
  
Severity 0- to 3-h 
window
Within 3 h from symptom onset, treatment of patients with mild ischemic stroke symptoms that are judged as nondisabling may be 
considered. Treatment risks should be weighed against possible benefits; however, more study is needed to further define the risk-
to-benefit ratio.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
  
Severity 3- to 4.5-h 
window
For otherwise eligible patients with mild stroke presenting in the 3- to 4.5-h window, IV alteplase may be as effective as treatment 
in the 0- to 3-h window and may be a reasonable option. Treatment risks should be weighed against possible benefits. (Class IIb; 
LOE B-NR)‖
The benefit of IV alteplase between 3 and 4.5 h from symptom onset for patients with very severe stroke symptoms (NIHSS > 25) is 
uncertain.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)
 Preexisting disability
Preexisting disability does not seem to independently increase the risk of sICH after IV alteplase, but it may be associated 
with less neurological improvement and higher mortality. Thrombolytic therapy with IV alteplase for acute stroke patients with 
preexisting disability (mRS score ≥2) may be reasonable, but decisions should take into account relevant factors, including 
quality of life, social support, place of residence, need for a caregiver, patients’ and families’ preferences, and goals of care.† 
(Class IIb; LOE B-NR)‡
 
Patients with preexisting dementia may benefit from IV alteplase. Individual considerations such as life expectancy and 
premorbid level of function are important to determine whether alteplase may offer a clinically meaningful benefit.† (Class 
IIb; LOE B-NR)‡
 Early improvement
IV alteplase treatment is reasonable for patients who present with moderate to severe ischemic stroke and demonstrate early 
improvement but remain moderately impaired and potentially disabled in the judgment of the examiner.† (Class IIa; LOE A)
 Seizure at onset
IV alteplase is reasonable in patients with a seizure at the time of onset of acute stroke if evidence suggests that residual 
impairments are secondary to stroke and not a postictal phenomenon.† (Class IIa; LOE C-LD)‡
 Blood glucose
Treatment with IV alteplase in patients with AIS who present with initial glucose levels <50 or >400 mg/dL that are subsequently 
normalized and who are otherwise eligible may be reasonable. (Recommendation modified from 2015 IV Alteplase to conform to text 
of 2015 IV Alteplase. [Class IIb; LOE C-LD])‡
 Coagulopathy
The safety and efficacy of IV alteplase for acute stroke patients with a clinical history of potential bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy 
are unknown. IV alteplase may be considered on a case-by-case basis.† (Class IIb; LOE C-EO)‡
 
IV alteplase may be reasonable in patients who have a history of warfarin use and an INR ≤1.7 and/or a PT <15 s.† (Class IIb; LOE 
B-NR)‡
 Dural puncture
IV alteplase may be considered for patients who present with AIS, even in instances when they may have undergone a lumbar dural 
puncture in the preceding 7 d.† (Class IIb; LOE C-EO)‡
 Arterial puncture
The safety and efficacy of administering IV alteplase to acute stroke patients who have had an arterial puncture of a 
noncompressible blood vessel in the 7 d preceding stroke symptoms are uncertain.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
 Recent major trauma
In AIS patients with recent major trauma (within 14 d) not involving the head, IV alteplase may be carefully considered, with the 
risks of bleeding from injuries related to the trauma weighed against the severity and potential disability from the ischemic stroke. 
(Recommendation modified from 2015 IV Alteplase to specify that it does not apply to head trauma. [Class IIb; LOE C-LD])‡
 Recent major surgery
Use of IV alteplase in carefully selected patients presenting with AIS who have undergone a major surgery in the preceding 14 d 
may be considered, but the potential increased risk of surgical-site hemorrhage should be weighed against the anticipated benefits 
of reduced stroke related neurological deficits.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
  
GI and genitourinary 
bleeding
Reported literature details a low bleeding risk with IV alteplase administration in the setting of past GI/genitourinary bleeding. 
Administration of IV alteplase in this patient population may be reasonable.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD‡
(Note: Alteplase administration within 21 d of a GI bleeding event is not recommended; see Contraindications.)
 Menstruation
IV alteplase is probably indicated in women who are menstruating who present with AIS and do not have a history of menorrhagia. 
However, women should be warned that alteplase treatment could increase the degree of menstrual flow.† (Class IIa; LOE C-EO)
 
Because the potential benefits of IV alteplase probably outweigh the risks of serious bleeding in patients with recent or active 
history of menorrhagia without clinically significant anemia or hypotension, IV alteplase administration may be considered.† 
(Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
 
When there is a history of recent or active vaginal bleeding causing clinically significant anemia, then emergency consultation with a 
gynecologist is probably indicated before a decision about IV alteplase is made.† (Class IIa; LOE C-EO)‡
  
Extracranial cervical 
dissections
IV alteplase in AIS known or suspected to be associated with extracranial cervical arterial dissection is reasonably safe within 4.5 h 
and probably recommended.† (Class IIa; LOE C-LD)‡
  
Intracranial arterial 
dissection
IV alteplase usefulness and hemorrhagic risk in AIS known or suspected to be associated with intracranial arterial dissection remain 
unknown, uncertain, and not well established.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡

Unruptured intracranial 
aneurysm
For patients presenting with AIS who are known to harbor a small or moderate-sized (<10 mm) unruptured and unsecured 
intracranial aneurysm, administration of IV alteplase is reasonable and probably recommended.† (Class IIa; LOE C-LD)‡
 
Usefulness and risk of IV alteplase in patients with AIS who harbor a giant unruptured and unsecured intracranial aneurysm are not 
well established.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
  
Intracranial vascular 
malformations
For patients presenting with AIS who are known to harbor an unruptured and untreated intracranial vascular malformation the 
usefulness and risks of administration of IV alteplase are not well established.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
 
Because of the increased risk of ICH in this population of patients, IV alteplase may be considered in patients with stroke with 
severe neurological deficits and a high likelihood of morbidity and mortality to outweigh the anticipated risk of ICH secondary to 
thrombolysis.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
 CMBs
In otherwise eligible patients who have previously had a small number (1–10) of CMBs demonstrated on MRI, administration of IV 
alteplase is reasonable. (Class IIa; Level B-NR)‖
 
In otherwise eligible patients who have previously had a high burden of CMBs (>10) demonstrated on MRI, treatment with IV 
alteplase may be associated with an increased risk of sICH, and the benefits of treatment are uncertain. Treatment may be 
reasonable if there is the potential for substantial benefit. (Class IIb; Level B-NR)‖
  
Extra-axial intracranial 
neoplasms
IV alteplase treatment is probably recommended for patients with AIS who harbor an extra-axial intracranial neoplasm.† (Class IIa; 
LOE C-EO)‡
 Acute MI
For patients presenting with concurrent AIS and acute MI, treatment with IV alteplase at the dose appropriate for cerebral ischemia, 
followed by percutaneous coronary angioplasty and stenting if indicated, is reasonable.† (Class IIa; LOE C-EO)‡
 Recent MI
For patients presenting with AIS and a history of recent MI in the past 3 mo, treating the ischemic stroke with IV alteplase is 
reasonable if the recent MI was non-STEMI.† (Class IIa; LOE C-LD)‡
 
For patients presenting with AIS and a history of recent MI in the past 3 mo, treating the ischemic stroke with IV alteplase is 
reasonable if the recent MI was a STEMI involving the right or inferior myocardium.† (Class IIa; LOE C-LD)‡
 
For patients presenting with AIS and a history of recent MI in the past 3 mo, treating the ischemic stroke with IV alteplase may 
reasonable if the recent MI was a STEMI involving the left anterior myocardium.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
 Other cardiac diseases
For patients with major AIS likely to produce severe disability and acute pericarditis, treatment with IV alteplase may be reasonable† 
(Class IIb; LOE C-EO)‡; urgent consultation with a cardiologist is recommended in this situation.
 
For patients presenting with moderate AIS likely to produce mild disability and acute pericarditis, treatment with IV alteplase is of 
uncertain net benefit.† (Class IIb; LOE C-EO)‡
 
For patients with major AIS likely to produce severe disability and known left atrial or ventricular thrombus, treatment with IV 
alteplase may be reasonable.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
 
For patients presenting with moderate AIS likely to produce mild disability and known left atrial or ventricular thrombus, treatment 
with IV alteplase is of uncertain net benefit.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
 
For patients with major AIS likely to produce severe disability and cardiac myxoma, treatment with IV alteplase may be reasonable.† 
(Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
 
For patients presenting with major AIS likely to produce severe disability and papillary fibroelastoma, treatment with IV alteplase 
may be reasonable.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
 Procedural stroke
IV alteplase is reasonable for the treatment of AIS complications of cardiac or cerebral angiographic procedures, depending on the 
usual eligibility criteria.† (Class IIa; LOE A)‡
 Systemic malignancy
The safety and efficacy of alteplase in patients with current malignancy are not well established.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡ Patients 
with systemic malignancy and reasonable (>6 mo) life expectancy may benefit from IV alteplase if other contraindications such as 
coagulation abnormalities, recent surgery, or systemic bleeding do not coexist.
 Pregnancy
IV alteplase administration may be considered in pregnancy when the anticipated benefits of treating moderate or severe stroke 
outweigh the anticipated increased risks of uterine bleeding.† (Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
 
The safety and efficacy of IV alteplase in the early postpartum period (<14 d after delivery) have not been well established.† 
(Class IIb; LOE C-LD)‡
  
Ophthalmological 
conditions
Use of IV alteplase in patients presenting with AIS who have a history of diabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy or other hemorrhagic 
ophthalmic conditions is reasonable to recommend, but the potential increased risk of visual loss should be weighed against the 
anticipated benefits of reduced stroke-related neurological deficits.† (Class IIa; LOE B-NR)‡
 Sickle cell disease
IV alteplase for adults presenting with an AIS with known sickle cell disease can be beneficial. (Class IIa; LOE B-NR)‖

 Illicit drug use
Treating clinicians should be aware that illicit drug use may be a contributing factor to incident stroke. IV alteplase is reasonable in 
instances of illicit drug use–associated AIS in patients with no other exclusions.† (Class IIa; LOE C-LD)‡
 Stroke mimics
The risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the stroke mimic population is quite low; thus, starting IV alteplase is probably 
recommended in preference over delaying treatment to pursue additional diagnostic studies.† (Class IIa; LOE B-NR)
Clinicians should also be informed of the indications and contraindications from local regulatory agencies (for current information from the US Food and Drug 
Administration refer to http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/103172s5203lbl.pdf).

Maintain airway
  
Endotracheal intubation may not be necessary if edema is limited to 
anterior tongue and lips.
  
Edema involving larynx, palate, floor of mouth, or oropharynx with rapid 
progression (within 30 min) poses higher risk of requiring intubation.
  
Awake fiberoptic intubation is optimal. Nasal-tracheal intubation may be 
required but poses risk of epistaxis post-IV alteplase. Cricothyroidotomy 
is rarely needed and also problematic after IV alteplase.
Discontinue IV alteplase infusion and hold ACEIs
Administer IV methylprednisolone 125 mg
Administer IV diphenhydramine 50 mg

The benefit of IV defibrinogenating agents and of IV fibrinolytic

therefore, their administration is not recommended outside a 
clinical trial.
III: No Benefit
B-R
Recommendation revised from 2013 AIS 
Guidelines.
Randomized placebo-controlled trials have not shown benefit from the administration of IV streptokinase within 
6 hours or desmoteplase within 3 to 9 hours after stroke onset in patients with ischemic penumbra or large 
intracranial artery occlusion or severe stenosis.92,95,167,168
See Table XXXIX in online Data Supplement 1.

Tenecteplase administered as a 0.4-mg/kg single IV bolus has 
not been proven to be superior or noninferior to alteplase but 
might be considered as an alternative to alteplase in patients 
with minor neurological impairment and no major intracranial 
occlusion.
IIb
B-R
New recommendation.
IV tenecteplase has been compared to IV alteplase up to 6 hours after stroke onset in 3 phase II and 1 phase 
III superiority trials; tenecteplase appears to be similarly safe, but it is unclear whether it is as effective as 
or more effective than alteplase.89,91,169,170 In the largest trial of 1100 subjects, tenecteplase at a dose of 0.4 
mg/kg failed to demonstrate superiority and had a safety and efficacy profile similar to that of alteplase in a 
stroke population composed predominantly of patients with minor neurological impairment (median NIHSS 
score, 4) and no major intracranial occlusion.170 Tenecteplase is given as a single IV bolus as opposed to the 
1-hour infusion of alteplase.

New recommendation.
Since the publication of the 2013 AIS Guidelines, a further RCT of sonothrombolysis as adjuvant therapy for IV 
thrombolysis has shown no clinical benefit. NOR-SASS (Norwegian Sonothrombolysis in Acute Stroke Study) 
randomized 183 patients who had received either alteplase or tenecteplase for AIS within 4.5 hours of onset to 
either contrast-enhanced sonothrombolysis (93 patients) or sham (90 patients). Neurological improvement at 24 
hours and functional outcome at 90 days were not statistically significantly different in the 2 groups, nor were 
the rates of sICH.171 At this time, there are no RCT data to support additional clinical benefit of sonothrombolysis 
as adjuvant therapy for IV thrombolysis.

Recommendation revised from 2015 
Endovascular.
In pooled patient-level data from 5 trials (HERMES [Highly Effective Reperfusion Evaluated in Multiple 
Endovascular Stroke Trials], which included the 5 trials MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, SWIFT PRIME, and 
EXTEND-IA), the odds of better disability outcomes at 90 days (mRS scale distribution) with the mechanical 
thrombectomy group declined with longer time from symptom onset to expected arterial puncture: common 
odds ratio (cOR) at 3 hours, 2.79 (95% CI, 1.96–3.98), absolute risk difference (ARD) for lower disability 
scores, 39.2%; cOR at 6 hours, 1.98 (95% CI, 1.30–3.00), ARD, 30.2%; and cOR at 8 hours, 1.57 (95% CI, 
0.86–2.88), ARD, 15.7%, retaining statistical significance through 7 hours 18 minutes.32 Among 390 patients 
who achieved substantial reperfusion with endovascular thrombectomy, each 1-hour delay to reperfusion was 
associated with a less favorable degree of disability (cOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76–0.93; ARD, −6.7%) and less 
functional independence (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71–0.92; ARD, −5.2%; 95% CI, −8.3 to −2.1) but no change 
in mortality (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.93–1.34; ARD, 1.5%; 95% CI, −0.9 to 4.2).32 These data do not directly 
address the question of whether patients should be observed after IV alteplase to assess for clinical response 
before pursuing mechanical thrombectomy. However, one can infer that because disability outcomes at 90 
days were directly associated with time from symptom onset to arterial puncture, any cause for delay to 
mechanical thrombectomy, including observing for a clinical response after IV alteplase, should be avoided. 
Therefore, the recommendation is slightly modified from the 2015 Endovascular Update.

Patients should receive mechanical thrombectomy with a stent 
retriever if they meet all the following criteria: (1) prestroke mRS 
score of 0 to 1; (2) causative occlusion of the internal carotid 
artery or MCA segment 1 (M1); (3) age ≥18 years; (4) NIHSS score 
of ≥6; (5) ASPECTS of ≥6; and (6) treatment can be initiated (groin 
puncture) within 6 hours of symptom onset.
I
A
Recommendation revised from 2015 
Endovascular.
Results from 6 recent randomized trials of mechanical thrombectomy using predominantly stent retriever 
devices (MR CLEAN, SWIFT PRIME, EXTEND-IA, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, THRACE) support Class I, LOE A 
recommendations for a defined group of patients as described in the 2015 guidelines.102–107 A pooled, patient-
level analysis from 5 of these studies reported by the HERMES collaboration showed treatment effect in the 
subgroup of 188 patients not treated with IV alteplase (cOR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.30–4.55); therefore, pretreatment 
with IV alteplase has been removed from the prior recommendation. The HERMES pooled patient-level data 
also showed that mechanical thrombectomy had a favorable effect over standard care in patients ≥80 years 
old (cOR, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.95–6.92).172 In patient-level data pooled from trials in which the Solitaire was the 
only or the predominant device used, a prespecified meta-analysis (SEER Collaboration [Safety and Efficacy 
of Solitaire Stent Thrombectomy–Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials]: SWIFT PRIME, 
ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, REVASCAT) showed that mechanical thrombectomy had a favorable effect over standard 
care in patients ≥80 years old (3.46; 95% CI, 1.58–7.60).173 In a meta-analysis of 5 RCTs (MR CLEAN, 
ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, SWIFT PRIME, REVASCAT), there was favorable effect with mechanical thrombectomy 
over standard care without heterogeneity of effect across patient age subgroups (for patient age <70 and 
≥70 years: OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.51–3.84; and OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.20–4.26, respectively).174 However, the 
number of patients in these trials who were ≥90 years of age was very small, and the benefit of mechanical 
thrombectomy over standard care in patients ≥90 years of age is not clear. As with any treatment decision 
in an elderly patient, consideration of comorbidities and risks should factor into the decision making for 
mechanical thrombectomy.
See Tables XXIII and XLI in online Data 
Supplement 1.
4.  
Although the benefits are uncertain, the use of mechanical 
thrombectomy with stent retrievers may be reasonable for carefully 
selected patients with AIS in whom treatment can be initiated 
(groin puncture) within 6 hours of symptom onset and who have 
causative occlusion of the MCA segment 2 (M2) or MCA segment 3 
(M3) portion of the MCAs.

In pooled patient-level data from 5 trials (HERMES, which included the 5 trials MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, 
SWIFT PRIME, and EXTEND-IA), the direction of treatment effect for mechanical thrombectomy over standard 
care was favorable in M2 occlusions, but the adjusted common OR was not significant (1.28; 95% CI, 
0.51–3.21).172 In patient-level data pooled from trials in which the Solitaire was the only or the predominant 
device used, a prespecified meta-analysis (SEER Collaboration: SWIFT PRIME, ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, REVASCAT) 
showed that the direction of treatment effect was favorable for mechanical thrombectomy over standard care 
in M2 occlusions, but the OR and 95% CI were not significant.173 In an analysis of pooled data from SWIFT 
(Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy), STAR (Solitaire Flow Restoration Thrombectomy for Acute 
Revascularization), DEFUSE 2, and IMS III, among patients with M2 occlusions, reperfusion was associated with 
excellent functional outcomes (mRS score 0–1; OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.0–4.7).175 Therefore, the recommendation for 
mechanical thrombectomy for M2/M3 occlusions does not change substantively from the 2015 AHA/American

New recommendation.
The DAWN trial used clinical imaging mismatch (a combination of NIHSS score and imaging findings on CTP 
or DW-MRI) as eligibility criteria to select patients with large anterior circulation vessel occlusion for treatment 
with mechanical thrombectomy between 6 and 24 hours from last known normal. This trial demonstrated 
an overall benefit in function outcome at 90 days in the treatment group (mRS score 0–2, 49% versus 13%; 
adjusted difference, 33%; 95% CI, 21–44; posterior probability of superiority >0.999).108 In DAWN, there were 
few strokes with witnessed onset (12%).The DEFUSE 3 trial used perfusion-core mismatch and maximum 
core size as imaging criteria to select patients with large anterior circulation occlusion 6 to 16 hours from 
last seen well for mechanical thrombectomy. This trial showed a benefit in functional outcome at 90 days in 
the treated group (mRS score 0–2, 44.6% versus 16.7%; RR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.60–4.48; P<0.0001).109 Benefit 
was independently demonstrated for the subgroup of patients who met DAWN eligibility criteria and for the 
subgroup who did not. DAWN and DEFUSE 3 are the only RCTs showing benefit of mechanical thrombectomy 
>6 hours from onset. Therefore, only the eligibility criteria from one or the other of these trials should be used 
for patient selection. Although future RCTs may demonstrate that additional eligibility criteria can be used to 
select patients who benefit from mechanical thrombectomy, at this time, the DAWN or DEFUSE-3 eligibility 
should be strictly adhered to in clinical practice.
See Table XXIII in online Data Supplement 1.
9.  
The technical goal of the thrombectomy procedure should be 
reperfusion to a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction

Recommendation reworded for clarity from 
2015 Endovascular.
See Table LXXXIII in online Data Supplement 1 
for original wording.
Mechanical thrombectomy aims to achieve reperfusion, not simply recanalization. A variety of reperfusion scores 
exist, but the mTICI score is the current assessment tool of choice, with proven value in predicting clinical 
outcomes.176,177 All recent endovascular trials used the mTICI 2b/3 threshold for adequate reperfusion, with high 
rates achieved. In HERMES, 402 of 570 patients (71%) were successfully reperfused to mTICI 2b/3.172 Earlier 
trials with less efficient devices showed lower recanalization rates, 1 factor in their inability to demonstrate 
benefit from the procedure (IMS III, 41%; MR RESCUE, 25%). The additional benefit of pursuing mTICI of 3 rather 
than 2b deserves further investigation.
 
10.  
As with IV alteplase, reduced time from symptom onset to 
reperfusion with endovascular therapies is highly associated with 
better clinical outcomes. To ensure benefit, reperfusion to TICI 
grade 2b/3 should be achieved as early as possible within the 
therapeutic window.
I
B-R
Recommendation revised from 2015 
Endovascular.
In pooled patient-level data from 5 trials (HERMES, which included the 5 trials MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, 
SWIFT PRIME, and EXTEND-IA), the odds of better disability outcomes at 90 days (mRS scale distribution) 
with the mechanical thrombectomy group declined with longer time from symptom onset to expected arterial 
puncture: cOR at 3 hours, 2.79 (95% CI, 1.96–3.98), ARD for lower disability scores, 39.2%; cOR at 6 
hours, 1.98 (95% CI, 1.30–3.00), ARD, 30.2%; cOR at 8 hours, 1.57 (95% CI, 0.86–2.88), and ARD, 15.7%, 
retaining statistical significance through 7 hours 18 minutes.32 Among 390 patients who achieved substantial 
reperfusion with endovascular thrombectomy, each 1-hour delay to reperfusion was associated with a less 
favorable degree of disability (cOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76–0.93; ARD, −6.7%) and less functional independence 
(OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71–0.92; ARD, −5.2%; 95% CI, −8.3 to −2.1).32 In the DAWN trial, the likelihood of 
achieving an mRS score of 0 to 2 at 90 days in the mechanical thrombectomy group declined with time 
since last known normal.108 Therefore, reduced time from symptom onset to reperfusion with endovascular 
therapies is highly associated with better clinical outcomes. A variety of reperfusion scores exist, but the mTICI 
score is the current assessment tool of choice, with proven value in predicting clinical outcomes.129,130 All 
recent endovascular trials used the mTICI 2b/3 threshold for adequate reperfusion, with high rates achieved. 
In HERMES, 402 of 570 patients (71%) were successfully reperfused to TICI 2b/3.172 Earlier trials with less

The ASTER trial (Contact Aspiration vs Stent Retriever for Successful Revascularization) compared the contact 
aspiration technique and the standard stent retriever technique as first-line EVT for successful revascularization 
within 6 hours among patients with acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke and LVO. The proportion of 
patients with successful revascularization at the end of all interventions was 85.4% (n=164) in the contact 
aspiration group versus 83.1% (n=157) in the stent retriever group (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.68–2.10; P=0.53; 
difference, 2.4%; 95% CI, −5.4 to 9.7%). The secondary clinical end point of mRS score of 0 to 2 at 90 days was 
achieved by 82 of 181 (45.3%) in the contact aspiration group versus 91 of 182 (50.0%) in the stent retriever 
group (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.54–1.26; P=0.38). The primary end point in ASTER was technical (successful 
revascularization after all interventions), and the trial was not powered to detect a smaller yet potentially 
clinically important difference between groups. Given its superiority design to detect a 15% difference in the 
primary end point, this trial was not designed to establish noninferiority.178
See Table XXIII in online Data Supplement 1.
13.  
The use of a proximal balloon guide catheter or a large-bore 
distal-access catheter, rather than a cervical guide catheter

Intra-arterial lytic therapy played a limited role in the recent endovascular trials but was used as rescue therapy, 
not initial treatment. In MR CLEAN, the EVT method was at the discretion of operator, with 40 of 233 treated 
with alternative stent retrievers to Trevo and Solitaire or intra-arterial alteplase. Details are not available, but no 
patients were treated with intra-arterial alteplase alone. Twenty-four of 233 (10.3%) had treatment with a second 
modality. Treatment method had no impact on outcomes in this trial.179 In THRACE, an intra-arterial lytic was used 
to a maximum dose of 0.3 mg/kg and allowed to establish goal reperfusion, only after mechanical thrombectomy 
was attempted. A mean dose of 8.8 mg was administered in 15 of 141 patients receiving mechanical 
thrombectomy (11%). There was no effect on outcomes compared with mechanical thrombectomy alone.
 
15.  
EVT of tandem occlusions (both extracranial and intracranial

IIb

Recommendation revised from 2015 
Endovascular.
Tandem occlusions were considered in recent endovascular trials that showed benefit of mechanical 
thrombectomy over medical management alone. In the HERMES meta-analysis, 122 of 1254 tandem occlusions 
(RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.96–3.4) and 1132 of 1254 nontandem occlusions (RR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.40–2.09) were 
reported compared with medical management.172 In THRACE, 24 of 196 tandem occlusions (RR, 1.82; 95% CI, 
0.55–6.07) and 172 of 196 nontandem occlusions (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.87–2.07) were treated compared with IV 
alteplase alone.106 In HERMES, there is heterogeneity of treatment methods directed to the proximal extracranial 
carotid occlusion (no revascularization of the proximal lesion versus angioplasty versus stenting). Multiple 
retrospective reports detail the technical success of EVT for tandem occlusions but do not provide specifics 
on comparative approaches. No conclusions about the optimum treatment approach for patients with tandem 
occlusions are therefore possible.

Recommendation revised from 2015 
Endovascular.
Conscious sedation (CS) was widely used in the recent endovascular trials (90.9% of ESCAPE, 63% of SWIFT 
PRIME) with no clear positive or negative impact on outcome. In MR CLEAN, post hoc analysis showed a 51% 
(95% CI, 31–86) decrease in treatment effect of general anesthesia (GA) compared with CS.180 In THRACE, 51 
of 67 patients receiving GA and 43 of 69 patients receiving CS achieved TICI 2b/3 (P=0.059) with no impact 
on outcome.106 Thirty-five of 67 patients with GA and 36 of 74 with CS had mRS scores of 0 to 2 at 90 days. 
Although several retrospective studies suggest that GA produces worsening of functional outcomes, there are 
limited prospective randomized data. Two small (≤150 participants) single-center RCTs have compared GA with 
CS. Both failed to show superiority of either treatment for the primary clinical end point.181,182 Until further data 
are available, either method of procedural sedation is reasonable.

There are very limited data to guide BP therapy during and after the procedure in patients who undergo

The vast majority of patients enrolled in under 6-hour RCTs received IV alteplase and the trial protocols 
stipulated management according to local guidelines with BP ≤80/105 during and for 24 hours after the 
procedure for these participants. Two trial protocols provided additional recommendations. The ESCAPE protocol 
states that systolic BP ≥150 mm Hg is probably useful in promoting and keeping collateral flow adequate 
while the artery remains occluded and that controlling BP once reperfusion has been achieved and aiming 
for a normal BP for that individual is sensible. Labetalol or an IV β-blocker such as metoprolol in low doses is 
recommended.104 The DAWN protocol recommends maintaining systolic BP <140  mm Hg in the first 24 hours in 
subjects who are reperfused after mechanical thrombectomy (defined as achieving more than two thirds MCA 
territory reperfusion).183

Administration of aspirin is recommended in patients with

Recommendation revised from 2013 AIS 
Guidelines.
The safety and benefit of aspirin in the treatment of patients with AIS were established by 2 large clinical trials 
administering doses between 160 and 300 mg.184,185 This has recently been confirmed by a large Cochrane review 
of aspirin trials.186 In patients unsafe or unable to swallow, rectal or nasogastric administration is appropriate. 
Limited data exist on the use of alternative antiplatelet agents in the treatment of AIS. However, in patients with a 
contraindication to aspirin, administering alternative antiplatelet agents may be reasonable. A retrospective analysis 
of consecutive ischemic stroke patients admitted to a single center in Seoul, South Korea, found no increased risk of 
hemorrhage with early initiation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy (<24 hours) after IV alteplase or EVT compared 
with initiation >24 hours. However, this study may have been subject to selection bias, and the timing of initiation 
of antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation should be made on an individual level, balancing risk versus benefit. The 
recommendation was modified from the previous guideline to remove the specific dosing recommendation, “initial 
dose is 325 mg,” because previous clinical trials supporting its use for AIS included doses of 160 to 300 mg.

A recent Cochrane review of IV glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists in the treatment of AIS found that these

The majority of trial data apply to abciximab, which was studied in the AbESTT trial (A Study of Effectiveness and

The CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) was a

90 days, in patients with minor stroke (NIHSS score ≤3) or high-risk TIA (ABCD2 [Age, Blood Pressure, Clinical 
Features, Duration, Diabetes] score ≥4). The primary outcome of recurrent stroke at 90 days (ischemic or 
hemorrhagic) favored dual antiplatelet therapy over aspirin alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57–0.81; 
P<0.001).193 A subsequent report of 1-year outcomes found a durable treatment effect, but the HR for secondary 
stroke prevention was only significantly beneficial in the first 90 days.194 The generalizability of this intervention

Previous data suggested that transcranial near-infrared laser therapy for stroke held promise as a therapeutic

Such basic science and preclinical data culminated in the NEST-3 trial, which was a prospective RCT. This 
trial investigated the use of transcranial laser therapy for the treatment of ischemic stroke between 4.5 
and 24 hours of stroke onset in patients with moderate stroke (NIHSS score 7–17) who did not receive IV 
alteplase.214 This study was terminated because of futility after analysis of the first 566 patients found no 
benefit of transcranial laser therapy over sham treatment. There is currently no evidence that transcranial 
laser therapy is beneficial in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

1.  
In patients with AIS, early treatment of hypertension is indicated 
when required by comorbid conditions (eg, concomitant acute  
coronary event, acute heart failure, aortic dissection, postthrombolysis 
 
sICH, or preeclampsia/eclampsia). Lowering BP initially by 15% is 
probably safe.
I
C-EO
New recommendation.
Patients with AIS can present with severe acute comorbidities that demand emergency BP reduction to prevent 
serious complications. However, it is important to keep in mind that excessive BP lowering can sometimes 
worsen cerebral ischemia.215 Ideal management in these situations should be individualized, but in general, 
initial BP reduction by 15% is a reasonable goal.
 
3.  
In patients with BP ≥220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV 
alteplase or EVT and have no comorbid conditions requiring acute 
antihypertensive treatment, the benefit of initiating or reinitiating 
treatment of hypertension within the first 48 to 72 hours is 
uncertain. It might be reasonable to lower BP by 15% during the 
first 24 hours after onset of stroke.
IIb
C-EO
New recommendation.
Patients with severe hypertension (most commonly >220/120 mm Hg) were excluded from clinical trials 
evaluating BP lowering after AIS.218,219,222,223,225,228 BP reduction has been traditionally advised for these cases, but 
the benefit of such treatment in the absence of comorbid conditions that may be acutely exacerbated by severe 
hypertension has not been formally studied.
See Table L in online Data Supplement 1.
4.  
Although no solid data are available to guide selection of 
medications for BP lowering after AIS, the antihypertensive 
medications and doses included in Table 5 are reasonable options.
IIa
C-EO
Recommendation/table revised from 2013 AIS 
Guidelines.
There are no data to show that 1 strategy to lower BP is better than another after AIS. The medications and 
doses in Table 5 are all reasonable options.
 
5.  
Starting or restarting antihypertensive therapy during 
hospitalization in patients with BP >140/90 mm Hg who are 
neurologically stable is safe and is reasonable to improve long-term 
BP control unless contraindicated.
IIa
B-R
New recommendation.
Starting or restarting antihypertensive medications has been shown to be associated with improved control of 
the BP after discharge in 2 trials.223,225 Therefore, it is reasonable to start or restart antihypertensive medications 
in the hospital when the patient remains hypertensive and is neurologically stable. Studies evaluating this 
question included only patients with previous diagnosis of hypertension223 or enrolled mostly patients with 
previous hypertension.225 However, because hypertension is not uncommonly first diagnosed during the 
hospitalization for stroke, it is reasonable to apply this recommendation also to patients without preexistent 
hypertension.

For patients with dysphagia, it is reasonable to initially use nasogastric

IIa
C-EO
New recommendation.
The FOOD RCTs (Feed Or Ordinary Diet; phases I–III), completed in 131 hospitals in 18 countries,235 showed 
that supplemented diet was associated with an absolute reduction in risk of death of 0.7% and that early 
tube feeding (within 7 days of admission) was associated with an absolute reduction in risk of death of 
5.8% and a reduction in death or poor outcomes of 1.2%. When nasogastric feeding and percutaneous 
endoscopic gastrostomy feeding were compared, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding was 
associated with an increase in absolute risk of death of 1.0% and an increased risk of death or poor 
outcomes of 7.8%. The conclusion was that stroke patients should be started on enteral diet within the first 
7 days of admission.235 In 2012, a Cochrane review analyzed 33 RCTs involving 6779 patients to assess the 
intervention for dysphagia treatment, feeding strategies and timing (early [within 7 days] versus later), fluid 
supplementation, and the effects of nutritional supplementation on acute and subacute stroke patients.236 
The conclusion was that, although data remained insufficient to offer definitive answers, available 
information suggested that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding and nasogastric tube feeding 
do not differ in terms of case fatality, death, or dependency, but percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is 
associated with fewer treatment failures (P=0.007), less gastrointestinal bleeding (P=0.007), and higher 
food delivery (P<.00001).

Implementing oral hygiene protocols to reduce the risk of 
pneumonia after stroke may be reasonable.
IIb
B-NR
New recommendation.
Limited studies suggest that intensive oral hygiene protocols might reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia. In 
patients with acute stroke, Sørensen et al237 showed that intervention with standardized dysphagia screening 
and diet and standardized oral hygiene with antibacterial mouth rinse with chlorhexidine reduced pneumonia 
(7% versus 28%) compared with a historical control group in which patients were unsystematically screened 
for dysphagia within 24 hours and received unsystematic and arbitrary oral hygiene without chlorhexidine. 
In this experimental design, the efficacy of the standardized oral hygiene portion in the intervention group 
could not be separated from the standardized dysphagia screening and diet. Furthermore, because of the 
historic nature of the control group, it is possible that other changes in care that could have occurred between 
the historical control subjects and the intervention group might have affected the risk for development of 
pneumonia. A Cochrane review that included 3 studies found that oral care and decontamination gel versus 
oral care and placebo gel reduced the incidence of pneumonia in the intervention group (P=0.03).238 Wagner et 
al239 conducted a cohort study comparing rates of pneumonia in hospitalized stroke patients before and after 
implementation of systematic oral hygiene care. The unadjusted incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia 
was lower in the group assigned to oral hygiene care compared with control subjects (14% versus 10.33%; 
P=0.022), with an unadjusted OR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.48–0.95; P=0.022). After adjustment for confounders, 
the OR of hospital-acquired pneumonia in the intervention group remained significantly lower at 0.71 (95% CI, 
0.51–0.98; P=0.041).

In immobile stroke patients without contraindications, intermittent

I
B-R
Recommendation revised from 2016 Rehab 
Guidelines. 
CLOTS (Clots in Legs or stockings After Stroke) 3 was a multicenter trial enrolling 2867 patients in 94 centers 
in the United Kingdom and comparing the use of IPC with routine care to no IPC with routine care in immobile 
stroke patients for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Eligible patients were enrolled within 3 days of the 
acute stroke and could not mobilize to the toilet without the help of another person. Routine care was defined 
as the use of aspirin for nonhemorrhagic stroke, hydration, and possible compression stockings. A total of 31% 
of the patients received prophylactic or full-dose heparin or LMWH, but these patients were evenly distributed 
between both groups. After the exclusion of 323 patients who died before any primary outcome and 41 who 
had no screening, the primary outcome of DVT occurred in 122 of 1267 IPC participants (9.6%) compared with 
174 of 1245 no-IPC participants (14.0%), giving an adjusted OR of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.51–0.84; P=0.001). Among 
patients treated with IPC, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival to 6 months (HR, 0.86; 
95% CI, 0.73–0.99; P=0.042) but no improvement in disability. Skin breaks were more common in the IPC group 
(3.1% versus 1.4%; P =0.002). Contraindications to IPC include leg conditions such as dermatitis, gangrene, 
severe edema, venous stasis, severe peripheral vascular disease, postoperative vein ligation, or grafting, as well 
as existing swelling or other signs of an existing DVT.403 A meta-analysis including this trial and 2 smaller trials

The most recent and comprehensive meta-analysis of pharmacological interventions for venous thromboembolism 
prophylaxis in AIS included 1 very large trial (n=14 578) and 4 small trials of UFH, 8 small trials of LMWHs or 
heparinoids, and 1 trial of a heparinoid.240 Prophylactic anticoagulants were not associated with any significant 
effect on mortality or functional status at final follow-up. There were statistically significant reductions 
in symptomatic pulmonary embolisms (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49–0.98) and in DVTs, most of which were 
asymptomatic (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.15–0.29). There were statistically significant increases in symptomatic 
intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.11–2.55) and symptomatic extracranial hemorrhages (OR, 1.65; 
95% CI, 1.0–2.75). There may be a subgroup of patients in whom the benefits of reducing the risk of venous 
thromboembolism are high enough to offset the increased risks of intracranial and extracranial bleeding; however, 
no prediction tool to identify such a subgroup has been derived.197,198,240

The most recent and comprehensive meta-analysis comparing LMWH or heparinoid with UFH for venous

UFH and 4 small trials comparing heparinoids with UFH. There were no significant effects on death or disability 
for LMWH/heparinoids compared with UFH.240 The use of LMWH/heparinoid was associated with a statistically 
significant reduction in DVTs (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.44–0.70), which were mostly asymptomatic, at the expense 
of a greater risk of major extracranial hemorrhages (OR, 3.79; 95% CI, 1.30–11.03). LMWH can be administered 
once a day and thus is more convenient for nurses and comfortable for patients. Higher cost and increased 
bleeding risk in elderly patients with renal impairment are disadvantages of LMWH that should be kept in mind.

A total of 2104 patients were randomly assigned (1:1). The results of the RCT showed that patients in the high-
dose, very early mobilization group had less favorable outcomes (46% versus 50%) than those in the usual care 
group: 8% versus 7% of patients died in the very early mobilization group and 19% versus 20% had a nonfatal 
serious adverse event with high-dose, very early mobilization.
See Table LVIII in online Data Supplement 1.

It is recommended that all individuals with stroke be provided a 
formal assessment of their activities of daily living and instrumental 
activities of daily living, communication abilities, and functional 
mobility before discharge from acute care hospitalization and the 
findings be incorporated into the care transition and the discharge 
planning process.

Ventriculostomy is recommended in the treatment of obstructive 
hydrocephalus after a cerebellar infarct. Concomitant or 
subsequent decompressive craniectomy may or may not be 
necessary on the basis of factors such as infarct size, neurological 
condition, degree of brainstem compression, and effectiveness of 
medical management.
I
C-LD
Recommendation revised from 2014 Cerebral 
Edema.
Ventriculostomy is a well-recognized effective treatment for the management of acute obstructive hydrocephalus 
and is often effective in isolation in relieving symptoms, even among patients with acute ischemic cerebellar 
stroke.244,245 Thus, in patients who develop symptoms of obstructive hydrocephalus from a cerebellar stroke, 
emergency ventriculostomy is a reasonable first step in the surgical management paradigm. If cerebrospinal 
diversion by ventriculostomy fails to improve neurological function, decompressive suboccipital craniectomy 
should be performed.244–246 Although a risk of upward herniation exists with ventriculostomy alone, it can be 
minimized with conservative cerebrospinal fluid drainage or subsequent decompression if the cerebellar infarct 
causes significant edema or mass effect.244,245

2.  
Decompressive suboccipital craniectomy with dural expansion should 
be performed in patients with cerebellar infarction causing neurological 
deterioration from brainstem compression despite maximal medical 
therapy. When deemed safe and indicated, obstructive hydrocephalus 
should be treated concurrently with ventriculostomy.
I
B-NR
Recommendation revised from 2014 Cerebral 
Edema.
The data support decompressive cerebellar craniectomy for the management of acute ischemic cerebellar 
stroke with mass effect.244–246 This surgery is indicated as a therapeutic intervention in cases of neurological 
deterioration caused by cerebral edema as a result of cerebellar infarction that cannot be otherwise managed 
with medical therapy or ventriculostomy in the setting of obstructive hydrocephalus.244,245
See Table LIX in online Data Supplement 1.
3.  
When considering decompressive suboccipital craniectomy 
for cerebellar infarction, it may be reasonable to inform family 
members that the outcome after cerebellar infarct can be good after 
sub-occipital craniectomy.

4.  
Patients with large territorial supratentorial infarctions are at high risk 
for complicating brain edema and increased intracranial pressure. 
Discussion of care options and possible outcomes should take place 
quickly with patients (if possible) and caregivers. Medical professionals 
and caregivers should ascertain and include patient-centered 
preferences in shared decision making, especially during prognosis 
formation and considering interventions or limitations in care.
I
C-EO
New recommendation.
Cerebral edema can cause serious and even life-threatening complications in patients with large territorial 
supratentorial infarctions. Although less severe edema can be managed medically, surgical treatment may be the only 
effective option for very severe cases; in such instances, timely decompressive surgery has been shown to reduce 
mortality.247 Nevertheless, there is evidence that persistent morbidity is common and individual preexisting decisions 
about end-of-life and degree of treatment performed in the face of severe neurological injury must be considered.
 
5.  
Patients with major infarctions are at high risk for complicating brain 
edema. Measures to lessen the risk of edema and close monitoring of 
the patient for signs of neurological worsening during the first days 
after stroke are recommended. Early transfer of patients at risk for 
malignant brain edema to an institution with neurosurgical expertise 
should be considered.

Recommendation revised from 2013 AIS 
Guidelines. LOE revised.
6.  
In patients ≤60 years of age with unilateral MCA infarctions who  
deteriorate neurologically within 48 hours despite medical therapy, 
decompressive craniectomy with dural expansion is reasonable because 
it reduces mortality by close to 50%, with 55% of the surgical survivors 
achieving moderate disability (able to walk) or better (mRS score 2 or 3) 
and 18% achieving independence (mRS score 2) at 12 months.
IIa
A
Recommendation revised from 2014 Cerebral 
Edema.
The pooled results of RCTs demonstrated significant reduction in mortality when decompressive craniectomy 
was performed within 48 hours of malignant MCA infarction in patients <60 years of age, with an absolute risk 
reduction in mortality of 50% (95% CI, 34–66) at 12 months.247 These findings were noted despite differences 
in the clinical trials in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, percent of MCA territory involved, and surgical 
timing.248,249 At 12 months, moderate disability (ability to walk) or better (mRS score 2 or 3) was achieved in 43% 
(22 of 51) of the total surgical group and 55% (22 of 40) of survivors compared with 21% (9 of 42; P=0.045) of 
the total nonsurgical group and 75% (9 of 12; P=0.318) of the nonsurgical survivors. At 12 months, independence 
(mRS score 2) was achieved in 14% (7 of 51) of the total surgical group and 18% (7 of 40) of survivors compared 
with 2% (1 of 42) of the total nonsurgical group and 8% (1 of 12) of the nonsurgical survivors.245,247–250
See Tables LIX and LX in online Data 
Supplement 1.
7.  
In patients >60 years of age with unilateral MCA infarctions 
who deteriorate neurologically within 48 hours despite medical 
therapy, decompressive craniectomy with dural expansion may be 
considered because it reduces mortality by close to 50%, with 11% 
of the surgical survivors achieving moderate disability (able to walk 
[mRS score 3]) and none achieving independence (mRS score ≤2) 
at 12 months.
IIb
B-R
Recommendation revised from 2014 Cerebral 
Edema.
There is evidence that patients >60 years of age can have a reduction in mortality of ≈50% (76% in the 
nonsurgical group versus 42% in the surgical group in DESTINY [Decompressive Surgery for the Treatment 
of Malignant Infarction of the Middle Cerebral Artery] II) when decompressive craniectomy for malignant MCA 
infarction is performed within 48 hours of stroke onset.248,249,251–255 However, functional outcomes in elderly 
patients seem to be worse than those in patients <60 years of age. At 12 months, moderate disability (able 
to walk; mRS score 3) was achieved in 6% (3 of 47) of the total surgical group and 11% (3 of 27) of survivors 
compared with 5% (3 of 22) of the total nonsurgical group and 20% (3 of 15) of the nonsurgical survivors. At 
12 months, independence (mRS score ≤2) was not achieved by any survivors in either group.

IIa
C-EO
New recommendation.
Hyperventilation is a very effective treatment to rapidly improve brain swelling, but it works by inducing 
cerebral vasoconstriction, which can worsen ischemia if the hypocapnia is sustained or profound.256 Thus, 
hyperventilation should be induced rapidly but should be used as briefly as possible and avoid excessive 
hypocapnia (<30 mm Hg).

Hypothermia or barbiturates in the setting of ischemic cerebral

The data on the use of hypothermia and barbiturates for the management of AIS continue to be limited. Such 
data include only studies with small numbers of patients and unclear timing of intervention with respect to 
stroke onset. Hypothermia use has recently been shown to have no impact on stroke outcomes in a meta-
analysis of 6 RCTs.257 Further research is recommended.
See Tables LIX and LX in online Data 
Supplement 1.
12.  
Because of a lack of evidence of efficacy and the potential to 
increase the risk of infectious complications, corticosteroids (in
