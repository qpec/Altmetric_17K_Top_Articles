Recently, we presented the cliff-edge model to explain the evo-
lutionary persistence of relatively high incidences of fetopelvic
disproportion (FPD) in human childbirth. According to this model,
the regular application of Caesarean sections since the mid-20th
century has triggered an evolutionary increase of fetal size rela-
tive to the dimensions of the maternal birth canal, which, in turn,
has inflated incidences of FPD. While this prediction is difficult
to test in epidemiological data on Caesarean sections, the model
also implies that women born by Caesarean because of FPD are
more likely to develop FPD in their own childbirth compared with
women born vaginally. Multigenerational epidemiological studies
indeed evidence such an intergenerational predisposition to surgi-
cal delivery. When confined to anatomical indications, these stud-
ies report risks for Caesarean up to twice as high for women born
by Caesarean compared with women born vaginally. These find-
ings provide independent support for our model, which we show
here predicts that the risk of FPD for mothers born by Caesarean
because of FPD is 2.8 times the risk for mothers born vaginally.
The congruence between these data and our prediction lends sup-
port to the cliff-edge model of obstetric selection and its under-
lying assumptions, despite the genetic and anatomical ideali-
zations involved.

ecently, we presented a mathematical model—the cliff-edge
model (1)—to explain the evolutionary persistence of the
relatively high incidences of cephalopelvic disproportion and
shoulder dystocia in human childbirth. We use the term
fetopelvic disproportion (FPD) to refer to both of these origins
of disproportion between fetal and maternal dimensions, with
reported incidences ranging from about 1 to 8% (2–4). In indus-
trialized countries, FPD usually leads to delivery by Caesarean
section (C-section) to prevent maternal and neonatal morbidity
or mortality.
The cliff-edge model is based on an idealized variable, D, that
represents the difference between the size of the neonate and
that of the maternal birth canal. Medical data document higher
survival rates for larger neonates (5, 6) and lower rates of pelvic
floor disorders in women with narrower pelvises (7, 8), and thus
an increase in reproductive success (i.e., evolutionary fitness)
with D. This directional selection toward larger D is counter-
balanced by obstetric selection: If neonatal size exceeds the size
of the birth canal (D > 0), fitness drops sharply in the absence
of medical care (9–13). For an approximately symmetrically dis-
tributed phenotype D, the balance between these selective forces
at the evolutionary stable state entails a constant rate of FPD
(Fig. 1 A and B).
With the safe availability of C-sections, obstetric selection has
diminished in most industrialized countries. As a result, the size
of the fetus relative to that of the birth canal is expected to
increase due to the remaining directional selection (Fig. 1C).
All other factors assumed constant, the cliff-edge model predicts
that, since the wide application of C-sections in the mid-20th cen-
tury, D has increased evolutionarily by about 0.04 to 0.08 stan-
dard deviations, inflating the initial FPD rate by 10 to 20%, which
is roughly half a percentage point (1, 14).
Our prediction, which has provoked wide response in the sci-
entific community and the public, is difficult to prove empirically,
because FPD is difficult to diagnose directly and the evolution-
ary increase of D may be concealed by countervailing factors
such as reduced gestational age (14). C-section rates—as indirect
measures—have increased, for a number of reasons other than
selection, from a few percent up to 20% or 30% in most countries
and vary significantly between countries, hospitals, sociocultural
groups, and age cohorts [e.g., refs. 15 and 16]. However, the cliff-
edge model also implies that women who were born by C-section
because of FPD are more like to develop FPD and to deliver by
Caesarean in their own childbirth, compared with women who
were born vaginally.
Multigenerational Model of FPD
In the cliff-edge model, the fraction of women who develop FPD
during childbirth (that is, with D > 0) is given by the area under
the probability density function beyond the cliff edge (the red
area in Fig. 1B), whereas women with D ≤ 0 have a birth canal
that can accommodate the fetus. Let us assume that both groups
of women mate randomly (with respect to D) with a male from
the full population and that maternal and paternal allele effects
recombine additively. Assume further an initial FPD rate of 2%,
which is in the lower range of reported data, and a heritability
of 0.5 for D based on studies of newborn intracranial volume
and maternal pelvic dimensions (1, 17–20). Then the model pre-
dicts that women who were born by Caesarean because of FPD
are 2.8 times more likely to develop FPD in their own childbirth
compared with women born vaginally (this equals a relative risk
or “risk ratio” of 2.8; see Methods and Fig. 2 for computational
details).
Significance
The cliff-edge model explains the evolutionary persistence of
relatively high incidences of fetopelvic disproportion (FPD),
the mismatch of fetal and maternal dimensions during human
childbirth. It also predicts that FPD rates have increased evolu-
tionarily since the regular use of Caesarean sections. Here we
show that the model also explains why women born by Cae-
sarean because of FPD are about twice as likely to develop FPD
in their own childbirth compared with women born vaginally.
This theoretical prediction of a complex epidemiological pat-
tern lends support to the cliff-edge model and its underlying
assumptions.

The cliff-edge model of obstetric selection. (A) The difference, D, between neonatal size and maternal pelvic canal size is approximately normally
distributed in a population (black curve) with mean µ (dashed line) and unit variance, which is assumed to stay constant. Individual female fitness (blue curve)
increases linearly with D to its maximum at D = 0; thereafter, fitness drops sharply (without C-section) because of FPD. This directional selection induces an
evolutionary increase of D. (B) In evolutionary theory, natural selection maximizes average population fitness (average number of offspring per individual).
Because of the asymmetric “cliff-edged” fitness function, the trait mean that maximizes population fitness always entails a fraction of individuals with FPD,
i.e., with D > 0 (the red area). This fraction does not depend on the scale and sexual dimorphism of D, but increases with the genetic correlation between the
sexes (for more details, see ref. 1). (C) C-sections remove the fitness threshold at D = 0, thus leading to a further evolutionary increase of D and the resulting
FPD rate.
This risk ratio well above 2 should be easily detectable in
multigenerational epidemiological data. Note that this predic-
tion refers to Caesareans caused by FPD only, not to elective
Caesareans or to those carried out for other reasons. However,
owing to the difficulty of diagnosing FPD, most epidemiolog-
ical data are either about C-section rates or, more generally,
about obstructed labor or dystocia. Because surgical delivery and
dystocia can result from numerous other reasons than FPD—
including psychological, social, and other biological factors (21–
23)—the risk ratio for Caesarean/dystocia between women deliv-
ered by Caesarean/dystocia and those who were not is expected
to lie below our prediction.
Multigenerational Epidemiology of C-Section
Algovik et al. (24) studied the incidence of dystocia (obstructed
or delayed labor) in more than 2.5 million individuals from
the Swedish Birth, Twin, and National Family Registers. They
reported that mothers who were born with dystocia had 1.66
times the risk of developing dystocia in their own labor compared
with a mother born without dystocia. The authors identified a
negligible influence of the shared environment between relatives
but a strong effect of the nonshared environment. Similarly, in
48,000 Swedish mother–child pairs, Berg-Lek˚
as et al. (25) found
that, if a mother had dystocia (resulting in instrumental interven-
tion) when delivering her eldest daughter, this daughter faced a
risk ratio of 1.8 for developing dystocia during her own first child-
birth. Both studies, however, did not differentiate between the
different reasons for obstructed labor.
Fig. 2.
Multigenerational model of FPD. (A) The black curve represents the normal distribution of D, with mean µ = −2.05 (black dashed line) and unit SD,
entailing an FPD rate of 2% (the fraction of individuals with D > 0, represented by the red shaded area). These mothers delivering by Caesarean because of
FPD (D > 0) have a mean of µC = 0.37 (gray dashed line) and an SD of σC = 0.33. (B) These mothers mate with a male from the full distribution centered at
µ = −2.05, and thus their offspring—the generation born through Caesarean—has intermediate trait mean µ�
C = −1.45 and SD σ�
C = 0.88, resulting in an
FPD rate of 5.03% (the red area). (C) Women born vaginally, by contrast, have a mother with D ≤ 0 and a father from the original distribution, leading to
a mean µ�
V = −2.07 and variance σ�
V = 0.99 with a 1.82% FPD rate (red area). Hence, mothers born by Caesarean because of FPD have a 5.03/1.82 = 2.77
times higher risk of developing FPD in their own childbirth than mothers born vaginally.
Toll˚
anes et al. (26) studied C-sections in more than 440,000
Norwegian grandmother–parent units. A mother born by Cae-
sarean had 1.55 times the risk of having her first child by
Caesarean compared with a mother born vaginally. This associa-
tion was not found for fathers born by C-section; their partners
showed no increased risk of having their first child by Caesarean.
When confining the analysis to a low-risk subgroup that excluded
women with “a record of pre-eclampsia, pregestational diabetes,
breech delivery, abruptio placentae, placenta previa or dystocia,”
as well as units with birth weights below 2,500 g or above 4,500 g
or a gestational age below 37 wk or above 42 wk, this risk ratio
even increased to 2.06. The presence of detectable association in
grandmother–mother units but not in grandmother–father units
indicates that “social inheritance” of C-section is weak, at least
via the father.
In a study of operative delivery in more than half a million
cases from Utah, Varner et al. (2) distinguished cephalopelvic
disproportion from dysfunctional and prolonged labor. Pooled
over all these indications, a woman who was herself delivered
by Caesarean had 1.41 times the risk of delivering by Caesarean
compared with a woman born vaginally. The subgroup delivered
by Caesarean because of cephalopelvic disproportion (limited to
pregnancies with vertex presentation) faced a risk ratio of 1.83 of
delivering their own children by Caesarean.
Conclusions
The evolutionary increase of FPD rates as predicted by the cliff-
edge model is difficult to observe in epidemiological data on

operative delivery. However, the model also implies that women
who were born by Caesarean because of FPD face an increased
risk of developing FPD in their own childbirth. Based on the
above-mentioned assumptions, the model predicts a risk ratio of
2.8, an effect size much larger than that of the predicted evolu-
tionary change.
Large-scale epidemiological studies indeed evidence that
women born by C-section are more likely to deliver by Cae-
sarean than women born vaginally, owing primarily to genetic
rather than social factors. When pooling over all of the different
causes for Caesarean and dystocia, the reported risk ratios range
from 1.4 to 1.8. These estimates are below our prediction of
2.8, which specifically refers to Caesareans caused by the dispro-
portion of anatomical dimensions. Social and other nonanatom-
ical reasons for Caesarean delivery, including presentation of
the fetus, that show little or no heritability deflate these empiri-
cal estimates of intergenerational predisposition. After excluding
many nonanatomical factors of dystocia in Toll˚
anes et al. (26),
and also in Varner et al. (2), who calculated risks specifically for
cephalopelvic disproportion, the reported risk ratios were close
to 2. This is closer to our prediction but still underestimated due
to the difficulties in diagnosing FPD.
In summary, these estimated risk ratios fit well to the predic-
tion of the cliff-edge model: They are below the prediction but
in the same order of magnitude. This congruence of empirical
data and the prediction lends support to the cliff-edge model
of obstetric selection and its underlying assumptions, despite the
genetic and anatomical idealizations involved.
Methods
Let the difference, D, between fetal size and pelvic canal size be normally
distributed with unit SD (the latter choice does not restrict generality):
P(D) = P(D, µ, σ) ∼ N(µ, 1). FPD occurs iff D > 0; hence an FPD rate of r = 2%
implies a mean of µ = −2.05 (Fig. 2A),
r =
� ∞
0
P(D, −2.05, 1)dD = 0.02.
Based on this simple model, we want to estimate the FPD rate in the off-
spring of these 2% of women who delivered by Caesarean due to FPD,
and compare it to the FPD rate in the offspring of the 98% of women
who delivered vaginally. We thereby assume that women from both groups
mate randomly with respect to D with a male from the full distribution
P(D, −2.05, 1). Furthermore, we assume additivity of maternal and pater-
nal alleles with no genotype-by-environment interaction and parent-of-
origin effect.
The mothers with D > 0 who delivered by C-section have the mean
µC = 1

P(D, −2.05, 1)D dD = 0.37

[2]
The mean phenotypic difference between these parents and their off-
spring can be expressed via the breeder’s equation, that is, as the prod-
uct of the “selection differential” and the heritability (27). In standard
quantitative genetic contexts, the selection differential is the difference
between the average phenotypes before and after selection in one gen-
eration. In our case, the average phenotype before selection is µ = −2.05,
while the average phenotype after selection is
1
2 (µC + µ) because half
of the individuals (the mothers) are from the “selected” distribution with
µC = 0.37 and the other half (the fathers) are from the full distribution
centered at µ = −2.05. The selection differential thus is 1
2 (µC + µ) − µ =
1
2 (µC − µ). In Mitteroecker et al. (1), we assumed a heritability of h2 = 0.5
for D, based on studies of newborn intracranial volume and pelvic dimen-
sions. Thus, the mean offspring phenotype of the mothers delivering by
Caesarean equals
µ�
C = µ + 1
2 (µC − µ)h2 = −1.45.
[3]
These mothers who delivered by Caesarean represent just a small part of
the population with reduced genetic variance, whereas their mates—the
fathers—are chosen from the full distribution with unit variance. Under the
assumptions listed above, the phenotypic variance, σ2, can be expressed as
the sum of the variances of maternal and paternal allele effects plus the
environmental variance: σ2 = σ2
P + σ2
M + σ2
e, which totals 1 for the original
distribution of D. It follows that the genetic variance resulting from one
allele is given by
σ2
P = σ2
M = 1
2 h2σ2
[4]
for individuals from the original distribution, and
1
2 h2σ2
C
[5]
for the individuals with D > 0. The offspring of mothers with D > 0 and
fathers from the full distribution inherit one allele from each distribu-
tion; the genetic variance of this offspring thus equals the sum of the
terms [4] and [5]. It is likely that environmental heterogeneity stays simi-
lar across two generations; we thus assume that the environmental variance
remains (1−h2)σ2 in the offspring. The phenotypic variance of the offspring
thus is
σ�2
C = 1
2 h2σ2 + 1
2 h2σ2
C + (1 − h2)σ2
= 1
2 h2(σ2 + σ2
C) + σ2
e = 0.882.
[6]
A woman from this distribution has a 5.03% probability of developing FPD
in her own childbirth (Fig. 2B).
The mothers who delivered vaginally (D ≤ 0) have a mean of µV = −2.10
and SD of σV = 0.95, which follows from the according application of Eqs.
1 and 2. After random mating, their offspring has a mean of µ�
V = −2.07
and SD σ�
V = 0.99 (following Eqs. 3 and 6), which entails an FPD rate of
1.82% (Fig. 2C). That is, according to our model, a woman who was born
by Caesarean because of FPD shows 2.77 times the risk of developing FPD
herself, compared with a woman born vaginally (risk ratio 5.03/1.82 = 2.77).
This predicted risk ratio is independent of the scale of D, the maximum
individual fitness, and a constant sexual dimorphism. It is also robust against
small deviations of D from normality. The ratio decreases slightly when
increasing the initial FPD rate. For instance, raising the initial rate from 2
to 5% decreases the risk ratio from 2.77 to to 2.33. Note that this model
refers to the FPD rate, not to the rate of C-sections, which is, of course,
much higher and more variable.
