Abstract
Background: Despite significant declines in under five mortality (U5M) over the last 3 decades, Kenya did not
achieve Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG 4) by 2015. To better understand trends and inequalities in child
mortality, analysis of U5M variation at subnational decision making units is required. Here the comprehensive
compilation and analysis of birth history data was used to understand spatio-temporal variation, inequalities and
progress towards achieving the reductions targets of U5M between 1965 and 2013 and projected to 2015 at
decentralized health planning units (counties) in Kenya.
Methods: Ten household surveys and three censuses with data on birth histories undertaken between 1989 and
2014 were assembled. The birth histories were allocated to the respective counties and demographic methods
applied to estimate U5M per county by survey. To generate a single U5M estimate for year and county, a Bayesian
spatio-temporal Gaussian process regression was fitted accounting for variation in sample size, surveys and
demographic methods. Inequalities and the progress in meeting the goals set to reduce U5M were evaluated
subnationally.
Results: Nationally, U5M reduced by 61·6%, from 141·7 (121·6–164·0) in 1965 to 54·5 (44·6–65·5) in 2013. The
declining U5M was uneven ranging between 19 and 80% across the counties with some years when rates
increased. By 2000, 25 counties had achieved the World Summit for Children goals. However, as of 2015, no county
had achieved MDG 4. There was a striking decline in the levels of inequality between counties over time, however,
disparities persist. By 2013 there persists a 3·8 times difference between predicted U5M rates when comparing
counties with the highest U5M rates against those with the lowest U5M rates.
Conclusion: Kenya has made huge progress in child survival since independence. However, U5M remains high and
heterogeneous with substantial differences between counties. Better use of the current resources through focused
allocation is required to achieve further reductions, reduce inequalities and increase the likelihood of achieving
Sustainable Development Goal 3·2 on U5M by 2030.

Background
Under-five mortality (U5M), the probability that a child
will die before reaching the age of five, is a benchmark of
a country’s health status and progress towards achieve-
ment of development goals [1, 2]. Tracking U5M as part
of international development targets began with the
World Summit for Children in 1990, which set goals to
reduce U5M by a third and/or to 70 per 1000 live births
between 1990 and 2000 [3]. This was followed by the Mil-
lennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 that proposed a re-
duction of U5M by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015 [4].
Currently, as part of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), goal 3·2 seeks to end preventable deaths of chil-
dren under-5 years of age and to reduce U5M to 25 per
1000 live births by 2030 [5].
It has been estimated that there has been a 53% re-
duction in U5M globally between 1990 and 2015 [1, 6].
The slowest reductions in U5M were observed in

 sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Only 11 countries out of 48
in SSA achieved the MDG 4 target by 2015 [6]. Inter-
national benchmarking of national U5M developments
goals has improved with time, with increasing data and
improved methodologies. In recent years, new method-
ologies have been applied to understand within-country
temporal and spatial heterogeneity in child survival [7].
However, examples of how U5M has changed at sub-
national levels remains limited to only a few SSA coun-
tries and imperfectly described [8–12]. In all countries,
disease burdens are expected to be concentrated in a
few sub-national areas; identification of these areas and
directing suitable interventions to these areas will ac-
celerate national child mortality reductions and ensure
effective and equitable resource allocation.
Sub-national variations of child survival in Kenya were
first described during the 1980s [13–16]. Advances in
spatio-temporal statistics and analysis of multiple demo-
graphic datasets have provided new opportunities to study
spatial and temporal heterogeneities of child survival
across Kenya [1, 7, 17, 18]. However, recent analyses have
not harnessed all the available sample surveys and census
data, nor have they always provided annual predictions at
sub-national units required for decentralized policy mak-
ing since Kenya’s independence. In addition, assessments
of progress towards achieving global milestones and redu-
cing inequalities in U5M at subnational units has not been
attempted in Kenya.
Here the analysis of all available birth history data
from household surveys and population census data is
presented to provide annual predicted quantities of
U5M since 1965 at each of Kenya’s counties created in
2010 for decentralized health agenda. The estimated
rates were used to express spatial and temporal hetero-
geneities in demographic transitions toward sub-na-
tional U5M goals and the long-term inequalities in
child survival.
Methods
Country context
At the turn of the last century, the U5M rate was approxi-
mately 250 deaths per 1000 live births in Kenya [14]. Fol-
lowing the establishment of a rudimentary health system,
U5M had declined to about 239 per 1000 live births by
1962 [13, 14]. After independence in 1963, the govern-
ment adopted socio-economic policies to alleviate hunger,
ignorance and disease via the creation of equal opportun-
ities for all citizens and an equitable distribution of wealth
opportunities [19].
Twenty years after independence, Kenya began to
launch policies to specifically improve child survival, not-
ably in line with the Alma-Ata declaration in 1978 on pri-
mary health care. The Kenya expanded programme on
immunization (EPI) was established in 1980 to coordinate
immunization services for six childhood killer diseases, at
the time including tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, whoop-
ing cough, tetanus and measles [20]. However, during the
late 1980s through to late 1990s, Kenya was affected by in-
creasing prevalence of HIV [21], reintroductions of user
fees in 1992 [22], poor coverage of basic healthcare ser-
vices [23] and re-emerging malaria epidemics as a result
of widespread resistance to Chloroquine [24].
At the beginning of 2000, there were numerous re-
productive,
maternal,
newborn
and
child
health
(RMNCH) policies aligning the health agenda with
MDGs [23, 25]. Additional vaccines including Yellow
fever, Hepatitis B and Haemophilus Influenza B type
were added to the EPI bundle and user fees abolished
in peripheral health facilities in 2004. Intensified ef-
forts against malaria were mobilized under the Roll
Back Malaria (RBM) initiative including replacing fail-
ing drugs with efficacious artemisinin-based combin-
ation (ACT) drugs and expanded, free delivery of
insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) from 2006 [26, 27].
Free preventative interventions for HIV including pre-
venting mother-to-child transmission and antiretro-
viral therapy were also expanded significantly from
2006 [21]. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was intro-
duced in 2011 while rotavirus and measles second dose
vaccines were introduced in 2014 and 2013 respect-
ively. Since 2013, all services at government outpatient
facilities and maternity services have been offered free
of charge [22]. In addition, there has been renewed in-
terests in expanding primary healthcare services as
close to homesteads as possible through the Malezi
Bora (good upbringing) initiative [28], the Beyond Zero
[29] initiative and the universal health systems initia-
tive focusing on RMNCH services among the under-
served population [30].
2010 was a landmark year for Kenya when a new con-
stitution was adopted which revised units of administra-
tion and health planning to 47 county governments
(Fig. 1), including county ministries of health with broad
policy directions maintained at the national level. The
decentralized system came into effect in 2013 after the
general elections and now represent units for federal
policy planning to support the SDGs [31]. The counties
cover variable climatic, ecological, socio-economic and
infrastructure conditions. These dissimilarities govern
the rainfall patterns, agricultural activities and human
settlement with the highest population densities in the
counties around Lake Victoria, central and the coastal
areas while the southern and northern areas of Kenya
are sparsely populated.
Data assembly
The ambition of U5M data assembly was to resolve all
available data at sub-national resolutions (county) over

 time. Sample household survey and population census data
with either summary birth history (SBH) and/or complete
birth history (CBH) collected between 1989 and 2014 in
Kenya were assembled (Additional file 1). All the datasets
were reconciled to the 47 counties boundaries (Fig. 1) as
they were spatially misaligned over time (Additional file 2).
The birth histories, maternal age, and/or time since first
birth were collected through questions posed to women
aged between 15 and 49 years. CBH records the date of
each live birth and the date of death for those who had not
survived while SBH records aggregated information on
children ever born alive and who had since died [32]. Thir-
teen (13) national and/or sub-national datasets were avail-
able from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS)
data archive [33], Integrated Public Use Microdata Series
(IPUMS) [34], Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS)
[35] and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) [36]
data portal (Table 1).

 Under five mortality computation
The household surveys and censuses data included vari-
ous levels of information (Table 1). One direct and four
independent indirect demographic methods were used
to analyze CBH and SBH data respectively (Add-
itional file 3). Using the direct method, the months a
child lived before death or age five were allocated to six
age-groups [0–1, 1–11, 12–23, 24–35, 36–47, 48–59
months] and two-year time-periods. The monthly prob-
ability of survival (P) was calculated as the ratio of
deaths to the number of months lived in each group and
period raised to a power equal to the number of months
in the age-group. U5M for each period (q5t) was com-
puted by subtracting from one the product of survival
probabilities per period [32, 37] (Eq. 1) (Additional file
3). National trends were analyzed using the direct
method since CBH does not require a life table model
and the surveys are representative nationally.

The four indirect techniques included, two cohort
and two period methods, indexed by either maternal
age or time since first birth [32] adapted from Brass/
Trussell models converting the proportion of children
dead (CD) to an U5M rate [38]. Using the cohort ap-
proach, women were grouped in 5-year cohorts of age
or time since first birth, the CD was computed per
cohort and converted to U5M rate using eq. 2. The re-
gression coefficients (β1i − β4i) and the country random
effect (Uij) were generated from CBH obtained from
household surveys across SSA [32] (Additional file 3).

Where (j) indexes a country, (k) a survey, (i) a cohort,
CD is children dead, CEB is Children Ever Born while
(P) are parity ratios.
Limitations in the cohort approach were addressed
through period techniques that account for U5M ex-
periences of both young and older women when cal-
culating U5M estimates for the most recent time
and generating predictions for up to 25 years prior
to a survey unlike
cohort’s 18 years [32]. Period
methods generates children dead and children ever
born for each year prior to the survey and converts
it to a population level U5M (Eq. 3). The maternal
age and time since first birth regional empirical dis-
tributions of births and deaths were used to redis-
tribute reported births and deaths from each survey
and census. The CD was computed and converted to
an U5M rate for years prior to the survey using

Estimations were done in StataCorp. 2014 [Stata Statis-
tical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp
LP] by survey and county without pooling data to avoid
over-smoothing of trends and allow detection of data
quality issues on a case by case basis. Cohort methods
allowed for the computation of U5M rates up to 18 years
prior to a survey while period methods allowed for predic-
tion of up to 25 years before the survey [32]. Due to the
diversity of methods and data sources used, for each
county for any single time point, there were multiple esti-
mates of U5M requiring spatio-temporal modelling to
smooth trends.
Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling
In order to borrow the strength of information in U5M
estimates across time and space, while accounting for
heterogeneity between surveys and the different tech-
niques used for U5M estimation, a Bayesian spatio-
temporal Gaussian process regression model [39, 40]
with a heteroscedastic error component was developed
(Eq. 4). Specifically, the latter was modelled as a Gauss-
ian noise (Zijkt) whose variance was the product of the
log-transformed sample
size
from
a given
survey,
county and year, and a second factor that accounts for
the variability inherent to the demographic methods
used to quantify U5M. The log of the sample size was
used in order to obtain equally distributed weights to
borrow information across all surveys and avoid exces-
sive overweighting of the census data. The spatio-tem-
poral
correlation
was
specified
using
a
separable
structure, given by the product of a conditionally auto-
regressive structure in space and an autoregressive
process of the first order in time (Additional file 3).

A Gaussian distribution was used for the logit-trans-
formed U5M (Qijkt) from the ith survey (n = 13), based on
demographic method j (n = 5) for the kth county (n = 47)
and year t (n = 49), 1965–2013. Skt is a spatio-temporal
Gaussian process and Zijkt is Gaussian noise.
The model was fitted using a bespoke Markov Chain
Monte Carlo algorithm, developed in the R software
environment (Version 3·4·1), that generated 10,000
predictive samples of smoothed U5M rates by county
and year. To reduce the between-samples correlation,
the algorithm was iterated for 110,000 times and
retained every 10th sample after a burn-in of 10,000
samples. To assess the predictive performance of the
model, a cross-validation procedure was used with a
randomly selected hold-out sample containing 10% of
the observed U5M rates for each possible combination
of surveys and estimation methods. The root-mean-
square-error
and
the
bias
were
then
used
to
summarize the accuracy and precision of the U5M
model-based estimates.
The U5M posterior distribution was summarized by
computing it’s mean and 95% credible intervals (CI) for
each year between 1965 and 2013. 2013 was the last year
with reliable data to allow prediction of U5M [41]. Using
the posterior mean, the annual rate of reduction (ARR)
was estimated at national and county level between 2000
and 2013 by assuming an exponential function in the
change between the two-time points [42] (Additional file
3). The progress of the 47 counties in meeting the targets
set during the World Summit for Children [3] between
1990 and 2000 was then assessed. Achievement of the
MDG 4 [4] by 2015 was evaluated using projections com-
puted
via 2000–2013 AAR
assuming the trajectory
remained constant. Finally, the inequality in U5M across
the counties between 1965 and 2013 was calculated by
adapting the Palma’s inequality ratio [43] and computing
the ratio as the average of U5M of 40% of the counties
with the high U5M divided by the average U5M of 10% of
counties with low U5M since 1965. The results were
mapped in ArcMap 10·5 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA).
Results
The data assembled included ten sample household
surveys and three population censuses carried out be-
tween 1989 and 2014 covering 460 county-years, 1·14
million households and 1·62 million women aged be-
tween 15 and 49 years (Table 1). The demographic
methods and the spatio-temporal model allowed for 49
years of temporal predictions from 1965 to 2013 across
all 47 counties. Overall, at the national level, there was
a 61·6% reduction in the mean rate of U5M over 49
years from a rate of 141·7 (95% CI: 121·6–164·0) deaths
per 1000 live births in 1965 to 54·5 (44·6–65·5) per
1000 live births in 2013 (Fig. 2). There were two pe-
riods of substantial decline over the 49 years from the
early 1970s to late 1980s and early 2000 to 2013 with
U5M appearing to stagnate and/or reverse during the
1990s. The highest ARR (4·5% [4·0–5·1]) was recorded
between 2000 and 2013, 2·5 times faster relative to the
rate of reduction in 1965–1988 (1·8% [1·5–2·0]). At a
national level, the goals set out in the World Summit
for Children were not achieved by 2000; the estimated
Macharia et al. BMC Public Health          (2019) 19:146 
Page 5 of 12
 U5M rate in 2000 was 99·3 (95% CI: 88·3–111·7) per
1000 live births against a target of 70 deaths per 1000
live births. The overall change between 1990 and 2000
was a 3·3% (Fig. 2) reduction, far short of the 33.3% target.
Additionally, using the 2015 projected U5M rates, the
two-thirds (66.67%) reduction target set as part of MDG 4
was not achieved nationally despite an overall reduction of
48·3% (43·6–53·1) between 1990 and 2015 (Fig. 2).
These national estimates mask important sub-na-
tional differences in U5M rates over time (Fig. 3). His-
torically the highest mortality rates are those in the
coastal areas, the arid and semi-arid areas around Lake
Turkana and those around the Lake Victoria region
(Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). The mean mortality rates in 1965
ranged from over 200 per 1000 live births in 11 coun-
ties to between 50 and 75 per 1000 live births in four
counties. Overall, using 1965 as a baseline, by 2013, 23
counties had ≥60% decline in U5M rates, while a fur-
ther 14 counties reduced U5M rates by at least a half
(Additional file 4). All the counties except Nyeri and
Nairobi had an overall reduction greater than a third
(Additional file 4). By 2013, high mortality counties
relative to the national average, continued to persist
around Lake Victoria and the Tana river.
While the country did not achieve any of the goals set
to reduce mortality rates in children below five years,
there are some counties that achieved some of the goals
(Table 2). Those that had an U5M rate of less than 70
per 1000 live births by 2000 included 24 counties
(Mandera, Marsabit, Meru, Embu, Machakos, Makueni,
Nyandarua, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Murang’a, Kiambu, West
Pokot, Samburu, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo
Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia, Nakuru, Narok, Kajiado,
Kericho and Bomet). However, only two counties (Isiolo
and Elgeyo Marakwet) had at least a third reduction in
U5M rates between 1990 and 2000. No county in
Western and Coast provinces achieved these targets
compared to all counties in Central province and
Nairobi that attained the targets set during the World
Summit for Children to reduce U5M rates to ≤70 per
1000 live births by 2000 and/or a one-third reduction
between 1990 and 2000 (Table 2).
No county achieved a two-thirds reduction in U5M
rates between 1990 and 2015 (MDG 4) based on pro-
jections made to 2015, however, nine counties had re-
ductions ≥50%, 34 reduced by at least 25% while four
counties had reductions < 25% (Table 2). Whilst the na-
tional and sub-national MDG 4 was not achieved by
2015, more than half (25) of the counties reduced U5M
by at least a third, while 30 had U5M rates below 70
per 1000 live births by 2015 achieving goals set during
the World Summit for Children in 1990. Despite the

methods. The 2014–2015 U5M rates were computed using the average annual rate of reduction between 2000 and 2013 and shown as a dotted

 goals being achieved in only some of the counties, 2015
projections show mean mortality rates remain relatively
low (< 50 deaths per 1000 live births) in 21 counties
(Nyeri, Kiambu, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Wajir,
Mandera, Marsabit, Isiolo, Machakos, Makueni, West
Pokot, Samburu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nandi, Baringo,
Laikipia, Narok, Kajiado, Kericho, Bomet and Nyamira)
(Table 2). Hence by 2015, no county had U5M rates of
≤25 per 1000 live births, the target for 2030 (SDG 3.2).
However, there were some notable exceptions during
the MDG period (1990–2015), where U5M rates in-
creased relative to the 1990 rates. Counties in the Cen-
tral province (Murang’a, Kiambu, Kirinyaga and Nyeri)

(Laikipia,
Nakuru,
Embu,
Nairobi) had small upsurges between 1990 and 1995.
By 2010–2013, the reversal had spread outwards to
other counties in Central province, Coast (Kilifi and
Mombasa), Eastern (Machakos, Makueni, Tharaka Nithi
and Meru) and the south part of Rift Valley Province
(Narok and Kajiado). The overall percentage increase in
these eight counties ranged from 5·3 in Nairobi to 32·7
per 1000 live births in Nyandarua county between 1990
and 2015 (Table 2). The Additional file 5 has detailed
county profiles and the corresponding 95% CIs graphs
for each of the 47 counties.
On average, the gap between the highest and lowest re-
corded rates of U5M across Kenyan counties reduced by
58·6% (57·7–59·2), however, it was compounded by high
magnitude of heterogeneity over time. By 2013, the ratio
between the highest and lowest U5M rates was 3·8 (3·7–
4·1) from a ratio of 5·0 (4·9–5·2) in 1965. The inequality
index was high in the 1960s reduced marginally to 1970s
then increased and remained high in the mid-1980s to
mid-1990s. From mid-1990, the inequalities have declined
dramatically through to 2013 (Fig. 4). Values recorded in
2013 shows that high inequality continues to exist notably
in Western and Nyanza Provinces (Fig. 4).
Discussion
In Kenya, shortly after independence, one in every seven
Kenyan children born alive, died before the age of five,
49 years later, mortality has declined significantly, but

classified into six classes of < 50 (dark green), 50 - < 75 (light green), 75 - < 100 (light yellow), 100 - < 150 (brown), 150 - < 200 (red), and ≥ 200

 remains high, with one in every 19 children not reaching
their fifth birthday (Fig. 2). The progress towards improv-
ing child survival has been uneven within Kenya’s borders,
with high rates of reduction in some areas and intractable
slow progress in others (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). Progress in
meeting international goals aimed at reducing U5M has
been less than optimal. Nationally, Kenya has not reached
international goals set to reduce U5M rate by 2000
(World Summit for Children Goals) or 2015 (MDG 4)
(Fig. 2), while only 25 counties met the 2000 goals, and
none achieved the MDG 4 by 2015 (Table 2).
The declines in U5M started shortly after independ-
ence, through to 1988. Reductions coincide with efforts
to establish policies to support economic growth, miti-
gate against high fertility rates and rapid population
growth rates past independence in 1963 [44]. The stag-
nation of U5M rates and subsequent rise witnessed be-
tween 1988 and 2000 coincided with the increasing
spread of the HIV epidemic and poverty [21, 45], low
immunization coverage rates, poor quality of childcare
[23], reintroduction of user fees [22], poor coverage of
healthcare services, insufficient health workforce, a re-
duced focus on RMNCH [23, 25] and resurgent malaria
epidemics driven by El Niño rainfall anomalies and
escalating drug resistance [24, 46]. From 2000 through
to 2013, influential strategic changes to support health
financing and access to healthcare, more vaccines and
other preventive measures, effective medicines for mal-
aria control and scaleup of interventions to control and
manage HIV all led to a dramatic change in effective
health service access [21–27].
Understanding
the
relative
contributions
of
the
broad health sector changes to sub-national U5M re-
ductions is difficult, however, what is clear is that the
U5M transitions have not been equal between coun-
ties and over time. The counties with the highest
levels of U5M in 1965–1970 experienced the greatest
reductions while those with lower starting levels had
smaller changes observed over the 49-year period.
Children born in Homa Bay county were 5 times as
likely to die before age 5 as children born in Nyeri
county in 1965 and reduced to 3·8 times by 2013. The
Western part of the country was the worst place to be
born and remained the most disadvantaged through to
2013. These are areas characterized by high HIV
prevalence [21] and intense malaria transmission [46].
Conversely high U5M in Northern part of the country,
especially Turkana county, could be explained by

are differentiated by shapes; Coast (ӿ), North Eastern (♦), Eastern (+), Central (▲), Rift valley (●), Western (x), Nyanza (■) and Nairobi (−) and

U5M with the U5M of 10% of counties with low U5M between 1965 and 2013

 harsh arid conditions leading to food insecurity and
malnutrition [47].
Child mortality related inequalities have been docu-
mented across different socio-economic groupings (e.g.
disparities in wealth, education etc.) as well as across
geographic units [48]. Here the focus was on spatio-tem-
poral inequalities between counties from 1965 to 2013
(Fig. 4) because spatial inequality links health outcomes
to characteristics of a place that poverty or urban/rural
taxonomies cannot highlight [49]. The cross-county in-
equalities were wide spread from 1965 to early 1970s
and coincided with a phase when the Kenyan govern-
ment was fighting poverty, ignorance and disease [13].
While U5M was decreasing during the 1980s, the exist-
ing inequalities were exacerbated and coincided with
increasing HIV prevalence and rampant poverty across
the country [45]. Conversely, inequalities started to de-
cline in the early 1990s and linked to huge reductions in
the differences between counties with low and high
U5M rates and were sustained through to 2013. How-
ever, differences recorded in 2013 are still unacceptable
and focus on reducing U5M in these high burden areas
will narrow the gap.
Mortality rates in some of the counties of Central prov-
ince appear to have stalled, stagnated, or reversed in most
recent periods especially after 2003 (Additional file 5).
These counties had low starting U5M level in 1965, expe-
rienced the smallest overall decline and despite the mar-
ginal increases in the recent years, they still have lower
U5M levels relative to counties in Western areas of Kenya.
Table 2 Progress of the 47 counties in meeting global under five mortality (U5M) reduction targets set during the World Summit
for Children and the Millennium Development Goal 4 including the 2000, 2013 and 2015 projections U5M rates in Kenya
Counties that achieved the targets are shown in green, amber shows those that missed the target by a small margin (20%), while red indicates counties that
missed the target with a large margin. The numbers (Fig. 1) and colors (Fig. 4) indicate the counties while the shapes (Fig. 4) indicate the 8 provinces of Kenya
Macharia et al. BMC Public Health          (2019) 19:146

 The lower U5M rates might be explained by fertile lands
supporting agriculture, economic and political stability,
low prevalence of HIV and malaria. It is plausible that the
residual deaths in these counties are those that occur dur-
ing the first month of life accounting for about 45% of all
under five deaths [50]. The continued declines in the
other parts of Kenya are likely due to the deaths that
occur outside the first month of life, however, further ana-
lysis is needed to establish the drivers’ behind the recent
rises and or stagnation in Central Kenya.
Projections to 2015 were undertaken for each county
(Table 2) using the 2000–2013 trajectory rates to track
progress across the MDG period. However, no county
achieved MDG 4, and given ambitious 2030 targets, add-
itional targeted efforts are required. Projections to 2030
were not attempted due to concerns regarding long-term
projections using insufficient data; the year for which
the projections are made should lie closer to the actual
year of the most recent data [51]. Finally, the heteroge-
neous patterns in U5M observed in time and space are
likely to be ascribed to uneven distribution, access and
utilization of interventions and resources. This requires
further evaluations to better explain and quantify spe-
cific contributions of these differences to these observed
trends.
Conclusion
In conclusion, substantial progress in reducing U5M over
time was witnessed subnationally, especially since 2000.
However, the rates of progress were slow and unequal
across counties and as a result, the progress towards
achieving international child survival targets remains
sub-optimal across counties and over time. Huge spatio-
temporal inequalities continue to persist with substantial
gaps between the best and worst performing counties.
The estimates generated can be used as a baseline for
long-term monitoring and tracking progress and to in-
form better and efficient allocation of the resources
through policies and programs that allow for equitable
progress within the decentralized health planning struc-
ture in Kenya.
