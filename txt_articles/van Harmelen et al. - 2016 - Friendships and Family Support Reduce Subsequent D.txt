Abstract
Background
Early life stress (ELS) consists of child family adversities (CFA: negative experiences that
happened within the family environment) and/or peer bullying. ELS plays an important role
in the development of adolescent depressive symptoms and clinical disorders. Identifying
factors that may reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents with ELS may have important
public mental health implications.
Methods
We used structural equation modelling and examined the impact of adolescent friendships
and/or family support at age 14 on depressive symptoms at age 17 in adolescents exposed
to ELS before age 11. To this end, we used structural equation modelling in a community
sample of 771 adolescents (322 boys and 477 girls) from a 3 year longitudinal study. Signifi-
cant paths in the model were followed-up to test whether social support mediated or moder-
ated the association between ELS and depressive symptoms at age 17.
Results
We found that adolescent social support in adolescence is negatively associated with sub-
sequent depressive symptoms in boys and girls exposed to ELS. Specifically, we found evi-
dence for two mediational pathways: In the first pathway family support mediated the link
between CFA and depressive symptoms at age 17. Specifically, CFA was negatively asso-
ciated with adolescent family support at age 14, which in turn was negatively associated
with depressive symptoms at age 17. In the second pathway we found that adolescent
friendships mediated the path between peer bullying and depressive symptoms.

 Specifically, relational bullying was negatively associated with adolescent friendships at
age 14, which in turn were negatively associated with depressive symptoms at age 17. In
contrast, we did not find a moderating effect of friendships and family support on the associ-
ation between CFA and depressive symptoms.
Conclusions
Friendships and/or family support in adolescence mediate the relationship between ELS
and late adolescent depressive symptoms in boys and girls. Therefore, enhancing affiliate
relationships and positive family environments may benefit the mental health of vulnerable
youth that have experienced CFA and/or primary school bullying.
Introduction
Adolescence is a key developmental time where the incidence and prevalence of mental ill-
nesses such as major depression (MD) increases considerably[1]. It is well established that
exposure to negative experiences within the family environment (childhood family adversities;
CFA) increases risk for depressive symptomatology[2–4]. CFA may include negative parenting
styles, emotional, physical, sexual abuse, lack of affection or engagement, family discord, finan-
cial problems, family loss, criminality, unemployment, and parental psychopathology. Parent
child interactions set the stage for later peer interactions (see Pallini, Baiocco, Schneider, Madi-
gan, & Atkinson, 2014 for a meta-analysis). Indeed, CFA increases risk for (chronic) bullying
from peers[6–13]. One way through which CFA can increase risk for peer bullying is through
increased arousal and anxiety [14,15]which may be adaptive in negative family environments
but may be maladaptive in the outside world[16].
Bullying by peers is a similar toxic social experience that has been associated with subse-
quent mental illness (e.g.[17–20]), including increased risk for, and chronicity of, depressive
disorders (e.g.[21–26], with effects possibly being stronger in boys[27], although others did not
find gender effects[21]). Peer bullying may represent a key link between CFA and later depres-
sive symptoms[28], at least in children from low socio-economic backgrounds[29]. Impor-
tantly, the combined experience of CFA and peer bullying has been associated with increased
severity of depression symptoms[30]. Adolescent depression predicts a cascade of behavioural
and mental health problems, including recurrent depressive disorders and depression is a
major risk for suicide in adolescents [1]. Therefore, in order to reduce adolescent depression, it
is crucial to identify environmental factors that may increase resilience in adolescents who
have experienced CFA and/or peer bullying
As childhood progresses into adolescence, social environments widen and friendships
become increasingly important for social, and psychological development[31,32]. For this rea-
son, friendship support may be an especially important factor that may increase resilience in
vulnerable adolescents[33]. Several studies have examined the impact of adolescent friendships
on depressive symptoms in adolescents who have been exposed to CFA and/or peer bullying,
with mixed findings. For instance, in a cross-sectional study, adolescent friendships have been
associated with lower likelihood of depressive symptoms in boys[34]. Furthermore, adolescent
friendships were associated with higher rates of later life resilience (defined as the absence of
adult psychopathology over a 30 year time-period) in a small sample of abused individuals
[35].

 Supportive family environments may be another important social factor that may increase
adolescent resilience after CFA and/or peer bullying[33]. Studies that examined the impact of
positive parenting on depression in adolescents that reported CFA/ peer bullying indicate dif-
ferential findings. Abused individuals that reported at least one parent as caring in adolescence
had higher rates of adult resilience (defined as the absence of adult psychopathology over a 30
year time-period[35]). In line with these findings, adolescent bullying was associated with
increases in later adolescent depression, but only in those adolescents without supportive
parents[36]. Similarly, more positive parental quality was associated with reduced association
between peer stress (including bullying) and depressive symptoms[37]. Furthermore, maternal
warmth between ages 5–10 has been found to reduce the relationship between peer bullying in
primary school and emotional problems at age 10[38]. However, others only found that, in a
cross sectional design, supportive parents may reduce mental health difficulties in victimized
adolescent girls, but not in boys[39]. Finally, supportive parenting accounted for greater vari-
ance than CFA in depressive symptoms in adolescents[40]. Null effects were also reported in
the cross-sectional relationship between supportive parenting and peer bullying in boys[34],
and parental verbal affection did not mediate the relationship between CFA before the age of 6,
and psychiatric symptoms [41].
In sum, there are indications that adolescent friendships and supportive family environ-
ments may increase resilience in adolescents who have experienced peer bullying and/or CFA,
although there may be gender differences. However, these studies examined either friendship
support [37,42,43], or family support[38,40,44] in isolation, and unmeasured co-occurrence
between friendships and family support (e.g.[5,45]) may hamper the interpretability of these
findings. Other studies investigated CFA[40] or peer bullying[34] in isolation, despite the fact
that these two negative experiences co-occur frequently (e.g.[7]). A recent study in adolescents
aged 10–17 showed that current family support and friendship support were not related to cur-
rent distress after recent (past 2 years) poly-victimization (including bullying and CFA)[46].
However, this study did not examine early life CFA, nor peer bullying, nor did they disentangle
the specific relations of CFA and peer bullying with friendships and family support. Thus, to
our knowledge, no study has simultaneously examined the interplay of early life CFA and/or
peer bullying, and family support and/or friendships in adolescence on later adolescent depres-
sive symptoms.
Our study uses Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) in a longitudinal population based
community sample (N = 771; 322 boys and 477 girls) to examine the relations between CFA
and peer bullying before age 11, family and friendships at age 14, and depressive symptoms at
age 17. In addition, we also examine whether we find any evidence for gender-specific effects.
We expected that the social environment mediates the association between CFA/peer bullying
and depressive symptoms as peer bullying adversely affects future peer interactions[47,48], and
friendship difficulties increases depressive symptoms[32]. Furthermore, a negative family envi-
ronment is relatively persistent throughout childhood [49], and it is likely that CFA is associ-
ated with reduced family support in adolescence. Therefore, we choose SEM testing these
hypothesized mediation effects of friendship and/or family support after CFA and/or peer bul-
lying. Furthermore, significant paths in our model were followed up with specific mediation
analyses. In addition, as a moderating (‘Buffering’) hypothesis of social support has also been
suggested[33], we also tested whether we found support for such moderations (i.e. whether
social support reduces the association between CFA/peer bullying and depressive symptoms at
age 17).
Finally, there are indications that depressive symptoms may form antecedents to negative
peer relations [24,50], thus it is vital that sequential events are examined when investigating the
impact of the social environment on late adolescent depression. To examine the temporal

 dynamics of our findings, we also examined longitudinal effects of adolescent support on
depressive symptoms in later life. We chose to use a cross-lagged SEM as this allowed us to
simultaneously assess the effects of family support, depression symptoms, and friendships over
time (from age 14 to 17). This also allows us to test the reverse hypothesis that higher depres-
sion symptoms at age 14 are associated with reduced friendships and family support at age 17,
which could explain associations between family support and friendships at age 14 and depres-
sion symptoms at age 17.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Participants were drawn from the ROOTS study; a 3-year longitudinal study of adolescent
development in 1238 participants from 18 Cambridgeshire secondary schools between Novem-
ber 2005 and January 2010, see[51,52] for more information on ROOTS. ROOTS was approved
by the local Cambridge Research Ethics Committee [RNAG/360]. Written informed consent
was obtained from both children and their caregivers. 771 adolescents (62.3%) had complete
data on all measures for this investigation (Table 1). This subsample was not significantly

 different (p values>.10) from the full ROOTS cohort on: age, sex, socio-economic status, CFA,
peer bullying, family support, friendships, and depressive symptoms at age 17.
Childhood Family Adversity (CFA)
CFA was assessed when the participants were aged 14 using the Cambridge Early Experiences
Interview (CAMEEI)[49]. The CAMEEI is a semi-structured, respondent-sensitive, interviewer
led procedure that collected retrospective accounts of the quality of family environment. These
recalled experiences were obtained from the main caregiver independently of the self-reported
assessments carried out with their adolescent offspring. The caregivers being interviewed were
biological mothers (96%, N = 1143), biological fathers (3%, N = 35), adoptive mothers (N = 7),
both parents (N = 3) and N = 2 each of extended family members, step-mothers and step-
fathers. The CAMEEI focuses on three time domains of childhood: “early childhood” (pre-
school years–birth until approximately five years of age), “later childhood” (approximately six-
11 years) and “early adolescence” (approximately 11 years– 14 years).
Adversities reported in the CAMEEI were: 1) Negative family relationships (family loss and
separations (includes step parents and siblings and partners resident for more than 6 months)
through divorce, death or adoption; ii) family discord; iii) lack of maternal affection/engage-
ment with the proband; iv) maternal parenting style and v) paternal parenting style), family
discord. 2); i) lifetime family medical illnesses sufficiently severe to impact on family life (mod-
erate, chronic and life-threatening); ii) lifetime psychopathology in family members 3) Family
Economics i) periods of unemployment; ii) financial difficulties. 4) Childhood Maltreatment: i)
physical abuse; ii) sexual abuse; iii) emotional abuse. Including 'at risk' children defined as
those ever having been on the Child Protection Register or for whom there was strong, but
inconclusive, evidence of abuse. 5) Other Events; i) criminality among family members, ii)
acute life events, and iii) chronic social difficulties (e.g. ongoing litigation or the demands of
caring for extended family).
In previous work[49], we used latent class analysis to identify subgroups of adolescents who
had experienced different types of early adversity, based on their CAMEEI data. Latent Class
Analyses (LCA) assumes that a population can be divided into mutually exclusive and exhaus-
tive latent groups (classes) based on individual response patterns from a set of measured items
[53]. Identifying these latent classes is of value because different groups have different charac-
teristics, different prognoses and therefore different aetiologies. We found support for four
mutually exclusive CFA subgroups[16]. The largest class (the ‘Optimal class’) contained those
with a low (<13%) probability of any adversity at any time-point (n = 784, 69% of the sample).
The second (‘Abberant Parenting’; n = 76, 7% of the sample) had a high probability (70–100%)
of inconsistent and atypical parenting by both parents (e.g. lax, very strict, cruel to be kind, hit-
ting, all of which showed low prevalence) and a lower probability (8–17%) of any adversity at
any time-point. The third class (the ‘Discordant class’; n = 213, 19% of the sample) had a high
probability (47%) of family discord (e.g. marital disagreements) and a 11–39% probability of
any adversity at any time-points. They also showed elevated rates of family loss, financial diffi-
culties, and maternal psychiatric illness. The fourth class (the ‘Hazardous class’; n = 66, 6% of
the sample) had 50–90% probability of any adversity at any time-point) with a high probability
(60%) of physical and/or emotional abuse. These classes were replicated at each time-point
(birth to age 5; ages 6 to 11; and ages 12 to 14) [44]. In this study, we focused on adversities in
the preschool years (birth-5), as these adversity classes have been shown to be relatively stable
and thus represent persistent exposure to a suboptimal family environment[49]. We used the
four CFA latent classes that were based on our previous report[49]. Given the fact that some of
these classes are relatively small, and to ensure the robustness of our findings, we also reran the

 model with a dichotomous CFA division comparing an ‘Optimal’ vs. ‘Adverse’ (i.e. the Discor-
dant, Hazardous, and Aberrant classes combined) childhood. We found that the findings were
virtually identical. Note that all results in the current study also remained the same when the
analyses were performed with the classes at age six-11.
Primary school peer bullying
We assessed primary school (age five-11) peer bullying using the self-report Peer Victimization
Questionnaire (PVQ, see S1 Appendix). The PVQ was completed retrospectively when partici-
pants were aged 17. Average split-half reliability in our sample was good α = .91 (95% CI = .89-
.92). As this is a new scale we undertook a preliminary theory driven confirmatory factor analy-
sis (see S2 Appendix), which revealed 2 factors; (indirect) relational bullying characterized by
verbal criticisms, and physical bullying (i.e. direct assault). This is in line with the suggestion of
others that bullying comprises of relational and physical bullying [27,29,54,55]. As these two
forms of bullying have been found to have a differential impact on the development of depres-
sion [27], and girls are more likely to report relational bullying[27,56], we examined their
impacts separately in our analyses.
Perceived family support
Family support was assessed at age 14 and 17 with the McMaster Family Assessment Device
(FAD)-General Functioning Scale (FAD-GF[57], administered to adolescents. The FAD has
adequate test-retest reliability, and differentiates between clinician assessed healthy versus
unhealthy families[58]. The FAD-GF is a 12 item self-report questionnaire where respondents
rate statements such as “we can express our feelings to each other” or “there are lots of bad feel-
ings in the family”. The FAD-GF yields an estimate of overall family functioning[59]. In
ROOTS, positive items on this scale were reverse coded so as to measure overall negative family
functioning. To facilitate interpretation in our full model below, we inverted these scores so
that a high score reflects positive family functioning (i.e. family support; scores ranged from -12
to -48 with a mean of -22.43 (SD = 5.76).
Friendships: perceived quality of friendships
Friendships were assessed at age 14 and 17 with the self-report Cambridge Friendships Ques-
tionnaire (CFQ)[60]. The CFQ is an 8 item questionnaire assessing the number, availability,
and quality of friendships (e.g. ‘Do you feel that your friends understand you?’, ‘are you happy
with the number of friends that you’ve got at the moment’, ‘can you confide in your friends’,
‘do you have arguments with your friends that upset you?). The CFQ is derived from a semi-
structured interview based on ethological principles of social relationships and the hypothesis
that friendships are a key supportive network in the development of social and cognitive com-
petencies [48]. The CFQ has good measurement invariance and external validity, and adequate
test retest reliability across two week intervals (Kappa = .80)[61]. Scores in this sample ranged
from two to 30 with a mean of 23.54 (SD = 4.21), and higher scores indicate better perceived
overall quality of friendships (i.e. ‘Friendships’).
Depressive symptoms
To assess current (last two weeks) depressive symptoms at age 14 and 17 we utilized the 33
item self-report Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ)[62] for eight to 18-year-olds. In this
study, the MFQ has good internal consistency (α = 0.93), with sum scores ranging between

 zero and 57 with a mean of 13.6 (SD = 10.21), with higher scores indicating more depressive
symptoms.
Data

Statistical analyses
We used Structural equation models (SEM) in Lavaan version 05.17[63] in R version 3.3[64] to
examine the relations between family and friendships at age 14, and CFA and peer bullying
before age 11, on depressive symptoms at age 17. Fig 1 displays the full theoretical model being
tested in this study.
First, we specified the full structural equation model (Fig 1) for all participants who had
complete data (N = 771). We specified gender as a covariate for all endogenous variables in this
model. Note that within the model the latent variables ‘physical bullying’ and ‘relational bully-
ing’ are estimated within the current sample. The latent CFA classes were based on our previ-
ous report[49]. Findings in this study remained the same when we used a binary CFA variable
(i.e. Optimal vs. other classes (Discordant, Hazardous, and Aberrant). The latent variables are
signified by the observed indicators shown in Fig 1. Relational and physical bullying (as well as
friendships and family support) were allowed to co-vary within the model[7,31]. In posthoc
analyses, we further tested the suggested mediations in the model using formal mediation anal-
yses. In these mediation analyses we fitted a path analysis model in Lavaan that included the
direct effect of X on Y and the indirect effect of X on Y via M. The standard errors for these
defined parameters were computed using the Delta method[65], and the effect sizes were esti-
mated using the method proposed by Iacobucci et al[66] (p. 153), namely as the proportion of

 the total effect (a�b+c’) explained by the mediation pathway alone (a�b) ranging from 0 to
100%. For posthoc moderation analyses, we fitted regressions whilst adding an interaction
term that reflected the moderation.
Second we aimed to examine whether there were gender differences in the best fitting
model. To do so, we fitted an equality constrained multi-group model, to examine whether the
structural relations were identical in boys and girls.
Third, we examined the temporal dimensions of adolescent support on depressive symp-
toms by including friendships, family support and depressive symptoms at both ages 14 and 17
(Fig 2). It is important to note that for our main hypothesis we fitted a model (depicted in Fig
1) that represented the current state of knowledge. However, in this analysis we fitted a more
complex model that captured measurements of depressive symptoms, friendships and family
support at ages 14 and 17 (see Fig 2), to see whether the influences shown above are consistent
and to examine the temporal dynamics of these influences. In line with our previous analyses
we again specified gender as a covariate for all endogenous variables, and relational and physi-
cal bullying as well as friendships- and family support at age 14 and 17 were allowed to co-vary
within the model. It should be noted that this model is quite complex with 83 free parameters,
and that despite the considerable sample size (i.e. complete data was available for N = 713) this
is below an often-cited common guideline of N>10 per parameter[67]. This also indicates that
division into genders and subgroups is, as opposed to the simpler model, not feasible.
In all analyses we used the option ‘mimic Mplus’ in Lavaan. We used the weighted least
squares means and variance adjusted (WLSMV) estimator which is optimal for models that
contain combinations of continuous, categorical and ordinal measures[68]. We modelled only
complete cases and reported the Robust test statistic to account for deviations from normality
of our data. As depressive symptoms, friendships and family support scores had different

of less than 0.05 imply a good fit[68]. Furthermore, we report comparative fit index (CFI), and
the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), where values of CFI &TLI >.95 represent good fit of the overall
model[68]. We do not report SRMR value, as this is not defined for the WLSMV estimator in
Lavaan in R. We used Chi-square comparisons to compare nested models.
Results
The importance of support after ELS on depressive symptoms
We first investigated the impact of friendships and/or family support at age 14 on depressive
symptoms at age 17. The full model (Fig 1) had a good fit to the data X2 (48) = 175.602,p =
.000,CFI = .992, TLI = .987, RMSEA = .059 (90%CI = .050-.068). To reveal the best model
based on the known paths in the literature we next individually deleted the non-significant
paths (based on highest P value). After every path deletion the model fit was re-evaluated.
Table 2 depicts the specific paths that were deleted with every step.
The best fitting model (Fig 3) had a good fit [X2(54) = 133.51, p < .001, CFI = .99, TLI = .99,
RMSEA = .044 (90% CI:.043-.053). This model shows two pathways through which symptom
reduction at age 17 might occur. In the first path, CFA had a negative association with family
support at age 14, which had a negative association with depressive symptoms at age 17. In the
second path, CFA had a positive association with relational bullying, and relational bullying
had a negative association with friendships at age 14, whereas friendships at age 14 had a nega-
tive relationship with depressive symptoms at age 17. Self-esteem may be an important con-
founding factor in the association between social support and depressive symptoms[69,70].
However, all findings and paths remained the same when self-esteem at age 14 (as measured
with the Rosenberg self-esteem scale [71,72] was added to our model (see S3 Appendix for
more information.
We next formally tested the proposed mediation paths in our model. A mediation analysis
between CFA, depressive symptoms and family support suggested that the strength of the rela-
tionship between CFA and depressive symptoms was attenuated when taking family support
into account. The indirect path (standardized estimate (Est) ab = 0.027(SE = .01), p = .005)
explained 29% of the variance in the association between CFA and depressive symptoms (Est
c = 0.094 (.04), p = .015), rendering the direct path between CFA and depressive symptoms
non-significant (Est c' = 0.066 (= .04), p = .079).

 Next, we tested the role of friendships as a mediator between relational bullying and depres-
sive symptoms at age 17. This mediation analysis revealed that the indirect path from relational
bullying to depressive symptoms through friendships (est ab = 0.023(0.007), p < .005)
explained 35% of the variance of relationship between relational bullying and depressive symp-
toms (Est c = 0.17(0.024), p < .001), although the direct path between relational bullying and
depressive symptoms remained significant (Est c' = 0.15(0.024), p < .001).
Our model also showed a strong association between CFA and relational bullying, whilst
relational bullying was negatively associated with friendship support. A follow-up mediation
analysis revealed that the indirect path from CFA to friendships through relational bullying
(Est ab = -0.038(0.01), p < .001) explained 47% of the variance between CFA and friendships
(Est c = -0.08(0.4), p = .04), and the direct path between CFA and friendships was non-signifi-
cant (Est c’ = -0.04(.04), p = .26).
Our model also showed that CFA had a positive association with physical bullying, and
physical bullying has a direct association with depressive symptoms at age 17 (but not with
friendships or family support in adolescence). Indeed, a follow up mediation analysis revealed
that the indirect path from CFA and depression (Est ab = 0.054(0.012), p < .001) explained
58% of the variance between CFA and depressive symptoms (Est c = 0.093(0.4), p < .001), ren-
dering the direct path between CFA and depressive symptoms non-significant (Est c' = 0.039
(0.04), p = .30).
In sum, our findings support a mediating role for friendships and family support in adoles-
cence on depressive symptoms at age 17 after CFA and/or peer bullying. Our model also sug-
gests that adolescents who reported to have experienced physical bullying (in isolation or
together with CFA) showed no mediating effects of family support or friendships on subse-
quent depressive symptoms.

 Social environment as moderator
Our model represents, in essence, a mediation of positive social family and friendship environ-
ments across adolescence. However, one may also hypothesize a moderating effect of social
support, where friendships reduce the effect of relational bullying on depressive symptoms at
age 17, and/or family support reduces the strength of the association between CFA and later
depressive symptoms. Therefore, we next tested these hypothesize moderations. In a model
where family support moderated the relationship between abuse and depressive symptoms at
age 17 we found that there was no significant relation between CFA and depressive symptoms
at age 17 (Est = -0.04, SE = .03, t = -1.09, p = .28), and there was a significant relationship
between family support and depressive symptoms at age 17 (Est = -0.24, SE = .03, t = -6.91, p
< .001). However, there was no significant moderation (CFA�family support) on depressive
symptoms at age 17 (Est = 0.02, SE = .03, t = 0.54, p = .59). Next we tested whether friendships
moderated the relationship between relational bullying and depressive symptoms at age 17.
There was a significant relation between relational bullying and depressive symptoms at age 17
(Est = 0.34, SE = .05, t = 6.62, p < .001), and there was a significant relationship between
friendships support and depressive symptoms at age 17 (Est = -0.22, SE = .04, t = -5.10, p <
.001), however, there was no significant moderation (relational bullying�friendship) on depres-
sive symptoms at age 17 (Est = 0.04, SE = .04, t = 0.97, p = .33). The lack of moderating effects
contrasts markedly with the indirect pathways that were proposed in our model, and are in line
with our findings of mediating roles for friendship and family support.
Sex differences
Next, we examined whether the effects reported above for the full sample differed between
boys and girls. Examining the descriptive statistics, Self-reported relational bullying, friend-
ships, and family support did not differ between boys and girls (Table 3). However, there were
more boys in the hazardous CFA group, and boys reported more physical bullying, whereas
girls reported more depressive symptoms at age 17.
To formally test for possible differences in the structural relations between boys and girls,
we fitted a multi-group model (322 boys, 449 girls), using the same ‘final’ model (same regres-
sion paths as depicted in Fig 3; whilst removing gender as covariate). This model showed good
fit to the data X2 (126) = 204.74,P = .001, CFI = .995, TLI = .995, RMSEA = .040 (90% CI: .030-
.050).
Next, we re-ran this final model, only now with equality constraints. We first fixed the factor
loadings to be equal to ensure measurement invariance, cf.[73]; a ‘factor loadings equality

 constrained model’ that showed good fit [X2 (103) = 157.009,P = .000,CFI = .997, TLI = .996,
RMSEA = .037 (90% CI: .025-.048)]. We then also fixed the regressions to be equal, thereby
implying that all regression relationships drawn in Fig 3 should be equal in both groups (i.e.
boys and girls). This ‘factor and regressions equality constrained’ model also had good fit to the
data[X2 (110) = 170.398,p = .000,CFI = .996, TLI = .996, RMSEA = .038 (90%CI: .026-.049)].
We then compared the ‘factor loadings and regressions equality constrained’ to the ‘factor load-
ings equality constrained model’, thereby examining if the regressions should be allowed to dif-
fer between the genders. The chi-square model comparison showed that the more complex
‘factors equality constrained model’ fitted the data significantly better (X2diff (7) = 14.29, p =
.046), suggesting that the regression paths are different in boys compared to girls.
To examine which paths were significantly different in boys vs. girls, we then examined
modification indices for the ‘factors and regressions equality constrained’ model. This inspec-
tion showed that the association between relational bullying and friendships had the largest
modification index (mi = 11.45 (1), p = 0.0007). Examination of the path coefficients in the
‘factors equality constrained model’ (where the regression paths were allowed to differ) revealed
that this relationship was more negative in boys (est = -0.345, SE = 0.058, Z = -5.930, p < .000)
than in girls (Est = -0.160, SE = 0.048, Z = -3.327, p< 0.001). We now re-ran the ‘factors and
regressions equality constrained’ whilst now also specifying that this one path should be allowed
to differ. This ‘factors and regressions equality minus one constrained’ model had good fit to the
data [X2 (109.00) = 153.644, p = .003,CFI = .997, TLI = .997, RMSEA = .033 (90%CI: .019-
.044)]. Finally, we compared this ‘factors and regressions equality minus one constrained’ model
with the ‘factors equality constrained model’ (i.e. all regression paths were allowed to differ),
thus testing whether a model where only one path differs between boys and girls is significantly
different from a model where all paths differ between boys and girls. This analysis showed that
the more complex ‘factors equality constrained model’ (i.e. all regression paths were allowed to
differ), did not fit the data significantly better than the ‘factors and regressions equality minus
one constrained’ model (X2diff (6) = 3.6455, P = 0.7245). Therefore, the ‘factors and regressions
equality minus one constrained’ is preferred for our data, and depicted in Fig 4. In this model,
no differences between boys and girls were found (i.e. similar paths coefficients for boys and
girls) except for the path between relational bullying and friendships, which was more negative
in boys.
Developmental influences of friendships and/or family support
We next investigated the developmental influences of friendships and/or family support on
depressive symptoms at age 17 through testing a model that included friendships, family sup-
port and depressive symptoms at ages 14 and 17 (as hypothesized in Fig 2). This full model had
a good fit to the data X2 (66) = 184.770, p = < .001, CFI = .99, TLI = .99, RMSEA = .050 (90%
CI = .042-.059). The fitted model is shown in Fig 5 and shows that friendships and/or family
support in adolescence indirectly acted on depressive symptoms at age 17 through depressive
symptoms at age 14, and through friendships and/or family support at age 17. These findings
were confirmed when we re-ran the model whilst specifying these indirect effects: we found
support for indirect effects of family support at age 14 on depressive symptoms at age 17
through family support at age 17 (Est = -.07,SE = .01, Z = -5.55 P < .001), and through depres-
sive symptoms at age 14 (Est = -.09,SE = .01, Z = -8.12 P < .001). Friendship support at age 14
had an indirect effect on depressive symptoms at age 17 through friendship support at age 17
(Est = -0.08 SE = .01,Z = -6.16 P < .001), and through depressive symptoms at age 14 (Est =
-.04,SE = .01, Z = -2.87 P = .004). Interestingly, the model also suggested that family support at
age 14 was positively related with friendships at age 17. Finally, another interesting finding

 from this model is that depression at age 14 is negatively associated with both friendship and
family support at age 17.
Discussion
Our study suggests that friendships and/or family support in adolescence may reduce depres-
sive symptoms in boys and girls who have been exposed to early life stress (childhood family
adversity and/or relational bullying before age 11). Our findings suggest a cascading effect of
ELS on later life. We find support that CFA is associated with bullying from peers (both rela-
tional and physical bullying), and that CFA is associated with reduced adolescent family sup-
port. Furthermore, we find that peer relational bullying is associated with reduced friendship
support in adolescence, and that relational bullying mediates 47% of the negative association
between CFA and friendship support (corroborating[29]).
Crucially, despite these cascading negative effects of ELS on later interactions, our findings
also suggest that positive social environments in adolescence may reduce depressive symptoms
in later life. Specifically, our findings suggest two pathways through which a positive social
environment might mediate the link between ELS and depressive symptoms in later life. First,
CFA was associated with reduced perceived family support, which has a negative association
with depressive symptoms in boys and girls (corroborating[35]). In the second pathway rela-
tional bullying was associated with reduced self-reported friendships at 14 years, which were
negatively associated with depressive symptoms at age 17 in boys and girls (corroborating
[35,42,43]). Follow up mediation analyses confirmed these results, and we found no support
for moderating effects of the social environment on depressive symptoms. Finally, when we
tested the temporal dynamics of friendships and family support, we found that friendships
and/or supportive families in early adolescence indirectly affect depressive symptoms at age 17
through intermediate effects on depressive symptoms at age 14, and through intermediate
effects on friendships and/or family support at age 17. In sum, our findings suggest that adoles-
cent family and friendships support may reduce later depressive symptoms in adolescents with
a history of CFA and/or peer relational bullying.
The negative association between relational bullying and adolescent friendships was stron-
ger in boys when compared to girls, which is in line with findings that the association between
relational bullying and depressive symptoms appears to be stronger for boys compared to girls
[27]. Perhaps boys reported more severe relational bullying events, or it may be that boys are
more sensitive to relational bullying. In addition, our model suggests that strong links between
CFA and both relational and physical bullying, which is in line with findings that CFA predicts
greater likelihood of further peer bullying (e.g[7]), and this double disadvantage is related with
more severe depressive symptoms[30]. In sum, our findings suggest that mental health inter-
ventions aimed at enhancing family support and peer relationships may be particularly helpful
for adolescents who were exposed to CFA and/or peer relational bullying. Of note is that our
findings suggest that such strategies may not be beneficial for those exposed to physical
bullying.
This study finds evidence for several key pathways through which the adolescent social envi-
ronment affects later life mental health. However, the mechanism through which social support
exerts its influence on depressive symptoms remains unknown. It has been suggested that sup-
portive family environments may increase resilience through enhancing coping performance
and reducing threat appraisals [69], through a positive effect on self-esteem, self-regulation
and through offering stress-relief[33,38,74]. Another way in which family support may increase
resilience is through modelling effective interpersonal skills[37]. The mechanisms through
which friendship support may increase resilience are similarly not well understood. Perceived

 friendship support may have a similar positive effect on coping skills, self-esteem and threat
appraisal[33], perhaps through companionship, and experiences of low conflict[69]. There are
indications that friendships increase adolescents perceived friendship self-efficacy; their beliefs
that they are able to communicate and engage with their friends, to resolve conflict and to man-
age their interpersonal emotions[42]. Indeed, friendship self-efficacy is negatively associated
with depressive symptoms in boys and girls[42]. Another way in which friendship may increase
resilience is through updating self-cognitions. It is well established that CFA and relational bul-
lying each induce negative self-cognitions[22,47,75,76], which have been linked to subsequent
depression (e.g.[76–78]). Perhaps positive friendships and family support in adolescence pro-
vide opportunities for a more positive update of self-cognitions. Physical bullying is not as
strongly related to negative self-cognitions[27], which may explain why social support was not
effective in adolescents that experienced physical bullying. Examining the mechanisms of
action for adolescent friendships and family support is an important avenue for future
research.
To our knowledge, this is the first study in a community sample of adolescents that simulta-
neously examines the relations between ELS, adolescent friendships and/or family support, and
later depressive symptoms. However, this study is not without limitations. First, other factors
such as genotypes[29] or temperament [79] may influence the paths in the model. However,
these factors were not part of the theoretical framework addressed in this study, and recent
reports on this cohort suggest that temperament is not likely to alter the current findings[79].
Second, bullying in our sample was retrospectively assessed at age 17, and self-report measures
of bullying may be sensitive to recall bias. However, inflated recall of bullying in depressed ado-
lescents would likely only further reduce the already non-significant relationship in our model
between relational bullying and depression at 17. Furthermore, retrospective self-reported bul-
lying has been found to have adequate accuracy and reliability[80]. Third, our cohort is more
affluent compared to UK norms[51], therefore caution should be taken when generalizing our
findings. Fourth, CFA was assessed from the primary care-giver, which may have led to an
underreporting of CFA. Although an underreporting of CFA would reduce the reported rela-
tionships in our model, indicating that the actual relationships between care-giver assessed
CFA and adolescent assessed family support, peer bullying, or friendships are stronger. Impor-
tantly, underreporting of CFA would not impact on the relationships between adolescent
friendships and/or family support and depressive symptoms at age 17.
Conclusion
First, our study finds support for a prolonged negative impact of CFA on adolescent family and
peer interactions and consequently on depressive symptoms in late adolescence. These findings
stress the importance of early intervention and prevention programs[81–83]. For instance, case
management services for families at risk[81], parenting programs [84] and the Nurse-Family
partnership program [82] may be effective in reducing the occurrence of CFA. Second, our
study suggests that friendships and/or family support in adolescence may attenuate subsequent
depressive symptoms in boys and girls exposed to CFA and relational bullying. Clearly, our
study stresses the importance of a positive social environment in early life and in later adoles-
cence. These findings have important implications, for instance they could inform psychosocial
education programs that discuss the prolonged effects of childhood maltreatment and peer
relational bullying and how to counter these effects. These psychosocial programs may be run
in schools, general health medical centers, mental health institutions, hospitals, sports clubs,
and other institutions relevant for psychosocial education. In addition, our study suggests the
need for interventions aimed at increasing the positive social environments in the adolescent

 epoch. For instance, school based mental health interventions aimed at finding and sustaining
friendships through the active facilitation of social skills training in victimized boys and girls
[85] may increase mental health resilience in adolescents that experienced relational bullying
(with or without concurrent CFA). Similarly, our findings suggest that the efficacy of interven-
tions that increase positive parenting, and video feedback programs[86] or the triple P inter-
vention programs[87] might be fruitful for the parents of adolescents who have experienced
early life CFA. Our study suggests that such interventions aimed at increasing friendships and
family support may have great potential to reduce late adolescent depressive symptoms in boys
and girls that experienced early life child maltreatment and/or relational bullying.
