ABSTRACT: An antimicrobial activity screen of Burkholderia
gladioli BCC0238, a clinical isolate from a cystic fibrosis patient,
led to the discovery of gladiolin, a novel macrolide antibiotic
with potent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.
Gladiolin is structurally related to etnangien, a highly unstable
antibiotic from Sorangium cellulosum that is also active against
Mycobacteria. Like etnangien, gladiolin was found to inhibit
RNA polymerase, a validated drug target in M. tuberculosis.
However, gladiolin lacks the highly labile hexaene moiety of etnangien and was thus found to possess significantly increased
chemical stability. Moreover, gladiolin displayed low mammalian cytotoxicity and good activity against several M. tuberculosis
clinical isolates, including four that are resistant to isoniazid and one that is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin. Overall,
these data suggest that gladiolin may represent a useful starting point for the development of novel drugs to tackle multidrug-
resistant tuberculosis. The B. gladioli BCC0238 genome was sequenced using Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) technology.
This resulted in four contiguous sequences: two large circular chromosomes and two smaller putative plasmids. Analysis of the
chromosome sequences identified 49 putative specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters. One such gene cluster, located
on the smaller of the two chromosomes, encodes a trans-acyltransferase (trans-AT) polyketide synthase (PKS) multienzyme that
was hypothesized to assemble gladiolin. Insertional inactivation of a gene in this cluster encoding one of the PKS subunits
abrogated gladiolin production, confirming that the gene cluster is responsible for biosynthesis of the antibiotic. Comparison of
the PKSs responsible for the assembly of gladiolin and etnangien showed that they possess a remarkably similar architecture,
obfuscating the biosynthetic mechanisms responsible for most of the structural differences between the two metabolites.
■ INTRODUCTION
The genus Burkholderia comprises a highly diverse group of
Gram-negative bacteria that is able to thrive in different
ecological niches, ranging from the plant rhizosphere to the
human lung.1 Much of this versatility can be attributed to their
relatively large (6 to 9 Mb) GC-rich multireplicon genomes
that have evolved to mediate a variety of beneficial and
antagonistic interactions with other pro- and eukaryotic
organisms.2 Indeed, Burkholderia species are well-known for
their ability to promote plant growth, degrade polyaromatic
hydrocarbon pollutants, and cause infections in the airways of
cystic fibrosis (CF) patients.3−5 Furthermore, secretion of
antimicrobial and other bioactive compounds enables these
bacteria to suppress plant pathogenic fungi and nematodes,
cause plant diseases, and eliminate other bacterial competitors
in their native habitat.4,6,7 Several studies have demonstrated
that Burkholderia species are prolific producers of bioactive
specialized metabolites, many of which are assembled by trans-
acyltransferase (AT) polyketide synthase (PKS) or hybrid
trans-AT PKS-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)
biosynthetic assembly lines.8,9 Prominent examples include
the following: the phytotoxin rhizoxin;10 the respiratory toxin
bongkrekic acid;11 the thailanstatin,12 burkholdac,13 spliceosta-
tin,14 and thailandamide15 families of antiproliferative agents;
the bactobolin antibiotics;16 and enacyloxin IIa, an unusual
antibiotic from Burkholderia ambifaria with clinically relevant
activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens

 such as Acinetobacter baumannii.17 Furthermore, bioinformatics
analyses of sequenced Burkholderia genomes have revealed a
vast untapped potential for specialized metabolite production,18
which makes this genus a promising resource for discovery of
novel bioactive natural products with potential applications in
medicine and agriculture.
In an effort to identify novel bioactive metabolites from
Burkholderia, we set out to explore the potential of the CF
isolate Burkholderia gladioli BCC0238 to produce antimicrobial
compounds. This led to the discovery of gladiolin, a novel
macrolide antibiotic with promising activity against Mycobacte-
rium tuberculosis. Gladiolin is structurally related to the highly
unstable myxobacterial RNA polymerase inhibitor etnan-
gien.19,20 However, the structural differences between etnangien
and gladiolin confer significantly improved chemical stability on
the latter.
The genome of B. gladioli BCC0238 was sequenced using
single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology. This
revealed a 130 kb gene cluster encoding a trans-acyltransferase
(AT) PKS that differs from the corresponding multienzyme
responsible for etnangien assembly by the substitution of only a
single enzymatic domain. Targeted mutagenesis coupled with
comparative metabolite profiling confirmed that this gene
cluster directs gladiolin biosynthesis. Sequence analysis of the
proteins encoded by genes within the cluster allowed a
plausible pathway for the assembly of gladiolin to be proposed,
raising intriguing questions about the biosynthetic mechanisms
underlying the structural differences between etnangien and
gladiolin.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Antimicrobial Activity of B. gladioli BCC0238. During a
screen of Burkholderia sp. for the production of bioactive
specialized metabolites,17 B. gladioli BCC0238 (LMG-P
26202), isolated in 1996 from the sputum of a child with
cystic fibrosis resident in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, was
found to exhibit broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. Growth
of the strain on a solid minimal medium containing glycerol as
a sole carbon source17 and screening using a conventional
microbial overlay assay identified antagonism toward Gram-
positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecium and Bacillus subtilis, Gram-
negative bacteria such as Ralstonia mannitolilytica and
Burkholderia multivorans, and clinically problematic yeasts
including Candida albicans (Figure 1).
Purification and Structure Elucidation of Gladiolin. To
identify the antimicrobial metabolite(s) produced by B. gladioli
BCC0238, large-scale cultures of the strain were grown on the
solid minimal medium and acetonitrile extracts of the agar were
fractionated by semipreparative HPLC. Positive ion mode HR-
ESI-Q-TOF-MS analysis of a bioactive fraction with an
absorption maximum at 240 nm identified a compound we
named gladiolin with the molecular formula C44H74O11
(calculated for C44H75O11
+: 779.5304, found: 779.5309;
calculated for C44H74O11Na+: 801.5123, found: 801.5124)
(Figure S1). This molecular formula was further confirmed
by negative ion mode analysis (calculated for C44H73O11
−:
777.5158, found: 777.5154) (Figure S2). Fragment ions
resulting from the neutral loss of CO2 (44 Da) and two
molecules of water (2 × 18 Da) were observed in negative ion
mode MS/MS analysis of gladiolin (Figure S3), indicating the
presence of a free carboxyl group and two or more hydroxyl
groups.
The planar structure of gladiolin was elucidated using a
combination of 1H, 13C, COSY, TOCSY, HSQC, HMBC, and
NOESY NMR experiments (Figure 2, Tables S1 and S2,
Figures S4−S8). Four doublets between 0.69 and 0.80 ppm in
the 1H NMR spectrum, each integrating for three protons,
indicated that the compound contains four methyl groups
attached to methine carbons (Table S1). Singlets at 1.59 and
3.23 ppm, each integrating for three protons, suggested the
presence of allylic methyl and methoxy groups, respectively,
and several signals between 3.54 and 3.98 ppm and 5.06 and
6.29 ppm indicated that the molecule contains multiple C-
hydroxyl groups and carbon−carbon double bonds (Table S1).
An unbroken network of COSY correlations established the

 structures of the C-2 to C-24 and C-26 to C-37 fragments of
the molecule (Figure 2A). HMBC correlations between the
protons of the C-25 methyl group and C-24, C-25, and C-26,
and between the proton attached to C-24 and C-26, allowed
the connectivity of the C-2/C-24 and C-26/C-37 fragments to
be determined (Figure 2A). Similarly, the location of the
methoxy group was established on the basis of an HMBC
correlation between the protons attached to the methyl group
and C-15 (Figure 2A). Signals at 174.9 and 170.9 ppm in the
13C NMR spectrum showed that gladiolin contains two
carbonyl groups (Table S1). On the basis of HMBC
correlations between C-38 and the protons attached to C-36/
C-37, and between C-1 and the protons attached to C-2, C-3
and C-21, the former is assigned to a carboxyl group attached
to C-37, whereas the latter is assigned to an ester linkage
between C-2 and the C-21 hydroxyl group (Figure 2A). The
configurations of the double bonds in gladiolin were deduced
from NOESY correlations and 1H NMR coupling constants.
3JH,H coupling constants of 15 Hz for H-10/H-11, H-28/H-29,
and H-30/H-31 and NOESY correlations between the C-25
methyl group and H-23 indicated that the C-10/C-11, C-24/C-
25, C-28/C-29 and C-30/C-31 double bonds all have the E
configuration, whereas a coupling constant of 11 Hz for H-12/
H-13 is consistent with a Z configuration for the C-12/C-13
double bond (Figure 2B and Table S1).
Gladiolin is structurally related to etnangien, a highly
unstable antibiotic produced by Sorangium cellulosum (Figure
2C and Figure S9).19,20 Compared to gladiolin, etnangien has
an extra methyl group at C-46, contains four additional
unsaturated carbon atoms between C-31 and C-36, and has
double bonds in place of single bonds between C-26/C-27 and
the carbon atoms C-38/C-39 (corresponding to C-34/C-35 of
gladiolin). The instability of etnangien is attributed to its
conjugated acyclic hexaene moiety, which is prone to light-
induced isomerization and rapid oxidative degradation,
necessitating the exclusion of light and the inclusion of the
antioxidant 4-tert-butylcatechol in all purification steps.20 No
such precautions are necessary during the purification of
gladiolin, because it lacks the highly labile hexaene moiety of
etnangien and as a consequence is comparatively stable.
However, during the course of our studies on the structure of
gladiolin we found that it undergoes slow conversion
(approximately 75% after 96 h at room temperature) to an
isomer upon standing in methanol (Figure S10). Structure
elucidation of this isomer using 1- and 2-D NMR spectroscopy
showed that it results from nucleophilic addition of the C-23
hydroxyl group to the ester, followed by elimination of the C-
21 hydroxyl group to form a 24-membered lactone (Figure S11,
Table S3). The rate of this rearrangement was found to be
much slower in 9:1 H20/DMSO (20% after 65 days at room
temperature), suggesting that it is unlikely to pose problems in
relation to potential therapeutic applications of gladiolin.
NOESY NMR data for gladiolin indicate that the C-3 to C-
23 segment of gladiolin has the same relative stereochemistry as
the corresponding portion of etnangien (Figure 2C and S9).21
Moreover, this agrees with the relative and absolute stereo-
chemistry deduced for gladiolin on the basis of predictive
sequence analysis of ketoreductase (KR) domain stereo-
specificity within the gladiolin polyketide synthase (see the
section on gladiolin biosynthesis below). The absolute
configuration of C-33 can similarly be predicted on the basis
of the KR stereospecificity analysis, but the configuration of C-
35 remains unknown and requires further experimental
investigation.
Antimicrobial Activity and Cytotoxicity of Gladiolin.
Purified gladiolin was tested for its antimicrobial activity against
a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including
representative members of the ESKAPE panel of pathogens.22
Moderate activity was observed against Gram-positive bacteria
such as MRSA and E. faecium, while most Gram-negative
bacteria proved to be resistant at clinically relevant minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) cutoffs (Table 1). Gladiolin
was also found to be active against C. albicans with an MIC of 4
μg/mL (Table 1).
Etnangien has been reported to be active against
Mycobacterium smegmatis. We thus evaluated the in vitro activity
of gladiolin against M. tuberculosis using the resazurin microtiter
assay (REMA).23 The H37Rv strain was found to be
susceptible to gladiolin at a MIC of 0.4 μg/mL (Table 2,
Figure S12). Gladiolin was also found to be active against
several M. tuberculosis clinical isolates, including four that are
resistant to isoniazid and one (CHUV80037024) that is
resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin (Table 2, Figure
S12). Curiously, another isoniazid and rifampicin resistant
isolate (CHUV80059744) was found to be resistant. While the
reason for this is currently unclear, it is not due to the RpoB
mutation (Ser450Leu) that confers rifampicin resistance in this
strain, because the CHUV80037024 strain harbors the same
mutation. The susceptibility of nonreplicating M. tuberculosis to
gladiolin was studied using strain ss18b.24 No activity against
this strain was observed at concentrations up to 100 μg/mL,
indicating that gladiolin is not active against nonreplicating
mycobacterial cells (Figure S13). Control experiments with M.
tuberculosis strain ss18b and rifampicin at 5 μg/mL showed the
expected 45% inhibition of REMA turnover.
Gladiolin was found to exhibit low toxicity toward an ovarian
cancer cell line (IC50 > 100 μM; Figure S14). Moreover, no
toxicity was observed at a dose equivalent to >500 mg/kg in a
Galleria mellonella wax moth larvae model (Figure S15).25
Gladiolin inhibits RNA polymerase in vitro. Etnangien
has been shown to inhibit bacterial RNA polymerases, both in
vitro and in vivo.19 We therefore investigated the ability of
gladiolin to inhibit the M. smegmatis RNA polymerase (RNAP)

 using a promoter-driven, real-time in vitro transcription
assay.26−28 This revealed concentration-dependent inhibition
of the RNAP by gladiolin, with an IC50 of ∼25 μg/mL (32 μM)
(Figure 3). For comparison, rifampicin has an IC50 of 280 nM
in the same assay.
Sequencing and Analysis of the B. gladioli BCC0238
Genome. To identify the gene cluster responsible for the
biosynthesis of gladiolin, we sequenced the genome of B.
gladioli BCC0238 using SMRT sequencing technology. This
approach yielded a draft genome of 8,489,985 bases that
assembled into four contiguous sequences. Mapping of the
resulting sequences to the complete reference genome of the
rice pathogenic B. gladioli BSR3 strain29 demonstrated that (i)
the first contiguous sequence (4,218,485 bp) overlaps
extensively with the largest chromosomal replicon of strain
BSR3; (ii) the second contiguous sequence (4,046,520 bp)
corresponds to the second chromosomal replicon of strain
BSR3; and (iii) the third and fourth contiguous sequences
(188,701 bp and 189,441 bp, respectively) show partial
similarity to the B. gladioli BSR3 plasmid bgla_2p
[NC_015377.1]. In an effort to identify and map novel
genomic regions, the sequences of replicon 1 and 2 from B.
gladioli BCC0238 were compared to the draft sequences of B.
gladioli NBRC 13700 and 3848s-5, as well as the complete
genome sequence of B. gladioli BSR3 (Figure S13). This
analysis revealed that the sequence of replicon 1 is well
conserved between isolates, whereas replicon 2 shows a
considerably higher degree of sequence variability (Figure
S16). Analysis of the B. gladioli BCC0238 genome sequence
using antiSMASH v3.030 identified 20 and 29 putative
specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters on the first
and second replicons, respectively (Table S4). No such clusters
were found on the contiguous sequences showing similarity to
the bgla_2p plasmid. A clear benefit of the long reads resulting
from the SMRT sequencing was the ability to completely
assemble 11 large (mean size 77,973 bp), high GC (up to 72%)
and highly repetitive gene clusters encoding modular PKS and
NRPS assembly lines (including one hybrid modular PKS-
NRPS locus). In total, B. gladioli BCC0238 devotes 18.2% of
the first and 25.6% of the second chromosomal replicon to
specialized metabolism, based on the antiSMASH predictions.
Identification and Analysis of the Gladiolin Biosyn-
thetic Gene Cluster. One of the putative polyketide
biosynthetic gene clusters identified on the second chromoso-
mal replicon of B. gladioli BCC0238 (cluster R2-11; Table S4)
was postulated to direct gladiolin biosynthesis (Figure S16).
This cluster harbors six large genes encoding trans-AT PKS
subunits, designated gbnD1-D6, which are flanked by several
genes encoding putative polyketide processing enzymes and
export-related proteins (Figure S17, Table S5 and S6). To
verify that this gene cluster is involved in the assembly of
gladiolin, we disrupted gbnD1 by insertional mutagenesis.
UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS analysis of extracts from agar cultures
confirmed that gladiolin production is abolished in the mutant
(Figure 4). BLAST searches revealed a high degree of similarity
between the PKS subunits involved in gladiolin and etnangien
biosynthesis. Detailed analysis of the catalytic domains within
the PKS subunits allowed us to propose a plausible pathway for
gladiolin biosynthesis (Figure 5). In addition, sequence analysis
of the KR domains within the gladiolin PKS allowed the

 Figure 5. Proposed pathway for gladiolin biosynthesis. Domain and module organization of the gladiolin trans-AT PKS, showing the proposed
structures of the ACP-bound thioester intermediates following α- and β-carbon processing. The configurations of the stereocenters were predicted
based on sequence analysis of the KR domains. Acyl transferase/hydrolase domains acting in trans are shown, and their predicted specificities are
indicated. Note that although the PKS harbors 20 KS domains, only 17 chain elongation reactions are required for the assembly of the gladiolin
backbone. No canonical KS0 domains were identified. However, KS12, KS14, and KS20 are hypothesized to be nonelongating KS domains. Domain
abbreviations are as follows: KS, ketosynthase; KR, ketoreductase; DH, dehydratase; ER, enoyl reductase; MT, C-/O-methyltransferase; ACP, acyl
carrier protein and TE, thioesterase. The predicted stereospecificity of KR domains is denoted as type A or type B in subscript. The mechanism of β-
branching by the HMGS cassette is highlighted, and ACP domains in the assembly line harboring the conserved Trp residue recognized by the
HMGS cassette are indicated with a “+”. The putative functions of the proteins encoded by the gladiolin biosynthetic gene cluster are given in
Figures S17−20 and Tables S5 and S6.

 absolute stereochemistry of each of the stereocenters bearing a
hydroxyl group to be predicted (Figure 5, Table S7).31 These
predictions are in complete agreement with the relative
stereochemistry assigned to gladiolin on the basis of the
NMR data (Figure 2) and allowed the configuration of the C-
33 stereocenter, which could not be elucidated experimentally,
to be tentatively assigned as R (Figure 5).
As expected for PKSs belonging to the trans-AT phylogenetic
group, GbnD1−D6 lack AT domains. Three AT-like enzymes,
GbnB, GbnN, and GbnP, are encoded by genes upstream of the
PKS genes. Phylogenetic analysis of these enzymes identified
GbnN as an AT with specificity for malonyl-CoA (Figure S18).
In contrast, GbnB clusters with the putative etnangien
biosynthetic enzyme EtnB, in a distinct clade from GbnN
and GbnP. The substrate specificity of GbnB/EtnB could not
be predicted from analysis of conserved sequence motifs
(Figure S18).
The biosynthesis of gladiolin is proposed to be initiated by
transacylation of the succinyl moiety of succinyl-CoA onto the
active site Cys residue in the N-terminal ketosynthase (KS)
domain of GbnD1. This hypothesis is supported by
phylogenetic analyses, which place this KS in clade VI along
with other KS domains that accept related PKS starter units
(Figure S19).34 Alternatively, the AT-like enzyme GbnB could
catalyze transfer of the succinyl group from succinyl-CoA onto
either of the ACP domains immediately downstream of the KS
domain. This would require subsequent back-transfer of the
succinyl unit onto the active site Cys of the KS, a phenomenon
that has previously been observed in other systems in vitro.35
Following elongation of the succinyl starter unit via
decarboxylative condensation with a malonyl extender unit
that has been loaded onto one of the ACP domains
immediately downstream of the KS domain by GbnN, a β-
methyl branch is proposed to be installed by the hydrox-
ymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HCS) enzyme cassette encoded
by gbnF-H and gbnI-J/gbnR-S. This is the first of two such
modification reactions that are proposed to take place during
gladiolin assembly, the second occurring in module 6 (Figure
5). Sequence analysis of the ACP domains in modules 1 and 6
of the gladiolin PKS confirmed that they all harbor a conserved
Trp residue, which has been shown to play an important role in
recognition by the HCS cassette (Figure S20).36 The product
of this well-characterized β-branching process is a β-methyl-α,β-
unsaturated thioester intermediate.37
Up until this point the intermediates in gladiolin and
etnangien biosynthesis appear to be identical. Intriguingly,
however, one of the three ACP domains in module 1 of the
etnangien PKS is replaced with an enoyl reductase (ER)
domain in the gladiolin PKS (Figure S21). The result of this
domain substitution appears to be that the C−C double bond
in the β-methyl-α,β-unsaturated thioester intermediate in
gladiolin biosynthesis is reduced, whereas in etnangien
biosynthesis the C−C double bond is preserved (Figure 5).20
Interestingly, the gladiolin biosynthetic gene cluster encodes
two sets of the enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH) enzymes (GbnI/
GbnJ and GbnR/GbnS) responsible for dehydration and
decarboxylation of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-ACP inter-
mediate in β-branching. In contrast, only a single set of these
enzymes (EtnP/EtnQ) is encoded by the etnangien bio-
synthetic gene cluster (Figure S17). It is therefore tempting to
speculate that the presence of the ER domain places structural
constraints on the adjacent ACP domains that have
necessitated the recruitment of a second set of ECH enzymes
to complete formation of the β-branch in module 1 of the
gladiolin PKS.
The substitution of an ACP domain with an ER domain in
module 1 of GbnD1 is the only discernible difference in
domain organization between gladiolin and etnangien PKSs.
Thus, it seems likely that the ER domain in GbnD1 may be
responsible for some of the other structural differences between
gladiolin and etnangien. Arguably the most striking difference
between these two compounds is the C-26/C-35 pentaene in
the latter, which is substituted with a C-26/C-31 dimethylene-
diene in the former. The origin of the C-26/C-35 pentaene in
etnangien has been attributed to iterative use of module 5,
which is proposed to catalyze three successive rounds of chain
elongation, ketoreduction, and dehydration.20 The mechanism
by which iterative use of module 5 is circumvented in GbnD2 is
an intriguing aspect of gladiolin biosynthesis. It appears that the
enoyl thioester resulting from chain elongation, ketoreduction,
and dehydration by module 5 undergoes enoyl reduction,
because C-26/C-27 in gladiolin is saturated. However, module
5 does not contain an ER domain. It is hypothesized that the
ER domain in module 1 of the gladiolin PKS catalyzes this
reaction and that this prevents transfer of the ACP-bound
thioester back onto the KS domain in module 5, which is
required to initiate a second round of chain elongation. A final
structural difference between gladiolin and etnangien is the
presence of a methyl group at C-6 in the latter. Both the
etnangien and gladiolin PKSs have C-methyltransferase (MT)
domains in modules 16 and 18. This is congruent with the
presence of methyl groups at C-4 and C-8 in gladiolin, but is
incongruent with the observation that C-4, C-6, and C-8 all
bear methyl groups in etnangien. It therefore appears that the
MT domain in either module 16 or module 18 of the etnangien
PKS is able to catalyze C-methylation of the module 17 chain
elongation intermediate.20
A final interesting point about gladiolin biosynthesis is that
GbnD1-D6 possess 20 KS domains, but only 17 chain
elongation reactions are required to assemble the polyketide
chain from a succinyl-CoA starter unit and 16 malonyl-CoA
extender units (Figure 5). Three of the KS domains must
therefore act as transacylases, i.e. they simply transfer the
polyketide chain from one ACP to another. In other trans-AT
PKSs such transacylation reactions are typically catalyzed by
KS0 domains, which lack the His residue from the HGTGT
motif that is required for catalysis of chain elongation.34
However, sequence analysis revealed that all 20 of the KS
domains in the gladiolin PKS harbor an intact HGTGT motif.
Thus, it is difficult to predict which of them function as
transacylases. Based on the structure of gladiolin and the
architecture of trans-AT PKSs that contain KS0 domains, we
tentatively suggest that KS domains 12, 14, and 20 are likely to
be nonelongating. However, experimental evidence will be
required to verify this.
■ SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we isolated and elucidated the structure of
gladiolin, a novel macrolide antibiotic produced by B. gladioli
BCC0238. This metabolite is structurally related to etnangien, a
compound of considerable interest due to its potent
antimicrobial activity and its ability to efficiently inhibit nucleic
acid polymerases. However, the clinical development of
etnangien has been hampered by the high instability of the
hexaene moiety in its C-21 side chain, which until now was
thought to be essential for biological activity.40 By virtue of its

 shorter and more saturated C-21 side chain, gladiolin benefits
from dramatically improved stability compared to etnangien,
yet retains potent activity against mycobacteria via inhibition of
RNA polymerase (note that although the IC50 for inhibition of
M. smegmatis RNA polymerase by gladiolin is approximately 2
orders of magnitude higher than its MIC against M. tuberculosis
H37Rv, the same is true of rifampicin, for which RNA
polymerase is known to be the primary target). Moreover,
gladiolin displays low toxicity and good activity against several
antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. There is a
pressing need to overcome multidrug resistant and extensively
drug-resistant tuberculosis. Gladiolin offers potential for further
development as an antibiotic to address this challenge. Using a
SMRT-sequencing approach, we identified the gladiolin
biosynthetic gene cluster in the genome of B. gladioli
BCC0238. Detailed comparative analysis of the gladiolin and
etnangien biosynthetic gene clusters revealed a strikingly similar
domain composition in the trans-AT PKS assembly lines
responsible for assembly of these two metabolites. The
structural differences in the C-21 side chains of gladiolin and
etnangien appear to be due, at least in part, to substitution of an
ER domain in the gladiolin PKS with an ACP domain in the
etnangien assembly line, and provide a dramatic example of
evolutionary reprogramming of trans-AT PKS chain assembly.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Gladiolin Isolation, Structure Elucidation, and Stability
Analysis. For gladiolin production, B. gladioli BCC0238 was grown
at 30 °C on solid minimal medium containing glycerol as a sole carbon
source (BSM-G).41 Following incubation for 3 days, the cells were
scraped off and the agar was extracted twice using MeCN (1:1).
Extracts were purified by semipreparative HPLC to give gladiolin as a
white powder. Structure elucidation was achieved using a combination
of UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS and 1- and 2-D NMR experiments.
Susceptibility of (Non)replicating M. tuberculosis to Gladi-
olin. The susceptibility of replicating strains was determined in a 96-
well plate using the resazurin reduction assay as described
previously.23,28 The susceptibility of nonreplicating M. tuberculosis to
gladiolin was determined using the ss18b model as described
previously.24 Control experiments were conducted using rifampicin
and isoniazid.
Inhibition of the Mycobacterial RNA Polymerase in Vitro. M.
smegmatis RNAP holoenzyme was purified from M. smegmatis mc2155
expressing a His6-tagged RNAP β subunit (kindly provided by
Dipankar Chatterjee, Indian Institute of Science) as described
previously.27,38 To measure inhibition of promoter-specific DNA-
dependent RNA transcription by gladiolin, a real-time, multiple round
in vitro transcription assay was used that employs molecular
beacons.26,27
Genome Sequencing, Assembly, and Analysis. Genomic DNA
was extracted from bacteria harvested by centrifugation from 2 mL of a
fresh overnight culture of B. gladioli using the Maxwell 16 Tissue DNA
Purification Kit and instrument (Promega) and prepared for
sequencing using a DNA Template Prep Kit 2.0 (3 Kb - 10 Kb;
Pacific Biosciences), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The
genome sequence was assembled from data obtained from two runs on
a PacBio RSII sequencer. One used 3 SMRT cells, P4-C2 chemistry,
and a 120m movie. The other used 3 SMRT cells, P5-C3 chemistry,
and a 180m movie. 293,015 filtered subreads, with a total length of
969,973,511 bp, a mean length of 3,310bp, and a median length of
2,120bp were assembled using SMRTanalysis v2.3.0 (Pacific
Biosciences). Secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene cluster pre-
dictions were made using antiSMASH v3.0,30 and the putative
gladiolin gene cluster was subjected to detailed manual annotation via
comparative sequence analysis (Tables S4−S7 and Figures S13−S18).
Insertional Mutagenesis of Gladiolin Biosynthetic Gene
gbnD1. Insertional mutagenesis was performed using the pGpΩTp
suicide plasmid.39 Primers amplifying a 446 bp region of the PKS gene
gbnD1 (Fw: 5′-ATTTCTAGAGTTGCTGATCGACGCCTATC-3′;
Rev: 5′-TATGAATTCCGCCATAACCGAACGAACTC-3′) were
designed. The PCR product was amplified using the Taq PCR core
kit (Qiagen) and cloned, following XbaI and EcoRI digestion (NEB),
into pGpΩTp. The validity of the mutagenesis construct was
confirmed by sequencing. The construct was introduced into E. coli
SY327 by electroporation and subsequently mobilized into B. gladioli
via triparental mating.38 Transconjugants were selected using
trimethoprim (100 μg/mL) and polymyxin B (600 U/ml). A single
B. gladioli gbnD1 mutant was selected, and correct pathway disruption
was confirmed by Illumina resequencing.
