Abstract
Episodic memories formed during the first postnatal period are rapidly forgotten, a phenomenon 
known as infantile amnesia. In spite of this memory loss, early experiences influence adult 
behavior, raising the question of which mechanisms underlie infantile memories and amnesia. 
Here we show that in rats an experience learned during the infantile amnesia period is stored as a 
latent memory trace for a long time; indeed, a later reminder reinstates a robust, context-specific 
and long-lasting memory. The formation and storage of this latent memory requires the 
hippocampus, follows a sharp temporal boundary, and occurs through mechanisms typical of 
developmental critical periods, including brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor (BDNF)- and 
metabotropic-glutamate-receptor-5 (mGluR5)-dependent expression switch of the N-methyl-D-
aspartate receptor subunits 2B-2A. BDNF or mGlur5 activation after training rescues the infantile 
amnesia. Thus, early episodic memories are not lost, but remain stored long-term. These data 
suggest that the hippocampus undergoes a developmental critical period to become functionally 
competent.

 Introduction
While salient, episodic memories formed in adulthood can be remembered for years, similar 
memories formed during early childhood appear to be easily and rapidly forgotten. This 
rapid forgetting and the inability to recall early life memories in adulthood is found in 
humans as well as in non human animals, and is known as infantile or childhood amnesia1-3. 
Despite they apparently are rapidly forgotten, experiences during early life have been 
documented to profoundly affect brain functions and physiology later in life. For example, 
early threatening experiences predispose to psychopathologies like post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD), mood and anxiety disorders4. This paradox raises the question of how 
early memories can influence adult life if they cannot actually be remembered.
Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this paradox. One suggests that the 
amnesia is due to the immaturity of the infant brain. According to this idea, the neural 
substrates and cell/circuitry composition of cortical, hippocampal or of other areas 
processing episodic, or in general hippocampal-dependent memories, being still 
underdeveloped, lack functional competence5, 6. Among the immature functions of the infant 
brain, recent studies suggested that the rapid forgetting is due to increased rate of 
hippocampal neurogenesis during development, which would interfere with memory 
consolidation, the process that mediates long-term memory persistence and storage7. In 
contrast, other authors have proposed that infantile amnesia results from impaired memory 
retrieval3, 8, 9, providing an explanation for how the stored, non-expressed memory traces 
would affect the behavior later in life. In support of this conclusion, studies in human and 
animal models reported that reminders of the early experience can reinstate a memory 
acquired during infancy10-13. However, because little is known about the mechanisms 
underlying acquisition, and possibly storage of memory traces acquired during early life, the 
paradox is still unsolved.
Using inhibitory avoidance (IA) in rats, here we show that the acquisition and storage of an 
episodic threatening experience during the infantile amnesia period require hippocampal 
mechanisms. These mechanisms are typical of developmental critical periods, matures in 
response to experience, and store hippocampal-dependent traces in a latent form for a long 
time. These memory traces can influence behavior later in life, as reminders comprising both 
context and threat reinstate a context-specific long-lasting memory.
RESULTS
An early-life memory reinstates with later reminders
In agreement with previous studies done in animal models of contextual threat memories 
using multiple shocks14, 15, we show that a single footshock during IA training in rats at 
postnatal day 17 (PN17), but not at PN24, recapitulates the infantile amnesia phenomenon. 
The numeric values with detailed statistical analyses of all experiments of this study are 
shown in Supplementary Tables. Compared to acquisition, training at PN17 produced 
significant memory retention immediately after training, which, however, completely 
decayed 1 day (d) later (Fig. 1a). The latency of PN17 trained rats, although still 
significantly higher than that at acquisition, was profoundly decreased already 30 minutes

 (min) after training (Fig. 1b). This memory, again, was completely lost 1d after training (Fig. 
1b). Littermates left undisturbed in their home cage (naïve group), or placed on a shock grid 
and immediately exposed to a footshock (shock-only group) never showed significant 
latency above that of acquisition, excluding that the retentions following training were the 
result of non-specific responses (Fig. 1a-c). In contrast, training at PN24 elicited a strong 
and long-lasting associative memory at all timepoints tested, including immediately after, 30 
min, 1d and 7d after training (Fig. 1d-f); these retentions were comparable to those of adult 
rats (Supplementary Fig.1).
Furthermore, the first testing (immediately after, or 30 min after training) did not contribute 
to the amnesia seen 1d after training, as PN17 trained rats tested only 1d after training had 
no memory compared to their acquisition latency or to latency of naïve rats (Fig. 1c). This 
amnesia persisted one week after training (Fig. 1c).
The infantile amnesia was not caused by alterations in exploratory behavior, locomotor or 
nociceptive responses, as latencies to enter the dark compartment at training as well as 
escape latencies from a hotplate were undistinguishable between PN17 and PN24 rats 
(Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Moreover naïve, shock-only and trained 
rats at PN17 or PN24 had comparable weight gain at 1d and 7d following training 
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
As previous studies suggested that infantile amnesia results from memory retrieval failure, 
rather than an inability to form long-term contextual memories8-13, we tested whether 
contextual reminders could reinstate memory in PN17 trained rats. Contextual reminder 
provided by testing at 1 (T1), 7 (T2), 10 (T3) and 16 days after training (T4) produced no 
memory compared to naïve and shock-only rats (Fig. 1g). However, when the rats were then 
presented with a reminder footshock (RS) two days after the second test (T2), a robust and 
long-lasting IA latency emerged (T3 and T4, Fig. 1h). The reinstatement protocol per se did 
not establish any IA latency, as naïve or shock-only control rats exposed to the reinstatement 
protocol had no latency above acquisition (Fig. 1h). Notably, the reinstated memory was 
context specific because following reinstatement the rats tested in a different IA box (new 
context, NC) showed no retention above acquisition (NC, Fig. 1h). Furthermore, an unpaired 
presentation at PN17 of the context and, one hour later, of the footshock failed to elicit IA 
memory (Supplementary Fig. 4), indicating that the latent memory trace is associative. 
Exposure to RS alone (i.e. without any testing) was also not sufficient to reinstate the 
memory (Fig. 1i). Furthermore, only one test given 7d after training, followed by a RS given 
2d thereafter (T+RS) was sufficient to reinstate the memory (T2 and T3, Fig. 1j).
This T+RS effectively reinstated the latent memory for a long time: significant latency was 
in fact elicited with T+RS given four weeks after training at PN17 (T2 and T3, Fig. 1k).
To determine whether the time interval between T and RS is crucial for IA memory to 
emerge, the RS was delivered at 4h, 1d or 7d following T. In all these cases T+RS were able 
to reinstate a long-lasting and context specific memory, suggesting that the time interval 
between T and RS is not strict (Supplementary Fig. 5).

 Thus, a latent and long-term memory trace is acquired at training during the infantile 
amnesia period; a later reactivation of the memory through exposure to both context and 
footshock, presented in a temporally unpaired manner (e.g. two days apart), is necessary and 
sufficient to reinstate a strong, long-lasting and context-specific IA memory.
The latent infantile memory trace is hippocampus-dependent
The hippocampus has a key role in the formation and consolidation of long-term episodic 
and contextual memories in adulthood16, 17, but its role is believed to emerge over time. 
Several studies in rats reported that hippocampal-dependent learning and memory emerges 
not earlier than PN21, concluding that the hippocampus before PN21 is unable to support 
long-term memory formation5, 15, 18. Although recently Foster and Burman19 provided 
evidence of hippocampal-dependent context pre-exposure learning facilitation in rats at 
PN17, Robinson-Drummer and Stanton20 failed to replicate the result.
Here, we asked whether the dorsal hippocampus (dHC) is involved in the acquisition of the 
IA infantile memory trace. PN24 rats were employed as controls. Compared to vehicle, a 
bilateral injection of the neural activity blocker GABAA agonist muscimol in the dHC, 30 
minutes before training at PN17, prevented memory reinstatement after the T+RS (T2, Fig. 
2a), without affecting the latency at training or at tests 1 (T1, Fig. 2a). The muscimol-
injected rats learned the IA task when retrained (Tr) upon entering the shock compartment at 
T2, showing that muscimol had not damaged the hippocampus (T3, Fig. 2a). As expected, 
compared to vehicle, the bilateral injection of muscimol in the dHC 30 minutes before 
training at PN24 significantly impaired long-term memory, confirming that, at this age, like 
in adulthood, hippocampal activity is required to form IA memory (Fig. 2b). Again, 
muscimol-injected rats were able to acquire the IA task after retraining (T3, Fig. 2b). 
Furthermore, dHC activity was not required for memory reinstatement. Compared to 
vehicle, bilateral dHC injection of muscimol 30 min before T, followed by RS 2 days later, 
did not affect memory reinstatement (T2, Fig. 2c). Likewise, a bilateral injection of 
muscimol into the dHC 30 min before RS had no effect on memory reinstatement (T2, Fig. 
2d).
Thus, the hippocampus plays a critical role in encoding and storing a latent IA memory trace 
at PN17 during the infantile amnesia period, but is not critical for later IA memory 
reinstatements.
Learning at PN17 induces pTrkB and GluN2B-2A subunit switch
We then compared the hippocampal expression profiles of molecules known to play critical 
roles in synaptic plasticity of PN17, PN24 and adult (PN80) rats, in either untrained 
conditions or following IA training. Because of their fundamental roles in plasticity and 
memory, including IA17, 21-23, as well as in development24, we examined the levels of brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the activation of the receptor TrkB (phosphorylation of 
TrkB, pTrkB) and the levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR or GluNR) 
subunits 1 (GluN1 or NR1), 2A (GluN2A or NR2A) and 2B (GluN2B or NR2B). Western 
blot analyses of dHC extracts revealed that while BDNF levels increased with developmental 
age (Fig. 3a), pTrkB was significantly higher in PN17 rats compared with adults, with PN24

 rats showing intermediate values (Fig. 3a). The level of total TrkB did not change across 
development (Supplementary Fig. 6). In line with previous data25, 26, we found that 
NMDARs significantly switch their subunit expression levels during postnatal development, 
going from an elevated expression ratio in favor of GluN2B to predominately expressing 
GluN2A (Fig. 3a). The level of GluN1 did not change with development (Supplementary 
Fig. 6). Strong evidence in the visual system and neonatal hippocampal slices support the 
idea that the GluN2B-2A subunit switch is driven by experience and neuronal activity during 
a developmental critical period, a temporally limited phase during which experience 
organizes normal functional development and permanently alter performance27, 28. Visual 
experience and deprivation rapidly and reversibly alter the NMDAR subunit composition in 
the visual cortex, modifying the duration of the critical period29-31. Here, we tested whether 
training at PN17 or PN24 differentially regulates the activation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway 
and the levels of GluN1, GluN2B and GluN2A over time. Rats were euthanized at 30min, 
9h, 24h, and 48h post-training. Controls consisted of naive rats euthanized at matched 
timepoints (to control for developmental changes independent of training), as well as rats 
exposed to shock-only or context-only (context exposure without footshock) and euthanized 
at matched timepoints (to control for changes induced by non-associative experience). 
Compared to naïve conditions, training at PN17 significantly increased pTrkB at 30min after 
training. The significant increase persisted and peaked at 24h after training (Fig. 3b). This 
profile of training-dependent increase in pTrkB was distinct from that found in rats trained at 
PN24 (Fig. 3c), in which the pTrkB augmentation peaked at 30 min after training and 
decayed thereafter. No significant changes were found in total TrkB levels at any of the 
timepoints after training at PN17 or at PN24 (Supplementary Fig. 6). Training at PN17 
increased also the level of BDNF but not significantly over that of the developmental 
increase (Fig. 3b), whereas training at PN24 significantly augmented BDNF levels at 9h and 
24h post-training (Fig. 3c).
At PN17, training led to a pronounced and significant induction of GluN2A starting 9h after 
training, which continued up to 48h after training; GluN2B levels increased more slowly and 
reached significance only at 24h after training, but not at the other timepoints (Fig. 3b). In 
contrast, training at PN24 did not change the levels of GluN2A and GluN2B (Fig. 3c). No 
significant changes were found in GluN1 levels throughout the temporal profiles of PN17 or 
PN24 rats (Supplementary Fig. 6). Thus, IA training significantly increases the GluN2A/2B 
ratio in the hippocampus of PN17 but not of PN24 rats (Fig. 3b).
To investigate the functional consequences of training on synaptic NMDAR composition in 
the hippocampus, we compared EPSCs at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in acute 
slices from PN17 and PN24 rats, in either untrained conditions or 24h after IA training. The 
NR2B component of the NMDAR EPSC was determined by sensitivity to ifenprodil, which 
selectively blocks receptors that contain NR2B subunits; thus, greater inhibition of the EPSC 
by ifendopril indicates a higher fraction of NR2B-containing receptors. In agreement with 
our biochemical findings (Fig. 3c), EPSCs from naive and trained PN24 rats showed 
essentially identical ifenprodil sensitivities (naive: 20.1 ± 4.3% inhibition, n=17 cells; 
trained: 20.7 ± 4.4%, n=7; p=.93, two-tailed t-test with Welch’s correction), and these 
groups were combined for subsequent analysis (Fig.3d). Ifenprodil had a significantly 
stronger effect on EPSCs from naive PN17 rats (37.2 ± 6.4%, n=12 cells; p=0.04) compared

 to PN24 rats. In contrast, the ifenprodil sensitivity of EPSCs from trained PN17 rats did not 
differ significantly from P24 rats (30.0 ± 6.1%, n=10 cells; p=0.38), consistent with training-
induced conversion of a subset of NMDARs from NR2A- to NR2B-containing in PN17 
animals.
Notably, the biochemical changes in NMDA receptor subunit composition found with both 
development or training strongly correlated with EPSC sensitivity to ifenprodil (Fig. 3e).
All the significant training-induced changes were selective for the associative conditioning 
and were not found in the shock-only or context-only controls (Supplementary Fig. 7).
No significant changes in pTrkB, GluN2A and GluN2B were found at 30 min or 24h after T
+RS, in line with our findings (Fig 2c and 2d) that the hippocampus plays a critical role in 
encoding the latent IA memory trace at PN17, but not in reinstatement, (Supplementary 
Figure 8).
We concluded that the latent memory trace acquired at PN17 is accompanied by an 
activation of TrkB (phosphorylation) and a significant switch in the GluN2A/2B expression 
level ratio in the hippocampus that persisted at least for 24 hours.
BDNF controls early memory formation and the GluN2B-2A switch
Given the above results, and that BDNF modulates the expression of NMDA receptors32, we 
then tested whether BDNF in the dHC of PN17 rats is required for the formation of the 
latent IA memory trace and/or the training-induced GluN2B-2A switch.
Hippocampal bilateral injection of either a function-blocking anti-BDNF antibody or its 
receptor scavenger TrkB-Fc, compared to control IgG, significantly disrupted memory 
reinstatement (T2, Fig. 4a and 4b) without affecting general locomotor behavior during 
training or testing (T1, Fig. 4a and 4b). Anti-BDNF- and TrkB-Fc-injected rats learned IA 
when retrained showing that anti-BDNF and TrkB-Fc had not damaged the hippocampus 
(T3, Fig. 4a and 4b). Furthermore, anti-BDNF blocked the training-induced increase in 
pTrkB and the GluN2B/2A switch at 24h after training (Fig.4c), a timepoint when the 
training-induced molecular changes peaked (Fig. 3b).
Thus, BDNF at training is necessary for the formation of latent infantile memory traces and 
training-induced NMDA receptor 2B-2A expression switch.
mGlur5-dependent GluN2B-2A switch rules early memory formation
We then asked whether the NMDAR subunits GluN2A and 2B are differentially recruited in 
the formation of the latent memory at PN17, and whether their contribution changes at PN24 
when the system is functionally competent. GluN2A and GluN2B differentially contribute to 
the NMDAR current kinetics33, thus differentially regulating synaptic plasticity34. Selective 
antagonists of GluN2A ([[[(1S)-1-(4-Bromophenyl)ethyl]amino](1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,3-
dioxo-5-quinoxalinyl)methyl] phosphonic acid tetrasodium hydrate, or NVP-AAM077 or 
PEAQX), or 2B ([R-(R*,S*)]-α-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-β-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-
piperidinepropanol hydrochloride hydrate, or Ro 25-6981) injected bilaterally into the dHC

 30 minutes before training at PN17 revealed that GluN2B but not GluN2A is required for IA 
memory formation (T2, Fig. 5a), without affecting acquisition or testing (T1, Fig. 5a). All 
rats acquired the IA task after retraining, indicating that the treatments did not damage the 
hippocampus (T3, Fig. 5a). In contrast, injection of either GluN2A or GluN2B antagonist 30 
min before training at PN24 significantly disrupted memory retention both 1d and 7d after 
training (Fig. 5b). Notably, the memory loss caused by the GluN2A antagonist at PN24 was 
complete at both T1 and T2, as in fact the retention of the GluN2A antagonist-injected rats 
was not significantly different from acquisition (Fig. 5b, Supplementary table 7). These 
results, in agreement with the relative higher expression levels, suggest that GluN2A plays a 
major role in NMDAR-mediated memory formation at PN24; in contrast, GluN2A has no 
effect on the formation of latent memories at PN17.
Because the GluN2B-GluN2A switch has been shown to require the activation of mGluR5 in 
CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices35 and mGluR5 knockout mice 
confirmed that the developmental GluN2B-GluN2A switch in CA1 is deficient35, we tested 
whether blocking mGluR5 in the dHC affects the training-induced switch of GluN2B-2A 
and memory formation at PN17 and/or PN24. Western blot analyses of dHC extracts of 
untrained rats revealed that mGluR5 levels are significantly higher at PN17 compared to 
adult age, with PN24 showing intermediate values (Fig. 5c).
Hippocampal bilateral injection of the mGluR5 antagonist 3-[(2-Methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-
yl)ethynyl]pyridine hydrochloride (MTEP) 30 min before training at PN17 blocked the 
training-induced GluN2B-GluN2A subunit switch 24h after training (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, 
compared to vehicle, the same MTEP treatment significantly prevented memory 
reinstatement without affecting latency at training or at the 7d test (Fig. 5e, Supplementary 
Table 7). The treatments did not damage the hippocampus as rats acquired IA when 
retrained (T3, Fig. 5e). Conversely, at PN24, the same MTEP treatment had no effect on 
memory retention 1d and 7d after training (Fig. 5f).
In addition, hippocampal injections of MTEP 30 min before IA training at PN17 blocked the 
training-induced increase in TrkB phosphorylation 24h after training, indicating that the 
mGluR5-TrkB pathways are functionally linked (Fig. 5g).
We concluded that the formation and storage of the latent memory trace during the infantile 
amnesia period, but not of a normally expressed memory formed a few days later, require 
GluN2B and the mGluR5-mediated GluN2B-GluN2A subunit switch, and that the activation 
of mGluR5 is functionally linked to that of TrkB.
BDNF or mGluR5 activation close the infantile amnesia period
Our data thus far indicate that mechanisms underlying the formation of a latent infantile 
memory trace are similar to those of developmental critical periods of sensory systems, 
including the experience-dependent switch of GluN2B-2A, requirement of mGluR5 and of 
BDNF. In the visual cortex, BDNF overexpression is sufficient to close the critical period by 
promoting structural maturation of cortical circuitry and precocious increase of visual 
acuity36, 37. Here we tested whether, likewise, increasing hippocampal BDNF at the time of 
training is sufficient to promote functional competence, thus closing the critical period of the

 infantile amnesia. BDNF bilaterally injected into the dHC immediately after training at 
PN17 led to significant and persistent memory expression 1d (T1) and 7d (T2) after training 
(Fig. 6a). The memory was context specific (NC, Fig. 6a). Furthermore, hippocampal BDNF 
injection, compared to vehicle, promoted a significant increase the phosphorylation of TrkB 
(Fig. 6b) and the GluN2B-2A switch (Fig. 6c).
As our previous data showed that mGluR5 is functionally linked and upstream the TrkB 
activation (Fig. 5g), we tested whether the activation of mGlur5 in the hippocampus at the 
time of training is, like BDNF, sufficient to close the infantile amnesia period. Dorsal 
hippocampus bilateral injection of the group I metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist 3,5 
dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), compared to vehicle, elicited a significant and persistent 
memory expression at 1d (T1) and 7d (T2) after training (Fig. 6d).
Thus, like for sensory system functions, an immature hippocampus employs critical period-
like mechanisms, which are regulated by experience, to mediate the formation of a latent 
memory trace during infantile amnesia. BDNF or activation of the upstream mGluR5 at the 
time of training can close the infantile amnesia period and induce functional competence.
Discussion
Using a model of episodic contextual fear memory in rats, here we reported that learning 
occurring during the infantile amnesia period (PN17) produces a persistent, latent retention 
of that experience; in fact, reminders given later in life reinstate a strong, context-specific 
and long-lasting memory. These data extend and provide an explanation for previous 
knowledge that early life experiences, including aversive, appetitive and spatial, affect 
behavior throughout life1, 38. In our paradigm, presentation of both context and footshock 
(RS) later in life are required to reinstate context specific memories, as exposure to either, 
alone, is not sufficient. We also found that once context exposure is experienced, the 
memory trace is accessible for a long time, as in fact it can form an association with a RS 
given days later. However, as RS given before context is unable to reinstate the memory, we 
speculate that an associative reactivation is needed in order to reinstate the memory, which is 
presumably driven by CS-anticipatory responses39. Possibly, the reinstatement protocol 
reflects a facilitated conditioning that builds on the established latent memory trace. 
Conversely, rats at PN24 were fully competent in learning and expressing IA memory, as 
their retention after training was similar to that of adult rats. Thus, the infantile amnesia 
period for explicit memories appears to show a relatively sharp temporal boundary.
Although thus far it has been debated whether the memory learned at PN17 is 
forgotten 1-3, 7, 8, and whether an hippocampal-dependent contextual learning at PN17 in rats 
occurs at all 18-20, our data show that long-lasting changes through BDNF and mGluR5-
dependent mechanisms take place in the dorsal hippocampus with training to store a latent 
representation. These mechanisms are unique to PN17, and include a prolonged activation of 
the BDNF pathway, a mGluR5-dependent switch in the ratio of GluN2B/GluN2A 
expression, and a functional switch toward synaptic GluN2A engagement. These data 
indicate that the hippocampal system, like sensory systems34, 35, matures and develop in 
response to experience by switching the NMDAR subunit composition. In fact, while the

 latent memory formed at PN17 requires mGluR5 and GluN2B but not GluN2A, the strong 
memory formed by the functionally competent PN24 hippocampus requires GluN2A but not 
mGluR5. These data are in line with previous reports that a mGluR5-dependent GluN2B-
GluN2A switch occurs in vitro in the developing hippocampus after acute activity, and 
parallel the mechanisms described in the developing visual cortex after visual stimuli28, 35. 
The GluN2B-GluN2A switch is in fact classically known as a critical mechanism by which 
excitatory synapses rapidly mature in response to experience during sensory developmental 
critical periods and acquire integrative capacity28-31,40-42. Our results indicating that similar 
mechanisms occur in the developing hippocampal memory system lead us to propose that 
infantile amnesia reflects the existence of a developmental critical period of the 
hippocampus, and that the functional maturation of the hippocampal system occurs through 
learning experience. Synaptic strength may also change as a result of IA training. These 
additional mechanisms as well as circuits important for infantile memories shall be 
investigated in future studies.
In agreement to what has been reported for the visual or auditory system critical 
periods36, 37, 43, we found that activating mGluR1/5 or increasing BDNF in the dHC 
accelerates hippocampal functional competence for memory formation and expression and 
anticipates the end of the critical period. It is possible that, as shown for sensory systems, 
BDNF regulates the balance of excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) neurotransmission in the 
hippocampus during the developmental critical period27, and further studies shall address 
this issue. Our data also revealed that mGluR5 and BDNF are functionally linked in 
promoting hippocampal competence, as in fact the persistent activation of TrkB depends on 
mGluR5 activation. This link may represent an important node of dysregulation in 
neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome44.
In sum, we suggest that experience-driven, mGluR5- and BDNF-mediated GluN2B-2A 
subunit switch during a developmental critical period is not only typical of sensory systems, 
but represents a ubiquitous process in the developing brain for acquiring mature, functional 
competences. This competence, for the hippocampus, includes the ability to form explicit, 
associative long-term memories. This would also explain how early experiences influence 
brain development45 and how experience deprivation in early development impacts learning 
abilities throughout life46. We suggest that alteration of the experience-dependent critical 
period mechanisms of the medial temporal lobe, thus of related networks, may 
fundamentally contribute to the etiology of developmental learning disabilities, including 
autism spectrum disorder, mental retardation and neuropsychiatric disorder in general.
METHODS
Animals
Seventeen- and 24-day old male and female rats were obtained from E10/11 pregnant Long 
Evans female rats (Charles River Laboratories). Pre-weaning rats were housed with their 
littermates and mother in 30.80 cm × 40.60 cm × 22.23 cm plastic cage, containing ALPHA-
dri® bedding, under a 12h light/dark cycle (light on at 07.00 a.m.) with food and water ad 
libitum. All experiments were carried out during the light cycle. The birth date was 
considered PN0 and the litters were culled to 10-12 pups (6 males and 6 females, if

 applicable) on PN1 and only one male and/or female per litter was used in any experimental 
condition. After weaning (P21), rats were group-housed (2-5 per cage). All procedures 
complied with the US National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory 
Animals and were approved by the New York University Animals Care Committees.
Inhibitory avoidance
Inhibitory avoidance (IA) was carried out as previously described17. The IA chamber (Med 
Associates Inc., St. Albans, VT) consisted of a rectangular Perspex box divided into a safe 
compartment and a shock compartment (each 20.3 cm × 15.9 cm × 21.3 cm). The safe 
compartment was white and illuminated and the shock compartment was black and dark. 
The apparatus was located in a sound-attenuated, non-illuminated room. During training 
sessions, each rat was placed in the safe compartment with its head facing away from the 
door. After 10 s, the door separating the compartments was automatically opened, allowing 
the rat access to the shock compartment. The door closed automatically when the rat entered 
the shock compartment with all four limbs, and a foot shock (2 s, 1 mA) was administered. 
Foot shocks were delivered to the grid floor of the shock chamber via a constant current 
scrambler circuit. Animal remained in the dark compartment for additional 10 s before was 
returned to its home cages until testing for memory retention at designated timepoints. As 
controls, we used naïve animals (handled and remained in their home cage) and rat exposed 
to a footshock without the IA context experience (shock-only). Shock-only consisted in 
placing the rat onto grid of the shock compartment and, immediately after, delivering a 
footshock of the same duration and intensity used in IA training. This protocol does not 
induce any association between the context and the foot shock. Retention tests were done by 
placing the rat back in the safe compartment and measuring its latency to enter the dark 
compartment. Foot shocks were not administered during the retention tests (unless otherwise 
specified), and testing was terminated at 900 s. During retraining session, rats were tested 
for memory retention and received a footshock upon entering into the dark compartment. 
Locomotor activity was measured in the inhibitory avoidance chamber by automatically 
counting the number of times each rat crossed the invisible infrared light photosensor during 
training and testing. All behavioral tests were carried out blind to training and/or treatment 
conditions. For biochemical studies, rats were not tested for memory retention. Reminder 
foot shocks (RS) were administered in a novel, neutral chamber with transparent walls at 
identical duration and intensity to that of training. Context generalization was tested in a 
new, modified IA box with a smooth plastic floor and decorated colorful walls, located in a 
different experimental room.
Hot-plate test for pain threshold
The hot-plate (HP) test for pain threshold was performed as previously described47. The 
apparatus consists of a round white ceramic hot-plate surface (20cm diameter) set at 53 
± 1°C and contiguous with and extended area (brown cardboard) at room temperature. The 
test was performed with naive PN17 and PN24 rats. Pain threshold was measured by the 
escape latency to withdrawal from the hot plate. The escape latency was averaged from four 
sessions, with 15-min interval between each session.

 Hippocampal cannula implants and injections
On PN15 or PN22, pups were anesthetized with isoflurane mixed with oxygen. Stainless 
steel cannulas (26-gauge) were implanted bilaterally in the dorsal hippocampus (for PN15, 
3.0 mm anterior, 2.2 mm lateral and 2.3 mm ventral from bregma; for PN22: 3.4 mm 
anterior, 2.2 mm lateral and 2.5 mm ventral from bregma) through holes drilled in the 
overlying skull. The cannulas were fixed to the skull with dental cement. After recovery 
from the surgery, pups were returned to the dam and littermates (for PN15) or their 
homecage (for PN22) for a 2-day recovery period until experimental manipulations. 
Hippocampal injections used a 33-gauge needle that extended 1 mm beyond the tip of the 
guide cannula and connected via polyethylene tubing to a Hamilton syringe. Injections were 
delivered at a rate of 0.1 μl min−1 using an infusion pump on a total volume of 0.3 μl per 
side over 3min. The injection needle was left in place for 2 min after the injection to allow 
complete diffusion of the solution. Muscimol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, cat# M1523) 
was dissolved in physiological saline (0.9%) and injected at 0.1 μg per side. This dose of 
muscimol has been successfully used to disrupt long-term contextual fear conditioning when 
injected into the hippocampus18. The antibody anti-BDNF (Millipore, Billerica, MA cat# 
AB1513P) or control IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# I5131) were dissolved in 1x PBS and 
injected at 0.5 μg per side. Recombinant human TrkB-Fc chimera (R&D Systems) was 
dissolved in PBS and injected at 0.5 μg per side. The same dose of anti-BDNF and TrkB-Fc 
had been shown to disrupt long-term contextual fear memory consolidation when injected 
into the hippocampus17. [R-(R*,S*)]-α-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-β-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-
piperidinepropanol hydrochloride hydrate (Ro 25-6981, Sigma-Aldrich, cat# R7150) and 
[[[(1S)-1-(4-Bromophenyl)ethyl]amino](1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,3-dioxo-5-
quinoxalinyl)methyl] phosphonic acid tetrasodium hydrate (PEAQX or NVP-AAM077 
tetrasodium hydrate, (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# P1999) were dissolved in 1x PBS and injected at 
0.5 μg per side. The same doses of the drugs have been shown to modulate LTP in vitro and 
to impair spatial and contextual memory when injected into hippocampal CA1 and anterior 
cingulate cortex33, 48. 3-(2-Methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride (MTEP) 
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA cat# ab120035) was dissolved in PBS and injected at 1.0 μg per 
side. This dose has been used in vitro to control the activity-dependent switch in NMDAR 
subunit35 and in vivo to attenuated the expression morphine-associated contextual memory 
when injected into the nucleus accumbens49. Recombinant BDNF (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, 
NJ, cat# 450-02) was dissolved in 1x PBS and injected at 0.25 μg per side. This dose was 
shown to rescue memory impairment caused by inhibition of hippocampal protein synthesis 
and glucocorticoid receptor17. (S)-3,5 dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) (Sigma-Aldrich, 
cat# D3689) was dissolved in PBS and injected at 2 ng per side. This dose was shown to 
enhance fear memory when injected into the basolateral amygdala50. To verify proper 
placement of the cannula implants, rats were euthanized at the end of the behavioral 
experiments and their brain frozen in isopentane, sliced in 40μm coronal sections in a -20°C 
cryostat and examined under a light microscope for cannula placement. Rats with incorrect 
placement (6%) were discarded from the study.

 Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was carried out as previously reported17. Rats were euthanized and 
their brains were rapidly removed and frozen in isopentane. Dorsal hippocampus punches 
were obtained with a neuro punch (19 gauge; Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA) from 
frozen brains mounted on a cryostat. Samples were homogenized in ice cold RIPA buffer 
(50mM Tris base, 150mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Na-Deoxycholate, 1% NP-40) with 
protease and phosphatase inhibitors [0.5mM PMSF, 2mM DTT, 1mM EGTA, 2mM NaF, 
1μM Microcystine, 1mM Benzamidine, 1mM Sodium Orthovanadate and commercial 
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma Aldrich)]. Protein concentrations were 
determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Equal 
amounts of total protein (20 μg per lane) were resolved on denaturing SDS-PAGE gels and 
transferred to Immobilon-FL Transfer membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. Membranes 
were dried, reactivated in methanol and washed with water, before they were blocked in 5% 
(wt) milk and TBS for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with 
primary antibody overnight at 4 °C in solution according manufacturer's suggestion. 
Antibodies to TrkB (1:1000, cat# 4603s) and NMDAR2B (1:1000, cat# 5580) were 
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), mGluR5 (1:1000, Abcam, cat# 
76316), pTrkB (1:10,000, Abcam cat # 2149-1 or 1:1000, Millipore, cat# 1381), NMDAR2A 
(1:1000, Millipore, cat# 07-632), anti-BDNF (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, 
CA, cat# sc-546,). The membranes were then washed TBS with 0.2% Tween20 (TBST) and 
incubated with a species-appropriate fluorescently conjugated secondary antibody [goat anti-
mouse IRCye 680LT (1:10,000) or goat anti-rabbit IRDye 800CW (1:10,000) from LI-COR 
Bioscience (Lincoln, NE)] for 1h at room temperature. Membranes were again washed in 
TBST and scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging system (Li-Cor Bioscience). Data 
were quantified using pixel intensities with the Odyssey software according to the protocols 
of the manufacturer (Li-Cor). Actin (1:20,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat# sc-47778) 
was used to co-stain all membranes and used as loading control for all markers.
Whole-cell patch electrophysiology
Rats were trained in IA and euthanized 24 hours later. 200-μm-thick slices of dorsal 
hippocampus were prepared in ice-cold sucrose cutting solution (in mM: 1.25 Na2HPO4, 3 
KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 254 sucrose, 10 dextrose, 2 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2) on a vibratome (Leica 
VT1000). The slices recovered while submerged at 30 °C for 30 minutes in bubbled ACSF 
(in mM: 1.25 NaH2PO4, 3.5 KCl, 24 NaHCO3, 118 NaCl, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl2, and 11 
dextrose; pH=7.4), followed by at least 30 minutes at room temperature. Recordings were 
obtained in submersion chambers superfused with room temperature ACSF, using a 
Multiclamp 700B and Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices). Area CA3 was dissected away 
immediately prior to recording to eliminate recurrent feedback contamination. Cells were 
visualized on an Olympus BX51W1 microscope with DIC-IR optics, and whole-cell 
recordings made from pyramidal cells in the CA1 region. Signals were filtered using a 2 kHz 
lowpass filter and digitized at 20 kHz, and no adjustment was made for pipette junction 
potential. All recordings were made using pipettes filled with (in mM): 130 Cs-
methanesulfonate, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 8 NaCl, 5 TEA-Cl, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 10 
Na-phosphocreatine, 1 QX-314; 290 – 300 mOsM, pH=7.3. All NMDA mediated currents 
were recorded at Vm = +40 mV in the presence of picrotoxin (50 μM) and NBQX (10 μM).

 Ifenprodil (3 μM) was washed in for 20 min prior obtaining recordings to measure ifenprodil 
sensitivity. NMDA EPSCs were evoked by a 100-μs monophasic stimuli delivered by a 
bipolar electrode at Vm = +40 mV, and EPSC amplitude was limited to ≤ 200 pA. 
Recordings at each age were taken from naive and trained animals in pairs to control for 
maternal rearing. All drugs were obtained from Tocris Bioscience.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed with the Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc.). No statistical methods were 
used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those generally 
employed in the field. No randomization was used to collect all the data. Statistical analyses 
were designed using the assumption of normal distribution and similar variance among 
groups, but this was not formally tested. The data were analyzed by one- or two-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc tests. One-way ANOVA followed by 
Newman–Keuls post hoc tests was performed when comparing groups where a pairwise post 
hoc analysis of each group was required. One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc 
tests was used when each group was compared with a single control group. One-way 
ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons was used for electrophysiology experiments. 
Two-way ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests were used when two factors were 
compared (e.g., treatment and testing). For paired comparisons, Student’s t-test was used. 
All analyses are two-tailed. The significance of the results was accepted at p < 0.05.
