Abstract
Background—Readmission within 30 days after hospitalization for heart failure is a major 
public health problem.
Objective—To examine whether timing and type of post-discharge follow-up impacts risk of 30-
day readmission in adults hospitalized for heart failure.
Design—Nested matched case-control study (January 1, 2006 to June 30, 2013).
Setting—A large, integrated healthcare delivery system in Northern California.
Participants—Hospitalized adults with a primary diagnosis of heart failure discharged to home 
without hospice care.
Measurements—Outpatient visits and telephone calls with cardiology and general medicine 
providers in non-emergency department and non-urgent care settings were counted as follow-up 
care. Statistical adjustments were made for differences in patient sociodemographic and clinical

 characteristics, acute severity of illness, hospitalization characteristics and post-discharge 
medication changes and laboratory testing.
Results—Among 11,985 eligible adults, early initial outpatient contact within 7 days after 
discharge was associated with lower odds of readmission (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.81, 95% CI: 
0.70–0.94), whereas later outpatient contact between 8 and 30 days after hospital discharge was 
not significantly associated with readmission (adjusted OR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.82–1.19). Initial 
contact by telephone was associated with lower adjusted odds of 30-day readmission (adjusted OR 
0.85, 95% CI 0.69–1.06) but was not statistically significant.
Conclusions—In adults discharged to home after hospitalization for heart failure, outpatient 
follow-up with a cardiology or general medicine provider within 7 days was associated with a 
lower chance of 30-day readmission.

Heart failure (HF) poses a substantial health and economic burden nationally and is expected 
to grow significantly in the next two decades in the United States.1, 2 Improving the 
efficiency and effectiveness of HF care after hospitalization has been a major focus among 
payers and policy makers to reduce HF-related costs and morbidity. Among Medicare 
patients hospitalized for HF, more than 20% are readmitted within 30 days and the most 
common reason for re-hospitalization is HF.3, 4 A significant fraction of readmissions after 
HF hospitalizations are seen as preventable given substantial hospital-level variation in 
readmission rates that are not explained by differences in patient characteristics.5 In 2013, 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began to penalize hospitals with 
higher than expected risk-adjusted readmission rates for HF through reduced Medicare 
payments.6
Multiple, small randomized studies of post-discharge interventions after hospitalization for 
HF have reported mixed results, with two meta-analyses suggesting possible benefit with 
various types of interventions, including home visits, clinic visits, and telephone calls.7–12 A 
larger randomized trial in high-risk patients in Canada showed no benefit from a 
combination of interventions (home visits, clinic appointments, and telephone calls), but the 
interventions were fragmented from the patients’ usual care providers.13 On the other hand, 
in an observational study relying on clinical registry data linked to administrative claims 
from hospitals of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, hospitals in the lowest quartile of 
one-week post-discharge follow-up rates after HF admissions had the highest 30-day 
readmission rates.14
The implications for health systems of implementing a policy focusing on early follow-up 
strategies are substantial with regards to resource utilization and workflow. To address this, 
we examined a large, contemporary cohort of adults hospitalized with HF who were 
carefully characterized longitudinally through a comprehensive electronic health record 
within an integrated healthcare delivery system to explore the association between different 
post-discharge outpatient HF management strategies and the risks of readmission at 30 days.

 METHODS
Study Participants
The study was conducted within Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large, integrated 
healthcare delivery system that provides comprehensive care to more than 3.7 million 
members within the San Francisco Bay Area. Its membership is highly representative of the 
local surrounding and statewide population, except for slightly lower representation at the 
extremes of age and income.15, 16 We included subjects hospitalized from January 1, 2006 
through June 30, 2013 with a primary discharge diagnosis of HF (International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition [ICD-9] codes 398.91, 402.01, 402.11, 402.91, 
428.0, 428.1, or 428.9) which has been shown to have a positive predictive value of >95% 
for clinical heart failure.17 We excluded patients who died during their index hospitalization 
or who were discharged to a location other than their home (e.g., skilled nursing facility or 
hospice facility). Patients on chronic dialysis or discharged to home hospice were also 
excluded, because these groups had structured, pre-determined outpatient contact schedules.
Post-Discharge Follow-up Patterns
The main exposure of interest was the frequency, timing and type of follow-up within the 
first 30 days post-discharge. Relevant post-discharge follow-up was defined as outpatient, 
non-emergency department telephone calls or clinic visits with internal medicine, family 
medicine, or cardiology providers. Visits to providers outside of these specialties were 
excluded because they were unlikely to have been directly involved in HF management. 
Urgent care and emergency department visits were also excluded because these contacts 
were likely due to clinical deterioration instead of planned follow-up after hospitalization.
The initial patient contact after hospital discharge was used to categorize follow-up as either 
in clinic or by telephone. Providers conducting telephone calls were trained to monitor 
patient symptoms, vital signs and weights recorded at home; initiate, discontinue or change 
medications; request laboratory and other diagnostic testing, and schedule in-person clinic 
visits. There was no ability to see the patient or conduct a physical examination through a 
telephone visit. Non-physician providers conducting telephone calls included nurses and 
pharmacists who were trained to follow an outpatient HF treatment protocol. Non-physician 
providers may or may not have previously known the patient prior to hospital discharge. 
Internal medicine and cardiology physicians following up with patients generally were 
familiar with the patient before hospital discharge. Outpatient contacts that only involved 
diagnostic testing, such as electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, or radiological studies, 
were also excluded. Finally, visits that only occurred for a specific procedure, such as a 
vaccination or an infusion, were also excluded.
The timing of the first post-discharge follow-up, the number of post-discharge telephone 
calls and clinic visits within 30 days, and clinic vs. telephone contact were used to 
characterize the type of post-discharge follow-up each patient received. The timing of the 
first post-discharge follow-up was categorized as within 1–7 days, 8–30 days, or no follow-
up within 30 days after discharge. Follow-up within 7 days was selected because a prior 
study suggested that follow-up in this early time period could be beneficial for reducing

 readmissions.14 The number of post-discharge contacts was calculated by counting the 
number of outpatient contacts meeting the above criteria.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of interest was all-cause readmission within 30 days of index hospital 
discharge. All-cause readmissions at health plan-owned and outside facilities were defined 
as any inpatient admission after discharge from the index hospitalization, excluding 
emergency department visits not resulting in admission, and were identified from 
comprehensive hospital discharge and billing claims databases. The health plan billing 
claims databases are highly reliable for detecting the small fraction of hospitalizations 
outside of plan-owned facilities. Censoring due to death or disenrollment from the health 
plan was also ascertained. Deaths were comprehensively identified from Kaiser Permanente 
hospitalization files, administrative records (e.g., proxy reporting), California state death 
certificate files18 and Social Security Administrative vital status files.19
Covariates
Age, gender, self-reported race/ethnicity, and census-based estimates of graduation from 
high school and of annual household income above $35,000 were identified from health plan 
databases. We also controlled for the calendar year of index hospitalization for HF. We 
ascertained information on coexisting illnesses based on diagnoses or procedures using 
ICD-9 codes, laboratory results, or specific therapies from health plan hospitalization 
discharge, ambulatory visit, laboratory, and pharmacy databases; diabetes mellitus 
registry;20 and regional cancer registry.21 The baseline diagnoses were determined at the 
time of admission for the index HF hospitalization, which included acute myocardial 
infarction, unstable angina, stroke, prior coronary bypass graft surgery, prior percutaneous 
coronary intervention, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, atrial fibrillation or flutter, 
implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement, permanent pacemaker implantation, 
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, systemic cancer, chronic liver disease, chronic lung disease, 
mitral or aortic valvular disease, dementia, and depression. Left ventricular (LV) systolic 
function was determined from review of relevant diagnostic test results found in the 
electronic medical record surrounding the index date. LV systolic function was classified 
into one of four categories: normal or hyperdynamic (LV ejection fraction ≥ 50%), mild LV 
systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction 40–49%), moderate LV systolic dysfunction (LV 
ejection fraction 30–39%), or severe LV systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction < 30%).
Baseline and time-updated laboratory measurements of estimated glomerular filtration rate, 
serum potassium level, and hemoglobin level were ascertained. Estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR, ml/min/1.73 m2) was calculated using the CKD-EPI equation22 based 
on ambulatory, non-emergency department serum creatinine measurements. The outpatient, 
non-emergency department laboratory values closest in time before the index HF 
hospitalizations were used to determine baseline laboratory values. Time-varying values of 
laboratory results were ascertained throughout the follow-up period using health plan 
laboratory databases. A laboratory test was defined as any outpatient test for serum 
creatinine level, serum potassium level, hemoglobin, or B-type natriuretic peptide.

 We also controlled for outpatient receipt of β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), hydralazine, nitrates, loop 
diuretics, thiazide diuretics, potassium supplementation, digoxin, and calcium channel 
blockers based on dispensing found in ambulatory pharmacy databases. Baseline medication 
use was determined at the time of admission for the index HF hospitalization. As described 
previously,23 longitudinal medication use was estimated from drug refill patterns using the 
calculated day supply for each prescription. We also adjusted for the number of changes in 
HF medication (defined above) and laboratory tests completed during the follow-up period, 
as these processes of care may be markers of illness severity. A change in HF medication 
was defined as addition, discontinuation, or change in dose.
To account for the severity of illness during the index hospitalization, we also adjusted for 
the hospital length of stay and a validated laboratory-based acute physiology (LAP) score.24 
Statistical models that used the combination of the LAP score and a comorbidity score to 
estimate inpatient mortality and 30-day mortality after admission were validated in a cohort 
of 409,305 hospitalizations within KPNC from 2002 to 2005.24 The c statistic for the model 
estimating inpatient mortality was 0.88, while that for 30-day mortality was 0.86. The LAP 
score was calculated from serum albumin; anion gap; arterial pH, PaCO2, and PaO2; 
bicarbonate; total serum bilirubin; blood urea nitrogen; serum creatinine; serum glucose; 
serum sodium; serum troponin I; hematocrit; and total white blood cell count. Eligible 
laboratory test results were those obtained in the 24-hour time frame preceding 
hospitalization.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.3 (Cary, N.C.). Baseline 
characteristics at the time of admission for the index HF hospitalization are presented as 
means with standard deviations and frequencies with percentages. Crude readmission rates 
within 30 days were calculated for each category of post-discharge outpatient follow-up. 
Each type of follow-up was compared to no follow-up within 30 days using Student’s t-test.
We conducted a nested matched case control study with conditional logistic regression to 
examine the independent association between post-discharge follow-up variables and the 
outcome of all-cause readmission after appropriately addressing potential survivor bias 
through individual-level matching on duration of available follow-up time among cases and 
controls to ensure equal opportunity to receive follow-up care. This is critical as patients can 
receive more follow-up solely due to surviving and not being readmitted to the hospital. For 
each case, we randomly selected five eligible controls that were matched by amount of 
follow-up time. For example, a patient readmitted 10 days after hospital discharge would be 
considered a case. All patients who had not been readmitted by the 10th day of follow-up 
would then be eligible to be a control for this particular case. Cases and their controls 
matched by follow-up time from hospital discharge would have equal opportunity to receive 
follow-up care. In addition, for patients with a hospital readmission, only eligible outpatient 
contacts before the first readmission were analyzed in the regression models for readmission 
as an outcome. Because death precludes readmission, there is the possibility that higher rates 
of death could lead to lower rates of readmission. Therefore, patients who died within 30

 days of discharge without a readmission were excluded from the all-cause readmission 
analysis to address this possible effect of competing risk between death and readmission. 
Finally, missing laboratory and LVEF data were assigned to a separate “missing” category.
Three separate conditional logistic regression models were created, one for each exposure of 
interest: frequency, timing and type of follow-up. These exposures were not included in the 
same model because there was significant correlation between them. For each regression 
model, all the covariates described previously were used to adjust for residual differences 
between patients.
RESULTS
Study Sample and Patient Characteristics
We identified 11,985 eligible adults who were hospitalized for HF between January 1, 2006 
and June 30, 2013, who were not receiving chronic dialysis, and who were discharged to 
home without hospice care. From this eligible study population, we identified 1,587 cases 
who were readmitted to the hospital within the first 30 days post-discharge. These cases 
were then matched with 7,935 eligible controls individually matched on having the same 
follow-up time as the corresponding case. Case patients were significantly older and had 
more comorbidities than control patients, including being more likely to have a heart failure 
hospitalization in the prior year, a history of myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation or 
flutter, valvular disease, diabetes, depression, dementia, lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney 
disease and anemia (Table 1).
Index Hospitalization Characteristics and Post-Discharge Follow-up
Median length of stay for the index hospitalization was 3.0 days (interquartile range 2 to 5 
days). The median laboratory-based acute physiology (LAP) score was 19 (interquartile 
range 9 to 31), which is associated with a predicted in-hospital mortality risk of between 1% 
and 5%.25 The timing, number and types of post-discharge follow-up contacts with a general 
medicine or cardiology provider are described for cases and controls in Table 2. Overall, 
about 70% of patients had either a clinic visit or a telephone call within 30 days of hospital 
discharge, with about 50% having contact within the first 7 days. The majority (84%) of the 
follow-up contacts were clinic visits, as opposed to telephone calls (16%). Almost all (94%) 
clinic visits were with physicians, while 45% of the telephone calls were made by non-
physician providers. There was no significant difference in 30-day follow-up between cases 
and controls (70% vs. 72%, P=0.10). However, cases were less likely to have follow-up 
within 7 days compared with controls (50% vs. 53%, P=0.01)
Crude Readmission Rates
The overall 30-day readmission rate for the study cohort was 13.2%, with an overall 30-day 
mortality rate of 3.0%. Crude rates of 30-day readmission stratified by follow-up timing, 
number, and type are shown in Figure 1. Any follow-up, regardless of timing, number, and 
type, was associated with a significantly lower crude risk of readmission within 30 days of 
discharge (P<0.01).

 Associations of Follow-up Characteristics and 30-day Readmission
In matched case-control analyses, follow-up within 7 days post-discharge was associated 
with 19% (95% CI: 6% to 30%) lower adjusted odds of readmission (Table 3) after 
extensive adjustment for comorbidities, hospitalization characteristics, severity of acute 
illness, laboratory values, baseline HF medication use, and the number of laboratory checks 
and HF medication changes. Initial contact after 7 days post-discharge was not significantly 
associated with lower adjusted odds of readmission. Initial contact by clinic visit was 
associated with a 15% (95% CI: 2% to 27%) lower adjusted odds of readmission. Initial 
contact by telephone—frequently conducted by non-physicians—was associated with lower 
adjusted odds of 30-day readmission (adjusted OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69–1.06) but was not 
statistically significant. The adjusted odds of readmission within 30 days of discharge was 
lower for 1 to 2 follow-up contacts compared to no follow-up. Greater than 2 contacts 
trended toward lower odds of readmission with a similar point estimate, but did not meet 
statistical significance. The detailed regression model results are available for viewing on-
line (Tables, Supplemental Digital Content 1, 2, and 3).
DISCUSSION
Within a large, diverse integrated healthcare delivery system, we found that the timing of 
initial follow-up was a significant factor affecting the odds of readmission in a contemporary 
sample of mostly older adults discharged following hospitalization for acute heart failure. 
Follow-up within one week was independently associated with 19% lower odds of 
readmission, whereas initial follow-up after one week was not significantly associated with 
readmission. Compared to no follow-up, 1 or 2 total contacts within 30 days of hospital 
discharge and initial contact by clinic visit were independently associated with lower odds of 
readmission. Early telephone call follow-up was associated with a trend toward lower 30-
day readmission rates.
We systematically explored how various aspects of follow-up (timing, type, and total 
number) were associated with 30-day readmission. Our study findings extend existing 
limited evidence that early follow-up within 7 days of hospital discharge is beneficial for 
preventing readmission in patients with heart failure.14 There was no benefit observed with 
initial contact between 8 to 30 days after discharge compared to no follow-up at all (adjusted 
OR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.82–1.19). One novel finding that may warrant further study is that early 
initial contact by telephone—which was frequently (45%) conducted by non-physician 
providers (e.g., nurses or pharmacists)—had a trend toward decreased odds of 30-day 
readmission (adjusted OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69–1.06). The point estimate of the odds ratio for 
initial contact by telephone was the same as for initial contact through a clinic visit. 
However, the confidence interval was wider, because only 12% of patients had initial 
contact by telephone, as compared to 60% of patients with initial contact in clinic.
Outside of initial contact 8 to 30 days after hospital discharge which showed no beneficial 
association, we observed similar strengths of association between various types of post-
discharge follow-up and lower odds of readmission (odds ratios 0.81 to 0.87) compared to a 
previous observational study.14 However, our observations were different from various other 
studies that showed no benefit for post-discharge follow-up.13, 26–29 Post-discharge follow-

 up as observed in our study may have had a greater impact on reducing 30-day readmission 
compared to these other studies for multiple reasons. Our study was conducted in a fully 
integrated health care delivery system with a single electronic medical record, compared 
with other more fragmented systems of care.13 Additionally, only follow-up contacts with 
internal medicine, family medicine, or cardiology providers were included, as opposed to 
any type of physician follow-up.14 General medicine and cardiology providers are more 
likely to address HF-specific care and post-hospitalization issues that could affect 
readmission. In our study, patients who were discharged to hospice care or to a nursing 
facility or receiving chronic dialysis were also excluded, because they were effectively 
placed in a different system of care that either had different goals of care or did not involve 
short-term outpatient follow-up. By excluding patients who are predictably near death and 
placed in hospice care and those discharged to nursing homes, the follow-up interventions 
advocated by current HF guidelines30 were likely to be more effective in patients who would 
be most likely to benefit from them.
Systematic follow-up after hospital discharge for HF is generally regarded as likely to 
reduce readmission and is actively being employed in many hospital systems.31 However, 
what is not fully known is how specific aspects of follow-up care, including timing, provider 
type (i.e., nurse, pharmacist, physician), method of contact (i.e., telephone, video, clinic, in-
home), and extent of coordination with other providers, affects the effectiveness of 
interventions. A systematic review of 21 randomized trials of transitional care, not 
specifically for HF patients, implied that higher intensity follow-up, specifically with home 
visits, reduced readmission.32 However, a recent, significantly larger randomized trial 
showed that intensive follow-up with combination of home visits, telephone calls, and clinic 
visits did not show reduction in readmission in high risk patients.13 Some major reasons for 
the lack of benefit, as cited by authors, were lack of coordination with primary care 
physicians and incompatibility of electronic medical records. These study data support that a 
high degree of care coordination in addition to greater intensity of follow-up may be 
important for reducing readmission.
With the advent of accountable care organizations and the mandate for meaningful use of 
the electronic medical record, healthcare delivery systems in the United States are becoming 
more integrated and transparent between networks of providers.33, 34 Our results imply that 
clinicians may be able to leverage this increasing integration to improve the effectiveness of 
transitional care and reduce hospital readmissions in high-risk populations. While an initial 
in-person clinic visit was associated with reduced odds of 30-day readmission, an early 
initial contact by telephone with a physician or non-physician provider may be more 
practical to implement by many healthcare delivery systems compared with clinic visits for 
all patients. Although we did not show a definitive benefit for initial contact by telephone, 
this specific finding warrants further investigation.
In an observational study, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of unmeasured 
confounders and residual treatment selection bias, despite our ability to adjust for a large 
number of individual-level patient and hospitalization characteristics and use of individual-
level matching to account for differential follow-up time among patients. Differences in 
disease severity or other patient characteristics could have led to a higher or lower likelihood

 of both early follow-up and readmission. Indeed, we observed that cases tended to be more 
ill than the controls, as measured by age and comorbid conditions, and that adjustment for 
these differences strengthened the association between early follow-up and lower odds of 
readmission. Also, the study was conducted within an integrated healthcare system with a 
comprehensive electronic medical record, which could have potentiated the observed benefit 
of outpatient follow-up. Our findings may not be fully generalizable to other practice 
settings with less transparency and coordination of care between hospital and outpatient 
locations. Data regarding LV systolic function was unavailable for approximately a third of 
the study cohort, so we were unable to evaluate potential effect modification of follow-up 
patterns and LV systolic function on 30-day outcomes.
In conclusion, early in-person clinic follow-up with general medicine or cardiology 
providers within 7 days after a HF hospitalization was independently associated with lower 
odds of readmission within 30 days. Initial contact with telephone calls—nearly half being 
conducted by non-physicians—showed a trend towards lower odds of readmission. Our 
study provides strong evidence that systematic, early in-person clinic follow-up after HF 
hospitalization could decrease 30-day readmission. Early telephone follow-up, which is 
easier for patients and health care providers, may also offer similar benefit as an in-
person clinic visit.
