Abstract
BACKGROUND—The safety and efficacy of vaccines to prevent Ebola virus disease (EVD) 
were unknown when the incidence of EVD was peaking in Liberia.
METHODS—We initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of the chimpanzee 
adenovirus 3 vaccine (ChAd3-EBO-Z) and the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine 
(rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP) in Liberia. A phase 2 subtrial was embedded to evaluate safety and 
immunogenicity. Because the incidence of EVD declined in Liberia, the phase 2 component was 
expanded and the phase 3 component was eliminated.
RESULTS—A total of 1500 adults underwent randomization and were followed for 12 months. 
The median age of the participants was 30 years; 36.6% of the participants were women. During 
the week after the administration of vaccine or placebo, adverse events occurred significantly more 
often with the active vaccines than with placebo; these events included injection-site reactions (in 
28.5% of the patients in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group and 30.9% of those in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP 
group, as compared with 6.8% of those in the placebo group), headache (in 25.1% and 31.9%, vs. 
16.9%), muscle pain (in 22.3% and 26.9%, vs. 13.3%), feverishness (in 23.9% and 30.5%, vs. 
9.0%), and fatigue (in 14.0% and 15.4%, vs. 8.8%) (P<0.001 for all comparisons); these 
differences were not seen at 1 month. Serious adverse events within 12 months after injection were 
seen in 40 participants (8.0%) in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group, in 47 (9.4%) in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-
GP group, and in 59 (11.8%) in the placebo group. By 1 month, an antibody response developed in 
70.8% of the participants in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group and in 83.7% of those in the rVSVΔG-
ZEBOV-GP group, as compared with 2.8% of those in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both 
comparisons). At 12 months, antibody responses in participants in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group 
(63.5%) and in those in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP group (79.5%) remained significantly greater 
than in those in the placebo group (6.8%, P<0.001 for both comparisons).

 CONCLUSIONS—A randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of two vaccines that was 
rapidly initiated and completed in Liberia showed the capability of conducting rigorous research 
during an outbreak. By 1 month after vaccination, the vaccines had elicited immune responses that 
were largely maintained through 12 months. (Funded by the National Institutes of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases and the Liberian Ministry of Health; PREVAIL I ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT02344407.)
The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) Outbreak that began in December 2013 in western Africa 
created new challenges for the design and implementation of protocols to test experimental 
vaccines and therapeutic agents. After a request for investigational interventions from the 
Liberian minister of health to the secretary of health and human services in the United States 
in October 2014, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) engaged in discussions with the 
Liberian Ministry of Health regarding possible studies. On the basis of those discussions and 
projections of a substantial number of new cases in the coming months,1 planning for a 
vaccine trial commenced under the auspices of a U.S.–Liberian clinical research partnership 
currently called the Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia (PREVAIL).
Preclinical data were available on two candidate Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccines, the 
chimpanzee adenovirus 3–based vaccine (ChAd3-EBO-Z) and the recombinant vesicular 
stomatitis virus–based vaccine (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP), which were in phase 1 testing. In 
order to evaluate these vaccines rapidly, a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial 
(PREVAIL I) was designed with the aim of preventing EVD; the trial included an embedded 
phase 2 subtrial to evaluate safety and immunogenicity. The phase 3 trial was not completed 
because of a declining number of EVD cases and, ultimately, the end of the epidemic. The 
results of the phase 2 subtrial are now reported.
METHODS
TRIAL DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS
In this randomized, double-blind trial, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the 
ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine and the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine as compared with a saline 
placebo.2 GlaxoSmithKline provided ChAd3-EBO-Z, and Merck provided rVSVΔG-
ZEBOV-GP.
The phase 2 subtrial was powered to compare antibody responses to EBOV and the 
percentage of grade 3 or 4 adverse events 1 month after injection. (Details about the grading 
of toxic effects are provided in Section 3 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org.) Other safety measurements included injection-site 
reactions, targeted signs and symptoms (i.e., signs and symptoms that trial personnel asked 
participants specifically about), unsolicited reports of adverse events (i.e., adverse events 
that participants reported although they had not been asked specifically about them by trial 
personnel), and changes in complete blood counts and results of serum chemical tests.
Persons with a history of EVD, those with a temperature of more than 38°C, and women 
who were pregnant or breast-feeding were excluded from participation. Volunteers 18 years 
of age or older who consented to the requirements of the protocol (available at NEJM.org)

 were randomly assigned in a 2:1:2:1 ratio to receive an intramuscular injection of the 
ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine (2 ml, at a concentration of 1×1011 particle units per milliliter), 2 ml 
of placebo, the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine (1 ml, at a concentration of 2×107 plaque-
forming units per milliliter), or 1 ml of placebo (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix; the 
high-level molecular structures of the vaccines are also described in Section 3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The 1:1:1 ratio for the analyses was obtained by combining the 
two placebo groups.
The trial investigators were unaware of the interim summary results throughout the trial. An 
independent data safety and monitoring board sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases reviewed interim analyses that were focused on safety.
The trial protocol was approved by the National Research Ethics Board of Liberia, the 
institutional review board of the National Cancer Institute, the Liberian Medicines and 
Health Products Regulatory Authority, and the Food and Drug Administration. Written 
informed consent was obtained from all the participants during a private session after they 
attended information sessions during which the trial was explained to potential volunteers in 
small groups with the use of pictorial flip charts.
The trial was designed and the data analyzed by the senior authors and biostatisticians. Data 
were collected by the investigators and staff at Redemption Hospital and the Liberian 
Institute for Biomedical Research. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of 
the analyses and data reported and also confirm adherence to the protocol. The initial draft 
of the manuscript was written by the first two authors and last two authors, and all the 
authors provided final approval to submit the manuscript for publication. Representatives of 
Merck and Glaxo-SmithKline participated in the review of the protocols and the manuscript 
and provided their approvals to both.
FOLLOW-UP
Follow-up visits occurred at week 1, month 1, and month 2 and then every 2 months 
thereafter through 12 months, with blood samples obtained at week 1 and at months 1, 6, 
and 12. In April 2015, the protocol was amended to include a follow-up visit at week 2 to 
look specifically for joint problems. This amendment was made after findings from a phase 
1 study of the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine showed that 22% of the participants reported 
arthritis.3 This amendment applied to the participants who underwent randomization after 
April 14, 2015 (20% of all participants). Participants with medical conditions that were 
identified during follow-up were referred for counseling and medical care.
ANTIBODY RESPONSES TO EBOLA GLYCOPROTEIN
IgG antibody levels against the Ebola surface glycoprotein were measured in serum at 
baseline and at week 1 and months 1, 6, and 12 with the use of the Filovirus Animal 
Nonclinical Group (FANG) assay (Section 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Antibody 
levels were also measured in plasma at days 3, 10, and 14 in 24 participants for whom 
rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP shedding was measured on those days.

 A participant was considered to have a positive vaccine response at a follow-up visit if the 
log10 titer was increased by a factor of 4 or more from the baseline value (see Section 3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix) and if the participant had not had an elevated titer at baseline. 
All the laboratory measurements were performed in Liberia. At the time of the trial, there 
were no facilities in the country for measuring T-cell responses.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The two active vaccine groups were each compared with the pooled placebo group and 
analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Statistical analyses were performed 
with the use of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and R software.4 All P values are 
two-sided. P values for clinical events were based on Barnard’s test, and those for injection-
site reactions and symptoms on Fisher’s exact test. Given the many comparisons with no 
adjustment for type I error, we recommend caution in interpreting P values between 0.05 and 
0.01.
RESULTS
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PARTICIPANTS
After a community-based social mobilization strategy about the trial and about Ebola, 
volunteers were encouraged to visit the vaccination center at Redemption Hospital in 
Monrovia, Liberia. From February 2, 2015, to April 30, 2015, a total of 1500 volunteers who 
attended the vaccination center and consented to participate in the trial were enrolled (500 
participants per group). In the last month of enrollment, recruitment efforts were focused on 
enrolling women. The groups were well balanced at baseline (Table 1). The median age of 
the participants was 30 years, and 36.6% of the participants were women. All the 
participants who underwent randomization received an injection of vaccine or placebo.
Overall, the median IgG antibody level against EBOV at baseline was 78 enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay units (EU) per milliliter (interquartile range, 47 to 139; 5th and 95th 
percentiles, 22 and 548). A total of 4.0% of the participants had antibody levels of more than 
607 EU per milliliter, a level that denoted a positive antibody response at baseline (Section 3 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
FOLLOW-UP
The rate of attendance at follow-up visits through 12 months was 98.3% and was similar 
among the three trial groups (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). There were no cases 
of EVD (defined as a positive result on reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction 
assay for Ebola virus RNA) in the trial participants during the follow-up period.
SAFETY
Serious Adverse Events at 1 Month and 12 Months—Within 1 month after 
injection, the time period during which serious adverse events that are due to vaccination are 
likely to occur, 20 participants had a serious adverse event, including 6 participants (1.2%) 
in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group, 6 (1.2%) in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP group, and 8 (1.6%) in 
the placebo group (P = 0.68 for the comparison of each vaccine with placebo) (Table 2, and

 Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 70% of the serious adverse events in 
the first 30 days after injection were attributed to malaria.
Over the 12 month follow-up period, a serious adverse event occurred in 40 participants 
(8.0%) in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group, in 47 (9.4%) in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP group, and in 
59 (11.8%) in the placebo group (Table 2, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Most of the serious adverse events were attributed to malaria (71% overall). Malaria 
developed in fewer participants in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group than in the placebo group (5.2% 
vs. 8.8%, P = 0.03); a similar finding was observed in participants in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-
GP group (6.6%, vs. 8.8% in the placebo group; P = 0.25) (Table 2).
By 12 months, one death had occurred among participants in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group, five 
among those in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP group, and six among those in the placebo group 
(Table 2, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). None of the deaths were attributed 
to EVD.
In the small subgroup of participants who were positive for the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), none who had received an active vaccine had a serious adverse event within 1 
month after injection; one of the participants who had received placebo died from 
Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (see Section 4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Over a 
period of 12 months, in this subgroup, at least one serious adverse event occurred in 4 of 25 
participants (16%) in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group (one event was attributed to malaria, two 
were attributed to gastroenteritis, and one was a death from an unknown cause), in 1 of 22 
(5%) in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP group (two events attributed to gastroenteritis and 
respiratory failure), and in 6 of 31 (19%) in the placebo group (five events attributed to 
malaria and one death, as cited above). Participants who received a diagnosis of HIV 
infection, syphilis, or another incidentally discovered health issue were referred to the local 
health care system for follow-up.
Injection-Site Reactions, Targeted and Unsolicited Symptoms, and Laboratory 
Variables—During the week after injection, injection-site reactions were reported in 28.5% 
of the participants in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group and 30.9% of those in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-
GP group, as compared with 6.8% of those in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both 
comparisons) (Table 2).
Targeted symptoms (one or more) were reported more often in each vaccine group than in 
the placebo group at week 1 (P<0.001 for both comparisons). At month 1, the percentage of 
participants who reported targeted symptoms did not differ significantly between either 
vaccine group and the placebo group (Table 2). Three participants in each vaccine group had 
a grade 2 symptom at week 1. All the remaining symptoms at week 1 and all the targeted 
symptoms that were reported at month 1 were of grade 1. The most commonly reported 
symptoms were headache, muscle pain, feverishness, and fatigue (Fig. 1). The percentage of 
participants who reported joint pain and other joint problems did not differ significantly 
between either vaccine group and the placebo group at 1 week, 2 weeks, or 1 month (Fig. 1). 
Specific unsolicited symptoms that were reported are summarized in the Supplementary 
Appendix. There was no pattern to the unsolicited symptoms that were reported for each

 vaccine. There were no clinically significant laboratory changes in any of the groups. Details 
are provided in Section 4 and Tables S4 through S8 in the Supplementary Appendix.
MEASUREMENT OF RVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP ON RT-PCR
A total of 24 participants participated in a substudy to measure plasma levels of rVSVΔG-
ZEBOV-GP RNA by means of reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) 
assays on days 3, 10, and 14. RNA was detected in the plasma of 2 of 8 participants who had 
been assigned to receive rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP and in none of those who had been assigned 
to receive ChAd3-EBO-Z or placebo. One participant had rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP RNA on 
day 3 but not on days 10 and 14, whereas the results in the second participant were positive 
on days 3 and 10 but not on day 14.
ANTIBODY RESPONSES TO EBOV GLYCOPROTEIN
Antibody responses to the two vaccines were greatest at month 1 and then declined at 6 
months and 12 months (Table 3 and Fig. 2). As compared with the placebo group, in which 
the rate of antibody response was 2.8%, the rate of antibody response at month 1 was 70.8% 
in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group and 83.7% in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP group (P<0.001 for 
both comparisons). Findings were similar in subgroups that were defined according to age at 
baseline, sex, and previous contact with a person who had EVD; the percentage of 
participants with an antibody response to each vaccine was lower among participants with 
HIV infection than among those without HIV infection (Tables S9 and S10 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
At 12 months, the rate of antibody response was 63.5% in the ChAd3-EBO-Z group and 
79.5% in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP group, as compared with 6.8% in the placebo group 
(P<0.001 for both comparisons). Analyses that included all the participants regardless of the 
antibody titer at baseline and analyses that included participants with a titer level of 200 EU 
or less per milliliter at baseline and in which a response was defined as an increase in the 
titer from baseline by a factor of 4 showed similar results (Tables S11 and S12 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). In a small subsample, IgG antibody titers at days 3, 10, and 14 
were similar in each active vaccine group (Table S13 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Log10-transformed antibody titers are summarized in Table 3, and in Figure S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. In each vaccine group, the geometric mean titer levels differed 
significantly from those in the placebo group at each follow-up time point. At week 1, the 
differences were small, but by month 1, antibody titers had increased substantially in the two 
vaccine groups. The geometric mean titer was 621 EU per milliliter in the ChAd3-EBO-Z 
group and 1000 EU per milliliter in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP group, as compared with 75 
EU per milliliter in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The differences in 
the geometric mean titer at month 6 and month 12 between each vaccine group and the 
placebo group were also significant (P<0.001 for all comparisons). Additional descriptive 
statistics regarding the changes in antibody titer levels are provided in Figures S2 and S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.

 DISCUSSION
The data from this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ChAd3-EBO-Z and 
rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP show that by 1 month after injection the two vaccines, as compared 
with placebo, elicited an immune response (antibodies to the EBOV surface glycoprotein) 
that was largely maintained through 12 months. No safety concerns were identified.
In the two vaccine groups, side effects were generally not severe, were time-limited, and 
were similar to reports from phase 1 studies that used various doses of the two vaccines.3,5–9 
The incidence of joint problems did not differ significantly among the three groups. We did 
not see the frank arthritis that was reported in another study (conducted in Geneva) and that 
has been thought to be due to the direct replication of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP in the joints.5 
Reasons for this difference in the occurrence of arthritis among the participants enrolled in 
Geneva and the Liberian participants in our trial are not clear.
An unexpected finding was that the percentage of participants in whom malaria developed 
by 12 months was lower in each active vaccine group than in the placebo group, 
significantly so for those who received ChAd3-EBO-Z. Such heterologous or off-target 
effects of vaccines to enhance immunity in an antigen-nonspecific manner have been 
observed with some childhood vaccinations, and the presence of malaria has recently been 
reported to be associated with an improved outcome in patients with EVD,10 a finding that 
suggests possible cross-reactive immunity.11,12 To determine whether this finding is possibly 
a result of trained immunity13 or a chance finding (as stated in the Methods section, P values 
of <0.05 but not <0.01 should be interpreted cautiously), future studies are needed.
The two vaccines elicited the production of antibodies to the EBOV surface glycoprotein. 
Responses at 1 week were modest with the two vaccines. By 1 month, the immune response 
was much greater in participants who received either vaccine than in those who received 
placebo, and this response was largely maintained through 12 months. Immune response did 
not vary according to age, sex, or previous contact with a person who had EVD. The 
immune response in participants with HIV infection was smaller than in those without HIV 
infection in the two vaccine groups, but only 78 enrolled participants (5.2%) had HIV 
infection. To establish the efficacy and safety of these vaccines in this subgroup, future 
studies will need to enroll more participants with HIV infection and others with immune 
dysfunction. It is possible that booster vaccinations may need to be considered in such 
persons.
The immune response that was observed with the two vaccines increased by 14 days after 
injection in a sample of 24 participants who were selected for frequent measurements. This 
response pattern is consistent with limited data from phase 1 studies.6,7 The clinical 
significance of these changes is difficult to assess because of the lack of an identified 
correlate of protective immunity, the lack of licensed assays to measure antibodies against 
EBOV, and the lack of reference standards for measuring antibodies against EBOV 
infection. Given that time may be of the essence in responding to an outbreak of Ebola, the 
rapidity of an immune response as well as magnitude and durability of an immune response 
are all desirable characteristics of an EBOV vaccine.

 The results of the ring vaccination trial that was conducted in Guinea highlight the 
importance of a vaccine that provides a rapid immune response.14,15 Although the rVSVΔG-
ZEBOV-GP vaccine was reported to provide protection from EVD in an analysis that 
included events that occurred 10 or more days after randomization, 41 of 64 events that were 
reported in the analysis cohort occurred before the 10-day cutoff, with 20 in the group 
assigned to immediate vaccination and 21 in the group assigned to delayed vaccination. 
Thus, the rapidity of the immune response is an important consideration for the vaccines that 
were used in a ring vaccination strategy and would be useful to assess in future research 
efforts.
Our trial has some limitations. First, the trial did not include children. The demonstration of 
safety and efficacy of these vaccines in children is a priority, since 16% of the persons with 
EVD in the current epidemic were children.16 Second, as previously noted, the lack of an 
identified laboratory correlate of protective immunity makes it difficult to assess the clinical 
significance of any long-term antibody changes. Finally, we could not establish whether 
either vaccine was effective in preventing EVD since the number of cases of EVD declined 
drastically in Liberia owing to a concerted public health effort that succeeded in ending the 
outbreak in Liberia before the PREVAIL I trial could be expanded to its phase 3 component. 
Even though the trial began in early February 2015, once an infrastructure for the trial had 
been established and the vaccines became available, too much time had elapsed. This 
situation emphasizes the importance of completing phase 1 studies before outbreaks occur 
and of being prepared to initiate phase 2 and phase 3 trials as soon as such outbreaks occur.
Placebo controls were an important strength of this trial for the evaluation of safety 
outcomes. At the time that this trial was designed and implemented, there were no 
completed and published phase 1 studies. Thus, it was critical that this trial be able to assess 
safety objectively. Whether studies are conducted in the context of an outbreak or otherwise 
does not change the principles of science and the potential biases in studies that lack 
adequate controls. One might argue that rigorous study designs that provide a rapid and 
reliable answer are even more important in the context of an emergency. The randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial was acceptable to participants and Liberian officials, enrollment was 
accomplished at a single site in 3 months, and the completeness of follow-up was 98.3% at 
12 months.
The inclusion of two vaccines that had advanced through phase 1 by January 2015 was also 
a strength of the trial. The opportunity to collaborate with the respective companies and the 
use of a common placebo group were efficient and responsible approaches, given the 
urgency of the public health need.
In conclusion, the results observed with the ChAd3-EBO-Z and rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP 
vaccines in this trial extended our knowledge of their safety and immunogenicity. The results 
point to further research to be conducted in order to be better prepared for future outbreaks 
of EVD.

 Figure 1. Targeted Symptoms Reported at Week 1
Shown are the percentages of participants who reported the indicated symptom at the week 1 
visit in the placebo group, in the group that received the recombinant vesicular stomatitis 
virus–based vaccine (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP), and in the group that received the chimpanzee 
adenovirus 3–based vaccine (ChAd3-EBO-Z). Symptoms are ordered according to the 
frequency with which they were reported by participants in the placebo group. Symptoms 
were prespecified in a checklist (i.e., targeted) at the week 1 visit.

 Figure 2. Geometric Mean Titers after Randomization
Shown are the geometric mean IgG antibody titers against the Ebola virus surface 
glycoprotein among participants who did not have an elevated level (>607 enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay units [EU] per milliliter) at baseline. I bars indicate 95% confidence 
intervals. Titers were measured at week 1, month 1, month 6, and month 12 in serum in the 
ChAd3-EBO-Z group, the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP group, and the placebo group. Antibody 
titers had a skewed distribution and were log10-transformed. Geometric means were 
determined by back-transforming the transformed means and confidence intervals to the 
original scale. P values for the comparison of each active vaccine group with the placebo 
group were significant at a level of less than 0.001 at each visit, except at week 1, at which 
time the P value was 0.004 for the comparison of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP with placebo.

*Response was defined as a log10 titer that was increased by a factor of 4 or more from the baseline value among participants without an elevated antibody level at baseline. The P values for group 
comparisons of the geometric mean titer were based on the log10 titer values at the specified visit, with the baseline log10 titer as a covariate in analysis of covariance. The P values for the group 
comparisons of the percentage of participants with a response were based on Fisher’s exact test. CI denotes confidence interval.
