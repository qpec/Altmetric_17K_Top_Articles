World Hepatitis Day —  
July 28, 2018
World Hepatitis Day is commemorated each 
year on July 28 with the goal of promoting aware-
ness and inspiring action to prevent and treat 
viral hepatitis. The World Health Organization’s 
(WHO’s) theme of this year’s World Hepatitis Day 
is “Test. Treat. Hepatitis” to underscore the urgent 
need to scale up testing and treatment activities.
WHO estimated that globally in 2015, approxi-
mately 325 million persons were infected with 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus 
(1). Among the estimated 257 million persons 
infected with HBV in 2015, nearly 900,000 died, 
primarily as a result of complications of cirrhosis 
and hepatocellular carcinoma (1). In 2016, the 
World Health Assembly endorsed viral hepatitis 
elimination goals set by WHO, defined as a global 
reduction of 90% in incidence of and 65% in 
mortality from hepatitis B and hepatitis C by 
2030 (1).
This issue of MMWR features a report on 
progress toward access to hepatitis B treatment 
worldwide. Overall, hepatitis B treatment cover-
age is low among countries in all income strata. 
Increased awareness of, access to, and availability 
of affordable diagnostics, and training of health 
care providers might increase access to treatment.

Worldwide, an estimated 257 million persons are living with 
chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (1). To achieve the 
World Health Organization (WHO) goals for elimination 
of HBV infection worldwide by 2030, defined by WHO as 
90% reduction in incidence and 65% reduction in mortality, 
access to treatment will be crucial. WHO estimated the care 
cascade* for HBV infection, globally and by WHO Region.

database. The international price of tenofovir was estimated 
using WHO’s global price reporting mechanism (GPRM), 
and for entecavir from a published study (2). In 2016, among 
the estimated 257 million persons infected with HBV world-
wide, approximately 27 million (10.5%) were aware of their 
infection, an estimated 4.5 million (16.7%) of whom were 
on treatment. In 2017, all low- and middle-income coun-
tries (LMICs) could legally procure generic entecavir, and all 
but two LMICs could legally procure generic tenofovir. The 
median price of WHO-prequalified generic tenofovir on the 
international market fell from $208 per year in 2004 to $32 per 
year in 2016. In 2015, the lowest reported price of entecavir 
was $427 per year of treatment (2). Increased availability of 
generic antivirals effective in treating chronic HBV infection 
has likely improved access to treatment. Taking advantage of 
reductions in price of antivirals active against HBV infection 
could further increase access to treatment. Regular analysis of 
the hepatitis B treatment care cascade can assist in monitoring 
progress toward HBV elimination goals. 
Hepatitis B vaccination among infants has increased glob-
ally (3); in 2015, the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in 
children aged <5 years was estimated at 1.3% (1). However, 
HBV infection remains prevalent among adults, with an esti-
mated 257 million persons (3.5% of the population) living 
with chronic HBV infection worldwide in 2015 (1). Persons 
with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk for cirrhosis 
and hepatocellular carcinoma, and nearly 900,000 persons die 
annually from HBV-related outcomes, primarily from these 
sequelae of infection (1).
In 2015, WHO issued guidelines for the management of 
chronic HBV infection, particularly for LMICs (4). The avail-
able medications suppress viral replication and can decrease 
mortality (4), but the need for treatment is potentially lifelong. 
Access to treatment is limited in LMICs, because of lack of 
awareness among patients, cost and availability of quality 
diagnostics, cost of medicines, and lack of trained health care 
providers (1). In 2016, the World Health Assembly endorsed 
WHO viral hepatitis elimination goals, defined as a 90% reduc-
tion in incidence and a 65% reduction in mortality worldwide 
for both hepatitis B and hepatitis C by 2030 (1). To reach the 
mortality reduction goals for HBV elimination, a major scal-
ing up of treatment will be needed. This report assesses global 
progress in access to hepatitis B treatment in 2016 (1).
WHO described the sequential stages of hepatitis B care that 
persons living with HBV infection go through from diagnosis 
to viral suppression (the care cascade) (5). The 2015 WHO 
estimates of the number of persons infected with HBV were 
used as the denominator (1). In each country, the estimated size 
of the population infected with HBV, the number of persons 
treated, the proportion of infected persons who had received 
a diagnosis, and the proportion treated were obtained from 
published estimates (6). Estimates of the size of the popula-
tion that had received a diagnosis of HBV infection were 
derived from the following data sources (in order of priority):

1) national notifications; 2) published studies; 3) blood dona-
tion screening data; and 4) extrapolations from neighboring 
countries. The number of persons treated for HBV infection 
was estimated using the following data sources (in order of 
priority): 1) national reports; 2) sales audit data of generic 
tenofovir; 3) published studies; and 4) national experts’ esti-
mates. To use medicine sales audit data, the annual number 
of treatment units sold were converted into the number of 
treated patients using the average number of units per patient. 
Assuming 90% viral suppression among patients with full 
adherence (1,6) and 80% treatment adherence, it was estimated 
that globally, 72% achieved effective viral suppression (1,6). 
The country cascade estimates were weighted by population 
size. Data from all regions were summed to generate a global 
estimate that was stratified by WHO region§ and four World 
Bank income groups.¶
The patent and licensing status of entecavir and tenofovir, the 
two WHO-recommended HBV medications, influence medi-
cine prices (7). The relevant U.S. patents of medicines were 
identified from the Food and Drug Administration Orange 
Book (8). Information on the patent status was then collected 
from the relevant offices, and the global coverage of tenofovir 
with voluntary licenses was analyzed using data obtained from 
the Medicines Patent Pool’s database, MedsPaL.
The international price of tenofovir was estimated using 
WHO’s GPRM,** which reports market price of WHO-
prequalified commodities used for human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) response based on transactions reported by major 
purchasers (e.g., the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS 
Relief [PEPFAR], the Global Fund, South Africa, United 
Nations Children’s Fund [UNICEF]). Because the GPRM 
does not monitor the price of entecavir, which is not a first-line 
HIV medicine, the price reported in a 2015 study was used to 
estimate the price of this medicine (2).
Among the estimated 257 million persons infected with 
HBV worldwide, an estimated 27 million (10.5%) had received 
a diagnosis and were aware of their infection in 2016, 4.5 mil-
lion (16.7%) of whom were estimated to be receiving HBV 
treatment (Figure 1). Treatment coverage was low among coun-
tries in all income strata, but highest (22%) in upper middle-
income countries (Figure 2). In 2017, all LMICs could legally 
procure generic entecavir, while all but two LMICs (China and 
Mexico) could legally procure generic tenofovir. However, the 
relevant patents in China and Mexico are set to expire in 2018. 
Tenofovir patents in the United States and Europe also expired 
 § Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, and 
Western Pacific.

WHO region and by national income group and was highest in 
the Western Pacific region and upper middle-income countries. 
Price reduction for antiviral medicines and inclusion of the 
treatment in the various health insurance packages in China 
(1) probably led to a major increase in the number of persons 
treated, which likely accounts for the higher treatment cover-
age in this region. Africa has among the highest prevalence of 
HBV infection and highest mortality from liver cancer in the 
world (1). However, in the African region, with the exception 
of a few demonstration projects (9), and for persons with HIV-
HBV coinfection who are on antiretroviral regimens (current 
antiretroviral treatment regimens include medications active 
against HBV infection), no national programs are known to 
provide testing, care, and treatment services for all persons 
with HBV infection.
Although the price of medicines effective against HBV 
infection have decreased sharply in LMICs, the findings from 
this analysis indicate underutilization of low-price, generic 
medicines effective against HBV. Greater community aware-
ness and better understanding of the national disease burden, 
access to and availability of affordable diagnostics, and trained 
providers are needed to promote increased access to care.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, WHO-endorsed global estimates of the proportion 
of patients with HBV infection eligible for treatment (not all 
HBV infected persons should be on treatment, based on disease 
stage) are not available (4); therefore, it was not possible to 
estimate how many more persons currently require treatment 
in addition to the 4.5 million already receiving treatment. 
Second, the estimates of the number of persons on treatment 
are based on data sources of variable quality, and the results 
needed to be generalized by region/country when data were not 
available. Third, methods used to obtain information on the 
price of entecavir and tenofovir came from different sources. 
However, the published study that estimated the price of ente-
cavir reported prices for tenofovir that were comparable with 
the data obtained from the GPRM. Fourth, it was not always 
possible to determine whether tenofovir was prescribed as part 
of HIV-related antiretroviral regimen or for HBV infection 
alone. Finally, no systematic mechanism is available to monitor 
the prices of HBV medicines sold in the private sector.
Development and use of the global HBV care cascade 
can assist in monitoring progress toward the WHO 2030 
HBV elimination goals. Refinements in the care cascade to 
account for the proportion of HBV-infected persons who are 
not eligible for treatment could improve estimate precision. 
Increased access to generic HBV medicines through price 
reductions might lead to a larger proportion of HBV-infected 
persons receiving treatment. Development of a national viral 
hepatitis control strategy is an important step for increasing 
access to treatment for persons with chronic HBV infection, 
particularly in countries with a large disease burden (1). 
Development of such strategies might open the way to public 
sector procurement of medicines and diagnostics that can 
lower prices. Among patients with HBV infection, those with 
cirrhosis should be prioritized for treatment, because they are

Summary
What is already known on the topic?
An estimated 257 million persons were living with chronic 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in 2015.
What is added by this report?
Among persons living with HBV worldwide, approximately 
27 million (10.5%) were aware of their infection, including 
4.5 million (16.7%) who were on treatment. In 2017, all but two 
low- and middle-income countries could legally procure generic 
entecavir or tenofovir, the medicines active against HBV 
infection. The median price of generic tenofovir fell by >85% 
from 2004 to 2016. However, global treatment coverage of HBV 
was low.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Access to treatment could be increased by taking advantage of 
reductions in price of antivirals active against HBV infection.  
at increased risk for developing life-threatening complications. 
WHO is in the process of establishing a reporting system to 
monitor the cascade of care globally to allow for regular report-
ing. The potential future availability of a functional cure for 
HBV infection will further improve the prospects of achieving 
the 2030 elimination targets (10).
