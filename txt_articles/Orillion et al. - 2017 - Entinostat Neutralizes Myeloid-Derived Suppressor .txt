Abstract
Purpose: Recent advances in immunotherapy highlight the
antitumor effects of immune checkpoint inhibition despite
a relatively limited subset of patients receiving clinical benefit.
The selective class I histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat has
been reported to have immunomodulatory activity including
targeting of immune suppressor cells in the tumor microenviron-
ment. Thus, we decided to assess whether entinostat could
enhance anti–PD-1 treatment and investigate those alterations
in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that con-
tribute to the combined antitumor activity.
Experimental Design: We utilized syngeneic mouse models of
lung (LLC) and renal cell (RENCA) carcinoma and assessed
immune correlates, tumor growth, and survival following treat-
ment with entinostat (5 or 10 mg/kg, p.o.) and a PD-1 inhibitor
(10 and 20 mg/kg, s.c.).
Results: Entinostat enhanced the antitumor effect of PD-1
inhibition in two syngeneic mouse tumor models by reducing
tumor growth and increasing survival. Entinostat inhibited
the immunosuppressive function of both polymorphonuclear
(PMN)- and monocytic-myeloid derived suppressor cell (M-
MDSC) populations. Analysis of MDSC response to entinostat
revealed significantly reduced arginase-1, iNOS, and COX-2
levels, suggesting potential mechanisms for the altered func-
tion. We also observed significant alterations in cytokine/
chemokine release in vivo with a shift toward a tumor-sup-
pressive microenvironment.
Conclusions:
Our
results
demonstrate
that
entinostat
enhances the antitumor effect of PD-1 targeting through
functional inhibition of MDSCs and a transition away from
an
immune-suppressive
tumor
microenvironment.
These
data provide a mechanistic rationale for the clinical testing
and potential markers of response of this novel combina-
tion in solid tumor patients. Clin Cancer Res; 23(17); 5187–201.

Introduction
Momentum in the field of cancer immunotherapy has been
significantly accelerating as several durable and effective can-
cer treatments based on promoting an antitumor immune re-
sponse are now available for patients with solid tumors,
including renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). The PD-1/PD-L1 axis plays a central role in the
immune evasion capability of tumor cells by hampering the
antitumor activity of cytotoxic T cells. Blocking these immune
checkpoints, which have been reported as being aberrantly
expressed on solid tumors such as RCC and NSCLC, has
recently led to the approval of nivolumab, pembrolizumab,
and atezolizumab in these diseases (1–4). However, despite
these significant clinical advances, the clinical benefits of
immunotherapies for RCC and NSCLC are restricted to a subset
of patients. Tumor escape due to immune tolerance and an
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) repre-
sents a major obstacle in maximizing the full clinical potential
of immune checkpoint inhibitors both in the indications where
they have shown activity and in expanding to tumor types
where these agents have not been as effective.
Entinostat is an oral, class I–specific histone deacetylase
inhibitor (HDACi) shown to disrupt the dynamic interactions
between the TME and host immune surveillance (5, 6). Tumor
cells classically avoid immune surveillance by releasing a
plethora of immune-suppressive factors and chemoattractants

 enabling tumor-promoting inflammation (7). HDAC inhibi-
tors can increase immunogenicity of tumor cells by activating
expression of tumor antigen, antigen presentation, and costi-
mulation molecules in tumor cells (6, 8). In addition, our
group has shown that entinostat synergistically enhances IL2
immunotherapy in the RENCA model by inhibiting the func-
tion of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) through
acetylation of the STAT3 transcription factor (5). Entinostat is
currently in clinical development for breast and lung cancer in
combination therapies.
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) represent a highly
immunosuppressive population of tumor-infiltrating immature
myeloid cells. These cells contribute to tumor immune escape
by inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell proliferation and driving Treg
induction (3, 9, 10). Recent studies have reported that in vitro
pan-HDAC inhibition may influence MDSCs to a more differ-
entiated status of macrophage or dendritic cell (DC; 6, 8, 11).
Alternatively, another study treating bone marrow precursor
cells with pan-HDAC inhibitors resulted in the expansion of
monocytic MDSC populations (6, 8, 12). Interestingly, a com-
bination of demethylating agent and HDAC inhibitor enhanced
the antitumor effect of combined PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibition
in colon and breast cancer models, and was associated with
decreased MDSCs (13).
In this study, our aim was to further understand the mech-
anistic basis for how entinostat targeting of MDSCs and alter-
ation of the immunosuppressive TME leads to enhanced
immune checkpoint inhibitor antitumor activity. We conducted
preclinical studies of entinostat in combination with anti–PD-1
antibody treatment in two syngeneic mouse models, RENCA
and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), and assessed the effect of
single agents and the combination on immune relevant end-
points. Our in vivo results, which we subsequently confirmed
using in vitro mechanism-based assays, demonstrate that the
significant antitumor activity of entinostat combined with
anti–PD-1 is associated with a direct impact of entinostat on
blocking the function of immunosuppressive tumor-infiltrating
MDSCs. Our characterization of entinostat-mediated changes in
enzymes, cytokines, chemokines, and other growth factors asso-
ciated with an immunosuppressive TME offers multiple candi-
dates to serve as potential biomarkers for ongoing clinical trials.
We believe our data further support the importance of targeting
MDSC function to enhance immune checkpoint blockade and
significantly advance the mechanistic rationale for the clinical
testing of entinostat combined with PD-1/PD-L1–targeted
therapies.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The RENCA-Luc murine RCC cell line, purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, National Cancer Insti-
tute), was stably transfected with a luciferase reporter in the Pili
laboratory. Cells were cultured using RPMI 1640 (Corning) with
10% FBS (Corning) and 1% pen/strep (Life Technologies). Cells
were incubated in an incubator maintained at 37�C and 5%
CO2. Confluent cells (75%–80%) were harvested for orthotopic
injection into the kidney of Balb/c mice using 0.25% Trypsin
(Corning) and suspended in a 1:1 ratio of Matrigel (Corning) and
DPBS (Gibco). LLC lung carcinoma and CT26 colon carcinoma
were obtained from the ATCC and cultured in DMEM (Corning
Incorporated) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals,
Inc.) and 1% antibiotics (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The cells
were harvested using 0.25% Trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc.), suspended in DPBS (Corning) as 200 mL containing 5 � 105
cells, and injected s.c. into the mice. After tumors were established,
the mice were randomized into 2 groups and orally treated with
10 mg/kg of entinostat daily. The J774M cell line was kindly
provided by Georgia Cancer Center (Dr. Kebin Liu) and cultured
with DMEM (Corning) media with 10% FBS (Corning) and 1%
pen/strep (Life Technologies). Cells were incubated in a 37�C
and 5% CO2. Confluent cells (70%–80%) were harvested using
a cell scraper and passaged as suggested for the parent cell line via
the ATCC guidelines.
Hematopoietic progenitor cells culture
Lineage-negative cells were purified from C57BL/6-na€
�ve
bone marrow cells using the lineage cell depletion Kit (Milte-
nyi). Na€
�ve bone marrow cells were subsequently treated with
biotinylated antilineage antibody and antibiotin microbeads,
and passed through the MACS column according to the man-
ufacturer's instruction. Lineage-negative cells were cultured in
RPMI (Corning Incorporated) supplemented with 10% FBS,
1% antibiotics, and 50 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc.) with 20 ng/mL of recombinant GM-CSF
(Invitrogen), at 50,000 cells/well in 24-well plates. Tumor
explant supernatants (TES) were obtained by culturing small
pieces of EL4 tumors with complete RPMI media for 24 hours.
On day 1, TES or media with DMSO or entinostat solution were
added into the wells at 10% to get the final concentration of
100 or 500 nmol/L entinostat. On day 3, the half of culture
supernatant was exchanged to fresh media supplemented with
20 ng/mL of GM-CSF with or without 10% TES. On day 6, the
cells were collected and analyzed by flow cytometric analysis, or
used for functional analysis.
Tumor, bone marrow, and spleen cells isolation
Live tumor sections were isolated from tumors, cut into small
pieces, and digested with an enzyme cocktail solution from the
mouse tumor dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec—130-096-730).
Tumors were incubated with the enzyme cocktail for 30 min-
utes at 37�C with agitation. The enzyme reaction was arrested
using PBS, cells were spun at 300 g, 4�C for 7 minutes,
resuspended in PBS, and mashed through a 70 mm cell strainer.
Translational Relevance
Despite the significant progress achieved with PD-1/PD-L1
inhibitors in the treatment of solid tumors, the majority of
patients still present with progressive disease following these
agents. Resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors may in
part be mediated by an immunosuppressive tumor microen-
vironment. Here we report that this suppressive microenvi-
ronment can be altered with entinostat treatment in two
distinct preclinical tumor models to enhance the antitumor
efficacy of PD-1 targeted therapy. Therefore, we identified an
effective combination strategy with anti–PD-1 inhibition and
entinostat that is being readily translated to patients with solid
tumors, including lung and renal cell carcinoma.

 Cells from these tumors were either used for flow cytometry
analysis or further processed and used for functional analyses.
Whole spleens and bone marrow were harvested from mice and
processed into single-cell suspensions. Cells were then washed,
lysed with red blood cell lysis buffer (Affymetrix 00-4333-57)
or using ammonium chloride lysis buffer, and cultured
in RPMI medium with 10% FBS, Pen (100 units/mL)–Strep
(100 mg/mL), 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 100 mmol/L non-
essential amino acids, 2 mmol/L L-Glutamine, and 55 mmol/L
BME, with anti-CD3 (eBioscience 16-0031-85) and anti-CD28
(eBioscience 5012503) antibodies for approximately 24 hours.
CD8þ T cells were then isolated using a CD8aþ T-cell isolation
kit from Miltenyi Biotec (130-104-075), stained with carboxy-
fluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; NC9759757), per the
manufacturer's protocol, and cocultured with MDSCs as de-
scribed below.
MDSC isolation and T-cell suppression assay
MDSCs were isolated from tumors using the Miltenyi Biotec's
Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cell Isolation Kit (130-094-538)
and cocultured with isolated CD8þ T cells in serially diluted
concentrations. T cells (1 � 105; isolated with a CD8aþ T-cell
isolation kit; Miltenyi Biotec) were cultured in plates with varying
numbers of either PMN-MDSCs or M-MDSCs isolated from
RENCA tumors for 16 to 18 hours. T cells isolated in the listed
method were cocultured with entinostat-treated J774M cells for
68 to 72 hours. Cells were then harvested, stained, and analyzed
via FACS analysis.
In vivo treatment
All procedures were performed and approved in strict accor-
dance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Indiana University School of
Medicine, Wistar Institute, and with the NIH Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animal guidelines. Female 5- to 6-week-
old Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Labs) were main-
tained in a temperature-controlled room with a 12/12-hour
light/dark schedule and food provided ad libitum. Confluent
RENCA-Luc cells (70%–80%) were harvested using 0.25%
Trypsin (Corning) and suspended in a 1:1 ratio of Matrigel
(Corning) and HBSS (Gibco), and 10 mL containing 1 � 104
cells was injected under the renal capsule. One week postin-
jection preliminary bioluminescence imaging was performed
and mice were randomized into four groups: control, entino-
stat, anti–PD-1 (Bio X Cell RPM1-14, rat IgG2a), or a combi-
nation of entinostat and anti–PD-1. Mouse tumors were seri-
ally imaged using a bioluminescent IVIS imaging machine. LLC
tumor–bearing mice were randomized into 4 groups (n ¼ 5) on
day 11 and orally treated with vehicle (1% DMSO) or entino-
stat solution (10 mg/kg) every day. Anti–PD-1 antibody (clone
RMP1-14, Bio X Cell) or isotype control antibody (clone 2A3,
Rat IgG2a, Bio X Cell) was i.p. administered on days 11, 14, 18,
and 21. Mice in the treatment groups were treated orally with 5
mg/kg entinostat for 5 days/week, and with PD-1 inhibitor 10
or 20 mg/kg (second survival study) i.p. from BioXCell, or a
combination treatment regimen.
Cell staining and flow cytometry
Splenocytes, tumor cell suspensions, and peripheral blood
cells were washed, blocked with Fc Block (anti-mouse CD16/32
mAb; BD Biosciences) at 4�C for 15 minutes, and stained
with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies against surface mar-
kers CD45(clone 30-F11), CD11b (clone M1/70), CD11c, Gr1
(clone RB6-8C5), Ly6C (clone AL-21), Ly6G (clone 1A8), F480
(clone BM8), I-Ab, I-Ad, CD8a (clone 53-6.7), and CD4 (clone
RM4-5) antibodies purchased from BioLegend, eBioscience, or
BD Biosciences. Cells were then fixed in a fixation/permeabi-
lization buffer (eBioscience) and stained with antibodies
against intracellular proteins, including FoxP3 (NRRF-30) and
Granzyme B (clone GB11). The antibodies were purchased
from BD Biosciences, Biolegend, and R&D Systems and used
for staining. Lineage antibody cocktail was purchased from
eBioscience. Anti-mouse CCR2 antibody was purchased from
R&D Systems, Inc. Stained cells and isotype-control–stained
cells were assayed using a LSRII, LSR4, or Fortessa flow cyto-
meter (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using
the FlowJo (FlowJo LLC, Tree Star) and/or ModFit LT 4.1
software.
Proteome profile
Tumor tissue was homogenized in PBS-containing protease
inhibitors. Following homogenization, Triton X-100 was added
to a final concentration of 1%, frozen at �80�C, thawed, cen-
trifuged as 10,000 g for 5 minutes, quantified, and assayed
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Blood samples were
collected from mice in each cohort, allowed to clot for 2 hours at
room temperature, and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 15 minutes.
Serum samples were frozen at �80�C until time of analysis at
which time they were run according to the manufacturer's pro-
tocol. All samples were processed and run on the R&D Systems
mouse XL cytokine array Kit (Ary028). Analyses were performed
using HLImageþþ QuickSpots Tool (Western Vision Software)
and GraphPad Prism7.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis
J774M cells were treated with entinostat at 0.5, 0.75, or
1 mmol/L for 6 hours and harvested in nondenaturing lysis
buffer. Cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation per the
manufacturer's protocol (Abcam 206996). STAT3 antibody was
applied to 350 mg of lysate in microcentrifuge tubes and placed
on a rotary mixer overnight at 4�C. The next day, protein A/G
Sepharose beads were applied, and the mixture was placed on
the rotary mixer for 1 hour at 4�C. Following pull-down of
STAT3, samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis on 4% to
20% precast mini-protean polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins of interest
were detected using acetylated lysine (1:1,000; Cell Signaling
9441S) and STAT3 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling 12640S). After
incubation with conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad),
membranes were exposed to chemiluminescence according to
the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
exposed to film. Quantitative measurements were performed
using ImageJ and GraphPad (Prism 7) software.
Quantitative real-time PCR
mRNA was extracted from J774M cells that were treated �
entinostat using standard Trizol protocols or using the total
RNA extraction Kit (Omega Bio-tek). RNA concentration and
purity were determined through measurement of A260/280
ratios with a Synergy Hi Multi-Mode reader. cDNA was prepar-
ed using the iScript Kit (Bio-Rad) or the cDNA reverse tran-
scriptase Kit (Applied Biosystems), and qPCR was performed in
HDAC and PD-1 Inhibition

Results
Entinostat enhances the antitumor effect of PD-1 inhibition in
syngeneic mouse cancer models
We tested entinostat in combination with a mouse checkpoint
inhibitor anti–PD-1 antibody in RENCA and LLC syngeneic
mouse models of cancer. Both these models have been shown
to attract highly immunosuppressive MDSCs to the TME, which
play a key role in suppression of antitumor T-cell activity
(14, 15). Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice were inoculated orthotopically
with firefly luciferase-tagged RENCA cells or subcutaneously
with LLC tumor cells, respectively. RENCA tumor–bearing mice
were randomized based on bioluminescent readouts and sepa-
rated into four groups: control, entinostat (5 mg/kg), anti–PD-1
(10 mg/kg), or the combination of entinostat and anti–PD-1.
Treatment with entinostat alone resulted in significant inhibi-
tion of tumor growth across the studied models (RENCA: 52.6%
growth inhibition; entinostat vs. control: P ¼ 0.0015), whereas
anti–PD-1 alone only moderately reduced tumor growth
(35.05%
growth
inhibition;
anti–PD-1
vs.
control:
P
¼
0.0768; Fig. 1A–C). The combination of entinostat and anti–
PD-1 treatment was most effective in enhancing tumor growth
inhibition compared with the control and each of the single
treatment groups (83.3% reduction; combination vs. vehicle: P <
0.0001; combination vs. entinostat: P ¼ 0.0115; combination
vs. anti–PD-1: P ¼ 0.0076; Fig. 1A–C).
Clinically, anti–PD-1 immunotherapy has shown prolonged
stabilization of disease in approximately 40% of patients with
RCC and lung cancer (1, 2, 16), leading to improvements in
overall survival in these indications. Following the previous study
in the RENCA model demonstrating tumor growth inhibition, we
examined the survival outcome for the entinostat and anti–PD-1
antibody combination. Using the doses previously described, we
observed a significant increase in survival for the combination
treatment (combination vs. anti–PD-1: P ¼ 0.0012; combination
vs. control: P ¼ 0.0009; Fig. 1E). Our results showed prolonged
survival in the anti–PD-1 group and an enhanced effect in the
combination-treated cohort also with increased dose of the PD-1
inhibitor (combination vs. control: P ¼ 0.0471; combination vs.
entinostat: P ¼ 0.0372; Fig. 1F). To expand these observations to a
different mouse model, we used LLC tumor–bearing mice. Mice
were randomized at the time of appearance of palpable s.c.
tumors. At the selected dose (10 mg/kg), entinostat as a single
agent caused a modest but significant decrease in tumor growth.
Similar decreases were observed in mice treated with PD-1 anti-
body alone. However, the combination of entinostat and anti–
PD-1 resulted in significant reductions in tumor growth (Fig. 1D).
The results of these studies demonstrate that the combination of
entinostat with anti–PD-1 inhibits tumor growth in different
tumor models.
Enhanced anti–PD-1 immunotherapy is associated with
increased antitumor immune responses and decreased
presence of immunosuppressive cell populations
To determine whether the inhibition of tumor growth result-
ing from the entinostat/anti–PD-1 combination treatment was
associated with an enhanced immune response, we examined
the circulating and tumor-infiltrating lymphoid and myeloid
populations. Endpoint blood and tumor samples were collect-
ed from RENCA tumor–bearing mice and subjected to immu-
nofluorescence staining and FACS analysis. We observed an

 while also showing a significant reduction in FoxP3 protein
levels as compared with the control group, did not show
reduced FoxP3 levels relative to entinostat alone (Fig. 2A and
B). In the TME, entinostat did not affect expression of FoxP3. A
very modest, albeit significant, reduction in the MFI of
CD4þFoxP3þ cells was observed in the combination treatment
group (Fig. 2B), suggesting that an inhibition of Treg function
associated with decreased expression of FoxP3 protein (17, 18)
could be the result of decreased tumor burden observed in this
group rather than a direct effect of entinostat.
CD8þ T cells are affected by the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and are
crucial to tumor surveillance. When the PD-1/PD-L1 check-
point axis is blocked, there is often an increase in effector T-cell
function and tumor infiltration (19, 20). We found that the
combination effect of entinostat and anti–PD-1 immunother-
apy resulted in a significant increase in tumor-infiltrating CD8þ
T cells (control vs. combination: P ¼ 0.0352; Fig. 2C, left;
Supplementary Fig. S1). Similarly, we observed a statistically
significant increase in the CD8þ T-cell–Treg ratio, suggesting
the generation of a less immunosuppressive environment (con-
trol vs. combination: P ¼ 0.0218; Fig. 2C, right).
In addition to FoxP3þ Tregs, there are multiple immunosup-
pressive myeloid cells recruited to the TME including tumor-
associated macrophages (TAM) and MDSCs. Upon migration of
immature monocytic cells to the tumor, these cells differentiate to
TAMs. These cells are marked by the pan-macrophage marker F4/
80 in combination with CD45þCD11bþ markers. Entinostat
alone compared to control caused a modest and not statistically
significant reduction in TAMs (Fig. 2D). A significant reduction in
TAMs was observed only in the combination group as compared
with control and entinostat alone (combination vs. control: P ¼
0.0272; combination vs. entinostat: P ¼ 0.009) in the RENCA
model, suggesting that these changes may be a consequence of
decreased tumor burden observed in this group. Taken together,
these results suggest that potentiating effect of entinostat on PD-1
immune therapy was not mediated by changes in Tregs or macro-
phages in TME.
MDSC function is neutralized by entinostat treatment
MDSCs contribute to the immune-suppressive TME by inhi-
biting antitumor T-cell immune responses. MDSCs are present
in two phenotypically defined subpopulations: granulocy-
tic
CD11bþLy6GþLy6Clow
(PMN-MDSCs)
and
monocytic
CD11bþLy6ChighLy6G� (M-MDSCs) MDSCs (21). Recent data
suggest that phenotype is an important descriptor of MDSCs,
but not a sufficient criterion for defining and identifying
MDSCs, which requires additional functional characterization
of the cells (22). The tumor attracts MDSCs, monocytes, and
immature myeloid cells via release of chemoattractants, such as
CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, and CXCL12 (8, 22–25). Once in the TME,
MDSCs have been shown to promote resistance to CD8þ
Teff cells and enhance the immune escape of the tumor via
multiple mechanisms including upregulation of surface PD-L1,
production of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL10, TGFb)
and Treg-attracting cytokines (CCL4, CCL5), and elevation of
arginase-1 (Arg1) and iNOS (23, 24, 26).
Treatment with entinostat alone caused an increase in pheno-
typically defined PMN-MDSC and M-MDSC within tumors,
whereas anti–PD-1 single-agent treatment led to a reduction
in the PMN-MDSC populations (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary
Figs. S1 and S2A). The slight increase in MDSC popula-
tions observed in the entinostat group was amplified in the
combination group (Fig. 3B). We also observed a significant
increase in accumulation of splenic PMN-MDSC (P ¼ 0.0053)
and M-MDSCs (P ¼ 0.0063) in the entinostat-treated LLC
model (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and PMN-MDSCs (P ¼
0.0441) in the combination-treated RENCA model (Supple-
mentary Fig. S2C). In addition, we observed increases in the
bone marrow MDSCs in LLC tumor–bearing mice (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S3A). Similar effects of entinostat on upregulation of
the population of PMN-MDSC in bone marrow, spleen, and
tumors were observed in another tumor model—CT26 colon
carcinoma (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
As an increase in immunosuppressive MDSCs was not con-
sistent with the antitumor activity that was observed with either
entinostat alone or in combination with anti–PD-1, the func-
tional activity of accumulating MDSCs was examined. We
tested ex vivo the ability of tumor-associated MDSCs to suppress
proliferation of antigen-specific and nonspecific (CD3/CD28-
stimulated) CD8þ T cells from tumor-free mice. PMN-MDSC
and M-MDSC from tumors of untreated mice showed potent
suppressive activity (Fig. 3C–E). In sharp contrast, MDSCs
isolated from tumors of entinostat-treated or entinostat/anti–
PD-1-treated mice had poor suppressive activity as demonstrat-
ed by an inability to inhibit proliferation of stimulated CD8þ T
cells (Fig. 3C–E). Importantly, this effect was equally observed
in entinostat alone and combination groups. MDSCs from the
spleen of LLC tumor–bearing mice also showed a reduced
capacity for inhibition of T-cell proliferation in the entino-
stat-treated cohort (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Further exami-
nation of the CD8þ T cells from these coculture experiments
revealed increased Granzyme B production by approximately
40% compared with the control group, in which MDSCs from
an untreated tumor-bearing mouse were cocultured with pres-
timulated CD8þ T cells (P value � 0.01 for each condition and
MDSC:T-cell ratio; Fig. 3F; Supplementary Fig. S4B). These data
indicate that although entinostat alone, and when combined
with anti–PD-1, increased intratumor numbers of cells with
PMN-MDSC and M-MDSC phenotype, these cells have lost the
majority of their immunosuppressive activity.
Entinostat treatment of MDSC-like cell line J774M and LLC
isolated MDSCs reveals potential mechanistic targets
The J774M cell line has recently been characterized as a
stable MDSC-like cell line (27, 28). To validate these findings
for the purposes of our experiments, we stained these cells for
Ly6C and Ly6G to confirm the MDSC-like status of the cells.
As shown in Fig. 4A, the subpopulation ratio of these cells
closely resembles what is found in the RENCA TME. Of the
CD45þCD11bþGr1þ
populations,
approximately
90%
of
the cells are PMN-MDSC (Ly6Gþ) and approximately 10% of
the cells are M-MDSC (Ly6Cþ; ref. 29). Following validation
of the cell phenotype, we studied the effect of entinostat on the
functional alteration of the immunosuppressive capacity of
these cells. We treated the cells for up to 48 hours with con-
centrations ranging from 0.01 to 5 mmol/L of entinostat with
no significant impact on J774M cell proliferation or viability
(Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Coculture of 0.5 mmol/L
entinostat-treated J774M cells with preactivated CD8þ T cells
for 68–72 hours revealed a significant increase in CD8þ T-cell
proliferation nearing that of CD8þ T cells alone, with minimal
additional

 Supplementary Fig. S5C). Our previous work with entinostat
treatment of FoxP3þ Tregs demonstrated that inhibition of
class 1 HDACs led to acetylation of STAT3 and subsequent
inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. To deter-
mine if entinostat utilized a similar mechanism of STAT3
inhibition in MDSCs, J774M cells were treated for 6 hours
with 0.5, 0.75, or 1 mmol/L of entinostat. Via immunoprecip-
itation of STAT3 and Western blot probing for acetylated lysine,
we noted that 0.5 mmol/L of entinostat treatment induced
STAT3 acetylation without altering the total presence of STAT3
protein (Fig. 5C).
MDSCs have been shown to express high levels of arg1, COX-2,
and iNOS, which are key mediators of the immunosuppressive
activity of MDSCs. Further investigation of the J774M and LLC
cells revealed a striking inhibition of arg1 expression in the
entinostat-treated cells as compared with the untreated cells

 (RENCA—control vs. entinostat-treated: P ¼ 0.003; LLC—control
vs. entinostat-treated: P ¼ 0.163; Fig. 4D and E). Arg1 allows
for induction of cell-cycle arrest in the cytotoxic T-cell population
via arg1 conversion of circulating L-arginine pools to urea and
L-ornithine, thus reducing the presence of extracellular L-arginine,
which is necessary for cytotoxic T-cell survival (10, 25). Consistent
with the effects of entinostat on arg1 expression, further charac-
terization of entinostat-treated J774 and LLC MDSCs revealed
reduced expression of NO (RENCA—P ¼ 0.083; LLC—P ¼ 0.121)
and cox2 genes (LLC—P ¼ 0.041; Fig. 4D and E). Entinostat
did not affect the level of ROS in MDSCs (Fig. 4F). These data
indicate that entinostat may directly target STAT3 signaling to
impair the T-cell–inhibiting activity of MDSCs, through down-
regulation of arg1, iNOS, or Cox-2.
Effect of entinostat on differentiation and function of MDSC
in vitro
Previous data have demonstrated that class 1 HDACs may
play a role in the differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells to
MDSCs, DCs, and macrophage. To evaluate the effect of entino-
stat on MDSC differentiation, enriched bone marrow hemato-
poietic progenitor cells (HPC) from tumor-free mice were
cultured with GM-CSF and TES for 6 days in the presence of
different concentrations of entinostat. In the absence of TES,
entinostat caused a significant decrease in the differentiation of
CD11cþMHCIIþ DCs, without affecting F4/80þ macrophages
and Ly6Chi monocytes. In contrast, the presence of Ly6Gþ
granulocytes was significantly increased (Fig. 5A). Entinostat-
inducible upregulation of granulocytic, Ly6Gþ, differentiation
was observed during HPC differentiation in the presence of TES.
No effect on macrophages, F4/80þ, DCs, and CD11cþMHCIIþ
was seen. However, the presence of monocytes, Ly6Cþ, was
significantly decreased (Fig. 5B). Thus, consistent with in vivo
data, entinostat promoted differentiation of granulocytic cells.
To assess the effect of entinostat on MDSC-suppressive activity,
Ly6Gþ cells were isolated after a 6-day HPC culture with
different concentrations of entinostat, GM-CSF, and TES, and
used in an antigen-specific suppressive assay. PMN-MDSC
derived in this manner had potent suppressive activity, which
was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by entinostat
(Fig. 5C). Similar to the results obtained in vivo, entinostat
significantly reduced expression of genes involved in immune
suppression in PMN-MDSC: nos2, arg1, and cox-2 (Fig. 5D).
Downregulation of the expression of nos2 was associated with
decreased production of NO in entinostat-treated cells (Fig. 5E).
Reduced expression of arg1, was associated with decreased
arginase activity (Fig. 5F). MDSC-derived prostaglandin E2
(PEG2) was significantly reduced with entinostat treatment
(Fig. 5G). Thus, the effect of entinostat on PMN-MDSC gener-
ated from HPCs fully recapitulated the effect seen in vivo.
Entinostat treatment primes the TME for enhanced response
to immunotherapy
To examine the effect of entinostat on the TME, we subjected
tumor samples from control, entinostat, and combination-
treated cohorts to a proteome profiler analysis (Ary028) that
provided a readout of 111 chemokines and cytokines (Supple-
mentary Fig. S6). Within this pool, we observed a significant
decrease in MDSC activation cytokines, including G-CSF (P �
0.001/0.01), GM-CSF (P � 0.05/0.001), IL1b (P � 0.001/0.01),
and IL10 (P � 0.001) in the TME of both the entinostat and
combination cohorts relative to the control (Fig. 6A and B).
In addition, we observed a significant increase in MDSC-
associated trafficking/accumulation cytokines, including IL6
(P � 0.05) and VEGF (P � 0.01), in combination cohort rela-
tive to the control (Fig. 6C and D). We also noted a significant
upregulation of antitumor chemokines and cytokines, which
contribute to pro-MDSC inhibition (IL1ra: P � 0.01/0.0001;
ref. 30) and innate antitumor response (IL4: P � 0.001/0.01
and IL12p40: P � 0.01/0.05; Fig. 6C and D). These results
suggest that entinostat treatment is sufficient to alter the
immune profile of the TME toward an antitumor status that
may prime the TME to better respond to immunotherapeutic
interventions, such as anti–PD-1 treatment. For these data on
entinostat treatment priming the host immune system, we
subjected serum samples from the control- and entinostat-
treated mice to the same Ary028 proteome profiler. We ob-
served significant decreases in multiple, circulating pro–tumor-
associated chemokines and cytokines between the control- and
entinostat-treated cohorts (Supplementary Fig. S7; Fig. 6E).

Although we did not observe upregulation of antitumor
cytokines/chemokines in the entinostat-treated group, there
was a significant upregulation of multiple cytokines/chemokines
in the combination cohort, suggesting that anti–PD-1 immu-
notherapy and entinostat work together to enhance the host
immune system for improved immunotherapeutic responses
(Fig. 6F). We observed increases in the following antitumor-
related cytokines/chemokines: T-cell attractants and antien-

Discussion
The recent advancement in the therapeutic approach for
patients with solid tumors, including RCC and NSCLC, has been
remarkable and driven forward in particular with the emergence
of effective and generally well-tolerated immunotherapies show-
ing durable clinical benefit. We are still striving to have these
advantageous therapies become effective for a larger population
of patients as only 20% to 30% of patients with RCC and NSCLC
will have a durable response (1, 2). Our study offers evidence
supporting further development of the HDACi entinostat as an
effective treatment to combine with immunotherapies.
In this study, wetested the effect of combining a class I–selective
HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, with anti–PD-1 immunotherapy in
two syngeneic mouse models of RCC and NSCLC along with a
series of in vitro experiments aimed at characterizing the basis for
the enhanced antitumor activity observed for this combination. In
addition to delayed tumor growth, we observed that entinostat
and anti–PD-1 immunotherapy prolonged survival in our RCC
model. Entinostat alone did not affect the presence of Treg or
macrophages in TME. However, it caused upregulation of CD8þ T
cells (although it did not reach statistical significance). Although
combination treatment reduced tumor-associated FoxP3þ and
significantly reduced the presenceof FoxP3 protein in the cells, it is
difficult to exclude that this was the result of significantly reduced
tumor burden in these mice. However, these findings support the
hypothesis that entinostat in combination with immunotherapy
treatment, rather than being directly cytotoxic to the tumor, has
significant immunomodulatory activity (5, 31).
Recent reports suggest that HDAC inhibition alters the cyto-
kine release and may change the function of innate immune
cell infiltrates in the TME (6, 8, 12, 32). Interestingly, correlative
studies performed in breast cancer patients receiving entinostat
showed a decrease in both monocytic and granulocytic MDSCs
(32). In our experimental conditions, we actually observed an
increase in both monocytic and granulocytic subsets of the
MDSC population. MDSC are well-known inhibitors of T-cell
proliferation and activity. Recent reports suggest that HDACs
may play a role in this suppressive function (6, 10, 12, 19, 21,
23, 25). Thus, our study shows that entinostat treatment has an
inhibitory effect on PMN- and M-MDSC suppressive function
both in vivo and in vitro—either with cells directly from the TME
or using an MDSC-like cell line. Additional analysis of MDSCs
treated with entinostat revealed a significant inhibition of
arg1 activity and NO production as well as cox2 expression
suggesting potential mechanisms of action by which entinostat
inhibits the function of the immunosuppressive MDSC popu-
lations. It is also intriguing that we observed a reduction of
tumor-infiltrating macrophages in the entinostat-treated tumor
suggesting a potential role of HDAC inhibition also on the
innate immune response.
Entinostat treatment has been associated with altered inflam-
matory responses via cytokine/chemokine release and trafficking
(33–35). Such circulating proteins affect the function and
response of the immune system to disease. The release of chemo-
attractants from the TME is necessary for immune infiltration
Figure 6.
Treatment with entinostat significantly alters the highly immunosuppressive environment found in RENCA tumors. Tumor and blood samples collected from
mice at the end of the study were processed and examined using the Proteome Profiler Mouse XL Cytokine array Kit (Ary028). A, Quantification of

 and immune surveillance evasion (7, 10, 23, 36). Through this
complex interplay of communication signals, tumor cells and
their associated immune infiltrates avoid notice of the immune
system (Supplementary Fig. S8). Our study shows significant
alterations in the communication between the tumor and host
environments. Downregulation of immune infiltrate tracking,
expansion, activation, and suppression proteins by entinostat
suggest that class I HDAC inhibition plays a central role in this
effect. Similarly, the upregulation of multiple antitumor proteins
in the serum indicates that entinostat may prime the host envi-
ronment to better respond to immunotherapy.
The treatment of RCC is rapidly evolving with the introduc-
tion of immune checkpoint inhibitors. At the moment, the
only approved drug targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is nivolu-
mab in the second-line setting, but the results from two
randomized phase III clinical trials with novel combinations
of immune checkpoint inhibitors are awaited and will likely
change the standard of care for RCC in the first-line setting. Our
positive results with entinostat and high-dose interleukin 2
(HD-IL2) in patients with RCC are also encouraging and
confirm the clinical immunomodulation of this HDAC inhib-
itor (37). Thus, it is intriguing to speculate that the differential
effect of HDAC inhibition on the immune system may be
pleiotropic but perhaps also guided by the type of immuno-
therapy that it is combined with. For example, it is possible that
the effect on Treg and MDSC may be different and have a
different contribution depending whether we combine entino-
stat with either HD-IL2 or a PD-1 inhibitor. Furthermore, the
different TME across different tumor types (either within RCC
or other solid tumors) may differentially sensitize to this
therapeutic approach. This hypothesis is clinically relevant as
immune checkpoint inhibitors are becoming the standard of
care for several solid tumors, and combinations with HDAC
inhibitors are being developed and tested in clinical trials,
including combinations of entinostat and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibi-
tors in melanoma, breast, lung, and ovarian cancer patients.
In summary, our study suggests a novel mechanism by which
HDAC inhibitor entinostat modulates the immune-suppressive
TME resulting in an enhanced antitumor effect. Entinostat
has potent immunomodulatory activity through inhibition of
MDSC function that enhances anti–PD-1-induced antitumor
response. These results have direct clinical implications in
designing rational combination treatments for clinical trials.
A phase I/II clinical trial of combinational HDAC inhibitor and
anti–PD-1 has been initiated at our institute to determine the
efficacy, objective response rate, and progression-free survival
in RCC patients.
