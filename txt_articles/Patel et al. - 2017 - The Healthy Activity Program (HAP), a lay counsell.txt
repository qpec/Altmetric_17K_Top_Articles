Summary
Background Although structured psychological treatments are recommended as fi
 rst-line interventions for depression, 
only a small fraction of people globally receive these treatments because of poor access in routine primary care. We 
assessed the eff
 ectiveness and cost-eff
 ectiveness of a brief psychological treatment (Healthy Activity Program [HAP]) 
for delivery by lay counsellors to patients with moderately severe to severe depression in primary health-care settings.
Methods In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited participants aged 18–65 years scoring more than 14 on the 
Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) indicating moderately severe to severe depression from ten primary health 
centres in Goa, India. Pregnant women or patients who needed urgent medical attention or were unable to 
communicate clearly were not eligible. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to enhanced usual care (EUC) alone 
or EUC combined with HAP in randomly sized blocks (block size four to six [two to four for men]), stratifi
 ed by 
primary health centre and sex, and allocation was concealed with use of sequential numbered opaque envelopes. 
Physicians providing EUC were masked. Primary outcomes were depression symptom severity on the Beck 
Depression Inventory version II and remission from depression (PHQ-9 score of <10) at 3 months in the intention-
to-treat population, assessed by masked fi
 eld researchers. Secondary outcomes were disability, days unable to work, 
behavioural activation, suicidal thoughts or attempts, intimate partner violence, and resource use and costs of illness. 
We assessed serious adverse events in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 
number ISRCTN95149997.
Findings Between Oct 28, 2013, and July 29, 2015, we enrolled and randomly allocated 495 participants (247 [50%] to the 
EUC plus HAP group [two of whom were subsequently excluded because of protocol violations] and 248 [50%] to the 
EUC alone group), of whom 466 (95%) completed the 3 month primary outcome assessment (230 [49%] in the EUC 
plus HAP group and 236 [51%] in the EUC alone group). Participants in the EUC plus HAP group had signifi
 cantly 
lower symptom severity (Beck Depression Inventory version II in EUC plus HAP group 19·99 [SD 15·70] vs 27·52 
[13·26] in EUC alone group; adjusted mean diff
 erence –7·57 [95% CI –10·27 to –4·86]; p<0·0001) and higher remission 
(147 [64%] of 230 had a PHQ-9 score of <10 in the HAP plus EUC group vs 91 [39%] of 236 in the EUC alone group; 
adjusted prevalence ratio 1·61 [1·34–1·93]) than did those in the EUC alone group. EUC plus HAP showed better results 
than did EUC alone for the secondary outcomes of disability (adjusted mean diff
 erence –2·73 [–4·39 to –1·06]; p=0·001), 
days out of work (–2·29 [–3·84 to –0·73]; p=0·004), intimate partner physical violence in women (0·53 [0·29–0·96]; 
p=0·04), behavioural activation (2·17 [1·34–3·00]; p<0·0001), and suicidal thoughts or attempts (0·61 [0·45–0·83]; 
p=0·001). The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $9333 (95% CI 3862–28 169; 2015 international 
dollars), with an 87% chance of being cost-eff
 ective in the study setting. Serious adverse events were infrequent and 
similar between groups (nine [4%] in the EUC plus HAP group vs ten [4%] in the EUC alone group; p=1·00). 
Interpretation HAP delivered by lay counsellors plus EUC was better than EUC alone was for patients with moderately 
severe to severe depression in routine primary care in Goa, India. HAP was readily accepted by this previously 
untreated population and was cost-eff
 ective in this setting. HAP could be a key strategy to reduce the treatment gap 
for depressive disorders, the leading mental health disorder worldwide.

Introduction
Depression is the leading mental health cause of the 
global burden of disease,1 with a global prevalence 
of 4·7%.2 Depression substantially impairs quality of life, 
social functioning, and workforce participation among 
people with the disease, their family members, and their 
communities,3,4 with an annual global cost attributable to 
depression estimated at US$1·15 trillion.4 Certain 
psychological treatments can be as eff
 ective as anti-
depressant medications, with higher retention and better

enduring eff
 ects,5 and they are recommended as fi
 rst-line 
interventions by WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action 
Programme (mhGAP).6 However, most depressed people 
who live in low-income and middle-income countries do 
not have access to psychological treatments. Authors of 
reviews have shown that this treatment gap exceeds 90% 
in India and China7 and often exceeds 50%,8 even in 
highly resourced settings.
Most of the evidence supporting psychological treat-
ments comes from specialist settings in high-income 
countries and the generalisability of the fi
 ndings to 
low-income and middle-income countries can be 
questioned. Contextual factors, such as variations in 
explanatory models, ways of coping with distress, little 
access to specialist services, and socioeconomic barriers 
such as literacy should be considered.9,10 However, 
evidence is growing for the eff
 ectiveness of contextually 
sensitive psychological treatments that have been 
adapted to the local context and delivered by appropriately 
trained and supervised lay health workers in primary 
care and community settings.11 Identifi
 cation of eff
 ective 
psychological treatments that can be delivered in this 
way has been ranked among the leading research 
priorities for global mental health.12
The goal of the Program for Eff
 ective Mental Health 
Interventions in Under-Resourced Health Systems 
(PREMIUM) was to develop and assess scalable psychol-
ogical treatments that are culturally appropriate, 
aff
 ordable, and feasible for delivery by non-specialist 
health workers and apply these treatments to the two 
leading mental health disorders: moderately severe to 
severe depression (the Healthy Activity Program [HAP]) 
and harmful drinking (Counselling for Alcohol Problems 
[CAP]).13–15 In this Article, we describe the results of a trial 
assessing the eff
 ectiveness and cost-eff
 ectiveness of 
HAP,13 a brief psychological treatment adapted from 
behavioural activation, an empirically supported psychol-
ogical treatment recommended by WHO.16,17 A core 
feature of PREMIUM is delivery of both treatments by 
the same lay counsellors in routine primary care settings, 
thus reproducing the way that they would be used in 
clinical practice. The results of the trial assessing the 
CAP treatment for harmful drinking are published 
separately.18 The two trials of HAP and CAP were done 
concurrently in the same primary health centres (PHCs) 
and over the same period of time, with the same 
counsellors delivering both treatments according to trial 
allocations of participants.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited 
participants aged 18–65 years who had a probable 
diagnosis of moderately severe to severe depression 
ascertained with a Patient Health Questionnaire 9 
(PHQ-9) score of more than 14, a cutpoint previously 
validated in the study setting,19 in ten primary health 
centres in Goa, a state on the west coast of India. The 
publicly funded PHCs are the fi
 rst option for fi
 nancially 
disadvantaged people. Pregnant women and patients 
who needed urgent medical attention or were unable to 
communicate clearly were not eligible. These criteria 
were established and applied by trained health assistants 
at the PHC.
The trial protocol20 was approved by the Trial Steering 
Committee, and ethical approval for the conduct of the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Our review began with the evidence synthesised by WHO’s 
Mental Health Gap Action Programme guidelines for mental 
disorders in non-specialised health-care settings. We 
supplemented this evidence with searches of PubMed and 
PsycINFO from Jan 1, 2009, to Jan 1, 2011, with no language 
restrictions, as well as hand searching reference lists of selected 
papers, contacting key informants, and visiting key libraries in 
the region. Structured psychological treatments based on 
cognitive behavioural or interpersonal theories are 
recommended as fi
 rst-line interventions by WHO’s Mental 
Health Gap Action Programme for moderate to severe 
depression. Simpler versions of these treatments, such as 
behavioural activation, are as eff
 ective as are more elaborate 
versions, such as cognitive behaviour therapy. However, the 
existing evidence has limited generalisability to many 
low-income and middle-income countries where both supply 
side (low availability of mental health professionals) and 
demand side (low levels of mental health literacy) barriers lead 
to large treatment gaps.
Added value of this study
This study is the fi
 rst report of fi
 ndings from any low-income 
and middle-income country assessing the eff
 ectiveness and 
cost-eff
 ectiveness of a psychological treatment for 
moderately severe to severe depression in primary care. A brief 
(six to eight sessions) psychological treatment (the Healthy 
Activity Program), based on behavioural activation, delivered 
by lay counsellors, was better than was enhanced usual care 
according to all prespecifi
 ed primary clinical and secondary 
social and functional outcomes. HAP was readily accepted by 
this previously untreated population and was cost-eff
 ective in 
this setting.
Implications of all the available evidence
Brief psychological treatments, based on behavioural activation, 
are acceptable, feasible, and cost-eff
 ective for management of 
moderate to severe depression, even when delivered by non-
specialist health workers in routine health-care settings in 
previously untreated populations. Such treatments should be 
scaled up as a key strategy to address depressive disorders, the 
leading mental health disorder worldwide.

trial was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards 
of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, 
Sangath (the implementing institution in India), and the 
Indian Council of Medical Research. Written (or 
witnessed, if the participant was illiterate) informed 
consent was mandatory for enrolment. We audiotaped all 
consent procedures, with patients’ approvals.
Randomisation and masking
We randomly allocated participants (1:1) to HAP plus 
enhanced usual care (EUC) or EUC alone. An 
independent statistician generated a randomisation list 
in randomly sized blocks (block size four to six [two to 
four for men because we anticipated relatively fewer men 
on the basis of the epidemiology of the prevalence of 
depression and did not want imbalance between groups]), 
stratifi
 ed by PHC and sex. Assignments were sealed in 
sequential numbered opaque envelopes by independent 
support staff
  that were opened as each consenting 
eligible patient was enrolled21 by trained health assistants. 
Physicians providing EUC were masked to allocation 
status, as were the independent assessors who did 
outcome assessments, and these people had no contact 
with the PHCs or other team members. All authors, 
apart from the data manager (BB), were masked until the 
trial results were unmasked in the presence of the Trial 
Steering Committee and Data Safety and Monitoring 
Committee on March 7, 2016. Instances of unmasking of 
outcome assessors in the HAP group will be summarised 
on the basis of overall prevalence and the exact point 
during the interview that the interviewer was unmasked. 
Procedures
We interviewed patients who gave informed consent to 
collect data for sociodemographic factors and potential 
moderators of treatment eff
 ect: sex, duration of illness, 
and expectations for treatment.22 We reduced the number 
of potential moderators (following approval from the 
Trial Steering Committee and data and safety monitoring 
board) listed in the trial protocol to align our analyses 
with what is commonly reported in the literature 
regarding moderators in depression treatment trials.22,23 
We recorded all intake interviews and randomly selected 
(using a random selection strategy statifi
 ed by health 
assistant) a subset for review by a supervisor for quality 
assurance.
In the enhanced usual care group, usual care and 
treatment provided by the PHC physician was enhanced 
by provision of screening results to both patient and 
physician and use of a contextualised version of the 
mhGAP guidelines (a manual containing the specifi
 c 
mhGAP guidelines for primary care physicians treating 
depression),16 including when and where to refer for 
psychiatric care. In the HAP group, participants received 
EUC plus HAP,13 a manualised psychological treatment 
based on behavioural activation that includes the following 
strategies: psychoeducation, behavioural assessment, 
activity monitoring, activity structuring and scheduling, 
activation of social networks, and problem solving. 
Additional strategies used in response to specifi
 c needs 
consisted 
of 
behavioural 
strategies 
to 
improve 
interpersonal 
communication 
skills 
and 
decrease 
rumination, advice regarding sleep problems and tobacco 
cessation, and relaxation training.
On the basis of extensive formative and pilot 
research,13,24 we made various adaptations to enhance the 
contextual acceptability and feasibility of the treatment, 
such as inclusion of home-based delivery, use of pictorial 
patient resource materials, strategies to encourage 
involvement of a signifi
 cant other in treatment, and 
sharing of supervision of lay counsellors with peer 
groups. Additionally, we condensed delivery of the core 
intervention strategies from the normal 20–24-session 
format25 into a six-session to eight-session protocol. We 
delivered HAP in an individual format, each lasting 
30–40 min, with initial sessions at weekly intervals. We 
typically conducted sessions face-to-face, at the PHC or 
patient’s home, but used telephone sessions when 
necessary. The beginning phase focused on orientation 
to treatment, a multisession middle phase focused on 
teaching of core intervention strategies, and a late phase 
focused on review of gains and termination. The middle 
phase could be extended by up to two additional sessions 
for patients who did not show suffi
  cient improvement 
(consistently high PHQ-9 scores and absence of 
activation), allowing a maximum of eight sessions. 
Patients who did not respond could be referred for 
specialist care. We considered patients who met treat-
ment goals or completed the maximum number of 
sessions or were referred to specialists to have a planned 
discharge; we considered all other patients to have an 
unplanned discharge. 
A detailed description of counsellor selection and 
training is provided elsewhere.19,26 An international expert 
in behavioural activation (SD) trained and provided 
ongoing supervision for fi
 ve local specialists, who in turn 
provided onsite training and supervision for lay 
counsellors. Training of lay counsellors involved a 3 week 
participatory workshop covering both HAP and CAP 
treatments, followed by an internship phase of 6 months, 
in which trainee counsellors delivered the treatment to 
eligible patients in primary health-care clinics, combined 
with peer-led group supervision as the trainees gained 
experience in delivery of the treatment.26 11 counsellors 
who met competency standards as assessed by standard-
ised roleplays and therapy quality measures participated 
in the trial. They received weekly peer-led supervision in 
groups of four to six that involved rating of a randomly 
selected (using a random selection strategy stratifi
 ed by 
counsellor and phase of session) 10% of recorded 
sessions on the HAP Therapy Quality Scale (TQS)26 and 
individual supervision twice monthly. HAP delivery costs 
included patient contact and counsellor training, 
supervision, and salary.

trial but had previously led development of HAP.13
Outcomes
The two primary outcomes were depression severity 
assessed by the modifi
 ed (dropping the item related to 
sex for cultural reasons) Beck Depression Inventory 
version II (BDI-II) and remission from depression as 
defi
 ned by a PHQ-9 score of less than 10, both assessed 
3 months after enrolment. Secondary outcomes were 
disability on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 
II and total days unable to work in the previous month, 
behavioural activation on the fi
 ve-item abbreviated 
Activation Scale based on the Behavioural Activation for 
Depression Scale-Short Form, suicidal thoughts or 
attempts in the past 3 months, intimate partner violence 
(not a prespecifi
 ed hypothesis), and resource use and 
costs of illness estimated from the Client Service 
Receipt Inventory.27 We assessed behavioural activation 
concurrently with the primary outcome, precluding 
drawing of any causal inference. Concurrent assessment 
of mediator and outcome provides only a very weak test 
of mediation and we are hesitant to report fi
 ndings in 
that regard since we consider them potentially 
misleading. Instead, we have reframed behavioural 
activation as a putative target of the treatment rather than 
an outcome in its own right. We will be examining the 
potential mediating role of behavioural activation on the 
eff
 ect of intervention at 12 months separately. All 
adaptations to outcomes, including the decision to drop 
the item enquiring about sexual drive (because of cultural 
sensitivity considerations), were fi
 nalised and approved 
by the Trial Steering Committee and the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee before the start of the trial. We 
collected data for serious adverse events, defi
 ned as 
deaths, suicide attempts, and unplanned admissions to 
hospital from any cause.
Statistical analysis
Assuming an intracluster correlation between clinics of 
0·04, with one counsellor per PHC at any one time, a 
loss to follow-up of 15% over 3 months, and a 1:1 allocation 
ratio, we aimed to recruit 500 participants to detect the 
hypothesised eff
 ects (a standardised mean diff
 erence 
of 0·42), with 90% power for the primary continuous 
outcome of depression severity and 92% power to detect 
a recovery of 65% in the HAP group for our primary 
binary outcome of depression remission. We took into 
account the design eff
 ect of 1·28 in the sample size 
estimation.
Analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis with use of 
multiple imputation for those with missing outcome 
data. We assessed serious adverse events in the per-
protocol population. All models adjusted for PHC as a 
fi
 xed eff
 ect to allow for within-PHC clustering and 
adjusted for baseline PHQ-9 scores. For continuous 
outcomes, we estimated intervention eff
 ects using linear 
regression and reported them as adjusted mean 
diff
 erences (AMDs) and eff
 ect sizes, with 95% CIs. For 
binary outcomes, we reported intervention eff
 ects as 
adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) estimated from logistic 
regression using the marginal standardisation technique 
for prevalence ratios and the δ method for the 95% CIs.28 
Although our original plan was to have one counsellor 
per PHC, in practice, 11 counsellors delivered the 
intervention over the ten PHCs. Of these, six worked in 
one PHC only, and the remaining fi

PHCs where caseloads were higher. Thus, we carried out 
a sensitivity analysis as a multilevel model with both 
PHC and counsellor included as random eff
 ects. 
Sensitivity analyses also included complete case analyses. 
We did Complier’s Average Causal Eff
 ect analyses to 
estimate the eff
 ect of completed treatment as originally 
intended on participants.29
Results are described in terms of strength of evidence 
rather than statistical signifi
 cance30 and, hence, we did 
not adjust p values for multiple comparisons. We did 
economic assessments from health-care system and 
societal perspectives. We derived quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) scores using an approach previously 
used in India.31 We bootstrapped incremental cost-
eff
 ectiveness ratios to derive 95% CIs. We explored 
statistical uncertainty around the incremental cost-
eff
 ectiveness ratios through cost-eff
 ectiveness accept-
ability curves showing the likelihood that HAP would be 
cost-eff
 ective at diff
 erent levels of willingness to pay. We 
did post-hoc analyses of remission as defi
 ned by a PHQ-9 
score of less than 5 or a 50% reduction in score as a 
stringent indicator of remission. We did all statistical 
analyses using Excel 2016, SPSS 21, and Stata 14. All 
costs are presented in 2015 international dollars. A Data 
and Safety Monitoring Committee oversaw the trial. This 
trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number 
ISRCTN95149997

Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, or writing of the report. VP, 
HAW, BW, BB, DM, and A-LP had full access to all the 
data in the study. VP and BW had fi

the decision to submit for publication. 
Results
Between Oct 28, 2013, and July 29, 2015, 34 306 (23%) of 
the 146 661 PHC attendees assessed met eligibility 
criteria (fi
 gure 1). 31 888 (93%) of these patients were 
screened for depression using PHQ-9 (18 740 [59%] 
women and 13 148 [41%] men) and 785 (2%) met criteria 
for inclusion in the trial (615 [78%] women and 
170 [22%] men), of whom 495 (63%) consented to 
participate and were enrolled (379 [77%] women and 
116 [23%] men). 248 patients were randomly allocated 
to EUC and 247 were randomly allocated to EUC plus 
HAP, two of whom were subsequently excluded from 
the EUC plus HAP group (one withdrew consent and 
the other was erroneously enrolled in both CAP and 
HAP trials), leaving a total of 245 patients given EUC 
plus HAP. 
2480 (8%) of 31 888 patients screened had moderate to 
severe depression, as defi
 ned by a PHQ-9 score of more 
than 10, which is within the range of prevalence of 
depression reported in the WHO multinational study of 
common mental disorders in general health care.32 
Baseline characteristics were similar by group (table 1). 
The modal patient was a married woman in her early 
forties with moderately severe depression, with a primary 
school education, and not employed outside the home. 
Participants had similar baseline characteristics to those 
who declined (appendix), and the most common reason 
for refusal to participate in the trial was time constraints 
(118 [41%]). 466 (94%) participants were seen at the 
3 month endpoint (236 [51%] in the EUC group and 
230 [49%] in the EUC plus HAP group), with a mean 
interval of 14·8 weeks (95% CI 14·6–15·2). Those lost to 
follow-up tended to be younger and more likely to be 
single than were those not lost to follow-up (appendix). 
The trial was completed on Aug 30, 2016, when the 
12 month outcome assessment ended. 
We noted strong evidence of an intervention eff
 ect on 
depression symptom severity. Mean BDI-II score was

the EUC plus HAP group (AMD –7·57 [95% CI 
–10·27 to –4·86]; p<0·0001; table 2), with an eff
 ect size of 
0·48 (95% CI 0·30–0·66). We noted some evidence of a 
treatment interaction with severity, with a larger eff
 ect of 
EUC plus HAP than for EUC alone among patients with 
more severe depression at baseline (PHQ-9 score of 20 or 
more) than among those who were less severe (p value 
for interaction 0·05); diff
 erences were signifi
 cant within 
each subset (high severity: mean BDI-II score in EUC 
group 32·71 [SD 12·75] vs 20·16 [15·45] in EUC plus 
HAP group, AMD –12·15 [95% CI –17·53 to –6·77], 
p<0·0001; moderate severity: 25·80 [13·19] vs 20·16 
[15·82], AMD –5·99 [–9·14 to –2·85]; p<0·0001; fi
 gure 2). 
We obtained similar results fi
 tting HAP counsellor as a 
random eff
 ect and using complete case analyses 
(appendix). We noted no evidence of moderation by sex, 
chronicity, or expectation (appendix).
HAP also had a strong intervention eff
 ect on depression 
remission (PHQ-9 score of <10), with 147 (64%) of 
230 participants meeting criteria in the EUC plus HAP 
group compared with 91 (39%) of 236 in the EUC alone 
group (aPR 1·61 [95% CI 1·34–1·93]; adjusted risk 
diff
 erence 24·0% [15·4–32·6]; p<0·0001). This fi
 nding 
yields a number needed to treat of 4·15 (3·07–6·45). The 
Complier’s Average Causal Eff
 ect analysis for the eff
 ect 
of having a planned discharge found a prevalence ratio of 
2·16 (1·68–2·78) associated with remission among 
patients who completed HAP. HAP remained better 
when 
remission 
was 
defi
 ned 
more 
stringently 
(PHQ score of <5: aPR 2·34 [1·75–3·14]) or as an at 
least 50% reduction in PHQ score (aPR 1·82 [1·51–2·19]).
The eff
 ect of EUC plus HAP was better than that of 
EUC for all secondary outcomes (WHO Disability 
Assessment Schedule II eff
 ect size 0·13; days unable to 
work eff
 ect size 0·20) and the putative target of 
behavioural activation (Behavioural Activation for 
Depression Scale eff
 ect size –0·39), except for intimate 
partner psychological violence among women or any 
form of violence among men (table 2). Serious adverse 
events and prescription of antidepressant medications 
were infrequent and did not diff
 er between treatments 
(any serious adverse event nine [4%] in the HAP plus 
EUC group vs ten [4%] in the EUC alone group, p=1·00; 
deaths two [1%] vs none, p=0·24; suicide attempts four 
[2%] vs three [1%], p=0·72; unplanned admissions to 
hospital three [1%] vs seven [3%], p=0·34); appendix).
The intraclass correlation of BDI-II within PHCs 
was 0·005. The internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) 
observed in this study was 0·86 for PHQ-9 and 0·91 for 
BDI-II. Of the 245 participants in the HAP group, 
169 (69%) had a planned discharge, of whom seven (4%) 
were referred for specialist care. Their median number 
of sessions was six (IQR fi
 ve to seven). 61 (25%) received 
more than the optimal dose of six sessions. Patients with 
an unplanned discharge were likely to stop attending 
early (median one session [IQR none to two]). Of the 
total 1181 sessions delivered, 1133 (96%) were face-to-face. 
Although 173 (77%) of the 226 fi
 rst sessions (typically on 
the day when patients were enrolled) took place in the 
PHC, 522 (91%) of the 575 subsequent sessions were 
delivered at home. 51 (21%) of participants had a 
signifi
 cant other involved in at least one session. The 
mean session duration was 40·2 min (95% CI 39·1–41·4). 
Mean TQS score was 2·58 (2·53–2·64) on the basis of 
peer supervisor ratings (n=186), similar to expert 
supervisor ratings (n=186; mean 2·55 [2·47–2·62]) and 
the mean score of the independent rater (n=100; mean 
2·76 [2·69–2·82]), indicating good to average therapy 
quality. The most frequently endorsed HAP elements by 
the counsellor at the end of treatment were activation 
(178 [73%]), followed by problem solving (62 [25%]). 31 
(13%) of 245 investigators were unmasked, with 16 (7%) 
unmasked before the primary outcome assessment.
From the health system perspective, the total health-
care cost per person, including the intervention cost, was 
signifi
 cantly higher in the EUC plus HAP group than in 
the EUC alone group, with signifi
 cantly better QALY 
scores (table 3). Excluding the cost of intervention, the 
use and thus cost of other health-care service costs was 
not diff
 erent between groups. Health system planners

budgetary costs of investment in HAP are worth the 
health improvements gained. One aid to decision making 
is assessment of cost-eff
 ectiveness; an incremental cost 
per QALY gained of less than gross domestic product per 
capita has been considered to be highly cost-eff
 ective.33 
HAP has a favourable cost per QALY gained (table 4) as 
GDP per capita in the state of Goa in 2015 was $16 060.34 
Figure 3 provides a cost-eff
 ectiveness acceptability 
curve, indicating that HAP has an 87% chance of being 
considered cost-eff
 ective from a health system perspective 
in the state of Goa. No consensus exists on the 
cost-eff
 ectiveness thresholds per additional remission at 
3 months on the PHQ-9 scale, but as table 4 shows, the 
incremental costs are modest; if society is willing to pay 
up to the equivalent of 1 month’s wages in Goa for an 
unskilled manual worker per remission ($415),35 HAP 
has a 99% chance of being cost-eff
 ective (appendix). The 
cost per BDI-II point improvement was $6, approximately 
one third of the daily wages of an unskilled worker in 
Goa. From a societal perspective, productivity losses due 
to days unable to work and work cutback are signifi
 cantly 
lower in the EUC plus HAP group than in the EUC alone 
group (table 3), which means that the overall costs of 
HAP are no longer signifi
 cantly diff
 erent to those in the 
EUC alone group. This fi
 nding means that HAP then 
has a 98% chance of being cost-eff
 ective and a 42% 
chance of being cost saving—ie, having lower costs and 
better outcomes than has EUC alone, with similar results 
for remission and BDI-II outcomes (appendix).
Discussion
HAP as delivered by non-specialist health workers in 
routine primary care settings is eff
 ective in treatment of 
moderately severe and severe depression. HAP produced 
a moderate eff
 ect on depressive symptoms, an almost 
two-thirds increase in remission, and small eff
 ects on 
secondary outcomes related to functional impairment 
after only six to eight sessions of treatment. Baseline 
severity slightly moderated the eff
 ects of treatment; as in 
other trials,36 the magnitude of the eff
 ect was largest 
among participants with severe depression, but unlike 
those other trials, the eff
 ect is also present among those 
less severely depressed. The economic analysis per QALY 
gained indicates that HAP is cost-eff
 ective; when wide 
societal eff
 ects on productivity are considered, the 
economic case is further strengthened, with a high 
probability that the intervention could be cost saving. 
The numbers of serious adverse events observed were 
small and consistent with our observations in a previous 
trial37 in primary care with patients with common mental 
disorders.
The eff
 ect of HAP on secondary outcomes is important 
for multiple reasons. Functional impairment can persist 
after a major depressive episode and represents an 
important target of treatment. The pragmatic emphasis on 
behaviour change in HAP might be valuable to guide 
individuals with depression to improve functional capacity 
and capacity to work. Moreover, most patients with 
depression are women and the association between sex 
disadvantage and depression among women has been 
widely documented.38 Women who received HAP were 
nearly 50% less likely to report intimate partner physical 
 
violence at the end of treatment than were women in usual 
care. The focus of HAP on improvement of life context and 
problem solving directly targets many of the components 
of sex disadvantage that have been associated with 
depression among women, including those that are specifi
 c 
to the family and interpersonal context.38 This fi
 nding 
should be interpreted with caution and examined further 
in future trials. The economic case will be strengthened if

diff
 erences in health service use and productivity are 
sustained over time. The marginal costs of HAP delivery 
would also fall once a pool of trained lay counsellors has 
been established that can continue to provide services. 
Moreover, the eff
 ect of HAP on depression outcomes was 
similar to that of other studies of behavioural activation and 
cognitive and behavioural interventions delivered by 
specialist providers over more sessions than in this study.39
The study has certain limitations. First, even though 
HAP was better than what is usually done, about a third 
of participants remained depressed even after treatment. 
Our emphasis on the brevity of the intervention could 
possibly have resulted in this less than optimal absolute 
eff
 ect. Still, we believe at the very least that HAP would 
be a suitable candidate for the initial intervention in a 
stepped care system of treatment delivery for severe 
depression.40 Second, our two measures of depression 
were somewhat discordant at the end of treatment; thus, 
although BDI-II scores suggested that patients ended 
treatment at the low end of the moderate range of severity 
(on the basis of the norms used in trials in high-income 
countries),41 PHQ-9 indicated only mild residual 
symptoms. We have more confi
 dence in PHQ-9 than in 
BDI-II in this regard as it has been used extensively 
cross-culturally and validated in the study setting.19 
Furthermore, we caution against application of the 
existing norms to our study population as BDI-II was 
administered in an interview format rather than as self-
report. Third, diagnostic interviews were not carried out 
at baseline, although PHQ-9 is widely used to defi
 ne 
case-level morbidity in trials and, importantly, we used 
locally validated cutoff
 s in this study.19 Finally, the results 
in this study are restricted to the primary endpoint 
outcomes at 3 months for which our interest lies in the 
response and remission to our treatment of participants 
with moderately severe to severe depression. We intend 
to assess the sustainability of these outcomes, including 
recovery from depression, at a 12 month follow-up.
The fi
 ndings of this trial, along with the companion 
trial18 assessing CAP treatment, represent a substantial 
step in global mental health for several reasons. First, the 
interventions are brief, delivered by lay people and 
provided to primary health-care attenders with almost no 
exclusion criteria, thus enhancing their generalisability. 
Second, treatment was delivered by the same counsellors 
who concurrently delivered treatment for alcohol 
problems. We have thus shown the potential real-world 
value of our study to address the most common mental 
health and substance use disorders encountered in 
primary care by a single counsellor. However, the real-
world responsibilities of such a counsellor could 
potentially extend to other mental disorders, such as 
psychoses, and future implementation research would 
need to address how the PREMIUM treatments can be 
integrated with these broad roles. Third, the treatment 
was adapted from behavioural activation, a treatment 
that has a strong theoretical and empirical evidence base 
across multiple countries and patient populations.17 
Findings from the COBRA trial42 from the UK have 
further substantiated the equivalence of this simpler 
psychological treatment with more elaborate treatments 
such as cognitive behavioural therapy. Fourth, the 
conduct and analyses of the trials were carried out in 
adherence with the protocol and the trial indicators 
testify to high levels of internal validity. Finally, the target 
population has very low levels of awareness of depression 
as a mental health condition and virtually all participants 
primarily present for somatic concerns.43 Few, if any, 
would have had a previous diagnosis of depression or 
received a psychological treatment or antidepressants, as 
evidenced by the low number of prescriptions, even after 
the diagnosis was conveyed to the primary care 
physician.44 Ratings of therapy quality, both independent 
and by supervisors, and the high levels of treatment 
completion testify to the acceptability and feasibility of

This particular trial represents, to our knowledge, the 
fi
 rst ever publication from any low-income and middle-
income country assessing the eff
 ectiveness and cost-
eff
 ectiveness of a psychological treatment for moderately 
severe to severe depression in primary care. Further 
research should focus on replication of our fi
 ndings and 
dissemination of HAP in routine care settings in diverse 
contexts. Our dissemination eff
 orts for HAP include 
launching of an online platform for those interested to 
learn the treatment45,46 and collaborations to reverse 
engineer the treatment by assessing its eff
 ects in high-
income settings, such as in the USA. A documentary 
about the two PREMIUM trials can also be accessed 
online.47 We anticipate that these features will be key to 
the long-term goal of the evidence generated by 
PREMIUM contributing to closing of the treatment gap 
for mental disorders worldwide.
