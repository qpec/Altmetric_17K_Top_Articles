Abstract: 
1 
Background: CTX0E03 is an immortalised human neural stem cell line, developed for 
2 
allogeneic therapy (CTX-DP). Dose-dependent improvement in sensorimotor function 
3 
in rats implanted with CTX-DP four weeks after middle cerebral artery occlusion 
4 
stroke prompted investigation of the safety and tolerability of intra-cerebral 
5 
implantation of CTX-DP in stroke patients. 
6 
Methods: In an open label, single site, ascending dose study (ClinicalTrials.gov, 
7 
NCT01151124),male patients (aged≥60years) with stable disability (National Institutes 
8 
of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≥6 and modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 2-4) after 
9 
ischaemic stroke 6-60 months previously were implanted with single doses of 2, 5, 10 
10 
or 20 million cells by stereotaxic ipsilateral putamen injection. Clinical and brain 
11 
imaging data were collected over 2 years. The primary endpoint was safety (adverse 
12 
events and neurological change).   
13 
Findings: Eleven male patients (mean age 69 years; range 60-82) received CTX-DP. 
14 
Median (IQR) pre-implantation NIHSS was 7 (6, 8) and mean (±SD) time from stroke 
15 
29±14 months. Three had sub-cortical-only and 7 had right hemisphere infarcts. Up to 
16 
2 years after implantation, no immunological or cell-related adverse events were 
17 
observed. Other adverse events were related to the procedure or comorbidities. 
18 
Hyperintensity around injection tracts on magnetic resonance imaging T2W-FLAIR was 
19 
observed in 5 patients. At 2 years, range of improvement (median) in NIHSS was 0 to 5 
20 
(2) points. 
21 
Interpretation: In single intracerebral doses of up to 20 million cells, no cell-related 
22 
adverse events were observed in over 24 months. Neurological function was improved 
23 
at 24 months. Observations support further investigation of CTX-DP in stroke.

Introduction: 
29 
Stroke is the most common cause of adult neurologic disability worldwide, with an 
30 
incidence of approximately 795,000 and 152,000 people per year in the USA and UK, 
31 
respectively. Incidence, prevalence and disability-adjusted life-years lost are 
32 
predicted to rise further with population ageing.1 Stroke has profound effects on 
33 
patients and their carers alike, with an enormous economic burden to society. In the 
34 
UK stroke care accounts for 5% of total healthcare costs, approximately £8.9 billion 
35 
per year in direct and indirect costs.2 Among survivors, dependence in activities of 
36 
daily living 3 months after onset varies from 16.2%3 to 19.2%4 . Stroke rehabilitative 
37 
approaches aid functional recovery and brain reorganisation5 but the effects of 
38 
rehabilitation decrease with time after the event6 and a “plateau” of recovery from 
39 
stroke is observed with the first weeks to months, indicating limited endogenous 
40 
recovery capacity. 
41 
At a tissue level, the capacity of the brain for neurogenesis and angiogenesis suggests 
42 
that it may be possible to enhance endogenous recovery processes.7 Pharmacological 
43 
attempts to stimulate repair have to date not improved clinical outcomes, although 
44 
several agents remain under investigation.8 Cell-based therapies offer the potential to 
45 
enhance brain repair, offering a more dynamic biological response to a diverse and 
46 
changing environment in the injured brain than can be achieved with drug therapy.9 
47 
Studies of cell therapies in animal models of disease have identified effects on cell 
48 
differentiation, immunomodulation, inflammation and stimulation of endogenous 
49 
repair processes such as angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Functional improvements in 
50 
experimental stroke animal models treated with human neural stem cells (hNSCs) 
51 
support the potential of this therapeutic strategy. Intracerebral delivery of stem 
52 
cells, the preferred route in animal stroke studies of neural stem cells, has the 
53 
advantages of controlled dosing, and improved cell delivery and survival over 
54 
intravenous (IV) or intra-arterial (IA) routes that have been preferred in studies of 
55 
mesenchymal stromal or related tissue-derived cell populations.10   
56 
In rat middle cerebral artery obstruction (MCAo) models, CTX0E03 cells injected 4 
57 
weeks after MCAo, showed a dose11 and implantation site12 dependent improvement in 
58 
behavioural outcome measures along with histological evidence of increased host 
59 
striatal angiogenesis13 and neurogenesis.14 Together with preclinical evidence 
60 
  
 
4 
 
supporting long-term safety, pharmacodynamic interactions, pharmacokinetic bio-
61 
distribution and toxicology data formed the basis for a first-in-human clinical trial.     
62 
We report the results of Pilot Investigation of Stem Cells in Stroke (PISCES), a phase-1 
63 
dose escalation trial undertaken to investigate the safety and feasibility of intra-
64 
cerebral stereotactic implantation of CTX-DP in patients with chronic stable ischaemic 
65 
stroke.    
66 
Methods: 
67 
Patients 
68 
Patients with stable neurological deficits and moderate to severe disability (defined 
69 
by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale15 (NIHSS) ≥6 and modified Rankin Scale16 
70 
(mRS) of 2-4) resulting from a first ischaemic stroke 6 months to 5 years previously 
71 
were recruited. All patients gave fully informed consent. Patients were identified 
72 
through referral from rehabilitation services or self-referral triggered by media 
73 
awareness. Male patients only were recruited in order to minimise any chance of 
74 
exposure to Tamoxifen, a minor metabolite of which is the ligand for the modified c-
75 
myc growth factor gene (c-mycERTAM) governing replication of CTX0E03 cells (detailed 
76 
under “CTX0E03 Human neural stem cells”) and the “first-in-man” stage of novel 
77 
investigation. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 3 in 
78 
supplementary information. 
79 
Trial Design 
80 
PISCES was a phase-1, open-label, single centre, dose-escalation trial of intra-
81 
cerebral stereotactic implantation of CTX0E03 hNSCs. The study was approved by the 
82 
United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and 
83 
National Research Ethics Service (NRES) [previously Gene Therapy Advisory Committee 
84 
(GTAC)]. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01151124. 
85 
European Union and MHRA guidelines pertaining to Advanced Therapy Investigational 
86 
Medical Products (ATIMP) were adhered to.17 Eligible patients were recruited and in a 
87 
sequential ascending dose design, 3 cohorts of 3 patients each received a single 
88 
implantation of 2, 5 and 10 million CTX0E03 hNSC (40, 100 and 200 μL volume 
89 
respectively) with a final cohort of 2 patients receiving 20 million cells (400 μL). The 
90 
final sample size of 11 subjects was decided after interruption of cell manufacture to 
91 
  
 
5 
 
changes in ownership of a contracted manufacturing site, following MHRA consultation 
92 
and presentation of safety data. Consistent fulfilment of inclusion criteria and clinical 
93 
stability were confirmed at three visits from two months before stereotactic 
94 
implantation of CTX0E03 hNSC under general anaesthesia. Regular follow-up over 2 
95 
years included clinical and imaging data acquired at days 1 (D1), 2 (D2), 7 (D7) and 
96 
months 1 (M1), 3 (M3), 6 (M6), 12 (M12), 24 (M24) along with interspersed telephone 
97 
visits at days 14 (D14), 21 (D21) and months 2 (M2), 9 (M9) and 18 (M18). Adverse 
98 
events were documented and reviewed. The primary endpoint was safety including 
99 
adverse events, neurological deterioration or mortality. Secondary endpoints included 
100 
functional change at D1, D2, D7 and M1, M3, M6, M12, M24, post implantation. 
101 
Study Oversight and Independent Review 
102 
An independent data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC) comprising of stroke, 
103 
imaging and neurosurgical experts reviewed clinical and imaging data. The DSMC 
104 
reviewed the M1 data for the first subject at each dose level before proceeding to 
105 
subsequent subjects and M3 data after the last subject of each cohort before 
106 
recommending escalation of the cell dose. 
107 
Clinical Assessments 
108 
Assessments covered neurological impairment (NIHSS)15, disability (mRS)16, spasticity 
109 
(modified Ashworth scale)18, activities of daily living (Barthel Index, BI)19 and health-
110 
related quality of life (EuroQoL, EQ-5D)20. General physical examination and vital 
111 
signs were recorded at each visit. Blood analyses included allo-antibodies, blood 
112 
count, infective markers, renal and liver function.  
113 
CTX0E03 hNSC manufacture and delivery 
114 
The human Neural Stem Cell line CTX0E0321 was clonally derived from human foetal 
115 
cortical neuro-epithelial cells following retroviral insertion of a conditional 
116 
immortalisation transgene, c-mycERTAM.  The transgene generates a MycER fusion 
117 
protein that acts as a growth promoter in the cells under the control of 4-hydroxy 
118 
tamoxifen (4-OHT) and confers phenotypic and genotypic stability of the CTX0E03 
119 
cells through long term expansion culture. Myc dependent cell replication is curtailed 
120 
by removing 4-OHT in cultures. The hNSCs were obtained by early expansion of a 
121 
single isolation from a 12 week foetal cortical neuro-epithelium. The CTX0E03 cell 
122 
  
 
6 
 
line has undergone cell expansion and banking and long term storage in liquid 
123 
nitrogen in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP).  CTX-DP is 
124 
manufactured under GMP from cryopreserved CTX0E03 cells as an Advanced Therapy 
125 
Investigational Medicinal Product (ATIMP) intended for allogeneic treatment.22 The 
126 
CTX-DP is aseptically manufactured as a colourless, opaque, slightly viscous 
127 
suspension composed of CTX0E03 cells at a concentration of 5x104 cells/μL. The 
128 
diluent, ‘HTS-FRS (Biolife Solutions, Bothell, USA)’ is made up of ions, buffers, 
129 
impermeants, colloid, metabolites and an antioxidant. The final formulation is devoid 
130 
of 4-OHT and growth factors, restoring the cells’ capability to differentiate. For every 
131 
treated subject, CTX-DP was manufactured in a commercial GMP facility on the day of 
132 
the surgery, transported to the hospital pharmacy under strict temperature control 
133 
(2-8 0C) and implanted intra-cerebrally within 3 hours of transfer to room 
134 
temperature in the operating theatre. Cell implantation was targeted to the putamen 
135 
ipsilateral to the infarct since this was equivalent to the site of implantation in rodent 
136 
studies, and in addition there is prior clinical experience confirming the safety of this 
137 
approach for similar volumes of cells. 
138 
Surgical Procedure 
139 
Patients were reviewed by the study neurosurgeon at a pre-admission visit for 
140 
discussion. Patients were admitted a day before surgery for clinical assessments, 
141 
surgical consent and anaesthetic review. On the day of surgery, following a qualified 
142 
person’s quality approval of the CTX-DP, patients underwent CT head under general 
143 
anaesthesia with a Leksell Stereotactic frame fitted (Elekta Instruments, Sweden). 
144 
The operating surgeon identified suitable targets and trajectories within the basal 
145 
ganglia of the affected side using pre-operatively acquired magnetic resonance 
146 
imaging (MRI) (T1weighted 3D). These images were then fused with the stereotactic 
147 
CT dataset using BrainLab iStereotaxy software and co-ordinates for the targets and 
148 
entry points generated. A single 15mm burr-hole situated according to the calculated 
149 
co-ordinates was fashioned using a craniotome. The first 2 cohorts (2 x106 & 5 x106 
150 
dose) had a single injection tract to deliver cells. The 3rd (10x106 dose) and 4th (20 
151 
x106 dose) cohort required 2 and 4 tracts respectively. A maximum of 100μL was 
152 
delivered per tract at the rate of 5μL/min in 20uL boluses at each of 5 points 
153 
separated by 1mm along the tract. A sterile stainless steel implantation cannula 
154 
(inner diameter= 0.35mm, outer diameter= 0.9mm, length= 235mm; manufactured 
155 
and CE marked as a Class III medical device by ReNeuron, based on a design described 
156 
  
 
7 
 
by Kondziolka et al23) with a luer hub was mounted within a Backlund injection needle 
157 
(Elekta, Sweden) and attached to a 250μL Hamilton syringe (CE marked by ReNeuron 
158 
as a sterile, class I medical device). Operative times (first incision to last stitch) 
159 
ranged from 50 to 140 minutes. Patients were observed in the recovery ward until 
160 
fully awake and stable physiologically before being returned to a neurosurgical ward. 
161 
Brain Imaging 
 
162 
Brain MRI was performed on a 3-Tesla GE-Signa-Excite-HDxt (General Electric, 
163 
Milwaukee, USA) scanner. The protocol for structural brain imaging included T1W 
164 
sagittal FLAIR (Time to Echo (TE) 8.5ms, Time to repetition (TR) 2.5s, Inversion time 
165 
(TI) 920ms), T1W IR-FSPGR 3-dimensional  (TE1.5ms, TR7.2ms, TI500ms), T2W PROP 
166 
Fast Spin Echo (TR5s,TE109.2ms), T2* gradient echo (TE22ms, TR670ms, flip angle 
167 
10º) and T2W FLAIR (TE140ms, TR10s, TI2250ms, slice thickness 5mm, slice gap 
168 
1.5mm) sequences. These were acquired at day -56, day -21, M1, M3, M12 and M24. 
169 
Additional T1w 3D post gadolinium and T2w 3-dimensional FLAIR (TE128.3ms, 
170 
TR6000ms, TI1857ms) were acquired after January 2014 following scanner software 
171 
upgrade. An experienced neuroradiologist reviewed all images.  
172 
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was acquired at multiple (D-21, M1 and M12) time 
173 
points to measure longitudinal change in fractional anisotropy (FA), a surrogate 
174 
marker of white matter integrity, around the needle tracts. One acquisition of DTI 
175 
images (TR11s, TE87.1ms, matrix 128x128, FOV240, 1.8x1.8x5 mm voxels, 34 
176 
directions with b values 0 and 1000 s/mm) was collected. DTI pre-processing and 
177 
region-of-interest analyses are included in supplementary information. 
178 
Immunological Monitoring 
179 
Patients did not receive any immunosuppressive therapy. Venous blood was obtained 
180 
for analysis of HLA Class I and II antibodies against CTX0E03 pre-treatment and at M1, 
181 
M3, M6, M12 and M24. Allo-antibody positive patients were excluded prior to 
182 
implantation. 
183 
Statistical Analysis 
184 
Adverse events and change in NIHSS neurological function were recorded. Functional 
185 
outcome data are reported as either median and interquartile range (Q1, Q3) or mean 
186 
  
 
8 
 
and standard deviation (SD). All statistics were done using SAS v9.3, Microsoft Excel 
187 
2010 and Minitab 16.  Change in FA on DTI is reported using the Cohen’s d effect size.  
188 
Role of Funding Source 
189 
The sponsors of the study contributed to study design but had no role in patient 
190 
selection, recruitment, data collection, follow-up and imaging analysis. They 
191 
reviewed the trial report before submission for publication. All authors had full access 
192 
to the data. The responsibility for submission was that of the corresponding author, 
193 
agreed by the DSMC chair. 
194 
Results: 
195 
Thirteen male patients were recruited between September 2010 and January 2013, of 
196 
whom 2 were, excluded pre-implantation, one due to a seizure, and the other for the 
197 
presence of a possible allo-antibody. Eleven received CTX-DP. This report covers the 
198 
period up to median follow-up post implantation of 44 months (range 33 to 60 
199 
months), with the last recruited patient completing 33 months. Baseline 
200 
demographics and stroke characteristics are listed in Table 1. A lesion overlap map 
201 
showing the distribution of cerebral infarcts is shown in figure 2. Individual scans are 
202 
available in the web-appendix (figure 9).     
203 
Adverse Events 
204 
All patients were discharged home on day 2 after surgery. Serious adverse events 
205 
(SAE) are summarised in Table 2 (non-serious adverse events are described in table 4 
206 
in the web-appendix). All SAEs were related to the neurosurgical procedure, or to 
207 
incidental or known medical conditions. One new ischaemic stroke, an occipital 
208 
infarct not present on day -56 or day -21 brain imaging, was noticed retrospectively 
209 
on the pre-surgical CT, but identified clinically only after new visual symptoms were 
210 
described by the subject some weeks later. A superficial malignant melanoma 
211 
occurred in one subject with chronic sun exposure history. No event was considered 
212 
attributable to CTX-DP.         
213 
Screening for cellular rejection 
214 
All CTX-DP implanted patients were HLA negative before and after intervention.

Functional Outcome Measures 
216 
Individual patient data showing changes in NIHSS, Ashworth arm and leg scores, 
217 
Barthel Index, and EQ-5D over time are shown in Figure 3: all functional measures 
218 
change from baseline (figure 6) and median change by dose cohort (figure 7) are 
219 
available in online web-appendix. Pre-operative neurological deficits and spasticity 
220 
were stable in all patients. After CTX-DP implantation, improvements over time were 
221 
noted in NIHSS, summated Ashworth scores for arm and leg and Barthel Index. 
222 
Disability as measured by modified Rankin scale at 1 year, was unchanged in 7/11 
223 
patients and improved by 1 grade in 4 patients and at 2 years, was unchanged in 
224 
7/11, worsened by 2 grades in 1/11 and improved by 1 grade in 3/11 patients. 
225 
Patient-reported overall health state as measured by the visual analogue sub-score of 
226 
the EQ-5D improved by median 18 (-5, 30) at 12 months compared to baseline.    
227 
Brain Imaging 
228 
Qualitative: Five patients (P2, P3, P4, P7 and P9) showed hyper-intensity around the 
229 
needle injection tract on T2w FLAIR images. Hyper-intensity was first seen at M1 and 
230 
persisted at M24 (figure 4a). Two further patients (P1 and P8) had subtle increase in 
231 
pre-existing peri-infarct white matter T2w FLAIR hyper-intensity between M1 and M12 
232 
(figure 4b). No changes were seen in the remainder of the patients. No clinical 
233 
association with these changes was observed. The DSMC’s qualitative safety review of 
234 
all scans concluded no significant increase in T2w hyper-intensities over time.     
235 
Quantitative: Mean FA on an axial ROI was reduced at 1 month (post implantation) 
236 
compared to baseline since voxels within the injection tract contributed zero values. 
237 
At month 12 compared to month 1, four patients (P2, P4, P7, P9) showed reduced FA 
238 
in 17/28 sampled slices (n=4) and increased FA in 9/28 slices (figure 5). All slices 
239 
showed reduced FA in 1 patient (P3). In 4/9 slices increased FA was closer to putamen 
240 
and 5/9 slices were closer to cortex. 
241 
Discussion: 
242 
This “first-in-man” study offers preliminary data on the feasibility, tolerability and 
243 
cell-related safety of stereotactic intra-cerebral injection of the genetically modified 
244 
human neural stem cell line CTX0E03-DP in patients with chronic ischaemic stroke.   
245 
  
 
10 
 
We observed 4 asymptomatic procedural SAEs in 4 of 11 patients, consistent with 
246 
safety data for brain stereotactic procedures generally.24 Unlike previous trials in 
247 
stroke of teratocarcinoma-derived neuronal cells 25,26 and foetal porcine cells27, we 
248 
did not observe any post-operative seizures. In one patient a seizure event, 10 months 
249 
after implantation, was likely precipitated by alcohol withdrawal. Superficial 
250 
melanoma was diagnosed on histology (pT1a N0 M0)28 in 1 patient, 6 months after 
251 
elective excision of a painful mole that had been present in a sun-exposed region 
252 
(pinna) for >10 years. This patient had previously been prescribed antimetabolite skin 
253 
creams for sun-related skin injury. The majority of other adverse events were due to 
254 
systemic co-morbidities including falls and elective procedures that required hospital 
255 
admissions. This profile is expected in disabled stroke survivors with multiple 
256 
comorbidities.29    
257 
Hyper-intensity on T2 weighted FLAIR MRI was observed around the needle tract in 5 
258 
patients at some point during the follow-up period. In general, this may be 
259 
attributable to various causes including localised inflammation, graft-host reaction, 
260 
gliosis or dysmyelinosis. Studies of longitudinal imaging in patients following 
261 
stereotactic procedures for functional reasons are lacking, so it is unclear whether 
262 
this imaging feature is related specifically to cell injection. Increased FA after cell 
263 
implantation as was observed in several axial slices along the tract has been related 
264 
to increased myelination in some conditions, 30, 31 suggesting potential improvement 
265 
in microstructural white matter. Planned post-mortem pathological studies may in 
266 
time offer additional data to characterise this finding.   
267 
In animal models, stem cells of various kinds are associated with better neurological 
268 
outcomes after focal brain ischaemia. Human neural stem cells have neural cell 
269 
differentiation potential in addition to paracrine effects, and have most commonly 
270 
been developed as allogeneic therapy, giving the potential flexibility of implantation 
271 
in acute or sub-acute periods without dependence on successful cell harvest, 
272 
extracorporeal cell expansion in a laboratory from days to weeks and uncertain dosing 
273 
inherent in autologous cell therapies. Stereotactic intracranial injection ensures 
274 
delivery of the intended cell dose to the target site adjacent to the ischaemic 
275 
damage, replicating the conditions of animal studies of CTX-DP and offering a strategy 
276 
more likely to yield proof-of-concept for cell therapy than less invasive routes. IV or 
277 
IA administration might be safer, but animal data indicate that these routes result in 
278 
  
 
11 
 
negligible cell engraftment in the brain10 and are therefore reliant on diffuse 
279 
paracrine or even peripherally mediated therapeutic effects.32 
280 
Exploratory indices of efficacy were secondary end-points. Given small patient 
281 
numbers, a heterogeneous population, and the open-label, single arm design, no 
282 
reliable conclusions can be drawn about the effects of cell implantation on 
283 
neurological or functional change. It was notable, however, that despite selection of 
284 
chronic, stable patients at late stages after stroke, the majority of participants 
285 
showed some improvement across several indices of function, including in 4 
286 
individuals (median 32.5 months since stroke; range 21-51) moving across a modified 
287 
Rankin Scale threshold. Whether attributable to cell implantation or to other factors, 
288 
such as engagement with trial evaluations and increased generic medical input, 
289 
change in this population suggests that trials of intervention at late stages of stroke, 
290 
when recovery is not generally believed to be attainable, may be worthwhile. 
291 
Anecdotal accounts described reduced spasticity, minor return of finger movement at 
292 
phalangeal joints, improved visual perception and better bed-to-chair transfers, and 
293 
are supported by changes in spasticity, health-related quality of life, activities of 
294 
daily living and neurological impairment. 
295 
The NIHSS score was selected as an objective tool for identifying post-implantation 
296 
deterioration. Other indices of neurological function are likely to offer better 
297 
sensitivity to neurological functional change in future trials. Given the early nature of 
298 
stem cell research with no reproductive toxicology evidence available for stem cells 
299 
of other origin or CTX neural stem cells in particular which have used a Tamoxifen 
300 
analogue receptor33 for in-vitro control of cell number replication, only males were 
301 
considered for this stage of trial. However, together with no preclinical evidence of 
302 
in-vivo cell cycle switching observed and safety data from PISCES, future studies will 
303 
not be limited to male patients only. 
304 
Patients were not administered immunosuppressive drugs since non clinical studies of 
305 
CTX0E03 found no evidence of cell survival and efficacy requiring immunosuppression, 
306 
in vitro studies for MHC-DR and MHC-ABC showed low protein expression for CTX0E03 
307 
and to minimise the risk of post-stroke infections which are independently associated 
308 
with poor outcome. 
309 
  
 
12 
 
The putamen was chosen for implantation based on preclinical data as the closest 
310 
intact subcortical neuronal cluster and preferable to white matter injections that can 
311 
cause pressure-related further axonal injury. Dose selection was extrapolated by 
312 
scaling up from efficacious doses in rats and an ascending dose design selected to 
313 
allow cautious dose increments after safety review. Inclusion of appropriate 
314 
concurrent controls and measures to ensure blinding will be essential for future 
315 
efficacy-focussed investigations. The value of including control groups in early phase 
316 
clinical investigations involving invasive procedures in small numbers of severely 
317 
disabled subjects is debated. A non-operated control group, although considered, was 
318 
not pursued as it was thought unlikely to provide valid control data, especially given 
319 
stroke lesion heterogeneity and small patient numbers. A placebo surgery control 
320 
group raises ethical concerns about exposure to surgical and anaesthesia risks, and 
321 
may be unacceptable to patients.34  
322 
Limitations: A small sample size by design limits the number of patients being 
323 
exposed to each dose level, particularly only two patients receiving the highest dose 
324 
due to cell production issues. Any adverse events of low incidence may not therefore 
325 
have been identified. Safety was assessed over a 2 year period, but it is conceivable 
326 
that longer term safety issues might occur, and lifelong surveillance is being 
327 
undertaken. The open label design and lack of control subjects mean that exploratory 
328 
efficacy data should be regarded with extreme caution. It is possible to exclude the 
329 
possibility that any neurological change over time might result from stereotaxic 
330 
injection rather than cell implantation, although such effects have not been observed 
331 
in animal models with placebo injection. 
332 
In conclusion, we observed no adverse events after treating 11 chronic stroke patients 
333 
with intracerebral implantation of CTX hNSC and the longitudinal clinical observations 
334 
suggest that this novel cell therapy for ischaemic stroke is feasible, safe and would 
335 
warrant a larger, phase 2 trial. 
336 
Panel: Research in Context 
337 
Systematic Review: We searched the PubMed database from inception to March 16, 
338 
2016 for articles published in any language, with the search terms “neural stem 
339 
cells”, “ischaemic stroke” and “clinical trial or study”, excluding articles concerning  
340 
mesenchymal stem cells, bone marrow derived cells, animal studies and non-
341 
  
 
13 
 
ischaemic stroke. We found no studies that have investigated intracranial delivery of 
342 
neural stem cells alone. One study35 compared and reported intra-cisternal delivery of 
343 
a combination of human foetal neural stem progenitor cells of unspecified origin and 
344 
MSCs with IV MSCs alone in 6 patients between 1 week and 2 years after stroke. 
345 
Intracranial delivery of autologous cells in stroke has been reported for 
346 
teratocarcinoma-derived cells.26 There are several published and on-going studies 
347 
investigating IV delivery of autologous MSCs which have several differences compared 
348 
to NSCs including timing, mechanism of action and delivery.   
349 
Interpretation: Our study is the first report of the intracranial administration of 
350 
human neural stem cells in chronic ischaemic stroke patients. These results are a 
351 
significant addition to the current literature because of the novel potential treatment 
352 
for stroke patients, however further research in carefully selected patients is needed.
