SUMMARY
The ongoing epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) illustrates
the importance of flaviviruses as emerging human
pathogens. All vector-borne flaviviruses studied
thus far have to overcome type I interferon (IFN) to
replicate and cause disease in vertebrates. The
mechanism(s)
by
which
ZIKV
antagonizes
IFN
signaling is unknown. Here, we report that the
nonstructural protein NS5 of ZIKV and other flavivi-
ruses examined could suppress IFN signaling, but
through different mechanisms. ZIKV NS5 expression
resulted in proteasomal degradation of the IFN-regu-
lated transcriptional activator STAT2 from humans,
but not mice, which may explain the requirement
for IFN deficiency to observe ZIKV-induced disease
in mice. The mechanism of ZIKV NS5 resembles
dengue virus (DENV) NS5 and not its closer relative,
Spondweni virus (SPOV). However, unlike DENV,
ZIKV did not require the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR4 to
induce STAT2 degradation. Hence, flavivirus NS5
proteins exhibit a remarkable functional conver-
gence in IFN antagonism, albeit by virus-specific
mechanisms.
INTRODUCTION
Flaviviruses constitute the most important and diverse group of
arthropod-transmitted viruses causing disease in humans.
They include dengue virus (DENV), tick-borne encephalitis vi-
ruses (TBEVs), yellow fever virus (YFV), and West Nile virus
(WNV), among other human pathogens. In the last decades,
mosquito-borne flaviviruses have caused significant epidemic
outbreaks, including DENV, WNV, and, more recently, Zika virus
(ZIKV), associated with dramatic expansion of their geographical
distribution (Coffey et al., 2013; Lazear and Diamond, 2016).
ZIKV is a mosquito-borne member of the Spondweni virus
(SPOV) group. Both ZIKV and SPOV were known to cause
limited, sporadic outbreaks in Africa and Southeast Asia
(Haddow et al., 2012; Wolfe et al., 1982). However, ZIKV has
emerged in the South Pacific and South and Central America
associated with sustained transmission affecting an estimated
0.5 to 1.5 million people. The ZIKV epidemic is associated with
severe fetal abnormalities including stillbirth and microcephaly
(Rasmussen et al., 2016), or with the Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome
in infected adults (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016).
Type I interferon (IFN) invokes a potent antiviral state in the cell
following stimulation of two IFN receptor subunits (IFNAR1 and
IFNAR2) to activate the Janus kinases (Jak1 and Tyk2) and signal
transducers of transcription (STAT1 and STAT2), leading to
the upregulation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)
(MacMicking, 2012). The importance of IFN in host antiviral
innate immunity is highlighted by the diversity of viral IFN antag-
onists found in vertebrate viruses (Versteeg and Garcı
´a-Sastre,
2010). Efficient IFN antagonism might be particularly critical for
mosquito-borne arboviruses, such as flaviviruses, which require
viral loads in blood (viremia) to maintain their vector-host cycles.
Various strategies of IFN antagonism have been demonstrated
for well-known flaviviruses, such as DENV, WNV, YFV, and
TBEV (Versteeg and Garcı
´a-Sastre, 2010). However, the flavivi-
ruses encompass more than 70 diverse but phylogenetically
related viruses, suggesting that the full spectrum of flavivirus-en-
coded strategies to suppress this critical host response is only
beginning to be explored.
Flaviviruses share a replication strategy based on the genera-
tion of a polyprotein from the single-stranded positive RNA
genome. The polyprotein is proteolytically processed by viral
and host proteases to produce three structural (C, prM, and E)
and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3,
NS4A, NS4B, and NS5), the latter of which are involved in viral
RNA synthesis and replication. While multiple viral proteins
have been described for WNV and DENV to either prevent IFN
induction or to inhibit IFN signaling (Aguirre et al., 2012; Liu
et al., 2004, 2005; Mun
˜ oz-Jordan et al., 2003), the NS5 protein
is a potent and specific antagonist of IFN signaling shown for
all human flaviviruses tested so far (Ashour et al., 2009; Best
et al., 2005; Laurent-Rolle et al., 2010, 2014; Lin et al., 2006;
Lubick et al., 2015; Mazzon et al., 2009; Morrison et al., 2013).
In addition, the flavivirus NS5 encodes both the viral methyltrans-
ferase and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase required for
viral RNA synthesis. Intriguingly, NS5-mediated inhibition of

 IFN signaling is exerted by different mechanisms depending on
the specific flavivirus. WNV NS5 targets the host protein proli-
dase to prevent surface expression of IFNAR1 (Lubick et al.,
2015); by contrast, DENV NS5 recruits the host E3 ubiquitin
ligase UBR4 to degrade STAT2 (Morrison et al., 2013). In addi-
tion, YFV NS5 binds to STAT2, but only after IFN treatment,
and this prevents STAT2 binding to ISRE (IFN-stimulated
responsive element) promoter elements present upstream of
ISGs (Laurent-Rolle et al., 2014). NS5-mediated IFN antagonism
has been shown to be essential for resistance to IFN in cell cul-
ture (Laurent-Rolle et al., 2010, 2014) and for virulence in mouse
models of infection (Lubick et al., 2015).
Based on the remarkable functional similarities but mecha-
nistic diversities by which the NS5 of well-known flaviviruses
inhibit IFN signaling, we asked whether this paradigm applies
to other members of the flavivirus group, including SPOV and
ZIKV. In all cases, NS5 inhibited IFN-induced gene expression
in human cells, indicating a functional conservation of IFN antag-
onism among flavivirus NS5 proteins. However, mechanistically
NS5 function was diverse. These findings highlight remarkable
diversity in the function of NS5 in IFN antagonism by pathogenic
flaviviruses.
RESULTS
The NS5 protein is the most conserved of flavivirus proteins,
although it exhibits up to 45% amino acid difference among vec-
tor-borne flaviviruses. A phylogenetic tree of NS5 sequences
from representative flaviviruses is shown in Figure 1A. We were
interested in determining if NS5 from distantly related flaviviruses
with known vertebrate hosts was capable of inhibiting IFN
signaling and the mechanism behind it. We initially examined
NS5 function from four different evolutionary clades members
within the Flaviviridae family: Yokose (YOKV), Iguape (IGUV),
Spondweni (SPOV), and Usutu (USUV) viruses. The amino acid
identity of the NS5 of these flaviviruses as compared to the
more studied Langat virus (LGTV), YFV, DENV, Japanese en-
cephalitis virus (JEV), and WNV is shown in Figure 1B.
YOKV is distantly related to, but within the clade of, YFV (Fig-
ure 1A). YOKV was isolated from a bat (Miniopterus fuliginosus)
in Japan in 1971 (Cook and Holmes, 2006). IGUV is in a clade
together with Kokobera virus (Figure 1A). It was isolated from a
sentinel forest mouse in Brazil in 1979 and is suspected to infect
mice, marsupials, and birds (Coimbra et al., 1993). SPOV is a
mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to ZIKV. It is the caus-
ative agent of Spondweni fever in sub-Saharan Africa and Papua
New Guinea (Grard et al., 2010). USUV is within the clade of the
JEV complex, which also encompasses WNV. It was first identi-
fied in South Africa in 1959, its primary hosts include Culex
mosquitoes and birds, and like WNV, it can also cause enceph-
alitis in humans (Engel et al., 2016). In 2001, USUV was found for
the first time outside Africa as the causative agent of high mortal-
ity in blackbirds in Austria (Engel et al., 2016).
Expression of all YOKV, IGUV, SPOV, and USUV NS5s sup-
pressed IFN-induced, ISRE-dependent gene expression in a
dose-dependent manner in human 293T cells, similar to DENV
type 2 (DENV2) NS5, albeit with different efficiencies (Figure 1C).
Most of the inhibitory activity of the IGUV NS5, but not of any
other NS5, appeared due to general inhibition of gene expres-
sion, as monitored by reporter gene expression under a consti-
tutively active promoter (Figure 1D). In order to investigate
whether NS5-mediated IFN antagonism functioned upstream
or downstream of STAT1/STAT2, we monitored STAT1/2 levels
and phosphorylation before and after IFN treatment in 293T cells
(Figure 1E). In these experiments, NS5s from DENV2, YFV, and
WNV were used as controls. In the case of DENV NS5, this pro-
tein was expressed as a precursor polyprotein that becomes
proteolytically cleaved; as we previously demonstrated, this
was required for its functional activity (Ashour et al., 2009). As ex-
pected (Ashour et al., 2009), DENV2 NS5 expression degraded
STAT2 (Figure 1E, lanes 3 and 4). However, no other flavivirus
NS5 appeared to degrade STAT2 or STAT1. Also as expected
(Laurent-Rolle et al., 2010), expression of WNV NS5 inhibited
STAT1 phosphorylation after IFN treatment (Figure 1E, lane 8).
A similar suppression of STAT1 phosphorylation was observed
in cells expressing either USUV or YOKV NS5 (Figure 1E, lanes
10 and 12). Western blots also showed a trend of WNV, USUV,
and YOKV NS5 to inhibit STAT2 phosphorylation. The inability
of IGUV NS5 to prevent STAT phosphorylation (Figure 1E, lane
16) is consistent with a mechanism of preventing ISRE induction
based on general inhibition of gene expression (Figure 1D).
Finally, SPOV NS5 did not prevent STAT phosphorylation (Fig-
ure 1E, lane 14), suggesting that it suppresses IFN signaling
downstream of STAT phosphorylation, as is also the case for
YFV NS5 (Laurent-Rolle et al., 2014) (Figure 1E, lane 6). We
next tested whether any of these flavivirus NS5 proteins were
competent to bind either STAT1 or STAT2 by immunoprecipita-
tion (IP). YFV NS5 is known to bind and inhibit STAT2 after type I
IFN treatment (Laurent-Rolle et al., 2014) (Figure 1F, lane 6).
DENV2 NS5 also binds to STAT2, but this binding is independent
of IFN treatment (Ashour et al., 2009) (Figure 1F, lanes 7 and 8).
As a positive control for both STAT1 and STAT2 binding, we used
the Nipah virus (NiV) V protein (Rodriguez et al., 2004; Shaw
et al., 2004) (Figure 1F, lanes 3 and 4). The irrelevant
protein mTRIM61 was used as negative control (Figure 1F, lanes
1 and 2). None of the other flavivirus NS5s were found to bind to

 either STAT1 or STAT2, with the exception of SPOV NS5, which
showed very weak binding to STAT2 only after western blot over-
exposure (data not shown).
Type I IFN-induced STAT1/2 phosphorylation triggers their
translocation to the nucleus. To confirm the results on STAT1/2
phosphorylation of Figure 1E, we conducted immunofluores-
cence assay (IFA) in cells expressing flavivirus NS5s. Expression
of USUV and YOKV NS5s prevented STAT1/2 nuclear transloca-
tion after IFN treatment in Vero cells (Figures 1G and 1H), similar
to NiV V protein and WNV NS5, and consistent with their inhibi-
tion of STAT phosphorylation. However, expression of the SPOV
and IGUV NS5s did not prevent IFN-mediated translocation of
STAT1 or STAT2 (Figures 1G and 1H, lower panels), indicative
of a mechanism of inhibition of IFN signaling downstream of
STAT phosphorylation and translocation.
While in the process of conducting this comparative analysis
of flavivirus NS5s, the emergence of the ZIKV outbreak in South
America prompted us to add ZIKV NS5 to our studies. We
chemically synthesized and cloned the NS5 of ZIKV based on
GenBank: KJ776791.1 of the French Polynesia (FP) isolate,
which is closely related to the ZIKV strains involved in ongoing
epidemic in the Americas (Figure 1B). We then compared the
IFN antagonistic properties of ZIKV NS5 to its close relative
SPOV. Expression of ZIKV NS5, similar to SPOV NS5, prevented
the activation of an IFN-inducible reporter gene in 293T cell
treated with type I IFN (Figure 2A). However, in contrast to
SPOV NS5, ZIKV NS5 strongly interacted with STAT2 (but not
with STAT1) in IP experiments in 293T cells (Figure 2B). This
interaction was independent of IFN treatment (Figure 2B, lanes
9 and 10) but was associated with a general reduction in
STAT2 levels in ZIKV NS5-expressing cells (Figure 2B, lanes 9
and 10, whole-cell extract). This is reminiscent of DENV2 NS5,
which is known to bind to STAT2 and target it for degradation
(Ashour et al., 2009). In order to determine whether this observa-
tion was evolutionarily conserved among ZIKV strains, we
cloned the NS5 from the viral RNA of the original ZIKV Uganda
(UG) isolate and tested its ability to bind STAT2 and reduce
STAT2 protein levels. The NS5 of ZIKV UG strain also bound to
STAT2 (Figure 3F) and reduced STAT2 levels in a dose-depen-
dent manner (Figure 2C). To examine whether ZIKV NS5 co-lo-
calizes with STAT2, we co-expressed ZIKV NS5 and STAT2 in
Vero cells. Ectopic expression of STAT2 was required to prevent

 loss of signal due to ZIKV-induced reduction of endogenous
STAT2. In the absence of STAT2 overexpression, ZIKV NS5
localized mainly in the nucleus (Figure 2D, upper panels). Pre-
dominant nuclear localization has been reported for several
other flavivirus NS5 proteins, such as DENV and YFV (Hanne-
mann et al., 2013; Laurent-Rolle et al., 2014), even though the
role of NS5 in viral RNA replication is in the cytosol. In the case
of ZIKV NS5, nuclear localization was primarily associated with
nuclear dots. We do not currently know the nature and signifi-
cance of this distribution. Interestingly, following overexpression
of human STAT2, ZIKV NS5 re-localized from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm, where it co-localized with STAT2 (Figure 2D, lower
panels), indicative of a strong interaction between both proteins.
ZIKV NS5 expression also prevented the translocation of endog-
enous STAT2 to the nucleus after IFN treatment (Figure 2E).
Taken together, these results indicate that ZIKV NS5 inhibits
IFN signaling by a mechanism involving STAT2 binding and
most likely STAT2 degradation, which is similar to DENV NS5,
yet different from its closer relative SPOV.
Next, we investigated type I IFN signaling in ZIKV-infected
cells. For this purpose, we infected Vero cells with ZIKV (UG
MR766 strain), treated them with IFN at 24 hr post-infection,
and visualized STAT2 translocation 30 min post-IFN treatment
by IFA. As seen in Figure 3A, ZIKV infection prevented STAT2
translocation to the nucleus. In addition, ZIKV infection inhibited
the IFN induction of the ISGs ISG15 and OAS1, as measured by
qRT-PCR (Figure 3B). Next, we tested STAT2 degradation upon
ZIKV infection with both UG and Puerto Rico (PR) strain, which is
currently circulating and evolutionarily closely related to the FP
strain (Lanciotti et al., 2016). Vero cells infected with both ZIKV
strains exhibited dramatically reduced STAT2 levels, suggesting
a mechanistic conservation of STAT2 degradation among ZIKV
isolates (Figure 3C). Reduced levels of STAT2 during ZIKV infec-
tion were due to proteasomal degradation, as STAT2 expression
was rescued in ZIKV-infected cells by inhibitors of the protea-
some (Figure 3D). This finding was similar to the mechanism of
STAT2 antagonism by DENV NS5, which was included as a pos-
itive control. Overall, ZIKV infection recapitulates the inhibition of
IFN signaling and reduction of STAT2 levels observed in cells
exclusively expressing ZIKV NS5.
The only other flavivirus known to target STAT2 for degrada-
tion in infected cells is DENV (Ashour et al., 2009; Morrison
et al., 2013). In the case of DENV NS5, we have shown that it
binds to STAT2 and co-opts the host E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR4
to mediate STAT2 degradation (Ashour et al., 2009; Morrison
et al., 2013). To investigate whether ZIKV-induced degradation

 of STAT2 has a similar requirement for UBR4, we infected 293T
cells that have been genetically edited by CRISPR/Cas9 to
knock out UBR4 expression (Tripathi et al., 2015) and deter-
mined STAT2 levels. As shown in Figure 3E, and in contrast to
DENV infection, ZIKV infection resulted in reduced STAT2 levels
independently of the presence or absence of UBR4 expression.
Consistent with these data, NS5 of DENV, but not of ZIKV, inter-
acts with UBR4 in IP experiments (Figure 3F). Thus, even though
both DENV and ZIKV infection result in STAT2 degradation and
inhibition of IFN signaling, they utilize divergent mechanisms.
To determine if the findings associated with ectopic expres-
sion of ZIKV are relevant to ZIKV biology, we generated an
anti-peptide antibody that recognizes ZIKV NS5, which was
confirmed by western blot on virus-infected cells (Figure 4F).
IFA revealed predominant nuclear localization of NS5 in ZIKV-in-
fected cells in distinct bodies (Figure 4A), similar to ectopic

expression. Three recent publications
demonstrate that mouse susceptibility
to ZIKV requires complete genetic dele-
tion of type I IFN signaling through the
use of IFNAR-deficient mouse strains
(Aliota et al., 2016; Lazear et al., 2016;
Rossi et al., 2016). This suggests that
ZIKV IFN antagonism may be species
dependent. In support of this, overex-
pression of ZIKV NS5, along with mouse
STAT2, did not result in re-localization of
ZIKV NS5 to the cytoplasm (Figure 4B),
unlike that observed with human STAT2
(Figure 2D), indicating a lack of interac-
tion between ZIKV NS5 and mouse
STAT2. This observation was confirmed
by IP assays (Figure 4C). Furthermore, vi-
rus replication in primary human fibro-
blasts, previously shown to be permissive
to ZIKV replication (Hamel et al., 2015),
resulted in STAT2 degradation. In contrast, STAT2 levels were
unaffected in ZIKV-infected primary mouse embryonic fibro-
blasts (MEFs) (Figure 4D), associated with no detectable virus
production in these cells (Figure 4E). Lastly, IFNAR-deficient
MEFs were able to support ZIKV replication (Figure 4F), in
contrast to wild-type MEFs, demonstrating viral restriction is
dependent on an intact IFN signaling response and further exem-
plifying the requirement of IFN antagonism for ZIKV replication.
In summation, these results suggest that our findings observed
by ectopic NS5 expression recapitulate the major features of
IFN antagonism exhibited during ZIKV infection. Furthermore,
with the possibility that additional restriction factors might be
responsible for the lack of replication of ZIKV in MEFs, these re-
sults
imply
that
species-restricted
IFN
antagonism
may
contribute to the efficient control of ZIKV replication and lack
of pathology in IFN-competent mouse models.

 DISCUSSION
It is known that previously studied flaviviruses have evolved in-
dependent and diverse mechanisms to prevent type I IFN
signaling in vertebrate hosts, despite using the same viral pro-
tein, NS5, to achieve this goal. Here, we have shown that two
closely related flaviviruses, ZIKV and SPOV, encode an NS5
that inhibits type I IFN signaling in human cells. However,
these two viruses utilize different mechanisms. ZIKV NS5
binds and degrades human STAT2, whereas SPOV only
weakly binds STAT2, and does not degrade STAT2 or affect
STAT2 phosphorylation and nuclear localization. Therefore,
SPOV NS5 functions downstream of these events and could
conceivably interfere with ISGF3 binding to ISRE promoter el-
ements. However, SPOV may affect other events necessary for
ISG expression, such as epigenetic histone modification or
long non-coding RNA expression (Kroczynska et al., 2014;
Ouyang et al., 2014). Future studies will be needed to deter-
mine the precise mechanism of action. The ability of SPOV
NS5 to antagonize human IFN signaling, combined with the
fact that SPOV is mosquito-borne, suggests that this virus
may have the potential to emerge more broadly in human
populations.
Antagonism of IFN-mediated signal transduction by ZIKV
NS5 shares multiple similarities with that of DENV NS5. Both
NS5 proteins bind and degrade STAT2 via the proteasome
and accomplish this in a highly specific, species-restricted
fashion, which is exemplified by the ability to degrade human
and non-human primate (as shown in Vero cells) STAT2, but
not mouse STAT2 (Ashour et al., 2010). This likely reflects the
similar natural history of the two viruses. ZIKV was originally
isolated from sentinel rhesus monkeys in 1947 in UG and sepa-
rately in Aedes africanus mosquitoes shortly thereafter (Dick,
1952; Dick et al., 1952), suggesting a sylvatic mosquito-non-
human-primate cycle of transmission similar to DENV (Haddow
et al., 2012). The implication from the work here is that the
inability of ZIKV to cause disease in IFN-competent mice
(despite lethality in IFNAR-deficient mice) (Aliota et al., 2016;
Lazear et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016) is at least linked to the
inability of ZIKV to antagonize mouse IFN responses. Interest-
ingly, type III IFN (IFNl) has been shown to protect barrier cells
of the human placenta called trophoblasts from ZIKV infection
(Bayer et al., 2016). Type III IFN utilizes different cell-surface re-
ceptors than type I IFN, but utilizes the same JAK-STAT ma-
chinery, including STAT2 (Kotenko et al., 2003; Sheppard
et al., 2003). Thus, it is highly likely that ZIKV can also evade
type III IFN signaling through STAT2 degradation by NS5, which
may contribute to virus crossing the placenta during pregnancy
to cause neuronal disease in the developing fetus. In addition,
the use of STAT2-deficient mice may be a useful model to
examine ZIKV pathogenesis in vivo.
Despite the similarities of NS5 function among ZIKV and
DENV, a number of interesting differences exist. DENV engages
the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR4 to degrade STAT2 (Morrison et al.,
2013). Degradation of STAT2 is dependent on proteolytic pro-
cessing of the DENV NS5 N terminus in the context of the viral
polyprotein (Ashour et al., 2009), although binding of STAT2 is in-
dependent of this processing (Mazzon et al., 2009). ZIKV NS5 did
not require an authentic N terminus, as would be generated in the
context of the viral polyprotein to degrade STAT2. This was
consistent with the observation that ZIKV did not utilize UBR4
in STAT2 degradation, since UBR4 appears to function specif-
ically in the degradation of proteins containing destabilizing
N termini or N-degrons (Tasaki et al., 2005).
The function of ZIKV NS5 as an IFN antagonist is likely to play
an important role in the emergence and pathogenesis of ZIKV in
humans. In fact, we have shown that NS5 mutants of WNV, YFV,
and TBEV that are unable to inhibit type I IFN signaling are atten-
uated in tissue culture or mice (Laurent-Rolle et al., 2010, 2014;
Lubick et al., 2015). In any case, further mapping of ZIKV NS5
amino acids involved in IFN antagonism should allow the gener-
ation of mutant ZIKVs that are attenuated due to their inability to
prevent IFN signaling. Such recombinant viruses could still be
grown in IFN-deficient cell lines, such as Vero cells, and used
as live-attenuated vaccines if proven safe and immunogenic.
Moreover, further elucidation of the mechanism and host pro-
teins required for STAT2-mediated degradation by ZIKV might
unravel targets for potential therapeutic intervention to treat
ZIKV infections.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
For reporter assays, 293T cells were co-transfected with the NS5-HA plas-
mids, the IFN-inducible firefly luciferase reporter (ISG54 promoter), and a
plasmid constitutively expressing the renilla luciferase protein. Twenty-four
hours post-transfection, cells were treated with 1,000 U of universal IFN
(PBL) and analyzed for reporter activity 12 hr post-treatment. Average firefly
luciferase values were normalized to average renilla luciferase values. Empty
vector treated with IFN was set to 100% reporter activity; each sample was
standardized to this value. For cloning NS5 of UG ZIKV, Vero cells were
infected with MR766 ZIKV strain (ATCC VR-84), total RNA was isolated
using
trizol,
and
cDNA
was
RT-PCR
amplified
using
gene-specific
primers and cloned into pCAGGS-COOH-HA expression vector. Upon
sequencing, it corresponded to GenBank: HQ234498. USUV NS5 was cloned
from viral RNA. For ZIKV RNA quantification, total RNA was isolated from virus-
infected cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). In total, 40 ng of total RNA was
used with ZIKV-specific primers (50-TTGGTCATGATACTGCTGATTGC-30 and
50-CCYTCCACRAAGTCYCTATTGC-30) and probe (50-6FAM-CGGCATACA
GYATCAGGTGCATWGGAG-MGBNFQ-30) for qRT-PCR (ThermoFisher) (Lan-
ciotti et al., 2008). For ISG mRNA quantification, we used a previously
described protocol (Rajsbaum et al., 2014). IP assays were conducted in
293T cells transfected with the indicated plasmids, and 24 hr post-transfec-
tion, cells were treated with type I IFN for 45 min, or mock treated (or left
untreated for the UBR4 and mouse STAT2 co-IPs), followed by IP. Lysates
were collected (sonication was performed on UBR4 IP lysates due to the mem-
brane-bound nature of UBR4) and centrifuged to obtain whole-cell extract,
and the remaining lysate was incubated with anti-HA beads (Sigma). HA beads
were washed, and bound protein was eluted by boiling the beads in SDS
buffer. SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis was performed on the
IP and whole-cell extracts with the indicated antibodies. Vero cells were
used in IFA and 293T cells in flow cytometry.
