In Brief
Comprehensive epitope mapping is
fundamental to understanding immune
responses. Bianchi et al. applied electron
microscopy to study polyclonal antibody
responses in HIV-Env-immunized rabbits.
Different antibody specificities were
identified and followed over time,
revealing the source of neutralization, a
distinct class of antibodies, and a highly
convergent structural evolution of the
neutralizing antibodies.

SUMMARY
Characterizing polyclonal antibody responses via
currently available methods is inherently complex
and
difficult.
Mapping
epitopes
in
an
immune
response is typically incomplete, which creates a
barrier to fully understanding the humoral response
to antigens and hinders rational vaccine design ef-
forts. Here, we describe a method of characterizing
polyclonal responses by using electron microscopy,
and we applied this method to the immunization of
rabbits with an HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein vaccine
candidate, BG505 SOSIP.664. We detected known
epitopes within the polyclonal sera and revealed
how antibody responses evolved during the prime-
boosting strategy to ultimately result in a neutralizing
antibody response. We uncovered previously un-
identified epitopes, including an epitope proximal
to one recognized by human broadly neutralizing
antibodies as well as potentially distracting non-
neutralizing epitopes. Our method provides an effi-
cient and semiquantitative map of epitopes that are
targeted in a polyclonal antibody response and
should be of widespread utility in vaccine and infec-
tion studies.
INTRODUCTION
Classically, vaccines are composed of killed or attenuated path-
ogens or protein subunits derived from the pathogen surface.
Although most successful vaccines are based on these ap-
proaches, highly antigenically variable pathogens, such as HIV,
and pathogens that circulate in the population as a large number
of serotypes have proven less tractable. A different approach
based on isolating functional antibodies to the pathogen by
studying their interaction with their targets and then designing
vaccine candidates has been described (Burton, 2002, 2017;
McLellan et al., 2013; Rappuoli and De Gregorio, 2016; Walker
et al., 2009). For highly antigenically variable pathogens, broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), i.e., antibodies that can recog-
nize multiple antigenic variants thereof, can usually be isolated
only from a small subset of infected patients (McCoy and
McKnight, 2017). The target for HIV bnAbs is the metastable en-
velope (Env) antigen, which consists of the two glycoproteins
gp120 and gp41 arranged in a (gp120)3(gp41)3 trimeric assembly
and sits on the surface of the viral particle. Stabilization is
required for the generation of a recombinant molecule (SOSIP)
that mimics the native trimer on the virus, and these recombinant
trimers bind bnAbs and are antigenically native (Binley et al.,
2000; Sanders et al., 2002, 2013). Although some inferred germ-
line versions of bnAbs are able to recognize the native Env trimer
(Andrabi et al., 2015), the inferred germline versions of many
other bnAbs typically fail to recognize both the recombinant tri-
mers and the corresponding Env glycoprotein on the virus. How-
ever, engineered proteins have been designed to stimulate the
precursor B cells of bnAbs (Briney et al., 2016; Escolano et al.,
2016; Jardine et al., 2015; Medina-Ramı
´rez et al., 2017; Sok
et al., 2016; Steichen et al., 2016) and help advance structure-
guided vaccine development against HIV according to the use
of sequential immunogens (Escolano et al., 2016).
Although the first immunization experiments using native re-
combinant Env trimers (de Taeye et al., 2015; Pauthner et al.,
2017; Sanders et al., 2015; Sok et al., 2017; Torrents de la
Pen
˜ a et al., 2017; Voss et al., 2017) and germline-targeting im-
munogens (Dosenovic et al., 2015; Jardine et al., 2015, 2016;

 Sok et al., 2016; Steichen et al., 2016) in diverse animal models
looked promising and were able to elicit tier 2 autologous
neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) (Escolano et al., 2016), one of
the rate-limiting steps in the iterative vaccine-development
approach is in the analysis of the polyclonal immune response
elicited by immunization. Serum neutralization assays and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are typically
used as relatively rapid readouts of the epitopes recognized by
elicited antibodies but are restricted to previously characterized
epitopes. Gaining a more detailed picture requires the genera-
tion of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Escolano et al., 2017;
McCoy and Burton, 2017; McCoy et al., 2016; Sok et al., 2017)
and determination of their structures in complex with immuno-
gens. This process is time consuming and limited to a relatively
small number of samples. Such analyses typically focus on anti-
bodies with a biological function (e.g., neutralization) and often
leave the remainder of the humoral immune response less well
investigated. Given the high cost and labor involved, unsuccess-
ful outcomes of vaccination experiments are hardly ever
analyzed in detail, and the reasons that a given immunogen
might fail to generate a neutralizing response can remain un-
known. More recent efforts to use deep sequencing of the
B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire of responding B cells have
considerable limitations because, in most cases, the heavy-
light-chain pairing is lost (as reviewed in McCoy and Burton,
2017). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses can be
used to study responses but require a considerable amount of
pre-existing knowledge to interpret the sequencing data; unless
characteristic features of bnAb sequences are known or a
comprehensive reference database of previously isolated and
sequenced pathogen-specific B cell clones or mAbs is available,
these analyses rely on identifying changes between the fre-
quencies of V region clonotypes or families and those of the
pre-immune state. Approaches that couple NGS data with tan-
dem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses of affinity-purified
antibodies (Boutz et al., 2014; Lavinder et al., 2014; Reddy
et al., 2010; Wine et al., 2013, 2015) have enabled the identifica-
tion of BCR sequences that are antigen specific without prior
knowledge of their genetic signatures. These approaches have
brought more comprehensive insights into B cell responses;
however, they cannot provide direct information about the
epitope recognized unless the sequenced BCR sequences are
synthesized and expressed as antibodies for validation and gain-
ing insight into their specificity.
Immunization of rabbits with HIV trimer BG505 SOSIP.664 has
previously been used for determining the immunogenicity of re-
combinant, native-like Env trimers (de Taeye et al., 2015; Klasse
et al., 2016; McCoy et al., 2016; Sanders et al., 2015). These prior
studies employed intramuscular prime immunization with 30 mg
of BG505 SOSIP.664 with Iscomatrix adjuvant at day 0 and
then booster immunization using the same formulation at weeks
4 and 24. BG505 SOSIP.664 immunization was found to induce
autologous tier 2 nAb titers. Neutralizing mAbs 10A, 11A, and
11B isolated from BG505-SOSIP.664-immunized rabbits led to
the definition of a highly immunogenic glycan hole (GH) present
on the surface of the BG505 Env in the vicinity of S241 (Klasse
et al., 2016, 2018; McCoy et al., 2016). Antibodies specific to
this particular epitope were identified as the primary source of
neutralization. Negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM) illus-
trated that the antibodies approach the Env surface from the
membrane-proximal side of the trimer (McCoy et al., 2016). Be-
sides this class of tier 2 nAb, two tier 1 nAbs were identified—
10B, which recognized the V3 loop, and 10C, which competed
with CD4-binding-site bnAbs on gp120—but both bound poorly
to Env trimers. Lastly, 12A-like antibodies that displayed weak
autologous neutralizing activity but bound to a different epitope
than 10A, 11A, and 11B were identified. 12A-mediated neutrali-
zation was impaired in the presence of a glycan at position N611.
nsEM revealed that mAb 12A bound to an epitope in the vicinity
of the PGT151 epitope but at a more canonical bnAb angle of
approach than that of 10A, 11A and 11B. These studies offer
information about the diversity present in the humoral immune
responses, including non-neutralizing epitopes that could poten-
tially be a distraction from eliciting nAb responses. Here, we
describe a complementary approach that, compared with isola-
tion of mAbs, elucidates a more complex landscape of the anti-
body response within polyclonal sera, including the genesis and
evolution of antibody responses targeting different epitopes on
Env. These data can be rapidly generated, i.e., within a week
of blood collection, and help inform the iterative, structure-based
vaccine design process.
RESULTS
Immunization with BG505 SOSIP.664 Elicited Different
nAb Titers in Rabbits
For the purposes of the current investigation, we analyzed sera
from four BG505-SOSIP.664-immunized rabbits (3417, 3418,
3419, and 3420) that had been extensively characterized in a
previous study (McCoy et al., 2016). Rabbits were immunized
four times with BG505 SOSIP.664 and bled 2 weeks after each
immunization (Figure 1A). Sera obtained are referred to as PI,
PP, PB1, PB2, and PB3 for pre-immunization, post-prime,
post-boost 1, post-boost 2, and post-boost 3, respectively.

 demonstrated that the antibody responses were comparable to
those previously published (de Taeye et al., 2015; Klasse et al.,
2016; Sanders et al., 2015). As in previous studies, only low titers
of binding antibodies were induced after the prime (Figures S1A
and S1E). However, the first booster immunization drastically
increased these binding titers to their nearly maximum levels,
such that subsequent immunizations afforded little further
improvement. No autologous nAbs were induced by the priming
immunization, and neither rabbit 3418 nor 3419 developed nAb
titers above the detection level during the entire course of the im-
munizations (Figure S1B; McCoy et al., 2016). In the other two
rabbits after the first boost, neutralizing titers substantially
increased in rabbit 3417, but not in rabbit 3420, where neutral-
izing titers were observed only after the second boost. The third
boost did not improve the already high nAb titers in rabbit 3417
and even resulted in slightly lower titers than observed in PB2
(Figure S1B). In the slower responding rabbit 3420, the third
boost improved its neutralizing titers to around half the titer
observed in rabbit 3417 (i.e., IC50 63 versus 32 mg/mL). These
data demonstrate that each animal responded somewhat differ-
ently in terms of nAb titers to the BG505 SOSIP.664 candidate
vaccine.
Biochemical Characterization of Polyclonal Antibody
Serum and Generated Fabs
To determine the epitopes of the elicited antibodies without gen-
eration of mAbs, we devised a strategy to directly image immune
complexes formed between the immunogen (BG505 SOSIP.664)
and the induced serum antibodies by nsEM. Serum immuno-
globulin G (IgG) was purified with a mixture of protein A and G af-
finity matrix and processed into fragments antigen binding (Fabs)
with immobilized papain to prevent antigen crosslinking and ag-
gregation due to the bivalent nature of IgG. Before nsEM, Fabs
were subjected to biochemical quality control: purity and the
correct size of the Fabs were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and
size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Figures S1G and S1H).
To investigate the effect of the IgG digestion protocol on the bio-
logical activity of antibodies, we determined neutralizing titers
before and after IgG digestion. As depicted in Figure S1C, a
considerable reduction of neutralizing activity was observed for
the polyclonal serum when it was digested into Fabs. However,
given that mAbs 10A and 11A also displayed a comparable loss
in neutralizing activity when they were recombinantly expressed
as Fabs, we concluded that proteolytic digestion did not have
gross detrimental effects. Thus, we derived a method to reliably
digest serum IgG into Fabs for further analysis.
Polyclonal Image Analysis of Env-Fab Complexes by
nsEM Reveals Different Classes of Antibodies
Given the limited amount of serum available and the low titers af-
ter the prime vaccination (Figures S1A and S1E), post-prime
complexes could be identified only for rabbit 3417. Complexes
were purified via SEC and deposited onto electron microscopy
(EM) grids and imaged. For each sample, we collected 10,000–
50,000 individual particle images that were submitted to refer-
ence-free 2D classification (Figure 1B). After priming, the early
antibody response was completely dominated by bottom of
trimer (BOT)-binding antibodies. These antibodies bound to a
neo-epitope that is unique to the soluble Env trimer and does
not exist on membrane-embedded Env. Hence, for the most
part, these corresponded to non-neutralizing responses. After
the first booster immunization, antibodies to the GH epitope
(McCoy et al., 2016) were also identified in rabbits that devel-
oped neutralizing titers (3417 and 3420), but not in rabbits that
did not mount neutralizing titers (3418 and 3419).
We performed 3D refinement that yielded 3D classes repre-
senting the most predominant immune complexes for all rabbits.
When all reconstructions were overlaid and compared with pro-
totypic mAbs, one BOT, one cleft-of-trimer (COT), and two
GH-specific binding classes could be defined (Figure 1C). BOT
antibodies recognized an epitope similar to the previously
described bottom-binding mAb 12N (Kulp et al., 2017; McCoy
et al., 2016) and were therefore binned into one class, although
some variation in epitope and angle of approach was detectable
in the 3D reconstructions (Figure 1C, box). Glycan hole 1 (GH1)
class antibodies almost perfectly overlapped 10A, a prototypic
GH-specific neutralizing mAb described earlier (McCoy et al.,
2016). Relative to 10A, the second GH-specific class, GH2,
bound in an orientation rotated approximately 90� along its lon-
gitudinal axis to the same region. COT class antibodies, i.e., an-
tibodies that bound between the trimer blades, were found only
in less than 1% of 2D class averages from rabbits’ 3417 and
3420 bleeds after PB1 (Figure S2A) and not in the 3D classes,
indicating that these antibodies were not very abundant in com-
parison with the others. COT class antibodies were found to bind
a membrane-proximal region located just below fusion-peptide-
specific antibodies, such as PGT151. This region, typically
referred to as the gp120-gp41 interface, is actually a cluster of
overlapping epitopes that include COT, PGT151, and the previ-
ously described rabbit mAb 12A, which preferentially neutralizes
viruses lacking the glycan at N611 (Figure S2B).
We hypothesized that the relative dominance of the BOT and
GH antibodies prevented detection of COT antibodies in the
3D classes. Hence, our original BG505 SOSIP.664 probe was
not sensitive enough to completely characterize the polyclonal
response. When complexes were instead formed with Env tri-
mers in which either the GH alone (Klasse et al., 2016; McCoy
et al., 2016) or the GH and the bottom were modified to diminish
antibody binding (Kulp et al., 2017), the frequency of detection of
COT antibodies increased considerably in 2D class averages
(Figure S2C), and 3D models could be generated from such im-
mune complexes (Figures 1C and S2B). In contrast to human
bnAb PGT151, which binds with a stoichiometry of 2 Fabs per
trimer (Blattner et al., 2014), COT class antibodies bound with
up to three molecules per trimer (Figure S2C, box). GH- and
COT-specific antibodies could be concomitantly bound to the
same cleft of the trimer (Figure 1B, box), indicating that there
was no direct steric hindrance between these two classes.
BOT-specific antibodies were the first and only class of anti-
bodies detectable after priming (Figure 1B) and remained detect-
able throughout the course of immunization in all rabbits
(Figure 2). In the two rabbits that developed autologous neutral-
izing titers (3417 and 3420), the differences in the kinetics of the
development of neutralizing titers was also reflected in the clas-
ses of antibodies found. In the rapidly responding rabbit 3417,
the appearance of GH1 antibodies coincided with the develop-
ment of neutralizing titers at PB1, and GH1 remained the
only GH-binding class of antibodies. In contrast, in the slowly

 responding rabbit 3420, GH2 but not GH1 class antibodies were
detectable at PB1 (Figure 2). The fact that no neutralizing activity
was found in this rabbit at PB1 (Figure S1B) suggests that the
GH2 class of antibodies did not confer substantial neutralization
activity against BG505. However, when autologous neutralizing
activity became detectable in rabbit 3420 after PB2, GH1 anti-
bodies became readily identifiable in the 3D reconstructions
(Figure 2). These data suggest that GH1 class antibodies, like
mAb 10A, were predominantly responsible for the neutralizing
activity in these BG505-SOSIP.664-immunized rabbits.
To independently confirm the findings made by nsEM, we
used SEC to compare Fab occupancy in complexes formed
with wild-type (WT) BG505 SOSIP.664 and a variant thereof, in
which mutations S241N and P291S introduced N-linked glyco-
sylation sites at positions N241 and N289, respectively. The
241 or 241 and 289 mutations have previously been shown to
knock out the nAb response (Klasse et al., 2016, 2018; McCoy
et al., 2016), consistent with structural observations (McCoy
et al., 2016). First, to determine the Fab occupancy in immune
complexes, we digested a panel of well-characterized mAbs
into Fabs and estimated their molecular weight by measuring
retention volume by SEC. Most free Fabs eluted at around
18 mL from a Sepharose 6 Increase 10/300 column (Figure 3A).
When
immune
complexes
were
formed
between
BG505
SOSIP.664 and saturating concentrations of a single Fab speci-
ficity, their previously determined stoichiometry of binding (Blatt-
ner et al., 2014; Julien et al., 2013a, 2013b; Lee et al., 2015; Liu
et al., 2017; Stewart-Jones et al., 2016) was reflected in their
elution volume (Figure 3B). However, complexes containing
35O22 or PGT151 Fabs were retained considerably longer than
expected and were therefore excluded from further analysis.
Finally, a large number of distinct immune complexes were
formed and combined mAbs of different binding stoichiometries,
and their elution volumes were determined (Table S1). These
data enabled us to calculate a standard curve for estimating
Fab occupancy directly from the elution volume of an immune
complex (Figure 3C). To correct for the different amounts and af-
finities of BG505-specific antibodies present in the Fab prepara-
tion from the different bleeds, we determined EC50 values by
ELISA (Figures 4A and S1A) and performed standardized im-
mune-complex formation by overnight incubation of 10–25 mg
of BG505 SOSIP.664, or variants thereof, with 2,0003 the EC50
concentration of Fabs determined by ELISA. We subjected com-
plexes to SEC to remove non-bound Fabs and estimate the
average stoichiometry of Fabs bound to the immunogen. After
SEC elution, complexes were subjected to single-particle nsEM.
To assess the occupancy, we formed immune complexes with
Fab concentrations standardized to 2,0003 the EC50 of 3417
PB1 by using BG505 SOSIP.664 and the GH-restored trimer
(Figure 4). In rabbits that developed a neutralizing response,
the fraction of N241- or N289-sensitive antibodies (i.e., GH spe-
cific) increased with each booster immunization (3417 and 3420;
Figure 4B). By contrast, in rabbits that failed to mount nAbs (3418
and 3419), the antibody response was almost completely inde-
pendent of the presence or absence of glycosylation at position
241 or 289, consistent with our nsEM findings.
To compare the overall affinities of the bound antibody clas-
ses, we used titrated Fabs from rabbit 3417 PB1 to form com-
plexes with a fixed amount of WT BG505 SOSIP.664 or GH-filled
trimer (Figure 4C) in non-saturating conditions. The fraction of
GH-indifferent antibodies in the immune complexes decreased
with each antibody dilution, indicating that these were of weaker
affinity. Again, nsEM imaging of these complexes was consistent
with these findings (2D classes for rabbit 3417 PB2 are shown as
an example in Figure S2D).
To assess whether the lack of detection of V3 supersite or
apex-specific antibodies was due to perturbation of these epi-
topes by binding of the predominant BOT or GH antibodies,
we formed immune complexes by using a mixture of the BOT
mAb 12N with either PG9 or PGT121 and found that binding of
12N did not affect binding of the other two mAbs in nsEM. Like-
wise, mixing 3417 PB1 Fabs containing BOT, COT, and GH an-
tibodies with either PG9 or PGT121 did not prevent binding or
detection of either mAb, as demonstrated by nsEM (Figure S1D).
Finally, to determine whether the sera contained antibodies able
to bind the V3 loop in the context of a well-ordered intact trimer,
we first performed competition ELISA by using peptides corre-
sponding to the V3 loop of BG505 SOSIP.664. Because no
competition was detectable (Figure S1E), we concluded that
only a minor fraction of Env trimer-specific antibodies was in
fact against the V3 loop. We therefore enriched for V3-specific
antibodies by affinity chromatography and obtained �1 mg of
V3-specific Fabs per milligram of total Fabs. A fraction of these
V3-specific Fabs were indeed able to bind immobilized BG505
SOSIP.664 in ELISA (Figure S1F) but were not observed in
nsEM, most likely as a result of low affinity and fast off rates. In
total, using nsEM and image analysis, we have discovered a
class of antibodies that have not been described so far (COT),
identified classes of antibodies that correlate with neutralization
(GH1), and been able to expand our knowledge of the immuno-
dominance of the BOT epitopes.
3D CryoEM Studies of Env-Fab Complexes Reveal High-
Resolution Information about Targeted Epitopes
Although nsEM and 2D classification were sufficient to identify
the
predominant
epitope
specificities
elicited
by
BG505
SOSIP.664 immunization, we also attempted cryo-electron mi-
croscopy (cryoEM) and 3D reconstruction of complexes from
one of the serum samples (rabbit 3417, PB1) for a more detailed
analysis. We collected a dataset of �162,000 complexes and
analyzed them by 2D classification. The results were consistent
with the nsEM data, although as expected, the cryoEM data had

 a much great diversity of views of the complexes as a result of
the free tumbling of particles in solution before rapid freezing,
as well as a higher number of imaged particles. This relatively
isotropic distribution of complexes is essential for robust 3D
classification and reconstruction. We first calculated a single
3D reconstruction of the entire dataset by using CryoSparc (Pun-
jani et al., 2017) (Figure S3), which included a heterogeneous
mixture of Env-Fab complexes, resulting in a �4.7 A
˚ resolution
density map. The BG505 SOSIP.664 portion of this ‘‘global
average’’ map was very well resolved, and further 3D classifica-
tion and refinement resulted in four reconstructions that were
resolved to sub-nanometer resolution. Previously solved atomic
structures of the trimer could be fitted well into these maps, two
of which are displayed in Figure 5A.
The main conclusion from the high-resolution analyses in
CryoSparc is the high-quality density in the maps that corre-
sponded to the GH1 antibodies, suggesting a structurally homo-
geneous mAb population. Further, when the high-resolution
structure of Fab 10A, which we solved by X-ray crystallography
(Figure 5B and Table S2; PDB 6CJK), was fit into the density
map, it was very similar, particularly with regard to the main point
of contact, the long LCDR3 loop (Figure 5C). Notably, in HCDR1,
HCDR2, and HCDR3, the loop lengths of the polyclonal average
appeared to differ from that of 10A, consistent with some variation
in loop length and heavy-chain usage between these and 10A.
These data suggest that the rabbits might have biased light-chain
usage that preferentially targeted the GH epitope, whereby
LCDR3 made the majority of contacts with Env in a lysine-rich
loop directly above the S241 residue (Figure 5D). Moreover, con-
necting densities between the glycan at position N88 and the light
chain suggest additional direct interactions (Figure 5C). Although
the epitope-paratope regions were well resolved, for the C-termi-
nal end of constant region 1, the 10A fit became poorer and
densities become more diffuse, probably as a result of a slight
difference in the positions of their C termini. Whether these differ-
ences reflected actual differences in the angle of approach of indi-
vidual antibody species present in the polyclonal sera or whether
this was due to the inherent flexibility of the hinge region of the
Fabs could not be determined from the available data. In our pre-
vious study, we showed at low resolution that nAbs isolated from
different rabbits targeted the GH in very similar manners (McCoy
et al., 2016). Here, in our high-resolution cryoEM analysis, the
close resemblance between the averaged polyclonal densities
and the structure of mAb 10A, isolated from a different rabbit,
again suggests highly convergent responses, even at the molecu-
lar level. Although we can only speculate at this point whether this
observation was due to the dominance of a single clonotype or
whether it was the result of convergent evolution of multiple clono-
types, the decreasing resolution oftheGH1density map inregions
distal to the paratope indicates that the individual Fabs bound at
varying angles of approach.
In the CryoSparc refinement, the complexes were not
completely classified, and in all reconstructions, there was
evidence of partial occupancy of one or more Fabs. The den-
sities corresponding to Fabs varied between epitopes and pro-
vided a rough approximation of stoichiometry: densities that
comprised the intact molecular volume of Fabs were consistent
with high stoichiometry, whereas incomplete Fab volumes were
consistent with lower stoichiometry but might also have reflected
to some degree a higher flexibility or diversity of the bound Fabs
(cf. BOT densities in Figure 5A). We therefore devised a strategy
to estimate the occupancy on the basis of the Fab density
apparent at different map thresholds. Using RELION (Scheres,
2012) on the same dataset, we undertook an exhaustive 3D clas-
sification approach to determine as many 3D reconstructions as
possible given the size of the dataset (Figure S3). On the basis of
this approach, we computationally isolated 20 complexes at
modest resolution, which enabled us to observe the diversity
of epitopes targeted and estimate the response to each epitope.
Our 3D classification scheme allowed us to semiquantitatively
report the total occupancy of the two primary antibody re-
sponses, BOT and GH (Figure 6). At the Fab concentration
used, all immune complexes contained at least one GH1 Fab.
The majority of 3D models displayed partial occupancy at one
or two of the potential GH and BOT binding sites, and no other
pattern was discernable. Quantification of 3D classes provided

 semiquantitative information for recognition of the different anti-
body classes. Moreover, by adding cryoEM analyses to nsEM,
we gained structural information about the GH1 epitope recogni-
tion and demonstrated a structurally highly convergent evolution
of these GH1-specific antibodies in rabbits.
DISCUSSION
Our polyclonal imaging approach using nsEM can provide
snapshots of the antibody response at any given time after
vaccination and has enabled us to extensively and semiquanti-
tatively map the polyclonal immune response to a protein or
glycoprotein immunogen and thereby shed light on the epitopic
diversity and maturation of antibody responses in vaccinated
animals. Our approach could equally be applied to follow the
course of a response during natural infection. Using this
approach, we confirmed GH1 class antibodies as major source
of neutralization in BG505-SOSIP.664-immunized rabbits. In
addition, we were able to discern differences in the kinetics
by which the nAb responses are mounted and demonstrated
that the lack of neutralization in this particular case was due
to a failure to mount GH-specific antibodies. Moreover, we
identified two additional classes of antibodies, namely GH2
and COT, that have not been previously described. The fact
that GH2 antibodies can be found in samples with no neutral-
izing activity suggests that this class of antibody is non-neutral-
izing. COT antibodies could only be found in the neutralizing
rabbits 3417 and 3420, but the absence of neutralization of a
BG505 N332 virus with restored glycans at positions N241
(McCoy et al., 2016) and N289 indicates that this class of anti-
bodies is either non-neutralizing or too rare to provide neutral-
ization at least in these specific rabbits. Obtaining a definitive
answer about their biological activity, however, will require
additional experiments with mAbs from these classes. Besides
identifying the predominantly elicited antibody classes and the
most likely source for autologous neutralization, our rapid nsEM
approach also provided approximate information about the af-
finity of the antibody classes detected. For example, we
showed that early BOT class antibodies were inferior to GH-
binding antibodies in that they disappeared from immune

 complexes at higher Fab concentrations than GH class anti-
bodies, and this property did not change throughout the course
of the immunization. Overall, our findings were consistent with
and extend those of previously published rabbit-immunization
studies (de Taeye et al., 2015; Klasse et al., 2016; McCoy
et al., 2016; Sanders et al., 2015; Torrents de la Pen
˜ a et al.,
2017, 2018). Moreover, we also corroborated our nsEM data
with occupancy data determined by a different, biochemical
method. Successful epitope mapping experiments using sera
from mice immunized with influenza A virus hemagglutinin
and ongoing studies investigating the humoral response to
BG505 SOSIPs in non-human primates (NHPs) (both will be
published elsewhere) further indicate that this method is not
restricted to rabbit immunoglobulin but can be applied to other
species and other antigens as well.
The addition of cryoEM to our methodology enabled us to
obtain sub-nanometer-resolution 3D reconstructions that pro-
vided us with additional insights into the molecular recognition
of the GH1 epitope on the immunogen. We detected a high de-
gree of structural conservation in these antibodies, in particular
for LCDR3. Our data, however, do not allow us to differentiate
whether this was due to the dominance of a single antibody clo-
notype or whether different antibody clones converged to struc-
turally similar paratopes.
Although the images might not recapitulate the full diversity of
antigen-specific antibodies in the serum, they most likely repre-
sent a snapshot of the predominantly recognized epitopes.
Thus, our workflow and a small set of SOSIP trimer constructs
allow the rapid derivation of information for assessing ongoing
immunization experiments and provide data for immunogen
redesign. For example, the early dominant response to the trimer
base neo-epitope is concerning because the activation and pro-
liferation of BOT-specific B cells might restrict resources for
B cells recognizing more productive and neutralizing epitopes.
Furthermore, nearly all of the antibodies bind at an upward angle
relative to the trimer. This contrasts with all known bnAbs that
bind at a downward or parallel angle of approach, which reflects
the fact that the soluble BG505 SOSIP.664 can also be presented
to rabbit B cells in an ‘‘upside-down fashion’’ relative to virion pre-
sentation. Therefore, particulate display of BG505 SOSIP.664 tri-
mers could prevent presentation of the base and lower epitopes
in Env and improve immune responses such that they more
closely resemble nAb and, perhaps even to some extent, bnAb
responses. Overall, the rabbit responses to BG505 SOSIP.664
trimers appear quite narrow and are limited to a few epitopes.
In our images, we did not observe V3 loop, non-neutralizing
Abs, which have been reported in ELISA binding assays (McCoy
et al., 2016; Pauthner et al., 2017; Sanders et al., 2015). Because

 we formed complexes in solution by using fully native Env trimer
proteins that do not expose the V3 loop or other epitopes that
can become exposed after immobilization, this is perhaps not sur-
prising. Our approach therefore preferentially detects the most
relevant responses to the surface of pre-fusion conformation of
Env. Although there is some indication from the COT class of an-
tibodies that it might be more challenging for our method to detect
less frequent antibody classes, they still did not go undetected.
Additional complexes formed with epitope-knockout variants of
the immunogen or the use of pre-adsorbed Fab preparations
could also aid in the detection of rarer specificities.
In line with previous findings, our study also showed that the
appearance and maintenance of epitope specificities can vary.
The EM imaging provides predictive models that accurately
anticipate neutralization on the basis of the epitopes targeted,
at least in rabbits. Preliminary analysis using conventional
epitope mapping of NHPs immunized with BG505 SOSIP.664
(Pauthner et al., 2017) has found a more diverse response than
in rabbits. Our polyclonal epitope-mapping approach could be
used for a more comprehensive analysis of such NHP samples
as well as human responses to vaccines, which in turn would
inform prime-boosting vaccination strategies. For example,
direct visualization by nsEM could be used for rapidly deciding
whether a single prime is sufficient before the introduction of a
heterologous boost or whether a second prime should be given
if a desired antibody specificity cannot be observed after the first
immunization. Further, one can determine whether the elicited
polyclonal antibodies directly (via epitope overlap) or indirectly
(through steric blockade) interfere with an intended epitope-
focused response. Finally, comparison of imaging from human
and animal model studies will reveal the similarities and differ-
ences in responses between humans and animal models and
help determine the relative value of different preclinical studies
and the most appropriate animal model for iterative vaccine
design,

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Rabbits
The samples used in this study derived from the previously described immunization of animals 3417, 3418, 3419, and 3420 (McCoy
et al., 2016). Briefly, 15-week-old female New Zealand white rabbits were immunized twice with liposomes embedded with BG505
SOSIP.664 v3.2, and then three soluble BG505 SOSIP.664 v3.2 protein boosts. The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) Institutional
Animal Care and Use Office and the Committee (IACUC) approved all experimental procedures involving rabbits 3409–3420. All pro-
cedures were performed by TSRI Department of Animal Resources (DAR) staff in accordance with IACUC protocol 14-0002.
CELL LINES
TZM-bl cells (human female HeLa-derived cancer cell line) were maintained at 37�C and 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco’s Modi-
fied Eagle Medium (DMEM, Corning) containing 1X Penicillin-Streptomycin (Corning), 2 mM L-Glutamine (Corning), and 10% heat-
inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Omega Scientific).
METHOD DETAILS
Anti-HIV-1 Env Monoclonal Antibodies
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were expressed by co-transfection of HEK293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, 156 mg heavy
chain and 156 mg light chain-expressing plasmids were mixed in 25 mL Opti-Minimum Essential Media (MEM), and then added to
25 mL Opti-MEM containing 937.5 mg Polyethylenimine (PEI) MAX 40,000 (Polysciences). After 30 min at room temperature (RT),
the DNA/PEI mix was added to 109 HEK293F cells in 1 L FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and further
incubated for 6–7 days at 37�C, 8% CO2, 80% humidity, 135 rpm. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and filtered through
0.22 mm Rapid-Flow filter units (Nalgene). Filtered supernatant was applied to a column containing a 1 mL packed Protein G Sephar-
ose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The column was washed with 20 column-volumes
of PBS, and mAb eluted with 0.1 M glycine pH 2.5 in a 1:10 volume of 1 M Tris-HCL pH 8 solution. Antibodies were concentrated and
buffer-exchanged into PBS using 10,000 MWCO Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (EMD Millipore) over three rounds of spinning.
His-tagged Fab 10A was recombinantly expressed and secreted as a soluble protein in HEK293F cells. The supernatant was
concentrated and loaded onto a Ni-NTA affinity column, and the Fabs were eluted using an imidazole gradient. Next, Fabs were
loaded onto a cation exchange column (monoS) and eluted using a salt gradient. Fractions containing pure Fab were pooled, concen-
trated, and buffer exchanged into tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5).
Soluble Env Protein Production
BG505 SOSIP.664 v3.2 (Sanders et al., 2015), BG505 SOSIP.664 v4.1 (de Taeye et al., 2015), BG505 SOSIP.664 v5.2 (Torrents de la
Pen
˜ a et al., 2017), BG505 SOSIP.664 v5.2 with glycans at positions N241 and N289 (will be published elsewhere), or BG505 MD39
CPG9 (Kulp et al., 2017) (with or without C-terminal Avi or Strep tag to enable biotinylation and purification) were used in this study.
Compared to BG505 SOSIP.664 v3.2, BG505 SOSIP.664 v4.1 contains a A316W mutation, which improves hydrophobic packing
and stability of the V3 loop, and an E64K mutation, which reduces spontaneous sampling of the CD4-bound ‘‘open’’ trimer confor-
mation. The BG505 SOSIP.664 v5.2 is similar to the v4.1 design, with the addition of a second disulfide bond between gp120 (A73C)
and gp41 (A561C) to further increase trimer stability. BG505 MD39 CPG9 contains the MD39 stabilizing mutations (Steichen et al.,
2016), glycans at positions N80, N241, N289, N630, and a glycosylated loop connecting gp120 and gp41 that block binding to the
bottom of the trimer. BG505 trimers were expressed in HEK293F cells by transient co-transfection with furin (except for BG505 MD39
CPG9, which is cleavage independent), and then purified using methods described elsewhere (Pugach et al., 2015), with either 2G12
or PGT145-affinity columns followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Fractions corresponding to trimer were pooled and

 concentrated down to 1–2 mg/mL. Avi-tagged proteins were biotinylated after 2G12 or PGT145-affinity columns using the BirA
biotin-protein ligase standard reaction kit (Avidity) under the following conditions and reagents from the kit: 100 mL of Avi-tagged pro-
tein, 15 mL of 103 Biomix B, 15 mL of BIO200, 15 mL of 1 M Tris-HCL pH 8, 5 mL of BirA enzyme, incubated for 1 hr at 37�C. Excess
biotin and BirA enzyme was finally removed by SEC. All samples were sterile filtered prior to aliquoting and flash freezing. Structural
validation of trimers was performed by analysis of negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) 2D class averages. The proteins used for
immunizations had no His-tag.
Plasma or Serum IgG Purification
IgGs were purified from plasma or serum of immunized animals using protein A and/or G Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare), at a ratio of
1 mL packed resin for each mililiter of undiluted plasma or serum. Samples were diluted at least 4-fold in PBS, then incubated with
protein A/G resin for 5 hr at RT or overnight at 4�C. The resin was washed 3 times with 10 volumes PBS, and the IgGs eluted with 5–10
volumes of 0.1 M glycine pH 2.5 immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCL pH 8. Buffer was exchanged to PBS or TBS either by
dialysis or by centrifugation using 10 kDa cutoff membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or tubes (EMD Millipore), respectively.
Fab Preparation
Fabs were prepared for EM imaging. To make Fab, IgG were digested with papain-agarose resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 5 hr at
37�C using 50 ml settled resin/mg IgG in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM cysteine, pH 7.4. Fc and non-digested IgG
were removed by 1 hr incubation at RT with protein A Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare), using 0.2 mL packed resin/mg of initial IgG.
After protein A incubation, cysteine was removed from the flow-through containing the digested Fab by dialysis or by ultracentrifu-
gation using 10 kDa cutoff (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or tubes (EMD Millipore), respectively.
Fab Quality Control by SDS-PAGE and SEC
Fab size and homogeneity were assessed by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate - PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and SEC.
For SDS-PAGE, 5 mg protein/lane was loaded on a 4%–12% Bolt Bis-Tris Plus gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in reducing VS non-
reducing conditions, and run at 200 V in 3-Morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer. Bands were visualized with Coomassie
staining (Expedeon), and the size of the fragments evaluated by running a protein standard ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For SEC,
50 mg protein was loaded on a Superdex 200 increase 10/300 column using a 100 mL loop, and run at 0.5 mL/min using an A
¨ kta Pure
system (GE Healthcare). Fab peaks were analyzed with the provided Unicorn 7.0.2 software. The size of the fragments was estimated
with the help of a linear regression calculated by running a mix of proteins with known molecular weight (BioRad) on the same column.
BG505 ELISA
High-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with neutravidin (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) or a BG505-binding antibody (mostly human PG9, PGT145, or PGT121, or rabbit 10A or 12N) overnight at 4�C, then
blocked with 3% BSA for 2 hr at RT. Biotinylated or untagged BG505 SOSIP.664 was captured on the neutravidin/antibody plate for
2 hr at RT, before adding serial dilutions of Fab or F(ab’)2 for additional 2 hr at RT. Binding of BG505-specific antibodies was assessed
by Fab-specific secondary-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) after 1 hr incubation at RT. HRP
activity was measured by adding 3,30,5,50-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)-substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and blocking the reac-
tion with 2 N sulfuric acid after 3 min incubation. OD450 was finally measured using a BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader (Perkin Elmer),
and the effective concentration (EC), EC50 and EC90, calculated using Prism 7 software (GraphPad). Relative abundance of BG505-
specific antibodies was estimated by comparing the EC50s with those obtained from a total IgG ELISA. Competition with BG505
V3-peptide (TRPNNNTRKSIRIGPGQAFYATGDIIGDIRQAH, GenScript) was performed by pre-incubation of antibodies or plasmas
with 150 mg/mL V3-peptide at room temperature for 1 hr before incubation on BG505 SOSIP.664 coated ELISA plates.
V3-Peptide ELISA
High-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with neutravidin (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) overnight at 4�C, then blocked with 3% BSA for 2 hr at RT. Biotinylated BG505 V3-peptide (TRPNNNTRKSIRIGPG
QAFYATGDIIGDIRQAH, GenScript) was captured on the neutravidin plate for 2 hr at RT, before adding serial dilutions of Fab or
plasma for additional 2 hr at RT. Binding of BG505 V3-peptide specific antibodies was assessed by Fab-specific secondary-horse-
radish peroxidase (HRP) antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) after 1 hr incubation at RT. HRP activity was measured by adding
3,30,5,50-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)-substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and blocking the reaction with 2 N sulfuric acid after 3 min

EC50 and EC90, calculated using Prism 7 software (GraphPad). Competition with BG505 V3-peptide (TRPNNNTRKSIRIGPGQA
FYATGDIIGDIRQAH, GenScript) was performed by pre-incubation of antibodies or plasmas with 150 mg/mL V3-peptide at room tem-
perature for 1 hr before incubation on BG505 SOSIP.664 coated ELISA plates.
Neutralization Assays
Replication incompetent HIV pseudovirus was produced by co-transfecting env plasmids with an env-deficient backbone plasmid
(pSG3Denv) in HEK293T cells in a 1:2 ratio, using the X-tremeGENE 9 transfection reagent (Roche). Pseudovirus was harvested after
48–72 hr by sterile-filtration (0.22 mm) of cell culture supernatants and titrated on TZM-bl cells. Neutralization was then assessed by
e6
Immunity 49, 288–300.e1–e8, August 21, 2018
 TZM-bl assay: previously titrated pseudovirus were incubated with Fab for 1 hr at 37�C, and then transferred in a white 384-well plate
(Greiner Bio-One) together with an equal volume of TZM-bl cells (4,000/well) resuspended in complete DMEM + 20 mg/mL Diethy-
laminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran. After 48 hr at 37�C and 5% CO2, the supernatant was removed and the cells lysed with Glo lysis buffer
(Promega) for 5 min at RT. Luciferase activity was measured by the addition of Bright-Glo luciferase-substrate (Promega), and the
luminescence signal read using a BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader. Full IgG and F(ab’)2 were used as control, and uninfected cells
to correct for background.
Occupancy Standard Curve
Twelve-molar excess (for each mAb) of a single or combination of mAbs known to bind with different stoichiometries were incubated
with 10 mg BG505 trimers overnight at RT in 100 mL total volume. Complexes were then run on a Superose 6 increase 10/300 column
and A
¨ kta Pure system (GE Healthcare) and the different elution peaks used to calculate a stoichiometry standard curve using the
Prism 7 software (GraphPad).
Complexes for EM
10 mg BG505 trimers were incubated overnight at RT with 2000-fold EC50 excess of Fab in 100 mL total volume, and the complexes
were then purified on a Superose 6 increase 10/300 column and A
¨ kta Pure system (GE Healthcare) in TBS buffer. The fractions con-
taining the complexes were pooled in 10 kDa cutoff tubes (EMD Millipore) and concentrated down to 50 mL final volume.
X-Ray Crystallography
Fab 10A was crystallized from solutions containing 10 mg/mL Fab in TBS buffer. Crystals were grown using sitting drop vapor
diffusion with a well solution containing 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.26, 0.17 M ammonium acetate, 15% glycerol and 19%
PEG4000. Crystals were grown at 298 K and appeared within 3 days. Fab 10A crystals were cryoprotected by soaking in a well so-
lution supplemented with 30% glycerol. Diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) beamline 23ID-D. Data
collection and processing statistics are outlined in Table S2. Datasets were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL-2000
package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The structures were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER (McCoy et al.,
2007) with homology models for Fab 10A (SWISS-MODEL; Arnold et al., 2006; Biasini et al., 2014; Bordoli et al., 2009) as search
models and further refined using phenix.refine (Adams et al., 2010) combined with manual building cycles in Coot (Emsley et al.,
2010). Structure deposited: PDB: 6CJK.
Negative-Stain EM
SEC purified complexes were deposited at approximately 0.04 mg/mL onto carbon-coated copper grids and stained with 2% (w/v)
uranyl formate (Briganti and Mauro, 1979) for 30 s as previously described (Pugach et al., 2015). Grids were imaged at 120 KeV using
a Tecnai Spirit using Leginon (Suloway et al., 2005). Images were collected on a 4kx4k TemCam F416 detector and transferred into
the Appion database (Lander et al., 2009) for initial image processing. Particles were picked using DoG Picker (Voss et al., 2009) and
2D classes were generated using MSA/MRA (Ogura et al., 2003). Particles corresponding to Env-Fab complexes were selected and
further processed via 3D classification in Relion (Scheres, 2012) to separate out the unique complexes within the heterogeneous da-
taset before final refinement of each map. Figures were prepared using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004).
Cryo EM
The 3417 PB1 sample was concentrated to 5.6 mg/mL. Immediately before deposition onto a 1.2/1.3 200 Quantifoil grid (EMS) that
were glow discharged for 10 s, 3mL of the concentrated complex was mixed with 1 mL of 0.42 mM Dodecyl Maltoside (DDM, Ana-
trace). Addition of DDM promoted appearance of complexes into holes and improved angular sampling of individual complexes.
Grids were then blotted and plunged into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (FEI) to capture complexes in vitreous ice. Cryo grids
were transferred into a 200 KeV Talos Artica and images recorded on a 3710 3 3838 pixel Gatan K2 Summit detector using Leginon
(Suloway et al., 2005) at a defocus range of �1.5 mm to �2.5 mm. Images were transferred to the Appion (Lander et al., 2009) database
and particles were picked using DoG Picker (Voss et al., 2009) and placed into a stack. Initial 2D classification was conducted in
Relion and non-Env particles were removed, creating a clean stack of 161,639 particles that was then subjected to 3D classification.
The first round of 3D classification resulted in six reconstructions. Subsequent rounds of sequential 3D classification were conducted
as illustrated in Figure S3. 3D reconstructions with similar occupancy of bound Fabs were combined before final refinement. This
approach resulted in 20 unique 3D reconstructions that were then used to quantify the Fabs at each epitope.
The same cryo-particle stack was also subjected to image processing in CryoSparc (Punjani et al., 2017) that resulted in 4 sub-
nanometer resolution reconstructions (Figure S3). We also calculated a global average of all particles that was resolved to 4.71 A
˚
resolution.
Fab Occupancy Analysis
Within the 20 Relion cryoEM maps, there was still obvious sub-stoichiometric occupancy of Fabs at different epitopes. We derived a
method to approximate the occupancy of the Fabs at each site to get a better estimate of the total response per epitope. In the end,
each epitope was characterized as having full, moderate, low, or no occupancy using the following approach. Each reconstruction
was normalized to best match the trimer density of a 20 A
˚ resolution low pass filtered map of BG505 SOSIP.664. In every map, at
Immunity 49, 288–300.e1–e8, August 21, 2018

 these normalized thresholds, we saw at least one nicely resolved GH Fab. At this contour level, there were Fabs present at other
epitopes that only had partial density. We then increased the density threshold (higher sigma density) and observed that the GH
Fab density persisted; thus, we considered this to be fully occupied. Conversely, the partial density Fabs would disappear at this
higher threshold, and we therefore considered this to be partial occupancy. To detect even lower occupancy, we decreased the
threshold (lower sigma signal) relative to the normalized map and if density appeared at an epitope that began to resemble a Fab
we considered this to be low occupancy. If no density appeared, then we characterized this as no occupancy. Our results are sum-
marized in Figure 6.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical models inherent to Relion (Scheres, 2012) and CryoSparc (Punjani et al., 2017) were employed in image analysis to derive
2D classes and 3D models. Estimation of Fab occupancy in the 3D models was undertaken manually based on density thresholds in
the 3D EM reconstructions as described in the method details under the heading ‘‘Fab occupancy analysis.’’ No statistical measures
were applied.
