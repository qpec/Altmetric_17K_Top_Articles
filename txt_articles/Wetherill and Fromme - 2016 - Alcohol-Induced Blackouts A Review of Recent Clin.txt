Abstract
Background—Alcohol-induced blackouts, or memory loss for all or portions of events that 
occurred during a drinking episode, are reported by approximately 50% of drinkers and are 
associated with a wide range of negative consequences, including injury and death. As such, 
identifying the factors that contribute to and result from alcohol-induced blackouts is critical in 
developing effective prevention programs. Here, we provide an updated review (2010–2015) of 
clinical research focused on alcohol-induced blackouts, outline practical and clinical implications, 
and provide recommendations for future research.
Methods—A comprehensive, systematic literature review was conducted to examine all articles 
published between January 2010 through August 2015 that focused on examined vulnerabilities, 
consequences, and possible mechanisms for alcohol-induced blackouts.
Results—Twenty-sex studies reported on alcohol-induced blackouts. Fifteen studies examined 
prevalence and/or predictors of alcohol-induced blackouts. Six publications described 
consequences of alcohol-induced blackouts, and five studies explored potential cognitive and 
neurobiological mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced blackouts.
Conclusions—Recent research on alcohol-induced blackouts suggests that individual 
differences, not just alcohol consumption, increase the likelihood of experiencing an alcohol-
induced blackout, and the consequences of alcohol-induced blackouts extend beyond the 
consequences related to the drinking episode to include psychiatric symptoms and neurobiological 
abnormalities. Prospective studies and a standardized assessment of alcohol-induced blackouts are 
needed to fully characterize factors associated with alcohol-induced blackouts and to improve 
prevention strategies.

Introduction
Alcohol use is a pervasive problem with well-known deleterious effects on memory. 
Alcohol-induced memory impairments vary in severity, ranging from mild deficits to 
alcohol-induced blackouts (Heffernan, 2008; White, 2003). Alcohol-induced blackouts are 
defined as amnesia, or memory loss, for all or part of a drinking episode. During a blackout, 
a person is able to actively engage and respond to their environment; however, the brain is 
not creating memories for the events. Alcohol-induced blackouts are often confused with 
passing out from alcohol, but blacking out and passing out are very different states of 
consciousness. A person experiencing a blackout is conscious and interacting with his or her 
environment; whereas, a person who has passed out from alcohol has lost consciousness and 
capacity to engage in voluntary behavior. Memory deficits during a blackout are primarily 
anterograde, meaning memory loss for events that occurred after alcohol consumption 
(White, 2003). It is important to note that short-term memory remains intact during an 
alcohol-induced blackout, and as such, an intoxicated person is able to engage in a variety of 
behaviors, including having detailed conversations and other more complex behaviors like 
driving a vehicle, but information about these behaviors is not transferred from short-term to 
long-term memory, which leads to memory deficits and memory loss for these events 
(White, 2003). There is no objective evidence that a person is in an alcohol-induced blackout 
(Pressman and Caudill, 2013), thus it can be difficult or impossible to know whether or not a 
drinker is experiencing a blackout (Goodwin, 1995). This is similar to the fact that one 
cannot know whether another person has a headache; the experience is happening inside that 
person’s brain, with no clear observable indices.
Based on the duration and extent of alcohol-induced memory loss, researchers have 
described two qualitatively distinct types of blackouts: en bloc and fragmentary (Goodwin et 
al., 1969a; Goodwin et al., 1969b). En bloc blackouts typically occur at higher blood alcohol 
concentrations (BAC), have a distinct onset, and involve complete memory loss for a 
specific period of the drinking event. Fragmentary blackouts (also known as “brown outs” or 
“gray outs”), however, involve partial amnesia during a drinking episode, but one may be 
able to recall events of the episode with relevant cues (Jennison and Johnson, 1994). 
Fragmentary blackouts occur more frequently than en bloc blackouts (Goodwin et al., 
1969b; Hartzler and Fromme, 2003; White et al., 2004), but neither type appear to occur 
until breath alcohol concentrations (BrACs) are 0.06 g/dl or greater (Hartzler and Fromme, 
2003). Estimates of BrACs indicated that most blackouts occurred around 0.20 g/dl, but as 
low as 0.14 g/dl (Ryback, 1970). According to a study of amnesia in people arrested for 
alcohol-related offenses (Perry et al., 2006), the probability of a fragmentary or an en bloc 
blackout was 50/50 at a BrAC of 0.22 g/dl and the probability of an en bloc blackout was 
50/50 at a BrAC of 0.31 g/dl. As such, blackouts typically occur during binge or excessive 
drinking episodes. Further, gulping drinks and drinking on an empty stomach (Goodwin,

 1995; Perry et al., 2006), which cause a rapid rise and high peak BAC, can also increase the 
likelihood of experiencing an alcohol-induced blackout.
Although alcohol-induced blackouts were previously thought to occur only in individuals 
who were alcohol dependent (Jellinek, 1946), we now know that blackouts are quite 
common among healthy young adults. In fact, approximately 50% of college students who 
consume alcohol report having experienced an alcohol-induced blackout (Barnett et al., 
2014; White et al., 2002). Consequently, there has been increased media and research 
interest in alcohol-induced blackouts over the past two decades with at least three reviews 
describing the phenomenon (Lee et al., 2009; Rose and Grant, 2010; White, 2003) a brief, 
descriptive section in a review on excessive alcohol use (White and Hingson, 2013) and a 
recently published memoir that poignantly describes the phenomenology of blackouts 
(Hepola, 2015) (Figure 1). Therefore, this systematic review provides an update (2010–
2015) on the clinical research focused on alcohol-induced blackouts, outlines practical and 
clinical implications, and provides recommendations for future research.
Materials and Methods
A Medline search was conducted in September 2015 to identify publications that included 
either “alcohol” or “ethanol” as one search term and at least one blackout-related search 
term (e.g., “blackouts”, “blacked out”). The wildcard character “*” was used to include all 
forms of the root word. The most recent review of blackouts was published in 2010 (Rose 
and Grant, 2010) and there has since been extensive new research; therefore we limited our 
review to articles published between January 2010 and August 2015. After removing 
duplicates, case studies, articles that were not published in English, and studies not 
conducted in humans, the remaining publications were reviewed to determine whether they 
met inclusion criteria, namely that the study examined vulnerabilities, consequences, and 
possible mechanisms for alcohol-induced blackouts.
Results
Study Characteristics
A total of 26 publications met the criteria to be included in the review (see Table 1 for study 
details). Fifteen studies examined prevalence and/or predictors of alcohol-induced blackouts. 
Six publications described consequences of alcohol-induced blackouts, and five studies 
explored potential cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced 
blackouts.
Prevalence and Predictors of Alcohol-Induced Blackouts
The majority of the publications identified for this review examined binge drinking and 
alcohol-related consequences, including blackouts, among young adults and college students 
and reported prevalence rates ranging from approximately 20–55% (Barnett et al., 2014; 
Boekeloo et al., 2011; Brister et al., 2011; Chartier et al., 2011; Clinkinbeard and Johnson, 
2013; Hallett et al., 2013; Sanchez et al., 2015; Wilhite and Fromme, 2015). Although 
prevalence rates were typically around 50%, one study reported a prevalence rate of only 
about 20%; however, this was a qualitative study examining how university students define

 binge drinking (Clinkinbeard and Johnson, 2013). As such, participants were not directly 
asked whether they had experienced an alcohol-induced blackout, but rather participants 
were asked to describe binge drinking and then researchers categorized whether the 
responses described alcohol-induced blackouts. In addition to their prevalence rate of 54%, 
Barnett and colleagues (2014) found that college students reported experiencing an alcohol-
induced blackout nearly once every five drinking weeks during the first year of college. 
Thus, alcohol-induced blackouts are not only common among those who consume alcohol, 
but also recur over time.
Using longitudinal methods, Schuckit and colleagues (2015) and Wilhite and Fromme 
(2015) focused specifically on prospective analyses of alcohol-induced blackouts. Schuckit 
and colleagues (2015) used latent class growth analysis to evaluate the pattern of occurrence 
of alcohol-induced blackouts across 4 time points in 1,402 drinking adolescents between the 
ages of 15–19. Surprisingly, 30% of the adolescents reported experiencing an alcohol-
induced blackout at the age of 15, which increased to 74% at age 19. Analyses revealed 4 
classes in the patterns of the occurrence for blackouts (i.e., no blackouts, blackouts rapidly 
increasing with age, blackouts slowly increasing, and blackouts consistently reported), with 
female sex, higher drinking quantities, smoking, externalizing characteristics, and estimated 
peer substance use predicting class membership (Schuckit et al., 2015). In general, these 
findings are consistent with previous research (Rose and Grant, 2010; White et al., 2002) 
and indicate that alcohol-induced blackouts are common even among early adolescents, 
which is particularly concerning given that the adolescent brain is undergoing significant 
developmental changes.
Wilhite and Fromme (2015) examined the associations between alcohol-induced blackouts, 
alcohol dependence symptoms ((as measured by the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (White 
and Labouvie, 1989)), and social and emotional negative consequences across 2 years 
among 829 young adults who were transitioning out of college. They found that alcohol 
dependence symptoms predicted an increased frequency of blackouts and consequences the 
following year. Alcohol-induced blackouts during the past three months prospectively 
predicted increased social and emotional negative consequences, but not alcohol dependence 
symptoms the following year. These findings contradict Jellinek’s theory of alcoholism, 
which posits that alcohol-induced blackouts are a precursor of alcoholism (Jellinek, 1952).
Potential genetic influences—Behavioral genetic research suggests that there is a 
heritable component to experiencing alcohol-induced blackouts (Luczak et al., 2006; Nelson 
et al., 2004; Slutske et al., 1999). Two recent studies explored genetic influences by 
examining the potential effects of family history of alcohol problems on blackout occurrence 
(LaBrie et al., 2011; Marino and Fromme, 2015). In a study of 2,546 college students, 
LaBrie and colleagues (2011) found that a family history of alcohol problems increased the 
likelihood of blacking out. Using data from a longitudinal study of college students, Marino 
and Fromme (2015) explored whether maternal or paternal family history of problematic 
alcohol use were better predictors than a general measure of overall family history on the 
likelihood of experiencing an alcohol-induced blackout. They further tested whether gender 
moderated the association in a sample of 1,164 college students. Although prenatal alcohol 
exposure was not assessed and could influence findings, the researchers found that compared

 to women with a maternal history of problematic alcohol use, men with a maternal history of 
problematic alcohol use were more than twice as likely to report experiencing an alcohol-
induced blackout.
Based on the Marino and Fromme (2015) findings, one could speculate that a genetic 
vulnerability to alcohol-induced blackouts is expressed only under certain environmental 
conditions, representing a possible gene by environment interaction. For example, a mother 
with problematic drinking habits might contribute to an environment that is characterized by 
lower parental monitoring and increased alcohol availability. These environmental factors, in 
turn, could create stress and contribute to early initiation of alcohol use and maladaptive 
drinking behaviors in her offspring, especially sons, who are genetically predisposed to 
alcohol misuse and alcohol-induced blackouts. Given the potential impact of these findings 
on prevention and intervention programs, additional research examining genetic and 
environmental factors contributing to alcohol-induced blackouts is needed.
Prepartying and drinking games—Three studies examined high-risk drinking 
behaviors common among young adults known as “prepartying,” “pregaming,” and 
“drinking games” (LaBrie et al., 2011; Ray et al., 2014; Wahl et al., 2013). Typically, these 
drinking behaviors involve fast-paced drinking over a short period of time and can cause a 
rapid rise and high peak BAC, which increases the likelihood of experiencing an alcohol-
induced blackout (Goodwin, 1995; Perry et al., 2006). LaBrie and colleagues (2011) 
examined risk factors for blackouts among 2,546 college students who reported past month 
prepartying. Of these students, 25% reported blacking out during at least one occasion over 
the past month when prepartying had occurred. Similarly, Wahl and colleagues (2013) 
examined predrinking and associated behaviors among 757 German high school students 
and found that those who reported engaging in predrinking were more likely to experience 
alcohol-induced blackouts. Using an event-level approach, Ray and colleagues (2014) found 
that students consumed more alcohol during drinking game events compared to non-
drinking game events, and all students were more likely to experience an alcohol-induced 
blackout during events when drinking games occurred. This provides additional support for 
the importance of drinking style (e.g., pace and type of alcohol), as well as amount of 
alcohol consumed, in the occurrence of alcohol-induced blackouts.
Drinking motives—Because drinking motives are predictors of alcohol use and 
consequences, recent research has also examined the association between drinking motives 
and alcohol-induced blackouts (Boekeloo et al., 2011; Merrill and Read, 2010; Merrill et al., 
2014). Merrill and Read (2010) examined whether affect-relevant motivations for alcohol 
use (i.e., coping: drinking to alleviate negative affect; enhancement: drinking to increase 
positive affect) were associated with specific types of consequences, including alcohol-
induced blackouts, in 192 regularly drinking college students. Using structural equation 
modeling (SEM), the authors reported a direct path between enhancement motives and 
blackouts, suggesting that individuals who drink to increase positive affect might consume 
alcohol in a manner that results in a rapid increase in BAC and alcohol-induced blackouts, 
such as taking shots of liquor or drinking rapidly. Merrill and colleagues (2014) conducted a 
follow-up, longitudinal study examining whether coping and enhancement motives predicted

 alcohol consequences, including alcohol-induced blackouts, over the course of one year in 
552 college students and reported that enhancement motives indirectly predicted blackouts 
the following year. Although enhancement motives did not directly predict alcohol-induced 
blackouts in the longitudinal study, drinking to increase positive affect seems to involve a 
style of drinking that increases the likelihood of blackouts.
Boekeloo and colleauges (2011) examined a different type of drinking motive -“drinking to 
get drunk,” which the authors defined as “pre-meditated, controlled, and intentional 
consumption of alcohol to reach a state of inebriation” (p. 89). They explored the prevalence 
and correlates of this type of drinking behavior in 307 incoming freshman who reported 
consuming alcohol over the past 30 days. Nearly 77% of the incoming freshmen reported 
drinking alcohol in a pre-meditated, intentional manner with the goal of becoming 
intoxicated. Compared to those who did not drink to get drunk, individuals who reported 
drinking to get drunk were more likely to experience an alcohol-induced blackout. Further, 
consistent with the prepartying and drinking games studies described previously (LaBrie et 
al., 2011; Ray et al., 2014; Wahl et al., 2013), individuals who reported drinking to get drunk 
were also more likely to have prepartied and participated in drinking games.
Consequences of Alcohol-Induced Blackouts
As indicated by the research described above, alcohol-induced blackouts typically occur 
following a rapid rise and high peak level of alcohol intoxication, and as such, alcohol-
induced blackouts are associated with and predictive of other consequences and behaviors. 
Using SEM, Read and colleagues (2013) examined whether alcohol-related consequences, 
including alcohol-induced blackouts, predicted college students’ alcohol consumption one 
year later and whether these associations differed between men and women. Findings 
revealed that alcohol-induced blackouts during the first year of college predicted alcohol use 
the following year, with blackouts predicting later drinking increases in men and decreases 
in women (Read et al., 2013). Further, using data from a randomized controlled trial of 
screening and brief physician intervention for problem alcohol use among 954 
undergraduate and graduate students, Mundt and colleagues (2012) examined whether 
baseline alcohol-induced blackouts prospectively identified individuals with alcohol-related 
injury over the subsequent 2 years after controlling for heavy drinking days (Mundt and 
Zakletskaia, 2012; Mundt et al., 2012). Findings indicated that alcohol-induced blackouts at 
baseline predicted alcohol-related injury over time with individuals who reported 
experiencing 1–2 blackouts at baseline being 1.5 times more likely to experience an alcohol-
related injury, and those who reported 6 or more blackouts being over 2.5 times more likely 
to experience an alcohol-related injury. Mundt and Zakletskaia (2012) conducted a follow-
up analysis on the same sample and found that one in eight emergency department visits for 
alcohol-related injuries involved an alcohol-induced blackout. Thus, among young adults, 
experiencing a blackout increases the likelihood of having an alcohol-related injury over 
time, even after controlling for heavy drinking.
Recent research has also investigated the associations between alcohol-induced blackouts 
and psychiatric symptomatology (Bae et al., 2015; Neupane and Bramness, 2013; Winward 
et al., 2014). Using data provided by the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination

 Survey from 2007–2011, Bae and colleagues (2015) examined associations between alcohol 
consumption and suicidal behavior in 42,347 Korean subjects and reported that alcohol-
induced blackouts were associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in males and 
suicidal ideation in females. Further, in a sample of 188 Nepalese patients in treatment for 
alcohol use disorder, a history of alcohol-induced blackouts was predictive of having 
comorbid major depression (Neupane and Bramness, 2013).
Winward and colleagues (2014) used the Paced Auditory Serial Attention Test (PASAT-C) 
Computer Version to examine affective reactivity, cognitive performance, and distress 
tolerance in relation to blackouts, during early abstinence among 23 heavy episodic drinking 
adolescents (ages 16–18) compared to 23 matched, non-drinking controls. Findings revealed 
that heavy episodic drinking adolescents responded with greater emotional response to the 
PASAT-C compared to controls, and among heavy episodic drinking adolescents, greater 
frequency of alcohol-induced blackouts during the past three months was correlated with 
greater increases in frustration and irritability during the PASAT-C. Overall, these findings 
suggest that alcohol-induced blackouts can have profound effects on an individual’s overall 
health and well-being, above and beyond the effects of heavy alcohol consumption.
Potential Neurobiological Mechanisms of Alcohol-Induced Blackouts
Although early theories posited that alcohol’s effects on cognition and behavior were due to 
alcohol’s general disruption of brain function and depression of the central nervous system, 
preclinical and clinical research now indicates that alcohol-induced cognitive and memory 
deficits are caused by alcohol’s effects on the hippocampus and related neural structures 
(Figure 2) (White et al., 2000). Briefly, the hippocampus is a brain structure involved in 
memory formation for events and has been found to be particularly sensitive to alcohol. 
Indeed, animal research published prior to the period of the current review revealed that 
blackouts are caused by alcohol disrupting the transfer of information from short-term to 
long-term memory by interfering with hippocampal, medial septal, and frontal lobe 
functioning (White, 2003; White et al., 2000). Although the mechanism of alcohol-induced 
blackouts is now known, our understanding of the specific neurobiological vulnerability and 
why some individuals are more likely to experience alcohol-induced blackouts while others 
are not has been an area of growing interest.
Contextual memory (often described more broadly as source memory) refers to memory for 
details associated with a specific event (e.g., where a person was for the event, who was at 
the event). These memory details facilitate recall by enabling a person to consciously re-
experience past events (Tulving, 2002). As such, Wetherill and Fromme (2011) examined 
the effects of acute alcohol consumption on contextual memory and recall among 
individuals with and without a history of fragmentary blackouts in an attempt to better 
understand why some individuals experience alcohol-induced memory impairments whereas 
other do not, even when these individuals have similar drinking histories and are at 
comparable BrACs (Wetherill and Fromme, 2011). Using longitudinal data to identify 88 
young adults (mean age: 21.6 years ± 0.5; alcohol consumed 3 times a week, 3 standard 
drinks per occasion over the past 3 months) with (n=44) and without (n=44) a history of 
alcohol-induced blackouts who reported comparable drinking histories, denied other illicit

 drug use, and were demographically matched, Wetherill and Fromme conducted an alcohol 
administration (target BrAC of .08 g/dl versus no alcohol) with memory assessments and 
found that while sober, individuals with and without a history of alcohol-induced blackouts 
did not differ in memory performance; however, after alcohol consumption, individuals with 
a history of blackouts exhibited contextual memory impairments, while those without a 
history of blackouts did not.
Wetherill and colleagues (2012) conducted a follow-up study that used a within subject 
alcohol challenge followed by two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions 
under no alcohol and alcohol (target BrAC of .08 g/dl) conditions. During fMRI scanning, 
participants completed a contextual memory task. Findings again revealed that individuals 
with and without a history of fragmentary blackouts did not differ in contextual memory 
performance or neural activity while sober, yet after alcohol consumption, individuals with a 
history of fragmentary blackouts showed less neural activation during encoding and 
recollection of contextual details in prefrontal and parietal regions, suggesting that alcohol 
had differential effects on frontoparietal brain activity (Wetherill et al., 2012).
Subsequently, Wetherill and colleagues (2013) explored whether frontoparietal abnormalities 
exist among substance-naïve youth who later transition into heavy drinking and experience 
alcohol-induced blackouts. Specifically, 60 substance-naïve youth completed fMRI scanning 
during a go/no-go response inhibition task shown to engage frontal and posterior parietal 
brain regions (Tapert et al., 2007) at baseline and were followed annually. After 
approximately five years, youth had either remained substance-naïve (n=20) or had 
transitioned into heavy drinking and were classified as either alcohol-induced blackout 
positive (n=20) or alcohol-induced blackout negative (n=20). Groups were demographically 
matched and youth who experienced alcohol-induced blackouts were matched on follow-up 
substance use. Although groups did not differ in inhibitory processing performance, prior to 
initiating substance use, youth who later transitioned into heavy drinking and experienced an 
alcohol-induced blackout showed greater neural activation during inhibitory processing in 
frontal and cerebellar regions compared to controls and those who did not experience 
alcohol-induced blackouts. Further, activation during correct inhibitory processing compared 
to go responses in the left and right middle frontal gyri at baseline predicted future blackout 
experience, after controlling for alcohol consumption and externalizing behaviors (Wetherill 
et al., 2013). Findings from this study suggest that some individuals have inherent 
vulnerabilities to inhibitory processing difficulties that likely contribute to alcohol-induced 
memory impairments. Overall, these neuroimaging findings provide strong evidence for 
neurobiological vulnerabilities to alcohol-induced memory impairments and alcohol-induced 
blackouts that exist prior to the onset of alcohol use but become more evident after alcohol 
consumption.
Silveri and colleagues (2014) and Chitty and colleagues (2014) used magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (MRS) to examine potential neurochemical differences among individuals who 
experience blackouts and those who do not. Using MRS in a sample of 23 young adults who 
were binge drinkers and 31 young adult light drinkers, researchers found in vivo evidence of 
lower frontal lobe (i.e. anterior cingulate cortex, ACC) gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) 
and N-acetyl-apartate (NAA) in binge drinkers than light drinkers, with post hoc analyses

 revealing that these lower neurochemical profiles were driven by binge drinkers who 
reported a history of alcohol-induced blackouts (Silveri et al., 2014). Further, in a sample of 
113 18–30 year olds (64 individuals with bipolar disorder and 49 healthy comparison 
controls), reduced hippocampal glutathione, the brain’s most potent antioxidant, 
concentration was associated with blackout occurrence and severity (Chitty et al., 2014). 
Chitty and colleagues (2014) interpreted these findings as support for the role of the 
hippocampus in alcohol-induced memory impairments. Together, these MRS findings 
indicate that binge drinking and riskier alcohol use affect the neurochemistry of some 
individuals more than others, which may contribute to the recurrence of and vulnerability to 
alcohol-induced memory impairments.
Practical and Clinical Implications of Alcohol-induced Blackouts
From a review of 26 empirical studies, Pressman and Caudill (2013) concluded that only 
short-term memory is impaired during a blackout and that other cognitive functions, such as 
planning, attention, and social skills, were not affected. Because cognitive functions other 
than memory are not necessarily impaired during a blackout (Pressman and Caudill, 2013), a 
critical question is whether or not people are responsible for their behavior while in a 
blackout. This is often a key factor in alcohol-related crimes, when the perpetrator or victim 
claim to have no memory for their actions (van Oorsouw et al., 2004). For example, 
Pressman and Caudill (2013) reference a quadruple murder in which the defendant claimed 
he had no memory of committing the murders because he was in an alcohol-induced 
blackout at the time. Applying Daubert legal standards to this case ((Daubert v. Merrell Dow 
Pharmaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579 (1993)), the authors concluded that the accused’s blackout 
could not be used as a viable defense. Equally important, however, may be the memory of a 
potential victim of a crime. For example, alleged victims of sexual assault may claim they 
have no memory for events that led up to the sexual activities ((United States v. Pease, Navy-
Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals 201400165, (2015)). Whereas there is legal 
precedent to prevent voluntary intoxication and blackouts from being viable defenses against 
committing a crime (Cunnien, 1986; Marlowe et al., 1999), a remaining question is the 
extent to which alleged victims in a blackout should be held accountable for their actions, 
despite their lack of memories. Unquestionably, when a victim is incapacitated from alcohol 
and unable to provide consent, there are grounds for a conviction of sexual assault. However, 
as reviewed above, blackouts can occur at BrACs well below the level of incapacitation. If 
people maintain their ability to make conscious decisions and execute voluntary behaviors 
while in a blackout, questions remain about whether or not they are responsible for their 
actions.
It is important to remember that when examining the impact of blackouts, the accused, 
victim, patient, or research subject is typically being asked to remember not remembering. 
This is a critical challenge to understanding and studying blackouts, and also raises 
questions about the accuracy of memories that are reported following a blackout. In an effort 
to fill in gaps in their memory because of alcohol-induced blackouts, people use a variety of 
strategies to reconstruct their experiences (Nash and Takarangi, 2011). The most common 
reconstruction strategy is to ask friends who were present, and who may or may not have 
also been intoxicated. Consequently, in their quest to learn about their actions while in a

 blackout, people may be given misinformation from their friends, leading to inaccurate 
reconstructions of the events. People may also look for photos/videos or other types of 
physical evidence to help fill gaps in their memories due to blackouts. Regardless of how 
many different approaches a person takes in order to help reconstruct their memory of what 
occurred during a blackout, there is rarely a way to validate the memories as accurate 
because the process of memory reconstruction is inherently fallible.
The fallibility of memory, even in the absence of alcohol or blackouts, has been documented 
through decades of rigorous experimental and field research. Leading this research, 
Elizabeth Loftus has authored over 200 books and thousands of peer-reviewed articles which 
demonstrate the many ways in which memory for events can be distorted or contaminated 
during the process of recall (Loftus and Davis, 2006; Morgan et al., 2013; Patihis et al., 
2013). Provision of misinformation, the passage of time, and being asked or interviewed 
about prior events can all lead to memory distortions as the individual strives to reconstruct 
prior events (Loftus and Davis, 2006; Nash and Takarangi, 2011). Consequently, the 
reliability or accuracy of memories that are recalled following a period of alcohol-induced 
amnesia are likely to be suspect.
There are also important clinical implications of blackouts, as alcohol-induced blackouts 
have been associated with psychiatric symptomatology (Bae et al., 2015; Neupane and 
Bramness, 2013; Winward et al., 2014), as well as feeling embarrassed or distressed when 
learning about their behavior during a blackout (White et al., 2004). Efforts to reconcile their 
intoxicated behavior with their personal values may further contribute to significant 
emotional angst (Wilhite and Fromme, 2015). As such, educating people about the nature 
and consequences of alcohol-induced blackouts is needed. Although heavy episodic 
drinking, a common correlate of alcohol-induced blackouts, is often a focus of alcohol 
prevention programs, rarely are blackouts considered as a target for intervention. For 
example, a recent study on the effects of a motivational invention on alcohol consumption 
and blackouts found that the intervention decreased both alcohol consumption and the 
number of blackouts experienced (Kazemi et al., 2013). Thus, educating people about the 
factors that contribute to (e.g., predrinking/prepartying; family history of alcohol problems) 
and consequences of blackouts may help reduce the likelihood of experiencing blackouts 
and related negative emotional consequences (Wilhite and Fromme, 2015).
Challenges and Future Research
There are several challenges that hinder research on blackouts. First, alcohol-induced 
blackouts are amnestic periods, and as such, researchers are relying on self-report of alcohol 
consumption for a period of time that the individual cannot recall. Further, individuals who 
experienced a blackout often rely on other individuals to help reconstruct the events that 
occurred during the blackout, but the information from these other individuals is likely 
unreliable because they may also be consuming alcohol (Nash and Takarangi, 2011). As 
such, future research should use alternative methodologies to better understand the 
phenomenology of alcohol-induced blackouts. For example, information might be obtained 
from a research observer, posing as a confederate, who is not drinking but is present at the 
drinking event. Also, because short-term memory remains intact, use of ecological

 momentary assessment with smart phones might also be useful for gathering information 
about the drinker’s experiences while he or she is in a blackout state. Subsequent interviews 
could then determine what aspects of those events were remembered and whether they were 
remembered in the same way that they were reported during the drinking event.
Another complicating factor for research on blackouts is the potential use of other drugs 
(illicit or prescription) that might also contribute to memory loss. Although several research 
studies statistically control for or exclude individuals who report co-occurring illicit drug 
use, research clearly indicates that some individuals who report blackouts also report other 
drug use (Baldwin et al., 2011; Haas et al., 2015). Thus, researchers must be cautious and 
account for factors other than alcohol that might contribute to blackouts.
Perhaps the greatest impediment to rigorous tests of alcohol-induced blackouts and behavior 
is that researchers are not ethically permitted to provide alcohol in sufficient doses to cause a 
blackout to occur. BrACs of 20 g/dl and above are typically required to induce a blackout, 
thereby limiting the ability to safely dose research participants to the point of blackout. As 
such, researchers may consider conducting field studies in order to better characterize and 
understand alcohol-induced blackouts, as it is quite likely that the events and consequences 
that occur during a blackout are underestimated given the limits of laboratory research and 
self-report of events. Finally, given the growing literature on alcohol-induced memory 
impairments and blackouts, a standardized assessment for alcohol-induced blackouts is 
sorely needed. Most of the existing research on alcohol-induced blackouts either uses a 
single item from the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index or the investigator’s own description/
definition of an alcohol-induced blackout. Moreover the frequency of occurrence for 
blackouts is currently measured in widely different ways, including dichotomous measures 
(e.g., Yes/No blackouts) and proportion of times drinking that blackouts were experienced 
(e.g., always, sometimes, never). In an effort to better characterize blackouts, researchers 
should collect detailed information about past and current alcohol consumption patterns, as 
well as other illicit drug use. It will be important for future studies to conduct a thorough 
assessment of the alcohol consumption that occurred during the drinking event in which the 
blackout occurred (i.e., duration of drinking, type of alcohol consumed, pace of 
consumption), as well as gender and weight, in order to calculate more accurate estimations 
of BACs. Optimally, actual BrACs or blood draws could be collected to back-extrapolate 
peak BACs to the time of blackout. This information will enable researchers to statistically 
control for the direct effects of alcohol consumption and examine factors that influence 
alcohol-induced blackouts over and beyond the amount of alcohol consumed.
Despite the increase in research on and our understanding of alcohol-induced blackouts, 
additional rigorous research is still needed. Studies examining potential genetic and 
environmental influences, as well as their interactions, are clearly warranted given recent 
research findings of Marino and Fromme (2015). Sex differences in alcohol-induced 
blackouts are another area in need of study. Although previous research indicates that 
women are more vulnerable to alcohol-induced blackouts due to the effect of sex differences 
in pharmacokinetics and body composition on alcohol bioavailability (Rose and Grant, 
2010), the influence of biological sex on alcohol-induced blackouts are inconsistent. 
Specifically, several studies either did not assess sex differences (Clinkinbeard and Johnson, 
Wetherill and Fromme

 2013; Sanchez et al., 2015; Wetherill and Fromme, 2011; Wetherill et al., 2013), reported no 
sex differences (Barnett et al., 2014; Boekeloo et al., 2011; Brister et al., 2011, Wilhite and 
Fromme, 2015), reported that males reported higher rates of alcohol-induced blackouts 
(Chartier et al., 2011) or reported that being a female contributed to the likelihood of 
experiencing an alcohol-induced blackout (Hallett et al., 2013; Schuckit et al., 2015). These 
inconsistent findings could be due in part to methodological differences across research 
studies and assessment of alcohol-induced blackouts, and future studies should address this 
issue. Additional areas for future study include interventions targeting alcohol-induced 
blackouts, whether the risk for alcohol-induced blackouts increases as individuals age and 
become more susceptible to memory deficits, and whether there is a “window of 
vulnerability” such that experiencing an alcohol-induced blackout increases the risk of 
experiencing another alcohol-induced blackout within a short time frame (akin to second 
impact syndrome for concussions).
The literature on alcohol-induced blackouts continues to grow, and the recent research 
reviewed here suggests that there are individual factors that contribute to the occurrence of 
alcohol-induced memory impairments beyond the amount of alcohol consumed and that 
alcohol-induced blackouts have consequences beyond memory loss for a drinking episode. 
Although our understanding of alcohol-induced blackouts has improved dramatically, 
additional research is clearly necessary. By fine-tuning our approach to studying blackouts, 
we will improve our understanding of alcohol-induced blackouts, and consequently, be 
better situated to improve prevention strategies.

involved in episodic memory. Bottom panel: A general model of memory formation, storage, 
and retrieval reproduced with permission from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism publication (White, 2003). Alcohol interferes with all stages of the memory 
process, but the alcohol’s primary effect appears to be on the transfer of information from 
short-term to long-term storage. Intoxicated individuals are typically able to recall 
information immediately after it is presented and can keep the information active in short-
term memory for one minute or more if they are not distracted. Individuals may also be able 
to recall long-term memories formed before they became intoxicated; however, after just one 
or two drinks, individuals show memory impairments. Alcohol can interfere with these 
memory processes so severely that once sober, the individual is not able to recall all or 
portions of the events that occurred during the drinking episode.

students participating in 
an Internet-based 
intervention trial and 
scored ≥8 on AUDIT, 
Ages: 17–24 (M=19.4), 
53% male
a.
Demographics, questionnaire about 
frequency/quantity of alcohol use over the 
previous 4 weeks, AREAS, APS
b.
Self-report survey
Blackouts were one of the most frequently 
reported non-academic problem (44.8%)

Demographics, prepartying behavior 
questions about the past 30 days, DDQ
b.
Self-report, web-based survey
25% of students reported blacking out during at 
least one occasion in which prepartying occurred 
in the past 30 days
Greek affiliation, family history of alcohol abuse, 
frequency of prepartying, and both playing 
drinking games and consuming shots of liquor 
while prepartying increased the likelihood of 
blacking out

Students who reported higher levels of alcohol 
quantity across events were more likely to report 
experiencing blackout
Controlling for individual differences in typical 
drinking, those who played drinking games more 
frequently were more likely to experience a 
blackout
When women, compared to men, consumed 1 
more drink than their usual amount, odds of 
experiencing a blackout increased by 13%

In the 2 years prior to age 15, almost 30% of 
youth reported experiencing an alcohol-induced 
blackout
At age 19, 74% of youth reported experiencing an 
alcohol-induced blackout
Four latent trajectory classes were identified:
Class 1 (5.1%) reported no blackouts
Class 2 (29.5%) blackouts increased rapidly 
with age
Class 3 (44.9%) blackouts slowly increased
Class 4 (20.5%) blackouts were consistently 
reported
Class 2 was used as a reference and predictors 
included female sex, higher drinking, smoking, 
externalizing characteristics, and estimated peer 
substance involvement
