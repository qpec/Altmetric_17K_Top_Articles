� Context.—ERBB2 (erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 or
HER2) is currently the only biomarker established for
selection of a specific therapy for patients with advanced
gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA). However, there
are no comprehensive guidelines for the assessment of
HER2 in patients with GEA.
Objectives.—To establish an evidence-based guideline
for HER2 testing in patients with GEA, to formalize the
algorithms for methods to improve the accuracy of HER2
testing while addressing which patients and tumor speci-
mens are appropriate, and to provide guidance on clinical
decision making.
Design.—The College of American Pathologists, Amer-
ican Society for Clinical Pathology, and American Society
of Clinical Oncology convened an expert panel to conduct
a systematic review of the literature to develop an
evidence-based guideline with recommendations for opti-
mal HER2 testing in patients with GEA.
Results.—The panel is proposing 11 recommendations
with strong agreement from the open-comment participants.
Recommendations.—The panel recommends that tumor
specimen(s) from all patients with advanced GEA, who are
candidates for HER2-targeted therapy, should be assessed
for HER2 status before the initiation of HER2-targeted
therapy. Clinicians should offer combination chemothera-
py and a HER2-targeted agent as initial therapy for all
patients with HER2-positive advanced GEA. For patholo-
gists, guidance is provided for morphologic selection of
neoplastic tissue, testing algorithms, scoring methods,
interpretation and reporting of results, and laboratory
quality assurance.
Conclusions.—This guideline provides specific recom-
mendations for assessment of HER2 in patients with
advanced GEA while addressing pertinent technical issues
and clinical implications of the results.

astroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) is estimated to
represent up to 43 280 cancer cases in the United States
in 2016,1 and represents the eighth (esophageal) and fifth
(stomach) most common cancers worldwide.2 Gastroesoph-
ageal adenocarcinoma is often diagnosed at an advanced
stage, resulting in a poor prognosis. Most localized GEAs
(stages II and III) are best treated with multimodality therapy,

 which can result in a five-year survival in ~40% of patients;
however, once GEA is advanced (defined as unresectable
local-regional, recurrent, or metastatic disease), therapies are
limited and palliative with cure being extremely rare.
In 2010, results of an open-label, international, phase 3
randomized
controlled
trial
(Trastuzumab
for
Gastric
Cancer, ToGA), showed that the anti-HER2 humanized
monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech,
San Francisco, California) statistically significantly pro-
longed overall survival, compared with chemotherapy alone,
in patients with HER2–positive advanced GEA.3 ERBB2 (also
commonly known as HER2) is a proto-oncogene located on
chromosome 17 that encodes a 185-kDa tyrosine kinase
receptor belonging to the epidermal growth factor receptor
family whose phosphorylation initiates signaling pathways
that lead to cell division, proliferation, differentiation, and
anti-apoptosis signaling.4,5 Past investigations have estimat-
ed that between 7% and 38% of GEAs have amplification
and/or overexpression of HER2.3,6,7
The frequency of overexpression of HER2 is slightly greater
for cancers at the gastroesophageal junction in comparison to
the stomach,3,8–10 and overexpression in the stomach varies
with histologic type (intestinal-type greater than diffuse-type)
and
differentiation
(well
and
moderately
differentiated
greater than poorly differentiated).11 In comparison to breast
carcinomas, the heterogeneity of immunostaining is greater
in GEA,9,12 and the completeness of membrane staining
required for positivity in mammary neoplastic cells is
infrequent in GEA and often expression is seen in a
basolateral pattern. Hofmann et al13 proposed a 4-tier
HER2 scoring system, also used in the ToGA trial, for GEA
by applying an assessment area cutoff of at least 10% stained
tumor cells for resection specimens and a small single cluster
of cells (or at least 5 cells) for biopsy specimens.
Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that
targets the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor,
inhibits downstream signal activation, and induces anti-
body-dependent cellular toxicity. The literature on HER2 as
a prognostic factor for patients with GEA is conflicting; not
all studies have shown an association between HER2
overexpression
and
poor
prognosis
in
GEA.13,14
The
National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice
Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Gastric
Cancer and Esophageal
and Esophagogastric
Junction
Cancers recommend assessment of HER2 overexpression
using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or gene amplifica-
tion using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or
another in situ hybridization (ISH) method in tumor
samples from patients with unresectable locally advanced,
recurrent, or metastatic GEA for whom trastuzumab may be
potentially beneficial.11,15 Testing for HER2 is primarily
performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded biopsy
or resection tumor tissue from the primary or metastatic site.
In 2007, a joint expert panel convened by the American
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of
American Pathologists (CAP) met to develop guidelines for
when and how to test for HER2 in patients with breast
cancer, which is amplified and/or overexpressed in up to
30% of cases.16 In 2012, ASCO and CAP convened an
Update Committee to conduct a comprehensive review of
the peer-reviewed literature published since 2006 and to
revise the guideline recommendations. The Update Com-
mittee developed new algorithms for testing and recom-
mended quality assurance monitoring that would make
HER2 testing less variable and ensure more analytic
consistency among laboratories.17
Because there are important distinct differences in HER2
expression, scoring, and outcomes in GEA relative to breast
carcinoma, the need for HER2 guidelines (that include
critical clinical and laboratory considerations) was recog-
nized. The CAP, American Society for Clinical Pathology
(ASCP), and ASCO convened an international expert panel
to systematically review published documents and to
develop an evidence-based guideline to establish recom-
mendations for HER2 testing in GEA.
PANEL COMPOSITION
The CAP Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center,
ASCP, and ASCO convened an international expert panel
consisting of practicing pathologists, oncologists, and a
gastroenterologist with expertise and experience in GEA.
Members included practicing clinicians and pathologists
from the United States, Canada, and Europe. The CAP,
ASCP, and ASCO approved the appointment of the project,
cochairs,
and
expert
panel
members.
In
addition,
a
physician-methodologist experienced in systematic review
and guideline development consulted with the panel
throughout
the
project,
and
a
patient
advocate
also
participated to convey the patient experience.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY
Before
appointment
to
the
expert
panel,
potential
members completed a joint conflict of interest (COI)
disclosure process whose policy and form require disclosure
of material financial interest in, or potential for benefit of
significant value from, the guideline’s development or its
recommendations. The potential members completed the
COI disclosure form, listing any relationship that could be
interpreted as constituting an actual, potential, or apparent
conflict. Potential conflicts were managed by the cochairs.
All members were required to disclose conflicts before
beginning the project and then continuously throughout the
project’s timeline. Disclosed conflicts of the expert panel
members are listed in the Appendix. The CAP, ASCP, and
ASCO provided funding for the administration of the
project; no industry funding was involved in any aspect of
the development of this guideline. All panel members
volunteered their time and were not compensated for their
involvement. Please see the supplemental digital content
(SDC) for details on the COI policy.
OBJECTIVE
The panel addressed the overarching questions ‘‘What is
the optimal testing algorithm for the assessment of HER2
status in patients with GEA?’’ and ‘‘What strategies can help
ensure optimal performance, interpretation, and reporting
of established assays in patients with GEA?’’
This led to the following additional questions:
1. Should HER2 testing be performed in every patient
diagnosed with GEA?
2. Which tumor specimen(s) is(are) the most appropriate
to perform HER2 testing?
3. In patients with HER2-positive results, under what clinical
scenario should HER2-targeted therapy be initiated?
4. Should HER2-directed therapy be delayed if HER2
status cannot be confirmed as positive or negative (ie, if
an equivocal result is found with IHC)?
2
Arch Pathol Lab Med

 5. Under what circumstances should a patient’s tumor
specimen be retested for HER2?
6. What are the clinical performance characteristics of IHC
and ISH?
7. What are the analytic performance characteristics of
IHC and ISH?
8. What are the acceptable methodologies for HER2 IHC
(different antibodies) and ISH (different probe plat-
forms)?
9. What is the optimal testing algorithm for the assess-
ment of HER2 status?
10. What are the steps/procedures needed to analytically
validate a laboratory-developed HER2 GEA assay
before reporting results on patient tumor specimen(s)?
11. What is the best scoring method for IHC and ISH in
GEA specimens?
12. How should HER2 results be reported?
13. What is adequate tumor specimen handling for HER2
testing?
14. What is the appropriate morphologic correlation for
interpretation of ISH?
15. What are the optimal quality assurance/quality control
standards that all HER2 testing laboratories should
adhere to?
16. Is there a role for HER2 genomic testing?
METHODS
A detailed account of the methods used to create this guideline
can be found in the SDC, including additional scope questions.
Systematic Literature Review and Analysis
A systematic literature search was completed for relevant
evidence by using OvidSP, PubMed, and Scopus (January 1,
2008, to June 1, 2015). The search strategy included medical subject
headings (MeSH) and text words to capture the general concepts of
gastroesophageal neoplasms, human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (ERBB2/HER2), targeted therapy, and laboratory testing
methods. Database searches were supplemented with a search for
unindexed literature, including a review of clinical trials and
pertinent organizations’ Web sites. All searches were limited to
human studies. Expert panel recommendations and a review of
reference lists of included articles for relevant reports completed the
systematic literature review. Detailed information regarding the
literature search strategy can be found in the SDC.
Eligible Study Designs
Eligible study designs were determined a priori on the basis of
whether they were clinical or laboratory-based studies. Clinical
studies were included if they were systematic reviews with or
without meta-analyses, guidelines, consensus statements, or
randomized controlled trials (except for phase I trials). Additional
study types were included for laboratory-based studies owing to
concern that relevant data would not otherwise be captured.
Detailed information about included study designs is available in
the SDC.
Inclusion Criteria
Published studies were selected for inclusion in the systematic
review of evidence if they met the following criteria: (1) the study
included human patients, (2) the study population consisted of
patients with invasive GEA, (3) the study was published in English,
(4) the study compared, prospectively or retrospectively, laboratory
testing methodologies or potential testing algorithms for HER2
testing, (5) the study addressed 1 of the key questions, and (6) the
study included measurable data such as the negative predictive
value or positive predictive value of ISH and IHC assays used to
determine HER2 status, alone and in combination; negative and
positive concordance across the platforms; sensitivity and specific-
ity of individual tests and accuracy in determining HER2 status.
Detailed information about the inclusion criteria is available in the
SDC.
Exclusion Criteria
Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they were
meeting abstracts that were not published in peer review journals;
noncomparative or qualitative studies, including editorials, com-
mentaries, and letters; animal studies; full text articles not available
in English; studies that included patients with other tumor types,
including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, or patients with
noninvasive tumors; studies that did not include relevant measur-
able data; and studies that did not address at least 1 of the key
questions. Detailed information about the exclusion criteria is
available in the SDC.
Quality Assessment
Study design aspects related to individual study quality, strength
of evidence, strength of recommendations, and the risk of bias were
assessed. Refer to the SDC for more information and for definitions
of ratings for overall potential risk of bias.
Assessing the Strength of Recommendations
The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, by using
the GLIDES (Guidelines Into Decision Support) methodology18
and accompanying BridgeWiz software (Yale University, New
Haven, Connecticut).19 Development of recommendations required
that the panel review and identify evidence and make a series of
key judgments (using procedures described in SDC). Additionally,
the expert panel gave its recommendations with regard to potential
clinical impact by assessing benefits and harms for each recom-
mendation, and then rated the quality of evidence for the
recommendations as high, intermediate, low, or insufficient. The
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
Evaluation, or GRADE method,20 was used to rate the quality of
the evidence. CAP uses a 3-tier system to rate the strength of
recommendations instead of the traditional 2-tier approach of
strong or weak recommendations. This approach is consistent with
prior CAP guidelines (Tables 1 and 2).
Guideline Revision
This guideline will be reviewed every 4 years, or earlier in the
event of publication of substantive and high-quality evidence that
could potentially alter the original recommendations. If necessary,

 the entire panel will be reconvened to discuss potential changes.
When appropriate, the panel will recommend revision(s) of the
guideline to CAP, ASCP, and ASCO for review and approval.
Disclaimer
The CAP developed the Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center
as a forum to create and maintain evidence-based practice guidelines
and consensus statements. Practice guidelines and consensus
statements reflect the best available evidence and expert consensus
supported in practice. They are intended to assist physicians and
patients in clinical decision making and to identify questions and
settings for further research. With the rapid flow of scientific
information, new evidence may emerge between the time a practice
guideline or consensus statement is developed and when it is
published or read. Guidelines and statements are not continually
updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. Guidelines
and statements address only the topics specifically identified therein
and are not applicable to other interventions, diseases, or stages of
diseases. Furthermore, guidelines and consensus statements cannot
account for individual variation among patients and cannot be
considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of
other treatments. It is the responsibility of the treating physician or
other health care provider, relying on independent experience and
knowledge, to determine the best course of treatment for the patient.
Accordingly, adherence to any practice guideline or consensus
statement is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding
its application to be made by the physician in light of each patient’s
individual circumstances and preferences. CAP, ASCP, and ASCO
make no warranty, express or implied, regarding guidelines and
statements and specifically exclude any warranties of merchantability
and fitness for a particular use or purpose. CAP, ASCP, and ASCO
assume no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or
property arising out of or related to any use of this statement or for
any errors or omissions.
RESULTS
A total of 969 studies met the search term requirements. A
total of 116 articles were included for data extraction. This
consisted of 1 systematic review, 2 meta-analyses, 2
randomized controlled trials, 27 prospective studies, 69
prospective-retrospective
studies,
and
15
retrospective
studies. Excluded articles were available as discussion or
background references. The expert panel met face-to-face
on April 25, 2015, to develop the scope and the key
questions, and on August 29, 2015, to draft recommenda-
tions and assess the quality of evidence. The panel met a
total of 16 times via Web conference in small groups to
review solicited feedback and finalize the recommendations.
A nominal group technique was used by the panel for
consensus decision making to encourage unique input with
balanced participation among the group members. An open
comment period was held from December 8, 2015, to
January 11, 2016, during which draft recommendations were
posted on the ASCP Web site. Twenty recommendations
were drafted with strong agreement for each recommenda-
tion from the open-comment-period participants ranging
from 82% to 95% (refer to Outcomes in SDC for full details).
The Web site received a total of 294 comments.
Teams of 2 expert panel members were assigned to 2 key
questions and 3 to 4 draft recommendations to review all
the comments received and provide an overall summary to
the rest of the panel. Following panel discussions and the
final quality of evidence assessment, the panel members
determined whether to maintain the original draft recom-
mendations as is, or revise them with major content
changes. The panel modified 1 draft recommendation and
combined 4 draft recommendations from the feedback
during the open comment period and the considered
judgment process. Additionally, the panel decided that
general recommendations about quality assurance, turn-
around time, and specimen handling were best suited as
part of the discussion, and would be included in the body of
the final manuscript rather than as formal recommenda-
tions. Resolution of all changes was obtained by majority
consensus of the panel, using nominal group technique

Each organization instituted a review process to approve
the guideline. The CAP convened an independent review
panel representing the Council for Scientific Affairs to
review and approve the guideline. The independent review
panel was masked to the expert panel and vetted through
the COI process. ASCP assigned the review of the guideline
to a Special Review Panel at the discretion of the ASCP
Executive Office and Board of Directors. The ASCO
approval process required the review and approval of the
Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee.
GUIDELINE STATEMENTS
1. Strong Recommendation.—In patients with advanced
GEA who are potential candidates for HER2-targeted
therapy, the treating clinician should request HER2 testing
on tumor tissue.
(Quality of evidence: High; Strength of recommendation:
Strong)
All patients who have documented advanced GEA and
who are considered good candidates for combination
chemotherapy plus trastuzumab therapy should have their
tumor tissue tested for HER2 overexpression and/or
amplification. In patients with HER2-positive GEA, the
addition of trastuzumab can increase the response rate,
prolong progression-free survival, and prolong overall
survival. Other than providing guidance to the addition of
trastuzumab to cytotoxic combination (when the tumor is
HER2 positive), HER2 status provides little additional value
such as prognostic or predictive information. Currently,
there is no evidence of benefit of HER2-directed therapy in
patients without advanced GEA.
In the ToGA trial, patients were randomly assigned to
receive capecitabine plus cisplatin or fluorouracil plus
cisplatin in combination with trastuzumab.3,8 Of the 3803
patients originally screened for eligibility, 810 patients had
IHC or FISH HER2-positive tumors but only 594 patients
were randomly assigned to treatment. The HER2 positivity
rate was 22.1% with similar rates between European and
Asian patients (23.6% versus 23.9%). The eligible patients
included those with advanced adenocarcinoma of the
stomach or gastroesophageal junction; Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2;
adequate organ function; and measurable or nonmeasurable
disease. Patients were ineligible if they had congestive heart
failure, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction less than
50%, transmural myocardial infarction, uncontrolled hyper-
tension (systolic blood pressure . 180 mm Hg or diastolic
blood pressure . 100 mm Hg), angina pectoris requiring
medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease,
high-risk arrhythmias, lack of physical integrity of the upper
gastrointestinal tract or malabsorption syndrome, active
gastrointestinal bleeding, and evidence of brain metastases.

Guideline Statements and Strength of Recommendation
Guideline Statement
College of American
Pathologists (CAP)
Strength of
Recommendation
1. In patients with GEA who are potential candidates for HER2-targeted therapy, the treating clinician
should request HER2 testing on tumor tissue.
Strong recommendation
2. Treating clinicians or pathologist should request HER2 testing on tumor tissue in the biopsy or
resection specimens (primary or metastasis) preferably before the initiation of trastuzumab therapy if
such specimens are available and adequate. HER2 testing on FNA specimens (cell blocks) is an
acceptable alternative.
Recommendation
3. Treating clinicians should offer combination chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy as the initial
treatment for appropriate patients with HER2-positive tumors who have metastatic or recurrent GEA.
Recommendation
4. Laboratories/pathologists must specify the antibodies and probes used for the test and ensure that
assays are appropriately validated for HER2 IHC and ISH on GEA specimens.
Strong recommendation
5. When GEA HER2 status is being evaluated, laboratories/pathologists should perform/order IHC
testing first followed by ISH when IHC result is 2þ (equivocal). Positive (3þ) or negative (0 or 1þ)
HER2 IHC results do not require further ISH testing.
Strong recommendation
6. Pathologists should use the Ruschoff/Hofmann method in scoring HER2 IHC and ISH results for
GEA.
Strong recommendation
7. Pathologists should select the tissue block with the areas of lowest grade tumor morphology in
biopsy and resection specimens. More than 1 tissue block may be selected if different morphologic
patterns are present.
Recommendation
8. Laboratories should report HER2 testing results in GEA specimens in accordance with the CAP
‘‘Template for Reporting Results of HER2 (ERBB2) Biomarker Testing of Specimens From Patients
With Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach or Esophagogastric Junction.’’
Strong recommendation
9. Pathologists should identify areas of invasive adenocarcinoma and also mark areas with strongest
intensity of HER2 expression by IHC in GEA specimens for subsequent ISH scoring when required.
Strong recommendation
10. Laboratories must incorporate GEA HER2 testing methods into their overall laboratory quality
improvement program, establishing appropriate quality improvement monitors as needed to ensure
consistent performance in all steps of the testing and reporting process. In particular, laboratories
performing GEA HER2 testing must participate in a formal proficiency testing program, if available,
or an alternative proficiency assurance activity.
Strong recommendation
11. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against genomic testing in patients with GEA at
this time.
No recommendation

 The median overall survival was 13.8 months for patients
receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, compared with
11.1 months for those receiving chemotherapy alone
(hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.60–0.91; P ¼ .0038). Patients with IHC of 3þ derived more
benefit than those with IHC of 2þ (and concurrent HER2
amplification by ISH). However, upon further follow-up of
these patients, reanalyses demonstrated considerable re-
duction in patient benefit from the addition of trastuzumab
(HR¼0.8; 95% CI, 0.67–0.97; P¼.019). The difference in the
median survival diminished to a mere 1.4 months.21
The cardiac adverse event rate was low (6%) and did not
differ between the treatment groups. Trastuzumab was
generally well tolerated, but the patients assigned to
trastuzumab experienced slightly higher rates of diarrhea,
stomatitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and weight
loss, but there was no difference between the groups in
frequency of side effects, or grade 3 or 4 toxicities except for
diarrhea.
NCCN Guidelines recommend systemic therapy, clinical
trial participation, or palliative management for patients
with a Karnofsky performance score greater or equal to
60%, or an ECOG performance score less than or equal to 2,
and that trastuzumab should be added to active first-line
combination chemotherapy for HER2-positive metastatic
GEA (although the ToGA trial combined cisplatin and a
fluoropyrimidine with trastuzumab).11 Patients with a
Karnofsky performance score less than 60%, or ECOG
performance score greater than or equal to 3, are best
managed with best supportive care.
Although the literature regarding HER2 as a prognostic
marker is conflicting, some studies6,22–24 have demonstrated
that HER2 amplification or overexpression in GEA may be
associated with a worse prognosis and is independent of
other prognostic factors including age, sex, location, or
stage. We briefly review only 2 large and representative
studies that failed to correlate HER2 status with prognosis. A
retrospective study of 1006 Japanese patients with gastric
cancer established HER2 overexpression in 11.7% of cases.25
The HER2 status correlated with age, sex, grade, growth
pattern, and nodal status; however, HER2 overexpression
did not correlate with disease-specific survival or recur-
rence-free survival. Likewise, a combined analysis of 924
German and British patients who had undergone surgical
resection demonstrated HER2 expression in less than 10%
of tumor specimens with considerable intratumoral hetero-
geneity and no relationship between HER2 expression,
patient survival, or stage.26
In summary, the evidence does not support the determi-
nation of HER2 status in patients who have a surgically
resectable GEA, and HER2 status is not useful to
prognosticate survival or similar endpoints. However, for
patients with advanced GEA with a good performance
status, low cardiac risk, and who would otherwise be
candidates for systemic therapy including trastuzumab,
HER2 testing should be performed and patients should be
offered trastuzumab if GEA is HER2 positive.
2. Recommendation.—Treating clinicians or pathologists
should request HER2 testing on tumor tissue in the biopsy
or resection specimens (primary or metastasis) preferably
before the initiation of trastuzumab therapy if such
specimens are available and adequate. HER2 testing on
fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens (cell blocks) is an
acceptable alternative.

Tumor Specimens From the Primary GEA
Primary tumor specimens obtained either by biopsy or
resection represent the principal sample type for assessment
of HER2 status in a number of larger analyses that have
included patients with resectable GEA. Of the 115 patient
biopsy or resection specimens tested for HER2 in the
MAGIC (Medical Research Council Adjuvant Gastric Cancer
Infusional Chemotherapy) trial, there was 92.9% (145 of
156) concordance between the 2 types of specimens.27 In the
ToGA trial, 2596 patients’ tumors (68%) were acquired by a
biopsy and 1199 patients’ tumors (32%) were acquired from
the surgical specimens. Of these, 579 biopsy specimens
were HER2 positive, and 231 of the surgical specimens were
HER2 positive. Overall positive rate was 23.2% for biopsy
specimens and 19.7% for the surgical specimens. Of note,
there was significant variability in staining intensities across
tissue sections.8
In another collaborative effort on 381 patients with
advanced GEA, 20% had HER2-positive tumors with higher
rates in those with liver metastases and intestinal histolo-
gy.28 There was no difference in HER2 positivity between
resections/biopsies of primary (biopsies 21% versus resec-
tion 19%, P ¼ .791) or metastatic disease and no association
with prognosis. In another study of 178 patients with GEA,
there were 64 biopsy specimens and 60 gastrectomy
specimens for HER2 testing. The overall positivity rate was
20.2%. There was a significantly higher percentage of
patients with HER2 3þ expression in biopsy specimens than
in gastrectomy specimens (31.2% versus 8.8%, P ¼ .0003);
however, the concordance of overall HER2 status was 74.1%
between biopsy versus gastrectomy specimens. The biopsy
specimens also included a higher proportion of intestinal-
type tumors (70.3% versus 48.2%, P ¼ .003).
Tumor Specimens From Resected GEA
In a Japanese study,29 207 surgically resected tumors and
paired biopsy specimens from 158 patients with intestinal-
type gastric cancers were analyzed for HER2 overexpression/
amplification. In both specimen types, HER2 overexpression
was observed in 17% of cases, whereas gene amplification
was detected in 31% of the surgically resected tumors and
32% of biopsy specimens. Concordance between IHC and
FISH was 90.9% in the surgically resected tumors and 90.2%
in biopsy specimens. There was 72.7% concordance rate of
FISH between the surgical and biopsy specimens.29 Another
analysis of endoscopic biopsy compared to surgical samples
in evaluating HER2 status in GEA included 103 patients
with matched specimens.30 The concordance of IHC
between biopsy and surgical samples was 80% and 95%,
respectively. An Italian analysis of 61 consecutive pairs of
biopsy specimens and surgical specimens noted a concor-
dance of HER2 status of 91.8%.12 Heterogeneous expression
of HER2 protein in surgical specimens accounted for false-
negative cases. In conclusion, there are limited studies that
have compared matched pairs of biopsy versus resection
specimen(s) for HER2 expression/amplification and the
available results suggest a fair degree of concordance.
Tumor Specimens From Metastatic GEA
Multiple groups have investigated the status of HER2
expression in the primary tumor and metastatic lymph
nodes in the same patient.31–35 Qiu et al31 examined 100
6
Arch Pathol Lab Med
HER2 Testing in Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma—Bartley et al
 gastric cancers, in both primary tumors and corresponding
malignant lymph node metastases, using IHC (scoring
according to the criteria established by Hofmann et al13).
HER2 overexpression (defined in this study as 2þ or 3þ) was
noted in 33.0% of primary specimens and 39.4% of the
nodes. When HER2 status was compared in 2 or more
nodes, there was 25.3% discordance. However, in a study
that compared HER2 status in the metastatic lymph nodes
compared to primary tumor, IHC and silver in situ
hybridization (SISH) were used to compare HER2 status.32
The SISH results were comparable with a concordance of
92.5%. The prevalence of HER2 discordance was signifi-
cantly higher for tumors in the pN2 and pN3 categories (P ¼
.007).
Some have compared HER2 status between the primary
tumor specimen and synchronous metastatic specimens. In
one such study of 41 paired samples with 5 HER2-positive
tumors, there was a discrepancy observed in only 1 case.36
Another study assessing HER2 status in 68 paired samples
showed a 98.5% concordance of FISH results (n ¼ 68) and
94.9% concordance of IHC results (n ¼ 39).37 Only 1 case
was discordant, being negative in the primary tumor but
positive in the metastatic peripancreatic lymph node.
Others38 have also shown good concordance between liver
metastases (87.5%) and primary tumor. Thus, given the high
degree of concordance, HER2 testing on the primary tumor
or biopsy from a metastatic tumor deposit is appropriate.
Fine-Needle Aspiration or Cytology Specimen From
Primary or Metastatic Tumor
There are occasions when resection or biopsy of the
primary tumor or metastases may not be an option.
Although not preferred, HER2 testing performed on the
cell block of an FNA can be considered as an alternative.
Bozzetti et al37 compared metastatic FNA specimens and
noted HER2 amplification in 21% of specimens from the
metastatic lesions sampled by histology and in 9% of
cytology specimens. This difference was not ascribed to a
bias of cytology given that FISH results were entirely
concordant with those obtained on the histologic specimens
of the corresponding primary tumors. It is likely that the
discrepancy observed between the HER2-positive cases on
cytology and on histology may be related to the small
sample size.
Others39 have assessed HER2 status on specimens
obtained from malignant effusions by using both IHC and
SISH. Cell blocks from 46 effusions obtained from patients
with metastatic gastric carcinoma were examined. Immu-
nohistochemistry was scored with the modified criteria of
Hofmann et al.13 Results were compared with histologic
specimens to assess HER2 status concordance. Seven (15%)
showed an IHC 2þ/3þ reaction with a membranous pattern.
Three (7%) showed HER2 amplification on SISH. In 18 cases
(39%), HER2 status was compared with histologic speci-
mens, showing 100% concordance. The incidence of HER2
positivity (7% with SISHþ and IHC 2þ/3þ) was lower than
reported in histologic samples.
Given the issue of intratumoral heterogeneity in GEA
specimens, testing of multiple biopsy fragments (from a
primary or metastatic site), or from the resected primary
tumor, is preferred.13,40 If this is not an option, testing a
cytology specimen from an FNA cell block is acceptable.
However, the specimens obtained in cytology specimens
may not be truly representative given the limited sampling
of the tumor. For biopsy specimens, current recommenda-
tions state that, when possible, a minimum of 5 biopsy
specimens41 and optimally, 6 to 8, should be obtained to
account for intratumoral heterogeneity and to provide
sufficient tumor specimens for diagnosis and biomarker
testing, and this is also recommended by the NCCN
Guidelines.8,11,42 As well, if there is concern about the
adequacy of the specimen, it is recommended that
additional available primary or metastatic GEA tumor tissue
be tested.
3. Strong Recommendation.—Treating clinicians should
offer combination chemotherapy and HER2-targeted ther-
apy as the initial treatment for appropriate patients with
HER2-positive tumors who have advanced GEA.
(Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength of
recommendation: Strong)
HER2-targeted therapy was established in 2010 as a new
standard of care for the first-line treatment of patients with
advanced GEA with HER2-positive tumors. The results of
the ToGA trial (efficacy and safety) have been described
above.3 In addition, health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
and quality-adjusted time without symptoms of disease or
toxicity (Q-TWiST) were improved for patients who received
trastuzumab, with a prolonged time to 10% definitive
deterioration in all quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)–C30
and QLQ-STO22 scores and extended Q-TWiST by 2.42
months, compared with chemotherapy alone.43 Thus,
trastuzumab achieved a level-1 evidence for overall survival
advantage in patients with HER2-positive advanced GEA in
the first-line setting.11,44
In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
European Medicines Agency approved trastuzumab in
combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (5-
fluorouracil or capecitabine) for use in patients with
HER2-positive GEAs. NCCN Guidelines, however, recom-
mend the addition of trastuzumab to any active chemo-
therapy combination. In addition to the ToGA trial, smaller
trials combining trastuzumab with weekly paclitaxel (in
trastuzumab-naive patients) or capecitabine and oxaliplatin
have documented some efficacy, but these results are
supportive and not definitive.45 When adding trastuzumab
to a biweekly regimen (eg, oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimi-
dine), the loading dose should be 8 mg/kg and then 4 mg/kg
every 2 weeks.
With the establishment of HER2 testing as a standard of
care for patients with advanced GEA, it is important to note
that the treating clinician should not offer HER2-targeted
therapy until HER2 positivity is confirmed. Since patients
with advanced GEA can be symptomatic, it is recommended
to start combination cytotoxic therapy as soon as feasible
while waiting for the establishment of HER2 status. This
statement is based on expert opinion and based on the fact
that in the ToGA trial, of 810 patients with HER2-positive
tumors, 216 became ineligible (mainly due to deterioration
of performance status) while waiting for HER2 test results.
Once it is determined that GEA is HER2 positive,
trastuzumab can be added to the chemotherapy combina-
tion. There is no documented benefit for starting HER2-
directed treatment in the absence of confirmed HER2
positivity, and there is an added potential for the patient
to incur unnecessary side effects or costs. It is also
recommended that if there is documentation of a HER2-
positive result in any specimen (primary or metastatic
tumor), the treating clinician does not need to request
additional HER2 testing on additional tumor specimens.
Conversely, if there is no documentation of a HER2-positive
Arch Pathol Lab Med
HER2 Testing in Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma—Bartley et al
7
 result, and there is no available tumor tissue, an attempt
should be made to collect additional neoplastic tissue
(primary or metastatic) for HER2 testing. In addition, there
is currently no evidence to support repeating HER2 testing
after evidence of progression following HER2-directed
therapy (trastuzumab) combined with cytotoxic combina-
tion, and there is no evidence to support continuation of
trastuzumab beyond progression in patients with GEA. In
this regard, the TyTAN trial randomly assigned 262 patients
with advanced HER2-amplified gastric adenocarcinoma, in
the second-line setting, to lapatinib plus paclitaxel or
paclitaxel alone and reported no advantage in overall
survival for patients randomly assigned to lapatinib.46
Additionally, the LOGiC trial that randomly assigned 545
patients with HER2-amplified advanced GEA to lapatinib or
placebo plus capecitabine and oxaliplatin, in the first-line
setting, demonstrated no overall survival advantage for
patients who received lapatinib over those who received
placebo.47 Therefore, the efficacy of HER2-directed therapy
is demonstrated by trastuzumab only restricted to the first-
line setting. An algorithm for clinicians for HER2 testing in
patients with GEA is presented in Figure 1.
In summary, randomized clinical data support the use of
HER2-targeted therapy in combination with chemotherapy
for patients who are fit and able to tolerate treatment.
Addition of HER2-targeted therapy in patients with HER2-
positive GEA results in improved survival and quality of life.
Trastuzumab provides modest overall survival benefit for
patients with HER2-positive advanced GEA in the first-line
setting in combination with active cytotoxics.
4. Strong recommendation.—Laboratories/pathologists
must specify the antibodies and probes used for the test and
ensure that assays are appropriately validated for HER2 IHC
and ISH on GEA specimens.
(Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength of
recommendation: Strong)
Multiple antibodies are available for HER2 IHC (including
but not limited to Ventana 4B5 [Tucson, Arizona], Thermo
Fisher Scientific CB11 [Waltham, Massachusetts], Sigma-
Aldrich SP3 [St Louis, Missouri], Dako AO485 and Dako
HercepTest [Glostrup, Denmark]). Ventana 4B5, Thermo
Fisher Scientific CB11, and Dako HercepTest are FDA
approved.48 The ToGA trial3 used the HercepTest antibody,
and many studies30,49–53 have used 4B5 or CB11. There is
generally moderate to good concordance between various
antibodies,54–58 though several articles note stronger staining
for 4B5 than for other antibodies. However, no recommen-
dation is made for the use of a specific antibody.
Likewise, multiple methods for ISH have been evaluated
for HER2 in GEA. The Dako pharmaDx (Glostrup, Den-
mark) HER2 FISH kit was used for the ToGA trial,3 and
there is considerable experience with FISH in testing for
HER2 amplification in breast carcinomas. Development of
brightfield ISH technologies has resulted in several other
ISH methods, and 1 kit has obtained FDA approval (Dako
HER2 FISH pharmDx). One of these methods is SISH,
where either 1 HER2 slide, or 2 separate slides, are stained
for HER2 and chromosome enumeration probe (CEP) 17,
both using silver as the chromogen. The other major
brightfield ISH methods are chromogenic in situ hybridiza-

 tion and dual in situ hybridization, where either a nonsilver
chromogen alone is used or is used in combination with a
silver chromogen on a separate probe to mark both HER2
and CEP17 on 1 slide. The authors of multiple studies52,59–68
agree that these various ISH methods are comparable and
effective for GEA HER2 testing. There have been sugges-
tions that brightfield ISH techniques have some advantages
over FISH in that they can often be performed on automated
stainers, do not require fluorescence microscopes, and allow
for easier identification of tumor nuclei among normal
tissues.61,63 However, no recommendation is made regard-
ing the use of any specific ISH method, as there is no major
diagnostic advantage to one method over another.
While no recommendation regarding which specific
antibody/ISH methodology is given, there is a strong
recommendation regarding validation. If using a method
other than the FDA-approved kit, pathologists and labora-
tories should carefully validate both IHC and ISH for HER2,
and validation should be performed in the laboratory in
which the assay will be used. The cases used for validation
should be predominantly GEA cases as opposed to other
tumors (ie, breast carcinomas) to allow those scoring to
develop and maintain expertise with the different GEA
tumor types and appearances. CAP and/or Clinical Labo-
ratory Standards Institute guidelines should be followed for
assay validation.69–72
The method of sampling for the validation specimens (ie,
from resections or biopsies) should be similar to those
expected in future sampling, and should use the same
fixative. The CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program
(ANP.22978) for HER2 validation for breast carcinomas
proposes validation using 20 positive and 20 negative
specimens for an FDA-approved test, and 40 positive/40
negative cases if the test is a laboratory-developed test.73 If
using a brightfield ISH assay kit, initial validation should be
done by comparison to an FDA-approved FISH assay.17
Records of validation must be maintained as per the CAP
Laboratory
Accreditation
Program
(ANP.
22750,
ANP.22978, and ANP.22956).73 Laboratories must also
maintain good quality control. When reporting results, the
final HER2 test reports should specify the antibody used for
IHC and/or the probe used for ISH along with a brief
description of the kit/methodology.
5. Strong Recommendation.—When GEA HER2 status
is being evaluated, laboratories/pathologists should per-
form/order IHC testing first followed by ISH when IHC
result is 2þ (equivocal). Positive (3þ) or negative (0 or 1þ)
HER2 IHC results do not require further ISH testing.
(Quality of evidence: High; Strength of recommendation:
Strong)
The ToGA trial demonstrated that the combination of
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy significantly improved
survival in patients with tumors showing high HER2
expression.3 The latter was defined as HER2 score 3þ by
IHC or HER2 score 2þ by IHC and HER2 positivity
(amplified) by FISH. HER2-positive results by FISH were
observed in 11% of cases with IHC score 0 and 12% of cases
with IHC score 1þ.3 Similarly, other studies29,74–77 have
shown HER2 positivity by ISH in up to 14% to 24% of
tumors with IHC scores of 0 or 1þ. These patients did not
significantly benefit from the addition of trastuzumab to the
chemotherapy regimen in the ToGA trial.3 Similar findings
were reported in subsequent studies and reviews, demon-
strating that ISH positivity alone does not correlate with
response to trastuzumab therapy in GEA.8,78
NCCN Guidelines recommend that specimens with 2þ
expression of HER2 by IHC should be additionally assessed
by FISH or other ISH method. Specimens with 3þ
overexpression by IHC or FISH positivity (HER2: CEP17
ratio � 2) are considered positive.11 Specimens having an
IHC score of 0 or 1þ are considered negative and do not
warrant further testing. The concordance between IHC 3þ
and ISH positivity was high, with 94% concordance in the
ToGA trial and 62% to 100% in the literature, with most
reporting concordance of 90% or higher.3,8,29,74–78 Since the
benefit from the addition of HER2-directed therapy
correlates with HER2 protein expression, initial HER2
testing should be performed by IHC. In situ hybridization
should be reserved for IHC 2þ cases. In many stud-
ies,8,29,74,76,77 ISH-positive results have been observed in
30% to 50% of IHC 2þ tumors. Of note, there can be
interobserver variation in the interpretation of HER2 IHC,
and the reproducibility of 1þand 2þscores can be low. If the
IHC score is borderline and the distinction between 1þ and
2þ is challenging, HER2 ISH can be considered. However,
this approach is not recommended for cases that show an
obvious 1þ IHC score. In most cases, ISH is not indicated if
IHC scores are 0, 1þ, or 3þ. An algorithm for pathologists for
HER2 testing in patients with GEA is presented in Figure 2.
6. Strong Recommendation.—Pathologists should use
the Ruschoff/Hofmann method in scoring HER2 IHC and
ISH results for GEA.
(Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength of
recommendation: Strong)
The scoring system (Table 4) used in the ToGA trial and
subsequently modified for biopsies has been used in many
studies and has shown excellent correlation between IHC
and gene amplification methods.13,42 The IHC is subjectively
scored by using the established criteria on a 4-tiered scale as
0, 1þ, 2þ, and 3þ, with scores of 0 and 1þ considered
negative, 3þ as positive, and 2þ as equivocal. Representative
examples of IHC in GEA specimens are shown in Figure 3,
A through D. Similar to breast cancer, only membranous
staining, but not cytoplasmic staining, is considered for
HER2 scoring, but unlike breast carcinoma, complete
membranous staining is not required for positivity. Often
the luminal surface of tumor cells fails to stain in HER2-
amplified GEA. Only luminal surface staining in the absence
of lateral and basal staining is considered negative.
Assessment of IHC as weak, moderate, or strong for scoring
is similar to that used for breast carcinoma and is subjective
and thus can be a source of intraobserver and interobserver
variability. Scoring using automated image analysis or
virtual microscopy can be objective but has not been shown
to improve reproducibility.79 A few studies show good
concordance of image analysis with a visual method for
scoring HER2 IHC results; however, at this time there are
limited data to make a specific recommendation for or
against using image analysis for scoring HER2 in clinical
practice.34,79,80
Various in situ visualization techniques used to evaluate
HER2 amplification include FISH and brightfield ISH using
either HER2 probe or dual HER2 and centromere (CEP17)
probes, and all are acceptable strategies. At least 20
nonoverlapping nuclei of tumor cells are evaluated for
HER2 probe and CEP17 probe signal enumeration (Figure 4,
A through C). A ratio of HER2 signal to CEP17 signal of 2.0
or greater is considered positive and a ratio of HER2 signal
to CEP17 signal below 2.0 is considered negative. To score
ISH/FISH results, the scorer first scans the stained slide in all

Algorithm for pathologists. *Tumor cell cluster is defined as a cluster of 5 or more tumor cells. Additional recommendations: Pathologists
should ensure that biopsy or resection specimens used for HER2 testing are rapidly placed in fixative, ideally within 1 hour (cold ischemic time) and
are fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 6 to 72 hours. Routine histology processing and HER2 testing should be performed according to
analytically validated protocols. Pathologists should identify areas of invasive adenocarcinoma and also mark areas with strongest intensity of HER2
expression by IHC in the GEA specimen for subsequent scoring when ISH is required. Abbreviations: GEA, gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma; IHC,

 areas designated as invasive tumor to identify areas with
higher level HER2 amplification. In these areas, score both
amplified and adjacent nonamplified cells that have
cytomorphology consistent with malignant cells. Proceed
to score in areas marked as strongest IHC intensity, if this
information is available, since areas of overexpression may
signify gene amplification in heterogeneous tumors.8,42,81–83
Proceed to other invasive tumor areas until at least 20 cells
are scored. Extra (3 or more) copies of CEP17, on average,
were noted in 4.1% of gastric cancers in the ToGA trial. This
phenomenon has been referred to as ‘‘polysomy’’ but
technically is not polysomy in many cases, since the entire
chromosome is not duplicated. Rather, the extra copies of
CEP17 are due to an intrachromosomal segmental duplica-
tion overlapping the centromere of chromosome 17,
typically also involving the HER2 gene.84 In such cases,
there are often 4 to 6 copies of both HER2 and CEP17
signals with a ratio below 2.0.
If IHC is 2þ and there are 3 or more CEP17 signals, on
average, with a ratio below 2, then presence of more than 6
HER2 signals, on average, is interpreted as positive for HER2
amplification by ISH/FISH; fewer than 4 HER2 signals, on
average, is interpreted as negative for HER2 amplification;
and 4 to 6 signals, on average, indicates another 20 cells
should be scored in a different target area. If additional
scoring does not allow a definitive result to be rendered,
then multiple options are feasible: (1) consultation between
scorer and pathologist regarding selection of malignant cells
or tumor areas for scoring; (2) switching out CEP17 for an
alternative chromosome 17 probe in a retest to calculate the
ratio with a new probe; (3) selecting a different tumor block
for HER2 testing; (4) using genomics or an alternative
analytic method to evaluate HER2 amplification.
Of note, there are currently no definitive studies in the
literature on interpreting monosomy of CEP17 in GEA.
Furthermore, true monosomy for CEP17 is difficult to
distinguish from truncated cells in thin sections, and there
are no data on how to interpret CEP17 monosomy even if it
were confirmed by orthogonal methods. Until further data
are available, relying on the ratio of HER2 to CEP17 signals
remains a reasonable strategy for analyzing ISH/FISH
results.

 Each testing laboratory should specify the section
thickness required for HER2 ISH/FISH analysis. Section
thickness is especially important for single-probe assays in
which absolute counts per cell determine scoring, and is a
major reason why single-probe ISH methods are not
recommended. In contrast, dual-probe assays are recom-
mended because they rely on a ratio of HER2 to CEP17
signals, which are less affected by section thickness. We
recommend 4-lm-thick paraffin sections unless validation
studies demonstrate accurate results when using alternative
specimen preparation, or if an FDA-approved kit specifies
that another thickness be used. Thinner sections can yield
greater sampling error, fewer cells that qualify for scoring by
virtue of having at least 1 signal for each of the 2 probes, and
less intense counterstain. Thicker sections can lead to the
presence of overlapping nuclei and more difficulty with
deparaffinization, protease digestion, and probe or detection
reagent dispersion processes.
The exogenous control slide should be scored to ensure
that the assay protocol performed as expected. In each
patient specimen, ensure adequate staining and counter-
staining without background interference, overdigestion, or
other artifacts. Failure to detect probe signals in nonmalig-
nant cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, inflammatory cells,
benign epithelial cells) serves as an indicator of poor-quality
hybridization. At least some of these nonmalignant cells are
expected to have up to 2 copies per cell of HER2 and CEP17
discrete signals serving as a quality check for DNA
preservation, reagent perfusion, and sufficient signal to
noise ratio. In malignant-appearing cells, discrete signals are
enumerated, or an estimate of signal number is done when
there are numerous overlapping signals (clusters). Correla-
tion of the scored region(s) on the ISH slide with the tumor
cell population marked on the IHC slide is essential to
ensure that the scored cell population is tumor. In cases
where it is difficult to demarcate the tumor cell population
on the slide, direct pathologist review of the ISH slide and
comparison with the morphology of the tumor on the IHC
and hematoxylin-eosin–stained section is often necessary.
Interpret the HER2 test result as indeterminate if technical
issues prevent reporting as positive or negative. Examples of
technical failures include improper specimen preparation or
handling, quality checks outside acceptable limits, or artifact
interfering with analysis or microscopy. Several manufac-
turers market reagents for HER2 ISH, but as of the date of
this publication only 1 manufacturer has FDA approval for
GEA (Dako, eg, HER2 IQFISH pharmDx). The HER2 FISH
pharmDx test used in the ToGA trial is no longer available.
Manufacturer’s instructions are often helpful for guiding
analysis and interpretation of results. In the practice-
changing ToGA trial, Hofmann et al13 recommended
modifications to the duration of pepsin and that tempera-
ture stability should be achieved during pretreatment.
7. Recommendation.—Pathologists should select the
tissue block with the areas of lowest grade tumor
morphology in biopsy and resection specimens. More than
1 tissue block may be selected if different morphologic
patterns are present.
(Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength of
recommendation: Recommendation/Moderate)
As mentioned previously, studies show that HER2
overexpression is strongly associated with intestinal pheno-
type, and less frequently with diffuse (signet ring cell)
phenotype of GEA. The rates of HER2 positivity vary for
intestinal (3%–23.5%), diffuse (0%–6%), and mixed histol-
ogy (0%–20%) cancers.36,85–88 Gastroesophageal adenocar-
cinoma has rare morphologic phenotypes that include
adenosquamous, papillary, and neuroendocrine carcino-
mas,74 but data regarding HER2 expression in such
morphologic variants are limited. Most studies8–10,57,86 have

HER2 Testing in Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma—Bartley et al
 the stomach (32.2% versus 21.4%). Correlation of HER2
expression and/or amplification with histologic grade is
difficult to ascertain, as studies have used different methods
including 2- to 4-tiered grading systems. Further, most
studies do not specify the criteria used for grading, and
grading is subjective. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer recommends using a 3-tiered system of well
differentiated (G1), moderately differentiated (G2), and
poorly differentiated (G3). Rare undifferentiated carcinomas
are classified as G3 in this system. HER2 positivity seems to
be more strongly associated with low-grade than high-
grade tumors and varies from 15% to 45% for low-grade,
and 6% to 28% for high-grade, in different studies.36,86,89–91
When choosing a tissue block, selecting one with the lower
grade or intestinal morphology appears more likely to yield
HER2-positive results and is thus recommended. If the
cancer comprises substantially different grades or histologic
patterns, it is reasonable to test different areas, which may
require selection of more than 1 block.
8. Strong Recommendation.—Laboratories should re-
port HER2 test results in GEA specimens in accordance with
the CAP ‘‘Template for Reporting Results of HER2 (ERBB2)
Biomarker Testing of Specimens From Patients With
Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach or Esophagogastric Junc-
tion.’’ 92
(Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength of
recommendation: Strong)
The synoptic content of this template lists essential
reporting elements. Element selection and the manner in
which these elements are reported are at the discretion of
the medical professional who issues the report. Key
elements are listed in Table 5. The report should include a
brief Methods section describing the kit or the critical
reagents and instruments used. For a gene test, include the
correct gene symbol (ERBB2) as approved by the Human
Genome Organization Nomenclature Committee, following
the colloquial symbol (HER2 [ERBB2]). The ‘‘number of
observers’’ refers to the number of laboratory professionals
who performed scoring for ISH or the number who further
interpreted the results of any automated scoring system. The
reporting professional is responsible for assuring quality of
the result via analytic interpretation of raw data and via use
of validated protocols for preanalytic and analytic phases of
testing.93,94 Published guidance from the CAP describes
general report elements promoting accurate communication
of test results.95,96
9. Strong recommendation.—Pathologists should iden-
tify areas of invasive adenocarcinoma and also mark areas
with strongest intensity of HER2 expression by IHC in GEA
specimens for subsequent ISH scoring when required.
(Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength of
recommendation: Strong)
This recommendation is intended to provide guidance on
which parts of the slide to prioritize when scoring cells in
ISH assays. Accurate ISH results scoring depends on 3
aspects of preanalytic histopathologic features that help
localize regions to score: (1) areas of invasive tumor, (2)
areas of intense HER2 overexpression as visualized on IHC,
and (3) cytomorphology of the malignancy to help select
individual cells for scoring. Areas of invasive carcinoma are
identified on hematoxylin-eosin–stained sections adjacent
to the unstained section used for hybridization. If there are
distinct and separate histologic patterns of malignancy,
different areas can be marked for ISH scoring, although
there are few data to suggest that outcome is improved by
separate scoring of each histologic subtype. More important
is that invasive cancer is marked so that the scorer may scan
these areas to identify regions enriched for amplification to
prioritize for scoring.
Heterogeneity typically refers to intratumor variation in
genotype or gene expression. In gastric cancers, this term is
used when there is focal positivity by IHC or ISH. Ideally, a
HER2 IHC stain of the same block used for ISH should be
reviewed to find areas of maximum HER2 intensity
irrespective of histologic subtype or grade. False positivity
can be seen in areas of intestinal metaplasia, adjacent to
ulcer sites, or in high-grade dysplasia, and these lesions

 should be avoided. Crush artifact and necrotic tissue also
should be avoided. Areas with strongest IHC intensity may
signify gene amplification in heterogeneous tumors.8,42,81–83
Good communication between the histopathologist and
the scorer is critical for resolving difficult interpretations. If
the proportion of malignant cells (as a proportion of all
nucleated cells in the marked area) is low, the pathologist
should communicate this to the ISH laboratory and mention
this in the report, since low tumor cell content reduces
confidence in the ISH results. The pathologist should also
note the pattern of malignant cells (glands versus diffuse,
sheets of tumor cells versus interspersed benign inflamma-
tory/stromal cells) and the shape and relative size of the
malignant cell nuclei (round versus oval, medium versus
large) to assist scorers in identifying those malignant cells
after hybridization and counterstaining. The goal is to
maximize the proportion of malignant cells scored, while
minimizing the proportion of nonmalignant cells scored.
Morphologic evaluation of ISH stains helps resolve prob-
lematic interpretations due to overfixation or underfixation,
delayed fixation with or without tissue-drying artifacts,
inadequate deparaffinization, or predicting the value of
repeating the test using shorter or longer protease digestion
duration.
Tissue architecture and cytology are often better visual-
ized in brightfield ISH than FISH, so in brightfield ISH the
morphologic features of malignant cells are typically more
distinguishable from those of benign cells, potentially
improving the signal to noise ratio. However, compared to
immunostains, brightfield ISH may suffer from less crisp
histopathology because of the protease digestion required
to promote probe dispersion into nuclei, and because of
the near-boiling heat required to achieve DNA denatur-
ation. The FISH signals are often brighter and easier to
count than are brightfield ISH signals.97 Nevertheless, as
stated previously, ISH and FISH results are generally
concordant in GEA,59,61,65,98,99 and either method is
considered acceptable.
10. Strong Recommendation.—Laboratories must in-
corporate GEA HER2 testing methods into their overall
laboratory quality improvement program, establishing
appropriate quality improvement monitors as needed to
ensure consistent performance in all steps of the testing and
reporting process. In particular, laboratories performing
GEA HER2 testing should participate in a formal proficiency
testing program, if available, or an alternative proficiency
assurance activity.
(Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength of
recommendation: Strong)
While a HER2-expressing breast specimen may be initially
used as the positive control,17 validation of actual GEA
specimens is preferred, when such appropriate specimens
are available. Gastric cancer cell lines with HER2 expression
may be used as the positive control100 when a sufficient
number of actual GEA specimens are unavailable, and the
procedure should be specified and documented, since it may
differ from those of breast. Checklists for recording positive
and negative controls for each test should be incorporated
into the laboratory quality improvement program (CAP or
other available local programs). Given the heterogeneity of
HER2 reactivity in GEA,74,75,85,101–104 laboratories may
consider tracking their own statistics of HER2 results in
GEA, including interobserver reproducibility between pa-
thologists and the histologic subtypes, which may facilitate a
better understating of the relevant issues in HER2 testing in
GEA.105–109 Continuing education of pathologists who report
on HER2 GEA specimens is important, especially in
laboratories performing limited numbers of GEA specimens
in comparison to breast specimens.
11. No Recommendation.—There is insufficient evidence
to recommend for or against genomic testing in patients
with GEA at this time.
In addition to IHC and ISH, other techniques have been
used to determine HER2 status. These technologies include
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-nucleotide poly-
morphism chip, comparative genomic hybridization array,
gene expression profiling by RNAseq or microarray,
targeted/exome/whole genome sequencing, or proteo-
mics.84,110 Most studies comparing these technologies to
standard HER2 test methods have been carried out in breast
cancer.111 High concordance has been demonstrated for
HER2 status in GEA with droplet digital PCR, when
compared with IHC and FISH.112 Gene expression profiling
using 8 transcripts has been shown to predict response to
trastuzumab- and docetaxel-based chemotherapy in GEA
with HER2 overexpression.113
Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification is a
multiplex PCR technique that simultaneously quantifies
several gene segments. This technique can be used to
interpret whether the HER2 region of the chromosome is
amplified compared to control regions of chromosome 17.114
However, the control regions are difficult to select given that
segmental amplifications of chromosome 17, or polysomy
17, may or may not be present in a given tumor.
Furthermore, when tissue is ground up to carry out nucleic
acid extraction, varying proportions of nucleic acid from
malignant and benign cells are represented in the assay, in
comparison to IHC and ISH where cytologic and morpho-
logic features may help limit interpretation of malignant
cells. Thus, the criteria for interpreting gene amplification
are difficult to set when using genomic technology. Ideally,
the criteria for tissue selection for analysis, and for
interpretation of genomic test results, would be validated
with tissues from drug responders versus nonresponders.
At this time, the main utility for genomic testing is to help
classify cases that are uninterpretable with standard IHC or
ISH technology, such as in the setting of borderline
amplification with or without extra centromere 17 signals
by ISH.114 Currently, however, there is insufficient evidence
to provide recommendations for or against the routine use
of genomic technologies for purposes of qualifying for
HER2-targeted therapy.
OTHER GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
Tissue Fixation and Processing
Pathologists should ensure that biopsy or resection
specimens used for HER2 testing are rapidly placed in
fixative, ideally within 1 hour (cold ischemic time) and are
fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 6 to 72 hours.
Routine histology processing, and HER2 testing, should be
performed according to analytically validated protocols, and
laboratories should establish policies to ensure efficient
allocation and utilization of tissue for ancillary testing,
particularly in small specimens. Validation studies must
address preanalytic factors supporting the stated range of
acceptable tissue preparations (eg, 10% neutral buffered
formalin, alcohol fixatives, decalcification, air-dried smears,
formalin–post fixation). Laboratories should test a sufficient
14
Arch Pathol Lab Med
HER2 Testing in Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma—Bartley et al
 number of GEA cases to ensure that assays consistently
achieve expected results.
Gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma specimens need
prompt fixation for ideal histology, IHC, and ISH testing.
Biopsy specimens should be immediately placed into
formalin in the endoscopy suite. Pathologists should
communicate with gastroenterology colleagues to ensure
prompt fixation and documentation. Surgical specimens
require prompt specimen transport and opening of the
specimen (by pathologist or appropriately trained person-
nel) to ensure prompt exposure of the tumor to adequate
volumes of 10% neutral buffered formalin. Surgical speci-
mens may need to first be inked, the tumor incised, and the
specimen pinned on a cork or wax board to facilitate
fixation. Pathologists should work with surgeons, nurses,
and/or operating room personnel to facilitate recording of
surgical specimen ischemic time and appropriate han-
dling.115
Considerations regarding tissue ischemic and fixation
time follow from principles of proteolytic degradation and
fixation chemistry,115,116 with data drawn mostly from the
breast cancer literature.16,17,115,117
There is a need for direct data regarding the impact of
ischemic time (time from specimen removal from the
patient to fixation) and fixation time (time tumor is exposed
to adequate volumes of formalin) on HER2 testing in GEA.
One model using gastric cancer cell lines of known HER2
expression xenografted into mice demonstrated decreased
IHC staining with delayed fixation of 6 and 24 hours with
the Hercept test, and decreased HER2 to CEP17 FISH ratios,
as compared to immediate fixation.100 This delayed fixation
resulted in negative IHC and FISH interpretation for several
samples with expected 2þ IHC staining and HER2 to CEP17
ratio of 2.3 (SHC cell line). Unfortunately, ischemic intervals
between 0 and 6 hours were not tested.100 This same study
demonstrated no effect of prolonged fixation of 5 and 7 days
as compared to 24-hour fixation, but noted diminished IHC
staining with 10-day fixation or use of fixatives other than
10% neutral buffered formalin.100
Full validation of the HER2 testing protocol should be
performed for formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
specimens, as described previously in Recommendation 4.
Discussion of limited available data for alternatively fixed or
decalcified specimens is provided below.
Regarding cytologic specimens, we are aware of a single
small study (mentioned previously) of HER2 testing in
gastric cancer effusion specimens (formalin-fixed plasma
thrombin clots), which demonstrated concordance with
tissue specimens in all of 18 cases, but acknowledged more
granularity of HER2 staining, and difficulty in interpreting
membrane staining in discohesive tumor preparations.39 A
sampling of studies comparing cytologic cell block prepa-
rations with FFPE breast carcinoma specimens evaluated for
HER2 by immunohistochemistry demonstrates 87% to
100% positive agreement and 66% to 100% negative
agreement (excluding 2þequivocal scores)39,118–124; however,
one small study exploring ethanol, cytolyte, and formalin-
fixed cytologic breast cancer specimens is calculated to have
only 14% to 40% positive agreement and 100% negative
agreement with matched FFPE breast tissue samples (again
excluding 2þ scores).125 Several studies39,120,122 reported
false-positive interpretations, some attributed to cytoplas-
mic background staining.
There are wide differences in the handling and processing
of cytologic preparations between studies and between
laboratories (eg, proprietary fixative, alcohol-based fixative,
alternative fixative followed by formalin fixation, direct
formalin fixation),39,118–122,125,126 and effects vary by antigen/
antibody.127 This further emphasizes the need for appropri-
ate evaluation of HER2 staining of cytologic specimens in
individual laboratories before testing and reporting patient
samples. Nonformalin fixatives also have complexities for
HER2 ISH testing,122,128,129 yet several studies123,124,130 have
shown good results with HER2 FISH on cytologic breast
cancer specimens.
Diminished IHC staining occurs after decalcification with
a variety of antigen-antibody combinations,127,131 yet studies
of HER2 antibodies are lacking. Prolonged hydrochloric
acid–based decalcification after formalin fixation was shown
to have deleterious effects on the HER2 ISH assay in a breast
tumor and xenograft study.129 Again, decalcification proto-
cols vary widely among laboratories, reinforcing the need
for local assay evaluation. While it remains impractical to
fully validate every specimen variation (cytology, decalcifi-
cation), laboratories should confirm test performance of
HER2 assays on these types of specimens before reporting
patient results (with testing paradigm to be determined by
the laboratory director, based on local practices).
Turnaround Time
Laboratories must provide clinically appropriate turn-
around times and optimal utilization of tissue specimens by
using appropriate techniques (IHC and ISH) for HER2 in
GEA. To inform therapeutic decision making, HER2 results
should be reported promptly. The panel recommends a
benchmark of 90% of reports available within 10 working
days from the date of procedure or specimen acquisition.
Laboratories that require send out of tests for HER2 testing
in GEA should process and send specimens to reference
laboratories in a timely manner. The panel suggests that a
benchmark of 90% of specimens be sent to the reference
laboratory within 3 working days of tissue processing.
CONCLUSIONS
Gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma continues to be a
major health care burden throughout the world. Advanced
GEA that is not amenable to effective local therapy remains
incurable and patients have limited therapeutic options.
Other than HER2, there is no biomarker available for
selection of therapy for patients with advanced GEA.
Trastuzumab is the only approved HER2-directed therapy
that has resulted in modest but statistically significant
prolongation of overall survival of patients with HER2-
positive GEA.
Given the potential impact of HER2 status on therapeutic
decision making in GEA, clear guidance is needed for
medical oncologists and pathologists in testing for, and
interpretation of, HER2 status. A guideline specific for GEA
was needed because, although a comparable guideline
exists for assessment of HER2 in breast cancer, the pattern
of HER2 protein overexpression and/or gene amplification
in GEA is distinctly different. Because of considerable
heterogeneity of HER2 protein and gene expression in
GEAs, scoring methodology for GEA is different than for
breast cancer. To develop this evidence-based guideline for
HER2 testing, the CAP, ASCP, and ASCO convened a
multidisciplinary panel with broad expertise in the clinical
and pathologic aspects of GEA. The panel developed a set
of 11 recommendations that are pertinent to various
Arch Pathol Lab Med
HER2 Testing in Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma—Bartley et al
15
 aspects of establishing HER2 status. The guideline provides
evidence-based recommendations for specimen identifica-
tion, processing, testing methodology for IHC and ISH,
interpretation of results, and the potential for clinical
implementation.
The guideline recommends that HER2 status should be
established in all patients with advanced GEA who are
eligible for systemic (and especially HER2-directed) therapy.
Tumor specimens from primary or metastatic GEA may be
used for assessment. Testing should begin with IHC. If the
result is negative (0 or 1þ) or positive (3þ), no further testing
is required. If the result is equivocal (2þ) by IHC, subsequent
testing by ISH should be performed to determine amplifi-
cation status. Patients whose tumor is considered HER2
positive (IHC 3þ or IHC 2þ and ISH positive/amplified)
should be informed of the results, and HER2-directed
therapy should be offered along with combination chemo-
therapy. Although the guideline recommends that HER2
status should be assessed in all patients with advanced GEA,
it is acknowledged that some patients are not candidates for
systemic therapy owing to poor general condition and poor
performance status. In such patients, HER2 testing is not
required. There are other circumstances where the HER2
status in a given patient is unclear owing to technical aspects
(inadequate tumor or inability to adequately interpret the
processed specimen) on a prior attempt. In these circum-
stances, collection of an additional tumor specimen is
recommended but only when there are no major safety
concerns associated with such a procedure.
Finally, as the fields of genomics, proteomics, and
biotechnology continue to evolve, novel and more accurate
methods of assessing HER2 status may become available.
Similarly, as more clinical trials are conducted on HER2-
directed therapy in GEA, changes in treatment algorithms
may necessitate updates to these recommendations in the
future.
