Adaptation of Stability during 
Perturbed Walking in Parkinson’s 
Disease
Dario Martelli1, Lan Luo2, Jiyeon Kang1, Un Jung Kang2, Stanley Fahn2 & Sunil K. Agrawal1,3
Gait and balance disorders are major problems that contribute to falls among subjects with Parkinson’s 
disease (PD). Strengthening the compensatory responses through the use of balance perturbations 
may improve balance in PD. To date, it is unclear how PD affects the ability to react and adapt to 
perturbations delivered while walking. This study aims to investigate how PD affects the ability to walk, 
respond to balance perturbations, and produce acute short-term effects to improve compensatory 
reactions and gait stability. A cable-driven robot was used to train nine patients with PD and nine 
age-matched controls with multidirectional waist-pull perturbations while walking on a treadmill. 
Margin of stability and base of support were evaluated while walking without cables and reacting to 
the perturbations. PD was associated with a reduced stability in the forward direction and the inability 
to produce proactive anticipatory adjustments. Both groups were able to improve the response 
to the disturbances and produce short-term aftereffects of increased gait stability once the cables 
were removed. A single session of perturbation-based balance training produced acute effects that 
ameliorated gait instability in PD. This result is encouraging for designing new therapeutic interventions 
that remediate falls risk.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results primarily from a progressive loss of substan-
tia nigra neurons within the basal ganglia that produce dopamine, an important neurotransmitter involved in the 
regulation of movement1. Individuals with PD commonly experience gait and balance disorders which contribute 
to falls, mobility loss, reduced independence and quality of life2–4. Balance impairment is difficult to treat with 
dopaminergic medication, which suggests a contribution by non-dopaminergic lesions5. In some cases, exercise 
and motor training can improve the performance of balance-related activities3. Nevertheless, there is no evidence 
that these improvements translate into prevention of falls3. This may be due to the fact that current training meth-
ods fail to target the specific neuromuscular skills required for fall prevention6.
With the aim to develop new methods that identify the causes of compromised balance in PD and to design 
specific pharmacological or training methods that help to reduce balance impairments, several groups have aimed 
to characterize and strengthen the control of the compensatory responses required after a balance perturba-
tion7–11. The underlying hypothesis in these studies is that exposure to repeated perturbations can lead partic-
ipants to better correct their loss of balance during the recovery phase (i.e., adaptation of the reactive strategy) 
and modify the volitional control of stability in face of a possible perturbation (i.e., adaptation of the proactive 
strategy). As a consequence, participants may show improved recovery after unexpected loss of balance encoun-
tered in daily life and, consequently, reduce their falls risk.
Generally, modifications of the neural, sensory and musculoskeletal systems in PD make the protective motor 
behaviors that counteract the lack of balance less effective, thus increasing the risk of falling12–16. However, poten-
tial for adaptation to motor training seems to be intact. By exposing patients to repeated controlled postural 
disturbances, the overall motor response against balance loss and their control of stability can be improved7–11. In 
the long term, the outcomes of multiple training sessions could be promising in terms of remediation of fall risk 
factors17 and reduction of falls18–21 in people with PD.

Despite the fact that most falls in PD are reported during walking22 and gait disorders are one of the hallmarks 
of PD23–25, the preceding literature is primarily focused on responses to balance perturbations delivered while 
standing. The role of the basal ganglia in motor learning, however, may be task dependent26.
Our group at Columbia University has developed the Active-Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (A-TPAD), an 
innovative cable-driven robot conceived for gait rehabilitation (Fig. 1)27–29. The A-TPAD consists of a lightweight 
belt worn by a participant on the pelvis to which several wires are attached. Desired forces and moments can be 
applied in any direction of the space and at precise time points in the gait cycle without adding inertia and rigid 
links to the human body. To date, it has been successfully used to improve gait in stroke survivors30 and in chil-
dren with cerebral palsy31 by applying continuous forces at the waist-level. In this study, the A-TPAD was used 
to apply unpredictable force-controlled waist-pull perturbations for a short time duration. Previous experiments 
with healthy young subjects showed that a single session of perturbation-based balance training (PBT) was ben-
eficial to improve gait stability29,32.
The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent PD affects the ability to walk, respond to balance per-
turbations, and produce acute short-term effects to improve compensatory reactions and control of unperturbed 
walking balance. We believe that the understanding of the mechanism of compensation and neuroplasticity to 
unexpected repeated perturbations during walking can fill an important gap in the current literature and have 
positive implications on the treatment of PD by helping to design effective training paradigms that remediate 
falls risk.
Methods
Participants. 
Nine subjects with idiopathic PD and nine healthy age-matched controls (HC) participated in 
the study. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The exper-
imental protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Columbia University. All subjects 
Figure 1. Experimental Setup. Schematic of the Active Tethered Assistive Pelvic Device (A-TPAD) and a 
picture of a participant walking with it. Four single-phase AC servo motors, powered in torque mode, are 
mounted on an inertial rigid frame and connected through low-stretch nylon-coated stainless steel wires 
and pulleys to a fabric hip belt worn by the subject. A load cell calibrated to record up to 890 N and a spring 
of stiffness 2.5 N/mm are installed in series with each cable to measure in real-time the instantaneous cable 
tension and reduce output impedance. A closed-loop controller ensures delivery of the correct tensions in the 
motors. Cables are routed using pulleys which are diagonally-directed. Waist-pull perturbations are provided by 
applying a transient force pulse on one or two of the four cables while walking at constant speed on a split-belt 
treadmill instrumented with two three-dimensional force plates (Bertec Instrumented Teadmill). A ten-camera 
motion capture system (Vicon Bonita-10 series) and force plates are used as a part of the controller. The motion 
capture system is used to track the cable attachment locations during a 30 seconds long calibration trial. The 
angle of each cable with respect to the fixed frame is recorded and averaged between steps for each time point 
of interest. In this way, a suitable cable tension value can be applied at each motor such that a resultant force 
of a desired amplitude proportional to the subject’s body weight (BW) is applied to the pelvis in the desired 
direction. The force plates are used to calculate the vertical Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs). This data is used 
to detect in real time gait events such as toe-off and heel strike (threshold at 50 N). These are used to time the 
application of perturbations in a repeatable and controlled way. When cables were attached to the subject, before 
giving the actual perturbation, a constant force of 25 N was applied by each motor to prevent cable slackening. 
The controller is implemented in Labview (National Instrument, PXI real time system).

were informed about the research procedure and signed a written consent form approved by the IRB before 
participation.
Patients with PD were in the clinically ‘on’ state, approximately one hour after their last dose of dopaminergic 
medication. The severity of Parkinson’s disease was determined by a movement disorder specialist using the 
Hoehn and Yahr scale (H&Y)33 and the motor subscale of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder 
Society-Sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS Part III)34. The average 
time over three trials to complete the Time Up and Go Test (TUG) and the 5-Meter Walk Test (5MWT) at partic-
ipants’ comfortable walking speeds was used to assess ambulatory function.
Experimental Setup and Protocol. 
Experimental sessions were carried out using the A-TPAD. Details on 
its design and control can be found in previous studies from our group27–29. Figure 1 shows the different compo-
nents of the A-TPAD and a picture of a patient with PD walking on the treadmill with it.
Figure 2 shows the experimental protocol. Participants first walked on the treadmill for 5 minutes (GAIT 
PRE). Successively, the cables were attached to the brace. At the beginning, subjects were exposed to 10 posterior 
diagonal perturbations with peak amplitude of 15% of the body weight (BW) (TEST PRE). Then, participants 
were trained with 9 blocks of 8 antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) perturbations of increasing inten-
sities (TRAINING). Three amplitudes were used (low, medium, and high). They were equal to 15%, 20% and 25% 
for AP perturbations and 5%, 10%, and 15% BW for ML perturbations. The range of intensity of the perturba-
tions was determined based on previous experiments with healthy young subjects35. Before removing the cables, 
all subjects were exposed to the same set of diagonal perturbations delivered before the training session (TEST 
POST). Then, cables were removed, and all subjects walked for another 5 minutes (GAIT POST). Data collected 
during the last minute of GAIT PRE and the first and last minutes of GAIT POST were used in the analysis and 
were labeled as baseline, early and late post training (BL, EPT and LPT). Participants were aware that they could 
be perturbed at the waist when the cables were attached, but were not informed about the magnitude, direction, 
or timing of the perturbations. Before the intervention started, they were instructed to try to maintain balance 
and keep walking.
Preferred walking speed was determined before the beginning of the experiment by gradually increasing the 
speed by 0.1 m/s until the subject reported that the speed was too fast and then reducing it by 0.1 m/s. Once 
determined, the walking speed was maintained constant during the experiment. In order to reduce the risk of 
fatigue, the treadmill was stopped every three blocks during the training session and the subjects were told that 
they could rest at any time if they felt fatigued. Over the duration of the experiment, subjects wore a safety har-
ness that prevented them from falling, while not restricting their movements. The entire training session lasted 
approximately 30 minutes.
Data Analysis. 
The trajectories of 55 reflective markers were collected at 200 Hz using a 10-camera motion 
capture system (Vicon Bonita-10 series). Marker placement was similar to reference36. The 3D marker trajectories

Successively, the cables were attached to the brace. At the beginning, subjects were exposed to 10 posterior 
diagonal perturbations (TEST PRE). Perturbations consisted of 5 pulls with Motor 2 (back-right perturbation) 
triggered at right heel strike (RHS) and 5 pulls with Motor 4 (back-left perturbation) triggered at left heel strike 
(LHS) (Fig. 1, left panel). The first perturbation was delivered at RHS and then the order of perturbations was 
alternated. Peak force was fixed at 15% BW. Then, participants were trained with 9 blocks of 8 Antero-Posterior 
(AP) and Medio-Lateral (ML) perturbations of increasing intensities (TRAINING). 4 directions (Anterior – A; 
Posterior – P; Medial – M; Lateral – L), and 2 events (LHS; RHS) were used. At the beginning, the peak force 
was 15% BW and 5% BW for AP and ML perturbations, respectively. Every three blocks, the peak force was 
increased by 5% BW. The order of the perturbations in each block was chosen randomly. Time to complete 
each block was approximately 2 minutes. Before removing the cables, all subjects were exposed to the same set 
of diagonal perturbations delivered before the training session (TEST POST). Then, cables were removed, and 
all subjects walked for another 5 minutes (GAIT POST). Data collected during the last minute of GAIT PRE 
and the first and last minutes of GAIT POST were used in the analysis and were labeled as baseline, early and 
late post training (i.e., BL, EPT and LPT). All perturbations were delivered while walking at constant speed and 
consisted of a trapezoidal force profile (rise, hold and fall times of 150 ms duration each). The number of steps 
between perturbations was randomized (10–15 steps).

were low-pass filtered with a cut-off frequency of 10 Hz using a fourth-order, zero-lag, Butterworth filter. Marker 
positions were used to define a 13-segment biomechanical model, similar to our previous studies32,35–38.
Heel strikes were determined when the vertical position of the lateral malleolus marker did not change by 
more than 2 mm in two consecutive time values39. To be consistent, all time events used in the analysis, including 
perturbation onset, were calculated using the kinematic data.
The effectiveness of the countermeasures to maintain balance are critically dependent on the individual’s abil-
ity to regulate the relationship between the body’s center of mass (CoM) and the base of support (BoS)37,38. The 
BoS in the AP/ML direction was estimated using the 4 markers attached on each foot (specifically calcaneus, tip 
of the toe, first and fifth metatarsals) as the difference between the most forward/lateral marker of the foot that 
completed the swing phase and the most backward/lateral marker of the contralateral foot. The AP and ML BoSs 
were used to quantify step length and step width, respectively. The 3D trajectory of the body’s CoM was calculated 
as the weighted sum of the 13 segments’ CoMs. Dynamic stability was determined using the margin of stability 
(MoS)40. The MoS in the AP/ML direction was quantified with respect to the last foot that completed the swing 
phase as:

where BoSMax is the anterior or lateral boundary of the BoS, estimated by the position of the tip of the toe or the 
fifth metatarsal in the AP and ML directions, respectively. The XCoM is the position of the extrapolated CoM and 
represents the state of the CoM taking into account both its position and velocity41. The AP and ML components 
of the XCoM were computed as:

where CoMAP,ML and VCoMAP
,ML are the AP or ML position and velocity of the CoM, hCoM is the estimated pen-
dulum length (instantaneous distance between the body CoM and the ankle joint of the leading leg) and g is the 
gravitational acceleration. The treadmill speed was added to the VCoMAP
42. Noticeably, a larger MoS is associated 
with a higher stability.
During unperturbed gait, outcome measures were quantified by the average values calculated at the first 20 
right heel strikes of BL, EPT and LPT. During the compensatory reaction, outcome measures were calculated 
during the perturbations delivered at right heel strike. Two time events were identified: perturbation onset (PON) 
and the compensatory heel strike (CHS – first heel strike after PON). MoSPON and BoSPON were used to identify 
pre-perturbation stability and possible proactive adaptations in the gait pattern. It must be noted that at PON the 
applied forces are still at zero. MoSCHS and BoSCHS were used to identify post-perturbation stability and possible 
reactive adaptations to the early compensatory reaction.
Statistical Analysis. 
Potential differences in anthropometric measures (age, height, weight, and gender), 
ambulatory functions (time to complete the TUG and overground speed in the 5MWT) and preferred tread-
mill walking speed between the two groups were investigated by independent samples t-tests or Mann Whitney 
U Test, when appropriate. Data was analyzed by means of mixed design repeated-measures ANOVAs. During 
unperturbed gait, main and simple interaction effects of group (2 levels, PD and HC) and session (3 levels: BL, 
EPT and LPT) were analyzed. During training, main effect of group (2 levels, PD and HC) and simple interaction 
effects between group and direction (4 levels: Anterior, Posterior, Medial and Lateral), amplitude (3 levels: Low, 
Medium and High), and repetition (3 levels: R1-R3) were examined using the outcomes at CHS as dependent 
measures. During the test, main and simple interaction effects of group (2 levels, PD and HC), session (2 levels: 
PRE and POST), and repetition (5 levels: R1-R5) were investigated using the outcomes at PON and CHS as 
dependent measures. For all analysis, group was the only between-subject factor. If significant, main and interac-
tion effects were followed up by pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni’s correction. The Lilliefors, Levene’s and 
Mauchly’s tests were performed to check the normality, homoscedasticity and sphericity assumptions of data. 
The Huynd-Feldt correction was applied if data violated the sphericity condition. Statistical significance was set 
at p < 0.05.

Results
The two groups exhibited similar (p > 0.230) anthropometric measures, ambulatory function and preferred tread-
mill walking speed (Table 1). PD patients enrolled were in mild disease states: the H&Y stages ranged from 1 to 
233 and the MDS-UPDRS Part III scores ranged from 8 to 2543 (Table 1). After the perturbation, all participants 
were able to recover their balance without falling. All except two participants completed the experiment without 
difficulty: two PD subjects did not perform the third block of training due to fatigue.
Unperturbed Gait. 
Figure 3 reports the results of unperturbed walking without cables (GAIT PRE & POST 
in Fig. 2). The AP MoS showed a significant main effect of group (p = 0.044), such that PD patients always walked 
with a lower AP MoS than HCs.
The exposure to repeated perturbations during training produced short-term aftereffects such that when 
cables were removed the gait pattern was modified. Indeed, the AP MoS (p = 0.002), the AP BoS (p = 0.002), and 
the ML BoS (p = 0.003) showed a significant main effect of the session. Modifications in the gait pattern were 
accounted for by a greater AP BoS and AP MoS and a reduced ML BoS. Post-hoc analysis revealed that both 
groups increased the AP BoS and AP MoS at EPT (AP MoS: p = 0.002; AP BoS: p = 0.009). At LPT, the AP MoS

was still higher with respect to BL (p = 0.023) while the AP BoS did not show significant differences (p = 0.082) 
compared to BL. Both groups reduced their ML BoS at LPT (p = 0.002) compared to BL. Also at EPT participant 
showed a trend of reduced ML BoS, but values did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.054). Despite narrowing 
of step width in all participants, i.e., lower ML BoS, the ML MoS did not show significant modifications over time 
(p = 0.239).
Training Session. 
Figure 4 reports the results from the training session. Results showed that PD patients 
were less stable than age-matched controls in reaction to unexpected perturbations, independent of the direc-
tion, amplitude or repetition of the perturbations. The AP MoS showed a significant main effect of the group 
(p = 0.034) such that PD patients were characterized by lower values. Also the AP BoS showed a tendency to be 
lower in the PD group, but it did not reach the prescribed significance level of 0.050 (p = 0.087).
All outcome variables showed a significant main effect of amplitude (AP BoS: p = 0.002, AP MoS: p < 0.001, 
ML BoS: p < 0.001, ML MoS: p = 0.033). As expected, all outcomes were lower for higher amplitudes of the per-
turbations. Pairwise comparisons revealed that both groups showed significant differences between (i) Low and 
High amplitudes in the AP BoS (p = 0.014), AP MoS (p < 0.001) and ML BoS (p < 0.001); (ii) Low and Medium 
amplitudes in the AP MoS (p = 0.006) and ML BoS (p = 0.014); and (iii) Medium and High amplitudes in the 
AP MoS (p = 0.004) and ML BoS (p = 0.038). The AP MoS and the AP BoS showed a significant main effect of 
repetition (AP BoS: p = 0.020, AP MoS: p < 0.001). The multivariate test indicated a significant interaction effect 
between group and repetition for the AP BoS (p = 0.029). As expected, all outcomes were higher for subsequent 
repetitions of the perturbations. Pairwise comparisons revealed that both groups showed significant differences 
in the AP MoS between R1-R2 (p = 0.002) and R1-R3 (p < 0.001) but only the HC group showed significant 
differences in the AP BoS between R1-R2 (p < 0.001) and R1-R3 (p < 0.001). All outcome measures showed a 
significant main effect of direction (p < 0.001). The ML BoS and ML MoS showed significant interaction between 
group and direction (ML BoS: p = 0.001; ML MoS: p = 0.007). The AP BoS was (i) the largest for anterior pertur-
bations (p < 0.006) and (ii) larger during lateral perturbations than posterior or medial ones (p < 0.001). The AP 
MoS was the smallest for anterior perturbations (p < 0.005). Both groups were characterized by higher ML MoS 
during posterior perturbations than anterior ones (HC group: p < 0.001, PD group: p = 0.039) but only the HC 
group showed higher ML MoS during posterior perturbations than lateral ones (p = 0.001). For both groups, the 
ML BoS was significantly wider during medial perturbations (p < 0.001) and narrowed during lateral perturba-
tions (p < 0.001). However, the two groups showed significant differences for medial perturbations (p = 0.001) 
such that HCs were characterized by a wider step width than PD patients.
Test Session. 
Figure 5 reports the results from the test sessions. None of the outcome measures showed a 
significant effect of repetition at PON or CHS (p > 0.085). At PON, the AP BoS (p = 0.007) showed a significant 
main effect of the session: all participants were characterized by an increased AP BoS at POST. The AP MoS 
showed a significant main effect of the session (p < 0.001) and interaction between session and group (p = 0.001). 
Pairwise comparisons revealed that only the HCs increased the AP MoS from PRE to POST (p < 0.001) such that 
they were characterized by an higher AP MoS at POST with respect to the PD group (p = 0.027). The ML BoS 
showed a trend to decrease from PRE to POST, but values did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.070).
At CHS, the PD group was characterized by a significantly shorter AP BoS (p = 0.032). Also the AP MoS 
showed a trend to be lower in the PD group, but values did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.092). Both the 
AP BoS (p = 0.034) and the AP MoS (p = 0.002) exhibited a significant main effect of the session. Both groups 
showed a larger AP BoS and AP MoS at POST than PRE.. The ML BoS presented a significant main effect of 
the session (p = 0.001) and interaction effect between session and group (p = 0.006). The pairwise comparisons 
revealed that only the HCs decreased the ML BoS at POST (p < 0.001).
Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent PD affects the ability to walk, respond to balance pertur-
bations, and produce short-term adaptations to improve compensatory reactions and control of unperturbed

walking balance. At present, only a few studies have addressed questions related to perturbed balance during 
walking in subjects with PD44–47. Still, it is unclear if Parkinson’s disease diminishes the ability to react and adapt 
to walking perturbations. It has been shown that PD affects the ability to integrate a reactive balance-correcting 
response during sideways perturbations while steadily walking44 but not during forward perturbations while 
switching from locomotion to gait termination45. In both cases, patients were able to implement proactive and 
reactive adaptions to improve their response44,46.
This study highlighted that, during unperturbed treadmill walking, patients with PD were characterized by a 
lower stability in the AP direction compared to HCs (Fig. 3). This is consistent with their typical stooped posture, 
shorter step length, and reduced ability to control the forward acceleration of the CoM23,45. This is the first study 
that analyzed the effects of multidirectional perturbations of different amplitudes delivered while walking in PD. 
Independent of the direction, amplitude, and repetition of the perturbations, PD patients were always character-
ized by a lower AP MoS at their first compensatory heel strike (Fig. 4). This is a sign of increased risk of falling 
and has been shown in patients with several neurological impairments when reacting to unexpected perturba-
tions48,49. As expected, the recovery reaction was dependent on the direction and amplitude of the perturbations 
(Fig. 4)35,36,38. However, the ability to adapt to multiple perturbations or to modify the response to disturbances of 
different amplitudes or directions was not particularly affected by PD. The only differences were a reduced ability 
in PD to: (i) increase the AP BoS after the exposure to multiple perturbations of the same type; (ii) modulate the 
ML MoS in response to different direction of the perturbations; and (iii) react to medial perturbations with a large 
compensatory step width.
Results also showed that participants with PD were able to integrate and adapt reactive but not proactive 
behaviours. Indeed, only the HC group significantly increased their pre-perturbation stability at TEST POST 
(Fig. 5).
While the motor output associated with human walking has been largely associated with functions of spinal 
centers, both supraspinal and afferent inputs contribute considerably to the locomotor output24. Afferent inputs 
are critical for adapting the locomotor pattern, in a phase-appropriate manner, to unexpected perturbations50. 
Furthermore, the basal ganglia and the supplementary motor areas are important pathways for the modulation of 
locomotion24. The striatum, the cerebellum and frontal lobe are involved in motor learning and adaptation as well 
as online modification of movements like those seen during anticipation of a perturbation46. On the other hand, 
parkinsonian gait is characterized by neurotransmitter imbalances in the basal ganglia and under-activation of 
the medial frontal area, the right precuneus, and left cerebellar hemisphere24 and these are likely to be the cause 
for the inability of PD patients to modify gait pattern in anticipation of an upcoming perturbation.
Interestingly, patients with PD were able to adapt just as HCs their reactive strategies such that both groups 
increased post-perturbation stability at the end of the training. The similarity between groups suggests that most 
of the reactive adaptations were produced through modifications via extra-striatal sources. Presumably, given 
the specific neuromuscular skills and the fast nature of compensatory reaction, the adaptation of the reactive 
responses is mainly encrypted in lower parts of the central nervous system.

The exposure to repeated perturbations during training produced acute short-term aftereffects such that 
when cables were removed, the control of gait stability was modified during the 5 minutes of treadmill walking 
post-training (Fig. 3). Participants adjusted their gait pattern during unperturbed walking and did so even though 
they were aware that no perturbations would occur. This is of substantial importance if we want to induce gener-
alized improvements in dynamic stability during unperturbed walking in everyday situations. Modifications of 
the gait pattern were accounted for by a greater AP BoS and MoS and a reduced ML BoS. Even though all partic-
ipants narrowed their step width (i.e., lower ML BoS), the ML MoS did not show significant modifications. These 
results are in accordance with our previous studies with healthy young subjects29 and were effective to temporarily 
reduce the effect of PD on the gait pattern in the AP direction while walking on a treadmill. Indeed, patients 
with PD were characterized by a lower stability in the forward direction and a trend of reduced step length at 
BL (Fig. 3). Due to the training, PD patients temporarily increased step length and forward stability such that 
post-training values were closer to the ones showed by HCs at BL. In the ML direction, even if no differences were 
found between the two groups, a reduction in step width may be self-defeating in PD given that the gait pattern

is generally characterized by lower values. However, we previously showed how the modification of the gait pat-
tern is dependent on the direction of perturbations experienced during the training29. Healthy participants do 
not modify step width during unperturbed walking post-training if only perturbed in the AP direction. Future 
studies may have to involve only AP perturbations in patients with PD in order to avoid undesirable adaptations 
of the gait pattern.
Participants were tested in their clinically “on” state. Dopaminergic medications have shown mixed effects in 
previous studies that analyzed balance perturbation while standing. The postural response changes range from 
being absent12,51–54, worse15, or poor5,55–57. Similarly, some studies have reported positive58 and negative52 effects 
on the adaptation of the response. Reduced gait speed and shortened step length tend to be more accentuated in 
the “off phase”25. The fact that differences were more accentuated for the MoS than the BoS may indicate that the 
MoS is a measure that better relates to falls risk. Future studies need to further investigate how medication affects 
the reaction to perturbations delivered while walking.
A strength of this study is that walking speed was the same in the two groups. Spatio-temporal and stability 
parameters are altered as a function of gait speed both during normal walking and in the reaction to balance

perturbations59. Accordingly, we were able to better isolate the effect of PD on the worsening of the motor 
response from alterations in the initial speed.
Our PD patients were in mild disease stages (H&Y 1–2). It has been suggested that the most useful gait bio-
markers in PD for the development of potential neuroprotective interventions are those sensitive to early disease 
changes60. It is very encouraging that, despite patients were on medication, at early H&Y stages, and walking at 
the same speed as HCs, we were able to detect abnormalities that affect the ability to control the AP MoS both 
during unperturbed treadmill walking and in the reaction to unexpected perturbations in PD. Note, our sample 
size was relatively small and this may have affected the strength of our conclusions. Further studies involving a 
large number and a wider range of severity of the subjects are necessary.
With the type of perturbations used in the present study, we did not want to replicate mechanisms of common 
causes of falls (e.g., tripping and slipping). It is unclear if the effects of perturbation-based balance training are 
specific to the nature of the perturbations experienced18. Thus, it remains uncertain whether improved reaction 
to waist-pull perturbations would also apply to other disturbances. Even though the perturbations used in the 
test sessions were delivered in different directions to the ones experienced during the training, they were still very 
similar as their points of application on the human body were the same. Thus, observed proactive and reactive 
adjustments may be dependent on the specific type of the perturbations experienced and may not show transfer 
to other forms of perturbations in everyday situations. Future studies will further investigate this issue.
The present study only looked at very acute effects (unperturbed walking post-training was analyzed only for 
five minutes of treadmill walking). We did not expect the short intervention to have lasting effects that can be 
transferred to overground walking. Despite this, a recent study has shown how a single session of treadmill gait 
training with three-dimensional tilting perturbations of the surface is more effective than unperturbed walking 
in increasing overground walking speed47. Thus, we believe that increased stability may be transferable to over-
ground gait but future studies have to confirm this.
Gait and balance disorders are one of the principal causes of falls and fall-related injuries2–4. Up to 70% of 
advanced PD patients fall at least once a year and two-thirds of these patients fall recurrently2. These rates are 
twice as high compared to healthy old subjects61. The consequences of such an event are traumatic, both phys-
ically and psychologically, leading to a decreased quality of life. Given the increase in older population and a 
higher incidence of PD among the elderly62, fall-prevention programs are becoming a major health challenge, not 
only to reduce costs, but also to mitigate personal and societal impacts.
A single session of the proposed therapy induced acute effects able to improve gait function and reactive 
reactions to unexpected perturbations for a short amount of time. This finding is encouraging for therapeutic 
interventions since a greater stability while walking and reacting to unexpected perturbations is associated with a 
reduced risk of falling. Future studies need to examine whether a multi-session training will demonstrate lasting 
effects on walking balance, accompanied by improved functional levels and a reduction in the number of falls 
during long-term follow-up assessments.
