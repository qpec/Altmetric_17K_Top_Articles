BACKGROUND
Patisiran, an investigational RNA interference therapeutic agent, specifically inhibits 
hepatic synthesis of transthyretin.
METHODS
In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with hereditary transthyretin 
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive intravenous patisiran 
(0.3 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo once every 3 weeks. The primary 
end point was the change from baseline in the modified Neuropathy Impairment 
Score+7 (mNIS+7; range, 0 to 304, with higher scores indicating more impairment) 
at 18 months. Other assessments included the Norfolk Quality of Life–Diabetic Neu-
ropathy (Norfolk QOL-DN) questionnaire (range, −4 to 136, with higher scores indi-
cating worse quality of life), 10-m walk test (with gait speed measured in meters per 
second), and modified body-mass index (modified BMI, defined as [weight in kilo-
grams divided by square of height in meters] 
× 
albumin level in grams per liter; lower 
values indicated worse nutritional status).
RESULTS
A total of 225 patients underwent randomization (148 to the patisiran group and 77 
to the placebo group). The mean (±SD) mNIS+7 at baseline was 80.9±41.5 in the 
patisiran group and 74.6±37.0 in the placebo group; the least-squares mean (±SE) 
change from baseline was −6.0±1.7 versus 28.0±2.6 (difference, −34.0 points; P<0.001) 
at 18 months. The mean (±SD) baseline Norfolk QOL-DN score was 59.6±28.2 in 
the patisiran group and 55.5±24.3 in the placebo group; the least-squares mean 
(±SE) change from baseline was −6.7±1.8 versus 14.4±2.7 (difference, −21.1 points; 
P<0.001) at 18 months. Patisiran also showed an effect on gait speed and modified 
BMI. At 18 months, the least-squares mean change from baseline in gait speed was 
0.08±0.02 m per second with patisiran versus −0.24±0.04 m per second with placebo 
(difference, 0.31 m per second; P<0.001), and the least-squares mean change from 
baseline in the modified BMI was −3.7±9.6 versus −119.4±14.5 (difference, 115.7; 
P<0.001). Approximately 20% of the patients who received patisiran and 10% of 
those who received placebo had mild or moderate infusion-related reactions; the 
overall incidence and types of adverse events were similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS
In this trial, patisiran improved multiple clinical manifestations of hereditary trans-
thyretin amyloidosis. (Funded by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals; APOLLO ClinicalTrials 
.gov number, NCT01960348.)

H
ereditary transthyretin amyloi-
dosis is an autosomal dominant, multi-
systemic, progressive, life-threatening 
disease caused by mutations in the gene encod-
ing transthyretin (TTR).1 The liver is the primary 
source of circulating tetrameric transthyretin 
protein. In hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, 
both mutant and wild-type transthyretin deposit 
as amyloid in peripheral nerves and the heart, 
kidney, and gastrointestinal tract,1,2 resulting in 
polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy.1,3 Neuro-
pathic changes result in profound sensorimotor 
disturbances, with deterioration in activities of 
daily living and ambulation.4 Autonomic nerve 
involvement causes hypotension, diarrhea, impo-
tence, and bladder disturbances.4 Cardiac mani-
festations include heart failure, arrhythmias, 
orthostatic hypotension, or sudden death due to 
severe conduction disorders.5 Hereditary trans-
thyretin amyloidosis is inexorably progressive, with 
survival of 2 to 15 years after the onset of neu-
ropathy6-8 but only 2 to 5 years among patients 
presenting with cardiomyopathy.9,10
Current treatment options for hereditary trans-
thyretin amyloidosis are limited and include ortho-
topic liver transplantation and transthyretin tet-
ramer stabilizers (tafamidis or diflunisal). However, 
many patients who are treated with these ap-
proaches continue to have disease progression.4,10-16
RNA interference (RNAi) is an endogenous 
mechanism for controlling gene expression. It 
results in the cleavage of target messenger RNA 
(mRNA) by small interfering RNAs bound to the 
RNA-induced silencing complex. Patisiran, a he-
patically directed investigational RNAi therapeu-
tic agent (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available with the full text of this article at NEJM 
.org), harnesses this process to reduce the pro-
duction of mutant and wild-type transthyretin by 
targeting the 3′ untranslated region of transthyre-
tin mRNA.17 Previously, dose-dependent reduction 
of circulating transthyretin levels has been ob-
served with patisiran administration in healthy 
volunteers and in patients with hereditary trans-
thyretin amyloidosis.17,18 In addition, patisiran has 
shown the potential to halt the disease or improve 
disease control in a phase 2, open-label extension 
study involving patients with hereditary transthyre-
tin amyloidosis.19 Here we present efficacy and 
safety data from the APOLLO trial, a randomized, 
placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial involving patients 
with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy.
Methods
Trial Oversight
We carried out a multicenter, international, ran-
domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 
3 trial of patisiran in patients with hereditary 
transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. 
The protocol, including the statistical analysis 
plan, was developed by the sponsor, Alnylam Phar-
maceuticals, and is available at NEJM.org. The trial 
was approved by central and local institutional re-
view boards or ethics committees and conducted 
according to the Good Clinical Practice guide-
lines of the International Conference on Harmoni-
sation and the World Health Organization Dec-
laration of Helsinki. All the participants provided 
written informed consent.
All the investigators gathered the data. The 
first author and sponsor-employed authors ana-
lyzed the data, and all the authors vouch for the 
accuracy and completeness of the data and analy-
ses and for the adherence of the trial to the 
protocol. The first author and sponsor-employed 
authors prepared the first draft with editorial 
assistance provided by Adelphi Communications, 
under contract with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. 
All the authors made the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication. All the authors, their 
institutions, and the sponsor were required to 
maintain data confidentiality during the trial.
Trial Participants
Key eligibility criteria included an age of 18 to 85 
years; a documented pathogenic variant in TTR; 
a diagnosis of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis 
with peripheral neuropathy, with a Neuropathy 
Impairment Score (NIS) of 5 to 130 (range, 0 to 
244, with higher scores indicating more impair-
ment) and a polyneuropathy disability score of IIIb 
or lower (with higher scores indicating more-
impaired walking ability); and adequate liver and 
renal function. Patients with previous liver trans-
plantation or who were planning to undergo liver 
transplantation during the trial period, or who 
had a New York Heart Association class of III or 
IV, were excluded. Full eligibility criteria are pro-
vided in the protocol.
Trial Design and Regimens
Patients were enrolled at 44 sites across 19 coun-
tries. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 
ratio) to receive patisiran (0.3 mg per kilogram 
of body weight) or placebo intravenously over a

Patisiran for Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis
period of approximately 80 minutes, once every 
3 weeks for 18 months.20 Randomization was 
stratified according to NIS (5 to 49 vs. 50 to 130), 
early onset of disease (age <50 years) in the pres-
ence of the V30M variant versus all other patho-
genic variants (including late-onset disease in 
the presence of the V30M variant), and previous 
use of a transthyretin stabilizer (yes vs. no). Pa-
tients received premedication to minimize the 
risk of infusion-related reactions, with details 
provided by Adams et al.20 Patients completing 
the 18-month efficacy assessments were eligible 
to participate in an open-label extension study 
(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02510261).
End-Point Measures and Safety Assessments
The primary end point was the change from base-
line to 18 months in the modified Neuropathy 
Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7),21,22 a composite 
measure of neuropathy that assesses motor, sen-
sory, and autonomic neuropathy (range, 0 to 304, 
with higher scores indicating more impairment). 
Further details on mNIS+7, including standard-
ization of assessments and investigator training, 
have been reported.20
Secondary end points, in hierarchical order for 
statistical testing, were quality of life (score on 
the Norfolk Quality of Life–Diabetic Neuropathy 
[Norfolk QOL-DN] questionnaire; range, −4 to 
136, with higher scores indicating worse quality 
of life), motor strength (NIS-weakness; range, 
0 to 192, with higher scores indicating more 
impairment), disability (score on the Rasch-built 
Overall Disability Scale [R-ODS]; range, 0 to 48, 
with lower scores indicating more disability), 
gait speed (10-m walk test, with speed measured 
in meters per second), nutritional status (modi-
fied body-mass index [BMI], defined as [weight 
in kilograms divided by square of height in me-
ters] 
× 
albumin level in grams per liter; lower val-
ues indicated worse nutritional status), and pa-
tient-reported autonomic symptoms (Composite 
Autonomic Symptom Score 31; range, 0 to 100, 
with higher scores indicating more autonomic 
symptoms), which have been described by Adams 
et al.20 All efficacy end points were assessed at 
baseline and at 9 and 18 months, except modi-
fied BMI (at baseline and at weeks 12, 27, 51, 66, 
and 78).
Exploratory end points included pharmacody-
namic biomarkers (transthyretin and vitamin A) 
and measures of cardiac structure and function 
(echocardiography and measurement of N-termi-
nal pro–brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]) 
(see the Supplementary Appendix), as well as as-
sessment of neuropathy stage with the use of the 
polyneuropathy disability score (with higher scores 
indicating more impaired walking ability). Safety 
was monitored throughout the trial as specified 
in the protocol (see the Supplementary Appendix).
Statistical Analysis
The primary population for efficacy and safety 
analyses was the modified intention-to-treat pop-
ulation (all randomly assigned patients who re-
ceived ≥1 dose of patisiran or placebo). Selected 
analyses were also performed in a predefined car-
diac subpopulation (baseline left ventricular wall 
thickness ≥13 mm in the absence of a history of 
aortic valve disease or hypertension), to enable 
specific assessment of patisiran on cardiac man-
ifestations.
Assuming a mean (±SD) increase in the mNIS+7 
of 24±16 points at 18 months in the placebo 
group, we calculated that a sample of 154 patients 
would provide 90% power for a t-test to detect an 
8.95-point (37.3%) mean difference between the 
two trial groups at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
The planned sample was estimated at 200 pa-
tients to account for discontinuation.
Efficacy end points were assessed with the use 
of a mixed model for repeated measures (see the 
Supplementary Appendix). Secondary end points 
were analyzed in a prespecified hierarchical order 
to control the overall type I error (order as de-
scribed above).
Results
Trial Population
From December 2013 through January 2016, a 
total of 225 patients were randomly assigned in 
a 2:1 ratio to receive patisiran (148 patients) or 
placebo (77) (Fig. 1). The two groups were gen-
erally balanced with respect to baseline demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics (Table 1). 
The V30M mutation was present in 38% of the 
patients in the patisiran group and 52% of those 
in the placebo group, with the remaining pa-
tients having 1 of 38 other pathogenic variants 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Over-
all, 126 patients (56%) were included in the pre-
defined cardiac subpopulation, with a higher per-
centage in the patisiran group (61%, as compared

with 47% in the placebo group). Overall, 138 pa-
tients in the patisiran group (93%) and 55 in the 
placebo group (71%) completed the trial (Fig. 1).
Pharmacodynamics
In the patisiran group, the reduction in serum 
transthyretin levels was rapid and sustained over 
a period of 18 months (Fig. 2A). The median re-
duction in the serum transthyretin level during 
the 18 months was 81% (range, −38 to 95) and 
was similar across age, sex, or genotype.
Efficacy
Primary End Point
The change from baseline in the mNIS+7 was 
significantly lower with patisiran than with place-
bo at 18 months, indicating a benefit with respect 
to polyneuropathy. The mean (±SD) mNIS+7 at 
baseline was 80.9±41.5 in the patisiran group and 
74.6±37.0 in the placebo group. At 18 months, the 
least-squares mean (±SE) change in mNIS+7 from 
baseline was −6.0±1.7 with patisiran, as compared 
with 28.0±2.6 with placebo (least-squares mean 
difference, −34.0 points; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], −39.9 to −28.1; P<0.001) (Fig. 2B). The ef-
fect of patisiran on mNIS+7 was seen as early as 
9 months.
The response to treatment was observed 
broadly across the patisiran group, with 74% of 
the patients having a less than 10-point increase 
from baseline in the mNIS+7 at 18 months, as 
compared with 14% of the patients in the pla-
cebo group. The treatment effect was significant 
for all subgroups and components of the mNIS+7 
(Figs. S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix) 
and was consistent across all trial sites. A correla-
tion was observed between the degree of the re-
duction in transthyretin levels from baseline and 
the change in the mNIS+7 at 18 months (Fig. 3).
At 18 months, 56% of the patients who re-
ceived patisiran had an improvement (decrease 
from baseline at 18 months) in the mNIS+7, as 
compared with 4% of the patients who received 
placebo (Fig. 2D). In patients who received pati-

Patients were assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the patisiran group or the placebo group. Shown is the modified intention-
to-treat population, which includes all the patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of 
patisiran or placebo. Patients who discontinued the trial regimen permanently stopped the regimen before the last 
scheduled dose (week 78 visit). Patients who discontinued the trial regimen owing to progressive disease had a 
modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (range, 0 to 304, with higher scores indicating more impairment) that 
increased by at least 24 points from baseline (on the basis of an average of two measurements) and a worsening in 
the stage of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy relative to baseline at 9 months.

Differences in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics between the patisiran and placebo groups were tested 
with the use of t-tests for continuous variables (age and log-transformed years since diagnosis of hereditary transthyre-
tin amyloidosis) and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables (sex, race, geographic region, V30M or non-V30M TTR 
genotype, previous use or nonuse of tetramer stabilizer, and New York Heart Association class). A significant differ-
ence between the groups (P<0.05) was found for TTR genotype only. FAP denotes familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy.

Figure 2. Comparisons of Changes between the Patisiran Group and the Placebo Group over Time.
Panel A shows the percentage change in serum transthyretin levels from baseline over time in the patisiran group 
and the placebo group. The nadirs in transthyretin reduction at 9 and 18 months correspond to the predose and 
postdose assessments. Panel B shows the least-squares mean change in the modified Neuropathy Impairment 
Score+7 (mNIS+7). At baseline, the mean mNIS+7 was 80.9 (range, 8.0 to 165.0) in the patisiran group and 74.6 
(range, 11.0 to 153.5) in the placebo group. Panel C shows the least-squares mean change in Norfolk Quality of 
Life–Diabetic Neuropathy (QOL-DN) scores (range, −4 to 136; with higher scores indicating worse quality of life).  
At baseline, the mean Norfolk QOL-DN score was 59.6 (range, 5.0 to 119.0) in the patisiran group and 55.5 (range, 
8.0 to 111.0) in the placebo group. In Panels A through C, I bars indicate standard errors. Panel D shows the per-
centage of patients with an improvement (decrease from baseline) in the mNIS+7 or the Norfolk QOL-DN score 
from baseline after 18 months. A post hoc analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio for improvement in the 
Norfolk QOL-DN score.

siran and did not have an improvement in the 
mNIS+7 (54 of 137 patients with available data), 
the median change from baseline in the mNIS+7 
at 18 months was lower than that observed in all 
51 patients who received placebo and had avail-
able data (9.9-point increase and 26.5-point in-
crease, respectively).
Secondary End Points
The change from baseline in the Norfolk QOL-DN 
score was significantly lower with patisiran than 
with placebo at 18 months, indicating better qual-
ity of life with patisiran. At baseline, the mean 
(±SD) Norfolk QOL-DN score was 59.6±28.2 in 
the patisiran group and 55.5±24.3 in the placebo 
group. At 18 months, the least-squares mean (±SE) 
change in the Norfolk QOL-DN score from base-
line was −6.7±1.8 with patisiran, as compared 
with 14.4±2.7 with placebo (least-squares mean 
difference, −21.1 points; 95% CI, −27.2 to −15.0; 
P<0.001) (Fig. 2C). Consistent effects in favor of 
patisiran were noted in Norfolk QOL-DN scores 
across all subgroups (Fig. S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). At 18 months, 51% of the patients 
who received patisiran had an improvement (de-
crease from baseline at 18 months) in the Norfolk 
QOL-DN score, as compared with 10% of those 
who received placebo (Fig. 2D).
Significant between-group differences in favor 
of patisiran treatment were observed for all other 
secondary end points (Table 2). Improvement rela-
tive to baseline was also seen in gait speed in the 
10-m walk test (53% of the patients who received 
patisiran vs. 13% of those who received placebo) 
and motor strength (40% vs. 1%), as determined 
by the NIS-weakness test at 18 months. For all 
secondary end points, between-group differenc-
es in favor of patisiran were evident at the first 
efficacy assessment time point (3 months for 
modified BMI and 9 months for all others).
Select Exploratory End Points
Measures of neuropathy stage also favored pati-
siran, with the polyneuropathy disability score 
stable (96 patients [65%]) or improved (12 pa-
tients [8%]) from baseline in 108 of 148 patients 
(73%); in the placebo group, stabilization occurred 
in 23 of 77 patients (30%) and none had improve-
ment at 18 months. Among patients whose poly-
neuropathy disability score worsened at 18 months, 
worsening by more than one level was observed 
in 5 of 30 patients (17%) in the patisiran group, 
as compared with 16 of 32 (50%) in the placebo 
group.
In the cardiac subpopulation, the geometric 
mean baseline level of NT-proBNP, a measure of 
cardiac stress that is an independent predictor of 
death in patients with transthyretin cardiac amy-
loidosis, was 726.9 pg per milliliter (coefficient 
of variation, 220.3%) in the patisiran group and 
711.1 pg per milliliter (coefficient of variation, 
190.8%) in the placebo group. At 18 months, the 
adjusted geometric mean ratio to baseline was 
0.89 with patisiran and 1.97 with placebo (ratio, 
0.45; P<0.001), representing a 55% difference in 
favor of patisiran. Patisiran treatment was also 
associated with better cardiac structure and func-
tion than placebo, including significant differ-
ences in mean left ventricular wall thickness 
(P 
= 
0.02) and longitudinal strain (P 
= 
0.02) at 18 
months (Table 2).
Safety
Overall, 97% of the patients in each trial group 
reported adverse events (Table 3), most of which 
were mild or moderate in severity. The frequency 
of severe adverse events (28% in the patisiran 
group and 36% in the placebo group) and seri-

Patisiran for Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis
ous adverse events (36% and 40%, respectively) 
was similar in the two groups (Table 3, and Ta-
ble S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Adverse 
events leading to discontinuation of the trial regi-
men occurred more frequently with placebo (14%) 
than with patisiran (5%); adverse events that led 
to discontinuation of the trial regimen in two or 
more patients were cardiac failure (two patients 
[1%] in the patisiran group) and acute kidney 
injury (two patients [3%] in the placebo group). 
Death occurred in seven patients (5%) in the 
patisiran group and in six patients (8%) in the 
placebo group. The causes of death were primar-
ily cardiovascular in nature and consistent with 
those expected in patients with hereditary trans-
thyretin amyloidosis (Table S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). The incidence of cardiac adverse 
events (28% in the patisiran group and 36% in 
the placebo group), cardiac serious adverse events 
(14% and 13%, respectively), and cardiac failure 
(9% and 10%, respectively) was similar in the two 
groups. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias 
was lower with patisiran (19%) than with pla-
cebo (29%).
Common adverse events that occurred more 
frequently with patisiran than with placebo in-
cluded peripheral edema (30% vs. 22%) and in-
fusion-related reactions (19% vs. 9%) (Table 3, 
and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
These were all mild or moderate in severity. One 
patient withdrew owing to a moderate infusion-
related reaction of flushing. Symptoms of infu-
sion-related reactions that were reported in at 
least 3% of patients in either group were back 
pain, flushing, abdominal pain, and nausea (Ta-
ble S3 in the Supplementary Appendix); there were 
no reported severe or serious infusion-related reac-
tions, and the frequency of infusion-related reac-
tions decreased over time. No clinically relevant 
changes in laboratory values related to patisiran, 
including platelet counts and indicators of liver 
or kidney function, were observed during the 
trial. Of the 187 patients eligible to participate 
in an open-label extension study, 186 (99%) were 
enrolled.
Discussion
Current treatment options for hereditary trans-
thyretin amyloidosis are limited; however, our 
data indicate that the lowering of transthyretin 
levels may be an effective therapeutic approach. 
We found that patisiran, an RNAi therapeutic, 
significantly improved neuropathy in patients with 
hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. The effects 
extended across the sensorimotor and autonomic 
domains and were consistent across patient sub-
groups. In addition, patisiran treatment resulted 
in significant improvements in quality of life, 
walking, nutritional status, and activities of daily 
living. The broad patient population recruited to 
the APOLLO phase 3 trial is characteristic of the 
wide disease spectrum expected in clinical prac-
tice. Our results are corroborated by a trial of

inotersen, also published in this issue of the 
Journal, which used an antisense oligonucleotide 
approach to transthyretin lowering and showed 
the slowing of neuropathy progression in patients 
with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis.23
Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis has a 
rapidly progressive course, highlighted by the 
worsening condition seen in patients who re-
ceived placebo during the trial, a finding consis-
tent with those of other reports.6,24,25 Across trial 
end points, patients in the placebo group had 
evidence of increasing sensorimotor and auto-
nomic impairment, leading to worsening symp-
toms and decreased functional ability. Disease 
progression was also evident from the higher rate 
of discontinuation of the trial regimen in the 
placebo group (38%, as compared with 7% in the 
patisiran group), as well as the high incidence of 
adverse events likely to be associated with wors-
ening disease (e.g., falls, urinary tract infections, 
and syncope) in the placebo group.
In contrast, disease progression was halted or 
reversed with patisiran treatment across all pri-
mary and secondary end points. In addition, the 
polyneuropathy disability score improved in 8% of 
the patients in the patisiran group at 18 months, 
whereas no patients in the placebo group had 
improvement. This included transition from as-
sisted to unassisted walking, a notable milestone 
for patients with hereditary transthyretin amy-
loidosis, which is consistent with the effect of 
patisiran on gait speed.
There was also evidence that patisiran improved 
cardiac manifestations of hereditary transthyretin 
amyloidosis, as indicated by echocardiographic 
measures of cardiac structure and function and 
a reduction in NT-proBNP levels. It is possible that 
the increased gait speed in patients who received 
patisiran may have resulted from favorable effects 
on both the neuropathic and cardiac aspects of 
the disease.
The principal safety finding was mild-to-mod-
erate infusion-related reactions, the incidence of 
which decreased over time. The number of deaths 
in the overall population, and in the cardiac sub-
group, was similar in the patisiran group and 
the placebo group. There were no safety signals 
regarding thrombocytopenia or renal dysfunction 
with patisiran, although these events have been 
observed with other oligonucleotide therapies.26 
In conclusion, the APOLLO phase 3 trial showed 
that patisiran provided benefit to patients with 
hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis by treating 
a broad range of symptoms.
