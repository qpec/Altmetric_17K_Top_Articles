Abstract 
Rationale: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common sleep disorder with a high 
prevalence in general population. Recent studies have shown that hospitalized obese 
patients have a high likelihood of unrecognized SDB. However, no systematic large study 
has so far evaluated the outcomes of a screening program to identify these patients. This 
study provides demographic, clinical and outcome data from a screening program at a 
tertiary care academic center. 
Methods: Subjects were 5062 patients screened from March 2013 to July 2016. Of these, 
1410 underwent in-hospital overnight high-resolution pulse oximetry (HRPO) and 680 
underwent polysomnography post discharge. Patients placed on positive airway therapy 
(PAP)  were followed in an ambulatory setting and mortality data were compared 
between compliant versus non-compliant patients.  
Results: The mean age was 60.7 years (SD 15.2), mean BMI was 34.8 kg/m2(SD 8.3) 
with 2477 (49.0%) males. In the entire cohort, 3336 were found to be at high risk based 
on screening with a STOP or STOP-BANG questionnaire. Of the 1410 high-risk patients 
who underwent HRPO, 1092 were SDB positive (ODI ≥ 5) and 680 high-risk patients

underwent polysomnography. In this latter group, 585 (87%) were found to have SDB 
(AHI>5). A receiver operator curve (ROC) for oxygen desaturation index (ODI) derived 
from HRPO  plotted against apnea hyponea index (AHI) from polysomnography showed 
an area under the curve of 0.83 for an ODI of > 5. Patients who were adherent to PAP 
therapy in the first three months had improved survival over a mean follow-up of 609 
days compared to those who were non-adherent (p=0.01). 
Conclusion: This large database of hospitalized patients confirms a high prevalence of 
undetected SDB in this population. Our screening protocol of a clinical questionnaire 
combined with HRPO testing is effective in identifying SDB and long-term follow up of 
those compliant with treatment reveals a survival benefit.

Introduction 
 
Sleep Disordered breathing (SDB) is a modern world epidemic with an estimated 
prevalence of 26%1. It is implicated as a risk factor in the development of numerous 
cardiovascular conditions including congestive heart failure, hypertension, atrial 
fibrillation and stroke2. Furthermore, several large observational trials have identified 
SDB as a risk factor for premature mortality3-5. Despite extensive evidence of its 
detrimental impact on health, SDB remains under-diagnosed and under-treated6. 
Moreover, delayed diagnosis of SDB may be adding to the burden of complications from 
other medical conditions such as diabetes7 and renal failure8 . Thus, efforts to more 
quickly diagnose and treat persons with SDB have the potential to reduce negative 
outcomes9. 
 
Recent efforts to perform SDB screening and treatment in hospitalized patients 
have been encouraging. Studies by ourselves and others have shown that early diagnosis 
of SDB and intervention in hospitalized patients resulted in a reduction in 30-day and 6 
month readmissions in patients admitted for acute heart failure and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation10-12. In this analysis we extend our previous 
findings to include a substantially larger number of patients to not only confirm the high 
prevalence of unrecognized SDB in hospitalized patients, but also to determine its impact 
on survival of patients after early intervention with positive airway pressure (PAP) 
therapy.

Methodology 
 
Between March 2013 to July 2016, 5062 patients admitted to the cardiology, 
internal medicine, and family practice services with a body mass index (BMI, weight 
[kg]/height, [m2]) ≥ 30 were screened for SDB with the STOP (snoring, tiredness during 
daytime, observed apnea, high blood pressure).  In addition, patients admitted to the 
advanced heart failure service with the diagnosis of CHF were screened using the full 
STOP-BANG questionnaire13. The questionnaires were administered by a respiratory 
therapist. The STOP and STOP-BANG questionnaires are easy to use succinct tools 
which can be administered by health care professionals with a minimal increase in work 
burden. The STOP-BANG was administered to cardiology service patients since there is 
evidence that patients with heart failure do not always exhibit excessive daytime 
sleepiness/tiredness14. The STOP-BANG adds objective measures of BMI, neck collar 
size (> 40 cm), gender (males are at higher risk) and age ( >50 years). The admitting team 
was notified if the STOP/ STOP-BANG questionnaire was positive (answering yes to two 
or more items in STOP and 3 or more in STOP-BANG) who then contacted a board-
certified pulmonary sleep medicine physician (inpatient consult service) to determine 
whether a follow-up consultation was necessary (Figure 1). A consultation by a board-
certified sleep specialist determined if the patient required a nocturnal high resolution 
plethysmography (HRPO). The contra-indications for in-hospital HRPO included oxygen

requirement > 30%, severe pain, insomnia, altered mental status, anticipated disruption 
during sleep (imaging/tests or surgeries). Upon high clinical suspicion of SDB (defined 
according to the Adult OSA Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine15 
[AASM]), patients were advised to undergo a post-discharge confirmatory 
polysomnogram (PSG). Patients admitted during the weekends were not included in the 
study. Using the hospital electronic medical records and patients’ outpatient sleep center 
charts, a database of the STOP or STOP-BANG results, demographic and relevant 
clinical information was compiled and stored in REDCap (https://projectredcap.org/).  
Out of 5062 patients included in the final database, 1161 patients have been included in 
prior publications9,11,12,16,17. The Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Review Board 
approved the study. 
Polysomnogram evaluations were conducted at an AASM accredited sleep center, 
and included an electrocardiograph, electroencephalograph, continuous oronasal airflow 
recording (with a thermistor and a pressure transducer), recording of chest wall and 
abdomen movement (using respiratory inductive plethysmography belts), transcutaneous 
oximetry, and chin electromyography (Comet AS 40 PSG, Grass Technologies; 
Warwick, RI, USA). Sleep was staged manually according to AASM scoring guidelines 
by a registered PSG technologist.  The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was calculated as 
the number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour of total sleep time, with hypopneas 
defined using a desaturation criterion of 4%. A single, board-certified sleep physician 
interpreted the polysomnograms. The high resolution pulse oximetry was performed

using a Masimo RAD-57 machine (Irvine, CA) standardized to an average time of 3 sec 
and oxygen desaturation index cutoff of 4%, which is consistent with AASM 
recommendations18. Patients who were confirmed to have SDB were started on PAP 
therapy and followed for a mean of 609 days and median of 570 days to determine their 
adherence with PAP therapy and vital status. 
 
Statistical analysis  
Summary statistics of all patients, SDB patients adherent to PAP therapy and 
SDB patients non-adherent to PAP therapy were calculated. Compliance information for 
the first 4-6 weeks of PAP therapy was downloaded and reviewed during a patient’s first 
follow up visit to the sleep center or was obtained from the durable medical equipment 
provider. Adherence was defined as use of the PAP device for 4 hours or more per night 
for >70% of the nights.  Tabulations and percentages were calculated for categorical 
variables. Means, medians, standard deviations and ranges were calculated for continuous 
variables.  Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine significant predictors of 
SDB.   
 
Using AHI ≥ 5 events per hour as the diagnostic criteria for SDB, we constructed 
a receiver-operator curve to describe the accuracy of correctly identifying SDB with the 
ODI.  The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated.  Additionally, a relative Bland-
Altman plot was constructed which compared the ratio of ODI to AHI. As discussed in 
 Recognition and treatment of sleep disordered breathing in obese hospitalized 
patients may improve survival. The HoSMed database 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bland-Altman (1986), the relative Bland-Altman plot (using log-transformed data) is 
preferable when the data show fanning, or higher variability with increased mean values.  
Finally, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for SDB patients’ adherent to therapy 
and SDB patients non-adherent to therapy were constructed and compared with a Log-
rank test. To adjust for potential confounding variables because this is an observational 
study, a propensity score analysis was conducted.  Specifically, propensity scores for 
each patient were calculated with a logistic regression model that predicted compliance 
using age, BMI, race, heart failure, asthma/COPD, and diuretic use.  Other demographic 
variables such as AHI, other medication use, and other comorbidities were considered but 
not included in the model due to their low association with compliance.  Finally, an 
inverse propensity score weighted Log-Rank survival analysis was conducted. 
 
Results 
 
Data from a total of 5062 patients screened from March 2013 to July 2016 were 
analyzed. Overall, the mean age was 60.7 years (SD 15.2), mean BMI was 34.8 kg/m2 
(SD 8.3) with 2477 (49.0%) males. Co-morbidities included 882 (17.4%) patients with 
heart failure (CHF), 971 (19.2%) with asthma/COPD, 1798 (35.5%) with coronary artery 
disease, 1849 (36.5%) with type-2 diabetes, 3181 (62.9%) with hypertension (HTN), 866 
(17.1%) with chronic renal failure (CRF) and 905 (17.9%) with atrial fibrillation. (Table 
1) Compliant patients were older (p-value<0.0001), more likely to be white (p-

value<0.0001), and less likely to have asthma/COPD (p-value=0.02) and atrial fibrillation 
(p-value=0.04). 
As shown in Figure 1, of the 5062 screened patients, 3336 (66%) tested positive 
for SDB by the STOP/STOP BANG questionnaire. Of these 3336 positive screens, 1604 
patients were evaluated by the hospital inpatient service led by a board certified sleep 
physician. Of these consults, 1410 HRPO’s were performed with 1092 revealing an ODI 
> 5. Of the 680 PSG’s performed post discharge, 592/680 (87%) were diagnosed with 
SDB (AHI>5). The mean AHI for patients undergoing PSG was 30.0 (30.3) and mean 
ODI in patients who underwent HRPO was 21.4 (21.4). Assuming that the positive PSG 
confirmation rate of 87% can be applied to the entire cohort of those patients who had an 
ODI > 5, the estimated prevalence of SDB in the entire cohort of 5062 patients is 18.7%. 
As shown in Table 2, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age 
between 51 and 61, male sex, higher BMI greater than 38 kg/m2, and the presence of 
CHF, CRF, HTN, Asthma/COPD were independently associated with SDB (all p-
values<0.005). However, race, atrial fibrillation and type 2 diabetes were not 
significantly associated with SDB. The likelihood ratio (LR) of SDB with ODI of > 15 
was 6.47 and ODI of > 20 was 9.19 (Table 4). The demographic characteristics of 
patients who had HRPO while in the hospital but did not follow-up at our sleep center for 
a PSG were compared with patients who had HRPO and subsequent PSG.  Those who 
had both procedures were more likely to be Black and had a statistically higher

percentage of many, but not all comorbid medical conditions. However, the differences 
were relatively small. (Table 5). 
As shown in Figure 2, there was a strong correlation between inpatient ODI and 
outpatient AHI with an AUC of 0.83 on the receiver operator curve using AHI > 5 for 
confirmation of SDB.  The relative Bland-Altman plot (Figure 3, Table 3) revealed that 
there was no significant bias when using ODI versus AHI to define SDB. 
 Survival curves for the 149 patients with SDB and adherent with PAP therapy 
and the 309 patients with SDB who were non-adherent were compared (Figure 4). The 
mean and median follow-up durations were 609 and 570 days respectively. In contrast to 
non-adherent patients, those who were adherent to PAP therapy were found to have 
significantly better survival (Log-rank test p=0.016). In an inverse probability weighted 
survival analysis (using propensity score), these differences were confirmed and were 
even more statistically significant (p-value=0.001). 
 
Discussion 
 
In this analysis of a large database of hospitalized patients, we confirmed that 
there is a high prevalence of undiagnosed SDB. Furthermore, follow-up of these patients 
for a mean of 609 days demonstrated that those who were adherent to PAP had a survival 
advantage in comparison to those who were non-compliant. These findings add to the

patients may improve survival. The HoSMed database 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
larger body of evidence that diagnosis and treatment of SDB with PAP can reduce long-
term mortality. 
 
In our single center database of more than 5000 patients, the estimated prevalence 
of undiagnosed SDB was 18.7%. The true prevalence rate may be even higher if there are 
patients who screened falsely negative.  In contrast, recent estimates of the prevalence of 
SDB in the community are much higher1,19,20  with 83.8% of men found to have an AHI > 
5 in one study21. It is likely that differences between our results and these general 
population estimates are related to dissimilarities in population characteristics, methods 
of ascertainment and definitions of SDB. Irrespective of the true prevalence rate in 
hospitalized patients, it appears that there are large numbers of unrecognized SDB 
patients in this population. 
 
Prior data suggests that SDB in hospitalized patients is associated with greater 
morbidity and mortality.  This suggests that SDB treatment is an area that may have 
potential for improving outcomes. A large multi-center study of SDB in hospitalized type 
2 diabetes patients showed that over 60% of the patients had an AHI >5 and a quarter of 
the patients had moderate to severe OSA22. Shear et al screened hospitalized elderly 
patients and identified 40% as high-risk for OSA. These high-risk patients were also 
found to have reduced sleep (as measured by actigraphy) and poor self-reported sleep 
quality during their hospital stay23. A recent study found OSA to be a risk factor for post-
operative respiratory failure requiring ICU transfer in patients undergoing orthopedic 
surgery24. In a large prospective study of patients hospitalized for acute heart failure,

diagnosis of SDB was independently associated with post-discharge mortality25. 
Lindenauer et al showed that among patients hospitalized with pneumonia presence of 
OSA increases risk for intubation, ICU transfers and higher cost of care26. 
A few recent studies have shown that early intervention with PAP therapy in 
patients detected to have SDB in hospitalized settings may improve clinical outcomes. 
Kauta et al showed that early detection and treatment of OSA in patients admitted to 
cardiac care unit (CCU) reduced 30-day readmission10. Likewise, we studied patients 
admitted with acute heart failure who were diagnosed with SDB in the hospital.  Early 
intervention with PAP therapy resulted in a significant reduction in 6-month readmission 
in those compliant with therapy11. A similar reduction in readmission after early PAP 
intervention was also shown by our group in patients admitted with a COPD exacerbation 
and diagnosed with SDB. Early recognition of high-risk patients for OSA in hospitalized 
patients also predicted more frequent rapid response events which were reduced in 
patients who were successfully intervened with PAP therapy27.  
The major finding in this study was that patients treated and compliant on PAP 
therapy showed a significant survival advantage compared to those who were non-
compliant. We do not believe that differences in various comorbidities explains the 
observed survival advantage of PAP adherent patients in that there were few differences 
in the prevalence of important comorbid conditions between the two groups and this 
observation was supported using an inverse propensity score analysis which accounted 
for differences between the two groups.  This finding also is consistent with our recent

data targeting CHF patients. In that latter analysis, we observed a trend towards improved 
survival in patients compliant with PAP therapy; however, it did not reach statistical 
significance due to the small numbers of patients. In this large sample size comprising 
patients with various co-morbid conditions, we extend our previous findings by 
demonstrating a significant survival benefit in patients with SDB who were compliant 
with PAP therapy compared to non-compliant patients. In addition, our current analysis 
includes not only CHF patients, but patients with other medical conditions. Thus, our 
findings have greater generalizability to a broader spectrum of hospital populations.  Our 
data suggest that once SDB is identified in hospitalized patients, concerted efforts need to 
be made to initiate and maintain effective PAP therapy.  
This study also supports our prior contention that HRPO derived ODI in 
hospitalized patients provides similar results in comparison to a PSG derived AHI. This 
two-tier system of screening with a clinical questionnaire and an objective HRPO in 
those who are positive can yield a high positive predictive value as noted by 87% of the 
PSG’s resulting in a positive diagnosis of SDB. Patients who underwent HRPO in the 
hospital but failed to get a subsequent PSG at our center were less likely to have several 
serious comorbid medical conditions. However, the differences between those who did 
not have a confirmatory PSG and those who did not were small and unlikely to be 
clinically significant.  
Although our study has several important findings, it should be interpreted with 
the following limitations.  First, it is a retrospective observational study. Patients were not

prospectively randomized to PAP therapy or sham PAP therapy. It is possible that despite 
similarities in comorbid conditions between the two groups, factors other than PAP 
adherence explained the differences in survival that were observed. However, we applied 
propensity score analysis to account for systematic differences in baseline characteristics 
between treated and untreated subjects when estimating the effect of treatment on 
outcomes and the model continued to show a significant statistical difference.  Second, 
the screening was limited to weekdays. However, we do not believe that the patient 
demographics were different during weekend admissions. Third, due to logistical 
limitations the screening was limited to medical services only and does not apply to other 
services. Third, except for CHF patients, patients were screened only if their BMI was > 
30 kg/m2. Thus, our findings cannot be extrapolated to non-obese patients. Fourth, only 
680 (21%) of all screen positive patients underwent a PSG study post discharge at our 
facility. However, the high correlation of ODI on the HRPO with the PSG AHI suggests 
that in this population, the ODI is a reasonable surrogate to identify SDB.  Finally, 
patients who screened negative did not undergo either HRPO or PSG. Thus, some 
patients may have been incorrectly designated as not having SDB.  
 
Despite the afore-mentioned limitations, our study has several strengths. To our 
knowledge, this is the largest database of SDB in hospitalized patients to date.  As such, 
it provides insight into the extent of undiagnosed and untreated SDB in hospitalized 
patients and their outcomes. It also demonstrates the utility of using existing clinical

personnel with minimal additional training (e.g., respiratory therapists) to administer a 
simple screening SDB questionnaire in a hospital population. 
In conclusion, this analysis of a large database of over 5000 patients confirmed 
our prior findings of high burden of unrecognized SDB in obese hospitalized patients in 
selected medical services. Furthermore, it showed that early intervention and adherence 
to therapy imparted a survival benefit. We recommend routine screening and intervention 
of obese patients admitted to hospital medical services.
