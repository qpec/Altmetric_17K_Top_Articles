The Use of Primate “Actors”
in Feature Films 1990–2013

ABSTRACT This study examined the use of nonhuman primate “actors”
(
PAs)
 in promotional trailers for wide-release,
 English-language CARA-
rated films released between 1990 and 2013.
 A comprehensive list of films
featuring PAs was constructed using internet databases and snowball
sampling.
 Changes in the frequency of their use over time were examined.
Trailers for each of the films on the list were screened for inclusion of PA
footage.
 Those including PAs were content-analyzed for a list of items in-
cluding taxa/
taxon used;
 presence or absence of bared-teeth display
(
BTD,
 often an expression of fear or submission in nonhuman primates)
;
and presence of clothing,
 human companion,
 anthropogenic environment,
and/
or “human” actions.
 No statistically significant increase or decrease in
the frequency of PA use was detected over the time period examined,
 al-
though comparison to an earlier study that included pre-1990 films sug-
gests that the use of orangutans (
Pongo spp.
)
 has diminished in frequency.
The present study found that the most commonly used taxa between
1990 
 and 2013 were chimpanzees (
Pan spp.
)
,
 capuchins (
Cebus and
Sapajus spp.
)
,
 and Cercopithecines (
Macaca and Papio spp.
)
.
 PAs were
shown “grinning” (
displaying BTDs)
 for 19% of the time they were on-
screen;
 they were clothed 50% of the time;
 performing “human” actions
58% of the time;
 alongside human companions 87% of the time and/
or in
anthropogenic environments 87% of the time.
 Apart from concern that the
practice compromises the welfare of individual primates,
 there is some in-
dication that the use of PAs may be indirectly harmful as well;
 results of
several recent studies suggest that their presentation in certain contexts
fosters false public understanding about the conservation status of pri-
mates and their suitability as human companions or pets.
 The low but
steady frequency with which PAs were used and presented in various an-
thropocentric contexts suggests that,
 throughout the time period studied,
the film industry remained either uninformed or unconcerned about the
potential harmful effects that their choices could have on animal welfare
and conservation.

 Nonhuman primates (
hereafter “primates”)
 have long been used as pets,
 perform-
ers,
 or for other forms of entertainment (
Brabaw,
 2014;
 Groves,
 2008;
 Gudger,
1923)
.
 Their “uncanny similarity to humans” (
Corbey,
 2005)
 has led to prevailing
views,
 amongst diverse societies,
 that they (
apes and monkeys in particular)
 are devilish,
grotesque caricatures of degraded man,
 or humorous or satirical symbols of human foolish-
ness (
Corbey,
 2005;
 Fernández-Armesto,
 2005)
.
 They have at times been mythologized as
gods or kings (
Brabaw,
 2014;
 Burton,
 2002;
 Wheatley,
 1999)
,
 but only in rare instances (
e.
g.
,
through the work of Jane Goodall in the 1960s)
 do they seem to have been popularly
 
perceived by Westernized global culture as actual monkeys or apes;
 as our wild cousins,
strikingly similar to us in many ways,
 but also with lives,
 behaviors,
 needs and interests that
are distinctly separate from our own.
 Live,
 trained primate “actors” (
PAs)
 have appeared in film
since the start of the Hollywood Era,
 beginning with the Tarzan movies of the 1930s (
Burt,
2002)
.
 They continue to be used,
 despite the concern voiced by multiple professional or-
ganizations and NGOs,
 who argue that the practice is damaging to the welfare of individual
primates (
AnimalPledge.
org,
 2014;
 Born Free Foundation,
 2014;
 Eyes on Apes,
 2015;
 IPS,
2008a;
 Wild Futures,
 2015)
.
 
A recent study (
Gil Vazquez and Nekaris,
 unpublished)
 analyzed non-animated,
 non-
documentary US films featuring primates (
including the use of stock footage,
 artificial
 
representations,
 and PAs)
.
 Overall,
 gorillas were the most commonly represented taxon,
 
followed by chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys.
 When artificial representations (
CGI,
 cos-
tume,
 puppet)
 are excluded from this analysis,
 chimpanzees,
 capuchins and orangutans
were most common.
 
PAs are often depicted “smiling” (
bared-teeth displays:
 BTDs)
 in apparent happiness,
 al-
though such facial expressions often signal fear or submission in chimpanzees,
 capuchins,
 and
other primate taxa (
Preuschoft & van Hooff,
 1997)
.
 They tend to be cast as human compan-
ions,
 friends,
 pets,
 and troublemakers;
 they are usually depicted enjoying this status.
 They
wear dungarees,
 they brush their teeth,
 they thrive in cities,
 shopping malls,
 and human house-
holds.
 Meanwhile,
 as they are increasingly threatened with extinction (
Estrada et al.
,
 2017)
,
 the
number of primates kept as pets by private individuals in places like the US and the UK remains
surprisingly high—approximately 1,
500 in the UK and 15,
000 in the USA (
HSUS,
 2013;
 Wild
Futures & RSPCA,
 2009)
.
 The negative welfare implications of the primate pet trade are well-
documented (
Aldrich,
 2014;
 AVMA,
 2008;
 BVA,
 2014;
 Corning,
 2005;
 IPS,
 2008b;
 RSPCA,
2014;
 Soulsbury et al.
,
 2009;
 Wild Futures,
 2014)
 but do not appear to be well-understood by
the general public,
 as evidenced by advice produced by breeders,
 dealers,
 and exotic pet-
keeping associations (
Anonymous,
 2015;
 Phoenix Exotic Wildlife Association,
 2005;
 rain-
bowprimates.
net,
 2015;
 WikiHow,
 2015)
.
 This could be due,
 in part,
 to public misconceptions
about primates’ needs,
 behavior and conservation status,
 fueled by the way they are com-
monly portrayed in mass media.
 For many people,
 such misrepresentations may be their only
exposure to primates and their behavior,
 and the basis upon which their beliefs about these
animals are formed;
 several recent studies indicate that media depictions influence public per-
ceptions about and attitudes toward primates (
Leighty et al.
,
 2015;
 Nekaris et al.
,
 2013;
 Nekaris
& Campbell,
 2012;
 Ross,
 et al.
,
 2008;
 Schroepfer et al.
,
 2011)
.
 
In a 2008 study,
 35% of survey respondents who had indicated that chimpanzees are not
endangered later explained their mistake by stating that their frequent appearance in film and tel-
evision had led them to assume that chimps were not threatened with extinction (
Ross et al.
,
2008)
.
 Another study found poor understanding of welfare and conservation issues in  
viewers

 shown film clips that included “entertainment” chimpanzees (
Schroepfer et al.
,
 2011)
.
 More re-
cently,
 viewers shown images of capuchin monkeys,
 squirrel monkeys,
 and ring-
tailed lemurs in
human environments and in close contact with humans demonstrated an increased desire to
keep such primates as pets (
Leighty et al.
,
 2015)
.
 Other studies,
 focused on web-
based media,
determined that the context in which slow lorises are shown can positively or negatively affect
public perceptions about their conservation status and desirability as pets (
Nekaris et al.
,
 2013;
Nekaris & Campbell,
 2012)
.
 Though attitude does not necessarily  
predict any specific action to-
ward primates,
 there is much to suggest that the way they are depicted and (
mis)
understood may
have an impact on both primate welfare and the conservation of  
primate species.
This study aimed to identify the primate species that most often appeared as performers
in recent popular films (
1990 onwards)
,
 to identify trends in their use,
 and to describe the con-
texts in which they appeared and the frequency with and contexts in which BTDs were shown.
It formed part of a project that examined public perceptions about the meaning of facial ex-
pressions in performing primates,
 and how such perceptions relate to attitudes toward primate
welfare,
 conservation,
 and pet-keeping.
 
Methods
A list of recent feature films (
released between 1990 and 2013)
 was compiled using the crite-
ria in Table 1.
 Because the study was specific to the use of primate “actors” (
as opposed to
films in which primates simply appear)
,
 the sample was limited to fictional feature-length films
in which PAs “act,
” or represent characters,
 rather than those in which they simply appear as
backdrops or objects that add atmosphere (
e.
g.
,
 a screaming monkey in a laboratory cage)
.
Although not assumed to be complete,
 the list was fairly exhaustive due to the nature of the
search (
Google searches were continued until five consecutive results failed to generate new
information)
.
 All films had been rated G,
 PG,
 PG13 or R (
Table 2)
 by the Classification and Rat-
ings Administration (
CARA)
;
 all members of the Motion Picture Association of America are
obliged to submit their theatrically released films for CARA rating (
CARA,
 2017)
.
 These ratings
were recorded for each film included in analysis.
 
Spearman rank-order correlations were performed and trend analysis plots generated to
explore changes in the rate at which PAs appeared in film during the time period under study.
 
Trailers for each film on the list were sought online (
www.
youtube.
com)
 and screened for
inclusion of shots or scenes featuring one or more PAs.
 Trailers containing PAs were analyzed
and descriptive statistics generated for each of the following:
 
■ Trailer duration (
whole seconds)
 and duration of each shot including one or more PAs,
thus providing percentage of PA screen time per trailer 
■ Taxa/
taxon used 
■ Presence or absence of BTD,
 and where present,
 subjective judgement about context
in which presented (
fear,
 submission,
 pleasure,
 etc.
)
 
■ PA age category (
adult;
 subadult;
 unknown)
,
 based upon body size and shape,
 pelage,
and,
 for orangutans,
 consultation with experts [S.
 Cheyne,
 K.
 Scott,
 M.
 Schoonvliet]
■ Presence of clothing,
 human companion,
 anthropocentric context (
i.
e.
,
 PAs depicted
in houses,
 cars,
 and other man-made environments where they would not naturally be
found)
,
 and/
or “human” actions.

 Film trailers were used as an accessible yet conservative proxy for the content of the films
themselves;
 PAs do not appear in trailers for all films featuring PAs,
 but inclusion in a trailer
 
implies inclusion in the film.
 Viewer perception was not explored in this study.
 However,
 the cho-
sen measures of context (
clothing;
 human companion;
 anthropogenic environment;
 “human”
actions)
 relate to a number of studies about the impact that viewer perception has on atti-
tudes and behavior toward primates (
Leighty et al.
,
 2015;
 Nekaris et al.
,
 2013;
 Nekaris &
Campbell,
 2012;
 Ross et al.
,
 2008;
 Ross,
 Vreeman,
 & Lonsdorf,
 2011;
 Schroepfer et al.
,
 2011)
.
The frequency with which BTDs were shown was measured because of the apparently com-
mon misconception (
personal observation)
 that such displays express happiness in primates,
and in relation to a wider study on public perceptions of facial expressions in performing
 
primates.
 Age category was recorded when possible because of the apparently common
practice of using immature apes as “actors”;
 there are profound welfare issues associated
with this practice (
Born Free Foundation,
 2014;
 Freeman & Ross,
 2014)
.
All statistical analyses and graphical output were generated using Excel 2013 and Minitab
16 AND 17.
 Numerical data were checked for normality using Anderson-
Darling tests,
 in which
p > 0.
05 indicate normal distribution (
Dytham,
 2003)

Resul
ts
A list of 70 films was compiled (

.
 Of the 17,
905 CARA-rated films released during
the study period (
CARA,
 2017)
,
 only about 0.
39% featured PAs overall.
 Year by year,
 this
 
percentage ranged between 0 and 1.
17%.
 While the rate at which CARA-rated films were re-
leased overall increased significantly over time (

 the rate at
which PAs featured in these films neither increased nor decreased significantly,
 either in whole

 Thirty-two films (
including those whose trailers did not include PA footage)
 were excluded
for failure to meet the criteria for inclusion.
 The remaining 38 trailers formed the basis for the
remaining analysis.
 Of the film trailers analyzed,
 79% were CARA-
rated G,
 PG,
 or PG13  
(
Figure
2)
.
 The remainder (
21%)
 were R-rated.
 The combined duration of the 38 trailers totaled 4,
507
seconds.
 Individual trailer duration ranged from 30s to 179s (
mean = 118.
61s;
 median = 133s)
.
PAs appeared on-screen for a total of 416s (
9.
2% of total trailer screen-time)
.
 PA screen-time
varied widely between trailers,
 accounting for between 0.
70% and 75% of individual trailer
screen-time,
 with shorter appearances being more common (
median = 5s)
.
 
Chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys together accounted for 75% of PA appearances
(
chimpanzees 42%;
 capuchins 33%)
.
 Cercopithecines (
macaques,
 baboons)
 accounted for
13% of occurrences,
 while orangutans accounted for 8% of occurrences,
 and lemurs and
gorillas together accounted for the remaining 4% (
Figure 3)
.
 
Facial expression was obscured in 28% of sequences where PAs were present.
 Bared-
teeth displays (
BTDs)
 accounted for 81s (
19%)
 of PA screen-time and were shown only by
chimpanzees,
 capuchins,
 and orangutans.

 more than twice as frequently as any other taxa (
Figure 4)
.
 According to the subjective  
analysis,
in no instance did a BTD appear in a context that implied fear or submission.
 
Twenty-one trailers (
55%)
 contained one or more PAs whose physical features suggested
they had not reached sexual maturity.
 Eight (
21%)
 contained only PAs who appeared to have
reached adulthood.
 Judgements were impossible for the remaining nine trailers (
24%)
.
 
PAs were shown clothed in 50% of the trailers;
 performing “human” actions (
such as brush-
ing teeth or snowboarding)
 in 58%;
 in anthropogenic environments (
such as cities,
 homes or
offices)
 and with human companions in 87% of trailers each (
Figure 5)
.
 
Discussion
Primate “actors” appeared in a small but steady percentage of English-language,
 CARA-rated
film releases over the past two decades.
 Although the percentage is low,
 the magnitude of the
film industry means that millions of people are likely to have viewed these films;
 more than
two-thirds of the US/
Canadian population went to the movies at least one time in 2013 alone
(
MPAA,
 2013)
.
 Since the majority of PA films were deemed at least partially suitable for younger
viewers,
 it is likely that these films were viewed by a significant number of children.
 
Between 1990 and 2013,
 chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys appeared as live “actors”
in film trailers with far greater frequency than did any other primate taxa.
 This corroborates the
findings of a recent quantitative content analysis of a selection of films ranging from 1908 to
2013,
 in which these taxa were found to be the most commonly used (
Gil Vazquez & Nekaris,
unpublished)
.
 In that study,
 orangutans (
Pongo spp.
)
 were the third most commonly used live
taxa.
 Under the criteria for inclusion in the present study,
 Cercopithecines (
macaques and
 
baboons)
 appeared as PAs more frequently than did orangutans.
 
It is possible that the recent decrease in frequency with which orangutans appear as PAs
reflects and/
or explains an increase in public awareness that they are Critically Endangered
(
IUCN,
 2016)
;
 it may also be that their Endangered status under the Endangered Species Act
in the US (
Endangered Species Act,
 1973)
 has made them more difficult to source since that
listing came into effect in 1970.
 The continued popularity of chimpanzees as PAs,
 despite their
Endangered status (
IUCN,
 2016)
,
 might be due in part to their “split-listing” in the United
States (
where the majority of films included in this study were produced)
.
 Until 2015,
 captive
chimpanzees were not listed as Endangered in the USA (
Anonymous,
 1973)
,
 and thus were
not afforded the stricter protections that covered orangutans.
 Hence,
 they were easier to
source and to use as performers.
 Their continued use may contribute to public misconcep-
tions about their status in the wild;
 while 91% of respondents to a survey carried out at a US
zoo knew that orangutans are threatened with extinction,
 only 66% understood that the same
holds true for chimpanzees in the wild.
 The most commonly given reason for believing that
chimpanzees were not Endangered was that they are often seen in films and other media
(
Ross et al.
,
 2008)
.
 It remains to be seen whether the 2015 change in legislation,
 and/
or
growing pressure from concerned NGOs (
see below)
,
 will change the frequency with which
chimpanzees are used.
 
Although the frequency with which certain taxa are used may have changed over time,
this study indicates that the frequency with which PAs are used overall has remained steady
since 1990.
 An increasing number of publications about the implications of the use of PAs
(
Leighty et al.
,
 2015;
 Ross et al.
,
 2011;
 Schroepfer et al.
,
 2011)
 and campaigns run by
concerned NGOs (
AnimalPledge.
org,
 2014;
 Born Free Foundation,
 2014;
 Eyes on Apes,
2015;
 Wild  
Futures,
 2015)
 could mean that this will change in coming years.
 Indeed,
 in
Aldrich
17
Anthrozoös
AZ 31(1)_Layout 1  1/7/18  12:42 PM  Page 17
 2012,
 the Walt  
Disney Company introduced a policy prohibiting the use of great apes as
entertainers (
Leighty et al.
,
 2015)
.
 However,
 as recently as spring 2015,
 the company has
continued to use capuchin monkey PAs (
Williams,
 2015)
,
 despite the recent publication of
a paper co-authored by one of its own science and environment team demonstrating that
viewing images of capuchin monkeys in anthropocentric contexts increased their  
desirability
as pets,
 and was correlated with confusion about their conservation status in the wild
(
Leighty et al.
,
 2015)
.
Anthropocentric context was one of the criteria for inclusion in this study;
 when quantified,
it took multiple forms.
 Most trailers placed PAs in “human” physical environments (
cars,
 houses,
cities;
 87%)
,
 and/
or with human companions (
87%)
.
 This is unsurprising,
 and may be a by-
product of the criteria for exclusion (
Table 1)
.
 PAs performed “human” actions over half of the
time that they were shown (
58%)
,
 and wore clothing in 50% of shots.
 Despite their prevalence
as expressions of fear or submission,
 in no instance did the context in which BTDs were shown
suggest fear or submission;
 rather,
 it appeared that they were always meant to express
 
pleasure of one sort or another.
 A BTD was present in 19% of trailer screen-time.
 However,
 it
cannot be claimed that PAs are shown “smiling” for such a percentage of all screen-time;
 trail-
ers usually feature the most exciting highlights of the film they are advertising.
 People seem to
think that “smiling” primates are funny;
 hence,
 the wide grin is likely to feature in the trailer.
Nevertheless,
 it’s clear that BTDs are a central part of the way the makers of feature films
choose to portray primates,
 which demonstrates a profound misunderstanding about,
 or a lack
of concern for,
 what the expression normally signifies.
 
It is not certain that an “acting” primate is experiencing the affective state associated with
the action that they have been conditioned to perform.
 There is evidence that chimpanzees
have volitional control over their facial expressions (
Hopkins,
 Taglialatela,
 & Leavens,
 2011)
.
When asked to identify verbally the emotional state most likely to be signified by different fa-
cial expression images,
 multiple experts for both chimpanzees and orangutans stated that
identification was difficult because the expressions looked posed (
Aldrich,
 2015)
.
 It seems
possible that for some PAs,
 “smiling” for the camera may not imply that the animal is actually
experiencing fear or anxiety.
 Questions remain,
 though,
 about how primates are trained to
produce these expressions.
 Is fear or submission actively elicited in order to shape the be-
havior? More relevant to this study,
 however,
 is the question of how the persistent misrepre-
sentation of a normal aspect of primate communication (
the BTD)
 relates to how the public
perceive and understand primates,
 and how this may ultimately affect how they behave toward
primates in real life.
 
That many people misinterpret normal primate behavior is apparent in many of the
 
comments posted beneath popular YouTube videos of pet monkeys,
 such as “Monkey
 
Putting On Makeup” (
Bullock,
 2015)
.
 In the video,
 a macaque named Angel repeatedly grins
while her owner paints her mouth with lipstick.
 Although,
 in macaques,
 this is a well-
 
recognized expression of submission and fear (
Preuschoft,
 2000)
,
 comments such as “She
loves it!” and “You can see with his expressions that he’s enjoying it …” abound.
 While it is
far from certain that children’s understanding and attitudes are directly shaped by enter-
tainment media,
 there is much to indicate that film,
 television,
 and other forms of mass media
play a part (
see Strasburger,
 Donnerstein,
 & Bushman,
 2014 for a useful summarization of
studies)
.
 Taken together with the recent studies discussed earlier on primates in the media
(
Leighty et al.
,
 2015;
 Nekaris et al.
,
 2013;
 Nekaris & Campbell,
 2012;
 Ross et al.
,
 2008,
2011;
 Schroepfer et al.
,
 2011)
,
 it does seem likely that such viewing has contributed to the

18

 development of profound misunderstandings about the way primates normally communicate
and behave.
 
Finally,
 it is worth noting that,
 where individuals charged with enforcing wildlife and animal
welfare laws are unfamiliar with or have developed false impressions about the needs,
 be-
havior,
 and/
or conservation status of nonhuman primates,
 misinterpretations and erroneous
assumptions could negatively impact the welfare of individual primates and the enforcement
of laws protecting biodiversity.
 Such cases have been anecdotally recorded by NGOs in the
UK (
Wild Futures,
 2014)
 and in South America (
Shanee,
 Mendoza,
 & Shanee,

.
