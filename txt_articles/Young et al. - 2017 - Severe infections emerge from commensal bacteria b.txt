Abstract Bacteria responsible for the greatest global mortality colonize the human microbiota
far more frequently than they cause severe infections. Whether mutation and selection among
commensal bacteria are associated with infection is unknown. We investigated de novo mutation in
1163 Staphylococcus aureus genomes from 105 infected patients with nose colonization. We report
that 72% of infections emerged from the nose, with infecting and nose-colonizing bacteria showing
parallel adaptive differences. We found 2.8-to-3.6-fold adaptive enrichments of protein-altering
variants in genes responding to rsp, which regulates surface antigens and toxin production; agr,
which regulates quorum-sensing, toxin production and abscess formation; and host-derived
antimicrobial peptides. Adaptive mutations in pathogenesis-associated genes were 3.1-fold
enriched in infecting but not nose-colonizing bacteria. None of these signatures were observed in
healthy carriers nor at the species-level, suggesting infection-associated, short-term, within-host
selection pressures. Our results show that signatures of spontaneous adaptive evolution are
specifically associated with infection, raising new possibilities for diagnosis and treatment.

Introduction
Infections remain a leading cause of global mortality, with bacterial pathogens among the greatest
concern (GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators, 2016). However, many of the
bacteria imposing the greatest burden of mortality, such as Staphylococcus aureus, are frequently

 found as commensal components of the body’s microbiota (Turnbaugh et al., 2007). For them,
infection is a relatively uncommon event that is often unnecessary (Casadevall et al., 2011;
Me
´thot and Alizon, 2014), and perhaps disadvantageous (Brown et al., 2012), for onward trans-
mission. Genomics is shedding light on important bacterial traits such as host-specificity, toxicity and
antimicrobial resistance (Sheppard et al., 2013; Laabei et al., 2014; Chewapreecha et al., 2014;
Chen et al., 2015; Earle et al., 2016). These approaches offer new opportunities to understand the
role of genetics and within-host evolution in the outcome of human interactions with major bacterial
pathogens (Didelot et al., 2016).
Several lines of evidence support a plausible role for within-host evolution influencing the viru-
lence of bacterial pathogens. Common bacterial infections, including S. aureus, are often associated
with colonization of the nose by a genetically similar strain. In these patients, the nose is considered
the likely source of infection because the nose is more often the site of asymptomatic colonization
than any other body site (von Eiff et al., 2001; Kluytmans et al., 1997; Yang et al., 2010). Genome
sequencing suggests that bacteria mutate much more quickly than previously accepted, and this
confers a potent ability to adapt, for example evolving antimicrobial resistance de novo within indi-
vidual patients (Howden et al., 2011; Eldholm et al., 2014). Opportunistic pathogens infecting cys-
tic fibrosis patients have been found to rapidly adapt to the lung environment, with strong evidence
of parallel evolution across patients (Lieberman et al., 2011; Marvig et al., 2013; Markussen et al.,
2014; Lieberman et al., 2014; Marvig et al., 2015). However, the selection pressures associated
with antimicrobial resistance and opportunistic infections of cystic fibrosis patients may not typify
within-host adaptation in common commensal pathogens that have co-evolved with humans for
thousands or millions of years (Moeller et al., 2016; Lees et al., 2017).
Candidate gene studies have demonstrated that substitutions in certain regions, notably quorum-
sensing systems such as the S. aureus accessory gene regulator (agr), arise particularly quickly in vivo
and in culture (Traber et al., 2008). The agr operon encodes a pheromone that coordinates a shift
at higher cell densities from production of surface proteins promoting biofilm formation to produc-
tion of secreted toxins and proteases promoting inflammation and dispersal (Novick and Geisinger,
2008). Mutants typically produce the pheromone but no longer respond to it (Painter et al., 2014).
The evolution of agr has been variously ascribed to directional selection (Sakoulas et al., 2009), bal-
ancing selection (Robinson et al., 2005), social cheating (Pollitt et al., 2014) and life-history trade-
off (Shopsin et al., 2010). However, the role of agr mutants in infection remains unclear, since they
are frequently sampled from both asymptomatic carriage and severe infections (Smyth et al., 2012;
Painter et al., 2014).
Whole-genome sequencing case studies add weight to the idea that within-host evolution plays
an important role in infection. In one persistent S. aureus infection, a single mutation was sufficient
to permanently activate the stringent stress response, reducing growth, colony size and experimen-
tally measured infection severity (Gao et al., 2010). In another patient, we found that bloodstream
bacteria differed from those initially colonizing the nose by several mutations including loss-of-func-
tion of the rsp regulator (Young et al., 2012). Functional follow-up revealed that the rsp mutant
expressed reduced cytotoxicity (Laabei et al., 2015), but maintained the ability to cause dissemi-
nated infection (Das et al., 2016). Unexpectedly, we found that bloodstream-infecting bacteria
exhibit lower cytotoxicity than nose-colonizing bacteria more generally (Laabei et al., 2015). These
results raise the question: are unique hallmarks of de novo mutation and selection associated with
bacterial evolution in severely infected patients?
We addressed this question by investigating the genetic variants arising from within-patient evo-
lution of S. aureus sampled from 105 patients with concurrent nose colonization and blood or deep
tissue infection. We annotated variants to test for systematic differences between colonizing and
infecting bacteria. We discovered several groups of genes showing significant enrichments of pro-
tein-altering variants compared to other genes, indicating adaptive evolution. For genes implicated
in pathogenesis, adaptive mutants were limited to infecting bacteria, while other pathways showed
adaptation in the nose and infection site. Adaptive enrichments were not observed in asymptomatic
carriers, nor between unrelated bacteria, indicating evolution in response to infection-associated,
within-host selection pressures. Our results reveal that adaptive evolution of genes involved in regu-
lation, toxin production, abscess formation, cell-cell communication and bacterial-host interaction
drives parallel differentiation between commensal constituents of the nose and infecting bacteria,
providing new insights into the evolution of infection in a major pathogen.

 Results
Infecting bacteria are typically descended from the patient’s
commensal bacteria
We identified 105 patients suffering severe S. aureus infections admitted to hospitals in Oxford and
Brighton, England, for whom we could recover contemporaneous nose swabs from admission
screening. Of the 105 patients, 55 had bloodstream infections, 37 had soft tissue infections and 13
had bone and joint infections (Table 1). The infection was most often sampled on the same day as
the nose, with an interquartile range of 1 day earlier to 2 days later (Supplementary file 1).
To discover de novo mutations within and between S. aureus in the nose and infection site, we
whole-genome sequenced 1163 bacterial colonies, a median of 5 per site. We detected single-nucle-
otide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short insertions/deletions (indels) using previously developed, com-
bined reference-based mapping and de novo assembly approaches (Young et al., 2012;
Golubchik et al., 2013; Iqbal et al., 2012). We identified 35 distinct strains, defined by multilocus
sequence type (ST), across patients (Supplementary file 1). As expected (von Eiff et al., 2001),
most patients possessed extremely closely related nose-colonizing and infecting bacteria, sharing
the same ST and differing by 0–66 variants (95 patients). The nose-colonizing and infecting bacteria
of nine patients were unrelated, possessing different STs and differing by 9398–50573 variants (e.g.
Figure 1A). In one further patient, we deemed the nose-colonizing and infecting bacteria to be unre-
lated despite sharing the same ST because they differed by 1104 variants, far outside the within-ST
variation evident in any individual nose or infection site (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), and corre-
sponding to around 70 years of divergence based on our previous estimates of within-host evolution
(Young et al., 2012). In 9/95 patients with extremely closely related nose-colonizing and infecting
bacteria, another, unrelated ST was also present in the nose (six patients) or the infection site (three
patients); we excluded these unrelated bacteria from further analysis. After excluding variants differ-
entiating unrelated nose-colonizing and infecting bacteria, we catalogued 1322 de novo mutations
that we deemed arose within the 105 patients.
In patients with closely related strains, the within-patient population structure was always consis-
tent with a unique migration event from the nose to the infection site, or occasionally, vice versa.
Infecting and nose-colonizing bacteria usually formed closely related but distinct populations with no
shared genotypes (74/95 patients, e.g. Figure 1B), separated by a mean of 5.7 variants. There was
never more than one identical genotype between nose-colonizing and infecting bacteria, (21/95
patients, e.g. Figure 1C), indicating that the migration event from one population to the other
involved a small number of founding bacteria (Moxon and Murphy, 1978; Margolis and Levin,
2007; Prajsnar et al., 2012). In such patients, the shared genotype likely represents the migrating
genotype itself. Population structure did not differ significantly between infection types (p=0.38,
Table 1). Genetic diversity in the nose (mean pairwise distance, p = 2.8 variants) was similar to that
previously observed in asymptomatic nasal carriers (Golubchik et al., 2013) (Reference Panel I,
p = 4.1, p=0.13), but was significantly lower in the infection site (p = 0.6, p=10–10.0), revealing lim-
ited diversification post-infection.
In most patients, the infection appeared to be descended from the nose. We used 1149 sequen-
ces from other patients and carriers (Reference Panel II) to reconstruct the most recent common

 ancestor (MRCA) for the 95/105 (90%) patients with related nose-colonizing and infecting bacteria.
We thereby distinguished wild type from mutant alleles. In 49 such patients, we could determine the
ancestral population. The nose population was likely ancestral in 39/49 (80% of patients with related
strains, or 72% of all patients) because all infecting bacteria shared de novo mutations in common
that distinguished them from the MRCA, whereas nose-colonizing bacteria did not. In 16 of those,
confidence was high because both mutant and ancestral alleles were observed in the nose, confirm-
ing it as the origin of the de novo mutation (e.g. Figure 1D). Conversely, in 10/49 patients, bacteria
colonizing the nose were likely descended from blood or deep tissue infections (20% of patients
with related strains, or 18% of all patients) (e.g. Figure 1F). Confidence was high for just three of
those patients, and they showed unusually high diversity (Supplementary data, P063, P072, P093),
suggesting that in persistent infections, infecting bacteria can recolonize the nose.
Protein-truncating mutants are over-represented within infected
patients
To help identify variants that could promote, or be promoted by, infection of the blood and deep
tissue by bacteria colonizing the nose, we reconstructed within-patient phylogenies and classified
variants by their position in the phylogeny. Sequencing multiple colonies per site enabled us to clas-
sify variants into those representing genuine differences between nose-colonizing and infection pop-
ulations (B-class), variants specific to the nose-colonizing population (C-class) and variants specific to
the disease-causing infection population (D-class). We hypothesized that B-class variants would be
most enriched for variants promoting, or promoted by, infection, if such variants occur (Figure 1G).
We cross-classified variants by their predicted functional effect: synonymous, non-synonymous or
truncating within protein-coding sequences, or non-coding (Table 2, Supplementary file 2). As
expected, the prevailing tendency of selection within patients was to conserve protein sequences,
with dN/dS ratios indicating rates of non-synonymous change 0.55, 0.68 and 0.63 times the rate
expected under strict neutral evolution for B-, C- and D-class variants, respectively.
In a longitudinal study of one long-term carrier, we previously reported that a burst of protein-
truncating variants punctuated the transition from asymptomatic nose carriage to infection
(Young et al., 2012). Here, we found a 3.9-fold over-abundance of protein-truncating variants of all
phylogenetic classes in infected patients compared to asymptomatic carriers (Reference Panel I,
p=0.002, Table 2), supporting the conclusion that loss-of-function mutations are disproportionately
associated with evolution within infected patients. This may reflect a reduction in the efficiency with
which selection removes deleterious protein-truncating mutations, and provides evidence of a sys-
tematic difference in selection within severely infected patients.

asymptomatic nose carriers.
Neutrality indices (McDonald and Kreitman, 1991; Rand and Kann, 1996) were defined as the odds ratio of mutation counts relative
to synonymous variants in patients versus asymptomatic nose carriers (Reference Panel I). Those significant at p<0.05 and p<0.005 are
emboldened and underlined respectively.

 Quorum sensing and cell-adhesion proteins exhibit adaptive evolution
between nose-colonizing and infecting bacteria
We hypothesized that variants associated with infection would be enriched among the protein-alter-
ing B-class variants between the nose and infection site (Figure 1G). Therefore, we aggregated
mutations by genes in a well-annotated reference genome, MRSA252, and tested each gene for an
excess of non-synonymous and protein-truncating B-class variants compared to other genes, taking
into account the length of the genes. Aggregating by gene was necessary because 1318/1322 var-
iants were unique to single patients. The two exceptions involved non-coding variants arising in two
patients each, one B-class variant 130 bases upstream of azlC, an azaleucine resistance protein
(SAR0010), and one D-class variant 88 bases upstream of eapH1, a secreted serine protease inhibitor
(SAR2295) (Stapels et al., 2014).
We found a significant excess of five protein-altering B-class variants representing a 58.3-fold
enrichment in agrA, which encodes the response regulator that mediates activation of the quorum-
sensing system at high cell densities (p=10–7.5, Figure 2A, Table 3). The clfB gene encoding clump-
ing factor B, which binds human fibrinogen and loricrin (Foster et al., 2013), showed an excess of
five protein-altering B-class variants, representing a 15.9-fold enrichment that was near genome-
wide significance after multiple testing correction (p=10–4.7). Both signals of enrichment produced
neutrality indices exceeding one, consistent with adaptive evolution (Supplementary file 3).
Previously, we identified a truncating mutation in the transcriptional regulator rsp to be the most
likely candidate for involvement in the progression to infection in one long-term nasal carrier
(Young et al., 2012). Although we observed just one variant in rsp among the 105 patients (3.9-fold
enrichment, p=0.27), we found it was a non-synonymous B-class variant resulting in an alanine to
proline substitution in the regulator’s helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain. In separately published

 experiments (Das et al., 2016), we demonstrated that this and the original mutation induce similar
loss-of-function phenotypes which, like agr loss-of-function mutants, express reduced cytotoxicity,
but maintained an ability to persist, disseminate and cause abscesses in vivo.
We found no significant enrichments of protein-altering variants among D-class variants, but we
observed a significant excess of six protein-altering C-class variants in pbp2 which encodes a penicil-
lin binding protein involved in cell wall synthesis (19.0-fold enrichment, p=10–6.0, Figure 2—figure
supplement 1A). Pbp2 is an important target of b-lactam antibiotics (Łeski and Tomasz, 2005),
revealing adaption – potentially in response to antibiotic treatment – in the nose populations of
some patients.
Genes modulated by virulence regulators and antimicrobial peptides
show adaptive evolution between colonizing and infecting bacteria
To improve the sensitivity to identify adaptive evolution associated with infection, we developed a
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approach in which we tested for enrichments of protein-altering
B-class variants among groups of genes. GSEA allowed us to detect signatures of adaptive evolution
in groups of related genes that were not apparent when interrogating individual genes.

 We grouped genes in two different ways: by gene ontology and by expression pathway. First, we
obtained a gene ontology for the reference genome from BioCyc (Caspi et al., 2016), which classi-
fies genes into biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. There were 552
unique gene ontology groupings of two or more genes. We tested for an enrichment among genes
belonging to the ontology, compared to the rest of the genes.
Second, we obtained 248 unique expression pathways from the SAMMD database of transcrip-
tional studies (Nagarajan and Elasri, 2007). For each expression pathway, genes were classified as
up-regulated, down-regulated or not differentially regulated in response to experimentally manipu-
lated growth conditions or expression of a regulatory gene. For each expression pathway, we tested
for an enrichment in genes that were up- or down-regulated compared to genes not differentially
regulated.
The most significant enrichment for protein-altering B-class variants between nose and infection
sites occurred in the group of genes down-regulated by the cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP)
ovispirin-1 (p=10–7.8), with a similar enrichment in genes down-regulated by temporin L exposure
(p=10–6.9, Figure 2C). Like human CAMPs, the animal-derived ovispirin and temporin compounds
inhibit epithelial infections by killing phagocytosed bacteria and mediating inflammatory responses
(Pietia
¨inen et al., 2009). In response to inhibitory levels of ovispirin and temporin, agr, surface-
expressed adhesins and secreted toxins are all down-regulated. Collectively, down-regulated genes
showed 2.7-fold and 2.8-fold enrichments of adaptive evolution, respectively. Conversely, genes up-
regulated in response to CAMPs, including the vraSR and vraDE cell-wall operons and stress
response genes (Pietia
¨inen et al., 2009), exhibited 0.4-fold and 0.7-fold enrichments (i.e. deple-
tions), respectively (Table 3). Thus, expression of the genes undergoing adaptive evolution is
strongly inhibited in vitro by host-derived antimicrobial peptides.
Genes belonging to the cell wall ontology showed the second most significant enrichment for
adaptive evolution (p=10–7.0). Genes contributing to this 5.0-fold enrichment included the immuno-
globulin-binding S. aureus Protein A (spa), the serine rich adhesin for platelets (sasA), clumping fac-
tors A and B (clfA, clfB), fibronectin binding protein A (fnbA) and bone sialic acid binding protein
(bbp). The latter four genes contributed to another statistically significant 6.4-fold enrichment of
adaptive protein evolution in the cell adhesion ontology (p=10–6.5, Figure 3). Therefore, there is a
general enrichment of surface-expressed host-binding antigens undergoing adaptive evolution.
The rsp regulon showed the most significant enrichment among gene sets defined by response
to individual bacterial regulators (p=10–6.4). Genes down-regulated by rsp in exponential phase
(Lei et al., 2011), including surface antigens and the urease operon, exhibited a 3.6-fold enrichment
for adaptive evolution, while up-regulated genes showed 0.6-fold enrichment. So whereas rsp loss-
of-function mutants were rare per se, genes up-regulated in such mutants were hotspots of within-
patient adaptation in infected patients. Since expression is a prerequisite for adaptive protein evolu-
tion, this implies there are alternative routes by which genes down-regulated by intact rsp can be
expressed and thereby play an important role within patients other than direct inactivation of rsp.
Loss-of-function in agr mutants represent one alternative route, since they exhibit similar pheno-
types to rsp mutants, with reduced cytotoxicity and increased surface antigen expression, albeit
reduced ability to form abscesses (Das et al., 2016). We found significant enrichments of genes reg-
ulated by agrA in two different backgrounds (p<10–4.5) and by sarA (p=10–4.6), underlining the influ-
ence of adaptive evolution on both secreted and surface-expressed proteins during infection. We
found that expression of genes enriched for protein-altering substitutions was also altered in strains
possessing reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, although not in a consistent direction across strains
(p<10–4.7), and to pine-oil disinfectant (p=10–4.4), suggesting such genes may be generally involved
in response to harsh environments. All significant signals of enrichment produced neutrality indices
exceeding one, consistent with adaptive evolution (Supplementary file 3).
Several genes contributed to multiple evolutionary signals, particularly cell-wall anchored proteins
involved in adhesion, the infection process and immune evasion (Foster et al., 2013), including
fnbA, clfA, clfB, sasA and spa. These multifactorial, partially overlapping signals suggest a large tar-
get for selection in adapting to the within-patient environment (Figure 3). The fact that we observed
no comparable significant enrichments in C-class and D-class protein-altering variants (Figure 2—fig-
ure supplement 1) indicates that these evolutionary patterns are associated specifically with the
infection process.

 Adaptive evolution in pathogenesis genes is found only in infecting
bacteria
Having identified adaptive evolution differentiating nose-colonizing and infection-causing bacteria,
we next asked whether the mutant alleles were preferentially found in the nose or infection site. We
used 1149 sequences from other patients or carriers (Reference Panel II) to reconstruct the genotype
of the MRCA of nose-colonizing and infecting bacteriain each patient, respectively. This allowed us
to sub-classify B-class variants by whether the mutant allele was found in the nose-colonizing bacte-
ria (BC-class) or the disease-causing infection site bacteria (BD-class).
A priori, we had expected the enrichments of adaptive evolution to be driven primarily by
mutants occurring in the infection-causing bacteria (BD-class). One group of genes showed a signal
of such an enrichment among BD-class variants specifically. Genes belonging to the BioCyc patho-
genesis ontology were marginally genome-wide significant in BD-class variants, showing a 3.1-fold
enrichment (p=10–4.6) and a statistically insignificant 1.7-fold enrichment in BC-class variants
(p=0.13). BD-class mutants driving this differential signal arose in toxins including gamma hemolysin
and several regulatory loci implicated in toxicity and virulence regulation: rot, sarS and saeR.
Surprisingly, however, we found that all other significantly enriched gene sets were driven by
mutant alleles occurring both in nose-colonizing and infecting bacteria (Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 2). This indicates there are common selection pressures in the nose and infection site during
the process of infection within patients, leading to convergent evolution across body sites. So while
adaptation in pathogenesis genes appears specifically infection-associated, other signals of adapta-
tion in severely infected patients are driven by selection pressures, which might compensate for an
altered within-host environment during infection, that are as likely to favor mutants in nose-coloniz-
ing bacteria as infecting bacteria.
Signals of adaptation are specific to infected patients and differ from
prevailing signatures of selection
Two lines of evidence show that the newly discovered signatures of within-host adaptive evolution,
both in infecting and nose-colonizing bacteria, are unique to evolution in infected patients. To test
this theory against the alternative explanation that our approach merely detects the most rapidly
evolving proteins, we searched for similar signals in alternative settings: evolution within asymptom-
atic carriers, and species-level evolution between unrelated bacteria.
There was no significant enrichment of protein-altering variants in any gene, ontology or pathway
among 235 variants identified from 10 longitudinally sampled asymptomatic nasal carriers (Reference
Panel III, Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Supplementary file 4). To address the modest sample
size, we performed goodness-of-fit tests, focusing on the signals most significantly enriched in
patients. We found significant depletions of protein-altering variants in carriers relative to patients in
the
rsp,
agr
and
sarA
regulons
(p=10–4.0)
and
the
pathogenesis
ontology
(p=10–3.2,
Supplementary file 5).
Nor were the relative rates of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution (dN/dS) higher
between unrelated S. aureus (Reference Panel IV) in the genes that contributed most to the signals
associated with adaptation within patients: agrA, agrC clfA, clfB, fnbA and sasA. Although synony-
mous diversity was somewhat higher than typical in these genes, the dN/dS ratios showed no evi-
dence for excess protein-altering change in these compared to other genes (Figure 3—figure
supplement 1). Accordingly, incorporating this locus-specific variability of dN/dS into the GSEA did
not affect the results (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Taken together these lines of evidence show
that the ontologies, pathways and genes significantly differentiated between nose-colonizing and
infecting bacteria arise in response to selection pressures specifically associated with infected
patients, and are not repeated in asymptomatic carriers or species-level evolution.
Discussion
We found that common, life-threatening infections of S. aureus are frequently descended from com-
mensal bacteria colonizing the nose. These infections are associated with repeatable patterns of bac-
terial evolution driven by within-patient mutation and selection. Genes involved in pathogenesis,
notably toxins and regulators, showed evidence for adaptation in infecting but not nose-colonizing

 bacteria. Surprisingly, other signatures of adaptation occurred in parallel in nose-colonizing and
infecting bacteria, affecting genes responding to cationic antimicrobial peptides and the virulence
regulators rsp and agr. Such genes mediate toxin production, abscess formation, immune evasion
and bacterial-host binding. Adaptation within both regulator and effector genes reveals that multi-
ple, alternative evolutionary paths are targeted by selection in infected patients.
The signatures of within-patient adaptation that we found differed from prevailing signals of
selection at the species level. This discordance means that infection-associated adaptive mutations
within patients are rarely transmitted, and argues against a straightforward host-pathogen arms race
as the predominant evolutionary force acting within and between patients. Instead, it supports the
notion of a life-history trade-off between adaptations favoring colonization and infection distinct
from those favoring dissemination and onward transmission (Shopsin et al., 2010). Infection of this
sort can be characterized in terms of an ecological source-sink model, in which commensal bacteria
provide the source for potentially life-threatening infections (Sokurenko et al., 2006). Ultimately,
the short-term survival advantage gained by infecting bacteria, analogous to the short-term advan-
tage of cancerous cells derived from the host, may lead to the demise of both the host and patho-
gen, epitomizing a tragedy of the commons (Rankin et al., 2007). As such, infection may represent
an ever-present risk of mutation among commensal bacteria favored by short-term selection but ulti-
mately incidental or damaging to the bacterial reproductive life cycle.
We did not observe analogous signatures of bacterial adaptation and excess loss-of-function
mutations in healthy nose carriers, indicating that risk factors for infections, such as a weakened or
over-activated immunological response, comorbidities or medical interventions, may play an impor-
tant role in creating distinctive selection pressures in infected patients. The effects of such risk fac-
tors may be mediated, at least in part, through the selection pressure they exert on commensal
bacteria.
The existence of signatures of adaptive substitutions associated with infection raises the possibil-
ity of developing new diagnostic techniques and personalizing treatment to the individual patient’s
commensal bacteria. The ability of genomics to characterize the selective forces driving adaption
within the human body in unprecedented detail provides new opportunities to improve experimental
models of infection. Ultimately, it may be possible to develop therapies that utilize our new under-
standing of within-patient evolution to target the root causes of infection from the bacterial
perspective.
Materials and methods
Patient sample collection
105 patients with severe S. aureus infections for whom the organism could be cultured from both
admission screening nasal swab and clinical sample were identified prospectively from the microbio-
logical laboratories of hospitals in Oxford and Brighton, England. This study design builds in robust-
ness to potential confounders by matching infection-causing and nose-colonizing bacteria within the
same patients. Clinical samples comprised 55 blood cultures and 50 pus, soft tissue, bone or joint
samples. The bacteria sampled and sequenced from one patient (‘patient S’, P005 in this study) have
been previously described (Das et al., 2016). Five individuals had both blood and another culture-
positive clinical sample; we focus analysis on the blood sample. Nasal swabs were incubated in 5%
NaCl broth overnight at 37C, then streaked onto SASelect agar (BioRad) and incubated overnight at
37C. We picked five colonies per sample (12 during the pilot phase involving 9 patients), streaked
each onto Columbia blood agar and incubated overnight at 37C for DNA extraction. Clinical sam-
ples were handled according to the local laboratory standard operating procedure for pus, sterile
site and blood cultures. When bacterial growth was confirmed as S. aureus, the primary culture plate
was retrieved, and multiple colonies were picked. These were streaked onto Columbia blood agar
and incubated overnight at 37C for DNA extraction.
Power calculation for within-patient sample sizes
Sequencing multiple colonies per site allowed us to distinguish genuine genetic substitutions
between nose-colonizing and infection-causing bacteria from polymorphic variants restricted to the
nose-colonizing or infection-causing bacteria respectively. Following previous studies of within-host

 S. aureus evolution that we conducted (Young et al., 2012; Golubchik et al., 2013) and the initial
pilot phase in which we sequenced 12 colonies per site, we chose to continue with five colonies per
site as a compromise between power to distinguish within-site polymorphisms from true between-
site substitutions and the cost of whole genome sequencing. Under a standard neutral model with
low mutation rate, five colonies per sample is expected to confer 91% power to correctly distinguish
within-site polymorphisms from between-site substitutions, compared to 0% power with one colony
per sample. The power calculation is

power would be greater because mutant alleles would be biased yet more toward low frequencies.
Reference panels
For comparison to the patient-derived bacteria, we collated previously described samples from
other sources to construct four Reference Panels: I. A collection of 131 genomes capturing cross-sec-
tional diversity in the noses of 13 asymptomatic carriers (Golubchik et al., 2013), arising from a car-
riage study of S. aureus in Oxfordshire (Everitt et al., 2014) (BioProject PRJEB2881). II. A
compilation of 95 unrelated samples from the same Oxfordshire carriage study (BioProject accession
number PRJEB5225), 145 sequences from a study of within-host evolution of S. aureus in three indi-
viduals (Young et al., 2012) (BioProject PRJEB2862) and 909 sequences from nasal carriage and
bloodstream infection used in a study of whole genome sequencing to predict antimicrobial resis-
tance (Gordon et al., 2014) (BioProject PRJEB5261). We used these samples to improve our recon-
struction of ancestral genotypes in each patient. III. A collection of 237 genomes from longitudinal
samples from 10 patients (Golubchik et al., 2013; Gordon et al., 2017), (BioProject PRJNA380544)
arising from the same Oxfordshire carriage study. We used these to compare evolution within
patients and asymptomatic carriers. IV. A collection of 16 previously published high-quality closed
reference genomes, comprising unrelated isolates mainly of clinical and animal origin: MRSA252
(Genbank accession number BX571856.1), MSSA476 (BX571857.1), COL (CP000046.1), NCTC 8325

We used these to contrast species-level evolution to within-patient evolution.
Whole genome sequencing
For each bacterial colony, DNA was extracted from the subcultured plate using a mechanical lysis
step (FastPrep; MPBiomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) followed by a commercial kit (QuickGene; Fujifilm,
Tokyo, Japan), and sequenced at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford on the Illu-
mina (San Diego, CA) HiSeq 2000 platform, with paired-end reads 101 base pairs for nine patients in
the pilot phase, and 150 bases in the remainder. We sequenced 62 genomes in duplicate, a technical
replication rate of 5.1%; no genetic discordancies were detected within duplicates.
Variant calling
We used Velvet (Zerbino and Birney, 2008) to assemble reads into contigs de novo, and Stampy
(Lunter

(Holden et al., 2004) and a patient-specific reference comprising the contigs assembled for one col-
ony sampled from each patient’s nose. Repetitive regions, defined by BLASTing (Altschul et al.,
1990) the reference genome against itself, were masked prior to variant calling. To obtain multilocus

 sequence types (Enright et al., 2000), we used BLAST to find the relevant loci, and looked up the
nucleotide sequences in the online database at http://saureus.mlst.net/.
Bases called at each position in the reference and those passing previously described
(Young et al., 2012; Golubchik et al., 2013; Didelot et al., 2012) quality filters were used to iden-
tify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from Stampy-based mapping to MRSA252 and the
patient-specific reference genomes. We used Cortex (Iqbal et al., 2012) to identify SNPs and short
indels. Variants found by Cortex were excluded if they had fewer than ten supporting reads or if the
base call was heterozygous at more than 5% of reads.
Where physically clustered variants with the same pattern of presence/absence across genomes
were found, these were considered likely to represent a single evolutionary event: tandem repeat
mutation or recombination. These were de-duplicated to a single variant to avoid inflating evidence
of evolutionary events in these regions.
Variant annotation and phylogenetic classification
Maximum likelihood trees were built to infer bacterial relationships within patients (Gusfield, 1991).
To prioritize variants for further analysis, they were classified according to their phylogenetic position
in the tree: B-class (between nose colonization and infection site), C-class (within nose-colonizing
population) and D-class (within infection site population). Variants were cross-classified by their pre-
dicted functional effect based on mapping to the reference genome or BLASTing to a reference
allele: synonymous, non-synonymous or truncating for protein-coding sequences, or non-coding.
Where variation was found using a patient-specific reference, these variants were annotated by
first aligning to MRSA252 using Mauve (Darling et al., 2004). If no aligned position in MRSA252
could be found, additional annotated references were used. Where variation was found using Cortex
only, the variant was annotated by first locating it by comparing the flanking sequence to MRSA252
and other annotated references using BLAST. MRSA252 orthologs were identified using geneDB
(Logan-Klumpler et al., 2012) and KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2016).
Reconstructing ancestral genotypes per patient
We constructed a species-level phylogeny for all bacteria sampled from the 105 patients together
with Reference Panel II (unrelated asymptomatic nose-colonization isolates and bloodstream infec-
tion isolates) using a two-step neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood approach, based on a
whole-genome alignment derived from mapping all genomes to MRSA252. We first clustered indi-
viduals into seven groups using neighbour-joining (Saitou and Nei, 1987), before resolving the rela-
tionships
within
each
cluster
by
building
a
maximum
likelihood
tree
using
RAxML
(Stamatakis, 2014), assuming a general time reversible (GTR) model. To overcome a limitation in
the presence of divergent sequences whereby RAxML fixes a minimum branch length that may be
longer than a single substitution event, we fine-tuned the estimates of branch lengths using Clonal-
FrameML (Didelot and Wilson, 2015). We used these subtrees to identify, for each patient, the
most closely related ‘nearest neighbor’ sampled from another patient or carrier. We employed this
nearest neighbor as an outgroup, and used the tree to reconstruct the sequence of the MRCA of
colonizing and infecting bacteria for each patient using a maximum likelihood method (Pupko et al.,
2000) in ClonalFrameML (Didelot and Wilson, 2015). This in turn allowed us to identify the ancestral
(wild type) and derived (mutant) allele for all variants mapping to MRSA252. For variants not map-
ping to MRSA252, we repeated the Cortex variant calling analysis, this time including the nearest
neighbor, and identified the ancestral allele as the one possessed by the nearest neighbor. This
approach allowed us to identify ancestral (wild type) versus derived (mutant) alleles for 97% of
within-patient variants. We used the reconstructions of the within-patient MRCA sequences and
identity of ancestral vs derived alleles to sub-categorize B-class variants into those in which the
mutant allele was found in the nose-colonizing population (BC-class) versus the infection-causing
population (BD-class). 521 (97%) of B-class variants were typeable, and in 281 (54%) of these, the
mutant allele was found in the infection site population. This allowed us to test for differential enrich-
ments in these two sub-classes.

 Mean pairwise genetic diversity
Separately for the nose site and infection site of each patient, we calculated the mean pairwise diver-
sity p as the mean number of variants differing between each pair of genomes. We compared the
distributions of p between patients and Reference Panel II (13 cross-sectionally sampled asymptom-
atic nose carriers) using a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test.
Calculating dN/dS ratio
For assessing the dN/dS ratio within patients, we adjusted the ratio of raw counts of total numbers of
non-synonymous and synonymous SNPs by the ratio expected under strict neutrality. We estimated
that the rate of non-synonymous mutation was 4.9 times higher than that of synonymous mutation in
S. aureus based on codon usage in MRSA252 and the observed transition:transversion ratio in non-
coding SNPs.
The neutrality index
To compare the relative dN/dS ratios between two groups of variants we computed a Neutrality
Index as R1/R2 where R1 and R2 were the ratio of counts of non-synonymous to synonymous variants
in each group respectively (McDonald and Kreitman, 1991; Rand and Kann, 1996). We compared
B-, C- and D-class variants within patients to C-class patients within Reference Panel I (13 cross-sec-
tionally sampled asymptomatic carriers). A Neutrality Index in excess of one indicates a higher dN/dS
ratio in the former group. We used Fisher’s exact test to evaluate the significance of the differences
between the groups.
Gene enrichment analysis
To test for significant enrichment of variants in a particular gene, we employed a Poisson regression
in which we modelled the expected numbers of de novo variants across patients in any gene j as l0Lj
under the null hypothesis of no enrichment, where l0 gives the expected number of variants per kilo-
base and Lj is the length of gene j in kilobases. We compared this to the alternative hypothesis in
which the expected number of variants was liLi for gene i, the gene of interest, and l1Lj for any
other gene j. Using R (R Core Team, 2015), we estimated the parameters l0, l1 and li from the
data by maximum likelihood and tested for significance via a likelihood ratio test with one degree of
freedom. This procedure assumes no recombination within patients, which was reasonable since we
found little evidence of recombination in this study or previously (Golubchik et al., 2013), including
no within-host genetic incompatibilities, and we removed physically clustered variants associated
with possible recombination events. We analyzed all protein-coding genes in MRSA252, testing for
an enrichment of variants expected to alter the transcribed protein (both non-synonymous and trun-
cating mutations). These tests were also applied to synonymous mutations and no enrichments were
found.
Gene set enrichment analysis
Since the number of genes outweighed the number of variants detected, we had limited power to
detect weak to modest enrichments at the individual gene level. Instead we pooled genes using
ontologies from the BioCyc MRSA252 database (Caspi et al., 2016) and expression pathways from
the SAMMD database of transcriptional studies (Nagarajan and Elasri, 2007). The BioCyc database
comprises ontologies describing biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions.
The SAMMD database groups genes up-regulated, down-regulated or not differentially regulated in
response to experimentally manipulated growth conditions or isogenic mutations, usually of a regu-
latory gene. After excluding ontologies or pathways with two groups, one involving a single gene,
and combining ontologies or pathways with identical groupings of genes, we conducted 800 GSEAs
in addition to the 2650 ontologies comprised of individual loci. The number of groupings of genes
was always two for BioCyc (included/excluded from the ontology) and two or three for SAMMD
(up-/down-/un-differentially regulated in the experiment). Again we employed a Poisson regression
in which we modelled the expected numbers of variants in any gene j as l0Lj under the null hypothe-
sis of no enrichment where l0 gives the expected number of variants per kilobase and Lj is the length
of gene j in kilobases. We compared this to the alternative hypothesis in which the expected number
of variants was l1Lj, l2Lj or l3Lj for gene j depending on the grouping in the ontology/pathway.

 Using R, we estimated the parameters l0, l1, l2 and l3 from the data by maximum likelihood and
tested for significance via a likelihood ratio test with one or two degrees of freedom, depending on
the number of groupings in the ontology/pathway.
GSEA multiple testing correction
To account for the multiplicity of testing, we adjusted the p-value significance thresholds from a
nominal a = 0.05 using the weighted Bonferroni method. We weighted the significance thresholds
by the relative number of tests in each category: 2650 genes, 552 BioCyc ontologies and 248
SAMMD expression pathways. This avoids overly stringent multiple testing correction in categories
with fewer tests (Roeder and Wasserman, 2009), for example, the 248 SAMMD expression path-
ways, owing to other categories with very large numbers of tests, for example, the 2650 genes. This
gave adjusted significance thresholds of 10-5.2 for genes, 10-4.5 for BioCyc ontologies and 10-4.2 for
SAMMD expression pathways.
Longitudinal evolution in asymptomatic carriers
To test whether the patterns of evolution we observed between colonizing and invading bacteria in
severely infected patients were typical or unusual, we analyzed Reference Panel III (a collection of 10
longitudinally sampled asymptomatic carriers). Since natural selection is more efficacious over longer
periods of time, the longitudinal sampling of these individuals gave us greater opportunity to detect
subtle evolutionary patterns in asymptomatic carriers. We characterized variation in these carriers as
in the patients. Given the modest sample size and smaller number of variants detected in these indi-
viduals (235), we performed GSEA to test for enrichments only in particular genes, ontologies and
pathways that were significantly enriched within patients, requiring less stringent multiple testing
correction.
omegaMap analysis
We estimated dN/dS ratios between unrelated S. aureus to characterize the prevailing patterns of
selection at the species level. We used Mauve (Darling et al., 2004) to pairwise align 15 reference
genomes against MRSA252, that is Reference Panel IV. This allowed us to distinguish orthologs from
paralogs in the next step in which we multiply aligned all coding sequences overlapping those in
MRSA252 using PAGAN (Lo
¨ytynoja et al., 2012). After removing sequences with premature stop
codons, we analyzed each alignment of between two and 16 genes using a modification of omega-
Map (Wilson and McVean, 2006), assuming all sites were unlinked. We previously showed this
assumption, which confers substantial computational efficiency savings, does not adversely affect
estimates of selection coefficients (Wilson et al., 2011). We estimated variation in dN/dS within
genes using Monte Carlo Markov chain, running each chain for 10,000 iterations. We assumed expo-
nential prior distributions on the population scaled mutation rate (�), the transition:transversion ratio
(k) and the dN/dS ratio (!) with means 0.05, 3 and 0.2, respectively. We assumed equal codon fre-
quencies and a mean of 30 contiguous codons sharing the same dN/dS ratio. For each gene, we
computed the posterior mean dN/dS ratio across sites. This allowed us to rank the relative strength
of selection across genes in MRSA252, and to account for differences in dN/dS, as well as gene
length, in the GSEA. We achieved this by modifying the expected number of variants in gene j to be
l0!jLj under the null hypothesis of no enrichment versus l1!jLj, l2!jLj or l3!jLj under the alternative
hypothesis depending on the ontology or pathway, where !j is the posterior mean dN/dS in gene j.

. Supplementary file 3. Neutrality indices show signals of adaptation among the genes, gene ontolo-
gies and expression pathways most significantly enriched for protein-altering B-class variants. Neu-
trality indices (NIs, 41,42) were calculated as the odds ratio of the number of protein-altering to
synonymous variants among B-class versus C/D-class variants. These tests are less powerful than the
Poisson regression likelihood ratio tests used to detect gene or gene set enrichment of protein-alter-
ing B-class variants (Table 3); we present them to demonstrate that the direction of enrichment was
consistent with adaptation (NI > 1). To mitigate the reduced power, we calculated the expected
numbers of protein-altering B-class variants from the numbers of protein-altering C/D-class variants,
synonymous B-class variants and synonymous C/D-class variants by pooling them across all genes.
This was justified by the absence of evidence for within-patient recombination and lack of enrich-
ment signals among synonymous variants and C/D class protein-altering variants. A one-tailed Pois-
son test in R (R Core Team, 2015) was used to test NI > 1 (significant NIs at p<0.05 in bold).
