Atherosclerosis is a chronic multifactorial inflammatory disease with high prevalence worldwide, and 
has become the leading cause of death. The present study was designed to investigate the impact of 
high-fat diet on ApoE(−/−) mice exhibiting atherosclerosis by detecting the genome-wide expression 
profile of lncRNAs and mRNAs. A total of 354 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified (≥2.0 
folds). Simultaneously, 357 differentially expressed mRNAs from the same chip were found. The 
expression differences of lncRNAs and mRNAs were consistent in both qPCR and microarray detection. 
Annotation results of the mRNAs which correlated with lncRNAs showed that the commonly related 
pathways were metabolism and inflammation. Hypergeometric distribution analysis indicated that 
the differentially expressed lncRNAs had been mostly regulated by transcription factors (TFs) such as 
Myod1, Rxra, Pparg, Tcf3, etc. Additional lncRNA-target-TFs network analysis was conducted for the 
top 20 differentially expressed lncRNAs. The results indicated Hnf4a, Ppara, Vdr, and Runx3 as the 
TFs most likely to regulate the production of these lncRNAs, and might play roles in inflammatory 
and metabolic processes in atherosclerosis. In a nutshell, the present study identified a panel of 
dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs that may be potential biomarkers or drug targets relevant to the 
high-fat diet related atherogenesis.
Atherosclerosis is a chronic multifactorial inflammatory disease with high prevalence worldwide and has 
become the leading cause of death1. The principal clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis are represented by 
coronary artery disease (CAD), acute myocardial infarction, cerebral stroke and peripheral vascular disease. 
Atherosclerosis represents a heterogeneous group of pathological phenomena that include endothelium damage, 
inflammation, metabolic disorder, cell proliferation, foam cell formation, and soft inflamed atherosclerotic plaque 
rupture2,3.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs; > 
200 bp) participate in many biological and pathological processes such 
as carcinogenesis and cardiovascular diseases by acting as signals, decoys, guides, and scaffolds4–7. Recently, the 
roles of lncRNAs in atherosclerosis have gained a lot of attention. It was reported that lncRNA-H19 and antisense 
noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL) are related to the risk of atherosclerosis and CAD8,9,10. Long inter-
genic noncoding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) is also reported to be associated with atherosclerosis through vascular 
smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis11. However, the knowledge about the genome scale of lncRNAs 
and their potential biological functions in atherosclerosis are still far from clear.
In the present study, we investigated the lncRNA and mRNA expression differences in the aorta of the ApoE(− 
/− 
) 
 
mice fed with normal or high-fat diet using microarray analysis. The microarray results were further verified by 
qPCR. LncRNAs and mRNAs correlation network, gene ontology (GO; website: http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/

kegg) pathway analysis were performed to explore the potential functions of these differentially expressed lncR-
NAs. We further predicted the potential transcription factors (TFs) which may regulate the production of these 
lncRNAs. In order to identify the roles of individual lncRNA, we additionally analyzed the lncRNA-target-TFs 
network for top 20 most differentially expressed lncRNAs.
Results
The body weight and serum lipid levels of two group mice. 
After 8 weeks of treatment, the body 
weight changes between the two diet groups were closely similar (Fig. 1a). However, LDL-C, CHOL and HDL-CH 
levels in high-fat diet group mice were dramatically higher than that in normal-diet group mice (P < 
 0.01, Fig. 1b).
Differentially expressed lncRNAs in ApoE(−/−) mice. 
Feature Extraction software (version10.7.1.1, 
Agilent Technologies) was used to analyze array images to get raw data. Genespring (version 13.1, Agilent 
Technologies) was employed to finish the basic analysis with the raw data. To begin with, the raw data was nor-
malized with the quantile algorithm. The probes that have at least 1 out of 2 conditions and have flags in “P” were 
chosen for further data analysis. Differentially expressed mRNAs or lncRNAs were then identified through fold 
change (FC) as well as p-value calculated with t-test. The threshold set for up- or down-regulated RNAs was a 
FC ≥ 
 2.0 and a p-value ≤ 
 0.05. We scanned 51,302 lncRNA probes in normal diet and high-fat diet fed ApoE(− 
/− 
) 
 
mice, and identified 354 differentially expressed lncRNAs. Among them, 168 were up-regulated and 186 were 
down-regulated (Supplementary Table-S1). Next, hierarchical clustering was performed to display the distin-
guishable gene expression patterns among normal diet and high-fat diet apoE(− 
/− 
) mice (Fig. 2a).
To verify the results of lncRNA microarray, we detected the expression of 8 lncRNAs (4 up-regulated and 
4 down-regulated) using qPCR. These lncRNAs were selected randomly from differentially expressed lncRNA 
transcripts. Figure 2b,c showed that the results were consistent with the lncRNA array analysis.
Differentially expressed mRNAs in ApoE(−/−) mice. 
We also scanned the differentially expressed 
mRNAs between normal diet and high-fat diet fed ApoE(− 
/− 
) mice using the criteria of FC ≥ 
 2.0 and p ≤ 
 0.05. 
Among the 39430 mRNAs, 357 were found to be differentially expressed including 211 up-regulated and 146 
down-regulated mRNAs (Supplementary Table-S2). Hierarchical clustering was performed and the results from 
mRNAs microarray were verified using qPCR by selecting 4 mRNAs randomly from the differentially expressed 
mRNA transcripts. Consistent results were found in the qPCR and mRNA microarray analysis (Fig. 3a,b).
Co-expression network and potential functions identification. 
For each differentially expressed 
lncRNA, we investigated the correlation between each dysregulated mRNAs. We ranked the p-value of each 
lncRNA-mRNA correlation and selected the top 500 for functional enrichment analysis (Supplementary 
Table-S3). The enriched functional terms were used as the predicted functional terms of given lncRNAs. As 
shown in Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table-S5, KEGG pathway analysis indicated that, the lncRNAs were most 
likely related to metabolism (including tryptophan metabolism, metabolic pathway, and ether lipid metabolism) 
and inflammation (including NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, Cell adhesion mol-
ecules (CAMs), and PPAR signaling pathway). Since atherosclerosis is considered to be a metabolic disorder and 
inflammatory disease, these two procedures might be regulated by the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs. And for 
further GO enrichment, we found that the differentially expressed lncRNAs were mostly enriched in PDZ domain 
binding, receptor activity, and receptor binding in its Molecular Function (Fig. 4b); transport and body fluid lev-
els regulation in its Biological Process (Fig. 4c); and membrane in its Cellular Component (Fig. 4d).
LncRNA-TFs network analysis. 
Since TFs were indicated to regulate the production of lncRNAs, we there-
fore predicted the TFs that could regulate the production of differentially expressed lncRNAs using hypergeomet-
ric distribution testing method. We selected 400 most differentially regulated lncRNAs (200 up-regulated and 200

down-regulated) for the prediction. Eventually, 395 out of the 400 lncRNAs have been predicted to be regulated 
by 283 TFs. We then selected the top 200 most related lncRNA-TF pairs according to the p-value, and found these 
lncRNAs were mostly regulated by Myod1, Rxra, Pparg, Tcf3, Nr2f1, Nr5a1, Aire, Esr1, Srf, Runx3, and Arhgef7 
(Fig. 5, Supplementary Table-S6). Among these TFs, Myod1, Rxra, Pparg, Esr1, Srf, and Runx3 were previously 
demonstrated to be related with atherosclerosis12–17.

LncRNA-target-TFs network analysis of 20 most differentially expressed lncRNAs. 
In order to 
further identify the functions of each individual lncRNA which may play critical roles in atherogenesis, we ana-
lyzed 20 most differentially expressed lncRNAs (10 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated) between normal diet 
and high-fat diet fed ApoE(− 
/− 
) mice. A total of 157 TFs were predicted to regulate the transcription of these 
lncRNAs. And also a total of 268 correlated mRNAs were predicted to be the targets of these lncRNAs. We selected 
100 most related TFs and 200 most correlated mRNAs according to the p-value to conduct the lncRNA-target-TFs 
network analysis. The network included 170 nodes and 299 edges (Fig. 6). Among these TFs; Hnf4a, Ppara, 
Vdr, and Runx3 were predicted to regulate several lncRNAs. For example, Hnf4a was predicted to regulate 
the FR384764, n297308, FR082156 and n297428; Ppara was predicted to regulate the FR251112, FR082156, 
FR334236 and n418309; Vdr was predicted to regulate the n418309, n418283, chr13_98281158_98285757_F 
and chrX_102568332_102587093_R; Runx3 was predicted to regulate the n297308, FR384764, n297428 and 
FR334236. Moreover, all these four TFs were previously demonstrated to be related with atherosclerosis17–20. We 
also conducted the GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis for these lncRNA-targeted mRANs. The results 
indicated that they were most likely related to Molecular Functions like ion binding, transcription regulation, 
and KEGG pathways like tryptophan metabolism, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, ABC transporters, 
glutathione metabolism, intestinal immune network for IgA production, hedgehog signaling pathway, long-term 
depression, arachidonic acid metabolism, vascular smooth muscle contraction, cell adhesion molecules, etc.

Discussion
In the present study, we investigated the genome-wide expression profile of lncRNAs and mRNAs in normal diet 
and high-fat diet fed ApoE(− 
/− 
) mice using microarray. A total of 354 lncRNAs, including 168 up-regulated 
and 186 down-regulated were identified to be differentially expressed between the two groups of mice. 
Simultaneously, we also identified 357 differentially expressed protein coding mRNAs from the same chip, includ-
ing 211 up-regulated and 146 down-regulated mRNAs. The expression differences of lncRNAs and mRNAs were 
consistent in qPCR detection with microarray detection.
In order to explore the functions of these differentially expressed lncRNAs, we conducted the co-expression 
analysis with the aberrantly expressed mRNAs. These mRNAs were then used to predict the potential function 
of the differentially expressed lncRNAs. The results indicated that these lncRNAs were mostly related to metab-
olisms and inflammation. Many studies have indicated that atherosclerosis is a metabolic disease. Our study 
found that tryptophan metabolism was the most affected pathway in KEGG analysis. Tryptophan is the least 
abundant amino acid of all essential amino acids, which are necessary for protein synthesis. The major catabolic

route of Tryptophan in mammalians is the kynurenine pathway21. In kynurenine pathway, the indoleamine 
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is firstly induced by inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-γ 
 (IFN-γ 
) and tumor 
necrosis factor-α 
 (TNF-α 
), and then leads to the catabolic of kynurenine, causing an increase of Kynurenine/
Tryptophan ratio, which is associated with the greater carotid plaque in atherosclerosis patients and in coronary 
heart disease patients22,23. Besides metabolism, these differentially expressed lncRNAs also participated in inflam-
matory signal pathways, such as NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, CAMs, and PPAR 
signaling pathway. These inflammatory pathways were widely researched and demonstrated to be associated with 
atherogenesis24–26. Therefore, it’s reasonable to propose that the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs participated in the 
diet-induced atherogenesis, through affecting its correlated metabolic or inflammatory mRNAs.
In the Molecular Function of GO enrichment assay, we found “PDZ domain binding” was the most enriched 
term for these lncRNA-correlated mRNAs. PDZ binding proteins which binds to the carboxy-termini of a num-
ber of membrane transporter proteins, including ion channels and cell surface receptors, were found to play key 
roles in lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis27,28. Thus, “PDZ domain binding”
, in addition to “receptor 
activity” and “receptor binding” in its Molecular Function, and “membrane” in its Cellular Component, might 
explain the way these lncRNAs play their roles in diet-induced atherogenesis.
Furthermore, we predicted the TFs which might regulate the production of lncRNAs via hypergeometric 
distribution analysis. We found that Myod1, Rxra, Pparg, Tcf3, Nr2f1, Nr5a1, Aire, Esr1, Srf, Runx3, and Arhgef7 
were among the mostly correlated TFs. Previous studies have demonstrated that Rxra, Pparg, Nrf1, and Srf were 
associated with atherosclerosis through lipid metabolism or transportation14,29,30; vascular smooth muscle cell 
proliferation31; inflammation32,33; Esr1 and Runx3 were related to the risk of atherosclerosis15,17. Interestingly, we 
found that Myod1 was the most correlated TF with lncRNAs in the present study. Previous studies, however, are 
mostly focused on its effects on muscle differentiation and regeneration34. How it acts in atherogenesis still need 
further investigation.

To further study the roles of specific lncRNAs in atherogenesis, we analyzed the relationship between 20 most 
differentially expressed lncRNAs with TFs and their target mRNAs. LncRNA-target-TFs network analysis found 
several most likely TFs which were for the transcription of these lncRNAs. These include Hnf4a, Ppara, Vdr, and 
Runx3. Interestingly, we found FR384764, n297308, and n297428 were predicted to be regulated by both Hnf4a 
and Runx3. Further pathway analysis indicated that these 3 lncRNAs were mostly related to inflammatory pro-
cess, lipid or amino acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. Since both Hnf4a and Runx3 demonstrated 
to have functions on lipid metabolism or inflammation17,19, we presumed that these two TFs work together with 
FR384764, n297308 and n297428 to regulate the expression of certain mRNAs, and eventually affect the proce-
dures of metabolism or inflammatory process to control the atherogenesis.
In our present study, we compared the lncRNAs and mRNAs expression profile between normal diet and 
high-fat diet fed ApoE(− 
/− 
). Previous studies have demonstrated that important roles of diet in the formation of 
atherosclerosis in ApoE(− 
/− 
) mice. High-fat and high-cholesterol diet induced atherosclerosis faster and more 
severe than normal diet in ApoE(− 
/− 
) mice35,36. The diet also affected the intimal hyperplasia significantly37. 
Our present study found a significant difference in the lipid levels between these two groups. Some differentially 
expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were found between them as well, which we presume to represent the effects of 
diet on RNA profile during the progress of atherosclerosis. However, ApoE(− 
/− 
) mice spontaneously exhibit ath-
erosclerosis. Even those ApoE(− 
/− 
) mice fed with normal diet showed spontaneous elevations in plasma choles-
terol compared with wild-type C57BL6J mice because of impaired clearance of cholesterol-rich remnant particles. 
Therefore, the RNA profile between wild-type C57BL6J mice and ApoE(− 
/− 
) mice still needs further analysis.
H19 is an imprinted gene, first discovered as a tumor suppressor. In 1996, Han et al. found that H19 was 
expressed in the adult human atherosclerotic lesion10. Further studies have found that hyperhomocysteinemia 
and Hcy treatment causes hypomethylation, which subsequently increases the expression of H19 in adult mice 
or VSMCs38,39. Another study found a common polymorphism of H19 which was associated with increasing 
the risk and severity of CAD in a Chinese population8. All these research indicated that H19 is related to ather-
osclerosis. In our present study, we also found a high expression of H19 in both normal diet group and high-fat 
diet group. Since ApoE(− 
/− 
) mice spontaneously exhibit atherosclerosis despite the diet, the results indicated 
that the high levels of H19 expression found in these mice might contributed to the spontaneous development of

atherosclerosis. However, no significant difference between the normal diet and high-fat diet group of ApoE(− 
/− 
) 
 
mice was found in our study, which might mean that the diet is not the cause of H19 expression changes.
Taking all these together, we have identified a panel of dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs that may be poten-
tial biomarkers or drug targets relevant to the high-fat diet related atherogenesis.
Materials and Methods
Animals and diets. 
The homozygous male ApoE(− 
/− 
) mice, 22–24 g, were obtained from Shanghai Slac 
Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd (Shanghai, People’s Republic of China). The care and use of these animals were fol-
lowing the institutional and national guidelines. All experimental procedures involving animals were approved by 
the Ethics Committee of the Central South University, China. The mice were housed in a temperature-controlled 
room (22 ± 
 0.8 °C) and a relative humidity of 55 ± 
 10%, with 12 h light-dark cycles and free access to water and 
chow. The ApoE(− 
/− 
)(− 
/− 
) mice were randomly divided into two groups with 8 animals in either. The normal 
diet group was fed with normal chow, while the treated group was fed with high-fat and high-cholesterol diet 
containing 20% fat and 2.5% cholesterol. The treatment duration is 8 weeks. The body weight of each group of 
mice was monitored weekly. At the end of the treatment, the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection 
of 10% chloral hydrate (0.4 mL/100 g body weight), and the blood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus. The 
serum lipid levels of each mouse were detected using automatic biochemical analyzer (Selectra E). After perfusion 
with ice-cold normal saline, the aorta of each mouse was taken and stored in liquid nitrogen until further analysis. 
We selected 3 aorta samples from each group randomly for the detection of lncRNAs and mRNAs array. Other 
samples were prepared for further verification of microarray results using qPCR.
Array data production. 
The experiments were performed in the lab of OeBiotech Corporation (Shanghai, 
China). Agilent mouse lncRNA Microarray (4*180K, Design ID: 049801), which contains 51302 lncRNAs and 
39430 mRNAs, was used in this experiment. To sum up, the total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent and 
then quantified using the NanoDrop ND-2000 (Thermo Scientific). The RNA integrity was assessed using Agilent 
Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). The sample labeling, microarray hybridization, and washing were per-
formed based on the manufacturer’s standard protocols. Then, the total RNA was transcribed to double strand 
cDNA, synthesized into cRNA and labeled with Cyanine-3-CTP. The labeled cRNA was hybridized onto the 
microarray. And finally, the arrays were scanned by the Agilent Scanner G2505C(Agilent Technologies) after 
washing.
Differential expression analysis. 
Data analysis was performed using the GeneSpring GX v13.1 software 
package (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). The Quantile method was used to normalize the raw data. 
After normalization, the data with a 100% “P” flags in at least one group (normal diet group or high-fat diet 
group) were selected for further analysis. Differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were assessed using the 
t-test. The FC ≥ 2.0 between the compared two groups, as well as the p-value < 0.05, was defined as differentially 
expressed lncRNAs or mRNAs. Hierarchical Clustering was performed using the Agilent GeneSpring GX soft-
ware (version 11.5.1).
Quantitative RT-PCR. 
QRT-PCR was used to validate some of the differentially expressed lncRNAs and 
mRNAs. The primers were listed in Table 1. The qPCR was performed using the SYBR Green Premix DimerEraser 
kit (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Dalian, China) on the Roche LightCycler 480 Instrument II. The relative gene expression 
was analyzed using the 2(−ΔΔCt) Method as previously described40. The significance of differences was analyzed 
using one-way analysis of variance or Student’s t-test (unpaired). Multiple comparisons between groups were 
performed using Tukey’s method. SPSS software, version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to perform 
the statistical analysis. p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Co-expression network analysis. 
The co-expression of lncRNA and mRNA was calculated by the Pearson 
correlation coefficients (PCC). The correlated p < 
 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. We also detected

the correlations between lncRNAs and TFs via hypergeometric distribution analysis in MATLAB environ-
ment. Firstly, the mRNAs which are co-expressed with the aberrant lncRNAs were identified. The overlap of the 
co-expressed mRNAs set with TFs target genes set was calculated. Then hypergeometirc distribution analysis was 
used in calculating the significance of this overlap. If the co-expressed mRNAs of the given lncRNAs significantly 
overlapped with the target genes of the given TFs, the TFs would then be considered as interacting with these 
lncRNAs. The most recent data released by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) on TFs and their 
targets were used in the present analysis41,42. The graph of the lncRNAs-TFs network was drawn with the help of 
Cytoscape 3.11 (Agilent and IBS).
Functional classification and pathway analysis. 
The function of lncRNA co-expressed mRNA was 
analyzed using the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. The GO analysis was divided into Molecular Function, 
Biological Process and Cellular Component. The pathway of lncRNA co-expressed mRNA was analyzed using the 
KEGG pathway analysis. These analyses allowed us to predict the functional classification and biological pathway 
in which the co-expressed mRNAs of the differentially expressed lncRNAs are enriched. A p < 
 0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant for the correlation.
