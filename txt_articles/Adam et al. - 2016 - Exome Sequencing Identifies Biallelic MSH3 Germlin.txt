In ~30% of families affected by colorectal adenomatous polyposis, no germline mutations have been identified in the previously impli-
cated genes APC, MUTYH, POLE, POLD1, and NTHL1, although a hereditary etiology is likely. To uncover further genes with high-pene-
trance causative mutations, we performed exome sequencing of leukocyte DNA from 102 unrelated individuals with unexplained
adenomatous polyposis. We identified two unrelated individuals with differing compound-heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) germline
mutations in the mismatch-repair gene MSH3. The impact of the MSH3 mutations (c.1148delA, c.2319�1G>A, c.2760delC, and
c.3001�2A>C) was indicated at the RNA and protein levels. Analysis of the diseased individuals’ tumor tissue demonstrated high mi-
crosatellite instability of di- and tetranucleotides (EMAST), and immunohistochemical staining illustrated a complete loss of nuclear
MSH3 in normal and tumor tissue, confirming the LoF effect and causal relevance of the mutations. The pedigrees, genotypes, and fre-
quency of MSH3 mutations in the general population are consistent with an autosomal-recessive mode of inheritance. Both index per-
sons have an affected sibling carrying the same mutations. The tumor spectrum in these four persons comprised colorectal and duodenal
adenomas, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and an early-onset astrocytoma. Additionally, we detected one unrelated individual with
biallelic PMS2 germline mutations, representing constitutional mismatch-repair deficiency. Potentially causative variants in 14 more
candidate genes identified in 26 other individuals require further workup. In the present study, we identified biallelic germline MSH3
mutations in individuals with a suspected hereditary tumor syndrome. Our data suggest that MSH3 mutations represent an additional
recessive subtype of colorectal adenomatous polyposis.
Introduction
Adenomatous polyposis syndromes of the colorectum are
precancerous conditions characterized by the presence of
dozens to thousands of adenomatous polyps, which, un-
less detected early and removed, invariably result in colo-
rectal cancer (CRC). The phenotypic spectrum ranges
from an early-onset manifestation with high numbers of
adenomas and a positive family history to isolated late-
onset cases with a low polyp burden.
To date, two major inherited monogenic forms of colo-
rectal adenomatous polyposis can be delineated by molec-
ular genetic analyses: (1) autosomal-dominant familial
adenomatous polyposis (FAP [MIM: 175100]), caused by
heterozygous germline mutations in the tumor-suppressor
gene APC (APC, WNT signaling pathway regulator [MIM:
611731]);1,2 and (2) autosomal-recessive MUTYH-associ-
ated polyposis (MAP [MIM: 608456]), caused by biallelic
germline mutations in the base-excision-repair (BER)
gene MUTYH (mutY DNA glycosylase [MIM: 604933]).3,4
Currently, high-throughput sequencing approaches, in
particular whole-exome sequencing (WES), are considered
the most powerful tools for detecting causative variants in
genes in as yet unexplained Mendelian conditions.5,6 Very
recent WES investigations have identified two rare forms of
colorectal adenomatous polyposis: (1) autosomal-domi-
nant polymerase-proofreading-associated polyposis (PPAP
[MIM: 612591]), caused by specific germline missense mu-
tations in the polymerase genes POLE (DNA polymerase
epsilon, catalytic subunit [MIM: 174762]) and POLD1
(DNA
polymerase
delta
1,
catalytic
subunit
[MIM:
174761]);7–9 and (2) another very rare autosomal-recessive
colorectal adenomatous polyposis (MIM: 616415), caused
by biallelic mutations in NTHL1 (nth-like DNA glycosylase

 1 [MIM: 602656]).10 The WES approach has also detected
ZSWIM7 (zinc finger SWIM-type containing 7 [MIM:
614535]) and PIEZO1 (piezo type mechanosensitive ion
channel component 1 [MIM: 611184]) as promising candi-
date genes carrying variants causing colorectal adenoma-
tous polyposis.11
However, in around 30% of polyposis cases, no underly-
ing germline mutation has been identified, although a ge-
netic basis is likely. Here, classic approaches to gene identi-
fication, such as linkage analysis, are not feasible, given
that most of these cases are either sporadic or characterized
by an uncertain family.12–15 Over the past two decades, a
number of candidate-gene studies have been performed
without convincing results.16–19 Neither loss-of-heterozy-
gosity (LOH) analyses nor profiling of somatic mutations
has contributed to the identification of promising novel
genetic causes. A fraction of cases might be explained by
deep intronic APC mutations,20 APC mutational mosai-
cism,21 rare APC missense mutations,22 or other genes pre-
disposing to cancer.23–26 In addition, rare germline copy-
number variants (CNVs) and low-penetrant variants might
contribute to the genetic predisposition for the formation
of colorectal adenomas.15,27,28
Another hereditary CRC syndrome, Lynch syndrome, is
not accompanied by a florid colorectal polyposis and is
characterized by microsatellite instable tumors. The under-
lying cause is a heterozygous germline mutation in one of
the mismatch-repair (MMR) genes MLH1 (mutL homolog 1
[MIM: 120436]), MSH2 (mutS homolog 2 [MIM: 609309]),
MSH6 (mutS homolog 6 [MIM: 600678]), PMS2 (PMS1 ho-
molog 2, mismatch repair system component [MIM:
600259]), or EPCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule
[MIM: 185535]).29,30 Biallelic mutations in these genes
lead to constitutional MMR deficiency (CMMRD [MIM:
276300]) with multiple tumors and childhood onset.31,32
In contrast, familial CRC without polyposis or microsatel-
lite instability is etiologically very heterogeneous. In some
of these families, germline mutations in FAN1 (FANCD2/
FANCI-associated nuclease 1 [MIM: 613534]), encoding a
nuclease involved in DNA repair, were recently identified
by a WES approach.33
To uncover additional genes with high-penetrance mu-
tations causing colorectal polyposis, we sequenced the
germline exomes of 102 unrelated individuals with unex-
plained adenomatous polyposis. The identification of
further genetic causes will extend the knowledge of disease
mechanisms, biological pathways, and potential therapeu-
tic targets.
Material and Methods
Cohort and Data Collection
All 102 individuals were determined to have unexplained colo-
rectal adenomatous polyposis, i.e., no germline mutation in APC
or MUTYH was identified by Sanger sequencing of the coding re-
gions or deletion and duplication analysis by multiplex ligation-
dependent probe amplification (MLPA).34 All participants were
screened for APC mutations in the mosaic state.21 All persons
were examined for pathogenic deep intronic APC mutations: 67
persons were screened via transcript analysis, and 35 were tested
for known intronic mutations.20 Furthermore, the two hotspot
mutations in POLE and POLD1 were excluded.9 In addition, a
SNP-array-based CNV analysis was performed in all individuals,
as described elsewhere.28
For all 102 persons included in this study, a hereditary cause of
the disease was considered highly likely. The inclusion criteria
were the presence of at least 20 synchronous, or 40 metachronous,
histologically confirmed colorectal adenomas, irrespective of in-
heritance pattern or extraintestinal lesions. All participants were
of central European origin according to family name and self-
report. Relatives were only considered to be affected if their medical
records confirmed fulfilment of the inclusion criteria. The study
was approved by the local ethics review board (Medical Faculty of
the University of Bonn, board no. 224/07), and all participants pro-
vided written informed consent prior to inclusion.
High-Throughput Sequencing and Bioinformatics
Workflow
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral EDTA-anticoagu-
lated blood samples by the standard salting-out procedure. WES
was performed at the Yale Center for Genome Analysis via capture
by the NimbleGen 2.1M Human Exome Array, and then paired-
end sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 2000 instrument (Illu-
mina) as described elsewhere.35 Targeted bases were covered by a
mean of 67 independent reads, and an average of 94% of all bases
were covered eight or more times (Table S1). Reads were aligned to
the hg19 human reference genome (UCSC Genome Browser) with
ELAND (Illumina). SAMtools software was used for marking dupli-
cated reads, performing local realignment around short indels,
recalibrating base quality scores, and calling single-nucleotide var-
iants (SNVs) and short indels.
Variant call quality was assessed with SAMtools. A minimum
quality score of 100 and a minimum coverage of 103 were
required. Synonymous or intronic variants other than those
affecting consensus splice sites were excluded from further
analysis.
The resulting variants were filtered for (1) rare truncating (loss-
of-function [LoF]) alterations (nonsense mutations, frameshift in-
dels, and mutations at highly conserved splice sites) and (2)
missense variants located in highly conserved nucleotide posi-
tions and predicted to be disease causing, damaging, or deleterious
by at least two of three in silico analysis tools (PolyPhen-2, Muta-
tionTaster, and SIFT).
The variants were selected according to a recessive (presumed
biallelic
mutations)
or
dominant
(heterozygous
mutations)
mode of inheritance and an estimated disease frequency of
0.01% in the population. In the dominant and recessive disease
models, variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of R0.01%
and R1%, respectively, were considered benign polymorphisms
or low-penetrance variants and excluded from further analysis.
In addition, recurrent dominant (heterozygous) variants were
selected with a less stringent frequency threshold (MAF ¼ 1%).
Population allele frequencies are based on data from dbSNP, the
1000 Genomes Project (TGP), the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) Exome Variant
Server (EVS), the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) Browser,
and a large in-house exome database containing all germline var-
iants identified in 2,816 exomes of individuals without known

 tumor disease and sequenced under similar conditions. To exclude
obvious sequencing artifacts, we performed a detailed visual in-
spection of the remaining variants with a read browser (Integrative
Genomics Viewer [IGV]).
We considered only genes affected by potentially pathogenic
variants in at least two alleles of the cohort (heterozygous in at
least two individuals or homozygous or compound heterozygous
in at least one individual). Finally, we inspected all genes carrying
the remaining rare variants for the presence of rare, non-polymor-
phic heterozygous CNVs of R10 kb in order to identify additional
recurrently mutated genes or biallelic, compound-heterozygous
variants.28
Splicing efficiencies of the normal and mutant sequences were
calculated with the following splice prediction programs: Human
Splicing Finder,36 GeneSplicer (University of Maryland Center for
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology), MaxEntScan,37 and
NNSPLICE 0.9 (Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project).
The etiological relevance of the mutations was further explored
by evaluation of their genetic intolerance to functional variation,
as measured by the Residual Variation Intolerance Score (RVIS),38
and the likelihood of haploinsufficiency, as measured by haploin-
sufficiency scores (from dataset S2, including imputed values).39
The expression of candidate genes was determined with the ex-
pressed-sequence-tag profiles of human colon tissue and protein
detection data from human colon tissue (glandular cells) provided
by UniGene and the Human Protein Atlas.
Frequency of Colorectal Tumors with Somatic
Mutations in Candidate Genes
Data concerning the frequency (percentage) of colorectal tumors
with somatic mutations in candidate genes were obtained from
the exome database of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Somatic
variants identified in exome data from colonic (n ¼ 273) and rectal
(n ¼ 116) adenocarcinomas were downloaded from the TCGA data
portal. To correct the data for the presence of passenger mutations,
we excluded hypermutated tumors from the dataset. Therefore,
the distribution of somatic variants in the TCGA exomes was
analyzed, and all tumors with >200 variants (24% of the tumors)
were excluded. We used the remaining 295 exomes (76% of tu-
mors) to calculate the frequency of tumors with somatic muta-
tions in candidate genes.28
Sanger Sequencing and Validation
The identified truncating variants were validated via Sanger
sequencing of the corresponding region according to standard
protocols. We used genomic leukocyte-derived DNA to amplify
the genomic region of the respective variant. PCR products were
purified and sequenced on an ABI 3500xl Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems). To avoid pseudogene amplification, as
described previously,40 we based Sanger sequencing of PMS2 on
long-range PCR with primers specific to PMS2.
Transcript Analysis
Venous blood samples were collected into PAXgene blood RNA
tubes (Becton Dickinson). Total RNA was extracted with the
PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (QIAGEN) in accordance with the man-
ufacturer’s protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from
2–3 mg of total RNA by random hexamer-primed reverse tran-
scription and the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for
RT-PCR (Invitrogen GmbH) in accordance with the manufac-
turer’s protocol. RT-PCR fragments were obtained according to
standard PCR protocols, and different primers were used for
generating the appropriate fragments. RT-PCR products were
separated on 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bro-
mide with an UV imaging system (Bio-Rad). Individual bands
were excised from the gel and eluted with the High Pure PCR
Product Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Eluted
DNA was re-amplified with the same primer pairs and sequenced
as described above.
Analysis of Altered MSH3 Products
MSH3 (mutS homolog 3 [MIM: 600887]) frameshift mutations,
c.1148delA and c.2760delC, were generated via site-directed muta-
genesis (QuikChange II Kit, Stratagene; primers: 50-GTTAGGGA
CAAAAAAAGGGCAACATT-30 and 50-AATGTTGCCCTTTTTTTGT
CCCTAAC-30 [c.1148delA] and 50-GGCTCAGATTGGCTCTATGTT
CCTGCAGAAG-30 and 50-CTTCTGCAGGAACATAGAGCCAATCT
GAGCC-30 [c.2760delC]) with the wild-type pcDNA3.1�/MSH3-
WT vector (kindly provided by Grazia Graziani, Italy).41 Plasmids
were confirmed by sequencing. To mimic the splice-site variants
MSH3
c.3001�2A>C
and
c.2319�1G>A,
resulting
cDNAs
including the premature stop codons were synthesized (Gene
Art) and subcloned into a pcDNA3.1þ expression vector.
Transient transfection was carried out with HEK293T cells as
described previously.42 In brief, HEK293T cells were transfected
at 50%–70% confluence with expression plasmid pcDNA3.1�
/MSH3-WT,
pcDNA3.1�/MSH3-c.1148delA,
pcDNA3.1�/MSH3-
c.2760delC,
pcDNA3.1þ/MSH3-c.3001�2A>C,
or
pcDNA3.1þ
/MSH3-c.2319�1G>A (0.5 mg/ml, respectively) with the use of
2 ml/ml of the cationic polymer polyethylenimine (Polysciences;
stock solution 1 mg/ml). 48 hr after transfection, cell extracts
were prepared for western blot analysis with anti-MSH3 (H-300,
Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and anti-b-actin (Sigma). Fluores-
cence signals (680 and 800, Li-Cor) were detected in a FLA-9000
(Fujifilm).
The effect of whole exon deletions on protein structure was
illustrated in silico. MSH3 structure was obtained from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB: 3THY; MutSb complexed with an indel loop of
two bases and ADP).43 We mapped the amino acids coded by
exons 17 and 22 to the MSH3 structure by using the PyMOL
Molecular Graphics System (version 1.7.0.0, Schro
¨dinger).
Immunohistochemistry of MMR Proteins
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue samples was performed according to es-
tablished routine procedures on a fully automated Bond-III IHC
stainer (Leica) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with
the following primary antibodies: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and
PMS2 (all purchased from Leica). The amount of protein staining
in tumor cells was compared to that in normal tissue. The
amount of MMR protein was considered deficient if the nuclei
showed no or only very weak immunostaining in relation to
normal tissue.
IHC of MSH3 was performed on 2–3 mm FFPE tissue specimens
with an automated staining system (480 S Autostainer, Medac).
For antigen retrieval, a pre-treatment module (Medac) was
used. A rabbit polyclonal antibody for MSH3, raised against an
NH2-terminal polypeptide comprising amino acids 1–200, was
used at a dilution of 1:100.44,45 The reaction was developed
with a horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated detection system
(C-DPVB 500 HRP, Medac) and the 3,30-diaminobenzidine system
(495192F, Medac).

 Targeted Sequencing of Tumor Tissue
DNA was extracted from 10 mm FFPE tissue sections. After deparaf-
finization, tumor tissue was macrodissected from unstained slides.
A previously marked H&E-stained slide served as a reference.
Extraction of FFPE tissue DNA was carried out with the BioRobot
M48 robotic workstation and the corresponding MagAttract
DNA Mini M48 Kit (QIAGEN) or the Maxwell 16 FFPE Tissue
LEV DNA Purification Kit (Promega) in accordance with the man-
ufacturer’s protocol. Analysis of microsatellite status was per-
formed according to the previously described methods.46 For ex-
amination of somatic APC mutations, high-coverage targeted
sequencing (read depths > 1,000) was performed with the
FAP MASTR Kit (Multiplicom) on a MiSeq platform (Illumina) in
one person (individual 1661.1). The results were analyzed with
SeqPilot software (JSI Medical Systems).
Microsatellite Analysis
Microsatellite
analysis
was
performed
on
matched
tumor
and normal DNA samples by conventional fragment analysis
or
next-generation-sequencing-based
analysis
as
previously
described.46 This involved using the National Cancer Institute
panel of reference markers to evaluate microsatellite instability
(MSI) in CRC. This panel consists of two mononucleotide
(BAT25 and BAT26) and three dinucleotide (D2S123, D5S346,
and D17S250) repeats.47–49 Tumor DNA was extracted from micro-
dissected tumor tissue. Normal DNA was extracted from normal
tissue or peripheral-blood leukocytes. Tumors were scored as high-
ly instable (MSI-H) if two or more of these five markers exhibited
additional alleles and as stable (MSS) if none of the five markers
showed instability.
A second panel of five markers was complemented. This con-
sisted of one tetranucleotide and four dinucleotide repeats
(BAT40, D10S197, D13S153, MYCL1, and D18S58). The tumor
was classified as MSI-H if two or more of the ten markers exhibited
instability and as MSI-low (MSI-L) if only one marker exhibited
additional alleles.
For detecting elevated microsatellite instability at selected tetra-
nucleotide repeats (EMAST), DNA from tumor and normal tissue
was analyzed with five more tetranucleotide repeat markers
(D20S82, D2S443, D21S1436, D9S747, and UTS037) as described
elsewhere.50
Results
To identify high-penetrance germline mutations causing
colorectal adenomatous polyposis and located in genes
not related to polyposis so far, we performed WES of leuko-
cyte-derived DNA in 102 unrelated individuals with unex-
plained adenomatous polyposis. Most of the individuals
presented with an attenuated colorectal phenotype (late-
onset disease and/or <100 colorectal adenomas). The
mean age at diagnosis was 44 years (range ¼ 14–73 years).
The majority of individuals in the whole cohort had no
evidence of extracolonic lesions and were sporadic or iso-
lated cases. The basic clinical features of the cohort are
summarized in Tables S2 and S3.
The median coverage of mapped reads was 563 (66%
on-target), and 84% of bases were covered at R203. The
overall performance of exome sequencing is described in
Table S1. A principal-component analysis demonstrated
that all but one of the participants were of central Euro-
pean origin (Figure S1). The outlier was excluded from
further analysis. Two further persons were removed as a
result of low coverage. A mean of 30,152 SNVs per sample
was called in the coding and flanking intronic regions.
Assuming a dominant or recessive disease model, we
applied a number of stringent filter steps to select for
rare, non-polymorphic, truncating (LoF) variants.
We identified two unrelated individuals each carrying
two different mutations in MSH3 (Figures 1 and 2, and
Figure S2). We also detected one unrelated person with
two different mutations in PMS2. Furthermore, potentially
pathogenic germline variants were identified in 14 addi-
tional protein-coding genes (Figure S3 and Table S4).
Clinical Description of Individuals Carrying Biallelic
MSH3 Mutations
Individual 1275.1 (II-4 in Figure 1A) is female and was diag-
nosed with colorectal adenomatous polyposis at age 36
years. She underwent a preventive sigmoidectomy at
age 48 years and a right hemicolectomy at age 53 years.
Histology results were available for >40 polyps, all of
which were tubular or tubulovillous adenomas with low
to intermediate dysplasia, often accompanied by inflam-
matory infiltration. Three distal hyperplastic polyps were
also documented. In addition, this person has a history
of proliferative disorders in other organs: thyroid adenoma
at age 35 years, a small polyp of the corpus uteri and uter-
ine leiomyomas at age 44 years, multiple small intraductal
papillomas of (peripheral) mammary glands at age 44
years, and multiple adenomatous polyps in the duodenum
at age 50 years. Hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithe-
lium was excluded by ophthalmological examination at
age 50 years.
Individual 1661.1 (II-2 in Figure 1B) is also female and
was diagnosed at age 32 years with colorectal tubular and
tubulovillous adenomas with low-grade intraepithelial
neoplasia. At age 42 years, she underwent proctocolec-
tomy and excision of large duodenal adenomas. This in-
dividual has a striking past medical history: at age 26
years, a grade II astrocytoma was diagnosed and surgi-
cally treated. At age 27 years, she underwent oophorec-
tomy for the presence of ovarian cysts, including one
dermoid cyst. A hysterectomy was performed for a my-
oma at age 34 years, and a thyroidectomy was performed
for follicular adenomas at age 42 years. At age 43 years,
she showed a cutaneous fibrolipoma, and at age 46 years,
a flat epithelial atypia, multiple peripheral small intra-
ductal papillomas, usual ductal hyperplasias, and cysts
with apocrine metaplasia were detected in the mammary
glands.
Both index persons have one affected sibling, whereas
their respective parents have no reported history of malig-
nant gastrointestinal disease (Figure 1). A sister (individual
1275.2; II-1 in Figure 1A) of individual 1275.1 (II-4 in
Figure 1A) was diagnosed with a rectal adenocarcinoma
340
The American Journal of Human Genetics 99, 337–351, August 4, 2016
 at age 56 years and with a signet cell gastric carcinoma at
age 59 years. The available histology reports describe mul-
tiple tubulovillous adenomas of the entire colon and prox-
imal duodenum, with up to high-grade intraepithelial
neoplasia, and two hyperplastic polyps of the transverse
colon. Small bilateral renal cysts were reported as a second-
ary finding. The brother (individual 1661.2; II-3 in
Figure 1B) of individual 1661.1 (II-2 in Figure 1B) was diag-
nosed with colorectal polyps at age 33 years; he underwent
colectomy at age 37 years.
Characterization of the MSH3 Mutations
In total, the two index persons harbor four different MSH3
variants, all with a putative LoF effect. MSH3 (GenBank:
NM_002439.4) on 5q14.1 is one of the six MMR genes
identified to date in eukaryotic cells.51 It consists of 24
exons and encodes a protein composed of 1,137 amino
acids, including several functional domains (Figure 2). In
both families, each affected individual carries one frame-
shift and one splice-site mutation (Figures 1 and 2). All mu-
tations were validated by Sanger sequencing (Figure 2).
The frameshift mutation c.1148delA (p.Lys383Argfs*32;
chr5: g.79970921delA) in exon 7 in family 1275 is predicted
to result in a premature stop codon after 31 amino acids. It
corresponds to a known somatic cancer mutation located in
a poly-A(8) tract of exon 7. The frameshift mutation
c.2760delC (p.Tyr921Metfs*36; chr5: g.80109507delC) in
exon 20 in family 1661 is predicted to result in a premature
stop codon after 35 amino acids. After transfection of MSH3
plasmids with each frameshift mutation in HEK293T cells,
we demonstrated via western blot that the altered proteins
are shortened by the expected length (Figures S4A and S4C).

and

family 1275 are both located in highly conserved splice
acceptor sites and are predicted to alter splicing in four of
four prediction tools. To demonstrate their functional ef-
fect, we performed a transcript analysis with primers
located in flanking exons (Figures 3A and 3B). RT-PCR
products obtained from cDNA of individual 1661.1, who
carries the c.2319�1G>A mutation, showed two bands

 on an agarose gel. Sequencing of the shortened transcript
confirmed a loss of exon 17, which is predicted to result
in an in-frame loss of 39 amino acids (774–812) at the pro-
tein level. These amino acids are involved in DNA recogni-
tion (Figures 2 and S5).43 Sequencing of the short RT-PCR
fragment from individual 1275.1 (II-4 in Figure 1A), who
has the c.3001�2A>C mutation, confirmed a loss of
exon 22. This is predicted to result in a frameshift muta-
tion with a premature stop codon after 16 amino acids,
altering the dimerization domain (Figures 2 and S5). In
addition, we demonstrated via western blot that MSH3
cDNA variants lacking the respective exon lead to altered
proteins shortened by the expected length (Figures S4B–
S4C).
In control individuals (ExAC Browser), the variant
c.1148delA is listed ten times (as ‘‘chr5:79970914CA/C’’),
and
the
variant
c.2760delC
is
listed
twice
(as
‘‘chr5:80109505TC/T’’) in a heterozygous state, corre-
sponding to an allele frequency of 0.008% and 0.0016%,
respectively. The two other MSH3 variants are not reported
in the general population, and none of the variants are
listed in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD).
To determine the frequency of MSH3 LoF mutations in
the normal population, we queried large exome datasets
from control individuals (TGP, EVS, and ExAC Browser).
Although these datasets listed heterozygous LoF MSH3 mu-
tations with a MAF of <0.2%, no homozygous mutation
was reported.
We were able to obtain paraffin-embedded tumor and
adjacent normal tissue from the affected sister 1275.2
(II-1 in Figure 1A) and a blood sample from the affected
brother 1661.2 (II-3 in Figure 1B) and found the same
two MSH3 mutations as those present in the index individ-
ual (data not shown).
To confirm compound heterozygosity, we gathered a
leukocyte-derived DNA sample from one unaffected sib-
ling (II-7 in Figure 1A) of individual 1275.1 (II-4 in
Figure 1A). Examination of both regions mutated in
the
index
individual
revealed
that
the
unaffected
sibling carries only the frameshift mutation in the hetero-
zygous state and not the splice-site mutation (Figures 1
and 3C). For individual 1661.1 (II-2 in Figure 1B), the bial-
lelic genotype was confirmed via transcript analysis: by
creating an amplicon spanning both mutated regions,
we could demonstrate that the transcript of normal
length carries the single-nucleotide deletion resulting in
a frameshift mutation. In contrast, this single-nucleotide
deletion was not detected in the shortened product tran-
scribed from the allele carrying the splice-site mutation
(Figure 3D).
To assess potential additional causal alterations, we per-
formed supplementary sequencing and MLPA of genes
with influence on MSH3: neither of the two index individ-
uals showed a germline mutation in other MMR genes
(MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2), EPCAM, or TP53 (tumor
protein p53 [MIM: 191170]), any evidence of APC mosai-
cism in leukocyte DNA, or somatic MSH2 or MSH6 muta-
tions in tumor tissue. Furthermore, IHC staining of two
adenomas per index person demonstrated a strong pres-
ence of the MMR proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and
PMS2 (Figure S6).
Effect of MSH3 Deficiency on Colorectal Tumor Tissue
IHC staining with a rabbit polyclonal antibody proved
complete nuclear loss of MSH3 in normal colon mucosa
of individual 1275.1 and in adenomas of both index per-
sons (Figure 4). In the control samples, non-tumorous mu-
cosa of an independent person with CRC showed MSH3
predominantly located in the nuclei.
In adenoma-derived DNA from both index persons, we
found stability of mononucleotide repeats. Complementa-
rily, we examined several dinucleotide and tetranucleotide

 markers in order to focus on lesions that are processed by
MSH3. Individuals 1275.1 and 1661.1 exhibited instability
of one of four (MSI-L) and three of four (MSI-H) dinucleo-
tide markers, respectively. In addition, individuals 1275.1
and 1275.2 showed instability of three of six and three
of five tetranucleotide markers, respectively, whereas
individual 1661.1 displayed instability of four of six
tetranucleotide markers (Figures 5 and S7). Thus, we
demonstrated EMAST in tumors of all three examined
individuals.
In addition, we used the adenoma-derived DNA of indi-
vidual 1661.1 to screen for somatic APC mutations. Using
targeted deep sequencing, we compared four independent
polyps with leukocyte DNA and found seven different so-
matic APC mutations (one to two per polyp) in 6%–36%
of the reads (Figure S8). All mutations were small deletions
of two to eight nucleotides. In four of seven mutations, the
sequence context proved to be di- or trinucleotide repeats.

Transcript Analyses of MSH3 Splice-Site Mutations and Confirmation of Compound Heterozygosity
(A) An agarose gel shows RT-PCR products obtained from mRNA of individual 1275.1 (lane 1) and control samples (lanes 2–3); primers
are localized in exon 21 (forward) and exon 23 (reverse). In the affected individual’s sample, a shorter band of around 165 bp is visible in
addition to the expected band of 295 bp. Sequencing of the shorter fragment demonstrated a loss of exon 22 caused by the
c.3001�2A>C mutation.
(B) An agarose gel shows RT-PCR products obtained from mRNA of individual 1661.1 (lane 1) and control samples (lanes 2–3); primers
are localized in exon 16 (forward) and exon 18 (reverse). In the affected individual’s sample, a shorter band of around 162 bp is visible in
addition to the expected band of 279 bp. Sequencing of the shorter fragment demonstrated a loss of exon 17 caused by the
c.2319�1G>A mutation.
(C) The mutation sites in family 1275 were amplified and sequenced from lymphocyte DNA of an unaffected sibling. Only one of the
mutations was detectable in the heterozygous state, confirming that the two mutations are located on separate alleles.
(D) Agarose gel shows RT-PCR products obtained from mRNA of individual 1661.1 (lane 1) and control samples (lanes 2–3); primers are
localized in exon 16 (forward) and exon 21 (reverse) in order to capture the effects of the splice-site mutation and the frameshift mu-
tation within the same amplicon. Sequencing the shorter band proved that the product of aberrant splicing does not carry frameshift
mutation c.2760delC in exon 20, whereas the frameshift mutation is present in the longer band. This confirms that the two mutations
are located on distinct transcripts and thus separate alleles (compound-heterozygous state).

 germline mutations, IHC staining showed complete loss of
PMS2 in both tumor and normal tissue (Figure S9C).
Additional clinical information and careful re-evaluation
of the medical history revealed that individual 1138 had
been diagnosed with early-onset colorectal polyposis with
20–25 adenomas at age 14 years and had undergone procto-
colectomy with pouch-anal anastomosis at age 16 years. In
addition, a primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the cere-
bellum had been diagnosed at 4 years, and a history of a pi-
lomatrixoma, thyroid cysts, and three cafe
´-au-lait spots had
been reported. The family history was unremarkable.
Mutations in Further Candidate Genes
In the remaining individuals with unexplained polyposis,
29 different rare mutations in 14 protein-coding genes
were
found
in

other
individuals
(Table

Two genes (MAGT1 [magnesium transporter 1 (MIM:

5 (MIM: 603314)]) were affected by a homozygous LoF mu-
tation in one individual each, and seven genes (BTBD9

were

Discussion
Most cases of colorectal adenomatous polyposis are attrib-
utable to heterozygous germline mutations in the tumor-
suppressor gene APC and are thus diagnosed as FAP. How-
ever, the few novel subtypes delineated in recent years
are caused by genes involved in DNA repair. Whereas het-
erozygous mutations affecting the proofreading domain
encoded by DNA polymerase genes POLE and POLD1
lead to the rare, dominantly inherited PPAP, recessive
MUTYH-associated polyposis and NTHL1-associated pol-
yposis are caused by biallelic germline mutations in BER
genes.3,7,10 After causal variants in those genes were
initially described in only a few families, identification of
additional cases expanded the mutation spectrum and al-
lowed refinement of the respective phenotypes.8,9,52,53
In a number of individuals with colorectal adenomatous
polyposis, however, no germline mutation in the estab-
lished genes has been identified. Although the synchro-
nous or metachronous occurrence of dozens to hundreds
of adenomas is strongly suggestive of an underlying ge-
netic basis, so far it remains unclear whether the predispos-
ing genetic factors mainly act in a monogenic fashion or
contribute as low- or moderate-penetrance variants to a
more complex, oligo- or polygenic trait.
Interestingly, increasing evidence suggests that biallelic
germline mutations in MMR genes can result in a phenotype
344

 with features overlapping those of colorectal polyposis.
Typically, these conditions are designated as CMMRD or
biallelic MMR deficiency and are characterized by early-
onset CRC, brain tumors, hematological malignancies, and
cafe
´-au-lait skin macules.31,32 Nonetheless, several individ-
uals with homozygous or compound-heterozygous PMS2,
MSH2, or MSH6 germline mutations and an early-onset colo-
rectal adenomatous polyposis in the second orfirst decade of
life have been described;23,31,54 the majority of these cases
were until then misclassified as mutation-negative FAP. In
some individuals, particularly those with biallelic PMS2 mu-
tations, however, the colorectal phenotype manifests not
before the third or even fourth decade of life, resembling
the clinical presentation in the present polyposis cohort.
To uncover further monogenic causes, we performed
exome sequencing of leukocyte DNA in a cohort of 102 un-
related individuals with histologically confirmed, geneti-
cally unexplained adenomatous polyposis. The clinical
and family characteristics of the participants are consistent
with published data from other mutation-negative polypo-
sis cohorts.14,15,19,55 Using this approach, we identified
two families affected by biallelic LoF germline mutations
in the MMR gene MSH3, a genotype that has not yet
been described as causative for a polyposis phenotype. In
addition, we found one individual with biallelic PMS2 mu-
tations and several persons harboring homo- and heterozy-
gous LoF variants.
Biallelic MSH3 Germline Mutations
The genotypes and pedigrees of the two unrelated persons
with compound-heterozygous MSH3 germline mutations
are in full agreement with a recessively inherited trait.

Results of Microsatellite Analysis
Five tetranucleotide repeat markers (D20S82, D2S443, D21S1436, D9S747, and UT5037) were examined in normal (N) and tumor (T)
tissue. In each tumor sample, two or three out of five markers showed clear instability and thus demonstrated elevated microsatellite
instability at selected tetranucleotide repeats (EMAST). The x axes denote peak positions related to fragment lengths. Please note that
only x axes within tumor-normal pairs allow direct comparison. The y axes quantifying peak heights were generally not standardized.
The results of both index persons were confirmed in a second colorectal adenoma (data not shown).

 Interestingly, unlike the majority of the examined cohort,
these two individuals do have affected siblings and docu-
mented extraintestinal neoplasias. Neither index person
has a germline mutation in any of the known genes associ-
ated with gastrointestinal polyposis nor any further muta-
tion in other MMR genes or EPCAM. In addition, IHC
staining of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 was normal.
The haploinsufficiency score (0.486) of MSH3 indicated
a rather low probability of haploinsufficiency (16.2%).39
In large control sets, none of the LoF MSH3 germline
mutations were identified in the homozygous state, and
the frequency of heterozygosity is compatible with a rare
recessive disease.
Confirming compound heterozygosity is critical to
demonstrating recessive inheritance; in both families, we
have clearly shown that the two mutations are located
on different alleles either by examination of an unaffected
sibling who is heterozygous for just one mutation (family
1275) or by transcript analysis indicating that both muta-
tions are located on different alleles (family 1661). Taken
together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that
deleterious MSH3 mutations follow a recessive mode of
inheritance.
The MMR system is a critical pathway that corrects base-
base and indel mispairs occurring as a result of replication
errors, thus increasing the fidelity of DNA replication.56
Defects in the MMR system result in a mutator phenotype,
which manifests as MSI in the DNA of affected cells. In tu-
mors with MSI, microsatellite loci containing mono-, di-,
tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats can be affected.57
During DNA repair, mispaired bases are recognized by two
heterodimers of MutS homologs (DNA mismatch recogni-
tion complex)—MSH2 and MSH6 (MutSa) and MSH2 and
MSH3 (MutSb)—with partially overlapping mispair-recogni-
tion specificities.56 In humans, MutSa efficiently binds sin-
gle-base substitutions and small (single-base) indel mispairs,
whereas MutSb has a stronger affinity for larger base-indel
loops with up to ten unpaired nucleotides.57,58 Thus, loss
of MutSb due to MSH3 inactivation in human cells not
only results in MSI at loci containing dinucleotide repeats
but also results in MSI at certain loci with tetranucleotide re-
peats, termed EMAST.57,59 It is known that di- and tetranu-
cleotide repeats are affected in the majority of CRC with
MSI-L.58 MMR deficiency can also result from an imbalance
in the relative amounts of MSH3 or MSH6.60
All four MSH3 germline mutations detected in the pre-
sent cohort are strongly predicted to have a LoF effect.
According to previous work, somatic MSH3 frameshift
mutations at the (A)8 repeat in exon 7 result in a loss of
MSH3.45,61 To evaluate the pathophysiological conse-
quences of the four mutations in more detail, we per-
formed several experiments. Using transcript analysis, we
confirmed aberrant splicing caused by the two mutations
located within the conserved consensus splice motifs.
This would affect regions relevant for dimerization and
for DNA recognition, according to the MSH3 structure
described by Yang’s group (Figure S5).43
Three of the four identified MSH3 mutations are pre-
dicted to result in premature stop codons and thus might
lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). However,
mRNA analysis, performed with fresh blood samples not
treated with NMD inhibitors, demonstrated that the
affected transcripts are expressed. This might be due to
NMD escape, a phenomenon that is known from several
mutations in other polyposis and MMR genes and that
was also described for MSH3. You et al. found that MSH3
transcripts with a frameshift mutation at the (A)8 repeat
in exon 7 are not degraded by NMD but instead experience
repression of protein translation.62
The western blot experiments illustrated that the altered
MSH3 proteins are shortened by the expected length
(FigureS4),whichwould leadtoa lossoftheconservedC-ter-
minal dimerization domain (Figures 2 and S5).43 Because the
stable proteins were obtained invitro ina human embryonic
kidney cell line and a strong promoter for high-level expres-
sion, this observation is not per se transferable to the in vivo
situation. In fact, IHC staining clearly demonstrated loss of
nuclear MSH3 in both normal and colorectal tumor tissues
of the affected individuals, confirming the expected MSH3
deficiency. Different mechanisms such as repressed protein
translationorblocked nucleartransportbyhampered dimer-
ization or changes in protein conformation might explain
the nuclear absence of MSH3.
Microsatellite analysis of adenoma-derived DNA demon-
strated EMAST, high and low instability at dinucleotide
markers, and no instability at mononucleotide repeats in
any of the examined tumors. These findings further
confirm the functional relevance of the MSH3 mutations.
In addition, presumed effects of the MSH3 deficiency are
well reflected by the inflammatory infiltration, a character-
istic feature of MSI colorectal tumors, and the somatic APC
mutation spectrum observed in the adenomas.
Several lines of evidence support the causal relevance of
MSH3 deficiency to the initiation of genetic instability and
tumorigenesis. Around 50% of MSI tumors contain so-
matic frameshift mutations in the (A)8 tract in codons
381–383 of MSH3.57,63,64 The detection of LOH in some
of these tumors supports the role of MSH3 and MSH6 as pri-
mary mutators. In CRC and human colon epithelial cells,
MSH3 deficiency is associated with EMAST ([AAAG]n re-
peats) and MSI-L at dinucleotide repeats and results in
the formation of double-strand breaks and significant
changes in the proteome.57,65
In yeast and extracts of Msh3�/� cells, Msh3 deficiency
leads to a partial MMR defect and MSI.66–68 In mouse
models, elimination of either Msh3 or Msh6 alone still
maintains some functional MMR activity, which is consis-
tent with the persistence of the MutSa or MutSb hetero-
dimer, respectively. Of all MMR-knockout mice, Msh3-defi-
cient mice exhibited the lowest, yet still significantly
elevated, mutation frequencies in comparison to wild-
type mice.68

 relevance of MSH3 germline variants in cancer predisposi-
tion has remained uncertain until now. To date, MSH3 mu-
tations have neither been consistently linked to a Lynch-
like phenotype nor described in polyposis cases. In several
previous studies, common MSH3 polymorphisms were
significantly associated with CRC and prostate cancer as
low-penetrance risk alleles.69–72 In contrast, a potentially
high-penetrance pathogenic MSH3 germline mutation
has very rarely been identified in persons with a suspected
predisposition to cancer.73,74 Msh3-deficient mice develop
late-onset MSI gastrointestinal cancers. However, given the
small number of reported tumors, the significance of this
finding remains unclear, and survival did not differ signif-
icantly from that of wild-type control animals.67,75,76
In a Chinese cohort with suspected familial breast can-
cer, Yang et al. found three heterozygous MSH3 germline
variants (two in-frame deletions and one frameshift muta-
tion; Table S5). They examined eight tumor samples from
three families, and all showed MSS in the standard marker
panel (BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S346, and D17S250)
and, on average, two instable loci in nine additional dinu-
cleotide or EMAST markers. Two individuals showed less
MSH3 staining in tumor tissue (breast and ovary) than
was shown in normal tissue.74 One family showed no evi-
dence of Lynch syndrome; the MSH3 in-frame variant
segregated incompletely with the disease, and MSH3 stain-
ing showed no relevant deficiency in the tumors. The sec-
ond family met the clinical criteria for Lynch syndrome,
and the MSH3 in-frame germline variant segregated well
with the disease in three generations. However, the tumor
spectrum was broad and included breast, ovarian, renal,
and colon cancer. It was not reported whether genetic
causes of Lynch syndrome had been excluded systemati-
cally. The third family carried the MSH3 frameshift variant,
which incompletely segregated with the disease. A com-
parison with currently available frequency data in the gen-
eral population (ExAC Browser) suggests that both in-
frame deletions are likely to be polymorphisms (Table S5).
In a family with suspected but genetically unexplained
Lynch syndrome, Duraturo et al. found that two brothers
each with three metachronous CRCs had a compound-
heterozygous MSH3 genotype comprising a potentially
pathogenic missense variant and a silent variant.73 How-
ever, no functional data to confirm the pathogenicity of
the variants was reported. Moreover, the silent MSH3
variant is meanwhile listed as a frequent polymorphism
(rs1805355; Table S5).
In our study, all carriers of biallelic MSH3 mutations have
attenuated colorectal and duodenal involvement and no
or late-onset cancer. This is similar to the phenotype
observed in persons with MAP or attenuated FAP and is
consistent
with
the
phenotype
described
in
MSH3-
knockout mice. Two of the four carriers are reported to
have extraintestinal tumors: whereas various thyroid neo-
plasias also occur in FAP and MAP individuals, the early-
onset
astrocytoma
fits
well
in
the
tumor
spectrum
observed in CMMRD.
A high frequency of EMAST was also observed in a wide
range of extraintestinal sporadic malignancies, such as
skin, bladder, kidney, lung, ovarian, head, and neck can-
cer,59,77,78 although the underlying mechanism remained
unclear, and an association with MSH3 impairment was
not proven. Recent studies, however, provide strong evi-
dence that EMAST formation is driven by MSH3 deficiency
either as a result of MSH3 mutations or, e.g., by a nuclear-
to-cytosol shift induced by oxidative stress.79,80 Thus,
it can be speculated that MSH3-induced EMAST is more
common than previously thought and might occur in
different tumor types. Consequently, the tumor spectrum
in individuals with biallelic MSH3 germline mutations
might include a much broader extraintestinal tumor spec-
trum than observed in the persons identified in the present
study.
Although the clinical information and underlying mo-
lecular changes point to a broader tumor spectrum and
some degree of overlap with CMMRD, exploring the whole
oncologic phenotype will require further individuals with
biallelic MSH3 mutations.
Biallelic PMS2 Germline Mutations
The identification of one individual with a biallelic PMS2
mutation demonstrates that CMMRD is a rare but impor-
tant
cause
of
adenomatous
polyposis.
The
c.2T>A
(p.Met1?) start-loss mutation is listed twice in ClinVar
and is considered pathogenic. According to data from the
ExAC Browser, the allele frequency of this mutation in
the European population is 0.003%. Apart from the indi-
vidual reported here, we recently identified another person
with a CMMRD phenotype (B cell lymphoma, acute
lymphatic leukemia, carcinoma of the rectum, and a multi-
focal grade III-IV astrocytoma occurring between the ages
of 9 and 15 years) in a multiple-tumor cohort. This person
carries similar start-loss (c.1A>T [p.Met1?]) and frameshift
(c.2117delA [p.Lys706Serfs*19]) mutations in PMS2. A
similar potential founder mutation in the start codon
(c.1A>G) was found in three unrelated CMMRD individ-
uals, all of whom have a compound-heterozygous PMS2
genotype and isolated loss of PMS2 on IHC staining.81
The PMS2 locus-specific database (Leiden Open Variation
Database [LOVD]) lists a fourth family with the same geno-
type. Although the person identified in the present study
has extracolonic features suggestive of CMMRD, these
manifestations are often unspecific and could remain unre-
ported or unrecognized (e.g., cafe
´-au-lait spots). This sug-
gests that CMMRD is an underdiagnosed condition and
should be included in the differential diagnosis of any un-
explained early-onset case of adenomatous polyposis.
Further Candidate Genes
Under the assumption of a monogenic mode of inheri-
tance with high penetrance, the frequency of causative
germline mutations in the general population is expected
to be low. In 26 of the 96 remaining individuals (excluding
three samples after quality control and three resolved
The American Journal of Human Genetics 99, 337–351, August 4, 2016
347
 cases), we identified unique (i.e., not present in control in-
dividuals) or rare (i.e., frequency < 0.01% for the dominant
or 1% for the recessive model in control individuals)
potentially pathogenic germline variants in 14 protein-
coding genes. The causative relevance of these interesting
candidate genes awaits exploration in larger cohorts and
via functional analysis.
In the present study, mutations might have been over-
looked, e.g., in low-coverage regions or within repeat tracts
in coding sequences. Moreover, some causative mutations
might be located beyond the exome, e.g., in non-coding
regions or in unannotated genes.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study describes the identification of
biallelic pathogenic MSH3 germline mutations as a cause
of an inherited tumor syndrome. Specifically, biallelic
LoF MSH3 germline mutations appear to cause an addi-
tional rare recessively inherited subtype of colorectal
adenomatous polyposis, which was present in 2% of the
study participants. Data from the present and previous
studies consistently show that mutations in newly identi-
fied genes associated with inherited tumor predisposition
syndromes are very rare (0.3%–0.5% in unexplained pol-
yposis cohorts with familial cancer).7,82 At least some of
these syndromes appear to show extreme genetic hetero-
geneity, and identifying recurrently mutated genes will
require large cohorts.
Preliminary experiments indicate that MSH3-deficient
cells are more sensitive to cisplatin treatment or plat-
inum-based adjuvant treatment for CRC.57 Thus, MSH3
deficiency might also be of therapeutic relevance for indi-
viduals with MSH3-associated polyposis.
