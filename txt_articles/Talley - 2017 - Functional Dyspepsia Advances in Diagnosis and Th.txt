Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common but under-recognized 
syndrome comprising bothersome recurrent postprandial 
fullness, early satiety, or epigastric pain/burning. Epidemio-
logically, there are two clinically distinct FD syndromes (al-
though these often overlap clinically): postprandial distress 
syndrome (PDS; comprising early satiety or meal-related 
fullness) and epigastric pain syndrome. Symptoms of gastro-
esophageal reflux disease overlap with FD more than expect-
ed by chance; a subset has pathological acid reflux. The pre-
test probability of FD in a patient who presents with classical 
FD symptoms and no alarm features is high, approximately 
0.7. Coexistent heartburn should not lead to the exclusion of 
FD as a diagnosis. One of the most exciting observations in 
FD has been the consistent finding of increased duodenal 
eosinophilia, notably in PDS. Small bowel homing T cells, 
signaling intestinal inflammation, and increased cytokines 
have been detected in the circulation, and elevated tumor 
necrosis factor-α levels have been significantly correlated 
with increased anxiety. Postinfectious gastroenteritis is a risk 
factor for FD. Therapeutic options remain limited and provide 
only symptomatic benefit in most cases. Only one therapy is 
known to change the natural history of FD–Helicobacter py-
lori eradication. Treatment of duodenal eosinophilia is under 
investigation. (Gut Liver 2017;11:349-357)
Key Words: Functional dyspepsia; Epidemiology
INTRODUCTION
Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common 
unexplained gastrointestinal (GI) symptom complexes that 
are thought to arise from different regions of the GI tract, and 
the two most recognized disorders are functional dyspepsia 
(FD) and the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). FD is a clinical 
syndrome comprising chronic symptoms arising from the gas-
troduodenal region.
1 According to the Rome criteria, based on 
expert consensus, the prototypical symptoms are bothersome 
recurrent postprandial fullness, inability to finish a normal sized 
meal (early satiety), epigastric pain or epigastric burning in the 
setting of a normal upper endoscopy.
2 However, many patients 
with FD also experience other troublesome symptoms including 
nausea, bloating, belching, and heartburn.
FD comprises two clinical syndromes which in clinical prac-
tice can overlap. Postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) is always 
meal related and refers to bothersome and frequent early satiety 
or postprandial fullness. These meal related symptoms are more 
common than heartburn and are reported by over 40% of the U.S. 
general population.
3 A less common FD syndrome is epigastric 
pain syndrome (EPS) where patients present with recurrent and 
bothersome epigastric pain or less commonly epigastric burn-
ing.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
In 100 population-based studies comprising over 312,000 
subjects, the pooled prevalence of uninvestigated dyspepsia 
was 21% (95% confidence interval, 18% to 24%); the risk of 
dyspepsia was increased in females and those with Helicobacter 
pylori infection, smokers, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drug users.
4 Over 75% with dyspepsia postinvestigation includ-
ing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will have no obvious 
structural explanation and based on current consensus are ap-
propriately labelled as having FD. The most frequent finding 
of sometimes questionable significance is esophagitis (13%) 
followed by peptic ulcer (8%); in a meta-analysis of over 5,000 
subjects endoscoped, only peptic ulcer was significantly associ-
ated with dyspepsia with a 2-fold increased risk.
5
In Olmsted County in the United States, evidence has emerged 
that FD is underdiagnosed in clinical practice; only 12.5% with 
FD symptoms received an FD diagnosis.

tients with FD symptoms are more likely to be given the label 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) even if acid suppression 
therapy is unsuccessful.
6
In FD, an increased risk of atopic diseases most notably 
asthma has been observed in a general practice database in the 
United Kingdom.
7 Atopy may explain the finding of increased 
upper intestinal eosinophilia in FD, first reported in adults by 
Talley et al.
8 Further, an increased risk of autoimmune disease 
has now been observed based on an extensive analysis of over 
23,000 patients and controls from the U.K. general practice da-
tabase; rheumatological disease in particular was increased.
9
FD impacts on quality of life and impaired quality of life is 
associated with symptom severity and comorbid depression.
10,11 
The direct and indirect costs of FD because it is a highly preva-
lent and chronic condition are enormous. Extrapolating data 
on FD patients to the U.S. population, it has been calculated in 
2009 the costs of FD were $18.4 billion,
12 and other indepen-
dent data support these high cost figures.
13,14 However, there is 
no mortality associated with dyspepsia symptoms in the general 
population indicating FD once diagnosed is a benign disorder 
and repeat EGD usually unhelpful.
15
DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of FD remains one of exclusion as EGD is 
required to exclude peptic ulceration, esophagitis and malig-
nancy.
16 The Rome III criteria in terms of distinguishing FD 
from structural diseases such as peptic ulceration remain no 
better than previous Rome definitions, with a diagnostic sensi-
tivity of 61% and a specificity of 69%, both suboptimal.
17 The 
pretest probability of FD in the patient who presents with classi-
cal dyspepsia (fullness, satiety, or epigastric pain) and no alarm 
features however is high, around 0.7 and therefore a provisional 
diagnosis in clinical practice can be considered in selected cases. 
Arguably the complaint that is the strongest indicator of FD is 
early satiety, a very distinctive symptom now linked to a spe-
cific duodenal pathology as discussed below.
8 Many patients 
with FD present with overlapping symptoms of PDS and EPS 
although in population-based studies PDS and EPS separate out 
more clearly.
18,19 
1. Meal testing
Meal induced symptoms are an important and increasingly 
recognized feature of FD. In a landmark study, a solid test meal 
was ingested by patients with FD who either self-reported they 
had meal induced symptoms such as fullness or bloating, or 
reported their symptoms were not meal induced. However, re-
markably most subjects despite their recollection had symptoms 
after the meal as recorded by diary every 15 minutes for 240 
minutes, and these symptoms were clearly increased compared 
with healthy controls.
20 Interestingly, those who self-reported 
they had meal induced symptoms generally developed symp-
toms early (within 15 minutes) after ingestion and fullness and 
bloating predominated, while those who self-reported no meal 
relationship usually had delayed postprandial symptom induc-
tion and pain or burning predominated.
20
An objective test in FD that assesses meal related symptoms 
is the nutrient test meal. A standard approach is after an 8-hour 
fast, provide 200 mL of a standardized enteral feeding solu-
tion (e.g., Ensure) every 5 minutes up to a cumulative volume 
of 800 mL; following each 200 mL drink, five key symptoms 
are assessed (fullness, abdominal pain, retrosternal/abdominal 
burning, nausea, and regurgitation) using a standardized instru-
ment on visual analogue scales (0 to 100), and the cumulative 
symptom score across all symptoms calculated.
21,22 The findings 
correlate with gastric motor and sensory dysfunction and are an 
indirect measure of gastric accommodation, but are decreased 
in old age.
21,22 However, the diagnostic utility of a nutrient test 
meal has not been investigated in the clinical setting and it 
remains an investigational tool. Irregular meal ingestion and 
rapid eating behavior are risk factors for FD perhaps because 
gastroduodenal dysfunction limits normal eating and may even 
promote weight loss.
23,24
2. Differentiating FD from gastroparesis
A particularly confusing issue yet to be resolved is how to 
distinguish gastroparesis from FD. The fundamental problem is 
slow gastric emptying occurs in 25% with FD but there is no 
clear-cut symptom complex associated.
25 The U.S. gastroparesis 
consortium definition that has been widely applied, namely 
that gastroparesis refers to upper GI symptoms and slow gastric 
emptying is arguably unhelpful, as symptom correlation with 
slow emptying in this broader patient cohort is modest to poor, 
slow gastric emptying on repeat testing is not a very consistent 
finding, and accelerating gastric emptying with prokinetics fails 
to accurately parallel symptom response.
26 If gastroparesis is 
more strictly defined as very slow gastric emptying (3 or more 
standard deviations from normal), then vomiting and weight 
loss may be more predictably associated and the true albeit rare 
syndrome apparent.
27
3. Confusion with GERD
Symptoms of GERD overlap with FD as otherwise defined by 
Rome III more than expected by chance; a subset of these over-
lap cases have pathological acid reflux.
28 Recent data suggest 
gastric disaccommodation increases the number of transient 
lower esophageal relaxations.
29 As a subset with FD (up to 40%) 
also have a failure of gastric accommodation, this may account 
for the overlap of FD with GERD, and further suggests the strict 
exclusion of all heartburn from the definition of FD introduces 
substantial selection bias.

4. Confusion with other FGIDs
In clinical practice, other symptoms may accompany dys-
pepsia and if predominant can point to alternative diagnoses. 
In particular, frequent vomiting is a very unusual symptom in 
the dyspepsia symptom complex and in addition to considering 
gastroparesis and other rarer causes such as brain stem disease, 
drugs including cannabis (that can induce cyclic vomiting and 
sometimes compulsive bathing behavior) need consideration.
30 
Unrelenting abdominal pain is not a feature of FD and other 
possibilities such as functional abdominal pain syndrome or 
narcotic bowel syndrome should be considered.
31,32
PATHOGENESIS
1. Familial aggregation and genes
Familial aggregation of abdominal pain has been reported in 
FD implying either genes or early life factors must be important 
in the pathogenesis.
33 Genetic factors likely play a role in disease 
pathogenesis but data are limited. Evidence implicates disturbed 
signal transduction in FD with a number of studies linking the 
polymorphism GNB3 C825T to FD. Both the CC and TT variant 
have been associated with FD in different populations.
34-36 The 
relevance of other genetic variants is less certain and contradic-
tory in the literature, and large robust studies are needed.
37
2. Psychological distress
New evidence suggests anxiety often precedes the onset of 
FD. Among 703 community subjects who completed question-
naires and an upper endoscopy at entry, 10 years later the risk 
of FD developing was nearly 8-fold increased in those with 
higher anxiety levels; depression on the other hand was not a 
risk factor.
38 Further, the risk of FD in those with anxiety was 
limited to PDS and not EPS.
38 Other data suggest one-third of 
people who develop an FGID like FD have symptoms that begin 
in the gut then new onset psychological distress develops; half 
to two-thirds start with anxiety and then develop gut symptoms 
suggesting a central rather than peripheral pathogenesis.
39
Sleep dysfunction and multiple somatic complaints are also 
more common in FD in community based studies,
33 but in-
creased somatic complaints may be as frequent in those with 
a definite structural explanation for their dyspepsia as in cases 
with FD, suggesting FD is not simply a somatization disorder.
40 
A history of abuse is more frequent in FD but abuse does not 
appear to be an independent risk factor once depression and 
other psychological factors are controlled for in the analyses.
41
3. Gastroduodenal motor and sensory dysfunction
Gastric emptying is slow in 25% of patients with FD, but 
symptoms fail to correlate with delayed gastric emptying in this 
syndrome; in a very small number, rapid gastric emptying has 
also been documented.
42 While gastric emptying is a biomarker 
of a subset with FD, it does not appear to explain the reduced 
quality of life documented in such patients.
43 Gastric hypersen-
sitivity and impaired gastric accommodation also occur in sub-
sets of patients, and these abnormalities can overlap.
44 Recent 
observations suggest patients with PDS and impaired gastric 
accommodation are more likely to have anxiety too.
45
Perturbations of duodenal function have also been docu-
mented in acid infusion experiments implicating duodenal dys-
function in FD. Notably, in health acid can sensitize volunteers 
to the development of dyspepsia symptoms, and impair antral 
contractility while increasing upper intestinal contractility.
46 
Acid instilled into the duodenum also relaxes the stomach iden-
tifying a duodenum-gastric excitatory reflex pathway that is 
partly inhibited by local anaesthetic.
47
Further, postprandial gut hormone response may be abnormal 
in FD. Thus raised ghrelin levels after breakfast has been ob-
served in FD compared with healthy controls.
48 Excessive local 
release of cholecystokinin (CCK) after duodenal lipid ingestion 
has also been observed and independently confirmed, further 
implicating the duodenum in the pathogenesis of FD; CCK re-
lease may stimulate vagal afferents that increase gut-brain cross 
talking.
49-51 
4. Duodenal eosinophilia
One of the most exciting observations in FD has been the 
consistent finding of duodenal eosinophilia in many cases with 
PDS around the world, following the first report in adults by 
Talley et al.
8,52-55 The normal cutoff may vary geographically 
but more than 22 eosinophils in 5 high power fields is gener-
ally considered abnormal; otherwise biopsies look normal and 
the eosinophilia will not usually be detected unless counting is 
performed (Fig. 1). In Belgium, elegant experimental work has 
confirmed duodenal eosinophilia and also observed increased

dyspepsia (H&E, ×40) (with permission from Walker MM and Talley 
NJ, 2016).
 352  Gut and Liver, Vol. 11, No. 3, May 2017
duodenal mast cells.
56 Notably the patient cohort in nine of the 
15 cases had overlapping FD and IBS which may account for 
the increased mast cells, as Walker et al.
56 found duodenal mast 
cells were characteristic of IBS but not pure (nonoverlapping) 
FD.
Further, submucosal neuronal structural and functional 
changes have been identified in the duodenum in FD linked 
to the duodenal eosinophilia and mast cell infiltration.
57,58 In 
an Australian endoscopic study, smoking was a risk factor for 
duodenal eosinophilia
53 and similar results were reported in a 
population-based study from Iran.
59 In further elegant work 
from Australia, small bowel homing T cells, signaling intestinal 
inflammation, and increased cytokines have been detected in 
the circulation, and elevated tumor necrosis factor-α levels have 
been significantly correlated with increased anxiety.
60 The find-
ings suggest immune dysregulation is a key feature of a large 
subset with FD and a better understanding of the immunology 
holds out hope for novel approaches to therapy.
61
What may induce duodenal eosinophilia and FD? Recent 
epidemiological data from Australia suggest exposure to herbi-
vore pets (e.g., horses) but not carnivores (e.g., dogs) is associ-
ated with an increased risk of FD.
62 Horses are heavily infested 
with parasites which can induce eosinophilic inflammation in 
the human gut, so this hypothesis makes sense albeit it needs 
confirmation.
62 Food allergy or intolerance, particularly wheat 
exposure has been hypothesized to be important in FD but firm 
data are needed.
63 Antibiotics and postinfectious gastroenteritis 
are risk factors perhaps through altering the microbiome.
64,65 
5. Postinfectious FD
FD is now established to develop after acute bacterial, pro-
tozoal or viral gastroenteritis, with a 2.5-fold increased risk.
66 
Alternatively, post-gastroenteritis IBS or an overlap syn-
drome comprising FD and IBS can develop, implying a similar 
pathogenesis for the postinfectious subset.
66,67 Risk factors for 
postinfectious FD include smoking,
66 and smoking is a risk fac-
tor for duodenal eosinophilia.
53 Japanese investigators have 
noted increased duodenal eosinophils in postinfectious FD,
68 
and postinfection early satiety and gastric disaccommodation 
are significantly more likely
69 suggesting duodenal eosinophilia 
may occur after gut infection and this is linked to proximal 
gastric dysfunction. After giardia infection among cases with 
postinfectious IBS and postprandial dyspepsia symptoms, in-
creased duodenal CCK in the mucosa has been reported perhaps 
explaining the increased circulating CCK levels observed by 
others as described above.
70 Baseline psychological distress is 
also a risk factor for postinfectious FD.
68
One unifying hypothesis linking duodenal inflammation and 
postinfectious FGID is the symptom phenotype depends on the 
distribution of the postinfectious inflammation; if limited to 
the proximal intestine FD can result but if more widespread the 
overlap of FD and IBS may eventuate.
71
TREATMENT
A firm diagnosis followed by explanation and reassurance 
are key elements of the therapeutic equation and may help 
maximize the placebo response if therapy is prescribed. Those 
with fluctuating symptoms are more likely to respond to pla-
cebo.
72 Simple dietary advice may help some patients although 
randomized controlled trials are lacking. In particular, eating 
small meals that are low fat is a reasonable starting point.
73 
Multiple drug classes have been trialed to treat FD but thera-
peutic options remain limited and provide in most cases only 
symptomatic benefit (Table 1). Only one therapy is known to 
change the natural history of FD and that is H. pylori eradica-
tion therapy.
74-76 
1. H. pylori identification and treatment
Randomized controlled trials have compared eradication 
therapy with either placebo or acid suppression. While some 
trials have failed to observe a clear difference from placebo this 
is likely related to them being underpowered
77 as others have 
shown a clear benefit.
78 A meta-analysis concluded H. pylori 
eradication therapy was superior to either placebo or antisecre-
tory therapy with a number needed to treat of 17.
79 The Kyoto 
consensus conference concluded if a patient with FD and H. py-
lori infection responds to eradication therapy and the treatment 
response persists, then the correct diagnosis is H. pylori associ-
ated dyspepsia; the majority who fail to obtain symptom relief 
despite successful eradication therapy have FD until proven 
otherwise.
80 However, no trial has randomized both H. pylori 
positive and negative patients to eradication therapy or placebo 
to test the alternative hypothesis that antibiotic therapy is the 
reason symptoms settle through alteration of the gastroduode-
nal microbiome.
81
2. Acid suppression 
Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has become first line 
treatment for FD
82 but it is important to recognize the major-
ity of patients will fail this approach even if high dose PPI is 
prescribed.
79 The best response is seen in those with epigastric 
pain.
83 Further, closer study of the meta-analysis data reveals 
H2 blockade may be more efficacious than PPI although the H2 
blocker data are admittedly more heterogeneous.
79 If true, the 
benefit of H2 blockade cannot be explained by acid suppression 
alone. It is of interest mast cell infiltration may lead to hista-
mine release and one could speculate this is a potential reason 
for any efficacy. Combining a H1 with a H2 blocker anecdotally 
may reduce dyspepsia symptoms and we have seen success in 
adults.
84 PPIs do inhibit eotaxin and therefore may also suppress 
duodenal eosinophils if present.
85
3. Prokinetic
Prokinetic therapy overall is superior to placebo based on me-
  Talley NJ: Functional Dyspepsia: Advances in Diagnosis and Therapy  353
ta-analysis data of randomized controlled trials but the results 
are largely driven by cisapride that has limited to no availability 
and was withdrawn because of concern over QT prolongation 
and the risk of sudden death.
79 Cisapride, a 5HT4 agonist does 
relax the gastric fundus plus it has 5HT3 antagonist actions that 
may improve nausea. 
Very limited and poor quality evidence exists for any benefit 
of metoclopramide in FD and side effects including tardive dys-
kinesia limits this drugs use. Domperidone, a peripherally acting 
dopamine 2 antagonist, is an alternative but again the evidence 
of efficacy is limited and it can also prolong the QT interval so 
its use must be judiciously considered.
86
Itopride is of uncertain efficacy following two major trials 
that were essentially negative
87 although a meta-analysis of nine 
trials supported its therapeutic application providing evidence in 
support of a landmark trial published in the New England Jour-
nal of Medicine.
88,89 The inconsistency of the results may reflect 
patient selection issues; the pivotal negative phase III trials had 
very strict entry criteria excluding any GERD but other positive 
studies did not apply the same approach and allowed reflux 
symptoms. As there is accumulating evidence reflux symptoms 
are part of the spectrum of FD, the strict exclusion of heartburn 
is probably inappropriate. Mosapride does relax the gastric fun-
dus
90 but in a meta-analysis mosapride was not superior to pla-
cebo in FD and the drug cannot at this time be recommended.
91 
Acotiamide, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases ace-
tylcholine release in the enteric nervous system, is efficacious 
based on a meta-analysis in a dose of 100 mg three times daily 
but only for PDS, not EPS; it is commercially available in Japan 
and trials in Europe are progressing.
92,93 
Buspirone, an antianxiety agent, relaxes the gastric fundus 
through its action on 5HT1 receptors, and in a randomized 
cross-over clinical trial reduced PDS symptoms over placebo at 
a dose of 10 mg three times daily over 4 weeks.
94
4. Antidepressants
The largest randomized controlled trial to date included 292 
patients who were randomized to the low dose tricyclic ami-
triptyline (25 mg for 2 weeks then 50 mg for 10 weeks), escita-
lopram (a full dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] 
at 10 mg for 12 weeks) or placebo. The tricyclic was efficacious 
for those with epigastric pain but was not of benefit in those 
with delayed gastric emptying.
95 A meta-analysis of psychotro-
pic agents concluded tricyclic antidepressants were superior to 
placebo but there remains a risk of side effects with this class 
of agents with the number needed to harm being seven.
96 There 
was no benefit observed over placebo with the SSRIs or selective 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

were also superior to placebo.
96 Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic an-
tidepressant with antinausea properties. One trial suggested a 
trend towards symptom improvement compared with placebo in 
FD but the results were not definitive.
97 
5. Miscellaneous therapies
Montelukast, the antiasthma drug and eosinophil stabilizer, 
was superior to placebo in a small randomized controlled trial 
in pediatric patients with FD but no adult data are available.
98 
Iberogast (STW5) is a nine herb combination that relaxes the 
gastric fundus through unknown mechanisms.
99 The product 
has modest efficacy in FD based on randomized trials although 
methodological issues limit interpretability of the data.
100 
Acupuncture studies have suggested a possible benefit but 
the risk of bias remains high in the available studies and more 
convincing evidence is needed to exclude a placebo effect.
101 In 
difficult or resistant cases, combination therapy including psy-
chological and centrally acting drug treatment should be con-
sidered as the outcomes are likely improved based on limited 
randomized trial evidence.
102
PROGNOSIS
In the general population, two studies have observed dys-
pepsia is not associated with any reduction of life expectancy 
confirming FD is a benign diagnosis.
15,103 Ten years follow-up 
data from a population-based endoscopy study has provided a 
clearer picture of the prognosis of FD; only a minority resolve 
(20%), others develop a new FGID with or without GERD (37%) 
and the remainder (43%) have persistent dyspepsia.
38 
CONCLUSIONS
FD is a common disorder; up to 40% appear to have struc-
tural alterations in the duodenum including increased duodenal 
permeability, duodenal eosinophilia and neural alterations, 
suggesting the term functional is a misnomer. GERD and FD 
may in some cases share a similar pathogenesis and separating 
GERD from FD is largely artificial. FD symptoms impair quality 
of life and treatment is indicated if simple measures such as re-
assurance and dietary restrictions fail. Medical therapy remains 
largely symptom driven although in patients with H. pylori 
infection there is the hope of symptom cure in a small minority 
with eradication therapy. The observation of duodenal eosino-
philia in a substantial proportion with FD has opened up new 
diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities.
