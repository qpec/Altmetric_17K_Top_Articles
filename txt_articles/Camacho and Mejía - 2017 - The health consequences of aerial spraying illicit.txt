Abstract 
This paper exploits the variation in aerial spraying across time and space in 
Colombia and employs a panel of individual health records in order to study the 
causal effects of aerial spraying of herbicides (Glyphosate) on health-related 
outcomes. Our results show that an increase in the amount of aerial spraying in a 
municipality increases the number of medical consultations related to the 
exposure of Glyphosate that the municipality’s inhabitants present. This finding is 
robust to the inclusion of individual fixed effects, which compares the prevalence 
of Glyphosate related consultations for the same person under different levels of 
exposure to the herbicide. We find strong negative effects on dermatological 
problems and abortions, while there is no evidence of effects on respiratory 
diseases.

1. Introduction 
One of the main strategies of the anti-drug programs in producing countries such as 
Colombia, Mexico and Afghanistan, is the aerial spraying of herbicides aimed at destroying 
crops, the raw material of hard drug production4.  Under the so-called Plan Colombia, for 
instance, the average annual number of hectares sprayed with herbicides during the last 
decade has been 128,000. At its peak, in 2006, 172,000 hectares were aerially sprayed with 
glyphosate (see Figure 1). The effectiveness of this approach has been thoroughly defended 
by the US and Colombian governments and heatedly attacked and questioned by NGOs and 
opponents of the so-called “war on drugs”. Nevertheless, the debate about the effectiveness 
of aerial spraying campaigns and its collateral costs is often based on ideological grounds, 
and has very rarely taken the available and emerging scientific evidence seriously. 
However, both structural evaluations (Mejia and Restrepo, 2011) and reduced-form 
estimation techniques using arguably exogenous sources of variation (Reyes, 2011 and 
Mejia et al., 2012), indicate that aerial spraying campaigns of coca crops in Colombia are 
not effective strategies in reducing the levels of coca cultivation. On top of its 
ineffectiveness, this “chemical war”, as it has often been called by opponents of the war on 
drugs, has been blamed to generate all sorts of collateral negative effects. Among others, 
the distrust of local affected populations on State and Government institutions5, non-
negligible negative effects on the environment6 (especially on the amphibian populations 
through the contamination of water sources) and negative externalities on health. However, 
it is important to note that most of the evidence on these collateral effects comes from field 
work that is hard to generalize and to causally analyze. Field work and anecdotal evidence 
are plagued by confounding factors, coca cultivation itself being the most important one, 
and these factors make it difficult to blame aerial spraying as a direct cause of the 
mentioned maladies. More precisely, given the high spatial correlation between coca

etc.) and on animal species.

cultivation and the occurrence of aerial spraying campaigns, it is easily arguable that if coca 
cultivation and cocaine production themselves make indiscriminate use of pesticides and 
other agricultural inputs and chemical precursors, then these activities can be the ones 
generating the negative health and environmental consequences observed by NGOs in the 
field. In short, most of the evidence (anecdotal, from field work and empirical) is plagued 
by issues of endogeneity and confounding factors that have made it hard to reach 
conclusions regarding the effects of spraying campaigns on health outcomes.  
In this paper we take the issue of endogeneity seriously and use a large administrative panel 
data set that contains individual health records, together with very precise information of 
aerial spraying events at a daily and municipal level, in order to disentangle the causal 
effect of aerial spraying of herbicides on a broad range of health outcomes. Our 
identification strategy relies on the fact that we observe individuals in our sample more than 
once, allowing us to compare the evolution of glyphosate-related diagnostics under 
different levels of exposure to aerial campaigns over time. Our data covers more than 50 
million observations and 8 million individuals, as well as the number of square kilometers 
daily sprayed over a period of five years (between January 2003 and December 2007). We 
estimate individual fixed effects regressions of dermatological, respiratory diagnoses and 
abortions. The individual fixed effects specification allows us to compare the increase in 
the probability of having a health problem related to the aerial spraying of herbicides for 
the same individual, exposed to different levels of aerial spraying at different moments in 
time. Our findings indicate that aerial spraying of glyphosate increases the probability of 
having dermatological problems and abortions. These results are robust to different 
specifications of the empirical model and to the inclusion of a wide range of controls. We 
do not find any significant impact of aerial spraying on respiratory-related illnesses. It is 
important to highlight that given the nature of our data, we are unable to capture long-term 
effects that might translate into lower life expectancy, quality of life or productivity.  
 
There are four main strengths and contributions of our paper relative to the existing 
literature.  First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper in the literature to take 
 4 
 
the issue of causality seriously when trying to estimate the effect of spraying of illicit crops 
on health outcomes in a drug-producing country. In particular, given that the exact timing 
and magnitude of spraying campaigns is difficult to be anticipated, spraying events are 
arguably an exogenous shock from the individuals’ point of view. This allows us to have an 
appropriate quasi-experimental design to test the effects of aerial spraying on health 
outcomes. Second, the large sample size is an important strength of our paper, both in terms 
of the internal and external validity of our results.  We use a dataset containing 
administrative records on all the health service institutions in Colombia from 2003 to 2007, 
accounting for more than 50 million visits to the doctor and approximately 2.5 million 
completed and non-completed birth registrations.  The large sample size of our dataset also 
allows us to find very robust and precise results in the econometric specifications.  Third, 
our data is appropriate for establishing a precise link between the date and magnitude of 
aerial spraying and the day in which individuals go to the hospital to see the doctor or visit 
the Emergency Room. Finally, the individual-level panel allows us to estimate an 
individual fixed-effects model that isolates genetic, behavioral and other unobserved 
individual characteristics that do not change over time. This is important in order to rule out 
confounding factors and omitted variable bias in our estimations.  
The paper proceeds as follows.  Section 2 reviews the relevant medical and epidemiological 
literature related to the effects of the exposure to herbicides on health outcomes.  Section 3 
describes the data in detail; Section 4 discusses the basic theoretical framework behind our 
empirical strategy. Section 5 reports and analyses the main results.  
 
2.  A short review of the medical and epidemiological literature on the collateral 
effects of spraying campaigns on health outcomes  
A wide variety of medical studies have documented the negative impacts of glyphosate 
on human health. Sanborn et al. (2004) argue that aerial spraying generates dermatological 
problems in populations exposed to it; among these, they highlight burnings, irritations and 
skin redness. On the other hand, Sherret (2005) finds that the spraying of glyphosate is 
related to different respiratory diseases, mainly irritation of the lower respiratory tract and, 
 5 
 
sometimes, even lung cancer. Cox (1995) documents cases of poisoning in humans, with 
symptoms like gastrointestinal pain, vomiting, pulmonary dysfunction, destruction of red 
blood cells, gastrointestinal erosion, low blood pressure and kidney damage.  
Some researchers have also addressed the effects of aerial spraying on abortions and fetus 
malformations. In particular, Sherret (2005) argues that pesticides affect the regulation of 
the embryonic cycle, which may result in abnormal fetus development. Studies by Sanborn 
et al. (2004), Regidor et al. (2004) and Sanborn et al. (2007) indicate that exposition to 
pesticides before conception is associated with abortions during the first trimester of 
pregnancy. They also indicate that the direct exposition of the father to large amounts of 
pesticides is linked to a greater risk of fetal death, effect that is larger if the exposition took 
place within a three months period preceding conception. Cases of anencephaly associated 
with direct exposition of the mother to pesticides during the preconception period (between 
the 3 months previous to the conception and the third month of pregnancy) have also been 
reported in the medical literature. Furthermore, the study developed by Sanborn et al. 
(2004) establishes that the exposition to the spraying of herbicides is associated with 
problems of fecundity and lower levels of sperm concentration. 
Finally, the studies by Sanborn et al. (2004) and Sanborn et al. (2007) find (minor) 
evidence of the negative effect of exposure to glyphosate on the levels of depression, 
anxiety, neural disorders, minor tact sensibility, abnormal reflexes and psychomotor 
dysfunction. As to neurodegenerative diseases, they find evidence of a connection between 
the exposure to pesticides at work and Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases later in life. 
The contribution of our paper to the literature relies on the strong emphasis that we place 
on the empirical strategy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to take the 
potential endogeneity problem seriously when estimating the effect of aerial spraying of 
herbicides of illicit crops on health outcomes. While our results corroborate some of the 
results in the medical literature (e.g., the negative effects of exposure to glyphosate on 
dermatological problems and abortions), other negative effects, such as respiratory 
problems, are not found to be statistically significant in our estimations.

3. Data 
3.1. RIPS database of medical consultations, emergency room visits and 
hospitalizations (2003 - 2007) 
The Individual Register of Health Services Provision (RIPS, as per the acronym in Spanish) 
contains the individual-level registers of medical consultations, Emergency Room (ER) 
visits, hospitalizations and procedures that took place in any health service institution in 
Colombia between 2003 and 2007. Each registry contains information about the 
appointment (date, municipality, diagnosis according to the ICD-10, institution that treated 
the patient and consultation fee) and about the patient (age, gender and type of health 
insurance). It is important to note that we do not have information or can infer anything 
about individuals that do not go to the doctor during the 5 years that correspond to our 
period of study and thus are not registered in the RIPS database.  
Based on the medical literature summarized above, we construct three groups of 
diagnostics potentially related to aerial spraying7: dermatologic, respiratory, and abortions. 
These three broad categories will be the main focus of our analysis. Each group collects a 
variety of diagnoses that were selected using the ICD-10 codes and in accordance with the 
medical literature findings. Table A1 includes a list of the diagnoses used in the 
estimations, as well as the proportion that each of them represents in the total number of 
events in our panel.  
The upper panel from Table 1 and 2 shows descriptive statistics for the dependent variables 
in our dataset: dermatologic and respiratory medical consultations and abortions, 
respectively. More precisely, we create a dummy variable that equals 1 if the person 
appears in our panel with a glyphosate-related diagnosis, and 0 if the person appears in the 
panel with some other diagnosis.  As shown in Table 1, dermatological and respiratory 
consultations related to aerial spraying correspond to approximately 2% and 5% of all 
reported diagnosis, respectively.   
                                                            
7 We concentrate on health outcomes that appear in the short run (e.g., a few days or months after the 
exposition to herbicides). Other health-related problems that take more time to develop are left, for now, out 
of our analysis. 
 7 
 
With respect to abortions, these are severely underreported in our panel. As a result, we 
construct an abortion variable using information from prenatal care visits and 
hospitalizations related to births form the RIPS dataset. We assume that an abortion 
occurred if we see a mother attending a prenatal care visit, but we do not find a birth 
registered in the hospitalization sample later on. According to our measure, the average 
abortion rate is approximately 7%, which is high compared to Latin American standards 
(4% on average)). Although this is not a direct count of the real number of abortions, the 
correlation between our constructed measure of abortions and reported abortions at the 
municipal level is above 0.9. However, we should stress that our proposed measure does 
not take into account births that take place in locations different from hospitals, clinics and 
other formal medical institutions. Also, our measure assumes that all births are reported.  
 
Other considerations regarding the cleaning process of our data are important to take into 
account. Appendix B includes a thorough description of the cleaning process, checks its 
representativeness and corrects for possible reporting mistakes. 
 
3.2. Aerial spraying and manual eradication data 
We have very detailed information on each event of aerial spraying of illicit crops and 
manual eradication campaigns for our study period. The data on spraying campaigns is 
recorded by geo-coding devices that are built-in in the aircrafts used for the aerial spraying 
campaigns. The information on the location (municipality) and number of hectares sprayed 
is recorded during the flight and then collected by the authorities when the plane lands. This 
information was obtained from the Anti-Narcotics Police, a special unit inside the 
Colombian National Police, which is in charge of designing and implementing most of the 
strategies used in the fight against illegal drug production and trafficking in the country. 
These records include the exact date and time of the spraying event, the municipality of 
occurrence, the number of hectares sprayed and the type of illicit crop sprayed (coca, 
marijuana or opium poppy). Manual eradication campaigns are recorded (also with geo-
coded devices) by the authorities in charge of implementing them (Grupos Móviles de 
 8 
 
Erradicación – Mobile Eradication groups). The data also includes the date of the event, 
the location (municipality), the number of hectares manually eradicated and the type of 
illicit crop.  
 
3.3. Municipal controls 
 
In all our estimations we control for a broad range of variables at the municipal level. These 
controls come from a municipal panel constructed by CEDE (Research Center on 
Economic and Development Studies of Universidad de los Andes), which provides 
information on economic, geographical and social characteristics at the municipal level in 
Colombia. Some of the variables that we control for include: population, tax revenues and 
Central Government expenditures on health. The inclusion of these variables in our 
estimations is important because they can affect health outcomes, and thus omitting them 
may lead to biased estimates of our coefficients of interest. We also control for other types 
of anti-narcotics policies, such as the detection and dismantling of cocaine processing 
facilities and the seizures of chemical precursors used in the production of cocaine. This 
information is also provided by the Colombian Anti-Narcotics Police.  
It is worth noting that all our estimations control for the size of coca cultivation present in 
the municipality. If coca cultivation and aerial spraying are positively correlated (as it is 
indeed the case), controlling for the level of coca cultivation is important to prevent the 
estimation of our coefficient of interest from being biased.  
 
4. Health production function and empirical specification   
The general health production function in the economics literature was first introduced by 
Grossman (1972).  Under this approach, health is assumed to be a function of several 
factors. The first one is the baseline health status of the individual, which corresponds to 
genetic factors. The second factor is leisure, understood as time spent on activities that 
improve health conditions such as exercising, cooking and sleeping, among others. The 
third factor is medical care. This factor corresponds to goods and services that individuals 
 9 
 
can purchase in order to improve their health, for example good quality of doctors, 
hospitals, medicines, vaccines and healthy food.  
While it is extremely difficult to measure the baseline health status, we deal with it by 
exploiting the panel structure of our data and using individual fixed effects in our 
estimations. Fixed effects account for all individual characteristics that do not change over 
the period of our study (e.g., genetics, previous investments, health conditions, health care 
when young, etc.).  This empirical strategy represents an advantage in comparison to cross 
sectional studies that compare unrelated individuals for whom these factors cannot be 
accounted for. 
Instead of trying to estimate a structural form of the health production function, we estimate 
a reduced form of the following health production function:

Where the subscript i refers to the individual, m to the municipality, and t to the time 
period.  h is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if individual i appears in the panel 
in municipality m and at time t suffering from a glyphosate-related diagnosis and 0 if it 
appears in the panel for any other diagnose.  Y are goods that can affect health; l correspond 
to  health inputs that require time; u is an individual health endowment; and s an 
environmental shock that, in our case,  corresponds to the event of being exposed to aerial 
spraying in the municipality of residence. 
For this setup to be understood as a quasi-experiment, or, in other words, for aerial spraying 
to be exogenous, we need to assume orthogonality between s, the environmental shock, and 
the error term. In this case, we are assuming that individuals cannot anticipate with 
certainty the time and extent of the spraying campaigns. By controlling for characteristics at 
the municipal level and using municipality or individual fixed effects, there should be very 
few concerns about the systematic variation between violence and other characteristics that 
will bias the estimations of our coefficients of interest.   
 10 
 
The reduced form linear relation of our preferred specification of the health production 
function will be the following linear probability model:

certain period of time8 previous to a medical consultation that takes place at time t.

are  individual and municipal controls that vary over time, respectively. Among the 
individual controls we include age, age square and type of health insurance. Similarly, we 
include municipal level controls, including population, area of the municipality, per capita 
tax revenues, per capita public expenditures on health services, proportion of municipal 
area cultivated with coca crops9, and a measure of the average area (in square Kilometers) 
of illicit crops that were manually eradicated during a certain period of time preceding the 
medical consultation. Including coca cultivation and manual eradication as controls is 
important in order to prevent our coefficient of interest from being biased. The high 
correlation between the extent of aerial spraying and coca cultivation at the municipal level 
(together with the fact that coca cultivation and cocaine production make indiscriminate use 
of pesticides, herbicides and chemical precursors) may create a spurious relationship 
between spraying campaigns and health outcomes if we didn’t control for it in our 
estimations. We also include year,
year

 , dummies to control for 
unobservable factors changing over time, such as seasonal patterns of diseases. 
i
  are fixed 
effects that control for all unobservable factors varying across individuals that are constant 
over time.  The individual fixed effect model in equation (3) is our preferred specification. 
This specification compares the health outcomes for a given individual when exposed to 
different levels of aerial spraying at different points in time. As explained before, this 
identification strategy improves over cross sectional studies that include municipality fixed 
                                                            
 
9 Total coca cultivation in Colombia is measured every year in December (UNOCD and Government of 
Colombia, 2011). Therefore, we calculate the proportion of municipal area cultivated with coca as the average 
of the current and previous year cultivation, which would correspond to the initial and final measure of area 
cultivated for the year of study.

 is an error term assumed to be orthogonal to the probability of suffering 
from a glyphosate-related diagnosis h.  
We restrict the time window between an aerial spraying event and a medical consultation to 
a given number of days10 in our baseline estimations. We also use an alternative way of 
measuring aerial spraying: instead of using the number of hectares sprayed in the 
municipality of residence 15 days prior to the medical consultation, we use a dummy that 
takes the value of one if there was a spraying event during the same time window. For 
dermatological and respiratory diagnoses we use a time window between the spraying event 
and the medical consultation of 15 days. In the case of abortions, we use eight (8) months 
prior to the last prenatal care visit. The reason for using this time window for the case of 
abortions is that the medical literature has found that the effect of aerial spraying on 
abortions can start up to three (3) months prior to conception and a loss is consider an 
abortion during the first five (5) months of pregnancy. 
5. Results 
We use three different dependent variables corresponding to medical diagnoses that have 
been identified in the medical literature to be related to the exposure to glyphosate in the 
short run. Tables 3, 4, and 5 present our baseline estimations of equation (2) for 
dermatological diagnoses, respiratory diagnoses, and abortions. All tables include six 
columns. Columns 1, 3 and 5 include year fixed effects, individual and municipal controls; 
columns 2, 4 and 6 include the controls from the previous columns plus individual fixed 
effects. 
Table 3 reports the results for dermatological diagnoses. The first column in this table 
shows that, on average, a one square kilometer increase in the area sprayed with glyphosate 
increases by 0.7 percentage points the probability of having a dermatological problem 
during the following 15 days. Once individual fixed effects are included in this same 
                                                            
10 The time window chosen is consistent with previous finding on the medical literature.   
 12 
 
regression, we find that the effect is reduced to 0.2 percentage points.  The difference in the 
coefficients with these two sets of controls shows the relevance of including individual 
fixed effects, which capture heterogeneity among baseline health, behavior, and 
unobservable inputs that vary from person to person.  
Columns 3 and 4 include a control for the proportion of the municipality area cultivated 
with coca. This control is very important since coca cultivation involves the use of 
pesticides and chemical precursors to transform coca leaf into coca base and cocaine, which 
may also have negative effects on individual´s health. Columns 5 and 6 include manual 
eradication and show a negative and significant effect of the area of manual eradication on 
the probability of suffering from a dermatological problem. The magnitudes of the result 
described above for our variable of interest, area under aerial spraying, are robust to 
controlling for area cultivated with coca and area under manual eradication. 
In order to check the robustness of our results, we consider a window of 30 days prior to 
the dermatological consultation. This window is longer than the time frame, of 15 days, that 
the medical literature has pointed out as the period when negative dermatological effects 
are detected due to the exposure to glyphosate. As expected, using this 30 day window 
there is no significant effect of aerial spraying over dermatological diagnoses.11 
Table 4 reports results for respiratory diagnoses detected within a time frame of 15 days 
after the exposure to an aerial spraying event in the municipality of residence. Although the 
medical literature has argued that exposure to glyphosate causes respiratory problems, we 
do not find any evidence of this effect in our estimations.  This result is robust to the 
inclusion of different controls, including the extent of coca cultivation in the municipality 
of residence and individual fixed effects.  
Regarding abortions, our results, presented in Table 5, show that exposure to glyphosate 
between the three (3) months before conception and the five (5) months after conception, 
has a positive and significant impact on the probability of occurrence of an abortion.  As 
mentioned before, our measure of abortions might be overestimated.  For this reason we 
                                                            
11 Results are not reported, but are available upon request.

focus on the standardized coefficients of these regressions. The results from our preferred 
specification, including individual fixed effects, indicate that an increase of one standard 
deviation in the area sprayed in the municipality of residence increases the probability of 
an abortion by about 0.025 of a standard deviation.  
6. Placebo tests 
In an effort to evaluate the validity of our results, we estimate the baseline equation (2) for 
diagnoses that, in principle, is completely unrelated to spraying campaigns or coca 
cultivation, namely bone fractures. As shown in Table 6, the coefficients on spraying 
campaigns, coca cultivation and manual eradication are never statistically significant. This 
indicates that the results previously obtained do not seem to be spurious.

Non registered abortion, identified according the prenatal consultations (we 
identify an abortion if the mother assists to a prenatal control, but the 
difference between this prenatal control and the previous is more than 10 
months).  
 
Notes: Codes reported until the second digit include all the successive 3-digit diagnosis. Codes 
reported until the third digit in the tables were included individually.

 Cleaning the RIPS database  
Table 7 reports the initial distribution of the observations in the database of 
hospitalization, emergency room and doctor visits for each year of the panel. There are 85 
million observations for the period 2003-2007.

We now describe the five criteria used to clean the database.  
1. Eliminate  inconsistency by gender: The person appears several times in the 
panel (with the same id), but his/her gender is not consistent over time.  
2. Eliminate  inconsistency in age: The person appears several times in the panel 
(with the same id), but there are inconsistent age gaps from one year to the next 
or between years.  
3. Flag and Eliminate individuals who appear frequently in the database and do not 
seem to suffer from a chronic disease: We identify individuals that appear more 
than 40 times in the panel, but less than half of all visits correspond to the same 
diagnose. ). 
4. Eliminate by invalid year or type of regime: The observations belong to a year 
that is not covered by the panel (which goes from 2003 to 2007) or the 
observations belong to a non-valid type of regime (valid types of regime are: 1-
contributive, 2-subsidized, 3-uninsured, 4-particular, 5-other, 6-displaced).

5. Eliminate observations which have an invalid municipal or state code. Given that 
we would not be able to link this observation with the level aerial spraying, 
eradication or coca cultivation.  
 
Table 7 reports the number of observations resulting after each stage of the cleaning 
process for each year in the panel, as well as the changes in the total number of 
observations in each stage. After cleaning the data we end with 75 million observations.
