This article has an accompanying continuing medical education activity, also eligible for MOC credit, on page e88. Learning Objective–Upon
completion of this activity, successful learners should be able to summarize the results of a meta-analysis investigating the efficacy of psychological
therapies for improving gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome.
BACKGROUND & AIMS:
Several meta-analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of psychological therapies for reducing
gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, no
meta-analysis has investigated the duration of these effects. We performed a meta-analysis to
assess the immediate, short-term, and long-term efficacy of psychotherapy for reducing GI
symptoms in adults with IBS.
METHODS:
We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Science Direct, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
through August 15, 2015 for randomized controlled trials that compared psychological therapy
with an active or non-active comparison (control) condition for treatment of GI symptoms in
adults with IBS.
RESULTS:
Forty-one trials were included in our meta-analysis, comprising data from 2290 individ-
uals (1183 assigned to psychotherapy and 1107 assigned to a control condition). Compared
with a mixed group of control conditions, psychological therapies had a medium effect on
GI symptom severity (d [ 0.69) immediately after treatment. On average, individuals
who received psychotherapy had a greater reduction in GI symptoms after treatment than 75%
of individuals assigned to a control condition. After short-term follow-up periods (1–6 months
after treatment) and long-term follow-up periods (6–12 months after treatment), this effect
remained significant and medium in magnitude (d [ 0.76 and d [ 0.73, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS:
Psychological therapies reduce GI symptoms in adults with IBS. These effects remained
significant and medium in magnitude after short-term and long-term follow-up periods.
Keywords: Abdominal Pain; Empirically Supported Therapies; Evidence-based Treatment; Functional Gastrointestinal
Disorder.
I
rritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional
gastrointestinal (GI) disorder that affects 7%–16%
of the population in the United States.1 IBS is a serious
public health concern, with estimates of annual direct
costs in the United States ranging from $950 million to
$1.35 billion and productivity costs ranging from $58 to
$205 million.2,3 Quality of life in individuals with IBS is
poor, particularly in the population seeking healthcare,
where its influence is comparable to that of ischemic
heart disease, heart failure, and diabetes.4
Meta-analyses suggest that psychological therapies
are as effective as antidepressants in reducing GI
symptoms in IBS immediately after treatment, with a
number needed to treat between 2 and 4.5–7 Whether
psychotherapy produces long-lasting changes in GI

 symptom severity is unknown. The aims of this review
were to (1) update previous reviews, (2) expand on
previous reviews by examining the longevity of these
effects, and (3) investigate whether efficacy is moderated
by type of psychological therapy and/or characteristics
of the trial.
Methods
This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with
the PRISMA statement and followed an a priori estab-
lished protocol. This study was exempt from ethical
approval because analyses involved only de-identified
data, and all studies had received local human subject
protection approval.
Search Strategy
We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and
ProQuest Dissertations and Theses through August 15,
2015. Details are available in Supplementary Appendix 1.
Selection Criteria
Included studies met the following criteria: (1) ran-
domized controlled trial (RCT), (2) evaluated a psycho-
logical intervention, (3) participants were individuals
with IBS aged 18 years or older, (4) GI symptoms were
assessed before and after treatment by using a contin-
uous measure, and (5) written in English. To be as
conservative and consistent in the application of our
eligibility criteria as possible, trials that used quasi-
randomized
methods
of
allocation
(eg,
assignment
based on order of entry into the trial or social security
number) were excluded to the extent that this could be
determined.8–12 Cluster randomization was considered
acceptable for trials evaluating group therapies. No
restrictions were placed on trial size, publication type, or
follow-up interval. We included approaches grounded in
a mind-body conceptual framework, including relaxation
training, biofeedback, and yoga, which can be conceptu-
alized as mindful movement.13 Studies in which the only
psychological intervention was a support group were
ineligible because numerous studies used such condi-
tions as controls.
Control conditions were supportive therapy, educa-
tion, sham treatments (for biofeedback and hypnosis),
online discussion forums, enhanced medical care (med-
ical care not received by the intervention group), treat-
ment as usual (TAU), symptom monitoring, and wait-list
controls. Enhanced medical care was only considered a
control if no specific antidepressant was administered to
all participants. Studies in which the only comparison
was to another psychotherapy were excluded.
Dichotomous
outcome
measures
were
ineligible
because these were assumed to measure a different
underlying construct than continuous measures. This
resulted in 1 trial being excluded.14 Authors were con-
tacted when studies provided insufficient data for effect
size computation and when selective reporting was
suspected. For studies including both eligible and ineli-
gible participants, data were requested for those partic-
ipants meeting our inclusion criteria. Details of our
screening
and
coding
procedures
are
provided
in
Supplementary Appendix 2.
Outcome Assessment
Outcomes (in order of preference, based on avail-
ability) were (1) GI symptom severity, (2) abdominal
pain, and (3) GI dysfunction (constipation and diarrhea).
When a trial reported an outcome by using multiple
measures, data were extracted for the more frequently
used measure. The GI Symptom Diary15 was the most
commonly used measure. Composite diary data reported
by using the Composite Primary Symptom Reduction
(CPSR) could not be combined with effect sizes from
other studies because this method standardizes change
scores by the pretreatment mean as opposed to the
change score standard deviation. When no alternative
composite score was available, we used abdominal pain
as our outcome. Three CPSR studies did not report
outcome data in any other format and were therefore
excluded.16–18 Self-reported outcomes were used in all
trials
except
one,
which
only
provided
physician-
reported data.19
Data Extraction
Data were extracted as intent-to-treat (ITT) (ie,
analyzed as randomized by using all available follow-up
data) when possible. Data were extracted with imputa-
tion of missing data when possible, if the method was
appropriate (ie, multiple imputation, full information
maximum likelihood, expectation maximization, or last
observation carried forward).
The
following
intervention
characteristics
were
coded: (1) therapy type, (2) delivery method (online, in-
person, telephone, or self-help), (3) format (group, indi-
vidual), and (4) dose (number of in-person sessions,
average session duration, therapy duration in weeks, and
session frequency). Control groups were classified as
either active or non-active. Active controls included
supportive therapy, online discussion forums, education,
sham treatments, enhanced medical care, and TAU. Non-
active controls included wait-list or symptom moni-
toring. Controls containing both active and non-active
components were coded as active.20,21
Assessment of Risk of Bias
The risk of bias assessment tool developed by the
Cochrane Collaboration22 for RCTs was used to assess
the following possible sources of bias in included
938

Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 14, No. 7
 trials: (1) adequate generation of allocation sequence,
(2) concealment of allocation to conditions, (3) blinding
of participants and personnel, (4) handling of incomplete
outcome data, and (5) selective outcome reporting. The
tool allows for high, low, and unclear risk of bias ratings.
Supplementary Appendix 3 describes our criteria for
assessing risk of bias.
Data Synthesis and Statistical Analysis
Standardized
mean
differences
(SMDs)
were
computed as a measure of effect size. The SMD is
computed from the difference between the 2 groups’
mean change scores divided by their pooled standard
deviation. (The variance of this effect size requires
information on the pretest-posttest correlation, which
was rarely reported by study authors. We therefore
calculated the average of all provided pretest-posttest
correlations
and
used
this
value
(0.74)
when
no
pretest-posttest correlation was provided.)
To calculate pooled mean effect sizes, we used
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (version 3.3.070). Effect
sizes were weighted by the inverse of their variances. We
followed
recommendations
to
use
random
effects
weights when measures vary across trials.23 In addition
to the SMD, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calcu-
lated; CIs not including 0 were considered statistically
significant. Effect size magnitude was interpreted by
using the guidelines of Cohen24 for SMDs of 0.2–0.3, 0.5,
and 0.8 as representing small, medium, and large effect
sizes, respectively.
Eight trials had 2 psychological treatments that were
compared with the same control condition. To avoid
statistical
dependencies
in
the
data,
we
included
outcome data for only the treatment arm hypothesized
by the trial authors to be more “potent” in any given
analysis. When a trial had more than 1 control arm, we
included outcome data for only the less active control (to
facilitate comparisons to prior meta-analyses where
most trials had non-active control arms7).
We tested whether there were true differences
underlying the variability in effect sizes between studies
(heterogeneity) or whether variability was due to chance
(homogeneity).23 To assess homogeneity, we calculated
the
Q
statistic
(a
measure
of
weighted
squared
deviations). A significant Q rejects the null hypothesis of
homogeneity and indicates that the observed variability
in effect sizes is unlikely to be due to subject-level
sampling error alone. We also calculated the between-
studies variance (s2) and the ratio of true heterogene-
ity to total observed variation (I2).
Results
Of the 1162 records identified through our search, 41
unique trials19,25–62 were determined eligible for our
meta-analysis. A study flow diagram is presented in
Figure 1; a summary of all included trials is presented in
Table 1. Most reports included only 1 trial, but 2 reports
presented data on 2 studies and are therefore reported
in 2 rows. Trials containing multiple eligible intervention
groups also span multiple rows. Of the 41 trials, 20 had
not been included in the most recent meta-analysis
evaluating the efficacy of psychological therapies on GI
symptoms.
Risk of Bias
Table 2 presents the risk of bias ratings. The numbers
of trials meeting criteria for low risk of bias that was due
to (1) allocation sequence, (2) concealment of allocation
sequence, (3) blinding, (4) incomplete outcome data,
and (5) selective reporting were 21, 16, 1, 22, and 34,
respectively.
Main Effects
Immediate
post-treatment
assessment. Thirty-nine
trials reported continuous data for GI symptom severity
immediately after treatment, defined as the first assess-
ment less than 1 month after treatment. Mean effects of
psychotherapy on GI symptoms compared with a mixed
group of control conditions at first post-treatment
follow-up are shown in Figure 2. Positive effect sizes
indicate greater average improvement of the treatment
group compared with the control group.
Compared with a mixed group of (active and non-
active) control conditions, psychological therapies were
effective at improving GI symptoms (d ¼ 0.69, P < .001;
95% CI, 0.52–0.86; Q ¼ 129.07, P < .001, s2 ¼ 0.19,
I2 ¼ 70.56) immediately after treatment. According to
the criteria of Cohen,24 this effect is medium-sized.
Impact of Bias
There was no evidence of significant publication bias
at the first post-treatment follow-up, as indicated by the
Egger test (b ¼ 0.57, P ¼ .583) and the rank correlation
test (s ¼ 0.09, P ¼ .439). Funnel plots of main effects at
all follow-up intervals are provided in Supplementary
Figures 1–3.
In a series of pre-specified analyses, we investigated
whether the risk of bias ratings were associated with
effects of psychotherapy on GI symptoms. There was no
statistically significant effect of risk of bias for the
domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment,
blinding, or selective reporting. There was a significant
effect of risk of bias in the domain of attrition (Q ¼ 13.15,
P ¼ .001). Specifically, effect sizes were significantly
smaller
among
the
5
studies
rated
as
high
risk
(d ¼ –0.03, P ¼ .875; 95% CI, –0.44 to 0.37) compared
with unclear (d ¼ 0.83, P < .001; 95% CI, 0.57–1.09;
Q ¼ 12.32, P < .001) or low (d ¼ 0.73, P < .001; 95% CI,
0.49–0.96; Q ¼ 10.15, P ¼ .001) risk of bias. There was

 no significant difference in effect sizes between studies
rated as having an unclear vs low risk of bias (Q ¼ 0.33,
P ¼ .564).
Short-term Follow-up
Fourteen
trials
provided
data
for
GI
symptom
severity at short-term follow-up, defined as at least 1
month but less than 6 months after treatment. There was
a medium effect of psychotherapy on GI symptoms at
short-term follow-up compared with mixed control
conditions (d ¼ 0.76, P < .001; 95% CI, 0.54–0.97;
Q ¼ 31.43, P ¼ .003, s2 ¼ .10, I 2¼ 58.63). There was no
evidence of significant publication bias at this time point,
as indicated by the Egger test (b ¼ 0.53, P ¼ .867) and
the rank correlation test (s < 0.001, P ¼ 1.000).
Long-term Follow-up
Ten trials provided data for GI symptom severity at
long-term follow-up, defined as 6 months to 1 year after
treatment. There was a medium-sized effect of psycho-
therapy
on
GI
symptoms
at
long-term
follow-up
(d ¼ 0.73, P < .001; 95% CI, 0.43–1.03; Q ¼ 35.80,
P < .001, s2 ¼ 0.17, I2 ¼ 74.86). There was no evidence
of significant publication bias at this time point, as
indicated by the Egger test (b ¼ 5.09, P ¼ .193) and the
rank correlation test (s < 0.18, P ¼ .474).
Sensitivity Analyses
To investigate how the effect of psychotherapy on GI
symptoms changes over time within an individual trial, we
re-computed effect sizes for the post-treatment time point
by using data from only the 13 studies that also provided
short-term follow-up data and re-computed effect sizes
for short-term follow-up by using data from only the 6
studies that also provided long-term follow-up data.
Effect size immediately after treatment vs short-term
follow-up (13 trials). Immediately after treatment, the
average effect size of the 13 studies that also included
short-term follow-up was d ¼ 0.63, P < 0.001; 95% CI,
0.39–0.86; Q ¼ 35.42, P < .001, s2 ¼ 0.12, I2 ¼ 66.12.
At short-term follow-up, the average effect size of these
13 studies was d ¼ 0.75, P < .001; 95% CI, 0.52–0.98;
Q ¼ 31.22, P ¼ .002, s2 ¼ 0.11, I2 ¼ 61.56.

Meta-analysis of Psychological Therapies for IBS
941
 Effect size at short-term vs long-term follow-up (6 tri-
als). At short-term follow-up, the average effect size of
the 6 studies that also included long-term follow-up
was d ¼ 0.78, P < .001; 95% CI, 0.58–0.98; Q ¼ 1.35,
P ¼ .930, s2 < 0.001, I2 < 0.001. At long-term follow-up,
the average effect size of the 6 studies that also included
short-term follow-up was d ¼ 0.67, P < .001; 95% CI,
0.44–0.91; Q ¼ 6.48, P ¼ .262, s2 ¼ 0.02, I2 ¼ 22.84.
We further investigated the effect of follow-up inter-
val on effect size by limiting our analyses to the 5 studies
providing outcome data for all 3 follow-up intervals. The
average effect of these studies was d ¼ 0.54, P ¼ .001;
95%
CI,
0.24–0.84
immediately
after
treatment,
d ¼ 0.76, P < .001; 95% CI, 0.54–0.98 at short-term
follow-up, and d ¼ 0.73, P < .001; 95% CI, 0.50–0.97
at long-term follow-up (Figure 3).
In a series of pre-specified analyses, we investigated
several intervention and trial characteristics as potential
moderators of the effect of psychotherapy on GI symptoms
immediately after treatment: modality, delivery method,
format, dose, control type, country, and publication date.
Therapeutic
modality. Cognitive
and
cognitive-
behavioral therapies were evaluated in the largest
number of trials (20 trials), followed by relaxation
(6 trials) and hypnosis (5 trials). These 3 modalities had
similar effect sizes (cognitive: d ¼ 0.73, P < .001; 95%
CI, 0.48–0.97; hypnosis: d ¼ 0.78, P < .001; 95% CI,
0.46–1.11; relaxation: d ¼ 0.72, P ¼ .050; 95% CI,
0.00–1.43; Q ¼ 0.08, P ¼ .960).
Delivery
method. Three
studies
investigated
in-
terventions administered online (with an online thera-
pist). There was no statistically significant difference
between the effect sizes of interventions delivered
online (d ¼ 1.33, P ¼ .006; 95% CI, 0.38–2.27) vs
in-person ðd ¼ 0.64, P < .001; 95% CI, 0.47–0.80;
Q ¼ 1.98, P ¼ .160).
Format. Within therapies administered in person,
there was no significant difference in the effect of in-
terventions administered in a group (d ¼ 0.56, P ¼ .004;
95% CI, 0.18–0.94) vs individual format (d ¼ 0.66,
P < .001; 95% CI, 0.47–0.84; Q ¼ 0.19, P ¼ .666).
Dose. We tested whether the “dose” of talk therapy
sessions (including in-person or telephone sessions) was
associated with larger effect sizes. Self-help and online
therapies were excluded from these analyses. Number of
sessions (b ¼ –0.02, P ¼ .527), average session duration
(b < 0.01, P ¼ .491), therapy duration (b ¼ 0.01,
P ¼ .886), and session frequency (b ¼ –0.04, P ¼.887)
were not significantly correlated with effect size.
Type of control. Effect sizes were similar for trials
that used an active ðd ¼ 0.66, P < .001; 95% CI,
0.42–0.90) vs non-active control (d ¼ 0.68, P < .001;
95% CI, 0.48–0.87) (Q ¼ 0.01, P ¼ .929).
Country. Studies were most frequently conducted in

Discussion
Our work updates previous meta-analyses on the
effectiveness of psychological therapies for improving
GI symptoms in adults with IBS5,7 and provides a meta-
analysis of the longevity of these effects. Determining the
longevity of treatment benefits is especially important in
IBS because of the recurrent, intractable nature of this
disorder.63 The current study further extends previous
work5 by including continuous outcome data and trials
with less than a 7-day post-treatment follow-up. We also
tested whether treatment characteristics (therapeutic
modality, delivery method, format, and dose) and trial
characteristics significantly moderated effect sizes.
As a whole, psychological interventions included
in this meta-analysis were found to significantly re-
duce GI symptoms in adults with IBS. This effect was

 medium-sized at first post-treatment assessment and
was maintained at both short-term and long-term follow-
up. This remained true when using data only from
studies with more than 1 follow-up, suggesting that the
effect of psychotherapy on GI symptoms does not
decrease during the course of a 6-month to 12-month
follow-up interval. In the 5 studies that provided data at
all 3 follow-up intervals, effects were actually greater
at short-term (d ¼
0.76) and long-term follow-up
(d ¼ 0.73) compared with immediately after treatment
(d ¼ 0.54). The average effect on GI symptoms after
treatment (d ¼ 0.69) in our analysis was similar to that
reported previously for bowel dysfunction (d ¼ 0.57)
and considerably higher than that reported previously
for abdominal pain (d ¼ 0.27) in the only previously
published meta-analysis on this topic using continuous
outcomes.7 Transforming our post-treatment effect size
to the U3 Index of Smith and Glass64 indicated that the
average individual assigned to psychotherapy experi-
enced a greater decrease in GI symptoms than 75% of
individuals assigned to a control condition.
Cognitive, relaxation, and hypnosis therapies were
the most commonly tested treatment modalities within
our eligible sample of trials. The results suggest these 3
therapies may be equally effective at improving GI
symptoms.
However,
the
majority
of studies
used
interventions that combined several different treatment
modalities, making it difficult to sort studies into discrete
categories. Thus, this result should be interpreted with
caution.
Meta-regression revealed no significant effect of
number of therapy sessions, average duration of ses-
sions, duration of therapy, or frequency of sessions on
effect size. These results are comparable to findings from
a recent meta-analysis of the efficacy of psychotherapy
for depression,65 in which number of treatment sessions
was not significantly associated with effect size after
controlling for other relevant study variables.
We also observed no significant effect of delivery
method (in-person vs online) on effect sizes. This
could be good news for efforts to enhance dissemina-
tion of treatment; however, this result should be
interpreted with caution, because only 3 online ther-
apy trials were included. We found no significant
effect of therapy format (group vs individual) on effect
size. Thus, group format may be an effective and

 economical method of delivering psychological thera-
pies to adults with IBS.
Three trials provided effect sizes indicating greater
improvement in the control group.56,57,59 In 2 of these
trials, the treatment group improved more than the
control group on a dichotomous outcome measure
identified by the authors as the primary outcome.57,59
The remaining trial56 used walking as a comparison
condition, which could arguably be conceptualized as an
active treatment rather than a control condition.
Our results were similar to a recently published meta-
analysis that used binary outcome data to compare the
efficacy of psychotherapy vs antidepressant medications
for reducing GI symptoms in IBS. These authors esti-
mated the risk ratio of symptoms not improving with
psychotherapy compared with control as 0.68 (roughly
equivalent to an odds ratio of 0.34 and d of 0.60).5
Whether the effect of psychotherapy on GI symptoms
reduces long-term healthcare costs is unknown. One RCT
investigating this question found that mean annual direct
healthcare costs were significantly lower after 3 months
of psychotherapy, but not 3 months of paroxetine,
compared with TAU.32 Furthermore, a higher percentage
of individuals who received psychotherapy discontinued
their disability benefits during the course of the trial
(14.3%) compared with those who received paroxetine
(3.6%) or TAU (4.1%). These results are encouraging,
but only 3 trials included in our meta-analysis assessed
healthcare utilization as an outcome. Future research
should investigate the long-term impact of psychother-
apy on healthcare utilization and disability.
This
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis
used
rigorous methodology. Assessment of eligibility and data
extraction were each performed independently by 2
authors, and ITT data were used wherever possible.
Authors of potentially eligible trials were contacted to
obtain unreported data or to exclude ineligible partici-
pants. This inclusive approach provided data for 41
RCTs, which is more than any other meta-analysis on this
topic to date.
Several
limitations
should
be
considered
when
interpreting these findings, each of which arise from the
nature of the studies available for synthesis. First, there
was substantial between-trial variability in many trial
characteristics (eg, measures used, inclusion criteria,
control conditions). In the future, keeping such variables
as consistent as possible across studies will allow for
more precise effect size estimates. Effects may also vary
according to individual patient characteristics. Unfortu-
nately, this was impossible to assess in the current meta-
analysis because of inconsistent reporting and limited
diversity (participants were mostly female and mostly
white in trials that reported these data). With better
reporting, future meta-analyses will be able to investi-
gate this matter.
Another limitation is that no trial included in the
meta-analysis was rated as low risk of bias in every
domain. This was partially a result of the difficulty in
blinding participants in psychological trials. However,
even after excluding this domain, only 9 trials were rated
as low risk of bias in all remaining domains. Future
studies should follow the CONSORT guidelines for
reporting RCTs,66 use ITT designs, use active control
conditions to control for nonspecific treatment effects,
and assess treatment credibility and expectancy. Finally,
few studies collected short-term or long-term follow-up
data. Future studies should assess treatment outcomes at
short-term and long-term follow-up to determine the
duration of treatment effects.
Our finding that psychotherapy improves GI symp-
toms at short-term and long-term follow-up is particu-
larly noteworthy because of the typically recurrent,
persistent nature of IBS symptoms. Future research is
needed to compare the longevity of treatment effects for
psychotherapy vs pharmacologic therapies such as anti-
depressants. Although it is beyond the scope of this

 review, it is also important to consider the mechanisms
by which psychotherapies improve GI symptoms as well
as to determine the “active ingredients” responsible for
this effect. Careful dismantling studies and longitudinal
assessment of hypothesized mediators will facilitate the
development of even more effective treatments for
individuals with IBS.

Record Search Criteria
For PubMed, PsycINFO, and ScienceDirect searches,
the following terms were required to appear in the title
and/or the abstract of the record:
(IBS OR “irritable bowel syndrome” OR “irritable
bowel” OR “irritable colon” OR “spastic colon”) AND
(CBT OR “cognitive behavioral” OR “cognitive behav-
ioural” OR “psychological therapies” OR “psychological
therapy” OR mindful* OR meditat* OR (psychosocial
AND therapy) OR “cognitive therapy” OR “behavior
therapy” OR “behaviour therapy” OR psychotherapy OR
psychoeducational OR “psychological treatment” OR
counseling OR (acceptance AND therapy) OR “psycho-
logical intervention” OR “mental health intervention” OR
“expressive writing” OR hypnosis OR hypnot* OR “mind-
body” OR (intervention AND psychol*) OR psychody-
namic OR “applied behavior analysis” OR biofeedback
OR
“autogenic
training”
OR
“heart
rate”
OR
bio-
energetic* OR “support group” OR “group therapy” OR
autohypno* OR (emotion* AND express*) OR “T’ai Chi”
OR “Tai Chi” OR “Yoga” OR (writ* AND express*) OR
“relaxation therapy” OR “self-regulate” OR “self-regula-
tion” OR “regulate emotions” OR “emotion regulation”)
AND (random* OR “usual care” OR “treatment as usual”
OR control* OR comparison OR placebo OR “wait-list”
OR “wait list”).
For ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, the same
search criteria were used except that the term location
limit was set to “ALL” (ie, “anywhere except full text”)
because a “Title OR Abstract” limit was not available.
Six hundred eighty-four articles and 47 dissertations
were returned by using these criteria on January 14,
2014. Reference sections of 3 previous meta-analy-
ses10–12 were also searched. In addition, the most
recently published meta-analysis was forward-searched
to locate trials conducted since its publication. To up-
date this search, we conducted the same search again on
August 15, 2015; this time we restricted the search to
articles published in January 2014 or later. Ninety-nine
articles and 1 dissertation were returned by using
these criteria.
Supplementary Appendix 2. Screening
and Coding Procedures
The first author (K.T.L.) screened titles/abstracts for
relevance and evaluated all potentially relevant articles
in detail to determine eligibility. L.S.W. and S.D.H. were
consulted in unclear cases; disagreement was resolved
through discussion. Authors were aware of the names of
the study authors, results, and other publication infor-
mation. Effect size data were entered by the first author
(K.T.L.) and checked by another (A.C.R.). A single
reviewer (K.T.L.) coded all other variables.
Supplementary Appendix 3.
Coding of Risk of Bias
Ratings of unclear were given when there was
insufficient information to permit a judgment of “high” or
“low” risk.
Sequence Generation
Studies received either an unclear or low risk of bias
because of method of allocation sequence generation
because studies that used allocation methods that were
not purely random were excluded. Studies were judged
as having a low risk of bias in this domain if the authors
described a random component in the sequence gener-
ation process (such as use of a random number
generator).
Allocation Concealment
Studies were judged as having a low risk of bias
because of allocation concealment if participants and
investigators enrolling participants could not foresee
condition assignment (eg, because of use of sequentially
numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes).
Blinding
Because
of
the nature
of
psychotherapy,
it is
impossible for patients to be blinded to intervention
content. However, it is possible to limit the potential for
performance bias, attrition bias, and detection bias
because of this knowledge. For this reason, we adopted
the practice12,40 of using patient expectancies or credi-
bility as an indicator of risk of bias because of lack of
blinding. Studies with active control groups that blinded
participants to trial hypotheses were rated as having an
unclear risk of bias in this domain (“unclear”, as
opposed to “low” because of the possibility that study
staff may have inadvertently influenced participants to
believe that the psychological intervention was supe-
rior). Studies that used an active control group and
assessed treatment credibility or expectancies were
rated as having an unclear risk of bias because of lack of
blinding. (We interpreted an assessment of treatment
credibility as evidence that the authors attempted to
make their control treatment credible. Incidentally, all
of the studies assessing treatment credibility or expec-
tancies reported non-statistically significant differences
between their intervention and control group.) Only
studies that assessed treatment expectancies or credi-
bility after treatment and in which the treatment group
had equal (zero difference) or lower expectancies or
credibility than the control group received a rating of
low risk in this domain. We did not code risk of bias
because of lack of blinding of outcome assessors

 separately from bias because of blinding of participants
because, with one exception, all included data were self-
reported.36
Attrition
Studies providing ITT data and that had a participant
dropout rate of 20% or less at the first post-treatment
follow-up were coded as having a low risk of bias
because
of
handling
of
incomplete
outcome
data.
Studies that either had greater than 20% dropout or did
not provide ITT data (eg, no attempt to collect follow-up
data from individuals who dropped out of treatment)
were coded as having an unclear risk of bias in this
domain. Studies that had greater than 20% dropout and
did not provide ITT data were coded as high risk in this
domain.
Selective Reporting
Studies were rated as having a high risk of bias for
selective outcome reporting if they failed to report out-
comes that had been collected (as reported in the
methods section, on clinicaltrials.gov, or in the Clinical
Trial’s registry for the authors’ country). In cases of
suspected selective reporting, authors were contacted;
when authors provided all requested outcome data or
informed us that a particular measure had not been
collected at a particular time point, their score on risk of
selective reporting was changed from high to low.
