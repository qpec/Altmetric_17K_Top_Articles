O
ne in 10 patients with hip fracture die 
during their hospital stay.1–3 The risk of 
death is associated with patient, injury 
and treatment characteristics.4,5 Treatment setting 
may also influence this risk.1,2,6–8 For example, ad-
vanced standards of anesthesia and surgery are 
 
associated with teaching hospitals,9,10 but there is 
inconsistent evidence for an association between 
teaching status and in-hospital death.9,11–13 Com-
paring teaching hospitals with community hospi-
tals of different bed capacities may further our un-
derstanding of the risk of in-hospital death across 
treatment settings. Bed capacity is associated with 
factors of care delivery such as resources, treat-
ment styles and standby capacity.14
Most patients undergo surgery to repair hip 
fracture.15 However, between 6% and 10% of 
patients do not receive surgery, in some cases 
because of death while waiting for surgery.16,17 
To better understand the risk of in-hospital death 
by treatment setting, outcomes of both surgical 
and nonsurgical care should be considered. 
Therefore, we conducted this study to compare 
the risks of in-hospital death, overall and after 
surgery, between teaching hospitals and commu-
nity hospitals of various bed capacities providing 
hip fracture care in Canada.
Methods
Design, setting and population
We obtained all discharge abstracts with diagnosis 
codes for hip fracture (International Classification 
of Diseases, ninth revision, code 820; and Interna-
tional Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems, 10th revision, codes 
S72.00, S72.01, S72.09, S72.10, S72.19, S72.20) 
involving patients 65 years and older who were 
admitted to hospital with a nonpathological first 
hip fracture between Jan. 1, 2004, and Dec. 31, 
2012, in Canada (except for the province of Que-
bec) from the Canadian Institute for Health Infor-
mation (CIHI) Discharge Abstract Database.18 
Multiple abstracts with the same patient identifier 
were combined into a single care episode using 
the CIHI rules for hospital transfers.19,20

Research
Background: Where patients with hip fracture 
undergo treatment may influence their outcome. 
We compared the risk of in-hospital death after 
hip fracture by treatment setting in Canada.
Methods: We examined all discharge abstracts 
from the Canadian Institute for Health Informa-
tion with diagnosis codes for hip fracture 
involving patients 65 years and older who were 
admitted to hospital with a nonpathological 
first hip fracture between Jan. 1, 2004, and Dec. 
31, 2012, in Canada (excluding Quebec). We 
compared the risk of in-hospital death, overall 
and after surgery, between teaching hospitals 
and community hospitals of various bed capaci-
ties, accounting for variation in length of stay.
Results: Compared with the number of deaths 
per 1000 admissions at teaching hospitals, there 
were an additional 3 (95% confidence interval 
[CI] 1–6), 14 (95% CI 10–18) and 43 (95% CI 
35–51) deaths per 1000 admissions at large, 
medium and small community hospitals, respec-
tively. For the risk of in-hospital death overall, 
the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 1.05 (95% 
CI 0.99–1.11), 1.16 (95% CI 1.09–1.24) and 1.44 
(95% CI 1.31–1.57) at large, medium and small 
community hospitals, respectively, compared 
with teaching hospitals. For the risk of postsur-
gical death in hospital, the adjusted ORs were 
1.06 (95% CI 1.00–1.13), 1.13 (95% CI 1.04–1.23) 
and 1.18 (95% CI 0.87–1.60) at large, medium 
and small community hospitals, respectively.
Interpretation: Compared with teaching hos-
pitals, the risk of in-hospital death among 
patients with hip fracture was higher at 
medium and small community hospitals, and 
the risk of in-hospital death after surgery was 
higher at medium community hospitals. No 
differences were found between teaching and 
large community hospitals. Future research 
should examine the role of volume, demand 
and bed occupancy for observed differences.

CMAJ, December 6, 2016, 188(17–18) 
For estimating the risk of postsurgical death, we 
selected discharge abstracts with procedural codes 
for hip fracture surgery (Canadian Classification of 
Health Interventions codes 1VA74^^, 1VA53^^, 
1VC74^^ and 1SQ53^^; Canadian Classification of 
Diagnostic, Therapeutic and Surgical Procedures 
codes 9054, 9114, 9134, 9351, 9359, 9361, 9362, 
9363, 9364 and 9369), a valid surgery date and a 
hospital stay of at least 1 day after surgery. We 
considered deaths on the day of surgery as intraop-
erative, and live hospital discharge on the day of 
surgery as clinically unjustifiable.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was in-hospital death identi-
fied by destination code in the discharge abstracts. 
The time to death was calculated as the number of 
days from the date of admission (counting the 
admission day) to the date of death, hospital dis-
charge or 30 days, whichever came first. Postsurgi-
cal death referred to deaths on abstracts with a 
code for hip fracture surgery. The time to postsur-
gical death was calculated as the number of days 
from the date of surgery to the date of death, hos-
pital discharge or 30 days, whichever came first. In 
the analysis of deaths without surgery, we calcu-
lated the time to death as the number of days from 
the date of admission (counting the admission day) 
to the date of death, surgery, hospital discharge or 
30 days, whichever came first.
Treatment setting
We used the definitions of CIHI’s Canadian Hospi-
tal Reporting Project to classify treatment setting. 
Members of the Association of Canadian Aca-
demic Healthcare Organizations were classified as 
teaching hospitals; all other hospitals were commu-
nity hospitals, grouped by the number of beds: 
small (< 50 beds), medium (50–199) and large 
(≥ 200).21 Treatment setting at admission was a 
study variable in the analysis of in-hospital mortal-
ity, and treatment setting at surgery was a study 
variable in the analysis of postsurgical mortality.
Statistical analysis
We used the χ2 test to compare distributions of 
patient and care characteristics across treatment 
settings. We estimated daily rates of death over-
all and by treatment setting by dividing the num-
ber of corresponding events by the total number 
of inpatient days.
We estimated the cumulative incidence of 
death as a function of inpatient day, with live dis-
charge as a competing event, assuming patients 
were at risk of in-hospital death only while they 
remained in hospital.22 We identified live dis-
charges by the following destination codes: dis-
charged home, discharge to home with support, or 
transferred to long-term care, palliative care, hos-
pice or addiction treatment. We treated hospital 
stays that ended by transfer to acute care, dis-
charges on the day after surgery and stays that ex-
ceeded 30 days as right-censored observations.20 
In the analysis of deaths without surgery, surgery 
was an additional competing event. We used the 
Pepe–Mori 2-sample test22 and proportional odds 
regression models23 to test whether the cumulative 
incidences of death differed between teaching 
hospitals and community hospitals of various bed 
capacity. The differences were summarized by 
30-day risk differences and by odds ratios.24
In the regression analysis, the differences 
between treatment settings were adjusted for 
patient age, sex, fracture type, comorbidity 
(heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, acute ischemic heart disease, hyperten-
sion, diabetes),25,26 province or territory, and the 
calendar period (2004–2006, 2007–2009 or 
2010–2012), day (weekday v. weekend) and 
time of admission. We adjusted for type (inter-
nal fixation v. arthroplasty)27 and timing of sur-
gery in the analysis of postsurgical mortality. 
We conducted the competing-risk analysis 
using the pseudo-values method23 with R pack-
ages cmprsk,28 prodlim29 and geepack.30 The 
number of discharge abstracts was sufficient to 
detect a 1% increase in the risk of in-hospital 
death (from 7% to 8%), and in the risk of post-
surgical death (from 6% to 7%), with 90% 
power and a 2-sided significance level of 5%.

Results
Patient and care characteristics
A total of 168 340 patients were admitted with a 
nonpathological first hip fracture between Jan. 1, 
2004, and Dec. 31, 2012 (Figure 1). Most 
(72.9%) were women and almost half (45.9%) 
were 85 years or older. Fracture type was simi-
larly distributed between transcervical (51.8%) 
and trochanteric (48.2%) fractures. Overall, 
27.9% of the patients had major comorbidities, 
with cardiac dysrhythmia being the most preva-
lent (9.5%) (Table 1).
Overall, 58 799 (34.9%) of the patients were 
admitted to teaching hospitals, and 68 743 
(40.8%) were admitted to large, 29 684 (17.6%) 
to medium and 9343 (5.6%) to small community 
hospitals (Table 1); type of hospital was unknown 
for 1771 patients. More patients admitted to small 
community hospitals (71.2%) were transferred to 
another facility than were patients admitted to 
teaching (0.9%), large (1.0%) or medium (21.0%) 
community hospitals. Admissions between mid-
night and 0600 were more frequent at teaching 
hospitals (18.4%) than at large (12.8%), medium 
(10.1%) or small (9.5%) community hospitals. 
Weekend admissions were more frequent at 
teaching hospitals (28.1%) and large community 
hospitals (28.0%) than at medium (26.8%) or 
small (24.5%) community hospitals. More 
patients in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and New-
foundland and Labrador were admitted to teach-
ing hospitals than to large, medium or small com-
munity hospitals, compared with patients in other 
provinces and territories (Table 1).
More patients underwent arthroplasty at teach-
ing hospitals (38.6%) than at large (36.7%), 
medium (35.6%) or small (31.0%) community hos-
pitals. Of the 154 382 patients who underwent sur-
gery, more underwent surgery on admission day or 
the day after at large community hospitals (66.2%) 
than at teaching hospitals (58.6%) or at medium 
(65.0%) or small (35.6%) community hospitals. 
In-hospital mortality
By day 30 after admission, 11 672 (6.9%) hospital 
stays ended with death, 101 817 (60.5%) ended 
with live discharge, 26 994 (16.0%) had right-
censoring events, and 27 857 (16.6%) stays were 
longer than 30 days. The average rate of in-
hospital death was 4.7 (95% confidence interval 
[CI] 4.6–4.7) per 1000 patient-days overall, vary-
ing from 4.0 (95% CI 3.8–4.1) per 1000 patient-
days at teaching hospitals, to 4.8 (95% CI 4.6–4.9), 
5.5 (95% CI 5.3–5.8) and 6.3 (95% CI 5.8–6.7) 
per 1000 patient-days at large, medium and small 
community hospitals, respectively (Table 2). 
Compared with the number of deaths per 1000 
admissions at teaching hospitals, there were an 
additional 3 (95% CI 1–6), 14 (95% CI 10–18) 
and 43 (95% CI 35–51) deaths per 1000 admis-
sions at large, medium and small community

hospitals, respectively (Table 2, Figure 2). For 
the risk of in-hospital death overall, the adjusted 
odds ratios (ORs) were 1.05 (95% CI 0.99–1.11), 
1.16 (95% CI 1.09–1.24) and 1.44 (95% CI 1.31–
1.57) at large, medium and small community 
hospitals, respectively, compared with teaching 
hospitals (Table 2).
Postsurgical mortality
For this analysis, we included 154 019 surgically 
treated patients after excluding patients who died 
intraoperatively (n = 237) or were discharged alive 
on the day of surgery (n = 126) (Figure 1). By day 
30 after surgery, 8035 (5.2%) hospital stays ended 
with death, 95 039 (61.7%) ended with live dis-
charge, 29 324 (19.0%) had right-censoring events, 
and 21 621 (14.0%) hospital stays were longer than 
30 days. The average rate of postsurgical death was 
4.0 (95% CI 3.9–4.1) per 1000 patient-days, vary-
ing from 3.5 (95% CI 3.4–3.6) at teaching hospi-
tals, to 4.3 (95% CI 4.2–4.4), 4.7 (95% CI 4.5–5.0) 
4.4 (95% CI 3.4–5.5) at large, medium and small 
community hospitals, respectively (Table 2). 
Compared with the number of deaths per 1000 
surgeries at teaching hospitals, there were an addi-
tional 4 (95% CI 0–8), 11 (95% CI 5–27) and 10 
(95% CI 4–23) deaths per 1000 surgeries at large, 
medium and small community hospitals, respec-
tively (Table 2). For the risk of postsurgical in-
hospital death, the adjusted ORs were 1.06 (95% 
CI 0.99–1.13), 1.13 (95% CI 1.04–1.23) and 1.18 
(95% CI 0.87–1.60) at large, medium and small 
community hospitals, respectively, compared with 
teaching hospitals (Table 2).
Mortality without surgery
For this analysis, we included 13 958 nonsurgically 
treated patients. By day 30 after admission, 3649 
(26.1%) died without surgery, 6778 (48.6%) were 
discharged without surgery, and 3531 (25.3%) had 
right-censoring events. The average rate of death 
without surgery was 6.3 (95% CI 6.1–6.5) per 1000 
patient-days, varying from 5.3 (95% CI 5.0–5.6) at 
teaching hospitals, to 5.9 (95% CI 5.6–6.2), 7.7 
(95% CI 7.2–8.3) and 8.6 (95% CI 7.8–9.4) per 
1000 patient-days at large, medium and small com-
munity hospitals, respectively. Among the 13 958 
patients treated nonsurgically, the cumulative inci-
dence of death by inpatient day 30 was 19 (95% CI 
18–20) per 1000 admissions at teaching hospitals, 
and 19 (95% CI 18–20), 29 (95% CI 27–31) and 
52 (95% CI 48–57) per 1000 admissions at large, 
medium and small community hospitals, respec-
tively. Compared with the number of deaths with-
out surgery per 1000 admissions at teaching hospi-
tals, there were an additional 10 (95% CI 8–12) 
and 34 (95% CI 29–39) deaths per 1000 admis-
sions at medium and small community hospitals, 
respectively. There was no difference between 
teaching and large community hospitals. The ad-
justed ORs for death without surgery were 1.02 
(95% CI 0.92–1.14), 1.50 (95% CI 1.33–1.69) and 
2.64 (95% CI 2.30–3.03) at large, medium and 
small community hospitals, respectively, compared 
with teaching hospitals.
Interpretation
Compared with teaching hospitals, the risk of in-
hospital death was higher at medium and small 
community hospitals, and the risk of in-hospital 
death after surgery was higher at medium com-
munity hospitals. The difference in postsurgical 
mortality between teaching hospitals and small 
community hospitals, although large, was not 
significant after adjustment. No differences in 
outcomes were found between teaching hospitals 
and large community hospitals.
Our findings are consistent with those from 
previous reports of increased risk of death 
among patients treated at community hospitals 
after hip fracture,9,11,13 and among patients 
treated at hospitals with fewer available beds at 
admission.31 As argued elsewhere, the risk of 
death in hospital also depends on time spent in 
hospital, which varies by treatment setting.32
We recently showed a reduction in hospital stay 
after hip fracture following changes in bed man-
agement and changes in policy on access to hip 
fracture surgery in Canada.20 How these changes 
were implemented and how effective they were at 
reducing hospital stay likely varied by treatment 
setting. Teaching hospitals may shorten stays more

effectively because discharge options such as reha-
bilitation and residential care facilities are more 
prevalent than in community hospitals.33 Our study 
accounted for this potential bias. In particular, we 
used the cumulative incidence to estimate the pro-
portion of patients who died in hospital among all 
patients admitted to hospital with hip fracture 
while being exposed to the competing risk of live 
discharge during the follow-up period.
Postsurgical mortality was higher at medium 
community hospitals than at teaching hospitals. 
The difference may be attributable to medium 
community hospitals having fewer beds, staff and 
equipment available to ensure access to timely 
hip fracture care,31,34 or to their having a less ag-
gressive treatment style, leaving more patients 
exposed to potentially fatal immobilized and in-
flammatory states.1,7,35–38 Whether additional re-
sources for medium community hospitals may 
improve outcomes in this vulnerable patient pop-
ulation requires further investigation.
The risk of death without surgery was higher 
at medium and small community hospitals than at 
teaching hospitals. It is not clear whether this dif-
ference reflects a need to transfer patients for spe-
cialist care not available at medium and small 
community hospitals. The time required to trans-
fer patients from medium and small community 
hospitals for care contributes to potentially harm-
ful surgical delay.39 It may be necessary to priori-
tize these patients on arrival at larger hospitals.
Other structures and processes may influence 
outcomes of hip fracture care. Previous studies 
have shown an association between a higher vol-
ume of hip fracture surgeries and delays, compli-
cations and death.40,41 The studies suggest under-
prioritization of hip fracture over other surgeries 
at high-volume sites.40,41 Hospital occupancy has 
also been associated with risk of in-hospital 
death after hip fracture.31 Future research should 
explore the association among teaching status, 
bed capacity, occupancy and volume to better 
our understanding of outcomes of hip fracture 
care delivery.
Limitations
We conducted a secondary analysis of discharge 
abstracts with limited variables for adjustment. In 
particular, patients with hip fracture in different 
treatment settings may differ by pre-fracture func-
tion, level of dependency, injury severity, body 
composition, cognition, and presence of liver dis-
ease, anemia, stroke and secondary hyperparathy-
roidism.42 Further, the abstracts do not provide 
indication for nonsurgical treatment. Palliative 
care may have been more frequent at medium and 
small community hospitals. Classification of treat-
ment settings was based on data from the second 
half of the study period.43 This may have led to 
misclassification of medium and small commu-
nity hospitals if the number of beds increased 
across the study years. Bed capacity was not 
available for teaching hospitals; therefore, we did 
not investigate difference in mortality by hospital 
size separately. The hospitals were not identified 
by their geographic location, which precluded 
adjustment for urban, rural or remote location. 
Whether medium and small community hospitals 
serve more remote populations, or whether Cana-
da’s geography could facilitate access to larger 
hospitals was not factored into our analysis. Few 
patients underwent surgery at small community 
hospitals, which, combined with the lack of clini-
cal data, requires some caution in interpretation of 
the observed differences. Finally, the province of 
Quebec compiles hospital discharge data in a sep-
arate database and does not contribute to the CIHI 
Discharge Abstracts Database; therefore, the 
results may not be generalizable to Quebec.
Conclusion
Compared with teaching hospitals, the risk of in-
hospital death overall was higher at medium and 
small community hospitals, and the risk of post-
surgical death was higher at medium community 
hospitals. The difference in postsurgical mortality 
between teaching hospitals and small community 
hospitals, although large, was not significant after 
adjustment. We found no difference between 
teaching hospitals and large community hospi-
tals. Future research should examine the role of 
volume, demand and bed occupancy for the 
observed differences by treatment setting.
