IMPORTANCE Whether vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial and safe
for offspring is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review studies of the effects of vitamin D supplementation
during pregnancy on offspring growth, morbidity, and mortality.
DATA SOURCES Searches of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews were conducted up to October 31, 2017. Key search terms were vitamin D,
pregnancy, randomized controlled trials, and offspring outcomes.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy
and offspring outcomes.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two authors independently extracted data, and the
quality of the studies was assessed. Summary risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) or mean
difference (MD), and 95% CI were calculated using fixed-effects or random-effects
meta-analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Main outcomes were fetal or neonatal mortality, small for
gestational age (SGA), congenital malformation, admission to a neonatal intensive care unit,
birth weight, Apgar scores, neonatal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and calcium
concentrations, gestational age, preterm birth, infant anthropometry, and respiratory
morbidity during childhood.
RESULTS Twenty-four clinical trials involving 5405 participants met inclusion criteria. Vitamin
D supplementation during pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of SGA (RR, 0.72; 95%
CI, 0.52 to 0.99; RD, −5.60%; 95% CI, −0.86% to −10.34%) without risk of fetal or neonatal
mortality (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.11) or congenital abnormality (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.61 to
1.43). Neonates with prenatal vitamin D supplementation had higher 25(OH)D levels (MD,
13.50 ng/mL; 95% CI, 10.12 to 16.87 ng/mL), calcium levels (MD, 0.19 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.003
to 0.38 mg/dL), and weight at birth (MD, 75.38 g; 95% CI, 22.88 to 127.88 g), 3 months (MD,
0.21 kg; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.28 kg), 6 months (MD, 0.46 kg; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.58 kg), 9 months
(MD, 0.50 kg; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.99 kg), and 12 months (MD, 0.32 kg; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.52 kg).
Subgroup analysis by doses showed that low-dose vitamin D supplementation (�2000 IU/d)
was associated with a reduced risk of fetal or neonatal mortality (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15 to
0.80), but higher doses (>2000 IU/d) did not reduce this risk (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.54).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy is associated
with a reduced risk of SGA and improved infant growth without risk of fetal or neonatal
mortality or congenital abnormality. Vitamin D supplementation with doses of 2000 IU/d or
lower during pregnancy may reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal mortality.

 L
ow maternal vitamin D level status is common during
pregnancy and is a public health issue worldwide.1-3 Vi-
tamin D, a fat-soluble nutrient and prohormone,2 has
classic functions of calcium absorption, metabolism, and bone
health and nonclassic actions that may affect various other as-
pects of health.4 Low vitamin D level status during preg-
nancymayexposetheoffspringtoasuboptimalnutritionalen-
vironmentduringcriticalphasesoffetaldevelopmentandmay
have long-term effects on offspring health outcomes.3,5,6 Suf-
ficient vitamin D concentrations are needed during preg-
nancy to address the increased demand of fetal growth and de-
velopment because the mother provides all of the vitamin D
for the fetus.7
During the past few decades, emerging randomized clini-
cal trials (RCTs) have assessed the effect of vitamin D supple-
mentation during pregnancy on maternal, neonatal, infant,
or child outcomes. However, the results of the RCTs are
inconsistent.2 There is a lack of evidence from systematic re-
views and meta-analyses to evaluate the association be-
tween vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and off-
spring growth, morbidity, and mortality.4 Given the high
prevalence of low vitamin D level status during pregnancy and
the public health importance of clarifying the role of vitamin
D during pregnancy in offspring health, we conducted a sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs with aims to evalu-
ate the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementa-
tion during pregnancy on offspring outcomes.
Methods
Data Sources and Searches
This systematic review is presented according to Preferred Re-
porting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines.8 Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Da-
tabase of Systematic Reviews were searched up to October 31,
2017. The key words used were vitamin D, pregnancy, random-
ized controlled trials, and offspring outcomes. References cited
in these articles were manually searched to identify addi-
tional RCTs.
Study Selection
Two investigators (W.G.B. and S.Q.W.) independently scruti-
nized the electronic searches and obtained full articles of all
citations that were potentially eligible studies for inclusion.
Full-length articles of studies evaluating maternal vitamin D
supplementation in pregnancy and offspring outcomes were
examined and subsequently selected if they fulfilled the fol-
lowing inclusion criteria: (1) the design was an RCT; (2) popu-
lation was healthy, pregnant women without prior vitamin D
supplementation of more than 400 IU/d; (3) vitamin D proto-
col was specified in the treatment group; (4) outcomes were
offspring growth, morbidity, and mortality; (5) the study con-
tained relevant data to calculate the effect size; and (6) the
study met the methodologic quality assessment criteria for
RCTs.9 Articles were excluded if (1) they were reviews, obser-
vational studies, case reports, letters, or comments; (2) there
was no appropriate control group; (3) vitamin D dose in the in-
tervention group was 400 IU/d or less; or (4) data were incom-
plete or conflicting.
Primary outcomes were (1) small for gestational age (SGA),
indicated by birth weight less than the 10th percentile for ges-
tational age, and (2) fetal or neonatal mortality. Secondary out-
comes were (1) neonatal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) lev-
els, (2) congenital malformation, (3) admission to a neonatal
intensive care unit (NICU), (4) Apgar scores, (5) neonatal cal-
cium levels, (6) birth weight, (7) low birth weight, (8) gesta-
tional age, (9) preterm birth, (10) infant growth, (11) asthma,
(12) respiratory infection, (13) eczema, and (14) allergy.
Quality Assessment
We evaluated the methodologic quality of each eligible RCT
using the Cochrane Risk Assessment Tool (eTable in the
Supplement).9 The following items were evaluated: random
sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment
(selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (per-
formance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection
bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective re-
porting (reporting bias), and other biases. For all RCTs, each
item was described as having a low risk of bias, a high risk of
bias, or an unclear risk of bias.9
Data Extraction and Synthesis
The following information was extracted from the study re-
ports: the first author’
s last name, year of publication, coun-
try of origin, study design, total sample size, characteristics
of participants, timing of supplementation, interventions, and
outcomes. When the study had 2 or more intervention groups
with different doses of vitamin D supplementation, we com-
bined them into 1 intervention group. Two of us (W.G.B.
and S.Q.W.) extracted the data independently and in dupli-
cate. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion to
achieve a consensus.
Subgroup analyses were performed according to timing
(initiation at <20 or ≥20 weeks’gestation), dose (>2000 or
≤2000 IU/d), and method (regular or bolus doses) of vitamin
D supplementation for the outcomes of SGA, fetal or neona-
tal mortality, neonatal blood 25(OH)D concentration, and birth
weight.
Key Points
Question Is vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy
beneficial and safe for offspring?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 24
randomized clinical trials including 5405 individuals, vitamin D
supplementation during pregnancy was associated with a lower
risk of infants being small for gestational age and improved growth
during infancy without an increased risk of fetal or neonatal
mortality or congenital abnormality.
Meaning Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy may
reduce the risk of infants being small for gestational age and
improve growth during infancy without an increased risk of fetal
or neonatal mortality or congenital abnormality.

 Statistical Analysis
Data on dichotomous outcomes were combined using the
Mantel-Haenszel method, and measures of effect are pre-
sented as risk ratios (RRs) or risk differences with 95% CIs.
For continuous data, we calculated the sample size–
weighted mean difference (MD) when outcomes were mea-
sured in the same way between studies. We used forest plots
to show the point estimate (95% CIs) for each study. The I2
statistic (percentage of variability in the results that is due to
heterogeneity) was used to quantify the degree of heteroge-
neity across studies.10 If the I2 value was 50% or greater, the
heterogeneity was considered significant and we pooled
results using a random-effects model. Otherwise, a fixed-
effect model was applied. Funnel plots were applied to
evaluate publication bias. The data were extracted and sta-
tistical analysis was carried out using Review Manager, ver-
sion 5.3 (RevMan).11 Two-tailed P < .05 values were consid-
ered statistically significant.
Results
Study Selection
The search strategy resulted in 728 potentially relevant cita-
tions.ThePRISMAflowdiagram(Figure1)summarizesthepro-
cess of the literature search and selection of studies. After
screening the titles and abstracts, we read 56 articles. Twenty-
four RCTs12-36 comprising 5405 participants met the inclu-
sion criteria. Two of these trials are from the same RCT with
different outcomes.17,36 The assessment of methodologic qual-
ity of each eligible RCT by the Cochrane Risk Assessment Tool
is summarized in the eTable in the Supplement.
Study Characteristics
The characteristics of the included RCTs are summarized in
the Table. Vitamin D supplementation was in the form of
cholecalciferol in 22 RCTs13-24,26-35 and in the form of ergocal-
ciferol in 3 RCTs.12,17,25 For the intervention group, the daily
doses were 800 IU in 1 RCT,17 1000 IU in 6 RCTs,12,14,16,18,25,26
1200 IU in 1 RCT,34 2000 IU in 7 RCTs,15,18,20,26,29,34,35 2800
IU in 1 RCT,13 4000 IU in 4 RCTs,15,20,21,29 4400 in 1 RCT,24
or 5000 IU in 1 RCT33; the weekly doses were 35 000 IU30
or 50 000 IU19; the fortnightly dose was 50 000 IU in 2
RCTs23,28; the monthly dose was 60 000 IU32; the bimonthly
dose was 60 000 IU32; and the bolus doses were 60 000 IU in
3 RCTs,22,27,31 120 000 IU in 2 RCTs,22,31 or 200 000 IU in 2
RCTs.17,25 In studies comprising 3 or more groups, as was the
case in 9 RCTs,15,17,18,20,22,25,26,32,34 the higher-dose groups
were combined into 1 cohort as the intervention group and
the lowest dose groups as the control cohort. There were no
toxic effects on offspring in the included RCTs and no evi-
dence of publication bias.
The vitamin D supplementation group had a significantly
lower risk of SGA (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.99; I2 = 0%) in 6
RCTs12,15,19,21,31,36 with 898 participants (Figure 2). Risk dif-
ference was −5.60%; 95% CI, −0.86% to −10.34%. Subgroup
analysis by doses showed that vitamin D supplementation at
2000 IU/d or lower was associated with a reduced risk of SGA
(RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.90), while vitamin D supplemen-
tation at doses larger than 2000 IU/d was not associated with
a reduced risk of SGA (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.19). Testing
of subgroups showed no significant differences, but signifi-
cantheterogeneitywaspresent(P = .13;I2 = 56.5%)(Figure2B).
Timing (early or late) (Figure 2A) and method (regular or bo-
lus doses) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement) of vitamin D supple-
mentation had no association with the risk of SGA.
Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy was not as-
sociatedwithariskoffetalorneonatalmortality(RR,0.72;95%
CI, 0.47-1.11; I2 = 0%) in 10 RCTs13,14,17-21,24,30,33 with 3780 par-
ticipants (Figure 3). Subgroup analysis by doses showed that
vitamin D supplementation at 2000 IU/d or less was associ-
ated with reduced risk of fetal or neonatal mortality (RR, 0.35;
95% CI, 0.15-0.80), while vitamin D supplementation at doses
larger than 2000 IU/d did not reduce the risk of fetal or neo-
natal mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.59-1.54). Testing for sub-
group difference was statistically significant (RR, 0.73; 95% CI,
0.49-1.10;P = .04)(Figure3B).Timing(earlyorlate)(Figure3A)
and method (regular or bolus doses) (eFigure 2 in the Supple-
ment) of vitamin D supplementation had no association with
the risk of fetal or neonatal mortality.

95% CI, 0.61-1.43; I2 = 0%) in 3 RCTs13,14,24 with 2355 partici-

Discussion
The main finding of this systematic review and meta-
analysis of RCTs was that vitamin D supplementation during
pregnancywasassociatedwithareducedriskofSGA(RR,0.72)
withoutanincreasedriskoffetalorneonatalmortalityandcon-
genitalmalformation.VitaminDsupplementationduringpreg-
nancy with lower doses (≤2000 IU/d) was associated with
a reduced risk of fetal and neonatal mortality. Vitamin D
supplementation was associated with higher neonatal vita-
min D status (bolus- or regular-dose supplement and early or
late timing were equally effective in attaining improvement in
vitamin D levels), higher calcium levels, higher Apgar scores,
greater neonatal skinfold thickness, greater weight (at birth,
3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months), and greater
height (at 3 months, 9 months, and 12 months) in the off-
spring. Timing of vitamin D supplementation affected birth
weight.Therewasnosignificantdifferenceintheoffspringout-
comes of gestational age, preterm birth, asthma, eczema, re-
spiratory tract infection, or allergy. Based on the results from
this meta-analysis, the number needed to treat for SGA was
18: 1 offspring SGA case could be avoided for every 18 preg-
nant women receiving vitamin D supplementation during
pregnancy.
The quality of systematic reviews depends on the quality
of the studies included. We evaluated the risk of bias in the

ity. We scrutinized the selected studies of good methodologic
quality using strict quality assessment criteria.9 Our system-
atic review is a comprehensive quantitative review of 24 RCTs
that reported the effects of maternal vitamin D supplementa-
tion in offspring health outcomes, including SGA, fetal or neo-
natal mortality, congenital malformation, admission to a NICU,
Apgar scores, neonatal 25(OH)D and calcium concentrations,
pretermbirth,anthropometricindicators(weight,height,head
circumference, or skinfold thickness) during infancy (at birth
and ages 3, 6, 9, and 12 months), asthma, eczema, respiratory
tract infection, and allergy in the first 3 years of life.

tematic review3 evaluated the outcome of vitamin D supple-
mentation during pregnancy for maternal 25(OH)D levels, risk
ofpreeclampsia,gestationaldiabetes,andothermaternalcom-
plications but lacked review on offspring outcomes. A Coch-
rane review39 studied the association between supplement-
ing vitamin D in pregnant women alone or in combination with
calcium along with maternal complications and neonatal out-
comes and showed no association between vitamin D supple-
mentation and birth weight in 5 RCTs. Another systematic
review40 assessed maternal and neonatal outcomes and
showed that birth weight in 8 RCTs and length in 6 RCTs were
greater in the vitamin D supplementation group; however, this
review had no information on infant follow-up.
The present review adds to the existing literature by in-
cluding a greater number of recent RCTs and, to our knowl-
edge, is the first meta-analysis of RCTs reporting that vitamin
D supplementation during pregnancy was safe (without in-
creased risk of fetal or neonatal mortality, congenital abnor-
mality, or admission to a NICU) and effective in reducing the
risk of SGA and improving neonatal calcium levels, skinfold
thickness, and postnatal growth (greater weight and height at
ages 3, 6, 9, or 12 months). We found that maternal vitamin D
supplementationtiming,dose,andadministrationmethoddid
not affect cord blood vitamin D concentration. Late vitamin
D supplementation (initiation at ≥20 weeks’gestation) im-
proved birth weight, but early supplementation (initiation at
<20weeks’gestation)didnot.Mostimportantly,wefoundthat
the lower dose of vitamin D supplementation (≤2000 IU/d) re-
duced the risk of fetal or neonatal mortality and SGA, but the
higher dose (>2000 IU/d) did not.
OurfindingsthatmaternalvitaminDsupplementationdur-
ing pregnancy reduced the risk of SGA and improved infant
growth are biologically plausible. Maternal vitamin D levels
during pregnancy positively affect infant bone formation41 as
well as skeletal muscle42 and adiposity development,43 which
are important for infant growth and development. Vitamin D
is needed in maintaining normal levels of calcium and phos-
phate in blood, which in turn facilitate the process of mineral
ion homeostasis and bone formation during early life.44 In-
creased maternal vitamin D status improved fetal skeletal
muscle development and myoblast activity.42 Members of the
SouthamptonDevelopmentalOriginsofHealthandDiseasere-
search group reported that low maternal vitamin D status at
34 weeks’gestation was associated with lower fat mass at
birth.43 Vitamin D also plays an important role in the modu-
lationoftheimmunefunction45andoxidativestress46thatmay
link to fetal growth. In addition, vitamin D regulates genes re-
sponsible for trophoblast invasion and angiogenesis critical for
placental implantation and function,47-49 which is important
for fetal growth.
Vitamin D during pregnancy has been linked to fetal lung
maturation in animal models.50,51 Maternal vitamin D may ex-
ert its influence during pregnancy on the respiratory and im-
mune systems during lung development in early childhood.52
However, the results of this meta-analysis show that vitamin
D supplementation during pregnancy was not associated with
childhood respiratory or immune outcomes, including upper
or lower respiratory tract infections, asthma, eczema, or al-
lergy, in children at age 3 years. Christensen et al53 conducted
a meta-analysis of maternal vitamin D supplementation dur-
ing pregnancy and infant respiratory tract infections; their re-
sults were in line with ours with respect to respiratory tract
infections, but they did not have results on asthma. Long-
term follow-up of children is needed to determine the effect
of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on other
health outcomes.
Limitations
Thisstudyhaslimitations.First,therewerelimiteddataonma-
ternal vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy regard-
ing long-term offspring outcomes, and the longest follow-up
in the included RCTs was 3 years. Second, there were only 2
studies on the outcomes of infant growth at age 3 months,12,22
6 months,12,22 9 months,12,22 and 12 months12,30; this result has
to be interpreted cautiously. In addition, there was heteroge-
neity in the result of weight in infants at age 9 months; it is not
clear why these 2 studies show different patterns in infants at
this age. From a developmental perspective, at 9 months, in-
fants’weight may differ because of transition to solid food and
the total intake, and some infants will begin to walk. Third, the
included RCTs differed in several aspects, such as the popu-
lation studied, ethnicity, altitude, latitude, the outcomes cho-
sen, the clinical setting, the timing of the intervention, and the
dose of vitamin D administered during pregnancy. Fourth, the
variability in the assay methods for 25(OH)D measurement in
each study may contribute to the heterogeneity of the neona-
tal vitamin D levels. Finally, there were limited data on adher-
ence to the respective protocols.
Conclusions
Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy was associ-
ated with reduced risk of SGA, improved infant growth, and
no risk of fetal or neonatal mortality and congenital abnor-
mality. Vitamin D supplementation (≤2000 IU/d) during preg-
nancy may reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal mortality.
