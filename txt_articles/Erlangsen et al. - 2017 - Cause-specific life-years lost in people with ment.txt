ABSTRACT 
 
IMPORTANCE People with mental disorders have higher mortality rates than the general 
population and updated findings are needed. Studying cause-specific mortality differences over time 
is complex but demographic measures, such as life years lost allow quantification of differences and 
provide an overview.   
OBJECTIVE The aim was to quantify the life years lost with respect to cause of death and 
differences over time between people with and without mental disorders.  
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort design was applied to nationwide register 
data on all persons aged 15-94 years living in Denmark during 1995-2014 (N=6,107,234). 
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Cause-specific mortality was examined using rate ratios, 
and average life years lost.  
RESULTS Cause-specific mortality rates were higher for people with mental disorders than for 
those without. For men with and without mental disorders, the number of life years lost between age 
15-94 were 26.3 and 16.1 life, respectively; a difference of 10.2 excess life years lost for those with 
mental disorders. The corresponding figures for women were 19.6 and 12.3 life years lost; implying 
7.3 excess life years lost. Among people with mental disorders, most life years lost were due to 
cancers (men: 5.0 years; women: 4.8 years) and heart diseases (men: 5.7 years; women: 4.6 years). 
Over calendar time, the overall excess in life years lost between those with and without mental 
disorders did not change. However, an increase was noted for cancers (men: 0.7 years; women: 0.4 
years), heart diseases (men: 1.2 years; women: 0.3 years), and respiratory diseases (men: 0.3 years; 
women: 0.2 years) while a decrease was noted for suicide (men: -0.7 years; women: -0.5 years) and 
accidents (men: -0.9 years; women: -0.5 years). 
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE A novel approach was applied for calculating average life 
years lost. We noted a shift from external causes of deaths to deaths related to medical diseases and 
 2 
 
conditions over recent years. Hence, future efforts might hinge upon improving healthier life styles, 
better detection and treatment of medical diseases and conditions as well as reducing side effect of 
medication among people with mental disorders.

Cause-specific life years lost among persons with mental disorders: a national 
register-based cohort study  
 
Introduction 
 
People with mental disorders have 3 to 4-fold higher mortality rates than people without mental 
disorders.1 This is a serious public health problem and the WHO calls for national targets to reduce 
the excess mortality among people with mental disorders.2,3 Yet, the quality of future efforts hinge 
upon updated knowledge of current mortality trends. 
 
The excess mortality among people with mental disorders relates not only to external causes of 
death, such as suicides, accidents, and homicides,1,4,5 but also to medical diseases and conditions, 
such as cardiovascular disease, malignant neoplasms, respiratory diseases, as well as endocrine and 
metabolic conditions.1,5-8 Previous studies have suggested that people with severe mental disorders 
on average live 10-20 years shorter than the general population.8,9 However, it is not entirely clear 
whether the mortality gap has grown over recent years; findings for schizophrenia support this 
notion,10,11 while others indicate it might have decreased.8,9 So far, only few studies have 
investigated mortality trends related to mental disorders in national samples and the evidence base 
is limited by selected samples and short follow-up periods.5,12-17  
 
Assessing mortality differences over time is complex as it varies by age and cause of death. Also, 
calculating the life expectancy, e.g. at age 15, may not reflect the situation adequately as this 
implies assuming that all persons with a mental disorder were diagnosed at this age.17-20 ‘Life years 
 4 
 
lost’ is a demographic measure, which describes the difference between average life expectancy and 
a given upper life limit.21-23 Life years lost allows for comparison of mortality across groups. 
 
The aim of this study was 1) to quantify the contribution by specific causes of death to the excess 
life years lost among people with mental disorders when compared to those without mental 
disorders and 2) to assess whether the excess has decreased during recent years. Danish national 
longitudinal registers offer a unique possibility for investigating mortality patterns with respect to 
diagnosed mental disorders.24  
 
Data and method 
 
Using a cohort design, population data from the Danish Civil Registration Register25 were linked to 
information on hospital contacts from the Psychiatric Central Research Register26 and deaths from 
the Danish Cause of Death register.27 Data were linked on an individual-level using the unique 
personal registration number.24  
 
Study population 
All persons aged between 15 and 94 years who were registered as living in Denmark at some point 
during January 1st, 1995 through December, 31st 2014 were observed. Persons who during follow-
up fulfilled the age criterion or migrated into the country were included on the date of their 15th 
birthday or date of entry, respectively. The study period lasted until date of: 95th birthday, 
emigration, death, or December, 31st 2014, which ever occurred first.  
 
Measures 
 5 
 
 
People were considered as exposed from the date of a psychiatric diagnosis. All fulltime or part-
time patients have been recorded in the Psychiatric Central Research Register since 1969. From 
1995 onwards, also outpatient and emergency department (ED) patients were included in the 
registry. All hospital contacts, except ED contacts, and all types of diagnoses, registred according to 
the International Classification of diseases (ICD),28,29 were screened to identify persons with a 
mental disorder. Contacts for an organic or symptomatic mental disorder (ICD-8: 290.09, 290.10, 
290.11, 290.18, 290.19, 292.x9, 293.x9, 294.x9, 309.x9; ICD-10: F00-F09), intellectual disability 
(ICD-8: 311.xx, 312.xx, 313.xx, 314.xx, 315.xx; ICD-10: F70-F79), and contacts exclusively for 
exams and observations (ICD-8: Y01-Y19; ICD-10: Z00-Z99) were not considered. Historical data 
dating back to 1969 were assessed.  
 
Outcomes 
Causes of death were identified using the primary cause listed in the Registry on Causes of Death 
where date of death also is recorded.27 Deaths were categorized according to the ICD-10 as: 
infectious diseases (ICD-10: A00-A09, A20-A99, B00-B89, B91-B99), neoplasms (ICD-10: C00-
D09), diabetes mellitus (ICD-10: E10-E14), heart diseases (ICD-10: F03.9, I00-I25, I27, I30-52, 
I60-I99, R54), respiratory diseases (ICD-10: J00-J99), digestive diseases (ICD-10: K00-K93), 
alcohol misuse (ICD-10: F10, I85, K70), suicide (ICD-10: X60-X84, Y87.0), accidents (ICD-10: 
V01-X59, Y10-Y86, Y87.2, Y88-Y89), and other causes of death (all remaining ICD-10 codes).  
 
Analysis 
Life years lost is a population measure, which complements life expectancy. It denotes the number 
of years between death and a desired upper limit of life span (=upper limit minus life expectancy). 
 6 
 
Life years lost describes the number of years that the population lost due to death and it is used for 
analyzing differences in mortality between subpopulations. In our case, life years lost is used to 
obtain the excess life years lost (=life years lost for people with mental disorders minus life years 
lost for people without mental disorders). The specific calculations of life years lost are described in 
this section.  
 
Cause-specific death rates were calculated for persons with and without mental disorders by single 
age increments and over 5-year periods. Age- and period-standardized mortality rate ratios (MRR) 
were obtained using direct standardization.23 Survival curves were calculated for persons aged 40 
years. Average life expectancy at diagnosis was calculated as follows: let ������������(������������1, ������������) denote life 
expectancy between age ������������1 and the age ������������ > ������������1, for those diagnosed with mental disorders at age ������������1. 
Life expectancies were calculated for every onset age, ������������1������������ from age 15 until an upper limit set at age 
������������ = 94; i.e. well above the life expectancy for the Danish population.30 These were combined into 
an average life expectancy at diagnosis until age 94 considering all the n individuals with mental 
disorders, as  
1
n ∑
e(������������1i, τ)
n
i=1
. Similarly, the average life expectancy was obtained for an age-
matched comparison group consisting of all persons without mental disorders. 
 
Let ə(������������1, ������������)  denote the number of life years lost between the age of onset ������������1 and the upper 
limit, ������������ > ������������1. This measure complements the average life expectancy by adding to the total possible 
number of years between the two ages, ������������1 and ������������, as (������������ − ������������1) = ������������(������������1, ������������) + ə(������������1, ������������). Life years lost 
were, further separated into changes attributable to specific causes of death,23,31,32 as ə(������������1, ������������) =
∑
ə������������(������������1, ������������)
������������
������������=1
, where m are the causes of death and ə������������(������������1, τ) the number of life years lost ‘due to 
cause j’. Similar calculations were conducted for people without mental disorders, denoted as

ə������������
∗(������������1, ������������), and the excess life years lost among those with mental disorders were calculated as the 
difference between the two,

Results 
 
A total of 6,107,234 individuals (men: 3,026,132; women: 3,081,102) aged 15-94 years were living 
in Denmark during 1995-2014. The study population was observed over 89,216,177 person-years 
(men: 43,914,948; women 45,301,229).  
 
Until 2014, in all 589,327 persons (men: 262,005; women: 327,322) had been diagnosed with a 
mental disorder. People with mental disorders were observed for a total of 5,999,290 person-years 
(men: n [%] 2,582,871 [5.9]; women: n [%] 3,416,420 [7.5]), equivalent to 6.7% of all person-
years.  
 
During the 20 years of study, 1,072,158 persons (men: 539,262; women: 532,896) died. Of these, 
134,150 persons (men: n [%] 61,855 [11.5]; women: n [%] 72,295 [13.6]) had been diagnosed with 
a mental disorder, accounting for 12.5% of all deaths. As seen in Table 1, the MRR between 
 8 
 
persons with and without mental disorders was highest for suicide (men: MRR: 10.7, CI-95%: 10.4-
11.0; women: MRR: 18.7, CI-95%: 17.9-19.5) and alcohol misuse (men: MRR: 8.3, CI-95%: 8.1-
8.5; women: MRR: 8.9, CI-95%: 8.6-9.2). Nevertheless, an elevated rate ratio was noted across all 
causes of death for persons with mental disorders. 
 
A lower probability of survival was found for people diagnosed with mental disorders at age 40 as 
seen in Figure 1. Combining similar calculations for each single age revealed that the average life 
expectancy at diagnosis until age 94 for men with mental disorders was 29.3 years while age-
matched men without mental disorders on average lived 39.5 years. Assuming an upper limit of 94 
years, 26.3 and 16.1 life years lost were estimated for men with and without mental disorders, 
respectively. The difference in life years lost, i.e. the excess life years lost were 10.2 years. For 
women, the average life expectancies were 34.6 and 41.9 years for those with and without mental 
disorders, respectively, corresponding to 19.6 and 12.3 life years lost; resulting in 7.3 years of 
excess life years lost.  
 
Contribution by causes of death 
The excess in life years lost for men with mental disorders was accounted for by alcohol misuse 
(2.8 years, 27.8%), other causes (1.9 years, 18.3%), accidents (1.7 years, 16.9%), and suicide (1.7 
years, 16.2%) (Table 2). Also, respiratory diseases (0.8 years, 8.3%) and heart diseases (0.5 years, 
5.0%) accounted for the major shares of excess life years lost. Men without mental disorders were 
losing more life years to cancers than those with mental disorders (0.2 years, 2.1%) and additional 
analysis revealed that men with mental disorders to a larger extent had died ahead of those ages 
where cancer rates peaked (table not shown). Among women, other causes (1.4 years, 19.4%), 
respiratory diseases (1.2 years, 16.9%), and alcohol misuses (1.1 years, 15.3%) were responsible for 
 9 
 
the major shares of excess life years lost while heart diseases and suicide each accounted for 0.9 
years (11.9%). 
 
Change over calendar time  
The number of life years lost between ages 15-94 decreased from 27.8 in 1995-1999 to 24.5 in 
2010-2014 for men with mental disorders. Men without mental disorders experienced a decline 
from 17.7 to 14.4 life years lost. The excess, or difference, in life years lost for the two groups were 
of similar magnitude over calendar time, i.e. 3.2 and 3.3 years respectively. The same was observed 
for women where a decrease from 20.4 to 18.3 was noted for those with mental disorder while life 
years lost declined from 13.1 to 11.1 years for those without mental disorders.  
 
Figure 2 illustrate the distribution of life years lost by causes of death. Cancers accounted for an 
increasing share of life years lost; it rose for men with mental disorders from 4.8 (17.2%) to 5.2 
(21.2%) and among women from 4.5 (22.2%) to 4.8 (26.4%). For heart diseases, improvements 
over time were noted for both groups, albeit more pronounced among people without mental 
disorders. The number of life years lost due to respiratory diseases increased from 1.0 (11.1%) to 
1.3 (13.7%) year for women with mental disorders over time. A decline in life years lost due to 
suicide from 2.3 (8.4%) to 1.6 (6.5%) was observed for men and from 1.2 (6.1%) to 0.7 (3.9%) for 
women with mental disorders between 1995-1999 and 2010-2014 while only a marginal difference 
was noted for people without mental disorders. Life years lost to accidents decreased from 2.8 
(10.0%) to 1.7 (6.8%) for men and 1.4 (7.0%) to 0.7 (4.0%) for women.  
 
In Figure 3, where ‘zero’ indicated no excess life years lost, the negative numbers revealed that men 
with mental disorders experienced fewer life years lost due to cancers (-0.5) than those without 
 10 
 
mental disorders during 1995-1999. This figure rose to 0.1 in 2010-2014. Women also experienced 
an increase in excess life years lost due to cancers over time; from 0.2 to 0.6 years when comparing 
changes from 1995-1999 to 2010-2014. Similarly, increases in excess life years lost were observed 
for heart diseases (men: 1.2; women 0.3) and respiratory diseases (men: 0.3; women: 0.2). 
Seemingly, no changes were achieved for digestive disorders (men: -0.1; women: 0.0) and alcohol 
misuse (men: 0.1; women: 0.0); the latter accounted for 2.5 excess life years lost among men with 
mental disorders over the examined period. A decrease in excess life years lost by external causes 
of death, such as suicide (men: -0.7; women: -0.5) and accidents (men: -0.9; women: -0.5), was 
noted. Still, the absolute difference remained at a relatively high level, particularly for men where 
suicide and accidents each accounted for 1.4 and 1.3 life years lost, respectively, in 2010-2014. See 
eTable in the Online-Only Supplements for additional information. 
 
Discussion 
 
This is, to our knowledge, the first nationwide study to quantify which causes of death contributed 
to the excess in life years lost among people with mental disorders when compared to those without 
mental disorders. We find that the excess life years lost among people with mental disorders was 
predominantly related to respiratory diseases (for women), alcohol misuse, suicide and accidents 
(for men). Overall, the excess life years lost changed little over time for people with mental 
disorders. However,  death related to medical diseases and conditions became more significant over 
time. 
 
Causes of death 
 11 
 
Cancers, heart diseases, and also respiratory diseases accounted for the major shares of life years 
lost among people with mental disorders. Heart diseases might partly be explained through links to 
mental disorders, e.g. between myocardial infarction and depression.35 Deaths due to respiratory 
diseases, including COPD, accounted for 1.2 out of 7.3 (17%) of the excess life years lost among 
women with mental disorders. Smoking is frequent among people with mental disorders and might 
possibly affect women more adversely.36,37 Other unhealthy life-style habits are prevalent among 
people with mental disorders and might explain the large impact by cancers and digestive 
disorders.38,39 In addition, studies suggest that physical disorders might be detected later and given 
less than optimal treatment among patients with mental disorders when compared to those 
without.40,41 
 
As shown previously, an excess number of life years lost was related to suicides, accidents, and 
alcohol misuse,.1,42,43 Alcohol misuse accounts for a large share of excess life years lost. Substance 
misuse is a frequent comorbid disorder among people with mental disorders.44,45 The excess life 
years lost related to accidents might to some extent be related to misuse disorders.39 
 
Change over calendar time 
Although a decrease in life years lost was observed among people with mental disorders, a similar 
reduction was observed for those without mental disorders. 
 
Fewer life years were lost due to cancers among men with mental disorders than those without 
although an increase was noted over time. Men with mental disorders experienced more life years 
lost due to causes of death that were prevalent during younger ages, such as accidents and suicides, 
and were, thus, not exposed to the risk of developing cancers at more mature ages; i.e. competing 
 12 
 
risks. The same phenomenon applies to heart diseases, which also have a relatively late onset. The 
increasing percentage over time of life years lost due to cancers, heart diseases and respiratory 
diseases could indicate that people with mental disorders now to a larger extent are living longer 
and, consequently, are exposed to risks of dying by diseases with a later onset. 
 
As seen from the findings of this study, people with mental disorders experienced fewer life years 
lost to suicide over the examined period (men: -0.7 years, women: -0.5 years) while the number of 
life years lost for those without mental disorders didn’t change (men: -0.1 years, women: 0 years). 
The overall suicide rate has declined in Denmark46 and our findings indicate that this is chiefly 
attributable to a decline among people with mental disorders. Means restrictions are likely to have 
had an impact on the suicide rate of people with mental disorders who might be more impulsive or 
have preference for specific methods.47,48 Furthermore, medical treatment and psychosocial therapy 
for people at risk of suicide might be beneficial.49-51 
 
 
Strengths and limitations 
 
Nationwide register data were collected on a uniform basis for the entire study population without 
loss to follow-up. By including historical and complete data on psychiatric hospital contacts dating 
back to 1969, we were able to identify a comprehensive share of the population with mental 
disorders; thus, minimizing any selection bias. The long follow-up period improved the consistency 
in the findings. Furthermore, the Danish registration of causes of death has been evaluated to be 
reliable.27 The current study presented an average life expectancy and life years lost based on the 
age at diagnosis. Furthermore, life years lost is an easily conveyable measure allowing for 
 13 
 
presentation of complex scenarios, e.g. with the purpose of informing healthcare staff and 
policymakers. 
 
Limitations should be acknowledged. Psychiatric diagnosis during hospital contact served as a 
proxy for severe mental disorders; while it is reasonable to assume that the most severe cases of 
mental disorders will be seen at hospital, less severe cases might be missed. Also, it is possible that 
we did not capture first onset of all persons with mental disorders, leading to conservative 
estimates. Lastly, we applied a restrictive approach for identifying deaths due to alcohol misuse, 
thus, possibly underestimating its impact. People with mental disorders constitute a heterogeneous 
group, hence limiting the interpretation of findings; future studies addressing specific mental 
disorders are encouraged. 
 
Clinical implications 
The findings underline the importance of attention towards risks of suicide and accidents among 
patients with mental disorders. It has been suggested that people with severe mental disorders are 
underserved with respect to certain medical procedures, such as cardiovascular diseases.3,16 This has 
led to calls for better physical exams during hospital contact for mental disorders.52 However, 
people with mental disorder spend only a fragment of their life in hospitals and, consequently, 
detection and treatment of physical disorders should not be limited to these periods; follow-up visits 
with GP could prove to have an important role through routine screening.  
 
Improving healthy habits, in terms of nutrition and exercise, are promising measures, which only to 
some extent have been explored.53,54 Also, effective interventions aimed at substance misuse seem 
indicated.

Conclusion 
 
Excess mortality among people with mental disorders was quantified using innovative demographic 
measures. Alcohol misuse, suicide and accidents accounted for most of the excess life years lost 
among people with mental disorders, followed by heart diseases and respiratory diseases. Overall, 
the excess life years lost among people with mental disorders did not improve over the studied 
period. However, cause-specific analysis revealed a shift in which causes of death were responsible 
for excess life years lost; people with mental disorders experienced an increasing number of excess 
life years lost by cancers, heart diseases, and respiratory diseases while decreasing numbers were 
noted for suicide and accidents over recent years.  
 
 
 15 
 
Key points: 
QUESTION: What causes of death account for excess life years lost among people with mental 
disorders and are there changes over time?  
FINDING: This nationwide cohort study finds that suicide, accidents, and alcohol misuse continue 
to account for the major share of excess life years lost. While the overall trend showed little 
improvement over time, less life years lost were noted for suicide and accidents while more life 
years lost were noted for heart diseases, respiratory diseases, and cancers. 
MEANING: A shift from external causes to deaths related to medical diseases and conditions has 
occurred; suggesting that more attention towards physical conditions of people with mental 
disorders is needed.
