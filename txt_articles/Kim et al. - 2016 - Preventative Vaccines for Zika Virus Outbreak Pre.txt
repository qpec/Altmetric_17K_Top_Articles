Since it emerged in Brazil in May 2015, the mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) has raised global concern due to its
association with a significant rise in the number of infants born with microcephaly and neurological disorders
such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. We developed prototype subunit and adenoviral-based Zika vaccines encoding
the extracellular portion of the ZIKV envelope gene (E) fused to the T4 fibritin foldon trimerization domain (Efl).
The subunit vaccine was delivered intradermally through carboxymethyl cellulose microneedle array (MNA).
The immunogenicity of these two vaccines, named Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and ZIKV-rEfl, was tested in C57BL/6 mice.
Prime/boost immunization regimen was associated with induction of a ZIKV-specific antibody response, which
provided neutralizing immunity. Moreover, protection was evaluated in seven-day-old pups after virulent
ZIKV intraperitoneal challenge. Pups born to mice immunized with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl were all protected against lethal
challenge infection without weight loss or neurological signs, while pups born to dams immunized with MNA-
ZIKV-rEfl were partially protected (50%). No protection was seen in pups born to phosphate buffered saline-im-
munized mice. This study illustrates the preliminary efficacy of the E ZIKV antigen vaccination in controlling ZIKV
infectivity, providing a promising candidate vaccine and antigen format for the prevention of Zika virus disease.

1. Introduction
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus of the Flaviviridae
family that was first identified in Uganda in 1947. The virus has recently
attracted global attention due to its rapid spread from Brazil to other
countries in the Americas (Dick et al., 1952; Zanluca et al., 2015). The
ZIKV outbreak in Brazil has been associated with a significant rise in
the number of babies born with microcephaly (Zanluca et al., 2015)
and neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and has
been declared a “Global Emergency” by the World Health Organization
(WHO 2016 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/zika/en/;
WHO 2016 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2016/
1st-emergency-committee-zika/en/; CDC 2016 http://www.cdc.gov/
zika/). Concern over the spread of ZIKV to the Northern Hemisphere
with its concomitant morbidity is spurring the search for an effective
vaccine. ZIKV is related to dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis,
and West Nile viruses (WNV), all of which are arthropod-borne
flaviviruses. Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV contains a positive, single-
stranded, genomic RNA encoding a polyprotein that is proteolytically
processed to yield three structural proteins: the capsid (C), the precur-
sor of membrane (prM), and the envelope (E), and seven nonstructural
proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5) (Dick et al.,
1952).
The succesful development of flavivirus vaccines began 80 years ago
in 1937 with the yellow fever YFV17D live-attenuated vaccine (Monath,
2008). Since then, N600 million people have been vaccinated, with 98%
protection and a N10 year persistence of vaccine–induced immunity
(Barrett and Teuwen, 2009). However, several severe adverse events as-
sociated with vaccine administration have been observed over the last
20 years. Thus, a purified, inactivated vaccine has been recently devel-
oped and its testing results suggest good immunogenicity and tolerabil-
ity (Monath et al., 2011). A few weeks ago, two studies showing
immunogenicity of a plasmid DNA or adenovirus (serotype 52) express-
ing virus-like particles in mice and non-human primates were pub-
lished (Larocca et al., 2016; Abbink et al., 2016). Here, to build on
these initial findings to develop an effective ZIKV vaccine, we describe
the development of a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing
codon-optimized ZIKV E antigen and a subunit recombinant ZIKV E vac-
cine delivered transcutaneously by carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)
microneedle arrays (MNAs) (Bediz et al., 2014; Korkmaz et al., 2015),
investigate their ability to induce neutralizing immune responses, and

 assess their ability to passively protect against ZIKV challenge in a novel
neonatal ZIKV infection mouse model.
2. Materials & Methods
2.1. Adenoviral Construction and Purification of Recombinant Protein
For construction of pAd/ZIKV-Efl, the gene encoding human secreto-
ry signal peptide hidden Markov model (SP-HMM, MWWRLWW
LLLLLLLLWPMVWA), the extracellular portion of the ZIKV strain
BeH815744 envelope gene (GenBank KU365780, defined as amino
acids 216–794 of the polyprotein), BamH I-linked T4 fibritin foldon
trimerization domain (GSGYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFL), Tobac-
co Etch Virus Protease (Tp) (ENLYFEG), and six histidine tag were
codon-optimized for optimal expression in mammalian cells using the
UpGene codon optimization algorithm (Gao et al., 2004). pAd/ZIKV-Efl
was generated by subcloning the codon-optimized ZIKV-Efl gene into
the shuttle vector, pAd (GenBank U62024) at SalI/NotI sites. Subse-
quently, replication-defective adenovirus 5, designated as Ad5.ZIKV-
Efl, was generated by loxP homologous recombination. Moreover, we
also purified recombinant proteins named ZIKV-rEfl from the superna-
tant using His60 Ni Superflow Resin (Clontech) under native conditions
to be used as a subunit vaccine. Briefly, the supernatant of Human Em-
bryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 cells infected with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl was heat-
inactivated at 65 °C for 30 min and mixed with the same volume of
binding buffer (40 mM imidazole, 900 mM NaCl, 100 mM sodium phos-
phate, pH 7.4). His60 Ni Superflow Resin (Clontech) previously equili-
brated with equilibration buffer (20 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl,
50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) was added and the mixture was in-
cubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The next day, the settled resin
mix was packed into an empty column. The column was washed with
10 ml of equilibration buffer three times followed by 10 ml of wash buff-
er (40 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4)
three times and eluted in 10 ml of elution buffer (500 mM imidazole,
500 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). The eluate was con-
centrated and desalted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in an
Amicon Ultra-15 filter (Millipore). This desalting step was repeated
three times. The concentrations of the purified recombinant ZIKV-Efl
were determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin
(BSA) as a protein standard.
2.2. Virus Stock
ZIKV stocks were provided by Dr. Rober Tesh of University of Texas
Medical Branch. Vero cells were infected with ZIKV DAKAR41542 at
MOI of 0.01 and incubated until the monolayer showed significant
cytopathic effect. Culture supernantant was clarified by centrifugation
at 3000g for 15 min. Virus was precipitated overnight by addition of
NaCl (0.4 M) and 6% polyethylene glycol. After centrifugation at
10,000g for 30 min, the viral pellet was re-dissolved to 1/100 of the orig-
inal volume in PBS and centrifuged on a 5 to 50% sucrose gradient at
90,000g for 3 h, followed by dialysis with PBS buffer. The virus was dilut-
ed to a proper concentration with 5% Trehalose Buffer (20 mM Tris,
pH 7.8, 75 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5% Trehalose, 0.0025% Tween 80)
and kept at −80 °C. For the virus titer, vero cells were seeded in a six-
well plate at 1 × 105 cells per well. The next day, cells were infected
with log dilutions of ZIKV for 1 h and overlayed with 1% methyl cellulose
media containing 5% fetal bovine serum. After three days of infection,
cells were stained with 1% crystal violet. Plaques were counted and
titers were calculated by multiplying the number of plaques by the
dilution and dividing by the infection volume.
2.3. Animal Experiments
Six- to eight-week-old C57BL/6 female mice (five animals
per group) were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) with 1 × 1011 viral
particles (v.p.) of Ad5.ZIKV-Efl or PBS as a negative control, and intra-
dermally (i.d.) with MNA coated with 20 μg of ZIKV-rEfl. Two weeks
after the primary immunization, mice were boosted intranasally (i.n.)
or i.d. with the same dose of the respective immunogens. Mice were
bled from the retro-orbital sinus at week 0, 2, 4, and 6, and serum sam-
ples were evaluated for ZIKV antibody by enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay (ELISA) and plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT).
For the immunization study, a protocol approved by the University of
Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee was followed.
To evaluate passive protection by maternal antibody, pups were ob-
tained by mating non-immunized males with immunized females at
three weeks following booster vaccination. Pups were challenged intra-
peritoneally (i.p.) with ZIKV DAKAR41542 (105 pfu/50 μl) at seven days
after birth. Two non-challenged pups from each litter were used as a
control and bled at 28 days after birth to determine passive maternal an-
tibodies. The physical condition of the pups was observed and their
body weights were measured daily for 15 days. Exhibiting N10% loss
of body weight was defined as onset of disease. In addition to mice
that were found dead, mice with weight loss exceeding 25% of their
highest body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead. Severity
of neurological signs was scored as described previously (Yoshii et al.,
2014). Signs of paralysis and loss of balance associated with viral
infection were scored as 0 (absent), 1 (present), or 2 (severe). Scoring
for paralysis was assigned as follows: 0, normal; 1, dragging limbs or in-
version of dorsum pedis; and 2, complete paralysis and no spontaneous
movement. Scoring for loss of balance was assigned as follows: 0, nor-
mal; 1, leaning of head or trunk posture to one side; and 2, inability to
retain posture and falling to one side or a circling movement to one
side. Total scores were quantified and were expressed as means ± the
standard errors of the mean.
2.4. ELISA Assay
Sera from the animals were collected every two weeks and tested for
ZIKV-specific IgG by conventional ELISA. Briefly, ELISA plates were coat-
ed with 2 × 105 pfu of heat-inactivated ZIKV DAKAR4542 at 60 °C for
20 min per well overnight at 4 °C in carbonate coating buffer
(100 mM, pH 9.5) and then blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween
20 (PBS-T) and 2% BSA for 1 h. Mouse sera were diluted 1:200 or 1:20
for pups sera in PBS-T with 1% BSA and incubated for 2 h. After the plates
were washed, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, Santacruz) was
added to each well and incubated for 1 h. The plates were washed three
times and developed with 3,3′5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, and the reac-
tion was stopped with 1 M H2SO4 and absorbance at 450 nm was deter-
mined using an ELISA reader (BIO-TEK instruments).
2.5. Plaque Reduction Neutralization Assay (PRNT)
To determine the plaque reduction neutralizing titer at week 6, 60 μl
of the pooled sera or 30 μl of each mouse sera was diluted in twofold se-
rial dilutions (from 1/16 to 1/516 or from 1/32 to 1/1024) and incubated
with 100 pfu of ZIKV DAKAR41542 in 100 μl of serum-free media at
37 °C for 1 h and subsequently added to a Vero cell monolayer at a den-
sity of 5 × 104 cells grown in six-well tissue culture plates and further
incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the inoculant was removed,
the semisolid media was added, and the plates were incubated for an
additional five days. Titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the
highest serum dilution still giving a 50% reduction in plaque number
(PRNT50) relative to samples incubated with pre-immunized control
pooled sera.

 Tukey's multiple comparison tests, and log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test were
performed using Graph Pad Prism version 5.0 software (San Diego, Cal-
ifornia, USA). Results were considered statistically significant when the
P value was b0.05. Symbols *, **, and *** are used to indicate P values of
b0.05, b0.01, and b0.001, respectively.
3. Results
We generated recombinant E1/E3-deleted adenovirus serotype 5-
based vectors that encode for the human secretory signal peptide hid-
den Markov model (SP-HMM) followed by the codon-optimized extra-
cellular portion of the ZIKV BeH815744 E gene fused to the T4 fibritin
foldon trimerization domain (ZIKV-Efl). Moreover, the ZIKV-Efl antigen
was engineered with a polyhistidine-tag and a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV)
protease cleavage sequence to facilitate downstream purification
(Fig. 1). The replication-defective adenovirus 5, designated as
Ad5.ZIKV-Efl, was generated by loxP homologous recombination as
previously described (Kim et al., 2014; Hardy et al., 1997). Recombinant
ZIKV-rEfl protein was purified from the supernatant of a Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-
infected HEK 293 cell line using His60 Ni Superflow Resin under native
conditions and packaged as a subunit vaccine in an MNA (MNA-ZIKV-
Efl).
We then tested the ability of Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl to
elicit a specific anti-ZIKV immune response in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were
inoculated s.c. with 1011vp of Ad5.ZIKV-Efl or i.d. with 20 μg of MNA-
ZIKV-rEfl, or with PBS on day 0 followed by booster immunization on
day 14 with the same dose i.n. or i.d., respectively (Fig. 2a). At 0, 2, 4,
and 6 weeks post prime immunization, sera were obtained from all
mice and screened for the presence of ZIKV-specific antibodies using
ELISA analysis. ZIKV-specific antibodies were detected as soon as two
weeks after the first immunization in the sera of mice vaccinated with
Ad5.ZIKV-Efl (P = 0.0002), while mice immunized MNA-ZIKV-rEfl
showed significant titers at four weeks after the booster immunization
(P b 0.05) when compared with the sera of mice immunized with PBS
(Fig. 2b).
Furthermore, qualitative neutralizing activity of ZIKV antibodies was
tested in a PRNT 50% assay. The presence of ZIKV-neutralizing antibod-
ies was shown in both Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl, although the
response in the mice immunized with MNA-ZIKV-rEfl was four- to 16-
fold lower than the response achieved in the mice immunized with
Ad5.ZIKV-Efl. As expected, no neutralizing antibody responses were ob-
served in the control animal group (Fig. 2c). These findings support our
premise that Ad5.ZIKV-Efl- and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-based ZIKV E antigen
vaccines are able to induce neutralizing ZIKV-specific immunity.
To further understand how the vaccine induced ZIKV E-specific
immunity, neutralizing the ZIKV in vivo and protecting the animal
from its pathogenic effects, we developed a passive protection suck-
ling mouse model. Building upon the knowledge (Dick et al., 1952)
that day 7- (but not day 14-) old suckling mice are susceptible to
ZIKV infection via the i.p. route showing neurological signs, pups
were obtained by mating immunized female with nonimmunized
male mice at week 3 after booster immunization. Pups were chal-
lenged i.p. at seven days after birth with 105 pfu of ZIKV
DAKAR41542, monitored daily for mortality, and weighed for
15 days. The mean time to disease onset (10% weight loss) was
slightly earlier in the pups from PBS-immunized mice than in those
from MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-immunized mice, although the difference was
not significant (7.75 vs. 8.25 days, P = 0.1598) (Table 1). All pups
born to PBS-immunized mice showed more than a 20% body weight
loss in the 10 days postinfection. However, weight loss in the MNA-
ZIKV-rEfl pups was reduced and a significant difference was found
from day 12 (P b 0.01; P b 0.001, day 13–day 15) after challenge
when compared to the PBS pups. No weight loss was observed in
the pups born to the dams immunized with Ad5.ZIKV-Efl vaccine
and no significant difference was measured between the pups of
Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-immunized mice and the unchallenged control pups
for the entire period. The significant difference started at day 8
(P b 0.01; P b 0.001, day 9–day 15) after challenge when compared
to the PBS pups. (Fig. 3a). The survival rates of pups from two ani-
mals in each group were also monitored after challenge with ZIKV
DAKAR41542. Survival rates of 100% (10/10) and 50% (3/6) were ob-
served in the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl- and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-immu-
nized dams, respectively, whereas a 12.5% (1/8) survival rate was
seen in pups from PBS-immunized dams (Fig. 3b). The differences
between the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl- and those from PBS-immu-
nized dams and between the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl- and those
from MNA-ZIKV-immunized dams were statistically significant
(P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0136, respectively). When the pups from
MNA-ZIKV-rEfl- and PBS-immunized dams were compared, no sig-
nificant difference in survival rate was observed (P = 0.1493), indi-
cating that the Ad5.ZIKV-Efl vaccine candidates were efficient in
passively protecting neonatal mice against lethal ZIKV challenge.
As expected, all pups of PBS-immunized dams showed neurological
signs including loss of balance, paresis, and hindlimb paralysis, with
4.62 ± 1.30 of neurological score. However, five out of six pups of
MNA-ZIKV-rEfl-immunized dams exhibited neurological illness (no
significant difference from the percentage of PBS group; P =
0.2482), although the neurological severity score was significantly
lower than that of pups from PBS-immunized mice (P b 0.05). In

 contrast, the pups from Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-immunized mice showed
mild symptoms at one time point or no signs of neurological illness
(Table 1).
Lastly, to detemine the relationship between survival rate and ma-
ternally-transferred antibody, the sera from 25-day-old non-challenged
pups born from immunized dams were collected and tested for reactiv-
ity with ZIKV by ELISA. The level of maternal IgG ZIKV-specific antibod-
ies measured in pups nursed by Ad5.ZIKV-Efl-immunized dams was
significantly higher than that in pups nursed by PBS-immunized dams
(P b 0.001). However, in the pups nursed by MNA-ZIKV-Efl-immunized
dams, the level of IgG antibodies against ZIKV-rEfl was not significantly
higher when compared with that in pups nursed by PBS-immunized
dams (Fig. S1). These data suggest that the survival rate in pups correlat-
ed with the maternally-transferred antibody IgG titer, and although
some of the animals immunized with MNA-ZIKV-Efl were protected,
the level of ZIKV-specific IgG transferred to the newborns was
suboptimal.
4. Discussion
In this study, we describe the construction and immunological eval-
uation of two ZIKV vaccine candidates. Our initial evaluations indicated
that the ZIKV vaccines Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl elicited a hu-
moral immune response in immunized C57BL/6 mice. The humoral

 response was characterized by high titers of antibodies to E antigen as
confirmed by ELISA, as well as neutralizing titers confirmed by PRNT50
assay. Importantly, in pups born to immunized dams, ZIKV-specific im-
munity was passively transferred and protected them from day 7 chal-
lenge of 105 pfu of the ZIKV DAKAR41542 strain.
The Ad5.ZIKV-Efl and MNA-ZIKV-rEfl vaccines were engineered
using the 2015 Brazil ZIKV strain BeH815744. The BeH815744 strain E
protein differs from the DAKAR41542 strain E protein used for challenge
in three amino acids (98% identity). In general, the ZIKV envelope pro-
tein is highly conserved.
Although in the presented studies the adenovirus-based Ad5.ZIKV-
Efl vaccine was the most potent of the two tested ZIKV vaccine candi-
dates, we acknowledge that is the least likely among the two candidates
to be translated into a clinical product. This is because the prevalence of
anti-adenovirus serotype 5-neutralizing antibodies in humans limits its
use as suitable clinical vaccine platform. However, the experimental use
of serotype 5 adenoviral-based vaccines, as shown in this study, is an in-
valuable tool for the antigen vaccine selection for any given pathogen.
Conversely, the MNA-delivered ZIKV vaccine MNA-ZIKV-rEfl, although
not optimized for inducing neutralizing immunity in the current format,
is a clinically applicable vaccine platform to target infectious diseases
such as ZIKV. The geometric design of the MNA-based vaccine platform
affords unique advantages for efficient delivery and targeting to the su-
perficial skin microenvironment, which is rich in antigen-presenting
cells. While immunogenicity was lower than that observed in a previ-
ously reported adjuvented and inactivated whole virus vaccine
(Larocca et al., 2016), the MNA-based vaccine offers the safety and clin-
ical advantages of a defined recombinant subunit antigen and the po-
tential for local co-delivery of adjuvants at very low doses. Co-delivery
of TLR ligand adjuvants at very low concentrations can substantially
increase the immunogenicity of an influenza subunit vaccine (Weldon
et al., 2012). Importantly, the fabrication process of MNAs affords
unique product advantages in reproducibility, safety, manufacturing,
and distribution critical for widespread clinical deployment. Thus, our
current and future efforts toward the clinical translation of ZIKV vaccine
are directed toward the testing and comparison of different E antigen
formats (dimeric vs. trimeric), and clinically relevant antigen-adjuvant
formats that can be co-delivered in MNAs.
One thing that we learned in the presented ZIKV vaccine studies is
that the yield of production of the ZIKV envelope E subunit protein
was very low in the current format. This finding, also confirmed by a re-
cently published ZIKV vaccine study (Larocca et al., 2016), is similar to
what was previously observed for other flaviviruses (Taylor et al.,
2016). The low yield of E protein is probably due to the absence of
preM, which is important for protein stability. For instance, expression
of WNV E protein alone showed proteolytic cleavage compared to the
E protein produced in the presence of preM (Taylor et al., 2016). Thus,
the inclusion of preM sequence seems to be an important prerequisite
in ZIKV E-based vaccine development. Importantly, in this study, we
used an immunocompetent mouse challenge model of ZIKV infection.
This approach was inspired by a 1952 publication (Dick et al., 1952) in
which ZIKV was shown to be pathogenic in newborn mice. Although
this model does not recapitulate the ZIKV pathogenesis observed in
humans, it is an effective model to evaluate the in vivo neutralizing ac-
tivity of vaccine-induced ZIKV immunity. During the conduct of these
experiments, many mouse models of ZIKV infection were established
in interferon receptor-deficient mice and SJL mice (Cugola et al., 2016;
Shah and Kumar, 2016; Miner et al., 2016; Dowall et al., 2016; Lazear
et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016). Further investigations in SJL mice, the
closest clinical model of fetal microcephaly, will be considered to evalu-
ate the efficiency of vaccine candidates here in the future.
