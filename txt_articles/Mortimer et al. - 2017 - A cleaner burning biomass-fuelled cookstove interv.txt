Summary
Background WHO estimates exposure to air pollution from cooking with solid fuels is associated with over 4 million 
premature deaths worldwide every year including half a million children under the age of 5 years from pneumonia. 
We hypothesised that replacing open fi
 res with cleaner burning biomass-fuelled cookstoves would reduce pneumonia 
incidence in young children.
Methods We did a community-level open cluster randomised controlled trial to compare the eff
 ects of a cleaner 
burning biomass-fuelled cookstove intervention to continuation of open fi
 re cooking on pneumonia in children living 
in two rural districts, Chikhwawa and Karonga, of Malawi. Clusters were randomly allocated to intervention and 
control groups using a computer-generated randomisation schedule with stratifi
 cation by site, distance from health 
centre, and size of cluster. Within clusters, households with a child under the age of 4·5 years were eligible. 
Intervention households received two biomass-fuelled cookstoves and a solar panel. The primary outcome was WHO 
Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI)-defi
 ned pneumonia episodes in children under 5 years of age. 
Effi
  cacy and safety analyses were by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN59448623.
Findings We enrolled 10 750 children from 8626 households across 150 clusters between Dec 9, 2013, and Feb 28, 2016. 
10 543 children from 8470 households contributed 15 991 child-years of follow-up data to the intention-to-treat 
analysis. The IMCI pneumonia incidence rate in the intervention group was 15·76 (95% CI 14·89–16·63) per 
100 child-years and in the control group 15·58 (95% CI 14·72–16·45) per 100 child-years, with an intervention versus 
control incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1·01 (95% CI 0·91–1·13; p=0·80). Cooking-related serious adverse events (burns) 
were seen in 19 children; nine in the intervention and ten (one death) in the control group (IRR 0·91 [95% CI 
0·37–2·23]; p=0·83). 
Interpretation We found no evidence that an intervention comprising cleaner burning biomass-fuelled cookstoves 
reduced the risk of pneumonia in young children in rural Malawi. Eff
 ective strategies to reduce the adverse health 
eff
 ects of household air pollution are needed.

Introduction
Almost half of the world’s population, including 
700 million Africans, rely on biomass fuels for cooking 
(eg, animal dung, crop residues, wood, and charcoal).1–3 
Although a billion people in sub-Saharan Africa are 
projected to gain access to electricity by 2040, 530 million 
will remain dependent on biomass fuels.4 Biomass fuel is 
typically burned in open fi
 res, often indoors, leading to 
high levels of household air pollution from smoke. 
Women and children experience high exposures in and 
around the home due to gender-based domestic roles 
and these exposures have been linked to a range of 
adverse health outcomes, including chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease, 
asthma, and pneumonia.1–3 Household air pollution from 
biomass fuel smoke is a leading cause of global disability 
and mortality with over 4 million deaths attributed to this 
exposure annually by WHO.3,5 This burden, including 
about half a million deaths due to pneumonia in young 
children, falls disproportionately on the poor, especially 
in sub-Saharan Africa. In Malawi, pneumonia is a 
leading cause of mortality among children younger than 
5 years of age.6,7 Over 95% of households depend on 
biomass for fuel and household air pollution levels are 
high and well beyond WHO safe limits.8,9 A substantial 
burden of pneumonia in young children might be 
attributable to biomass smoke exposure in this setting. 
Two trials to assess the eff
 ects of interventions to 
reduce exposure to biomass smoke on health outcomes 
have been published to date.10,11 Both trials used stoves

that reduce exposure mainly by venting emissions to 
the outdoor environment with a chimney rather than 
by improving combustion effi
  ciency. Romieu and 
colleagues10 compared a Patsari stove intervention with 
the traditional open fi
 re on respiratory symptoms and 
lung function in 552 women in Mexico. Adherence to 
the intervention was poor but the Patsari stove reduced 
respiratory symptoms (eg, rate ratio [RR] 0·29 [95% CI 
0·11–0·77] for wheeze) and lung function decline (31 mL 
vs 62 mL over 1 year; p=0·01) in those who used the 
stove. The RESPIRE trial randomised 534 households 
with a pregnant woman or infant in highland Guatemala 
to a Plancha stove (with good compliance) or open fi
 re 
and assessed the impact on pneumonia in children 
younger than 19 months.11 In intention-to-treat analyses 
the Plancha gave a non-signifi
 cant reduction in incidence 
of physician-diagnosed pneumonia (primary outcome) 
(RR 0·84 [95% CI 0·63–1·13]; p=0·26; after multiple 
imputation to adjust for higher referral compliance 
among intervention homes, RR 0·78 [0·59–1·06]; 
p=0·10) and a signifi
 cant reduction in physician-
diagnosed severe pneumonia (RR 0·67 [0·45–0·98]; 
p=0·04). There was a 50% reduction in personal child 
exposures (measured by carbon monoxide) but this 
improvement still left exposure levels well above WHO 
recommended limits.11 Cleaner burning biomass-fuelled 
cookstoves are now available that improve combustion 
effi
  ciency by incorporating technologies (eg, electric fans 
and gasifi
 er re-burning of evolved gases) that lead to a 
substantial, up to 90%, reduction in emissions in 
laboratory testing.12 
Access to cleaner cooking fuels and technologies is 
limited by many factors in the developing world 
although poverty is a key underlying issue for most.13 
The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (GACC) was 
launched in 2010 to tackle the lack of access to clean 
aff
 ordable energy through public–private partnerships. 
A central aim of GACC is for 100 million homes to 
adopt clean cookstoves and fuels by 2020.14 However, 
there is limited evidence to assess the potential health 
benefi
 ts of such an approach: globally there are no data 
from clinical trials of cleaner burning biomass-fuelled 
interventions and in Africa there are no data from 
clinical trials of any cookstove interventions.3 We set out 
to determine whether a cleaner burning biomass-fuelled 
cookstove intervention would reduce pneumonia 
incidence in children under 5 years of age living in rural 
Malawi compared with continuation of traditional open 
fi
 re cooking (see video). 
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a cluster randomised controlled trial with 
two groups of equal size comparing the eff
 ects of a 
cleaner burning biomass-fuelled cookstove intervention 
with continued use of open fi
 re cooking on pneumonia 
incidence in children under 5 years of age living in rural 
Malawi over a 2 year period (the Cooking and Pneumonia 
Study, CAPS). We defi
 ned 150 community-level clusters 
within villages across two districts of Malawi where we 
had established fi
 eld research sites: Chikhwawa in the 
southern Shire river valley and Karonga on the northern 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Results of two trials assessing the eff
 ects of interventions to 
reduce exposure to biomass smoke on health outcomes were 
published before this study. Both tested stoves that reduce 
exposure mainly by venting emissions to the outdoor 
environment via a chimney rather than by improving 
combustion effi
  ciency. Romieu and colleagues compared a 
chimney stove intervention with traditional open fi
 re on 
respiratory symptoms and lung function in 552 women in 
Mexico. Adherence to the intervention was poor but the 
chimney stove reduced respiratory symptoms and lung 
function decline in those who used the stove. The RESPIRE trial 
randomised 534 households with a pregnant woman or infant 
in highland Guatemala to a chimney stove (with good 
compliance) or open fi
 re and assessed the impact on 
pneumonia in children younger than 19 months. In 
intention-to-treat analyses, there was a non-signifi
 cant 
reduction in incidence of physician-diagnosed pneumonia 
(primary outcome) in the chimney stove group (rate ratio [RR] 
0·84 [95% CI 0·63–1·13]; p=0·26) and a signifi
 cant reduction in 
physician-diagnosed severe pneumonia (RR 0·67 [0·45–0·98]; 
p=0·04).
Added value of this study
This trial is the largest study of the eff
 ects of a 
biomass-fuelled cookstove intervention on health outcomes 
to date. The trial was done in very resource-poor populations 
in rural Malawi where pneumonia is one of the leading causes 
of morbidity and mortality in young children and almost all 
households burn biomass fuels for cooking. Data from 
10 543 children from 8470 households across 
150 community-level clusters contributed 15 991 child-years 
of follow-up data to the intention-to-treat analysis. The 
intervention comprising two biomass-fuelled cookstoves, a 
solar charger, repair and maintenance service, and user 
training had no eff
 ect on the risk of pneumonia in children 
under the age of 5 years in rural Malawi.
Implications of all the available evidence
There is insuffi
  cient evidence on which to recommend replacing 
open fi
 res with biomass-fuelled cookstoves for the prevention 
of pneumonia in young children in settings where biomass 
fuels are burned in open fi
 res for cooking.

Malawi lakeshore. The Malawi College of Medicine 
Research Ethics Committee (ethics committee reference 
number P.11/12/1308) and the Liverpool School of 
Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee (ethics 
committee reference number 12.40) approved the 
protocol, which was peer reviewed, and a summary was 
published by The Lancet.15
Following community engagement exercises with 
village leaders and communities and the identifi
 cation of 
a representative for each cluster, households with at least 
one child aged up to 4·5 years were invited to participate. 
Written informed consent (or witnessed thumbprint for 
those unable to read and write) was obtained at cluster 
and household level (parent or guardian of child) before 
participation. The trial was open to all consenting 
households with a usually resident child in the eligible 
age range. Households that became eligible for inclusion 
during the course of the trial (through birth, adoption, or 
in-migration) were recruited until 6 months before the 
trial ended.
Randomisation and masking
Clusters were randomly allocated to intervention 
and control groups using a computer-generated random-
isation schedule with stratifi
 cation by site, distance from 
health centre, and size of cluster. Randomisation was 
done by the trial statistician using dummy codes A and B 
to represent intervention and control groups; to ensure 
the statistician remained masked, the identity (allocation) 
of A and B was determined by a second, independent 
statistician. The trial statistician used a dummy 
randomisation code to develop statistical programs for 
data analyses before unblinding the trial data. 
Procedures
Intervention households received two cleaner burning 
biomass-fuelled cookstoves (Philips HD4012LS; Philips 
South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa), a solar panel 
to charge the battery for the stove fan, and user training. 
A fan incorporated into these cookstoves improves 
combustion effi
  ciency; smoke emissions have been 
found to be reduced by around 90% compared with the 
open fi
 re in laboratory testing.12 Cookstoves were repaired 
and replaced as needed. Stove use monitors were placed 
on one of the stoves in a randomly selected 10% sample 
of intervention households at baseline and at the 
12 month visit to provide an objective measure of use, by 
recording temperature fl
 uctuations. Control households 
continued using traditional cooking methods (typically 
open fi
 res). At the start of the trial control households 
were informed they would receive the intervention at the 
end of the study period for equity and to maximise 
retention. Each household was visited every 3 months by 
fi
 eldworkers although by the time the 21 month visit was 
due we were 3 months behind schedule and as such 
moved directly on to the fi
 nal 24 month visit. Community 
engagement events were done regularly across all 
clusters to maintain engagement, facilitate discussion, 
and troubleshoot. 
Outcomes 
The primary outcome was the incidence of WHO 
Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI)-
defi
 ned pneumonia in children under 5 years of age 
diagnosed by physicians, medical offi
  cers, or other 
appropriately trained staff
  at local health-care facilities 
routinely accessed by trial participants, unaware of 
intervention allocation.16
Secondary outcomes were the incidence of all 
pneumonia including those not meeting IMCI criteria, 
severe pneumonia, and death in children under 5 years 
of age. Additional outcomes included: the association 
between exposure to household air pollution and the 
development of pneumonia in children under 5 years of 
age in rural Malawi; prevalence and determinants of 
obstructive lung disease in adults in rural Malawi and the 
relationship between exposure to household air pollution 
and the rate of decline in lung function in adults in rural 
Malawi; aff
 ordability and cost-eff
 ectiveness of the 
intervention from household, health-care system, and 
societal perspectives; and what can be learned from trial 
participants and non-participants about adoption of the 
intervention that could inform eff
 ective implementation 
of the trial fi
 ndings in the future. The fi
 ndings of these 
additional outcomes will be reported separately.
We provided training and equipment including 
respiratory rate timers, thermometers, and pulse 
oximeters to support local health services in delivering 
high quality clinical assessments and documentation of 
pneumonia diagnoses and severity assessments.17 A 
supply of antibiotics was provided when local health 
service stocks ran out. 
The IMCI pneumonia assessment protocol was used 
because chest radiographs were not consistently available 
and were not part of the usual diagnostic work-up in rural 
Malawi. Non-severe IMCI pneumonia was defi
 ned as the 
presence of cough or diffi
  culty breathing and fast breathing 
(60, 50, or 40 breaths per min or higher in those aged 
<2 months, 2–12 months, and 1–5 years, respectively). 
Severe IMCI pneumonia was defi
 ned additionally by chest 
in-drawing, stridor, or any general danger sign (inability to 
drink or breastfeed, vomiting, convulsions, lethargy, or 
unconsciousness). Oxygen saturation of less than 90% was 
included as an additional and objective marker of severity. 
In Malawi there is a patient-held medical record system. 
Patients present their Malawi Ministry of Health and 
Population health passport whenever they seek medical 
care. All trial participants were provided with a new health 
passport if they did not already have one with suffi
  cient 
blank pages. A sticker was inserted explaining that the 
child was in the trial; a brief summary of the IMCI 
pneumonia assessment protocol; and boxes to tick about 
clinical criteria and severity if the patient was diagnosed 
with pneumonia. Malaria was tested with a rapid

diagnostic test and treated as indicated, as part of routine 
clinical practice. During or after the attendance, the trial 
team was notifi
 ed about diagnoses of pneumonia and 
deaths by text or phone call from health facility based staff
  
or a member of the household using a phone and airtime 
credit provided to each CAPS cluster representative. 
Fieldworkers reviewed and captured digital images of 
the health passports of all children in the trial at visits 
every 3 months to obtain information about episodes of 
pneumonia and deaths not otherwise reported. Electronic 
case report forms programmed using Open Data Kit 
(ODK; 
Department 
of 
Computer 
Science 
and 
Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 
USA) software and administered by smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S3) were used to collect these data. 
Data were transferred from smartphones to a secure 
server at each study site, checked, uploaded to a database, 
cleaned, and then relayed onwards to a central secure 
server in preparation for analysis. Source document 
verifi
 cation was done for every case of pneumonia using 
digital images of health records as source documents by 
a single member of the study team, the methodology for 
which was reviewed and approved at a Pan African 
Thoracic Society meeting in Malawi in July, 2016.18
Data about cooking-related adverse events were 
collected at fi
 eld visits every 3 months. Adverse events 
that met seriousness criteria (death, life-threatening, led 
to hospitalisation or prolongation of an existing hospital-
isation, or led to disability or incapacity) were reported 
immediately to the trial coordinating centre for 
assessment of causality, seriousness, and expectedness, 
and for appropriate medical action and onward reporting 
to be arranged. An independent data monitoring 
committee reviewed all potentially cooking-related 
serious adverse events. 
Statistical analysis
We aimed to include 150 clusters representing an 
estimated 10 600 eligible children. Clusters were 
randomised in equal numbers to two intervention groups 
to provide, over the whole study period, about 21 200 child-
years of follow-up and 90·3% power to detect a reduction 
in the rate of pneumonia from fi
 ve per 100 child-years in 
the control group to four per 100 child-years in the 
intervention group (proportionally, a 20% reduction). This 
conservative estimate of incidence was used to allow for 
potential reductions in the rate of pneumonia following 
pneumococcal vaccine introduction. We assumed an 
eff
 ective intra-cluster correlation (ICC) of 0·10 and a 
coeffi
  cient of variation in cluster size of 30–35%. Full 
sample size considerations are available online.
All primary analyses used intention-to-treat principles; 
the intention-to-treat population was all participants with 
at least one follow-up record before reaching 5 years of 
age. Secondary per-protocol analyses were also done; the 
per-protocol 
population 
included 
all 
participants 
54 months of age or younger at recruitment and, in the 
intervention group, participants from households with at 
least one follow-up record at which stove use was 
reported.

modelling methods were used to assess the primary 
outcome, adjusting for clustering eff
 ects. Covariate 
adjusted analysis was done on the primary outcome by 
adding the following prespecifi
 ed variables into the above 
GEE model: district, age of child at recruitment, sex, 
distance to nearest health centre, number of children 
younger than 5 years living in household, number of 
people in household who smoke regularly, other sources 
of fi
 re or smoke (other than cooking) to which child was 
exposed on a daily (or almost daily) basis, socioeconomic 
status of household, number of previous pneumonia 
episodes experienced by child, and status of childhood 
vaccinations. 
Secondary 
outcomes 
were 
analysed 
similarly using GEE models; time to event data were 
analysed using Cox regression model with frailty for the 
cluster eff
 ect. One masked interim safety analysis was 
done and reviewed by the data monitoring committee to 
determine whether there were grounds to stop the trial 
for safety. Provision for an interim analysis for effi
  cacy 
was included in the protocol although was not required 
by the data monitoring committee. SAS statistical 
package (version 9.3) was used. The full peer-reviewed 
statistical analysis plan is available online. The study is 
registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN59448623.

Results
We enrolled 10 750 children from 8626 households across 
150 community-level clusters in two sites in rural Malawi 
between Dec 9, 2013, and Feb 28, 2016. 207 children were 
lost to follow-up (103 from the intervention group and 
104 from the control group) from 156 households (83 in 
the intervention group and 73 in the control group) 
between baseline and fi
 rst follow-up visit (fi
 gure). Data 
were therefore available from 10 543 children (5297 in the 
intervention group and 5246 in the control group) from 
8470 households (4256 in the intervention group and 
4214 in the control group) for at least one follow-up visit 
and form the intention-to-treat and safety dataset 
(fi
 gure). Baseline characteristics were balanced between 
intervention and control groups (table 1). There were 
15 991 child-years of follow-up (7964 child-years from the 
intervention group and 8027 child-years from the control 
group). The last participant follow-up visit was on 
Sept 14, 2016.
We excluded 47 children (21 in the intervention group 
and 26 in the control group) because they were aged over 
54 months at recruitment and 25 children from 
intervention households due to self-reported never use of 
the intervention to create the per-protocol population. 
The per-protocol population was therefore 10 471 children 
(5251 in the intervention group and 5220 in the control 
group) from 8429 households (4224 in the intervention 
group and 4205 in the control group). 
There were 2506 episodes of IMCI pneumonia in the 
overall 
intention-to-treat 
population 
(1255 
in 
the 
intervention group and 1251 in the control group) giving 
an incidence rate of 15·67 (95% CI 15·06–16·28) per 
100 child-years. The incidence rate in the intervention 
group was 15·76 (95% CI 14·89–16·63) per 100 child-years 
and in the control group 15·58 (95% CI 14·72–16·45) per 
100 child-years, with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1·01

(95% CI 0·91–1·13; p=0·80). The estimated ICC was 0·03. 
After adjustment for baseline values, the IRR for IMCI 
pneumonia for the intervention versus control was 1·05 
(95% CI 0·93–1·18; p=0·44). The incidence rate for IMCI 
pneumonia in the overall per-protocol population was 
15·70 (95% CI 15·09–16·32) per 100 child-years with an 
intervention versus control IRR of 1·02 (95% CI 0·91–1·14; 
p=0·77). The hazard ratio for time from enrolment to fi
 rst 
pneumonia episode in the intervention versus control 
group was 1·06 (95% CI 0·93–1·21; p=0·29). The 
incidence rate for all pneumonia episodes including those 
not meeting IMCI criteria was 17·21 (95% CI 16·57–17·85) 
per 100 child-years with an intervention versus control 
IRR of 1·02 (95% CI 0·91–1·13; p=0·75).
In the intervention versus control group the IRR for 
severe pneumonia episodes defi
 ned by IMCI criteria was 
1·30 (0·99–1·71; p=0·06), for oxygen saturation less than 
90% 1·56 (0·70–3·46; p=0·28), and for death 0·76 
(0·17–3·37; p=0·71; table 2). A rapid diagnostic test for 
malaria was done at the time of IMCI pneumonia 
diagnosis in 1547 cases, of which 473 (30·6%) were positive.
At the fi
 rst (3 months), 12, and 24 month follow-up 
visits, 73·3% (2535 of 3457), 59·0% (1889 of 3204), and 
49·8% (1414 of 2841) of intervention households, 
respectively, reported that the cookstoves met all their 
cooking needs. Most households that answered an 
optional follow-up question reported using the stoves for 
at least one meal a day on average over the 2 years of 
follow up (table 3). The most common reason given for 
not using the cookstoves for all cooking tasks was that 
the cookstoves had malfunctioned; battery failures were 
particularly common. We placed 364 stove use monitors 
on one of the two cookstoves in households selected for 
this sub-study from which 537 (36·9%) of a potential 
1456 sets of usable data were obtained during year 1 and 
498 (45·6%) of a potential 1092 sets for year 2. The mean 
number of cooking events per day for the monitored 
cookstove was 0·51 (SD 0·55) during year 1 and 0·34 
(0·40) during year 2. Over the course of the trial, repairs 
or replacements were done on 13 192 (3·1 per intervention 
household) occasions for cookstoves and 5259 (1·2 per 
intervention household) occasions for solar panels. 
Control households were provided with two advanced 
cookstoves (ACE-1; African Clean Energy Company, 
Maseru, Lesotho) with a solar charger and solar lamp 
(part of the standard cookstove package by this time) at 
the end of the trial.
596 serious adverse events were reported excluding 
pneumonia. With the exception of a borderline 
statistically signifi
 cant increased risk of malaria in the 
intervention group (IRR 1·32 [95% CI 1·03–1·69]; 
p=0·03) there were no diff
 erences in incidence rates of 
serious adverse events between the intervention and 
control groups (table 4). Of these, 19 (nine in the 
intervention group and ten in the control group) were 
cooking-related burns (IRR 0·91 [95% CI 0·37–2·23]; 
p=0·83). Additionally, 1505 burns (549 in the intervention 
group and 956 in the control group) not meeting 
seriousness criteria were reported (IRR 0·58 [95% CI 
0·51–0·65]; p<0·0001). There were 53 deaths (malaria 
[14], pneumonia [seven], sepsis [fi
 ve], malnutrition [fi
 ve], 
accidental injury [four], gastroenteritis [one], burns [one], 
and other or unknown [16]) from the time of enrolment, 
44 (25 in the intervention group and 19 in the control 
group) of which occurred in the intention-to-treat 
population (IRR 1·32 [95% CI 0·73–2·40]; p=0·36). The 
data monitoring committee reviewed trial safety data in 
March, 2015, and found no grounds to stop the trial early. 
Discussion
This community-level cluster randomised controlled 
trial in Malawi is the largest trial of a cookstove 
intervention on health outcomes to date. Malawi is one 
of the world’s poorest countries and within particularly 
impoverished rural areas it is frequent for households to 
have insuffi
  cient money at times to buy basic items like 
soap or food for their normal meals. The intention-to-
treat analysis included data from 10 543 children from 
8470 households across 150 community-level clusters

representing 15 991 child-years of follow-up data. The 
number of children included was close to our original 
sample size estimate of 10 600 although the total follow-
up time was less than the estimated 21 200 child-years. 
The incidence rate of IMCI pneumonia was high (15·67 
per 100 child-years) and about three times higher than 
the deliberately conservative assumption used for our 
sample size calculation (fi
 ve per 100 child-years). The 
observed incidence rate was more in agreement with 
2010 estimates of IMCI pneumonia incidence in Malawi 
(24·3 per 100 child-years).19 Baseline characteristics were 
well balanced between the intervention and control 
groups. The intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses 
with and without adjustment for baseline data were 
consistent in fi
 nding no eff
 ect of the intervention on the 
incidence of IMCI pneumonia in the young children in 
the study. Although limited by a smaller number of 
cases, analyses restricted to severe pneumonia episodes 
similarly found no benefi
 cial eff
 ect of the intervention. 
The intervention comprised a package of two cleaner 
burning 
biomass-fuelled 
cookstoves 
to 
provide 
two cooking hobs, a solar charger for the battery in the 
cookstove, a repair and replacement service, and user 
training. The intervention cookstove was selected on the 
basis of being among the cleanest burning biomass-
fuelled cookstoves available at the time we designed the 
trial, with 90% lower emissions than open fi
 res in 
laboratory tests.12 The repair and replacement service was 
heavily used, with each intervention household requiring 
this service four times on average over the course of the 
trial. The high rate of cookstove and solar charger 
malfunction was surprising since these products had 
been specifi
 cally designed and developed for the 
indications, end users, and environments in which we 
assessed them. Failure of the rechargeable lead acid 
batteries in the cookstoves was a particularly common 
problem requiring replacement of the batteries. This issue 
could have been largely avoided had the cookstoves had 
better quality batteries. Cookstove malfunction was the 
most common reason given by households for not using 
the cookstoves for all cooking needs. Although we did 
repairs and replacements as quickly as possible there were 
inevitably short periods when households only had one 
functioning cookstove. When this alone was not suffi
  cient 
for all cooking needs the household would have had to 
revert to using the open fi
 re. Nevertheless, and despite 
these challenges, self-reported use of the cookstoves was 
probably as high as could be realistically expected with 
three-quarters of intervention households reporting the 
use of the stoves for all their cooking needs at 3 months, 
reducing to about half of households after 2 years; as is 
true in kitchens around the world there is no single 
cooking device suitable for every task. 
We included stove use monitors on one of two cookstoves 
in a subset of intervention households to provide an 
objective measure of use. Although these monitors 
generated less usable data than anticipated due to 
technical problems, and their presence on just one of the 
two stoves might have aff
 ected which stove was used, they 
similarly indicate a waning in use over time. The impact 
on pneumonia in children might have been greater had 
adoption of the intervention been higher but the levels of 
adoption we achieved are probably higher than would be 
the case outside the context of a trial, particularly if 
an intensive and free repair and replacement service was 
not available. 
Baseline data showed that in addition to almost exclusive 
use of biomass fuels for cooking, exposure to smoke from 
other sources including burning of rubbish, tobacco, and 
income generation activities was a common day-to-day 
experience. Additionally, as cookstoves were only issued to 
households that had a resident child younger than 5 years, 
exposure to smoke from neighbours’ or relatives’ cooking 
fi
 res is likely. It is thus possible that these other air 
pollution exposures would have negated any potential 
benefi
 cial impact of the cookstove intervention and that 
had even cleaner burning cookstoves been used, they 
would be unlikely to have had an impact. Personal 
exposure and exposure-response data, to be published 
separately, will provide additional insights here.

There was a high incidence of serious adverse events 
unrelated to cooking across the trial population refl
 ecting 
the expected range and frequency of serious childhood 
illnesses seen in rural Malawi. There was a borderline 
statistically signifi
 cant increased risk of malaria in the 
intervention versus the control group, which might be a 
false positive fi
 nding refl
 ecting multiplicity of secondary 
safety analyses. Data from elsewhere suggest smoke 
from open fi
 re cooking is unlikely to protect against 
malaria vectors.20 Nevertheless, this is an area of 
uncertainty and this observation warrants further 
investigation. Serious adverse events related to cooking 
(all burns) resulted in considerable morbidity and one 
death in our study population. Less serious burns were a 
common occurrence with 508 (4·8%) of 10 543 children 
reporting a burn in the 3 months before study enrolment 
and 1505 burns not meeting seriousness criteria reported 
during the study. Although serious burns were evenly 
distributed across the trial groups, there was a substantial 
42% reduction (IRR 0·58 [95% CI 0·51–0·65]; p<0·0001) 
in risk of non-serious burns in the intervention group, 
suggesting the intervention off
 ers considerable safety 
advantages over the open fi
 re. 
The fi
 ndings of our trial add substantially to the trials 
of chimney stoves in Mexico (552 women followed up for 
10 months) and Guatemala (518 children from 
534 households contributing 560 child-years of follow-
up).10,11 Although none found a statistically signifi
 cant 
eff
 ect on the primary health outcome of interest, all point 
to benefi
 ts of the interventions in secondary analyses—
there was a reduction in burns in Malawi, a reduction in 
respiratory symptoms, and decline in lung function in 
adults in a per-protocol analysis of intervention adopters 
in Mexico, and a reduction in severe acute lower 
respiratory tract infections in Guatemala. 
Although the design of our trial was necessarily open, 
considerable eff
 ort was put into minimising the risk of 
bias associated with a non-blinded study. Specifi
 cally, we 
provided training to fi
 eldworkers to ensure participants 
were treated in the same way irrespective of trial group; 
scheduled the same frequency of fi
 eld visits to intervention 
and control villages; collected primary outcome data in the 
same way for intervention and control villages; provided 
training to local health-care workers about how to make 
an IMCI diagnosis of pneumonia, the importance of 
carrying out assessments, and treatment based on clinical 
need and without enquiring about trial allocation to 
achieve blinded assessment of the primary outcome; and 
did blinded independent source document verifi
 cation for 
all pneumonia diagnoses. The trial was done in a 
challenging environment where poverty is widespread 
and health services are stretched. We used the widely 
adopted WHO IMCI diagnostic criteria for pneumonia 
implemented by independent health-care workers because 
this approach is most refl
 ective of the reality on the 
ground where access to more sophisticated diagnostic 
tools such as chest radiographs are not consistently 
available. Although this pragmatic approach might lack 
specifi
 city, it is the best measure of the entity reported as 
pneumonia and associated with morbidity and mortality 
among children under 5 years of age in Malawi and 
elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. 
In conclusion, we found no evidence of a reduction in 
pneumonia in young Malawian children in a rigorously 
conducted clinical trial of a cleaner burning biomass-
fuelled cookstove intervention. The lack of eff
 ect on 
pneumonia might be explained by exposure to other 
sources of air pollution, including rubbish burning and 
tobacco smoke, that could have overwhelmed any 
potential eff
 ects of the cookstoves. It is also possible that 
the cookstoves used simply did not reduce emissions 
suffi
  ciently to have an eff
 ect. An important implication of 
these observations is that tackling any individual source 
of air pollution exposure in isolation is unlikely to be 
eff
 ective for improving health; an integrated approach to 
achieving clean air that tackles rubbish disposal, tobacco 
smoking, and other exposures, as well as robust cleaner 
cooking solutions (eg, cleaner stoves and fuels) that 
achieve a high rate of acceptance is probably needed to 
deliver health benefi
