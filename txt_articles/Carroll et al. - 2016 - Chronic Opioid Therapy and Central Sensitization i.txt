Chronic opioid therapy (COT) for chronic non-cancer pain is frequently debated, and its effectiveness
is unproven in sickle cell disease (SCD). The authors conducted a descriptive study among 83 adult
SCD patients and compared the severity of disease and pain symptoms among those who were
prescribed COT (n¼29) with those who were not using COT. All patients completed baseline
laboratory pain assessment and questionnaires between January 2010 and June 2014. Thereafter,
participants recorded daily pain, crises, function, and healthcare utilization for 90 days using electronic
diaries. Analyses were conducted shortly after the final diary data collection period. Patients on COT
did not differ on age, sex, or measures of disease severity. However, patients on COT exhibited greater
levels of clinical pain (particularly non-crisis); central sensitization; and depression and increased diary
measures of pain severity, function, and healthcare utilization on crisis and non-crisis diary days, as
well as a greater proportion of days in crisis. Including depressive symptoms in multivariate models
did not change the associations between COT and pain, interference, central sensitization, or
utilization. Additionally, participants not on COT displayed the expected positive relationship between
central sensitization and clinical pain, whereas those on COT demonstrated no such relationship,
despite having both higher central sensitization and higher clinical pain. Overall, the results point out a
high symptom burden in SCD patients on COT, including those on high-dose COT, and suggest that
nociceptive processing in SCD patients on COT differs from those who are not.

Introduction
S
ickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of autosomal
recessive hematologic diseases, rare in the U.S.,
linked to the hemoglobin beta S allele.1,2 In the
U.S., the disease is heavily concentrated in people of
African descent.3,4 The clinical hallmark of SCD is the
painful crisis, sometimes called a vaso-occlusive crisis
(VOC). VOCs are characterized by severe pain, in variable
locations, lacking any clear objective signs of etiology.5
The pathophysiology of VOC is complex and still remark-
ably poorly understood, but involves interactions among
activated endothelium, malformed “sickled” red blood
cells, both chronic and acute inflammatory processes, and
the nervous system.6–17 Patients experiencing VOC are at
increased risk for subsequent acute chest syndrome or
stroke, both potentially life-threatening complications.18
The medical literature for some time used acute care
visits for VOC as a proxy measure for the pain burden of
SCD.12,19,20 However, many adults with SCD have a high
burden of chronic pain as well.21 The mechanisms of
chronic pain in SCD are likely varied, and both preclin-
ical and human studies suggest that abnormal sensitiza-
tion of the peripheral and central nervous system plays a
role.16,17,22–25 Some complications of SCD, such as
avascular necrosis of bone, are independently painful,
and accumulation of such complications contributes to
the burden of chronic pain.26,27
Clinicians attempting to alleviate chronic pain in
patients with SCD have limited evidence to guide
management. Chronic opioid therapy (COT) is often
used, although its long-term efficacy is not established in
SCD. Even in common non-cancer pain conditions,
rigorous long-term studies of COT are lacking.28,29

 Open-label follow-up and cross-sectional studies of long-
term COT suggest modest effects. Many patients report
continued severe pain, reduced function, high levels of
distress, and a great deal of disability,28–33 and many do
not remain on COT.30 Both COT and chronic pain are
associated with the diagnosis of major depressive dis-
order as well, which may exacerbate the unpleasantness
of noxious stimuli and contribute to poor outcomes.34–36
Some painful conditions can worsen with COT.37–39
Many multidisciplinary pain centers explicitly use opioid
reduction or cessation as a technique in rehabilitation
with documented improvements in pain severity and
function.40–45 This has remained unexplored in SCD but
might be more complicated given the unique mixture of
acute and chronic pain, as well as the greater risk of
physiologic stress from opioid withdrawal.
Central sensitization (CS), nociceptive hyperexcitabil-
ity that amplifies and maintains clinical pain, recently has
been hypothesized to play a role in SCD pain.17,22,23,25,46
The relationship between COT and CS remains poorly
understood, though some work has suggested that
opioids both induce CS47–52 and can reverse it in certain
circumstances.53,54 It is unknown whether improvements
in pain observed from opioid reduction are associated
with normalization of CS processes.
This study is part of a larger project designed to define
relevant mechanistic and clinical pain phenotypes in
patients with SCD. Here, the authors report a descriptive
study of 83 adult SCD patients, comparing severity of
disease and pain symptoms among those who were
prescribed COT (n=29) with those who were not using
COT (n=54). All patients completed baseline laboratory
pain assessment and questionnaires between January
2010 and June 2014. Thereafter, participants recorded
daily pain, crises, function, and healthcare utilization for
90 days using electronic diaries. It was hypothesized that
COT would be associated with greater daily pain, poorer
functioning, and greater healthcare utilization. In addi-
tion to these primary aims, this study evaluated whether
central sensitization, as measured using standardized
laboratory techniques, moderated the expected associa-
tion between COT group and clinical pain in SCD.
Methods
Participants were recruited for participation from the Sickle Cell
Center for Adults at Johns Hopkins Hospital or through posted
advertisements. The study and its methods were approved by a
Johns Hopkins IRB.
Participants and Recruitment
Participants were adults (aged Z18 years) with SCD (genotype
confirmed by laboratory testing or study hematologist); adequate
facility with the English language; and on a stable dose
of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, or
opioids for 1 month prior to pain testing (if any). Participants
were recruited from an adult SCD clinic with a stable census
of approximately 541 active patients. At the time of submission,
active patients in the clinic are 58.1% female, with a mean age
of 36.0 (SD=11.8) years, and 63.2% of patients have the SS
genotype.
Individuals with a significant cognitive impairment; severe or
unstable psychiatric illness; active substance abuse; current infec-
tion; diagnosis of certain autoimmune disorders; HIV infection
with neuropathy; or currently pregnant, lactating, or attempting to
become pregnant within 6 months were excluded. Eighty-three
participants (15.3% of the clinic) with SCD provided informed
consent; enrolled in the parent study; and were included in these
analyses.
Study Procedures
Initial telephone screening ensured eligibility criteria were met. At
the baseline visit, participants completed a standardized laboratory
pain testing protocol and study instruments as well as self-report
questionnaires for data not readily available via medical records,
such as educational attainment. Participants attended the baseline
visit when their pain was typical SCD pain, it was of no greater
intensity on a verbal numerical rating scale than 5/10, and there
had been no VOCs in at least the previous 3 weeks. At the
conclusion of the baseline visit, participants were trained on the
use of a daily electronic diary, which was used to capture daily pain
data over the following 90 days. Quantitative sensory testing (QST)
data were collected between January 2010 and June 2014, and
analyses were conducted shortly after the final diary data collection
period.
Measures
Participants reported age, sex, and educational level, which was
dichotomized as “some college or more” and “no college.”
Self-reported least, worst, average, and current clinical pain
severity for the week prior to testing was rated on an 11-point
numerical rating scale, similar to that used for the Brief Pain
Inventory (anchors, no pain = 0 and pain as bad is it could be = 10.
Note that the high anchor was slightly unintentionally altered from
that of the Brief Pain Inventory).
Medical records provided SCD genotype; lifetime complications
(acute chest syndrome and avascular necrosis of bone); and
baseline hemoglobin count (Hb) from the most recent hematology
visit (up to 1 year prior to testing). Genotype was unknown in one
participant in the COT group owing to unclear notations in the
medical record without available confirmatory testing. Baseline Hb
was determined by recording the most recent four non-crisis Hb
values within the past year, discarding the highest and lowest, and
averaging the middle two observations. For participants whose Hb
data were not available using these methods (n=10), baseline Hb
was determined by extending the time period to include a time
when the patient was more active in clinic when there were more
data available (up to 3 years). For the remainder (n=4), a smaller
number of observations were used provided they were not widely
divergent and clearly not during crisis. This left two participants
with missing baseline Hb data, one in each group.

 Participants on COT were defined as those who were prescribed
long-acting, daily opioids for chronic pain, which was obtained
from chart review and clinic prescription databases. Opioids in-
cluded sustained-release morphine preparations (50%); sustained-
release oxycodone preparations (23%); methadone (17%); and
transdermal fentanyl (10%). Prescribed doses were obtained by
multiplying tablet strength by number of dispensed tablets and
divided by the prescription interval, except for transdermal
fentanyl, for which the total daily fentanyl dose was calculated
by the patch strength. Each opioid dose was then converted to oral
morphine equivalents using standard conversion tables. Duration
of COT was not assessed, partly because of inadequate information
regarding inception (such as patients whose COT was started at
other institutions) and finding that in some cases, participants may
have been using as-needed medication around the clock prior to
inception. There was no systematic assessment for multiple
prescribers; however, patients in the Sickle Cell Center for Adults
sign opioid treatment contracts that prohibit multiple prescribers
and are regularly assessed using the Maryland Prescription Drug
Monitoring Program for receiving prescriptions from multiple
providers. If this behavior is discovered, typically patients are
required to produce evidence that the other prescribing relation-
ships are terminated, or no longer receive opioids from the Sickle
Cell Center for Adults.
Depressive symptoms were quantified using the 20-item version
of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Items are
rated on 5-point scales from 0 (rarely or less than one day) to 4
(most of the time, 5–7 days) and the summary score indicates
greater depressive symptom severity.55,56
The Current Opioid Misuse Measure was used to evaluate the
existence of aberrant opioid use. It is a widely used, 17-item
questionnaire, with high internal reliability, specifically designed with
pain patients in mind that includes items assessing risk, emergent
healthcare utilization, and mood disturbance.57–59 A summary score
is created and a clinical cut off score of Z9 identifies individuals for
whom opioid medications may be problematic. Because the authors
did not want to confound risk with mood and healthcare utilization, a
Current Opioid Misuse Measure risk behavior subset score was
calculated (Items 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, and 16).
A broad battery of QST measures were collected on the
participants. These included heat and pressure pain thresholds as
well as heat pain tolerance. Temporal summation, a measure of CS,
was measured for heat and mechanical (punctate) stimuli. Heat pain
stimuli for thermal temporal summation were tailored based on the
previously measured heat pain threshold. Hot water immersion was
used to measure conditioned pain modulation and hot water
tolerance. Aftersensations were measured by obtaining pain rating
15 seconds following the final pulse in each thermal temporal
summation series and 30 seconds and 1 minute following comple-
tion of the final hot water immersion. QST variables were Z-scored
to combine measures with different scales into comparable indices,
with heat pain threshold and tolerance, pressure pain threshold,
water temperature, and conditioned pain modulation reversed to
make their directionality consistent (i.e., higher scores correspond
to enhanced sensitivity). A QST index was created by averaging
Z-scores for heat pain threshold and tolerance, pressure pain
thresholds, conditioned pain modulation, hand withdrawal time
and intensity, and water temperature. A CS index was created by
averaging Z-scores for thermal and mechanical temporal summa-
tion, and after sensations to temporal summation and hot water.60–62
A pain rating was obtained 15 seconds following the final pulse
in each thermal temporal summation series and 30 seconds and 1
minute following completion of the final hot water immersion.
Daily electronic diaries recorded whether the participant was in
crisis and least, worst, and average pain severity rated on a 0–100
scale. Functional measures were also queried using the same 0–100
scale, including pain-related interference, physical activity, and
fatigue for non-crisis and crisis days. Healthcare utilization
questions were also included, specifically whether a call to their
provider or medical visit occurred, pain relief from their medi-
cations, and satisfaction with medications all on non-crisis and
crisis days. Mean scores were calculated for each measure by
participant, separately for crisis and non-crisis days. Diary data
were included for participants who had Z25% of days with
measures involved in the study recorded; there was no prompting
for data entry (n=77, COT; n=25, non-COT, p=52; median
completion ratio for evening diaries, 78.2%). Measures were
recorded in the morning and evening, with the measures of
interest for this study (e.g., pain, fatigue) being recorded in evening
diaries addressing the prior 12 hours. Clinical pain during the
diary follow-up period was summarized by averaging the reported
lowest, highest, and average daily pain ratings across both crisis
and non-crisis days, then computing the mean of all three ratings,
thus producing a single index of non-crisis clinical pain summar-
ized over time. All three ratings were included to account for
variability in pain during a day. For all pain-related analyses, the
unit of analysis was the individual participant.
Data Analysis
Participants on COT were compared with non-COT participants
on demographics, clinical measures, QST findings, and diary
measures in bivariate analyses using ANOVA or chi-square tests
as appropriate. Depressive symptoms were included as a covariate
in multivariable regression models to test whether COT predicted
measures of pain, function, and healthcare utilization. A Spearman
rank-order (nonparametric) correlation coefficient was calculated
to examine the relationship between non-crisis clinical pain and
opioid dose in patients on COT, as well as the relationship between
pain and CS. The potential moderating effect of CS on the
relationship between COT and non-crisis clinical pain was tested
using Hayes’s PROCESS macro.63 This macro uses an ordinary
least squares or logistic regression–based path analytic framework
to analyze models. Model 1, testing simple moderation, was used
in the current analyses, which included depression as a covariate.
Additionally, a cluster analysis used pain, pain-related interfer-
ence, and healthcare use to classify each SCD patient based on the
pattern of diary reports. A K-means cluster analysis was performed
using the variables identified (pain, pain-related interference, and
healthcare use) from the daily diaries. This split participants into
two groups based on responses to these items. This was conducted
to examine and confirm the greater symptom burden of the COT
group, as the authors hypothesized that a larger percentage of
patients from the COT group would fall into the more severe
cluster. All analyses were performed in SPSS, version 23. Analyses
used all complete observations available for each analysis. In the
COT group, data from two participants were missing for the CS
index, and one from the non-CS QST index. One participant did
none of the QST measures, another was missing all temporal
summation and hot water measures.

 Results
Patients taking COT did not differ on age or sex
(Table 1). Interestingly, none of the included disease
severity measures (more severe genotype, acute chest
syndrome, avascular necrosis of bone, or baseline Hb)
were associated with greater baseline pain (all p-values
Z0.19), although the COT group did report greater
baseline pain severity (3.6 vs 1.3, po0.001), as well as
ratings of depressive symptoms and, not surprisingly,
risk for medication misuse.
Participants on COT had greater scores on the CS index,
which were also observed in the multivariate analysis
controlling for depressive symptoms, but no group differ-
ences were observed on the QST index (Table 2). In
bivariate analyses of the daily diary records, participants
on COT reported greater average daily pain on both crisis
and non-crisis days. Though participants on COT were no
more likely to report at least one crisis during the diary
period (12.5% vs 13.0%, p40.05), they spent a greater
proportion of their time in crisis and reported greater
average pain during crisis (Table 2). Group differences in
pain severity were most striking on non-crisis days (34.5 vs
10.3, po0.001) and all of these group differences remained
in the analyses controlling for depressive symptoms.

the
relationship between clinical
pain and chronic opioid use,

on
COT
were
correlated
with non-crisis clinical pain,
indicating
a
marginally
significant opioid dose–pain
relationship (r¼0.41, p¼0.051,
Figure 1). Visual inspection of
scatterplots of CS versus non-
crisis pain suggested a differ-
ential
relationship
between
those on COT and not. Further
analysis revealed that CS was
only correlated with non-crisis
clinical pain in patients not
taking COT (r¼0.44, p¼0.002
vs r ¼ �0.05, p40.05), which
was evaluated further in the
moderation analysis.
Participants
on
COT
reported higher pain-related
interference
and
greater
fatigue on non-crisis days as
compared with participants
not on COT; this relationship
remained
significant
when
depressive symptoms were included in the multivariable
models (Table 2). A similar pattern emerged for function
on crisis days during the diary recording period, such
that participants on COT reported greater pain-related
interference and fatigue on crisis days compared with
participants not taking COT. However, neither of these
effects remained significant once baseline depressive
symptoms were entered into the model. The effect of
COT was not observed on reports of physical activity on
either non-crisis or crisis days.
Participants on COT reported making more calls to
providers, experiencing greater pain relief from medi-
cations, and greater satisfaction with their pain medi-
cation on non-crisis days as compared with participants
not using COT (Table 2). These effects of COT remained
significant when depressive symptoms were controlled in
the multivariable models. The pattern on crisis days was
slightly different, such that calls to providers and medical
visits were higher in the COT group, even when
depressive symptoms were controlled in the multivari-
able models. On crisis days, no differences were observed
between groups on pain relief or satisfaction.
Greater CS was significantly associated with greater
non-crisis clinical pain (β¼16.2, p¼0.0006). Being on

 COT (dichotomous group variable) was significantly
associated with non-crisis clinical pain as well (β¼19.5,
po0.0001). A significant interaction emerged between CS
and COT (β¼�18.2, p¼0.006), despite controlling for the
effects of depression on non-crisis clinical pain (β¼0.4,
p¼0.005). This interaction is represented graphically in
Figure 2, which depicts the simple slope of COT for low
(�1 SD) and high (þ1 SD) CS. Simple slopes were tested
across the two COT groups and only the slope for non-
COT users revealed a significant association between
CS and non-crisis clinical pain (β¼16.2, p¼0.0006 vs
β¼�2.0, p¼0.7). The authors probed the interaction
with the Johnson–Neyman technique64 to determine
the regions of significance of the conditional effect.
This depicts the range of values within the moderator
where the interaction is significant. Figure 3 plots the
conditional effect of COT on non-crisis clinical pain
across values of CS. The region of significance lies
where the CI does not include 0. Thus, COT is
associated with non-crisis clinical pain when CS is
o0.55. Those with CS scores o0.55 accounted for
83.1% (n¼64) of the entire sample, 90.4% in the non-
COT group and 68% in the COT group (p¼0.02).
Two clusters (using the aforementioned K-means
cluster analysis) were formed based on pain (41.9 vs
7.4); pain-related interference (32.8 vs 3.6); and health-
care use (0.01 vs 0.03), classifying participants on diary
reports. Three times as many participants in the COT
group were included in the greater symptom burden
cluster (n¼18 vs n¼6).

 Discussion
These findings indicate that those on COT report an
overall greater symptom burden. Specifically, they expe-
rience greater clinical pain (both crisis and non-crisis),
higher CS, more crises, poorer functional outcomes, and
higher healthcare utilization than those not on COT,
independent of any depressive symptom effects. Surpris-
ingly, however, disease severity measures do not differ
between those not and those on COT. The relationship
between CS and pain severity is complex and differs
depending on COT status. The moderation analysis
reveals that in participants not on COT, greater CS is
associated with greater non-crisis clinical pain; however,
in participants on COT, no relationship is observed
between CS and non-crisis clinical pain.
Opioids are a mainstay for patients with SCD, and
clinical use of COT for chronic non-cancer pain has
expanded rapidly, perhaps beyond the evidence support-
ing its widespread use.65 These findings suggest a harsher
disease course, which may be the very reason these
patients were originally prescribed COT. Although the
authors are unable to glean whether any improvement in
these variables has been witnessed since initiating COT
from the study data, it does not appear that they have
received substantial benefit from COT.
An ongoing difficulty with respect to COT and CS is
that opioids have both anti- and pro-nociceptive
effects.66–70 Though short-term studies have generally
documented improvements in pain severity with opioid
therapy, longer-term studies and clinical experience with
refractory chronic pain suggest that opioids can have
harmful effects and certain patients may have reduced
pain off of COT.28,40,42 Thus, although using opioids may
produce reductions in pain in the short term, longer-
term sensitizing effects may increase pain severity overall.
If the clinical response to worsened pain is to increase
opioid dosing, a vicious cycle may develop. Further
complicating the clinical picture, opioid reduction itself
is difficult, unpleasant, and likely to result in a hyper-
algesic state due to opioid withdrawal effects.71,72
In this study, the positive relationship between CS and
clinical pain, particularly non-crisis pain, among patients
not on COT was expected. CS is associated with the
development and maintenance of chronic pain and with
chronic pain severity.60,73 Measures of CS have been
found to be elevated in animal studies of SCD, and in
humans, and likely represent a fundamental mechanism
of the pain experience of SCD as in other chronic pain
conditions.16,22,25 Although COT was associated with
increased pain and CS overall, the moderation analysis
highlights that patients on COT showed no relationship
between CS and non-crisis clinical pain. The mechanisms
underlying this puzzling lack of an association are unclear.
The findings suggest that level of CS does not matter for
those on COT—their pain is high regardless of CS.
However, for the group not on COT, those with low
CS report substantially lower levels of non-crisis clinical
pain. One possible explanation for this finding is that

Note: The region of significance lies where the CI does not include 0.
Thus, COT is associated with clinical pain when CS is less than 0.55.
COT, chronic opioid therapy; CS, central sensitization.

 COT reduces clinical pain irrespective of the underlying
level of central sensitization—a therapeutic effect. A second
hypothesis is that COT increases CS in a qualitative (i.e.,
dose-independent) manner. However, these two hypoth-
eses are not mutually exclusive—it is entirely consistent
with prior findings that opioids can produce both anti- and
pro-nociceptive effects, and the overall clinical situation
may be a balance between these competitive actions.
It is reassuring, however, that COT was not associated
with a potentiated effect of CS on non-crisis clinical pain,
which would have suggested a potentiation effect, possibly
due to the compounding cycle mentioned previously. It also
suggests that any opioid-induced increase in CS may
represent a qualitative or “threshold” relationship rather
than a dose-dependent one, whereas anti-nociceptive effects
appear to be related to the potency of opioid agonism and
to dose,74 although there is some evidence that neuropathic
pain mechanisms are relatively refractory to opioids.75
These data may be built upon in the future and could have
implications for prescription of COT. For example, those
already high in CS may not benefit as much from COT.
One exciting potential future direction may be tempering
COT dosing in those high in CS and examining whether a
corresponding reduction is observed in clinical pain.
A principal strength of the study was the use of
standardized measures of CS and other QST indices, as
well as a highly detailed daily diary and information
regarding participants’ clinical characteristics. The prin-
cipal limitations of the study are lack of randomization to
COT category and no knowledge of pain-related variables
prior to initiating COT, which limits the capacity to infer
the direction of causation of the findings. Included in this
uncertainty is topography and duration of COT therapy,
as participants undoubtedly varied in prior opioid expo-
sure and duration of therapy. This could only be
addressed either in a randomized trial for COT in SCD
chronic pain or in an opioid cessation study. In addition,
there was a reduced sample size for the QST analyses,
owing to failure to complete certain pain tests among
some participants in the COT group, which resulted in a
loss of power for some analyses. Overall, this study
highlights the potential drawbacks of COT and suggests
that measurement of CS and other disease- and pain-
related factors could be used in clinical decision making.
These data also suggest that further assessment of COT in
pain-related outcomes for SCD patients is warranted.
