SUMMARY
In obesity, macrophages and other immune cells accumulate in insulin target tissues, promoting a 
chronic inflammatory state and insulin resistance. Galectin-3 (Gal3), a lectin mainly secreted by 
macrophages, is elevated in both obese subjects and mice. Administration of Gal3 to mice causes 
insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, whereas inhibition of Gal3, through either genetic or 
pharmacologic loss of function, improved insulin sensitivity in obese mice. In vitro treatment with 
Gal3 directly enhanced macrophage chemotaxis, reduced insulin stimulated glucose uptake in 
myocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes and impaired insulin-mediated suppression of glucose output in 
primary mouse hepatocytes. Importantly, we found that Gal3 can bind directly to the insulin 
receptor (IR) and inhibit downstream IR signaling. These observations elucidate a novel role for 
Gal3 in hepatocytes, adipocytes and myocyte insulin resistance, suggesting that Gal3 can link

 inflammation to decreased insulin sensitivity. Inhibition of Gal3 could be a new approach to treat 
insulin resistance.
INTRODUCTION
Obesity-associated insulin resistance is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and plays a 
central role in metabolic syndrome (Haffner and Taegtmeyer, 2003; Olefsky and Glass, 
2010; Reaven, 2005). Many studies have shown that in obesity, there is an increased 
accumulation of macrophages in adipose tissue (Weisberg et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2003), liver 
(Lanthier et al., 2009), and muscle (Pillon et al., 2013), especially pro-inflammatory M-1 
like Cd11c+ macrophages which account for the majority of this increase (Lackey and 
Olefsky, 2016; Li et al., 2010). Our previous studies clearly show that in vivo deletion of 
Cd11c+ cells improved obesity-induced insulin resistance, indicating that the chronic tissue 
inflammatory state plays a key causal role in obesity-induced insulin resistance (Patsouris et 
al., 2008).
Chronic tissue inflammation leads to increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such 
as TNFα and IL1β, which impair insulin signaling and induce insulin resistance 
(Hotamisligil et al., 1996; Jager et al., 2007). However, therapeutic efforts focusing on 
inhibition of TNFα or IL1β to ameliorate inflammation-induced insulin resistance have had 
limited success in clinical studies (Donath et al., 2013; Larsen et al., 2007; Stanley et al., 
2011). Thus, we hypothesize that there are other secreted factors which play a role in 
inflammation-induced decreased insulin sensitivity. Galectin-3 (also known as Mac-2), a 30-
kDa lectin, contains a carbohydrate-recognition binding domain that binds to β-galactoside 
(Barondes et al., 1994a; Yang et al., 2008), and is localized in the nucleus, cytoplasm and 
extracellular membrane. Galectin-3 (Gal3) plays an important disease-exacerbating role in 
autoimmune/inflammatory and malignant diseases (Gao et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Liu and 
Rabinovich, 2010). Our previous reports found that after switching obese mice from a high 
fat diet (HFD) to normal chow (NC), adipose tissue Cd11c+ macrophages express much 
lower levels of Gal3 compared to HFD fed mice. At the same time, there was amelioration 
of inflammation and insulin resistance in these diet-switched mice, despite retaining the 
same number of adipose tissue Cd11c+ macrophages (Li et al., 2010). Therefore, we 
hypothesize that Gal3 can promote insulin resistance, providing a link between inflammation 
and decreased insulin sensitivity.
Here, we report that Gal3 KO mice were protected from inflammation and insulin resistance, 
and a selective small molecule Gal3 inhibitor reduces insulin resistance. Moreover, we found 
that in vivo Gal3 administration causes glucose intolerance and insulin resistance whereas in 
vitro treatment can directly induce decreased insulin sensitivity in myocytes, hepatocytes, 
and adipocytes. Together these findings suggest that hematopoietic cell-derived Gal3 might 
be a valuable drug target for the treatment of insulin resistance.

 RESULTS
Metabolic Studies in WT, Gal3 −/− and Gal3 +/− Mice
In obesity, proinflammatory macrophages accumulate in adipose tissue, liver and muscle, 
promoting a chronic inflammatory state, which contributes to insulin resistance. Since Gal3 
is an abundant macrophage secretory factor (Liu et al., 1995; Sato and Hughes, 1994), we 
assessed glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in chow and HFD-fed WT, Gal3 +/− 
(Gal3 HET), and Gal3 −/− (Gal3 KO) mice. Body weight and oral glucose tolerance tests 
(OGTTs) were comparable between the WT and Gal3 KO mice on chow diet (Figures S1A 
& B). Upon HFD feeding, WT and Gal3 KO mice gained the same amount of weight 
(Figure 1A); however, the Gal3 KO mice were much more glucose tolerant with lower blood 
insulin levels compared with WT mice (Figures 1B & C). The glucose-lowering effect of 
injected insulin was also greater in KO mice (Figure 1D), indicating improved systemic 
insulin sensitivity as a result of the Gal3 deletion. To measure tissue-specific insulin 
sensitivity hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp studies were performed. As shown in 
Figures 1E-I, the amount of exogenous glucose required to maintain euglycemia (glucose 
infusion rate, GIR) and the glucose disposal rate (GDR) was substantially higher in the HFD 
Gal3 KO compared to HFD WT mice (Figures 1E & F). The insulin stimulated glucose 
disposal rate (IS-GDR), which primarily reflects skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, and the 
ability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production (HGP), which reflects hepatic 
insulin sensitivity, was also improved in the Gal3 KO mice (Figures 1G-I). Thus, Gal3 
deletion led to greater in vivo insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver.
Since endogenous Gal3 circulates at relatively high levels in normal mice and humans, we 
asked whether heterozygous depletion of Gal3 would improve insulin resistance. To test this 
idea, HFD Gal3+/− (Gal3 HET) mice were studied. As expected, circulating Gal3 levels are 
50% lower compared to HFD WT mice (Figure 1J), with values down to the normal 
concentrations seen in lean, chow-fed mice (Figure 2A). Consistent with the results in the 
Gal3 KO mice, Gal3 het mice gained the same amount of weight as WT on HFD (Figure 
1K), but were insulin sensitive and glucose tolerant with lower blood insulin levels (Figures 
1L-N). This indicates that ~50% deletion of Gal3 is adequate to induce a robust 
improvement in glucose tolerance and systemic insulin sensitivity. We also assessed tissue 
insulin signaling in these mice and, as seen in Figure S1C-E, we observed an increase in 
insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in adipose tissue, liver, and muscle in the Gal3 
HETs compared to WT.
We found that as chow-fed mice age, blood levels of Gal3 increase (Figure S1F). 
Interestingly, in these older chow-fed mice, Gal3 KO led to an improvement in glucose 
tolerance and insulin sensitivity (Figures S1G-I), unlike the results in young insulin sensitive 
mice (Figure S1B), but similar to the results in the HFD mice (Figures 1 B and D). In 
general, the degree of improvement was quite robust (40-50%) and was similar in magnitude 
across the HFD Gal3 KOs, HFD Gal3 HETs, and older Gal3 KO mice.
Interestingly, whereas HFD-induced obesity can lead to hepatosteatosis (Birkenfeld and 
Shulman, 2013; Samuel et al., 2004), we found that deletion of Gal3 did not alter the hepatic 
lipid profile in HFD mice (Figures S2A-G).

 Circulating Levels of Gal3 are Higher in Obese Mice and Humans
Since obesity is associated with macrophage accumulation in metabolic tissues and 
macrophages produce and secrete Gal3 (Liu et al., 1995; Sato and Hughes, 1994), it seemed 
probable that blood Gal3 levels are elevated in obesity. To test this hypothesis, we measured 
circulating Gal3 by ELISA and found that Gal3 levels were nearly three times as high in 
HFD mice compared to lean age-matched chow-fed mice (Figure 2A). In vivo 
administration of clodronate to mice is an established method to deplete macrophages, and 
previous studies have shown that clodronate treatment leads to a marked decreased in 
systemic inflammation along with an increase in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity 
(Feng et al., 2011; Li et al., 2015). Interestingly, in clodronate-treated mice there was a 
marked decrease in circulating Gal3 levels, reducing these values from the elevated 
concentrations seen in HFD mice down to the normal levels seen in chow-fed mice (Figure 
2B). These results suggest that macrophages may account for the majority of the increase in 
Gal3 levels seen in obesity.
With respect to human studies, obese subjects display significantly higher Gal3 levels than 
lean subjects (Figure 2C). Furthermore, Gal3 levels are positively correlated to both BMI 
and HOMA-IR (an index of insulin resistance, Figures 2D & E), suggestive for a role in 
insulin resistance in man.
Gal3 and Macrophage Migration
It has been reported that Gal3 produces chemotactic effects on immune cells (Sano et al., 
2000), and consistent with this, we found that Gal3 stimulated in vitro chemotaxis of mouse 
intraperitoneal macrophages (IP–Macs) in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2F). MCP-1 
(100 ng/ml)-containing media can also induce migration of WT IP-Macs (Figure S3A). 
Interestingly, loss of Gal3 does not significantly alter the ability of MCP1 to induce 
chemotaxis (Figure S3A). With respect to another macrophage function, in vitro 
phagocytosis was reduced in the Gal3 HET macrophages and further reduced in the Gal3 
KO cells (Figure S3B).
To determine if these in vitro chemotaxis results translated to the in vivo situation, we 
directly measured macrophage migration into adipose tissue using an in vivo macrophage 
tracking technique. With this approach, circulating monocytes were obtained from WT 
donor mice and labeled with fluorescent PKH26 dye ex vivo. The labeled monocytes were 
then injected into recipient HFD-fed WT or Gal3 KO mice. We found a substantially lower 
number of labeled macrophages in adipose tissue and liver in Gal3 KO mice (Figure 2G). 
We also conducted FACS analysis of epididymal adipose tissue (Epi-WAT) stromal vascular 
cells (SVCs) prepared from HFD WT and Gal3 KO mice. The results showed a lower total 
number of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) as well as ~70% fewer proinflammatory 
CD11c-positive macrophages in Gal3 KO Epi-WAT (Figures 2H-I & Figure S4). This 
indicates a reduced inflammatory state, and fully consistent with this idea, we found 
decreased expression of a variety of proinflammatory genes in adipose tissue from Gal3 KOs 
compared to WT (Figure 2J & Table S1).

 Gal3 Directly Induces Cellular Insulin Resistance
Given that circulating Gal3 levels are elevated in obesity (Figure 2A), we asked whether 
Gal3 could directly act on insulin target tissues in an endocrine manner to impair insulin 
signaling. To assess this, we studied the effects of Gal3 treatment on L6 myocytes, 3T3-L1 
adipocytes, and primary hepatocytes. Gal3 treatment inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose 
transport in a dose-responsive manner in L6 myocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figures 3A 
& B). The same effect was observed after longer (48 hours) Gal3 treatment (Figure S5A). To 
indicate the relevancy of these findings to human biology, we conducted in vitro Gal3 
treatment studies in human inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived skeletal muscle 
cells. Insulin induced a ~2-fold increase in glucose transport in iPSC-derived myocytes, and 
this effect was blocked by Gal3 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S5B). In WT primary 
hepatocytes, glucagon stimulates hepatic glucose output (HGO) and this increase was 
completely inhibited by insulin (Figure 3C). Gal3 alone also stimulated HGO and, as 
expected, this effect was not inhibited by insulin (Figure 3C 3rd set of bars). Combination 
treatment with Gal3 and glucagon had the same stimulatory effect on HGO as glucagon 
alone, and importantly, Gal3 blocked the effect of insulin to inhibit glucagon-stimulated 
HGO (Figure 3C, 4th the set of bars). Taken together, these results indicate that Gal3 can 
directly induce cellular insulin resistance in the 3 major insulin target tissues.
Gal3 can interact with glycosylated proteins through its C-terminal domain, termed the 
carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), whereas full length Gal3 forms oligomers through 
the N-terminal domain (Figure S5C) (Ahmad et al., 2004; Barondes et al., 1994b). To 
determine if the CRD-Gal3 has the same effect as full length Gal3, L6 myocytes were 
treated with CRD-Gal3, followed by measurement of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. As 
shown in Figure 3D, the CRD-Gal3 inhibits glucose uptake similar to full length Gal3.
To determine if these in vitro results translated to the in vivo situation, we directly injected 
lean insulin-sensitive chow-fed mice with recombinant Gal3. In these studies, we injected a 
dose of Gal3 (0.2 mg/kg) designed to raise the circulating levels from the normal values 
observed in lean chow mice up to the elevated values seen in HFD WT mice as shown in 
Figure 3E. Consistent with the in vitro data, GTTs performed 1 hour after injection showed 
that these mice became glucose intolerant, with a 45% reduction in AUC (area under the 
curve, Figured 3F). In addition, these treated mice exhibit hyperinsulinemia (Figure 3G) and 
a marked decrease in insulin sensitivity as shown by a 55% increase in AUC during ITTs 
(Figure 3H). We also overexpressed Gal3 in chow fed mice by IV administration of an 
adenovirus encoding the Gal3 gene (Ad-Gal3). Ad-Gal3 leads to increased Gal3 levels, 
producing glucose intolerance (60% increase in AUC, Figure 3I), insulin intolerance (62% 
increase in AUC, Figure 3J) and hyperinsulinemia (Figure 3K), showing that Gal3 can 
directly induce insulin resistance in vivo. It is important to note that LPS could not be 
detected in our recombinant Gal3 preparations (Figure S5D). Despite this, we took the extra 
step of detoxifying the Gal3 (Figure S5D) and, as expected, LPS was not detected in this 
material compared to the Gal3 preparation which had been spiked with LPS at a 
concentration of 0.5 pg/ml.
Given that IP-MACs and other monocytes or macrophages can secrete Gal3 (Figures S5E & 
F) and that Gal3 inhibited insulin action, it seems possible that macrophages can directly

 affect insulin action through Gal3. To access this, we isolated conditioned medium (CM) 
either from WT or KO IP-MACs, followed by glucose uptake assays in L6 myocytes. As 
shown in Figure 3L, CM from WT IP-MACs significantly blocked insulin-stimulated 
glucose uptake compared to control medium. Importantly, the CM from KO IP-MACs had 
no effect to inhibit insulin action in L6 myocytes.
Mechanisms of Gal3-induced Cellular Insulin Resistance
Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), stimulating IR tyrosine auto phosphorylation and 
kinase activity, leading to phosphorylation and recruitment of substrate adaptors such as 
insulin receptor substrate (IRS1). IRS1 then stimulates P13 kinase and PDK1 which signal 
downstream to AKT and glucose transport. We used L6 myocytes and 3T3-L1 cells to assess 
the effects of Gal3 on these events. As seen in Figures 4A and B, Gal3 treatment inhibits 
insulin-stimulated IR tyrosine phosphorylation in both cell types. There was a corresponding 
decrease in IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation, as measured both by ELISA assay and western 
blotting in L6 myocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figures 4C-F). Consistent with these 
results, Gal3 treatment inhibited the effects of insulin to stimulate PDK1 (Figure 4G and 
Figure S6A) and AKT (Figure 4H and Figure S6B) phosphorylation in a dose-responsive 
manner in both cell types. In myocytes and adipocytes, insulin stimulation leads to GLUT4 
translocation with subsequent increased glucose uptake. GLUT4 translocation was measured 
using the plasma membrane sheet assay (Figure 4I), and by immunofluorescence detection 
of GLUT4 recruitment to the cell surface using the GLUT4 ring assay (Figure 4J), as 
previously described (Imamura et al., 1999; Vollenweider et al., 1997). Both of these 
measurements show that Gal3 treatment reduces insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in 
3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figures 4I & J). In aggregate, these data indicate that Gal3 impairs all 
the major steps in the insulin signaling pathway.
Most likely this is due to a direct inhibitory effect of Gal3 on the IR. Consistent with this, 
Figure 5 shows that when L6 cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes are treated with Gal3, IR/Gal3 
complexes can be co-precipitated from these cells. To evaluate Gal3 binding to the IR and IR 
phosphorylation, L6 myocytes were treated with biotinylated Gal3 (Bio-Gal3). As seen in 
Figure 5A, Bio-Gal3/IR complexes can be co-precipitated from these cells. In contrast, 
Gal3/IRS1 co-immunoprecipitated complexes were not detected (Figure 5A). Interestingly, 
the amount of IR co-precipitated with Gal3 was increased in the presence of insulin, 
suggesting that the binding of insulin to its receptor renders the IR/Gal3 interaction more 
efficient (Figure 5A). Furthermore, when similar experiments were performed at 16°C (to 
limit any IR internalization), the same results were seen with respect to Gal3/IR binding 
(Figure 5B). In the reverse experiment in which Bio-Gal3 was captured followed by 
immunoblotting of IR, comparable Gal3/IR binding was also detected (Figure 5C). In 
control studies, we also show that, Bio-Gal3 can impair insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 
L6 cells (Figure 5D), similar to WT Gal3. To evaluate whether Gal3 treatment affects 
binding of insulin to its receptor, we performed insulin binding assays in both 3T3-L1 
adipocytes and primary hepatocytes. As seen in Figures 5E & F, Gal3 treatment did not 
affect insulin binding, suggesting that Gal3 interacts with the insulin receptor at a different 
site than insulin.

 Studies in Chimeric Gal3−/− Mice
Since Gal3 is secreted by macrophages in vitro (Liu et al., 1995; Sato and Hughes, 1994), 
we determined the contribution of immune cells to the circulating Gal3 pool by performing 
bone marrow transplantation (BMT) experiments. With this adoptive transfer approach, we 
generated chimeric mice in which WT mice received bone marrow from either WT mice 
(BMT Gal3) or Gal3 KO mice (BMT Gal3 KO). As shown in Figure 6A, blood Gal3 levels 
were decreased by ~90% in BMT Gal3 KO mice, indicating that most of the circulating 
Gal3 is derived from immune cells. The BMT Gal3 and BMT Gal3 KO mice gained the 
same about of weight on HFD (Figure 6B). However, the BMT Gal3 KO mice were more 
glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive with lower insulin levels compared to BMT Gal3 mice 
(Figures 6C-E). Moreover, hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp studies showed 
higher GIR, IS-GDR, lower HGP after insulin infusion, and elevated HGP suppression 
(Figures 6F-I) in BMT Gal3 KO versus BMT Gal3 animals. Taken together, these results 
indicate that immune cells are the major contributor to systemic Gal3 concentrations in mice 
and that circulating Gal3 induces systemic insulin resistance.
Gal3 Inhibition Improves Insulin Sensitivity
The above studies clearly show that Gal3 can directly induce cellular insulin resistance in 
vitro and systemic in vivo insulin resistance and that genetic Gal3 loss of function improves 
insulin sensitivity. To further define the role of Gal3 and assess its potential translational 
implications, we turned to a pharmacologic loss of function approach. Thus, we treated L6 
myocytes with the Gal3 inhibitor compound 47 (Cpd47) (Salameh et al., 2010) and found 
that it blocked the inhibitory effect of both full length Gal3 and the CRD-Gal3 on insulin-
stimulated glucose transport (Figures 7A & B). The Gal3 inhibitor also blocked the effect of 
Gal3 to inhibit the repressive effects of insulin on HGO in primary hepatocytes (Figures 7C 
& D). To extend these observations to the in vivo situation, obese HFD mice were treated 
with a single dose (50 mg/kg) of Cpd47 and OGTTs were performed 1 hour later. As Figure 
7E shows, the Gal3 inhibitor improved glucose tolerance in these mice. To evaluate the 
effects of this inhibitor in the more chronic setting and at lower doses, we administered 
Cpd47 to HFD mice via an osmotic minipump at a dose of 6.4 mg/kg per day for two weeks. 
In agreement with the acute treatment data, chronic treatment also improved glucose 
tolerance in HFD/obese mice (Figure 7F).
DISCUSSION
Here we show that circulating Gal3 levels are elevated in obese mice and humans and that 
Gal3 is a macrophage-derived factor that can cause in vivo systemic insulin resistance both 
acutely and chronically. In addition, Gal3 treatment in vitro causes decreased insulin action 
in adipocytes, muscle cells and hepatocytes by inhibiting insulin receptor activity, leading to 
decreased downstream signaling to the insulin action cascade. Gal3 also promotes adipose 
tissue inflammation by inducing macrophage chemotaxis and the accumulation of 
proinflammatory ATMs in obesity. Thus, these studies show that bone marrow-derived cells, 
such as macrophages, can secrete Gal3, which enters the circulation and can cause cellular 
and systemic insulin resistance. In this way, Gal3 is identified as an etiologic factor which 
contributes to obesity-induced insulin resistance and chronic tissue inflammation.

 A major piece of evidence for this new role of Gal3 in insulin resistance comes from our KO 
mouse studies. Here we find that deletion of Gal3 leads to improved glucose tolerance with 
enhanced in vivo insulin sensitivity (Figures 1B-D) in HFD Gal3 KO mice. Using 
hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies, this increased insulin sensitivity is expressed in 
both muscle and liver (Figures 1E-I). This insulin sensitive phenotype was not limited to 
homozygous KOs, since heterozygous Gal3 deletion, which reduces Gal3 levels in Gal3 
HETs down to values observed in lean mice, also causes greater glucose tolerance and 
insulin sensitivity (Figures 1L-N), indicating that a full reduction in circulating Gal3 levels 
is not necessary to observe this phenotype. Interestingly, the insulin sensitization induced by 
Gal3 deficiency is not restricted to the context of obesity and HFD, since older chow-fed 
mice with higher blood Gal3 levels also display improved glucose tolerance upon Gal3 KO 
(Figures S1H & I).
Deletion of Gal3 from the bone marrow compartment by transplanting Gal3 KO bone 
marrow into irradiated WT mice also produced a state of improved insulin sensitivity and 
glucose tolerance (Figures 6C-I). Importantly, these studies demonstrated a >90% reduction 
in circulating Gal3 levels in BMT Gal3 KO mice (Figure 6A), indicating that BM-derived 
cells are the dominant source of this circulating factor. As reported previously, Gal3 is 
poorly expressed in mouse lymphocytes and neutrophils (Joo et al., 2001; Sato et al., 2002) 
and this strengthens our conclusion that macrophages are a major source of the secreted 
circulating Gal3. Consistent with this, ATM Gal3 content increases on HFD and decreases 
on chow diet, parallel to the changes in blood Gal3 levels. With respect to the source of 
circulating Gal3, when we administered clodronate to WT HFD mice, we were able to 
achieve ~80% depletion of ATMs and this corresponded to a decrease in circulating Gal3 
levels from the elevated concentration seen in HFD mice down to the normal concentrations 
seen in lean mice (Figure S3A). This suggests that a sizable component of the obesity-
induced elevation of circulating Gal3 can be derived from clodronate-sensitive macrophages.
In addition to deletion of Gal3, we carried out Gal3 treatment studies. These experiments 
were conducted either by injecting exogenous Gal3 into WT animals, or by using an adeno-
Gal3 to generate Gal3 transgenic mice. Both methods of Gal3 administration led to glucose 
intolerance and insulin resistance (Figures 3F-K), fully consistent with the phenotype 
observed with Gal3 deletion (Figure 1). In our Gal3 treatment studies, we used a dose of 
Gal3 designed to raise the circulating values from the normal concentration seen in lean 
chow fed mice to the elevated levels observed in obese HFD mice (Figure 3E). Elevating the 
Gal3 levels to the pathophysiologic obese concentrations in these lean mice led to a marked 
deterioration of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (Figures 3F-H). Lastly, we 
supplemented our KO studies by conducting pharmacologic loss of function experiments 
with a Gal3 inhibitor. Treatment of obese animals with this inhibitor, either acutely or 
chronically, led to improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitization (Figures 7E & F), 
consistent with the results in the Gal3 KO mice. The Gal3 inhibitor also reversed the effects 
of Gal3 to cause cellular insulin resistance in vitro (Figures 7A-D).
The concomitant improvement in insulin sensitivity and inflammatory status in the Gal3 KO 
and Gal3 inhibitor treated mice fits quite well with the known interaction between obesity-
induced chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. In the current case, our data show that

 Gal3 can directly cause decreased insulin sensitivity in the three major insulin target tissues, 
adipocytes, muscle and liver. As such, these findings amplify the underlying mechanisms 
connecting inflammation and insulin resistance. Although the contribution of chronic 
inflammation to insulin resistance is reasonably well established, therapeutic attempts to 
correct this have not had adequate success in clinical studies. Based on our findings with 
Gal3, one can raise the possibility that previous therapeutic attempts to ameliorate 
inflammation-induced insulin resistance and hyperglycemia have not been properly directed 
at the underlying mechanism. These studies indicate that inhibition of Gal3 could be a future 
approach to the treatment of insulin resistance.
Given the magnitude of the effects of Gal3, we conducted detailed in vitro studies to 
elucidate the mechanisms of Gal3-induced insulin resistance. Our studies showed that Gal3 
treatment led to decreased insulin signaling in adipocytes and myocytes (Figures 4 and 5). In 
3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myocytes, Gal3 treatment inhibited insulin stimulated glucose 
transport and GLUT4 translocation in a dose-responsive manner (Figures 3A-B and 4I-J). In 
hepatocytes, Gal3 blocked the effects of insulin to suppress glucagon-stimulated hepatic 
glucose production (Figure 3C). With respect to more in-depth mechanisms, we found that 
Gal3 treatment led to decreased insulin-stimulated IR tyrosine phosphorylation in myocytes 
and adipocytes (Figures 4A & B). All of the subsequent steps in insulin signaling, such as 
IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation, PDK1 activation, and AKT phosphorylation were also 
inhibited by Gal3 (Figures 4C-H and S6A-B). From these studies, we conclude that the 
major mechanism of action of Gal3 is to interact with the cell surface IR, inhibiting its 
function. This conclusion is strongly supported by our co-immunoprecipitation experiments 
which show a strong direct interaction between Gal3 and IR (Figures 5A-C). Interestingly, 
the interaction of Gal3 with the IR did not inhibit insulin binding. This suggests that Gal3 
and insulin bind to different sites on the IR and that Gal3 inhibits IR autophosphorylation by 
interfering with signal transmission from the IRα to β subunits. Based on these studies, we 
suggest that extracellular Gal3 can interact with the glycosylated cell surface IR, through the 
Gal3 CRD, leading to inhibition of IR tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream signaling 
which causes insulin resistance. What other surface proteins Gal3 might bind to is not 
currently known. Interestingly, the interaction between Gal3 and IR can be shown in the 
absence of insulin, but is increased in insulin-stimulated cells. This raises the possibility that 
insulin binding to the IR introduces a conformational change favoring Gal3 association, and 
that the interaction of Gal3 with the IR interferes with ligand-induced IR 
autophosphorylation.
In addition to directly causing decreased insulin signaling, Gal3 also promotes adipose tissue 
inflammation. This is exemplified by the in vitro effects of Gal3 to promote macrophage 
chemotaxis (Figure 2E). This concept is reinforced by the in vivo monocyte tracking studies, 
showing that migration of fluorescently labeled WT donor macrophages into adipose tissue 
and liver in Gal3 KO recipient mice is markedly reduced compared to WT recipients (Figure 
2G). This result is fully consistent with the decreased ATM content in HFD/obese Gal3 KO 
mice compared to HFD WT mice and to the decreased expression of inflammatory markers 
in adipose tissue in the KOs (Figures 2I-K).

 Previous studies have examined the effects of Gal3 KO on various aspects of atherosclerosis, 
glomerulopathy, hepatic steatosis, and obesity, but the current report is the first to provide an 
in-depth study of Gal3 on insulin action, insulin resistance and diabetes. With respect to 
metabolic aspects, these earlier studies provide conflicting results without clear conclusions 
in common among them. For example, Pejonovic et. al. reported that Gal3 KO leads to an 
obese phenotype on HFD, although they did not measure metabolic effects (Pejnovic et al., 
2013). However, in these studies, their WT mice did not gain weight on HFD diet, and this is 
rather inexplicable, since long-term 60% HFD causes obesity in male WT mice. In contrast, 
their Gal3 KO mice gained ~ 5g body weight over 18 weeks of 60% HFD. In our 
experience, male C57BL/6 mice always gain substantial weight after 18 weeks on 60% 
HFD, usually reaching body weights between 45-50g. Thus, even the 35g Gal3 KO mice 
reported by Pejonovic et.al., would be considered remarkably lean compared to most reports. 
Therefore, the “obese” phenotype of their Gal3 KOs is only in comparison to the lean WT 
mice which failed to gain weight on HFD. Pang et. al. studied a different strain of Gal3 KO 
mice, and also reported a modest degree of obesity in the KOs compared to WT(Pang et al., 
2013). However, in this case, the weight gain in both groups was also substantially less than 
one usually sees after 12 weeks upon 60% HFD in male C57BL/6 mice, with final body 
weights of about 38g compared to 45-50g. These investigators reported that the Gal3 KOs 
displayed glucose intolerance but also found that systemic antibiotic treatment, which 
normally improves glucose tolerance, as it did in their WT animals, had no effect on the 
KOs. Based on this, they attributed their phenotype, at least in part, to unspecified changes 
in the gut microbiome. A paper by Darrow et. al. showed increased glucose levels in Gal3 
KOs compared to WT on HFD. However, there was no significant difference in the basal 
glucose levels in the same experiment. Moreover, there were no differences in insulin 
sensitivity between the groups and plasma insulin levels were lower in the Gal3 KOs, 
suggesting beta cell dysfunction as a cause of hyperglycemia. We did not detect evidence for 
beta cell dysfunction in our studies, nor was this reported in earlier papers using these mice 
(Darrow and Shohet, 2015). Baek et. al., using the same strain of Gal3 KO mice as we have 
used, reported a lean phenotype in the Gal3 KOs on HFD, opposite from the first two papers 
mentioned above (Baek et al., 2015). This was associated with reduced inflammation and 
improved metabolism, as in our studies. There are two additional papers reporting results on 
female Gal3 KO mice (Iacobini et al., 2011; Iacobini et al., 2009). These papers are focused 
on either NASH or atherosclerosis, with one showing that the Gal3 KO mice were more 
susceptible to HFD-induced NASH, whereas the other showed that the KO mice were 
partially protected from atherosclerosis. Both papers found that WT and KO mice gained the 
same amount of weight on HFD, and most relevant to the current studies, both papers also 
showed that on HFD, the Gal3 KO mice had better glucose tolerance compared to WT. 
Although we cannot reconcile all of the conflicting data of the above-mentioned reports, we 
recognize that technical differences, breeding and housing changes, and microbiome 
differences could all contribute. However, we believe that the results reported in the current 
studies are quite comprehensive with multiple different measures indicating metabolic 
improvement in Gal3 KOs. This concept is supported by our findings of metabolic 
deterioration with Gal3 treatment or overexpression and metabolic benefit with 
administration of a Gal3 inhibitor.

 Our current studies report a marked improvement in obesity-associated inflammation, 
glucose tolerance and systemic insulin sensitivity in the Gal3 KOs on HFD, as well as in 
aged lean 8 month-old chow diet-fed animals (Figures 1 and S1). Importantly, we 
consistently observed no differences in body weight gain between WT and Gal3 KO mice on 
either HFD or chow diet over many different cohorts. We also demonstrated direct in vitro 
effects of Gal3 to decrease insulin signaling in adipocytes, hepatocytes, and myocytes and 
provide a cellular mechanism for this effect. Finally, we were able to reproduce the 
metabolic phenotype by BMT studies with Gal3 KO donor bone marrow, indicating that 
BM-derived immune cells are largely responsible for the phenotype. Together, our studies 
are fairly comprehensive, including both genetic and pharmacologic loss and gain of 
function studies, all providing internally consistent results. Overall, we conclude that Gal3 is 
a hematopoietic cell-secreted factor which can directly cause decreased insulin signaling and 
insulin resistance and, at the same time, promote adipose tissue inflammation. This suggests 
the idea that inhibition of Gal3 could be an anti-diabetic therapeutic avenue to achieve 
improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.
