Degeneration of cerebral white matter (WM), or structural disconnection, is one of the
major neural mechanisms driving age-related decline in cognitive functions, such as
processing speed. Past cross-sectional studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of
greater cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity, cognitive training, social engagement,
and nutrition on cognitive functioning and brain health in aging. Here, we collected
diffusion magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging data from 174 older (age 60–79) adults
to study the effects of 6-months lifestyle interventions on WM integrity. Healthy but
low-active participants were randomized into Dance, Walking, Walking + Nutrition,
and Active Control (stretching and toning) intervention groups (NCT01472744 on
ClinicalTrials.gov). Only in the fornix there was a time × intervention group interaction
of change in WM integrity: integrity declined over 6 months in all groups but increased in
the Dance group. Integrity in the fornix at baseline was associated with better processing
speed, however, change in fornix integrity did not correlate with change in processing
speed. Next, we observed a decline in WM integrity across the majority of brain regions
in all participants, regardless of the intervention group. This suggests that the aging
of the brain is detectable on the scale of 6-months, which highlights the urgency of
finding effective interventions to slow down this process. Magnitude of WM decline
increased with age and decline in prefrontal WM was of lesser magnitude in older adults
spending less time sedentary and more engaging in moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity. In addition, our findings support the anterior-to-posterior gradient of greater-to-
lesser decline, but only in the in the corpus callosum. Together, our findings suggest
that combining physical, cognitive, and social engagement (dance) may help maintain
or improve WM health and more physically active lifestyle is associated with slower
WM decline. This study emphasizes the importance of a physically active and socially
engaging lifestyle among aging adults.

Lifestyle Interventions and the Aging White Matter
INTRODUCTION
Disruption of (WM) microstructure—degeneration or loss of
axons and myelin—is considered one of the primary mechanisms
underlying age-related cognitive slowing and memory decline
(Gunning-Dixon and Raz, 2000; Madden et al., 2012). Therefore,
preventing age-related “structural disconnection” (Raz and
Rodrigue, 2006) or improving WM integrity is key in preserving
cognitive performance necessary for independent functioning in
older individuals.
WM microstructure can be studied non-invasively with
diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Diffusion imaging
provides voxel-wise estimation of magnitude and directionality
of water diffusion in WM. Fractional anisotropy (FA), is a
measure of the directional dependence of diffusion (Basser,
1995), and reflects fiber orientation, density and coherence
within a voxel (Beaulieu, 2002). Lowered FA has been
observed in various conditions in which loss of fiber integrity
occurs (Beaulieu, 2002), such as Alzheimer’s disease (Medina
et al., 2006). Radial diffusivity (RD) represents diffusivity
perpendicular to the main fiber direction (Basser, 1995; Song
et al., 2002). Increases in RD have been linked to degeneration
or loss of myelin (Song et al., 2003, 2005). Axial diffusivity
(AD) represents diffusion parallel to the axon fibers and is
related to axonal integrity (Basser, 1995; Song et al., 2002).
Finally, mean diffusivity (MD) reflects the magnitude of total
water diffusion within a voxel, which depends on the density
of physical obstructions such as cellular membranes (Beaulieu,
2002; Sen and Basser, 2005). Increased MD, paralleled by
increases in both RD and AD, was observed in conditions of WM
degeneration (Beaulieu et al., 1996; Beaulieu, 2002; Concha et al.,
2006).
To date, numerous neuroimaging studies described age-
related differences in WM properties using cross-sectional
comparisons (Burzynska et al., 2010; Madden et al., 2012). There
are, however, two critical obstacles in understanding the age-
related changes in WM and, subsequently, in slowing down
or reversing these age-related changes in the human brain.
First, there are still few studies describing age-related change
in WM integrity in a longitudinal design. Specifically, there
are only five studies that described changes in WM over time
and across numerous WM regions or tracts1. Sexton et al.
(2014) and Storsve et al. (2016) followed 203 adults between
20 and 84 years of age over on average 3.5 years. They
found extensive and overlapping, significant annual decreases
in FA, paralleled by increases in RD, AD, and MD. Rieckmann
et al. (2016) followed up 108 older adults over on average
2.6 years and found significant declines in FA and increases
in RD, AD, and MD. Bender et al. (2016b) found changes
in FA and RD over periods of time of 1 to 7 years in
healthy adults of age 50–84. Barrick et al. (2010) observed
significant decline in FA in healthy adults 50–90 years old over
2 years.
1Vik et al. (2015) found decline in fronto-striatal FA over a period of 3 years in
76 adults of 49–80 age at inclusion (only FA for selected tracts was analyzed).
Similarly, Pfefferbaum et al. (2014) reported decline in FA across white matter in
56 older individuals over 1–8 years (control sample).
Some of these studies reported acceleration of microstructural
decline in older age (Sexton et al., 2014; Bender et al., 2016b;
Storsve et al., 2016), but other did not (Barrick et al., 2010).
Some argued the superior-to-inferior gradient of greater-to-
lesser decline (Sexton et al., 2014; Storsve et al., 2016), while
longitudinal data (Barrick et al., 2010) did not support “last-in-
first-out” hypothesis of anterior-to-posterior decline suggested in
cross-sectional studies (Bartzokis et al., 2010).
Together, these studies show consistent decline in WM
integrity represented by increases in RD, AD, and MD, and
decreases in FA. However, there is no consensus on the spatial
gradient of decline and WM decline has not been observed
over periods shorter than a year. Knowing short-term dynamics
of WM decline would be useful in assessing the outcomes
of typically short-term interventions (months) as well as in
differentiating between normal and abnormal speed of decline
in patients presenting first cognitive symptoms. Finally, there is
little evidence for the ability to improve WM integrity in older
adults. Cross-sectional studies suggest that lifestyle factors such
as physical activity (PA) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are
protective against cognitive and neural decline. For example,
we have shown that greater PA and CRF are associated with
greater WM integrity (Burzynska et al., 2014; Oberlin et al.,
2016) and that older aerobically trained athletes have greater
brain structural integrity and cognitive performance than their
sedentary low-fit peers (Tseng et al., 2013; Burzynska et al., 2015;
Young et al., 2016). However, a recent meta-analysis showed only
modest cross-sectional effects of CRF and aerobic PA on WM in
aging (Sexton et al., 2016). The longitudinal evidence for positive
effect of exercise on WM is still very scarce. Voss et al. (2010)
demonstrated in 70 adults (55–80 years old) that increases in
CRF as a result of 1-year the aerobic walking intervention was
associated with fronto-temporal increase in FA and enhanced
short-term memory. However, there was no difference between
the walking and the active control group (stretching and toning)
in their changes of WM integrity over 1-year.
In the current study we address these two critical limitations
of the existing studies: short-term dynamics in WM change
in different diffusivity parameters, and the effects of lifestyle
interventions to improve WM integrity in aging.
To this aim, we collected diffusion, cognitive, CRF and PA
data from 174 healthy, non-demented (MMSE>26) adults 60–79
years old at baseline2, and after a 6-months lifestyle intervention
(randomized clinical trial, NCT01472744 on ClinicalTrials.gov).
The interventions included aerobic exercise (Walking) and an
Active Control group (stretching and toning, not aimed to
increase CRF). In addition, we included a group that combined
aerobic PA, cognitive, and social stimulation (Dance), and an
aerobic Walking that also received a nutritional supplement
(Walking + Nutrition).
We expected to observe a time × group interaction, with
Walking and Dance groups showing maintenance or increase in
WM integrity as compared to the decline in the Active Control
group. We expected to observe this effect especially in the frontal

and temporal regions (Colcombe et al., 2006; Voss et al., 2010).
Next, we expected to observe declines in FA and increases in
MD, RD, and AD across the WM and that this decline will be
accelerated in the oldest, more sedentary, less active, and less fit
(lower CRF) adults. However, given the shorter time scale, we
expected these changes to be of smaller magnitude and more
spatially restricted than in the existing studies with time lags
greater than a year. Finally, we expected that change in FA in
the Walking or Dance groups would be behaviorally relevant, i.e.,
be related to change in cognitive performance, especially in the
speed and memory domains (Lövdén et al., 2014; Wang et al.,
2015; Bender et al., 2016a) as compared to crystallized and fluid
abilities (Virginia Cognitive Aging Project Battery; Salthouse and
Ferrer-Caja, 2003; Salthouse, 2004, 2005, 2010)3.
METHODS
Participants
The University of Illinois institutional review board approved
this study, written informed consent was obtained from all
participants and the study was performed in accordance with
the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. The sample was recruited to
participate in a randomized controlled exercise trial (“Influence
of Fitness on Brain and Cognition II” at ClinicalTrials.gov,
clinical study identifier NCT01472744). Healthy, low active older
adults were recruited in the Champaign county area to participate
in a series of neuroimaging, cognitive, and cardiorespiratory
testing, before and after a 6-months aerobic exercise intervention
program. Of the 1,119 participants recruited, 247 (n = 169
women) met inclusion criteria and agreed to enroll in the
study (See Supplementary Material 1 for subject flow). Eligible
participants met the following criteria: (1) were between the
ages of 60 and 80 years old; (2) were free from psychiatric and
neurological illness and had no history of stroke or transient
ischemic attack; (3) scored <10 on the geriatric depression
scale (GDS-15); (4) scored ≥75% right-handedness on the
Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire; (5) demonstrated normal
or corrected-to-normal vision of at least 20/40 and no color
blindness; (6) cleared for suitability in the MRI environment; that
is, no metallic implants that could interfere with the magnetic
field or cause injury, no claustrophobia, and no history of head
trauma; (7) reported to have participated in no more than two
moderate bouts of exercise per week within the past 6-months; (8)
were not taking medication for cardiovascular disease (e.g., beta
blocker, diuretics), neurological, or psychiatric conditions (e.g.,
antidepressant, neuroleptic, anxiolytic). The sample contained
more females because fewer older males met the above inclusion
criteria or showed willingness to participate in the study. After
the baseline measurement, the participants were randomized
using a computer data management system and baseline-
adaptive randomization scheme (Begg and Iglewicz, 1980) into
four intervention group (Walking n = 54, Walking + Nutrition
n = 54, Dance n = 69, Active Control n = 70). Randomization

not discussed here but described in the Supplementary Material
2); (3) Street crossing assessment (data presented elsewhere);
(4) MRI session; (5) Treadmill test (CRF testing). We aimed
to complete the above sessions within 3 weeks, but due to
participant’s availability it took longer for several subjects. All
tests were completed at least 1 day before intervention onset.
Sessions 2–5 were repeated after 6-months intervention.
Interventions
Following baseline cognitive and cardiorespiratory assessment,
participants were randomized into one of the four intervention
groups, taking into account equal distributions of age and gender:
Dance, Walking, Walking + Nutrition, and Active Control.
All participants attended supervised, 1-h sessions three times
per week for 6-months. Dance: This intervention was designed
to improve physical fitness as well as aspects of cognition
necessary for learning complex social dance sequences in a
socially engaging environment. Sessions were conducted in an
appropriate dance space and were taught by experienced dance
instructors. The choreographed dance combinations became
progressively more challenging over the course of the 6-months
program. Group social dance styles were selected (i.e., Contra
and English Country dancing) to minimize lead-follow roles.
Instead, these social dances required participants to move
between partners during each dance. Each participant learned
and alternated between two roles for each dance, increasing the
cognitive challenge. Walking: This intervention was designed to
increase CRF through brisk walking. Research staff supervised
all walking sessions. Frequent assessment of heart rate, using
either palpation or Polar Heart Rate Monitors, and rating of
perceived exertion ensured that participants’ exercise intensity
was performed at the prescribed level. Exercise logs were
completed after each exercise session to assess exercise frequency,
intensity (RPE) and enjoyment levels. Walking + Nutrition: The
Walking + Nutrition condition engaged in the same protocol as
those in the walking condition. Additionally, they ingested a daily
supplement supplied by Abbot Nutrition that contained beta-
alanine. Beta alanine is thought to promote an increase in lean
muscle mass (Zoeller et al., 2007), thereby enhancing the effect of
increased CRF on brain health to boost the effect of increased
CRF on brain health. Research staff supervised all walking
sessions. Frequent assessment of heart rate, using either palpation
or Polar Heart Rate Monitors, and rating of perceived exertion
ensured that participants’ exercise intensity was performed at the
prescribed level. Exercise logs were completed after each exercise
session. Participants were instructed to take the supplement drink
daily, which was a liquid, milk-based formula supplied by Abbott
Nutrition. Active Control: This intervention served as the active
control group to account for the social engagement in the other
interventions. A trained exercise specialist at a facility on the
University of Illinois campus conducted all strength and balance

sessions. This program focused on improving strength, stretching
and stability for the whole body and was specifically designed for
individuals 60 years of age and older. The program includes non-
aerobic stretches, simple strength exercises, and basic balancing
activities for all the large muscle groups. Each stretch was gently
held to a point of slight tension but not pain for approximately
20–30 s. Each stretching and toning session included a 10–15 min
warm-up and cool-down and 30–45 min of the above described
stretching and toning exercises. Participants completed exercise
logs on a weekly basis. The intervention was conducted in four
waves from October 2011 to November 2014.
Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)
Diffusion-weighted images were acquired on a 3T Siemens Trio
Tim system with 45 mT/m gradients and 200 T/m/s slew rates
(Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). All images were obtained parallel
to the anterior-posterior commissure plane with no interslice
gap. DTI images were acquired with a twice-refocused spin
echo single-shot Echo Planar Imaging sequence (Reese et al.,
2003) to minimize eddy current-induced image distortions.
The protocol consisted of a set of 30 non-collinear diffusion-
weighted acquisitions with b-value = 1,000 s/mm2 and two T2-
weighted b-value = 0 s/mm2 acquisitions, repeated two times
(TR/TE = 5,500/98 ms, 128 × 128 matrix, 1.7 × 1.7 mm2 in-
plane resolution, FA = 90, GRAPPA acceleration factor 2, and
bandwidth of 1698 Hz/Px, comprising 40 3-mm-thick slices).
DTI Analysis
DTI allows inferences about WM microstructure in vivo by
quantifying the magnitude and directionality of diffusion of water
within a tissue (Beaulieu, 2002). Visual checks were performed on
every volume of the raw data of every participant by AZB and TC.
In case a diffusion scan contained more than two volumes with
artifacts, these volumes as well as the corresponding b-vectors
and b-values were removed before processing. If artifacts were
found in more than two volumes, such datasets were excluded
from analyses, resulting in 174 good quality pre-post datasets
(Supplementary Material 1).
Next, DTI data were processed using the FSL Diffusion
Toolbox v.3.0 (FDT: http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) in a standard
multistep procedure, including: (a) motion and eddy current
correction of the images and corresponding b-vectors, (b)
removal of the skull and non-brain tissue using the Brain
Extraction Tool (Smith, 2002), and (c) voxel-by-voxel calculation
of the diffusion tensors. Using the diffusion tensor information,
FA maps were computed using DTIFit within the FDT. All
motion- and eddy-current outputs, as well as FA images were
visually inspected.
We used tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS, a toolbox within
FSL v5.0.1), to create a representation of main WM tracts
common to all subjects (also commonly known as the WM
“skeleton”) (Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, Smith et al., 2004,
2006, 2007). This included: (1) nonlinear alignment of each
participant’s FA volume to the 1 × 1 × 1 mm3 standard Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI152) space via the FMRIB58_FA
template using the FMRIB’s Nonlinear Registration Tool (FNIRT,
Rueckert et al., 1999), (2) calculation of the mean of all aligned FA
images, (3) creation of the WM “skeleton” by perpendicular non-
maximum-suppression of the mean FA image and setting the FA
threshold to 0.25, and (4) perpendicular projection of the highest
FA value (local center of the tract) onto the skeleton, separately
for each subject. The same procedures were applied to baseline
and post-intervention images.
Next, we selected regions of interest on the TBSS skeleton
with the use of the DTI WM atlas to probe FA in the core
parts of the selected tracts (Burzynska et al., 2013). The 20 WM
tracts and their respective acronyms are specified in Figure 3. The
prefrontal WM region was defined as y > 12 in MNI coordinate
space and whole WM included the whole TBSS skeleton. Corpus
callosum was segmented as in Hofer and Frahm (2006).
Virginia Cognitive Aging Battery
We administered a cognitive battery as described in the
Virginia Cognitive Aging Project to measure latent constructs
of fluid intelligence (Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices
test), perceptual speed (letter comparison, patter comparison,
digit symbol substitution), and vocabulary (vocabulary, picture
vocabulary, synonym vocabulary, and antonym vocabulary;
Salthouse and Ferrer-Caja, 2003; Salthouse, 2004, 2005, 2010;
Supplementary Material 2). The computer-based tasks were
programmed in E-Prime version 1.1 (Psychology Software Tools,
Pittsburgh, PA) and administered on computers with 17” cathode
ray tube monitors. Several participants had missing or invalid
data for single tasks 0.165 out of 174 had complete cognitive data.
To obtain components representing the four cognitive
constructs and to confirm the validity of task structure as
presented in Salthouse and Ferrer-Caja (2003), we performed
principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation.
Individual scores on each of the 16 tasks were first screened for
outliers and winsorized [maximum 5 cases out of 174 (<3%) were
adjusted per variable]. The resulting constructs are presented in
Supplementary Material 2. The component scores were saved as
variables.
Cardiorespiratory Fitness (CRF)
Baseline CRF was used to predict the change in FA over 6-months
of intervention. Participants received consent from their personal
physician before cardiorespiratory fitness testing was conducted.
CRF (VO2 peak) was assessed by graded maximal exercise testing
on a motor-driven treadmill. The protocol involves walking at
a self-selected pace with incremental grades of 2–3% every 2
min. Measurements of oxygen uptake, heart rate and blood
pressure were constantly monitored. Oxygen uptake (VO2) was
measured from expired air samples taken at 30-s intervals until
a peak or maximum VO2 (VO2 peak or max) was attained; test
termination was determined by symptom limitation, volitional
exhaustion, and/or attainment of VO2 peak as per ACSM
guidelines (acsm.org). Due to technical problems CRF data was
not collected from 2 participants, resulting in n = 172 for CRF.
Objective Physical Activity (PA)
Assessment
Quantitative baseline PA was used to assess baseline lifestyle PA
and predict the change in FA over 6-months of intervention.

 Burzynska et al.
Lifestyle Interventions and the Aging White Matter
PA was measured by accelerometer (Model GT1M or GT3X;
Actigraph, Pensacola, FL). Each participant was instructed to
wear the accelerometer on the non-dominant hip during waking
hours for 7 consecutive days, and record the time that they wore
the device each day on a log. When scored with an interruption
period of 60 min, those with at least 10 h of wear time on at least
3 days were retained in analyses (Troiano et al., 2008; Peterson
et al., 2010). These data were downloaded as activity counts,
which represent raw accelerations that have been summed over
a specific epoch length (e.g., 60 s), and these counts vary based
on frequency and intensity of the recorded acceleration (Fanning
et al., 2016). Next, these data were processed using cut points
designed specifically for older adults (Copeland and Esliger,
2009) such that 50 or fewer counts per minute corresponded with
sedentary behavior, 51–1,040 counts per minute corresponded
to light PA, and 1,041 counts or greater represented moderate-
to-vigorous PA (MVPA), related to increased heart rate and
ventilation (Rejeski et al., 2016). Five participants did not have
valid accelerometer data, resulting in final sample of 169 for PA.
Statistical Analyses
To investigate the effects of time and time x group interactions for
the group of 174 participants we used repeated measures ANOVA
in SPSS v.24 as our data were complete and the interval between
baseline and post-intervention measurements was same for all
participants (Liu et al., 2012).
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics at Baseline
First, we tested whether randomization based on age and
gender resulted in same baseline characteristics among the four
intervention groups. Table 1 shows the demographics for the
final sample of 174 people who had good quality of pre and post-
intervention diffusion scans. One-way ANOVA revealed that
the different intervention groups did not differ at baseline with
respect to age, gender, education, BMI, VO2 peak (n = 172), PA
(N = 169), and cognitive status (MMSE).
Next, we investigated baseline characteristics in various
diffusion measures. Regional values for FA, RD, MD, and AD
for the whole sample and for each of the intervention groups
are shown in the Supplementary Material 3. Using one-way
ANOVA, we determined that FA, RD, AD and MD measures
did not significantly differ among the four intervention groups
at baseline in any of the region (for details see Supplementary
Tables 3.1 to 3.4).
Changes in WM Diffusivity Characteristics
over 6-Months
Next, we examined change in FA, RD, AD, and MD over 6-
months of the intervention. We found that time had a significant
effect on all diffusivity values in multiple regions. Table 2
represents mean regional % change for the entire sample (n =
174, p < 0.05, uncorrected) and the Active Control group (no
expected change in CRF or MVPA that would affect cognition
or brain health). As we observed only one time x group
interaction (fornix, see Section Change in diffusivity parameters:
the effects of intervention), we consider the results of entire
sample consistent with the Active Control.
In sum, out of 21 regions, FA consistently decreased in 11
regions as well as in the prefrontal WM and the entire skeleton.
RD increased in 13 regions as well as in the prefrontal WM and
the entire skeleton. AD increased in 10 regions as well as in whole
WM. MD increased in 10 regions, as well as in the prefrontal WM
and the entire skeleton. This regionally specific pattern of overlap
of changes in FA, RD, and AD is summarized in Figure 1 (MD is
not included as highly redundant to RD and AD). Only in fMAJ
RD, AD, and MD decreased.
Change in Diffusivity Parameters: The
Effects of Intervention
We used repeated measures ANOVA with time as within-
subject factor and the four intervention groups as between-
subject factors to investigate differences in FA change between
the three intervention groups and the Active Control group
(Supplementary Material 4). Out of 21 regions, only the fornix

Lifestyle Interventions and the Aging White Matter
Relation of Change in Diffusivity to
Cognitive Performance
We tested whether the increase in FA in the fornix in the
Dance group had cognitive relevance. 165 out of 174 participants
had complete cognitive data. Using one-way ANOVA, we
found no significant group differences for any of the four
cognitive constructs at the baseline (Supplementary Material 6).
Next, correlation of baseline fornix FA with the four cognitive
constructs yielded a positive association only for processing speed
(r = 0.19, p = 0.013, n = 165, 2-tailed; significant after Bonferroni
correction to p = 0.013 but not significant if controlled for
age; Figure 3), but not for memory, vocabulary or reasoning
(p > 0.05). Therefore, further analyses were restricted to the
processing speed. First, we did post-hoc correlations between
baseline fornix FA and the three tasks within the processing
speed construct. They were all positively related to fornix FA:
digit symbol (r = 0.18, p = 0.021, n = 173), pattern comparison
(r = 0.17, p = 0.029, n = 174) and letter comparison (r = 0.15,
p = 0.047, n = 174). These post-hoc analyses were not corrected
for multiple comparisons. Repeated measures ANOVA on these
three tasks revealed significant effect of time for the digit symbol
[F(1, 166) = 3027.728, p = 0.000] and pattern comparison [F(1, 166)
= 19.165, p = 0.002]: all groups showed increased performance
over the 6-months of the trial (significant at corrected p = 0.016).
Given lack of time x group interaction for processing speed, we
correlated % change in the task performance with % change in
fornix FA, but found no significant effects (r = −0.05, p = 0.492,
n = 172).
Effect of Age, CRF, and PA on FA Decline
over 6-Months
We investigated whether the decrease in FA accelerates in older
age. To this aim, we correlated % change in FA with chronological
age, controlling for the intervention group. The correlation
FIGURE 3 | Correlation between fornix FA and processing speed

was significant in fMAJ (r = −0.26, p = 0.000, df = 171),
IFOF_ILF_occ (r = −0.16, p = 0.033, df = 171), SCR (r = −0.17
p = 0.025, df = 171), and whole WM (r = −0.19, p = 013, df =
171; Figure 4). Only fMAJ remained significant after Bonferroni
correction.
Given the relationships between CRF and PA and WM
integrity (Burzynska et al., 2014), we investigated whether greater
CRF and levels of PA or sedentary time at baseline were
associated with lesser decline in FA over 6-months. A correlation
of baseline CRF or light PA and % change in FA, controlled
for age, yielded no significant relationships4. Greater MVPA was
related to more positive change in FA in the prefrontal WM,
controlled for age (r = 0.15, p = 0.048, not corrected). More time
spend on sedentary behavior at baseline was associated with more
negative change in FA in cc2 section of the corpus callosum (r
= −0.18, p = 0.018, df = 166) and in the prefrontal WM (r =
−0.16, p = 0.036, df = 166, not corrected), controlled for age.
Repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant interaction
time × gender interaction, indicating no sex difference in FA
decline over 6-months.
DISCUSSION
We investigated changes in WM microstructure over 6-months
in 174 healthy non-demented older adults that underwent four
lifestyle interventions. Our main findings are: (1) Only the fornix
showed a time x intervention group interaction, namely, FA
declined in all groups but increased in the Dance group. Changes
in FA were paralleled by changes in RD and MD; (2) FA in the
fornix at baseline was related to processing speed, however, there
was neither time x intervention group interaction for processing
speed nor correlation between change in speed and change in
FA; (3) FA decreased over 6-months in the majority of tracts,
while RD, AD, and MD increased; (4) There was a spatially-
variable pattern of overlap of changes in FA, RD, AD, and MD;
(5) Older age was related to greater magnitude of FA decline,
especially in fMAJ, IFOF_ILF_occ, SCR, and whole WM; (6) Less
sedentariness and more MVPA was associated with less negative
change in FA. We discuss these finding in relation to recent
longitudinal and intervention studies, theories of neurocognitive
aging, and outline future research directions.
Dance Intervention Improved FA in the
Fornix
We found that while FA in the fornix declined over 6-months in
most groups, it increased in the Dance group. Greater FA in the
fornix at baseline was associated with faster processing speed, also
at baseline. We discuss this observation in terms of the role of the
fornix in cognition, mechanisms underlying increase in FA, and
dance as a complex intervention.
4Partial correlations controlling for gender, or age and gender yielded the same
results. Correlations between % change in FA and baseline CRF within each gender
group were also not significant (gender was included as VO2 max or peak differs
between genders).

Role of the Fornix in Cognition
The fornix acts as the major output tract of the hippocampus
that connects the medial temporal lobes to the mammillary
nuclei of the hypothalamus, septal area, and the basal forebrain
(Thomas et al., 2011). The fornix is known to play an
important role in the encoding, consolidation, and recall of
declarative and episodic memory (Thomas et al., 2011). Damage
to the fornix as a result of mechanical injury, tumor, or
neurodegenerative diseases has been linked to anterograde
amnesia and episodic memory impairments (Douet and Chang,
2015). In addition, microstructural and volume changes to the
fornix and mammillary bodies have been linked to transition
from mild cognitive impairment to clinical Alzheimer’s disease
(Copenhaver et al., 2006; Mielke et al., 2012; Fletcher et al.,
2013; Rémy et al., 2015). In the current study, we observed
no relationships between fornix FA and memory. Instead, we
found associations with processing speed. We speculate that the
relationships between WM microstructure and cognition may be
different in clinical samples and in healthy age-related decline.
For example, studies including lifespan or healthy older samples
showed that fornix integrity correlates not only with episodic
memory (Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2011), but also with working
memory, motor performance and problem solving (Zahr et al.,
2009). As most lifespan studies did not relate fornix integrity
to a broader array of cognitive tasks, there is little evidence
for the specific role of the fornix in other cognitive domains.
Importantly, there is a study that reported specific relationships
between fornix integrity and processing speed but not memory in
temporal lobe epilepsy patients (Alexander et al., 2014). Together,
our results confirm previous associations of WM microstructure
and cognitive function in aging and suggest a role of the fornix in
cognition beyond long-term memory (Madden et al., 2012).
Mechanisms of Increased FA
Increases in FA reflect increase in anisotropy of the tissue (Sen
and Basser, 2005). This implies changes in the microstructure
that would result in more directional diffusion if the water
molecules. We showed that this interaction was driven by lack of
decrease in RD and the related maintenance of MD. This points
to restricted diffusion perpendicular to main fiber direction,
which is related to presence and integrity of axonal membrane
and myelin. In other words, at the cellular level, the suggested
increase in FA is most likely related to stabilization or increase
in myelin integrity (Burzynska et al., 2010). There is in vitro
and animal evidence that repetitive stimulation of certain WM
connections, such as in learning of complex motor skills in
mice, results in increased myelination (McKenzie et al., 2014). In
addition, there is in vivo evidence for increases in FA as a result
of training in healthy adults (Bengtsson et al., 2005; Scholz et al.,
2009; Sampaio-Baptista et al., 2013).
However, there may be an alternative explanation for
increased FA, and reduced RD and MD, namely, macrostructural
rather than microstructural changes. Fornix is a thin tract
surrounded by lateral ventricles and therefore affected by partial

volume with cerebrospinal fluid. The Dance intervention might
have increased the volume of the fornix, leading to decreased
partial volume and decreased RD and MD. Local increases in
WM volume and macrostructural integrity have been observed as
a result of lifestyle interventions with physical activity (Colcombe
et al., 2006; Bolandzadeh et al., 2015). In sum, we speculate
that the observed increase in FA results from both macro- and
micro-structural reorganization of the fornix.
Dance as a Complex Intervention
Dance is a pleasurable and captivating activity, which involves
aerobic exercise, sensorimotor stimulation, and cognitive,
visuospatial, social, and emotional engagement. Epidemiological
studies found that ballroom dance has also been associated with
a protective effective against dementia onset in older adults
(Verghese et al., 2003) and reduced depression in community-
dwelling older adults with depression (Haboush et al., 2006).
Indeed, there is increasing interest in dance as a therapeutic
intervention for various clinical groups (Dhami et al., 2015), such
as in Parkinson’s disease (McNeely et al., 2015) and dementia
(Ballesteros et al., 2015; Adam et al., 2016). Our current data
indicate that this broad, multimodal stimulation had greater
benefit for WM integrity than aerobic exercise alone (i.e.,
Walking and Walking + Nutrition). This is in line with recent
findings that combined exercise and cognitive interventions have
more benefit for cognitive, physical, and mental health in older
population than each intervention alone (Oswald et al., 2006;
Law et al., 2014; Bamidis et al., 2015; Lauenroth et al., 2016).
Combined cognitive and physical interventions may also have
more long-lasting effects (Rahe et al., 2015). Interestingly, despite
positive changes in the WM in the Dance group, we found no
cognitive benefit for any of the intervention groups. This may
be explained by the observation that changes in neuroimaging
outcomes may precede changes in cognition by several years
in older population (Jack and Holtzman, 2013). Therefore,
improvements in cognition may not be detectable after 6-months
of intervention, with most participants improving due to test-
retest effect. Future interventions of longer duration are required
to test this hypothesis of cognitive benefits following neural
changes. Also, available evidence for correlations between decline
in FA and cognitive change come from measurements acquired
at least 2 years apart (Lövdén et al., 2014; Ritchie et al., 2015;
Bender et al., 2016a). Together, although evaluation of decline or
increase in WM integrity over 6-months gives insight into short-
term neural dynamics in old age, it may not be sufficient to detect
robust brain-cognition correlations and effects of intervention
groups on cognition.
WM Microstructure Changes over
6-Months
We observed significant time effects on WM microstructure
over a 6-months period in majority of tracts. Currently, this
is the shortest period of time over which changes in WM
microstructures in healthy older adults have been detected. We
discuss our findings in terms of magnitude of annual % change,
spatial overlap of changes in FA, RD, AD, and MD, and spatial
gradient of change.
Magnitude of Change
We carefully compared the observed magnitudes of % change
over 6-months with annual % changes reported in three previous
longitudinal studies and one intervention. For this comparison
we chose to focus on changes in diffusivity values for the whole
WM as most comparable to global WM or averages across tracts
reported in other studies.
We observed the greatest semi-annual change in RD (+0.61,
+0.85%), followed by MD (+0.44, +0.58%), FA (–0.38, –0.68%)
and AD (+0.27, +0.32%; for whole sample and the active control,
respectively). These values are of the same order and a very
similar magnitude as annual % change in 203 neurologically
healthy (MMSE>25) adults over the span of 3.6 years (Sexton
et al., 2014). Specifically, using same tools as in the current
study (TBSS) to create representation of major WM tracts, the
authors reported the following annual % change for the whole
WM skeleton: RD +0.50%, MD +0.30%, FA −0.30%, and AD
+0.20% (Sexton et al., 2014). A subsequent tract-based analysis
of a subset of this dataset (n = 118) yielded the average annual
changes of RD +0.60%, MD +0.43%, AD +0.29%, and FA
−0.27% (Storsve et al., 2016). Similarly, in a sample of 108
cognitively normal (MMSE>26) adults aged 66–87 measured on
average 2.6 years apart, mean annual change in FA over several
tracts was −0.5% (Rieckmann et al., 2016). Finally, Voss et al.
(2013b) compared changes in lobar diffusivity properties of 55 to
80 years old healthy adults (mMMSE>51) randomized into two
intervention groups: aerobic walking group and stretching-tonic
active control. We averaged diffusivity values of the 4 lobes to
obtain annual % change for the whole WM (TBSS skeleton). The
values were +0.43% for RD, −0.42% for FA, and +0.15% for AD
for 35 adults in the stretching-toning group, consistent with the
above reports.
Together, magnitudes of % annual change are consistent
across the existing studies and exceed estimates from cross-
sectional designs (Barrick et al., 2010; Lövdén et al., 2014;
Rieckmann et al., 2016). The small deviations in magnitude of
change seem to depend on analysis method of the diffusion data:
skeleton-based used by Sexton et al. (2016), Voss et al. (2013b),
and current study, tract-based used by Storsve et al. (2016) and
Rieckmann et al. (2016). In addition, sample’s age may influence
the observed FA decline. Studies reporting greater magnitude of
change (Voss et al., 2013b; Rieckmann et al., 2016) included older
sample (55+) while Sexton et al. (2014) and Storsve et al. (2016)
used adult lifespan sample (age 23–87) to estimate annual change.
Thus, greater magnitude of change observed in our study may be
due to acceleration of changes in WM diffusivity in the 5th decade
and thereafter (Sexton et al., 2014). It remains to be determined
whether studying change in center of tracts with maximal tract
coherence is more or less sensitive to detecting change in WM
microstructure as compared to studying the entire volume of the
tracts.
Patterns of Overlap in FA, RD, AD, and MD Changes
We observed a pattern of spatial overlap of changes in different
diffusivity parameters. The whole WM (i.e., the skeleton) showed
significant decreases in FA overlapping with RD and AD
increases (and the resulting increases in MD). This pattern was

also present in projection fibers (both limbs of the internal
capsule, superior corona radiate), limbic system structures (WM
near hippocampus, fornix), association fibers (inferior fronto-
occipital fasciculus), and in the commissural fibers (genu corpus
callosum). In our earlier cross-sectional work we referred to this
pattern of diffusivity changes as “chronic WM degeneration”
(Burzynska et al., 2010), as it has been observed in chronic or
advanced stages of WM degeneration. This involves an increase
in extracellular volume fraction resulting from losses in both
axons and myelin (Thomalla et al., 2004; Cosottini et al., 2005;
Sen and Basser, 2005; Concha et al., 2006; Lindquist et al.,
2007; Sidaros et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008). In line with our
earlier cross-sectional work (Burzynska et al., 2010), we localized
this “chronic” pattern of microstructural changes to the genu
corpus callosum and association fibers. These structures are
known to be most vulnerable to environmental and metabolic
challenges due to thin myelin and low oligodendrocyte-to-
axon ratio (Pfefferbaum and Sullivan, 2001; Bartzokis, 2004;
Bartzokis et al., 2004). While in the cross-sectional study this
“chronic” pattern accounted for 24% of WM volume showing
age differences in FA (Burzynska et al., 2010), in the current
longitudinal analyses the “chronic” pattern dominated the WM
skeleton.
We observed decreases in FA in parallel with increases in
RD in association fibers (anterior cingulum, occipital part of
the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and prefrontal part of the
uncinate fasciculus). This pattern of increased diffusivity change
perpendicular to the main fiber direction has been associated
with myelin loss or degeneration (Song et al., 2002, 2005;
Ciccarelli et al., 2006; Burzynska et al., 2010) suggesting that these
tracts undergo predominantly short–term myelin changes.
We reported decrease increases in RD and AD, and MD
without a net change in FA in the premotor section of the corpus
callosum (cc2) and in the superior longitudinal fasciculus. We
interpret this pattern as subtle changes in both axons and myelin,
which are likely to progress to the “chronic” stage with significant
FA decrease. We consider fiber reorganization less likely given
increase in MD, indicating decrease in cellular barriers within
these WM regions. In one region (fMAJ) we found decreases
in both RD and AD. Decrease of diffusivity has been related to
increase in tissue density such as in gliosis (Burzynska et al.,
2010), or with increased partial volume with surrounding gray
matter.
Finally,
some
regions
showed
no
significant
change
in
diffusivity
during
6-months.
These
include
forceps
minor
(anterior thalamic radiations), WM of the gyrus
rectus
(fibers
of
frontal
pole
and
orbitofrontal
cortex),
inferior
longitudinal
fasciculus
(temporal
lobe),
posterior
cingulum, and the body and splenium of the corpus callosum
(motor,
sensory
and
parieto-occipital
sections;
cc3–cc5).
These structures showed only weak age differences in FA
or no age difference in our earlier cross-sectional work
(Burzynska et al., 2010). Therefore, microstructure in these
regions may be relatively stable throughout the adulthood,
with subtle decline from early to late adulthood but no
significant short-term changes during 7th and 8th decade of
life.
In sum, longitudinal patterns of diffusivity changes confirm
previous cross-sectional evidence for spatially variable increases
in RD, AD, MD, and decreases in FA. In contrast to cross-
sectional analyses, 6-months longitudinal data provided no
evidence for decreases in MD, RD, and AD (except for fMAJ).
Qualitative differences in diffusivity patterns across WM regions
between cross-sectional and longitudinal samples suggest region-
specific and non-linear time courses of adult age changes in WM
microstructure.
Spatial Gradients of Change
There have been several attempts to organize the age-related
changes using developmental or anatomical frameworks. Sexton
et al. (2014) described an inferior-to superior gradient of lesser-
to-greater age related changes. This framework builds on cross-
sectional evidence that superior fibers may be more vulnerable
to age-related changes (Sullivan et al., 2010a; Sullivan and
Pfefferbaum, 2010b) and that WM maturation proceeds from
inferior to superior regions (Colby et al., 2011). The related “last
in, first out” developmental framework posits that tracts that
myelinate last in ontogenic development are most vulnerable and
first undergo age-related deterioration (Bartzokis et al., 2010).
Prefrontal regions and related association fibers myelinate late as
compared to motor and sensory regions. Based on this, the “last
in, first out” framework can be refined to anterior-to-posterior
gradient of greater to lesser decline (Raz et al., 2005). Clearly,
within the corpus callosum, our findings support the anterior-to-
posterior, “last in, first out” hypothesis, with the “chronic” pattern
of diffusivity changes in the genu and no changes observed in
the posterior to middle sections. A similar gradient can be seen
within the cingulum bundle. However, the mixed pattern of
changes in the remaining tracts does not equivocally support any
other developmental or anatomical framework. Namely, over 6-
months, we observed changes in both superior, inferior, as well as
both anterior and posterior association and projection tracts.
Together, the reported WM changes over a 6-months period
will have important implications for planning the timeline
of future interventions and longitudinal studies, as well for
diagnostic follow-ups. For example, knowing that change is
robustly detectable over 6-months, the magnitude of decline in
FA or other parameters could be used in identifying accelerated
slopes and, therefore, individuals at risk of cognitive decline or
conversion to MCI at early stages.
Effects of Age, CRF, and PA on FA Decline
We found that FA decline increased in magnitude with advancing
age, especially in fMAJ, IFOF_ILF_occ, SCR, and whole WM.
This is consistent with previous reports of accelerated WM
decline after 5th decade of life (Storsve et al., 2016). We found
no effects of gender and CRF on FA changes. Interestingly, we
found that adults engaging in more MVPA and spending less
time on sedentary behaviors showed less negative change in
FA, especially in the prefrontal WM. Prefrontal regions have
been shown previously to benefit from exercise interventions
(Colcombe et al., 2006; Voss et al., 2013b). There are a number
of not mutually exclusive mechanisms of action of active lifestyle
on the brain: increased levels of neurotrophic and insulin-like

growth factors (Carro et al., 2000; Zoladz et al., 2008; Rasmussen
et al., 2009; Voss et al., 2013a), better brain perfusion and
cerebrovascular health (Black et al., 1990; Bullitt et al., 2009;
Thomas and Baker, 2013), as well as lesser metabolic distress
related to reduced sedentary behaviors (Yanagibori et al., 1998;
Hamilton et al., 2004; Demiot et al., 2007; Hamburg et al., 2007).
Our longitudinal results suggest, similar to our previous cross-
sectional findings (Burzynska et al., 2014), that only exercise
and avoiding sedentariness can slow down WM age-related WM
decline.
We acknowledge that there may be other factors not addressed
in the current study, such as genetic polymorphisms or diet
that influence the magnitude of WM decline in aging. For
example, greater amyloid burden was found to explain faster FA
decline in parahippocampal cingulum, body corpus callosum,
and forceps minor in healthy older adults (Rieckmann et al.,
2016), and those carrying the APOE-ε4 risk allele may also
preferentially benefit from PA (Etnier et al., 2007; Smith et al.,
2013). Future randomized clinical trials on larger samples are
needed to understand individual differences in WM deterioration
in healthy aging.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we provided first evidence for a dance intervention
resulting in increased FA. We attribute this to the fact that dance
is a combined cognitive, physical and social training, known to
boost intervention outcomes. We found no relation of fornix
FA to memory, but a rather unexpected relation to processing
speed, suggesting a role of the fornix beyond the memory systems
in healthy individuals. Importantly, knowing fornix FA can be
increased with dance training may lead to new avenues for
early treatments, for example, in genetically inherited dementias,
characterized by reduced fornix FA at preclinical, asymptomatic
stages (Ringman et al., 2007). We also provided first evidence for
robust decline in WM integrity in healthy older adults over only
6-months. Patterns of change in different diffusivity parameters
may reflect region-specific histological mechanisms of decline.
Our findings support previous reports of accelerated decline with
advancing age and for greater susceptibility of anterior than
posterior corpus callosum fibers. However, we found no evidence
for gender differences or anterior-to-posterior or superior-to-
inferior gradient of decline in the whole WM. Importantly, less
time spend sitting and more time spent engaging in MVPA was
associated with less negative change in FA, providing the first
evidence of objectively measured lifestyle activities on change in
WM health.
