Engineering T cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) is an effective method for
directing T cells to attack tumors, but may cause adverse side effects such as the potentially
lethal cytokine release syndrome. Here the authors show that the T cell antigen coupler
(TAC), a chimeric receptor that co-opts the endogenous TCR, induces more efficient anti-
tumor responses and reduced toxicity when compared with past-generation CARs. TAC-
engineered T cells induce robust and antigen-specific cytokine production and cytotoxicity
in vitro, and strong anti-tumor activity in a variety of xenograft models including solid and
liquid tumors. In a solid tumor model, TAC-T cells outperform CD28-based CAR-T cells with
increased anti-tumor efficacy, reduced toxicity, and faster tumor infiltration. Intratumoral
TAC-T cells are enriched for Ki-67+ CD8+ T cells, demonstrating local expansion. These
results indicate that TAC-T cells may have a superior therapeutic index relative to CAR-T
cells.

 A
doptive T cell transfer (ACT) involves the ex vivo
expansion of a patient’s T cells followed by infusion of the
cell product into the patient. ACT with T cells engineered
to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has proven to be a
highly effective strategy for the treatment of CD19-positive and
BCMA-positive malignancies1–3. First-generation CARs aimed to
mimic T cell activation by linking the intracellular signaling
domain of CD3ζ to a single chain antibody (scFv)4. Next gen-
eration CARs have included one or more costimulatory mole-
cules, such as CD28 or 4-1BB, upstream of CD3ζ4,5. These
signaling components appear to successfully recapitulate signals 1
and 2 of T cell activation, although it is unclear whether these
signals are subject to the same regulation as the native T cell
receptor (TCR) and costimulatory receptors6.
Synonymous with the clinical success of CAR-T cells in
hematological malignancies1,7–9 have been serious, and poten-
tially lethal, toxicities including cytokine release syndrome,
macrophage activation syndrome, hemophagocytic lymphohis-
tiocytosis, and neurotoxicity10–12. Toxicities related to CAR-T
cells are complex, multi-factorial, and manifest in a variety of
ways13–15. Management of these toxicities has been a major
concern for clinical implementation12. In contrast, ACT with T
cell products (e.g., tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) or TCR-
engineered T cells) that rely on TCR signaling have reported low
rates of adverse events relative to CAR-T cells16. Thus, the serious
toxicities observed in the CD19 CAR-T cell clinical trials may be a
specific feature of second-generation CAR-T cells, rather than T
cell therapies in general.
We hypothesized that CAR toxicity is linked to the synthetic
nature of the receptor design. As a strategy to redirect T cells in a
TCR-dependent, MHC-independent manner, we created an
alternative receptor, the T cell antigen coupler (TAC), which has
three components: (1) an antigen-binding domain, (2) a TCR-
recruitment domain, and (3) a co-receptor domain (hinge,
transmembrane, and cytosolic regions). Since TAC receptors
operate through the native TCR, we hypothesized they would
induce a more controlled T cell response.
Here, we describe the modular design and functional char-
acterization of TAC receptors. We present experimental evidence
for the compatibility of the TAC platform with different classes of
functional domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy
and unique biology of TAC-engineered human T cells in pre-
clinical models of solid and hematological tumors. Notably, using
a solid tumor model, we observe that TAC-engineered T cells
display both enhanced in vivo anti-tumor efficacy and decreased
off-tumor toxicity compared to first- and second-generation
CARs.
Results
Selection of the TCR recruitment domain. The TAC receptor
was designed to trigger aggregation of the native TCR following
binding of tumor antigens by co-opting the native TCR via the
CD3 binding domain (Fig. 1). To evaluate the influence of CD3
binding on TAC receptor function, multiple anti-CD3 single-
chain antibodies (scFvs) were evaluated, including UCHT117,
huUCHT118,19, OKT320, L2K21, and F6A22. These scFvs, which
differ in their recognition of the ε chain17,22–24, were assessed in
the context of a TAC containing the CD4 co-receptor domain
and various tumor-targeting moieties (Fig. 2a, e).
OKT3 and UCHT1 were evaluated in a HER2-specific TAC
using a designed ankyrin repeat protein (H10-2-G3 DARPin25) as
an antigen-binding domain. TACs employing OKT3 and UCHT1
displayed comparable levels of surface expression (Fig. 2b).
Despite high surface expression, stimulation via the OKT3-TAC
elicited low level cytokine production and poor cytotoxicity
(Fig. 2c, d). In contrast, antigen stimulation via the UCHT1-TAC
triggered robust cytokine production and cytotoxicity (Fig. 2c, d).
Using a TAC directed against CD19 via the FMC63 scFv26, we
also evaluated a humanized version of UCHT1 (huUCHT1)18,19
and two other scFvs, L2K21 and F6A22 (Fig. 2e). The huUCHT1-
TAC displayed the highest surface expression (Fig. 2f). The F6A-
TAC was not detected on the T cell surface (Fig. 2f), despite
successful detection on the surface of 293T cells (Supplementary
Fig. 1A). Following stimulation with CD19-positive targets, we
observed that significantly higher frequencies of CD4+ T cells
engineered with huUCHT1-TAC produced cytokines (IFN-γ,
TNF-α, IL-2), compared to CD4+ T cells engineered with F6A-
or
L2K-TACs
(Fig.
2g).
CD8+
T
cells
engineered
with
huUCHT1- and F6A-TAC produced comparable amounts of
cytokine whereas stimulation via L2K-TACs elicited low levels of
cytokine production (Fig. 2g). T cells engineered with the
huUCHT1-TAC displayed markedly increased cytotoxicity rela-
tive to T cells engineered with either the F6A- and L2K-TAC
(Fig. 2h). The ability of F6A-TAC to trigger cytokine production
and cytotoxicity in an antigen-specific manner suggests that it
was expressed on the T cell surface (Supplementary Fig. 1B) but
was below the limit of detection. Compared to L2K, OKT3, and
F6A, UCHT1 demonstrated preferred properties in the TAC
platform and was employed in all subsequent TAC designs.
The CD3-binding domain was absolutely required for TAC
activation (Supplementary Fig. 2A–D). Importantly, in the
absence of antigen, we did not observe auto-activation of TAC-
T cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A–C). To determine whether the
CD8 co-receptor could be swapped in to replace the CD4
transmembrane and cytosolic domain, a TAC variant was
generated using the CD8α co-receptor. To limit dimerization
potential, we mutated two CD8α cysteine residues (C164S/C181S)
creating the CD8-TAC. Direct comparisons of TAC receptors
employing UCHT1 and either the CD4 or CD8 co-receptor
revealed no functional differences (Supplementary Fig. 4A–D).
TAC-T cells display no signs of auto-activation. Auto-activation
has been noted in the CAR literature causing expression of
checkpoint receptors in the absence of antigenic stimulation27,28.
T cells were engineered with a TAC receptor or a second-
generation CAR containing either a CD28 (28ζ) or a 4-1BB (BBζ)
costimulatory domain. All constructs utilized the same anti-
HER2 DARPin targeting element. Consistent with previous
reports27, both CD28 and 4-1BB-based CAR-T cells showed
significant elevation of checkpoint receptor expression relative to
TAC-T cells (Fig. 3a). We observed upregulation of PD-1, LAG-3
and TIM-3 on CD28ζ CAR-T cells. T cells engineered with the
BBζ CAR revealed significant elevation of LAG-3 but reduced
expression of PD-1 and TIM-3 compared to the CD28-based
CAR. In all cases, we observed donor-dependent effects where
certain donors were more susceptible to checkpoint receptor
upregulation (Supplementary Fig. 5A). We did not observe sig-
nificant elevation of checkpoint receptors on HER2-TAC-T cells
(Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 5A). Since tonic signaling would also
be expected to affect T cell differentiation, we performed a phe-
notypic analysis using the following markers: CD45RA, CCR7,
CD28, and CD27. HER2TAC-T cells maintained a phenotypic
profile most akin to control T cells (tNGFR), retaining similar
proportions of naïve (CD45RA+, CCR7+), central memory
(CD45RA−, CCR7+), effector memory (CD45RA−, CCR7−), and
terminal effector T cells (CD45RA+, CCR7−) following the cul-
ture period (Fig. 3b). CD27 and CD28 costimulatory receptors
were markedly downregulated on both 4-1BB- and CD28-based
CAR-T cells, providing additional evidence of tonic signaling by
these CARs (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, CD27 downregulation was

 more pronounced on T cells engineered with the BBζ CAR than
the 28ζ CAR while CD28 downregulation was more pronounced
on T cells engineered with the 28ζ CAR, indicating a divergence
in the tonic signals delivered by each intracellular domain.
Consistent with our functional data (Supplementary Fig. 3),
phenotypic profiling of checkpoint receptors and memory mar-
kers revealed no evidence of auto-activation by TAC-T cells.
TAC-T cells show efficacy in solid and liquid tumor models.
We first evaluated the efficacy of TAC-T cells against OVCAR-3,
a solid tumor xenograft that expresses HER229 (Fig. 4a). Tumor-
bearing mice treated with HER2-TAC-T cells experienced rapid
tumor regressions within 4–5 days following ACT, compared to
mice treated with either CD19-TAC-T cells or T cells engineered
with vector only (Fig. 4b). In all cases (n = 11), long-term tumor
control was observed, with mice surviving to the experimental
endpoint (~60 days post-ACT).
TAC-T cells were tested against NALM-6 tumors, an acute
lymphoblastic leukemia xenograft that expresses CD1930 (Fig. 4c).
Mice were treated with CD19-TAC-T cells or T cells engineered
with a TAC lacking an antigen-binding domain (Fig. 4d). NALM-
6 tumors grew rapidly in the mice treated with the TAC that
lacked a binding domain causing significant morbidity within
3 weeks following treatment. Treatment with CD19-TAC-T cells
caused rapid regression of NALM-6 tumors and the tumors were
kept at a minimal level throughout the 60-day evaluation period
in a majority of the mice treated (Fig. 4d).
TAC-T cells show enhanced activity in a solid tumor model.

Fig. 1 TAC design mimics the TCR-CD3:co-receptor complex. a Left: Naturally occurring TCR-CD3 complex interacts directly with the antigen presented by
MHC. Meanwhile, the CD8/CD4 co-receptor interacts with MHC I/II in an antigen-independent manner. Together, these interactions comprise the first
step in T cell activation. Right: The TAC receptor re-directs the TCR-CD3 complex towards an antigen of choice using an interchangeable antigen binding
moiety (here depicted with an scFv, purple). An scFv is used to recruit the TCR-CD3 complex (blue). Co-receptor properties are incorporated by including
the CD4 hinge, TM region, and cytosolic tail (green). b The TAC is incorporated into the pCCL DNA backbone containing a truncated NGFR (tNGFR),
which lacks cytosolic signaling domains, as a transduction control. The vector features a bi-directional promoter system with tNGFR under control of the
mCMV promoter and TAC expression being driven by the EF-1α promoter. TAC is comprised of an antigen binding domain, a CD3-binding domain, and a
co-receptor domain. A variety of proteins can be used for each of these three TAC domains allowing the TAC to be modified to best respond to numerous
different antigens. The specific domain combinations tested are described below

with the same DARPin. All engineered T cells displayed com-
parable in vitro cytotoxicity and cytokine production (Supple-

CAR-T cells showed no anti-tumor activity and tumor progres-
sion was not significantly different from control treated mice
(Fig. 5b). Second-generation HER2-CAR-T cells displayed only
moderate, delayed anti-tumor efficacy which manifested around

Fig. 2 Evaluation of multiple anti-CD3 scFv domains for recruitment of TAC to the TCR-CD3 complex. a, e Schematic representation of evaluated TAC
constructs. TAC receptors utilizing the (a) anti-HER2 DARPin are paired with either the UCHT1 or OKT3 anti-CD3 scFv. TAC receptors using the (e) anti-
CD19 scFv are paired with either the huUCHT1, F6A, or L2K anti-CD3 scFv. b, f Relative TAC surface expression is measured by flow cytometry. Cells are
stained for CD4, CD8, tNGFR and TAC, and gated on either CD4+NGFR+ or CD8+NGFR+. Representative data of three independent experiments are
presented as histogram analysis of (b) HER2-TAC or (f) CD19-TAC. Surface expression of OKT3 relative to UCHT1 was significantly higher in CD4 cells
(p = 0.0007) but not in CD8 cells. huUCHT1 expression is significantly higher compared to either L2K (p = 0.005 (CD4)/0.0002 (CD8)) or F6A
(p < 0.0001 (CD4) p < 0.0001 (CD8)). For the gating strategy see Supplementary Fig. 13A. c, g HER2- and CD19-specific TAC-T cells are stimulated with

TAC, or a second-generation anti-HER2 CAR including the CD28 (28ζ CAR) or 4-1BB (BBζ CAR) costimulatory receptor domains, or a vector control
(tNGFR). Engineered T cells are stained for surface marker expression and CD4+NGFR+ or CD8+NGFR+ populations are analyzed by flow cytometry for

 treated with second-generation CAR was significantly different
from the change in weight of mice treated with TAC-T cells, first-
generation CAR-T cells, and control mice. The body weights of
mice treated with vector control, first-generation CAR, or TAC
were not significantly different (multiple t-test shows no sig-
nificance; First-generation/TAC p = 0.5; First-generation/ control
p = 0.9; TAC/Control p = 0.5).
In addition to efficacy, we compared the toxicities associated
with TAC- versus CAR-engineered T cells. HER2-CAR-T cells
elicited a profound toxicity that manifested as a ruffled coat,
labored breathing and decreased body condition. We employed
weight loss (Fig. 5a–d) and core body temperature (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7A–D) as a quantitative measure of toxicity. Mice treated
with first-generation HER2-CAR-T cells did not exhibit signs of
toxicity, consistent with the lack of anti-tumor efficacy (Fig. 5b).
In contrast, we noted toxicities emerging following treatment
with second-generation HER2-CAR-T cells were quite severe and
all mice became moribund within 44 days of ACT (Fig. 5c, X
marks the endpoint) (Supplementary Fig. 7E). Conversely, HER2-
TAC-T cells clearly distinguish themselves from HER2-CAR-T

jected to pathologic and serum cytokine analysis at 1, 3, 5,

Fig. 5 HER2-TAC-T cells demonstrate an enhanced safety profile and improved efficacy over first- and second-generation HER2-CAR-T cells in vivo.
OVCAR-3 tumor-bearing mice are treated with 2.0 × 106 HER2-TAC-T cells (a), first-generation anti-HER2 CAR-T cells (b), second-generation anti-HER2
28ζ CAR-T cells (c), or a matched total number of vector control T cells (d). Mice are followed for change in body weight and tumor volume; each curve
represents a single treated mouse relative to pre-treatment weight/volume. When mice reach endpoint, this is indicated via X in (c). Data has been
replicated in an independent experiment. Using curve fitting analysis and multiple t-test HER2-TAC induced regression is significantly different from
control, 1st, and 2nd generation CAR curves, while tumor growth between vector control and 1st gen CAR was not significantly different. The change in
body weight observed in 2nd gen CAR curves is significantly different from vector control, 1st gen CAR, and TAC-T cell treated mice. However, the
difference in body weight between vector control, 1st gen CAR, and TAC curves was not significantly different

 pulmonary and cardiac infiltrates (Supplementary Figs. 8A, B
and 10). Instead, HER2-TAC-T cells accumulated primarily
within tumor tissue, whereas little accumulation of HER2-CAR-T
cells or control T cells was observed within the experimental time
frame (Supplementary Fig. 8D, E), consistent with the delayed
tumor control exhibited by the HER2-CAR-T cells.
To further define the nature of the T cell infiltrate within
tissues, we employed multiparametric IHC. Lung sections from
mice treated with HER2-CAR-T cells revealed a dominant
infiltration
of
Ki-67 + CD4+
T
cells,
suggesting
localized
expansion (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Fig. 8F). In contrast, the few
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells observed in the lungs of mice treated
with HER2-TAC-T cells or vector control T cells were quiescent
based on their small size (Supplementary Fig. 8B) and relative
lack of Ki-67 staining (Fig. 6a). Similar observations were made in
cardiac tissue (Supplementary Figs. 8C, 10). In tumors, the
HER2-TAC-T cell population was dominated by CD8+ T cells,
although CD4+ T cells were also evident. Further, intra-tumoral
HER2-TAC-T cells were Ki-67+, indicating localized prolifera-
tion (Fig. 6a). Tumor tissue infiltrated by HER2-TAC-T cells also
contained necrotic tumor cells indicative of cytotoxicity (Supple-
mentary Fig. 8E). Findings regarding tissue-specific CD3+ T cell
infiltration were quantified by blinded scoring of IHC slides
(Supplementary Fig. 8F).
Examination of circulating human cytokines in the serum of
treated mice demonstrated a striking discordance in the quantity

 and chronology of inflammatory cytokine production between
HER2-TAC- and HER2-CAR-T cells. HER2-CAR-T cell-treated
mice exhibited the highest levels of circulating cytokines when
compared to receptor-negative or TAC-T cell-treated mice
(Fig. 6b). Moreover, while serum cytokine levels in HER2-TAC-
T cell-treated mice remained low throughout treatment, serum
cytokine
levels
in

became
progressively higher over the course of treatment (Fig. 6b).
In other experiments, we determined that the HER2-CAR-T
cells also cause toxicity in tumor-free animals, indicating the
toxicity is due, at least in part, to antigen expression in healthy
tissues. No cross reactivity with murine HER2 was observed
(Supplementary Fig. 11). Thus, cells were responding against an
unknown antigen in the lungs and heart driving a lethal systemic
inflammatory reaction. In contrast, HER2-TAC-T cells, which
carry the same antigen-recognition domain, showed improved
penetration and expansion within the tumor and did not show
evidence of activation or pathology within the lung and heart.
Discussion
Novel strategies, such as splitting of activation and costimulation
signals32, and Boolean-gated receptors33, seek to improve the
toxicity profile of CAR-T cells. Rather than modifying the CAR
design, we opted to design a major histocompatibility complex
(MHC)-independent receptor that recapitulates the architecture
of a TCR-CD3/co-receptor complex to engage natural cellular
pathways and achieve a more nuanced T cell response.
Our data show that engagement of the TCR-CD3 complex is
crucial for the function of TAC-engineered T cells. The activity of
the TAC receptor was critically dependent upon the choice of
CD3-binding domain, with UCHT1 demonstrating the strongest
combination of phenotypic and functional characteristics in vitro.
Curiously, the scFv derived from OKT3, one of the most com-
monly used agonistic anti-CD3 antibodies, performed poorly in
the TAC platform. Despite the overlapping epitopes of OKT3 and
UCHT117, our findings, and those of previous studies23, indicate
that small differences in binding to the CD3 complex can result in
substantially different functional outcomes.
Regardless of whether the anti-CD3 scFv binds a complex
structural epitope (UCHT134–36, OKT323,34,37, and L2K21) or a
simple amino acid sequence (F6A binds to a linear N-terminal
CD3ε epitope, AA 22–26 “QDGNE”22), all CD3-recruiting scFvs
displayed some level of functionality within the TAC framework.
The varying functionalities of the TAC receptors carrying dif-
ferent CD3-binding moieties suggest that these variabilities could
be used to fine-tune T cell responses by altering the various
modules of the TAC to create an appropriate indication-specific
receptor.
Since the use of murine-derived scFvs in chimeric receptors has
been associated with the generation of human anti-mouse anti-
bodies that eliminate engineered T cells38,39, we have validated
the use of humanized UCHT1 in the TAC receptor and all future
iterations of the TAC will employ the human scaffold. Our proof-
of-concept studies have focused on TAC receptors directed at
either CD19 or HER2, but in principle, any cell surface target
should be amenable to TAC recognition.
Our in vitro comparison of TAC- and first- and second-
generation CAR-T cells revealed no functional differences in
cytotoxicity or cytokine production. We noted that both CD28-
and 4-1BB-based second-generation CARs, but not TAC recep-
tors, delivered tonic signals to T cells, which manifested in ele-
vated expression of checkpoint receptors and reduced frequencies
of T cells with a naive phenotype in the manufactured product.
Given recent reports that indicate tonic signaling can impair
CAR-T cell function27,28, the lack of tonic signaling may be an
advantage to TAC receptors. Tonic signaling in CARs can be
exacerbated by the choice of scFv27,40. We have employed mul-
tiple scFvs with the TAC platform and failed to observe evidence
of tonic signaling (Supplementary Fig. 12). We believe that the
lack of tonic signaling may be due to the lack of immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the TAC receptor. It
has been suggested that less differentiated T cells are preferable to
terminally-differentiated effector cells for adoptive therapy, as
they retain greater proliferative ability and improved in vivo
persistence41. Data reveal that T cells engineered with TAC
receptors retain a less differentiated phenotype, which may
translate to a more potent T cell product.
Based on the 2-signal hypothesis of T cell activation42, one
could expect TAC-T cells to perform similarly to a first-
generation CAR. However, TAC-T cells showed superior out-
comes in vivo compared to both first- and second-generation
CARs. Pathological analysis revealed two important features of
TAC-T cells: (1) greater infiltration of solid tumors post-adoptive
transfer and (2) reduced expansion in healthy tissues that express
antigens that trigger the HER2-CAR. Intratumorally, both CD4+
and CD8+ TAC-T cells expanded, demonstrating a balanced
anti-tumor attack. Importantly, TAC-T cells did not show evi-
dence of activation or expansion within the lungs, heart or any
other tissue and did not cause any other toxicities.
Looking at CAR-T cell mediated toxicities, the incidence and
severity of clinical adverse events vary widely across CAR-T cell
trials. In some trials, 100% of treated patients experienced toxi-
cities, including fever, nausea, general malaise, and in rare cases
lethality43,44. The solid tumor model we employed enables
simultaneous monitoring of CAR-T cell-mediated efficacy and
toxicity. Therefore, it is intriguing that, in addition to superior
solid tumor control, TAC-T cells also displayed less toxicity than
CAR-T cells. In contrast, HER2-CAR-T cells infiltrated normal
lung and heart tissues, resulting in robust expansion of CD4 +
CAR-T cells. Examination of serum cytokines following infusion
of the second-generation CAR-T cells revealed exuberant pro-
duction of a range of cytokines, indicating the expansion was not
reflective of a specific CD4+ T cell subset45. In contrast, circu-
lating cytokines following infusion of TAC-T cells were markedly
lower and biased towards a Th1 cytokine profile, suggesting a
more controlled response.
It is curious that TAC-, but not CAR-, T cells infiltrated the
tumor tissue at early time points post-ACT and, conversely, that
CAR-, but not TAC-, T cells expanded greatly within the lungs
and heart. The lungs, as the first-pass organ, could be expected to
be more susceptible to off-tumor reactivity of engineered T cells;
however, CAR-T cell expansion within the heart argues that the
infiltration/pathology is not simply a first-pass effect. We
observed some CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the lung following
infusion of TAC-T cells. However, their small size and lack of Ki-
67 expression indicated that they were quiescent. It remains to be
determined why TAC-T cells did not react to these healthy tissues
as exuberantly as the CAR-T cells. Regardless, these results
demonstrate that while TACs can engage and eliminate antigen-
bearing tumor cells, they are also sufficiently selective to bypass
healthy cells bearing low levels of antigen. This ability to differ-
entiate between antigen in healthy and cancerous tissues could, if
generalizable, allow TAC-T cells to be used with solid tumor
antigens that are expressed at low levels on healthy cells.
Our observations with HER2-TAC-T cells demonstrate that
the efficacy of engineered T cells can be uncoupled from toxicity.
Importantly, we predict that this profile will significantly reduce
risk and improve tolerability in patients—including those with
significant comorbidities. Furthermore, the improved safety
profile would make TAC therapy accessible to a much larger pool
of patients, as it would no longer be limited to academic centers

 capable of handling the complex toxicities currently encountered
with CAR therapies. For these reasons, the use of TAC in clinical
applications is highly anticipated.
Materials and methods
CAR and TAC vector generation. TAC receptor transgenes were designed by
linking tumor-directing moiety to a CD3-TCR complex-targeting single chain
variable fragment (scFv), and the hinge, transmembrane (TM), and cytoplasmic
domains of a T cell co-receptor.
The TAC sequence using UCHT1, CD4 hinge, transmembrane, and
cytoplasmic domains was synthesized from GeneArt (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) in the pUC57 vector. The HER2-specific H10-2-G3
DARPin31 targeting domain (using an Igκ leader sequence) was PCR amplified
(Primers FWD-1 and REV-1 Supplementary Table 2) and cloned into the pUC57
TAC vector using AscI and XmaI cut sites. The resulting TAC was then cloned into
the pCCL vector, containing bi-directional minimal CMV (mCMV) and EF-1α
promoters46 (kindly provided by Megan Levings, University of British Columbia,
Vancouver, BC), using AscI and NheI cut sites.
To generate the OKT3 TAC the VL-VH configuration of the OKT3 Q/S
variant20 was ordered from GeneArt and cloned into pUC57 using BamHI and
SpeI. The resulting TAC construct was then sub-cloned into pCCL as above.
TAC -ΔAntigen binding site was cloned from the HER2 DARPin TAC
construct where the HER2 binding domain was removed via overlapping PCR
using primers FWD-5/6 and REV-5/6 (Supplementary Table 2).
Generation of the second-generation anti-HER2 28ζ CAR consisting of the Igκ
leader, anti-HER2 H10-2-G3 DARPin, human myc tag, CD8α hinge, CD28 TM
and cytoplasmic domains, and CD3ζ cytoplasmic tail was previously described1.
The second-generation anti-HER2 BBζ CAR (consisting of the Igκ leader, anti-
HER2 H10-2-G3 DARPin, human myc tag, BamHI site, CD8α hinge and TM,
4-1BB cytoplasmic domain, CD3ζ cytoplasmic tail, and NheI site) was generated by
cloning the CD8α hinge and TM, 4-1BB cytoplasmic domain, and CD3ζ
cytoplasmic tail portions from an anti-CD19 CAR (prepared according to47)
between the BamHI and NheI sites of the anti-HER2 28ζ CAR. (Primers FWD-4
and REV-4 Supplementary Table 2). The first-generation anti-HER2 CAR was
constructed by removing the 4-1BB portion of the anti-HER2 BBζ CAR. This was
completed by deletion PCR (Primers FWD-2 and 3 and REV-2 and 3;
Supplementary Table 2).
For anti-BCMA CAR and TAC receptors, the anti-BCMA scFv (C11D5.3)
sequence was obtained from patent US20150051266A13 and synthesized by
Genscript. The scFv was sub-cloned into existing pCCL TAC and CD28ζ-CAR
lentiviral backbones using AscI and BamHI cut sites, replacing the existing scFv
with C11D5.3.
The TAC encoding the humanized version of UCHT1 (huUCHT1)18,19 was
ordered from GeneArt and sub-cloned by the manufacturer into the pCCL TAC
backbone we provided. The sequence for the scFv derived from FMC63, a CD19-
specific monoclonal antibody26 was synthesized with a N-terminal CD8α leader
sequence and a Whitlow linker sequence between the heavy and light variable
fragments48 (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, AI). The FMC63 scFv
was amplified via the TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen), then sub-cloned into the
huUCHT1 TAC pCCL backbone using AscI and BamHI. TAC constructs using the
F6A22 or L2K21 CD3-binding domain in place of the huUCHT1 were ordered from
GeneArt.
The CD8α TAC was cloned as follows: the CD8α sequence was obtained from
the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (entry: P01732) and ordered from GeneArt
containing C164S and C181S mutations within the hinge domain. The sequence
was cloned into the pUC57 UCHT1 TAC vector using XhoI and NheI. The
resulting CD8α-TAC was then sub-cloned into the pCCL vector using AscI and
NheI.
All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs (NEB,
Whitby, ON). All sequences were codon-optimized for expression in human cells
and verified. All TAC and CAR constructs are under the control of the human EF-
1α promoter through 5′ AscI and 3′ NheI cut sites. Truncated LNGFR (tNGFR)
under control of a minimal human cytomegalovirus (mCMV) promoter was
utilized as a transduction marker. The receptor-negative control vector codes only
for the tNGFR transgene under the mCMV promoter.
Lentivirus production. Self-inactivating, non-replicative lentivirus produced using
a third-generation system has been previously discussed46,49. Briefly, 8 × 106
HEK293T cells cultured on 15 cm diameter tissue culture-treated dishes (NUNC;
Thermo Fisher Scientific) were transfected with the packaging plasmids pRSV-Rev
(6.25 μg), pMD2.G (9 μg), pMDLg-pRRE (12.5 μg) and the transfer plasmid pCCL
containing the transgene (32 μg) using Opti-MEM (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Twelve to sixteen hours
after transfection, media was replenished with new medium supplemented with
sodium butyrate (1 mM; Sigma-Aldrich Canada Co., Oakville, ON). Media con-
taining lentivirus particles was collected after 36–48 h and concentrated by ultra-
centrifugation. Viral titer in TU/mL was determined by serial dilution and
transduction of HEK293T cells, and subsequently determining %tNGFR+ via flow
cytometry using an anti-NGFR-VioBrightFITC antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch
Gladbach, Germany). CD19-TAC was manufactured by Lentigen (Lentigen Corp,
Gaithersburg, USA). The virus was shipped in frozen form, thawed, re-frozen and
titered.
Transduction of human T cells. This research was approved by the McMaster
Health Sciences Research Ethics Board and all donors in this study provided
informed written consent. Receptor-engineered human T cells were generated as
previously described49. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
healthy donors (McMaster Adult Cohort (MAC) donor) or commercial leuka-
pheresis products (LEUK donor) (HemaCare, Van Nuys, CA) were isolated by
Ficoll-Paque-Plus gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare, Baie d’Urfe, QC) and
cryopreserved in inactivated human AB serum (Corning, Corning, NY) containing
10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Co.).
Bulk T cells were activated from PBMCs with anti-CD3/28 Dynabeads at a 0.8:1
bead-to-cell ratio (Gibco) following manufacturer’s guidelines, and were cultured
in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 8.7% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(Gibco), 1.75 mM L-glutamine, 8.7 mM HEPES, 0.87 mM sodium pyruvate
(Sigma-Aldrich Canada Co.), 0.87 × non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 48 μM
β-mercaptoethanol, 87 U/mL penicillin + 87 μg/mL streptomycin, 660 I.U. rhIL-2
and 10 ng/mL rhIL-7 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). After 18–24 h, cells were
transduced with lentivirus at an MOI between 1–5 (CAR or tNGFR) or 10 (TAC).
Cells were monitored daily and fed according to cell counts every 2–3 days for a
period of 11–14 days prior to use in vitro and/or in vivo.
Phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry. Engineered T cell surface expression of
CD4, CD8, and where applicable tNGFR was evaluated through direct staining
with conjugated antibodies. All stains were carried at room temperature for 30 min.
HER2-specific CAR- or TAC-T cells were first stained with rhHER2-Fc chimera
protein (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), followed by conjugated antibodies
against CD4, CD8, NGFR (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA; eBioscience, Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA).
CD19-specific TAC-T cells were first stained with biotinylated Protein L (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), followed by streptavidin-APC (BD Biosciences), and finally
conjugated antibodies against CD4, CD8, and NGFR (BD Biosciences). All flow
cytometry was conducted on a BD LSRFortessa or BD LSRII cytometer (BD
Bioscience) and analyzed using FlowJo vX software (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR).
Expression of murine or human HER2 on tumor cell lines was determined by
either direct staining with allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-mHER2 (clone:
666521, Cat No. FAB6744A, R&D Systems) or a two-step stain by indirect
immunofluorescence (conducted at 4 °C); incubation with Herceptin (anti-hHER2;
kind gift from Ronan Foley, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON) was followed by
PE-goat-anti-human IgG (as above). Flow cytometry gating strategies are included
in Supplementary Figs. 13–16.
Functional analysis of CAR-T cells. A total of 5 × 105 or 4 × 105 engineered
T cells were stimulated with 5 × 104 antigen-positive or -negative tumor cells for 4
h at 37 °C in a round- or flat-bottom 96-well plate. Raji (CD19+) and K562
(CD19−) tumor cell lines were used to stimulate CD19-specific TAC-T cells,
whereas SK-OV-3 (HER2+) and LOX-IMVI (HER2−) cell lines were used for
HER2-specific TAC- and CAR-T cells.
BD GolgiPlug protein transport inhibitor (BD Biosciences) was added at the
start of stimulation per manufacturer’s instruction. After stimulation, cells were
stained for surface markers as above. BD Cytofix/Cytoperm fixation and
permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences) was used to permit intracellular cytokine
staining and cells were stained directly for TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-2 expression. Flow
cytometry was conducted as above and data was analyzed using FlowJo (FlowJo,
LLC). Data for percent of T cells cytokine-positive was calculated as: cytokine
TAC/CAR [%] – vector control T cell [%].
In vitro cytotoxicity luminescence assay. To evaluate cytotoxicity, 5 × 104 luci-
ferase engineered cells (NALM-6, SK-OV-3, LOX-IMVI, OVCAR-3) were co-
cultured with T cells in a white flat bottom 96-well plate (Corning) at indicated
effector:target for 6 or 24 h at 37 °C. After co-culture, 0.15 mg/mL D-Luciferin
(Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) was added per well and luminescence was measured
using a i3 SpectraMax (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) across all wavelengths.
Tumor cell viability was calculated as: ((Emission − Background)/(Tumor cell
alone − Background)) × 100%. Each condition was tested in duplicate or triplicate.
In vitro cytotoxicity colorimetric assay. Adherent tumor cell lines LOX-IMVI
and OVCAR-3 were used to evaluate cytotoxicity of HER2-CAR- and TAC-T cells.
Tumor cells were plated at 1.25 × 104 (LOX-IMVI) or 2.5 × 104 (OVCAR-3) cells/
well overnight in a flat-bottom 96-well plate. T cells were evaluated at effector:
target ratios of 0.25:1 to 8:1 and co-cultured for 6 h at 37 °C. After co-culture,
T cells were washed off and tumor cell viability was determined using a 10%
solution of AlamarBlue cell viability reagent (Life Technologies) per manufacturer’s
instructions. Color change, indicative of live cells, was measured by fluorescence
(λexcitation 530 nm, λemission 595 nm) on a Safire plate reader (Tecan, Maennendorf,

 Adoptive transfer and in vivo monitoring. The McMaster Animal Research
Ethics Board approved all murine experiments. Five-week-old female NOD.
Cg-Rag1tm1MomIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NRG) mice were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) (Stock #007799), or bred in-house. Mice
(6–12-weeks-old) were implanted with 2.5 × 106 OVCAR-3 cells subcutaneously
(s.c.) into the right hind flank. After 35–42 days of tumor growth, mice were
optimized into treatment groups based on tumor volume50. Engineered T cells
were infused intravenously (i.v.) (deemed adoptive cell transfer (ACT)) through the
tail vein as two doses delivered 48 h apart (T cells were d14 and d16 in culture on
respective treatment days; doses as specified in figure legends represent the total
sum of effective (transduced receptor positive) T cells received/mouse). Tumor
volume was measured by caliper (Mitutoyo Canada Inc., Toronto, ON) every
2–3 days post-ACT and calculated as L × W × H; % change in tumor volume was
calculated as ((current volume (mm3) − pre-ACT volume (mm3))/pre-ACT
volume (mm3)) ×100. A tumor volume endpoint of ≥2000 mm3 was adhered to.
Mice were weighed (OHAUS Corporation, Parsippany, NJ) every 1–3 days post-
ACT; % change in weight was calculated as ((current weight (g)−pre-ACT weight
(g))/pre-ACT weight (g)) × 100. Early termination criteria included moribundity or
two consecutive measurements of ≥ 20% weight loss, despite supportive therapy
(heat, subcutaneous fluids). Or 7–11-week-old male NRG mice were injected with
0.5 × 106 NALM6-effLuc cells intravenously. Two doses of engineered T cells were
administered as above after 3 days of tumor growth. Tumor burden was monitored
through bioluminescent imaging. Briefly, 10 µL/g of a 15 mg/mL D-Luciferin
solution (Perkin Elmer; Waltham, MA) is injected intraperitoneally 14 min prior to
dorsal and ventral imaging using an IVIS Spectrum (Caliper Life Sciences; Wal-
tham, MA). Images were analyzed using Living Image Software v4.2 for MacOSX
(Perkin Elmer) and dorsal and ventral radiance was summed. Termination criteria
included moribundity or hind limb paralysis. In all cases animal treatment strictly
adhered to McMaster Animal Research Ethics Board instructions and
guidelines.
Histology. Tissues were prepared for veterinary necropsy via whole body formalin
perfusion as described previously51. After fixation in 10% neutral buffered for-
malin, tissues were paraffin-embedded, sectioned and stained using hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) for expression of human CD3
(Abcam Inc., Toronto, ON, cat#: ab16669) (conducted using the Leica BOND RX
(Leica Biosystems Inc., Concord, ON)). Aforementioned histology services were
performed by the Core Histology Facility at the McMaster Immunology Research
Centre. Opal multiplex IHC was performed by the Molecular and Cellular
Immunology Core at the British Columbia Cancer Agency’s Deeley Research
Centre. In short, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained
with anti-CD4 (Abcam, cat#: ab133616) detected with Opal 520 (PerkinElmer),
anti-CD8 (Spring Biosciences, cat# M3162) detected with Opal 650 (PerkinElmer),
anti-HER2 (polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technology, cat#: 2242) detected with Opal
570 (PerkinElmer), anti-pan-CK Sigma Aldrich, cat#: C1801 detected with Opal
690 (PerkinElmer), anti-Ki67 (Spring Biosciences, cat#: M3062) detected with Opal
620 (PerkinElmer), and DAPI (PerkinElmer). Multispectral images (20× magnifi-
cation, three fields per tumor and three fields containing perivascular sites per
lung) were collected using the PerkinElmer Vectra system. Quantification was
performed using inform Advanced Image Analysis Software (PerkinElmer). Blin-
ded pathologic assessment of H&E and CD3 IHC slides was performed by a
veterinary pathologist (J.M.K., McMaster University). Blinded CD3 IHC scoring
was performed by a pathology resident (I.B., McMaster University)52.
Serum cytokine analysis. Prior to necropsy, mice were underwent a non-terminal
retro-orbital bleed. Serum was isolated using CapiJect capillary blood collection
serum tubes according to manufacturer instructions (Terumo Medical Corpora-
tion, Somerset, NJ, Cat No. T-MG). Quantification of 13 human cytokines and
chemokines (cat#: HDF13) or 31 murine cytokines and chemokines (cat#: MD31)
was performed in a multiplex assay by Eve Technologies (Eve Technologies Cor-
poration, Calgary, AB) using the Bio-Plex 200 system and MILLIPLEX assay kits
from Millipore. The assay sensitivities of these markers ranged from 0.1–9.5 pg/mL
(human) and 0.1–33.3 pg/mL (murine); individual analyte values can be found
through the Eve Technologies website.
Cell lines. Human tumor cell lines SK-OV-3, LOX-IMVI, and OVCAR-3 origi-
nating from the NCI-60 panel (kind gift from Karen Mossman, McMaster Uni-
versity, Hamilton, ON) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with
8.7% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco) 1.75 mM L-glutamine (BioShop,
Burlington, ON), 8.7 mM HEPES (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC), 87 U/mL
penicillin + 87 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), and 48 nM β-mercaptoethanol
(Gibco). Prior to use OVCAR-3 cells, were passaged in vivo. In brief, OVCAR-3
cells were injected s.c. into the hind flank of an NRG mouse and allowed to grow
for 72 days prior to harvest, digested with a mixture of collagenase type I (Gibco),
DNase I (Roche), and hyaluronidase (MP Biomedicals LLC, Solon, OH), and the
resulting cell product was expanded ex vivo. The Raji, NALM-6, and K562 cell lines
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA),
Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunsch-
weig, Germany), and kindly provided by Carl June (University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, PA), respectively, and were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supple-
mented with 8.7% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1.75 mM L-gluta-
mine, 8.7 mM HEPES, 0.87 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Co.),
0.87 × non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 48 μM β-mercaptoethanol, and 87 U/mL
penicillin + 87 μg/mL streptomycin. NALM6-effLuc, SK-OV-03-effLuc, K562-
effLuc, and LOX-IMVI-effLuc cells were generated by transducing tumor cells by
lentivirus encoding enhanced firefly luciferase53 and a puromycin selection marker.
effLuc+ cells were selected for by supplementing culture medium with 2–8 µg/mL
puromycin (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM
(Gibco) with 8.7% heat-inactivated FBS, 8.7 mM HEPES, 1.75 mM L-glutamine, 87
U/mL penicillin + 87 μg/mL streptomycin or 0.1 mg/mL normocin (InvivoGen,
San Diego, CA). All cell lines were cultured under ambient atmosphere adjusted to
5% CO2 and 37 °C, and confirmed mycoplasma-negative by MycoAlert myco-
plasma detection kit (Lonza Inc, Basel, Switzerland). LOX-IMVI-mHER2 cells were
generated by transduction of parental LOX-IMVI cells with a murine HER2
encoding lentivirus (GeneCopoeia, Cat. No.: LPP-Mm02366-Lv151-050) at an
MOI of 20 and antibiotic selection with G418 (Gibco) at 500 µg/mL, according to
the manufacturer’s directions.
Statistical analysis. Multiple t tests, using the Holm-Sidak method, were used to
compare data between two groups. Results were prepared using Prism 6 Software
(GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). A significance interval of 95% was used; NS = not sig-
nificant. Power calculations were performed using G*Power54. Significance of
survival curves was determined via the Log Rank test in Prism 6 Software
(GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). To determine statistical significance of temperature,
weight or tumor growth curves that appear similar, appropriate model curve fitting
algorithms were used. Tumor growth was fitted to an exponential growth function
(Y = Y0*exp(k*X)), while weight and temperature could be best fitted to a liner
function (Y = YIntercept + Slope*X). Key parameters (exponential growth (k),
linear (Slope)) determined via curve fitting were then tested for statistical sig-
nificance. Curves that could not be fit by functions of the same order are con-
sidered significantly different.
