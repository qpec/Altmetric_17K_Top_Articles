Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections in humans. Here we tested
the utility of urinary cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to comprehensively monitor host and pathogen
dynamics in bacterial and viral urinary tract infections. We isolated cfDNA from 141 urine
samples from a cohort of 82 kidney transplant recipients and performed next-generation
sequencing. We found that urinary cfDNA is highly informative about bacterial and viral
composition of the microbiome, antimicrobial susceptibility, bacterial growth dynamics,
kidney allograft injury, and host response to infection. These different layers of information
are accessible from a single assay and individually agree with corresponding clinical tests
based on quantitative PCR, conventional bacterial culture, and urinalysis. In addition, cfDNA
reveals the frequent occurrence of pathologies that remain undiagnosed with conventional
diagnostic protocols. Our work identifies urinary cfDNA as a highly versatile analyte to
monitor infections of the urinary tract.

1234567890():,;
 U
rinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common
medical problems in the general population1. Among
kidney transplant recipients, UTIs occur at an alarmingly
high rate2. Bacterial UTI affects approximately 20% of kidney
transplant recipients in the first year after transplantation3 and at
least 50% in the first 3 years after transplantation4. In addition,
complications due to viral infection often occur. An estimated
5–8% of kidney transplant recipients suffer nephropathy from BK
polyomavirus
(BKV)
infection
in
the
first
3
years
after
transplantation5,6. Other viruses that commonly cause compli-
cations in kidney transplantation include adenovirus, JC poly-
omavirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and parvovirus7. The current
gold standard for diagnosis of bacterial UTI is in vitro urine
culture8.
Although
improved
culture
methods
are
being
investigated9,10, bacterial culture protocols implemented in clin-
ical practice remain limited to the detection of relatively few
cultivable organisms9. Furthermore, urinalysis is often required in
conjunction with culture to make treatment decisions8. A large
number of small fragments of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are present
in plasma and urine11–14. These molecules are the debris of the
genomes of dead cells and offer opportunities for precision
diagnostics based on ‘omics principles, with applications in
pregnancy, cancer, and solid-organ transplantation13,15–17.
Here we investigate the utility of urinary cfDNA to compre-
hensively monitor host and pathogen interactions that arise in the
setting of viral and bacterial infections of the urinary tract. Using
shotgun DNA sequencing, we assay cfDNA isolated from 141
urine samples collected from a cohort of 82 kidney transplant
recipients, including recipients diagnosed with bacterial UTI and
BKV nephropathy (BKVN). We developed a single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA) library preparation, optimized for the analysis of
short, highly fragmented DNA18–20, and were able to sequence
cfDNA isolated from relatively small volumes of urine super-
natant (1 mL or less). We find that urinary cfDNA sequencing
agrees in the vast majority of cases with conventional diagnostic
testing, while also uncovering frequent occurrence of bacteria and
viruses that remain undetected in conventional diagnostic pro-
tocols. We further investigated cfDNA-based analytic methods
that go beyond microbial identification and provide a deeper
understanding of the infectious process. We show that rate of
bacterial population growth can be estimated from an analysis
of the bacterial genome structure and that this measurement
can inform diagnosis of UTI. We furthermore mined cfDNA
for antimicrobial resistance (AR) genes and show that AR
gene profiling can be used to evaluate AR. Last, we observe
that the relative proportion of kidney donor-specific cfDNA
correlates with graft tissue injury in the setting of viral infection
and host immune cell activation in the setting of bacterial
infection.
Collectively, our study supports the use of shotgun DNA
sequencing of urinary cfDNA as a comprehensive tool for
monitoring
patient
health
and
studying
host–pathogen
interactions.
Results
Biophysical properties of urinary cfDNA. Urinary cfDNA is
composed of human chromosomal, mitochondrial, and microbial
cfDNA released from host cells and microbes in the urinary tract
and of plasma-derived cfDNA that passes from blood into
urine21. Urine can be collected non-invasively in large volumes
and therefore represents an attractive target for diagnostic assays.
Compared to plasma cfDNA, relatively few studies have exam-
ined the properties and diagnostic potential of urinary cfDNA.
The urinary environment degrades nucleic acids more rapidly
than plasma resulting in fewer DNA fragments that are also
shorter22. Consequently, sequence analyses of urinary cfDNA
have to date required relatively large (>10 mL) volumes of
urine14,23. Here we applied a single-stranded library preparation
technique that employs ssDNA adapters and bead ligation to
create diverse sequencing libraries that capture short, highly
degraded cfDNA19,20 (Fig. 1a). We find that single-stranded
library preparation enables sequence analyses of urinary cfDNA
from just 1 mL of urine supernatant. We tested 141 urine samples
collected from 82 kidney transplant recipients, including subjects
diagnosed with bacterial UTI and BKVN (overview of post-
transplant dates and categories depicted in Fig. 1b, see Methods).
We obtained 43.5 +/− 17.3 million paired-end reads per sample,
yielding a per-base human genome coverage of 0.49× +/− 0.24×.
Many fragments were derived from microbiota; for example, for
subjects diagnosed with bacterial UTI, bacterial cfDNA accounted
for up to 34.7% of the raw sequencing reads, and in cases of
BKVN, BKV cfDNA accounted for up to 10.3% of raw sequen-
cing reads. To account for technical variability and sources of
environmental contamination during extraction and library pre-
paration, a known-template control sample was included in every
sample batch and sequenced (see Methods).
We analyzed the fragment length profiles of urinary cfDNA at
single-nucleotide resolution using paired-end read mapping11.
This analysis confirmed previous observations of the highly
fragmented nature of urinary cfDNA compared to plasma
cfDNA23 (Fig. 1c). We observed a 10.4 bp periodicity in the
fragment length profile of chromosomal cfDNA (Fourier analysis,
Fig. 1c, inset), consistent with the periodicity of DNA–histone
contacts in nucleosomes24. BKV is known to hijack histones of
infected
host
cells
and
to
form
mini-chromosomes
after
infection25. The periodicity in the fragment length profiles of
BKV cfDNA in urine reflect this biology (Fig. 1c). We did not
observe a similar nucleosomal footprint for bacterial and
mitochondrial cfDNA or cfDNA arising from parvovirus B19,
which is expected given the non-nucleosomal compaction of the
genomes that contribute these cfDNA types (Fig. 1d).
Infectome screening. We assessed the presence of cfDNA from
bacterial and viral pathogens reported by conventional diagnostic
assays. We used bioinformatics approaches26 to estimate the
relative genomic representation of different species (see Meth-
ods). To directly compare the microbial abundance across sam-
ples, we computed the representation of microbial genome copies
relative to human genomes copies and expressed this quantity as
relative genome equivalents (RGE).
We detected a very high load of BKV cfDNA in all 25 samples
collected from 23 subjects diagnosed with BKVN by needle
biopsy (mean 1.49 +/− 1.08 × 105 RGE, Fig. 2a) but not in
10 samples from 10 subjects that were BKVN negative per biopsy
(all below detection limit). In these 35 biopsy-associated samples,
the BKV cfDNA abundance (RGE) correlated with a matched
urine cell pellet BKV VP1 mRNA copy measurement that we
previously validated as a noninvasive marker for BKVN27,28
(Spearman’s rho = 0.74, p = 3.48 × 10−7).
We quantified bacterial urinary cfDNA in 43 urine samples
from 31 subjects who had a corresponding positive urine
culture obtained on the same day (see Methods for definition).
For 41 of the 43 positive urine specimens, a bacterial organism
was reported to the species level by conventional culture. In 40 of
these 41 samples, sequencing of urinary cfDNA detected the
clinically reported organisms to the species level (Fig. 2b). For a
single sample, urinary cfDNA did not match with the bacterial
culture: Raoultella ornithinolytica was isolated in culture but not
detected by cfDNA sequencing (see Methods for a detailed
discussion of this discordant readout). For 2 of the 43 clinically

 positive samples, the suspected etiologic agent was identified to
the genus level (Staphylococcus, reported as coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus species [CoNS], and Streptococcus, reported as
viridans group streptococci) by culture. In both these cases, the
reported organism was detected as the most prevalent within the
sample. From the 43 cultures, we examined 6 with polymicrobial
bacterial infection (defined as 2 individual bacterial taxon
detected at the genus or species level). For five out of six of
these cases, we observed both species among the ten most
abundant species by cfDNA sequencing. In one sample, the
secondary bacterial agent, CoNS (<10,000 colony-forming units
[cfu]/mL), was not detected.
To further assess the performance of urinary cfDNA for
microbial identification, we compared the relative genomic
abundance (RGE) of bacterial cfDNA for subjects diagnosed
with bacterial infection (49 bacterial isolates identified from 43
clean-catch midstream cultures) to the relative genomic abun-
dance (RGE) measured for 43 negative clean-catch midstream
urine cultures (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 1). We found very
good agreement between urinary cfDNA and culture-based
isolation of Enterococcus faecalis (number of matched positive
cultures, n = 11, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.97, 95%
confidence interval [CI] = 0.935–1), Enterococcus faecium (n =
2, AUC = 0.98, CI = 0.976–1), Escherichia coli (n = 21, AUC =
0.97, CI = 0.93–1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3, AUC = 1.00,
CI = 1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3, AUC = 1.00, CI = 1),
CoNS (n = 4, AUC = 0.78, CI = 0.46–1). Here receiver operator
characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for bacterial species
where there was at least one positive culture of the same organism
available (n > 1).
In only 60% of the examined samples (26/43 UTI cases) was
the organism identified in culture the most prevalent organism in
the sample as measured by cfDNA (Fig. 2b). Whereas bacterial
culture is skewed toward species that are readily isolated on
routine bacteriological media employed for urine culture, cfDNA
sequence analyses permit the identification of a broader spectrum
of bacterial species. To evaluate this concept further, we assayed
two samples collected from one of the subjects included in the
analysis above diagnosed with Haemophilus influenzae bacteruria.
H. influenzae is a very uncommon uropathogen that does not
routinely grow on media employed for conventional urine culture
(tryptic soy agar with sheep blood and MacConkey agar)29.
Repeated urine cultures for this patient were negative, but given a
urinalysis suggestive of a UTI and given that the patient
developed H. influenzae bacteremia, the original urine specimen
collected at presentation was re-plated onto chocolate agar, upon
which H. influenzae was isolated. In the sample taken at the time
of presentation, which was cultured, and also a sample taken
4 days after presentation, we observed H. influenzae cfDNA
(0.037 RGE and 0.41 RGE, respectively). This case supports the
utility of urinary cfDNA to identify infections where conventional
culture fails.
Profiling the urinary microbiome. The urinary tract was
regarded as sterile but recent studies have revealed that it often
harbors microbiota10,30,31. We examined the composition of the
urinary microbiome by urinary cfDNA profiling (absence of UTI,
n = 43) or collected within the first 3 days post-transplant (n =
12) (Supplementary Fig. 2). We found that the species-level
abundance and the species-level diversity of the bacteriome are a
function of the transplant recipient gender but not the donor
gender. On average, we observed two to three orders of magni-
tude more cfDNA from Gardnerella (6125×), Ureaplasma
(1686×), and Lactobacillus (321×) across female transplant reci-
pients who did not have a UTI at the time of sampling compared

 to male recipients who did not have UTI; these bacterial genera
have been characterized as microbial components of the vaginal
microbiome32. We examined the relationship between urine
collection methods and the abundance and diversity of the bac-
teriome and found a notably reduced bacterial load for samples
collected by indwelling catheter (samples collected within 4 days
after transplant) versus clean-catch urine samples. cfDNA may be
an ideal tool to study the urinary microbiome, but future studies
need to account for the effects of gender and sample collection
approaches.
Broad screening for viruses via cfDNA. We next screened for
the occurrence of cfDNA derived from viruses. Nearly half of the
samples (66/141) had detectable levels of cfDNA derived from
eukaryotic viruses that are potentially clinically relevant. Fig-
ure 2d highlights the frequent occurrence of JC polyomavirus,
parvovirus B19, Merkel cell polyomavirus, CMV, human her-
pesvirus
6A,
human
herpesvirus
6B,
and
various
known
oncoviruses across different patient groups. In several samples, we
detected cfDNA from multiple polyomavirus species concurrently
(JC polyomavirus or BKV). To shed light on the potential clinical
utility of broad screening for viruses via cfDNA, we assayed serial
urine from three subjects diagnosed with viral infections that are
relatively uncommon in kidney transplant recipients and conse-
quently not routinely screened for in our patient cohorts. In
samples from two subjects with clinically diagnosed parvovirus
B19 infection, we detected urinary cfDNA from parvovirus B19
8 days prior to the clinical diagnosis in one subject and urinary
parvovirus B19 cfDNA 80 days before diagnosis and 25 days after
diagnosis in another subject. In the former subject, we observed a
high abundance of both BKV (3.54 × 104 RGE) and parvovirus
B19 (2.48 × 104 RGE), which correlated with positive results of
individual viral-specific PCR tests for BKV and parvovirus B19.
For a third patient, we observed a high abundance of human
adenovirus B DNA in samples obtained 15 days before (2.52 × 103
RGE) and 9 days after (5.08 × 102 RGE) diagnosis of adenovirus
infection with conventional adenovirus urine PCR. These data

 support the utility of urinary cfDNA sequencing for the detection
of both common and uncommon viral agents.
Quantifying bacterial growth rates. Conventional metagenomic
sequencing can provide a snapshot of the microbiome yet does
not inform about microbial life cycles or growth dynamics. In a
recent study, Korem and colleagues reported that the pattern of
metagenomic sequencing read coverage across a microbial gen-
ome can be used to quantify microbial genome replication rates
for microbes in complex communities33. We tested whether this
concept can be used to estimate bacterial population growth from
measurements of cfDNA. Figure 3a shows the urinary cfDNA
sequence coverage for four bacterial species, E. coli, K. pneumo-
niae, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Cutibacterium acnes. For two
subjects diagnosed with E. coli and K. pneumoniae UTI (Fig. 3a),
the E. coli and K. pneumoniae genome coverage was highly non-
uniform, with an overrepresentation of sequences at the origin of
replication and an underrepresentation of sequences at the
replication terminus. The shape of the E. coli and K. pneumoniae
genome coverage is a result of bi-directional replication from a
single origin of replication. The skew in genome coverage reflects
the bacterial population growth rate, where a stronger skew sig-
nals faster population growth34. The genome coverage of a
common inhabitant and sometimes uropathogenic bacterial
species, G. vaginalis, exhibited non-uniform genome coverage
(Fig. 3a), similar to the E. coli and K. pneumoniae cases above but
less pronounced. C. acnes has been recognized as a common skin
commensal and contaminant in the setting of molecular assays35.
The genome coverage for C. acnes was highly uniform, indicative
of slow or no growth (aggregate across 99 samples in which C.
acnes cfDNA was detected, Fig. 3a).
We asked whether this measure of bacterial growth can be used
to inform bacterial UTI diagnosis. We calculated an index of
replication based on the shape of the sequencing coverage using
methods described previously34. We used BLAST to identify
abundant bacterial strains and then re-aligned all sequences with
BWA36 to a curated list of bacterial species. Samples for which the
genome coverage was too sparse were excluded from this analysis
(see Methods). Figure 3b compares the index of replication for
bacteria detected by cfDNA in samples from subjects diagnosed
with UTI to the index of replication for bacteria detected by
cfDNA in samples from subjects with negative cultures and in
samples collected from subjects prior to UTI development (Pre-
UTI group) or after UTI development (Post-UTI group). Species
categorized in the UTI group had markedly greater growth rates
than those in the no UTI and Pre-/Post-UTI groups (two-tailed
Wilcox rank-sum test, p = 9.0 × 10−3).
Antimicrobial resistome profiling. For 42 of the 43 samples
collected from subjects with clinically confirmed UTIs, we
determined the relative abundance of genes conferring resistance
to several classes of antimicrobials (a single sample, for which no
AR gene fragments were observed, was excluded from this ana-
lysis). We used blastp to align non-human sequences against
known AR genes and mutations37. AR gene sequences were
aggregated and called against the non-redundant Comprehensive
Antibiotic Resistance Database that indicates the drug resistance
conferred by the given gene37.
We compared the results of phenotypic antimicrobial suscept-
ibility testing (see Methods) to the resistance profiles determined
by cfDNA sequencing. For most samples, there was a high
diversity in alignments with highly abundant resistance classes
including resistance to macrolides, aminoglycosides, and beta-
lactams (Fig. 4). We studied vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus
(VRE) infections, which often lead to complications after
transplantation7,
in
depth.
Resistance
to
vancomycin
was
clinically assessed via measurement of the minimum inhibitory
concentration value using broth microdilution on the MicroScan
WalkAway platform according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(see Methods). We detected fragments of genes conferring
resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic class, of which vanco-
mycin is a member, for all VRE-positive samples (n = 4).
Moreover, for samples with Enterococcus that tested as vanco-
mycin susceptible (n = 7), we did not detect fragments of

 glycopeptide class resistance genes (Fig. 4). These data indicate
potential to predict antimicrobial susceptibility from measure-
ments of urinary cfDNA.
Host response to infection. We next examined the host response
to viral and bacterial infections. Recent work has identified
transplant donor-specific cfDNA in plasma as a marker of graft
injury in heart, lung, liver, and kidney transplantation16,38–40.
Here we quantified donor-specific cfDNA in urine for sex-
mismatched donor recipient pairs (i.e., male donor, female reci-
pient; female donor, male recipient) by counting Y chromosome-
derived cfDNA (Fig. 5a, Methods). We observed elevated levels of
donor cfDNA in the urine of subjects diagnosed with BKVN
(mean proportion of donor DNA 65.1%, n = 12) compared to the
urine of subjects who had normal biopsies (no BKVN, mean
51.4%, n = 4) and samples from subjects who did not develop a
clinical UTI in the first 3 months of transplantation (mean 25.5%,
n = 11, samples collected within 5 days after transplant excluded).
The release of donor DNA reflects severe cellular and tissue injury
in the graft, a hallmark of BKVN. In contrast to subjects with
BKVN, subjects diagnosed with bacterial UTI had lower pro-
portions of donor DNA as compared to individuals without
bacterial UTI. This is likely explained by an elevated number of
recipient immune cells in the urinary tract following immune
activation. Indeed, comparison to clinical urinalysis indicates that
the donor fraction decreases with increasing white blood cell
count (WBC) per high power field (HPF) 400× microscope
magnification, inset Fig. 5a, Spearman’s rho = −0.57, p = 1.3 ×
10−4). Furthermore, clinical cases of pyuria, defined as >10 WBC
per HPF41, had a lower donor fraction than those without (two-
tailed Wilcox test, p = 8.0 × 10−4). In addition, we found that the
level of donor DNA in the first few days after transplant was
elevated, consistent with early graft injury. We tracked the relative
and absolute abundance of donor-specific urinary cfDNA in the
first few days after transplantation for a small subset of subjects
(n = 5). The initial elevated level of donor cfDNA quickly
decayed to a lower baseline level (Fig. 5b), in line with previous
observations in heart and lung transplantation16,42.
Two studies recently demonstrated that the structure of
chromatin in gene promoters is conserved within circulating
cfDNA in plasma43,44. Ulz et al. employed whole-genome
sequencing of plasma DNA to show that nucleosomal occupancy
at transcription start sites results in different read depth coverage
patterns for expressed and silent genes44. Here we found that
footprints of nucleosomes in gene promoters and transcriptional
regulatory elements are conserved within urinary cfDNA (Fig. 5c,
aggregation and normalization across all samples) and that the
extent of nucleosomal protection is proportional to gene
expression. Measurements of nucleosomal depletion can serve
as a proxy for increased gene expression and may be used to
investigate host–pathogen interactions in the setting of UTI in
more detail.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the urine was recently
identified as a possible biomarker for hypertensive kidney
damage45. Furthermore, recent data indicate a role for extra-
cellular mtDNA as a powerful damage-associated molecular
pattern (DAMP). Elevated levels of mtDNA in plasma have been
reported in trauma, sepsis, and cancer, and recent studies have
identified mtDNA released into the circulation by necrotic cells46.
For a small subset of subjects diagnosed with BKVN (8 samples
from 7 subjects), we quantified donor- and recipient-specific
mtDNA in urine using an approach we have previously
described20. We found that the graft is the predominant source
of mitochondrial urinary cfDNA in seven of the eight samples
(two-tailed Student's t-test, p < 10−6; see Methods). Molecular
techniques to track DAMPs in urine released in the setting of
kidney graft injury may provide a non-invasive window into the
potential
role
of
these
molecules
in
immune-related
complications.
Discussion
We have presented a strategy to identify and assess infections of
the urinary tract based on profiling of urinary cfDNA and ‘omics
analysis principles. We show that different layers of clinical
information are accessible from a single assay that are either
inaccessible using current diagnostic protocols or require parallel
implementation of a multitude of different tests. In nearly all
samples with clinically reported viral or bacterial infection of the
urinary tract, cfDNA identified the suspected causative agent of
infection. In addition, cfDNA sequencing revealed the frequent

genes conferring resistance to various antimicrobial classes. These data are organized in three sample groups: samples from subjects with vancomycin-
resistant Enterococcus (Resistant), samples from subjects with vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus (Susceptible), and samples from subjects for which
vancomycin resistance testing was not performed (Untested). Samples in which fragments of genes that confer resistance to glycopeptide class antibiotics
(including vancomycin, red outlines) were detected are marked by red crosshairs. See Supplementary Data 8

 occurrence of cfDNA from bacteria that remain undetected in
current clinical practice. In many samples, including those from
subjects regarded as clinically stable, we detected cfDNA from
viruses that may be clinically relevant but not routinely assayed in
the screening protocol at our institution. The assay we present has
the potential to become a valuable tool to monitor bacteriuria and
viruria in kidney transplant cohorts and to ascertain their
potential impact on allograft health.
Beyond measurement of the abundance of different compo-
nents of the microbiome, urinary cfDNA provides a wealth of
information about bacterial phenotypes. We show, for the first
time, that analyses of the structure of microbial genomes from
cfDNA allow estimation of bacterial population growth rates,
thereby providing information about dynamics from a single
snapshot. We compared the bacterial growth rates in samples with
clinically diagnosed UTI to those without diagnosed UTI, and we
observed higher growth rates for clinically reported bacteria in
subjects diagnosed with UTI. We further show that metagenomic
analysis of urinary cfDNA can be used to infer antimicrobial
susceptibility. We mined cfDNA sequencing data for AR genes
and found a good agreement between the presence of AR genes
and in vitro phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing results.
cfDNA resistome profiling may have added potential over con-
ventional AR testing methods as these methods typically use one
or a few cultured colonies. cfDNA profiling can potentially capture
AR gene fragments from the entire bacterial population, which
may be particularly important since cfDNA profiling revealed
frequent putative co-infections within the UTI group.
Several new methodologies have been introduced in recent
years to characterize the urinary microbiome and to diagnose
UTI, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing31,47,48 and expanded
culture techniques9,49. These approaches have challenged the
clinical dogma that urine from healthy individuals is sterile30 and
have revealed potential deficiencies in the culture protocols that
are used in clinical practice today10,31. The cfDNA shotgun
sequencing assay described here provides a versatile alternative
that will be particularly useful for monitoring kidney transplant
recipients, given the potential to enable viral and bacterial
pathogen detection, AR profiling, and graft injury assessment
from a single assay.
More than 15,000 patients receive lifesaving kidney transplants
in the United States each year50. Viral and bacterial infections of
the urinary tract occur frequently in this patient group and often
lead to serious complications, including graft loss and death. In
the general population, UTI is one of the most frequent medical
problems that patients present with51. Shotgun DNA sequencing
of urinary cfDNA offers a comprehensive window into infections
of the urinary tract and could be a valuable diagnostic tool to

acute rejection episode in the months prior. Low donor fractions in the Pre-/Post-UTI and UTI groups are likely due to increased immune cell, i.e., WBC,

 monitor and diagnose bacterial and viral infections in kidney
transplantation as well as in the general population. The assay we
have presented is compatible with a short assay turnaround time
(1–2 days) and will benefit from continued technical advances in
DNA sequencing that will reduce cost and increase throughput in
years to come.
Methods
Study cohort and sample collection. One hundred and forty one urine samples
were collected from kidney transplant recipients who received care at New York
Presbyterian Hospital–Weill Cornell Medical Center. We assayed urine samples
from a total of 82 subjects. We assayed urine samples from a total of 82 subjects.
The study was approved by the Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Review Board
(protocols 9402002786, 1207012730, 0710009490). All patients provided written
informed consent.
Bacterial group: We included 99 urine samples from 34 subjects who developed
bacterial UTI diagnosed within the first 12 months of transplantation and
14 subjects who never developed UTI within the first 3 months of transplantation.
For the 34 subjects who developed UTIs, we assayed 43 urine samples
corresponding to same day positive urine cultures (UTI group); we assayed 15
urine samples from 15 subjects, collected at least 2–16 days (median 7 days) prior
to development of the positive urine cultures (Pre-UTI group), and we assayed 12
urine samples from 9 subjects, collected at least 3–26 days (median 9 days) after
development of the positive urine cultures (Post-UTI group) (7 of the 9 subjects
were treated with antibiotics). We assayed a total of 29 samples collected within
3 months after transplantation from 14 subjects who never developed UTI in the
first 3 months of transplantation.
Viral group: The study further included 25 samples from 23 subjects who had a
corresponding positive diagnosis of BKVN by needle biopsy of the kidney allograft
(BKVN-positive group, 1 sample was also associated with a positive bacterial urine
culture) and 10 samples from 10 subjects who had a normal protocol biopsy and
were negative for BKV (BKVN-negative group). Finally, the study analyzed seven
samples from three subjects who developed clinically diagnosed rare viral
infections, including parvovirus or adenovirus. See also detailed clinical metadata
in Supplementary Data 1.
Conventional bacterial culture, bacterial identification, and antimicrobial
susceptibility testing. Ninety of the 141 samples in the study had a corresponding
same day urine culture. Each of these clean-catch midstream culture urine samples was
inoculated onto tryptic soy agar with sheep blood (Becton, Dickinson and Company
[BD], Franklin Lakes, NJ) and MacConkey agar (BD) using a 1-μL inoculation loop
and incubated in ambient air at 35 °C. Four urine samples were reported as mixed
bacterial flora and were excluded because of lack of further identification and
86 samples were defined as either negative urine culture (n = 43) or positive urine
culture (n = 43) for the cfDNA/bacterial correlation analyses and ROC analyses.
A positive urine culture was defined as a culture growing an organism identified
to at least the genus level (almost all bacterial isolates were recovered at a colony
count ≥10,000 cfu/mL, while three isolates were recovered at a colony count
<10,000 cfu/mL). A urine culture was defined as negative when either no organism
was isolated in culture (35 cultures, <1000 cfu/mL) or the organism was
unidentified to either the genus or species level (i.e., unidentified) and the colony
count was <10,000 cfu/mL (8 cultures).
Bacterial isolates were identified using either abbreviated identification
algorithms52 or MicroScan (Beckman Coulter, Inc., West Sacramento, CA)
identification panels: Neg ID Type 2 panel for Gram-negative bacteria and Pos
Combo 33 panel for Gram-positive bacteria, in conjunction with the WalkAway
plus system (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). In two cases, the organism isolated in culture
was identified using the MALDI Biotyper CA System (Bruker Daltonics, Inc.,
Billerica, MA). Testing on the WalkAway plus and MALDI Biotyper CA systems
was performed per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using broth microdilution or
disk diffusion. Broth microdilution testing was accomplished using MicroScan
antimicrobial susceptibility testing panels on the WalkAway plus system according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Gram-negative organisms were tested using the
Neg MIC 42 panel or the Pos Combo 33 panel for Gram-positive organisms. In a
single instance, an E. faecalis isolate was assayed with the Pos MIC 34 panel. An
isolate of H. influenzae was tested using the disk diffusion method as
recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M02-
A1253. All antimicrobial susceptibility data were interpreted according to the CLSI
M100 document. The M100 version used for interpretation varied depending on
the year the isolate was recovered in culture: M100-S25 (2015)54, M100-S26
(2016)55, and M100-S27 (2017)56.
Conventional viral identification. Quantitative adenovirus and parvovirus B19
PCR was performed on urine samples in an outside reference laboratory (Viracor
Eurofins, Lee’s Summit, MO).
Analysis of discordance against bacterial culture. In a single sample, urinary
cfDNA did not identify the organism reported by conventional culture: R. orni-
thinolytica. The patient had developed an E. coli UTI on postoperative day 6 and
was treated initially with aztreonam but switched to cephalexin for a 14-day course.
The subject subsequently developed a UTI that conventional bacterial culture
revealed to be R. ornithinolytica on postoperative day 25. cfDNA analysis on urine
samples collected on postoperative days 6 and 25 revealed a high abundance of
E. coli cfDNA and no evidence of R. ornithinolytica cfDNA. Given the discordant
results, it is unclear if the second culture growing R. ornithinolytica is a recurrence
as suggested by the cfDNA analysis or is an infection with a different organism as
suggested by the urine culture data.
Urine collection and supernatant isolation. Most urine samples were collected
via the conventional clean-catch midstream culture method (n = 130). Samples
obtained prior to post-transplant day 4 were collected via indwelling catheter (n =
11). Approximately 50 mL of urine was centrifuged at 3000 × g on the same day for
30 min and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C in 1 or 4 mL aliquots (except for a
single H. influenzae UTI sample which was centrifuged for cfDNA analysis 5 days
after collection). cfDNA was extracted from 1 mL (131 samples) or 4 mL
(10 samples) of urine according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen Cir-
culating Nucleic Acid Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
Negative control. To control for environmental and sample-to-sample con-
tamination, a known-template control sample (IDT-DNA synthetic oligo mix,
lengths 25, 40, 55, 70 bp; 0.20 µM eluted in TE buffer) was included with every
sample batch and sequenced to a fraction of the depth of the cfDNA extracts (~5
million fragments). The number of bacterial and viral reads detected in the controls
was quantified for each genus and normalized to the total reads across the controls.
This fractional representation was used to filter out genera detected at low level in
the clinical samples: any genus for which the fractional representation in the
clinical sample was within five standard deviations from the mean measured in the
controls was removed. Possible sources of contamination in these experiments
include: environmental contamination during sample collection in the clinic,
nucleic acid contamination in reagents used for DNA isolation and library pre-
paration, and sample-to-sample contamination due to Illumina index switching57.
Library preparation and next-generation sequencing. Sequencing libraries were
prepared using a single-stranded library preparation optimized for the analysis of
ultrashort fragment DNA20. Briefly, cfDNA was denatured and biotinylated
adapters were ligated via single-stranded DNA ligation. Primer extension was
performed on streptavidin functionalized magnetic beads and a second set of
adapters was ligated by double-stranded DNA ligation. Finally, the molecules were
PCR amplified (4–12 cycles). Libraries were characterized using the AATI fragment
analyzer. Samples were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq platform
(paired-end, 2 × 75 bp). Approximately 45 million paired-end reads were generated
per sample.
Analysis—composition of the urinary microbiome. Low-quality bases and
Illumina-specific sequences were trimmed (Trimmomatic-0.3258). Reads from
short fragments were merged and a consensus sequence of the overlapping bases
were determined using FLASH-1.2.7. Reads were aligned (Bowtie2, very sensitive
mode59) against the human reference (UCSC hg19). Unaligned reads were
extracted, and the non-redundant human genome coverage was calculated
(SAMtools 0.1.19 rmdup60). To derive the urinary microbiome, reads were
BLASTed (NCBI BLAST 2.2.28+) to a curated list of bacterial and viral reference
genomes61. The relative abundance of different species in a sample was estimated
based on the BLAST reports using GRAMMy, a software that implements a
maximum likelihood algorithm and takes into account the ambiguity of read
mapping26,38,62. The relative abundance of higher level taxa was determined based
on the relative abundance at the strain or species level. For positive identification of
viruses, we required at least 10 BLAST hits. In addition, due to the high load and
genetic similarity of BK and JC polyomaviruses, we implemented a conservative
filter for incompleteness and heterogeneity of genome coverage (GINI index <0.8
with at least 75% of the genome covered) for these two species only. Code available
upon request.
ROC analysis. ROC analyses were performed using the function “roc” in the R
package pROC. For each species, we compared the relative genomic abundance of
species (in RGE) in urine samples matched to a positive culture to the relative
genomic abundance of the same species in culture-negative samples.
Bacterial growth dynamics. Bacterial genome replication rates were determined
using the approach described by Brown et al.34. Briefly, all bacterial strains within a
sample were sorted and the GC-skew was used to identify the origin and terminus
of replication (minimum and maximum GC-skew, respectively). Bacterial genomes
were binned in 1 kbp tiles. The coverage was smoothed based on a running mean of
100 nearest neighboring tiles. The coverage in each tile was quantified and tiles
were sorted by coverage. Linear regression was performed between the origin and

 terminus of replication after further removing the 5% least and most covered bins.
The product of the slope of the regression line and the genome length was defined
as the growth rate, a metric applied in previous analyses34. This analysis was
applied for all bacterial strains with genome lengths >0.5 Mbp, R2 linear regression
correlation, as previously described, >0.90, and GINI index coefficient <0.2, for
which at least 2500 BLAST hits were detected in the sample.
Nucleosome footprints in gene bodies. Paired-end reads were aligned using
BWA-mem36. The sequence read coverage in 2-kbp windows around the tran-
scription start sites of all genes was determined using the SAMtools depth func-
tion44. A list of transcription start sites organized by transcriptional activity was
obtained from Ulz et al.44. The depth of coverage was summed across genes with
similar transcriptional activity.
Proportion of donor-specific cfDNA in urine. The fraction of donor-specific
cfDNA in urine and plasma samples was estimated for sex-mismatched,
donor–recipient pairs. The donor fraction was determined as follows:
Male donor; female recipient : D ¼ 2Y=A
Female donor; male recipient : D ¼ 1 �
2Y
A
�
�
where Y and A are the coverage of the mappability-adjusted Y and autosomal
chromosomes, respectively. Sequence mappability was determined using
HMMcopy63.
Mitochondrial donor fraction. The proportion of donor-specific mtDNA was
quantified using methods previously described20. Briefly, mtDNA was extracted
from pretransplant whole blood samples, amplified, underwent library preparation,
and was sequenced. Processing was separate for donor and recipient samples. Raw
sequencing data was trimmed and aligned to the human genome, and mitochon-
drial sequences were selected. We estimated the presence of each nucleotide at each
position using bam-readcount (https://github.com/genome/bam-readcount), and a
mitochondrial consensus sequence was determined for the donor and recipient.
The consensus sequences were compared and single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) discriminating the two individuals were identified. Downstream cfDNA
sequence data aligning to the mitochondrial were compared to the bases with SNPs
that discriminate the donor and recipient. For each SNP position across the
mitochondrial genome, we determined the donor fraction by dividing the donor
SNP count by the total number of donor and recipient counts at the SNP. We
discarded a donor fraction estimation at a point if the depth of sequencing was
<50×. We determined the mean of the estimated donor fraction at all SNPs to
quantify the mitochondrial donor fraction. One sample was removed owing to low
depth of sequencing across all SNPs.
Antimicrobial resistance profiling. Paired-end nonhuman sequencing reads were
merged (FLASH-1.2.7). Subsequently, reads were aligned to a database of protein
sequences, in fasta format, of known AR genes (CARD 1.1.5, 2158 genes) using
blastx64 (evalue 10−7, culling limit 8 blastx hits). We implemented a filter post-
alignment that eliminated reads with <90% similarity between the query and
reference. Hits with the highest identity and overlap length were selected for each
read. CARD data includes an ontology for the AR class to which each gene confers
resistance, if known37. We matched the ontology-derived antimicrobial classes
described in Fig. 4 to the gene alignment from blastx, giving a measure of each
antimicrobial class for each gene hit. If a gene conferred resistance to multiple
antimicrobial classes, each class was attributed a hit. The hits were aggregated to
provide an antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the sample.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.3.2.
Unless otherwise noted, groups were compared using the nonparametric
Mann–Whitney U test. Fourier analyses were performed using the spec.pgram
function, part of the standard stats package, in R.
Boxplots. Boxes in the boxplots indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, the band in
the box indicates the median, lower whiskers extend from the hinge to the smallest
value at most 1.5× IQR of the hinge, and higher whiskers extend from the hinge to
the highest value at most 1.5× IQR of the hinge.

made available in the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), accession
number phs001564.v1.p1.
