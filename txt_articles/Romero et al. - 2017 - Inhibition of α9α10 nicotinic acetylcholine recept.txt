Opioids are first-line drugs for moderate to severe acute pain and
cancer pain. However, these medications are associated with severe
side effects, and whether they are efficacious in treatment of chronic
nonmalignant pain remains controversial. Medications that act through
alternative molecular mechanisms are critically needed. Antagonists of
α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have been proposed
as an important nonopioid mechanism based on studies demonstrating
prevention of neuropathology after trauma-induced nerve injury. How-
ever, the key α9α10 ligands characterized to date are at least two
orders of magnitude less potent on human vs. rodent nAChRs, limiting
their translational application. Furthermore, an alternative proposal
that these ligands achieve their beneficial effects by acting as agonists
of GABAB receptors has caused confusion over whether blockade of
α9α10 nAChRs is the fundamental underlying mechanism. To address
these issues definitively, we developed RgIA4, a peptide that exhibits
high potency for both human and rodent α9α10 nAChRs, and was at
least 1,000-fold more selective for α9α10 nAChRs vs. all other molec-
ular targets tested, including opioid and GABAB receptors. A daily s.c.
dose of RgIA4 prevented chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain in
rats. In wild-type mice, oxaliplatin treatment produced cold allodynia
that could be prevented by RgIA4. Additionally, in α9 KO mice, che-
motherapy-induced development of cold allodynia was attenuated
and the milder, temporary cold allodynia was not relieved by RgIA4.
These findings establish blockade of α9-containing nAChRs as the
basis for the efficacy of RgIA4, and that α9-containing nAChRs are a
critical target for prevention of chronic cancer chemotherapy-
induced neuropathic pain.

pioids are first-line treatments for the treatment of acute
postoperative and cancer pain. However, the unprecedented
and epidemic use of opioids to treat chronic nonmalignant pain has
resulted in a broad range of problems, including an estimated 12
million Americans who currently abuse or are addicted to pre-
scription opioids, with tens of thousands of overdose deaths (1, 2).
To deal with this crisis, recent US Health and Human Services
efforts have targeted physician-prescribing practices, medication-
assisted treatments for addiction, and distribution of opioid an-
tagonist kits to enable attempts to reverse opioid overdose, with
billions of dollars expended annually in these efforts (2, 3). In the
long term, however, greater impact on therapy would arise from
discovery and development of medications based on nonopioid
mechanisms that can effectively treat chronic pain, and that may
additionally have disease-modifying actions on chronic pain. To
facilitate this goal, new molecular targets are urgently needed. In
the past 50 y, however, very few new pain drugs with novel non-
opioid receptor-based mechanisms have been approved.
In the search for new molecular targets, a standard approach is
to use molecular genetics. Thus, a subtype of the voltage-gated
sodium channel Nav1.7 was identified as a potential molecular
target for pain therapeutics, triggering a number of large drug
development programs (4). However, an alternative parallel ap-
proach is to identify compounds that are effective analgesics, and to
determine the molecular targets whose functions they modulate. If
the compound is a natural product, it has presumably been evolved
to interact with a physiologically relevant target. Natural products
with analgesic properties have always been important potential
leads (e.g., both morphine and aspirin are based on natural
products). One more recent example that uncovered a nonopioid
mechanism is the cone snail venom peptide, ω-conotoxin MVIIA,
which targets a specific voltage-gated calcium channel subtype (Cav
2.2). This cone snail venom peptide has become a US Food and
Drug Administration-approved drug, ziconotide (5). Identification
of Cav 2.2 as a validated molecular target has further spurred drug
development programs aimed at identifying and characterizing
small-molecule compounds targeted to Cav 2.2.
Another potential molecular target that was identified using
this approach is the α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
(nAChR). The pioneering work of Livett et al. (6) and Livett and
coworkers (7, 8) demonstrated the analgesic activity of Vc1.1, a
peptide in the α-conotoxin family, a group of venom peptides
from cone snails that are generally targeted to nAChRs. Vc1.1
later entered phase II human clinical trials as a drug for chronic
pain, but positive efficacy data were not reported. When the
Significance
This study addresses the need to phase out opioids as the
major analgesic drugs for moderate to severe chronic pain. We
establish that a highly selective and potent inhibitor of the
α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtype pre-
vents the expression of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic
pain. Thus, selective antagonists of the α9α10 nAChR are po-
tential leads for nonopioid analgesic drug development. The
effects of inhibitors of the α9α10 receptor, together with ge-
netic studies, suggest a key role for the α9α10 nAChR subtype
in an intercellular signaling network that can be activated by
diverse insults (e.g., chemotherapy, nerve injury, and diabetes).

 human clinical trials were initiated, the molecular target of Vc1.1
was unknown; it was later established that the peptide was a
potent antagonist of the α9α10 nAChR (9). This targeting
specificity provided a plausible mechanistic rationale for the
failed clinical development: a striking “affinity gap” of the Vc1.1
peptide for the human vs. rodent α9α10 nAChR, with the human
receptor having orders of magnitude lower potency (10–12).
The studies carried out on Vc1.1 also suggested that the α9α10
nAChR was a molecular target for pain based on a unique mech-
anism: Inhibition of this receptor not only alleviated pain but actu-
ally altered the pathophysiology of the disease state (7, 8). This
disease progression prevention was recently more thoroughly char-
acterized using a second peptide targeted to the α9α10 nAChR,
α-conotoxin RgIA from the venom of Conus regius. A peripheral
nerve trauma and neuroinflammation model, chronic constriction
injury (CCI), was used to demonstrate that RgIA attenuated not
only the pathophysiological alterations to the injured nerve but also
maladaptive CNS changes (13). Thus, the data with Vc1.1 and RgIA
suggest that inhibition of the α9α10 nAChR provides an entirely
novel nonopioid mechanism that involves alleviating pain symptoms
not only acutely but also by possibly altering disease progression.
Recently, however, several investigators have questioned
whether Vc1.1 and RgIA act through the α9α10 nAChR to al-
leviate pain; instead, they suggest that these peptides exert their
effects by stimulating GABAB receptors (14–19). The series of
papers published by these investigators therefore confuses the
issue of whether or not the α9α10 nAChR is a validated mo-
lecular target for pain. Thus, whether antagonism of this α9α10
receptor is efficacious and may prevent progression to patho-
logical chronic pain states needs to be definitively addressed.
To clarify these important issues, we have developed an analog of
α-conotoxin RgIA that has suitable properties for investigating such
mechanistic questions. In contrast to the affinity gap of both Vc1.1
and RgIA for the human α9α10 nAChR, the analog developed in
this study, RgIA4, has high affinity for both the rodent and human
α9α10 nAChRs while retaining highly selective targeting. Impor-
tantly, the analog has no activity on the GABAB receptor. We used
RgIA4 to address two questions. First, is this peptide active on a very
different model of pathological chronic pain other than traumatic
nerve injury, and if so, does it prevent disease progression to the
chronic pain state? Second, does this peptide exert its biological
activity by inhibition of the α9α10 nAChR? The results of these
experiments show that this α9α10-selective peptide, RgIA4, does
indeed prevent expression of chronic pain in a chemotherapy-in-
duced neuropathic pain model, and that activity at the α9α10
nAChR is sufficient for these effects. Thus, our results establish that
the α9α10 nAChR is a valid molecular target for analgesic com-
pounds, and that inhibition of this receptor is a unique mechanism
to prevent the progression to a neuropathic pain state.
Results
Development of RgIA4, an Analog of α-Conotoxin RgIA. We have
carried out a broad program to identify and develop peptides
that target α9α10 nAChRs, and five diverse structural families
of conotoxins that inhibit α9α10 receptors have been charac-
terized (20–25). Two α-conotoxins from cone snail venoms,
Vc1.1 and RgIA, are particularly promising in terms of their
analgesic properties and the prevention of neuropathology;
however, as detailed in the Introduction, these peptides
exhibited a striking decline in affinity for the human receptor
compared with the rodent α9α10 nAChR. The weak affinity of
Vc1.1 for the human receptor is likely responsible for the
failure of phase II human clinical trials. We therefore sought to
develop analogs that had high affinity and selectivity for the
human α9α10 nAChR.
Our approach was to assess the structure activity relationships
of a small library of mutant α-conotoxins that were produced by
chemical synthesis. We systematically mutated non-Cys residues
of RgIA, the smallest of the α9α10 nAChR-targeted conotoxins,
and we found that residues in both the first and second disulfide
loops of RgIA could be changed to shift potency favorably (Fig.
1). By combining these mutations to create second-generation

 analogs, 13 amino acid peptides were generated that, unlike the
native RgIA, had high affinity for the human α9α10 nAChR (Fig.
2 and Table 1). The parent peptide, RgIA, produced only partial
blockade of the human α9α10 nAChR at concentrations up to
33 μM. In contrast, analogs RgIA4 and RgIA5 produced com-
plete blockade of the nAChR with low nanomolar potencies.
Although RgIA4 was not the most potent analog identified, it
was the most selective for the human α9α10 nAChR (Fig. S1 and
Table 2). In addition, we selected peptides that retained high
affinity and selectivity for the rat α9α10 nAChR (Table 1) to
facilitate mechanistic studies. RgIA4 was the most selective of
these analogs, and when further tested against opioid receptor
subtypes and a broad panel of other receptors and ion channels,
micromolar levels of the peptide showed low or no activity as
summarized in Tables 3 and 4. When the RgIA4 peptide was tested
on the GABAB receptor using three different assays, it elicited
no activity; these results are shown in Fig. S2. Thus, RgIA4 is
1,000- to 10,000-fold selective for the α9α10 nAChR compared
with all other tested receptors.
RgIA4 Relieves Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathic Pain. Oxaliplatin
is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent used to treat colorectal can-
cers. In humans, side effects include neurotoxicity, and prominent
symptoms of acute neuropathy include sensitivity to touching cold
items, discomfort in swallowing cold items, throat discomfort, and
muscle cramps. Cold-related sensitivity is rated as the most severe
symptom. Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathic pain in rats is
a commonly used model of human chemotherapy-induced neuro-
pathic pain (26). We therefore assessed the pain-relieving effects of
RgIA4, which potently blocks α9α10 nAChRs but lacks activity on
GABAB receptors. Oxaliplatin administration in rats produced cold
allodynia (i.e., pain due to a cold stimulus that does not usually
provoke pain). Repeated daily s.c. injections (5 d each week) of
RgIA4 at doses of 0.128–80 μg/kg prevented chemotherapy-induced
cold allodynia; assessments were performed 24 h after the last
RgIA4 dose on days 8, 15, and 22 (P < 0.01 for all measures; Fig.
3A). Repeated oxaliplatin administration in rats also induced a low
pain threshold in response to mechanical noxious stimuli (Fig. 3 B
and C). Administration of RgIA4 (0.128–80 μg/kg) prevented me-
chanical hypersensitivity at 30 min and 24 h post-RgIA4 dosing at
all concentrations tested (Fig. 3 B and C). No behavioral, neuro-
logical, or autonomic effects were observed in rats administered
RgIA4 (100 μg/kg) daily for 21 d or in rats administered a single
dose of RgIA4 (5 mg/kg) (Tables S1–S3).
Comparison of Wild-Type and α9 nAChR KO Mice. To determine the
role of α9-containing nAChRs for chemotherapy-induced cold allo-
dynia and RgIA4-mediated pain relief further, we compared wild-
type and α9 nAChR KO mice using the oxaliplatin model. Four
groups of mice were treated daily (5 d each week) with (i) vehicle (i.
p.) + vehicle (s.c.), (ii) vehicle (i.p.) + RgIA4 (40 μg/kg s.c.), (iii)
oxaliplatin (i.p.) + vehicle (s.c.), or (iv) oxaliplatin (i.p.) + RgIA4 (s.
c.). Mice were assessed for oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia using a
cold-plate test on day 1 and again on days 8, 15, and 22.
In the first group of animals, mice were assessed 30 min and
24 h after the last injection. At 30 min after injection, oxaliplatin-
treated wild-type mice differed significantly in paw withdrawal
latency from vehicle-injected controls on day 15 (P < 0.001) and
day 22 (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4). At 30 min after the last injection,
oxaliplatin-treated α9 KO mice did not differ significantly from
vehicle-injected α9 KO controls on any given day (P > 0.05). At
24 h after the last injection, oxaliplatin-treated wild-type and α9
KO mice both differed significantly from vehicle-treated controls
on day 22 (P < 0.001 for wild-type mice and P < 0.01 for α9
KO mice).

 In the second group of animals, mice were assessed 72 h after
the last injection. At 72 h after the last oxaliplatin injection,
oxaliplatin-treated wild-type mice significantly differed in paw
withdrawal latency from vehicle-treated controls on all test days:
day 8 (P < 0.05), day 15 (P < 0.05), and day 22 (P < 0.01). In
contrast, oxaliplatin-treated α9 KO mice did not differ from vehicle-
treated control mice on any treatment day. Overall, the data suggest
that compared with wild-type mice, α9 KO mice do not develop
chronic cold allodynia in response to oxaliplatin treatment.
We also compared the effects of oxaliplatin treatment in wild-type
and α9 KO mice that had been treated with RgIA4 (40 μg/kg).
When measured at 30 min or 24 h after the last injection, RgIA4
reversed oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia in wild-type mice by
day 22 (P < 0.001 at both time points) (Fig. 4). When measured at
72 h after the last injection, RgIA4 reversed oxaliplatin-induced
cold allodynia in wild-type mice by day 15 (P < 0.05) and on day 22
(P < 0.01). In contrast, RgIA4 did not have a significant effect on
the attenuated oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia in α9 KO mice at
any time point on any test day (all days, P > 0.05). Thus, daily s.c.
injection of RgIA4 prevented chemotherapy-induced cold allody-
nia in wild-type mice but not the transient and attenuated cold
allodynia in α9 KO mice.
Discussion
The results of this study demonstrate that the α9α10 nAChR is a
valid molecular target for drug development. Using a chemo-
therapy-induced animal model of pain, we have shown that when
α9α10 nAChR function is inhibited, either by pharmacological
manipulation or by genetic manipulation, the expression of neu-
ropathic pain is attenuated. We eliminated α9α10 nAChR function
genetically using α9 KO mice. The pharmacological blocker de-
veloped for this study was RgIA4, an analog of α-conotoxin RgIA,
a native peptide expressed in cone snail venom. The analog has
been extensively characterized: It has high affinity for both rodent
and human α9α10 nAChRs (in contrast to the native venom
peptide, which has low affinity for the human receptor), and is
highly selective (>103-fold) for the α9α10 nAChRs vs. all other
tested receptors, including opioid and GABAB receptors.
The well-characterized rodent model of oxaliplatin-induced
neuropathy was used to assess the effects of blockade of α9α10
nAChRs. Oxaliplatin is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for
colorectal cancer and also is used to treat pancreatic, gastric, and
testicular cancers (27, 28). It is an organoplatinum complex that
is thought to produce cytotoxicity via the formation of DNA
adducts that interfere with DNA replication and transcription,
leading to the induction of apoptosis. Neurotoxicity is dose-
dependent, and symptoms (typically, increased sensitivity to
cold) often continue to worsen for several months after com-
pleting chemotherapy, suggesting an ongoing disease process
(26). There are currently no agents approved for prevention of
the chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, often leaving
clinicians to decrease the dose or duration of the medication
treatment, thus diminishing the effectiveness of the intended
cancer therapy (29).
The results of the present study establish a key role for the
α9α10 nAChR in the progression of chemotherapy-induced
neuropathic pain. This conclusion is illustrated in Fig. 5, which
summarizes the 72-h time points obtained in the experiment with
wild-type and α9-KO mice described in Results (also Fig. 4).
These data indicate that oxaliplatin produces an increasing se-
verity of cold sensitivity, similar to the syndrome observed in
human chemotherapy patients. The cold allodynia, assessed in
rodents by paw withdrawal latency, becomes more intense with
successive doses of oxaliplatin; in contrast, the cold allodynia is
not observed if RgIA4 is injected concurrently with oxaliplatin
administration or if the experiment is carried out on α9 KO mice.
The extended duration (24–72 h) of efficacy of RgIA4 in the
rodent model is remarkable, in that RgIA4 is rapidly metabo-
lized in vivo; the plasma half-life in rodents is less than 20 min.*
The analgesia data shown in Figs. 3 and 5 are 24-h and 72-h
points, respectively; the lack of detectable cold allodynia suggests

 that application of RgIA4 may have disease-modifying effects.
Because of the high specificity of RgIA4 for the α9α10 nAChR, it
is reasonable to conclude that the absence of cold allodynia is a
direct consequence of α9α10 nAChR inhibition. The results
obtained using α9 KO mice are consistent with this mechanism.
Thus, this nAChR subtype appears to play a key signaling role in
preventing a pathological pain state.
Blockade of the α9α10 nAChR did not appear to be analgesic
per se (i.e., the baseline thresholds were not elevated). Thus, the
utility of the mechanism of action is appropriate for prevention
of chronic pain, such as in cancer chemotherapy and, as detailed
in a previous study, in prevention of development of trauma-
induced neuropathic pain (13). However, acute pain (e.g., acute
surgical pain) may not be affected. Nevertheless, single doses of
other conotoxins that block α9α10 nAChRs produce analgesia in
models of established neuropathic pain, including CCI and
partial sciatic nerve ligation, suggesting that this mechanism may
also have utility in these settings (8, 9, 24).
The occurrence of a species affinity gap between homologous
human and rodent molecular targets is a potentially important
general issue in drug development, particularly if the molecular
target has not been identified. Preclinical pain studies are most
often carried out on rodent models, and a large affinity gap could
lead to failure to demonstrate efficacy in human clinical trials (such
as was observed for Vc1.1). For the present studies, α-conotoxin
RgIA, a venom peptide from C. regius, was used as a template for
engineering highly selective peptide antagonists of α9α10 nAChRs.
The final analog, RgIA4, has high affinity (low nanomolar) for
both the human and rodent α9α10 nAChR; RgIA4 retains high
selectivity, with no activity detected on the GABAB receptor. Low
affinity for the rodent receptor can also be problematic. Lead
compounds with high affinity only for human transient receptor
potential (TRP) channels were abandoned as analgesic drug leads
because the low affinity for rodent TRP channels precluded vali-
dation using animal models of pain (30, 31). Because the α-con-
otoxin RgIA analogs developed in the current study have high
affinity for both human and rodent α9α10 nAChRs, they are useful
both for mechanistic studies using rodent models of pain as well as
for potential drug leads for human therapy. The specific peptide
chosen for the animal studies, although not the most potent analog
on the human receptor, was the most selective, and was therefore
suitable for assessing the role of α9α10 nAChRs. The approach we
used to obtain selective analogs of native RgIA that also addressed
the affinity gap between rodent and human α9α10 nAChRs pro-
vides a paradigm that should be generally applicable whenever
species-specific differences in affinity exist.
The α9α10 nAChR represents a mechanistically distinctive
target for modifying the disease course of chronic pain. Presently
available pain medications act on a limited number of pharma-
cological targets that treat, but do not prevent, disease pro-
gression. Commonly used medications include opioids, COX
inhibitors, N-type CaV channel blockers, and catecholamine
reuptake inhibitors. Each of these medications generally pro-
vides only partial pain relief. For treatment of severe chronic
pain, medications from multiple classes are often required, and
despite combination therapy, millions of patients worldwide are
left to suffer from treatment-resistant symptoms. Whereas
morphine and opioid derivatives are the gold standard for the
treatment of moderate to severe acute pain, long-term use is
problematic. Opioid tolerance rapidly develops, leading to the
need for dose increases to obtain the same analgesic effect (32).
RgIA4 lacks activity at opioid receptors, and multiple doses of
RgIA4, rather than causing tolerance, produced gradual and
sustained pain relief. Whether the short course of treatment
produces permanent beneficial effects requires further study.
Conus venoms have been a rich source of peptides that target
neuronal receptors and ion channels. The ω-conotoxin MVIIA
(ziconotide) from the fish-eating Conus magus was approved for
treatment-refractory severe chronic pain, such as in patients with
cancer or AIDS. Ziconotide is a positively charged peptide that
does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier and, consequently,
must be delivered intrathecally to produce its centrally acting
effects (5). RgIA4 differs substantially from ω-conotoxin MVIIA
in structure (two vs. three disulfide loops), function (nAChR
antagonist vs. CaV channel antagonist), effective route of admin-
istration (s.c. vs. intrathecal), and side-effect profile (no neuro-
logical effects in Irwin testing for RgIA4 vs. 25% or more of
patients receiving ziconotide reporting dizziness, nausea, confu-
sion, somnolence, or nystagmus) (33).
The pathophysiology of oxaliplatin-induced chronic pain remains
poorly understood. T cells and macrophages infiltrate damaged
neuronal tissue, and neuroimmune-mediated mechanisms may play
a role in disease progression (34, 35). Although the tissue target of
RgIA4 is unknown, it is noteworthy that the parent compound,
RgIA, reduces neural immune cell accumulation (T cells, macro-
phages, and acetylcholine-synthesizing lymphocytes) after CCI (9,
13). The α9 and α10 subunit transcripts have been identified in
immune cells, including lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes
(36). It has also recently been shown that functional α9α10 nAChRs
regulate ATP-dependent cytokine release in monocytes (37) and
that α9-containing nAChRs modify the function of proinflammatory
monocytes (38). The α9-containing nAChRs also modulate the in-
flux of monocytes and neutrophils in experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis, a murine model of multiple sclerosis (39, 40).
Thus, it is possible that the restorative properties of RgIA4 are re-
lated to neuroprotective modulation of immune function.
An additional indication that inhibition of α9α10 nAChRs may be
disease-modifying comes from studies of the parent compound,
RgIA, in rats that have undergone CCI of the sciatic nerve. Mor-
phological analysis indicates that RgIA administration prevents
CCI-induced decreases of axon diameter, loss of myelin sheath, and
decreases in fiber number (13). In addition, CCI causes secondary
pathological changes along the ascending pain pathway, including
edema and infiltration of macrophages in dorsal root ganglia
(DRG) and activation of microglia and astrocytes in the dorsal horn
of the spinal cord. RgIA administration also prevents these as-
cending pathway pathologies, indicating protective effects against
disease progression (13). Additionally, another conotoxin that
preferentially inhibits the α9α10 receptor, Vc1.1, was previously
shown (41) to prevent neuropathic pain in a rodent model of di-
abetes. In humans, chronic neuropathic pain is a highly prevalent
complication of diabetes. Established neuropathy is irreversible,
even after subsequent improvements in metabolic parameters (42).
Remarkably, the analgesic effects of Vc1.1 persisted for 10 d after
cessation of Vc1.1 administration, consistent with a disease-modi-
fying effect (41).
Thus, compounds that have a pharmacological profile that in-
cludes α9α10 antagonist activity prevent or attenuate the expression
of pain in several rodent models, including neuropathic pain in-
duced by chemotherapy, traumatic nerve injury, or diabetes (8, 13,

 35, 43, 44). The results of the present study establish that it is the
blockade of the α9α10 nAChR that enables the prevention of
chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Together, these findings
strongly suggest that there is a common molecular pathway in-
volved in the expression of pain following a diverse array of trig-
gering insults, a pathway that apparently includes signaling via
α9α10 nAChRs.
Materials and Methods
Conotoxin Synthesis. α-Conotoxins were synthesized using an AAPPTec Apex
396 automated peptide synthesizer as previously described (45). The peptide
masses were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-
flight mass spectrometry.

RgIA4 prevents chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain in rats.
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in rats was induced by re-
peated i.p. injection of oxaliplatin as described in Materials and Methods.
Control animals were treated with vehicle. RgIA4 was dissolved in saline and
injected s.c. daily. Withdrawal latency (A) and paw pressure (B) were used as
a measure of cold allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia, respectively. The
cold allodynia test was performed on days 8, 15, and 22 at 24 h after RgIA4
administration (A), and the mechanical hyperalgesia test was performed at
1-wk time points 30 min (B) and 24 h (C) after RgIA4 administration. Values
are expressed as the mean ± SEM from eight rats for each experimental
determination. ***P < 0.001 significantly different from vehicle.

 Two-Electrode Voltage-Clamp Recording. Xenopus laevis oocytes were used to
express cloned rat or human nAChR subtypes heterologously. Recordings
were made 1–5 d postinjection. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at −70 mV at
room temperature and exposed to acetylcholine, RgIA, or analogs as de-
scribed previously (20).
Receptor Pharmacology. Synthetic RgIA4 was tested on non-nAChRs by the
National Institute of Mental Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program
using previously described methods (46–48). Compounds were initially
tested in quadruplicate at 10 μM in primary binding assays. Compounds
that blocked more than 50% of the radioligand binding were then tested
in secondary binding assays to determine a concentration–response
curve. Patch-clamp electrophysiology was used for assessing the human
ether-a-go-go–related
gene
(hERG)
function
(48).
Gi-coupled
cAMP
modulation was assessed in CHO-K1 cells expressing GABAB1a/B2 with Gi/o
coupling; assays were performed by DiscoverX. Compounds were in-
cubated with cells for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 15 μM forskolin,
and cellular cAMP was detected using the HitHunter cAMP XS assay de-
tection method according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Effects were
calculated as a percentage of maximal GABA effect (GABA EC50 = 188
nM). Values were obtained in duplicate, and the experiment was re-
peated once. In a separate experiment, cellular dialectric spectroscopy
(49) was used to assay changes in electrical impedance in CHO cells
expressing human GABAB1a/B2 (50). Values were obtained in duplicate.
The assay was performed by Eurofins Cerep according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol. Compounds were incubated with cells for 10 min at
28 °C. Cellular agonist effect was calculated as a percentage of 100 μM
3-aminopropyl(methyl)phosphinic acid agonist control.
Animals. All experimental procedures on animals were performed in ac-
cordance with the NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory an-
imals and were performed under Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees’ approved protocols at the University of Utah, University of
Florence, A. T. Still University Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine,
or Kineta, Inc. Male or female Sprague–Dawley rats, weighing ∼200–250
g at the beginning of the experimental procedures, were used. Wild-type
mice were CBA/CaJ (The Jackson Laboratory). Germline α9 KO mice (28),
originally on a 129Sv/Ev and CBA/CaJ background, were crossed using an
accelerated backcrossing program (The Jackson Laboratory) until 99.5%
identity with wild-type CBA/CaJ mice was achieved. Mice were then fur-
ther backcrossed with wild-type CBA/CAJ mice for an additional three
generations. Experiments involving animals have been reported accord-
ing to Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE)
guidelines (51). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and
to reduce the number of animals used.
Irwin Test. A modified Irwin screen was used to test the potential adverse
behavioral, neurological, and autonomic effects of RgIA4 treatment. Groups
of two to three rats (Charles River Laboratories) were used. Two independent
blinded studies were conducted, each with a different route of administra-
tion, RgIA4 concentration, adverse effect readouts, and times of assessments.
In one study, RgIA4 was administered s.c. at a concentration of 5 mg/kg.
Observations were conducted at 0, 0.25, and 2 h postdosing. In a second study,
RgIA4 was administered i.m. for 14 d at a concentration of 100 μg/kg. Ob-
servations were conducted daily at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 h postdosing. Each
sign or effect was noted either for its presence or absence, or was assigned a
score ranging from 0 to 3. In this scoring scheme, 0 represents no visible
change, whereas 1 represents mild changes and 3 represents marked
changes. The animals were also observed for vehicle- or compound-induced
mortality during the observation period.
Voltage-Dependent Calcium Current Recording in Rat DRG Neurons. L4 and L5
DRG neurons were isolated from Sprague–Dawley rats, enzymatically dis-
sociated, plated onto polylysine-coated glass coverslips, and maintained
overnight at 37 °C in a 5% (vol/vol) CO2 incubator in minimum essential media
with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (52). DRG neurons were recorded
in a solution containing 145 mM N-methyl-D-glucosamine (NMG)•Cl, 5 mM
BaCl2, 10 mM Na•Hepes, and 5 mM glucose, with pH 7.4 and osmolarity of
320 mOsm. The pipet solution contained 104 mM NMG•Cl, 14 mM creatine•PO4,
6 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NMG•Hepes, 5 mM Tris•ATP, 10 mM NMG2•EGTA, and
0.3 mM Tris2•GTP with pH 7.4 and osmolarity of 300 mOsm. Test solutions were
applied, and ionic currents were recorded and analyzed as previously described
(24, 53). Recordings were carried out at room temperature, and the holding
potential was −80 mV. Group data were calculated as the mean ± SD, and
Student’s t test was used to determine significant differences (P < 0.05).
Oxaliplatin-Induced Neuropathic Pain in Rats. Neuropathy in rats (Harlan) was
induced as described by Cavaletti et al. (54). Briefly, rats were treated with
2.4 mg/kg i.p. oxaliplatin (Sequoia Research Products) for 5 consecutive days
every week for 3 wk (15 i.p. injections). Throughout the study period, ex-
perimenters were blinded as to the identity of the injected compounds. Data
were analyzed with one-way ANOVA using Dunnett’s multiple comparison
test (GraphPad Prism).
Rat Cold Plate Test. As previously described (55), rats were placed in a
stainless steel box (12 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm) with a cold plate as the floor. The
temperature of the cold plate was kept constant at 4 ± 1 °C. Pain-related
behaviors (i.e., lifting and licking of the hind paw) were observed, and the
time of the first sign was recorded. The cutoff time of the latency of paw
lifting or licking was set at 60 s.
Rat Paw Pressure Test. The nociceptive threshold in the rat was determined
with an analgesimeter (Ugo Basile) as previously described (56). Briefly, a
constantly increasing pressure was applied to a small area of the dorsal
surface of the hind paw using a blunt conical probe. Mechanical pressure
was increased until vocalization or a withdrawal reflex occurred. Vocaliza-
tion or withdrawal reflex thresholds were expressed in grams. For analgesia
measures, mechanical pressure application was stopped at 120 g.
Oxaliplatin-Induced Neuropathic Pain in Mice. Oxaliplatin (MedChem Express)
was dissolved at 0.6 μg/μL in 0.9% NaCl. RgIA4 was dissolved at 0.01 μg/μL in
0.9% NaCl. For each experiment, mice were divided into four equally sized
groups (n = 7–9 animals) and injected with saline (i.p.) + saline (s.c.), saline
(i.p.) + RgIA4 (40 μg/kg, s.c.), oxaliplatin (2.4 mg/kg i.p.) + saline (s.c.), or
oxaliplatin (2.4 mg/kg, i.p.) + RgIA4 (40 μg/kg, s.c.).
In the first study, mice were injected once per day on Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday, and again on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday,
mice were tested before injection (24-h time point) and 30 min after injection.
This pattern was repeated for an additional 2 wk. In the second set of ex-
periments, mice were injected once per day on Monday through Friday and
tested on Monday before injection (72-h time point). This pattern was re-
peated for an additional 2 wk.
For mice, testing was conducted using a cold-plate test chamber (IITC, Inc. Life
Science). Animals were allowed to acclimate in the chamber at room temperature
(23 °C) for 5 min. Temperature was then lowered at a rate of 10 °C per minute.
Fig. 5.
RgIA4 and α9 KO prevent chronic cold allodynia. Repeated oxali-
platin injection induces progressive cold allodynia in wild-type mice. Cold
allodynia is not detected 72 h after oxaliplatin administration either in wild-
type mice that received RgIA4 or in α9 KO mice (additional details are pro-
vided in Fig. 4). Data shown are 72 h after the last injection. The control was
i.p. saline administered five times per week + s.c. saline administered five
times per week (vehicle/vehicle) at the indicated time points; i.p. oxaliplatin
was administered five times per week; and s.c. saline or RgIA4 was admin-
istered five times per week. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 significantly different from
vehicle/vehicle controls at indicated time points for respective genotypes.
