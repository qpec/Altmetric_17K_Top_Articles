There is an important medical need for new antifungal agents
with novel mechanisms of action to treat the increasing number of
patients with life-threatening systemic fungal disease and to
overcome the growing problem of resistance to current therapies.
F901318, the leading representative of a novel class of drug, the
orotomides, is an antifungal drug in clinical development that
demonstrates excellent potency against a broad range of dimorphic
and filamentous fungi. In vitro susceptibility testing of F901318 against
more than 100 strains from the four main pathogenic Aspergillus
spp. revealed minimal inhibitory concentrations of ≤0.06 μg/mL—
greater potency than the leading antifungal classes. An investiga-
tion into the mechanism of action of F901318 found that it acts via
inhibition of the pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase (DHODH) in a fungal-specific manner. Homology
modeling of Aspergillus fumigatus DHODH has identified a pre-
dicted binding mode of the inhibitor and important interacting
amino acid residues. In a murine pulmonary model of aspergillosis,
F901318 displays in vivo efficacy against a strain of A. fumigatus
sensitive to the azole class of antifungals and a strain displaying
an azole-resistant phenotype. F901318 is currently in late Phase 1
clinical trials, offering hope that the antifungal armamentarium
can be expanded to include a class of agent with a mechanism
of action distinct from currently marketed antifungals.

A
recent estimate puts the annual death toll from serious fungal
infections at 1.5 million (1). As one of the four greatest killers,
Aspergillus species are opportunistic human pathogens, particularly
affecting immunocompromised persons, such as transplant recipi-
ents and those with hematologic malignancies. Invasive aspergillosis
has a high mortality (30–90%) and is estimated to affect more than
200,000 people annually. Other diseases caused by Aspergillus spe-
cies, including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (2) and
chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (3), have a significant global impact,
affecting millions of patients.
There has been a dearth of new drug classes developed to treat
systemic fungal infections arriving in the clinic, with the most recent
being the echinocandins, introduced in 2001. Only three other
classes of antifungal drugs are currently available for the treatment
of invasive fungal disease: polyenes (amphotericin B), azoles (e.g.,
voriconazole, posaconazole, and the recently licensed isavucona-
zole), and flucytosine (4). These agents work via a limited range of
cellular targets. Echinocandins, such as caspofungin, inhibit β-(1,3)-
glucan synthase, exploiting the most striking difference between the
fungal cell and its human counterpart—the cell wall. Two antifungal
drug classes target the cell membrane: azoles inhibit ergosterol
biosynthesis, and polyenes disrupt fungal membranes via ergosterol
binding. Flucytosine is a pyrimidine analog, converted to 5-fluoro-
uracil within fungal cells, that disrupts DNA and RNA synthesis;
however, owing to rapid development of resistance, it is used pri-
marily in combination therapy.
Issues exist with current therapies, including overt toxicity, drug–
drug interactions, variable pharmacokinetics, and increasing levels
of drug resistance (5, 6). In particular, the development of resis-
tance to the azole class of antifungals is concerning, because they
are currently the sole orally available antifungal agent for the
treatment of aspergillosis (7). Azole-resistant clinical isolates of
Aspergillus fumigatus have been observed and isolated from patients
worldwide, including Europe, the United States, Asia, Africa,
Australia, and the Middle East (8, 9). Apparently exacerbated by
the environmental use of azole fungicides in agriculture (10),
reported rates of azole resistance have approached 30% at certain
sites in Europe, with rates outside Europe varying between 0.6%
and 11.2% (9).
Results
Discovery of F901318. With the aim of identifying new antifungal
chemistries, a library of 340,292 small molecules was screened
in vitro against A. fumigatus, and multiple chemical series with
antifungal activity were identified. The initial hits in one such
series, originally termed the “F3 series,” were developed by a
medicinal chemistry program that was driven by classical struc-
ture–activity relationships based on in vitro activity. This series
was characterized by excellent in vitro potency against Aspergillus
spp., but was devoid of activity against Candida spp. This unusual
Significance
New antifungal drugs that act via novel mechanisms are ur-
gently needed to combat the high mortality of invasive fungal
disease and the emergence of resistance to existing therapies.
We describe the discovery, structure, activity, and mechanism
of action of F901318, a new antifungal agent. A member of a
novel class of antifungals, the orotomides, F901318 acts via
inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of de
novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. F901318 is currently in clinical
development for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

 pattern perhaps explains why similar chemicals have not been found
previously. Typically, antifungal screens have depended on first finding
activity against Candida. Modifications to improve physicochemical
properties, antifungal potency, pharmacokinetics, ADMET (absorp-
tion, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties,
in vivo efficacy in infection models, and toxicology have led to the
development of F901318 (Fig. 1). Antifungal susceptibility testing of
F901318 using standardized techniques demonstrated its potent ac-
tivities against clinical isolates of aspergilli, with minimum inhib-
itory concentrations (MICs) of <0.1 μg/mL against multiple strains of
A. fumigatus, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus fla-
vus, including isolates resistant to other antifungal agents (Table 1).
Mechanism of Action Screen. Initially, owing to the method of dis-
covery, the mechanism of action of this series was unknown. A
combination of microbiological, genetic, and biochemical ap-
proaches were used to identify the target of this drug series. A
genetic screen, similar to a multicopy suppressor screen, was per-
formed to identify genes that, when present in multiple copies,
provided resistance to F901318. This approach was previously val-
idated for the antifungal drugs itraconazole and terbinafine, by
demonstrating that the presence of additional copies of cytochrome
P450 C-14 lanosterol α-demethylase and squalene epoxidase, re-
spectively, led to resistance to those agents (11, 12). In the present
study, Aspergillus nidulans spores that had been transformed with an
A. nidulans genomic library carried by the autonomously replicat-
ing plasmid pAMA1 were exposed to F901318. Four independent
resistant clones were obtained, pAMA1 DNA was isolated, and the
genomic DNA insert was sequenced. All resistant clones contained
inserts that mapped to the same region of chromosome I (Fig. S1A).
Although sequence data from five genes was retrieved, only one
gene—ANIA_05909—was intact in all four genomic fragments.
This gene, named pyrE in Aspergillus spp., encodes the pyrimidine
biosynthesis enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH;
EC 1.3.5.2).
To confirm that extra copies of pyrE led to F901318 resistance,
the recovered plasmid pAMA1_18.1 was treated with a bacterial
transposon (Tn5) to disrupt either pyrE or a neighboring gene,
ANIA_05910, and the resulting plasmids were transformed
into A. nidulans. Strains carrying the intact pAMA1_18.1 or the
ANIA_05910 disruptant exhibited resistance to F901318; how-
ever, on disruption of pyrE, the strain returned to wild-type (WT)
levels of susceptibility to F901318 (Fig. S1B). This finding con-
firmed that extra copies of the gene encoding DHODH were re-
sponsible for the resistance to F901318, implicating DHODH as
the target of the drug.
DHODH Is the Target of F901318. DHODH is an oxidoreductase that
catalyzes the fourth step of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway
(Fig. S2), the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate. Confirma-
tion that the drug disrupts pyrimidine biosynthesis was obtained
after the addition of exogenous pyrimidines (uridine and uracil) to
the media during susceptibility testing. A reversal of the antifungal
effect of F901318 on A. fumigatus was observed, but only at mil-
limolar concentrations of pyrimidines (5 mM and above; Fig. S3).
Interestingly, human serum contains low levels of pyrimidines, es-
timated to be ∼15 μM (13), which are insufficient to reverse
the effect of F901318 on A. fumigatus in vivo. Indeed, mutants of
A. fumigatus (14), Candida albicans (15), Histoplasma capsulatum
(16), and Cryptococcus neoformans (17), which are disrupted in
pyrimidine biosynthesis, have exhibited attenuated virulence in
animal models of infection, indicating that targeting pyrimidine
synthesis is a valid antifungal strategy.
Biochemical evidence confirming that the target of F901318
was DHODH was obtained from in vitro enzyme assays that
were set up with recombinant A. fumigatus DHODH using 2,6-
dichloroindophenol as a redox indicator. F901318 inhibited
A. fumigatus DHODH in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of
44 ± 10 nM (n = 11; Fig. 2). DHODH is also present in mammals,
although there is a low overall identity to Aspergillus DHODH (∼30%;
Fig. S4). A known inhibitor of human DHODH, teriflunomide
(18), which is used to treat multiple sclerosis in man, did not in-
hibit A. fumigatus DHODH in vitro. Species selectivity of F901318
was confirmed in an assay in which little inhibition of human
DHODH was observed, whereas teriflunomide inhibited human
DHODH, as expected. In fact, the IC50 value for F901318 against
human DHODH was not reached at 100 μM, the highest con-
centration used in these experiments, indicating that F901318 was

 >2,200-fold more potent against the A. fumigatus enzyme. Thus,
fungal DHODH was confirmed as the target of F901318, and
despite the presence of a mammalian version of the enzyme,
no target-based toxicity was predicted. On elucidation of the
mechanism of action, the F3 series was renamed the orotomides,
combining the mechanism (dihydroorotate) with the chemistry (α-
ketoamide).
Further enzyme kinetic experiments revealed that F901318 is a
reversible inhibitor of A. fumigatus DHODH (Fig. S5A) and is a
competitive inhibitor with respect to the ubiquinone (coenzyme Q)
cofactor, which functions as an electron acceptor in the reaction
(Fig. S5B). This latter property is perhaps not unexpected, given
that structural studies have shown that known inhibitors of human
DHODH (teriflunomide and brequinar) (19) and the Plasmodium
falciparum enzyme (DSM265) (20) bind in a region of the protein
predicted to be a channel through which the ubiquinone enters the
molecule from the inner mitochondrial membrane.
Structural Insights of F901318 Binding to A. fumigatus DHODH. In the
absence of a crystal structure, we investigated the binding of
F901318 to A. fumigatus DHODH by creating a homology model
of A. fumigatus DHODH (Fig. S6) using the structural information
provided by other class 2 DHODH enzymes, including the structure
of human DHODH (19). F901318 and other members of the series
were used to identify a likely binding mode. Key residues for
binding were identified (Fig. 3A). Validation of the importance of
two of these residues was obtained by mutagenesis of C. albicans
DHODH. The WT C. albicans DHODH was not inhibited by
F901318, but mutation of two residues, Phe162 and Val171, to the
residues predicted to occupy the same positions in the A. fumigatus
enzyme, Val200 and Met209, respectively, created a mutant C. albi-
cans DHODH that was inhibited by F901318 (Fig. 3B). The IC50 of
the mutant C. albicans_V162_M171 was still ∼40-fold higher than
the IC50 of F901318 against the A. fumigatus enzyme, indicating the
existence of other important differences in DHODH between the
two species; however, both of these residues are clearly important
for inhibition. These data, along with the observed competition
between F901318 and coenzyme Q in the in vitro assay, suggest that
the orotomides bind in the “quinone channel,” where ubiquinone
enters the enzyme from the inner mitochondrial membrane,
preventing reoxidation of the dihydroflavin mononucleotide
(FMNH2) cofactor essential for the reaction to proceed (Fig. S2).
Spectrum, Resistance, and in Vivo Efficacy of F901318. Although we
observed no activity against Candida spp. and the zygomycetes in
antifungal susceptibility testing, F901318 displayed excellent
potency against a broad range of pathogenic filamentous and
dimorphic fungi, including Penicillium spp., Coccidiodes immitis,
H. capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Fusarium spp., and the
difficult-to-treat Scedosporium spp. This spectrum appears to be
sequence-driven, given that the sensitive organisms were found
to be grouped together in a phylogenetic analysis of DHODH
(Fig. S7). This finding is consistent with observations that other
DHODH inhibitors exhibit specificity of action owing to interspe-
cies variations in the architecture of the hydrophobic channel in
which the inhibitors are predicted to bind (19–21). Thus, the unique
spectrum of F901318 is a reflection of the structure of the target,
DHODH, and the binding mode of the orotomides.
We investigated the resistance to F901318 in A. fumigatus by
repeated exposure to a concentration gradient of the drug on an
agar plate and selection from the margins of growth. This was
carried out for 50 passages, with no change in the MIC observed
for the first 40 passages and only a modest increase thereafter
(Fig. S8). In contrast, voriconazole exhibited an increase in the MIC
between 10 and 15 passages. Based on these results, it appears that
F901318 resistance is not easily induced in A. fumigatus.
Pharmacokinetic studies in mice have identified good distri-
bution of F901318 to tissues including the kidney, liver, and lung,
with detection in the brain, albeit at lower levels, suggesting that
the drug reaches key sites of infection. The efficacy of F901318
was demonstrated in a neutropenic murine model of invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis. After infection with a well-characterized
A. fumigatus strain (NIH 4215), survival was significantly improved
by F901318 treatment (Fig. 4A). Treatment with the triazole
drug posaconazole also increased survival after infection with
this strain.
Mutations in the gene encoding the target molecule of the
azole class of antifungal drugs, Cyp51A, that cause resistance have
been identified. Several azole-resistant strains of A. fumigatus carry
a combination of a tandem repeat in the promoter and a point

 mutation in the coding sequence. One such strain, A. fumigatus
F16216, carrying the TR34/L98H mutation of Cyp51A, has proven
to be resistant to multiple azole drugs, including itraconazole, vor-
iconazole, and posaconazole (22). In vitro, A. fumigatus F16216
displayed no resistance to F901318, with an MIC of 0.03 μg/mL,
which is comparable to the data presented in Table 1. In vivo, in the
pulmonary aspergillosis model, A. fumigatus F16216 caused an in-
fection that cannot be treated with posaconazole (Fig. 4B); how-
ever, F901318 therapy led to a significant increase in survival in this
severe model, demonstrating that the different mechanism of action
of the orotomides enables F901318 to overcome azole resistance
caused by Cyp51A mutations.
Preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicology studies of F901318
have supported the progression and evaluation of this antifungal in
Phase 1 oral and i.v. single and repeated dose trials.
Discussion
As highlighted by Denning and Bromley (23), the antifungal
pipeline has failed to produce new antifungal drugs with mech-
anisms of action different from those of existing classes in the
years since caspofungin was licensed in 2001. Many potential
antifungal targets have been investigated, but translating these
early stage projects into clinical candidates has proven elusive.
This difficulty has mirrored the issues with target-based screen-
ing encountered in the antibacterial arena (24). In fact, a review
of new mechanism, first-in-class medicines approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration between 1999 and 2008 revealed
that target-based screens were responsible for the discovery of
only 3 of 10 drugs for infectious disease, with the majority dis-
covered by phenotypic screening (i.e., “whole-cell screens” for
antibiotics/antifungals) (25). The orotomides were discovered via
a whole-cell screening approach, providing hits that were known
to have antifungal activity from the start, but with no knowledge
of mechanism of action. This classical approach was coupled
with a genetic screen to identify the target of the drug, DHODH.
A recent review of antifungal drug discovery suggested that sim-
ilar approaches, taking advantage of genetic tools such as hap-
loinsufficiency strain collections and new technologies such as
next-generation sequencing, may accelerate the translation of
antifungal chemistries toward the clinic (26).
Pyrimidines are essential to the cell, not just for the synthesis of
DNA and RNA, but also for the formation of precursors for lipid

 UDP-glucose for β-(1,3)-glucan synthesis. Pyrimidines are synthe-
sized in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (Fig. S2), in
which DHODH is a key enzyme, but they also can be scavenged by
fungi from the environment via the salvage pathway. The pyrimi-
dine salvage pathway appears to be inefficient for A. fumigatus,
however (Fig. S3). In animal models of infection, pyrimidine bio-
synthesis mutants from several pathogenic fungi are highly attenu-
ated for virulence, including studies on A. fumigatus (14), C. albicans
(15), H. capsulatum (16), and C. neoformans (17). In Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, a ura3 deletion strain lacking the orotidine-5′-phosphate
(OMP) decarboxylase enzyme of pyrimidine biosynthesis was un-
able to survive in vivo, exhibiting a decrease in the competitive index
versus a WT or reconstituted strain observed after just 4 h (27). In
C. albicans, URA3 has been commonly used as a selectable marker,
but concerns have been raised that in some virulence studies, the
ectopic expression of URA3, leading to reduced OMP decarbox-
ylase activity, had a greater effect on virulence compared with the
disruption of the target gene of interest (28). Thus, the evidence in
the literature supports the targeting of pyrimidine biosynthesis as a
valid antifungal strategy.
Identifying DHODH as the target of the orotomides has helped
explain the spectrum of antifungal activity that we observed. F901318
has activity against numerous pathogenic filamentous and dimorphic
fungi, including Aspergillus spp., H. capsulatum, Blastomyces derma-
titides, and C. immitis, along with the difficult-to-treat Scedosporium
prolificans. These F901318-susceptible organisms group together on
the phylogenetic tree of DHODH (Fig. S7), whereas DHODH from
Candida spp., C. neoformans, and the human and Plasmodium en-
zymes are more distantly related while still classified as class 2
DHODH enzymes. DHODH from the zygomycota, such as Rhizo-
pus and Mucor, align more closely with class 1A DHODHs, cytosolic
enzymes that occur in Gram-positive bacteria and the trypanosma-
tids that use alternative cofactors, such as fumarate.
DHODH has been suggested as a target for therapy in multiple
diverse disease areas, including oncology, rheumatoid arthritis,
multiple sclerosis, and infectious diseases caused by such agents as
Plasmodium, bacteria, and viruses (21, 29). There are currently two
marketed agents that have activity against human DHODH: leflu-
nomide for rheumatoid arthritis and teriflunomide for multiple
sclerosis. DSM265 is an antimalarial drug targeting plasmodial
DHODH that is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials (20); however, to
our knowledge, no other human antifungal therapies have pro-
gressed with DHODH as a target.
Although at first consideration, the breadth of therapeutic
areas for which DHODH has been proposed as a drug target is
surprising, in each case limiting the pool of pyrimidines prevents
proliferation of a population of cells. In some cases, the host cells
are targeted, such as lymphocytes in autoimmune diseases and
proliferating cancerous cells in oncology. Alternatively, the
DHODH of invading pathogens is targeted to selectively limit
the pyrimidine pools of the infective agent. Between these two ef-
fects, antiviral action has been reported for human DHODH inhib-
itors, given that viruses require host pyrimidines for replication (29).
In conclusion, to combat the increasing problem of resistance
to existing antifungal therapies, the discovery of new cellular
targets for antifungals, along with viable chemistry against these
new targets (23), is vitally important. F901318 is an antifungal
drug, currently in both intravenous and oral Phase 1 clinical trials
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02142153, NCT02342574,
NCT02394483, and NCT02737371), that acts via inhibition of the
pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme DHODH, validating an alternative
target for antifungal drug discovery.
Materials and Methods
Primers. The sequences of the primers used in this work are listed in Table S1.
Primers were supplied by Eurofins MWG.
Synthesis of F901318. The 2-(1,5-dimethyl-3-phenyl-1H-pyrro-2-yl)-N-(4-[4-(5-
fluoro-pyrimidin-2-yl-piperazin-1yl]-phenyl)-2-oxo-acetamide (F901318) was
prepared as described in SI Materials and Methods.
In Vitro Antifungal Susceptibility Testing. MICs of antifungal drugs were de-
termined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
protocol M38-A2 in RPMI 1640 medium buffered to pH 7.0 with MOPS buffer
at 35 °C. For caspofungin, the minimum effective concentration (MEC) was
defined as the lowest drug concentration causing abnormal growth (i.e.,
short-branching hyphae).
Mechanism of Action Screen. An A. nidulans genomic library carried on the
pRG3-AMA1-NotI vector was obtained from the Fungal Genetic Stock Cen-
ter. Protoplasts from pyrG- strains of A. nidulans (A767) were transformed
with the genomic library by PEG-mediated transformation. Transformants
were exposed to lethal concentrations of F901318 on Vogel’s minimal agar
(30). Plasmid DNA was extracted from resistant colonies and sequenced.
DHODH Assays. These assays were carried out using recombinant DHODH
prepared from A. fumigatus cDNA, C. albicans gDNA, or, for the human
protein, IMAGE clone 6064723 (Geneservice Ltd.) cloned into the vector
pET44 (Novagen) minus the N-terminal 88 (A. fumigatus), 56 (C. albicans), or
28 (human) amino acids. For C. albicans, CTG-encoded serines were mutated

In vivo efficacy of F901318 in a murine model of A. fumigatus in-
fection. Groups of 10 immunosuppressed mice were infected intranasally
with A. fumigatus NIH 4215 (A) or the azole-resistant A. fumigatus F16216
(B) conidia on day 0. Treatment with F901318 (15 mg/kg i.v., three times
daily; blue circles), posaconazole (7.5 mg/kg orally, once daily; red triangles),
or control (green squares) was initiated at 6 h postinfection. Kaplan–Meier
curves of surviving mice in each group were plotted. After infection with
NIH 4215, F901318 treatment significantly improved survival compared
with controls (P < 0.001, Mantel–Haenszel test). After infection with
F16216, F901318 treatment significantly improved survival compared with
controls (P < 0.001) and compared with posaconazole treatment (P <
0.005).

MICROBIOLOGY
 to TCG. Further mutations altered Phe162 and Val171 to become Val and Met
to create the mutant protein C. albicans_V162_M171. Primers are listed in
Table S1, and further methodological details are provided in SI Materials and
Methods. The assay was conducted as described elsewhere (31).
Homology Modeling of A. fumigatus DHODH. Human DHODH [Protein Data
Bank (PDB) ID code 1D3G] served as the protein template for construction of
the A. fumigatus DHODH model. Other DHODH structures from human (PDB
ID codes 1PRH, 2PRL, 2PRM, 3G0X, 3KVM, 2WV8, and 2FQI), rat (PDB ID
codes 1UUM and 1UUO), Trypanosoma cruzi (PDB ID code 2E68), P. falciparum
(PDB ID codes 3I68, 1ITV, and 3O8A) Leishmania major (PDB ID code 3MJY),
and Escherichia coli (PDB ID code 1F76) also informed the process. Coarse
refinement of the structure with Discovery Studio 4.1 (Accelerys) was followed
by fine refinement with XEDraw (Cresset). More details of the homol-
ogy modeling process and ligand binding are provided in SI Materials
and Methods.
Resistance Testing. A. fumigatus 210 conidia were inoculated onto Sabour-
aud agar (Oxoid) in a 9-cm Petri dish. An 8-mm-diameter circle of agar was
removed from the center of the plate to create a well. 100 μL of 500 μg/mL
drug was loaded into the well and allowed to diffuse into the agar, creating
a concentration gradient. After 4 d of incubation at 35 °C, a zone of in-
hibition was observed, and conidia were collected from the margins of
growth and then used to create the next plate. After every fifth passage, the
MIC was determined as described above.
In Vivo Efficacy Testing. All experiments were conducted under U.K. Home
Office project license 40/3630 and approved by the University of Liverpool’s
Animal Welfare Committee. Groups of 10 CD-1 mice were immunosup-
pressed with 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide i.p. at 4 d before infection and
with cyclophosphamide and 250 mg/kg cortisone acetate s.c. at 1 d before
infection. A. fumigatus F16216 carries an L98H mutation of cyp51A and a
34-bp tandem repeat in the cyp51A promoter, leading to resistance to azole
drugs (22). Conidia from this strain and from the WT A. fumigatus NIH 4215
were administered intranasally on day 0. Treatment with F901318 (15 mg/kg
i.v. three times daily) or posaconazole (7.5 mg/kg/day orally) was initiated at
6 h postinfection.
