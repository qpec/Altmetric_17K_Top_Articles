Effect of using the same vs different order for second readings of screening mammograms on rates 
29 
of breast cancer detection: A randomized clinical trial  
30 
Importance: Interpreting breast screening mammograms is a difficult repetitive task that can result 
31 
in missed cancers and false positive recalls. In the UK, two film readers independently evaluate each 
32 
mammogram to search for signs of cancer, and examine digital mammograms in batches. However, 
33 
a vigilance decrement (reduced detection rate with time on task) has been observed in similar 
34 
settings.  
35 
Objective: To determine the effect of changing the order for the second film reader of batches of 
36 
screening mammograms on rates of breast cancer detection.  
37 
Design, Setting, and Participants: A multi-centre, double-blind, cluster randomised controlled trial 
38 
conducted at 46 specialised breast screening centres from the National Health Service Breast 
39 
Screening Programme in England for 1 year, (all between 20th December 2012 and 3rd November 
40 
2014). 360 readers participated (mean 7.8 readers per centre), 186 radiologists, 143 radiography 
41 
advanced practitioners and 31 breast clinicians, all fully qualified to report mammograms in the NHS 
42 
breast screening programme. 
43 
Intervention: The two readers examined each batch of digital mammograms in the same order in 
44 
the control group and in the opposite order to one another in the intervention group. 
45 
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was cancer detection rate; secondary 
46 
outcomes were rates of recall and disagreements between readers. 
47 
Results: Among 1,194,147 women (mean age 59.3, sd 7.49) who had screening mammograms 
48 
(596642 in the intervention group; 597505 in the control group), the images were interpreted in 
49 
37,688 batches [median batch size 35 (IQR 16-46)], with each reader interpreting median 176 
50 
batches (IQR 96 to 278). After completion of all subsequent diagnostic tests, a total of 10,484 cases 
51 
of breast cancer were detected (0.88%). There was no significant difference in cancer detection rate 
52 
[5272 (0.88%) vs 5212 (0.87%), difference 0.011% points 95%CI -0.022 to 0.045], recall rate, [24681 
53 
(4.14%) vs 24894 (4.17%),  difference -0.030% points 95%CI -0.101 to 0.042) or rate of reader 
54 
disagreements [20,471 (3.43%) vs 20793 (3.48%), difference -0.048% points 95%CI -0.113 to 0.018,] 
55 
between intervention and control groups.  
56 
Conclusions and Relevance: Interpretation of batches of mammograms by qualified screening 
57 
mammography readers using a different order versus the same order for the second reading 
58 
resulted in no significant difference in rates of detection of breast cancer.

Introduction 
62 
Breast cancer screening currently detects 8.6 cancers per thousand women screened triennially 
63 
(equivalent to 18,000 cancers per year) in the UK1 and 4.2 cancers per thousand women screened 
64 
annually in the US. 2 However, another 2.9 cancers per thousand women screened in the UK 3 
65 
(equivalent to 6,030 cancers per year) 1  and 0.9 cancers per thousand women screened in the US 
66 
are detected between screening rounds in screened women. 2  These arise through cancers growing 
67 
between screening rounds, and cancers missed at screening. An additional 3.4% of women in the UK 
68 
(70,715 each year) 1 and 9.3% of women in the US 2 experience false positive recalls at each 
69 
screening round. 
70 
Interpreting screening mammograms is a difficult and repetitive visual search task, where 
71 
characteristics of cancer are disguised amongst background breast parenchyma resulting in false 
72 
positive recalls and missed cancers. In similar visual search tasks a vigilance decrement of decreasing 
73 
detection rates with time on task has been observed in a large number of psychological laboratory 
74 
experiments 4 5 for example assembly line inspection tasks, 6 airport baggage screening, 7 driving 8 
75 
piloting aeroplanes9 and operating military drones. 10 An effect similar to the vigilance decrement 
76 
has been observed when examining tests sets of x-rays including mammograms in laboratory 
77 
conditions although the phenomenon has not previously been explored in breast screening 
78 
practice.11,12 
79 
In the UK two film readers independently examine each woman’s mammograms for signs of cancer. 
80 
In this study we investigated whether there is a vigilance decrement to detect cancer in breast 
81 
screening practice, and whether changing the order in which the two experts examined the batch of 
82 
mammograms could increase the cancer detection rate, through readers experiencing peak vigilance 
83 
at differing points within the reading batch when examining different women’s mammograms. 
84

Methods 
86 
Study Design 
87 
The Changing Case Order to Optimise Patterns of Performance in Screening (CO-OPS) pragmatic 
88 
double blind cluster randomised controlled trial was designed to determine whether there is a 
89 
vigilance decrement in breast cancer screening, and whether changing the order in which the cases 
90 
are presented can increase cancer detection rate.  
91 
Ethical approval was granted by the Coventry and Warwickshire National Health Service (NHS) 
92 
Research Ethics Committee on 27 June 2012 (Reference 12/WM/0182) and written informed 
93 
consent sought from the director of breast screening at each centre. The trial protocol is provided in 
94 
supplement 1 and published elsewhere 13 and statistical analysis plan (supplement 2) was finalised 
95 
before any data were collected.  
96 
Intervention and Outcomes 
97 
The study compared two parallel groups, each split into two sub-groups to ensure blinding of the 
98 
readers. The intervention group involved the two readers reading the batch in the opposite order to 
99 
each other; one forwards, one in reverse. Hence, the two sub-groups: first reader forwards, second 
100 
reader reverse, and first reader reverse, second reader forward. The control group required the 
101 
readers to read the batch in the same order as each other; the sub-groups being either both 
102 
forwards (which is current practice) or both in reverse (to maintain the blinding of a reader to trial 
103 
group, as they would be aware that they are reading a batch in reverse). Thus each batch (cluster) 
104 
was randomised with equal probability to one of four groups.  
105 
The primary outcome was cancer detection rate, (number of women with cancer detected as a 
106 
proportion of all women screened) as this is the clinically relevant outcome of interest. Secondary 
107 
outcomes of recall rate (secondary outcome 1) and rate of disagreement between the readers 
108 
(secondary outcome 2) are designed to examine the proposed mechanism of action. The idea is that 
109 
 5 
 
reversing the order for one reader results in high vigilance states occurring for the two readers when 
110 
examining different women’s mammograms, so the cancers are detected by at least one of the 
111 
experts, as outlined in figure 1. If a reader in a high vigilance state detected a cancer missed by their 
112 
colleague in a low vigilance state, then this would lead to a disagreement between them. All 
113 
disagreements are ‘arbitrated’ either by a third reader or group of readers for the final decision of 
114 
whether to recall the woman for further tests. Assuming the arbitration process performs better 
115 
than random chance the increases in disagreements would lead to increases in recall rate and cancer 
116 
detection rate.  
117 
 
118 
Participants 
119 
Centres were recruited at radiology meetings, through local radiology, radiography and quality 
120 
assurance groups, and through direct telephone and email contact. The study comprised 46 breast 
121 
screening centres using digital mammography, each consisting of groups of between 1 and 3 
122 
hospitals sharing the same computer system for storing women’s health records. Characteristics of 
123 
breast screening centres in England which took part in the trial in comparison to those which did not 
124 
is provided in table e1. The trial ran for 1 year at each centre, with individual centres starting the 
125 
study when local consent and research and development approvals were obtained, (start dates were 
126 
all between 20th December 2012 and 4th November 2013). One centre completed only 4 months of 
127 
the study due to local technical and workforce issues. 
128 
Mammograms from women attending routine breast cancer screening at these centres during the 
129 
study period were included. These were arranged into batches of around 40 women as is standard 
130 
practice in the UK, and all mammograms taken during the study period were included in the trial, 
131 
regardless of when they were examined. Each batch contained all cases from a single mammography 
132 
acquisition machine in a single day. Informed consent was at the centre level, with consent of 
133 
individual women considered impractical for this system level intervention. In the UK women age 50 
134 
 6 
 
to 70 are invited to breast screening every 3 years, this study also includes women aged 47-49 and 
135 
71-73 participating in the age extension trial (NCT01081288), and a small proportion of older women 
136 
(2.3% of women in the trial) who self-refer as part of the programme.  Women who presented to 
137 
clinics symptomatically and for high familial risk were excluded.  
138 
All readers undergo formal training and are accredited by the NHS Breast Screening Programme. 
139 
They are required to read a minimum of 5,000 cases per year, participate in assessment clinics, 
140 
formally audit their own performance against their peers,  and maintain ongoing professional 
141 
development including participating annually in the Personal Performance in Mammographic 
142 
Screening (PERFORMS) test set.14 Each centre annually measures and reports results against targets 
143 
including recall rate, cancer detection rate, and small cancer detection rate, and continuously audits 
144 
performance through monthly review of interval cancers diagnosed symptomatically between 
145 
screening rounds, 14  and monthly checks of mammography acquisition and display equipment and 
146 
reading room background light levels.15 Each woman’s mammograms are examined by two readers 
147 
co-located in the same breast screening centre. Readers are instructed to examine the batches 
148 
independently, but can access the other reader’s decision by opening the patient records. In 16 of 
149 
the 46 centres workflow systems were designed to blind reader 2 to the decision of reader 1. All 
150 
centres used arbitration when the two readers disagreed, with 13 centres using a single 3rd reader, 
151 
and 33 centres using group consensus of 2 or more readers. 
152 
Randomisation and Blinding  
153 
The randomisation took place immediately prior to opening each batch for examination using the 
154 
Intersystems Caché $RANDOM function within the computer software that the UK National Breast 
155 
Screening Service (NBSS) uses to manage the work. After randomisation the software automatically 
156 
displayed the cases in the chosen order to the first and second reader. Readers were aware of the 
157 
reading order but were blinded to trial group. The trial statistician and the women screened were 
158 
also blinded to trial group. The unit of randomisation was a batch of mammograms, whereas the 
159 
 7 
 
unit of observation was the individual mammogram. Simple randomisation was used without 
160 
stratification or minimisation due to the large number of clusters randomised.  
161 
Data collection 
162 
The data were collected via an adaptation to the NBSS computer system, which created new tables 
163 
within the software to record data items pertaining to the trial. The outcomes for every woman 
164 
screened (including both readers’ decision, time of decision, and results of all follow-up tests 
165 
including biopsy) were added to NBSS as part of each centre’s annual reporting requirements, to 
166 
reduce missing data. The data was extracted through NBSS from each centre, exporting data in Excel 
167 
format. The datasets from each centre were merged using Excel and R [v 3.0.3 in RStudio v 
168 
0.98.501]. Cancer was defined as needle biopsy or surgery positive for ductal carcinoma in situ or 
169 
invasive cancer. Recall for further tests was taken directly from NBSS, which records this decision to 
170 
enable the follow-up appointment to be made. Disagreement was defined by examining whether 
171 
the recommendation of whether to recall differed between the first and second readers.  
172 
Sample Size 
173 
Prior to the study (year 2011-12) the breast cancer detection rate in the UK was 7.8 per thousand 
174 
women screened. 16 Three years of observational data on patterns of cancer detection with time on 
175 
task was extracted from routine records at eight breast screening centres in one English region.  This 
176 
suggested that the intervention may result in one extra cancer detected per 2000 women screened, 
177 
an increase to 8.3 per thousand women screened.  To detect such an increase required a sample size 
178 
of 501,361 women in each group, using a 5% significance level and 80% power. The trial had a 
179 
cluster design, the unit of randomisation being the batch, so the sample size needed to be inflated 
180 
by the design effect. The inter-cluster correlation coefficient was estimated to be 0.002, resulting in 
181 
a design effect of 1.09, assuming an average cluster size of 40. Hence, the total sample size required 
182 
 8 
 
was 1,093,780, which is equivalent to the annual caseload of 44 centres. There were no interim 
183 
analyses or stopping rules. 
184 
Statistical analysis 
185 
We used multivariable multilevel logistic regression to analyse factors associated with breast cancer 
186 
detection, recall and disagreement rates due to the hierarchical nature of the datasets. Analysis was 
187 
intention to treat, with those not receiving the intervention as allocated included in the analysis. 
188 
However, women lost to follow-up, technical recalls (mammograms were of insufficient quality to 
189 
read), and second screening of the same woman were excluded. A three level multilevel model for 
190 
woman screened (level 1) nested in a batch (level 2) and within a center (level 3) was specified. Four 
191 
models were constructed for each of the rates stated above. The first model, a null model without 
192 
any variable was specified to decompose the amount of variance that existed at each level, the 
193 
second model included the intervention only, the third model included adjustment for known 
194 
factors associated with cancer and recall (woman’s age and whether she had previously attended 
195 
screening) while the fourth model added the intervention to the adjusted model. All multilevel 
196 
modelling was performed using MlwiN 2.35 17 called from Stata statistical software for Windows 
197 
version 14 18 using runmlwin routine. For the multilevel logistic regression models, (iterative 
198 
generalized least squares; penalised quasi-likelihood) IGLS PQL2 estimation was used. 19 Two-tailed 
199 
tests were used, with p values <0.05 considered significant. The fixed effects (i.e. measures of 
200 
association) are presented as adjusted odds ratios with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals 
201 
(CIs). Measures of random effects included intra-cluster correlation (ICC) and median odds ratio 
202 
(MOR). 20, Merlo, #9 The ICC was calculated by the linear threshold according to the formula used by 
203 
Snijders et. al. 21 while MOR is a measure of unexplained cluster heterogeneity. Methods used for 
204 
calculating MOR have been described elsewhere 20, Merlo, #9,22. Positive Predictive Value was also 
205 
calculated in the intervention and control groups as the proportion of recalled cases in which cancer 
206 
was detected. 
207 
 9 
 
The same models were constructed for three pre-defined sub-groups: women aged under 53 (in 
208 
whom the intervention may be more effective due to higher breast density increasing the task 
209 
difficulty); the first and last 5 cases in each batch (where any difference in vigilance would be at its 
210 
maximum in the intervention group); and the first batch of the day (to examine whether the 
211 
effectiveness of the intervention may be masked by examining a number of batches in succession). 
212 
An exploratory post-hoc sub group analysis of cases which are not in the first batch of the day for 
213 
either reader used the same model structure (to investigate intervention effectiveness when readers 
214 
may be fatigued). 
215 
An exploratory post-hoc analysis to measure whether there is a vigilance decrement of decreasing 
216 
sensitivity to detect cancer with time spent on task, the position in the batch (i.e. 1st, 2nd, 3rd …) was 
217 
added as a variable to the unadjusted and adjusted models of cancer detection outlined above. For 
218 
this analysis the cancer detection rate outcome was personalised to the individual reader who first 
219 
examined the case, so the outcome had an additional requirement of being correctly identified by 
220 
the first reader for recall, as well as having cancer identified on follow-up tests. The same modelling 
221 
approach was applied to recall rate, to measure any systematic change with time on task. In this 
222 
case it was the recall rate for the first reader, rather than overall from the process that was analysed. 
223 
Further exploratory post-hoc analysis was conducted to determine whether the lack of effect of the 
224 
intervention was associated with reader 2 not being blinded to the decision of reader 1 at some trial 
225 
centres. Including only the sub-group of centres in which reader 2 was blinded to the decision of 
226 
reader 1, cancer detection rates and recall rates in the intervention group were calculated, and 
227 
compared to those in the control group.  
228 
Results 
229 
Flow of Women in the CO-OPS Trial  
230 
 10 
 
1,207,633 women were included in the trial, see figure 2. There were three causes of loss to follow 
231 
up: 258 (0.02%) were recalled for further tests from screening but did not attend, 233 (0.02%) had 
232 
an inconclusive needle biopsy result but refused further tests, and 298 women (0.02%) had missing 
233 
data in the NBSS system. An additional 12,426 cases (1.03%) were judged of insufficient quality for 
234 
analysis (Technical recall) by the first reader so were not read within batch and could not be included 
235 
in the analysis, and 271 (0.02%) cases were excluded because the same woman had already been 
236 
screened that year and included in the trial. This occurred primarily when women moved house and 
237 
GP practice and consequently were re-invited more quickly than intended.  
238 
The intervention and control groups were well matched for baseline characteristics including the age 
239 
and previous attendance of the women screened and batch length, as detailed in table 1. 
240 
Mammograms were examined by 360 qualified readers, of which 186 were radiologists, 143 were 
241 
radiography advanced practitioners and 31 were breast clinicians. The median batch length was 35 
242 
cases (quartiles 16 and 46). Each reader examined a median of 5640 cases, (IQR 2599 to 8458), in a 
243 
median of 176 batches (IQR 96 to 278) including cases in both the intervention and control groups. 
244 
Between 1 and 26 batches were examined by each reader in a single day (median 2 IQR 1 to 4). Each 
245 
centre examined between 8152 and 72714 cases (median 25540 cases). 
246 
 
247 
Outcomes 
248 
 
249 
The primary outcome, cancer detection rate, was 0.88% (5272/596642) in the intervention group 
250 
and 0.87% (5212/597505) in the control group (difference 0.011% points 95%CI -0.022 to 0.045), see 
251 
table 2. The intervention did not affect cancer detection rate in the unadjusted (OR=1.01 95%CI 0.96 
252 
to 1.06) or adjusted models (OR=1.01 95%CI 0.97 to 1.06), see table 3 and e2. In the adjusted model, 
253 
cancer detection rate increased with each increasing year of age (OR=1.052 95%CI 1.048 to 1.055) 
254 
and was higher in women who had not previously attended screening (OR=1.73 95%CI 1.62 to 1.86). 
255 
 11 
 
The intervention also had no effect in any of the sub-groups of younger age, first and last 5 cases in 
256 
the batch, the first batch of the day for both readers, or in batches examined second in the day or 
257 
later by both readers in either the adjusted or unadjusted models. For batches read first in each 
258 
workday by both readers cancer detection rate was 0.83% (580/70071, 95%CI 0.76% to 0.89%) in the 
259 
intervention group and 0.88% (623/70715, 95%CI 0.81% to 0.95%) in the control group (difference -
260 
0.053% points 95%CI -0.149 to 0.043). For batches read second or subsequent in each workday by 
261 
both readers cancer detection rate was 0.85% (2472/289786, 95%CI 0.82% to 0.89%) in the 
262

The intervention did not affect either of the secondary outcomes, recall rate or rate of 
267 
disagreements. The recall rate was 4.14% (24681/596642) in the intervention group and 4.17% 
268 
(24894/597505) in the control group (difference -0.030% points 95%CI -0.101 to 0.042), see table 2. 
269 
The rate of disagreement was 3.43% in the intervention group (20471/596294) and 3.48% 
270 
(20793/597387) in the control group (difference -0.048% points 95%CI -0.113 to 0.018), as detailed 
271 
in table 2. The intervention had no effect on recall rate in the unadjusted (OR=0.993 CI 0.974 to 
272 
1.013) or adjusted (OR=0.997 CI 0.978 to 1.016) models, (see supplementary table e3) or on rate of 
273 
disagreement in the unadjusted (OR=0.994 CI 0.971 to 1.019) or adjusted model (OR=0.997 CI 0.974 
274 
to 1.020), see supplementary table e4. Recall rate was higher with each year of age of the woman 
275 
screened (OR 1.008 CI 1.007 to 1.010), and was higher in women who had not previously attended 
276 
breast screening (OR=2.89 CI 2.82 to 2.97). Rate of disagreement was also higher for women at their 
277 
first screening appointment (OR=2.17 CI 2.11 to 2.24) but lower with each year of increasing age of 
278 
the woman screened (OR=0.994 CI 0.992 to 0.996). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 21.4% 
279 
(95% CI 20.8% to 21.9%) in the intervention group and 20.9% (95% CI 20.4% to 21.4%) in the control 
280 
group (difference 0.420% points 95%CI -0.299 to 1.139). The intervention had no effect on any of the 
281 
sub-groups (Younger women, first and last cases in the batch, first batch of the day, and second or 
282 
subsequent batch of the day) for either the adjusted or unadjusted models for either recall rate or 
283 
rate of disagreements. For batches read first in each workday by both readers recall rate was 4.02% 
284 
(2818/70071, 95%CI 3.88% to 4.17%) in the intervention group and 4.11% (2904/70715, 95%CI 
285 
3.96% to 4.25%) in the control group (difference -0.085% points 95%CI -0.291 to 0.121), and rate of 
286 
disagreements was 3.61% (2531/70071, 95%CI 3.47% to 3.75%) in the intervention group and 3.75% 
287 
(2653/70715, 95%CI 3.61% to 3.89%) in the control group (difference -0.140% points 95%CI -0.336 to 
288 
0.057). For batches read second or subsequent in each workday by both readers recall rate was 
289 
4.10% (11868/289786, 95%CI 4.02% to 4.17%) in the intervention group and 4.15% (12068/290671, 
290 
95%CI 4.08% to 4.22%) in the control group (difference -0.056% points 95%CI -0.159 to 0.046), and 
291 
 13 
 
rate of disagreements was 3.23% (9359/289785, 95%CI 3.17% to 3.29%) in the intervention group 
292 
and 3.28% (9533/290670, 95%CI 3.22% to 3.35%) in the control group (difference -0.050% points 
293 
95%CI -0.141 to 0.041). 
294 
Exploratory post-hoc analysis showed that cancer detection rate for individual readers did not 
295 
change with time spent on task, as represented by near identical odds of detecting cancer between 
296 
the first and fortieth case (OR=0.987, 95%CI 0.929 to 1.048). Results were very similar in the model 
297 
adjusted for the characteristics of the woman screened (OR=0.995 95%CI 0.938 to 1.055), 
298 
supplementary table e5. 
299 
Exploratory post-hoc analysis showed that recall rate for individual readers (the proportion of 
300 
women that one reader determined should be recalled) reduced with time on task. The odds of 
301 
recall decreased over the course of examining 40 cases (OR= 0.83, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.85). The 
302 
reduction was similar in the model adjusted for woman’s age and previous attendance (OR=0.89 
303 
95%CI 0.87 to 0.91), see supplementary table e6. The mean change over the course of 40 cases was 
304 
a reduction in recall rate from 6.4% (position 1) to 4.6% (position 40), with the trend continuing in 
305 
longer batches, see figure 3.  
306 
Further exploratory post-hoc analysis indicated that there was also no effect of the intervention 
307 
when readers were blinded to one another’s decision. 366,824 cases were read in the trial at the 16 
308 
centres which blind reader 2 to reader 1 decision. In those centres the cancer detection rate was 
309 
0.88% (1603/181482, 95%CI 0.84% to 0.93%) in the intervention group and 0.87% (1611/185342, 
310 
95%CI 0.83% to 0.91%) in the control group (difference 0.014% points, 95% CI -0.046 to 0.074). 
311 
Similarly recall rate was 4.23% (7669/181482 95%CI 4.13% to 4.32%) in the intervention group and 
312 
4.23% (7847/185342, 95%CI 4.14% to 4.33%) in the control group (difference -0.008% points, 95%CI 
313 
-0.138 to 0.122).

Discussion 
317 
We examined whether an intervention to change the order in which readers examine breast 
318 
screening cases could improve cancer detection rate. We randomised 1.2 million women in batches 
319 
of approximately 35 to intervention or control groups. The intervention did not influence cancer 
320 
detection rate, recall rate, or rate of disagreement between readers. There was no pattern of 
321 
decreasing cancer detection rate with time on task as predicted by previous research on vigilance 
322 
decrements as a psychological phenomenon. Instead there was a gradual decrease in recall rate, 
323 
with an increase in positive predictive value and a decrease in false positive recall of women with 
324 
time on task. This may reinforce and explain previous observational research which identifies that 
325 
recall rate is reduced when grouping women’s cases into batches. 23  
326 
This randomised controlled trial in 1.2 million women was adequately powered to answer the 
327 
research questions, with over half of the English breast screening service taking part. Effects were 
328 
measured in a wide range of hospitals, increasing generalisability. Integration into the existing 
329 
computer systems and reporting mechanisms resulted in very little loss to follow-up (less than 0.1%). 
330 
Design of the trial computer system was iterative with high user involvement, which increased 
331 
practicality and facilitated recruitment.  
332 
This study has several limitations. First, the main limitation is that reading conditions were not 
333 
controlled so whilst effectiveness in screening practice was measured, efficacy in ideal conditions 
334 
was not evaluated. In this large pragmatic trial we aimed to measure the effects of the intervention 
335 
applied to current clinical practice in the UK, and we did not control for or measure working 
336 
conditions, some of which may affect whether there is a vigilance decrement.  Second, all readers 
337 
would have met the minimum NHSBSP standards for reading volume, although we did not specify or 
338 
measure the length of each readers work week, the proportion of their time spent working in breast 
339 
screening or reading mammograms, the number of work hours or type of work activities each day, 
340 
number of breaks taken or self-perceptions of fatigue. Similarly whilst there are programme wide 
341 
 15 
 
auditing methods for reader performance,14 there will also be centre level variation in management 
342 
of individual performance which we did not record. Third, the trial did not attempt to implement 
343 
blinding of reader 2 to the decision of reader 1 where this was not standard practice, as limiting 
344 
reader’s access to computerised and paper notes was not considered possible without 
345 
compromising patient safety. Fourth, 13% of women in the intervention group did not receive the 
346 
intervention as intended. The trial software automatically detected these events, which occurred 
347 
when readers manually overrode the case order and revisited the same case or used barcodes to 
348 
identify individual cases. These women were included in the intention to treat analysis.  
349 
 
350 
The trial results were unexpected, and contradict previous research on the vigilance decrement in 
351 
other fields.5 The vigilance decrement phenomenon has been reported in many peer reviewed 
352 
publications,5 but was not observed in this large randomised controlled trial. These previous studies 
353 
were primarily undertaken in psychology laboratories rather than in real life settings. Gur et al. 24 
354 
demonstrated that performance in experimental conditions and in clinical practice may be very 
355 
different, suggesting that there is a very different set of incentives in these two settings for the 
356 
reader.  Hancock contends that the vigilance decrement is entirely a phenomenon created by the 
357 
conditions designed to measure it. 25 Another explanation for not observing any vigilance decrement 
358 
is simply that the sessions were too short, however, batches of 40 cases take 20-30 minutes to 
359 
examine,26 and the vigilance decrement is usually complete 25 to 35 minutes into the task.5 The 
360 
experienced specialists in this study could be less prone to a vigilance decrement, as was found in 
361 
experienced CCTV operators reviewing a test film. 27 The vigilance decrement phenomenon may be 
362 
associated with an increase in recall threshold rather than a reduction in performance 28 and if 
363 
readers already have a low recall threshold so are recalling cases with minimal indications of cancer 
364 
on the mammograms this may translate to an increase in specificity with minimal decrease in 
365 
sensitivity. In addition, we have not yet tested the secondary outcome of interval cancer rate (rate of 
366 
 16 
 
cancers detected symptomatically between screening rounds). If there was a pattern in number of 
367 
interval cancers with time on task then this may provide evidence of a vigilance decrement. This will 
368 
be investigated through future analysis of 3 year follow-up data. However we are unlikely to observe 
369 
such a pattern, because interval cancer rate is inversely proportional to cancer detection rate and 
370 
this does not change with time on task, and because all cases recalled by one reader did receive a 
371 
reference standard of peers (independent examination by another reader followed by examination 
372 
by a third reader or group of readers) and 60% received follow up tests which included ultrasound 
373 
and biopsy as appropriate. Furthermore the increase in recall rate at the beginning of the batch is 
374 
many times larger than the total number of interval cancers at screening. 1  
375 
A reduction in recall rate with time spent on task has not previously been observed in breast cancer 
376 
screening. However, an observational study has indicated that examining batches of women’s 
377 
mammograms in one sitting, rather than one-by-one reduces the overall recall rate with no change 
378 
in cancer detection rate. 23   
379 
The systematic reduction in recall rate with time on task for an individual reader did not translate 
380 
into differences between the intervention and control group (double reading) in overall recall rate or 
381 
rate of disagreements between readers. There are several possible explanations. The mechanism of 
382 
action is dependent upon the increased recall rates acting upon the same cases in the control group 
383 
and different cases in the intervention group. However, the situation is complex. Different readers 
384 
have different recall thresholds, and different abilities to detect each type of mammographic 
385 
abnormality (eg spiculated masses, asymmetries, architectural distortions etc). Furthermore each 
386 
mammogram has overlapping tissue and many features which may appear suspicious. Therefore for 
387 
any particular pair, the increase in cases recalled at the beginning of the session may not manifest in 
388 
recalling the same cases. If this is the case, then the intervention would not affect overall recall rate, 
389 
but it would affect who is recalled, with more women recalled at the beginning of the batch in the 
390 
control group, and recalls spread more evenly throughout the batch in the intervention group.  
391 
 17 
 
 
392 
The implications for practice are two-fold. Firstly the intervention of two readers examining a batch 
393 
of mammograms in the opposite rather than the same order is not effective in increasing cancer 
394 
detection rate. We have found no evidence of harms from the intervention; however some 
395 
participating readers reported that it was more difficult to examine cases in reverse order as they 
396 
also had to reverse associated paperwork. This result is only generalizable to population screening 
397 
programmes which use two readers to examine mammograms separately. These include the UK NHS 
398 
breast screening programmes where double reading of mammograms was recommended and 
399 
became mandatory following the transition to fully digital mammography,14 European population 
400 
screening programmes where double reading is recommended and implemented, 29 and Australia 
401 
where double reading is considered preferable30 because it increases sensitivity,31 but not 
402 
mandated. In the US the Mammography Quality Standards Act and the FDA do not require double 
403 
reading of mammograms, the decision is made by professional societies and individual centres, and 
404 
in practice it rarely happens.   
405 
Secondly, for individual readers recall rate decreases with time spent on task for up to 60 cases, with 
406 
no concurrent change in cancer detection rate. Therefore we suggest that examining cases in 
407 
batches of up to 60 is likely to be beneficial. This result was found across 360 readers, encompassing 
408 
more than half of the NHS Breast Screening Programme in England. Therefore it is likely to be 
409 
generalisable to screening in England, and may be generalisable across all breast screening 
410 
programmes using batch reading. Examining mammograms in batches is now standard practice in 
411 
high volume population breast screening programmes worldwide, with evidence that batch reading 
412 
increases specificity.23 However batch reading is not always used, particularly when case volumes 
413 
are low, such as in practices serving smaller populations. Batch reading is routine for other imaging 
414 
studies not involving direct radiologist/patient contact with radiology information systems designed 
415 
for this practice. 
416

417 
Conclusion 
418 
Interpretation of batches of mammograms by qualified screening mammography readers using a 
419 
different order versus the same order for the second reading resulted in no significant difference in 
420 
rates of detection of breast cancer.
