 EASL 2017 Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management
of hepatitis B virus infectionq
European Association for the Study of the Liver ⇑
Summary
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global public health
problem with changing epidemiology due to several factors
including vaccination policies and migration. This Clinical Prac-
tice Guideline presents updated recommendations for the opti-
mal management of HBV infection. Chronic HBV infection can
be classified into five phases: (I) HBeAg-positive chronic infec-
tion, (II) HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis, (III) HBeAg-negative
chronic infection, (IV) HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis and (V)
HBsAg-negative phase. All patients with chronic HBV infection
are at increased risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), depending on host and viral factors. The main
goal of therapy is to improve survival and quality of life by pre-
venting disease progression, and consequently HCC development.
The induction of long-term suppression of HBV replication repre-
sents the main endpoint of current treatment strategies, while
HBsAg loss is an optimal endpoint. The typical indication for
treatment requires HBV DNA [2,000 IU/ml, elevated ALT and/or
at least moderate histological lesions, while all cirrhotic patients
with detectable HBV DNA should be treated. Additional indica-
tions include the prevention of mother to child transmission in
pregnant women with high viremia and prevention of HBV reac-
tivation in patients requiring immunosuppression or chemother-
apy. The long-term administration of a potent nucleos(t)ide
analogue with high barrier to resistance, i.e., entecavir, tenofovir
disoproxil or tenofovir alafenamide, represents the treatment of
choice. Pegylated interferon-alfa treatment can also be consid-
ered in mild to moderate chronic hepatitis B patients. Combina-
tion therapies are not generally recommended. All treated and
untreated patients should be monitored for treatment response
and adherence, and the risk of progression and development of
complications. HCC remains the major concern for treated
chronic hepatitis B patients. Several subgroups of patients with
HBV infection require specific focus. Future treatment strategies
to achieve ‘cure’ of disease and new biomarkers are discussed.

Introduction
Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains an important glo-
bal public health problem with significant morbidity and mortal-
ity.1–3 New information on the pathogenesis and management of
HBV infection has become available since the previous EASL Clin-
ical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) prepared in 2011 and published in
2012.1 The objective of this manuscript is to update the recom-
mendations for the optimal management of HBV infection. In
order to keep the manuscript and particularly the reference list
within a reasonable length, only references published after
2012 have been considered, since the readers can find the older
supportive references in the 2012 EASL HBV CPGs.1 The CPGs
do not fully address prevention including vaccination. In addi-
tion, despite increasing knowledge, areas of uncertainty still exist
and therefore clinicians, patients and public health authorities
must continue to make choices based on the evolving evidence.
Background
Epidemiology and public health burden
Approximately 240 million people are chronic HBV surface anti-
gen (HBsAg) carriers, with a large regional variation of HBsAg-
positive patients between low (\2%) and high ([8%) endemicity
levels.2,4 The prevalence is decreasing in several highly endemic
countries due to improvements in the socioeconomic status, uni-
versal vaccination programs and perhaps effective antiviral treat-
ments.5 However, population movements and migration are
currently changing the prevalence and incidence in several low
endemic countries in Europe (e.g., Italy, Germany), owing to the
higher HBsAg prevalence rates in migrants and refugees from
outside Europe compared with the indigenous population.6,7
Even with universal vaccination programs, it has been impossible
to substantially prevent acute cases of HBV infection, especially
in high risk populations.8,9 The number of HBV related deaths
due to liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

cases in 2013 worldwide.10
Virology and immunopathogenesis
The viral life cycle
Human HBV belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family of small, envel-
oped, primarily hepatotropic DNA viruses. In the host, the virus
replicates and assembles exclusively in hepatocytes, and virions
are released non-cytopathically through the cellular secretory
pathway. The viral genome shows an extremely compact organ-
isation. The small (3.2 kb), partially double-stranded, relaxed-
circular (rc) DNA features 4 open reading frames encoding 7 pro-
teins: HBeAg (HBV e antigen, secreted dimeric protein), HBcAg
(HBV core antigen, viral capsid protein), HBV Pol/RT (polymerase,
reverse transcriptase activity), PreS1/PreS2/HBsAg (large, med-
ium, and small surface envelope glycoproteins), and HBx (HBV
x antigen, regulator of transcription required for the initiation
of infection).11,12 Upon viral uptake into hepatocytes, the HBV
nucleocapsid is transported to the nucleus to release the rcDNA
genome. In the nucleoplasm, the rcDNA is converted into a cova-
lently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is wrapped by his-
tones to form an episomal chromatinized structure. It then
serves as a transcription template for all viral transcripts that
are translated into the different viral proteins.13 Besides encoding
the capsid protein and the viral polymerase, the pregenomic RNA
is reverse transcribed into new rcDNA within the viral capsid. The
DNA containing nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm are either recy-
cled into the nucleus to maintain cccDNA reservoir, or enveloped
and secreted via the endoplasmic reticulum.11 In addition to
complete infectious virions (diameter of 42 nm), infected cells
produce a large excess of genome-free, non-infectious sub-viral
spherical or filamentous particles of 22 nm.11 Viral genome inte-
gration in the host genome can occur randomly; it is not required
for viral replication, but is one of the important mechanisms
involved in hepatocyte transformation.14
Genetic variability of HBV
The lack of reverse transcriptase proofreading activity leads to
frequent mutations of the viral genome. This results in the coex-
istence of genetically distinct viral species in infected individuals,
also called viral quasispecies, which evolve depending on the
pressure from the host environment. The interplay between the
virus, hepatocyte and the immune response or antiviral treat-
ment is thought to drive the emergence of HBV mutants that
have the capacity to escape immune responses or antiviral treat-
ments. Analysis of genome-wide nucleotide divergence has
allowed for the identification of nine genotypes (A-I) and several
sub-genotypes.12,15
Immunopathogenesis
In acute resolving infections, the response of the innate and adap-
tive immune system to HBV is efficient and timely. Viral clear-
ance involves the induction of a robust adaptive T cell reaction
inducing both a cytolytic dependent and independent antiviral
effect via the expression of antiviral cytokines, as well as the
induction of B cells producing neutralizing antibodies preventing
the spread of the virus.16,17 Hepatocyte turnover resulting from
infected cell death leads to cccDNA dilution.
When the acute infection becomes chronic, there is a progres-
sive impairment in HBV specific T cell function. Chronic HBV
infection progresses through distinct disease phases that are
strongly associated with age. It has been observed that children
and young adults with chronic HBV infection have an immune
profile that is less compromised than that observed in older
patients, challenging the concept of ‘immune tolerance’.16 Several
studies showed that HBV persists with virus-specific and global T
cell dysfunction mediated by multiple regulatory mechanisms,
but without distinct T cell�based immune signatures for clinical
phenotypes (or clinical phase of infection).16,17 Genome-wide
association
studies
recently
identified
the
INTS10
gene
at
8p21.3 as a novel locus contributing to the susceptibility to per-
sistent HBV infection among Chinese subjects, and being causa-
tive for HBV clearance by activation of IRF3 and then expression
of anti-virus interferons hereby highlighting the role of innate
immunity in viral clearance.18
Natural history and new nomenclature for the chronic states
Chronic HBV infection is a dynamic process reflecting the interac-
tion between HBV replication and the host immune response and
not all patients with chronic HBV infection have chronic hepatitis
(CHB). The natural history of chronic HBV infection has been
schematically divided into five phases, taking into account the
presence of HBeAg, HBV DNA levels, alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) values and eventually the presence or absence of liver
inflammation (Fig. 1). The new nomenclature is based on the
description of the two main characteristics of chronicity: infec-
tion vs. hepatitis. However, despite this nomenclature, in a signif-
icant
number
of
patients,
a
single
determination
of
HBV
replication markers as well as disease activity markers does not
allow an immediate classification to one of the phases. Serial
monitoring of serum HBeAg, HBV DNA and ALT levels is required
in most instances but even after a complete assessment, some
subjects fall into an indeterminate grey area and management
needs to be individualised. The phases of chronic HBV infection
are not necessarily sequential:
Phase 1: HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection, previously ter-
med ‘‘immune tolerant’’ phase; characterised by the presence of
serum HBeAg, very high levels of HBV DNA and ALT persistently
within the normal range according to traditional cut-off values
[upper limit of normal (ULN) approximately 40 IU/L].1 In the
liver, there is minimal or no liver necroinflammation or fibrosis
but a high level of HBV DNA integration and clonal hepatocyte
expansion suggesting that hepatocarcinogenesis could be already
underway in this early phase of the infection.1,19 This phase is
more frequent and prolonged in subjects infected perinatally
and is associated with preserved HBV specific T cell function at
least until young adulthood.20 The rate of spontaneous HBeAg
loss is very low in this phase. These patients are highly conta-
gious due to the high levels of HBV DNA.
Phase 2: HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B is characterised by
the presence of serum HBeAg, high levels of HBV DNA and ele-
vated ALT. In the liver, there is moderate or severe liver necroin-
flammation and accelerated progression of fibrosis1. It may occur
after several years of the first phase and is more frequently and/
or rapidly reached in subjects infected during adulthood. The out-
come of this phase is variable. Most patients can achieve HBeAg
seroconversion
and
HBV
DNA
suppression
and
enter
the
HBeAg-negative infection phase. Other patients may fail to con-
trol HBV and progress to the HBeAg-negative CHB phase for many
years.

Journal of Hepatology 2017 vol. xxx j xxx–xxx
 Phase 3: HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection, previously
termed ‘inactive carrier’ phase, is characterised by the presence
of serum antibodies to HBeAg (anti-HBe), undetectable or low
(\2,000 IU/ml) HBV DNA levels and normal ALT according to tra-
ditional cut-off values (ULN �40 IU/ml). Some patients in this
phase, however, may have HBV DNA levels [2,000 IU/ml (usually
\20,000 IU/ml) accompanied by persistently normal ALT and
only minimal hepatic necroinflammatory activity and low fibro-
sis. These patients have low risk of progression to cirrhosis or
HCC if they remain in this phase, but progression to CHB, usually
in HBeAg-negative patients, may occur.1 HBsAg loss and/or
seroconversion may occur spontaneously in 1–3% of cases per
year.1 Typically, such patients may have low levels of serum
HBsAg (\1,000 IU/ml).21
Phase 4: HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B is characterised by
the lack of serum HBeAg usually with detectable anti-HBe, and
persistent or fluctuating moderate to high levels of serum HBV
DNA (often lower than in HBeAg-positive patients), as well as fluc-
tuating or persistently elevated ALT values. The liver histology
shows necroinflammation and fibrosis.1 Most of these subjects
harbour HBV variants in the precore and/or the basal core pro-
moter regions that impair or abolish HBeAg expression. This phase
is associated with low rates of spontaneous disease remission.1
Phase 5: HBsAg-negative phase is characterised by serum neg-
ative HBsAg and positive antibodies to HBcAg (anti-HBc), with or
without detectable antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs). This phase is
also known as ‘‘occult HBV infection”. In rare cases, the absence
of HBsAg could be related to the sensitivity of the assay used
for detection.22 Patients in this phase have normal ALT values
and usually, but not always, undetectable serum HBV DNA.
HBV DNA (cccDNA) can be detected frequently in the liver.1
HBsAg loss before the onset of cirrhosis is associated with a min-
imal risk of cirrhosis, decompensation and HCC, and an improve-
ment on survival. However, if cirrhosis has developed before
HBsAg loss, patients remain at risk of HCC therefore HCC surveil-
lance should continue. Immunosuppression may lead to HBV
reactivation in these patients.1
Factors related to progression to cirrhosis and HCC
The risk of progression to cirrhosis and HCC is variable and is
affected by the host’s immune response. The 5-year cumulative
incidence of cirrhosis ranges from 8% to 20% in untreated CHB
patients and, among those with cirrhosis, the 5-year cumula-
tive risk of hepatic decompensation is 20%.1 The annual risk
of HCC in patients with cirrhosis has been reported to be
2–5%.23
HCC is currently the main concern for diagnosed CHB
patients and may develop even in patients who have been effec-
tively treated.24 The risk of developing HCC is higher in patients
with one or more factors that relate to the host (cirrhosis,
chronic hepatic necroinflammation, older age, male sex, African
origin, alcohol abuse, chronic co-infections with other hepatitis
viruses or human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], diabetes or
metabolic syndrome, active smoking, positive family history)
and/or to HBV properties (high HBV DNA and/or HBsAg levels,
HBV genotype C > B, specific mutations).24 The above factors
seem to affect the progression to cirrhosis in untreated CHB
patients.1
Several risk scores have been recently developed for HCC
prediction in CHB patients. Most of them, such as GAG-
HCC, CU-HCC and REACH-B, have been developed and vali-
dated in Asian untreated CHB patients,25 but they do not
seem to offer good predictability in most studies including
Caucasian CHB patients.26,27 A recently developed and vali-
dated new score, PAGE-B, offers good predictability for HCC
during the first 5 years of entecavir or tenofovir therapy in
Caucasian, mostly European, CHB patients and can be easily
applied in clinical practice, as it is based on widely available
parameters
(platelets,
age,
gender).28
The
PAGE-B
score
appears to predict HCC development even in untreated CHB
patients.29,30
Initial assessment of subjects with chronic HBV infection
The initial evaluation of a subject with chronic HBV infection
should include a complete history, a physical examination,
assessment of liver disease activity and severity and markers of
HBV infection (Fig. 1). In addition, all first degree relatives and
sexual partners of subjects with chronic HBV infection should
be advised to be tested for HBV serological markers (HBsAg,
anti-HBs, anti-HBc) and to be vaccinated if they are negative for
these markers.

 (1) The assessment of the severity of liver disease is important
to identify patients for treatment and HCC surveillance. It
is based on a physical examination and biochemical
parameters (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and ALT,
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], alkaline phos-
phatase, bilirubin, and serum albumin and gamma globu-
lins,
full
blood
count
and
prothrombin
time).
An
abdominal hepatic ultrasound is recommended in all
patients. A liver biopsy or a non-invasive test should be
performed to determine disease activity in cases where
biochemical
and
HBV
markers
reveal
inconclusive
results.31 Of the non-invasive methods, which include liver
stiffness measurements and serum biomarkers of liver
fibrosis, the use of transient elastography has been mostly
studied and seems to offer a higher diagnostic accuracy for
the detection of advanced fibrosis. The diagnostic accuracy
of all non-invasive methods is better at excluding than
confirming advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.31,32 The results
of transient elastography may be confounded by severe
inflammation associated with high ALT levels.31,32
(2) HBeAg and anti-HBe detection are essential for the deter-
mination of the phase of chronic HBV infection.
(3) Measurement of HBV DNA serum level is essential for the
diagnosis, establishment of the phase of the infection, the
decision to treat and subsequent monitoring of patients.
(4) Serum HBsAg quantification can be useful, particularly in
HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection and in patients to
be treated with interferon-alfa (IFNa).
(5) HBV genotype is not necessary in the initial evaluation,
although it may be useful for selecting patients to be trea-
ted with IFNa offerering prognostic information for the
probability of response to IFNa therapy and the risk of
HCC.
(6) Co-morbidities, including alcoholic, autoimmune, meta-
bolic liver disease with steatosis or steatohepatitis and
other causes of chronic liver disease should be systemati-
cally excluded including co-infections with hepatitis D
virus (HDV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV.
(7) Testing for antibodies against hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV)
should be performed, and patients with negative anti-HAV
should be advised to be vaccinated against HAV.
Methodology
These CPGs were developed by a CPG panel of experts chosen by
the EASL Governing Board, peer-reviewed by three external
experts and approved by the EASL Governing Board. The CPGs
have been based as far as possible on evidence from existing pub-
lications, and, if evidence was unavailable, on the experts’ per-
sonal experience and opinion. Manuscripts and abstracts of
important meetings published since the last CPG and prior to
December 2016 have been evaluated. The evidence and recom-
mendations in these guidelines have been graded according to
the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and
Evaluation (GRADE) system33 (Table 1). The strength of recom-
mendations (strong: 1, weak: 2) thus reflects the quality (grade)
of underlying evidence (I, II-1, II-2, II-3, III). Grades are not pro-
vided for statements and definitions. For practical reasons,
months and not weeks were used in parts of the manuscript
(e.g.
6
and
12 months
instead
of
24
and
48/52 weeks,
respectively).
Guidelines
Goals of therapy
The main goal of therapy for patients with chronic HBV infection
is to improve survival and quality of life by preventing disease
progression, and consequently HCC development. Additional
goals of antiviral therapy are to prevent mother to child transmis-
sion, hepatitis B reactivation and the prevention and treatment of
HBV-associated extrahepatic manifestations.
The likelihood of achieving these goals depends on the timing
of therapy during the natural course of the infection but also on
the stage of the disease and the patients’ age when treatment is
started. Regression of fibrosis and cirrhosis can be regarded as a
further goal of treatment in patients with established advanced
fibrosis or cirrhosis, although its impact has not been fully clari-
fied in clinical outcomes. Treatment strategies to prevent HCC
development may differ in some ways from those that are needed
to prevent fibrosis progression.
In patients with HBV-induced HCC, the goals of nucleos(t)ide
analogue (NA) therapy are firstly to suppress HBV replication to
induce the stabilisation of HBV-induced liver disease and to pre-
vent disease progression, and secondly to reduce the risk of HCC
recurrence after potentially curative HCC therapies. Stabilising
the HBV-induced liver disease can be also regarded as a prerequi-
site for the safe and effective applications of HCC treatments.
In patients with acute hepatitis B, preventing the risk of acute
or subacute liver failure is the main treatment goal. Improving
the quality of life by shortening the duration of the disease asso-
ciated symptoms as well as lowering the risk of chronicity may be
also regarded as relevant goals of treatment.
Endpoints of therapy
Recommendations
� The induction of long-term suppression of HBV DNA
levels represents the main endpoint of all current treat-
ment strategies (Evidence level I, grade of recommenda-
tion 1).
� The induction of HBeAg loss, with or without anti-HBe
seroconversion, in HBeAg-positive CHB patients is a
valuable endpoint, as it often represents a partial
immune control of the chronic HBV infection (Evidence
level II-1, grade of recommendation 1).
� A biochemical response defined as ALT normalisation
should be considered as an additional endpoint, which
is achieved in most patients with long-term suppression
of HBV replication (Evidence level II-1, grade of recom-
mendation 1).
� HBsAg loss, with or without anti-HBs seroconversion, is
an optimal endpoint, as it indicates profound suppres-
sion of HBV replication and viral protein expression
(Evidence level II-1, grade of recommendation 1).

 The level of HBV replication represents the strongest single
predictive biomarker associated with disease progression and
the long-term outcome of chronic HBV infection. The inhibition
of viral replication by antiviral treatment has been shown to
achieve the elimination of chronic HBV-induced necroinflamma-
tory activity and progressive fibrotic liver processes in the vast
majority of patients, in turn reducing the risk of HCC. It therefore
represents the cornerstone endpoint of all our current therapeu-
tic attempts.1,25,34–40 The level of HBV DNA suppression that
should be attained in order to achieve these benefits is not well
defined, but inferred that the lower, the better.
Treatment-induced HBeAg loss and seroconversion to anti-
HBe characterises the induction of a partial immune control often
leading to a low replicative phase of the chronic HBV infection.
Whether this is a durable phase is only proven after treatment
cessation. After stopping therapy, HBeAg seroreversion, as well
as the development of HBeAg-negative CHB, may also occur (even
after NA consolidation treatment), making this endpoint less reli-
able.41,42 Hence, continuing oral antiviral therapy irrespective of
the HBeAg response until HBsAg loss has become an alternative
strategy.
Suppression of HBV DNA to undetectable levels is normally
associated with normalisation of ALT levels. Persistence of ele-
vated ALT levels in patients with complete suppression of viral
replication is associated with a lower chance of fibrosis regres-
sion and can be a reason for histologic disease progression.43
The most likely explanation for these findings is the presence of
concomitant liver injury such as alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease.34,44 In contrast, transient ALT flares may indicate
some level of immune reconstitution and can be associated with
favourable outcomes.1,45,46
The loss of HBsAg is regarded as the optimal treatment end-
point, termed ‘functional cure’, but it is only rarely achieved
with our current antiviral armamentarium. Spontaneous HBsAg
seroreversion with reactivation of the inflammatory liver pro-
cess after HBsAg loss is rare and may occur in patients with
a significant impairment of their immune function.47–52 The
main advantage of HBsAg loss is that it allows a safe discontin-
uation of antiviral therapy. As chronic HBV infection cannot be
completely eradicated due to the persistence of cccDNA and
integrated HBV DNA,1 it remains unclear whether HBsAg loss
adds to the prevention of the long-term complications of
chronic HBV infection beyond what can be achieved by the
suppression of HBV DNA replication alone. HCC may still
develop
even
after
spontaneous
HBsAg
loss
(annual
rate
approximately 0.55%).53 The risk, however, is lower if HBsAg
loss is achieved at a younger age and/or in the absence of sig-
nificant
fibrosis.1,54
In
an
Asian
cohort
followed
for
287
patient-years after NA treatment induced HBsAg seroclearance,
only two patients with baseline cirrhosis developed HCC or
died (0.7% annual risk), which was a significantly lower rate
compared
with
propensity
score-matched
patients
without
HBsAg seroclearance (HR 0.09, p\0.01).47
Indications for treatment
Recommendations
� All patients with HBeAg-positive or -negative chronic
hepatitis B, defined by HBV DNA [2,000 IU/ml, ALT
[ULN and/or at least moderate liver necroinflammation
or fibrosis, should be treated (Evidence level I, grade of
recommendation 1).
� Patients with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis
need treatment, with any detectable HBV DNA level
and regardless of ALT levels (Evidence level I, grade of
recommendation 1).
� Patients with HBV DNA[20,000 IU/ml and ALT [2xULN
should start treatment regardless of the degree of fibro-
sis (Evidence level II-2, grade of recommendation 1).
� Patients with HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection,
defined by persistently normal ALT and high HBV DNA
levels, may be treated if they are older than 30 years
regardless of the severity of liver histological lesions
(Evidence level III, grade of recommendation 2).
� Patients
with
HBeAg-positive
or
HBeAg-negative
chronic HBV infection and family history of HCC or cir-
rhosis and extrahepatic manifestations can be treated
even if typical treatment indications are not fulfilled
(Evidence level III, grade of recommendation 2).
The indications for treatment are generally the same for both
HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative CHB (Fig. 2). This is based
mainly on the combination of three criteria:
� Serum HBV DNA levels
� Serum ALT levels
� Severity of liver disease

 Patients without cirrhosis should be considered for treatment
when they have HBV DNA levels above 2,000 IU/ml, serum ALT
levels above the traditional ULN (�40 IU/ml) and severity of liver
disease assessed traditionally by liver biopsy showing at least
moderate necroinflammation and/or at least moderate fibrosis.
Patients with HBV DNA [20,000 IU/ml and ALT [2x ULN can
start treatment even without a liver biopsy. Liver biopsy may
provide additional useful information but it does not usually
change the decision for treatment. A non-invasive method for
the estimation of the extent of fibrosis and, most critically from
a monitoring perspective, to confirm or rule out cirrhosis is useful
in patients who start treatment without liver biopsy.
In patients who have HBV DNA [2,000 IU/ml and at least
moderate fibrosis, treatment may be initiated even if ALT levels
are normal. In patients who cannot or are reluctant to undergo
liver biopsy, non-invasive markers of fibrosis may also be used
for decisions on treatment indications.
As explained in more detail in the EASL-ALEH CPGs on ‘‘non-
invasive tests for evaluation of liver disease severity and progno-
sis”,32 patients with chronic HBV infection either with normal
ALT and liver stiffness [9 kPa, or with elevated ALT but below
5x ULN and liver stiffness [12 kPa at a reliable transient elastog-
raphy can be considered to have severe fibrosis or cirrhosis.
Equivalent cut-offs from other elastographic or serological meth-
ods of assessment of liver fibrosis may also be used once vali-
dated in chronic HBV patients.
Indications for treatment may also take into account the
patients’ age, health status, risk of HBV transmission, family his-
tory of HCC or cirrhosis and extrahepatic manifestations (Fig. 2).
Monitoring of patients currently not treated
Recommendations
� Patients with HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection
who are younger than 30 years and do not fulfill any
of the above treatment indications should be followed
at least every 3–6 months (Evidence level II-2, grade of
recommendation 1).
� Patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection
and serum HBV DNA \2,000 IU/ml who do not fulfill
any of the above treatment indications should be fol-
lowed every 6–12 months (Evidence level II-2, grade of
recommendation 1).
� Patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection
and serum HBV DNA P2,000 IU/ml who do not fulfill
any of the above treatment indications should be fol-
lowed every 3 months for the first year and every
6 months thereafter (Evidence level III, grade of recom-
mendation 1).
Patients who are not candidates for antiviral therapy should be
monitored with periodical assessments of serum ALT and HBV
DNA levels as well as for liver fibrosis severity by non-invasive
markers (Fig. 2). Patients with HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infec-
tion who remain untreated should ideally have ALT determina-
tions at least every 3 months, HBV DNA determinations every
6–12 months and assessment of liver fibrosis every 12 months.1
Patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection and HBV
DNA \2,000 IU/ml should have ALT determinations every 6–
12 months and periodical HBV DNA and liver fibrosis assess-
ments, perhaps every 2–3 years. A quantitative determination
of HBsAg levels can be helpful in the decision on the frequency
of follow-up in such patients.21 Patients can be followed for
ALT levels every 12 months and HBV DNA and liver fibrosis
assessments every 3 years if they have HBsAg levels \1,000 IU/
ml, while follow-up with ALT every 6 months and HBV DNA
and liver fibrosis assessment at least every 2 years is advised
for patients with HBsAg levels P1,000 IU/ml.1,21,55
Patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection and HBV
DNA P2,000 IU/ml should be followed with ALT determinations
at least every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months
thereafter, as well as with assessments of HBV DNA and liver
fibrosis by a non-invasive method every year for at least 3 years.
If they do not fulfill any treatment indication within the first
3 years of follow-up, they should be consequently followed for
life, like all patients in this phase.55
Treatment strategies
Currently, there are two main treatment options for CHB
patients: treatment with a NA or with IFNa, currently pegylated
(PegIFNa) (Table 2).1,56 The NAs that have been approved in Eur-
ope for HBV treatment include lamivudine (LAM), adefovir dip-
ivoxil
(ADV),
entecavir
(ETV),
telbivudine
(TBV),
tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), and
can be classified into those associated with low barrier against
HBV resistance (LAM, ADV, TBV) and those with high barrier to
HBV resistance (ETV, TDF, TAF) (Fig. 3).1,56,57
The main advantage of treatment with a potent NA with high
barrier to resistance (i.e., ETV, TDF, TAF) is its predictable high
long-term antiviral efficacy leading to undetectable HBV DNA
levels in the vast majority of compliant patients as well as its
favourable safety profile (Table 2).1,56,57 These drugs can be safely
used in any HBV infected patient and represent the only treatment
option for several patient subgroups including those with decom-
pensated liver disease, liver transplants, extrahepatic manifesta-
tions, acute hepatitis B or severe chronic HBV exacerbation.57–61
NAs are also the only option for prevention of HBV reactivation
in patients under immunosuppression. In addition, preventing
HBV transmission in patients with high viremia who do not fulfill
the typical criteria for treatment initiation represents further indi-
cations in which only NAs should be used.1,49,50,52,56,57
The rationale for a PegIFNa based approach is to induce long-
term immunological control with a finite duration treatment. The
main disadvantages of PegIFNa treatment is the high variability
of response and its unfavourable safety profile making a signifi-
cant number of patients ineligible or unwilling for this type of
treatment (Table 2).1,56 Patient selection according to disease
activity, HBV genotype, stage of the disease, as well as levels of
HBV DNA, HBsAg and HBeAg status can be helpful indicators to
predict
the
individual
response
probability.1,56
Early
on-
treatment predictors are established and can be used as addi-
tional tools (e.g. stopping rules) to individualise the treatment
strategy, this helps to discontinue PegIFNa early in those with a
low likelihood of long-term response.1
Theoretically, a combined NA and PegIFNa approach may pro-
vide advantages by combining the potent antiviral effect of NA
plus the immune modulation of IFNa.1,56,62,63 The evidence for

 superiority of such a combined approach, however, is lacking, and
there are still many unresolved issues with respect to patient
selection, timing, as well as the duration of the combination
strategy, which may be addressed in future studies.
Definitions of response
Responses can be divided into virological, serological, biochemi-
cal, and histological. All responses can be estimated at several
time points during and after therapy. The definitions of virologi-
cal responses vary according to the timing (on or after therapy)
and type of therapy.1
Virological responses
(1) NA therapy
� Virological response during NA is defined as undetectable
HBV DNA by a sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
assay with a limit of detection of 10 IU/ml. Primary non-
response is defined by a less than one log10 decrease of
serum HBV DNA after 3 months of therapy. Partial virologi-
cal response is defined as a decrease in HBV DNA of more
than 1 log10 IU/ml but detectable HBV DNA after at least
12 months of therapy in compliant patients. Virological
breakthrough is defined as a confirmed increase in HBV
DNA level of more than 1 log10 IU/ml compared to the nadir
(lowest value) HBV DNA level on-therapy; it may precede a
biochemical breakthrough, characterised by an increase in
ALT levels. HBV resistance to NA(s) is characterised by selec-
tion of HBV variants with amino acid substitutions that con-
fer reduced susceptibility to the administered NA(s).
� In patients who discontinue NA, sustained off-therapy
virological response could be defined as serum HBV DNA
levels \2,000 IU/ml for at least 12 months after the end
of therapy.
(2) PegIFNa therapy
� Virological response is defined as serum HBV DNA levels
\2,000 IU/ml. It is usually evaluated at 6 months and at
the end of therapy.
� Sustained off-therapy virological response is defined as
serum
HBV
DNA
levels
\2,000 IU/ml
for
at
least
12 months after the end of therapy.
Serological responses for HBeAg are HBeAg loss and HBeAg
seroconversion, i.e., HBeAg loss and development of anti-HBe
(only for HBeAg-positive patients).
Serological responses for HBsAg are HBsAg loss and HBsAg sero-
conversion, i.e., HBsAg loss and development of anti-HBs (for all
patients).
Biochemical response is defined as a normalisation of ALT
levels based on the traditional ULN (�40 IU/ml). Since ALT activ-
ity often fluctuates over time, a minimum follow-up of at least
1 year post-treatment with ALT determinations at least every
3 months is required to confirm sustained off-treatment bio-
chemical response. It should be noted that the rates of sustained
off-treatment biochemical responses may sometimes be difficult
to evaluate, as transient ALT elevations before long-term bio-
chemical remission may occur in some CHB patients within the
first year after treatment discontinuation. In such cases, addi-
tional close ALT follow-up of at least 2 years after ALT elevation
seems to be reasonable in order to confirm sustained off-
therapy biochemical remission.
Histological response is defined as a decrease in necroinflam-
matory activity (by P2 points in histologic activity index or
Ishak’s system) without worsening in fibrosis compared to pre-
treatment histological findings.

 The efficacy of all NAs has been assessed in randomised con-
trolled phase III clinical trials (Table 3 and 4). The treatment
strategy
for
non-cirrhotic
and
compensated
cirrhotic
HBV
patients is identical given the efficacy and long-term safety pro-
file in NA therapy. In HBeAg-positive CHB, 5 years of ETV achieve
a 99% cumulative probability of virologic response and 53% prob-
ability of HBeAg loss.26 After 5 years of TDF treatment in patients
with HBeAg-positive CHB, 97% of those on-treatment had viro-
logic response and 73% had normal ALT,34 while HBeAg loss
was present in 49%, HBeAg seroconversion in 40%, HBsAg loss
in 10% and HBsAg seroconversion in 8%.
In patients with HBeAg-negative CHB, the 5-year cumulative
probability of virological and biochemical responses on ETV
was 98% and 95%, respectively, while the rate of resistance to
ETV was \1%.26,64–68 After 8 years, 99% of HBeAg-negative CHB
patients treated with TDF in the registration trial achieved viro-
logical response (HBV DNA \400 copies/ml) without evidence
of TDF resistance and 88% normalised ALT.69 During 3–4 years
of TDF treatment in HBeAg-negative CHB patients in real practice,
the virological response rates ranged from 92% to 100% without
the emergence of TDF resistance, while 75% of patients had nor-
malised ALT.70–73 No HBeAg-negative CHB patient cleared HBsAg
wihin the first year of ETV or TDF therapy and very few (�1%)
achieved this endpoint during long-term (8 years) therapy.
In patients with HBeAg-positive CHB, the rates of virologic
response on TAF were 64% at week 48 and 75% at week 9674,75
HBeAg loss and anti-HBe seroconversion were achieved in 14%
and 10% of patients at week 48 and 22% and 18% at week 96,
respectively. In the same study, ALT normalisation rates at week
96 by traditional values were higher in patients treated with TAF
than TDF (75% vs. 68%), whereas only 1% of patients cleared
HBsAg.74–76 In HBeAg-negative CHB patients, TAF achieved viro-
logic response in 94% of patients at week 48,76 which was main-
tained in most cases at week 96 (90%). Only one TAF treated
HBeAg-negative CHB patient (\1%) cleared HBsAg by week
96.77 These virological and serological results are similar to those
observed in the TDF arms in both studies. Only 96-week results
are available for TAF to date, with the studies still ongoing
(Table 3 and 4).

 Monitoring of patients treated with ETV, TDF or TAF
Recommendations
� All patients treated with NA should be followed with
periodical assessments including ALT and serum HBV
DNA (Evidence level I, grade of recommendation 1).
� Patients at risk of renal disease treated with any NA and
all patients regardless of renal risk treated with TDF
should undergo periodical renal monitoring including
at least estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and
serum phosphate levels (Evidence level II-2, grade of
recommendation 1).
� Patients on TDF at risk of development and/or with
underlying renal or bone disease should be considered
for a switch to ETV or TAF, depending on previous
LAM exposure (Evidence level II-2/I, grade of recom-
mendation 1).
All patients considered for treatment with a NA with high
barrier to resistance (ETV, TDF, TAF) should undergo periodical
monitoring. At baseline, full blood count, liver and kidney (eGFR
and serum phosphate levels) function tests, serum HBV DNA
levels assessed by a sensitive PCR assay should be performed.
Appropriate dosing adjustments of ETV and TDF are recom-
mended
for
patients
with
eGFR \50 ml/min.
TAF
dosage
remains at 25 mg until eGFR is \15 ml/min, with modeling
pharmacokinetics data suggesting no dose change between
\15 ml/min and formal renal support, although this is not
within the label (Vemlidy� SmPC).78 In addition, the baseline
renal risk should be assessed for all patients. High renal risk
includes one or more of the following factors: decompensated
cirrhosis, creatinine clearance (eGFR) \60 ml/min, poorly con-
trolled hypertension, proteinuria, uncontrolled diabetes, active
glomerulonephritis, concomitant nephrotoxic drugs, or solid
organ transplantation.
During treatment, liver function tests should be performed
every 3–4 months during the first year and every six months
thereafter. Serum HBV DNA should be determined every 3–
4 months during the first year and every 6–12 months thereafter.
HBsAg should be checked at 12-month intervals if HBV DNA
remains undetectable, while patients who clear HBsAg should
be tested for anti-HBs.
Minimal rates of renal function decline have been reported
during long-term therapy with ETV and TDF, but the nephro-
toxic potential is higher for TDF. Cases of Fanconi syndrome
associated with TDF therapy and rescued after a switch to ETV
have been reported. In addition, studies using sensitive markers
of glomerular and tubular kidney function and of bone mineral
density have also reported chronic tubular damage and decline of
eGFR and bone mineral density in TDF treated patients.70,79–87
Therefore, it seems appropriate for now to monitor all CHB
patients treated with TDF therapy for adverse renal effects with
serum creatinine (eGFR) and serum phosphate levels. Moreover,
CHB patients at high renal risk undergoing any NA therapy
should be monitored with serum creatinine (eGFR) levels. The
frequency of renal monitoring can be every 3 months during
the first year and every 6 months thereafter, if no deterioration.
Closer renal monitoring is required in patients who develop
creatinine clearance \60 ml/min or serum phosphate levels
\2 mg/dl.
In the two registrational TAF trials, TAF compared to TDF
demonstrated superiority in the drug effects on several markers
of renal (both glomerular and tubular) function and bone turnover
at weeks 48 and 96.74–77,88 In both groups of patients there was a
significant difference in markers reflecting renal and bone func-
tion at week 48. A significant difference was noted in decrease
of eGFR in both studies: �0.6 ml/min vs. �5.4 ml/min in HBeAg-
positive patients (p\0.0001), �1.8 ml/min vs. �4.8 ml/min in
HBeAg-negative patients (p = 0.004). Similar mean serum crea-
tinine changes were demonstrated between TAF and TDF treated
subjects: HBeAg-positive TAF treated patient’s 0.01 mg/dl vs.
0.03 mg/dl in TDF (p = 0.02); HBeAg-negative 0.01 mg/dl vs.
0.02 mg/dl (p = 0.32). Likewise, a significantly smaller percentage
decline in bone mineral density at the hip was reported in
TAF patients over TDF treated patients (�0.10% vs. �1.72% in
HBeAg-positive patients [p \0.0001], and �0.29% vs. �2.16%
in HBeAg-negative [p\0.0001]) and spine (�0.42% vs. �2.29% in
HBeAg- positive, �0.88% vs. �2.51% HBeAg-negative. Additional
data with biomarkers of renal tubular function and bone turnover
suggest less systemic effects in TAF compared to TDF, with less
progression of chronic kidney disease and bone effects up to week
96.75,77 Long-term clinical data are lacking, however, similar find-
ings of superiority of TAF over TDF have also been found in recent
studies in HIV infected patients at risk for or with established
renal and bone impairment.89–92
These co-infected data also demonstrate stabilisation in renal
parameters (GFR, creatinine) but improvement in proteinuria,
albuminuria and tubular proteinuria, (p \0.001) as well as
increases in hip and spine bone mineral densitometry from base-
line to week 48 (mean percent change +1.47 and +2.29, respec-
tively, p\0.05)91; with similar findings to 96 weeks.92
Whether these findings translate into improved long-term
clinical outcomes in CHB patients remains to be defined, but an
optimised safety profile of long-term NA therapy might be pre-
ferred, particularly in an ageing CHB population, with accruing
co-morbidities. Thus, in CHB patients with deteriorating renal
function or low eGFR and/or osteopenia/osteoporosis, particularly
in older age, the minimisation of progression of the physiological
decline into pathological abnormality should also be considered
when choosing NA therapy (Table 5). In such subgroups of CHB
patients, both ETV and TAF represent suitable choices with TAF
having an advantage in patients with previous exposure to LAM.
Long-term outcome during NA
Recommendations
� Patients under effective long-term NA therapy should
remain under surveillance for HCC (Evidence level II-2,
grade of recommendation 1).
� HCC surveillance is mandatory for all patients with cir-
rhosis as well as those with moderate or high HCC risk
scores at the onset of NA therapy (Evidence level II-2,
grade of recommendation 1).
Long-term ETV or TDF monotherapy has been shown to halt
progression of liver disease, and can also result in a significant
improvement of histological necroinflammation and fibrosis,

 often with a regression of established cirrhosis.1,34 Moreover,
complications of pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis, particu-
larly at an early stage of decompensation, improve or even disap-
pear and the need for liver transplantation is dramatically
reduced.1
HCC may still develop and remains the major concern for CHB
patients treated with NAs.24,25 Long-term therapy with NAs
appears to favourably impact HCC incidence when data from ran-
domised or matched controlled studies are considered.24,25 After
the first 5 years of ETV or TDF therapy in CHB patients, recent
data suggest that the HCC incidence is decreasing further, with
the decrease being more evident in patients with baseline cirrho-
sis.93 In addition, HCC seems to be the only factor affecting long-
term survival in ETV or TDF treated CHB patients with or without
compensated cirrhosis.94 Since NAs are used in the majority of
CHB patients because of their favourable effects on the overall
long-term outcome, the main clinical challenge is to identify
the patients at risk of HCC who require close surveillance. The
Asian HCC risk scores, GAG-HCC, CU-HCC and REACH-B, have
been validated in treated Asian CHB patients,25 however the
PAGE-B score is the only one that offers good predictability for
HCC in Caucasian treated CHB patients.28 Based on the HCC risk
scores, patients can be classified into those at low, medium and
high risk of HCC. Patients in the low HCC risk group have no or
negligible probability of HCC development and therefore may
not require HCC surveillance.25,28
Despite the remaining risk of developing HCC, the overall
survival improves in patients under long-term effective NA(s)
therapy.1,39,94–96 Loss of HBsAg during long-term NA therapy
may occur in a minority of CHB patients who were initially
HBeAg-positive (approximately 10–12% after 5–8 years of ther-
apy) while is rare in patients with HBeAg-negative CHB (\1–2%
after 5–8 years of therapy).1,83
NA discontinuation
Recommendations
� NAs should be discontinued after confirmed HBsAg loss,
with or without anti-HBs seroconversion (Evidence level
II-2, grade of recommendation 1).
� NAs can
be
discontinued
in
non-cirrhotic HBeAg-
positive CHB patients who achieve stable HBeAg sero-
conversion and undetectable HBV DNA and who com-
plete at least 12 months of consolidation therapy.
Close post-NA monitoring is warranted (Evidence level
II-2, grade of recommendation 2).
� Discontinuation of NAs in selected non-cirrhotic HBeAg-
negative
patients
who
have
achieved
long-term
(P3 years) virological suppression under NA(s) may be
considered if close post-NA monitoring can be guaran-
teed (Evidence level II-2, grade of recommendation 2).

 Since NA therapy does not usually achieve HBV eradication
and rarely results even in HBsAg loss,83 long-term therapeutic
regimens are given in the majority of NA treated CHB patients.
A widely accepted stopping rule exists only for a proportion of
patients with HBeAg-positive CHB who can discontinue NAs if
they achieve HBeAg seroconversion and HBV DNA undetectability
and have completed 6 or preferentially 12 months of ensuing
consolidation therapy.1,56 According to the existing data, HBeAg
seroconversion will remain in the majority (approximately 90%)
and
virological
remission
defined
as
HBV
DNA
\2,000–
20,000 IU/ml will be maintained in �50% of such patients at
3 years after NAs cessation.41 Alternatively, clinicans may choose
to continue NA therapy until HBsAg clearance, which represents
the safest current treatment endpoint.1
Long-term, perhaps indefinite, NA therapy is usually given in
HBeAg-negative CHB patients, who are considered to be able to
safely stop NAs only if they achieve HBsAg loss.1 Recent evidence,
accumulating mainly from Asian countries, in which NAs can be
discontinued in HBeAg-negative CHB patients who achieve serum
HBV DNA undetectability on three separate occasions 6 months
apart,97 suggests that the discontinuation of NAs might be also
feasible in this setting. An important factor affecting the probabil-
ity of off-NA virological remission appears to be the duration of
on-therapy HBV DNA undetectability.41 According to the existing
data,
virological
remission
defined
as
HBV
DNA \2,000–
20,000 IU/ml will be maintained in approximately 50% of such
patients 3 years after NAs cessation if they have remained for
more than two years on virological remission during therapy.41
Since such findings are based on studies with durations of on-
therapy virological remission of[2 to 5 years,41 the optimal dura-
tion of on NAs remission before discontinuation remains unclear.
Since overt hepatitis flares and life-threatening episodes have
been rarely reported in patients with pre-existing cirrhosis who
discontinue NAs,98 treatment discontinuation is currently dis-
couraged in patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, NAs may be discon-
tinued only in patients who can be followed closely with ALT and
HBV DNA determinations at least during the first year following
NAs cessation. Unfortunately, no reliable predictor of post-NAs
remission has been identified to date. Retreatment criteria are also
important, but have yet to be determined.41 Based on reasonable
clinical judgment, treatment indications for naïve CHB patients
may be also applied in patients who discontinue NAs.
Management of patients with NA failure
Recommendations
� Prevention of resistance should rely on the use of first
line
therapy
with
high
barrier
to
resistance
NAs
(Evidence level I, grade of recommendation 1).
� Compliance to NA therapy should be checked in all cases
of treatment failure (Evidence level II-1, grade of recom-
mendation 1).
� Management of treatment failure should be based on
NAs cross-resistance data (Evidence level II-2, grade of
recommendation 1).
� Treatment adaptation should be performed as soon as
virologic failure under NAs is confirmed (Evidence level
II-1, grade of recommendation 1).
Preventing the emergence of resistance is based on the use of
NAs with high barrier to resistance and maximal viral suppres-
sion as a first line therapy (Fig. 3). The combination of NAs with
low barrier to resistance, such as LAM or TBV with ADV, should
be avoided, as this may lead to inappropriate viral suppression
and the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. In addition,
sequential monotherapies with agents with a low barrier to resis-
tance should be strictly avoided because of the high risk of
emerging multidrug resistance strains.99
Managing NA failures in CHB patients remains a crucial issue
in countries in which ETV, TDF and TAF are not available or fully
reimbursed for naïve patients or treatment experienced patients.
By contrast, in countries where NAs with a high barrier to resis-
tance have been routinely used for many years, the impact of
treatment failures has become minimal. Treatment failure can
be defined as primary non-response, partial virological response
and
virological
breakthrough
(see
section
‘Definitions
of
response’).100
Primary non-response. In patients with primary non-response
to any NA, it is important to check for compliance. Poor compli-
ance is now the main cause of primary non-response. In a compli-
ant patient with a primary non-response, genotyping of HBV
strains for identifying possible resistance mutations may help
in formulating a rescue strategy. Primary non-response is almost
exclusively seen with ADV because of suboptimal antiviral
potency and should lead to a rapid switch to TDF or ETV.
Partial virological response. Partial virological response may be
encountered with all available NAs. It is always important to
check for compliance. If patients receive NA with low barrier to
resistance (LAM, ADV, TBV), it is recommended to change to a
more potent drug without cross-resistance. Most of the time, par-
tial virological response under ETV or TDF is associated with a
very high pretreatment viral load and not the result of a lack of
efficacy but rather of the potency limit of the antiviral drug. In
such patients with a partial virological response at week 48, the
HBV DNA levels at week 48 and their kinetics must be taken into
account. Patients with declining serum HBV DNA levels may con-
tinue treatment with the same agent given the rise in rates of
virological response over time and the very low risk of resistance
with long-term monotherapy with both agents. It can be assumed
that the same applies to TAF. In those with plateauing levels of

 HBV DNA a switch to the other drug or a combination of ETV
+ TDF/TAF can be envisaged especially in patients with advanced
liver disease (see section ‘Long-term outcome during NA’).
Virological breakthrough. Virological breakthrough in compli-
ant patients is mainly related to the development of HBV drug
resistance. The rate of virological breakthrough depends on the
barrier to resistance of the NA. Treatment adaptation should be
performed as soon as viral breakthrough is identified and con-
firmed one month apart to prevent a further increase in viral load,
subsequent ALT elevation and progression of liver disease includ-
ing the risk of liver failure.99,100
Management of antiviral drug resistance
Although a concern, antiviral drug resistance has become a man-
ageable issue. The risk of resistance is associated with high base-
line HBV DNA levels, a slow decline in HBV DNA and a previous
suboptimal NA treatment. Resistance should be identified by
HBV DNA monitoring and ideally identification of the pattern of
resistance mutations should be used to adapt treatment strategy.
In case of resistance, an appropriate rescue therapy should be
initiated with the most effective antiviral agent that does not
share cross-resistance to minimise the risk of inducing multiple
drug-resistant strains. Table 6 shows cross-resistance data for
the most frequent resistant variants. Table 7 shows the recom-
mendations for treatment adaptation.99,100 In patients with mul-
tidrug
resistance,
genotypic
resistance
testing
should
be
performed by a reference laboratory. Combination of TDF with
ETV has been evaluated in several clinical studies and appears
to be a safe option as a rescue therapy.101–104
PegIFNa monotherapy for CHB patients
Efficacy
Recommendations
� PegIFNa can be considered as an initial treatment
option for patients with mild to moderate HBeAg-
positive or -negative CHB (Evidence level I, grade of
recommendation 2).
� The standard duration of PegIFNa therapy is 48 weeks
(Evidence level I, grade of recommendation 1).
� The extension of the duration of PegIFNa therapy
beyond week 48 may be beneficial in selected HBeAg-
negative CHB patients (Evidence level II-1, grade of rec-
ommendation 2).
Only patients with mild to moderate CHB and perhaps
selected patients with compensated cirrhosis but no portal
hypertension should be considered for PegIFNa therapy (Table 2).
In HBeAg-positive CHB patients, response rates at 6 months fol-
lowing 12 months of PegIFNa therapy are 20–30% (Table 3).
Although most patients respond with HBeAg loss or seroconver-
sion during the first 6 months of therapy, a 6 month course of
PegIFNa and/or a lower dose are inferior to the recommended
12 month course. A combined endpoint of HBeAg loss with HBV
DNA \2,000 IU/ml at 6 months post-treatment was achieved in
23% in a meta-analysis of three large trials105 (Table 3). Among
patients who achieved HBeAg loss at 6 months post-treatment,
HBeAg negativity was sustained 3 years post-treatment in 81%.
Rates of HBsAg loss following 12 months of treatment are 3–7%.
HBsAg loss rates increase after the end of PegIFNa therapy in ini-
tially HBeAg-positive CHB patients with sustained virological
responses (Table 3). Of the patients with an initial HBeAg loss,
30% experienced HBsAg loss after 3 years of follow-up. The sus-
tainability of HBsAg loss and seroconversion after PegIFNa is
good although HBsAg seroreversions have been described.62,106
In HBeAg-negative CHB patients, the 48-week PegIFNa regis-
trational trial showed sustained biochemical and virological
response rates of 60% and 44% at 6 months and of 31% and 28%
at 3 years after the end of therapy1,107 (Table 4). PegIFNa was less
effective in HBeAg-negative patients with genotype D or E, who
had sustained virological responses in the range of 20%. Few real
life studies have addressed the efficacy of PegIFNa in HBeAg-
negative CHB patients with genotype B or C. In a retrospective
Korean
study,
approximately
30%
of
genotype
C
HBeAg-
negative patients achieved virological response at 1 year after
the end of PegIFNa.1,108
HBsAg loss rarely occurred during PegIFNa therapy in HBeAg-
negative CHB patients, but the rate of HBsAg loss progressively
increased after PegIFNa discontinuation, from 3% at month 6 to
9% at year 3 to 12% at year 5 in the registrational trial1 (Table 4).
Similar rates were confirmed by real life studies.1,107 Overall,
among sustained responders, approximately 30% clear HBsAg in
the long-term.
Two studies assessed the safety and efficacy of extending the
duration of PegIFNa therapy beyond 48 weeks in HBeAg-negative
CHB patients. In a European randomised trial with predominantly
genotype D patients, 96 compared to 48 weeks of PegIFNa ther-
apy achieved higher rates of sustained virological response (29%
vs. 12%, p = 0.03) and HBsAg loss (6% vs. 0%).109 Similarly, a Chi-
nese study including HBeAg-negative CHB patients with geno-
type B or C showed that 72 compared to 48 weeks of PegIFNa
resulted in higher rates of sustained virological response (50%
vs. 16%, p = 0.001) and HBsAg loss (36% vs. 10%, p\0.05).110
Monitoring of patients treated with PegIFNa
Recommendations
� All CHB patients treated with PegIFNa should be fol-
lowed with periodical assessments of at least full blood
count, ALT, TSH, serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels (Evi-
dence level I/II-2, grade of recommendation 1).
� HBeAg-positive CHB patients treated with PegIFNa
should be also followed with periodical assessments of
HBeAg and anti-HBe (Evidence level I, grade of recom-
mendation 1).
� CHB patients with virological response after PegIFNa
therapy should remain under long-term follow-up
because of the risk of relapse (Evidence level II-2, grade
of recommendation 1).
In patients treated with PegIFNa, full blood counts and serum
ALT levels should be monitored monthly and TSH should be
monitored every 3 months.1 All patients should be monitored for
safety through 12 months of treatment. Serum HBV DNA and
HBsAg levels in all CHB patients and HBeAg and anti-HBe in

Journal of Hepatology 2017 vol. xxx j xxx–xxx
 HBeAg-positive CHB patients should be checked at 3, 6 and
12 months of PegIFNa treatment and at 6 and 12 months post-
treatment. Sustained serum HBV DNA\2,000 IU/ml, or even better
HBsAg loss, together with ALT normalisation in all CHB patients as
well as with HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive CHB
patients are the desired treatment endpoints. Sustained virological
response after PegIFNa is usually associated with remission of the
liver disease, but all such patients require long-term follow-up
because of the risk of exacerbation with development of HBeAg-
negative CHB or even of HBeAg seroreversion in initially HBeAg-
positive patients. The risk of HBV reactivation seems to diminish
over time. In patients with undetectable HBV DNA (and negative
HBeAg), HBsAg should be checked at 12 month intervals, as the
rate of HBsAg loss increases over time. Patients who become
HBsAg-negative should be tested for anti-HBs.
Predictors of PegIFNa response and stopping rules
Recommendations
� In
HBeAg-positive
CHB
patients,
HBsAg
levels
[20,000 IU/ml for genotype B and C, or no decline of
HBsAg levels for genotype A and D, at 12 weeks of
PegIFNa therapy are associated with a very low proba-
bility of subsequent HBeAg seroconversion and can be
used as PegIFNa stopping rules (Evidence level II-2,
grade of recommendation 2).
� In HBeAg-positive CHB patients with genotype A-D,
HBsAg levels [20,000 IU/ml at 24 weeks of PegIFNa
therapy are associated with a very low probability of
subsequent HBeAg seroconversion and can be used as
PegIFNa stopping rules (Evidence level II-2, grade of rec-
ommendation 2).
� In HBeAg-negative CHB patients with genotype D, a
combination
of
no
decrease
in
HBsAg
levels
and
\2 log10 IU/ml reduction in serum HBV DNA levels at
12 weeks of PegIFNa therapy predicts no response and
should be used as PegIFNa stopping rules (Evidence
level II-2, grade of recommendation 1).
Pretreatment. In HBeAg-positive CHB patients, pretreatment
predictors of response are low viral load, high serum ALT levels
(above 2–5 times ULN), HBV genotype and high activity scores
on liver biopsy. HBV genotypes A and B have been shown to be
associated with higher rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg
loss than genotypes C and D.
In HBeAg-negative CHB patients, high baseline ALT, low base-
line HBV DNA, younger age, female gender and HBV genotype
were independent predictors of response to PegIFNa therapy
but the negative and positive values of these variables are low.
Patients with genotypes B or C had a better chance of response
than genotype D patients.1 Using pooled data from several stud-
ies of PegIFNa therapy in HBeAg-negative CHB patients, a base-
line score system (ranging from 0–7) that combined five
variables (HBV genotype, HBV DNA, ALT, HBsAg levels and age)
identified patients with high and low likelihood of response,
but this score has not been validated yet.111,112 Baseline host
genetic testing to prioritize CHB patients for PegIFNa therapy is
not currently recommended in clinical practice, as the initial
promising
results
were
not
confirmed
in
subsequent
studies.113,114
During treatment. The most important on-treatment predictor
of response to PegIFNa is serum HBsAg levels,105 although they
are influenced by HBV genotype.115 In HBeAg-positive CHB
patients, a decline of HBsAg levels below 1,500 IU/ml at 12 weeks
is a reasonable predictor of HBeAg seroconversion (positive pre-
dictive value: 50%), while HBsAg levels [20,000 IU/ml for HBV
genotype B and C or no decline of HBsAg levels for HBV genotype
A and D are associated with a very low probability of subsequent
HBeAg seroconversion105 (Fig. 4). At week 24 HBsAg levels
[20,000 IU/ml
predict
no
response
regardless
of
genotype
(Fig. 4). A substantial HBV DNA decrease at 12 weeks has been
associated with a 50% chance of HBeAg seroconversion. Also,
HBeAg levels and immunologically induced ALT flares followed
by a HBV DNA decrease are associated with more frequent HBeAg
seroconversion. However, clinically meaningful cut-offs for HBV
DNA and HBeAg levels as a tool for on-treatment response predic-
tion have not been reported, these are based on validated studies
using adequate outcomes.116
In HBeAg-negative CHB patients, a combination of a lack of
decrease in HBsAg levels and \2 log10 IU/ml decline in HBV
DNA at 12 weeks of PegIFNa predicts a no response in genotype
D patients (negative predictive value: 100%) (Fig. 4). This stop-
ping rule would allow approximately 20% of patients to discon-
tinue PegIFNa.1,117,118 No robust on-treatment stopping rules
have been developed for HBeAg-negative CHB patients with
genotype B or C and very few data are available for those
with genotype A and E.118 Some studies have also looked for

 on-treatment positive predictors of sustained response. For
HBeAg-negative CHB patients with non-D genotype, a P10%
decline in serum HBsAg from baseline to week 12 of PegIFNa
treatment had a higher probability of achieving a sustained
response than those with a \10% decline (47% vs. 16%, p \0.01)
but the positive predictive value was low (�50%).107
Safety of PegIFNa
PegIFNa therapy is associated with considerable side effects
although patients with HBV infection seem to tolerate it reason-
ably well because they are often younger and have less comor-
bidity than patients who were treated with this agent in the
setting of HCV infection.1 The most frequently reported side
effects are flu-like syndrome, myalgia, headache, fatigue, weight
loss, depression, hair loss and local reactions at the site of injec-
tion. Hepatitis flares may occur which can result in decompensa-
tion of liver disease, therefore PegIFNa is contraindicated in
patients with decompensated cirrhosis. PegIFNa treatment is also
associated with mild myelosuppression, but neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia
are
usually
well
managed
with
dose-
reduction and only rarely result in clinically significant infection
or bleeding. The combination of PegIFNa with telbivudine is con-
traindicated due to a high risk of neuropathy.
Long-term outcome after PegIFNa
Recommendation
� Patients with sustained responses after PegIFNa therapy
and high baseline HCC risk should remain under surveil-
lance for HCC even if they achieve HBsAg loss (Evidence
level III, grade of recommendation 1).
The majority of patients who achieve sustained off-treatment
responses
after
IFNa
or
PegIFNa
therapy
maintains
such
responses during long-term follow-up of at least 5 years.119 In
sustained responders, there is no progression of liver disease
and baseline liver histological lesions improve.1 HCC may still
develop after PegIFNa therapy, even in patients with sustained
off-treatment responses, particularly in those with pre-existing
cirrhosis.120 The benefit from PegIFNa therapy on the HCC
incidence seems to be more clear in Asian patients120 and per-
haps superior than that of NA therapy.121 In addition, old cohort
studies with standard IFNa and systematic reviews show that the
incidence of HCC is decreased in IFNa treated compared to
untreated CHB patients, with such an effect being clearer in Asian
patients and those with sustained off-treatment responses and/or
compensated cirrhosis.1,24 Cohort studies in both HBeAg-positive
and HBeAg-negative CHB have shown that courses of standard
IFNa treatment result in improved overall long-term outcomes
including survival in patients with sustained off-treatment
responses.1 Survival data are not available for PegIFNa therapy,
but the same favourable outcomes are expected if sustained
off-treatment responses are achieved. Rates of HBsAg loss in sus-
tained responders are gradually increasing approaching 50% at
5 years after the end of therapy.119
Combination therapy for CHB
NA plus NA
Recommendations
� De novo combination therapy with two NAs with high
barrier to resistance (ETV, TDF, TAF) is not recom-
mended (Evidence level I, grade of recommendation 1).
� In treatment-adherent patients with incomplete sup-
pression of HBV replication reaching a plateau during
either ETV or TDF/TAF long-term therapy, a switch to
the other drug or combining both drugs may be consid-
ered (Evidence level III, grade of recommendation 2).
There have been only a few studies evaluating the role of de
novo combination therapy with potent NAs in treatment naïve
chronic HBV infection. In a large prospective multicentre study,
HBeAg-positive and –negative CHB patients were randomised
to either ETV or ETV plus TDF.122 The primary endpoint (HBV
DNA \50 IU/ml at week 96) was reached in 76% and 83% of
patients treated with mono- or combination therapy, respectively
(p = 0.088). In the subgroup of HBeAg-positive patients, ETV/TDF
combination achieved significantly higher rates of HBV DNA
\50 IU/ml (80% vs. 70%, p = 0.046), which was entirely attributa-
ble to the HBeAg-positive subgroup with baseline HBV DNA
levels P108 IU/ml (79% vs. 62%). However, no difference was
found in the rate of HBeAg seroconversions. None of the patients
developed resistance, whereas ALT normalisation was observed
more frequently in the ETV monotherapy group (82% vs. 69%).
This combination did not provide added value in terms of HBsAg
kinetics.123
In a second double-blind study, HBeAg-positive treatment
naïve patients with high HBV DNA and normal ALT levels were
randomly assigned to either TDF plus placebo or a combination
of TDF plus emtricitabine for 192 weeks.124 At week 192, 55%
and 76% of patients in the TDF monotherapy and the combination
group respectively reached the primary endpoint, which was HBV
DNA \69 IU/ml (p = 0.016). Of those who did not meet the pri-
mary endpoint, the majority had low levels of ongoing HBV repli-
cation, with serum HBV DNA \500 IU/ml. However, HBeAg
seroconversion occurred in only 5% of patients (all in the
monotherapy group), while no patient developed HBV resistance.

 Although both of the above studies showed a higher percent-
age of complete HBV DNA suppression with NA combination
therapy in HBeAg-positive patients with high baseline viral load
(HBV
DNA [108 IU/ml),
the
differences
in
terms
of
on-
treatment HBV DNA levels and clinical/serological endpoints
observed with both strategies are not strong enough to recom-
mend de novo combination for this group of patients.
The optimal management of patients with incomplete sup-
pression of HBV replication during long-term treatment with
potent NAs (ETV, TDF or TAF) is still a matter of debate. In most
of these patients a continuous decline in HBV DNA levels can
be observed when continuing the same agent. This approach
has been shown to be safe, effective and has not been associated
with the development of drug resistance in large prospective
long-term studies.1,125 So far, there are also no convincing data
demonstrating that the presence of a minimal residual viremia
with HBV DNA levels \69 IU/ml may have any unfavourable
effects with respect to on-treatment disease progression or HCC
risk in patients without cirrhosis.126 We therefore do not recom-
mend changing the initial treatment strategy in patients with low
level and or declining HBV DNA concentrations on a potent NA
monotherapy.
However, in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, not
achieving a virologic response defined as HBV DNA \20 IU/ml
has been shown to be a significant risk factor for developing
HCC (HR = 7.74; 95% CI 1.34–44.78; p = 0.022) but not in those
with compensated cirrhosis (p = 0.749).127
The long-term consequences of on-treatment HBV DNA levels
plateauing above 69 IU/ml but being below 2,000 IU/ml are
unclear. As the above mentioned studies showed some advan-
tages of combining NAs in terms of HBV DNA suppression this
approach can be considered, and is especially recommended for
those with established cirrhosis. A recent retrospective study in
ETV (0.5 mg daily dose) treated patients with incomplete HBV
DNA response also showed that adding TDF is superior with
respect to viral suppression and ALT normalisation as compared
with continuing ETV monotherapy with either 0.5 mg or the
higher 1.0 mg daily dose.128,129 Switching to another potent NA
(i.e., from ETV to TDF/TAF or vice versa) may also sometimes lead
to an improved response.
NA plus PegIFNa
Recommendations
� De novo combination of NA and PegIFNa is not recom-
mended (Evidence level I, grade of recommendation 1).
� In treatment naïve HBeAg-positive patients, short-term
pretreatment with a NA before PegIFNa is not recom-
mended (Evidence level II, grade of recommendation 1).
� In long-term NA suppressed CHB patients, adding
PegIFNa or switching to PegIFNa is not recommended
(Evidence level II, grade of recommendation 1).
The combination of NA and PegIFNa has been used in treat-
ment naïve and NA suppressed CHB patients. For treatment naïve
patients, there is no robust evidence that a de novo combination
of PegIFNa and NA is superior compared to PegIFNa or NA alone.
Previous studies with LAM and or ADV combined with PegIFNa
failed to show an advantage of the combination therapy.1,130 In
a recent randomised controlled trial, the 72-week HBsAg loss
rates were superior in the PegIFNa and TDF treated patients com-
pared to those observed in patients receiving PegIFNa alone or
TDF alone (9% vs. 3% vs. 0%) but the overall rates were low and
mainly confined to genotype A patients.62,131 For treatment naïve
patients, there is also no robust evidence that short-term

 pretreatment with NA improves the rates of sustained response
to PegIFNa.130,132,133 The multicentre ARES study demonstrated
that a 24-week course of PegIFNa, given to a small group of
HBeAg-positive patients who were on ETV therapy for only
24 weeks, can improve the kinetics of HBeAg, HBV DNA and
HBsAg, compared to those on ETV monotherapy, but a PegIFNa
monotherapy arm was missing.134
In CHB patients under long-term effective virological remis-
sion by NA treatment, PegIFNa can be used as a ‘switch to’ or
‘add-on’ strategy. In HBeAg-positive CHB, two recent Chinese
studies assessed the efficacy and safety of switching to PegIFNa
for patients on long-term effective NA therapy. Following a 48-
week course of PegIFNa, 6–20% of patients cleared HBsAg. Base-
line
HBsAg
\1,500 IU/ml
predicted
the
serological
responses.135,136 Two additional Asian studies assessed whether
a 48-week course of add-on PegIFNa was superior to long-term
NA therapy in HBeAg-positive patients.137,138 While the HBsAg
decline was superior in the combination group, the HBsAg loss
rates did not increase significantly.
In HBeAg-negative CHB patients under NA treatment, two
multicentre European studies have assessed the safety and effi-
cacy of a 48-week add-on course of PegIFNa.139,140 These two
studies demonstrated that HBsAg kinetics were fostered by the
addition of PegIFNa, but only a few patients cleared HBsAg.
HBsAg levels at baseline and week 12 may predict HBsAg decline
and/or HBsAg loss. There are no studies assessing the safety and
efficacy of switching to PegIFNa monotherapy in HBeAg-negative
CHB patients under long-term NA therapy.
As all these studies of PegIFNa therapy in patients under long-
term NA therapy increase cost and side effects, this strategy
should be carefully assessed in each individual patient weighing
up all potential advantages and disadvantages.
Treatment of patients with decompensated cirrhosis
Recommendations
� Patients with decompensated cirrhosis should be imme-
diately treated with a NA with high barrier to resistance,
irrespective of the level of HBV replication, and should
be assessed for liver transplantation (Evidence level II-
1, grade of recommendation 1).
� PegIFNa is contraindicated in patients with decompen-
sated cirrhosis (Evidence level II-1, grade of recommen-
dation 1).
� Patients should be closely monitored for tolerability of
the drugs and the development of rare side effects like
lactic acidosis or kidney dysfunction (Evidence level II-
2, grade of recommendation 1).
Patients with decompensated cirrhosis should be referred for
liver transplantation and treated with NAs as early as possible,
with the goal of achieving complete viral suppression in the
shortest time possible. ETV or TDF are the preferred treatment
options and both drugs have been shown to be effective but also
generally safe in patients with decompensated disease.1,141–145
The licensed ETV dose for patients with HBV decompensated cir-
rhosis is 1 mg (instead of 0.5 mg for patients with compensated
liver disease) once daily. Less potent NAs are not recommended
as they have been demonstrated to have inferior outcomes as
compared to potent ones.141,146 Despite an overall high safety
profile, concerns remain that development of lactic acidosis in
patients with decompensated cirrhosis may be a class effect of
NAs, and close monitoring for adverse events is especially recom-
mended for patients with a MELD score[22 and impaired kidney
function.1,147 All NAs must be adjusted to renal function. Because
of its favourable safety profile, TAF might be also an interesting
treatment option in patients with decompensated disease, espe-
cially in those with kidney dysfunction. However, studies con-
cerning
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
TAF
in
these
patient
populations are lacking. PegIFNa is contraindicated in patients
with decompensated liver disease.
The main goal of NA treatment in patients with decompen-
sated liver disease is to achieve clinical recompensation and to
avoid liver transplantation.1,57 There is strong evidence that
antiviral therapy significantly modifies the natural history of
decompensated cirrhosis, improving liver function and increasing
survival.57,58,148 Meta-analyses demonstrated an overall and
transplant-free survival in NA treated patients of more than
80%, respectively.58,59 Approximately 35% of treated patients
can be delisted for liver transplantation, and an improvement
of Child-Pugh Score P2 observed in at least 40–50%. Patients
with early treatment initiation had better clinical outcomes than
those with delayed treatment.148 High baseline Child-Pugh or
MELD scores are predictors of poor survival meaning that the dis-
ease may have progressed beyond the point of no return.58,148–150
In contrast, an improvement in MELD or Child-Pugh score early
on-treatment
is
highly
predictive
of
transplant-free
sur-
vival.1,148,149 Undetectable HBV DNA levels can be achieved in
[80% after 1 year of treatment, and are associated with a lower
risk of HCC development.58,127,148 Lifelong treatment is recom-
mended for all patients with decompensated disease. Even under
effective NA therapy, the risk of developing HCC is high in these
patients, and therefore careful long-term HCC surveillance is
mandatory.1
Prevention of HBV recurrence after liver transplantation
Recommendations
� All patients on the transplant waiting list with HBV
related liver disease should be treated with NA (Evi-
dence level II, grade of recommendation 1).
� Combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and
a potent NA is recommended after liver transplantation
for the prevention of HBV recurrence (Evidence level II-
1, grade of recommendation 1).
� Patients with a low risk of recurrence can discontinue
HBIG but need continued monoprophylaxis with a
potent NA (Evidence level II-1, grade of recommenda-
tion 2).
� HBsAg-negative patients receiving livers from donors
with evidence of past HBV infection (anti-HBc positive)
are at risk of HBV recurrence and should receive antivi-
ral prophylaxis with a NA (Evidence level II-2, grade of
recommendation 1).
Clinical Practice Guidelines

Journal of Hepatology 2017 vol. xxx j xxx–xxx
 Before the advent of NA therapy, recurrent HBV infection in
liver transplantation was a major problem.151 All putative
patients for liver transplantation should therefore be treated with
NA therapy with the aim of achieving an undetectable HBV DNA
level.1 NA therapy in combination with HBIG reduces the risk of
graft infection to \5%.1,151 Potent NA therapy allows a more effi-
cient combination treatment with synergistic effects and better
tolerability with the aim of achieving anti-HBs levels of P50–
100 IU/L. In selected patients (i.e., HBV DNA negative at liver
transplantation), a short course or HBIG free regimens can be
considered.151 In selected patients, ETV prophylaxis without
HBIG has been shown to be safe and effective in preventing
HBV recurrence.152 Conversely, lifelong combination therapy
should be given to patients who are at a high risk for HBV recur-
rence, namely those who are HBV DNA positive at the time of
liver transplantation, who are HBeAg-positive, have HCC, and
HDV or HIV co-infection.153–155 In the setting of liver transplan-
tation, nephrotoxicity should always be considered and renal
function should be carefully monitored because of the concomi-
tant use of calcineurin inhibitors.
When the immune system is therapeutically suppressed in
the context of liver transplantation, there is potential for HBV
reactivation in HBsAg-negative patients receiving donor organs
with evidence of past HBV infection (anti-HBc positive). These
patients usually receive receive lifelong LAM prophylaxis.156
Treatment in special patient groups with HBV infection
HIV co-infected patients
Recommendations
� All HIV-positive patients with HBV co-infection should
start antiretroviral therapy (ART) irrespective of CD4 cell
count (Evidence level II-2, grade of recommendation 1).
� HIV-HBV co-infected patients should be treated with a
TDF- or TAF-based ART regimen (Evidence level I for
TDF, II-1 for TAF, grade of recommendation 1).
European and American guidelines on the management of HIV
infected patients recommend the initiation of ART in HIV/HBV co-
infected patients irrespective of CD4 cell count due to the
increased risk of fibrosis progression, cirrhosis and HCC.157,158
All persons with HIV/HBV co-infection should receive ART includ-
ing either TDF or TAF, which have antiviral activity against HIV
and HBV. Stopping TDF- or TAF-containing ART should be avoided
in persons with HIV/HBV co-infection because of the high risk of
severe hepatitis flares and decompensation following HBV reacti-
vation hepatitis. Drug toxicity (renal, bone density, liver) should
be closely monitored during ART. ETV represents an alternative
anti-HBV treatment without a strong activity against HIV.157 At
present, limited data exists on the use of TAF in HIV/HBV co-
infected patients. In 72 HIV/HBV co-infected patients with a
stable suppression of HIV and HBV DNA, switching ART from a
TDF- to a TAF-containing regimen maintained HIV and HBV
suppression in [90% of patients, with improved eGFR and bone
density parameters.159 Persons with liver cirrhosis and low CD4
count require careful surveillance in the first months after start-
ing ART in order not to overlook immune reconstitution syn-
drome and subsequent liver decompensation due to flares of
liver enzymes.158 Because TDF, TAF and possibly also ETV
monotherapy can cause HIV resistance mutations, all HBsAg-
positive patients should be screened for HIV before these drugs
are used in the treatment of HBV infection.
HDV co-infected patients
Recommendations
� PegIFNa for at least 48 weeks is the current treatment of
choice in HDV-HBV co-infected patients with compen-
sated liver disease (Evidence level I, grade of recommen-
dation 1).
� In HDV-HBV co-infected patients with ongoing HBV
DNA replication, NA therapy should be considered
(Evidence level II-2, grade of recommendation 1).
� PegIFNa treatment can be continued until week 48 irre-
spective of on-treatment response pattern if well toler-
ated (Evidence level II-2, grade of recommendation 2).
At present, PegIFNa is the only available drug that has been
proven to have some antiviral efficacy against chronic HDV infec-
tion.1,160 Studies applying PegIFNa showed on-treatment viro-
logic response rates of about 17–47%.1 The rate of HDV RNA
negativity 24 weeks after treatment cessation was, however,
rather low (approximately 25%), and late relapses of HDV replica-
tion beyond week 24 after stopping therapy occurred in more
than 50% of the responder patients, thus challenging the concept
of sustained virologic response in HDV-HBV co-infection.161
Hence, long-term follow-up HDV RNA monitoring is recom-
mended for all treated patients as long as HBsAg is present in
serum. HBsAg loss may develop in the long-term follow-up in
approximately 10% of PegIFNa patients and can be taken as a
marker of cure from HDV infection.161,162
Several studies tried to increase efficacy by increasing treat-
ment duration.163,164 However, clear evidence is lacking to confirm
that this approach is beneficial for most chronically HDV infected
patients. Even after 96 weeks of PegIFNa therapy, alone or in com-
bination with TDF, 24-week post-therapy relapses occurred in 36–
39% of the patients with on-treatment response.165
The likelihood of the long-term response to PegIFNa can be
estimated to some extent by HDV RNA and HBsAg kinetics at
weeks 12 and 24.164,166–169 However, stopping PegIFNa prema-
turely at this stage is not recommended, if treatment is well tol-
erated, as the negative predictive values of these markers are not
very strong, and late responses may occur in patients with early
non-response. Furthermore, long-term follow-up studies suggest
that an IFNa based therapy per se can be taken as an independent
factor associated with a lower likelihood of disease progression,
and to develop clinical endpoints.162,170
Neither NAs nor ribavirin showed significant effects on HDV
RNA levels in patients with HDV infection.1 Although HDV is

 often the predominant virus in this co-infection, considerable
fluctuating activity of HDV and HBV or both viruses, including
alternating predominance can be seen during the natural history
of this chronic co-infection.1 NA treatment is recommended for
those patients with HBV DNA levels being persistently above
2,000 IU/ml, and might be considered in order to block residual
HBV replication in those with advanced liver disease. In patients
with decompensated liver disease, PegIFNa should not be used
and these patients should be evaluated for liver transplantation.
NA should be considerd in all patients with decompensated dis-
ease if HBV DNA is detectable.
HCV co-infected patients
Recommendations
� Treatment of HCV with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)
may cause reactivation of HBV. Patients fulfilling the
standard criteria for HBV treatment should receive
NA treatment (Evidence level II, grade of recommenda-
tion 1).
� HBsAg-positive
patients
undergoing
DAA
therapy
should be considered for concomitant NA prophylaxis
until
week
12
post
DAA,
and
monitored
closely
(Evidence level II-2, grade of recommendation 2).
� HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc positive patients undergoing
DAA should be monitored and tested for HBV reactiva-
tion in case of ALT elevation (Evidence level II, grade
of recommendation 1).
In patients with chronic HBV infection, HCV co-infection
accelerates liver disease progression and increases the risk of
HCC.1,171,172 Therefore, all chronic HBV patients should be
screened
for
HCV
as
well
as
for
other
blood
bourne
viruses.1,171,173
With the advent of effective DAA therapy, uptake of antiviral
therapy for HCV is increasing rapidly. Sustained virological
response rates for HCV in HBV and HCV co-infected patients are
comparable with those in HCV mono-infected patients.173 There
is a potential risk of HBV reactivation during DAAs therapy or
after clearance of HCV. It must be noted that most patients with
HCV/HBV co-infection, and advanced disease should be on effec-
tive NA therapy. Following a series of case reports, the US Food
and Drug Administration has now issued a warning about the risk
of HBV reactivating in some patients treated with DAAs for HCV.
They identified 24 cases of HBV reactivation in HCV/HBV co-
infected patients treated with DAAs during a 31-month period
from November 2013 to July 2016.174–177 More recent data con-
firms the risk of HBV reactivation associated with DAA therapy. In
one publication, out of 103 patients with evidence of previous
HBV exposure (HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc positive) undergoing
DAA therapy, none experienced reactivation.178 In another publi-
cation, 3 out of 10 patients with HBsAg-positive status demon-
strated significant reactivation with two significant clinical
events.
Out of the 327 patients treated with DAA therapy, 124 had
evidence of anti-HBc with none experiencing any clinical or viro-
logical sequelae.179
Acute hepatitis B
Recommendations
� More than 95% of adults with acute HBV hepatitis do not
require specific treatment, because they will fully
recover spontaneously (Evidence level II-2, grade of
recommendation 1).
� Only patients with severe acute hepatitis B, charac-
terised by coagulopathy or protracted course, should
be treated with NA and considered for liver transplanta-
tion (Evidence level II-2, grade of recommendation 1).
In patients with acute hepatitis B, preventing the risk of
acute or subacute liver failure is the main treatment goal.
Improving quality of life by shortening the disease associated
symptoms as well as lowering the risk of chronicity can be also
regarded as relevant goals of treatment. As outlined in the nat-
ural course of disease, acute HBV infection will recover clinically
and virologically including seroconversion to anti-HBs without
antiviral therapy in more than 95% of adults. A potentially
life-threatening disease manifestation is severe or fulminant
acute hepatitis B. Characteristics of severe acute hepatitis B
are coagulopathy (most studies defined this as international
normalised ratio [INR] [1.5), or a protracted course (i.e., persis-
tent symptoms or marked jaundice for [4 weeks), or signs of
acute liver failure.107,180 Although randomised controlled trials
are lacking, several cohort studies indicate that the early antivi-
ral therapy with highly potent NAs can prevent progression to
acute liver failure and subsequently liver transplantation or
mortality.107,181 This effect, however, is not seen if antiviral
therapy is initiated late in the course of severe acute hepatitis
B in patients with already manifested acute liver failure and
advanced hepatic encephalopathy.182 Data supports the use of
TDF, ETV or even LAM. One single-center retrospective analysis
from Hong Kong reported a higher short-term mortality in
patients with acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B (not pri-
mary hepatitis B infection) upon treatment with ETV compared
to historic controls treated with LAM.183 Large case series, how-
ever, support that TDF, ETV or LAM can be safely used in acute
severe hepatitis B.181,184 In principle, TAF should be also effec-
tive in this setting, but no data are currently available on the
use of TAF in severe acute hepatitis B. The use of glucocorticoids
in acute severe hepatitis B is supported by older studies, but
these studies in most cases did not include current antiviral
drugs.185 The management of acute liver failure and the indica-
tion for liver transplantation are discussed in detail in separate
EASL CPGs.151,180 Early NA treatment does not increase the risk
of chronicity181,186; in fact, observational data from a multicen-
tre cohort even indicated reduced rates of chronicity, if NA
treatment was initiated within 8 weeks of acute hepatitis B pre-
sentation in genotype A infected individuals.187

 Children
Recommendations
� In children, the course of the disease is generally mild,
and
most
of
the
children do
not
meet
standard
treatment
indications.
Thus,
treatment
should
be
considered with caution (Evidence level II-3, grade of
recommendation 1).
� In children or adolescents who meet treatment criteria,
ETV, TDF, TAF, and PegIFNa can be used in this popula-
tion (Evidence level II-2, grade of recommendation 2).
Chronic HBV infection runs an asymptomatic course in most
children, but the lifetime risk of significant clinical complications
is not negligible. Since the World Health Organization recom-
mended global HBV vaccination, the incidence of HBV in children
has declined worldwide.188 Issues around the characterisation of
the phase of chronic HBV infection, and the indications for treat-
ment, exist in the paediatric population as well, compounded by
an enhanced requirement for safety, and thus extrapolation from
adult strategies may be unhelpful. Treatment indications should
be carefully evaluated,1 and other co-morbidities, such as non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease considered. Overall, a conservative
approach is warranted. A joint EASL-ESPHAGN review provides
a detailed relevant review.189,190
Conventional IFNa, LAM, ADV, ETV and TDF have been evalu-
ated for safety and efficacy in children, which were comparable to
adults.1,190 In a study including adolescents 12 to \18 years old
with
HBeAg-positive
and
negative
chronic
HBV
hepatitis,
72 weeks of TDF compared to placebo achieved significantly
higher rates of virological response (HBV DNA \400 copies/ml:
89% vs. 0%, p\0.001) and ALT normalisation (74% vs. 31%,
p\0.001), but similarly low HBeAg clearance rates. TDF proved
safe and no patient developed resistance. Another recent study
with ETV in adolescents confirmed no improvement in HBeAg
seroconversion
rates
in
cases
with
normal
ALT
(\30 IU/
ml).188,189,191 ETV has also been studied in children between
the ages of 2–12.192
Healthcare workers
Recommendations
� HBV infection alone should not disqualify infected per-
sons from the practice or study of surgery, dentistry,
medicine, or allied health fields (Evidence level III, grade
of recommendation 1).
� Healthcare workers performing exposure prone proce-
dures with serum HBV DNA [200 IU/ml may be treated
with NA to reduce transmission risk (Evidence level II-2,
grade of recommendation 2).
According to the recommendations of Center for Disease Con-
trol (CDC), HBV infection alone should not disqualify infected
persons from the practice or study of surgery, dentistry, medi-
cine, or allied health fields.193 However, percutaneous injuries
sustained by healthcare personnel during certain surgical, obstet-
rical, and dental procedures provide a potential route of HBV
transmission to patients as well as providers.194 Thus, healthcare
workers may require antiviral therapy, even if they do not fulfill
the typical indications for treatment, to reduce direct transmis-
sion during exposure prone procedures to patients. Policies for
HBsAg-positive healthcare workers vary among countries. No
prospective clinical trials are available to demonstrate the effi-
cacy of antiviral treatment for preventing transmission by health-
care workers, but no HBV transmissions from healthcare workers
to patients have been reported, if the healthcare worker has
serum HBV DNA levels below 200 IU/ml. Thus, healthcare work-
ers, including surgeons, gynaecologists and dentists, who are
HBsAg-positive with HBV DNA [200 IU/ml may be treated with
a potent NA (i.e., ETV, TDF, TAF) to reduce levels of HBV DNA ide-
ally to undetectable or at least to \200 IU/ml (CDC recommenda-
tion:
\1,000 IU/ml;
recommendation
in
many
countries:
\2,000 IU/ml) before resuming exposure prone procedures.194
Monitoring for compliance and efficacy in practicing surgeons
is required. Healthcare workers performing exposure prone pro-
cedures that are not on antiviral treatment might be more fre-
quently retested, especially if they are tested around the HBV
DNA threshold, due to fluctuations in viremia.195 The long-term
safety, efficacy, complications and economic implications of such
a policy are unknown.
Pregnancy
Recommendations
� Screening for HBsAg in the first trimester of pregnancy
is strongly recommended (Evidence level 1, grade of
recommendation 1).
� In a woman of childbearing age without advanced
fibrosis who plans a pregnancy in the near future, it
may be prudent to delay therapy until the child is born
(Evidence level II-2, grade of recommendation 2).
� Pregnant women with CHB and advanced fibrosis or cir-
rhosis, therapy with TDF is recommended (Evidence
level II-2, grade of recommendation 1).
� In pregnant women already on NA therapy, TDF should
be continued while ETV or other NA should be switched
to TDF (Evidence level II-2, grade of recommendation 1).
� In all pregnant women with high HBV DNA levels
([200,000 IU/ml)
or
HBsAg
levels
[4 log10 IU/ml,
antiviral prophylaxis with TDF should start at week
24–28 of gestation and continue for up to 12 weeks after
delivery (Evidence level 1, grade of recommendation 1).
� Breast feeding is not contraindicated in HBsAg-positive
untreated
women
or
on
TDF-based
treatment
or
prophylaxis (Evidence level III, grade of recommenda-
tion 2).

 Family planning should always be discussed with women of
childbearing age before initiating HBV therapy. The woman
should be informed about the safety data of the HBV drugs on a
possible pregnancy.
PegIFNa is contraindicated during pregnancy. There are no
adequate and well-controlled studies of LAM, ADV and ETV in
pregnant women. Reproduction studies have been performed in
animal and in humans with TDF and TBV and revealed no evi-
dence of harm to the fetus due to these drugs.1 Among the last
two agents, TDF should be preferred, because it has a better resis-
tance profile and more extensive safety data in pregnant HBV
positive women.1,196–198
In a woman of childbearing age without advanced fibrosis
who plans a pregnancy in the near future, it may be prudent to
delay therapy until the child is born. In a woman of childbearing
age with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who agrees for a ‘‘planned
pregnancy’’ in the future, PegIFNa therapy may be tried as it is
given for a finite duration. It should be noted that effective con-
traception is required during PegIFNa therapy. If PegIFNa is not
possible or has failed, treatment with TDF has to be initiated
and maintained even during a future pregnancy.
If female patients become unexpectedly pregnant during HBV
therapy, treatment indications should be re-evaluated. The same
treatment indications apply to women who are first diagnosed to
have CHB during pregnancy. Patients with advanced fibrosis or
cirrhosis should definitely continue to be treated, but the treating
agent should be TDF.
The prevention of HBV perinatal transmission, which is consid-
ered to occur mainly at delivery, and causes the majority of
chronic HBV infection is based on the combination of HBIG and
vaccination given within 12 h of birth. This prophylaxis reduces
the rate of perinatal transmission from [90% to \10%.1 HBIG
and vaccine failures occur almost exclusively in HBeAg-positive
women with high HBV DNA levels ([200,000 IU/ml) and/or
HBsAg level above 4–4.5 log10 IU/ml.198–201 NA prophylaxis could
be also useful in the few HBeAg-negative women with high levels
of viremia but normal ALT levels.198–201 These mothers should be
informed that utilising a NA to reduce their viremia levels increase
the effectiveness to HBIG and vaccination. LAM, TBV or TDF
prophylaxis has been used in this setting during the last trimester
of pregnancy. Of them, TDF is the preferred agent due to its
characteristics mentioned previously. In a randomised study in
pregnant HBsAg-positive women with high HBV DNA levels
([200,000 IU/ml), the rate of mother to child HBV transmission
at post-partum week 28 was 0% in those treated with TDF
compared to 7% in the placebo control group per protocol analysis
having a similar safety profile.198 If NA therapy is given as
prophylaxis, i.e., only for the prevention of perinatal transmission,
its duration is not well defined (stopping at delivery or within the
first
3 months
after
delivery).
The
potential
advantage
of
stopping at delivery is no interference in breast feeding. In
addition, TDF ameliorated maternal ALT elevations which can
occur during pregnancy or early after delivery in untreated
mothers.202
The safety of NA therapy during lactation is uncertain. HBsAg
can be detected in breast milk, but breast feeding may not be
considered a contraindication in HBsAg-positive mothers. In
women treated with TDF, tenofovir concentrations in breast milk
have been reported but its oral bioavailability is limited and thus
infants are exposed to only small concentrations.
Patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy
Recommendations
� All candidates for chemotherapy and immunosuppres-
sive therapy should be tested for HBV markers prior to
immunosuppression (Evidence level I, grade of recom-
mendation 1).
� All HBsAg-positive patients should receive ETV or TDF or
TAF as treatment or prophylaxis (Evidence level II-2,
grade of recommendation 1).
� HBsAg-negative,
anti-HBc
positive
subjects
should
receive anti-HBV prophylaxis if they are at high risk of
HBV reactivation (Evidence level II-2, grade of recom-
mendation 1).
In HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc positive
patients receiving chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy,
including the established and emerging new biological response
modifiers, the risk of HBV reactivation can be high, particularly
if rituximab is given alone or in combination with steroids.1
The risk of HBV reactivation can be classified as high ([10%),
moderate (1–10%) or low (\1%).52,203 Therefore, all candidates
for chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy should be
screened for HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc prior to immunosup-
pression treatment.
Vaccination of HBV seronegative patients is recommended.
Higher doses or reinforced vaccine may be required to achieve
anti-HBs response in immunocompromised patients.1,107
HBsAg-positive
patients.
All
HBsAg-positive
candidates
for
chemotherapy
and
immunosuppressive
therapy
should
be
urgently referred to a specialist for further assessment and diag-
nosis of the phase of HBV infection. All these patients should start
potent NA as a treatment or as prophylaxis.
Patients with chronic hepatits B should be treated with ETV,
TDF or TAF, similarly to the immunocompetent patients. Moni-
toring and stopping rules for NAs are the same with the immuno-
competent patients.
In
contrast,
the
optimal
management
of
patients
with
chronic HBV infection, but without chronic hepatitis, remains
controversial. Prophylactic administration of LAM has been
shown to reduce the risk of HBV reactivation and the associated
morbidity and mortality,1 but a residual risk of HBV reactiva-
tion remains approximately in 10% of chronic HBV patients
with low viremia (HBV DNA \2,000 IU/ml) and in a higher pro-
portion of those with higher viremia levels. As recent studies
suggest that ETV or TDF can be successfully used in such
patients,204 prophylaxis with ETV, TDF, TAF is recommended
in
this
setting.
Prophylaxis
should
continue
for
at
least
12 months (18 months for rituximab-based regimens) after ces-
sation of the immunosuppressive treatment and discontinued
only if the underlying disease is under remission. Liver function
tests and HBV DNA should be tested every 3 to 6 months during
prophylaxis and for at least 12 months after NA withdrawal as a
large proportion of HBV reactivations develops after NA discon-
tinuation.205–209

 HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc positive subjects. The risk of HBV reacti-
vation in this group varies widely according to the virological
profile, underlying disease and the type and duration of immuno-
suppressive regimen. These subjects can be tested for serum HBV
DNA before immunosuppression. If viremic, they should be trea-
ted similarly to HBsAg-positive patients.
In the high risk group ([10%), including anti-HBc positive
subjects who need to be treated with rituximab in the onco-
hematological setting or those undergoing stem cell transplanta-
tion, antiviral prophylaxis is recommended. Prophylaxis should
continue for at least 18 months after stopping immunosuppres-
sion and monitoring should continue for at least 12 months after
prophylaxis withdrawal. LAM may be used safely in this setting
although few cases of HBV exacerbation due to LAM resistance
have been reported.210–212 Prophylaxis with ETV or TDF or TAF
can be also considered in HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc positive
patients
receiving
highly
immunosuppressive
regimens
of
extended duration.213,214
In HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc positive subjects with moderate
(\10%) or low (\1%) risk of HBV reactivation, pre-emptive ther-
apy, not prophylaxis, is generally recommended.205,206 The main
virological event in these anti-HBc positive patients is HBsAg
reappearance (seroreversion), constantly associated with hepati-
tis flare; by converse HBV DNA detection leads to seroreversion
and hepatitis in only 50% of cases.212 Pre-emptive therapy is
based upon monitoring HBsAg and/or HBV DNA every 1–
3 months during and after immunosuppression, and starting
ETV, TDF or TAF treatment in case of detectable HBV DNA or
HBsAg seroreversion. As HBsAg seroreversion can lead to a sev-
ere, even fatal, acute hepatitis, NA should be started as early as
possible, independently of ALT levels. For selected clinical set-
tings, characterised by long duration of immunosuppression, lim-
ited
compliance
to
monitoring
or
unknown
risk
of
viral
reactivation for new biologicals, universal prophylaxis, rather
than pre-emptive therapy, is recommended.
Dialysis and renal transplant patients
Recommendations
� All dialysis and renal transplant recipients should be
screened for HBV markers (Evidence level II-2, grade
of recommendation 1).
� HBsAg-positive dialysis patients who require treatment
should receive ETV or TAF (Evidence level II-2, grade of
recommendation 1).
� All HBsAg-positive renal transplant recipients should
receive ETV or TAF as prophylaxis or treatment (Evi-
dence level II-2, grade of recommendation 1).
� HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc positive subjects should be
monitored for HBV infection after renal transplantation
(Evidence level III, grade of recommendation 1).
HBV is still prevalent in dialysis and renal transplant patients
and may cause significant morbidity and mortality.1 All dialysis
and renal transplant patients should be screened for HBV mark-
ers. Though vaccine responsiveness is impaired, HBV seronega-
tive
patients
should
be
vaccinated,
preferentially
with
a
reinforced vaccine.215,216
All HBsAg-positive patients should be referred to a specialist
for further assessment and diagnosis of the phase of HBV
infection.
Dialysis patients. Patients with chronic HBV infection but not
chronic hepatitis B should be monitored, as there is no strong evi-
dence to suggest they have increased mordibity and mortality.1
In contrast, all patients with HBeAg-positive or -negative chronic
hepatitis B should receive a NA, as the preferred treatment strat-
egy, independently of the transplantation program.205,217,218 ETV
is recommended for NA naïve patients,219 TAF could be used for
both NA naïve and NA experienced/resistant patients but studies
are still ongoing.74,76 All doses of NAs should be adjusted accord-
ing to eGFR values in patients with eGFR \50 ml/min (see insert
packages), except for TAF which does not require dose adjust-
ment if eGFR is [15 ml/min. PegIFNa could be also used in
selected patients. Given that dialysis may reduce ALT levels, cau-
tion must be taken to use this marker to assess treatment
indications.
HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc positive subjects do not require
treatment nor prophylaxis but must be monitored for HBV
markers.
Renal transplant recipients. All HBsAg-positive patients should
receive anti-HBV prophylaxis or treatment with a NA.1,205,217,218
ETV is the preferred option for NA naïve patients. TDF should
be avoided because of renal safety issues and may be considered
only for patients with NA resistance if TAF is not available.74,76,79
TAF could be a good treatment option for both NA naïve and
resistant patients, although its efficacy and safety in this setting
are currently unknown. Though several studies have used LAM
in the past, this drug is not recommended because of the high risk
of resistance. NA prophylaxis and treatment should be continued
long-term. Long-term NA therapy has been shown to reduce liver
complications and improve survival. PegIFNa is contraindicated
because of the risk of rejection.
Renal function should be carefully monitored during treat-
ment with a NAs.79 Unexpected deterioration of renal function
during NA therapy may necessitate a change of treatment or dose
adaptation. Arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus should be
optimally controlled in renal transplant recipients.
HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc positive renal transplant recipients
do not require prophylaxis or treatment. Monitoring of HBsAg is
recommended to identify the few cases of HBsAg seroreversion in
which ETV or TAF should be started immediately, irrespectively
of ALT levels.
Extrahepatic manifestations
Recommendations
� Patients with replicative HBV infection and extrahepatic
manifestations should receive antiviral treatment with
NA (Evidence level II-2, grade of recommendation 1).
� PegIFNa should not be administered in patients with
immune-related extrahepatic manifestations (Evidence
level III, grade of recommendation 1).

 HBV related extrahepatic manifestations include vasculitis,
skin manifestations (purpura), polyarteritis nodosa, arthralgias,
peripheral neuropathy and glomerulonephritis. Mixed cryoglobu-
linemias, positive rheumatoid factor or inflammatory markers
(complement factors C3/C4, C-reactive protein, blood sedimenta-
tion rate) may be found in these patients. HBsAg-positive patients
with extrahepatic manifestations and active HBV replication may
respond to antiviral therapy. PegIFNa can worsen some immune
mediated extrahepatic manifestations and should not be admin-
istered in HBV infected patients with immune-related extrahep-
atic manifestations. Although controlled studies of antiviral
therapy in this setting are lacking, case reports suggest that the
use of NA is safe and effective.61,220 Plasmapheresis, corticos-
teroids and potentially other immune-suppressive drugs during
the initial phase can be useful in addition to NA therapy in special
cases.
New biomarkers of HBV infection
Viral cccDNA is the key genomic form that is responsible for the
persistence of infection and was shown to persist in the liver of
infected patients even after long-term NA therapy and even after
HBsAg loss and seroconversion.221,222 The regulation of the intra-
hepatic pool of cccDNA involves several factors including the
dynamics of infection in the liver and the intrahepatic antiviral
immune response.223 Furthermore, cccDNA transcriptional activ-
ity is controlled by fine epigenetic regulation which can involve
viral and host factors.13,224 Besides the need for standardized
assays, the main limitation of cccDNA studies is the requirement
of liver biopsy; thus surrogate biomarkers are being evaluated
(see below). It is noteworthy that not all transcripts are expressed
from cccDNA, but can also be expressed from viral sequences
integrated in the host genome. Viral genome replication cannot
occur from these integrants, but HBsAg expression can occur
either from the envelope gene in cccDNA and/or in viral inte-
grants, explaining at least in part why quantification of HBsAg
is not a perfect biomarker for intrahepatic cccDNA.225 Quantifica-
tion of cccDNA levels and its transcriptional activity will be
important in clinical trials evaluating novel treatment concepts
to cure HBV infection.
Hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) is a composite bio-
marker comprising several antigens expressed from the precore/-
core gene: HBcAg, HBeAg, and prec22 precursor protein.226 The
HBcrAg associated proteins can also be detected in circulating
hepatitis B virions (Dane particles) as well as in HBV DNA nega-
tive Dane particles containing the 22 kDa precore protein and
exceeding Dane particles by �100-fold, and probably also in
pregenomic RNA containing virions.227 The marker does not over-
lap with HBsAg quantification, and in contrast to HBsAg, HBcrAg
quantification might not be influenced by translation from inte-
grated viral sequences. Hence, HBcrAg quantification may pro-
vide additional information concerning the translational activity
of the HBV infection beyond HBsAg quantification. How to best
use this new assay in the management of patients with chronic
HBV infection is still a matter of debate. It has been demonstrated
that the serum HBcrAg levels may partly reflect the amount of
intrahepatic DNA and cccDNA in hepatocytes especially in
HBeAg-positive patients.228,229 It might also be helpful in defin-
ing the phase of chronic HBV infection, especially in HBe-
negative patients, as well as predicting the long-term HCC
risk.228,230–232 Some studies suggest that this biomarker can be
also used to monitor NA or PegIFNa based treatments and pre-
dicting therapeutic efficacy including the risk of relapse after
stopping NAs.233–235 Most of these studies were performed in
Japan, and large correlation studies derived from Caucasian
patients are lacking. Therefore, further studies are awaited pro-
viding clear evidence for a superiority of this marker for clinical
decision making over established HBV biomarkers like HBsAg
and HBV DNA quantification.
Circulating HBV RNA was first described in 1996 in the serum
of HBV infected patients and later as a potential new marker for
monitoring NA therapy. HBV RNA can be released into the serum
in the form of enveloped pregenomic RNA containing virions,236
but the full characterisation of these circulating RNAs is ongoing.
Because of its strong correlation with intrahepatic cccDNA, serum
HBV RNA is an interesting marker to study cccDNA transcrip-
tional activity.236–238 A strong correlation between quantitative
serum HBV RNA dynamics and HBeAg loss in both NA and
PegIFNa treated patients239 was recently demonstrated by using
a new rapid amplification of cDNA-ends with polymerase chain
reaction (RACE-PCR).240 HBV RNA quantification might be also
helpful in predicting viral rebound after discontinuation of
NAs.236 It should be further explored whether the simultaneous
testing of different replicative, transcriptional and translational
HBV biomarkers will allow for a better definition of the individual
‘‘activity” of the chronic HBV infection helping to better predict
long-term treatment outcomes.
Future treatment options
Future treatment options for HBV
Many research programs are ongoing to develop new treatment
concepts that focus on the clearance of HBsAg in a significant pro-
portion of patients, with the principle aims of: i) stopping treat-
ment with no risk of virological relapse and no risk of liver
disease progression and, ii) to further decrease the risk of HCC.
Several definitions of cure have been proposed following sev-
eral international workshops.241,242 A true cure may not be feasi-
ble because HBV DNA is integrated into the host genome.
Furthermore, among persons who recovered from acute hepatitis
B, viral cccDNA can still be detected in the liver explaining the
reactivation of HBV replication when these ‘recovered’ persons
are profoundly immunosuppressed. The ability to ‘cure’ HBV at
earlier stages of liver disease would theoretically have a greater
impact on reducing the risk of HCC.
The novel treatment options under pre-clinical and early clin-
ical evaluation can be categorized into direct antivirals and
immunotherapeutic agents.
Direct-acting antivirals include HBV entry inhibitors, drugs
aiming at cccDNA destruction or silencing, approaches targeting
viral transcripts by siRNA or anti-sense oligonucleotides, nucleo-
capsid assembly modulators, approaches to decrease HBsAg
release in serum. This list is not meant to be comprehensive as
many viral targets are currently being screened for drug discov-
ery. First phase clinical trials are ongoing for several of these
agents.241,243
Several potential target mechanisms for immune modulation
to engender or restore HBV specific immune responses in con-
junction with profound inhibition of HBV replication and HBsAg
production to attain immunological control have been sug-
gested.241,243 Several approaches are currently being evaluated

 in clinical trials to restore innate immunity in CHB patients.
Among them, Toll-like receptors 7 (TLR7) agonists have been
the most explored, but other strategies that restore IFNa respon-
siveness or other antiviral innate pathways are under investiga-
tion. The lack of a T cell mediated response in chronic HBV is
partly due to the expression of co-inhibitory receptors and by
the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines. Recent cancer
therapies have indicated the potential of check-point inhibitors
to restore anti-tumor adaptive immunity. Interesting results have
been obtained for HBV in animal models and in ex vivo studies in
humans. The main concerns of this approach are the potential
induction of uncontrolled hepatitis flares and autoimmunity. Sev-
eral therapeutic vaccines have been evaluated with limited suc-
cess,
but
new
vaccine
formulations
are
under
clinical
evaluation.241,243
Combinations of antiviral therapy targeting multiple steps in
the HBV lifecycle that suppress viral replication and viral antigen
production and immune modulatory therapy to restore immune
response to HBV will likely be needed to achieve the goal of a
HBV ‘cure’.
Given the focused drug discovery effort and the potential of a
future ‘cure’ strategy, it is important to be cognisant, when con-
sidering the current clinical management of CHB patients, of
the potential evolution of therapy in HBV. Patients who are will-
ing to participate and/or are in phases of the disease that are not
eligible for therapy within the current guidelines may be consid-
ered for clinical trial participation.
Future treatment options for HDV
At present, patients co-infected by HBV and HDV have to be trea-
ted with PegIFNa. The success rate of these treatments is low.
Several candidates are being evaluated in clinical trials mainly
in combination with PegIFNa and/or NA including HBV/HDV
entry inhibitors (Myrcludex-B),244,245 drugs inhibiting the release
of HBsAg (nucleic acid polymers),246 and inhibitors of the preny-
lation of the large HDV antigen.243,247 Whenever possible, enroll-
ment in these new clinical trials should be considered, either as a
rescue of PegIFNa failure or to improve treatment success rate in
naïve patients.
