Abstract
In the past, different types of diet with a generally low-carbohydrate content (< 50–< 20 g/day) have been promoted, for 
weight loss and diabetes, and the effectiveness of a very low dietary carbohydrate content has always been a matter of debate. 
A significant reduction in the amount of carbohydrates in the diet is usually accompanied by an increase in the amount of 
fat and to a lesser extent, also protein. Accordingly, using the term “low carb–high fat” (LCHF) diet is most appropriate. 
Low/very low intakes of carbohydrate food sources may impact on overall diet quality and long-term effects of such drastic 
diet changes remain at present unknown. This narrative review highlights recent metabolic and clinical outcomes of studies 
as well as practical feasibility of low LCHF diets. A few relevant observations are as follows: (1) any diet type resulting 
in reduced energy intake will result in weight loss and related favorable metabolic and functional changes; (2) short-term 
LCHF studies show both favorable and less desirable effects; (3) sustained adherence to a ketogenic LCHF diet appears to 
be difficult. A non-ketogenic diet supplying 100–150 g carbohydrate/day, under good control, may be more practical. (4) 
There is lack of data supporting long-term efficacy, safety and health benefits of LCHF diets. Any recommendation should 
be judged in this light. (5) Lifestyle intervention in people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, while maintaining a 
relative carbohydrate-rich diet, results in long-term prevention of progression to type 2 diabetes and is generally seen as safe.

Introduction
The World Health Organisation (WHO) and various national 
authorities have recently made recommendations urging a 
limitation of the daily consumption of carbohydrates, more 
specifically that of rapidly digestible starches and sugars. 
These recommendations play a key role in reducing the risks 
of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases [1–8]. In 
the past, there have been various diets that centre on a low-
carbohydrate content, such as the Atkins Diet, the Zone Diet, 
the South Beach Diet and the ketogenic diet [9–13].
In this respect, it should be pointed out that although many 
studies refer explicitely to “diets with a low-carbohydrate 
content”, this in fact goes hand in hand with “elevated 
fat”. This well-known “seesaw effect” is present in many 
nutritional intervention studies in which a decrease of one 
particular component always is accompanied by a paral-
lel increase of another component. In other words, effects 
observed are then based on two dietary factors that were 
changed in parallel and any conclusion drawn should be 
viewed in this light. Accordingly the term “low carbohy-
drate–high fat diet” (LCHF diet) is more appropriate than 
“low carbohydrate” alone, also in terms of interpretation of 
results. For this reason, the term LCHF will be used through-
out this paper.
Feinman et al. [14] proposed that dietary carbohydrate 
restriction is the first approach in diabetes management, the 
authors refer to much data showing that favorable effects 
such as improvement of insulin sensitivity/needs occurred 
along with significant weight loss. However, many of the 
cited studies concerned relatively small groups of indi-
viduals, often with poor diet adherence and relatively high 
dropout rates. Accordingly, one may question the validity of 
their proposal, especially since recent meta-analyses, which

did include well-controlled studies did not see beneficial 
changes in many parameters on the longer term (this will 
be discussed further in detail below). Important questions 
that ought to be put in this respect include: (a) what are 
the real long-term effects of very low-carbohydrate, thus 
high-fat intake; (b) are the effects observed rather the result 
of weight loss than of low carbohydrate per se, and (c) are 
there less drastic alternatives, i.e. more moderate changes of 
carbohydrate and fat intake that are easier to adhere to and 
lead to similar favorable results. These questions are also 
relevant, given that most chronic diseases such as diabetes, 
cardiovascular diseases and other chronic conditions have 
a development period of 10–20 years or more. Long-term 
data, demonstrating favorable effects of a (very) LCHF diet 
in this regard, is absent. In addition, there is also a plethora 
of studies that show that maintaining a relatively high-car-
bohydrate, low-glycemic–high-fiber diet (vegetarian, vegan) 
results in favorable long-term effects. Such diet patterns 
deviate less drastically from our normal eating patterns and 
are easier to implement in the long term [15–21]. In this 
respect, observations made in the so-called “blue zones”, 
e.g. Sardinia, Okinawa (Japan), Loma-Linda (California), 
are intriguing, given their commonality is their relatively 
high-carbohydrate and low-saturated fat content of their 
daily diet, which allow them to stay healthy until very high 
age. The Okinawa inhabitants, for example, originally ate 
a daily diet that contained an amount of carbohydrates that 
exceeded daily energy intake by 60%, consisting primarily 
of sweet potatoes and the foliage, supplemented with sea-
weed and fruit. The recent introduction of a more Western 
lifestyle, containing more saturated fats, added sugars and 
alcohol, has gone to the significant detriment of the longev-
ity prospects of the youngest generation [22], which indi-
cates that diet (carbohydrate and fat quality), in combination 
with other lifestyle factors is crucial for health.
An important question is why a challenging LCHF diet, 
with risks of poor adherence, should be implemented when 
less drastic changes in diet and lifestyle have proven effects 
and are known to be safe and easier to follow on the long 
run. Opinions seem to be sharply divided on the matter. This 
narrative review will shine a light on the various interna-
tional opinions on the matter.
Is a high carbohydrate content of the diet 
unhealthy?
There are various publications that assert that high levels of 
carbohydrates are unhealthy. The arguments to support this 
are often based on assumptions on how man was to have 
eaten long ago, before the agricultural and industrial revo-
lution. This is referred to as the Paleo Diet. Some authors 
explicitly claim that our ancestors ate a diet high in fat and 
protein and that starches and cereals were not part of the 
daily diet [23]. Historical data available to us, however, 
have shown that the diet 50,000 years ago, in fact, was rela-
tively high in carbohydrates, that it contained a high level 
of fiber (from plant-based foods) and that the level of fats 
primarily depended on the fat content of the various types 
of meat and fish available [24]. The Paleo diet contained 
an estimate of ≈ 35 percent of energy (en%) from fats, ≈ 35 
en% from carbohydrates and ≈ 30 en% from proteins, with 
approx. 100 g of dietary fiber a day [24–26]. Consequently, 
in quantitative terms, the Paleo diet contained roughly as 
much fat as does our modern Western diet. Observations 
made by Kaplan et al. [27] who studied the Tsimane popu-
lation in South America are of great interest in this respect. 
This population lives a traditional hunter–gatherer lifestyle 
and ingests an estimated 14% of their average caloric diet as 
protein, 14% as fat, and 72% as carbohydrate. Yet, despite 
this very high-carbohydrate intake, the Tsimane have the 
lowest reported levels of chronic disease of any population 
ever recorded to date! Today, there are no arguments to sug-
gest that the diet of our ancestors was low in carbohydrate. 
Quality but not quantity of carbohydrates appears to be a key 
aspect to be considered.
What does “low carbohydrate” 
and “ketogenic” refer to?
A large number of publications refer to a diet “low in car-
bohydrates” or to “ketogenic”. But what levels of carbo-
hydrate correspond to these concepts? We could start by 
assuming that low refers to lower than the current average 
intake or lower than current recommendations. According 
to the most recent Dutch Food Consumption Survey (FCS, 
2007–2010; 7–69 years), the average daily intake of macro-
nutrients is 45 en% from carbohydrates (of which 21 en% 
from sugars and 24 en% from starch), 35 en% from fats, 15 
en% from protein and 15–23 g of fiber [28]. On that basis, 
the term "low" could refer to lower than 45 en% derived 
from carbohydrates. However, does that necessarily mean 
low in terms of the effects on our metabolism? Currently, 
only guidelines exist regarding the recommended daily 
intake of foods and there are no international guidelines on 
high- or low-limit values. Anything above or below the rec-
ommended intake amounts can, respectively, be referred to 
as high or low. Therefore, the question is which bandwidth 
is defined as ‘low carbohydrate’ when comparing studies 
to one another to draw conclusions regarding the effects. 
Westman [29] describes this problem as follows: “Much 
of the controversy when studying the outcomes of LCHF 
diets stems from the lack of a clear definition. The guiding 
principle of carbohydrate limitation is that, in response to 
the reduced availability of glucose and lower insulin values

in the blood, the body should enter a state of increased fat 
burning, leading to ketosis. It would appear that a type of 
threshold value for carbohydrate intake exists above which 
this metabolic change does not clearly occur. For that reason, 
ketogenic studies are interpreted assuming only 20–50 g of 
carbohydrates per day and, if possible, a maximum of 20 g 
per day [29, 30]. Fewer ketone bodies are formed in the liver 
upon intake of more carbohydrates. In such cases, the term 
used is a low-carbohydrate diet rather than a ketogenic diet, 
the former containing 50 to max. 150 g of carbohydrates 
per day”.
What are the metabolic effects 
of a low‑carbohydrate availability?
Two processes that come into play when glucose availability 
is in decline: (1) gluconeogenesis, (2) ketogenesis. Below 
these aspects will be explained in short.
Gluconeogenesis
A very low-carbohydrate intake (< 50 g per day) will result 
in a decreasing glucose supply to the liver, muscles and 
brain, resulting in a decline in the amount of glucose stored 
as glycogen. When glucose availability is limiting the body 
will activate a process called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeo-
genesis (endogenous production of glucose) and glycolysis 
(breakdown of glucose) are processes that always take place 
simultaneously and are reciprocal (if one is high, the other is 
low, and vice versa). The primary carbon skeletons required 
for the synthesis of glucose in gluconeogenesis (Fig. 1) come 
from lactic acid, glycerol and the amino acids alanine and 
glutamine [31].
Ketogenesis
When endogenous production of glucose by gluconeogenesis 
remains too low to cover the body’s glucose needs of cells 
that primarily rely on glucose as a fuel, ketone bodies will 
be produced as an alternative to glucose [32]. In this condi-
tion, insulin levels in the blood will be low, sharply reducing 
the stimulus for fat and glucose storage. This observation is 
often referred to when promoting a high fat diet for weight 
maintenance and reduction of diabetes risk factors (see also 
further below). Other hormonal changes would subsequently 
lead to an increase in the breakdown of fat from the fat cells 
and making more fatty acids available as fuel. In this situ-
ation of a continuous elevated supply of fatty acids, not all 
fatty acids will be burnt completely. Acetoacetic acid (ace-
toacetate) is then created which is subsequently converted 
into the ketones beta-hydroxybutyric acid (β-hydroxybutyric 
acid) and acetone. For that reason, ketones are to be regarded 
as “a type of emergency generator that kicks in when there 
is a power outage”. Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5 give a schematic 
representation of the metabolic processes in case of a nor-
mal carbohydrate intake and after limitation of carbohydrate 
intake leading to ketosis.
Do frequent carbohydrate‑induced insulin 
responses drive overweight?
According to Hall [32], the carbohydrate–insulin model of 
obesity theorizes that diets high in carbohydrate are par-
ticularly fattening due to their propensity to elevate insulin 
secretion. Insulin directs the partitioning of energy toward 
storage as fat in adipose tissue and away from oxidation 
by metabolically active tissues and purportedly results in a 
perceived state of cellular internal starvation. In response, 
hunger and appetite increases and metabolism is sup-
pressed, thereby promoting the positive energy balance 
associated with the development of obesity. Hall states 
that this hypothesis, which is cited by many to support 
recommendations for a LCHF diet, cannot be verified by 
controlled studies. He also suggests that the mechanisms 
most likely are far more complex than previously thought, 
given that the differences in energy consumption and body 
fat, as observed in the controlled case studies, are contrary 
to the differences that are predicted based on the carbo-
hydrate–insulin model. Hall claims that although the rise 
of the prevalence of obesity may be put down to elevated 
consumption of refined carbohydrates, the mechanisms 
are most likely completely different from what we think

they are. For example, consumption of foods with a high 
level of added sugars could result in a greater total energy 
Fig. 2  In a high-carbohydrate 
diet, the glucose reserves in the 
liver and muscles are usually 
well stocked. In fasting condi-
tions, blood glucose levels are 
kept steady by breakdown of 
glucose from the liver glycogen. 
This is regulated by the insulin/
glucagon ratio. The low insulin 
levels ensure that relatively few 
fatty acids are stored in the adi-
pose cells, while the secretion 
of fatty acids by the break-
down of stored lipid (lipolysis) 
ensures elevated blood plasma 
fatty acid levels. This leads 
to a high degree of fatty acids 
oxidation and relatively low oxi-
dation of glucose. This is then 
expressed in a low respiratory 
quotient (RQ), usually 0.75–0.8

Fig. 3  Following a carbohydrate-rich meal, the blood glucose is ele-
vated by the supply of glucose from the intestine, resulting in elevated 
insulin levels and a temporary decrease in glucagon levels. This com-
bination results in a sharp decrease in glucose production from the 
liver glycogen. At the same time, the release of fatty acids from the 
adipose cells  is inhibited and the uptake of both glucose and fatty 
acids from the blood is stimulated. In this case, the burning of pri-
marily fatty acids in a fasting condition shifts to a combination of 
elevated glucose- and reduced fat oxidation. This is expressed in an 
elevated respiratory quotient (RQ), depending on the carbohydrate 
intake and the magnitude of the insulin response, between 0.85 and 
1.0. There is also a small contribution from amino acids, which are 
converted into glucose via gluconeogenesis. Under normal condi-
tions, this amounts to approx. 1–3%, although in cases of acute or 
chronic carbohydrate restriction resulting in significant glycogen 
breakdown and depending on the degree of adaptation to the situation 
this can even rise to > 15% [32–37]

Fig. 4  When following an LCHF diet, the amount of glucose that is 
taken up in the blood from the food each day is insufficient to main-
tain the glycogen stores in the liver and muscles. This results in an 
reduction of glycogen stores, reduced glucose release and conse-
quently to reduced  blood glucose levels. The body experiences this 
as stress and will do everything it can to ensure it burns fatty acids 
as much as possible with the aim of preventing utilization of glu-
cose, which is needed primarily for the central nervous system and 
the red blood cells, as much as possible. This is achieved by a sharp 
decrease in insulin and an increase of stress hormones. This results 
in an excess supply of fatty acids, leading to a partially incomplete 
metabolism in which ketones are produced (ketogenesis) from a part 
of the produced acetyl-CoA. These ketones can then be used by the 
brain and the muscles as an alternative fuel source instead of glu-
cose. This is crucial to the brain, as fatty acids cannot pass through 
the blood–brain barrier, while glucose and ketones can. In the case 
of a shortage of glucose, the brain cells and neurons are able to use 
ketones as an alternative fuel source. There is also a small to medium 
contribution from amino acids, which are converted into glucose via 
gluconeogenesis

intake because they have a more attractive taste, stimulate 
to eat more or reduce satiety. Most recently, Hall and Guo 
postulated that while low-carbohydrate diets have been 
suggested to partially subvert these processes by increas-
ing energy expenditure and promoting fat loss, their meta-
analysis of 32 controlled feeding studies, with isocaloric 
substitution of carbohydrate for fat, found that both energy 
expenditure (26 kcal/day; P < 0.0001) and fat loss (16 g/
day; P < 0.0001) were greater with lower fat diets [38].
Does LCHF diet improve insulin action?
The scientific literature shows that individuals suffer-
ing from pre-diabetes (as shown by fasting glucose and 
insulin levels) or suffering from diabetes and who switch 
to a LCHF diet soon notice a number of effects, such as 
weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, fewer fluctua-
tions in blood glucose levels and lower fasting blood glu-
cose levels. Such changes indirectly entail reduced risks 
of cardiovascular diseases [13, 14, 39]. However, there are 
also scientists that consider these effects primarily to be 
the results of weight loss and not necessarily the result of a 
reduction in carbohydrate intake itself. Westman et al. [29] 
published a thematic review of the metabolic effects of 
LCHF diets, and concluded that LCHF diets lead to reduc-
tion of appetite and, consequently, to weight loss and cor-
responding improvements of various disease risk factors.
Does LCHF reduce dietary fiber intake?
In general, most natural carbohydrate-rich food sources 
are high in dietary fibers and micronutrients. For that rea-
son, the key question arises whether switching to a LCHF 
diet would not lead to a significant decrease in the sup-
ply fiber, known to impact negatively on gut function and 
overall health [40]. A study that conducted an accurate 
analysis of this issue and of the relationship between popu-
lar diets and food quality (expressed as a food index score) 
showed that diets with less than 30 en% carbohydrates 
ended up in the lowest index score [41, 42], indicating 
that there is a realistic risk of low fiber and micronutrient 
intakes when consuming an LCHF diet.
Based on various meta-analysis, an appropriate dietary 
fiber intake, for example by consuming more whole grain 
compared to a low intake of whole grain, is linked to a 
significant disease risk reductions for diabetes type 2, car-
diovascular disease [43, 44], while evidence is growing 
that weight management may also be supported favorably 
[45, 46]. The fact that LCHF diets may reduce diet quality 
is of concern and indicates a need for carefull nutritional 
guidance when following such diets.
What do meta‑analyses of LCHF diets tell us?
Astrup et al. [47] initially set out to study the effects of a 
high-carbohydrate diet, relatively low in fat low-fat. They 
asserted that the effectiveness of an ad libitum diet, rela-
tively high in carbohydrate, as was often recommended 
for the prevention of weight gain in patients with normal 
weight, or a decrease in body weight in the case of obe-
sity, was controversial. This resulted in a meta-analysis into 
the effects of intervention studies which included studies in 
which non-diabetic individuals consumed a low-fat (thus, 
consequently, a relatively carbohydrate-rich) diet, a normal 
diet, or a diet moderately rich in fat (control group). Follow-
ing a stringent selection process, the details of 16 studies 
were evaluated (duration of 2–12 months, 19 intervention 
groups, 1910 people). At the inception of the studies, the 
average fat consumption of the persons in the low-fat group 
was 37.7% (95% Cl 36.9–38.5). In the control group, this 
was 37.4% (36.4–38.4). Consequently, fat consumption was 
equal in both the low-fat and control groups. The low-fat 
intervention reduced fat intake in the low-fat test groups to 
10.2% (8.1–12.3) while fat intake remained unchanged in 
the control groups. The data showed that the energy intake 
of the LFHC intervention groups was lower (1138 kJ/day, 
P < 00.002) and that they showed more weight loss than 
the control groups (3.2 kg, Cl 1.9–4.5 kg, P < 0.0001). The 
authors concluded that a reduction of the fat content in 
the diet, without targeted restriction of the energy intake, 
resulted in higher weight loss, especially in persons with 
the highest body weight. The foregoing corresponds to the 
considerations put forward by Hall et al. [48] in a publica-
tion, which bore the self-explanatory title ‘Calorie for calo-
rie’, dietary fat restriction results in more body fat loss than 
carbohydrate restriction.
In 2012, Hu et al. published a meta-analysis of rand-
omized controlled clinical studies on the effects of diets 
containing < 45 en% carbohydrates compared to diets that 
contained less than 30 en% of fat [40]. This meta-analysis 
also mapped the risk factors to metabolic processes. Data 
from 23 studies from various countries, with a total of 
2788 participants (study duration of 6–24 months, includ-
ing 6 studies of 15–24 months), met the inclusion criteria 
and were included in the analysis. Both the low-carbo-
hydrate diet and the low-fat diet resulted in a decrease in 
body weight and an improvement of metabolic risk fac-
tors. The two groups showed no significant divergences 
in terms of decrease of body weight, waist circumference 
and metabolic risk factors. The authors claim that these 
findings suggest that low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets 
 1307

1 3
have similar effects on body weight reduction and related 
risk factors for diseases.
A recent meta-analysis by Mansoor et al. [49] con-
cerned data of 11 randomized controlled studies (total of 
1369 participants). The study revealed that participants 
experienced a greater decrease in body weight and of 
plasma triglycerides when being on a LCHF diet. How-
ever, an increase in LDL cholesterol was also observed, 
which is in line with the earlier observations of [50]. It has 
been questioned whether the overall benefits observed do 
outweigh that of an unfavorable LDL increase [51].
Is a LCHF diet healthy and safe?
Many food authorities recommend relatively high-carbo-
hydrate and high-fiber intakes as being healthy [52]. Seen 
in the recommendations, discussed above, the question is 
what the long-term health implications of LCHF diets would 
be, given the relatively short duration of virtually all avail-
able studies [53, 54]. The limited literature, in which LCHF 
studies were compared to relatively high-carbohydrate 
studies, does not show consistent differences in effects on 
body weight. The only way to get an answer to this question 
would be to conduct robustly controlled long-term studies 
(minimum of 2 years) in which carbohydrate, fat, energy 
and dietary fiber intake are carefully monitored along with 
changes in body weight. Such studies are hard to carry out 
and are costly and for that reason have as yet not been car-
ried out. One study that did conduct an evaluation of this 
issue, and was subject to strict controls, albeit also with a 
relative short duration of 8 weeks [55], resulted in the con-
clusion that under conditions of a steady level of energy 
intake during a hypocaloric diet (− 500 kcal/day) a LCHF 
diet is just as effective as a low-fat high-carbohydrate diet. 
In this study weight loss was significant in both groups and 
improvements in insulin sensitivity were also similar. This 
is a strong indication that LCHF effects are primarily related 
to weight loss and corresponding changes to central body fat 
and the associated metabolic processes.
Two reviews drew the conclusion that the short-term 
effects of LCHF diets are positive on weight loss and 
blood glucose management, but also that the long-term 
effects have not been studied [11, 56]. The authors indi-
cate that observed effects seemed primarily to relate to 
weight loss and that, for that reason, the effect of changes 
in the intake of carbohydrates and fats remained “unclear”. 
Brinkworth et al. [57] concluded that a combination of 
a low-carbohydrate diet combined with a restriction of 
energy intake would, due to reductions of fiber intake, 
lead to adverse effects on the quality of bowel movements 
and the production of short-chain fatty acids by the flora of 
the large intestine. They claim that it seems as if this may 
potentially lead to bowel disease in the long term. After 
a systematic review and meta-analysis Naude et al. [58] 
concluded that here is probably little or no difference in 
weight loss and changes in cardiovascular risk factors up 
to 2 years of follow-up when overweight and obese adults, 
with or without type 2 diabetes, are randomized to low 
CHO diets and iso-energetic-balanced weight loss diets. In 
a more recent review, bearing the title “Low-carbohydrate 
diets and type-2 diabetes: the current status of the evi-
dence”, in the journal Diabetes Therapy, Dyson expressed 
that the state of affairs has not changed much [59]. He con-
cluded that low-carbohydrate diets for people with type-2 
diabetes could in the short-term lead to an improvement 
in blood glucose regulation, weight loss, and reduction 
of cardiovascular risk factors, but that this appeared no 
longer to be the case in the longer term. Overall, LCHF 
diets did not seem to show any superiority compared to 
diets with a higher carbohydrate intake. On the basis of 
these findings, he concludes that low-carbohydrate diets 
are indeed safe in the short term and are effective, but 
that there are no statistical differences compared with diets 
containing a higher carbohydrate content. For this reason, 
Dyson suggests that an LCHF diet should not be recom-
mended as the standard treatment of people with type-2 
diabetes [59]. This view is supported by Wyk et al. [31] 
who describe that “total energy intake remains the best 
predictor of changes in body weight. A low-carbohydrate 
diet, in terms of metabolic indicators and blood glucose 
response, does not differ a great deal from a diet with the 
usual amount of carbohydrates”. Very low-carbohydrate 
diets seems to score slightly better in this regard, but are 
harder to adhere to over a longer period of time (more 
than 6 months). Daily carbohydrate intake, for example, 
seemed to amount to 132–162 g per day, despite over a 
year of dieting and a guiding principle of less than 50 g 
per day. The foregoing also implies that there is still a lack 
of clarity regarding the long-term effects of an LCHF diet 
on both effectiveness as well as food safety.
The observations of Noto et al. [60] are also relevant 
in this regard. These authors assessed the effects of low-
carbohydrate diets on probability of mortality, by way of a 
systematic review and a meta-analysis of the available obser-
vational studies. 17 studies were included in total, containing 
the data of 272,216 people of which 15,981 (5.9%) were 
reported dead. The results showed that the risk of mortality 
under conditions of LCHF diets was significantly higher. In 
accordance with these findings, many insiders feel that an 
LCHF diet should only be recommended for persons suf-
fering from overweight and pre-diabetes or type-2 diabetes, 
for the reduction of bodyweight and hyperglycemia risks. 
They recommend that the diet only be followed under strict 
medical and nutritional supervision.

Regarding the question whether long-term LCHF diets 
may pose health risks it should also be noted that a series of 
recent animal experiments and human studies into the effects 
of an LCHF diet, for example, show adverse effects in cho-
lesterol, homocysteine, vascular elasticity parameters have 
been observed during LCHF, indicating that any potential 
adverse long-term effects of an LCHF vascular health cannot 
be ruled out [29, 40, 49, 51].
In addition, adverse effects as result of high-fat expo-
sure were reported in the following areas: brain, cognition, 
memory, mental well-being, Alzheimer’s, autistic behaviour 
[33, 34, 61–63]; obesity, metabolic dysfunction, inflamma-
tion, liver damage, cardiometabolic risks’ [34, 38, 64–68]; 
risks of cancer [66, 69]; osteoporosis [70]. In elegant animal 
models, Cani et al. [71] clearly demonstrated that high fat 
feeding, which induces low intakes of fermentable dietary 
fibers, may lead to intestinal microbiota changes which are 
associated with an increased intestinal permeability resulting 
in endotoxemia and triggers for inflammation and metabolic 
disorders (note: the examples are only given as an illustra-
tion, not for an exhaustive picture). These data point to pos-
sible long-term negative effects on health that should be 
addressed in future studies.
LCHF for specific patient groups
Within this context, it should be noted that a Ketogenic-
LCHF (KLCHF) diet is used for specific pathologies such 
as epilepsy and autism epilepsy and that positive effects 
have been documented to decrease epileptic seizures. Simi-
larly in this instance, this is also paired with adverse side 
effects; in addition, the long-term effects on overall health 
are unknown. Following a robust Cochrane meta-analysis, 
for example, Martin et al. [72] concluded that randomized, 
controlled KLCHF studies showed promising results follow-
ing application in epilepsy patients, but that the limited num-
ber of studies, small samples, and one-sided data from child 
populations, resulted in poor evidential quality. Within all 
KLCHF studies, short-term side effects were recorded such 
as gastrointestinal disorders, and cardiovascular complica-
tions in the longer term. For all KLCHF studies, “compli-
ance” was a problem due to the lack of effectiveness and/or 
problematic diet tolerance. The authors believe that there is a 
lack of evidence to support a clinical application of KLCHF 
in adults with epilepsy.
New insights?
A very recent overview [73] concerned randomized inter-
vention studies, with control group, carried out between 
2001 and 2015. The authors concluded as follows: a 
slight though significant decrease of glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c) entails a restriction of carbohydrates (CH) at 
all levels: 2.2% at 30 g CH/day, − 0.7% at ≤ 75 CH/day, 
− 1.1% at 80–90 g CH/day and − 0.9% with CH intake to 
120 g/day (a logical consequence of less glucose supply 
to the blood, under conditions of insulin resistance) [73]. 
The fasting blood values and the required medication, as 
such, were lower which resulted in people feeling “better”. 
At an intake of 58% fat and 14% carbohydrates, compared 
with 30% fat and 53% carbohydrates, blood triglycerides 
decreased and HDL cholesterol increased. Decreases in 
body weight varied from − 8.6 to 0.9 kg, with slightly 
more weight loss in favor of greater carbohydrate restric-
tion. This study, therefore, shows favorable effects in dia-
betes patients following a controlled LCHF diet lasting to 
a maximum of ≈ 2 years. To ensure the correct interpreta-
tion of this data, it should be noted that only an abstract 
was published and that this abstract also contains citations 
that lead to further questions. We must wait for the com-
prehensive peer reviewed publication before we can make 
definitive statements on this matter.
Recent work addressed the potential effectiveness of diets 
differing in the contents of carbohydrate and fat on weight-
loss, in dependence of insulinemic and glycemic status and 
sheds a differentiating light on the question about which diet 
type may be most effective to lose weight. Hjorth et al. [74] 
re-evaluated the effects of diets with different glycemic loads 
or different fiber and whole-grain content as assessed in three 
large randomized trials in overweight participants (1: the 
DiOGenes—Diet, Obesity, and Genes study, 2: the OPUS—
New Nordic Diet study and 3: the NUGENOB—Nutrient-
Gene Interactions in Human Obesity-study). Effects on the 
concentrations of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and fasting 
insulin (FI) as possible prognostic markers for successful 
weight loss and weight maintenance were determined. It 
was observed that pre-diabetic (elevated FPG) and diabetic 
individuals lost more weight or regained less weight when 
consuming a high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet than when 
consuming a low-fat and high-carbohydrate diet. On the 
contrary, in insulin-sensitive individuals, expressing normo-
glycemia, beneficial effects observed were favorable when 
consuming a low-fat and relatively high-carbohydrate diet. 
Wan 2017 observed that a relatively high carbohydrate was 
effective for weight loss in healthy obese individuals. Based 
on this data, [75] concluded that disturbed insulin sensitivity 
and elevated FPG are important determinants for the dietary 
treatment of choice, being either low fat–high carbohydrate 
or alternatively, low carbohydrate–high fat. Accordingly, 
they proposed that stratifying patients for personalized die-
tary guidance based on pre-diet FPG outcomes may be rec-
ommendable. In another paper, however, by Snorgaard and 
Astrup et al. [14, 76], the same author concluded as follows: 
“in addition to improvements in HbA1c in the short term, 
 1309
European Journal of Nutrition (2018) 57:1301–1312 
1 3
there is no superiority of low-carbohydrate diets in the field 
of glycemic control, weight or LDL cholesterol.
Based on these observations and the seemingly conflict-
ing conclusions, there is a need for controlled studies, “with 
intention to treat”, to verify these effects as a base for future 
evidence-based dietary recommendations.
Is life style intervention the favorable way 
to go?
Based on the information presented above, it cannot be 
concluded that LCHF diets result in favorable effects that 
outweigh effects observed with less-drastic diet regimen, 
containing more carbohydrate quantities that are closer to 
daily practise.
One might argue that an improvement of the daily diet 
is relatively easy to achieve and also effective for disease 
prevention. Recent expert panels, including those of the 
WHO [5], the Dutch Health Council [2], the German Food 
Council [1], Nordic Dietary Recommendations (Scandi-
navian countries) [77], and the Scientific Advisory Com-
mittee on Nutrition in England [3], have concluded that 
diets rich in fruit, vegetables, cereals, legumes, but also 
moderately rich in fat and calories, combined with a suf-
ficient amount of daily physical activity constitute the 
best scenario for maintaining a healthy body weight and 
for the prevention of chronic lifestyle diseases. This also 
entails moderation of (added/free) sugar intake and select-
ing whole-wheat products over low-fiber starch products. 
The quantity of fat that is unanimously recommended by 
all these advisory bodies is less than 40% of daily energy 
intake. The recommended quantity of carbohydrates for 
each of these advisory bodies and others [52] is over 40% 
of energy intake, which corresponds to more than 180 g 
of carbohydrates per day.
In addition to this, it is important to notice that life-
style interventions that also focus on other factors than 
diet alone have been shown to result is long-term benefits. 
Lindström et al. [78] described long-term effects of life-
style intervention in a Finnish population. The specific 
intervention goals were weight reduction (5% or more 
from baseline weight), dietary modification [energy pro-
portion of total fat less than 30% and saturated fat less 
than 10% of total energy, dietary fiber intake 3.6 g/MJ 
(15 g/1000 kcal)] or more and increased physical activity 
(4 h per week or more). The authors showed that lifestyle 
intervention while being on a relative carbohydrate-rich 
diet in people at high risk of type 2 diabetes induces sus-
taining lifestyle change and results in long-term preven-
tion of progression to type 2 diabetes. Schellenberg et al. 
[79] performed a meta-analysis of lifestyle programs and 
concluded that interventions that include exercise, dietary 
changes, and at least one other component are effective in 
decreasing the incidence of type 2 diabetes in high-risk 
patients, and the benefit extends beyond the active inter-
vention phase. However, in patients who have already been 
diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, the evidence for benefit of 
comprehensive lifestyle interventions on patient-oriented 
outcomes was less clear.
Key points
1. Each type of diet that results overweight—diabetic indi-
viduals to eat less food and taking in less energy will 
initially result in weight loss, which in itself will lead to 
favorable metabolic and functional changes.
2. The available scientific literature shows that controlled 
diet studies (several weeks to < 2 year) with LCHF in 
persons with obesity and diabetes do induce favorable 
effects on weight loss, blood glucose and insulin as well 
as some less desirable effects (increase LDL cholesterol, 
decrease vascular reactivity).
3. Compliance with KLCHF diets appears to be poor and 
after some time many individuals appear to shift to 
higher intakes in the range of 130–160 g/day. Accord-
ingly, targeting 100–150 g/day may be better achievable.
4. There is lack of data supporting long-term efficacy, 
safety and health benefits of LCHF diets. Any recom-
mendation should be judged in this light.
5. Persons with type 2 diabetes or borderline diabetes are 
recommended to restrict their daily intake of rapidly 
digestible carbohydrates (sugars, syrups, potato, white 
rice, white bread, etc.). In addition, it is recommended 
that when switching to a diet that includes a higher por-
tion of fat, people should primarily select products that 
are rich in unsaturated fatty acids.
6. Lifestyle interventions in people at high risk of devel-
oping type 2 diabetes, while maintaining a relative car-
bohydrate-rich diet, results in long-term prevention of 
progression to type 2 diabetes and are generally seen as 
safe.
7. Due to the complexity of the potential mechanisms, their 
interactions, and an absence of data from robustly con-
trolled long-term studies (> 2 years), a general public 
evidence based recommendation to support KLCHF 
and LCHF diets as a preventive measure to help reduce 
risks of type 2 diabetes, seems premature. The role of 
long-term elevated consumption of fat combined with 
low-carbohydrate consumption warrants further study 
before general recommendations can be made.
