Abstract
Detection of α-synuclein lesions in peripheral tissues is a feature of human synucleinopathies of 
likely pathogenetic relevance and bearing important clinical implications. Experiments were 
carried out to elucidate the relationship between α-synuclein accumulation in the brain and in 
peripheral organs, and to identify potential pathways involved in long-distance protein transfer. 
Results of this in vivo study revealed a route-specific transmission of α-synuclein from the rat 
brain to the stomach. Following targeted midbrain overexpression of human α-synuclein, the 
exogenous protein was capable of reaching the gastric wall where it was accumulated into 
preganglionic vagal terminals. This brain-to-stomach connection likely involved intra- and inter-
neuronal transfer of non-fibrillar α-synuclein that first reached the medulla oblongata, then gained 
access into cholinergic neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and finally traveled 
via efferent fibers of these neurons contained within the vagus nerve. Data also showed a 
particular propensity of vagal motor neurons and efferents to accrue α-synuclein and deliver it to 
peripheral tissues; indeed, following its midbrain overexpression, human α-synuclein was detected 
within gastric nerve endings of visceromotor but not viscerosensory vagal projections. Thus, the 
dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve represents a key relay center for central-to-peripheral α-
synuclein transmission, and efferent vagal fibers may act as unique conduits for protein transfer. 
The presence of α-synuclein in peripheral tissues could reflect, at least in some synucleinopathy 
patients, an ongoing pathological process that originates within the brain and, from there, reaches 
distant organs innervated by motor vagal projections.

 Introduction
Intraneuronal inclusions containing α-synuclein are hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease and 
other neurological disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system 
atrophy [11, 22]. In typical Parkinson’s disease, α-synuclein pathology is characterized by a 
progressive caudo-rostral advancement; initial lesions are observed in the lower brainstem 
and, in particular, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMnX) from where α-
synuclein pathology spreads toward mesencephalic and ultimately cortical brain regions [6]. 
An important role of the DMnX and vagal connections in Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis 
is further suggested by findings showing accumulation of α-synuclein deposits in the gut; 
this accumulation followed a pattern that matched the distribution of preganglionic terminals 
of DMnX-derived vagal efferents [2]. It has been hypothesized that the pathological process 
of Parkinson’s disease, perhaps mediated by toxic α-synuclein species, may proceed from 
distant nerve endings in the gut toward the brain or, vice versa, from the DMnX to the 
enteric nervous system following the course of the vagus nerve [11]. It has also been 
proposed that long, unmyelinated axons, such as those originating from DMnX neurons, 
may be particularly vulnerable to α-synuclein transfer and its pathological accumulation [6].
Several experimental studies in animal models support the ability of α-synuclein to move 
efficiently throughout the brain via intra- and inter-neuronal protein transmission [9, 23]. 
Some of these investigations have shown that α-synuclein can advance caudo-rostrally from 
the gastrointestinal tract to the brain and from lower to higher brain regions [12, 13, 15, 25]. 
No direct evidence to date, however, supports the ability of α-synuclein to travel long-
distance in the opposite direction, from the brain parenchyma to peripheral nerve endings. 
Similarly, the hypothesis that distinct neuronal populations and, in particular, visceromotor 
vagal neurons, may contribute to a greater degree to the progression of α-synuclein 
pathology remains unsubstantiated from the experimental standpoint. Results of the present 
study provide important new clues on the central-to-peripheral and route-specific 
transmission of α-synuclein. Data reveal that viral vector-mediated overexpression of human 
α-synuclein (hα-synuclein) in the rat midbrain triggers its advancement via the vagus nerve 
and results in its pathological accumulation in the stomach wall. Interestingly, this 
accumulation targeted preganglionic vagal terminals while it did not occur within 
viscerosensory gastric afferents, pointing to a preferential route of protein transmission via 
neurons, namely DMnX cells and their projections, that are particularly able to accrue and 
deliver α-synuclein.
Materials and methods
Viral vectors
Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs; serotype 2 genome and serotype 6 
capsid) were used for transgene expression of hα-synuclein or green fluorescent protein 
(GFP; Vector Biolabs). Expression, driven by the human SYN1 promoter, was enhanced 
using woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) and a 
polyadenylation signal sequence.

 Animals and surgical procedure
Experimental procedures involving animals were approved by the State Agency for Nature, 
Environment and Consumer Protection in North Rhine Westphalia. Experiments were 
performed in female Sprague Dawley rats (200–225 g; Charles River) housed under a 12-h 
light/12-h dark cycle with free access to food and water. During surgical procedures, rats 
were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane mixed with O2 and N2O. Each animal received a 
single unilateral injection of AAV solution (1.0 × 1013 genome copies/ml) either (i) into the 
left vagus nerve in the neck (2 μl), or (ii) intraparenchymally, into the right ventral 
mesencephalon immediately dorsal to the substantia nigra pars compacta (1 μl). Vagal 
injections were made according to previously described protocols [25]. To target the 
substantia nigra, the following stereotaxic coordinates were used with a tooth bar setting of 
−2.3 mm: 5.0 mm posterior and 2.0 mm lateral to bregma, and 7.1 mm ventral to dura mater. 
The injection was made at a rate of 0.4 μl/min using a Hamilton syringe fitted to a glass 
capillary. The capillary was left in position for 5 min before being withdrawn.
Tissue preparation
Animals were killed with pentobarbital. Brains used for in situ hybridization were snap 
frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. At the time of analysis, they were cryosectioned (14 
μm) and then mounted on polysine object slides. For histological analyses, rats were 
perfused through the ascending aorta first with physiological saline solution. At this time, a 
cannula was inserted via oral gavage to inflate the stomach with 10 ml saline. The perfusion 
continued using 4% ice-cold paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. The following 
organs/tissues were collected: brain, vagus nerve (including the nodose ganglion) in the rat 
neck and stomach. Brains and vagus nerves were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 
solution for 24 h and cryopreserved in 25% (w/v) sucrose solution. Coronal sections (40 μm) 
throughout the brain were cut using a freezing microtome, while each vagus nerve was 
sectioned (16 μm) longitudinally using a cryostat. Stomachs were post-fixed but not 
cryopreserved. They were divided into dorsal and ventral whole mounts by cutting along the 
greater and lesser curvatures.
Assays
All analyses, as described in the next paragraphs, were performed by investigators blinded to 
treatment/experimental group.
Brightfield microscopy
Medulla oblongata—Free-floating sections were quenched by incubations in a mixture of 
3% H2O2 and 10% methanol in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6). Non-specific binding sites 
were blocked by incubations in Tris-buffered saline with 0.25% Triton-X-100 containing 5% 
normal serum. Samples were kept overnight at room temperature in a solution (Tris-buffered 
saline with 1% BSA and 0.25% Triton-X-100) containing the primary antibody, i.e. mouse 
anti-hα-synuclein clone syn211 (36-008, Merck Millipore; 1:10 000). Sections were rinsed 
and incubated (for 1 h at room temperature) in biotinylated secondary antibody solution 
(Vector Laboratories; 1:200). Following treatment with avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase 
complex (PK 6100; ABC Elite kit, Vector Laboratories), color reaction was developed using

 a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) kit (Vector Laboratories). Sections were mounted on coated 
slides, dried and coverslipped with Depex (Sigma-Aldrich). Stacked or tiled images 
collected with 40x or 10x Plan-Apochromat, respectively, were obtained using an IX2 UCB 
microscope from Olympus equipped with a motorized stage and camera (MBF Biosciences). 
Stacks were collected at 1 μm intervals, and a single image was generated by deep focus 
post-processing using Stereo Investigator software (version 9, MBF Biosciences). In a set of 
analyses, the percent of DMnX neurons overexpressing hα-synuclein was calculated after 
hα-synuclein-AAV injections into the rat vagus nerve. For these analyses, both the total 
number of Nissl-stained cells and the number of hα-synuclein-positive neurons was 
estimated using unbiased stereology [24].
Vagus nerve and nodose ganglion—Sections on slides were quenched and blocked as 
described above. They were incubated for 48 h at 4 °C in mouse anti-hα-synuclein (syn211; 
1:2000) or chicken anti-GFP (ab13970, Abcam; 1:5000) and for 1 h at room temperature in 
ImmPRESS secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories). Color reaction was developed using a 
DAB kit. Images were collected using an Axiocam 503 color camera fitted to an Axioscope 
microscope (Zeiss).
Stomach—The mucosa and submucosa were removed by fine dissection, and the resulting 
smooth muscle whole mounts were rinsed in PBS followed by a 30 min soak in an 
endogenous peroxidase block (methanol: 3% H2O2; 4:1). After additional rinses in PBS, the 
neuronal population of the myenteric plexus was counterstained with the pan-neuronal 
marker Cuprolinic Blue (quinolinic phthalocyanine; Polysciences). Whole mounts were then 
soaked for 5 days in normal serum block (0.5% Triton X-100, 5% normal serum, 2% BSA, 
and 0.08% Na Azide in PBS) followed by a 24 h soak in antiserum raised against hα-
synuclein (syn211; 1:5000) or GFP (ab13970; 1:10 000) in primary diluent (0.3% Triton 
X-100, 2% normal serum, 2% BSA, and 0.08% Na Azide in PBS). Next, whole mounts were 
rinsed in PBS and incubated for 2 h in diluent (0.3% Triton X-100, 2% normal serum, and 
2% BSA in PBS) with appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories; 
1:500). After several more PBS rinses, tissues were incubated for 1 h in avidin-biotin-
horseradish peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories) in PBS. Horseradish peroxidase was 
reacted with DAB and H2O2 in Tris-buffered saline for 3 min to yield a permanent deposit. 
Finally, stained whole mounts were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air-dried overnight, 
dehydrated in an ascending series of alcohols, cleared in two xylene steps, and coverslipped 
with Cytoseal XYL (Richard-Allen Scientific). Brightfield photomicrographs were acquired 
using a Leica microscope fitted with a Spot Flex camera that was controlled using Spot 
Software (V4.7 Advanced Plus; Diagnostic Instruments).
Fluorescent microscopy
Free-floating sections were blocked in 5% horse serum and incubated in 1% BSA with the 
following primary antibodies raised against: hα-synuclein (syn211; 1:3000), GFP (ab13970; 
1:5000), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (AB144, Merck Millipore; 1:100), Syn-O2 
(1:2000) or Syn-F1 (1:1000). The latter two antibodies, gifts from Dr. O. El-Agnaf, have 
been previously characterized [26]. Appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary 
antibodies (Dylight 488 and Dylight 594, from Vector Laboratories; Alexa 488 and Alexa

 594 from Abcam) (1:400) were used for detection, and samples were mounted and 
coverslipped using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Sequential scans 
were performed with 10x and 63x Plan-Apochromat objectives using either (i) a 
LSM710NLO confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) with tunable lasers set at 490 
nm and 595 nm, or (ii) an IX2 UCB microscope (Olympus) with a DSU spinning disk unit 
(Olympus), a motorized stage (MBF Biosciences) and a EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu). As 
negative controls, tissue sections were processed as described above with the only exception 
that the primary antibody (e.g., anti-ChAT) was omitted from the initial incubations 
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
Fluorescent in situ hybridization
Samples were processed following a protocol modified from Raj et al. [19]. Twenty-six 
individual probes (18 bp each) were designed against WPRE and generated with 3′-amino 
modifications (BioSearch Technologies) coupled to a Quasar 570 fluorophore. Sections were 
first equilibrated to room temperature, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS 
and stored overnight in 70% ethanol. On the next day, after washing, they were incubated 
overnight at 37 °C in hybridization buffer containing labeled probes (125 nM) and, when 
needed, primary antibodies. The following antibodies were used: anti-hα-synuclein (syn211; 
1:1000) and anti-ChAT (AB144; 1:100). After washing, sections for in situ hybridization/
immunofluorescence were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in PBS with DyLight 488 
and DyLight 649 secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories; 1:200). Samples were labeled 
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (5 ng/ml), washed and finally mounted with Vectashield 
mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were obtained using a Zeiss Observer.Z1 
Microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a motorized stage and AxioCam MRm camera (Carl 
Zeiss). Figures were generated with 20x Plan-Apochromat (NA 0.8) and 63x Plan-
Apochomat (NA 1.4) objectives followed by computerized image stitching with ZEN 2 
software (Carl Zeiss).
RT-PCR
Samples were obtained from 40-μm fixed tissue sections. The right (injection side) ventral 
mesencephalon or dorso-medial portion of the medulla oblongata were dissected and pooled 
from equally spaced sections at Bregma: −4.56 to −6.48 mm or Bregma: −13.68 mm to 
−14.64. RNA was extracted using Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Ambion). cDNA was 
synthesized using 100 ng of total RNA (SuperScript® VILO Master Mix, Life 
Technologies). cDNA was amplified (30 cycles) using Power SYBR® Green (Applied 
Biosystems) and 0.25 μM primers (Sigma-Aldrich) in a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR 
System (Applied Biosystems). Primer pairs matching DNA sequences were: (i) 
5′caattccgtggtgttgtcgg forward and 5′caaagggagatccgactcgt reverse (WPRE); (ii) 
5′aatgaagaaggagccccacag forward and 5′aaggcatttcataagcctcattgtc reverse (hα-synuclein); 
(iii) 5′acgacggcaactacaagacc forward and 5′tcctccttgaagtcgatgcc reverse(GFP); (iv) 
5′gaccggttctgtcatgtcg forward and 5′acctggttcatcatcactaatcac reverse (hypoxantine 
phosphoribosyltransferase 1). RT-PCR products were separated on agarose gels. DNA 
signals were visualized with Gel Red Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Biotium) and imaged with 
InGenius imaging system and GeneSnap software (Syngene).

 Results
Efferent and afferent vagal terminals in the gastric wall
The first set of experiments was designed to assess the distribution of hα-synuclein and its 
accumulation within gastric nerve endings following its overexpression directly in the vagal 
system. AAVs carrying the DNA for hα-synuclein or GFP were injected into the left vagus 
nerve in the rat neck with the intent of transducing DMnX cells in the medulla oblongata as 
well as neuronal cell bodies within vagal ganglia, in particular the nodose ganglion (Fig. 1a 
and c). In agreement with previously published results [24], approximately 30% of the total 
DMnX neurons showed robust overexpression of hα-synuclein after vagal injections of hα-
synuclein-AAVs (Fig. 1b). Accumulation of the exogenous protein within gastric nerve 
endings was then assessed in animals killed several months (>6 months) after AAV 
treatment. Stomach whole mounts consisting of the longitudinal and circular smooth muscle 
layers encompassing the myenteric plexus were stained with a specific antibody that 
recognizes human but not rodent α-synuclein [10]. Robust immunoreactivity characterized 
fibers and nerve endings that, because of their morphology, could be identified as afferent 
vagal projections originating from neurons of the nodose ganglion [16, 28]. In particular, 
hα-synuclein was accumulated within intramuscular arrays (IMAs) of rectilinear terminals 
paralleling smooth muscle fibers and within highly arborizing intraganglionic laminar 
endings (IGLEs), the two main types of afferent vagal terminals (Fig. 1d and e). Earlier work 
has also elucidated the morphological features of efferent vagal fibers and nerve endings 
arising from cell bodies in the DMnX and terminating in the gastric wall [16, 27]. 
Immunoreactivity for hα-synuclein labeled preganglionic axons that, consistent with these 
features, formed varicosity-rich telodendria looping around a single neuron or multiple 
ganglionic cells (Fig. 1f). Similar to treatment with hα-synuclein-carrying AAVs, vagal 
injections of GFP-AAVs resulted in accumulation of the transduced protein within both 
viscerosensory and visceromotor projections in the rat stomach wall (data not shown).
Long-distance transmission of human α-synuclein from the brain to the stomach
To determine if α-synuclein was capable of traveling long-distance from the brain to 
peripheral tissues, hα-synuclein-carrying AAVs were unilaterally (right side) injected into 
the rat ventral mesencephalon immediately dorsal to the substantia nigra pars compacta. 
Animals were sacrificed at 2, 6 or 12 months, and the distribution of hα-synuclein 
throughout the brain was evaluated in tissue sections rostral and caudal to the midbrain. 
Immunoreactivity for hα-synuclein was observed in sections spanning from the forebrain to 
the medulla oblongata on the right (AAV-injected) and, to a much smaller extent, the left 
side of the brain (Fig. 2a). Robust staining characterized regions anatomically connected to 
the transduced midbrain areas that included the striatum and hypothalamus rostrally, and the 
locus coeruleus caudally (Fig. 2b and c) [14, 29]. This pattern of protein distribution was 
already observed at 2 months and persisted at 6 and 12 months post-injection.
Stomach whole mounts of these AAV-injected rats were then assessed for 
immunohistochemical evidence of the exogenous protein. No immunoreactivity for hα-
synuclein was observed in 6 rats killed at 2 months post-AAV injection; in contrast, hα-
synuclein-positive axons and terminal varicosities were detected in the myenteric plexus of 5

 out of 6 rats and 6 out of 10 animals sacrificed at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Analysis of 
labeled tissues revealed the presence of markedly swollen axons (Fig. 3a). Clusters of nerve 
endings containing hα-synuclein encircled individual neurons (Fig. 3b, c and f) or small 
groups of neurons (Fig. 3d and e) within the ganglia of the plexus. The morphology and 
distribution of these varicosity-rich fibers were strikingly similar to previous descriptions of 
anterogradely labeled vagal motor nerve endings immunoreactive for endogenous α-
synuclein [16, 27]. Consistent with progressive protein transfer and accumulation, myenteric 
ganglia with the highest density of robustly labeled terminals were found at the 12-month 
survival time (Fig. 3d–f). Of note, careful examination of gastric specimens for the presence 
of hα-synuclein-immunoreactive vagal afferents and viscerosensory terminals yielded 
negative results at both early and later time points post-AAV injections.
Human α-synuclein reaches nerve terminals in the stomach traveling via the vagus nerve
Accumulation of hα-synuclein within preganglionic vagal terminals of the myenteric plexus 
strongly suggests that, following its midbrain expression, the exogenous protein may reach 
peripheral tissues using the vagus nerve as a conduit. To substantiate this conclusion, a 
portion of the right (ipsilateral to the AAV injections) vagus nerve was collected from the 
neck of rats killed at 2, 6 and 12 months post-treatment. Examination of longitudinal 
sections of the Xth nerve stained for hα-synuclein revealed the presence of labeled fibers. 
Immunoreactive vagal projections were relatively rare and, for this reason, might have 
remained undetected even after careful evaluation of serial tissue sections. With this caveat 
in mind, results of our analysis indicated that hα-synuclein was absent in the vagus nerve of 
rats killed at 2 months (n = 6); labeled fibers were instead detected in >50% of nerves 
collected at either 6 (n = 6) or 12 (n = 7) months post-treatment (Fig. 4).
Detection of human α-synuclein protein within DMnX neurons in the medulla oblongata
Preganglionic terminals in the stomach wall originate in the DMnX, underscoring the 
importance that this medullary nucleus may have as a relay center for α-synuclein central-
to-peripheral transmission. Experiments were therefore carried out to examine DMnX-
containing medullary tissue for the presence of hα-synuclein mRNA and/or protein. Using 
RT-PCR, amplification reactions with hα-synuclein-hybridizing primers yielded no specific 
band at 3 weeks nor at 2, 6 and 12 months post-AAV treatment (Fig. 5a shows data at the 2-
month time point). Samples were also analyzed for evidence of other AAV-derived products 
and, in particular, WPRE (an enhancer element incorporated into the AAV genome) mRNA. 
RT-PCR measurements showed lack of WPRE expression in specimens from the dorsal 
medulla oblongata (Fig. 5a). Similarly, WPRE mRNA was not detectable within cholinergic 
DMnX neurons using a highly sensitive fluorescent in situ hybridization technique coupled 
with immunohistochemistry [19]. Medullary tissue sections were probed with multiple 
WPRE-targeting oligonucleotides, yet no hybridization signal was present at either early or 
later time points (images at 2 months are shown in Fig. 5b and c). In situ hybridization was 
also carried out on tissue sections from the higher (Bregma −4.92 and −5.64 mm) and lower 
(Bregma −8.16 mm) midbrain and from the pons (Bregma −9.00 mm). In high-midbrain 
sections, neuronal cell bodies containing WPRE mRNA occupied the entire substantia nigra 
pars compacta (Fig. 5d), and transduced neurons were also scattered within areas near the 
AAV injection site and needle track (Fig. 5e). No hybridization signal was instead detected

 in low-midbrain and pontine sections, further indicating lack of transmission/diffusion of 
viral particles toward brain regions distant to the mesencephalic target of AAV injections 
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
Despite the absence of hα-synuclein mRNA and markers of AAV transduction in the lower 
brainstem, immunoreactivity for the exogenous protein was detected in the medulla 
oblongata and the DMnX; progressive burden was indicated by a time-dependent increase in 
axons loaded with hα-synuclein at 2, 6 and 12 months (Fig. 6a and b). Sections of the 
medulla oblongata containing the DMnX were also double-stained for ChAT and hα-
synuclein (Fig. 6c–f). The presence of co-labeled DMnX projections supported 
accumulation of hα-synuclein within cholinergic vagal efferents (Fig. 6e and Supplementary 
Fig. 3). Other DMnX axons were immunoreactive for hα-synuclein but not ChAT and likely 
represented neuronal projections passing through or reaching the DMnX from higher brain 
regions (Fig. 6f and Supplementary Fig. 3). In caudal section of the medulla oblongata (e.g., 
Bregma −14.04 mm), ChAT-positive axons crossed the reticular formation and converged 
ventrolaterally to form the vagus nerve (Fig. 7a and b). Interestingly, at 6 and 12 but not 2 
months post-AAV injection, a few of these intramedullary vagal fibers showed co-
immunoreactivity for hα-synuclein (Fig. 7a and b).
Medullary tissue from AAV-injected rats was also stained with two conformation-specific 
antibodies, one that reacts with mature α-synuclein fibrils (Syn-F1) and the other 
recognizing both late (fibrils) and earlier (oligomers) forms of aggregated α-synuclein (Syn-
O2) [12, 26]. Co-staining with Syn-F1 and ChAT very rarely identified Syn-F1-
immunoreactive punctae within cholinergic vagal projections even at later time points (Fig. 
7c). Syn-O2 immunoreactivity was more robust and readily detectable in all AAV-injected 
rats. As shown in Fig. 7d, entire profiles of intramedullary vagal fibers could be 
distinguished by Syn-O2/ChAT co-labeling. For comparative purposes, tissue sections from 
the high-midbrain were also stained with Syn-F1 or Syn-O2; with either of the two 
antibodies, intense and diffuse immunoreactivity was observed within and outside the 
substantia nigra, labeling both neuronal cell bodies and neuronal projections of AAV-
injected rats (Supplementary Fig. 4).
A final set of experiments was carried out in rats that received unilateral midbrain injections 
of GFP- rather than hα-synuclein-carrying AAVs. GFP-AAV administration caused 
transduction features similar to those observed with hα-synuclein-AAVs: robust transduction 
was measured in midbrain samples, whereas WPRE mRNA remained undetectable in 
specimens from the dorsal medulla oblongata (Fig. 5f). In contrast to the results with hα-
synuclein-AAVs, however, GFP-AAV injections were not associated with presence of the 
transduced protein in vagal neurons; no GFP immunoreactivity was indeed observed within 
DMnX cholinergic axons in the medulla oblongata (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Similarly, 
vagus nerve sections and stomach whole mount preparations were consistently devoid of 
GFP labeling (Supplementary Fig. 5b and c).

 Discussion
Results of this study reveal a distinctive role of DMnX-derived vagal efferents in transferring 
α-synuclein from the brain to peripheral tissues. When hα-synuclein was overexpressed 
directly in the vagal system (DMnX and vagal ganglia), it efficiently traveled via both 
efferent and afferent fibers of the vagus nerve and reached visceromotor as well as 
viscerosensory terminals in the stomach wall (Fig. 8a). Quite in contrast, protein 
overexpression targeted to the midbrain resulted in detection and accumulation of hα-
synuclein only within vagal efferents terminating onto ganglionic neurons of the myenteric 
plexus (Fig. 8b). This preferential route of protein transmission is particularly remarkable if 
one considers that preganglionic efferents represent only a small percent of fibers forming 
the vagus nerve and that, based on their numerical prevalence within this nerve, a greater 
contribution of sensory afferents to α-synuclein transfer might have been expected. Indeed, 
according to estimates in various animal species and with different techniques, the ratio of 
efferent over afferent vagal projections has been reported to range between 1:10 and 1:3 [1, 
18]. Our present study focused on α-synuclein transmission from the brain to the gastric 
wall. However, given the extensive innervation provided to the small intestine by vagal 
preganglionic efferents [4], it is conceivable that α-synuclein may also travel from the brain 
to other sections of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the duodenum and jejunum. Further 
work is warranted to substantiate this possibility and determine whether accumulation of 
brain-derived α-synuclein throughout the gut may result in overt alterations of 
gastrointestinal function in this animal model.
Specific mechanisms underlying the propensity of visceromotor vagal fibers to accrue and 
deliver α-synuclein remain unclear. Braak and colleagues underscored a potential 
relationship between axonal length and myelination and vulnerability to α-synuclein 
pathology; morphological and metabolic differences between long, thin and poorly 
myelinated axons of the visceromotor vagal system vs. sturdily myelinated fibers relaying 
viscerosensory inputs may contribute to their distinctive role in pathological processes 
involving α-synuclein [6]. It is also noteworthy that earlier work investigating endogenous 
α-synuclein expression in the rat stomach and duodenum found that vagal afferent endings 
did not contain α-synuclein whereas virtually all vagal preganglionic projections expressed 
the protein [16]. It appears therefore that vagal neurons producing, transporting and utilizing 
α-synuclein under normal conditions may more efficiently serve as conduits for pathological 
protein transfer and be more vulnerable to α-synuclein accumulation.
Hα-synuclein was detected within cholinergic DMnX axons (by 2 months), within 
intramedullary fibers of the Xth nerve and within the vagus nerve itself in the rat neck (by 6 
months), supporting the conclusion that brain-to-stomach protein advancement progressively 
occurred through this pathway (Fig. 8b). The DMnX encompasses cholinergic cell bodies 
that only project outside the brain via axons forming the Xth cranial nerve (Fig. 8b). Data are 
therefore consistent with the interpretation that hα-synuclein, once generated within 
transduced midbrain neurons, proceeded toward the medulla oblongata and gained access 
into DMnX cells as a result of both intra- and inter-neuronal protein transfer. Based on our 
findings with conformation-specific antibodies, monomeric and oligomeric forms of α-
synuclein are likely to be primarily responsible for protein mobility. Crowding of α-

 synuclein within vagal neurons may subsequently trigger a localized process of further 
aggregation, leading to the formation of mature α-synuclein fibrils. An alternative 
explanation for the vagal accumulation of exogenous α-synuclein under our experimental 
conditions might have been that viral vectors injected into the ventral mesencephalon were 
able to reach and transduce DMnX cells. Several lines of evidence make this possibility 
highly unlikely. They include lack of detection of hα-synuclein mRNA and lack of 
hybridization of multiple oligonucleotides targeting WPRE mRNA (a viral vector marker) in 
DMnX-containing medullary tissue. Furthermore, midbrain injections of GFP-carrying 
AAVs did not result in any detection of GFP protein within DMnX neurons, underscoring 
the inability of these viral vectors to travel to the medulla oblongata and transduce vagal 
cells. Finally, a relatively non-specific diffusion of hα-synuclein-carrying AAVs would be 
difficult to reconcile with our observation of a targeted protein accumulation within 
preganglionic vagal efferents.
Together with earlier observations supporting a gut-to-brain transfer of α-synuclein [13, 15], 
our current findings indicate that protein transmission can proceed in either direction from 
distant organs to the brain or from the brain to peripheral tissues. This bidirectional potential 
is consistent with the ability of α-synuclein to move both anterogradely and retrogradely 
within neurons [7–9, 23]. An important translational implication of our study concerns the 
presence of α-synuclein pathology in peripheral tissues of synucleinopathy patients. 
Pathological forms of the protein have been detected in the gastrointestinal tract of patients 
with Parkinson’s disease as well as multiple system atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies 
[3, 17, 20]. In some instances, these peripheral α-synuclein lesions were observed in non-
symptomatic individuals, suggesting that they may represent initial or early manifestations 
of Parkinson’s disease [5, 21]. Our current results do not confute this possibility. They 
clearly indicate, however, that accumulation of α-synuclein in peripheral tissues may not 
always define site(s) of disease inception or be a marker of prodromal disease stages. The 
pattern of progression of α-synuclein pathology, caudo-rostral or rostro-caudal, may vary 
from patient to patient and differ, for example, in typical Parkinson’s disease as compared to 
sub-variants of the disease or other synucleinopathies.

 Fig. 8. 
Schematic representations of patterns of hα-synuclein accumulation after vagal or intra-
parenchymal injections of hα-synuclein-AAVs. a Following AAV injections into the vagus 
nerve, neuronal cell bodies in the DMnX and nodose ganglion produce hα-synuclein. The 
exogenous protein is then accumulated within efferent DMnX projections and afferent vagal 
fibers, reaching both visceromotor and viscerosensory nerve endings in the gastric wall. 
Afferent fibers also terminate onto neurons of the nucleus of the tractus solitaries (NTS) in 
the medulla oblongata (MO). b Following AAV injections into the ventral mesencephalon 
(VM), hα-synuclein is overexpressed within neurons that project toward lower brainstem 
regions. Traveling rostro-caudally through these axons, the exogenous protein reaches the 
medulla oblongata (MO) and gains access into DMnX neurons. The red arrow underscores 
the fact that passage into these cells would require a neuron-to-neuron jump. Hα-synuclein 
then uses efferent projections stemming from the DMnX and contained in the vagus nerve to 
reach preganglionic vagal nerve endings in the stomach wall.
