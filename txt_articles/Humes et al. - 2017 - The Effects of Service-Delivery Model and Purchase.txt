in Older Adults: A Randomized Double-
Blind Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial

Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine
efficacy of hearing aids in older adults using audiology best
practices, to evaluate the efficacy of an alternative over-the-
counter (OTC) intervention, and to examine the influence of
purchase price on outcomes for both service-delivery models.
Design: The design of this study was a single-site,
prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled randomized
trial with three parallel branches: (a) audiology best practices
(AB), (b) consumer decides OTC model (CD), and (c) placebo
devices (P). Outcome measures were obtained after a
typical 6-week trial period with follow-up 4-week AB-based
trial for those initially assigned to CD and P groups.
Setting: Older adults from the general community were
recruited via newspaper and community flyers to participate
at a university research clinic.
Participants: Participants were adults, ages 55–79 years,
with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. There were 188 eligible
participants: 163 enrolled as a volunteer sample, and
154 completed the intervention.
Intervention(s): All participants received the same high-
end digital mini-behind-the-ear hearing aids fitted bilaterally.
AB and P groups received best-practice services from
audiologists; differing mainly in use of appropriate (AB) or
placebo (P) hearing aid settings. CD participants self-selected
their own pre-programmed hearing aids via an OTC model.
Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures: Primary
outcome measure was a 66-item self-report, Profile of
Hearing Aid Benefit (Cox & Gilmore, 1990). Secondary
outcome measure was the Connected Speech Test (Cox,
Alexander, & Gilmore, 1987) benefit. Additional measures of
hearing-aid benefit, satisfaction, and usage were also obtained.
Results: Per-protocol analyses were performed. AB service-
delivery model was found to be efficacious for most of the
outcome measures, with moderate or large effect sizes
(Cohen’s d). CD service-delivery model was efficacious, with
similar effect sizes. However, CD group had a significantly
(p < .05) lower satisfaction and percentage (CD: 55%; AB:
81%; P: 36%) likely to purchase hearing aids after the trial.
Conclusions: Hearing aids are efficacious in older adults
for both AB and CD service-delivery models. CD model of
OTC service delivery yielded only slightly poorer outcomes
than the AB model. Efficacious OTC models may increase
accessibility and affordability of hearing aids for millions
of older adults. Purchase price had no effect on outcomes,
but a high percentage of those who rejected hearing aids
paid the typical price (85%).

A
ccording to the 2012 National Projections made
by the U.S. Census Bureau, about 50 million
Americans are over 65 years of age, representing
15% of the U.S. population (Ortman, Velkoff, & Hogan,
2014). Approximately 35% of those over age 65 in the
United States, or about 17.5 million older Americans, have
a significant hearing loss that is sufficient to make them
hearing-aid candidates (Cruickshanks, Zhan, & Zhong,
2010; Schoenborn & Marano, 1988). Yet, only about 20%

 of those older Americans who could benefit from hearing
aids actually seek them out, and of those who do seek
them out, only about 50%–70% are satisfied with them
and use their hearing aids regularly (Kochkin, 1993a,
1993b, 1993c, 2000, 2005, 2009; Perez & Edmonds, 2012).
The large discrepancy between the number of older adults
in need of hearing health care and those receiving benefit
from hearing aids was one of the motivating factors behind
the organization of a National Institute on Deafness and
Other Communication Disorders/National Institutes of
Health (NIDCD/NIH) working group on accessible and
affordable hearing health care for adults with mild-to-
moderate hearing loss. The central focus of this meeting
was the identification of research areas that would lead
to the improvement of hearing health care for adults with
mild-to-moderate hearing loss—in particular, enhancing
the accessibility and affordability of hearing health care
(Donahue, Dubno, & Beck, 2010). The end product of the
working group’s efforts was the identification and priori-
tization of several areas in need of additional research
that would ultimately lead to the realization of this goal
(Donahue et al., 2010). Although the focus was not exclu-
sively on older adults, it is clear that this age group represents
the one with the highest prevalence of mild-to-moderate
hearing loss and also represents the largest group of hearing
aid purchasers, with about two-thirds of the hearing aids
sold in the United States being purchased by older adults
(e.g., Strom, 2008).
The clinical trial described here addressed one of the
high-priority research questions identified by the working
group and summarized by Donahue et al. (2010). In partic-
ular, this study addressed the following research question
identified in that report: “How can current delivery systems
(including the system and the provider) be utilized or modi-
fied to increase accessibility and affordability of hearing
health care?” (para. 40) In addition, this project also ad-
dressed several other research questions not designated as
high priority but identified as important questions by the
working group, including:
•
“What is the comparative effectiveness between two
delivery schemes (current best practice vs. others),
with technology held constant?” (para. 40);
•
“What is the minimal hearing health care delivery
system needed for successful outcomes and quality
care?” (para. 40); and
•
“How does an individual define hearing aid value
(performance/satisfaction/benefit related to cost)?”
(para. 38)
As summarized by Donahue et al. (2010), the price
per hearing aid at that time ranged from about $1,200 to
$2,900 per device. With two devices typically purchased
per person in the United States, this amounts to a cost of
$2,400 to $5,800 per person. Assuming a device life expec-
tancy of 5 years, older adults can expect to pay tens of
thousands of dollars for hearing health care in their later
years. Of course, these are just the purchase prices and
do not include significant annual expenditures on mainte-
nance, including the purchase of batteries (~$100/year per
person). It should be noted, however, that other hearing-
aid delivery models have been developed since the report
by Donahue et al. (2010)—for example, delivery through
large-volume retailers such as Costco—that have cut pur-
chase prices for the consumer dramatically (e.g., Kasewurm,
2014).
There are two primary components to the average
retail price of hearing aids sold in the United States: (a) the
cost of the devices themselves from the manufacturer and
(b) the fees for services rendered by the professionals deliv-
ering the devices. The production costs of most hearing aids
are relatively low, although production costs do not include
other costs such as research and development, marketing,
technical support, and so on. For example, for the devices
used in this project—good-quality devices with multiple-
channel compression, feedback cancellation, noise reduction,
and directional microphones—the production costs were
about $100/aid at study onset. Extremely high-volume dis-
pensers of these devices, such as Costco and the Veterans
Administration, were charged by the manufacturer about
$250–$500 per aid at that time. Wholesale prices to lower-
volume dispensers for these devices ranged from about
$900–$1,200, and the average retail price charged by these
dispensers for these same aids in the United States was about
$2,000–$3,000 per aid at that time. Of course, the difference
between the dispenser’s wholesale price paid and retail price
charged is not all profit. The dispenser too has a variety of
business expenses to cover. In part, the mark-up from the
dispenser’s cost to the consumer’s purchase price has been
justified on the basis of superior outcomes associated with
the audiologist-based service-delivery model. No prior
study, however, has documented differences in outcomes
between the higher-priced audiologist-based service-delivery
model and possible lower-priced alternative service-delivery
models, including the over-the-counter (OTC), try-and-select
service delivery model.
The NIDCD/NIH working group meeting and report
sparked broader interest in the accessibility and affordability
of hearing health care. The meeting and report provided
the impetus for two additional recent influential reports. The
first of these two subsequent reports was by the President’s
Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST,
2015). This report began by stating,
Untreated hearing loss, especially in older Americans,
is a substantial national problem. Only a fraction of
consumers who need assistance with hearing obtain
and use hearing aids, in large part because of high
cost, complex dispensing procedures, social stigma,
and performance shortfalls. (p. 1)
The PCAST report went on to identify several problems
with the classification of current hearing technologies by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and with the
existing service-delivery systems, advocating throughout
the report for a range of technologies and service-delivery

 models, as well as proposing modification of FDA regula-
tions to parallel those addressing devices for vision problems.
More recently, the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) published a report
titled, Hearing Health Care for Adults: Priorities for Improv-
ing Access and Affordability (NASEM, 2016). In the intro-
duction of this report, the following was noted:
The loss of hearing—be it gradual or acute, mild or
severe, present since birth or acquired in older age—
can have significant effects on one’s communication
abilities, quality of life, social participation, and health.
Despite this, many people with hearing loss do not
seek or receive hearing health care. The reasons are
numerous, complex, and often interconnected. For
some, hearing health care is not affordable. For others,
the appropriate services are difficult to access, or
individuals do not know how or where to access
them . . . The unmet need for hearing health care
is high. Estimates of hearing aid use are that 67 to
86 percent of adults who may benefit from hearing
aids do not use them ... This study focuses on improving
the accessibility and affordability of hearing health
care for adults of all ages . . . Hearing health care
is viewed through the social-ecological model that
emphasizes the multiple levels of support and action
needed throughout society to promote hearing and
communication and reduce hearing loss and its
effects. (pp. 1–2)
The report then proceeds to advocate for a wide range of
technologies and service-delivery models to better meet the
hearing-health-care needs of millions of older Americans
with impaired hearing. The report recommends strongly
that the FDA create a new category of technology, “over-
the-counter wearable hearing devices,” with corresponding
changes in the ways such devices would be delivered to
consumers.
Clearly, the OTC service-delivery approach is designed
to address affordability by bypassing the additional profes-
sional services often bundled with the price of the devices—
that is, it is assumed that a hearing aid purchased from an
audiologist using the best-practices model of service delivery
(e.g., Kochkin et al., 2010; Valente et al., 2006) would be
sold to the consumer at a higher price than the same device
purchased via an OTC service-delivery model. Somewhat
surprisingly, we could not find prior peer-reviewed publica-
tions on the impact of purchase price itself on measured
hearing aid outcomes. Thus, even within a given service-
delivery model, the influence of purchase price on outcome
measures—especially self-report measures—is unknown.
This may complicate the comparison of outcomes for typi-
cally higher priced advanced hearing aids delivered through
an audiology-based best-practices service-delivery model
and lower priced basic devices delivered through an OTC
service-delivery model. Differences in outcomes across these
two models could be due to actual differences in service-
delivery processes, price, or both.
With the foregoing context in mind, this article
describes in detail the first-ever placebo-controlled double-
blind randomized clinical trial of hearing aid outcomes.
Two service-delivery models were included in the clinical
trial: an audiology-based best-practices (AB) model and
an OTC consumer-decides (CD) model. The placebo (P)
group received the same services as the participants in
the AB group, but the hearing aids were programmed to
be acoustically transparent (0-dB insertion gain). Impor-
tantly, by inclusion of the placebo group in this trial, the
efficacy of both the best-practices AB model and the alter-
native OTC CD treatment can be established (e.g., Inter-
national Conference on Harmonization, 1998). Thus, there
were three parallel branches in this clinical trial, with partic-
ipants randomly assigned to one of the branches following
an eligibility screen.
The impact of the purchase price of the hearing
aids on outcomes was also evaluated in this trial. The first
half of the trial’s participants paid $3,600 for their pair of
hearing aids, which was considered a typical purchase price
at study onset, whereas the subsequent half of participants
paid $600 per pair, which was considered a reduced purchase
price. Ideally, it would have been preferred to randomly
assign the purchase price as well as the service-delivery
model, but it was deemed too difficult to do so while main-
taining the blinding of the participants and the audiologists
with regard to purchase price.
In this report, we provide full procedural details and a
detailed examination of the results, all based on per-protocol
analyses. In addition, the online supplemental materials
contain a full copy of the detailed clinical trial protocol (see
Supplemental Material S1) and all data-collection forms

Method
Overview of Design
This was a placebo-controlled double-blind random-
ized clinical trial with three parallel branches: audiology-
based (AB) best-practices service delivery, consumer-decides
(CD) or OTC service delivery, and placebo (P). The pur-
chase price of the hearing aids provided to the participants
was also manipulated: either a “typical” purchase price of
U.S. $3,600 or a reduced purchase price of U.S. $600 for
both hearing aids. As noted previously, this was done in a
stratified manner with roughly the first half of study partici-
pants paying the typical price and the second half paying
the reduced price.
Hearing Aids
The study devices provided to all participants in the
trial were ReSound Alera 9 mini-behind-the-ear (BTE)
open-fit hearing aids having 17 log10-frequency-based (warp)
compression bands with nine gain handles and four programs
available. These mini-BTE open-fit devices are representative

 of the most popular type of hearing aid sold in the United
States to older adults (e.g., Kochkin, 2011). All hearing aids
were tested in the Verifit test box (Model VF-1; Software
Version 3.10.9) to ensure that they met American National
Standards Institute (ANSI, 2009) specifications prior to
programming. The function of the directional microphone
systems was also verified acoustically at that time. Default
programming for all devices made use of fixed directional
microphones, dynamic feedback suppression, and noise
reduction. The four programs were configured to serve as a
volume control for all study participants. For the AB and
CD groups, the default program at start-up (Program 1)
had a nominal output level of 0 dB volume-control setting
for all hearing aids. Basically, at this setting, the output
was set to match the NAL-NL2 (i.e., National Acoustic
Laboratories’ Non-Linear Prescription Formula, Version 2)
targets at each frequency. Programs 2 and 3 represented
across-frequency decreases in this output in steps of X and
2X dB, respectively, whereas Program 4 was an increase
in output of X dB, all relative to the output of Program 1
(0 dB). Thus, the programs simply raised and lowered the
entire NAL-NL2 response up or down by various amounts
as with a volume control. The value of X varied with the
severity of high-frequency hearing loss (high-frequency
pure-tone-average [HFPTA] based on hearing thresholds
at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) such that X = 4 dB for mild
hearing loss (29 < HFPTA < 39 dB HL; ANSI, 2010) and
X = 8 dB for more severe hearing loss (HFPTA ≥ 65 dB HL).
These are just two examples of several variations in X. Fur-
ther details can be found in the ABCD Protocol Manual
(see online Supplemental Material S1). For the partici-
pants in the placebo group, their hearing aids programmed
for 0-dB insertion gain, had minor gain variation across
programs as follows: Program 1 = +2 dB; Program 2 = +1 dB;
Program 3 = 0 dB; and Program 4 = +3 dB. At the 6-week
follow-up (Session 3), hearing aid datalogging revealed
that, on average, the hearing aids were in Program 1 74%
of the time with no significant (p > .10) variations in this
percentage across groups.
Some placebo devices made use of omnidirectional
microphones (Po; n = 35) and others made use of the default
directional microphones (Pd; n = 20). It was unclear whether
the loss of some of the front–back localization ability due
to a microphone location above the pinna (Chung, Neuman,
& Higgins, 2008; Kuk, Korhonen, Lau, Keenan, & Norgaard,
2013) should also be restored for the placebo devices. This
led to the exploration of the two different microphone
options for the placebo group. In both cases, the frequency-
gain characteristics were adjusted to achieve acoustic
transparency—that is, flat insertion gain.
All markings and materials revealing manufacturer
or model of the devices were obscured. Manufacturer
and model were revealed to all participants only after the
conclusion of the entire trial. There were a few exceptions,
primarily involving the desire to purchase manufacturer
compatible accessories, but in these cases the participant
signed a confidentiality agreement regarding the identity of
the manufacturer. All hearing-aid fits were bilateral.
Participant Recruitment, Selection,
and Randomization
Participants were recruited primarily by ads posted
in the local newspapers and around the community. All
testing of this volunteer sample took place in a university
research clinic at Indiana University, Bloomington. Those
interested in participating contacted the Clinical Trials
Coordinator (CTC) by phone for an initial eligibility screen
and then arranged an initial assessment to make a final
determination of eligibility (Session 1). Inclusion criteria were
as follows: (a) age 55–79 years; (b) English as native lan-
guage; (c) Mini-Mental State Exam–2nd Edition (MMSE-2
SV; Folstein, Folstein, White, & Messer, 2010) score > 25;
(d) no prior hearing aid experience; and (e) pure-tone air-
conduction hearing thresholds consistent with age-related
hearing loss, within the fitting guidelines of the study hear-
ing aid, and bilaterally symmetrical. Exclusion criteria were
as follows: (a) presence of a medically treatable ear condi-
tion; (b) bilateral, flat tympanograms; (c) known fluctuating
or rapidly progressing hearing loss; (d) presence of cognitive,
medical, or language-based conditions that limited ability
to complete all test procedures; (e) currently taking or recently
taken any platinum-based cancer drugs or mycin-family
antibiotics; (f) previously diagnosed with either multiple
sclerosis or Meniere’s disease; (g) failure to seek or waive
medical evaluation and clearance following hearing evalua-
tion; and (h) unwillingness to be randomly assigned to
a treatment group. Two individuals enrolled were younger
than specified (53, 54 years) and one was older (83 years).
After each participant was consented for Session 1,
measures completed were as follows: (a) otoscopic exami-
nation of both ears, (b) a complete audiological assessment,
(c) MMSE-2 SV, and (d) a detailed case history. Following
otoscopy, the audiological assessment began with 226-Hz
tympanometry and automated ipsilateral pure-tone acoustic
reflex threshold measurement at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz
using a Grason-Stadler Instruments (GSI) Model 39 immit-
tance device. Air-conduction pure-tone audiometry followed,
using a calibrated GSI-61 audiometer with Etymotic Research
ER-3A insert earphones, at octave intervals from 250 Hz
through 8000 Hz plus 1500, 3000, and 6000 Hz. Based on
the foregoing inclusion and exclusion criteria, a preliminary
determination of eligibility was made at this time. Those
determined to be eligible completed the following mea-
sures in sequence: (a) speech reception threshold (SRT) for
Central Institute for the Deaf (CID) W-1 spondaic words
(Hirsh et al., 1952) using monitored live voice and 5-dB as-
cending step size; (b) word-recognition scores for recorded
CID W-22 monosyllabic words (Department of Veterans
Affairs, 2006) presented at 40 dB above SRT; (c) loudness
discomfort level (LDL) measured with warble-tone stimuli
centered at 500 Hz and 3000 Hz and using the instruc-
tions and 7-point scale from Cox, Alexander, Taylor, and
Gray (1997); and (d) bone-conduction hearing thresholds
at octave intervals from 250 Hz through 4000 Hz, plus
1500 Hz and 3000 Hz. After the audiological assessment,
a sound-field measure of speech audiometry using a standard

 recording of the Connected Speech Test (CST; Cox, Alexander,
& Gilmore, 1987) was completed using two passages (50 key
words). This unaided sound-field CST score was used to
block study participants prior to randomization (see below).
Next, the MMSE-2 SV was completed, followed by a de-
tailed case history (the full case history can be found in the
ABCD Protocol Manual, see online Supplemental Material
S1). A final determination of eligibility was then made and
the Session 1 participant was counseled about the results
(with a significant other present during the counseling, if
desired). Acoustical real-ear-to-coupler differences (RECDs)
were then measured for all participants determined to be
eligible for the clinical trial. One of two audiologists, A1 or
A2, was assigned to complete these Session 1 measures. As
shown in the flow diagram in Figure 1, 323 individuals were
assessed for eligibility. The trial commenced November 2,
2012, and data collection ended August 31, 2016, after
enrollment targets based on preliminary statistical power
calculations were met.
At completion of Session 1, eligible participants for
the clinical trial (n = 188; see Figure 1) were escorted to
the office of the CTC and were informed about the trial.
Of the 188 eligible individuals, 163 enrolled in the trial,
were consented for the trial, agreed to return for Session 2
(typically the next day), and were subsequently randomized
to one of three groups: AB, CD, or P. Figure 1 presents
additional information about the random allocation of par-
ticipants and their completion of the trial. Of the 163 partic-
ipants who enrolled, 98% self-reported their race as White
and their ethnicity as not Hispanic or Latino, 78% had a
college degree, and 80% reported annual household income
greater than $45,000. Table 1 provides other demographic
information for each group.
Randomization was accomplished by generating col-
umns of random numbers in a spreadsheet prior to study
initiation. The a priori probability of assignment of a given
participant to group AB, CD, or P was .33. In generating
the randomization list for the study, iterations of the random-
ization were produced and evaluated until observed counts
in each block of 100 randomizations were approximately
32–34 per group. For example, Participant 1 (P1), the first
to enroll after screening, was designated by this randomi-
zation for assignment to group AB, the second partici-
pant (P2) to AB, P3 to CD, … P100 to P. Tallies of group

 assignments according to this randomization of the first 100
participants needed to be 32–34 participants for each of the
three groups. If not, a new randomization list was gener-
ated. Once this was accomplished for the first set of 100
participants, a randomization list was then generated for a
second and third set of 100 participants in similar fashion.
Separate randomization lists were generated a priori for par-
ticipants in each of the following unaided CST-performance
categories: (a) CST ≤ 40%; (b) 40% < CST < 68%; and
(c) CST ≥ 68%. The blocking of randomization by baseline
(i.e., unaided) CST performance was necessary because sev-
eral of the outcome measures included in the trial were rela-
tive measures of benefit. It is well known that the amount
of benefit measured varies with the initial baseline perfor-
mance. For example, those with high CST scores at unaided
baseline will likely show smaller amounts of aided benefit,
whereas those with lower baseline scores will likely show
larger improvements when aided. By blocking the randomi-
zation based on CST baseline (i.e., unaided) performance
prior to random assignment to groups AB, CD, or P, it was
more likely that each group would include a similar number
of low, medium, and high baseline CST scores and, therefore,
would not bias the subsequent benefit measures derived for
each group.
Only the CTC and the principal investigator (PI) had
knowledge of and access to the randomization lists. The
virtual lists were password-protected to prevent access by
others on the research team. Once participants were assigned,
those assignments were also secured digitally via password
protection with hardcopy information secured via a locked
file cabinet in the office of the CTC. The PI generated the
random allocation sequences, and the CTC enrolled partici-
pants and assigned them to groups accordingly.
Clinical Trial Baseline Measures
and Interventions (Session 2)
The procedures in Session 2 varied with group assign-
ment. First, for all participants, unaided baseline scores
were collected for two self-report outcome measures, the
66-item Profile of Hearing Aid Performance (PHAP; Cox
& Gilmore, 1990) and the 25-item Hearing Handicap Inven-
tory for the Elderly (HHIE; Ventry & Weinstein, 1982).
Next, for groups AB and P, the procedures in Session 2
were nearly identical except that the hearing aids for the
P participants were programmed to be acoustically trans-
parent. First, the participant examined three colors of hear-
ing aids available (gray, beige, brown) and selected the desired
color. Audiologist A1 or A2, typically the same individual
who worked with the participant in Session 1, selected the
appropriate dome size (S, M, L, or tulip) and tubing length
(0, 1, 2, or 3). ReSound’s Aventa programming software
(Version 3.6) was used to program the hearing aids. For those
in group AB, the participant’s audiograms were used to gen-
erate target gain prescriptions using the common NAL-NL2
(Dillon, Keidser, Ching, Flax, & Brewer, 2011) formula to
compensate for the participant’s hearing loss. (Using soft-
ware obtained directly from the National Acoustics Labo-
ratories [NAL], we verified that the targets generated in the
Aventa software matched those intended for NAL-NL2
prescriptions. This is necessary because not all versions of
“NAL-NL2” targets are actually equivalent to the desired
targets; see, e.g., Sanders, Stoody, Weber, & Mueller, 2015.)
For AB and the first 20 P participants, the default program-
ming options were as follows: Fitting–experienced non-
linear; Binaural Correction–off; Directionality–fixed;
Directional Mix–very low; Digital Feedback Suppression
(DFS)–moderate; Expansion–off; Noise Tracker II–per
environment; Wind Guard–off; Environmental Optimizer–
0 dB; Tinnitus Sound Generator–off. For the subsequent
35 participants in group P, the microphone settings were
changed from fixed to omnidirectional. For both AB and
P participants, verification of the desired acoustic output of
the hearing aids was accomplished via real-ear measurements
using an Audioscan Verifit system (Model VF-1; Software
Version 3.10.9). Figure 2 demonstrates good matches between
prescribed and measured real-ear responses for speech input
(“carrot passage” stimulus) for the AB group. Flat 0-dB
insertion gain was also verified with real-ear measurements
for the P group using pure-tone input stimuli, and Figure 3
demonstrates good matches to those targets. In both cases,
the input level used for real-ear measures shown in Figures 2
and 3 was 65 dB SPL. Real-ear responses for input levels
of 55 dB SPL and 75 dB SPL were also obtained for AB
participants, but no fine-tuning of the response took place
for these input levels. All real-ear measurements took place
with the participant and the audiologist located in a sound-
attenuating test booth meeting standards for ears-uncovered
threshold testing (ANSI, 2013).
Next, for the AB participants only, pure-tone sweeps
were run at 85 dB SPL to determine if any of these stimuli
were uncomfortably loud using the prior LDL rating scale.
The audiologist instructed the wearer to quickly raise his or
her hand when an uncomfortably loud tone-burst (“beep”)
was heard and observed the wearer while the sweep pro-
gressed from 250 Hz through 6000 Hz. Affirmative responses
resulted in a 4-dB decrease in maximum output for that

 hearing aid at a frequency aligned with the affirmative re-
sponse, and the 85-dB sweep was repeated. This process
continued until the participant failed to raise his or her
hand during a sweep. Once each hearing aid’s maximum
output had been set individually, both hearing aids were
turned on and the 85-dB SPL sweep repeated for final verifi-
cation of maximum output. Any indications of “uncomfort-
ably loud” sound at this time resulted in a 2-dB reduction
of maximum output of both hearing aids. For the 53 AB
participants (106 hearing aids), no adjustments in maximum
output were made in either ear for frequencies of 250 Hz,
500 Hz, or 750 Hz. The greatest number of adjustments
occurred at 3000 Hz, with approximately 25% of the partici-
pants requiring adjustment. Of these, for 13 of the 24 hear-
ing aids adjusted at 3000 Hz, adjustments were the smallest
possible (4 dB), and only 5 of 24 exceeded two decrements
(8 dB). Further adjustments in maximum output when the
AB participant was wearing both hearing aids were very
rare (5 out of a possible 477; 53 wearers × 9 frequencies).
Matches to the 65-dB speech targets were not verified again
after adjustments to maximum output were made following
the 85-dB sweep. Given the low occurrence and small size
of maximum output adjustments for the 85-dB stimulus
summarized above, together with the nonlinear nature of
the programmed output of the devices, it is unlikely that
the responses for a 65-dB speech stimulus were impacted
by these output adjustments. For the P participants, given
the low gain of the devices, maximum output levels were
established by entering 0 dB HL thresholds at all frequen-
cies into the programming software (ReSound Aventa,
Version 3.6) and using the first-fit option to generate the
values for maximum power output. This resulted in maxi-
mum power output levels of 89, 94, 95, 98, and 100 dB SPL
(re: HA-1 2-cm3 coupler) at octave intervals from 250 Hz
through 4000 Hz and 94, 97, 99, and 100 dB SPL at oc-
tave intervals from 750 Hz through 6000 Hz. Based on the
LDLs measured in each ear at 500 Hz and 3000 Hz, the

 default maximum power outputs noted above may have
exceeded LDL for 10% or fewer of the P participants in
one or both ears and at one or both frequencies.
This portion of Session 2 for both group AB and P
participants concluded with a series of electroacoustic mea-
surements performed on each hearing aid with an HA-1
2-cm3 coupler in the Verifit test box. The latter measures
were used to facilitate comparisons to subsequent electro-
acoustic measurements when the participants returned
6 weeks later for Session 3.
Audiologist A1 or A2 did the hearing aid program-
ming, real-ear verification, and any required fine-tuning
to match targeted output. A third audiologist, A3, was
blinded regarding group AB or P and was involved with
the remainder of Session 2 for these two groups. This
consisted of a 45–60-minute hearing aid orientation session
during which Audiologist A3 reviewed the components,
features, and function of the hearing aids; the insertion and
removal of batteries; the insertion and removal of the hearing
aids; maintenance practices; telephone use; and adjustment
of volume. Supervised hands-on practice was provided for
several of these skills. Participants were also counselled
about benefits and limitations of hearing aids and effective
communication strategies to use. A graduated usage schedule
was also recommended for AB and P participants, beginning
with relatively quiet listening conditions and at least 4 hours
per day for the first week, progressively increasing the com-
plexity of the listening conditions and the duration of usage
(+2 hours/day each week). All participants (AB, CD, P)
also received a written user guide for the hearing aids, which
was modified from the manufacturer’s guide to include much
of this same information.
The use of probe-tube-microphone measurements
to fine-tune the devices to the hearing aid wearer’s hearing
loss and the inclusion of hearing aid orientation informa-
tion, including hands-on practice with these skills, are con-
sidered to be to critical aspects of audiology best practices
(AB; Kochkin et al., 2010; Valente et al., 2006). Participants
in both AB and P groups received these services. Partici-
pants in the CD group, however, did not receive real-ear
adjustments of their hearing aids’ response or a hearing aid
orientation.
For the CD participants, Session 2 commenced with
the CTC escorting the participant to a small room. Containers
for the ear tips/domes and tubing to be used—together with
three bins containing six hearing aids each, with the hearing
aids in each bin differing only in color (gray, beige, brown)—
were located on a table in this room. Each bin was parti-
tioned into three compartments; each compartment contained
a pair of hearing aids labeled X, Y, or Z and programmed
in advance to match the NAL-NL2 acoustic output pre-
scriptions for the three most common patterns of hearing
loss among older adults in the United States (Ciletti &
Flamme, 2008). The three specific audiograms used for pro-
gramming hearing aids X, Y, and Z are shown in Figure 4.
The default programming options for these hearing aids
were identical to those for the AB participants in regard
to the various features of the hearing aids (microphone,
feedback suppression, noise reduction, etc.). Maximum
output levels for these devices were established by enter-
ing the pure-tone thresholds from the corresponding X,
Y, or Z audiogram (see Figure 4) and using the first-fit op-
tion in the Aventa programming software to set the maxi-
mum power output levels. The resulting maximum output
values are provided in Table 2.
The participant watched a brief instructional video
(see online Supplemental Material S3) overviewing the
hearing aid self-selection process, then completed each step
of the self-selection process. A hardcopy of the step-by-
step instructions was also provided to the participant in the
form of three binders, with the contents based on instruc-
tions provided for self-fitting hearing aids (Caposecco,
Hickson, & Meyer, 2011). The CD participant first selected
the desired hearing-aid color, examining several in the mir-
ror; then selected an appropriately sized ear tip and tube;
then the particular acoustic characteristics desired (X, Y, or
Z). A tablet computer was available to provide standardized
samples of speech, music, and environmental sounds for
listening. Participants were allowed to have a significant

being among the most common audiometric configurations, were
used to pre-match the hearing aids for the consumer decides/
over-the-counter (CD) participants to NAL-NL2 targets.

 other in the room with them during the selection process
(only one CD participant opted to do so). As the participant
tried the domes, tubes, and hearing aids, those in which he
or she was not interested or did not fit properly were placed
in a bin labeled “No.” When the participant’s selections
were finalized, the participant pressed a button to alert the
CTC that the selections had been made. The CTC returned
to the room, recorded these selections, and noted the con-
tents of the other bin labeled “No.” Based on the tallies of
items in the “No” bin, 65% of the CD participants had tried
more than one dome, 59% tried more than one tubing size,
and 90% tried more than one hearing aid. Typically, two to
four hearing aids (out of six available) were in the “No” bin
when the participant’s selection process had been completed.
For all participants, Session 2 ended with a meeting
with the CTC, during which the devices were delivered to
the participant for use during the 6-week trial. Each partic-
ipant was provided with the devices, tubes, and domes
selected (as well as an extra set of domes); batteries; clean-
ing tools; and user guide. Payment was also collected at
the end of this session. Participants either paid $3,600 with
$300 (8.33%) credits for the completion of Sessions 2 and
3, or $600 with $50 (8.33%) credits for the completion of
Sessions 2 and 3. The Session 2 credits were applied im-
mediately upon completion of Session 2 and reduced the
purchase price to $3,300 or $550. The final credit was
disbursed as a check for either $300 or $50 at the comple-
tion of Session 3. The participants were not informed about
the use of two different purchase prices until the final par-
ticipant completed all testing. This deception was approved
by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board and
was necessary so as to assess the impact of purchase price
on outcomes. After the final participant had completed the
study, those paying the higher price received a letter from
the PI and CTC informing them of the deception and
a check for the difference in price ($2,500). Audiologists
A1–A4 knew that two different purchase prices were being
used in the trial, but they believed this was assigned ran-
domly from participant to participant throughout the study,
rather than blocked into two phases. The audiologists,
moreover, were blind to the purchase price paid by each
participant, as well as the blocking of payment in two
phases during the trial, until completion of the entire trial.
If any of the participants had problems with their
devices during the trial, they were asked to contact the
CTC by phone. The CTC initially instructed the participant
to review the user guide for assistance. If the participant
did so and the problem persisted, and the problem was
occurring for just one device, the CTC instructed the par-
ticipant to remove both devices and compare them to see
if anything differed between the two with regard to the
tubing, dome, or battery. If the problem persisted, for either
one or both hearing aids, the CTC made an appointment
for an unscheduled visit. Unscheduled visits began with the
CTC performing a visual inspection of the devices. If no
problems were apparent, the CTC had the participant
remove the devices and contacted Audiologist A1 or A2,
whichever one had worked with this participant previously
in Sessions 1 and 2. The audiologist first examined the
hearing aids and, if nothing was found, next performed
otoscopy, tympanometry, or other audiological measures
to determine the nature of the problem and remedy it accord-
ingly. The CTC received phone calls from a total of 31 par-
ticipants between Sessions 2 and 3: 12 from AB participants,
10 from CD participants, and 9 from P participants. Of
these, six AB, four CD, and six P participants came in for
an unscheduled visit. Most complained of physical discom-
fort or irritation. Four of the six AB unscheduled visits,
three of the four CD unscheduled visits, and two of the
six P unscheduled visits resulted in changes to the domes
or tubes. In addition, one of the two hearing aids were
replaced for one AB participant (lost hearing aid) and one
CD participant (broken battery door).
Clinical Trial Post-Intervention
Outcomes (Session 3)
During Session 3, typically 6 weeks after the initial fit of
the hearing aids in Session 2 (M = 44.5 days; SD = 10.1 days),
either Audiologist A1 or A2 (the one not involved in Ses-
sion 2 programming) obtained as-worn aided CST scores
and inspected the participant’s ears, hearing aids, tubes, and
domes, then obtained as-worn electroacoustic performance
measures for each hearing aid. An inspection checklist was
used to note any issues identified. Following completion of
these as-worn measures, the hearing aids were reconditioned
as needed (domes cleaned, kinked tubing replaced, dead or
weak batteries replaced, etc.) and post-maintenance electro-
acoustic measures were obtained in the Verifit test box.
Next, outcome measures were then obtained by another
audiologist, A4. A4 was blind to participant group. The
primary outcome measure for this trial was the Profile
of Hearing Aid Benefit (PHAB). The PHAB score, a rel-
ative benefit measure, is the difference between the unaided
and aided scores on the PHAP. The unaided PHAP was ad-
ministered prior to (Session 2) and the aided PHAP follow-
ing a 6-week period of hearing-aid use (Session 3), with the
difference in ratings on the questionnaire used to compute
the PHAB scores. Based on correlational and factor analyses
of the seven PHAP subscales (unaided, aided, and difference
or PHAB), the five communication-related subscales (Familiar
Talkers, Ease of Communication, Reverberation, Reduced
Cues, and Background Noise) were averaged to form a
PHABglobal score, and the other two subscales (Aversiveness
of Sound, Distorted Sound) were averaged to form a
PHABavds score. The secondary outcome measure to be
used in this clinical trial was derived from the unaided and
aided CST speech-recognition scores. The secondary out-
come measure was based on the difference in aided and
unaided CST scores, CST benefit. The aided CST score was
based on one passage pair or 50 key words and, like the
unaided CST score, was obtained for a speech level of 65 dB
SPL and a signal-to-babble ratio (SBR) of +3 dB. The speech
level and SBR are similar to those used previously for the
CST, including in a randomized clinical trial comparing
hearing aids (Larson et al., 2000).

 Because hearing-aid outcome in older adults has been
demonstrated to be a multidimensional construct with three
to four dimensions (Humes, 2001, 2003; Humes & Krull,
2012), some additional outcome measures were obtained
from all participants. These included the self-reported bene-
fit, measured as the difference between the unaided and
aided HHIE scores; a 32-item survey of satisfaction with
hearing-aid function (Humes, Garner, Wilson, & Barlow,
2001; Kochkin, 2000), referred to here as the Hearing Aid
Satisfaction Survey (HASS); and the average daily usage
of the hearing aid in hours/day, obtained from the data-
logging feature of the hearing aids used in this trial. For the
HASS, only 19 of the items dealing with hearing aid fea-
tures and functions and the 13 pertaining to satisfaction with
dispenser-related processes were included; the 10 additional
items on satisfaction with performance in various listening
situations were excluded from this trial due to redundancy
with the PHAP. The items from each of these two subsec-
tions of the HASS were averaged (i.e., mean) to produce
the HASShaf and HASSdisp satisfaction scores for the
hearing-aid features/functions and the dispenser, respec-
tively. For the measure of hearing aid usage, the total
number of hours used from the data-logger was divided by
the number of days between Sessions 2 and 3 to derive a
measure of average hours used per day, or daily usage.
Next, all participants completed the Practical Hearing
Aid Skills Test–Revised (PHAST-R; Doherty & Desjardins,
2012), modified slightly for open-fit BTE devices, to objectively
assess the participant’s ability to use and care for the hearing
aids. A questionnaire about participation in musical train-
ing or auditory training during the trial period was also
administered. Less than 2% of participants in the AB, CD,
and P groups indicated participating in any auditory-based
training exercises during the trial period, with no significant
differences among the groups, χ2 (2) = 2.28, p > .05. With
regard to musical experience or training during the trial,
16%–21% of each group reported singing or playing a musical
instrument for at least 20 min twice per week, with no signifi-
cant differences among the groups, χ2 (2) = 0.50, p > .05.
Each participant was then asked, “Now that you’ve
worn these hearing aids for about 6 weeks, are you inter-
ested in keeping them?” Their responses were recorded as a
preliminary indication of the likelihood that the hearing
aids would be retained prior to revealing the group to which
the participant had been assigned. Reasons offered in sup-
port of their responses were also noted on the response
form by Audiologist A4.
Next, Audiologist A4 revealed the group to which
each had been assigned. For the CD participants, regard-
less of their preliminary decision about keeping the hearing
aids, each was offered another 4-to-5-week trial period
with the AB service-delivery, including individual matching
of gain and maximum output to the participant’s hearing
loss and subsequent verification, as well as a hearing-aid
orientation session from an audiologist. P participants,
given 0-dB insertion gain, were also offered another 4-to-
5-week trial period for trial use of hearing aids matched to
NAL-NL2 targets and maximum power outputs adjusted
as needed. Because no adjustment of the hearing aids’ pro-
gramming took place between Sessions 2 and 3, the AB
participants were also offered another 4-to-5-week trial
following program adjustment to meet any complaints.
Four of 53 AB participants, 49 of the 51 CD participants,
and 47 of the 50 P participants who completed Session 3
opted for an additional 4-to-5-week trial at that time.
The procedures described for AB participants in
Session 2 were followed for those in the CD and P groups
participating in the additional 4-to-5-week trial, with the
exception that those in the P group did not receive a sec-
ond hearing-aid orientation session. After 4-to-5 weeks
(M = 36.2 days, SD = 12.9 days), the procedures described
previously for Session 3 were replicated. This is referred to
here as Session 3B.
Those participants who completed Session 3 or Ses-
sion 3B and did not wish to purchase the hearing aids at the
conclusion of that session received a full refund of the purchase
price and were exited from the study. Those who retained their
hearing aids following Session 3 or Session 3B were scheduled
for an annual follow-up and exited from the clinical trial.
Results
Examining Potential Participant-Selection Biases
As noted in Figure 1, of the 323 individuals who were
screened and completed Session 1, 188 of these individuals
met the clinical trial’s eligibility criteria. Of these 188, 164
enrolled in the trial and 24 did not. It is appropriate to exam-
ine the characteristics of the participants (N = 164) and non-
participants (N = 24) to see if the study sample may have
been biased through this self-selection process.
Table 3 presents demographic and audiological data
from the participants and nonparticipants. Independent-
samples t tests were conducted for speech-recognition thresh-
olds in the left and right ears, word-recognition scores in the
left and right ears, LDLs at 500 Hz and 3000 Hz in the left
and right ears, bilateral pure-tone averages (PTA; 500, 1000,
and 2000 Hz), bilateral high-frequency pure-tone averages
(HFPTA; 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz), unaided CST scores,
MMSE-2 SV scores, duration of hearing loss in years, and
age. Nonparametric Mann–Whitney U and median tests
were also conducted to examine differences in highest edu-
cation level and annual household income, each of which
was a closed-set ordinal measure in this study. Finally, a chi-
square test was used to examine differences in gender between
the participant and nonparticipant groups. No adjustments
were made in the significance levels for multiple dependent
variables. Of all the measures in Table 3, the participants
differed significantly (p < .05) from the nonparticipants for
only two measures: age and speech-recognition threshold in
the left ear. On average, the nonparticipants were 3 years
younger and had 5 dB lower speech-recognition thresholds
than the participants. We conclude that the unwillingness
of the nonparticipants to take part in the trial did not appre-
ciably bias the study sample.
Also noted in Figure 1, of the 164 who enrolled in the
clinical trial, one withdrew before returning for Session 2

 and nine withdrew after completing Session 2 but prior to
Session 3. Five of these nine had been assigned to group P
and four to group CD. Reasons offered for withdrawal
are noted in Figure 1. By completing Session 2, the nine who
subsequently withdrew from the trial had all of the measures
shown for the participants in Table 3, plus some additional
baseline measures to be used for the outcome measures. In
particular, measures of unaided PHAPglobal, PHAPavds,
and HHIE were available for these nine participants. The
same statistical analyses described previously for the analyses
of participants and nonparticipants (independent-sample
t tests, Mann–Whitney U and median tests, chi-square test)
were conducted to compare the performance of the 154 par-
ticipants who completed the trial to that of the nine partici-
pants who withdrew after completion of Session 2 for each
of the demographic, audiological, and baseline outcome
measures. Again, no corrections to the significance level were
made for multiple dependent measures. No significant differ-
ences were observed, p > .05, between the performance of the
154 participants who completed Session 3 and those nine who
withdrew after Session 2. We conclude that the withdrawal
of these nine participants did not bias the study sample.
Comparing the Two Placebo Subgroups
As noted previously, because we were uncertain how
best to implement the placebo devices—with or without
directional microphones—we included directional micro-
phones in the first 18 placebo participants. After the next
18 (all of whom had omnidirectional microphones), a com-
parison was made between the two groups with regard to
unaided baseline and aided measures for the primary and
secondary outcome measures. No significant differences
were observed for the PHAP subscales between these two
versions of the placebo treatment, but there were marginally
significant differences in aided CST scores with the direc-
tional microphone yielding superior performance. Given
the configuration of the loudspeakers in the sound field for
the target (0-degree azimuth) and competing (180-degree
azimuth) stimuli for the CST, this observation was not
entirely surprising. Nonetheless, because it was thought that
the placebo treatment should not show improvements over
unaided performance, especially for objectively measured
speech recognition, the remainder of the P participants had
hearing aids programmed with omnidirectional microphone
function. In the end, there were 20 P participants who had
hearing aids with directional microphones, two of whom
withdrew between Sessions 2 and 3, and 35 P participants
who had hearing aids with omnidirectional microphones,
three of whom withdrew prior to study completion. The
remaining 18 P participants wearing hearing aids with direc-
tional microphones were all in the typical purchase-price
subgroup, and 8 of the 32 P participants wearing hearing
aids equipped with omnidirectional microphones were in this
same purchase-price subgroup (24 in the reduced purchase-
price subgroup).
Table 4 compares the two P subgroups—those using
hearing aids with directional microphones (Pd) and those
using hearing aids with omnidirectional microphones (Po)
—for several demographic, audiological, and outcome mea-
sures. As can be seen, there were no significant differences
between these two P subgroups in terms of age, gender,
level of education, annual household income, duration of
hearing loss, or MMSE-2 SV, p > .05. There were also no
significant differences in the average amount of hearing
loss (PTA, HFPTA) or any of the unaided baselines for
the outcome measures (PHAPglobal, PHAPavds, CST,
HHIE), p > .05. Finally, of the primary (PHABglobal,
PHABavds), secondary (CST benefit), and tertiary (HHIE
benefit, HASS, and usage) outcome measures, the two P
subgroups only differed significantly for the measure of
CST benefit, p < .05, with the Pd subgroup demonstrating
superior benefit. As noted in Table 4, all CST percent-
correct scores were transformed into rationalized arcsine
units (RAU; Studebaker, 1985) to stabilize the error vari-
ance prior to analyses. The superior performance of the
Pd subgroup on the CST benefit measure results from a
combination of this subgroup having worse unaided CST
scores (45 RAU vs. 55 RAU for the Po subgroup), although
not a statistically significant difference, p > .05, and better

although again not a statistically significant difference, p > .05.
The difference between aided and unaided CST scores, or
CST benefit, shown in Table 4, does differ significantly
between the two placebo subgroups, as noted above.

 Based on these analyses of the two P subgroups,
the data for the Pd and Po subgroups will be pooled hence-
forth to represent the P group for all outcome measures.
Specifically, for the examination of the factorial combina-
tion of the effects of service-delivery group (AB, CD, P)
and purchase price (typical, reduced) on outcomes includ-
ing CST benefit, the data from the Pd and Po subgroups
are pooled to represent the entire P group. For CST benefit,
this pooling of Pd and Po data increased the mean benefit
by about 6 RAU regarding the benefit measured for the Po
subgroup (8.7 RAU for combined P group vs. 2.8 RAU for
Po alone).
Hearing Loss
In the initial analyses of the results of this study, a
series of general linear model (GLM) analyses were performed
with between-subjects factors of service-delivery model
(AB, CD, P) and price group (typical, reduced). We began
first with evaluation of hearing loss, both PTA and HFPTA,
using this 3 × 2 factorial analysis. There were no significant
main effects of service-delivery group, both F(2, 148) values <
1.03, p > .05, or price group, both F(1, 148) values < 0.39,
p > .05, and no significant interaction between these two fac-
tors for either PTA or HFPTA, both F(2, 148) values < 2.59,
p > .05. Figure 5 shows the median air-conduction pure-
tone thresholds for left (top) and right (bottom) ears of the
AB, CD, and P groups. Because there were no main effects
of price group or any interactions with this factor, the
medians are for the pooled service-delivery groups. Clearly,
there was little difference in pure-tone thresholds between
ears and between groups.

 Outcome Measures
Figure 6 shows the means and standard errors for the
six subgroups evaluated in the 3 × 2 factorial analysis for the
primary outcome measure in this clinical trial, PHABglobal.
Figure 6 provides data for the unaided PHAPglobal (black
bars), the aided PHAPglobal (red bars), and the difference
between these two measures, the PHABglobal (green bars).
Factorial (3 × 2) GLM analyses revealed that there were
no significant main effects of price group, F(1, 148) values
all < 0.82, p > .05, and no significant interactions with
price group, F(2, 148) values all < 0.42, p > .05. The effect
of service-delivery group was not significant for unaided
PHAPglobal scores, F(2, 148) = 1.53, p > .05, but there
were significant effects of service-delivery group on aided
PHAPglobal, F(2, 148) = 27.37, p < .05, and PHABglobal,
F(2, 148) = 18.56, p < .05. Post hoc Bonferroni-adjusted
t tests revealed that group AB had significantly better (lower)
aided PHAPglobal scores than both the CD and P groups,
p < .05, and the CD group had significantly better aided
PHAPglobal scores than the P group. With regard to the
PHABglobal scores, the scores for the AB and CD groups
were better than those of the P group, but the AB and CD
groups did not differ significantly from one another, p > .05.
In general, self-reported benefit for speech communication
with amplification is improved for both AB and CD groups
relative to the P group.
Figure 7 shows the means and standard errors for
the unaided PHAPavds, aided PHAPavds, and PHABavds
measures for each of the six participant subgroups. Factorial
(3 × 2) GLM analyses of each of the three measures showed
no significant effect of service-delivery group, all F(2, 148)
values < 2.44, p > .05; no significant effect of price group,
all F(1, 148) values < 0.85, p > .05; and no Service-Delivery
Group × Price Group interaction for any of these three
measures, all F(2, 148) values < 0.79, p > .05. Further, these
analyses indicated that the PHABavds values (green bars)—
pooled across all participants given the absence of any sig-
nificant effects of service-delivery group, price group, and
interaction—did not differ significantly from 0, F(1, 148) =
3.20, p > .05. The aversiveness and distortion of sound
changes little from unaided to aided conditions, resulting
in near-zero values for PHABavds.
Figure 8 depicts the means and standard errors for
the secondary outcome measure in this clinical trial, the
CST. All values in figures and used in GLM analyses made
use of RAU-transformed CST scores. As in Figures 6 and
7, unaided (black), aided (red), and relative benefit (green)
measures are provided. Factorial (3 × 2) GLM analyses
revealed no significant interaction between the factors of
service-delivery group and price group for any of the three
measures shown in Figure 8, all F(2, 148) values < 2.19,
p > .05. There was no effect of service-delivery group on
unaided CST scores, but there was a significant effect on
aided CST scores, F(2, 148) = 13.58, p < .05, and on CST
benefit, F(2, 148) = 11.78, p < .05. Post hoc Bonferroni-
adjusted t tests revealed that this significant effect was due
to the P group performing significantly worse than both
the AB and CD groups for the aided CST and CST benefit
measures, p < .05. With regard to price group, there was a
significant effect on unaided CST scores, F(1, 148) = 4.69,

(green bars). Data are for N = 154, with 53 audiology best practices

 p < .05, and on CST benefit, F(1,148) = 4.79, p < .05, but
not aided CST scores, F(1, 148) = 0.26, p > .05. Examina-
tion of Figure 8 shows that the reduced purchase-price
subgroups (labeled on X axis as “red”) tend to have higher
unaided CST scores and less CST benefit than their typical
purchase-price counterparts (labeled as on X axis as “typ”).
The impact of purchase price on CST benefit, the secondary
outcome measure in this clinical trial, is clearly artefactual.
There is no rational explanation for hearing-aid purchase
price to impact unaided CST scores obtained prior to en-
rollment in the trial and subsequent purchase of the hear-
ing aids. Given no differences in aided CST scores between
these two purchase-price groups but significantly higher
unaided scores for the reduced-price group, CST benefit—
the difference between aided and unaided CST scores—is
artificially lower in the reduced-price group. When the
relative benefit measure, CST benefit, is confounded by
seemingly arbitrary price-group differences in unaided CST
scores, the measure of aided performance alone, aided CST,
might be considered a more appropriate measure of the
impact of amplification on speech understanding. Recall
that there was no significant effect of purchase price on
aided CST scores.
Figure 9 shows the means and standard errors for
unaided HHIE, aided HHIE, and HHIE benefit. There
were no significant effects of price group, all F(1, 148)
values < 1.90, p > .05, and no significant interactions
between price group and service-delivery group, all F(2, 148)
values < 1.63, p > .05. There was a significant effect of
service-delivery group on aided HHIE, F(2, 148) = 13.90,
p < .05, and on HHIE benefit, F(2, 148) = 12.09, p < .05,
but not on unaided HHIE scores, F(2, 148) = 0.24, p > .05.
Post hoc Bonferroni-adjusted t tests revealed that the AB
group had significantly lower (better) aided HHIE scores
than both of the other groups (CD, P), p < .05. No other
post hoc comparisons were significant for aided HHIE.
For HHIE benefit, the P group showed significantly less
benefit than both of the other groups (AB, CD), p < .05,
but the AB and CD groups did not differ significantly in
terms of HHIE benefit.
Figure 10 shows the means and standard errors for
the two measures of satisfaction, HASShaf and HASSdisp,
and for average daily usage derived from the hearing aids’
data-logging. All of these outcome measures are aided
only; no unaided or “benefit” measures are possible. Data-
logging values for the right and left hearing aids were
strongly correlated, r = 0.96, p < .05. As a result, the mean
of these two values was calculated and represents the aver-
age hours of use per day bilaterally. Factorial (3 × 2) GLM
analyses on each of these three outcome measures revealed
no significant main effect of price group, all F(1, 148)
values < 0.72, p > .05, and no significant interactions,
all F(2, 148) values < 0.58, p < .05, on any of the three
outcome measures. However, a significant effect of service-
delivery group was observed for both satisfaction mea-
sures, both F(2, 148) values > 6.92, p < .05, but not for
daily usage, F(2, 148) = 1.33, p > .05. Post hoc Bonferroni-
adjusted t tests revealed that the AB group had signifi-
cantly higher HASShaf scores than both of the other groups
(CD, P), p < .05, and that the CD group had signifi-
cantly lower HASSdisp scores than the other two groups
(AB, P).

 Summary of GLM Analyses of Outcome Measures
Table 5 presents the group means and standard devi-
ations for unaided baseline measures and aided outcome
measures for each of the service-delivery groups: AB, CD,
and P. No significant differences were observed for the
unaided baselines, but five of the seven outcome measures
show significant group effects. Only PHABavds and daily
usage do not show significant differences across groups.
Table 6 presents a summary of the results from the
GLM analyses for each outcome measure presented above.
Here, the specific post hoc group differences underlying
the significant effects of service-delivery group in the GLM
analyses is noted. As can be seen, for the primary outcome
measure (PHABglobal), the secondary outcome measure
(CST benefit), and HHIE benefit, the pattern of results is very
similar: no significant effects of purchase price, no significant
interaction between purchase price and service-delivery
model, and a significant main effect of service-delivery model
with both AB and CD being significantly superior to P. The
key exception to this general summary is that the effect of
purchase price was significant for CST benefit, but as noted
above, this appears to be artefactual to some extent due
to significant effects of purchase price on unaided CST
performance.
As summarized in Table 6, there were no significant
main effects of service-delivery model or purchase price
on PHABavds and no significant interaction between these
two factors for this outcome measure. In fact, as noted
above, the PHABavds scores overall did not differ signifi-
cantly from zero, indicating that, overall, there were no
effects of amplification on this outcome measure regardless
of service-delivery or purchase-price group.
The remaining three outcome measures in Table 6 are
aided-only measures: satisfaction (HASShaf, HASSdisp)
or daily usage. There are no significant differences in usage
attributable to service delivery or purchase price. For the
Figure 10. Means for the Hearing Aid Satisfaction Survey (HASS)
satisfaction (left ordinate) and usage (right ordinate) outcome measures
for each of the six subgroups evaluated in the 3 × 2 factorial analysis.
Measures of satisfaction with hearing features and function, HASShaf
(light gray bars); satisfaction with dispenser-related issues, HASSdisp
(black bars); and daily hearing-aid usage from the datalogger (gray
bars) are provided. Data are for N = 154, with 53 audiology best
practices (AB), 51 consumer decides/over-the-counter (CD), and
50 placebo device (P) participants included. Purchase-price
subgroups are “red” (reduced; $600) and “typ” (typical, $3,600).

 two HASS measures, the CD group had significantly lower
satisfaction ratings than the AB group for the hearing aids’
features and function (HASShaf) as well as for the dispenser-
related items (HASSdisp). The P group also reported sig-
nificantly lower satisfaction scores than the AB group for
the hearing aids’ features and function, but not with regard
to the dispenser.
Effect Sizes
The availability of data from the P group enabled
the calculation of effect sizes for the two service-delivery
models, AB and CD. Table 7 displays Cohen’s d values for
each service-delivery group relative to the P group and for
each outcome measure included in this clinical trial. Cohen
(1988) cautiously offered labels of “small,” “medium,” and
“large” for d values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8, respectively. Using
these labels as a loose guide, medium-to-large effect sizes were
observed for both AB and CD service-delivery approaches
for the primary outcome measure (PHABglobal), the second-
ary outcome measure (CST benefit), and HHIE benefit. This
attests to the efficacy of both approaches to hearing-aid
provision examined in this trial. On the other hand, the CD
service-delivery model yielded considerably smaller effect
sizes than the AB model for measures of satisfaction with
the hearing aids’ function and features and the daily usage
of the devices. This was also true for satisfaction with
dispenser-related performance (HASSdisp), but, by design,
the CD group did not have interactions with a professional
audiologist (minimal interactions with any member of the
research team) and would be expected to be less satisfied
with that aspect of the delivery process. Finally, as expected,
the effect size for PHABavds was essentially zero and reflects
the lack of benefit provided by hearing aids for aversive
and distorted sounds regardless of the service-delivery
model.
Other Findings From the 6-week Clinical Trial
At the end of the trial and prior to divulging the
service-delivery approach or placebo status of the hearing
aids, each participant who completed the trial (N = 154)
was asked to indicate, based on their experience over the
6-week trial, whether they were likely to keep the hearing
aids or return them for a refund. For the AB group, 81%
indicated that they would keep the hearing aids, whereas

 only 55% of the CD group and 36% of the P group planned
to keep them (the balance of the participants in each group
were either not planning to keep the devices or were un-
decided). Chi-square testing revealed the AB percentage to
be significantly greater than both CD, χ2 (2) = 8.3, p < .05,
and P, χ2 (2) = 21.7, p < .05, percentages, but the differ-
ence between the CD and P groups was not significant,
χ2 (2) = 3.8, p > .05. Of those who were not planning to keep
their hearing aids or were undecided at that time, the most
frequently cited reason for their response was the lack of
benefit provided (1.9% of AB group, 17.6% of CD group,
38% of P group).
As noted, during Session 3, a slightly modified version
of the PHAST-R was completed by all participants. This
allowed for a formal assessment of their skills, such as insert-
ing and removing the hearing aids, removing and inserting
the battery, cleaning and maintaining the devices, and so
on. Points were assigned for each skill by an audiologist (A4)
blinded to study group. Points were totaled and divided by
the maximum points possible, which could vary slightly from
person to person, to yield a proportion of the maximum
possible on the PHAST-R. The means (standard deviations)
were 0.90 (0.09), 0.84 (0.09), and 0.89 (0.07) for the AB, CD,
and P groups, respectively. Analysis of variance revealed a
significant effect of service-delivery group on PHAST-R pro-
portions, F(2, 151) = 8.39, p < .05, and follow-up Bonferroni-
adjusted t tests showed that the CD group had significantly
lower PHAST-R proportions than the other two groups,
p < .05, with no other significant paired comparisons
emerging. Given the lack of hearing-aid orientation dur-
ing Session 2 for the CD participants, the poorer per-
formance of the CD group on the PHAST-R is not
unexpected.
When participants returned for Session 3, the blinded
audiologist (A1 or A2) first inspected the hearing aids for
proper insertion, examined the tubing and the domes, and
removed the hearing aid battery and measured its voltage.
The number of times a problem occurred was noted for each
hearing aid during these Session 3 inspections. Tallies were
compiled for the number of inspection problems and then
compared across groups. Hearing-aid insertion problems
were noted about 36% of the time on one or both sides, but
there were no differences among the three groups in the
frequency of these problems, χ2(4) = 4.63, p > .05. Tubing
problems, especially twisted or kinked tubing, were the
most commonly observed problem, occurring on one or both
ears 88% of the time, but there were no differences among
groups regarding the frequency of observed tubing prob-
lems, χ2(8) = 6.63, p > .05. Weak or dead batteries, on
the other hand, were the least frequent problem, occurring
17.5% of the time, with no significant differences among
groups in the frequency of these problems, χ2(4) = 1.47,
p > .05.
Given the high prevalence of various hearing-aid prob-
lems, we sought to determine the functional significance of
these issues. We had obtained as-worn acoustical measures
of each hearing aid in the Verifit test box at the beginning
of Session 3 and also had subsequent postmaintenance
measures of the same type for each hearing aid. For these
acoustical measurements, several gain and output measures
were available. Here, we opted to use the aided Speech
Intelligibility Index (SII; ANSI, 2012) from the Verifit
device as a global single-valued estimator of the acoustical
quality of fit. In general, over a fairly wide range of SII values,
speech-understanding performance is monotonically related
to the SII. Values from each ear were available for input
levels of 55, 65, and 75 dB SPL and, based on the strong
significant correlations among the SII values for different
levels within the same ear, r > 0.70, p < .01, we opted for
the SII values at 65 dB SPL for each hearing aid as our global
indicator of acoustical function. In addition, CST scores
were obtained in Session 3 for both the initial as-worn con-
dition of the hearing aids and also after maintenance and
adjustment of the hearing aids by the audiologist. These
RAU-transformed scores served as a single-valued metric
for functional consequences of these hearing aid mainte-
nance issues. Table 8 shows the means and standard devia-
tions for these acoustical and functional measures as-worn
and postmaintenance for each group. For each of the SII
values—one for each hearing aid—and for the sound-field
(binaural) CST scores, mixed-model 3 × 2 factorial GLM
analyses were performed to examine the between-subjects
effects of service-delivery group (AB, CD, P) and repeated-
measures effect of hearing-aid maintenance (as-worn, post-
maintenance). As expected, for each of the three GLM
analyses, a significant effect of group was observed with
post hoc testing revealing that the P group had significantly
lower SII values and aided CST scores, p < .05, than each
of the other groups (AB, CD), all F(2, 151) values > 7.22,
p < .05. The AB and CD groups did not differ significantly
from one another, p > .05, nor was the interaction between
group and hearing-aid maintenance significant in any of
the three GLM analyses, F(2, 151) values < 1.42, p > .05. In
all three GLM analyses, SII values and CST scores obtained
postmaintenance were significantly greater than those mea-
sured as-worn, F(1, 151) values > 18.6, p < .05. Thus, the
hearing-aid maintenance problems observed at the end
of the 6-week trial were not inconsequential; rather, they
resulted in significantly decreased amplification of speech
(SII) and significantly poorer aided speech-understanding
performance (CST).
We thought that the CD group, lacking exposure to
hearing-aid orientation with an audiologist, might show a
greater dependence on use of the user guide or find it to be
more helpful than the other two groups who had received
such instruction (AB, P). Approximately 90% of the partic-
ipants in each group (86.7%–94.1%) indicated that they
read the user guide that was sent home with the hearing
aids. There was no significant difference in the proportion
of each group who did so, χ2(4) = 3.87, p > .05. Further,
when those who read it were asked to rate the helpfulness
of the user guide on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 = most help-
ful, the mean (standard deviation) ratings were 7.6 (2.1),
7.0 (2.1), and 7.0 (2.3) for the AB, CD and P groups,
respectively. There were no significant differences in these
user guide ratings among groups, F(2, 136) = 0.90, p > .05.

 Overall, all groups tended to use the guides and considered
the user guides to be helpful, similarly so across groups.
Outcomes from the Follow-Up Trial (Session 3B)
Recall that at the conclusion of the 6-week clinical
trial, all 154 participants in Session 3 were informed of
their group assignment and offered the opportunity to con-
tinue for another 4-week trial period after adjustments to
their hearing aids. For the 53 AB participants, five had
decided to return their hearing aids at the end of the 6-week
trial, four requested adjustments and another 4-week trial
period, and the rest purchased their hearing aids. Given
the small number of AB participants continuing for another
4-week trial period, these individuals were omitted from
any comparisons among outcome measures across Sessions 3
and 3B. For the 51 CD participants, one kept the hearing
aids selected for the trial and one returned the hearing aids in
Session 3, with the remaining 49 CD participants requesting
the additional 4-week trial period before making a final deci-
sion. For the P participants, three returned their hearing
aids at the conclusion of Session 3 and 47 requested the
additional 4-week trial period.
One CD participant and one P participant withdrew
from the extended trial period prior to completing the mea-
sures in Session 3B, but both opted to purchase their devices
after adjustment. All 94 remaining participants (48 CD, 46 P)
received the AB service-delivery model, including real-ear
measurements to verify NAL-NL2 targets and individual
adjustment of maximum power output. Only the CD par-
ticipants also received a hearing-aid orientation at this time
because the P participants received hearing-aid orientation
during the original 6-week trial period.
Figure 11 provides the aided output (unfilled circles)
for a 65-dB SPL speech input for each hearing aid when
reprogrammed for the original CD and P participants
after matching NAL-NL2 targets at the end of Session 3.
Target output values (filled circles) are also shown in each
panel.
Figure 12 shows the mean (+1 standard error)
PHABglobal and PHABavds scores obtained from the CD
group (left panel) and the P group (right panel) at Session 3
(black bars) and after the additional 4-week trial in Ses-
sion 3B (gray bars). Asterisks (*) mark significant (p < .05)
paired-sample t tests in each panel. The PHABglobal scores
improved significantly for both the CD and P participants
after AB service delivery and the extra 4-week trial period.
No significant differences were observed for the PHABavds
scores. The left-pointing arrows show the mean values for
the original AB group from Session 3 for the lefthand out-
come measure in each panel, and the right-pointing arrows
show the corresponding Session 3 AB values for the right-
hand outcome measure in each panel. As can be seen, the
mean values for the PHABglobal and PHABavds outcome
measures obtained in Session 3B from the original CD and
P participants following an additional 4-week AB-based
trial (gray bars) are very similar to those obtained from the
original AB participants (arrows).
Figure 13 provides the mean (+1 standard error) CST
benefit and HHIE benefit measures for the participants
assigned to the CD and P groups for the initial trial period.
Whereas the CD group shows no significant improvement
from Session 3 to Session 3B for either CST or HHIE benefit,
the P group shows significant improvements on both out-
come measures. The mean values for CST and HHIE benefit
obtained in Session 3B from the original CD and P partici-
pants following an additional 4-week AB-based trial (gray
bars) are very similar to those obtained from the original
AB participants (arrows).
Figure 14 provides a similar comparison of the mean
(+1 standard error) outcomes from Session 3 to Session 3B
for the CD and P participants for the two measures of
hearing-aid satisfaction, HASShaf and HASSdisp. For
both the CD and P groups, the AB service-delivery model
and 4-week trial led to significantly higher satisfaction ratings
both about the features and function of the hearing aids
(HASShaf) and the dispenser-related items (HASSdisp). The
mean values for both HASS outcome measures obtained in
Session 3B from the original CD and P participants follow-
ing an additional 4-week AB-based trial (gray bars) are
very similar to those obtained from the original AB partici-
pants (arrows).
Figure 15 shows the mean (+1 standard error) for the
hearing-aid usage outcome measure derived from data-logger
readings obtained from each group and from Session 3 and
Session 3B. The usage measures show no significant change
from Session 3 to Session 3B for either group and average
about 6 hours per day across groups and sessions. The mean
values for hours of daily usage from the original CD and P
participants are similar to the means of the original AB par-
ticipants (arrows), although averaging about 1 hour less per
day than the original AB group.

 Also shown in Figure 15 are the mean (+1 standard
error) PHAST-R scores obtained from each group at both
Session 3 and Session 3B. For both groups, the PHAST-R
scores increased significantly from Session 3 to Session 3B.
Once again, the mean values for the PHAST-R obtained in
Session 3B from the original CD and P participants follow-
ing an additional 4-week AB-based trial (gray bars) are
very similar to those obtained from the original AB partici-
pants (arrows).
Finally, as was noted, all but a few of the original CD
and P group members opted to receive the AB service-
delivery and an additional 4-week trial. Recall that at the
end of the clinical trial, Session 3, and prior to divulging
group membership, each participant indicated whether they
planned to keep the hearing aids after the trial. At the end
of the extra 4-week trial with AB service delivery, Session 3B,
each participant decided whether to purchase the hearing
aids. Figure 16 shows the percentage of those who purchased
their hearing aids after Session 3B when the participants in
each group are segregated by their original plans to keep
the hearing aids after the initial trial. One-hundred percent
(17 of 17) of group P and 96% (25 of 26) of group CD who
planned to keep their hearing aids after the initial 6-week
trial actually kept them at the conclusion of the study. Of
those who were undecided after the initial 6-week trial, 100%
(14 of 14) of the P participants and 83% (10 of 12) of the
CD participants ultimately kept their hearing aids after the
additional 4-week trial. Of course, it is unknown how many
in the undecided group would have ultimately kept their
hearing aids if the study ended at Session 3 and they were
forced to make a final decision at that point in time. For
those who indicated in Session 3, after the initial 6-week
trial, that they did not intend to keep their hearing aids,
80% (12 of 15) of the P group and 60% (6 of 10) of the CD
group ultimately kept their hearing aids after reprogramming
and an additional 4-week trial.
At study conclusion, 134 of 154 participants (87%)
kept their hearing aids, with small nonsignificant variations
in the percentage across initial group assignment (88.7% or
AB, 84.3% for CD, and 88% for P), χ2 (2) = 0.50, p > .05.
Figure 11. Comparison of real-ear output to NAL-NL2 targets after hearing aids for consumer decides/over-the-counter (CD; left) and
placebo device (P; right) participants were reprogrammed to match targets following audiology best practices (AB) procedures in Session 3.
Mean and ±1 standard deviation are shown in each panel. Top panels show data for the left ear and bottom panels for the right ear. The
stimulus was a 65-dB SPL speech signal (“carrot passage”) for the speech-mapping measures from the Verifit test system.

 For the majority of CD and P participants, however, these
retention rates are after completion of the additional 4-week
AB service-delivery trial. That is, as noted previously, based
on their stated intentions to keep their hearing aids after the
initial 6-week trial, the percentage of “yes” responses were
81% (AB), 55% (CD), and 36% (P). Because “undecided”
was a permitted response to this Session 3 query, it is impos-
sible to indicate exactly how many of these respondents
would have answered “yes” or “no” if forced to choose.
Although initial assignment to service-delivery group
had no impact on the percentage of participants who returned
their hearing aids, purchase price did impact returns for
credit. Whereas roughly half of those who kept their hearing
aids paid the typical purchase price (60 of 134 or 44.8%),
85% (17 of 20) who returned their hearing aids had paid the
higher typical purchase price. This effect of purchase-price
on the number of returns for credit was significant, χ2 (1) =
11.26, p < .05.
Discussion
This first-ever placebo-controlled double-blind ran-
domized clinical trial of hearing aids in older adults with
impaired hearing demonstrated the efficacy of the audiology
best-practices approach (AB) to hearing aid provision. The

 outcomes obtained for the participants assigned to the AB
treatment were significantly better than those obtained from
the participants assigned to the placebo group (P). This was
true for the primary outcome measure, PHABglobal; the
secondary outcome measure, CST benefit; and other ter-
tiary outcome measures as well (HHIE benefit, HASShaf).
Medium or large effect sizes were observed for most of the
outcome measures included in this clinical trial. The use
of audiology best practices, including the individual evalu-
ation and adjustment of the maximum power output of the
hearing aids based on the listener’s uncomfortable loudness
judgments, did not yield better perception of aversive or
distorted sounds (PHABavds) compared to the placebo
group. Further, daily usage was not impacted by service-
delivery approach.
The outcomes obtained by the participants in the
AB group were generally positive, as well as being signifi-
cantly different from the P group. For example, aided
speech-recognition performance for sentences in a noise
background (CST) was, on average, 21 RAU better than
unaided performance. In addition, perceived benefit improved
17–18 percentage points for the speech-communication
scales of the PHAB (PHABglobal) and a measure of per-
ceived hearing handicap (HHIE). Moreover, the average
satisfaction ratings for the features and functions of the
hearing aids (HASShaf) for the AB group corresponded
to a scale value of “satisfied.” Finally, the AB participants
wore their hearing aids for 7 hours per day. Again, all of
these results are quite positive outcomes and serve to estab-
lish that hearing aids do provide benefits to older adults
with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss.
Recall that the CD service-delivery model differed
from the AB in two key areas: (a) the AB model made use
of real-ear measures to fine-tune the hearing aids to match
prescribed NAL-NL2 targets on an individual basis and
(b) the AB model included a 45–60 min hearing-aid orienta-
tion session. Despite the absence of these two processes
from the CD model, this clinical trial also established the
efficacy of this simulated OTC service-delivery model. Specif-
ically, the CD group performed significantly better than the
P group on the primary outcome measure, PHABglobal;
the secondary outcome measure, CST benefit; and on one
of the additional outcome measures, HHIE benefit. The
CD group, however, demonstrated significantly lower hear-
ing-aid satisfaction scores than the AB group (HASShaf)
or both the AB and P groups (HASSdisp). The latter is not
surprising, however, given that both the AB and P groups
interacted with a professional audiologist during the deliv-
ery of the hearing aids, whereas the participants in the
CD group had virtually no contact or interaction with a
professional during the hearing-aid delivery process. Many
of the HASSdisp items pertain to how well the dispenser
explained the care and maintenance of the hearing aids,
as well as strategies for their use and limitations to their
benefits—items covered formally in the hearing-aid orien-
tation by the audiologist for both AB and P participants.
As with the AB participants, the CD group did not differ
from the other two groups on the measures of perceived
aversiveness/distortion of sound (PHABavds) and daily
hours of usage.
Aside from the inferior satisfaction ratings from
the CD group compared to the AB group noted above,
a significantly smaller percentage of CD participants than
Figure 15. Mean usage outcome (left ordinate) and Practical Hearing
Aid Skills Test–Revised (PHAST-R) scores (right ordinate) obtained
from the consumer decides over-the-counter (CD) group (left panel)
and the placebo device (P) group (right panel) during Sessions 3
(black bars) and Session 3B (gray bars). Note that the PHAST-R
proportions have a maximum of 1.0 but are multiplied by 10 for
appropriate scaling in this figure. The left-pointing arrows show the
mean values for the original audiology best practices (AB) group from
Session 3 for the lefthand outcome measure in each panel and
the right-pointing arrows show the corresponding Session 3 AB
values for the righthand outcome measure in each panel. Error bar =

participants’ plans to keep the hearing aids when asked at the
conclusion of the initial 6-week trial and prior to revealing their group.

 AB participants indicated that they planned to keep their
hearing aids at the conclusion of the trial. Moreover, the
outcomes obtained from the CD participants after the
extra 4-week AB-based trial were significantly higher for
the PHABglobal and HASS outcome measures than the
results obtained at the conclusion of the trial. Also, 6 of the
10 CD participants who indicated that they were not plan-
ning to keep their hearing aids at the conclusion of the
original 6-week trial decided otherwise at the conclusion
of the extra 4-week AB-based trial. All told, although both
the AB and CD service-delivery approaches were found
to be efficacious and to yield generally positive outcomes,
these additional metrics may give a slight edge to the AB
approach over the CD approach.
The OTC service-delivery approach, one possible
version simulated here via the CD model, has been advo-
cated for many years as a way to potentially increase the
accessibility and affordability of hearing aids (Donahue
et al., 2010; NASEM, 2016; PCAST, 2015; Zimmerman,
2004). It was, in part, for this reason that we also included
factorial combinations of purchase price. Because hearing-
aid purchase price was not directly manipulated as a factor
in a controlled fashion in any prior studies, we opted for
its inclusion as a full factorial factor. That is, as conceived,
OTC hearing aids are associated with lower purchase prices
than conventional hearing aids delivered through AB prac-
tices. During study design, we contemplated delivering the
hearing aids via the AB service-delivery model with a typical
AB purchase price ($3,600) and via the CD service-delivery
model with the anticipated OTC/CD purchase price ($600).
However, if we had observed differences in outcome at the
study’s conclusion, we would have been unable to deter-
mine whether the differences were due to the service-delivery
model, the purchase price, or an interaction between them.
As a result, we included purchase price as a part of the fac-
torial design such that both purchase prices were paired
with each service-delivery approach. Somewhat surprisingly,
except for one significant effect of purchase price considered
to be artefactual in nature (CST benefit), there were no
significant main effects or interactions of purchase price on
the seven outcome measures examined. Perhaps the ratio
of purchase prices (6:1) was too small to influence the mea-
sured outcomes. Given the annual household income of the
majority of trial participants, maybe both dollar amounts
used here were too low to influence outcomes. The observa-
tion that 85% of those who decided not to keep their hear-
ing aids were in the typical $3,600 purchase-price group,
however, suggests that purchase price did influence their
ultimate decision regarding retention of their hearing aids.
We examined other variables to see if those retaining
their hearing aids (n = 134) differed significantly from those
opting to return them (n = 20). Demographic (age, gender,
annual income, highest education level, duration of hearing
loss), audiological (PTA, HFPTA, LDLs), unaided baselines
for outcome measures (PHAPglobal unaided, PHAPavds
unaided, HHIE unaided, CST unaided), and MMSE-2 SV
cognitive-screen scores were examined. Only hearing loss
(both PTA and HFPTA) and age differed significantly
between the two groups. Those who returned the hearing
aids had less hearing loss and were younger than those
who kept them, all t(152) values > 2.6, p < .05. Specifically,
mean PTAs (dB HL), HFPTAs (dB HL), and age (years)
were 28.9, 39.6, and 69.6, respectively, for the 134 partici-
pants who kept their hearing aids and 21.9, 33.0, and 66.0,
respectively, for the 20 participants who returned their
hearing aids.
We have also examined in more detail the choices made
by the CD participants with regard to the hearing-aid
frequency-gain characteristics selected for themselves. Exami-
nation of the choice of frequency responses based on the
NAL-NL2 targets for audiograms X, Y, or Z (Figure 4)
revealed that 65% and 59% of the time hearing aids pro-
grammed for audiogram X were selected by CD participants
for their right and left ears, respectively. Similarly, hearing
aids programmed for the Y audiogram were selected 22%
and 28% of the time for the right and left ears, respectively,
with the balance (13%) selecting hearing aids that were
matched to audiogram Z for both ears. Assuming that the
NAL-NL2 targets are valid estimates of desired frequency-
gain characteristics, and given that NAL-NL2 only requires
hearing thresholds to generate targets, then we would expect
“good choices” by the CD participants to be reflected in
good matches of their audiograms to the X, Y, or Z audio-
grams (Figure 4) used to program the hearing aids they
selected. Figure 17 shows the median audiograms of the
CD participants (unfilled symbols) when they were parti-
tioned into subgroups based on the hearing aid selected
(X, Y or Z) during the trial. These data are for the left
ear only, but are nearly identical to those for the right ear
(not shown). The X, Y and Z audiograms from Figure 4

 participants are also shown in Figure 17. The median audio-
gram for the 30 CD participants who selected the X hearing
aid (unfilled circles) is much closer to the audiogram used
to program the Y hearing aids than to that used to program
the X hearing aids. With matches to NAL-NL2 targets as
the criterion for a “good match,” these 30 CD participants
opted for a hearing aid programmed with less gain in the
middle and higher frequencies than prescribed by NAL-NL2.
A similar pattern, although not as great a mismatch, is
apparent for those CD participants who chose hearing aids
programmed on the basis of audiogram Y (n = 14; unfilled
triangles). In this case, however, the median audiogram for
that subgroup falls between the Y and Z audiograms sug-
gesting that either could be a reasonable match. Finally, a
small number (n = 7; unfilled squares) of CD participants
appear to have chosen hearing aids (Z) that likely provided
considerably more gain in the middle and higher frequen-
cies than recommended by NAL-NL2.
Rather than rely on the median audiograms for each
subgroup of CD participants, we calculated the root-mean-
square (rms) error between each participant’s audiogram
and the X, Y, and Z audiograms used to pre-program the
hearing aids. Based on these individual matches, the best-
matching audiogram (smallest rms error) among the X, Y,
and Z alternatives was selected. Table 9 shows the compar-
isons between the hearing aid chosen (X, Y, or Z) and the
audiogram with the closest match to that of the CD partic-
ipant. For 24 of the 30 who selected hearing aid X for the
left ear and 27 of the 33 who chose X for the right ear, a
hearing aid with more gain in the high frequencies, either
Y or Z, would have been a more appropriate selection
based on threshold-based prescription procedures such as
NAL-NL2.
Based on the comparison of median audiograms for
CD subgroups who chose hearing aids X, Y, or Z to the
X, Y, and Z audiograms used to program those hearing
aids (Figure 17) and the examination of best-matching
audiograms on an individual basis (Table 9), there is a clear
tendency for first-time hearing aid users selecting their own
devices to select ones with less high-frequency gain than
prescribed by threshold-based procedures such as the
NAL-NL2 method used in this trial. Of course, the audio-
gram mismatch noted here would likely be greater still for
threshold-based prescriptive procedures that prescribe more
high-frequency gain than NAL-NL2, such as the Desired
Sensation Level (DSL) method (Johnson, 2013). The obser-
vation that the CD participants self-select hearing aids that
are somewhat underpowered may explain some of the infe-
rior outcomes observed in this group compared to the AB
participants. On the other hand, the fact that many of the
outcomes for the AB and CD participants were similar,
including daily usage, suggests that less-expensive OTC
options might be a reasonable alternative for older adults
to enter the hearing aid market, perhaps seeking assistance
from professionals after an initial period of adjustment
with their self-selected options. We demonstrated here that
following a 6-week CD trial with a subsequent 4-week
AB trial significantly improved outcomes and also led to
greater retention of the devices. In this case, the additional
4-week AB-based trial immediately followed the initial
6-week trial, but that may not be necessary to obtain the
same improvements in outcome.
By study conclusion, there were a total of 147 partic-
ipants who had completed the AB service-delivery model
and provided a full set of outcome measures, 53 original
AB participants plus 94 original CD (n = 48) and P (n = 46)
participants who opted for and completed the extra 4-week
AB trial. Several 3 × 2 factorial GLM analyses of the effects
of initial service-delivery group and price group on outcome
measures failed to find significant effects of service-delivery,
all F(2, 140) < 2.23, p > .05; price group, all F(1, 140) < 2.30,
p > .05; or their interaction, all F(2, 140) < 1.53, p > .05,
on post-AB outcomes for these 147 participants. For service-
delivery group, these results are entirely consistent with
the visual impression of the data in Figures 12, 13, 14,
and 15, which compared the outcomes for CD and P par-
ticipants after the 4-week AB treatment (gray bars) to the
original AB participants (arrows). As a result, the post-
AB data from these 147 participants were pooled. Table
10 shows the pooled means, standard errors, and stan-
dard deviations for these 147 post-AB participants. These
could be considered to be normative AB-based values for
these outcome measures for samples of older adults with
mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss and demo-
graphics similar to those of the participants in this study
(see demographics in Table 3).
Typically, clinical trials assume that only one or two
outcome measures, the primary and secondary outcomes, are
to be included. We argued above, based on earlier studies,
that this poses challenges for studies of hearing aids as the
outcomes appear to be multidimensional, often having three
or four primary components (e.g., Humes, 2001, 2003; Humes
& Krull, 2012). The data from the 147 post-AB participants
for the ten outcome measures appearing in Table 10 were
subjected to a principal-components factor analysis (Gorsuch,
1983) to evaluate the redundancy among these measures.
As in prior analyses of this type (e.g., Humes, 2003; Humes
& Krull, 2012), considerable redundancy was observed
Table 9. Comparisons of number of times a particular hearing aid
was chosen (X, Y, Z) versus choice based on best match (lowest
root-mean-square error) of consumer decides/over-the-counter
(CD) participant’s audiogram to audiogram X, Y, or Z (see Figure 17)
used to program the hearing aids via the NAL-NL2 method.

 among this set of ten outcome measures. In particular, a
four-factor solution emerged that accounted for 74.0% of
the total variance (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin [KMO] sampling
statistic = .68; all communalities > .60). The loadings of
each of the ten variables on the four factors, after orthogonal
(varimax) rotation, appear in Table 11. Interpretation of
these four factors is fairly straightforward from the pattern
of loadings in Table 11. The first outcome factor is aided
performance, the second is self-reported benefit, the third
is daily usage, and the fourth is aided speech-recognition
benefit. Recall that each of these is an orthogonal or inde-
pendent aspect of hearing aid outcome. Thus, although it is
not necessary to include all ten outcome measures noted in
this table, it would be equally inappropriate to include only
one or two outcome measures to get a comprehensive picture
of hearing-aid outcome. Of these four aspects or dimensions
of hearing-aid outcome, it could be argued that usage is the
least sensitive measure, in that our results demonstrated that
AB participants did not differ significantly from the P partic-
ipants with regard to usage in this trial. On the other hand,
most would likely consider usage a fundamental aspect of
outcome in that all the other aspects of outcome are trivial
if the hearing aids are not worn.
There are several limitations to this study. These
include the fairly homogeneous study sample: White, highly
educated, with median annual household income greater
than $45,000. Generalizing beyond this sample is not appro-
priate. Further, the CD service-delivery method was imple-
mented as one of many possible OTC approaches to the
delivery of hearing aids to older adults. The positive outcomes
observed here for the CD approach are specific to that
instantiation of an OTC model. Moreover, it is important
to note that all participants in this study received a thorough
audiological examination in Session 1 to determine candi-
dacy for the trial hearing aids. It is conceivable that some
OTC service-delivery models would forego this initial audi-
ological examination. The results from the current trial
cannot be used to validate other OTC models or clinical
protocols that might exclude any of the protocol procedures
completed here. In addition, by design, all participants were
fit with the same high-quality devices, programmed with
different frequency-gain characteristics based on group
assignment. Generalization to other devices is not possible.
OTC devices may be considerably simpler and more basic,
both electroacoustically (a potential negative) and in terms
of coupling (a potential positive), than the conventional
mini-BTE slim-tube open-fit hearing aids used in this trial.
It should be noted, however, that we have failed previously
to observe significant differences in hearing aid outcomes,
for outcome measures similar to those in this study, for a
wide range of hearing-aid technologies, including some that
today would be representative of simpler OTC devices
(Humes, Ahlstrom, Bratt, & Peek, 2009). More recently,
Cox and colleagues have demonstrated equivalent outcomes
between basic and advanced contemporary hearing aids
(Cox, Johnson, & Xu, 2014, 2016; Johnson, Xu, & Cox,
2016). Nonetheless, the results from this study using

 high-quality hearing aids cannot be generalized to other
devices, including those more likely to be used in OTC
approaches to hearing aid delivery.
One could argue that the AB model evaluated here, in-
cluding real-ear verification of targets, individual adjustment
of maximum power output, and a hearing-aid orientation
and counseling session, may still not be representative of “au-
diology best practices.” True best practices would also include
follow-up appointments during the 6-week trial to adjust the
devices in response to patient complaints. Guidelines for
best practices in delivering hearing aids to adults from the
American Academy of Audiology (Valente et al., 2006) and
the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA,
2015), however, do not include such fine-tuning sessions as
a part of best practices. Further, the only available peer-
reviewed research on this practice (Cunningham, Williams, &
Goldsmith, 2001) indicates that such fine-tuning during follow-
up sessions has no significant effect on measured outcomes.
Finally, assuming that real-ear measurements would guide
such adjustments of responses away from targets, it is unlikely
that this is a widespread practice given the continued low
use of real-ear verification in general by audiologists (e.g.,
Mueller & Picou, 2010). Thus, we do not believe that the
AB model evaluated here was an inappropriately stripped-
down version of true best practices that may have mini-
mized differences in outcome between it and the CD model.
On the other hand, one could argue that the CD par-
ticipants experienced some aspects of audiology best prac-
tices, including a full audiological evaluation and medical
clearance or waiver of such, and that this may have opti-
mized the outcomes for the CD group. At the time this
trial was initiated, the FDA required medical clearance (or
waiver of such) for all hearing aids provided to consumers
and, given what we knew at study inception, we considered
it unethical to provide hearing aids to participants without
a full audiological evaluation. It also could be argued that
the restriction of the choice of devices to only three responses
already pre-programmed for commonly encountered hearing
losses to match NAL-NL2 targets, on average, and using
the same hearing aids as those in the other two branches,
unnecessarily constrained the range to be encountered in
true OTC approaches. Again, it is acknowledged that the
CD instantiation of the OTC approach here is just one of
many possibilities, and it is up to others to validate alterna-
tive OTC approaches. However, the CD model does not
seem to be too farfetched as an early approach to the deliv-
ery of OTC devices. Given the positive outcomes observed
for the CD approach in this study, as well as the FDA’s
recent elimination of the medical-clearance requirement for
hearing aids and its exploration of OTC devices as an alter-
native to hearing aids, the CD approach could certainly
serve as a starting point against which other OTC service-
delivery options could be compared.
Finally, with regard to improvements in outcomes for
the CD and P participants re-examined after an additional
4-week AB-based trial, it should be kept in mind that there
could very well be an order bias such that scores the second
time around may be higher due to additional experience with
the hearing aids. We did not have participants assigned ini-
tially to the AB group complete a 4-week CD or P trial to
counterbalance the order of service-delivery approaches. Our
purpose for including the additional 4-week trial was based
on the ethical treatment of participants and our state of the
knowledge base at the inception of the clinical trial. Based
on the knowledge available at the start of this clinical trial,
the AB approach was considered superior and, due to ran-
dom assignment to CD or P groups, those participants
should not be deprived of a presumably superior service-
delivery approach. AB participants could opt for an addi-
tional 4 weeks to evaluate adjustments to their devices, but
they did not receive an alternative service-delivery model. On
the other hand, arguing against a significant order effect or
experience-based explanation of outcome improvements
from Session 3 to Session 3B is the systematic nature of the
improvements across outcome measures. For example, nei-
ther group showed improvement in PHABavds or usage.
The no-gain P group showed significant improvements in
PHABglobal, CST benefit, and HHIE benefit once adequate
gain was provided. The CD group also showed significant
improvement in PHABglobal, despite having a reasonable
amount of gain in both Session 3 and Session 3B, but this
could be due to better use of communication strategies dis-
cussed in the hearing-aid orientation. Finally, as indicated
by the arrows showing the means from the original AB par-
ticipants in Figures 12–15 and the subsequent analyses of the
147 post-AB participants, the average performance of the
original CD and P participants following a 4-week AB-based
extended trial did not differ significantly from that of the
original AB participants who had only a single 6-week trial.
Conclusions
This single-site double-blind placebo-controlled ran-
domized clinical trial is the first to demonstrate that hearing
aids are efficacious in older adults for an audiology-based
best-practices (AB) service-delivery model. The efficacy of
an alternative OTC approach (CD) in which the consumer
selected pre-programmed devices was also established. Over-
all, the CD model of OTC service delivery yielded only
slightly poorer outcomes than the AB model. Nonetheless,
outcomes for CD participants (as well as P participants)
improved significantly following a 4-week AB-based follow-up
trial. Purchase price, $600 versus $3,600 per pair of hearing
aids, had no effect on outcomes, but a high percentage (85%)
of those who rejected hearing aids paid the higher of the two
prices for their devices. Efficacious OTC service-delivery
models (and devices) may increase accessibility and afford-
ability of hearing aids for millions of older adults, but fur-
ther research is required to evaluate various devices and
approaches, as well as to examine the generalization of the
findings from this clinical trial.
