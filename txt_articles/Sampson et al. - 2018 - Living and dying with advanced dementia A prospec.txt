Abstract
Background: Increasing number of people are dying with advanced dementia. Comfort and quality of life are key goals of care.
Aims: To describe (1) physical and psychological symptoms, (2) health and social care service utilisation and (3) care at end of life in 
people with advanced dementia.
Design: 9-month prospective cohort study.
Setting and participants: Greater London, England, people with advanced dementia (Functional Assessment Staging Scale 6e and 
above) from 14 nursing homes or their own homes.
Main outcome measures: At study entry and monthly: prescriptions, Charlson Comorbidity Index, pressure sore risk/severity 
(Waterlow Scale/Stirling Scale, respectively), acute medical events, pain (Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia), neuropsychiatric 
symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), quality of life (Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia Scale), resource use (Resource 
Utilization in Dementia Questionnaire and Client Services Receipt Inventory), presence/type of advance care plans, interventions, 
mortality, place of death and comfort (Symptom Management at End of Life in Dementia Scale).
Results: Of 159 potential participants, 85 were recruited (62% alive at end of follow-up). Pain (11% at rest, 61% on movement) and 
significant agitation (54%) were common and persistent. Aspiration, dyspnoea, septicaemia and pneumonia were more frequent in 
those who died. In total, 76% had ‘do not resuscitate’ statements, less than 40% advance care plans. Most received primary care visits, 
there was little input from geriatrics or mental health but contact with emergency paramedics was common.
Conclusion: People with advanced dementia lived with distressing symptoms. Service provision was not tailored to their needs. 
Longitudinal multidisciplinary input could optimise symptom control and quality of life.

Introduction
Approximately 850,000 people in the United Kingdom 
have dementia.1 One-third of people aged over 65 years in 
the United Kingdom will die with some form of dementia,2 
the majority will die in care homes3,4 and advanced demen-
tia is becoming a leading cause of death in the United 
Kingdom and across the world.5–7
It has been suggested that the key goals of end-of-life care 
for people with dementia should be to maximise comfort and 
quality of life,8,9 but concerns have been raised about the 
quality of care provided.10,11 Barriers to providing good end-
of-life care include structures of service provision, difficul-
ties in estimating prognosis and uncertainty around when the 
person is entering the terminal phase.12 Studies from the 
United States, The Netherlands, Belgium and Italy13–16 have 
demonstrated a high symptom burden in people with 
advanced dementia, but there has not been a detailed, pro-
spective longitudinal study of physical and psychological 
symptoms and service use in this population in the United 
Kingdom. Data on the UK context would inform service pro-
vision and may facilitate international comparisons in treat-
ment and outcomes, enhancing our understanding of how 
context influences the provision of end-of-life care.
The 3-year Compassion Programme (National Institute 
for Health Research (NIHR) reference number CRN-
PCRN 12621; 12623) used realist methods17 and com-
bined data from multiple sources (including this cohort 
study)18,19 to develop and implement a complex interven-
tion to improve end-of-life care in advanced dementia.20,21 
In this article, we report on a 9-month longitudinal cohort 
study of people with advanced dementia. Our aims were to
1. 
Describe the course of physical and psychological 
symptoms;
2. 
Examine health and social care service utilisation;
3. 
Describe the care received at the end of life.
Methods
Setting
We recruited people with advanced dementia from May 
2012–December 2014, from six Clinical Commissioning 
Groups (CCG; National Health Service (NHS) organisa-
tions overseeing healthcare delivery in England) across 
Greater London. To reflect the estimated place of resi-
dence of people with advanced dementia in the United 
Kingdom, we aimed to recruit 100 people with advanced 
dementia, 70 from nursing homes and 30 residing in their 
own homes.1 We purposively selected 14 nursing homes 
ensuring a representative range of

the Department of Health which regulates and 
inspects health and social care services in England) 
ratings;
•
•

programme enabling staff to provide generalist care 
at the end of life) implementation;22
•
•

•
•
Ownership (private company or state services);
•
•
Areas of socio-economic and ethnic diversity.
The majority (90%) of UK nursing homes are privately 
owned, but residents should have equitable access to all 
core NHS services, such as primary and secondary care 
(including mental health), and palliative care. However, 
access to chiropody, opticians and physiotherapy is less 
consistently provided by statutory services and nursing 
homes, and residents or their families may purchase this 
care privately.
To recruit people with advanced dementia residing in 
their own homes, we used general practices in five CCG 
areas of greater London; practice staff screened patient 
What this paper adds?
1. 
People with advanced dementia live with chronic and persistent symptoms, including pain and agitation.
2. 
There are few acute clinical events that predict impending death and thus prognosis is uncertain.
3. 
Despite complex physical and psychiatric needs, most care is provided by general practitioners or emergency services with 
little input from specialists such as geriatricians or palliative care.
Implications for practice, theory or policy
1. 
Nursing home residents with advanced dementia require multidisciplinary, multi-speciality care, and nursing home staff need 
more support from external healthcare services.
2. 
The potentially long, slow decline in advanced dementia as death approaches and uncertainty about the duration need to be 
taken into account in planning and delivery of services.
3. 
People with advanced dementia would benefit from care focussing on management of physical and psychological symptoms. 
Further study is required to establish the best models for providing this care.

lists to identify potential participants. To ensure access to 
primary care records, we recruited participants (both those 
residing at home and those in nursing homes) who were 
registered with practices linked to the Primary Care 
Research Network which works with general practitioners 
(GPs) to support research.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Nursing home and primary care staff identified potential 
participants meeting the following criteria: clinical diag-
nosis of dementia aged over 65 years and at Functional 
Assessment Staging (FAST) grade 6e and above23 (one of: 
doubly incontinent and speaks only a few words, unable to 
walk, loss of intelligible speech, unable to smile, unable to 
hold their head up). For recruitment and consent proce-
dures, see Jones et al.17
Data collection
At study entry, we documented demographics, Charlson 
Comorbidity Index (CCI)24 (19 diseases weighted on 
their association with mortality); prescribed medica-
tions;25 advance directives, advance statements and 
 
lasting power of attorney. Research staff assessed par-
ticipants using validated scales, through direct observa-
tion or in consultation with carers and nursing home 
staff. Study measures (see Table 1) included physical 
symptoms: pain (Pain Assessment IN Advanced 
Dementia (PAINAD) Scale,30 scores of 2 or greater 
indicate clinically significant pain),31 pressure sore risk 
(Waterlow Scale)28 and pressure sore severity (Stirling 
Scale);29 neuropsychiatric symptoms: Neuropsychiatric 
Inventory (NPI)33 and Cohen Mansfield Agitation 
Inventory (CMAI; scores of over 39 indicate clinically 
significant agitation),32 comfort (Symptom Management 
at the End of Life in Dementia (SM-EOLD)),34 quality 
of life (Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia 
(QUALID))35 and service use with the Client Services 
Receipt Inventory (CSRI) and the Resource Utilization 
in Dementia-Lite (RUD-LITE) Scales.36,37
Participants were assessed every 4 weeks for a maxi-
mum of 9 months. In addition, we documented events from 
the prior month:
•
•
Painful or burdensome interventions, for example, 
enteral feeding tubes, venous or arterial blood tests 
and mechanical ventilation.38
•
•
Symptoms documented as being common or prob-
lematic in advanced dementia: dehydration, consti-
pation, difficulty swallowing, insufficient oral 
intake, weight loss, aspirating/choking on swallow-
ing and difficulties breathing.13
•
•
Acute clinical events: seizures, fever, urinary tract 
infection, pneumonia and septicaemia.39
•
•
After death, we collected information from staff 
and/or family carers on whether the death had been 
‘expected’, whether there was a ‘do not attempt 
resuscitation’ (DNAR) order at the time of death, 
place and primary cause of death.

Data were collected prospectively on paper case-report 
forms. A new form was used at each visit so raters would 
not be influenced by previous scores.
Analysis
Participant characteristics were described using mean values 
or medians for continuous variables (with standard deviation 
(SD) or inter-quartile range (IQR)) and frequencies (percent-
ages) for categorical variables at four time points: (1) study 
entry, (2) for those who died at the final visit prior to death, 
(3) for those who were still alive at the end of the study at the 
final visit and (4) for the whole cohort at the final visit. If 
more than 20% of questionnaire items were missing, the total 
was set as missing for the individual as this may have implied 
non-completion of the whole questionnaire. If less than 20% 
of items were missing per individual, mean scores were 
imputed.40 Analyses were performed using Stata 13.
Ethics
Our approach was based on the UK Mental Capacity Act 
2005, and a personal or a nominated ‘professional’ con-
sultee gave their informed written agreement for the person 
with advanced dementia to participate17 (National Research 
Ethics Committee East of England approval 12/EE/0003).
Results
Of 159 potential participants with advanced dementia, 85 
were recruited, 79 resided in nursing homes and 6 in their 
own homes (Online Figure 1). At study entry, all question-
naires were completed. In total, 21 (0.6%) individual ques-
tionnaires over follow-up had one or two missing items 
which were imputed. At the last visit, data collection varied 
from missing in two participants (2%) on the entire Confusion 
Assessment Method (CAM), QUALID and PAINAD at rest 
scales to missing in six participants (7%) on the PAINAD 
activity scale and symptoms proforma.
Cohort characteristics
The majority were women (median age of 85 years, IQR of 
81–90). Median length of nursing home residence was 3 years 
(IQR of 1–5). For the 53 (62%) participants alive, at end of 
follow-up, a median number of 9 (IQR of 8–9) assessments 
were completed. Mortality at 9 months was 37%, 32 partici-
pants died, with a median of four assessments (IQR of 2.5–
6.5). At study entry, 76% of the cohort had a DNAR order, 
30% had an advance care plan, 40% a documented preferred 
place of death and 40% a lasting power of attorney.
Diagnoses and comorbidities
Alzheimer’s disease followed by vascular dementia were 
most common. The mean Bedford Alzheimer Nursing Scale 
(BANS) score was 21 (SD = 3.4), indicating participants 
were severely impaired. Participants had an average 
Charlson comorbidity score of 6 (SD = 1.5), and 38% were 
taking 6–9 different classes of drugs (Table 2).
Clinical symptoms
At study entry, 53% were at very high risk of pressure 
sores (Waterlow Scale). On the Stirling pressure sore 
severity scale, 22% had early signs of pressure sores and 
16 participants (19%) had partial-to-full skin thickness 
loss. Pressure sore risk and prevalence of pressure sores 
remained constant throughout follow-up and there were no 
differences in pressure sore risk between those who died 
and those who were still alive at the final assessment 
(Table 3 and Figure 1).
The proportion of participants observed to be in pain at 
study entry, both at rest (11%) and during movement 
(61%), changed little during follow-up (Figure 1). Over 
half of participants had clinically significant agitation on 
the CMAI at study entry (54%) with a slight reduction at 
the final assessment for those who died (45%) compared to 
those still alive (56%). Other common psychiatric symp-
toms at study entry were depression (36%), anxiety (35%), 
apathy (53%), motor disturbances (33%) and night-time 
behaviours (waking during the night or sleeping exces-
sively during the day (44%)). The prevalence of these 
remained unchanged throughout follow-up for all partici-
pants, apart from depression which increased to 42% of 
those alive at the end of the study and 48% who died and 
motor disturbances which increased to 48% of those who 
remained alive and 50% of those who died (Table 3).
The commonest physical symptoms at study entry were 
difficulty swallowing (42%) and weight loss in the prior 
month (34%). At the final study visit, a higher proportion 
of those who died experienced aspiration on swallowing 
(20% compared to 4% those who remained alive) and 
breathing difficulties (47% compared to 21% of those who 
remained alive).
Acute clinical events
Urinary tract infection was the commonest acute medical 
event at study entry (14% of participants in the prior 
month). Septicaemia and pneumonia occurred in 17% of 
participants who died compared to those who were alive 
at the final study assessment (septicaemia 2% and pneu-
monia 4%).
Quality of life and comfort
Quality of life (QUALID Scale) remained constant from 
study entry (24.4, SD = 6.8) until final study assessment 
(24.3, SD = 5.3) deteriorating slightly towards death (25.8, 
SD = 7.0) (higher scores indicate lower quality of life) as did 
scores for comfort on the SM-EOLD (Table 3 and Figure 1).

Service use
General (acute) hospital admission was infrequent in the 
month prior to study entry (0.18 admissions per partici-
pant) and remained low during follow-up (Table 4). Use 
of outpatient services was more frequent. In the month 
prior to study entry, there were 0.31 contacts per partici-
pant with paramedics or emergency ambulance services 
and 10.3% saw a paramedic. In the month prior to death, 
there were 0.75 paramedic contacts per participant and 
19% were seen by a paramedic at the nursing home.
Participants had no contacts with community nursing ser-
vices, although contact with ‘specialist’ nurses increased to 
12.5% of those who died (from 7.7% at baseline) likely due 
to palliative care nurses being called in. Contact with other 
professionals such as chiropodist, optician and dentist was 
more frequent. The majority of participants were seen by a 
GP during the study and 96% of those who died saw a GP in 
their last month. There was little contact with geriatricians, 
neurologists, psychiatrists or community psychiatric nurses.
Care received at the end of life
The most frequent interventions in the month prior to death 
were blood tests (14%) and urinary catheters (14%). Death 
was ‘expected’ in 90% of cases; 81% died in the nursing 
home and one person died in their own home. Of those 
who died, 34% were referred to and 28% were seen by the 
palliative care team. A DNAR was in place for 93% of 
those who died, and the commonest cause of death was 
aspiration pneumonia (Table 5).
Discussion
Course of physical and psychological symptoms
Mortality at 9 months (37%) was comparable to 6-month 
mortality rates in people with advanced dementia from the 
United States (18%), Italy (20%) and The Netherlands 
(37%).41–43 The commonest physical symptoms at study entry 
were difficulty swallowing and weight loss. Pain on move-
ment, agitation and apathy were also frequent and persisted at 
clinically significant levels throughout the study. Aspiration 
and breathing difficulties increased in the month prior to 
death, and the commonest acute events prior to death were 
septicaemia and pneumonia.
Our participants were similar in disease severity and 
demographics to cohorts from The Netherlands,44 
Belgium45 (for whom data were collected retrospectively 
after death) and the United States,39 which also found 
pain, agitation and dyspnoea to be the commonest symp-
toms.39,46 As the end of life approaches, difficulties in 
swallowing, problems with eating and risk of pneumonia 
also increase.13 We report a comparable symptom profile 
in the United Kingdom and, in addition, demonstrate how 
these symptoms were chronic and unchanging. This is 
important as our participants were unable to express their 
needs and were, therefore, vulnerable to long-term suf-
fering. However, despite concerns regarding suboptimal 
care in the United Kingdom,10 mean symptom manage-
ment scores (SM-EOLD) were similar to those found in 
The Netherlands44 and Belgium,15 but lower than found 
in the United States.47
Service use
General Practitioners were the main providers of medical 
care with most participants having contact during the study. 
Despite the prevalence of chronic pain and psychiatric symp-
toms, little specialist healthcare was provided. Of 85 partici-
pants, only 5 saw a geriatrician and a psychiatrist with 
negligible contact with community psychiatric nurses. 
Paramedics were major providers of assessment and health-
care towards the end of life (although few contacts led to 
acute hospital admissions) suggesting a reactive response to 
needs. In the United Kingdom, studies have found that nurs-
ing home residents are often poorly served by existing 
healthcare arrangements48 and receive less planned and more 
emergency care than those living in the community.49 Use of 
social care services also increased in the month prior to 
death; 25% of participants who died having contact com-
pared to an average of 4.6% of participants during follow-up. 
There was more contact with chiropodists, dentists and opti-
cians, reflecting how these services are often purchased-in 
by care homes or by relatives.
Care received at the end of life
Apart from septicaemia and pneumonia, indicators of 
impending death were not clearly identifiable. Palliative 
care outreach teams saw 28% of those who died (34%

were referred), predominantly in the month prior to 
death.40 This proportion is higher than in the United 
States (25%)50 and The Netherlands (2.5%);51 however, 
there are differences in healthcare provision between 
these countries. In The Netherlands, nursing homes have 
a dedicated physician who provides the majority of med-
ical and palliative care ‘in-house’. Nursing homes in our 
study were poorly serviced by community medical ser-
vices and did not have dedicated physicians, thus pallia-
tive care teams were called in at the end of life to assist 
with symptom management. Although 76% of our par-
ticipants had DNAR orders, only 5% had an advance 
decision to refuse treatment, the same proportion as that 
found in The Netherlands,52 40% had a recorded

preferred place of death and 16% died in hospitals. Care 
planning focussed on resuscitation decisions and place 
of death, rather than the type of care that the person 
would like to receive. Numerous initiatives have tried to 
address a lack of advance care planning in nursing 
homes,28 but there are systemic challenges to effective 
implementation.44
Strengths and weaknesses
We did not reach our recruitment target despite extending 
our recruitment period and receiving support from the 
Primary Care Research Network; many GPs did not hold 
records of patients with advanced dementia, and it was dif-
ficult to locate people living in their own homes. We recruited

from a range of nursing homes, ensuring these were repre-
sentative by purposively sampling by size, CQC rating, own-
ership and local socio-economic factors to reflect the current 
UK nursing home market. In the United Kingdom, 25% of 
nursing homes are rated ‘inadequate’ or ‘requires improve-
ment’; in London, 20% receive a similar rating and 28% of 
nursing homes in our study were in this category. Thus, by 
these measures, our study nursing homes are more represent-
ative of the United Kingdom in general, rather than of 
London. We cannot be sure that our participants are repre-
sentative of people in the United Kingdom with advanced 
dementia as no comparative data are available. However, the 
demographic composition of our cohort is similar to that of 
UK48 and international studies of advanced dementia.13,46 
Nursing home documentation was not standardised, particu-
larly for comorbidity, service use and interventions. Previous 
studies have been mainly retrospective, relying on symptom 
recall. We used detailed prospective methods44,45 and reliable 
validated tools to allow international comparisons.
Implications for clinical practice
Many current policies and tools focus on making an 
advance care plan, particularly regarding the preferred 
place of death. These can be beneficial but rely on iden-
tifying those who are approaching the end of life and, as 
our data suggest, this is challenging. Complex symp-
toms require active specialist intervention, multidisci-
plinary working and effective care coordination, but 
GPs feel they do not have the time or knowledge to do 
this.53 Increased collaboration between geriatric medi-
cine, palliative care and psychiatry may be helpful but 
should be coordinated and supported by adequate 
resourcing and service commissioning.54 Although the 
evidence base for interventions in dementia end-of-life 
care remains limited,55 considering data used in our 
development of a complex intervention to improve care 
in advanced dementia,20 we suggest a coordinated 
needs-based longitudinal approach should be developed 
and tested.12 A recent survey found ‘hospice enabled 
care’ is an emerging model for palliative care for people 
with dementia in the United Kingdom.56 This involves 
palliative care specialists, predominantly nurses, pro-
viding care coordination and symptom management 
expertise to nursing home residents,12 and this may war-
rant further formal evaluation.
Policy and end-of-life care interventions promote the 
importance of end-of-life care in dementia8 and have 
focused on the place of death; but to improve comfort and 
quality of life, better management of chronic symptoms is 
required.53 This would enable people to live and die well 
with dementia.
