F
oot and ankle trauma accounts for more than 3 million emergency department 
visits annually in the United States.1 These injuries can be a clinically significant 
source of morbidity and long-term disability in elite athletes, as well as in the gen-
eral population. Thus, emergency department physicians, primary care physicians, sports 
medicine physicians, orthopedic surgeons, and athletic trainers must be familiar with these 
conditions to prevent missed diagnoses or mismanagement. 
 
In this article, we discuss common sports-related foot and ankle injuries, including lat-
eral talar process fractures, os trigonum injuries, Lisfranc injuries, turf toe, navicular stress 
fractures, and syndesmotic injuries. Prompt diagnosis and management of these conditions 
is important to avoid long-term sequelae. 
Lateral Talar Process Fractures
Commonly known as the snowboarder’s fracture, lateral talar process fractures have 
 
increased in frequency since 1943 because of the rising popularity of snowboarding.2 
The mechanism of injury is not fully defined but is thought to be axial loading with forced 
ankle dorsiflexion and possibly additional inversion or external rotation forces.3 Because 
physicians may have difficulty detecting this fracture on plain radiographs and patients 
present with lateral ankle pain and swelling, these injuries are frequently misdiagnosed as 
severe ankle sprains.4 Untreated lateral talar process fractures have a high likelihood for 
development of subtalar osteoarthritis.2 Therefore, these fractures can cause severe pain and 
disability years after injury. 
Anatomy
The talus has 2 processes, lateral and posterior, that project from its body. The lateral 
 
process is a broad-based, wedge-shaped prominence with an articular surface dorsolaterally 
for the fibula and inferomedially for the anterior aspect of the posterior facet of the calca-
neus. The lateral talocalcaneal ligament originates from its tip.4-6 The posterior process is 
lateral to the groove for the flexor hallucis longus. If not completely fused, this ossicle 
 
is frequently referred to as the os trigonum.

Injuries to the foot and ankle are commonly encountered, especially among 
athletes, and can lead to morbidity if not managed appropriately. Health care 
professionals must have a firm understanding of injury anatomy, diagnoses, 
and management. This article provides a review of lateral talus process frac-
tures, os trigonum injuries, Lisfranc injuries, turf toe, navicular stress fractures, 
and syndesmotic injuries.

Os Trigonum Injuries
The os trigonum is an accessory bone located at the pos-
terolateral aspect of the talus in approximately 5% to 
10% of the global population.8 Injuries to this structure 
are usually caused by repetitive plantar flexion motion of 
the ankle or acute trauma, which result in an avulsion 
injury of the posterior talofibular ligament, fracture of the 
Stieda process or os trigonum, or cartilaginous synchon-
drosis disruption.8 Dancers and athletes who participate 
in kicking sports are particularly susceptible to these in-
juries because their feet are in a forced plantar flexed 
position.9 These injuries are often confused with Achilles 
tendon and flexor hallucis longus injuries because of the 
proximity of the os trigonum to these structures. If these 
conditions are undiagnosed, athletes compensate by ro-
tating the hindfoot and ankle into a varus position, 
leading to other conditions such as peroneal tendinitis, 
recurrent ankle sprains, and sinus tarsi syndrome.9,10
Anatomy
The os trigonum is of variable size and shape (eg, round, 
oval, triangular) and is located posterior to the talus and 
lateral to the flexor hallucis longus tendon. The os tri-
gonum is formed when there is failure of fusion of a 
secondary ossification center of the lateral tubercle or 
 
a stress fracture of the Stieda process, an elongated 
 
lateral tubercle of the talus.9,11 
Diagnosis
Patients describe pain in the posterior aspect of the ankle, 
particularly while plantar flexing. Tenderness to palpa-
tion is usually elicited between the Achilles and peroneal 
tendons. Other common symptoms are stiffness and 
swelling behind the ankle, especially with forced plantar 
flexion and when wearing high heels.9 
 
Typically, physical examination and plain radio-
graphs are sufficient for diagnosis. Radiographs often 
detect fractures of the os trigonum or Stieda process.9 
To evaluate for impingement in dancers, a lateral weight-
bearing view of the ankle in the demi-pointe position 
should be obtained.10 However, even if there is no bony 
Diagnosis
Clinically, patients exhibit pain and symptoms similar to 
purely ligamentous inversion ankle sprains,3 which in-
clude marked swelling and pain over the lateral ankle. 
Point tenderness is often elicited over the lateral process 
of the talus, anterior and inferior to the tip of the lateral 
malleolus.4 Patients often have extreme difficulty with 
range of motion of the ankle in all planes because of pain. 
Also, weight bearing can be difficult even with the as-
sistance of a controlled ankle motion boot. 
 
Initial management should include orthogonal views 
of plain radiographs; however, the injury is often missed 
by this modality. Particularly on the lateral view, overlap 
of the malleoli and the sustentaculum tali can make de-
tection of the fracture extremely difficult.5 Lateral talar 
process fractures are best seen on the mortise view, espe-
cially with the foot in slight plantar flexion.6 Computed 
tomography is considered the criterion standard for diag-
nosing these injuries. This modality can also be helpful 
in accurately measuring fragments, as well as assessing 
displacement, comminution, and fracture pattern.
Management
Management is dictated by the size of the fracture frag-
ment, displacement, comminution, associated injuries, 
and joint congruity. Fracture fragments smaller than 
 
1 cm with less than 2 mm of displacement can be treated 
nonoperatively.5 Nonoperative management usually con-
sists of cast immobilization with non–weight-bearing 
precautions for 4 to 6 weeks.4 Physical therapy may be 
necessary after immobilization to restore range of 
 
motion of the ankle and subtalar joints.5 
 
Operative management is indicated for fractures 
 
with displacement of more than 2 mm, greater than 1 cm 
 
in size, or notable comminution.5 Options are open re-
duction internal fixation, arthroscopic fixation, and exci-
sion of the fracture fragment.2,4 Up to 1 cm of the lateral 
process of the talus can be excised without residual ankle 
instability.5 The lateral talocalcaneal ligament becomes 
 
incompetent with excision; however, this change does 
not affect clinical outcomes.7

including the 3 cuneiform-metatarsal articulations and 
the 2 cuboid-metatarsal articulations of the fourth 
 
and fifth rays. The distal articular surfaces of the cunei-
forms and the cuboid provide for the transverse arch of 
the foot. The metatarsals comprise the distal half of the 
longitudinal arch. The interosseous Lisfranc ligament 
spans from the medial cuneiform to the base of the 
second metatarsal on the plantar surface.15 This joint is 
inherently stable with minimal motion owing to its 
 
recessed position, “roman arch” stability, and the mul-
tiple ligamentous restraints.13
Diagnosis
Patients may present with a relatively benign history of 
injury, examination, and radiographic studies or a high-
energy mechanism with obvious radiographic abnor-
malities. Patients with subtle Lisfranc complex injuries 
often have varied degrees of swelling throughout the 
midfoot and reliably report pain with attempted weight-
bearing activity.14 Patients may exhibit tenderness to 
palpation in the midfoot and classic plantar ecchymosis, 
which suggests ligamentous injury or fracture.13 
 
Plain radiographs may not show any abnormalities; 
however, weight-bearing anteroposterior (30°) and lat-
eral radiographs should be obtained in all patients with 
presumed Lisfranc injuries.14 Findings are often subtle; 
therefore, physicians must evaluate radiographs care-
fully for misalignment. The normal anteroposterior ra-
diograph should demonstrate alignment of the medial 
border of the second metatarsal with the medial side 
 
of the middle cuneiform. The 30° oblique view shows 
the alignment of the medial border of the second meta-
tarsal with the middle cuneiform and the medial border 
of the fourth metatarsal base with the medial border of 
the cuboid. On the lateral view, the dorsal and plantar 
aspects of the metatarsals should correspond with the 
cuneiform and cuboid.13 If any doubt remains, ob-
taining radiographs of the contralateral foot may assist 
with diagnosis.
 
Computed tomography and MR imaging may also be 
used. A computed tomographic scan is useful to aid de-
tection and delineation of fracture patterns.13 Magnetic 
contact between the os trigonum and the talus, impinge-
ment cannot be ruled out owing to a cartilaginous layer 
overlying the os trigonum.9 
 
Although magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is often 
not necessary, it can confirm the diagnosis and rule out 
other causes, such as Achilles tendinosis or fracture of 
the posterior process of the talus. Bone marrow edema 
 
of the os trigonum and inflammation may be present 
 
in the flexor hallucis longus tendon sheath, as well as 
surrounding the os trigonum.12 
Management
Conservative management consisting of activity modifi-
cation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ice, im-
mobilization, and rest should be trialed initially. 
Cortisone injections guided by ultrasonography or fluo-
roscopy can confirm the diagnosis and relieve pain but 
are often not longlasting.9 If a patient’s symptoms do not 
improve after 3 to 6 months of conservative manage-
ment, operative management consists of surgical exci-
sion of the os trigonum, which can be performed through 
an open or arthroscopic technique.8
Lisfranc Injuries
Injuries to the Lisfranc joint, also known as the tarso-
metatarsal complex, may involve the bases of the 5 meta-
tarsals, their articulations with the 4 distal tarsal bones, 
and the Lisfranc ligament. Approximately one-third of 
these injuries are subtle and low energy, commonly 
caused by excessive plantar flexion and abduction forces 
with associated longitudinal force applied to the fore-
foot.13 In athletes, misdiagnosis or maltreatment may 
prolong return to competitive play and can lead to post-
traumatic arthritis and chronic pain that limits activity 
and quality of life in the future.14 Therefore, physicians 
must have a high index of suspicion for these injuries to 
limit long-term disability.13
Anatomy
The Lisfranc joint is the transition between the midfoot 
and the forefoot. This joint consists of 3 articulations,

resonance imaging can demonstrate ruptures or sprains 
of the Lisfranc ligament, which may lead to instability.16
Management
Nonoperative management is limited to injuries with 
normal anatomy on radiographs that do not exhibit 
instability. Conservative management consists of rest, 
ice, elevation, and, most importantly, immobilization. 
Patients are given a walking cast or controlled ankle 
motion boot and are permitted to bear weight as com-
fort allows.13 Although these patients are permitted to 
bear weight, they may have difficulty doing so be-
cause of pain.
 
Surgical management is indicated for any injury 
with displacement seen on weight-bearing radio-
graphs or non–weight-bearing, as this injury is indica-
tive of instability. Instability is defined as a greater 
than 2-mm shift in normal joint position. An open or 
percutaneous approach with internal fixation is usu-
ally necessary because of the difficult reduction and 
residual deformity with closed reduction and casting.5 
Anatomic reduction should be considered because of 
the midfoot tarsometatarsal joints’ poor tolerance for 
malalignment.13 Primary arthrodesis of the Lisfranc 
region of the foot is another option. Whether 1 of 
these 2 procedures results in better outcomes than the 
other is a controversial topic, and current management 
will depend on the physician.5 
Turf Toe
A common condition among athletes,17 turf toe involves 
a spectrum of injury to the structures on the plantar as-
pect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Most injuries 
are caused by a combination of a hyperdorsiflexion force 
and axial load on the metatarsophalangeal joint with the 
foot fixed in equinus. This type of injury is often a result 
of contact with another player or a playing surface. If 
misdiagnosed and mismanaged, this injury could result 
in long-term sequelae, such as persistent pain, weakness 
in push-off, stiffness, deformity, and development of 
joint arthritis.17
Anatomy
The first metatarsophalangeal joint has limited inherent 
stability because of the shallow articulation between 
the convex metatarsal head and concave base of the 
proximal phalanx articular surface. Stability is attrib-
uted to the complex attachments of the joint capsule 
and the ligamentous structures surrounding it.17 The 
sesamoid bones, which are closely connected to the fi-
brous layer of the joint capsule, also provide stability, 
and their function is to increase the power of plantar 
flexion of the first ray by increasing the moment of the 
intrinsic flexors.18 
Diagnosis
Clinical presentation depends on the severity of the in-
jury. Patients typically present with difficulty bearing 
weight and tenderness to palpation of the first metatarso-
phalangeal joint in a low-grade injury. All structures, in-
cluding the collateral ligaments, sesamoids, plantar plate, 
and dorsal capsule, should be palpated. Instability and 
deformity may develop with more severe injuries. Insta-
bility is assessed by performing the varus or valgus stress 
test and the dorsoplantar drawer test of the metatarsopha-
langeal joint. Patients often have ecchymosis and edema 
in the area as well.17 
 
Anteroposterior, lateral, and axial sesamoid radio-
graphs with the patient bearing weight are important in 
the initial evaluation of the injury. In cases of severe in-
jury, obtaining radiographs with the patient bearing 
weight may not be possible. Lateral and medial 40° 
oblique views allow visualization of the lateral and me-
dial sesamoids, respectively. Dorsiflexion lateral stress 
views can be useful to show movement of the sesamoids, 
indicating instability.17 Magnetic resonance imaging can 
be used to evaluate the extent of plantar plate disruption, 
as well as the integrity of surrounding structures, in-
cluding the flexor hallucis longus and the articular sur-
face of the joint.18
Management
Initially, patients may be treated with conservative mea-
sures such as rest and ice. Taping the toe simultaneously

the main blood supply, and the lateral tarsal branches 
supply a portion of the dorsal navicular.22 However, 
the central one-third of the navicular body, which is 
the zone of maximum shear stress, is devoid of direct 
blood supply in some people; thus, the navicular is a 
watershed area, making healing difficult.20 This cen-
tral area with its tenuous blood supply is predisposed 
to poor healing and nonunion.
Diagnosis
Patients typically present with poorly localized midfoot 
pain aggravated by physical stress and relieved by rest.19 
Usually, minimal associated swelling or deformity are 
present. Focal tenderness to palpation is often elicited 
over the dorsal aspect of the navicular.20 
 
Plain radiographs often do not show obvious causes. 
Weeks may pass before fracture lines become evident. 
Therefore, physicians must have a high index of suspi-
cion for this injury and, if suspected, an MR image 
should be obtained20 to demonstrate marrow edema in 
the area of the stress fracture.23
Management
Optimal management is controversial because of the 
prolonged immobilization and limitation of activity nec-
essary when these injuries are managed conserva-
tively.19,20 Nonoperative management is indicated for 
patients with nondisplaced and incomplete fractures. 
Strict immobilization with casting and instructions for 
the patient to not bear weight until healing is complete 
yields excellent outcomes.20 Operative management with 
percutaneous or open reduction with internal fixation is 
often performed in elite athletes who desire quicker re-
turn to activity.19 In nondisplaced fractures without scle-
rosis, surgeons should consider percutaneous fixation; 
however, in displaced or sclerotic fractures, open reduc-
tion with bone grafting is indicated.24
Syndesmotic Injuries 
Injuries to the syndesmosis are common in sports in 
which high-torque cutting, jumping forces, and high-
compresses and immobilizes the joint, thus reducing 
pain. Patients may gradually progress toward weight 
bearing as pain allows.17 
 
Operative management is recommended for large 
capsular avulsions, unstable joints, diastasis or dis-
traction of the sesamoids, vertical instability, intra-
articular loose bodies, chondral injury, and failed 
conservative management.17 Operative techniques 
often consist of a plantar plate or capsular repair. 
When sesamoid fracture is present, open reduction 
internal fixation is an option, as well as partial exci-
sion of the sesamoid. Caution must be used when ex-
cising the sesamoid because of the risk of iatrogenic 
hallux varus or valgus18 after removal of the fibular or 
tibial sesamoid, respectively. 
Navicular Stress Fractures
As a result of microscopic trauma sustained when the 
bone is subjected to repeated submaximal stresses, na-
vicular stress fractures can occur.19 Physicians must have 
a high index of suspicion, especially in patients who 
participate in high-impact and explosive athletic activi-
ties because of the vague and nonspecific symptoms of 
dorsal foot pain. These stress fractures usually occur 
during the foot-strike phase of running, especially in the 
equinus foot, when compression forces are generated 
from distal to proximal across the medial and lateral as-
pects of the navicular via the first and second metatarso-
cuneiform joints.20 Late identification can be associated 
with chronic pain and disability, and it may predispose 
the joints to nonunion.19
Anatomy
The navicular is a medial tarsal bone with a concave 
proximal articular surface that articulates with the 
talus. Distally, its convex surface articulates with the 
first to third cuneiforms. The only muscle attachment 
is the tibialis posterior, which inserts on its tuberosity 
proximally and medially.21 The blood supply to the 
navicular is an important component of its anatomy. 
The medial tarsal branches of the dorsalis pedis are

mentous injuries without fracture on plain radiographs 
unless stress view radiographic imaging is performed; 
therefore, if syndesmotic injury is suspected, stress 
views should be obtained.25 
 
Although ultrasonography is reported to have high 
reliability in diagnosing syndesmotic injury, it is very 
operator-dependent.29 Magnetic resonance imaging is 
useful for acute injuries because of its signal changes, 
and it also helps to rule out associated abnormalities.30 
Athletes may require an examination with anesthesia or 
arthroscopic evaluation before an appropriate course 
 
of management can be determined.25
Management 
Nonoperative management is indicated in stable injuries. 
Rest, ice, and elevation are helpful to diminish swelling 
after the initial trauma. Immobilization with a controlled 
ankle motion boot is recommended. Progression to 
weight bearing, functional exercises, and proprioceptive 
exercises can be made within the first week.25
 
Unstable injuries require operative fixation. No true 
consensus exists regarding the operative stabilization of 
the syndesmosis. Surgical techniques are highly sur-
geon-dependent and include screw fixation alone or 
suture button implants with or without arthroscopic re-
duction assistance. Associated fractures of the tibia and 
fibula, if present, should be treated with open reduction 
and internal fixation. The syndesmosis can be stabilized 
with screws or a suture button device, depending on 
surgeon preference.25
Conclusion
Appropriate diagnosis and management of common in-
juries of the foot and ankle are necessary to avoid long-
term morbidity and disability. Clinical symptoms are 
often vague and at times difficult to detect with plain ra-
diographs; therefore, physicians’ index of suspicion 
should remain high for all of the aforementioned condi-
tions. When in doubt, further imaging should be obtained 
or referral to an orthopedic surgeon should be given to 
avoid long-term sequelae. 
speed collisions can occur or the terrain is artificial or 
uneven. The mechanism is typically associated with ex-
ternal rotation and pronation or dorsiflexion of the ankle. 
Injuries can be purely ligamentous (also known as high 
ankle sprains) or more commonly associated with frac-
tures of the tibia or fibula.25 Proper and timely manage-
ment is important because these injuries may result in 
substantial missed time from athletic activity, they may 
potentially require surgical stabilization, and they are 
associated with long-term ankle dysfunction.26 Physi-
cians must distinguish syndesmotic injury from classic 
inversion ankle sprains caused by ankle instability due to 
long-term morbidity associated with improperly treated 
syndesmotic injuries.27
Anatomy
The ankle syndesmosis is an inherently stable articula-
tion composed of multiple ligamentous structures, 
 
including the anterior-inferior tibiofibular ligament the 
posterior-inferior tibiofibular ligament, the interosseous 
ligament, and the transverse ligament that connect 
 
the distal tibia to the fibula.25 The posterior-inferior tibio-
fibular ligament is considered the most integral ligament 
in this complex. The fibula rests within the incisura of 
 
the tibia, a concave triangular groove.28
Diagnosis
Clinically, pain is often diffuse but can be located an-
terolaterally and posteromedially about the ankle 
joint, as well as proximally throughout the leg. On 
examination, swelling and ecchymosis are often 
present, as well as tenderness of the syndesmosis. 
Provocative tests that have been described include the 
squeeze test, the radiographic external rotation stress 
test, the intraoperative cotton test, fibular translation, 
and cross-leg tests.25 
 
Plain radiographs should be obtained, including 
anteroposterior, mortise, and lateral views. Full-length 
tibia or fibula radiographic imaging should also be or-
dered to assess the proximal fibula for fracture, indi-
cating a Maisonneuve injury. In certain circumstances, 
physicians may have difficulty assessing purely liga-
