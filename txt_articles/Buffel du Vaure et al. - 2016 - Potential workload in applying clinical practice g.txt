ABSTRACT
Objectives: To describe the potential workload for
patients with multimorbidity when applying existing
clinical practice guidelines.
Design: Systematic analysis of clinical practice
guidelines for chronic conditions and simulation
modelling approach.
Data sources: National Guideline Clearinghouse index
of US clinical practice guidelines.
Study selection: We identified the most recent
guidelines for adults with 1 of 6 prevalent chronic
conditions in primary care (ie hypertension, diabetes,
coronary heart disease (CHD), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), osteoarthritis and
depression).
Data extraction: From the guidelines, we extracted all
recommended health-related activities (HRAs) such as
drug management, self-monitoring, visits to the
doctor, laboratory tests and changes of lifestyle for a
patient aged 45–64 years with moderate severity of
conditions.
Simulation modelling approach: For each HRA
identified, we performed a literature review to
determine the potential workload in terms of time
spent on this HRA. Then, we used a simulation
modelling approach to estimate the potential workload
needed to comply with these recommended HRAs for
patients with several of these chronic conditions.
Results: Depending on the concomitant chronic
condition, patients with 3 chronic conditions complying
with all the guidelines would have to take a minimum of
6 to a maximum of 13 medications per day, visit a
health caregiver a minimum of 1.2 to a maximum of 5.9
times per month and spend a mean (SD) of 49.6 (27.3)
to 71.0 (34.5) h/month in HRAs. The potential workload
increased greatly with increasing number of
concomitant conditions, rising to 18 medications per
day, 6.6 visits per month and 80.7 (35.8) h/month in
HRAs for patients with 6 chronic conditions.
INTRODUCTION
Non-communicable chronic conditions such
as
cardiovascular
diseases,
diabetes
and
chronic respiratory diseases are major public
health challenges.1 In the USA, about half of
all adults have at least one chronic condi-
tion;2 these conditions are the main cause of
poor
health,
disability
and
death,
and
account for most of the healthcare expendi-
tures.3–5
Multimorbidity, defined as the coexistence
of chronic conditions, is becoming the norm
in primary care settings.1 5 The prevalence of
multimorbidity is increasing and now repre-
sents 23% in the general population and up
to 65% in people aged 65 years and older.6
Furthermore, 55% of patients with a chronic
condition have multimorbidities.6 The man-
agement of patients with multimorbidity is
challenging.
Indeed,
most
evidence-based
clinical practice guidelines are constructed
with
a
‘single
condition’
approach.7–9
Physicians are supposed to synthesise all
guidelines
developed
for
each
individual
condition when managing patients with mul-
timorbidity. For example, following clinical
practice
guidelines,
a
hypothetical
78-year-old

Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This is the first study assessing the potential
workload for patients with multimorbidity in
applying clinical practice guidelines in terms of
time, number of medications and number of
visits, focusing on the six prevalent chronic con-
ditions in primary care.
▪ The data are based on a systematic assessment
of guidelines and a literature review.
▪ Time estimations are probably underestimated
because we were not able to find estimates for
specific health-related activities such as time
spent buying and preparing medications.
▪ Since we used US guidelines, our results may
not be generalisable to all countries and all
healthcare systems.

 conditions (osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, diabetes type 2,
hypertension
and
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease, COPD) would be prescribed up to 12 separate
medications, taken at 5 times during the day and should
be engaged in 14 non-pharmacological activities.10
Thus, patients with multimorbidity deal with the
burden of illness and also the burden of treatment,
defined as the workload imposed by healthcare on
patients and the effect this has on quality of life.11 12
Patient workload encompasses all demands in their lives
for health-related activities (HRAs) such as scheduling
and attending appointments, preventive care, drug man-
agement, self-monitoring, visits to the doctor, laboratory
tests, changes of lifestyle and paperwork. For example,
patients with type 2 diabetes managed with oral agents
could spend 143 min daily in recommended self-care.13
To our knowledge, the potential workload related to
applying the combination of these guidelines has never
been evaluated.
This study aimed to describe the potential workload of
HRAs in applying clinical practice guidelines for patients
with multimorbidity in primary care settings.
METHODS
To describe the potential workload in applying clinical
practice guidelines to patients with multimorbidity, we
selected six chronic conditions prevalent in a primary
care setting: hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart
disease (CHD), COPD, knee osteoarthritis and depres-
sion.6 Since the recommendations in guidelines are
according to patient characteristics, we defined a specific
patient profile for whom the guidelines would apply: a
male 45–64 years old. We chose this patient profile
because the prevalence of multimorbidities in this
age group is >30.4% (95% CI 30.2% to 30.5%).6
Furthermore, people in this age group probably have
more professional and family responsibilities. Thus,
dealing with a heavy workload might increase their
burden of treatment. We arbitrarily chose a male. For
each condition, we considered it at a moderate stage. We
arbitrarily chose that a patient with CHD or COPD was
smoking and that a patient with knee osteoarthritis was
overweight14 (see online supplementary appendix 1).
Then, we searched the most recent clinical practice
guidelines dedicated to the management of each condi-
tion, to a combination of two or more conditions, as well
as to smoking cessation, overweight, immunisation and
prevention services. From these guidelines, we extracted
all HRAs (ie, medication, diet, education, physical exer-
cise, self-monitoring, visits to care providers, complemen-
tary
tests,
etc)
that
were
moderately
and
strongly
recommended for the management of a moderately
severe condition. Then, we performed a literature review
to determine the potential workload in terms of time
spent on each HRA. Finally, we estimated the potential
workload needed to comply with these clinical practice
guidelines for patients with 1–6 chronic conditions.
Identification of clinical practice guidelines
We searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse
(NGC) (http://www.guideline.gov) to identify the most
recent clinical practice guidelines for hypertension, dia-
betes, CHD, COPD, osteoarthritis, depression, smoking
cessation, overweight, prevention services and immunisa-
tion. The NGC is a public resource for evidence-based
clinical practice guidelines developed by the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality, US Department of
Health and Human Services. We focused on this library
because, to the best of our knowledge, it is the only
library that systematically reviews guidelines, using a stan-
dardised process, before the guidelines are posted to the
NGC website and indexed, which ensures their quality,
and all guidelines are freely available. The search was
performed on 14 June 2013 using the keywords ‘hyper-
tension’, ‘diabetes’, ‘ischaemic heart disease’, ‘chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease’,
‘osteoarthritis’
and
‘depression’, ‘smoking cessation’ and ‘overweight’. For
prevention
services,
we
used
the
advanced
search
feature with limitations to ‘family practice’ for clinical
specialty; ‘middle age (45––64 years)’ for age of target
population; and ‘counselling’, ‘risk assessment’, ‘preven-
tion’ or ‘screening’ for guideline category.
One of us (CBV) screened the retrieved guidelines
and selected the most recent guidelines dedicated to
the management of each condition, their combination
and
prevention
services.
We
excluded
guidelines
related to a specific setting (eg, Wisconsin guidelines)
or population (eg, children, pregnancy), management
of
disease
complications
only
(eg,
acute
coronary
syndromes) or specific severity of disease (eg, manage-
ment
of
microvascular
complications
of
diabetes
mellitus).
We retrieved the full text of all selected guidelines.
Extraction of HRAs
For each guideline, two reviewers (CBV and CB) inde-
pendently extracted all HRAs that were moderately and
strongly recommended for the management of the
profile of patients defined previously with a moderate
severe condition (appendix 1). According to the classifi-
cation used in the NGC library, recommendations that
mentioned a high quality of evidence were considered
strongly recommended and recommendations that men-
tioned a moderate quality of evidence were considered
moderately recommended. Any disagreements were dis-
cussed until consensus was reached. The agreement
between the two reviewers was 73%. These HRAs were
classified by two investigators (CBV and IB) under the
following categories and we systematically recorded the
following information:
1. Pharmacological
treatments:
we
recorded
the
pharmacological class, route of administration, dur-
ation, frequency and dose per day, and drugs contra-
indicated; when several pharmacological treatments
were proposed, we selected the treatment that pro-
vided the fewest burdens.

 2. Supervised
interventions
such
as
exercise
pro-
gramme, counselling, self-management programme:
we recorded the duration and frequency of the
intervention.
3. Unsupervised behavioural interventions such as phys-
ical activity and diet.
4. Monitoring and follow-up recommended (ie, visit to
health caregivers, complementary examinations, self-
monitoring such as home-monitoring blood pres-
sure): we recorded the frequency of the monitoring
and follow-up recommended.
When a guideline provided recommendations on the
management of the combination of different chronic
conditions of interest, we recorded the HRA accordingly.
When the intervention or the HRA was not sufficiently
described in the guidelines, we searched for original
publications describing the intervention in terms of dur-
ation and frequency. For this purpose, we retrieved all
articles describing the intervention referenced in the
guidelines. If none were referenced or if the retrieved
articles did not provide sufficient information on the
intervention, we searched the Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews for systematic reviews dedicated to
this
intervention.
When
several
interventions
were
described, we recorded the frequency and duration that
was proposed most frequently or that provided the
fewest burdens.
Treatments for acute exacerbation or intercurrent
abnormalities and initial management of disease (eg,
cardiac rehabilitation in CHD) were not considered.
Time spent on each recommended HRA
We searched the literature for studies providing an esti-
mation of the time spent on HRAs and extracted the
mean (SD) time spent for the different HRAs. If
needed, we used formulas provided by Pudar Hozo15 to
estimate the mean (SD) from the median, range and
sample size. HRAs for which no estimation of their
workload could be retrieved in the literature were not
considered.
Simulation modelling approach of the potential workload
for patients with several concomitant chronic conditions
We used a simulation modelling approach to estimate
the potential workload for patients with multiple condi-
tions. When the same type of HRA was recommended,
we retained the HRA that recommended the greatest
amount of time. We considered that visits to health care-
givers were specific for each condition and that several
blood tests could be performed in one visit.
We also systematically checked whether any HRA
recommended for one chronic condition was not con-
traindicated for the associated chronic condition. The
potential workload was expressed in terms of number of
medications per day, number of visits to a health care-
giver per month and time spent on HRAs in hours per
month. We performed simulations to estimate the poten-
tial workload for a patient with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6
concomitant conditions and in terms of overall time
spent on HRAs in hours per month. We assumed skewed
distributions of time for each HRA and hypothesised
that time was a random variable with lognormal distribu-
tion. We used the parameters (mean, SD) for activities
found by the literature review for data generation. We
generated
1000
independent
observations
for each
HRA, then added simulated observations to estimate the
mean (SD) time spent for each patient multimorbidity
profile and globally. Simulations involved use of SAS
V.9.3 (SAS Inst, Cary, North Carolina, USA).
RESULTS
Identification of clinical practice guidelines
Our search strategy identified six clinical practice guide-
lines, one for each selected condition, as well as one for
smoking cessation, one for overweight, one for preven-
tion and one for vaccination (appendix 2). We did not
identify any clinical practice guidelines specifically dedi-
cated to the management of the combination of the
selected chronic conditions. However, all guidelines pro-
vided recommendations on the management of one
potential concomitant conditions (appendix 3). For
example, in the guideline dedicated to management of
hypertension, recommendations are available for the fol-
lowing concomitant conditions: chronic kidney disease,
coronary artery disease or left ventricular hypertrophy,
chronic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, depression and
cardiovascular disease.
Extraction of HRAs
From these guidelines, we extracted 5 moderately and
51 strongly recommended HRAs (table 1, see online
supplementary appendices 3 and 4). We recorded 8
HRAs for managing hypertension, 12 for diabetes, 13
for CHD, 7 for COPD, 6 for knee osteoarthritis, 4 for
depression and 2 each for prevention, tobacco use and
overweight. These HRAs consisted of pharmacological
treatment (from 1 to 5 HRAs per condition), supervised
intervention
(from
1
to
2
HRAs
per
condition),
unsupervised intervention (from 1 to 3 HRAs per condi-
tion) and monitoring and follow-up (from 1 to 4 HRAs
per condition). Management of CHD involved the
highest number of HRAs (n=13).
Time spent on each recommended HRA
From the literature review,16–18 we estimated that the
mean (SD) time spent taking medication was 2.0 (1.8)
min, following a diet 49.4 (47.2) min, home monitoring
5.0 (2.8) min (eg, blood pressure or blood sugar), for
physical activities 38.6 (44.7) min and for attending
appointments 125.0 (111.0) min. No data were obtained
on the workload for going to the drugstore and applying
thermal agents to a painful joint for osteoarthritis.
Consequently, we excluded these HRAs from further
analysis. For supervised intervention sessions with no
duration reported in the guidelines and for injections

 (immunisations or intra-articular corticosteroid injec-
tions), we considered that the duration was equivalent to
the mean (SD) time spent for one appointment (ie,
125.0 (111.0) min).
Potential workload for patients with several concomitant
chronic conditions
Table 2 and online supplementary appendix 5 describe
the workload in terms of number of medications per
days, number of visits per months and time spent per
month for patients with one to six chronic conditions.
Depending on the concomitant chronic conditions,
patients with 3 chronic conditions complying with all
the guidelines would have to take a minimum of 6 to a
maximum of 13 medications per day, visit a health care-
giver a minimum of 1.2 to a maximum of 5.9 times per
month and spend a mean (SD) of 49.6 (27.3) to 71.0
(34.5) h per month on HRAs (appendix 5). Figures 1
and 2 represent the time spent by patients in HRAs
(hours
per
month)
by
activity
and
multimorbidity
profile. For example, a patient with hypertension, osteo-
arthritis and diabetes could spend a mean (SD) of 56.6
(29.2) h per month on HRAs, with 11.9 (10.2) h on
pharmacological treatment, 38.5 (26.7) h on behavioural
intervention, 0.7 (0.6) h on supervised intervention
including education, and 5.5 (2.4) h on self-monitoring
and follow-up. In this example, behavioural interven-
tions included time dedicated to diet
(25.0 h per
month) and to physical activity (13.9 h per month),
both
recommended
for
these
three
conditions.
Coronary heart disease could require the most time
needed among the 6 selected chronic conditions, 59.2
(35.5) h per month, whereas depression could only
require 11.3 (8.9) h per month.
Behavioural interventions could require the most time
per month among all HRAs, from 54.9% of the total
time needed for a patient with the 6 selected conditions
to 94.6% for a patient with only COPD. The most time
needed for behavioural interventions should be for a
patient with coronary heart disease (44.7 (34.4) h per
month), whereas the time needed for a patient with
depression could only require 7.9 (8.8) h per month.
With the increased number of the 6 selected chronic
conditions, time required for pharmacological treatment
increased, from 3.3% of the total time needed for a
patient with COPD to 24.1% for a patient with the 6
selected chronic conditions, whereas the proportion of
time dedicated to supervised interventions and monitor-
ing and follow-up remained stable.
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study asses-
sing the potential workload of applying clinical practice
guidelines for patients with multimorbidity in terms of
time, number of medications and number of visits,
focusing on the six prevalent chronic conditions in
primary care. According to the guidelines, patients with

 3 chronic conditions need to take from 6 to 13 medica-
tions per day, visit a health caregiver 1.2 to 5.9 times per
month and spend a mean of 49.6–71.0 h per month on
HRAs. The potential workload increased greatly with
increasing number of conditions, rising to 18 medica-
tions per day, 6.6 visits per month and 80.7 h per month
for
HRAs
for
patients
with
6
chronic
conditions.
Knowing that, in the USA, the mean working time is
131 h per month and that the mean time dedicated to
caring for and helping household members is 16 h per
month,19 the potential time dedicated to HRAs would
be onerous for these patients.
Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies;
important differences in results
Consequences of the workload on patients’ quality of
life define the burden of treatment. This emerging
concept is receiving increasing attention.12 20 Previous
studies estimating the workload for patients focused on
a given chronic condition such as diabetes.13 Other
studies mainly explored the time actually spent by
patients in HRAs and not the time they would spend if
they strictly followed the moderate and strong recom-
mendations of clinical practice guidelines. In a large
survey, multimorbid patients with at least 2 chronic con-
ditions declared spending a median of 5.2 to 16.5 h per
month in HRAs.21 Our results are supported by other
research on this topic showing that the application of
current evidence-based guidelines for patients with mul-
timorbidity is limited.10 22–24
Our study has several strengths. First, we systematically
identified all existing guidelines, and two independent
reviewers extracted all HRAs from these guidelines.
Second, the workload of applying clinical practice guide-
lines for multimorbid patients in terms of time spent was
estimated from a review of the literature and simulations.
However, our study also has some limitations. First, our
model considered only part of the burden of treatment.
In fact, according to Gallacher et al,25 from normalisation
process theory, the treatment burden for patients with
multimorbidity includes the work needed to understand
treatments, interact with others to organise care, attend
appointments,
take
medications,
alter
lifestyle
and
appraise treatments.In our model, we did not take into
account all these factors. Furthermore, we were not able
to take into account the burden of the stress and discom-
fort resulting from following the guidelines, or adverse
effects (eg, dizziness or fatigue from antihypertensives or
hypoglycaemia from hypoglycaemic agents). Second, the
time estimations are probably underestimated. Indeed, if
time spent attending appointments includes the time
needed to go to the medical centre and some of the
waiting time, we may not have completely accounted for
the additional time related to the completion of forms,
difficulties with access and parking, time to buy medica-
tion and other activities. Diagnostic services are also
under-represented in this model because we did not con-
sider the time dedicated to the initial management of
the condition or treatment of acute exacerbation or an
intercurrent abnormality. Finally, the time might vary
according to healthcare systems. For example, the lack of
a single-payer system in the USA may increase the
burden related to the large amount of administrative
work needed to seek and obtain care for the patient.
Furthermore, we accumulated times for each HRA
without considering the possible interactions between
HRAs (eg, 2 appointments in one) or between the con-
dition and HRAs (eg, possible difficulties for a patient
with knee osteoarthritis to go to an appointment).
Finally, we focused on one age group (45–64 years) and
six prevalent chronic conditions, so we cannot extrapo-
late our results to all patient profiles. In addition,
because we used US guidelines, our results may not be
generalisable to all countries and to all healthcare
systems. However, the results are not likely to vary greatly.
Implications for clinicians and policymakers
Chronic conditions and multimorbidity are becoming
the greatest epidemic in high-income countries. More
than one-quarter of all adults have multiple chronic con-
ditions,26 and nearly one-third of patients with multimor-
bidity are from 45 to 64 years old6 and have an average
of three chronic conditions.9 Our findings highlight that
existing clinical practice guidelines are not appropriate
for managing multimorbidity. Complete adherence to
these guidelines considering the workload involved for
patients is not realistic.27 This workload will inevitably
induce poor adherence, wasted resources and poor out-
comes. We need a paradigm shift in planning research
and elaborating clinical practice guidelines. We should

 move from the current ‘single-condition’ approach to
developing clinical practice guidelines toward a patient-
centred approach.28 29 Specific guidelines for all situa-
tions are probably not realistic. In fact, 57 different clin-
ical practice guidelines would be required for the 6
chronic conditions we selected. In a patient-centred
approach, guidelines would take into account patient
choices and preferences, involving them in research or
guideline elaboration.30 This approach would consider
the burden of treatment12 31 and promote minimally
disruptive medicine.20 For example, in the UK, the
National
Institute
for
health
and
Care
Excellence
(NICE) was asked to develop a clinical practice guide-
line on multimorbidity to define prioritisation and man-
agement
of
care
for
these
patients.
Finally,
more
research is needed to explore how to prioritise the
recommendations from different clinical practice guide-
lines to patients’ management.
In conclusion, we assessed the HRA workload needed
to apply clinical practice guidelines for patients with

load needed to follow the guidelines rapidly increased
with increasing number of comorbidities. A new para-
digm shift is needed to manage patients with multimor-
bidity to be less burdensome and more attainable.
