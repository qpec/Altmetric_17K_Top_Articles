IMPORTANCE Clinicians often risk stratify young febrile infants for invasive bacterial infections
(IBIs), defined as bacteremia and/or bacterial meningitis, using complete blood cell count
parameters.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the accuracy of individual complete blood cell count parameters to
identify febrile infants with IBIs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Planned secondary analysis of a prospective
observational cohort study comprising 26 emergency departments in the Pediatric
Emergency Care Applied Research Network from 2008 to 2013. We included febrile (�38°C),
previously healthy, full-term infants younger than 60 days for whom blood cultures were
obtained. All infants had either cerebrospinal fluid cultures or 7-day follow-up.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We tested the accuracy of the white blood cell count,
absolute neutrophil count, and platelet count at commonly used thresholds for IBIs. We
determined optimal thresholds using receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS Of 4313 enrolled infants, 1340 (31%; 95% CI, 30% to 32%) were aged 0 to 28 days,
2412 were boys (56%), and 2471 were white (57%). Ninety-seven (2.2%; 95% CI, 1.8% to
2.7%) had IBIs. Sensitivities were low for common complete blood cell count parameter
thresholds: white blood cell count less than 5000/μL, 10% (95% CI, 4% to 16%) (to convert
to 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001); white blood cell count �15 000/μL, 27% (95% CI, 18% to
36%); absolute neutrophil count �10 000/μL, 18% (95% CI, 10% to 25%) (to convert to
× 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001); and platelets <100 × 103/μL, 7% (95% CI, 2% to 12%) (to
convert to × 109 per liter, multiply by 1). Optimal thresholds for white blood cell count
(11 600/μL), absolute neutrophil count (4100/μL), and platelet count (362 × 103/μL) were
identified in models that had areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.57
(95% CI, 0.50-0.63), 0.70 (95% CI, 0.64-0.76), and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.55-0.67), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE No complete blood cell count parameter at commonly used
or optimal thresholds identified febrile infants 60 days or younger with IBIs with high
accuracy. Better diagnostic tools are needed to risk stratify young febrile infants for IBIs.

ebrile infants 60 days and younger are routinely evalu-
ated in emergency departments (ED) for serious bacte-
rial infections including urinary tract infections (UTIs),
bacteremia, and bacterial meningitis.1 Urinary tract infec-
tions are common bacterial infections2,3 and the urinalysis is
a highly sensitive, noninvasive, readily available, rapid turn-
aroundtesttofacilitatediagnosis.4,5Althoughnovelserumbio-
markers are being evaluated to aid the clinician to reliably de-
tect the presence of invasive bacterial infections (IBIs, defined
by bacteremia or bacterial meningitis),6-9 the lack of reliable
physical examination findings and nonspecific symptoms add
to the diagnostic uncertainty for IBI.3
Several algorithms and guidelines have been used to help
risk stratify young febrile infants for IBIs.10-12 These algo-
rithms were developed prior to the introduction of the pneu-
mococcal conjugate vaccines, although this vaccine predomi-
nantly affects older infants. In addition, screening of pregnant
women for group B streptococcus and provision of intrapar-
tum antibiotic chemoprophylaxis has led to IBI becoming less
common in the well-appearing febrile young infant,13,14 mak-
ingriskstratificationevenmorechallenging.Whilethereissub-
stantial variation in the laboratory evaluation of young fe-
brile infants,15,16 the most commonly obtained test is the
complete blood cell count (CBC). Smaller studies have dem-
onstratedsuboptimalperformancecharacteristicsofCBCpara-
meters including the peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count
and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) for IBI.17-22 However, this
needs further validation in larger prospective cohorts of young
febrile infants. Serum inflammatory markers, such as procal-
citonin and C-reactive protein, can more accurately predict
which young infants have IBIs.6,7,19 However, these newer bio-
markers are still being validated and are not readily available
in all EDs.23-26 Therefore, the ease and tradition of obtaining
CBCs has led clinicians to continue to use CBC parameters in
algorithms to help risk stratify young febrile infants.
Given the changing epidemiology of IBIs, we conducted a
prospective study in which we enrolled a large, geographi-
cally diverse cohort of febrile infants and conducted a planned
subanalysis to determine the performance of the CBC to iden-
tify febrile infants 60 days and younger with IBIs.

Study Definitions
We defined bacteremia and bacterial meningitis as growth of
a single pathogen in blood and CSF cultures, respectively.
Organisms classified a priori as contaminants included
Bacillus non-cereus/non-anthracis, diphtheroids,
Lactobacillus, Micrococcus, coagulase-negative staphylo-
cocci, and viridans group streptococci.
We defined leukocytosis as a WBC count 15 000 cells/μL
or greater and leukopenia as a WBC count less than 5000
cells/μL (to convert to × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001). Neu-
trophilia was defined as an ANC greater than 10 000 cells/μL
(to convert to × 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001). These thresh-
oldswerechosenaprioribecausethesearethethresholdsused
by several existing algorithms to risk stratify young febrile
infants.10-12,27 Thrombocytosis was defined as a platelet count
450 × 103 cells/μL or greater (to convert to × 109 per liter, mul-
tiply by 1). Thrombocytopenia was evaluated at 2 different
platelet count thresholds: less than 100 × 103 cells/μL and less
than 150 × 103 cells/μL.28 Band counts were not routinely
available and therefore were not analyzed.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measures were the test characteristics
of the WBC count, ANC, and platelet count to identify infants
with IBIs.
Key Points
Question What is the accuracy of complete blood count
parameters at routinely used thresholds in identifying young
febrile infants with bacteremia or bacterial meningitis in the
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era?
Findings In this cohort of 4313 febrile infants aged 0 to 60 days,
97 (2.2%) had bacteremia or bacterial meningitis. Sensitivities
were low for white blood cell counts less than 5000/μL
(sensitivity, 10%; specificity, 91%), white blood cell count
�15 000/μL (sensitivity, 27%; specificity, 87%), and absolute
neutrophil count �10 000/μL (sensitivity, 18%; specificity, 96%).
Meaning No complete blood cell count parameter at routinely
used thresholds in isolation identified infants with bacteremia or
bacterial meningitis with sufficient accuracy to substantially assist
clinical decision making.

 Statistical Analyses
We summarized categorical variables with counts and
percentages and continuous measures with medians,
interquartile ranges (IQRs), means, and standard deviations.
For each CBC parameter analyzed, we reported sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predic-
tive value for the commonly used thresholds. We also
analyzed likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals.
We constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves and determined an optimal cutoff value for each
CBC parameter through minimizing the sensitivity, specific-
ity coordinate pair from the point (1,1), also known as
the Euclidean method.29,30 We calculated areas under the
ROC curves (AUC), and based on prior work, we defined
AUCs of less than 0.7 as having poor discriminatory value;
AUCs of 0.7 to 0.8 as minimally accurate; AUCs of 0.8
to 0.9 as having good accuracy; and AUCs of greater
than 0.9 as having excellent accuracy.17 We used SAS,
version 9.4 software (SAS Institute) for analyses.
P values less than .05 were considered significant, and
all tests were 2-sided.
Results
Study Population
Of the 4795 infants included in the main study, 4313 (90.7%)
met inclusion criteria for this analysis (eFigure in the
Supplement). Lumbar punctures were attempted in 3384
infants (78.5%) and were successful in 3324 (98.2%). The
demographic characteristics of the study population are
described in Table 1. The median age was 38 days (IQR,
25-48 days).
Invasive Bacterial Infections
Ninety-seven infants (2.2%; 95% CI, 1.8% to 2.7%) had IBIs; 73
of 4313 (1.7%; 95% CI, 1.4% to 2.1%) with isolated bacteremia
and 24 (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.4% to 0.8%) with bacterial meningi-
tis. Of the 24 infants with meningitis, 11 also had documented
bacteremia. Invasive bacterial infections were identified in 57
of 1340 infants 28 days and younger (4.3%; 95% CI, 3.2% to
5.3%) and in 40 of 2973 infants aged 29 to 60 days (1.4%; 95%
CI, 1.0% to 1.8%). Pathogens isolated are listed in Table 2.
Accuracy of CBC Parameters in Identifying Infants With IBIs
NoCBCparametersreliablydistinguishedbetweeninfantswith
and without IBIs (Table 3). While children with IBIs did have
higherWBCcounts,ANCs,andlowerplateletcounts,therewas
not a threshold for these parameters at which IBI could be re-
liably predicted (Figure). The test characteristics of CBC para-
meters at various commonly used thresholds and optimal
thresholds are presented in Table 4. Even at the optimal ANC
thresholdof4100cells/μL,one-thirdofinfantswithIBIswould
have been missed. All CBC parameters had low sensitivity and
high negative predictive values at commonly used thresh-
olds. Low positive predictive values were in part owing to the
low prevalence of IBIs. Using widely accepted normal ranges
forWBCcounts(5000to14 900cells/μL)oranANCoflessthan
10 × 103 cells/μL would have missed 61 (63%) and 80 (82%)
of infants with IBIs, respectively.
We constructed ROC curves for each individual labora-
tory predictor variable for infants aged 0 to 28 days and in-
fants aged 29 to 60 days separately (Figure). Complete blood
cell count test characteristics were not improved when only
infants older than 28 days were considered. No single CBC pa-
rameter at any threshold had both good sensitivity and good
specificity. The WBC count, ANC, and platelet count each had
poor discriminatory value.

 Discussion
Our analysis of a large, prospectively enrolled, geographi-
callydiversecohortoffebrileinfants60daysandyoungerlikely
represents the epidemiology of the bacterial pathogens re-
sponsible for bacteremia and bacterial meningitis. Of greater
importance, our findings demonstrate that individual para-
meters of the CBC have poor discriminatory ability in identi-
fying which young febrile infants have IBIs.
A minority of infants with IBIs had abnormal WBC counts.
This finding is consistent with other studies evaluating young
febrileinfants,whereperipheralleukocytosiswasseeninfewer
than one-half of infants with bacteremia and in a minority of
infants with bacterial meningitis.31,32 We also evaluated the
ability of the platelet count to identify infants with IBIs be-
cause platelets are an acute-phase reactant, and few data ex-
ist on the accuracy of platelet counts in risk stratifying young
infants for IBIs.33 However, neither thrombocytosis nor throm-
bocytopenia, as can be seen with overwhelming infections,
were sufficiently accurate. While we would expect the posi-
tive predictive value to decline and the negative predictive
value to increase as the prevalence of bacteremia and bacte-
rial meningitis decline, sensitivity and specificity of the CBC
parameters should not be influenced by declining prevalence
rates. One possible explanation for the CBC’
s poor perfor-
mance is the change of pathogens causing bacterial meningi-
tis and bacteremia in young infants. In the pre–pneumococ-
cal conjugate vaccine era, leukocytosis was commonly seen
in older infants with Haemophilus and pneumococcal
bacteremia.34,35 However, pathogens more commonly iden-
tified in the modern era may produce less of an inflammatory
response by the host. A 2015 retrospective study of episodes
of bacteremia in previously healthy febrile infants 90 days and
younger receiving care in 17 children’
s hospitals found that
Escherichia coli, group B streptococcus, and Staphylococcus
aureus were among the most common bacteria isolated,36 and
thatEcoliandgroupBstreptococcusaccountedforalmosttwo-
thirds of bacterial meningitis cases in infants aged 0 to 90
days.37 E coli bacteremia is less likely to be associated with pe-
ripheral leukocytosis than pneumococcal bacteremia in in-
fants and toddlers,38-40 and 1 study of infants with late-onset
group B streptococcus bacteremia found that only 45% had
abnormal WBC counts.40,41
Another possible explanation for why CBC parameters
poorly identified infants with IBIs is that infants in our cohort
may have presented earlier in the natural histories of their in-
fectionsthaninpreviousstudies.In2001,investigators42com-
pared parental perceptions of childhood fever with a previ-
ous study conducted in 198043 and found that in the more
contemporary era, parents were more apt to check their chil-
dren’
s temperatures more often, worry more about seizures
as a complication of pyrexia, have bloodwork performed on
their children during febrile illnesses, and seek care in an ED.
These concerns regarding fever may well translate into seek-
ing care earlier in the course of an infant’
s illness. One 2016
study2 found that no single CBC or inflammatory parameter
or combination of parameters had optimal sensitivity for iden-
tifying infants with IBIs who had pyrexia of short durations.2
Additionally, in this study, CBCs were evaluated at one point,
and the parameters may have been more accurate had CBCs
been obtained later into an infant’
s illness.
Complete blood cell count parameters also had subopti-
mal specificity for identifying infants with IBIs in our cohort.
While most febrile neonates are hospitalized and adminis-
tered empirical parenteral antibiotics while awaiting culture
results, accurate identification of low-risk infants in the sec-
ondmonthoflifewouldenablereductioninresourceuse,costs
to families, and unnecessary antibiotic exposure. However,
given the low incidence of IBIs, most abnormal CBC results will
not be associated with the presence of IBI. Our data add to pre-
vious literature on the poor accuracy of CBCs in identifying
youngfebrileinfantswithIBIs17-22andquestionshowCBCpara-
meters, particularly the ANC, may be integrated into newer
guidelines. Rather than using CBC parameters in isolation, an
approach that combines certain CBC parameters (ie, the ANC)
with other laboratory tests, such as the urinalysis, procalcito-
nin, and/or C-reactive protein (when available), may help risk
stratify these febrile infants more effectively.2
Recognition that CBC parameters in isolation have poor
ability to discriminate young febrile infants with and without
IBIs has important implications for ED practice. Some hospi-
tal algorithms recommend only sending blood cultures in fe-
brile infants if the WBC or ANC parameters are abnormal. The
rationale is to decrease the frequency of blood culture con-
tamination, which has historically been noted in 2% to 11% of
blood cultures obtained from children in the ED.44-46 How-
ever, this practice would also miss most young febrile infants

in terms of cultures obtained in young febrile infants, finding
that even among 0- to 28-day-old neonates, fewer than two-
thirds to three-quarters have blood, urine, and CSF cultures
obtained.15,16 Another belief is that most infants with bacte-
rial meningitis will have concomitant bacteremia and will thus
have positive blood cultures even if CSF is not obtained at the
time of the initial visit. While this was true for Haemophilus

Limitations
This study has some limitations. Data were collected from a
convenience sample of febrile infants evaluated in the EDs of
large academic children’
s hospitals, and the results may thus
not be generalizable to community EDs. However, the fre-
quency of bacteremia and meningitis were similar to that de-
scribed in previously published studies,31,32,39,40,48,49 and we
do not have a biological hypothesis why the accuracy of the
CBC would be different in different settings. Critically ill-
appearinginfantswerenotenrolledinthisstudy,possiblylead-
ing to spectrum bias. However, most risk-stratification tools
aim to identify infants at low risk for IBI, not those at high risk,
and critical appearance is more important than any labora-
tory value for identifying those at high risk. There are some
data on the utility of band counts in predicting bacteremia in
thisagegroup,50butwewereunabletoassesstheutilityofrela-
tive or absolute bandemia for identifying those with IBIs given
variation in band count availability across study EDs. Bacte-
rial cultures were considered the reference standard for analy-
ses, despite recognition that falsely negative cultures51 can oc-
cur owing to sporadic bacteremia or if low blood volumes are
inoculated into blood culture bottles. One 2017 study found
that for each additional 1 mL of blood culture volume col-
lected, microbial yield increased by 0.5% in children with
pneumonia.52
Conclusions
Complete blood cell count parameters had poor accuracy in
distinguishing febrile infants 60 days and younger with and
without invasive bacterial infections in the postpneumococ-
cal conjugate vaccine era, although the ANC had the highest
sensitivity. Physicians who use CBC thresholds in an attempt
to risk stratify febrile young infants may be falsely reassured
by normal CBC parameters. When used in isolation, either at
commonly used thresholds or at the optimal thresholds iden-
tified here, CBC parameters have at best modest discrimina-
tory ability. In an era where better screening tests exist to iden-
tify infants with IBIs, we need to question our continual
reliance on a test whose greatest strength may simply be in its
ready availability in clinical practice.
