improving behaviour for better oral health

Twelve years ago, FDI World Dental Federation and Unilever Oral Care began a partnership to raise awareness of oral
health globally. This aim reflects FDI’s mission to “lead the world to optimal oral health”, and one of the goals set by
the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan “to improve health and well-being for more than 1 billion” by 2020. This partner-
ship has developed a series of public health programmes to improve the brushing habits of targeted populations through
health promotion and educational campaigns worldwide. Building on the success of the first two phases of the partner-
ship, the third phase (Phase III), named Brush Day & Night, aimed to educate children in brushing twice-daily with fluo-
ride toothpaste via a 21 Day school programme. This article reports the main outcomes of the past 12 years of this
partnership, in particular the key outreach and figures of Phase III evaluation. School programmes were implemented in
10 countries, where local teams collected data from children aged between 2 and 12 years to monitor their oral health
behaviours using specific indicators. In addition to the school programme, the World Oral Health Day was used as a
vehicle to convey oral health awareness to influential governing bodies and the public. As a result, over 4 million people
were directly reached by the programme in 2016.

INTRODUCTION
Tooth decay affected almost half of the world popu-
lation in 20101, and the World Health Organization
(WHO) reports that dental cavities affect 60–90% of
school children and almost 100% of adults globally2.
Nevertheless, oral disease and, in particular, dental
caries are preventable3–6. The FDI World Dental
Federation (FDI), representing over 1 million dentists
worldwide in more than 130 countries, is at the
forefront
of
meeting
this
challenge.
One
of
the
cornerstone strategies set out in FDI’s Vision 2020 is
to
secure
political
commitments
and
policy
approaches that integrate oral health and general
health into actionable programmes to improve oral
health literacy through population-based preventive
interventions.
FDI is committed to taking a leadership role in this
process, working with its member associations, dental
practitioners, fellow international health organizations
and industry partners to advocate for the recognition
of good oral health not as a privilege, but as a funda-
mental human right3–5,7.
There is a consensus among the constituent FDI
members on the key public health measures required
to maintain lifelong oral health and contribute to
improved quality of life and well-being1,8,9. In partic-
ular, FDI encourages governments to develop grass-
roots preventive measures in community settings, such
as schools8, and individuals to prevent dental caries
by brushing regularly with fluoride toothpaste to
remove the oral biofilm8.
A critical element of FDI’s mission to “lead the
world to optimal oral health” is therefore finding
innovative ways to support and collaborate with our
member National Dental Associations (NDAs) and
industry partners to create impactful public health
programmes
and
public–private
partnerships.
This
aim resonates with one of the ambitious goals set by
the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan “to improve
health and well-being for more than 1 billion” by
202010.

 Driven by their shared aspirations, FDI and Unilever
joined forces in 2005 to form the Live.Learn.Laugh.
(LLL) partnership, which subsequently became the
Brush Day & Night (BDN) partnership when its third
phase (Phase III) was launched in 201411–18. The arti-
cles included in this supplement present a detailed
overview of the oral health activities, in particular the
school programmes, conducted during BDN Phase III.
Those articles also report the impact of the partner-
ship on the oral health of the target populations after
3 years.
12 YEARS OF ORAL HEALTH PROGRAMMES TO
IMPROVE GLOBAL ORAL HEALTH
For the past 12 years, the FDI–Unilever partnership
has been governed at the global and local levels as a
functional organizational structure, with the FDI and
Unilever leaderships forming a decision-making body,
and defining the aim, objectives and strategy of the
partnership13,15. This governing body selects a core
team to implement the partnership activities and to
ensure back and forth communication between all
stakeholders. The core team collaborates with experts
from the FDI Public Health Committee, who develop
a standard methodology of intervention and collection
of data, and provide expert coaching to the local
teams of dentists and volunteers conducting these
interventions15.
The FDI–Unilever partnership was first established
in 2004, and publicly launched in 2005 as ‘Live.-
Learn.Laugh.’ (LLL), during the FDI Annual World
Dental Congress in Montreal. The first phase ran
until 2009 with an overall outreach estimated to be
over 1 million people worldwide12,13 (Figure 1). This
pioneering phase aimed to enable NDAs to raise
awareness
of
oral
health
globally
through
pro-
grammes with different project designs, consisting for
example of educating day care workers and parents
to improve oral health of infants, training dental
health
educators
to
supervise
tooth
brushing
in
schools, or organizing tooth brushing for disadvan-
taged children in various settings12. LLL Phase I
piloted the potential of such a unique public–private
partnership to improve the oral health of the target
populations. The independent evaluation of this first
phase reported and emphasized the importance of
using common indicators in a limited number of pro-
ject designs, not only to measure the intervention out-
comes, but also to allow cross-country comparison.
Additional recommendations were made, in particular
to harmonize the projects by producing common oral
health promotion and education materials, and by
organizing training workshops for the implementation
teams12.
Based
on
these
recommendations,
the
second
phase
of
the
partnership
was
implemented
from
2010 to 2013, and was restricted to four types of
project,
respectively,
focusing
on
school
children,
mothers and infants, patients and communities14–16.
The implementation and evaluation of the projects
was reinforced by providing the NDAs and dental
teams
with
standardized
protocols
and
templates
using a common core of standardized indicators,
and harmonized oral health education and promo-
tion materials for the target populations. In addition,
the project leaders from all participating countries
were invited to meet the partnership experts during
annual global workshops, in order to review the
details
of
their
projects,
plan
the
activities
and

 examine the collected datasets15. This revised strat-
egy allowed LLL to measurably improve the brush-
ing
habits
of
the
more
than
1 million
people
reached by the programme, in terms of frequency,
timing of brushing and usage of fluoride toothpaste.
Moreover, the school programme strategy was evalu-
ated as one of the most efficient project designs to
achieve such an improvement, in particular as it
offers a reliable educational setting16.
Building on the success and knowledge gained from
Phase I and II, the third phase (Phase III) of the part-
nership ran from 2014 to 2016, with two main
changes: the partnership was renamed Brush Day &
Night (BDN) to better reflect its objectives; and activi-
ties conducted on World Oral Health Day (WOHD)
were included to educate and engage not only in
schools, but also in larger communities (Table 1).
During Phase III, WOHD was used as a vehicle
to convey the educational messages of the partner-
ship to a broader audience, including policy-makers,
ministries of health and education, and the general
public.
School
programmes
were
implemented
in
10 countries to teach children to brush twice-daily
with a fluoride toothpaste and a toothbrush, and to
educate them about the benefits of having good
oral hygiene (Table 1). The local teams collected
data,
anonymously
and
at
different
time
points,
from children between 2 and 13 years old to moni-
tor oral health behaviour and status using specific
indicators.
All partnership stakeholders have been engaged
over the past 12 years in continuously evaluating and
revising the strategy of the programme, in order to
keep
improving
the
outreach,
impact
and
out-
comes12,15,16. In particular, the Phase III experts, Prof.
Frencken and Prof. Melo from the FDI Public Health
Committee, conducted an in-depth analysis of the
data collected by the different local teams to evaluate
the impact of the partnership on the oral health
knowledge and behaviour of participating school chil-
dren. The partnership is proud to report in the supple-
ment an overall outreach of 4 million in the countries
where school programmes and WOHD activities were
implemented (Figure 1; Table 1), and a 25% increase
of school children brushing twice a day following the
first intervention of the programme.
