SUMMARY
Dietary interventions have not been effective in the
treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we show
that periodic 3-day cycles of a fasting mimicking
diet (FMD) are effective in ameliorating demyelin-
ation and symptoms in a murine experimental auto-
immune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. The FMD
reduced clinical severity in all mice and completely
reversed symptoms in 20% of animals. These
improvements
were
associated
with
increased
corticosterone levels and regulatory T (Treg) cell
numbers and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, TH1 and TH17 cells, and antigen-present-
ing cells (APCs). Moreover, the FMD promoted
oligodendrocyte precursor cell regeneration and
remyelination in axons in both EAE and cuprizone
MS models, supporting its effects on both sup-
pression of autoimmunity and remyelination. We
also report preliminary data suggesting that an
FMD or a chronic ketogenic diet are safe, feasible,
and potentially effective in the treatment of re-
lapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients
(NCT01538355).
INTRODUCTION
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized
by T cell-mediated demyelination and neurodegeneration in the
CNS (Friese and Fugger, 2005; Pender and Greer, 2007; Sospedra
and Martin, 2005). In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE), an animal model for MS, activated myelin-specific TH1 and
TH17 cells cross the blood-brain barrier and migrate into the CNS,
where they are activated by local antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
and promote inflammation (Dhib-Jalbut, 2007; Fletcher et al.,
2010; Goverman, 2009; Hemmer et al., 2002). This inflammatory
process leads to oligodendrocyte death, demyelination, and
axonal damage, which eventually cause neurologic damage (Luc-
chinetti et al., 1999; Raine and Wu, 1993). Although oligodendro-
cyte precursor cells (OPCs) can migrate to the sites of MS lesions,
they often fail to differentiate into functional oligodendrocytes
(Chang et al., 2002; Wolswijk, 1998). Several MS treatment drugs
have been effective in reducing immune responses, but their
impact on long-term disease progression, accrual of irreversible
neurological disability, and immune system function remains
largely unclear, underlining the need for novel therapeutic strate-
gies (Wingerchuk and Carter, 2014). Therefore, effective treat-
ments for MS may require not only the mitigation of autoimmunity

ration of a functional myelin sheath. Periodic cycles of prolonged

 days can increase protection of multiple systems against a variety
of chemotherapy drugs in mice and possibly humans (Fontana
et al., 2010; Guevera-Aguirre et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2010; Longo
and Mattson, 2014). Moreover, PF or an FMD reverses the immu-
nosuppression or immunosenescence of either chemotherapy
or aging through hematopoietic stem cell-based regeneration
(Brandhorst et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2014). Chronic caloric re-
striction, a ketogenic diet (KD), and intermittent fasting have
been shown to help prevent EAE by reducing inflammation and
enhancing neuroprotection when administered prior to disease
induction or signs (Esquifino et al., 2007; Kafami et al., 2010; Kim
do et al., 2012; Piccio et al., 2008), but dietary interventions have
not been reported to be effective as therapies for EAE or MS or
to promote myelin regeneration.
Here, we report on the effects of low-calorie and low-protein
FMD cycles as a treatment in MS mouse models, and we inves-
tigate the mechanisms involved. Furthermore, we report prelim-
inary results on the safety and feasibility of a FMD and a KD in
patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).
RESULTS
FMD Cycles Reduce Disease Severity in the MOG35–55-
Induced EAE Model
We examined the effects of 3 cycles of a very-low-calorie and
low-protein FMD lasting 3 days every 7 days or a KD continued
for 30 days in EAE-induced by active immunization with myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35–55 (MOG35–55) (Figure 1A).

 Groups of mice were treated semi-therapeutically (EAE FMD (S),
where FMD treatment started after 10% of the immunized pop-
ulation showed signs of EAE) or therapeutically (EAE FMD (T),
where FMD treatment started after all of the immunized popula-
tion showed signs of EAE). FMD and KD treatment decreased
disease severity compared to that in the control group (Fig-
ure 1B). However, the FMD reduced the mean severity score
to �1, whereas a KD reduced the severity score to �2 at the later
stages (Figure 1B). In the EAE FMD (S) group, FMD treatment not
only delayed the onset of disease but also lowered the incidence
rate (100% versus 45.6%; Figure 1C). In the EAE FMD (T) group,
FMD cycles completely reversed the severity score to 0 in 21.7%
of the cohort (no observable signs; Figure 1D) and reduced the
severity score to <0.5 in >50% of mice (12 out of 23 mice; Fig-
ure 1E). To address whether the FMD cycles also have beneficial
effects in chronic EAE models that have established disease, we
initiated FMD treatment 2 weeks after the initial signs of EAE
were observed (EAE CTRL-FMD). Prior to treatment, the control
diet EAE group (EAE CTRL) and EAE CTRL-FMD cohorts had
similar severity scores (3.19 ± 0.52 versus 3.30 ± 0.27; day 24).
After three FMD cycles, we observed a significant reduction in
severity score in the EAE CTRL-FMD cohort compared to the
EAE CTRL cohort (3.3 ± 0.57 versus 2.1 ± 0.89; day 42; p <
0.05; Figure 1F). As infiltration of immune cells and demyelination
are histopathological hallmarks of EAE and MS, spinal cord sec-
tions from control and FMD(T) mice were stained with H&E to
visualize infiltrating immune cells (Figure 1G) or solochrome
cyanine to visualize myelin (Figure 1H). To assess demyelination
and axonal damage, immunohistochemistry was performed us-
ing antibodies against myelin basic protein (MBP) or dephos-
phorylated neurofilaments (SMI-32; Figure 1I). At day 3, levels
of infiltrating immune cells and demyelination were similar in
the EAE CTRL and EAE FMD groups (Figures 1J and S1H). At
day 14, sections of EAE CTRL mice displayed severe immune
cell infiltration corresponding to demyelinated lesions, reduced
MBP expression, and increased SMI-32 expression (Figures
1J–1M). By contrast, sections of EAE FMD mice at day 14 dis-
played significantly reduced immune cell infiltration and demye-
lination (Figures 1J–1M). Although MBP staining showed no sig-
nificant difference between EAE CTRL and EAE FMD mice at day
14 (Figure 1L), neurofilament dephosphorylation in EAE FMD
mice was reduced compared to EAE CTRL mice (Figure 1M).
Overall, these results suggest that FMD cycles reduce EAE dis-
ease severity in part by reducing inflammation and preventing
demyelination and axonal damage.
FMD Cycles Reduce Infiltration of Immune Cells in the
Spinal Cord
To investigate the capacity of FMD cycles to reduce potential
autoimmune T cells, we measured circulating white blood cells
(WBCs), lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes in naive,
EAE CTRL, EAE FMD, and EAE FMD:RF (measured 4 days after
returning to a standard ad lib diet) mice after three cycles of the
FMD regimen (Figure 2A). The FMD resulted in a temporary
40%–50% reduction in total WBCs, lymphocytes, monocytes,
and granulocytes. Upon returning to the standard ad lib diet
(EAE FMD:RF), all complete blood counts (CBCs) returned to
either naive or lower levels than those observed in the EAE
CTRL, with the exception of granulocytes, indicating that the
FMD cycles cause both WBC death and regeneration (Figure 2A).
Next, we measured the inflammatory markers associated with
EAE pathophysiology. Day 3 and day 14 spinal cord sections
of the EAE CTRL mice were extensively populated with
CD11b+ cells (Figure 2B). However, at day 14, the EAE FMD
mice displayed a 75% reduction (p < 0.05) in spinal cord-associ-
ated CD11b+ cells compared to mice on the control diet (11.7%
versus 2.8%; Figure 2B). Since myelin-specific effector T cells
migrate into the CNS and initiate demyelination, we investigated
the accumulation of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in the spinal cord.
A large number of CD4+ T cells were detected in the white matter
of spinal cord sections from the control diet cohort (Figure 2C). In
contrast, the FMD-treated cohort displayed a >4-fold reduction
(p < 0.01) in CD4+ T cells at day 3 (8.6% versus 1.5%; Figure 2C)
compared to the control diet cohort, which remained lower even
at day 14. The FMD group also had reduced CD8+ T cells (day 3:
1.3% versus 0.4%; p < 0.01; Figure 2D) compared to the control
diet group. To investigate whether the FMD affects APCs, we
isolated splenocytes from EAE CTRL and EAE FMD mice at
day 3, stained them for CD11c and F4/80, and characterized
them by flow cytometry. We observed a significant decrease
(p < 0.05) in CD11c+ dendritic cells in the EAE FMD cohort
compared to the EAE CTRL cohort (3.08% ± 0.70% versus
1.46% ± 0.31%), but we did not observe any changes in the
number of F4/80+ macrophage cells in the control or FMD-
treated groups (Figures 2E and S2B). To determine the effects
of the FMD treatment on T cell infiltration in the spinal cord, we
measured T cell activation levels. The number of CD4+ T cells
and CD8+ T cells in EAE CTRL and EAE FMD mice was similar
(Figures S2C and S2D), but the ratio of splenic naive (CD44low)
to activated (CD44high) CD4+ T cells was increased (p < 0.05) in
the FMD group compared to the control group (1.95 versus
3.67; Figure 2F). No difference in CD8+ T cells was observed (Fig-
ure S2E). Moreover, the total number of effector (CD44high and
CD62Llow) T cells was reduced in the FMD compared to the con-
trol group, but the ratio of effector (CD44high and CD62Llow) to
memory T (CD44high and CD62Lhigh) cells did not change (Fig-
ures S2F–S2H). These results indicate that FMD cycles reduce
the number of dendritic cells and increase the relative number
of naive T cells, which may explain the reduced autoimmunity
caused by the FMD.
FMD Cycles Induce Autoreactive Lymphocyte Apoptosis
and Increase the Number of Naive Cells
To determine whether FMD cycles also reduce the number of
MOG-specific antigen-reactive cells, we used a major histocom-
patibility complex (MHC) tetramer (MOG35–55/IAb) to identify
antigen-reactive cells after an FMD cycle in vivo. The number
of CD4+ MOG35–55 /IAb+ cells was reduced in the EAE FMD
cohort compared to the EAE CTRL cohort (5.75% ± 0.51%
versus 3.83% ± 0.66% of lymphocytes; * p < 0.05; Figure 2G).
To determine whether the reduced active T cell number is
due to an increase in the number of regulatory T (Treg) cells, we
isolated lymphocytes from draining lymph nodes and spleens
of EAE CTRL or EAE FMD mice and analyzed them for CD4+
CD25+ FoxP3+ Treg cells. The FMD cohort showed a 2-fold in-
crease (p < 0.01) in the number of CD25+ FoxP3+-expressing

 Treg cells (13.6% ± 4.2% versus 25.1% ± 4.2%; Figure 2H).
Moreover, the FMD cohort showed a 27.8% reduction (p <
0.05) in the number of interferon g (IFN-g)- expressing TH1 cells
(2,974.4 ± 708.0 versus 2,148.1 ± 1,396.1; Figure 2I) and a
46.5% reduction (p < 0.05) in the number of interleukin-17
(IL-17)-expressing TH17 cells (2,535.9 ± 722.0 versus 1,357.1 ±
256.2; Figure 2J), both of which are known to be central media-
tors of EAE. Interestingly, upon re-feeding of the control diet, the
EAE FMD treatment group (EAE FMD:RF) showed a 72.9%
reduction (p < 0.05) in the number of IFN-g-expressing TH1 cells
(2,974.4 ± 708.0 versus 805.8 ± 251.5; Figure 2I) and a 82.9%
reduction (p < 0.05) in the number of IL-17-expressing TH17 cells
(2,535.9 ± 722.0 versus 432.4 ± 117.4; Figure 2J), suggesting
that the FMD can prevent autoimmunity in part by reducing the
levels of pro-inflammatory T cells implicated in EAE.
In order to assess how FMD cycles may reduce the number of
T cells, we measured apoptosis in MOG-specific T cells (CD3+
MOG35–55/IAb) in vivo. We observed a significant increase (p <
0.05) in apoptotic CD3+ MOG35–55/IAb levels in the EAE FMD
cohort compared to the EAE CTRL cohort (28.3% ± 4.94%
versus 39.1% ± 4.79%; Figure 2K), which was consistent with
the major reduction in the number of WBCs and lymphocytes
observed in the FMD group (Figure 2A). To investigate whether
these apoptotic cells are replaced by newly generated cells,
we treated the mice with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) during the
re-feeding period (four injections within 48 hr, at 1 mg of BrdU
per injection). Splenocytes were isolated 4 days after the re-
feeding of the regular diet and stained for BrdU (Figure S2I).
We observed no difference in levels of total BrdU+ lymphocytes
(8.11% ± 1.99% versus 12.02% ± 2.72%; Figure S2J), but we
observed a significantly reduced proliferation of TH1 (BrdU+
CD4+IFNg+) (5.74% ± 1.07% versus 3.65% ± 0.63%; *p <
0.05; Figure 2L) and no difference in proliferation of TH17
(BrdU+CD4+IL17+) (4.71% ± 1.53% versus 5.01% ± 1.66%; Fig-
ure S2K). Taken together, these data indicate that FMD cycles
may promote apoptosis of autoreactive T cells, leading to an
increase in the proportion of naive T cells and regulatory
T cells. In addition, FMD cycles may interfere with proliferation
and differentiation of TH1 cells, but not TH17 cells. To investigate
whether the FMD’s effects on CNS infiltrating immune cells are
associated with suppression of TH1- and TH17-dependent cyto-
kine production (IL-17, IFN-g, and tumor necrosis factor a
[TNF-a]), we analyzed serum from naive, EAE CTRL, and EAE
FMD mice (Figures 2K–2M). We observed significant reductions
in serum TNF-a (113.3 ± 7.9 versus 79.3 ± 10.5 pg/ml; p < 0.001;
Figure 2M), IFN-g (558.43 ± 124.5 versus 296.0 ± 83.4 pg/ml;
p < 0.001; Figure 2N), and IL-17 (36.8 ± 9.67 versus 20.75 ±
4.2 pg/ml; p < 0.01; Figure 2O). To identify a potential mediator
for the effects of FMD cycles on the suppression of autoimmune
responses, we measured serum corticosterone levels. Cortico-
sterone is a glucocorticoid hormone with broad anti-inflamma-
tory and immunosuppressive effects affecting leukocyte dis-
tribution, trafficking, and death (Ashwell et al., 2000; Herold
et al., 2006; Planey and Litwack, 2000; Vegiopoulos and Herzig,
2007). Serum corticosterone levels were elevated in association
with the first signs of EAE (EAE day 1, before treatment) (data not
shown). FMD treatment caused a further increase in corticoste-
rone levels at day 3 compared to those of controls (245.9 ± 38.8
versus 375.0 ± 94.1 ng/ml; p < 0.01), which returned to EAE basal
levels by day 14 in both groups (Figure 2P). These results indi-
cate that FMD cycles reduce the number of TH1 and TH17
effector cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
These effects of the FMD may be regulated in part by the tempo-
rary elevation of corticosterone levels, dampening of T cell acti-
vation, and reduced APC and T cell infiltration in the spinal cord.
FMD Reverses EAE Symptoms by Reducing the Level
and Reactivity of Established Autoimmune Cells
To determine how the FMD affects the initiation of EAE, spleno-
cytes were isolated from EAE CTRL and EAE FMD mice, re-acti-
vated with MOG35–55 peptide and IL-23 ex vivo, and transferred
into naive recipient mice to induce EAE. The mice were then sub-
jected to either a control diet or FMD cycles (Figure 3A). The
supernatant from ex vivo splenocyte cultures derived from
EAE FMD mice showed no difference in TNF-a levels (110.8 ±
14.9 pg/ml versus 97.1 ± 8.4 pg/ml; Figure 3B) but a major reduc-
tion (p < 0.01) in the levels of IFN-g (342.0 ± 29.8 pg/ml versus 46.6
± 16.6 pg/ml Figure 3C) and IL-17 (850.5 ± 442.0 pg/ml versus
257.4 ± 36.4 pg/ml;Figure 3D). Interestingly, uponinvitro reactiva-
tion, both EAE CTRL and EAE FMD had similar levels of TH1 and
TH17 differentiated cells (Figures 3E and 3F). To determine
whether the immune cells from EAE CTRL and EAE FMD mice

occurred normally in the EAE CTRL and
EAE FMD groups, but the FMD can reduce
the level of the existing autoimmunity.
FMD Cycles Stimulate
Remyelination by Promoting
Oligodendrocyte Regeneration
To investigate whether the reduced demy-
elination in FMD mice may also be related
to enhanced oligodendrocyte regenera-
tion, we first carried out a quantitative im-
age analysis of NG2+ (an oligodendrocyte
progenitor cell [OPC] marker) and GST-
p+ (a mature oligodendrocyte marker) in
spinal cord sections from control or FMD
mice (Figure 4A). We observed no differ-
ence in the number of NG2+ OPCs in sec-
tions taken from EAE CTRL and EAE FMD
mice (Figure S3A). However, at day 14, the
number of GST-p+ oligodendrocytes was
reduced in the EAE CTRL group, but not in the EAE FMD group

of mature oligodendrocytes in the EAE FMD group were due to
enhanced regeneration and/or differentiation, EAE CTRL or EAE
FMD mice were injected with BrdU at the time of re-feeding
(day 10). We observed a major increase (p < 0.01) in the percent-
age of cells that are double positive for BrdU+ and GST-p+ in the
EAE FMD group compared to the EAE CTRL group (42.9% ±
11.2% versus 83.0% ± 13.2%; p < 0.01), suggesting that the
FMD promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation from precursor

 cells (Figure 4C). To assess the effects of the FMD on either OPCs
or mature oligodendrocytes, sections were stained with TUNEL,
an apoptotic marker, and GST-p+ or NG2+ (Figure 4D). We
observed a significant increase in the number of TUNEL+ NG2+
(11.2 ± 12.2 versus 1.9 ± 1.4 cells/section) and TUNEL+ GST-p+
(18.8± 15.2versus2.9± 5.3cells/section)cellsinthecontrol group
compared to the FMD group (p < 0.05; Figures 4E and 4F). Taken
together, these results indicate that the FMD not only stimulates
regeneration and differentiation of oligodendrocytes but also pro-
tects OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes from apoptosis.
To investigate whether the FMD-dependent stimulation of
oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination can occur in-
dependent of the observed effects on T cell number and activity,
we used the cuprizone-induced demyelinating mouse model
(Ransohoff, 2012; Torkildsen et al., 2008). Addition of 0.2%
(w/w) cuprizone to the regular mouse diet for 5–6 weeks results
in demyelination in the corpus callosum followed by sponta-
neous remyelination upon re-feeding with regular chow. After
5 weeks of cuprizone treatment, mice were switched to either
the control diet or FMD cycles for 5 weeks, and some were
euthanized weekly to assess the degree of myelination by Luxol
fast staining and GST-p+ (Figures 4G and 4I). As expected, after
5 weeks of the cuprizone diet, a significant reduction in myelin
staining was observed in the corpus callosum compared to the
naive controls (Figures 4H and 4J). After two cycles, the FMD-
treated group displayed increased myelin staining and an
increased number of GST-p+ oligodendrocytes compared to
the control diet group (Figures 4H and 4J). However, at later
time points, we did not observe differences in spontaneous
re-myelination between the control diet and FMD cohorts, as it
is well established that cuprizone-dependent myelin damage
can be fully reversed after removal of the toxin (Figures S3C
and S3D). These results indicate that the FMD promotes OPC-
dependent regeneration and accelerates OPC differentiation
into oligodendrocytes while enhancing remyelination indepen-
dently of its modulation of the inflammatory response.
A Randomized Pilot Trial to Test the Effects of a FMD or
KD in Relapsing-Remitting MS Patients: Evidence for
Safety and Feasibility
A randomized, parallel-group, three-arm pilottrial (NCT01538355)
was conducted to assess the safety and feasibility of FMD or KD
treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in RRMS pa-
tients. 60 patients were randomly assigned to a control diet (CD;
n = 20), KD for 6 months (n = 20), or a single cycle of a modified
human FMD for 7 days (n = 20) followed by a Mediterranean diet
for 6 months (Figure S4). Baseline characteristics were balanced
among the three groups (Tables S1 and S2). The FMD and KD co-
horts displayed clinically meaningful improvements in the HRQOL
summary scales at 3 months, which included the overall quality of
life (Figure 4K) change in health (Figure 4L), a physical health com-
posite (Figure 4M), and a mental health composite (Figure 4N).
Also, similar changes were observed in the total HRQOL scales
at different time points (Figure S5). Adverse events (AEs) and
serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported for 92% (8%) of
CD cohort individuals, 78% (16%) of FMD cohort individuals,
and 78% (11%) of KD cohort individuals (Table S5). The most
common AE was airway infection, and the most frequent SAE
was lower urinary tract infection. No indication of an increase in
liver enzymes exceeding the normal range was observed in any
of the three treatment groups. Also, the interventions were well
tolerated, as evidenced by high compliance rates (CD, 60%;
KD, 90%; and FMD, 100%). During the 6-month study period,
we observed a total of eight relapses: four in the CD group, one
in the KD group, and three in the FMD group. In addition to
increased b-hydroxybutyrate levels in plasma, we observed a
slight reduction in lymphocytes and WBC counts and detected
a mild reduction in expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores
in the FMD and KD groups (measured at baseline, month 3, and
month 6; Tables S1 and S6). Thus, there was an inverse associa-
tion between EDSS and HRQOL scores (Table S7). In MS patients
the FMD treatment lead to an over 20% drop in the total lympho-
cyte count (baseline versus day 8; Table S4) in 72% of the patients
(13 of 18 FMD-treated patients). WBC counts returned to the
baseline levels after these patients were switched to the Mediter-
ranean diet (month 3). Based on the mouse studies, these results
raise the possibility that the FMD alleviated symptoms in MS
patients by reducing the number of autoimmune lymphocytes.
Overall, our study indicates that the administration of FMD and
KD is safe, feasible, and potentially effective, but further studies,
including analyses such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
blinded clinical assessments, and immune assays, are required
to determine efficacy.
DISCUSSION
An FMD administered every week was effective in ameliorating
EAE symptoms in all mice and completely reversed disease pro-
gression in a portion of animals after the onset of EAE signs. By
contrast, the KD had more modest effects and did not reverse
EAE progression in mice. FMD cycles appear to be effective in
the treatment of EAE in mice by (1) promoting oligodendrocyte
precursor-dependent regeneration and (2) reducing the levels
of microglia/monocytes and T cells contributing to autoimmunity
and encephalomyelitis. Our results support an FMD-mediated
anti-inflammatory effect possibly involving the upregulation of
AMPK or the downregulation of mTORC1, which sense nutrient
availability and dictate cell fate (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012). It
was shown that mTORC1 couples immune signals and metabolic
programming to establish Treg cell function (Zeng et al., 2013). In
fact, treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin or the
AMPK activator metformin attenuates EAE symptoms by modu-
lating effector T cells andTreg cells and restricting the infiltration of
mononuclear cells into the CNS (Esposito et al., 2010; Nath et al.,
2009). Therefore, FMD treatment could interfere with T cell prolif-
eration and differentiation and with recruitment of other immune
cells, resulting in a decreased recruitment at lesion sites (Fig-
ure 5). Some of these effects of the FMD may be triggered by
endogenous glucocorticoid production. Glucocorticoids are
used to treat MS relapses, but they are generally administered
in short bursts, since they can cause AEs such as osteoporosis
and metabolic syndrome (Brusaferri and Candelise, 2000; Ce
et al., 2006; Roth et al., 2010; Uttner et al., 2005). The FMD may
avoid these adverse effects by promoting additional and coordi-
nated endogenous responses. Importantly, FMD cycles also acti-
vated OPCs, resulting in myelin regeneration, as demonstrated
Cell Reports 15, 2136–2146, June 7, 2016
2143
 by accelerated remyelination rate in the cuprizone model (Fig-
ure 5). Notably, because it is the alternation of FMD cycles and
re-feeding and not the FMD alone that promotes the regeneration
and replacement of autoimmune cells with naive cells, the use of
chronic restriction or even a chronic KD may not be effective, or
as effective, in the treatment of EAE and MS.
Finally, we report that the administration of the FMD and
KD in MS patients was safe and well tolerated and resulted
in high compliance. We observed positive effects of FMD cy-
cles or KD treatment in RRMS based on changes in self-re-
ported HRQOL and a mild improvement in EDSS (Table S6).
However, the lack of a proper Mediterranean diet control
makes it difficult to establish whether FMD cycles alone
are sufficient to produce these effects. In addition, MRI ana-
lyses and adequately blinded clinical assessments (EDSS
and multiple sclerosis functional composite [MSFC]), as well
as immune function analyses would greatly enhance the
strength of the clinical findings. Because, unlike for the mouse
experiments, the FMD was only administered to patients only
once, it will be important to test the effects of multiple FMD
cycles on MS patients in larger, randomized, and controlled
trials.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
EAE Model
C57Bl/6 (10-week-old female) mice were purchased from The Jackson Lab-
oratory and immunized subcutaneously with 200 mg MOG35–55 (GenScript)
mixed 1:1 with supplemented complete Freund’s adjuvant followed by
200 ng pertussis toxin (PTX; List Biological Laboratories) intraperitoneally
(i.p.) at days 0 and 2. For adoptive transfer, spleens from active immunized
mice were isolated and red blood cells (RBCs) were lysed. Spleen cells were
cultured in the presence of MOG35–55 (20 mg/ml) with rmIL-23 (20 ng/ml) for
48 hr. Cells were collected and re-suspended in PBS, and 15 million cells
were injected intravenously. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures
for a detailed description of disease severity scoring. All experiments
were performed in accordance with approved Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) protocols of the University of Southern
California.
Mouse Fasting Mimicking Diet
Mice were fed ad lib with irradiated TD.7912 rodent chow (Harlan Teklad),
containing 15.69 kJ/g digestible energy (animal-based protein 3.92 kJ/g,
carbohydrate 9.1 kJ/g, and fat 2.67 kJ/g). The experimental FMD is based
on a nutritional screen that identified ingredients that allow high nourish-
ment during periods of low calorie consumption. The FMD diet consists
of two different components, day 1 diet and day 2–3 diet, that were fed
in this order, respectively. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures
for a detailed explanation of the FMD. Mice consumed all the supplied
food on each day of the FMD regimen and showed no signs of food aver-
sion. After the end of FMD, we supplied TD.7912 chow ad lib for 4 days
before starting another FMD cycle. Prior to supplying the FMD, animals
were transferred into fresh cages to avoid feeding on residual chow and
coprophagy.
Clinical Trial Design
This study was a three-armed, parallel-group, single-center, controlled,
and randomized clinical pilot trial to assess the effects of dietary interven-
tions on HRQOL in RRMS patients. The permuted-block randomization
was generated online at http://randomization.com. An investigator blind

FMD treatment promotes endogenous glucocorticoid production, increases Treg cell numbers, blocks T cell activation, and promotes T cell death. In the lesion
area, FMD treatment reduces autoimmune T cell and microglia infiltration and promotes oligodendrocyte-precursor-dependent regeneration and differentiation
of myelinating oligodendrocytes, which engage with demyelinated axons to promote the formation of myelin sheaths.
