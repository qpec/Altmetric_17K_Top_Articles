SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune dis-
ease that involves immune-mediated destruction of
b cells. How b cells respond to immune attack is un-
known. We identified a population of b cells during
the progression of T1D in non-obese diabetic (NOD)
mice that survives immune attack. This population
develops from normal b cells confronted with islet in-
filtrates. Pathways involving cell movement, growth
and proliferation, immune responses, and cell death
and survival are activated in these cells. There is
reduced expression of b cell identity genes and
diabetes antigens and increased immune inhibitory
markers and stemness genes. This new subpopula-
tion is resistant to killing when diabetes is precipi-
tated with cyclophosphamide. Human b cells show
similar changes when cultured with immune cells.
These changes may account for the chronicity of
the disease and the long-term survival of b cells in
some patients.
INTRODUCTION
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease involving
the destruction of insulin-producing b cells by diabetes-antigen-
specific T cells. Despite widespread acceptance of this para-
digm, several key questions about the disease pathogenesis
remain. For example, it is not clear why b cell killing takes such
an extended period of time. Some have proposed that there is
waxing and waning of the immune response, possibly due to
environmental factors, and our previous studies support the pe-
riodic nature of b cell killing during the period prior to dysglyce-
mia in individuals at risk (Herold et al., 2015; von Herrath
et al., 2007).
In addition, b cell destruction is not always complete, and
some b cells survive immune attack. Recent observational
studies have shown that there are detectable levels of insulin
production in individuals who have had diabetes for many
years (Keenan et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2009). Consistent with
this is the finding that the immunologic destruction is not uni-
form throughout the islets, and regions that are heavily infil-
trated with immune cells may be located next to regions that
are free of inflammation (Atkinson et al., 2011). These observa-
tions point to heterogeneity of b cells, but the nature and dis-
tribution of subpopulations, their ontogeny, and immunologic
properties have not been identified.
Tissues can adapt to chronic inflammation. Adaptation may
involve expression of inflammatory mediators, such as cyto-
kines, or factors that may improve the viability of the cells,
such as VEGF (Akirav et al., 2011; Eizirik et al., 2009). Little
is known about how immune responses change b cells and
how b cells may respond to immune mediators. The question
is of clinical importance because despite the success of
some immune mediators in reducing decline in b cell function
short term, permanent remission of T1D
has not
been
achieved. It is possible that intrinsic b cell factors lead to
destruction.
Our lab and others have shown increased rates of b cell pro-
liferation during the prediabetes period in non-obese diabetic
(NOD) mice (Sherry et al., 2006; Sreenan et al., 1999). At dia-
betes onset, there is a population of degranulated b cells
that may recover function. These b cells were assumed to
have released all of their insulin granules, but the characteris-
tics and durability of these cells are not known. In other
settings of metabolic stressors, Talchai et al. described adap-
tation of b cells to metabolic stressors involving dedifferentia-
tion with expression of transcripts associated with b cell
precursors such as Neurog3, Oct4, and Nanog (Talchai
et al., 2012).
Studies of b cells in humans, particularly those at risk of
T1D, are difficult because of the inaccessibility of tissue for
study. Herein, we describe how b cells adapt to chronic auto-
immunity in NOD mice by development of a novel subpopula-
tion that can resist immune attack. This subpopulation has
reduced expression of genes associated with their parent
cells and acquires stem-like features, including increased
rates
of
proliferation.
These
cells
avoid
immune
attack
by reducing the expression of diabetogenic antigens and
increasing expression of immunomodulatory molecules. We
postulate that adaptation in these cells may account for the

 chronicity of the disease and persistence of b cells in patients
with T1D.
RESULTS
Subpopulations of b Cells Are Found during Progression
of Diabetes in NOD Mice
We analyzed the cellular composition of islets from NOD and B6
mice of different ages by flow cytometry. Dissociated islet cells
were stained with FluoZin and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester
perchlorate (TMRE) to identify viable b cells (Jayaraman, 2011;
Rui et al., 2016) and with anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody
(mAb) to identify islet infiltrates. Representative b cell profiles
showing side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) in mice
of different ages are shown (Figure 1A). At the beginning of infil-
tration with CD45+ cells at 4 weeks of age, a population of b cells
with lower granularity (lower SSC) was seen. The proportion of
lower-granularity cells among the total number of insulin-positive
cells (Pearson r2 = 0.9537, p = 0.0043), and total CD45 islet cells
(i.e., all CD45� islet cells; Pearson r2 = 0.984, p = 0.0009) signif-
icantly increased over time. The frequency of the lower-granu-
larity population positively correlated with the appearance of
CD45+ intra-islet immunocytes (Pearson r2 = 0.9741, p =
0.0018) (Figure 1C). By 12 weeks of age, when the mice were still
normoglycemic, the lower-granularity population accounted for
�50% of all Zn+ b cells. We did not find similar b cell subsets
in B6 mice (even up to 18 months of age) or in NOD severe com-
bined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (data not shown). In order
to distinguish the different b cell populations, we refer to the
parental b cells as Top b cells and the b cells with lower granu-
larity as Btm (bottom) b cells (Figure 1A, arrows).
To confirm that the cells with lower granularity were b cells and
not a or other cells that may have Zn+ granules, we gated on the
GFP+ b cells in NOD-GFPTg and B6- GFPTg mice in which GFP
expression is driven by the mouse Ins1 promoter (Figure 1B).
Diabetes occurs earlier (between 6 and 9 weeks after birth) in
NOD GFPTg mice than in NOD mice, and we therefore analyzed
these mice beginning at 3 weeks of age. As in wild-type NOD
mice, we identified two populations, based on SSC, among
GFP+ b cells in transgenic NOD, but not B6, mice.
Glucose itself may affect b cell mass and granularity (Jonas
et al., 1999; Laybutt et al., 2003). To determine whether
increasing glucose was associated with the changes in b cells,
we performed intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTTs)
on NOD mice aged 6–13 weeks and B6 mice aged 7–10 weeks
and compared the glucose area under the curve (AUC) and
peak glucose during the 120-min test. The AUC and peak
glucose levels did not increase significantly in NOD mice over
this age range and were significantly lower in NOD mice than
in B6 mice at each time point (Figure S1, available online). In
addition, we compared IPGTT results in NOD and NOD/
SCIDgc�/� mice, which do not have an immune system, and
found that neither the AUC nor peak glucose levels were signif-
icantly different in these strains (Figure S1). Figure 1D shows
the normal IPGTT and the fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) plots of b cells from two NOD mice aged 9 weeks.
The reduced granularity was associated with reduced insulin
content per b cell. We compared the mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI) of insulin in Btm cells and Top cells in NOD mice of different
ages and found a decrease in insulin protein in Btm versus Top
cells beginning after 4 weeks of age, with a precipitous decline
at 12 weeks (Figure 1E). Insulin release from FACS-sorted Top
cells was higher, and Top, but not Btm, cells responded to
high glucose (Figure 1F).
Previous reports have highlighted the role of endoplasmic re-
ticulum (ER) stress in b cell function and survival (Tersey et al.,
2012). To determine whether Btm cells have increased ER stress
and cell death, we compared the expression of ER stress
markers in FACS-sorted subpopulations from islets of 8- to 10-
week-old NOD mice. We did not identify significant differences
in expression of Chop, Xbp1, Bip, Aft4, or Wfs1 (Figure S2A).
In addition, the expression of the autophagy genes Atg5,
LC3b, Becn1, Bnip3, and Gabarap as well as the cell apoptosis
gene Casp3 was similar between the two subpopulations
(Figure S2B).
To test the role of immune cells in the development of b cell
subpopulations, we treated 9-week-old NOD mice with F(ab0)2
fragments of a-CD3 mAb, which arrests immune-mediated killing
of b cells by T cells (Chatenoud et al., 1997). Nine days later, the
frequency of Btm cells was lower in anti-CD3 mAb-treated mice
Figure 1. Changes in b Cell Composition during Diabetes Progression in NOD Mice
(A) Islets from non-obese diabetic (NOD) and B6 mice of different ages were hand-picked, dispersed into single cells, and stained with FluoZin and tetrame-
thylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate (TMRE) to identify viable b cells. Top and bottom (Btm) b cells were detected by differences in side scatter (SSC) and
forward scatter (FSC) (numbers refer to the percentage of total Zn+TMRE+ cells). Shown are representative FACS profiles from one of three independent ex-
periments, each with three to five mice at each time point.
(B) FACS side/forward scatter (SSC/FSC) profiles of GFP+ b cells from either mouse insulin-promoter (MIP) NOD-GFP or age-matched B6-GFP transgenic mice.
Numbers refer to the percentage of either Top or Btm b cells among all GFP+ cells. Data are from one individual experiment representative of three individual
experiments with three or four mice for each time point.
(C) The frequency of intra-islet lymphocytes and Btm b cells as a proportion of b cells or total islet endocrine cells increased over time. The lines show Btm b cells
as a proportion of insulin-positive islet cells (B) (Pearson r2 = 0.9537, p = 0.0043) and as a proportion of total islet cells (D) (i.e., CD45�, Pearson r2 = 0.984, p =
0.0009). The frequency of islets infiltrates (i.e., CD45+) increased over time (>) (Pearson r2 = 0.9083, p = 0.0121). Data represent mean ± SEM (n = 6 mice each
time point). There was a close relationship between the frequency of intra-islet lymphocytes and bottom (Btm) cells (Pearson r2 = 0.987, p = 0.002).
(D) The results of IPGTT and FACS profiles of b cells from two 9-week-old NOD mice are shown.
(E) The ratio of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of FACS-sorted Top and Btm b cell islets of NOD mice of different ages, stained with anti-insulin-APC
(Allophycocyanin) antibody, is shown. Column statistics refer to a one-sample Student’s t test comparing the ratio of the MFI of insulin in the bottom:top to 1. Each
symbol represents an individual mouse. The mean ± SEM is shown (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001).
(F) Top and Btm b cells were sorted from islets from six mice, and insulin was measured in cultures with 1 g/L or 4.5 g/L glucose for 8 hr. Top cells made more
insulin (****p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, multiple comparisons) than Btm cells and responded to high glucose. Data represent individual wells (50,000 cells in each
well) from pools of three to four mice (p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, multiple comparisons).

 (Figure 2B). To determine whether arresting the attack would
lead to recovery of the Top population, we followed mice after
a-CD3 mAb treatment at 7 weeks of age for an additional 3 weeks
(Figure 2C). Treatment with anti-CD3 mAb maintained the fre-
quency of subpopulations at levels similar to the pre-treatment
group, but the frequency of the Btm subpopulation did not in-
crease beyond the level measured at the start of immune treat-
ment (Figure 2C).
Thus, these studies indicate that a new subpopulation of
viable b cells with reduced insulin granularity appears with
immune infiltrates. Immune therapy blocks the development of
this new subpopulation.
Changes in the Transcriptome of b Cell Subpopulations
We then compared gene expression in the Top and Btm subpop-
ulations by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The cells were sorted
from dissociated islets from 8- to 10-week-old NOD mice
(n = 4–6 mice per sorting, four sortings). We identified 457 genes
that showed significant differences (false discovery rate [FDR] <
0.05 and >2-fold change) between the two subpopulations (Fig-
ure S3). The most differentially expressed 50 genes with the
smallest FDR and a volcano plot of the 457 genes are shown in
Figures 3A and 3B. The affected transcripts were from genes
associated with b cell function (e.g., Glut2), metabolism (Acot7,
ApoE, Arg1, and Pcx), and cell mobility (CCL19, CD24, and
CXCL12). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to identify
affected pathways (Table 1). Among those most highly affected
were pathways associated with immune cell trafficking and
signaling of inflammatory mediators. The apoptosis pathway
was decreased in Btm cells (p = 4.19 3 10�7), and pathways
associated with islet cell development were affected (p =
1.89 3 10�3). Genes associated with cell proliferation were
increased in Btm cells (p = 2.06 3 10�4).

mAb Arrests Changes in b Cells
F(ab0)2 fragments of anti-CD3 mAb 145-2C11 or
control Ig were given to 9-week-old NOD mice (n =
6–9 mice each experiment). The mice were sacri-
ficed after 9 days, and b cell subpopulations were
analyzed by flow cytometry.
(A) Representative data showing SSC/FCS of b cells
are shown from a single experiment representative
of three independent experiments. The numbers
indicate the percentage of Top and Btm b cells.
(B) The percentage of Top b cells was compared
between anti-CD3 Tx mice and those in the immu-
noglobulin control and untreated groups (Kruskal-
Wallis test, **p < 0.01). Data from individual mice are
shown. Bars are mean ± SEM.
(C) Human immunoglobulin (hIg) or anti-CD3 mAb
was given to 7-week-old NOD mice, and these
mice were followed for 3 weeks after treatment
(Kruskal-Wallis, pre-treatment [Pre-Tx] or hIg versus
anti-CD3, ***p < 0.001). Ig, immunoglobulin; IgG,
immunoglobulin G; Tx, treatment. Data from indi-
vidual mice are shown. Bars are mean ± SEM.
To confirm and extend our findings,
we analyzed specific genes in the two sub-
populations by real-time qPCR. There was
reduced expression of Ins1, Ins2, Glut2, Mafa, Foxo1, Nkx6.1,
Pdx1, and Chga in Btm cells (Figure 4A; n = 3–11 per group, Stu-
dent’s t test with FDR < 0.05). Neurog3, which marks endocrine
progenitors, was increased �8-fold in Btm cells (p < 0.0001).
Compared to Top cells, there was increased expression of
both Gcg and Sst in Btm b cells. Similar changes were seen in
b cells from NOD MIP-GFPTg mice, but expression of FoxO1,
Mafa, Chga, and Neurog3 were not significantly different (Fig-
ure S4). We did not find any insulin-glucagon dual-positive cells
by flow cytometry, but we did identify an increase in islet cells
that were negative for both insulin and glucagon in NOD islets
when compared to age-matched B6 islets (Figure 4B).
Our pathway studies showed increased expression of genes
associated with cellular proliferation in the Btm subpopulation.
To measure this, we added BrdU to the drinking water of
8-week-old mice for 9 days and analyzed the frequency of
BrdU+ subpopulations of b cells. The incorporation of BrdU
into the cells in the Btm subpopulation was increased 2-fold
compared to the Top population (Figures 4C and 4D).
The loss of the b cell markers and the increase in Neurog3
implied dedifferentiation of the Btm b cells. We measured genes
associated with ‘‘stemness’’ and found increased expression of
Sox9, Sox2, Oct4, and L-Myc by real-time qPCR in Btm cells
versus Top cells (Figure 4E). However, the expression level of
these transcription factors was �10-fold lower than that found
in the mouse stem cell line SCRC-1002 (Figure 4E). Consistent
with enhanced progenitor signatures, we also detected higher
aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in Btm b cells than in
Top cells in islets from 8- to 10-week-old NOD mice (Figure 4F).

expression of genes associated with apoptosis and cell death in

 our IPA analysis suggested that Btm cells might be resistant to
immune killing. According to the results of RNA-seq, relevant an-
tigens, Gad1, Chga, and Ins1/Ins2 had reduced gene expression.
We analyzed expression of other antigens and other immune-
regulatory molecules suggested in the transcriptional analysis.
Real-time qPCR determined that expression of IGRP, ZnT8,
IA-2, and Gad1 was lower in Btm populations than in Top
populations (Figure 5A). In addition, real-time qPCR detected
increased expression of PD-L1, the ligand for PD-1, a negative
costimulatory molecule for T cells (Figure 5B), and the minor
class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen Qa-2
(Figure 5B), which is known to modulate cellular immune re-
sponses (Riteau et al., 2001), in Btm cells. We confirmed
increased expression of PD-L1 in Btm b cells by flow cytometry
and also found decreased expression of CD40 and insulin (Fig-
ures 5C and 5D). Interestingly, there was a strong correlation
between PD-L1-expressing b cells and CD45+ islet infiltrates
(Figure 5E).
To directly test the susceptibility of the b cell subsets to im-
mune attack, we synchronized the disease mechanisms by
treating 9-week-old NOD mice with cyclophosphamide, which
is thought to induce diabetes by reducing regulatory T cells

lations of b Cells from NOD Mice
Top and Btm b cells, sorted from 8- to 10-week-old
NOD mice, were used for RNA-seq. Column

sortings with islet cells from five to six mice in each).

(Brode et al., 2006). Two weeks later, the
frequency of the two b cell subsets was
compared to that of mice treated with sa-
line. Over the course of the experiment, 1
out of 13 mice in the saline-treated group
and 4 out of 11 mice in the cyclophospha-
mide-treated group developed overt hy-
perglycemia. (These mice are included in
the analysis shown in Figures 5F and 5G.)
The proportion of Btm cells was signifi-
cantly higher in cyclophosphamide-treated
mice than in saline-treated mice, indicating
that there was preferential loss of the Top
subset. When diabetic mice were excluded
from the analysis, there was still a signifi-
cantly
lower
proportion
of
Top
cells
in cyclophosphamide-treated mice (p =
0.003, Mann-Whitney U test). Moreover,
we also analyzed the proportions of cells
in NOD mice that had developed diabetes
spontaneously or following treatment with
cyclophosphamide (Figure S5). Btm cells
comprised the majority of total b cells, indi-
cating that these cells persist even after the
onset of hyperglycemia.
To further test the susceptibility of the two populations to
killing, we cultured FACS-sorted Top and Btm b cells with
islet immune infiltrates (CD45+ T cells) or proinflammatory cyto-
kines (interferon g [IFN-g] + interleukin-1b [IL-1b] + IL-6) and
compared cell death by flow cytometry (Figures 5H and 5I).
Compared to culture with media alone, there was increased
cell killing when Top, but not Btm, b cells were cultured with
infiltrating lymphoid cells or cytokines, respectively, and the
proportion of live Top cells was lower at the end of the cultures
(Figures 5H and 5I).
Changes in Human b Cells in Culture with Allogeneic
Lymphoid Cells
To test whether similar changes occur in human b cells upon
encountering immune stressors, we cultured human islets from
non-diabetic donors with allogeneic peripheral blood mononu-
clear cells (PBMCs) from patients with T1D or healthy control
subjects (HC) for 4 days and then analyzed b cell composition
by flow cytometry. When the islets were cultured with both
PBMC donors, we found a subpopulation of human b cells
similar to those found in NOD mice with insulitis (Figures 6A
and 6B).

 DISCUSSION
It takes years for T1D to develop in humans. The extended
course of the disease has been attributed to a waxing and
waning of the immune response and the focal nature of b cell
killing in the pancreas, but previous studies have not addressed
how b cells respond to immune assault, which may also account
for the kinetics and the finding that residual b cells escape
destruction in patients with long-duration T1D. In these studies,
we have addressed how b cells respond to immune attack. Dur-
ing progression of insulitis in the NOD model of T1D, a population
of b cells appears that, compared to normal cells, show reduced
insulin granularity and reduced expression of markers that define
mature b cells. This population develops in response to the
activity of immune cells, because its formation correlates with
infiltration of immune cells in the islets, is not found in mice
without insulitis, and is prevented with anti-CD3 mAb. A compar-
ison of gene transcripts between the original (Top) and new (Btm)
populations identified pathways involved in cell movement,
growth and proliferation, immune responses, and cell death
and survival. Our analysis by real-time qPCR showed changes
in the expression of genes associated with b cell ontogeny and
genes that activate the diabetogenic T cell response: antigens
and costimulatory molecules. With human islets, a similar popu-
lation of b cells appears when islets are cultured with PBMCs
from patients with T1D or healthy control subjects. The immune
responses in these experiments were driven by the allogeneic
differences. These studies identify a novel mechanism of cell
protection from immunologic destruction in which b cells lose
features of their normal identity, increase expression of immune
inhibitory molecules and proliferation, and resist killing. This
mechanism may lead to an ongoing cycle of neogenesis of b
cells that are killed by an immune response or even long-term
survival of a subpopulation of b cells, as has been described in
individuals with longstanding T1D (Keenan et al., 2010; Liu
et al., 2009).
A trivial explanation for our findings is that the lower-granu-
larity population of cells represents non-b islet cells that can har-
bor Zn+ granules (Bosco et al., 2010). However, the same two
populations of b cells were identified in GFP+ b cells from NOD
mice, in which GFP was driven by Ins1 promoter. It was also
possible that the lower-granularity population represented dying
or stressed b cells; activation of ER stress pathways in b cells has
been seen prior to onset of T1D in NOD mice (Tersey et al., 2012).
However, we did not identify differences in the expression of in-
dividual genes associated with ER stress and apoptosis by real-
time qPCR between Top and Btm cells, and our IPA analysis of
the RNA-seq data showed reduced expression of apoptosis
pathway genes in Btm cells (181 genes, Z score �2.142, p =
4.19E�07).
Degranulated b cells have been described by our group and
others at the time of diagnosis in NOD mice (Sherry et al.,
2006). It was thought that b cells released all of their insulin-con-
taining granules to maintain glycemic control. However, our pre-
vious observations and these new findings suggest that Btm b
cells are the consequence of islet infiltrates rather than metabolic
stressors, since glucose levels were normal in NOD mice. More-
over, if cell infiltration is treated with anti-CD3 mAb, the develop-
ment of Btm cells is prevented, although the frequency of Top,
fully granulated b cells does not recover beyond what was found
when immune therapy commenced. There may be additional
‘‘recovery’’ of Top cells with more extended follow-up.
Btm cells differ from Top cells in a number of ways in addition
to reduced insulin granules. We found increased transcription of
heat shock proteins (both increased by RNA-seq [HspB1, 6.46-
fold, p = 0.005] and decreased [HspB6e, 180-fold, p = 0.0003]),
which has been seen in islet stress responses (Eizirik and Cnop,
2010; Tsang et al., 2010). It has been proposed that the deficit in
b cell mass in T1D may be in part due to b cell degranulation to
chromogranin-positive hormone-negative (CPHN) cells (Akirav
et al., 2008). A recent study with tissue from human T1D subjects
suggests that CPHN cells are more frequent in T1D and distrib-
uted in a pattern comparable to neonatal pancreas, implying
possible attempted regeneration (Md Moin et al., 2016).
Our analysis also shows a dynamic interplay between immune
and b cells. In Btm cells, there was increased expression of PD-
L1, the ligand for PD-1 that is expressed in diabetogenic CD8+
T cells as a result of antigen encounter but whose ligation inhibits
T cell activity (Karwacz et al., 2011). Expression of transcripts for
diabetes-associated antigens such as IGRP, Chga, Gad1, and
Ins1/Ins2 gene expression was reduced (more than 80-fold for
Gad1 by RNA-seq, p = 6.86 3 10�12). Immune inhibitory ligands
such as Qa-2 (also known as H2-Q9), the murine homolog of
human HLA-G, which plays a major role in maternal-fetal and
self-tolerance (Rouas-Freiss et al., 1997), protects cells from

 Figure 4. Transcription Profiles of the Two b Cell Subpopulations by Real-Time qPCR
(A) Top and Btm b cells were sorted from 8- to 10-week-old NOD mice. RNA was recovered, and the transcription levels of the b cell genes shown were measured
by real-time qPCR. The Ct values were normalized to Actb mRNA levels (DCt = Ct of Actb-Ct of target gene + 20). Data represent mean ± SEM of three ex-
periments, each with pools of four to six mice. Student’s t tests were performed with an FDR of 5% (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001).
(B) FACS analysis of insulin and glucagon expression in islet cells pooled from 10-week-old NOD and B6 mice (numbers refer to the percent of the cells gated on
CD45� cells). Data are from a single experiment representative of three experiments.
(C) Eight-week-old NOD mice were given bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in drinking water for 9 days, followed by normal water for another week before sacrifice. The
incorporation of BrdU was studied in unsorted or sorted Top and Btm b cells. The number refers to the percentage of BrdU+ cells of total b cells. Data are from
pooled cells from two or three mice per experiment and are representative of three independent experiments.

 the lytic activity of both innate (natural killer [NK] cells) and effec-
tors when transfected in M8 melanoma cells, (Lee et al., 2010;
Riteau et al., 2001) were expressed. In addition, there was
increased expression of chemokines (e.g., CCL5 [p = 1 3
10�6], CCL19 [p = 1.1 3 10�11], and others) involved in immune
cell movement. Altogether, our data show resistance of Btm cells
to immune killing through five complementary approaches: (1)
An anti-immune agent, anti-CD3 mAb, which inhibits T cells, pre-
vents further predominance of the bottom subpopulation. (2)
There are higher rates of cell death in the Top subpopulation
when the two subpopulations are cultured with the same islet-
infiltrating immune cells. (3) There are higher rates of cell death
in the Top subpopulation when the two subpopulations are
cultured with proinflammatory cytokines. (4) Cyclophosphamide
treatment, which precipitates diabetes, presumably by inhibiting
immune regulatory mechanisms, leads to preferential loss of the
top subpopulation. (5) After hyperglycemia develops, the Btm
cells are present and represent the majority of cells.
We also found an increase in several genes associated with
the deposition of matrix and cell migration, such as collagen

 and fibronectin, but many of these molecules may also play an
important role in recruiting immune cells by serving as ligands
for integrin ligands such as a5 (Tzima et al., 2005). For example,
TNFRSF9 (CD137, 41BB), which is found in this pathway, can
serve as a costimulatory ligand for T cells and was reduced
19.7-fold (p = 0.028). We cannot exclude that there was migra-
tion of Btm b cells from the sites of immunopathology, possibly
from the adjacent exocrine pancreas, but our studies did not
address this possibility.
Btm b cells have many features of a dedifferentiated state.
Talchai et al. described differentiation of b cells as a mechanism
that can lead to b cell loss in mice with metabolic stress but
may also create a pool of potential precursor cells that can ulti-
mately develop into insulin producing cells (Talchai et al.,
2012). Several transcription factors associated with mature b
cells showed significant differences when tested by real-time
qPCR, such as Chga, Mafa, Foxo1, Pdx1, and Nkx6-1. Dnmt3a,
which is required for b cell function maturation (Dhawan et al.,
2015), was decreased by 2.11-fold by RNA-seq (p = ns), as
was Dnmt3b, which was decreased 20-fold (p = 0.0065) by
RNA-seq and has been shown to be induced by oxidative stress
(Wei and Loeken, 2014). The relative expression of Gcg as well
as Sst was increased in Btm cells compared to normal b cells,
but we did not find dual-hormone-positive cells by flow cytome-
try or electron microscopy (EM) (data not shown), indicating that
the cells did not acquire features of true endocrine precursor
cells. Likewise, the lower-granularity subpopulation showed
increased expression of genes associated with endocrine pro-
genitors and cell ‘‘stemness’’ and increased ALDH activity,
which is widely used as a hallmark of stem/progenitor cells
(Pearce et al., 2005). However, the expression level of these
genes was relatively low. These findings suggest that the Btm
population has features of dedifferentiated b cells rather than
true stem cells. In addition, Btm b cells showed higher rates of
replication compared to Top cells. Although the uptake of bro-
modeoxyuridine (BrdU) was increased, suggesting cell prolifera-
tion, we cannot exclude that there was some uptake as a result of
cell killing that was also taking place.
Dorrell et al. recently identified four antigenically distinct sub-
types of human b cells, distinguished by expression of ST8SIA1
and Cd9, that were altered in distribution in the islets of patients
with T2D (Dorrell et al., 2016). Interestingly, the Btm b cells
that we have studied showed significantly higher expression of
Cd9 (increase 7.8-fold, p = 0.0005) but ST8SIA1 expression
was decreased (2.64-fold, p = 0.227). Bader found proliferative
and mature b cells in the islets that could be distinguished by
Fltp expression that differentiated mature b cells from those
with proliferative capacity (Bader et al., 2016). However, our
studies pertain to cells that have already fully differentiated,
and therefore, the factors that affect b cell lineage and develop-
ment may not be altered.
Even subtle elevations of glucose may affect b cells (Jonas
et al., 1999; Laybutt et al., 2003). In addition, placement of islet
from a hyperglycemic environment into a normoglycemic envi-
ronment can restore insulin secretion (Krogvold et al., 2015).
However, the changes that we found in b cells occurred in the
absence of any detectable impairment in glucose tolerance (Fig-
ure S1). We do not know which immune factors lead to changes
in b cells. Blodgett et al. identified inflammatory gene products in
fetal human b cells, raising the possibility that immune cell prod-
ucts can directly affect b cell differentiation (Blodgett et al.,
2015). The relatively rapid appearance of the subpopulation
most likely reflects epigenetic changes in these cells, but further
studies will be needed to address this mechanism. Our previous
studies showed that cytokines may cause changes in DNA meth-
yltransferases and Ins1/2 DNA methylation (Rui et al., 2016), and
we found increased expression of several inflammatory path-
ways in Btm cells by RNA-seq, including HMGB1(p = 2.11E00),
Cxcl15(p = 1.91E00), and IL-6 (p = 2.18E00), among others.
Epigenetic changes in other b cell genes are likely to occur,
but further study will be needed to identify these mechanisms.
Due to the practical difficulties in studying b cells from individ-
uals at risk of T1D, we carried out our studies in NOD mice, a
widely recognized model of human disease. Studies using this
rodent system clearly have limitations. First, some evidence
suggests that b cell proliferation may be more vigorous in mice
than in humans, where clear evidence for cell replication and in-
creases in b cell mass after early childhood is lacking. Previous
studies of NOD diabetes have described proliferation of b cells
in the prediabetes period, which may be accounted for the sub-
population we have described (Sherry et al., 2006; Sreenan et al.,
1999). Whether the same changes occur in human subjects in
whom T1D develops has not been studied. Metabolic studies
do suggest that there is dysfunction of b cells, reflected by a de-
layed secretory response to glucose during progression and
Figure 6. Changes in Human b Cells in Culture with Allogeneic
Lymphoid Cells from Patients with T1D
PBMCs from patients with T1D or healthy control subjects (HC) were cultured
with human islets for 4 days. Single b cell composition was analyzed by FACS
after staining with FluoZin and TMRE. (A) Representative data showing SSC/
FSC from one of four experiments are shown. The numbers indicate the per-
centage of Top and Btm b cells. (B) The percentage of Btm b cells from each
well from four independent experiments was calculated and compared. Each
data point represents a pool of islet cells from four separate experiments

 after onset of T1D that may reflect the changes in b cells that we
have studied (Ferrannini et al., 2010). Interestingly, in an analysis
of b cell decline after the onset of T1D, we previously showed
that individuals with a delayed response to an oral meal lose
the insulin secretory response at a slower rate than those who
show a normal rapid response (Steele et al., 2004). Finally, it is
important to note that the studies in NOD mice reflect occur-
rences in an inbred strain, where the events leading to disease
are more or less synchronized. In humans, there may be other
environmental factors that affect progression of b cell and immu-
nologic responses. Nonetheless, our studies suggest that the
features we observed are not restricted to mice, since similar
changes occur in human b cells.
In summary, our findings describe modifications of b cells that
occur during autoimmune attack that lead to T1D. Eventually, in
NOD mice as in humans, the majority of (if not all) b cells are
destroyed by immune effectors and products. However, the pro-
cess is protracted. We have identified mechanisms that b cells
use to survive. Future studies that can recover mature b cells
from the pool of modified cells may identify ways of restoring
normal metabolic function together with immune therapy.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice
Female NOD, B6, and NOD/SCID mice were obtained from The Jackson Lab-
oratory and maintained under pathogen-free conditions. Female MIP-GFPTg
mice were a gift from M. Hara (University of Chicago), and B6-GFPTg mice
were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and later bred in our own animal
specific-pathogen-free (SPF) facility. All protocols were approved by the Yale
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Human Islets and Cell Lines
Human islet samples were obtained from adult, non-diabetic organ donors
from the Integrated Islet Distribution Program (Dhawan et al., 2015). Mouse
stem cell line SCRC-1002, derived from B6 mice, was provided by Dr. Shang-
qin Guo. The use of human tissues was approved by the Yale Institutional
Review Board.
Mouse Islet Isolation and b Cell Staining and Purification
Mouse isletswere handpickedwith a stereomicroscopeafter collagenase diges-
tion of pancreases (Rui et al., 2016). Single-cell suspensions were prepared after
a second collagenase digestion. Cells were stained with FluoZin-3 (Invitrogen)
andTMRE(LifeTechnologies)and anti-CD45mAb(eBioscience).Insome exper-
iments, single islet cells were stained with anti-insulin (R&D Systems) and anti-
glucagon (Abcam) antibodies labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC),
PD-L1 (BioLegend), or CD40 (BioLegend) and analyzed with LSRFortessa
(BD). For purification, b cells stained with TMRE and FluoZin-3 were sorted using
an FACSAria II (BD).
In other studies, b cell subpopulations were sorted from 8- to 10-week-old
NOD mice (n = 6–8 per experiment), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
activity was detected by flow cytometry after processing the cells using an
ALDEFLUOR kit (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Low-Input RNA-Seq and Data Analysis
Subpopulations of b cells were sorted from 8- to 10-week-old NOD mice. Cell
viability and concentration were assessed using the Countess Automated Cell
Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reverse transcription and cDNA amplifica-
tion were performed from �1,000 cells using the SMARTer Ultra Low RNA kit
(Clontech Laboratories). Sequencing libraries were prepared using Nextera XT
DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina). Libraries were pooled and sequenced
on an Illumina HiSeq2000 using single-end 50-bp reads. Mapping of reads
to mouse reference transcriptome mm9 and quantification of mRNA expres-
sion levels were done using RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). Identification of
differentially expressed genes was performed using the Bioconductor pack-
age EdgeR (Robinson et al., 2010), employing a generalized linear model
taking into account both the technical batch and the cell type. The resulting
p values were adjusted using Benjamini and Hochberg’s procedure for con-
trolling the FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). A heatmap was generated
with the row Z score of the log2 (counts per minute [CPM] + 1) using R
heatmap.2 function. Data were also analyzed with QIAGEN IPA with the
following analysis settings: fold change > 1.5, p value < 0.05, Ingenuity Knowl-
edge Base reference set, direct and indirect relationships, for tissue and cell
lines, and all mutations. This exploratory analysis was not corrected for multi-
ple comparisons.
Probes, Primers, and Real-Time qPCR
The TaqMan probes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) used to perform real-time qPCR
using a TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix are listed in Table S1. In some
experiments, primer pairs were used together with a QuantiFast SYBR green
PCR kit (QIAGEN). The sequences of primer pairs used in this study are listed
in Table S2. The Actb housekeeping gene was used to normalize the input RNA
in all real-time qPCR assays. Gene transcription was presented as DCt = (Ct of
Actb � Ct of target gene) + 20 or in other cases as relative fold to the compar-
ator subpopulation.
BrdU Administration and Incorporation Analysis
BrdU (0.8 mg/mL, Sigma) was added to the drinking water of 8-week-old NOD
mice (n = 4–6 per experiment) with 1% glucose for 9 days. One week later, the
mice were sacrificed and the incorporation of BrdU in b cells was studied by
flow cytometry. One aliquot of the single islet cells was set aside to enumerate
the total number of b cells, and the incorporation of BrdU into subpopulations
of b cells was identified with a BrdU staining kit (BioLegend).
Induction of Diabetes with Cyclophosphamide
Nine-week-old NOD mice were given a single dose of cyclophosphamide
(250 mg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.], Sigma), and glucose was measured for up
to 12 days. Islets were then harvested, and b cell composition was compared
with saline-treated controls by flow cytometry.
In Vitro b Cell Killing Assay
Top and Btm b cells and islet infiltrates (CD45+ T cells) were sorted from 8- to
10-week-old NOD mice and placed in RPMI 1640 media for 4 hr before adding
cytokine cocktails (10 U/mL IL-1b, 100 U/mL IFN-g + 100 U/mL IL-6), or CD45+
islet cell infiltrates at a ratio of 5:1, to either Top or Btm b cells for 24 hr. The
cells were then harvested, and cell death was analyzed by flow using fixable
viability dyes (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Intraperitoneal Glucose Tolerance Test
NOD, NSG, or B6 mice were fasted for 16 hr. Blood glucose levels were
measured 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose injection (2 g/kg body
weight).
Measurement of Insulin Response to Glucose
Top and Btm b cells were sorted from islets from six mice between 8 and
10 weeks of age. Sorted cells were placed in CMRL1066 media for 4 hr, rinsed,
and placed in low- (1 g/L) or high-glucose (4.5 g/L) CMRL for 8 hr. Insulin was
measured in supernatants using an Ultra Sensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA Kit
(Crystal Chem).
Therapy with Anti-CD3 mAb
F(ab0)2 fragments of anti-CD3 mAb 145-2C11 or control immunoglobulin
(10 mg/day i.p., five times) was given to 7- or 9-week-old NOD mice. The
treated mice were then sacrificed at the indicated times, and islets were
analyzed by flow cytometry.
Human Islet Cultures
Human islets were placed in culture in CMRL 1066 medium with 2.5 3 106
PBMCs from patients with T1D for 4 days. The islets were then collected,
dispersed into single cells, and stained with FluoZin and TMRE to determine
b cell composition by flow cytometry.
