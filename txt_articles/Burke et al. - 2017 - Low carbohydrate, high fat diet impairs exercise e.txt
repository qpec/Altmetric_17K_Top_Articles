Key points
r Three weeks of intensified training and mild energy deficit in elite race walkers increases peak
aerobic capacity independent of dietary support.
r Adaptation to a ketogenic low carbohydrate, high fat (LCHF) diet markedly increases rates of
whole-body fat oxidation during exercise in race walkers over a range of exercise intensities.
r The increased rates of fat oxidation result in reduced economy (increased oxygen demand for
a given speed) at velocities that translate to real-life race performance in elite race walkers.

Abstract We investigated the effects of adaptation to a ketogenic low carbohydrate (CHO),
high fat diet (LCHF) during 3 weeks of intensified training on metabolism and performance of
world-class endurance athletes. We controlled three isoenergetic diets in elite race walkers: high
CHO availability (g kg−1 day−1: 8.6 CHO, 2.1 protein, 1.2 fat) consumed before, during and after
training (HCHO, n = 9); identical macronutrient intake, periodised within or between days to
alternate between low and high CHO availability (PCHO, n = 10); LCHF (< 50 g day−1 CHO;
78% energy as fat; 2.1 g kg−1 day−1 protein; LCHF, n = 10). Post-intervention, ˙
VO2peak during
race walking increased in all groups (P < 0.001, 90% CI: 2.55, 5.20%). LCHF was associated with
markedly increased rates of whole-body fat oxidation, attaining peak rates of 1.57 ± 0.32 g min−1
during 2 h of walking at �80% ˙
VO2peak. However, LCHF also increased the oxygen (O2) cost of race
walking at velocities relevant to real-life race performance: O2 uptake (expressed as a percentage
of new ˙
VO2peak) at a speed approximating 20 km race pace was reduced in HCHO and PCHO
(90% CI: −7.047, −2.55 and −5.18, −0.86, respectively), but was maintained at pre-intervention
levels in LCHF. HCHO and PCHO groups improved times for 10 km race walk: 6.6% (90% CI:
4.1, 9.1%) and 5.3% (3.4, 7.2%), with no improvement (−1.6% (−8.5, 5.3%)) for the LCHF
group. In contrast to training with diets providing chronic or periodised high-CHO availability,
and despite a significant improvement in ˙
VO2peak, adaptation to the topical LCHF diet negated
performance benefits in elite endurance athletes, in part due to reduced exercise economy.

Introduction
During continuous exercise lasting more than a few
minutes duration, skeletal muscle is fuelled by both intra-
and extramuscular carbohydrate (CHO) and lipid sub-
strates, with only a minor contribution from amino acids
(for review see Hawley et al. 2015). These observations
were made over a century ago by Zuntz & Schumburg
(1901) who manipulated the proportions of fat and CHO
in the diet for several days and showed changes in the
non-protein respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during
subsequent submaximal exercise. These experiments
identified a potential benefit for CHO as a substrate for
muscle metabolism by virtue of an �8% higher energy
yield per litre of oxygen (O2) consumed when CHO
was the primary fuel oxidised. Krogh & Lindhard (1920)
confirmed the findings of Zuntz & Schumburg (1901)
and reported a 5.5% greater energy yield (per litre of
O2 consumption) during laboratory cycling with CHO
rather than fat dependence. These workers also reported
that subjects perceived a fixed, submaximal exercise task
to be easier after several days of consuming a high CHO
diet than when the preceding diet was CHO-restricted and
high in fat.
The application of surgical techniques to exercise
biochemistry in the 1960s (Bergstrom & Hultman, 1966)
made it possible to obtain direct measurement of sub-
strate storage and utilisation from skeletal muscle biopsy
samples and precipitated a more sophisticated under-
standing of the role of dietary CHO in determining
exercise capacity (Bergstrom et al. 1967) and endurance
performance (Karlsson & Saltin, 1971). Largely as a
result of these studies, sport nutrition guidelines in the
early 1990s promoted a high CHO diet, particularly
around exercise sessions, to maximise muscle glycogen
stores, and exogenous CHO fuels for both training and
competition (Coyle, 1991). However, recent guidelines
(Burke et al. 2004, 2011; Thomas et al. 2016) have
evolved to acknowledge that a universal recommendation
of absolute CHO intake is unsuitable because (1) the
highly variable nature of exercise/sporting activities
dictates that the quantity and timing of dietary CHO
should be prescribed according to the anticipated fuel
needs of exercise (‘CHO availability’), (2) high CHO
availability is beneficial for competition sessions and for
specific training sessions where high intensity exercise
and performance outcomes are required, but it may
be unnecessary when sustained intense exercise is less
important, and (3) the quantity and timing of CHO
intake should be personalised to the athlete and periodised
within the various micro- and macro-cycles of training
and competition requirements. Furthermore, there is
recognition that a periodised programme that includes
some training sessions deliberately undertaken with low
endogenous and/or exogenous CHO availability (‘train
low’; Hawley & Burke, 2010; Bartlett et al. 2015) or a delay
in replacing muscle glycogen after a session (‘sleep low’)
maypromotegreatercellularadaptationstotraining(Lane
etal.2015)andenhanceperformance(Marquetetal.2016)
to a greater magnitude than undertaking all sessions with
high CHO availability.
An alternative view on the optimal fuel support
for sports performance, however, is to maximise the
contribution of fat as a substrate for exercising muscle
by following a low CHO, high fat diet (Noakes et al.
2014; Volek et al. 2015). A key argument in favour of this
notion is that even the leanest athlete has an abundance
of endogenous lipid stores in comparison to limited CHO
reserves. Diets high in fat upregulate the release, transport,
uptake and utilisation of fat in the muscle, even in end-
urance athletes whose training would have been expected
to maximise such adaptations (Spriet, 2014; Burke, 2015).
This concept has been explored in trained individuals
in various formats over the past 40 years. Strategies
have included chronic exposure to either a ketogenic
(< 20 g day−1 CHO), high fat (80% of energy) diet
(Phinney et al. 1983) or a restricted CHO (15–20%
of energy), high fat (60–65% of energy) diet (Lambert
et al. 1994; Goedecke et al. 1999) as well as short-term
adaptation to a high fat diet and 1 day of high
CHO availability (Burke et al. 2000, 2002; Carey
et al. 2001; Havemann et al. 2006). Although these
iterations of high(er) fat, low(er) CHO diets result in
increased rates of fat oxidation during exercise of varying
intensities, evidence that this substrate shift translates to
a clear enhancement of sports performance in athletic
populations is lacking (Burke & Kiens, 2006; Burke, 2015).
Despite this, there has been a resurgence of interest in
the published literature and social media (Burke, 2015)
in a specific application of the high fat diet for athletes;
the chronic consumption of a very low (< 50 g day−1)
CHO, moderate protein, high fat (75-80% of energy)
diet. The dual intent of this strategy, termed LCHF or
the ‘keto-diet’, is to increase the utilisation of fat as
a muscle fuel and to expose the body to high levels
of circulating ketones (Noakes et al. 2014; Volek et al.

Ketogenic diet impairs performance in elite race walkers

2015). To date, the only published investigations of this
diet in endurance athletes are a single intervention study
(Phinneyetal.1983)andtworecentcross-sectionalstudies
comparing ultra-endurance runners/triathletes who have
chosen this eating style with similar athletes following
higher CHO diets (Volek et al. 2016; Webster et al.
2016). Since none of these investigations measured the
effects of LCHF on sports performance or were under-
taken using exercise of an intensity that is relevant to the
majority of competitive endurance athletes, there is a need
to systematically investigate claims that LCHF enhances
endurance performance (Burke, 2015). Accordingly, we
determined the effects of a 3-week adaptation to an
LCHF diet during a period of intensified training on
exercise metabolism and performance of world-class end-
urance athletes. Comparisons of interest included both
the traditional sports nutrition guidelines of training with
sustained high CHO availability and the contemporary
ideas around periodised CHO availability. We hypo-
thesised that an LCHF diet would result in increased
rates of fat utilisation during exercise, but would impair
exercise economy and fail to translate into a performance
benefit.
Methods
Ethical approval
This study conformed to the standards set by the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS,
no. 20150802). After comprehensive details of the study
protocol were explained to the subjects orally and in
writing, all participants provided their written informed
consent.
Overview of study design
This study was conducted over two separate training
camps in November 2015 (n = 11) and January 2016
(n = 19), which represented baseline preparation for the
2016 International Association of Athletics Federations
(IAAF) race-walking season and the qualification period
for the 2016 Olympic Games. One subject was injured at
the onset of the first camp and could not complete the
required training and so was removed from the study.
Overall, 21 male race walkers participated in the study,
witheightathletescompletingtwocamps,providingatotal
of29datasets.Thedesignandimplementationofthestudy
involved a pragmatic blend of rigorous scientific control
and research methodology with real-world allowances
needed to accommodate elite athlete populations. The
study took place at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS)
with participants living in athlete residences and under-
taking all meals and training sessions under supervision.
The study consisted of a 3-week structured programme
of intensified training with a testing block carried out
immediately before and afterwards (see Fig. 1).
Participants and allocation to interventions
We established an a priori sample size of 10 sub-
jects per treatment group, based on previous experience
of
detecting
clear
improvements
in
physiological
characteristics and performance over a 3- to 4-week
training period in studies involving 8–10 subjects (Lindsay
et al. 1996; Cox et al. 2010) as well as the resources available
for rigorous control of the intervention and outcome
monitoring. We recruited highly competitive male race
walkers, based on performances ranked by the IAAF,
via word of mouth and targeted invitations from a key
athlete and coach with whom the study was planned.
A total of 21 participants all of whom had had inter-
national race experience were accepted. The cohort ranged
from world class athletes (e.g. a seven-time Olympic
and World Championship medallist from 2008–2016, a
2015 World Championship medallist, members of the
second placed team from the 2016 World Walking Cup
event and holders of national and continental records) to
highly trained athletes (a junior international race walker,
trainingpartnersofworldclassathletes).Ofthe29datasets
collected in this study, 22 involved race walkers who were
selectedforatleastoneofthetwomajoreventsforthe2016
calendar: the IAAF Race Walking Team Championships
and the Summer Olympic Games.
The
study
intervention
involved
three
different
approaches to dietary support for the intensified training
programme: high CHO availability (HCHO), periodised
CHO availability (PCHO) and low CHO, high fat (LCHF).
Our goal was to ensure that participants perceived they
would receive benefits for their race preparation, while
matching groups for key characteristics (age, current
aerobic capacity, personal best times for the 20 km race
walk event and training history and intended training
load). Given the potential for a placebo effect, the
departure of at least one of the treatments from current
sports nutrition guidelines and the pragmatism required
to work with world class athletes in preparation for key
events, we devised a method for allocating participants
to the treatments in this study. Prior to their arrival
to the study camps, participants were educated about
the benefits and limitations of the different dietary
treatments and asked to nominate their preference(s) for,
or non-acceptance of, each of these interventions. We were
abletoallocatetheracewalkerstoapreferredtreatmentfor
each of the study camps, including the preferred order of
treatment for those who participated in two camps, while
achieving suitable matching of groups based on age, body
mass, aerobic capacity and personal best for the 20 km race
walking event (Table 1), and matching of diet allocations

between the two camps. Residual differences between
groups and camps, and the involvement of both single and
dual participation were included in the statistical analyses.
Training intervention
All participants undertook 3 weeks of intensified training
incorporating race walking, resistance training and
cross-training (running, cycling or swimming). Training
sessions were undertaken as a group and were monitored
by the research team as well as recorded by participants
in a daily log. The template for the weekly training
programme was developed in collaboration with a world
class race walker and several coaches to blend the typical
intensified training practices of competitive walkers
with opportunities to implement the desired dietary
intervention. Table 1 details the weekly programme,
noting six mandatory sessions that were undertaken
under standardised conditions with external monitoring.
The remaining sessions were undertaken according to
the preference of the individual athlete and noted in the
participant’s training logs.
Dietary intervention
All foods and fluids consumed during this study were
provided by the AIS Sports Nutrition team, and recorded.
Menu construction and the preparation of meals and
snacks were undertaken by a professional chef, food
service dietitians and sports dietitians. Meal plans were
individually developed for each athlete to integrate
personal food preferences and nutrition requirements
within his allocated dietary treatment. Meals were
eaten in a separate dining area in a group setting
with individualised meals being served for each athlete
according to their meal plans. During each meal service,
the weight of each food item was recorded using
calibrated scales (accurate to 2 g). Individualised snacks
were provided for intake between meals and before
or during training sessions, with the requirement for
their consumption to be cross-checked at the next meal.
A range of ‘free foods and drinks’ (foods with low
energy such as fruits and vegetables, tea or coffee,
water and artificially sweetened beverages) were provided
in the participants’ living area with a checklist to
allow each participant to report on his day’s intake at
the first meal of the following day. Nutrition support
during longer training sessions and after key sessions
was provided at the training site by members of the
research team and intake was recorded. Full details of the
menu plans and study approach are provided elsewhere
(Mirtschin et al. in review). Compliance to the dietary
prescription and reporting requirements was checked
daily.

As a primary goal of the study was to evaluate three
different dietary treatments without any interference due
to large or different changes in body composition, energy
intake for each athlete was set at 40 kcal (kg lean body
mass (BM))−1 day−1. A loss of fat mass of �1–1.5 kg
over the 4-week intervention was permitted and each
athlete could request additional food at meals or from
designated snacks and ‘free snacks’ according to hunger,
increases in training load from the baseline information
or large fluctuations in BM above that expected with the
glycogen or fluid shifts associated with the LCHF. When
such variations occurred, they were achieved by following
the macronutrient composition of the treatment diet and
noted in the actual food consumed.
The three dietary treatments investigated in the
study are summarised below (further detail provided in
Table 2):
(1) High
CHO
availability
(HCHO).
Overall
macronutrient
composition
60–65%
of
energy
from CHO, 15–20% protein, 20% fat; similar daily
CHO intake, with CHO consumed before, during
and after training sessions. The diet represents sports
nutrition guidelines from the 1990s (Coyle, 1991).
(2) Periodised CHO availability (PCHO). Same overall
macronutrient composition as HCHO, but spread
differently between and within days according to fuel
needs of training as well as an integration of some
training sessions with high CHO availability (high
muscle glycogen, CHO feeding during session) and
others with low CHO availability (low pre-exercise
glycogen, overnight fasted or delayed post-session
refuelling). This strategy represents current guidelines
(Thomas
et
al.
2016)
and
evolving
evidence
around benefits of strategic training with low CHO
availability (Bartlett et al. 2015; Marquet et al.
2016).
(3) Low-CHO, high fat diet (LCHF): 75–80% fat, 15–20%
protein, < 50g day−1 CHO. A ketogenic diet following
the guidelines previously reported (Volek & Phinney,
2012) and utilised in a study undertaken with end-
urance cyclists (Phinney et al. 1983).
Test block
Immediately before and after the 3-week training inter-
vention, participants completed a 3-day test block (Fig. 1).
Components of the testing are described below and
involved laboratory testing, a field test of performance,
and a hybrid session of laboratory and field exercise. Each
testwasundertakeninthesameorder,andconditionswere
standardised for each participant
˙
VO2peak and walking economy. On Day 1 of the testing
block, participants completed a treadmill test to assess
economy and ˙
VO2peak while race walking. This test was
undertaken in a fasted, rested state for both pre-treatment
and post-treatment tests. Walking economy was assessed
during four submaximal stages, each of 4 min duration,
increasing in speed by 1 km h−1 each stage. Depending
on each walker’s capability, the speed of the first stage
was 11 or 12 km h−1 and increased to 14–15 km h−1
for the last stage. Typically, the second and fourth stage
of this test corresponded to an individual’s race pace
for the 50- and 20-km race walking events, respectively.
Each 4 min stage was followed by 1 min of rest during
which the treadmill was stopped to allow the collection
of capillary blood samples (finger tip) and ratings of
perceived exertion (6–20, Borg Scale). Heart rate (HR) was
measured continuously during the test (Polar Heart Rate
Monitor, Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland). Expired gas
was collected and analysed using a custom-built indirect
calorimetry system described previously (Robertson et al.
2010), with the final 60 s of gas collection accepted as
steady state and used to calculate RER and O2 uptake.
On completion of the final submaximal walking stage,
subjects rested for 5 min before completing a ramp (speed
and then gradient) test to volitional fatigue. Treadmill
speed recommenced at the first stage of the economy test
and was increased by 0.5 km h−1 every 30 s until the

speed corresponding to the final submaximal stage was

10 km race. On Day 2 of the testing block, the race
walkers competed in an IAAF-sanctioned 10 km race held
on a 400 m outdoor synthetic athletics track (Canberra,
ACT, Australia). To provide incentive for a maximal effort,
prize money was awarded to place getters as well as
those athletes who achieved the highest percentage of
their 20 km walking personal best when the times of
the two races (pre- and post-treatment) were combined.
Each race commenced at 0830 h and was conducted under
IAAF rules, which involved officiating by technical judges,
invitation for participation by competitors external to the
study, a feed zone allowing water intake on the outside
lanes of the track in hot conditions, and photo-finish
electronic timing. Photo-finish timing was used to provide
official race times. Capillary blood samples were collected
immediately before the start of the race and as each
competitor completed the 10 km distance.
For the pre-treatment testing block, participants were
permitted to consume their habitual pre-race diet for
the 24 h prior to the race and their pre-race (morning)
meal provided it was documented accurately. Use of
performance supplements (e.g. caffeine) was discussed
witheachparticipantpriortothefirstrace;permissionwas
provided when it didn’t interfere with the treatment diet,
was documented, and was repeated for the post-treatment
race. For the post-treatment race, participants followed
the diet consistent with their treatment for the 24 h
pre-race period and consumed a pre-race meal according
to their dietary intervention (e.g. high in CHO or high in
fat).
Standardised 25 km long walk. On the third day of the
testing block, subjects completed a 25 km walk, 2 h
after consuming a standardised breakfast. The training
session was conducted as a hybrid laboratory–field test,
with 0–1, 12–13 and 24–25 km being undertaken on
a treadmill in the laboratory and the remainder of the
walk completed outdoors on a loop course (�5 km) that
included two aid stations to allow nutritional support
to be received each �2 km as occurs in IAAF events.
Subjects completed the treadmill portions of the walk
at the speed corresponding to the second stage of the
submaximal walking test (12 or 13 km h−1), which
approximated their 50-km race pace. Expired gas was
collected during each treadmill segment for assessment
of RER to determine rates of substrate oxidation, and O2
uptake. Capillary blood was collected for measurement of
glucose, lactate and ketone concentrations immediately
prior to beginning the session, and upon completion
of each treadmill segment. HR and rating of perceived
exertion (RPE) were assessed at the end of each treadmill
section. Nutritional support for this session is summarised
in Fig. 1. In the pre-treatment trial, all subjects received a
standardisedCHO-richbreakfastproviding2gkg−1 CHO;
this same meal was provided to the HCHO and PCHO
group participants in the post-treatment trial. Meanwhile,
in the post-treatment trial, the LCHF group received an
isocaloric meal that was high fat, low CHO. During the
walk, handlers provided fluids and sports food choices
that had previously been discussed with each participant
to mimic race feeding practices. Participants were offered
sportsdrink,sportsgelsandconfectioneryitemstoachieve
an hourly intake of �600 ml of fluid and �60 g CHO in
the pre-treatment. In the post-treatment trial, the HCHO
and PCHO participants were provided with the same
choices as consumed in the first trial. Meanwhile, in the
post-treatment trial, the LCHF received non-caloric fluid
(water or artificially sweetened drinks) and fat-rich snacks
(cheese and cake/cookies made from high fat ingredients)
to match the energy intake from the first trial.
Blood metabolites. Capillarybloodsampleswereusedfor
this portion of the study to allow standardised collection
of samples in both laboratory and field conditions where
metabolites were to be assessed over the entire 4-week
intervention. Finger-tip samples were collected and
immediately processed for measurement of blood lactate
(Lactate Pro 2, Akray, Japan), ketones (β-hydroxybutyrate;
FreeStyle Optium Neo, Abbott Diabetes Care, Victoria,
Australia) and glucose (FreeStyle Optium Neo, Abbott
Diabetes Care, Victoria, Australia) concentrations. To
counter any individual differences in the accuracy of these
portable analysers, each participant was assigned to a
specific device for the duration of their involvement in
the study.
Calculation of respiratory exchange ratio and substrate
oxidation data. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was
calculated from steady-state expired gases collected over
1 min periods during the economy test, maximal aerobic
capacity protocol and portions of the 25 km standardised
walk. During the 25 km standardised walk, rates of CHO
and fat oxidation (g min−1) were calculated from ˙
VCO2
and ˙
VO2 values using non-protein RER values (Peronnet
& Massicotte, 1991). These equations are based on the
premise that ˙
VO2 and ˙
VCO2 accurately reflect tissue O2
consumption and CO2 production, and that indirect
calorimetry is a valid method for quantifying rates of sub-
strate oxidation in well-trained subjects during strenuous
exercise of up to �85% of ˙
VO2peak (Romijn et al. 1992).
We did not correct our calculations for the contribution
of ketone oxidation to substrate use in the LCHF trials
as we wished to directly compare our findings with other

recent reports of substrate utilisation in ultra-endurance
athletes who chronically consume LCHF diets (Volek et al.
2016; Webster et al. 2016). However, we acknowledge that
there may be a small (but systematic) error in the use of
conventionalequationstocalculatefatandCHOoxidation
from gas exchange information (Frayn, 1983).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using a general linear
mixed model using the R package lme4 (Bates et al.
2015; R Core Team, 2016) allowing for the unbalanced
design (i.e. cross-over of some subjects between camps
and unequal group sizes for diet intervention) and the
identified heterogeneity in the individual data (Jennrich &
Schluchter, 1986). Each dependent variable was included
in a mixed model with fixed effect for the diet inter-
vention, the race and the camp, including all two-way and
three-way interactions. In the random effects structure
of the model, we included a crossed random effect for
race and camp to account for heterogeneity in race
conditions, as well as a random intercept for the athletes
to account for the dependence in the data. Non-significant
higher order interactions were dropped from the model
for ease of interpretation. The normality assumption
of the linear mixed model was assessed visually using
QQ-plots of the model residuals. No obvious deviations of
normality were detected. Tests for statistical significance
of the fixed effects were performed using Type II Wald
tests with Kenward–Roger degrees of freedom. Ninety per
cent confidence intervals (CI) for the fixed effects were
calculated using parametric bootstrap.
Results
Diet and training compliance
All
participants
demonstrated
compliance
to
their
assigned dietary treatment and the monitoring of their
food intake and training sessions. Table 3 summarises the
results of the assessment of actual dietary intake, with
the summary of mean daily intakes allowing the display
of overall differences between diets. As intended, energy
(kJ kg−1 day−1) and protein (g kg−1 day−1 and % energy)
intake did not differ between dietary treatments. However,
daily fat (g kg−1 day−1 and % of energy) and CHO
(g kg−1 day−1 and % energy) intakes were significantly
skewed between the CHO-rich diets (HCHO and PCHO)
and the LCHF diet. Although mean daily intake of CHO
was similar between the HCHO and PCHO diets, the
breakdown associated with specific training days partially
illustrates the difference in its spread, due to the timing of
intake around training sessions designated as high and
low CHO availability. The deliberate but small energy
deficit permitted over the 4 weeks of intervention and
testing resulted in a similar change of body composition
across groups (mean loss of �1.4 kg of body fat; not
significant). While this would have contributed towards
an improvement in aerobic capacity and walking economy
(relative to BM) across all groups, we feel that energy
availability was preserved and standardised such that it
did not interfere with training adaptations or favour one
group over another.
Participants completed the 3-week training inter-
vention, with weekly volume totals showing a similar
overall training commitment between groups, although
participants in the LCHF group experienced greater
perception of effort throughout, often experiencing
substantial hardship or inability to complete sessions
as planned. Analysis of training quality and general
well-being during this training block are detailed
elsewhere (Ross et al. in review). Mean race walking
mileage for the HCHO group was 121, 127 and 103 km
and 351 (30) km week−1 for weeks 1–3 and total training,
respectively. Meanwhile, training loads for PCHO were
137, 132 and 107 km week−1 with a total of 377 (43)
km, while the LCHF group completed 112, 122 and
97 km week−1 for a total of 331 (56) km.
˙
VO2peak and economy testing
All race walkers participated in the graded economy and
˙
VO2peak testprotocols.Onewalker(fromthePCHOgroup)
reported pain associated with a previous injury at the end
of the fourth stage of the economy test and was withdrawn
from the subsequent assessment of this variable. Therefore
thesamplesizesforthesetestswere9,10and10forHCHO,
PCHO and LCHF, respectively, for the economy testing
phase, and 9, 9 and 10 for the ˙
VO2peak test. The results
of these tests are summarised in Table 4 (BM, HR, RER,
RPE and ˙
VO2peak data), Fig. 2 (O2 utilisation) and Fig. 3
(blood metabolites). At both testing times, there was an
increase in RER (F(3, 197) = 255.44, P < 0.001), ˙
VO2peak
(F(3, 193) = 1345.99, P < 0.001), HR (F(3, 188) = 519.27,
P < 0.001) and RPE (F(3, 196) = 209.76, P < 0.001)
associated with the increase in exercise intensities across
all stages of the economy test.
BM decreased over the 3 weeks of intensified training
and mild energy deficit, with losses being greater in the
LCHF and PCHO groups compared with HCHO (90%
CI: −1.89, −0.44 and −1.58, −0.24, respectively). ˙
VO2peak
during race walking increased in all three groups across the
training programme (F(1, 30) = 25.52, P < 0.001, 90% CI:
2.55, 5.20). When expressed in ml kg−1 min−1, the changes
from pre- to post-treatment were as follows: HCHO: 61.6
(90%CI:57.9,65.1)to66.2(63.7,68.8);PCHO:64.9(61.9,
67.9) to 67.0 (64.5, 69.6) and LCHF: 66.3 (63.9, 68.7) to
71.1 (69.3, 72.8). The peak aerobic capacity of the HCHO
group was lower than for the other two groups both pre-
and post-treatment (F(2, 24) = 4.44, P � 0.02).

Ketogenic diet impairs performance in elite race walkers
2795
Across the graded economy tests, there were significant
diet vs. test interactions for RPE and HR with the LCHF
group displaying higher values in the post-treatment trial
(F(2, 197) = 4.52, P = 0.01 and F(2, 162) = 50.13,
P < 0.001, respectively), indicating a higher metabolic
cost and perceived effort with this treatment compared
with baseline testing and the other diets (Table 4). There
was a significant decrease in post-treatment RER values in
theLCHFgroup(F(2,194)=172.79,P<0.001)compared
with the pre-treatment trial across the four economy
stages. Differences in pre- to post-treatment values for
HCHO and PCHO groups were minor. Concomitant with
the change in fuel utilisation, there was an increase in
the post-treatment values for absolute O2 cost of exercise
(l min−1) across the four economy test stages in the
LCHF group compared with HCHO (90% CI: 0.09, 0.20.
By contrast, the absolute O2 cost of exercise across the
economy test was reduced at the post-treatment trial in
PCHO compared with the HCHO group (−0.17, −0.05).
Separate analysis of characteristics at the completion of
the ˙
VO2peak test revealed an increase in absolute values
of O2 utilisation (l min−1) across the treatment period
in all trials (F(1, 31) = 5.79, P = 0.02). However, there
were differences in RER and HR as a result of the dietary
treatment: RER at the point of maximal aerobic capacity
in the post-treatment trial was lower than pre-treatment
in the LCHF group (F(2, 31) = 12.13, P < 0.001, 90% CI:
−0.12,−0.06). In addition, HR at this same point in the
post-treatment trial was lower than in the pre-treatment
trial for the HCHO and PCHO groups (F(2, 29) = 18.15,
P < 0.001, 90% CI: −10.35,−6.37 and −9.15, −5.04,
respectively).

and the O2 cost of exercise due to diet and/or training

the walking speeds of elite race walkers during a 50 km
event and 20 km event respectively). At the second stage
(12–13 km h−1), there was a significant increase in the
relative O2 cost of exercise (ml kg−1 min−1) in the LCHF
group in the post-treatment trial, while this remained
constantinthePCHOandHCHOgroups(F(2,31)=5.91,
P = 0.006). When expressed as a percentage of their
(increased) ˙
VO2peak, there was a significant reduction in
O2 utilisation at second stage speed in the HCHO and
PCHO groups at the post-treatment trial (90% CI: −8.48,
−2.19 and −5.55, 0.23, respectively). The interaction of
diet and training in the LCHF group was such that there
was no improvement in the fraction of ˙
VO2peak used to
walk at the second stage speed across the intervention.
The pattern was repeated in the results from the fourth
stage (14–15 km h−1) of the economy test in stronger
form: there was a significant increase in the relative O2
cost of exercise (ml kg−1 min−1) in the LCHF group in the
post-treatment trial, while this remained constant in the
PCHO and HCHO group (F(2, 31) = 16.67, P < 0.001).
When expressed as a percentage of the (increased) ˙
VO2peak,
O2 utilisation at the fourth stage speed was reduced in
the HCHO and PCHO groups at the post-treatment trial
(90% CI: −7.047, −2.55 and −5.18, −0.86, respectively),
but was maintained in the LCHF group.
Figure 3 summarises concentrations of metabolites
(glucose, lactate and ketones) in capillary blood samples
obtained during the economy test, representing resting
values after an overnight fast, and concentrations at
the end of each stage and at the conclusion of the
maximal aerobic capacity component. Blood glucose
concentrations increased from baseline values during
exercise, with an increase in exercise intensity being
associated with high blood glucose concentrations

F(4, 253) = 70.75, P < 0.001). Across all dietary
treatments, there was a decrease in blood glucose
concentrations across the training intervention such that
values in the post-treatment trials were lower than in the
pre-treatment trial (F(1,254) = 125.65, P < 0.001). Blood
lactate concentrations increased as exercise intensity was
increased across all dietary treatments (Resting, Steps 1,
2 < Steps 3, 4; F(4, 254) = 24,93, P < 0.001), with
similar patterns in both pre- and post-treatment trials.
Blood ketone levels were maintained at low concentrations
across the economy test for both pre- and post-treatment
trials with the HCHO and PCHO groups. However, the
post-treatment trial in the LCHF group was associated
with a significant increase in blood ketone concentrations
compared with the pre-treatment trial (F(8, 221) = 3.64,
P < 0.001). Elevated blood ketone concentrations were
found in the resting sample; these declined over the four
economy stages but still remained elevated in comparison
with the pre-treatment trial (Fig. 3). Blood ketone
concentrations were elevated in the post-treatment trial
in the LCHF group with no change in the other diet
groups (F(2, 25) = 19.59, P < 0.001). Blood glucose
concentrations were reduced in the post-treatment trial
in all groups (F(1, 24) = 17.26, P < 0.001), but there was
no difference in blood lactate concentrations between pre-
and post-treatment trials for any group.
10 km race
The study produced 26 data sets in which a race walker
competedina10kmracepreandposttheirallocatedinter-
vention. Data sets were not available for two participants
who sustained soreness or injury that prevented them
from competing in the appropriate race. Race data were
excluded from one participant (PCHO) who violated the
standardised training preparation by undertaking a very
long walk (30 km) on the day before the race. Race
performance data therefore represent n = 9, 8 and 9 for
HCHO, PCHO and LCHF, respectively. The 10 km race
walking events were held on the same synthetic outdoor
athletics track and were standardised for time of the day;
however, environmental conditions varied for each of the
races. In camp 1, conditions at the commencement of
Race 1 were 17°C, 85% relative humidity (RH) and wind
speed 1–1.5 m s–1 with gusts up to 2.5 m s–1, with those of
Race 2 being 20.5°C, 46% RH, 4 m s–1 with gusts to 8 m s–1.
In camp 2, conditions at the commencement of Race 1
were 28°C, 55% RH and wind speed: 0 m s–1, with those
of Race 2 being 18°C, 65% RH, and 0.6–1.5 m s–1 with
gusts to 3 m s–1. Differences in the race conditions were
accounted for in the statistical analyses of group results but
interfere with an interpretation of the results of individual
race walkers.
The participants raced competitively in these events
with finishing times for the post-intervention races
representing 103% (4%), 103% (2%) and 108% (9%) of
the life-time personal best times of walkers in the HCHO,
PCHO and LCHF groups, respectively. The race times of
four race walkers were faster than their personal bests
and in one case, represented a national record. Finishing
times for the pre-treatment (Race 1) and post-treatment
(Race 2) are summarised in Fig. 4. The HCHO and PCHO
groups completed Race 2 in a significantly faster time
than Race 1, showing 6.6% (90% CI: 4.1, 9.1%) and
5.3% (3.4, 7.2%) improvements in performance following
the 3-week diet and training intervention, respectively.
Differences in completion times between Race 1 and Race
2 in the LCHF group were not different, and although
a practical interpretation of this outcome is an unclear
effect on performance (mean change = 1.6% reduction in
performance; 8.5% impairment in performance to 5.3%
improvement), this reflects an interaction between race
conditions and the diet–training treatment.

from Race 2 in the LCHF group where they were higher

25 km walk (F(2, 129) = 46.01, P < 0.001) associated
with a gradual reduction in CHO (F(2, 129) = 45.01,
P < 0.001) and increase in fat oxidation over time (F(2,
129) = 33.59, P < 0.001) Across the session there was
an increase in RPE (F(2, 130) = 39.80, P < 0.001) and
HR (F(2, 114) = 10.87, P < 0.001) showing an increase
in the perceived effort and metabolic cost of exercise. O2
utilisation ( ˙
VO2 ml kg−1 min−1) also gradually increased
across the session (F(2, 129) = 10.12, P < 0.001).
Comparisons between trials and groups (Table 5)
showed trends for an increase in HR in the LCHF group
in the post-treatment trial (90% CI: 0.18, 14.25) and a
decrease in HR for the HCHO and PCHO groups (−9.81,
0.54 and −12.97, −0.13, respectively). RPE tended to
be greater in the LCHF group across both trials (−0.05,
2.18). Examination of the substrate utilisation data shows
a significant reduction in RER values (Table 5) in the
LCHF group in the post-treatment trial (−0.20, −0.16)
while there was no change from pre- to post-treatment
trials in the HCHO and PCHO groups. This finding was
accompanied by a concomitant increase in O2 utilisation
(expressed as ml kg−1 min−1) in the LCHF post-treatment
trial (Fig. 5). Figure 5 also demonstrates the context of
this change in O2 utilisation (Fig 5A and B); in the case
of the HCHO and PCHO groups, the diet-training inter-
vention was associated with a reduction (−8.44, −5.03),
and trend to a reduction (−8.74, −0.49), respectively,
in the percentage of maximal aerobic capacity needed to
sustain the speed of the training session. However, in the
case of the LCHF group, the increase in maximal aerobic
capacity achieved over the 3-week training period was
negated by the increased O2 cost of walking at the same
speed, such that the post-treatment session was conducted
atthesamepercentageof ˙
VO2peak asthepre-treatmenttrial.
Estimation of the rates of CHO and fat oxidation in the
25 km walk (Fig. 5C and D) showed a decrease in CHO
oxidation and a concomitant increase in fat oxidation
over the session (F(2, 129) = 45.01, P � 0.001 and F(2,
129) = 33.59, P < 0.001, respectively). However, substrate
utilisation was dramatically changed in the post-treatment
trial for the LCHF group, with a large reduction in CHO
oxidation rates (90% CI: −2.98, −2.47) and increase in
rates of fat oxidation (1.03, 1.23).
Figure 6 shows metabolites in capillary blood samples
collected immediately prior to and during the 25 km
walk session, which was undertaken post-meal and with
nutritional support according to dietary treatment. There
was a small decrease in blood glucose concentrations
(Fig. 6A) during the first 5 min of the session prior to the
intake of CHO; thereafter, blood glucose concentrations
were increased at 13 km (90% CI: 0.11, 1.53) followed
by a slight non-significant decline at 25 km (−0.13,
1.27). There was a time by treatment interaction whereby
blood glucose concentrations were maintained at lower
concentrations throughout the 25 km walk on the LCHF

Discussion
This is the first study of the effect of a ketogenic
low-CHO, high fat diet consumed during a period of
intensified training in elite athletes in which exercise
characteristics across the range of intensities at which
endurance
and
ultra-endurance
athletes
train
and
compete were investigated. The novel findings were as
follows. (1) Three weeks of intensified training and mild
energy deficit in already well-trained athletes increased
peak aerobic capacity, independent of dietary support.
(2) An LCHF diet was associated with the highest rates
of whole-body fat oxidation ever reported across exercise
of varying speeds or intensities. (3) The cost of a shift
in substrate oxidation (from CHO-based to fat-based
fuels) during exercise was an increased oxygen demand
for a given walking speed across velocities that translate
to real-life race performance in elite race walkers. (4) An
improvement in performance was achieved by training
and competing while consuming diets providing periodic
or chronic high CHO availability, but not with the LCHF
diet.
Our study was conducted over an �4-week period,
which included a 3-week period of intensified training.
Previous experience of undertaking training studies in
well-trained but lesser calibre endurance athletes (Lindsay
et al. 1996; Yeo et al. 2008a; Cox et al. 2010) has shown
this to be a sufficient time frame to induce detectable
perturbations in muscle metabolism and performance.
The exposure to the LCHF diet in the current investigation
comfortably exceeded the time frame shown to produce
robust cellular adaptations to ‘retool’ the muscle to
increase its capacity for fat oxidation (Burke et al. 2000,
2002; Carey et al. 2001; Cameron-Smith et al. 2003). For
example, in the case of a non-ketogenic high fat diet,
peak rates of fat oxidation occur in as little as 5 days
(Goedecke et al. 1999). However, in the case of the
ketogenic LCHF diet, where further adaptation occurs
to allow near-excusive reliance on fat-derived fuels, it

has been suggested that several weeks of exposure is
required before the fatigue and general loss of well-being
associated with such an extreme dietary shift abates
(Phinney et al. 1983). With regard to the periodisation of
CHO availability, we have recently shown in well-trained
but sub-elite triathletes that a 3-week intervention of
this type was able to produce performance improvements
compared with a more traditional diet of sustained high
CHO availability (Marquet et al. 2016). The current
study was limited to a tightly controlled intervention and
rigorously collected non-invasive measures of whole-body
metabolismandperformancetoallowustoworkwithelite
athletes in a training camp environment with field and
laboratory activities. Collectively, these factors give our
results ‘real-world’ credibility while also offering valuable
insights into this topical area of exercise science.
Our data show that the LCHF group experienced
changes in blood metabolites and substrate utilisation as
a result of their dietary treatment. There was a general
decrease in blood glucose concentrations at rest and
during exercise, while blood ketone (β-hydroxybutyrate)
concentrations were generally elevated within the range of
0.8–2.0mmoll−1.Respiratorygasexchangemeasurements
showed a substantial increase in whole-body rates of fat
oxidation and a concomitant reduction in CHO utilisation
during the graded economy test across the range of
walking speeds, as well as the sustained intensity 25 km
training session. Although we did not investigate the
mechanism(s) underpinning the increases in utilisation of
fat during exercise, previous studies on high fat diets from
our group and others have reported changes including
increases in intramuscular triglyceride (Yeo et al. 2008b),
an increase in hormone-sensitive lipase (Stellingwerff
et al. 2006), increases in the expression of fatty acid
translocase FAT/CD36 protein (Cameron-Smith et al.
2003) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase (Goedecke et al.
1999). Collectively, these changes suggest increases in fat
availability, mobilisation and transport activities within
the complex regulation of fat utilisation by the muscle.
Rates of fat oxidation were calculated during the 25 km
training session to allow comparison with results from
other studies of adaptation to low-CHO, high fat diets.
Ourpreviousresearchonshortterm(5days)adaptationto
a non-ketogenic low(er) carbohydrate (< 20% of energy),
high(er) fat (65% of energy) diet found whole-body rates
of fat oxidation of �60 and �70 μmol kg−1 min−1 in
well-trained cyclists during training sessions at 85% and
65% of ˙
VO2peak, respectively (Stepto et al. 2002). These
figures approximate to absolute rates of fat oxidation
of �1.3–1.5 g min−1 and represented a doubling of fat
utilisation in these cyclists compared with their sub-
strate use at the same exercise intensity on a high CHO
diet. Meanwhile, in the only other study involving the
ketogenic LCHF diet in endurance athletes (Phinney

a ketogenic (< 20 g day−1 CHO) high fat (85% of
energy) diet showed mean rates of fat oxidation of
�1.5 g min−1 while cycling at 62–64% ˙
VO2max following
an overnight fast. Other available data on the ketogenic
LCHF diet come from recently published cross-sectional
studies of ultra-endurance athletes who have self-selected
and self-reported long-term (> 6 months) adherence to
this dietary strategy. In one investigation (Webster et al.
2016), cyclists habituated for �13 months to an LCHF
diet (< 50 g day−1 or 10% of energy CHO; �70% of
energy from fat) sustained mean rates of fat oxidation
of 1.2 g min−1 during 2 h of cycling at �70% ˙
VO2max
compared with a gradual drift to 0.5 g min−1 by a matched
group of athletes who consumed diets providing higher
CHO availability. However, Volek and co-workers (2016)
reported the highest peak rates of fat oxidation in the
literature in elite ultra-distance triathletes/runners with a
mean adherence of 20 months to LCHF nutrition (�10%
energy from CHO, �70% energy from fat). These rates
(1.54 ± 0.18 vs. 0.67 ± 0.14 g min−1 occurring at �70%
vs. 55% ˙
VO2max) were measured during a graded protocol
involving short (2 min) exercise periods and attributed
to the duration of the adherence to the LCHF diet. These
same athletes were found to have fat oxidation rates of
1.21 vs. 0.76 g min−1 over 3 h of submaximal treadmill
running at 64% ˙
VO2max, following a pre-exercise meal
based on their habitual dietary intake (Volek et al. 2016).
In the current study, we observed sustained rates of fat
oxidation of �1.5 g min−1 in our elite race walkers,
reaching a peak of 1.57 ± 0.32 g min−1 towards the end
of 2 h of exercise undertaken at �80% ˙
VO2peak (50 km
race pace). These rates represent a 2.5-fold increase on
the pre-treatment values of 0.62 ± 0.32 g min−1. In some
individuals we observed peak fat oxidation rates exceeding
1.9 g min−1, and note they were achieved by adaptation
to the LCHF diet for only 3 weeks, in concert with a high
fat pre-exercise meal and further fat intake during the
session. Our findings confirm that remarkable alterations
in substrate utilisation can be achieved in well-trained
athletes; indeed, to the best of our knowledge, these are
the highest rates of fat oxidation reported. Moreover, they
may address the potential criticism that the current study
was too brief since it appears to have achieved the most
hallmarked feature of athletes who have ‘keto-adapted’ for
much longer periods.
Concomitant with the increased rates of fat oxidation,
there was a decrease in rates of CHO oxidation in the
LCHF group, as reported previously in studies in which
CHO intake was substantially reduced (Goedecke et al.
1999; Burke et al. 2000; 2002; Carey et al. 2001), or
restricted (Phinney et al. 1983; Volek et al. 2016; Webster
et al. 2016). Mechanisms for the down-regulation of
CHO metabolism include the reduced availability of
CHO substrate (e.g. reduced muscle glycogen stores,
lower plasma glucose concentrations and the absence of
exogenous intake of CHO during exercise). However, we
have previously found, at least in the case of adaptation
to a non-ketogenic low CHO diet, a reduction in
glycogenolysis during exercise, and a reduction in the
active form of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHa) at rest
and during exercise of both moderate- and supra-maximal
exercise, thus reducing the capacity for an oxidative fate
of CHO disposal even when the supply is adequate
(Stellingwerff et al. 2006). The reliance on measurements
of whole-body metabolism in the current study pre-
vents a more mechanistic investigation of the changes in
CHO storage and utilisation. However, the maintenance
of blood glucose concentrations, albeit at reduced levels,
and the increases in blood lactate concentrations during
the graded economy and aerobic capacity tests indicate
the presence of endogenous CHO stores despite minimal
CHO intake. Indeed, due to the importance of glucose
as a substrate for many tissues and a source of carbon
for biosynthesis and anaplerosis, humans can adapt to
conditions of food or CHO deprivation by synthesising
glucose from a variety of substrates and reducing CHO
oxidation (Soeters et al. 2012).
While one study of ultra-endurance athletes habituated
to an LCHF diet found little difference between that
and a high-CHO diet with regard to the storage and
subsequent utilisation of muscle glycogen while running
(despite paradoxical reductions in the rates of CHO
oxidation during exercise) (Volek et al. 2016), the majority
of observations of keto-adapted athletes have reported
modest reductions in resting muscle glycogen stores
and lower rates of utilisation during exercise (Phinney
et al 1983; Webster et al. 2016). Tracer technology
and muscle biopsies allowed Phinney and co-workers
(1983) to estimate that glycogen utilisation was reduced
4-fold, and blood glucose utilisation, 3-fold, during
moderate intensity (62–64% ˙
VO2max) cycling when cyclists
adapted to an LCHF diet, and they hypothesised that
gluconeogenesis (from glycerol, lactate, pyruvate and
gluconeogenic amino acids) was able to maintain blood
glucose concentrations and permit glycogen restoration
during recovery from exercise. Webster et al. (2016)
measured glucose kinetics at rest and during 2 h of
cycling at a slightly higher intensity (�70% ˙
VO2peak) and
showed that endogenous glucose production at rest and
during exercise in keto-adapted ultra-endurance athletes
was lower compared with athletes consuming higher CHO
diets. They hypothesised that this reduced endogenous
glucoseproductionwasduetoareductioninliverglycogen
breakdown that was not compensated for by an absolute
increase in gluconeogenesis (Webster et al. 2016) while
noting that although absolute rates of gluconeogenesis
were similar to those seen in fasted athletes with a
habitually high CHO intake, they now contributed a
greater proportion of body CHO stores, and possibly
came from different substrates (glycerol, preferentially

in the case of the LCHF group and lactate in the case
of the high CHO group). In the current study we can
only speculate on the exact nature of changes in CHO
utilisation and storage with the LCHF diet. Although we
recognise that plasma metabolite concentrations can mask
changes in the rates of appearance and disappearance,
high plasma lactate concentrations were observed after
the 10 km race and the test of peak aerobic capacity,
suggesting that the glycolytic fate of body CHO stores
was preserved in the face of significant reductions in CHO
oxidation.
In the present study, all groups of race walkers improved
their aerobic capacity by 3–7% following the intensified
training programme, independent of dietary intervention.
Despite this, and their enhanced capacity to oxidise fat
during higher intensity exercise, the race walkers in the
LCHF diet failed to gain the improvement in 10 km
race performance achieved by the HCHO and PCHO
groups. This is a crucial finding for both competitive
athletes and sports scientists, and the mechanisms under-
pinning the impairment of performance merit further
discussion. Other factors such as increased perception of
effort associated with exercise or effects of the reduced
quality of workouts during the training programme may
have contributed to the failure of the LCHF group to
improve race performance, but the effect of the LCHF
on the economy of race walking at speeds required
for competitive performance is of major interest. The
increased oxygen cost of ATP production from fat vs.
CHO oxidation is self-evident from stoichiometry and
has been known empirically for a century (Zuntz &
Schumburg 1901; Krogh & Lindhard, 1920). Indeed, since
the oxidative phosphorylation yield is higher when NADH
is the electron donor (3 coupling sites) compared with
FADH2 (2couplingsides),andCHOmetabolismproduces
a greater ratio of the reducing equivalents NADH/FADH2
than β-oxidation, CHO is able to produce a greater ATP
yield per unit of oxygen consumption despite the greater
ATP production per unit of substrate from fat (Leverve
et al. 2007). However, to the best of our knowledge,
this notion appears to have been largely ignored in
the recent discussions regarding LCHF and sports
performance.
In sports such as running, cycling, swimming and race
walking,theeconomyorefficiencyofenergytransfertothe
speed of movement is a key determinant of performance
(Joyner & Coyle, 2008). For example, although many elite
runners present with a high aerobic capacity, within a
homogeneous group, running economy (defined as the
relationship between oxygen consumption and running
velocity) at specific race paces is better correlated to
performance than ˙
VO2peak (Daniels & Daniels, 1992). In
the present study, the oxygen cost of race walking at speeds
approximating race pace in both 20 km events and the
50 km event was significantly increased with the LCHF
intervention. Indeed, in the LCHF group, this negated the
benefit of the training-induced increase in peak aerobic
capacity. In contrast, the athletes training and competing
with high CHO availability achieved a reduction in the
relative oxygen cost of walking, notably at the higher
velocity of the shorter event on their race programmes.
Others have also shown that the energy expenditure of
cyclingisreduced,andgrossefficiencyincreased,following
short-term consumption of a high-CHO compared with a
low-CHO diet (Cole et al. 2014). When exercise is under-
taken at a modest fractional utilisation of an athlete’s
aerobic capacity, there is opportunity to compensate for
a loss of economy by increasing oxygen uptake. However,
during activities conducted at or around an individual’s
lactate threshold, such compensation is not possible and
reduced ATP production from the available oxygen supply
will limit exercise capacity.
The previous studies of LCHF in trained populations
(Phinney et al. 1983; Volek et al. 2016; Webster et al.
2016) have examined exercise capacity at moderate
exercise intensities (60–70% ˙
VO2max) that are unrelated
to race pace in competitive endurance athletes (Hawley
& Leckey 2015). We have previously noted that the
discussion around LCHF and sports performance in
both lay and scientific media often shows a poor under-
standing of the exercise characteristics that are important
to competitive athletes (Burke, 2015; Hawley & Leckey
2015). For example, sports such as multi-stage road
cycling, triathlons and marathons are often described
as endurance and ultra-endurance events conducted at
sub-maximal exercise intensities; in fact, for competitive
athletes at least, the terrain, pacing strategies and tactical
elementsintheseeventsmeanthatbriefbutcriticalpartsof
the race, which often determine the outcomes (e.g. break-
aways, hill climbs, surges, sprint finishes), are conducted
at higher and often near maximal pace (Fernandez-Garcia
et al. 2000; Bentley et al. 2002; Tucker, 2016). In addition,
for many athletes, even the ‘background’ pace from which
these brief bursts are performed in endurance sports such
as the marathon requires high exercise economy and
a sustained use of a very high percentage of maximal
aerobic intensity (Joyner et al. 2011; Tucker, 2016). The
˙
VO2peak values (65–75 ml kg−1 min−1) measured in our
elite race walkers are not exceptionally high in relation
to values often cited for elite endurance runners and
cyclists, although consideration must be given to the time
of the season, the race walking test protocol and moderate
altitude of 600 m of the testing facility. Nevertheless, they
are comparable to values reported in other studies of inter-
national level male race walkers (Chwała et al. 2014) and
we note that our group included several of the world’s best
athletes in this Olympic sport. Importantly, our studies
show that performance in their events requires them to
compete (and undertake substantial amounts of training)
at a high percentage of their aerobic capacity where CHO

oxidation is the major fuel-generating pathway (Hawley &
Leckey, 2015).
The 20 km race walk requires mean velocities of
15.6 and 14.3 km h−1 to achieve the world record of
76:36 min and qualifying standard for the 2016 Rio
Olympics of 84 min, respectively. Indeed, even after the
period of intensified training, which improved the relative
economy of the HCHO and PCHO groups, walking
at a velocity approximating an individual’s personal
best race pace for the 20 km event within the graded
economy protocol required a fractional oxygen utilisation
of �85–90% ˙
VO2peak. The corresponding data for the
50 km event (world record of 3:32.33 (h:min.s) and
Olympic qualifying standard of 4:06 h are a mean race
pace of 14.1 and 12.2 km h−1, respectively. Among our
participants, walking at a velocity of 12–13 km h−1 to
approximate the 50 km race pace of at least the middle
calibre athletes in our group required �75% of their
increasedpost-trainingpeakaerobiccapacityinthegraded
economy test and 25 km standardised walk for the higher
CHO groups. However, it remained at a mean of �80%
˙
VO2peak of the LCHF group in the post-treatment walk. It
should also be noted that the mean 50 km race pace for
the top competitors in our group is higher than the stage
of the economy test at which we recorded these results
and therefore mean race pace is conducted at a higher
percentage of peak aerobic capacity, and key parts of the
race at even faster paces.
Other sources support the concept that adaptation to
a high fat diet impairs capacity/performance of sustained
higher intensity exercise via a down-regulation of CHO
oxidation. Indeed, Phinney et al. (1983) noted that
although chronic adaptation to an LCHF diet improved
fat oxidation to the point that capacity for moderate
submaximal exercise was ‘comparable to that observed
after a high CHO diet’, ‘the price paid for such extreme
conservation of CHO during exercise appears to be
a limitation on the intensity of exercise that can be
performed’. Havemann and colleagues (2006) found that
a 5 day fat-adaptation followed by restoration of CHO
availability on the day before and during a performance
permitted similar overall performance of a 100 km cycling
time-trial compared with a trial undertaken following a
chronic high CHO availability approach, including similar
performances of 4 km sprints (�80% peak power output)
interspersed within the time trial. However, when required
to undertake 1 km sprints at > 90% of peak power
output (�95% of ˙
VO2max) within the time-trial, there
was a significant decrease in power output despite the
maintenance of perceived effort and heart rate and an
increasedattempttorecruitmusclefibres(Havemannetal.
2006).
Another factor that has contributed to confusion
about the LCHF diet and sports performance is a
misunderstanding of the goal and outcomes of endurance
training. An increase in fat utilisation during exercise
is the most frequently discussed outcome of endurance
training in relation to muscle fuel (Holloszy & Coyle
1984). While there is a training-induced increase in rates
of fat oxidation during exercise undertaken at the same
absoluteintensity,itisperhapsnotwellappreciatedthatthe
fractional contribution of fat to the new (higher) workload
corresponding to the same relative intensity of the athlete’s
increased peak aerobic capacity remains essentially the
same (Bergman & Brooks, 1999). Indeed, another goal of
endurance training is to increases an athlete’s absolute
capacity to use CHO as a fuel substrate, via both
oxidative and oxygen-independent pathways (Hawley &
Leckie, 2015), and a more holistic understanding of the
ideal training programme is that it should enhance an
athlete’s capacity to utilise and integrate all of the body’s
range of energy-producing pathways, with special focus
on ways in which they become specifically limiting for
performance.
The training intervention in the current study is
representative of the periodised programme undertaken
by endurance athletes to include a variety of workouts
with different goals within a training phase. We attempted
to expand on this principle, by including a separate
arm of the study in which we manipulated CHO intake
around specific training sessions to better achieve the
adaptation and performance goals of the workout. For
example, within the weekly training cycle we matched
sessions featuring moderate intensity ‘recovery’ work with
practices such as training in a fasted state or training with
low glycogen concentrations to promote mitochondrial
biogenesis and up-regulation of fat oxidation (for review,
see Bartlett et al. 2015). We also coupled practices
to enhance CHO availability with sessions requiring
good performance of higher intensity exercise as well
as opportunities to practice race day CHO intake and
to increase capacity for gut tolerance and absorption of
CHO (Stellingwerff, 2013). However unlike the recent
study in which we undertook such a manipulation
in a 3-week training programme with well-trained
triathletes (Marquet et al. 2016), we failed to see
a benefit of this CHO periodisation over the inter-
vention in which all sessions were undertaken with
strategies aimed at achieving high CHO availability.
It is uncertain whether the lack of additional benefit
relates to the calibre of our athletes, the involvement
of our intervention in the base phase of the training
programme (where the increased training stimulus may
havealreadymaximisedtheadaptiveresponseandreduced
the capacity for differences due to CHO availability)
or the large training volumes (which might have
depleted CHO stores even in the face of the high CHO
intakes around training such that the actual differential
between the HCHO and PCHO interventions was
reduced).

Ketogenic diet impairs performance in elite race walkers
2805
There are a number of other elements raised in this
study that warrant further investigation. These include
a titration of exercise intensity and exercise economy
to find the pace at which the negative effects of the
LCHF on exercise economy become detectable, thus
differentiating the real-life sporting events and athletes for
which this represents an unsuitable practice. The potential
for keto-adaptation as a periodised rather than chronic
activity, and the time course of some elements of the
‘de-adaptation’ should also be considered. The effect of
a low carbohydrate intake on gut absorption of CHO is
worthy of merit since it is likely to be reduced, in the same
way that an increased intake can improve the capacity for
muscle use of exogenous CHO sources consumed during
long exercise (Cox et al. 2010). This is of importance
to the longer endurance events in which CHO intake
during the race provides a substantial fuel source and
is associated with enhanced performance (Stellingwerff
& Cox, 2014), and is relevant since popular advice to
athletes contemplating the use of LCHF practices includes
thepossibilitythatsomemaystillchoosetoconsumeCHO
during their competitive events. The role of ketones as a
muscle fuel source was not investigated in the current
study but is also of interest (Cox et al. 2016).
In conclusion, the results of the present study
showed that despite achieving substantial increases in
the capacity for fat oxidation during intense exercise,
chronic adaptation to a ketogenic low-CHO, high fat
diet impaired exercise economy and negated the trans-
fer of training-induced increases in aerobic capacity into
improved performance of a real-life endurance event in
elite athletes. In contrast, training with a diet rich in
carbohydrate and which provided either high or peri-
odised carbohydrate availability around training sessions
was associated with improved race outcomes.

Acknowledgements
Incredible commitment from the larger ‘Supernova’ team was
required for the successful completion of this study; these
include the research crew of Rebecca Hall, Emma Lindblom,
Carolina Castellanos, Michelle Minehan, Bronwen Charlesson,
Taryn Richardson (Food team), Jill Leckey, Rachel McCormick,
Peter Peeling, David Pyne, Philo Saunders, Alannah McKay,
Julia Bone, Bronwen Lundy, Reid Reale, Victor Vuong, Damian
Arazello (Laboratory team), Craig Hilliard, Daniel Coleman,
Alison Campbell (Athletics Australia), Stephan Praet, Sacha
and James Teh (Sports Medicine and Soft Tissue team),
Masashi Kasahara (language assistance) and Lynne Mercer
(administrative assistance). The support of colleagues and the
environment of the Australian Institute of Sport were crucial in
allowing a study of this magnitude to be tackled, but its inception
and implementation would have been impossible without the
support and insights of Jared and Claire Tallent. Finally, the
generosity and commitment to sports science of the Super-
nova race walkers cannot be underestimated. This study would
not have happened without their blood, sweat, tears and good
humour.
