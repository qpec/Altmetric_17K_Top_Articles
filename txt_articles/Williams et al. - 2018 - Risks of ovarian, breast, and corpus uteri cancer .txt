AbstrAct
Objective
To investigate the risks of ovarian, breast, and 
corpus uteri cancer in women who have had assisted 
reproduction.
Design
Large, population based, data linkage cohort study.
setting anD participants
All women who had assisted reproduction in Great 
Britain, 1991-2010, as recorded by the Human 
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).
interventiOns
HFEA fertility records for cohort members were linked 
to national cancer registrations.
Main OutcOMe Measures
Observed first diagnosis of ovarian, breast, and 
corpus uteri cancer in cohort members were compared 
with age, sex, and period specific expectation. 
Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated 
by use of age, sex, and period specific national 
incidence rates.
results
255 786 women contributed 2 257 789 person years’ 
follow-up. No significant increased risk of corpus 
uteri cancer (164 cancers observed v 146.9 cancers 
expected; SIR 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.95 
to 1.30) was found during an average of 8.8 years’ 
follow-up. This study found no significantly increased 
risks of breast cancer overall (2578 v 2641.2; SIR 
0.98, 0.94 to 1.01) or invasive breast cancer (2272 
v 2371.4; SIR 0.96, 0.92 to 1.00). An increased risk 
of in situ breast cancer (291 v 253.5; SIR 1.15, 1.02 
to 1.29; absolute excess risk (AER) 1.7 cases per 
100 000 person years, 95% confidence interval 0.2 
to 3.2) was detected, associated with an increasing 
number of treatment cycles (P=0.03). There was an 
increased risk of ovarian cancer (405 v 291.82; SIR 
1.39, 1.26 to 1.53; AER 5.0 cases per 100 000 person 
years, 3.3 to 6.9), both invasive (264 v 188.1; SIR 
1.40, 1.24 to 1.58; AER 3.4 cases per 100 000 person 
years, 2.0 to 4.9) and borderline (141 v 103.7; SIR 
1.36, 1.15 to 1.60; AER 1.7 cases per 100 000 person 
years, 0.7 to 2.8). Increased risks of ovarian tumours 
were limited to women with endometriosis, low parity, 
or both. This study found no increased risk of any 
ovarian tumour in women treated because of only 
male factor or unexplained infertility.
cOnclusiOns
No increased risk of corpus uteri or invasive breast 
cancer was detected in women who had had assisted 
reproduction, but increased risks of in situ breast 
cancer and invasive and borderline ovarian tumours 
were found in this study. Our results suggest 
that ovarian tumour risks could be due to patient 
characteristics, rather than assisted reproduction 
itself, although both surveillance bias and the 
effect of treatment are also possibilities. Ongoing 
monitoring of this population is essential.
Introduction
Assisted reproduction cycles usually involve exposure 
to supraphysiological levels of oestradiol, exogenous 
gonadotropins, and multiple ovarian punctures, all 
potentially carcinogenic.1 2 Most concern surrounds 
the risks of breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers 
after such exposures.3-16
Studies 
investigating 
breast 
cancer 
risks 
in 
women who underwent assisted reproduction are 
inconsistent.3-12 Although some studies have shown an 
increased risk,17 most studies do not show an overall 
increase of breast cancer in exposed women.3-8 10 
However, some suggest a possible increased risk within 
subgroups,8 9 including women treated at younger ages9 
and with multiple cycles.8 Most studies investigating 
endometrial cancer risk in exposed populations have 
not found a significant increased risk.3 4 6 7 18 However, 
most studies have provided very imprecise estimates

WhAt Is AlreAdy knoWn on thIs topIc
Risks of reproductive cancers in women who have undergone assisted 
reproduction procedures are uncertain
Some previous studies have suggested a possible increased risk of breast cancer 
in women treated at younger ages and with multiple cycles; previous studies 
investigating endometrial cancer risk are underpowered
Early studies suggested increased risks of ovarian cancer in these women, while 
more recent studies are more reassuring, although inconsistent, regarding any 
increase in borderline ovarian tumours
WhAt thIs study Adds
In this large population based study, endometrial cancer was not increased 
in women who had assisted reproduction in Great Britain in 1991-2010 when 
compared with the general population
The risk of breast cancer overall and of invasive breast cancer was not increased, 
but there was a small increased risk of in situ breast cancer
Increased risks of ovarian cancer, both invasive and borderline, were observed 
but limited to women with other known risk factors; these findings require further 
investigation

due to small sample size and few events.3 4 6 18 One 
study suggested an increased risk of endometrial 
cancer associated with exposure to gonadotrophins, 
commonly used as part of assisted reproductive 
technology.19 Some early studies investigating fertility 
drugs used alone, such as single agent oral clomifene, 
suggested increased risks of ovarian cancer.20 Others 
found no association between fertility drugs and 
ovarian cancer risk.21 Recent investigations into their 
use as part of assisted reproduction have generally 
been more reassuring, but remain inconsistent and 
at risk of bias.4 5 11 Some13 14 but not all studies6 have 
found an increase in borderline tumours.
Given previous inconsistent results, small study size, 
and lack of information on potential confounders, we 
undertook a population based linkage study in Britain 
to provide risk estimates for ovarian, breast, and 
corpus uteri cancer, in a cohort of over 266 000 women 
undergoing assisted reproduction, with information 
on potential confounders such as parity and infertility 
diagnosis.
Methods
study population
We defined assisted reproduction as “treatments 
or procedures that include in vitro handling of 
both human oocytes and sperm or embryos, for the 
purpose of reproduction.”22 Records for all women 
undergoing assisted reproduction from January 1991 
to September 2009, and those undergoing the same 
from October 2009 to December 2010 who gave their 
prospective consent, in England, Wales, and Scotland 
were obtained from the Human Fertilisation and 
Embryology Authority (HFEA).
UK law mandates reporting of all assisted 
reproduction cycles to the HFEA. For cycles performed 
before October 2009, research use of these data 
was permitted, but consent could be withdrawn 
retrospectively. Fewer than 300 women had done 
so before this study began (based on the level of 
reporting detail provided by the HFEA). The study 
cohort, January 1991 to September 2009, therefore 
represents about 99.7% of the at-risk population. For 
cycles performed October 2009 onwards, prospective 
consent was required. Overall consent was not 
provided for an estimated 7% of women undergoing 
assisted reproduction in 1991-2010 (about 20 000 
women, based on reports from the HFEA), who were 
therefore not included in this study, representing a loss 
of less than 1% of person years’ follow-up (figure S1, 
supplementary appendix).
Outcome data
HFEA records were linked to the National Health 
Service Central Registers of England, Wales, and 
Scotland (from which emigrations, deaths, and cancer 
registrations are reported to authorised medical 
researchers) in a one-off linkage. Completeness and 
accuracy of these registers have been described.23-25 
Overall, records of 266 787 (95.1%) eligible women 
were linked (box S1 and figure S1, supplementary 
appendix). Cancer diagnosis date, topography code 
(ICD-9/ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 
9th and 10th revisions)), morphology (ICD-O-2/
ICD-O-3 (international classification of diseases for 
oncology, second and third revisions)), and behaviour 
(ICD-O-2/ICD-O-3) were available where an incident 
cancer was diagnosed. Women with cancer diagnoses 
(including non-melanoma skin cancer) recorded before 
the first treatment year were excluded from analyses. 
We obtained data relating to potential confounding 
factors such as infertility diagnosis, parity (as recorded 
at last treatment cycle completion), and treatment 
details (including number of stimulated cycles and 
age at first treatment) for each cohort member from 
the HFEA database. These data are a combination of 
patient reported and clinic reported information (table 
S1). Information regarding infertility diagnoses are 
reported to the HFEA by assisted reproduction clinics, 
based on investigations undertaken by that clinic; by 
the referring clinician; or occasionally by patient self 
report.
statistical analyses
Follow-up was calculated from date of first treatment 
(estimated as the mid-point of the first treatment 
year) until the date of any cancer diagnosis, death, 
emigration, or study end (March 2011), whichever 
came first. For analyses involving number of cycles, 
infertility duration, and live and multiple births, 
person years at risk were calculated from date of last 
treatment (estimated as mid-point of the last treatment 
year), because the HFEA did not record intermediate 
dates required for time dependent analysis. To 
calculate expected cancers, we multiplied the person 
years at risk by corresponding national incidence rates 
(by 5 year age band and individual calendar year) for 
the general female population of England and Wales. 
Standardised incidence ratios were calculated by 
the comparison of observed values with expected 
values. We calculated 95% confidence intervals, 
two sided P values, and trends assuming a Poisson 
distribution.26 Sensitivity analyses excluded the 
first 12 months of follow-up, to investigate potential 
surveillance bias in the period immediately following 
assisted reproductive treatment (which could arise as 
a result of treatment and or after-care; supplementary 
appendix). Absolute excess risks represent an estimate 
of the increased risk in the study group as compared 
with the general population and gives a direct measure 
of excess risk. They are presented per 100 000 person 
years, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, 
based on exact confidence intervals for Poisson counts. 
Analyses were performed using Stata, version 12.27
patient involvement and study approval
Representatives from patient support groups were 
consulted on the original research question, design, 
and planning of this study. Approval of the study 
and waiver of the requirement for individual consent 
were obtained from the UK Health Research Authority

results
characteristics of study participants
In total, 255 786 women contributed 2 257 789 person 
years’ follow-up. Average follow-up was 8.8 years 
(range 1-19 years), with 105 436 (41%) followed 
for at least 10 years. Average age at first treatment 
was 34.5 years. Infertility cause involved at least one 
female factor in 111 658 women (44%; including 
endometriosis, ovulatory disorders (predominantly 
polycystic 
ovary 
disease), 
and 
tubal 
disease). 
Infertility was unexplained in 47 757 (19%) women, 
and was due only to male factors in 84 871 (33%). 
Average infertility duration was 4.9 years. Women 
had 1.8 stimulated cycles on average, with only 20% 
(n=50 485) having more than two stimulated cycles. 
About half the study population had at least one live 
birth after treatment completion (table 1).
breast cancer
There was no overall increased risk of breast 
cancer (2578 observed v 2641.2 expected cancers; 
standardised incidence ratio 0.98 (95% confidence 
interval 0.94 to 1.01); absolute excess risk −2.8 cases 
per 100 000 person years (95% confidence interval 
−7.1 to 1.8); table 2). More than three quarters 
(76%) of tumours were ductal carcinomas (n=1963), 
9% lobular (n=228), 12% other epithelial tumours 
(n=319), and 3% non-epithelial or unspecified (n=68). 
There were no significantly raised risks in groups by 
age at first treatment, infertility duration, number of 
stimulated cycles, number of live births, and number 
of multiple births (table 3). 
We found significant risk reductions with increasing 
duration since treatment completion (P=0.01; table 
3), and in women with any female factor or only male 
factor infertility (table 3), but no difference between 
risks at premenopausal and postmenopausal ages 
separately (age <50 years, standardised incidence 
ratio 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.02); 
≥50 years, 0.97 (0.89 to 1.06); data not shown). After 
exclusion of the first 12 months of follow-up, breast 
cancer risk was significantly reduced compared with 
age standardised expectation (standardised incidence 
ratio 0.95 (0.92 to 0.99), P=0.02; supplementary 
appendix ). There was no increased risk of invasive 
breast cancer (standardised incidence ratio 0.96 
(0.92 to 1.00); absolute excess risk −4.4 cases per 
100 000 person years (95% confidence interval −8.5 
to −0.2); table 4), but a small increased risk of in situ 
breast cancer (291 cancers observed v 253.5 cancers

expected, standardised incidence ratio 1.15 (1.02 to 
1.29); absolute excess risk 1.7 cases per 100 000 person 
years (0.2 to 3.2); table 4), which was associated with 
the number of treatment cycles (P=0.03). Exclusion of 
the first 12 months of follow-up did not substantially 
change results for in situ breast cancer risk (table S5, 
supplementary appendix).
carcinoma of the corpus uteri
Risk of corpus uteri cancer was not significantly raised 
(standardised incidence ratio 1.12 (95% confidence 
interval 0.95 to 1.30); absolute excess risk 0.8 cases 
per 100 000 person years (95% confidence interval 
−0.3 to 2.0); table 2). Over 92% (n=152) of corpus 
uteri tumours were epithelial, 70% (n=107) of 
which were endometrioid; 8% were non-epithelial or 
unspecified (n=12). We found a significantly increased 
risk of corpus uteri cancer in women with an ovulatory 
disorder (standardised incidence ratio 1.59 (1.13 to 
2.17); table 3). There was a highly significant trend 
of increasing risk with decreased parity (P<0.001), 
and a significantly decreased risk with women having 
a multiple birth (standardised incidence ratio 0.42 
(0.14 to 0.99); table 3). No significant variation in 
risk was noted with number of cycles (P=0.93), age at 
first treatment (P=0.28) or duration since treatment 
completion (P=0.12). Exclusion of the first 12 months 
of follow-up did not substantially change results (table 
S3, supplementary appendix).
Ovarian cancer
An overall increased risk of ovarian cancer was 
observed in our study population (standardised 
incidence ratio 1.39 (95% confidence interval 1.26 
to 1.53); absolute excess risk 5.0 cases per 100 000 
person years (95% confidence interval 3.3 to 6.9); table 
2). Increased risks were seen across most age groups at 
first treatment, but there was a highly significant trend 
of increasing risk with decreasing age at first treatment 
(P<0.001; table 3). Significantly increased risks were 
found in women who had any diagnosis of female 
factor infertility (standardised incidence ratio 1.66 
(1.46 to 1.88)), particularly endometriosis (2.31 (1.74 
to 3.01)) or tubal disease (1.68 (1.43 to 1.97); table 3). 
No increased risk was seen where infertility was male 
factor only (standardised incidence ratio 1.05 (0.85 to 
1.27)) or unexplained (0.96 (0.69 to 1.31); table 3). 
There was a significant trend of decreasing risk with 
increasing number of live births (P=0.001), and women 
remaining nulliparous after treatment completion 
conferred the highest risk (standardised incidence 
ratio 1.57 (1.37 to 1.79); table 3). No increased risk 
was seen with increasing infertility duration (P=0.15), 
number of cycles (P=0.86), or duration since treatment 
completion (P=0.74). Exclusion of the first 12 months 
of follow-up did not substantially change results (table 
S3, supplementary appendix).
When tumours were classified as invasive or 
borderline, significant excesses of both were noted 
(264 observed v 188.1expected cancers, standardised 
incidence ratio 1.40 (95% confidence interval 1.24 
to 1.58), absolute excess risk 3.4 cases per 100 000 
person years (95% confidence interval 2.0 to 4.9) and 
141 v 103.7, 1.36 (1.15 to 1.60), 1.7 cases per 100 000 
person years (0.7 to 2.8), respectively; table 4).
invasive ovarian tumours
There was a significant trend of increasing risk 
of invasive ovarian tumours with decreasing age 
at first treatment (P=0.02; table 4). Significantly 
increased risks were detected in women who had any 
diagnosis of female factor infertility (standardised 
incidence ratio 1.66 (95% confidence interval 1.41 
to 1.94)), particularly endometriosis (2.47 (1.75 to 
3.39)) or tubal disease (1.71 (1.40 to 2.08); table 4). 
Risk significantly decreased with increasing parity 
(P=0.001), and women nulliparous after treatment 
completion were at greatest risk (1.67 (1.42 to 1.95); 
table 4). We saw no significant variation in risk 
with number of cycles (P=0.29), infertility duration 
(P=0.25), or duration since treatment completion 
(P=0.44), nor was risk raised in women treated for 
male factor only infertility (1.09 (0.84 to 1.39); table 
4). A third of invasive ovarian tumours were serous 
(n=87), 25% endometrioid (n=66), 8% mucinous 
(n=22), 17% other or unspecified epithelial tumours 
(n=45), and 17% non-epithelial or unspecified (n=44). 
Exclusion of the first 12 months of follow-up did not 
substantially change results (table S4, supplementary 
appendix).

borderline ovarian tumours
Significantly increased risks of borderline ovarian 
tumour was associated with decreasing age at first 
treatment (P<0.001) and any diagnosis of female 
factor infertility (standardised incidence ratio 1.66 
(95% confidence interval 1.33 to 2.05)), particularly 
endometriosis (2.03 (1.18 to 3.25)) or tubal disease 
(1.62 (1.21 to 2.12); table 4). Risk did not change 
significantly with number of cycles (P=0.18), parity 
(P=0.34), infertility duration (P=0.42), or duration 
since treatment completion (P=0.84), nor was 
risk raised in women treated for male factor only 
infertility (0.96 (0.66 to 1.35); table 4). Close to half 
of borderline tumours were serous (n=64), 34% 
mucinous (n=48), less than 2% endometrioid (n<5), 
less than 2% other or unspecified epithelial tumours 
(n<5), and 18% non-epithelial or unspecified (n=25). 
Exclusion of the first 12 months of follow-up reduced 
the risk of borderline ovarian tumours (1.19 (0.98 to 
1.43); table S4, supplementary appendix) and risk in 
relation to endometriosis (1.57 (0.81 to 2.73); table 
S4, supplementary appendix).
Ovarian cancer risk stratified by risk factors
Parous women who did not have a diagnosis of 
endometriosis did not have an increased risk of ovarian 
cancer overall (standardised incidence ratio 1.03 (95% 
confidence interval 0.86 to 1.22)), invasive tumours 
(1.03 (0.82 to 1.27)), or borderline tumours (1.02 
(0.75 to 1.35); table 5). Risks of all types of ovarian 
cancer were raised in nulliparous women who did not 
have a diagnosis of endometriosis but to a lesser extent 
than in parous women with endometriosis (table 5). 
Women who were nulliparous with a diagnosis of 
endometriosis had greater risk of invasive ovarian 
tumour (2.64 (1.69 to 3.93); table 5) than women with 
just one of these risk factors. By contrast, nulliparous 
women with endometriosis had no significant risk of 
a borderline tumour (1.47 (0.59 to 3.04)), although 
nulliparity and endometriosis were each separately 
associated with increased risk (table 5). The significant 
association between decreasing age at first treatment 
and increasing risk of invasive ovarian tumour was 
present in women with at least one of endometriosis or 
nulliparity (P<0.001), but not in those without either

discussion
Assisted reproduction is practiced worldwide, and 
more than five million children have been born as a 
result.28 It is important to establish related disease 
risks for affected individuals, public health systems, 
and for counselling of potential patients. In this 
large population based cohort, we found no overall 
increased risk of breast cancer associated with assisted 
reproduction, consistent with most3-10 but not all12 
published studies. We found no significant association 
between the risk of breast cancer and age at first 
treatment, in contrast to a small number of earlier 
studies.8 9 29 Reasons for significant decreases in breast 
cancer risk seen in some subanalyses—such as women 
who had assisted reproduction for female factor 
infertility—are unclear, but could reflect beneficial 
levels of lifestyle related risk factors for breast cancer.30 
31 However, details of these risk factors and also age at 
first birth were not available. 
Menopausal status did not seem to account for the 
significant reduction in risk with increasing follow-up. 
Despite no increased risk of invasive breast tumours, 
there was a significant increase in in situ tumours 
which was significantly associated with increasing 
number of stimulated cycles. Interpretation of these 
findings is challenging: the significant association 
with increasing number of cycles suggests a causal 
association, yet there was no overall increased risk of 
breast cancer. Other potential explanations include 
surveillance bias, chance, and potential confounding 
by factors such as socioeconomic status, given that 
most cycles within our cohort were privately funded. 
To our knowledge, this study is the first to analyse risks 
of in situ and invasive breast cancers after assisted 
reproduction separately, so there are no previous data 
with which to compare.
Risk of corpus uteri cancer overall was not raised 
in our study. Women with the known risk factor of 
nulliparity32 and those with a history of ovulatory 
problems (mainly the known risk factor polycystic 
ovary disease33) were found to have an increased risk 
of corpus uteri cancer. Most similar studies contained 
few events.3 5 6 The largest studies included 154 and 49 
cases7 of endometrial cancer in women after assisted 
reproduction, and neither suggested an increased risk.
We found an excess of ovarian cancer compared with 
age standardised expectation. Significant increases 
were observed for both invasive and borderline tumours, 
but were not seen in women without the known risk 
factors of endometriosis34 35 and nulliparity.35 Ovarian 
cancer risks were not associated with number of 
treatment cycles, time since treatment completion, 
or male factor or unexplained infertility, which 
argues against a causal role for assisted reproduction 
procedures. However, we did find a significant 
association between age at first treatment and risk of 
all, invasive, and borderline ovarian cancers. Previous 
studies investigating invasive ovarian tumour risk 
after assisted reproduction3-711 13 15 16 have generally 
found increased risks in comparison with the general 
population when potential confounding effects of 
infertility have not been considered,16 but not when 
such factors were taken into account.3 4 11 16 While 
our study compared cancer incidence with that in the 
general population (standardised for age and calendar 
year), it had sufficient size to stratify by potential 
confounding factors and thereby to investigate 
characteristics of associations. We found an increased 
risk of borderline ovarian tumour in women having 
assisted reproduction compared with the general 
population. As with invasive ovarian tumours, this 
increased risk was not seen in parous women without 
endometriosis. Few studies have investigated the risk 
of borderline ovarian cancer in women after assisted 
reproduction,6 13 14 but increased risks have been 
found in studies in the Netherlands13 and Australia.14
Although the increased risk in borderline ovarian 
cancer in women with assisted reproduction could 
be genuine, it could also be due to surveillance bias. 
The frequency of borderline tumour diagnosis is 
increased in ovarian cancer screening studies using 
ultrasound,36 and women who have undergone assisted 
reproduction might have more frequent ultrasound 
scans after treatment than the general population. This 
potential bias is supported by the reduction in overall 
risk after we excluded the first 12 months of follow-
up. However, sensitivity analyses looking at time to 
diagnosis, age at diagnosis, diagnosis in women of 
high socioeconomic status, and clinical presentation 
in other studies suggested surveillance bias an unlikely 
cause of increased risks.13 14 We are not able to further 
differentiate surveillance bias from a genuine increase 
in borderline tumours. Women with unrecorded 
cause of infertility had significantly increased rates of 
breast, ovarian, and corpus uteri cancers. Reasons are 
unclear but might include reverse causality (box S2, 
supplementary appendix).
strengths and limitations of the study
Most studies investigating risks of cancer in women 
after assisted reproduction have been small,6 8 with 
few events and short follow-up.4-7 Two of the largest 
studies published so far include 67 6084 and 113 2267 
women treated with assisted reproduction. Systematic 
reviews have included at most 70 753 treated women 
for analyses of breast cancer risk,10 79 143 for 
ovarian cancer risk,16 and 118 320 for analysis of all 
gynaecological cancer risk.37 Our study comprised 
over 250 000 treated women, including almost 
65 000 person years of follow-up for at least 15 years 
beyond last treatment with an average follow-up of 
8.8 years and a maximum follow-up of 19 years (table 
S2, supplementary appendix). However, we cannot 
exclude the possibility of different risk profiles for any 
studied cancer on longer follow-up, at ages when most 
reproductive related cancers occur.35
Women treated with assisted reproduction are 
likely to differ from the general population in their 
parity, age at first birth, age at menopause, and

the incidence of predisposing conditions such as 
endometriosis. More information on these and other 
factors (eg, socioeconomic status, oral contraceptive 
use, body mass index, and breastfeeding) would 
be useful. Comparison to women with untreated 
infertility problems might have been beneficial, 
although interpretational problems would remain 
because of potential selection factors for treatment. 
Although our study was not able to compare with 
such a group as some smaller studies have done,4 
13 14 large study size enabled us to stratify for 
some important potential confounders and draw 
inferences despite using general population rates as 
our comparator. While comparator rates do include 
cohort participants, less than 5% of the population 
of reproductive age women underwent assisted 
reproduction, and our standardised incidence ratios 
were generally lower than 2.0; therefore, resulting 
bias will have been minimal.38
Infertility diagnoses were reported by treating fertility 
clinics to the HFEA. No data were available about how 
such diagnoses were made. Further details of specific 
treatments could have enabled detailed analysis of risk 
by treatment type. However, over our 19 year study 
period, ovarian stimulation regimens as part of assisted 
reproductive cycles have been relatively constant, with 
the majority of advances leading to better success rates 
having occurred in assisted reproduction laboratories. 
Gonadotrophin injections have been used for ovarian 
stimulation and human chorionic gonadotropin for 
triggering ovulation throughout the study period, 
and while new highly purified and recombinant 
versions have been used in more recent years, they 
are essentially equivalent. Clomifene citrate was used 
as additional ovarian stimulation in the pioneering 
years of assisted reproduction treatment, but this was 
uncommon by 1991. Downregulated cycles using 
GnRH (gonadotrophin releasing hormone) agonists 
were standard by 1991 and not replaced by GnRH 
antagonists as standard until after the study period. 
Progesterone support was used throughout the study 
period. The number of ovarian punctures per cycle and 
information about fertility treatment before assisted 
reproduction were not available.
conclusions and implications
In this large, national population based study of 
British women after assisted reproductive technology 
treatment, no increased risk of corpus uteri or invasive 
breast cancer was detected. There was an increased 
risk of in situ breast cancer associated with increasing 
number of treatment cycles. We also observed an 
excess of all types of ovarian cancer. However, our 
results suggest that this finding is more likely due to 
underlying patient characteristics, rather than assisted 
reproduction itself. We were not able to distinguish 
between a genuine increase in risk of borderline ovarian 
tumours and other explanations including surveillance 
bias. Further investigation of this and longer follow-up 
is warranted to continue monitoring these important 
outcomes in this ever growing population.
