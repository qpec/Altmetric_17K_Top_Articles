Abstract
 Objective—Neighborhood greenspace improves mental health of urban-dwelling populations, 
but its putative neurobehavioral benefits in adolescents remain unclear. We conducted a 
prospective study on urban-dwelling adolescents to examine the association between greenspace in 
residential neighborhood and aggressive behaviors.
 Method—Participants (n = 1,287) of the Risk Factors for Antisocial Behavior Study, a multi-
ethnic cohort of twins and triplets born in 1990–1995 and living in Southern California, were 
examined in 2000–2012 (aged 9 to 18 years) with repeated assessments of their aggressive

 behaviors by the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist. Normalized Difference Vegetation 
Index (NDVI) derived from satellite imagery was used as a proxy for residential neighborhood 
greenspace aggregated over various spatiotemporal scales prior to each assessment. Multilevel 
mixed-effects models were used to estimate the effects of greenspace on aggressive behaviors, 
adjusting for within-family/within-individual correlations and other potential confounders.
 Results—Both short-term (1- to 6-months) and long-term (1- to 3-years) exposures to 
greenspace within 1,000-meters surrounding residences were associated with reduced aggressive 
behaviors. The benefit of increasing vegetation over the range (~0.12 in NDVI) commonly seen in 
urban environments was equivalent to approximately 2 to 2.5 years of behavioral maturation. 
Sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status) and 
neighborhood quality did not confound or modify these associations, and the benefits remained 
after accounting for temperature.
 Conclusion—Our novel findings support the benefits of neighborhood greenspace in reducing 
aggressive behaviors of urban-dwelling adolescents. Community-based interventions are needed to 
determine the efficacy of greenspace as a preemptive strategy to reduce aggressive behaviors in 
urban environments.

 INTRODUCTION
According to the World Health Organization, violence is one of the leading causes of death 
among 15–44 year olds and is a major global public health issue worldwide. High rates of 
crime and violence prevail in urban areas, and urban residence is a well-documented risk 
factor for various mental illnesses. Currently, half of the world’s population resides in urban 
environments, and this proportion is expected to increase by 20% over the next 35 years.
Identifying effective measures to reduce violence has become a pressing issue facing 
societies today, and studying the associated environmental risk factors, especially those 
modifiable among vulnerable populations, may help inform early intervention strategies.
Aggression during childhood is a strong indicator of developmental processes gone awry 
and manifests into more serious adverse behaviors such as violence and crime. Aggressive 
behavior is also a key precursor to many mental illnesses, including antisocial personality 
disorder. Although genetic factors are important causes of aggressive behaviors, 
environment also accounts for 50% of its total variance. Previous studies in urban-dwelling 
populations have primarily focused on social environmental determinants, but whether and 
how the physical characteristics of urban environments affect aggressive behaviors are not 
well understood. In search of modifiable physical environmental factors predictive of 
aggressive behaviors, we only found scant literature suggesting possible adverse effects of 
air pollution,– meteorological factors,– and neighborhood noise. The beneficial impacts of 
greenspace have become increasingly recognized by public health advocates, and clinicians 
have started prescribing exposure to greenspace as a natural treatment for various physical 
and mental illnesses. Greenspace has the ability to improve overall wellbeing, decrease

 stress levels, and reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder.– However, no previous studies have examined whether greenspace could reduce 
aggressive behaviors in urban-dwelling adolescents.
Adolescence is a critical period of neural development marked by increased connectivity and 
interaction between areas of the brain. Many functional and structural changes in the 
prefrontal lobe occur during this time, which are accompanied by cognitive and behavioral 
maturation. This phase of rapid change and growth is a crucial time for shaping behavioral 
trajectories and is a vulnerable period during which developmental processes may be easily 
disrupted. As a result, adolescents are an important population to target for early 
intervention of aggressive behavior, and identifying modifiable environmental factors in 
urban areas should be of interest. This study aims to examine the potential association 
between residential neighborhood greenspace and aggressive behaviors in adolescents 
residing in urban areas of Southern California.
 METHOD
 Study Design
Participants were drawn from the Risk Factors for Antisocial Behavior (RFAB) twin study 
based at the University of Southern California. RFAB is a prospective study of the interplay 
of genetic, environmental, social, and biological factors on the development of antisocial 
behavior from childhood to early adulthood. Participating families were recruited from Los 
Angeles County and surrounding areas, representative of the ethnic and socioeconomic 
diversity of the greater Los Angeles area. This ongoing cohort study includes over 780 
monozygotic and dizygotic (same-sex and opposite-sex) twin pairs and triplets born between 
1990–1995 and aged 9–10 years at study enrollment in 2000. The present study used data 
collected with up to 4 occasions of longitudinal assessments from childhood to adolescence. 
Zygosity status was determined using DNA microsatellite analysis. Further details on study 
protocol and procedures are described elsewhere., The current analyses used data from 1,287 
individuals (of 640 families), including 276 monozygotic and 364 dizygotic twin pairs, who 
had at least two assessments of aggressive behaviors at ages 9–18, provided residential 
addresses during follow-up, and were part of complete twin or triplet sets (Figure 1)
 Behavioral Assessment
Aggressive behaviors over the preceding six months were assessed with the parent-reported 
version of the widely used Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6–18). The high reliability and 
validity of the CBCL has been reported elsewhere. In clinical settings, the CBCL provides a 
cost-efficient measure of broad constructs of psychopathology. The Aggressive Behavior 
subscale consists of 20 items regarding both physical (e.g., gets in many fights, destroys 
things, physically attacks and threatens others, etc.) and verbal (e.g., argues, teases, screams, 
etc.) forms of aggression. Each item was coded and scored on a three-point scale (0 = not 
true; 1 = sometimes true; and 2 = very true/often true),, and a continuous raw score was 
calculated by summing across items. The validity of the aggressive behavior syndrome in 
predicting or identifying individuals with clinically defined oppositional defiant disorder 
(with or without conduct disorder) has been documented. In the RFAB study cohort, the

 CBCL was administered at each wave with a relatively high internal consistency (average 
Cronbach’s Alpha across waves: α = 0.873).
 Environmental Exposure Data
 Residential Location Data and Geocoding—All residential addresses prospectively 
collected from the study inception and throughout follow-up were sent to the geocoding 
services provided by the University of Southern California (USC) Spatial Sciences Institute, 
which followed standard procedures and returned high-quality geocodes (exact parcel 
location or specific street segments for 98.6% of our sample). The remaining addresses were 
geocoded satisfactorily with Google Earth based on visual acceptance. The geographic 
distribution of RFAB residential locations at baseline in relation to neighborhood greenspace 
and aggressive behavior scores is presented in Figure S1 (available online). The figure 
reveals there were no distinctive spatial patterns relating to the two extreme exposure-
outcome contrasts.
 Residential Neighborhood Greenspace—We assessed neighborhood greenspace 
surrounding residences using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived 
from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at 250-meter resolution. 
NDVI is calculated as the ratio of visible red and near-infrared reflectance, whereby land 
surfaces with greener vegetation reflect more near-infrared and absorb more visible red 
wavelength. We requested a batch download of all 16-day time-series data for the US 
Southwest region spanning February 2000 to December 2012 from the Global Agriculture 
Monitoring Project. NDVI values were normalized between 0 and 1, reflecting the range 
from very sparse to dense vegetation. Neighborhood greenspace was abstracted as the 
average of NDVI in buffers of 250-, 350-, 500-, and 1000-meters around each residence. 
Within each defined residential neighborhood, the 16-day time-series NDVI data were then 
aggregated to represent the time-varying average NDVI estimates of short-term (1-, 3-, and 
6-month) and long-term (1-, 2-, and 3-year) exposures preceding each CBCL assessment 
(for more details see Supplement 1, available online).
 Relevant Covariate Data
A directed acyclic graph (DAG) was used to select potential covariates (see Figure S2, 
available online) known to predict aggressive behavior and likely influence where people 
lived (and thus their exposure to greenspace), including age, gender, self-reported race/
ethnicity (Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Mixed, or Other), socioeconomic status (SES), and 
perceived neighborhood quality. Other covariates potentially correlated with greenspace, as 
evaluated by the DAG, included meteorological factors and neighborhood noise, as well as 
neighborhood contextual factors and maternal risk factors.
Information on sociodemographic factors and neighborhood quality were collected through 
structured interviews and questionnaires. Household SES was created from a composite 
measure of parental education levels, occupational status, family income, and marital status 
(Hollingshead W. The Hollingshead four-factor index of socioeconomic status [unpublished 
manuscript] New Haven, CT: Yale University; 1979), with higher scores corresponding to 
higher SES (range: 14–66). Self-perceived neighborhood quality was assessed with parent

 reports of 17 items regarding criminal and gang-related activities, unemployment, 
vandalism, and substance use that occurs in the participant’s local area. This questionnaire 
was developed specifically for the RFAB study, resulting in a sum score (with a higher score 
for a more negative perception of neighborhood quality; range: 2–75) with a high level of 
internal consistency (average Cronbach’s Alpha across waves: α = 0.945). For both 
household SES and neighborhood quality, missing values (8% for household SES; 2% for 
neighborhood quality) were imputed using median values.
Maternal smoking during pregnancy– and maternal depression were used as indicators of 
maternal risk factors. To assess smoking during pregnancy, mothers were administered a 
maternal health questionnaire designed for the RFAB study, asking mothers if they had 
smoked cigarettes during their pregnancy with the twins (yes/no). Maternal depression was 
assessed with self-reports of 6-items from the Brief Symptom Inventory administered at 
baseline. Each item was coded and scored on a five-point scale, and a mean score was 
calculated, with higher scores indicating more symptoms of depression.
Meteorological data was obtained from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Air 
Quality and Meteorological Information System. Meteorological conditions recorded at the 
closest site were assigned to each geocoded residence to construct monthly time-series of 
average ambient temperature (ºC) and relative humidity (%) from 1990 to 2012. 
Temperature and relative humidity were averaged for the periods 1-, 3-, and 6-months and 
1-, 2-, and 3-years preceding CBCL assessment (for more details see Supplement 2, 
available online).
Proximity to freeways and other roads and traffic density were used as indicators for 
neighborhood noise. Using roadway geometry from ESRI’s Streetmap Premium database 
(ArcGIS 10.1, Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc., Redlands, CA) and 
geographic information systems (GIS) tools, we computed the distances from each residence 
to the nearest road of four Feature Class Code road classes: freeway or limited-access 
highway; major collector; minor collector; and arterial road. Annual average daily traffic 
volumes, obtained from the California Department of Transportation and TeleAtlas/GDT, 
were assigned to the roadways and used in GIS to map traffic density within 150- and 300-m 
radius buffers. Annual traffic density was assigned using 2002, 2005, 2008, and 2010 
roadways and average traffic volumes for waves 1–4, respectively.
We used the socioeconomic data from the 2000 US Census to objectively define the 
neighborhood contextual factors, as several studies have shown that the resulting 
neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics (nSES) are a strong predictor of neighborhood 
violence and crime,, with higher rates of crime found in disadvantaged neighborhoods. We 
followed the reported procedures to determine the nSES index that had been used in social 
epidemiologic studies. Briefly, an index at the census tract level was constructed using the 
following six variables obtained from the 2000 Census: 1) the percentage of adults 25 years 
old with less than a high school education; 2) the percentage of unemployed males; 3) 
median household income; 4) the percentage of households with income below the poverty 
line; 5) the percentage of households receiving public assistance; and 6) the percentage of 
households with children that are headed by a female. Items were summed and standardized

 (mean = 0; SD = 1), with the resulting index scores greater than 0 indicating tracts above the 
average nSES characteristics (range: −1.50–4.06).
 Statistical Analysis
 Descriptive Statistics Analysis—We calculated the population characteristics by 
quartile of NDVI and by level of aggressive behaviors at the study baseline (i.e., the first 
valid CBCL assessment). Differences in population characteristics in relation to exposure/
outcome were examined according to analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests for continuous 
variables and Pearson Chi-square tests for categorical variables. We also calculated the 
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for both exposure and outcome to determine the 
correlation among twins/triplets within the same family.
 Multilevel Mixed Effects Modeling—Three-level mixed effects models regressing 
repeated measures of aggressive behavior scores on NDVI, accounting for within-family 
(random intercept and slope [age])/within-individual (random intercept) correlations and 
potential confounding by multiple covariates. Random effects terms were included to 
account for the correlation between participants within a family, as well as the correlation 
across time within a participant (for more details see Supplement 3, available online). These 
models were constructed using the restricted maximum likelihood approach, and an 
unstructured covariance structure was specified. Time-varying covariates included age, 
meteorological variables, and other spatial covariates (e.g., traffic density, proximity to 
freeways and roads).
Based on our DAG, age, gender, ethnicity, household SES, self-perceived neighborhood 
quality, and ambient temperature were considered as confounders and included in the fully 
adjusted models. Relative humidity was not selected because it was not significantly 
associated with aggressive behavior in our sample and did not confound the NDVI–
aggressive behavior relationship. Our empirical data suggested a significant linear effect of 
short-term (6-month average) temperature and a non-linear effect of long-term (1- to 3-year 
average) temperature. The corresponding temperature effects were included in our adjusted 
analyses when looking at short-term (1- to 6-month average) vs long-term (1- to 3-year 
average) effects of NDVI, respectively.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate possible confounding by other covariates, 
such as traffic noise, other neighborhood contextual characteristics, and maternal risk factors 
that were not included in our main models. Therefore, we carried out additional analyses 
further adjusting for traffic density and proximity to freeways and roads (proxies for traffic 
noise), nSES index (a strong predictor of neighborhood crime rate), and maternal depression 
and maternal smoking during pregnancy (proxies for maternal risk factors). Lastly, we 
investigated potential modification of effects of neighborhood greenspace by 
sociodemographic factors and neighborhood quality.
All analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS 9.4), and figures 
were created using the R software (version 2.15.2).

  RESULTS
 Distributions of Estimated NDVI and Aggressive Behavior Scores
Table 1 shows our comparison of population characteristics of the 1,287 RFAB participants 
in relation to the quartile distribution of NDVI in a 1,000-m buffer averaged over the 6-
month period prior to baseline. In our study sample, Caucasians, those from households with 
higher SES, those perceiving better neighborhood quality, and those born to nonsmoking 
mothers were more likely to reside in locations with higher levels of NDVI (e.g., in the 
highest-exposure quartile), as compared to their counterparts. Furthermore, neighborhoods 
with denser vegetation (high NDVI) were more likely to be in locations further from 
freeways and roads, with less traffic density, cooler temperatures, and less relative humidity. 
Across all spatiotemporal scales, NDVI estimates were highly correlated with one another 
(range of Spearman’s R: 0.77–0.99; range of means: 0.32–0.33; all standard deviations = 
0.08). Based on ICCs, we found 81–88% of the total variance in NDVI across 
spatiotemporal scales occurred between families, suggesting that most of the NDVI 
variabilities were attributed to the geographic distribution of our study participants. For this 
urban-dwelling population, an interquartile range (~0.12 NDVI) difference in NDVI 
estimate was equivalent to the difference between living in a residence surrounded by other 
housing complexes, shopping centers, or freeways compared to living within close proximity 
to a park, golf course, or school field.
In this sample, younger participants, boys, those from lower-SES households, those 
perceiving poorer neighborhood quality, and those born to smoking mothers were more 
likely to engage in aggressive behaviors as compared to their counterparts (Table 2). 
According to the ICC, 42% of the variability in aggressive behavior scores was attributable 
to between-family differences, with the remaining 58% contributed by within-family 
differences including changes over time. A statistically significant age effect on aggressive 
behaviors was consistent across all models, with decreasing scores by 0.16 to 0.19 (all p-
values < .0001) per year, reflecting age-related behavioral maturation during adolescence 
(data not shown).
 Associations Between Neighborhood Greenspace and Aggressive Behaviors
In Figure 2, we present the results of the multilevel mixed-effects models, with the 
regression coefficient β (95% CI) expressed as the difference in aggression score across the 
interquartile range (IQR) of each exposure (IQR = 0.12 for 1-month to 3-year average NDVI 
in a 250-m buffer; IQR = 0.11 for 1-month to 3-year average NDVI in 350-, 500-, and 1000-
m buffers). Our crude analyses showed that aggressive behaviors decreased with increasing 
exposure to short-term (1-, 3-, and 6-months) and 3-year average NDVI in a 1000-m before 
CBCL assessment (all p-values < .05). Adjustment for sociodemographic factors, 
neighborhood quality, and 6-month average temperature (linear term) resulted in an increase 
in the strength of the short-term effect estimates for NDVI averaged in a 1000-m buffer, 
while the other buffer sizes remained nonsignificant. For each interquartile increment of 1-
month average NDVI in a 1000-m buffer around residences, aggressive behavior scores 
decreased by 0.43 (95% CI: −0.75, −0.11), with slightly lower effect estimates for 3-month 
(β = −0.42; 95% CI: −0.75, −0.09) and 6-month (β = −0.36; 95% CI: −0.71, −0.02) average

 NDVI. Additionally, the long-term effect of NDVI averaged in a 1000-m buffer became 
significant across all exposure durations after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, 
neighborhood quality, and temperature (linear and quadratic terms) for the same temporal 
scale as NDVI estimates (e.g., 1- 2- and 3-year temperature effects respectively for 1, 2, 3-
year NDVI estimates). For each interquartile increment of 1-year average NDVI, aggressive 
behavior scores decreased by 0.36 (95% CI: −0.69, −0.02), with slightly greater effects for 
2-year (β = −0.41; 95% CI: −0.79, −0.04) and 3-year (β = −0.40; 95% CI: −0.75, −0.05) 
averages. The results of our adjusted analyses suggest a consistent pattern of decreased 
aggression associated with increasing residential greenspace within a 1000-m buffer, with 
both short-term and long-term beneficial effects equivalent to 1.9–2.2 and 2.1–2.5 years of 
age-related behavioral maturation, respectively. Additionally, ethnicity, household SES, 
neighborhood quality, and temperature accounted for the observed positive confounding 
when the results of crude and adjusted analyses were compared.
Sensitivity analyses were further carried out for the short- and long-term NDVI estimates 
averaged in the 1000-m buffer, as this appeared to produce consistent significant results. 
Effect estimates were not sensitive to further adjustment for proximity to freeways or roads, 
traffic density in a 150- or 300-m area, or maternal smoking during pregnancy (Table 3; 
Sensitivity Analyses I–V). Participants from neighborhoods with better contextual 
socioeconomic characteristics had significantly (p<.001) higher levels of estimated NDVI 
and were less likely to have aggressive behaviors (Spearman r = −0.08; p = .004). However, 
after we accounted for this objective measure of neighborhood SES characteristics in our 
adjusted analyses (VI), there were very few changes to the estimated longitudinal effects of 
neighborhood greenspace on aggressive behaviors. Mothers with less depressive symptoms 
at baseline were more likely to have resided in neighborhoods with higher levels of NDVI 
for an extended period of time (e.g., Spearman r = −0.10 between depressive score and 3-
year average NDVI within a 1000-m of residential buffer; p = .002), and children of mothers 
with less depression were reported to have less aggressive behaviors during the follow-up (p 
= .02). However, after we further adjusted for the maternal depressive symptoms (VII), the 
observed beneficial effects of neighborhood greenspace remained statistically significant.
Lastly, there were no statistically significant modifications of the observed neighborhood 
greenspace effects by age (dichotomized at median: ≥14 years vs. <14 years; dichotomized 
at 75th percentile: ≥16 years vs. <16 years), gender (boys vs. girls), race/ethnicity (Hispanic 
vs. Caucasian; Black vs. Caucasian; mixed vs. Caucasian; other vs. Caucasian), SES 
(dichotomized at median: ≥43.5 vs. <43.5; dichotomized at 75th percentile: ≥51.5 vs. <51.5), 
or perceived neighborhood quality (dichotomized at median: ≥24.0 vs. <24.0; dichotomized 
at 75th percentile: ≥31.0 vs. <31.0) (data not shown).
 DISCUSSION
In this large and likely the first study on urban-dwelling children and adolescents (aged 9–
18) with prospectively collected longitudinal data on residential histories and behavioral 
assessments, we found strong evidence supporting the benefits of neighborhood greenspace 
in reducing aggressive behaviors. The benefits of increasing vegetation over the range (~0.12 
in NDVI) commonly seen in urban environments were equivalent to approximately 2 to 2.5

 years of age-related behavioral maturation. The observed associations could not be 
explained by sociodemographic factors or neighborhood quality, remained statistically 
significant even after accounting for the observed temperature effects, and were not sensitive 
to the further adjustment of traffic density, proximity to freeways and roads, neighborhood 
socioeconomic characteristics, maternal smoking during pregnancy, or maternal depression. 
Furthermore, we found no evidence of effect modification by sociodemographic factors or 
neighborhood quality, suggesting the universal benefits of neighborhood greenspace.
Our study findings, if replicated by others, will have important public health and clinical 
implications. Our analyses reveal the first observational evidence for the NDVI-reduced 
aggressive behavior in adolescents, and provide a rationale for studies of interventions to 
improving greenspace in residential neighborhoods. In our sample, living within close 
proximity to a park, golf course, or field, in comparison to residing in a location surrounded 
by other housing, shopping centers, or freeways, was equivalent to having an increased 
NDVI associated with a 0.36 to 0.41 reduction in aggressive behavior scores. Although 
considered a small change at the individual level, this observed decrease of aggressive 
behaviors associated with increasing neighborhood greenspace can translate to a significant 
public health impact when viewed at the population level. There are an estimated 3.5 million 
adolescents in California, and approximately 95% of California residents are located within 
urban areas. According to Achenbach and Rescorla, a CBCL raw score 2 standard deviations 
above the mean represents a clinically significant level of aggressive behavior. In our 
sample, mean raw scores were 4.86 (SD = 5.03), similar to what was found in previous 
studies. Assuming this mean score for urban-dwelling adolescents in California (n = 3.3 
million), an estimated 74,036 would present aggressive behavior scores above the clinical 
range; however, a 0.4-point drop in scores would shift this mean to 4.46, and the number of 
clinically significant individuals would decrease by approximately 9,000 (12%) in California 
adolescents alone. Furthermore, these results may even have implications on adult behavior, 
as one study found that CBCL-measured raw aggressive behavior scores above the clinical/
deviant cut-off at ages 12–16 strongly predicted externalizing behavior (aggressive and 
delinquent behaviors) at a follow-up assessment 14 years later (odds ratio = 2.3; 95% CI: 
1.5, 3.7). Collectively, these findings underscore the societal impact of increasing 
neighborhood greenspace even by the range of vegetation (~0.12 of NDVI) commonly seen 
in urban environments.
Although the underlying mechanism is not fully understood, we propose several possible 
pathways that may explain the relationship between greenspace and aggressive behaviors. 
First, many studies suggest maternal stress and depression increase externalizing behavioral 
problems in children, and exposure to greenspace can improve mental health by reducing 
stress levels and lowering depression. Second, low self-esteem is related to aggressive 
behavior in children and adolescents, and intervention studies have found that greenspace 
improvements encourage participation in physical activity and that increased physical 
activity improves self-esteem. Third, recent epidemiological studies suggest that ambient air 
pollution and ambient noise could possibly increase aggressive behavior, and greenspace 
may reduce air pollution levels and act as a buffer for ambient noise. Fourth, many 
organisms important for immunoregulatory mechanisms and brain development are almost 
completely eliminated from urban environments, but greenspace in urban areas preserves the

 microbial biodiversity needed to drive immunoregulation and optimize brain health. Because 
there are likely many possible pathways involved, mediation analyses are needed to identify 
the exact mechanism by which greenspace may reduce aggressive behavior.
Our study findings also have important implications for future research on environmental 
epidemiology of aggressive behavior in urban-dwelling populations. As mentioned earlier, 
previous studies primarily focused on studying social environments, and our literature search 
(see Table S1, available online) revealed 19 peer-reviewed publications (with 7 observational 
studies, all cross-sectional) investigating physical characteristics of ambient environments 
(e.g., meteorological factors, ambient air pollution, and ambient noise) and aggressive 
behaviors. Previous experimental studies have produced inconsistent results on the 
relationship between aggressive behavior and short-term temperature, and no studies have 
investigated the long-term effects of temperature. Only one cross-sectional study examined 
the association between self-reported noise exposure and aggression, and investigators found 
that low-frequency, high-intensity, and continuous noises were associated with higher 
displaced aggression scores. However, their results might be biased due to unmeasured 
confounding by SES or residential greenspace. Lastly, three epidemiologic studies with 
cross-sectional analyses reported provocative findings suggesting the adverse effects of 
ambient air pollution on aggressive behavior.– However, it was unclear if the reported 
associations were confounded by neighborhood greenspace. The scant literature likely 
reflects one major methodological challenge in differentiating the isolated effect of these 
potential environmental determinants of aggressive behaviors, as unfavorable characteristics 
of ambient environments are inter-correlated with each other (e.g., highest traffic density and 
nearest to major roads in locations with the lowest NDVI as shown in Table 1). In this study 
we were able to adjust for indicators of neighborhood noise and ambient temperature, and 
our sensitivity analyses showed that the relationship between neighborhood greenspace and 
aggressive behaviors could not be explained by these other environmental factors, which 
strengthened our findings. Environmental epidemiology studies investigating the neurotoxic 
effect of air pollution on aggressive behaviors will need to address the potential confounding 
by neighborhood greenspace and temperature, which correlate with ambient air pollution 
levels.
We recognized a few limitations in our study. First, aggressive behaviors were assessed 
using the parent-reported version of the CBCL. Parents are aware of their child’s behavior 
primarily in home environments and may not be as familiar with their child’s behaviors in 
other social settings. Although a self-reported version of the CBCL (the Youth Self Report) 
was available, it is not validated for ages 10 and under and was only administered after wave 
3 (ages 14–15 years old), making it unsuitable for the present study focused on longitudinal 
analyses from ages 9–18. Second, neighborhood greenspace exposures were assigned using 
NDVI as a proxy. Although NDVI has been validated as a useful measure of neighborhood 
greenspace for epidemiologic research, our study is still subject to exposure measurement 
errors. However, the expected non-differential measurement errors in using NDVI to assess 
neighborhood greenspace would likely have attenuated the observed associations. Third, we 
had conducted several sensitivity analyses to further adjust for other correlated spatial 
covariates, but we could not rule out the possibility of unmeasured or residual confounding 
contributed by other environmental determinants of aggressive behaviors. For instance,

 although our reported association was not confounded by nSES, which is a strong predictor 
of neighborhood violence and crime,, our analyses could not adjust for neighborhood crime 
rates; as such, uniform data were not available across the Southern California communities. 
Fourth, the plausible mediating role of physical activities could not be explored in this study 
because such data were not available. Lastly, our analyses only include the Aggressive 
Behavior subscale as a global measure. Built on the novel association we discovered, future 
studies should explore the possible influences on the subtypes of aggression that are relevant 
to child psychiatry., The major strengths of this study are the longitudinal study design, the 
extended follow-up from late childhood through adolescence, the large sample size, and the 
detailed investigation of the effects of neighborhood greenspace by testing various 
spatiotemporal scales of NDVI exposure.
In summary, this study provided the first epidemiological evidence supporting the 
hypothesized beneficial impact of neighborhood greenspace on aggressive behaviors in 
urban-dwelling adolescents, with consistent effects observed for both short- and long-term 
exposures. Future studies are needed to replicate our findings in other population settings 
and to identify mechanisms by which greenspaces may reduce aggressive behavior. If 
substantiated in other studies, these results should motivate community-based interventions 
to determine the effectiveness of greenspace as a preemptive strategy to reduce aggressive 
behavior in urban environments.
