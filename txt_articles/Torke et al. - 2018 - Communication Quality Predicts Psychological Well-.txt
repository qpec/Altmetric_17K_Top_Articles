BACKGROUND: Many hospitalized older adults require
family surrogates to make decisions, but surrogates may
perceive that the quality of medical decisions is low and
may have poor psychological outcomes after the patient’s
hospitalization.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between com-
munication quality and high-quality medical decisions,
psychological well-being, and satisfaction for surrogates
of hospitalized older adults.
DESIGN: Observational study at three hospitals in a Mid-
west metropolitan area.
PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized older adults (65+ years) ad-
mitted to medicine and medical intensive care units who
were unable to make medical decisions, and their family
surrogates. Among 799 eligible dyads, 364 (45.6%) com-
pleted the study.
MAIN MEASURES: Communication was assessed during
hospitalization using the information and emotional sup-
port subscales of the Family Inpatient Communication
Survey. Decision quality was assessed with the Decisional
Conflict Scale. Outcomes assessed at baseline and 4–
6 weeks post-discharge included anxiety (Generalized
Anxiety Disorder-7), depression (Patient Health
Questionnaire-9), post-traumatic stress (Impact of Event
Scale-Revised), and satisfaction (Hospital Consumer As-
sessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems).
KEY RESULTS: The mean patient age was 81.9 years (SD
8.32); 62% were women, and 28% African American.
Among surrogates, 67% were adult children. Six to eight
weeks post-discharge, 22.6% of surrogates reported anx-
iety (11.3% moderate–severe anxiety); 29% reported de-
pression, (14.0% moderate–severe), and 14.6% had high
levels of post-traumatic stress. Emotional support was
associated with lower odds of anxiety (adjusted odds ratio
[AOR] = 0.65, 95% CI 0.50, 0.85) and depression
(AOR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.65, 0.99) at follow-up. In multivar-
iable linear regression, emotional support was associated
with lower post-traumatic stress (β = −0.30, p = 0.003)
and higher decision quality (β = −0.44, p < 0.0001). Infor-
mation was associated with higher post-traumatic stress
(β = 0.23, p = 0.022) but also higher satisfaction (β = 0.61,
p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Emotional support of hospital surro-
gates is consistently associated with better psychological
outcomes and decision quality, suggesting an opportunity
to improve decision making and well-being.

INTRODUCTION
Nearly half of hospitalized older adults are unable to make
their own medical decisions, and rely on surrogates—usually
close family members—to make decisions for them.1 Surro-
gate decision makers face emotional, ethical, and communi-
cation challenges that differ from those in personal decision
making. Surrogates suffer substantial psychological distress
after hospitalization of a family member, particularly in the
intensive care unit (ICU),2–5 yet we know little about the
frequency or predictors of this distress. Given that over 13
million older adults are hospitalized each year, the magnitude
of psychological distress from surrogate decision making and
its impact on the care of patients and their surrogates needs
further investigation.6
The content and quality of communication between surro-
gates and clinicians represent potentially modifiable factors
that may impact the well-being of both patient and surrogate
and the quality of medical decision making. Although research
has shown that several types of interventions are effective in
improving communication in the ICU setting,7 there are lim-
ited data on the aspects of the communication that are most
important to surrogates or on outcomes of hospital communi-
cation outside the ICU. Qualitative studies have identified
some aspects of communication that are important to surrogate
decision makers, such as clinician availability, recommenda-
tions from providers, frequent information, and emotional
support.8, 9 Studies using direct observation in the ICU have

 found that the amount of time families are allowed to speak in
ICU family meetings and expressions of empathy are associ-
ated with satisfaction.10, 11 In the published literature, we
found little data about the impact of communication quality
on outcomes for hospital surrogate decision makers.
We propose that communication quality may affect both the
quality of medical decision making and the psychological
well-being of the surrogate.12 For this study, we specifically
defined decision quality according to the framework devel-
oped for the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). The Effective
Decision subscale of the DCS includes whether the decision is
informed, is concordant with values, is a decision the surrogate
plans to implement, and is one that the surrogate is satisfied
with.13 In the present study, we hypothesize that surrogate
ratings of communication quality in the hospital are associated
with measures of decision quality and satisfaction and with the
surrogate’s psychological well-being 6–8 weeks after
hospitalization.
METHODS
Setting and Participants
The study was conducted in three hospitals in a single Mid-
west metropolitan area: a university tertiary referral hospital,
an urban safety-net hospital, and a suburban community hos-
pital affiliated with the university. We enrolled patient/
surrogate dyads. Patients were adults 65 and older admitted
to the internal medicine or medical ICU services of one of the
three hospitals. Eligible surrogates had faced at least one of
three types of decisions during the current hospital stay, re-
garding (1) life-sustaining therapy such as code status or use of
a ventilator, (2) procedures or surgeries requiring written in-
formed consent, or (3) placement in a nursing home or other
facility. These decisions were selected based on prior research
suggesting that they are both common and involve important
judgments about the patient’s goals of care.9 Patients were
excluded if they lacked a surrogate decision maker or could
not complete surveys in English, or if the surrogate was a state-
appointed guardian.
Measures
Communication quality was assessed using the Family Inpa-
tient Communication Survey (http://medicine.iupui.edu/
IUCAR/research/tools/FICS).14 The FICS is a 30-item scale
completed by the surrogate decision maker to assess their
perception of communication quality. It comprises two sub-
scales, information and emotional support. Validation of the
survey was conducted using the first 350 participants enrolled
in the present study. Internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) was
0.94 for the information subscale and 0.90 for the emotional
support subscale. We collected demographic information for
the patient and surrogate based on surrogate report. Income
was collected using income ranges and also by an item
addressing whether the participant judged their income as
Bcomfortable,^ Bjust enough to make ends meet,^ or BNOT
enough to make ends meet.^15 This second item was used in
further analyses due to high non-response to the income item.
Decision quality was assessed with the Effective Decision
Subscale of the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), a well-
validated measure of decision making.13 The subscale mea-
sures the four elements of decision quality: the decision is
informed, is concordant with values, and is one that the sur-
rogate plans to implement, and that the surrogate is satisfied
with the decision.13 We modified the wording of items slightly
so that questions were appropriate for persons making deci-
sions for others. Overall psychological distress at baseline was
assessed with the Kessler six-item Psychological Distress
Scale.16 Post-traumatic stress was assessed with the Horowitz
Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R),17 a measure used in
prior studies of surrogate decision making.2, 18 Anxiety was
assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7),
and depression was assessed with the Patient Health
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).19 Overall satisfaction was mea-
sured with a single item from the Hospital Consumer Assess-
ment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Sur-
vey20 that rates the overall quality of the hospital stay on a
scale from 0 to 10. Death at the time of the 6–8-week follow-
up was determined by surrogate report.
Enrollment/Administration
Research assistants (RAs) identified potential eligible partici-
pants via medical record review of patient admissions. Re-
views were conducted Monday through Friday during the
study period. Patients were eliminated for reasons including
lack of a family surrogate or evidence that the patient was
making decisions independently. Among those with a poten-
tial need for a surrogate, the RA conducted a brief, 3–5-min
screening telephone call with one of the patient’s physicians
(intern or resident in teaching setting and attending; or nurse
practitioner or attending physician for non-teaching services)
between hospital days 2 and 4. Physician report was used to
determine whether the patient required a surrogate for all
decisions and whether the surrogate had been faced with a
decision in at least one of the predetermined categories.
Informed consent and the enrollment interview were con-
ducted in the hospital or by phone between hospital days 2 and
10. Surrogates consented for their own participation. Because
the study involved patients who were entirely unable to make
decisions, surrogate consent for the patient was obtained in all
cases. Enrollment interviews included the DCS and the FICS.
Because the DCS addresses specific medical decisions, this
scale was administered to each surrogate for up to three
specific decisions at enrollment and up to one additional
decision at follow-up to account for any decisions that may
have been missed between the enrollment interview and hos-
pital discharge. Follow-up interviews at 6–8 weeks included
the GAD-7, PHQ-9, IES-R, and satisfaction. This time frame

 was selected to minimize loss to follow-up, but to allow
enough time for post-traumatic stress symptoms to develop,
as these require a minimum of 1 month according to standard
criteria.21
Data Analysis
We conducted separate regression analyses for each outcome.
We used logistic regression models for the dichotomous out-
comes of anxiety and depression, using published cutoffs for
moderate to severe anxiety (GAD-7 scores of 10+) and de-
pression (PHQ-9 scores of 10+),19 and we report odds ratios.
For continuous outcome variables, we used multivariable
linear regression models using the Maximum Likelihood Ro-
bust (MLR) estimator for post-traumatic stress, satisfaction,
and decisional conflict, and we report estimated standardized
slope parameters. The MLR estimator is robust to skewed
data. We chose to model post-traumatic stress as a continuous
variable because this measure was designed as a symptom
assessment rather than a diagnostic tool, and experts urge
caution in the use of cutoff scores.17, 22 However, to provide
an overall estimate of the prevalence of serious post-traumatic
stress symptoms, we provide an estimate of prevalence using a
conservative cutoff score of 22+.23
For the information and emotional support subscales, we
calculated a minimum important difference (MID), an esti-
mate of the smallest change in an outcome that would be
relevant to the responder. This was calculated using the stan-
dard error of measurement (SEM). The SEM was calculated as
the standard deviation multiplied by the square root of 1 minus
the reliability. Reliability was estimated with Cronbach’s al-
pha. The MID was defined as 1.0 SEM. The odds ratios
reported from logistic regression were customized per one-
MID-unit increase rather than the default one-point increase,
because an MID indicates a more clinically relevant change.
For each adjusted analysis, we controlled for demographic
variables (patient and surrogate age, education, race, and
socioeconomic status). We used the socioeconomic item relat-
ed to Bcomfort^ with finances due to high non-response to the
question assessing surrogate income. In order to account for
the effect of baseline psychological distress on ratings of
communication quality and the possibility of reverse causation
(i.e., distress as a cause of poor communication), we controlled
for baseline GAD-7 scores, PHQ-9 scores, and Kessler-6
scores (a general measure of psychological distress) in the
regression models of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic
stress, respectively. Because we hypothesized that the quality
of decision making may be a factor in surrogate outcomes, we
included the Effective Decision Subscale as a covariate. We
also controlled for patient death between admission and 6–8-
week follow-up due to presumed added stress of a death.
Analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) and Mplus v7.4 (Muthén & Muthén, Los Angeles,
CA). The Indiana University Institutional Review Board ap-
proved the study. Results are reported according to the
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epi-
demiology (STROBE) guidelines.24
RESULTS
There were 12,000 potentially eligible patients identified via
the electronic medical record (Fig. 1). Of these, RAs conduct-
ed screening interviews with the physicians of 8086 patients.
The remainder of physicians could not be contacted within the
enrollment window, and 87 physicians refused enrollment for
the specific patient. Of the 8086, most were ineligible because
the patients were making their own decisions. We identified
799 eligible patient/surrogate dyads, and enrolled 369 dyads.
Five dyads withdrew, for a final enrollment of 364 dyads
(45.6%). Enrolled patients had a mean age of 81.9 years;
61.5% were women, 69.0% white, and 27.8% African Amer-
ican (Table 1). The mean age of surrogates was 58.3 years;
70.9% were women. The majority of surrogates (66.8%) were
the patients’ adult children; 16.8% were spouses. Baseline
FICS information subscale scores ranged from 22 to 100 out
of a potential 20–100, with a median of 82. Baseline FICS
emotional subscale scores ranged from 12 to 60 out of a
potential 12–60, with a median of 49. At baseline, 33.7%
reported mild or greater anxiety and 13.8% reported clinically
important (moderate or higher) anxiety; 40.1% reported at
least mild depression and 14.7% reported moderate or high
depression. A total of 328 (90.1%) of enrolled surrogates
completed the 6–8-week follow-up survey. MIDs were calcu-
lated to be two points (i.e., 1 SEM) for the emotional subscale
and three points for the informational subscale.
Psychological Outcomes
At follow-up, 22.6% of surrogates reported at least mild
anxiety and 11.3% reported moderate–severe anxiety; 29%
reported at least mild depression and 14.0% reported moder-
ate–severe depression (Table 2). Scores for ICU surrogates
were not significantly different from those on non-ICU ser-
vices (8.3% of ICU surrogates had moderate or greater anxiety

 vs. 12.5% of non-ICU surrogates, p = 0.2778; 14.6% of ICU
surrogates had moderate or greater depression vs. 13.8% in the
non-ICU group, p = 0.8512). Post-traumatic stress scores
ranged from 0 to 80, with a median of 3.5, and 14.6% of
participants reported a high score. Median scores were higher
in the ICU than non-ICU surrogates (4.5 [0–79] vs. 2 [0–80],
p = 0.0154). Satisfaction scores ranged from 0 to 10, with a
median of 9. We examined differences in the outcome vari-
ables based on the decisions faced by each surrogate and
found no differences for anxiety, depression, decision quality,
or post-traumatic stress. Those with decisions regarding life-
sustaining treatment had slightly higher satisfaction scores
(median 9 [0–10] vs. 8.5 [3–10], p = 0.0002).
In unadjusted analysis, the MID on the emotional support
subscale (odds ratio [OR] = 0.84, 95% CI 0.76, 0.94,
p = 0.0015), but not the information subscale (OR = 0.95
[0.88, 1.01], p = 0.1039), was associated with lower odds of
moderate–severe anxiety at follow-up (Table 3). These results
persisted when controlling for demographics, baseline anxiety,
decision quality, and patient death (emotional support adjusted
OR [AOR] = 0.65 [0.50, 0.85], p = 0.0018; information
AOR = 1.19 [0.99, 1.42], p = 0.0646). Similarly, the odds of
depression were associated with emotional support in unad-
justed (OR = 0.89 [0.81, 0.97], p = 0.0117) and adjusted
models (AOR = 0.80 [0.65, 0.99], p = 0.0396). Information
was not associated with depression (unadjusted OR = 0.96,
p = 0.2488; AOR = 1.08, p = 0.3072).
In MLR-estimated linear regression analyses, emotional
support was associated with lower post-traumatic stress scores
(β = −0.13, p = 0.0137), while information was not
(β = −0.04, p = 0.4411; Table 4). Emotional support remained
significantly associated with post-traumatic stress when ad-
justed for covariates (β = −0.30, p = 0.0034. The information
subscale was associated with higher post-traumatic stress
scores in adjusted analysis. (β = 0.23, p = 0.0221).
Other Outcomes
In unadjusted analysis, satisfaction was associated with both
emotional support (β = 0.47 p < 0.0001) and information
(β = 0.58, p < 0.0001); in adjusted models, only information
remained significant (β = 0.61 p < 0.0001). Surrogate ratings
of decision quality were associated with emotional support but
not information (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
This observational study revealed high levels of psychological
distress during the patient’s acute illness. Additionally, 11–
15% of surrogate decision makers for hospitalized older adults
suffered from clinically high levels of anxiety, depression, and
post-traumatic stress 6–8 weeks after hospitalization. The
decline in the frequency of symptoms suggests that some of
the distress experienced during the acute illness resolves, but
stress remains for over 10% of surrogates. Our results are
consistent with prior literature establishing substantial degrees
of distress among surrogate decision makers.3 In the ICU
setting, this phenomenon has been labeled post-intensive care
syndrome—family.4 We extend these results beyond the ICU;
our finding that anxiety and depression were not significantly
higher in the ICU suggests that surrogates for older adults are
at risk of psychological distress in other hospital settings, and
thus many more family members are at risk than previously
thought.

 Further, surrogates’ perception of emotional support during
hospitalization was associated with lower anxiety, depression,
post-traumatic stress, and decision quality 6–8 weeks later.
This effect was particularly strong for anxiety, with a 54%
increase in the odds of anxiety for every two-point decrease in
emotional support (i.e., 1/0.65 = 1.54), after adjusting for other
covariates. Information was associated with better satisfaction
but increased post-traumatic stress.
Although an observational study cannot prove causation,
our results raise the question of whether improved emotional
support could lead to both better decisions for the patient and
better psychological outcomes. Surrogate–provider communi-
cation interventions that include emotional support hold prom-
ise for improving surrogate outcomes. Helping clinicians
develop and utilize empathic communication skills may be
especially important. Educational interventions such as
VITALtalk (www.vitaltalk.org) and communication interven-
tions that include recognition of emotion and expressions of
empathy are likely to be most effective in reducing surrogate
distress.25 Future randomized trials are needed to assess the
impact of these specific approaches on surrogate outcomes.
Strategies may be needed to overcome other barriers to em-
pathic communication in the clinical setting, such as time
pressures or worry that empathy will open a BPandora’s box^
of emotions.26, 27 As the population ages, and an increasing
number of family members find themselves in the role of
surrogate, providing appropriate support for family members
will become a public health imperative.

 A surprising finding was that when controlling for emotion-
al support, informational support was positively associated
with greater post-traumatic stress. Prior randomized controlled
trials of ICU support interventions have found mixed results,
with one recent study noting that information support actually
contributed to increased post-traumatic stress.18,28,29 Our re-
sults may help explain this discrepancy; intensive emotional
support may be needed to mitigate the stress of receiving
prognostic information about life-threatening illness. This
finding might seem to conflict with guidance toward fully
informing patients and families in order to enable high-
quality decision making. However, while high-quality infor-
mation is important to patients and family members, it may
have negative consequences if not accompanied by appropri-
ate emotional support.
In contrast, high-quality information was associated with
higher overall satisfaction with the hospital stay, which may be
of particular interest to both clinicians and hospital adminis-
trators. Although surrogate decision makers of adult patients
are not included in standard adult HCAHPS surveys,30 it is
quite possible that they fill them out on behalf of the patient.
Families of cognitively impaired patients have important in-
sights into the quality of decision making and care, and com-
munication appears to be one important factor in their
assessment.
One limitation of the current study is the possibility of
reverse causation, that is, patients with greater psychological
distress at baseline might have rated communication less
favorably. We attempted to account for this by administering
several outcome measures including anxiety and depression at
both baseline and 6–8-week follow-up, and controlling for
baseline distress in each analysis. We also controlled for
covariates that may have affected both communication and
psychological outcomes, such as whether the patient died.
Future research—for example, a randomized trial of a com-
munication intervention—will be important for further testing
the causal relationship between communication and outcomes.
A second limitation is the setting in a single metropolitan area,
which may not generalize to other locations. There also may
have been some bias, because we were only able to enroll
45.6% of eligible surrogates. We also made slight modifica-
tions to the DCS in order to administer this to surrogates
instead of patients, which may have affected the scale’s valid-
ity. Finally, although our sample was highly diverse in age,
education, and race (African American and white), we lacked
the perspectives of Asian and Latino populations.
In conclusion, the relationship between communication
quality and outcomes for the surrogate is complex and multi-
faceted. Our finding that emotional support of hospital surro-
gates is associated with reduced anxiety, depression, and post-
traumatic stress symptoms suggests that it is not enough to
simply provide good information: family members also need
emotional support when making difficult decisions. Even
though high-quality information is associated with overall
satisfaction with the hospital stay, information without emo-
tional support may be harmful to surrogates. Interventions that
improve the communication experiences of surrogates must
address both dimensions.
