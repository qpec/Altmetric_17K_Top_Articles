Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are established cancer biomarkers for
the “liquid biopsy” of tumors. Molecular analysis of single CTCs,
which recapitulate primary and metastatic tumor biology, remains
challenging because current platforms have limited throughput,
are expensive, and are not easily translatable to the clinic. Here,
we report a massively parallel, multigene-profiling nanoplatform
to compartmentalize and analyze hundreds of single CTCs. After
high-efficiency magnetic collection of CTC from blood, a single-cell
nanowell array performs CTC mutation profiling using modular gene
panels. Using this approach, we demonstrated multigene expression
profiling of individual CTCs from non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients with remarkable sensitivity. Thus, we report a high-
throughput, multiplexed strategy for single-cell mutation profiling
of individual lung cancer CTCs toward minimally invasive cancer
therapy prediction and disease monitoring.

lood-based biomarkers, including genomic, transcriptomic,
proteomic, and other cellular components, are amenable to
minimally invasive approaches for cancer detection and assess-
ment (1). Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which are currently
defined as epithelial cells in a cancer patient’s bloodstream de-
rived from tumor cell release, are an established prognostic blood
biomarker, because their concentration in blood is associated with
high tumor burden (2). CTC gene expression and gene mutation
profiling may therefore noninvasively recapitulate the primary and
metastatic tumor composition, potentially yielding clinically ac-
tionable information. Therefore, CTC single-cell mutation analy-
sis for clinical application may be a practical approach for tumor
progression monitoring and treatment selection.
CellSearch is the only US Food and Drug Administration-
approved technology since its introduction in 1999 to identify CTCs
in whole blood (3). Many other innovative platforms (2) leverage
various physical and biochemical properties of CTCs for highly
sensitive and efficient enrichment (2), encompassing improved
epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-based capture [e.g.,
CTC Chip (4), HB-Chip (5), μNMR (6), MagSweeper (7), and
MagSifter (8)], size-selective capture [e.g., Cluster-Chip (9), ISET
(2, 10), and Vortex technologies (11)], inertial-based capture [e.g.,
iChip platform (12)], nanomaterials-based capture [e.g., nanofilms
(13), NanoVelcro (14), and functionalized graphene oxide nano-
sheets (15)], and image-based cytometry [e.g., HD-CTC (16)].
These current platforms, unfortunately, are overwhelmingly
reliant on the enumeration of CTCs by immunocytochemistry
(ICC) to measure tumor burden, which clearly does not probe
underlying CTC tumor biology. To overcome limitations of existing
CTC identification strategies, downstream analysis of individual
CTCs via highly sensitive and specific single-cell measurements of
tumor-derived blood components is imperative. Investigators have
detected CTCs via gene expression directly from unprocessed whole
blood (17, 18), but these measurements are typically (i) obscured by
background signals from circulating mRNA, white blood cells
(WBCs), and other blood components (19) and (ii) performed
using ensemble measurements that inadequately represent indi-
vidual cell phenotypes. Because this analysis averages out signals
across individual CTCs, the heterogeneity of different CTC pop-
ulations is not detected, which could play a critical role in un-
derstanding a patient’s tumor biology, metastatic potential, and
Significance
There exists an urgent need for minimally invasive molecular
analysis tools for cancer assessment and management, partic-
ularly in advanced-stage lung cancer, when tissue procurement
is challenging and gene mutation profiling is crucial to identify
molecularly targeted agents for treatment. High-throughput
compartmentalization and multigene profiling of individual
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from whole-blood samples using
modular gene panels may facilitate highly sensitive, yet mini-
mally invasive characterization of lung cancer for therapy
prediction and monitoring. We envision this nanoplatform as a
compelling research tool to investigate the dynamics of cancer
disease processes, as well as a viable clinical platform for
minimally invasive yet comprehensive cancer assessment.

 clinical course (20). Other reported methods for single-cell multi-
gene expression CTC profiling of breast cancer (21) and metastatic
prostate cancer (22) suffer from limited throughput—each captured
cell is manually selected, lysed, and subjected to reverse transcrip-
tion into cDNA before parallel multigene expression profiling, thus
precluding their large-scale clinical application.
In particular, lung cancer presents an urgent need for a rou-
tine, minimally invasive clinical assessment tool, because (i) it is
the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide (23); (ii) many lung
cancer patients are diagnosed at the most advanced stage; (iii)
new molecularly targeted therapies are emerging to improve
progression-free and overall survival for those patients with
driver mutations such as epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) (24) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) (25); (iv)
new methods for diagnosis and treatment monitoring are im-
perative because accessing the primary tumor or metastatic le-
sions can be technically challenging, morbid, and costly; and (v)
CTCs have been isolated and profiled for key driver mutations in
non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (17).
With the above needs in mind, we report the development, val-
idation, and demonstrated clinical utility of an integrated nano-
platform that features a magnetic sifter [MagSifter (8)] and single-
cell nanowell array capable of sorting up to 25,600 cells [Nanowell
(26, 27)] to capture, easily compartmentalize, and molecularly
characterize single CTCs from blood (Fig. 1). We report here a
proof-of-concept demonstration showing single-CTC multigene
expression and mutation profiling for tumor interrogation using
four-plex modular gene panels, including panels for EGFR muta-
tion detection for therapy prediction and monitoring.
Results
Overall Workflow. The Nanowell performs massively parallel
sorting of individual CTCs into 25,600 separate compartments.
First, the MagSifter technology (8) (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1) tags
CTCs with magnetic nanoparticles for high-throughput, high-
efficiency CTC enrichment from blood. After MagSifter
enrichment from 2-mL whole-blood samples (see Fig. S2 for
illustration of captured cells via conventional ICC), red blood
cells (RBCs) are hemolyzed (28) and DNase I is added to
remove circulating genomic DNA, obtaining ultrapure cellular
eluent that is seeded into Nanowell by direct pipetting and
centrifugation. Single-cell multigene RT-PCR is performed with
our modular multigene panels: a CTC identification panel with
telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) (29, 30) and mesen-
chymal–epithelial transition (MET) (31, 32) to identify putative
CTCs in advanced-stage NSCLC patients, and a therapy pre-
diction and monitoring panel with TERT, an EGFR mutation,
and its corresponding wild-type gene for identification and mu-
tation detection of putative CTCs in advanced-stage NSCLC.
NSCLC and noncancer cell lines were used to validate the gene
expression panels on the integrated nanoplatform. To demon-
strate its potential for clinical translation, samples from both
healthy human subjects and patients diagnosed with NSCLC with
the CTC identification panel (TERT and MET) were assayed.
Fig. 1.
Overall workflow of the integrated nanoplatform. (A) First, whole-blood samples are processed for isolation of CTCs by the MagSifter. Streptavi-
dinated 150-nm iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are conjugated to biotinylated anti-EpCAM antibodies for EpCAM-positive selection of circulating
tumor cells (CTCs), which are epithelial in origin. Magnetically labeled CTCs are captured on the sifter when flowed through it under an applied magnetic field
and subsequently eluted in the absence of a magnetic field. (B) Subsequently, all eluent is directly loaded without staining onto a Nanowell device, and cells
are seeded into individual compartments by centrifugation. After drying, single-cell RT-PCR mix is applied to the nanowells, which are then sealed with PCR
tape. (C) The Nanowell device is then placed into a thermocycler for multiplex gene mutation and expression analysis via reverse transcription and PCR
amplification. Multigene expression via up to four off-the-shelf hydrolysis probes with discrete emission spectra can be imaged in each nanowell. These
fluorescence signals are then analyzed with custom MATLAB and R scripts for identification and characterization of putative CTCs based on modular panels of
representative genes. These panels are flexible and can be adjusted to accommodate clinical needs such as therapy prediction and disease monitoring.

 Then, therapy prediction and monitoring (TERT, EGFR mutant,
and EGFR wild-type) panels were assayed using advanced-stage
NSCLC patient blood samples.
Single-Cancer-Cell Detection Using the Nanowell Assay on Cell Lines.
We first identified mutations in HCC827 and H661 cell lines (Fig.
2A), which are mutant and wild type, respectively, for EGFR exon 19
deletion (del19) in bulk and then at the individual-cell level to
demonstrate the utility of Nanowell. Bulk gene expression analysis of
total mRNA extracted from 106 cells each of HCC827 and H661
indicated their mutually exclusive gene expression of EGFR E746-
A750del [the most common del19 mutation (33)] and wild type,
respectively (P < 0.0001, two-sample t test). Nanowell confirmed
differential del19 expression between HCC827 and H661, with in-
dividual HCC827 cells expressing only EGFR E746-A750del (green)
and individual H661 cells exhibiting only wild-type EGFR (orange)
(P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2B).
We further examined the bulk gene expression of 106 cells
each of five NSCLC cell lines (A549, H661, H1650, H1975, and
HCC827), a noncancerous fibroblast (PCS-201) cell line, and WBCs
from 2 mL of healthy human blood. Cancer cells expressed significantly
higher TERT and MET than PCS-201 cells and WBCs (P < 0.0001, t
test), both of which expressed no TERT and low MET (Fig. 2C), thus
implying that TERT and MET are good CTC markers.
We then assessed Nanowell’s ability to distinguish between
cancerous and noncancerous cells by differential gene expression
profiling of H1650 and PCS-201 cell lines. H1650 and PCS-201
cells were stained with CellTracker Green CMFDA and Orange
CMRA dyes (Life Technologies), respectively, and assayed to-
gether in a Nanowell for TERT. Nanowell images were acquired
in three fluorescence channels corresponding to H1650 cells (as
denoted in green color), PCS-201 cells (denoted as red color),
and TERT gene expression (denoted as blue color) (Fig. 2D).
TERT expression signals revealed a significant differentiation
between H1650 and PCS-201 cells (P < 0.0001, t test).
Four-Plex Gene Expression of Single H1650 Cells Spiked into Healthy
Blood. To validate the suitability of a modular gene panel including
vimentin (VIM) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in addition
to TERT and MET for CTC identification, we examined the bulk
gene expression of 106 cells from each of five NSCLC cell lines
(A549, H661, H1650, H1975, and HCC827), a noncancerous fi-
broblast (PCS-201) cell line, and WBCs from 2 mL of healthy
human blood. We noted heterogeneous VIM and ALDH expres-
sion across these cell types (Fig. S3).
After performing these in vitro experiments, we assessed
whether our platform could isolate cells spiked into healthy
human blood using H1650 cells, which mimics the NSCLC pa-
tient condition (Fig. 3A). After demonstrating bulk gene ex-
pression for our four-plex assay TERT, MET, VIM, and ALDH,
we observed distinct patterns of gene expression on individual
cells isolated from doped blood (Fig. 3B). One cell population

Translating bulk gene expression to single-cell gene expression profiling on Nanowell using cell lines. (A) Two cell lines (HCC827 and H661) were
selected according to their EGFR exon 19 deletion (del19) mutational status (mutant and wild type, respectively). Bulk expression analysis by PCR showed that
HCC827 cells exhibited measured signal for only the EGFR E746-A750del (the most common EGFR del19 mutation shown in green), with undetectable wild-
type EGFR. In contrast, H661 cells exhibited measured signal for only the wild-type EGFR shown in yellow, with undetectable E746-A750del. (B) The same two
cell lines each underwent single-cell analysis on Nanowell using EGFR E746-A750del and wild-type probes in FAM (shown in green) and HEX (shown in orange)
channels, respectively. HCC827 cells exhibited fluorescence predominantly in the FAM channel, indicating the presence of EGFR del19 mutation. (Scale bar,
200 μm.) In contrast, the assay of H661 cells exhibited fluorescence predominantly in the HEX channel, indicating the presence of wild-type EGFR. (Scale bar,
200 μm.) For each cell line, we observed a clear differentiation between the EGFR mutant and wild-type expression levels from single cells in Nanowell, and
the bulk expression measurements matched the corresponding Nanowell signal, with high statistical significance (P < 0.0001 for both cases, t test). (C) Bulk
gene expression among five NSCLC cell lines (A549, H661, H1650, H1975, and HCC827), a noncancerous fibroblast cell line (PCS-201), and WBCs are shown by
quantitative RT-PCR. The five cancer cell lines exhibited high TERT and MET gene expression, whereas the fibroblast cells and WBCs exhibited no TERT and low
MET expression. (D) Single-cell analysis using Nanowell on cancer and noncancer populations by RT-PCR expression analysis on H1650 and PCS-201 cell lines.
(Scale bar, 50 μm.) Each cell line was stained with different CellTracker dyes (green for H1650; orange for PCS-201) and then imaged to illustrate the con-
cordance between each cell’s Nanowell location and RT-PCR signal (TERT shown in blue). Nanowell showed a clear differentiation between H1650 (cancer; n =
16) and PCS-201 (noncancer; n = 14) cell lines based on TERT expression, with high statistical significance (P < 0.0001, t test).

 expressed high VIM only (Fig. 3 C, E, and F), which we attribute
to WBCs’ mesenchymal cell origin (34), whereas the second cell
population expressed high TERT, MET, and VIM, and variable
ALDH (Fig. 3 D–F), corresponding to H1650s bulk expression.
Importantly, these single-cell observations matched our bulk
analysis from Fig. 2 and Fig. S3. Quantitative analysis of total
gene expression, normalized by H1650 expression, indicated
differential TERT and MET expression in WBCs and H1650 cells
(P < 0.0001 for both cases, t test), indicating TERT and MET are
both excellent markers to identify cancer cells compared with
WBCs (Fig. 3E). Average VIM and ALDH expression was similar
between H1650 cells and WBCs, and H1650 expressed ALDH
with higher variance (Fig. 3F).
Multiplex Gene Expression Analysis of CTCs in NSCLC Cancer Patients.
Following a successful demonstration of multiplexed gene pro-
filing of individual cancer cells from cell lines in spiked blood, we
proceeded to analyze whole-blood samples from 55 human
subjects (from June 2014 to August 2016). We analyzed blood
from 20 healthy individuals from the Stanford Blood Center and
35 patients with stage IV NSCLC of adenocarcinoma histology
to first identify CTCs by single-cell TERT and MET expression
profiling, and second to determine whether these putative CTCs
were abundant in NSCLC and not in healthy patients (Fig. 3 G
and H and Table S1).
A representative stage IV Nanowell scan revealed a substantial
number of nanowells with positive TERT and MET signal from
single putative CTCs, whereas the healthy donor Nanowell exhibited
negligible signals (Fig. 3G). Putative CTCs were detected in almost
all advanced-stage NSCLC samples, from 0 to 181 [interquartile
range (IQR), 10–30] (Fig. 3H). In contrast, up to 7 positive wells
out of 25,600 were detected in healthy controls (IQR, 2–6).
Considering 7 or more putative CTCs in 2 mL as a positive
sample, we detected putative CTCs in 31 of 35 (88.6%) patients.
Because CellSearch detects clinically meaningful levels of CTCs in
just 53% of patients with advanced-stage NSCLC (35), our plat-
form demonstrated higher capability to identify putative CTCs.
Interestingly, a stage III NSCLC patient blood sample
revealed heterogeneity of expression across putative CTCs (Fig.
3I). From each cell’s multigene expression profile, a clear dif-
ferentiation between putative CTCs and WBCs emerged, as
predicted from the spike-in cell line experiments. Putative CTCs
were identified by their high expression of both TERT and MET,
whereas WBCs were identified by nanowells lacking TERT and

Validation of our integrated nanoplatform with blood samples. (A) Workflow schematic of validation experiments. H1650 cells were spiked into
whole-blood samples from healthy human subjects and processed through the MagSifter and Nanowell. (B) Scanned fluorescence images on Nanowell after
RT-PCR amplification of four genes on the spike-in cells recovered using MagSifter. (Scale bar, 50 μm.) These genes were selected to identify putative CTCs
(TERT and MET) and to demonstrate the multiplex capability of the assay using biologically informative targets (VIM and ALDH). Two major populations were
visually observed: one with a primarily red color (C) and another with a primarily yellow color (D). (C) This cell population primarily expressed VIM and none of
the other three assayed genes, which is characteristic of leukocytes (WBCs). (D) In contrast, a second cell population expressed TERT, MET, and VIM, and
partially expressed ALDH, which is characteristic of H1650 cancer cells. (E) Quantitative analysis of Nanowell after RT-PCR exhibited a clear differentiation of
TERT and MET expression levels between the cell populations in C and D (nominally WBCs and H1650 cells), with high statistical significance (P < 0.0001 for
both cases, t test). (F) Quantitative analysis of VIM and ALDH expression revealed similar VIM expression between the two cell populations, whereas the ALDH
expression in the latter cell population exhibited higher variance. (G) A two-channel fluorescence composite scan of the entire Nanowell array (25,600 wells)
after on-chip RT-PCR using TERT and MET probes shows a stage IV NSCLC patient sample (Left), with a substantial number of TERT and MET positive wells. In
contrast, the similar scan of a healthy donor blood sample (Right) lacked TERT and MET signal. (Scale bar, 1,000 μm.) (H) The MagSifter and Nanowell were
used for CTC identification in blood samples (defined as the population of EpCAM+ cells with expression of both TERT and MET in a nanowell). Our 55 assayed
samples consisted of 35 advanced-stage NSCLC samples and 20 healthy control samples. (I) Multigene expression of CTCs from NSCLC patient blood. A
representative portion of the fluorescence scan (superimposed in four channels) of a completed Nanowell multigene expression panel for a stage III NSCLC
patient sample displayed heterogeneous single-cell gene expression across nanowells. (Scale bar, 50 μm.) (J) A quantitative representation of the four-plex
data confirmed that putative CTCs exhibit high TERT and MET expression and variable VIM and ALDH expression. In contrast, WBCs exhibit high VIM ex-
pression, variable ALDH expression, and low TERT and MET expression.

 MET expression and exhibiting high VIM expression. Variable
VIM and ALDH expression was observed for putative CTCs (Fig. 3J),
which may reflect the heterogeneity of CTC populations present in
lung cancer patients (36, 37).
EGFR Mutation Detection in Single CTCs from NSCLC Patients. We
then used our integrated nanoplatform to detect the most common
and clinically relevant EGFR mutations (del19, L858R, and
T790M) in CTCs from seven stage IV NSCLC adenocarcinoma
patients who had known EGFR mutation status confirmed by tu-
mor biopsy. Putative CTCs were assessed for three genes: TERT,
the EGFR mutation (E746-A750del, L858R, or T790M), and the
corresponding EGFR wild type (Fig. 4). Because TERT gene ex-
hibits superior distinction on cancer cell identification (Fig. 2), pu-
tative CTCs were identified by high TERT expression. Notably, we
were able to accurately detect each patient’s known mutation from
their putative CTCs (Fig. 4 B, D, and F), whereas the “bulk” RT-
qPCR measurements from the same patient’s blood yielded un-
detectable levels of the assayed genes (Fig. 4 B and D). Putative
CTCs from E746-A750del visually appeared green (indicative of
the EGFR mutation), whereas yellow (EGFR wild type) was nearly
absent (Fig. 4A). Quantitative analysis of putative CTCs confirmed
that the majority of these were primarily EGFR mutant for del19,
with very low wild-type EGFR expression (Fig. 4B). Both L858R
and the T790M de novo mutations were also detected via our in-
tegrated nanoplatform, revealing the heterozygous expression of
both mutant and wild-type alleles (Fig. 4 C–F). We further examined
expression levels of EGFR mutations and their corresponding
wild-type genes in CTCs from seven advanced NSCLC patients with
known mutational statuses. Each putative CTC was identified by
EGFR and TERT expression, and heterogeneous levels of EGFR
expression across those CTCs were observed (Fig. 4G).
Assay Performance Comparison. As shown in Fig. S4, bulk PCR
measurements performed directly on patients’ whole blood yielded
undetectable signals for EGFR mutations (del19 and others). Al-
though EGFR wild type was found to be widely expressed from
bulk assays of advanced-stage patients’ blood, EGFR mutant genes
were not. In addition, we assessed the analytical sensitivity of
conventional PCR in vitro on NSCLC cell lines (HCC827 and
H1650). Our data indicate that, although conventional PCR can
reliably detect CTC-specific genes from a total of 100 cancer cells,
this signal fluctuates significantly for 10 cells and is undetectable
above background for <10 cells. Genes that were insufficiently
expressed (e.g., ALDH, as in Fig. S5) were not detectable above
threshold for samples of 10 or fewer cells. We also note that these
experiments were performed on homogenized cell populations to
extrapolate the number of cells in a sample, so this approach is
expected to yield the most consistent and reliable serial dilution
measurements. These observations confirm that conventional PCR
cannot reliably assay “enriched” samples of cell populations of <10
or fewer cells, and hence a higher sensitivity approach is needed to
reliably assay heterogeneous CTC populations for tumor-specific
and therapy-relevant mutant gene panels.
To investigate mutational detection directly from enriched CTC
population, we performed (i) a conventional PCR on extracted

Multigene expression of CTCs from NSCLC patient blood samples (results from three of the seven patient samples that were analyzed for CTC gene
mutation profiling are shown here). (A) Mutation detection assay on a stage IV NSCLC patient sample with EGFR del19 mutation previously confirmed by
primary tumor biopsy and sequencing. Using a three-plex assay of TERT (Cy5, shown in blue), EGFR E746-A750del (FAM, shown in green), and EGFR wild type
(HEX, shown in yellow), putative CTCs were identified by high TERT expression. (Scale bar, 50 μm.) (B) All TERT-positive wells (blue) exhibited EGFR mutant
signal (green) and very low EGFR wild-type signal (yellow), indicating that putative CTCs were detected and identified as primarily EGFR del19 mutant.
Subsequent quantitative analysis of TERT-positive wells confirmed the majority of identified putative CTCs were primarily EGFR del19 mutant. In addition, a
few putative CTCs also exhibited some EGFR wild-type signal. (C) Nanowell scan of the EGFR L858R mutation assay on a stage IV NSCLC patient sample with
EGFR L858R mutation. (D) Putative CTCs identified by their TERT expression exhibit heterozygous expression of both mutant and wild-type forms.
(E) Nanowell scan of the EGFR T790M mutation assay of a stage IV NSCLC patient sample with de novo EGFR T790M mutation. (F) Putative CTCs demonstrate
heterozygosity for the mutation. (G) Expression levels of EGFR mutations and their corresponding wild-type genes in CTCs from seven advanced NSCLC
patients. Each CTC was identified by EGFR and TERT expression. Although heterogeneous levels of CTCs and patterns of EGFR expression across those CTCs
were observed, follow-up work regarding these patients’ clinical outcomes is necessary for proper heterogeneity analysis.

 mRNAs from whole-blood samples of three advanced stage NSCLC
patients, (ii) a conventional PCR on enriched CTCs by the Mag-
Sifter technology, and 3) our proposed MagSifter–Nanowell assay in
a parallel manner, to compare their sensitivity. mRNAs from whole
blood and from enriched CTCs were extracted using the TRIzol
protocol described above. Two advanced-stage NSCLC patients with
the EGFR del19 mutation, and an advanced-stage NSCLC patient
with the EGFR T790M mutation were recruited for assay compar-
ison. In all cases of mRNA analysis from whole blood and enriched
CTCs, neither mutant genes (EGFR del19, and EGFR T790M) nor
TERT were detected (Fig. S5), whereas Nanowell could identify
putative CTCs, which are either EGFR mutant, EGFR wild type, or
both. This result agrees with our cell line experiment indicated
above, thus showing the greater sensitivity of the Nanowell assay,
especially when fewer numbers of CTCs are presented.
Additionally, to investigate Nanowell’s performance against ICC,
we recruited 11 NSCLC patients and 1 healthy donor to directly
compare the signal positivity for immunostaining (CK+, DAPI+,
and CD45−) and Nanowell RT-PCR assay (TERT+ and MET+)
(Table S2). Each patient’s sample was split into two 2-mL samples
for CTC assessment by both conventional enumeration (immu-
nostaining) and Nanowell assay. Note that each 2 mL of patient
blood was processed with MagSifter in parallel. Representative
immunostained CTCs are illustrated in Fig. S2. All resulting
immunostained CTCs were confirmed by a Stanford Hospital
pathologist. Enumeration results were positive for 3 of 11 cases
(defined as CTC > 1), whereas the Nanowell assay measured
positive signals above threshold for 8 of 11 cases, as shown in
Table 1 (the full analysis is given in Table S2). These observa-
tions indicate the higher sensitivity of our approach, which is
because of the signal amplification by PCR. We note that the 11
patients enrolled in this study spanned all lung cancer stages,
representing early-stage tumors that are thought to release low
numbers of CTCs and those more advanced tumors that are
expected to release more CTCs.
Discussion
Our integrated nanoplatform is a high-throughput, massively
parallel CTC enrichment and subsequent molecular character-
ization tool for tumor biology and, potentially, for clinical use as
a diagnostic/prognostic tool (38). It achieves accurate identifi-
cation of hundreds to thousands of putative CTCs with multiplex
gene mutation profiling capabilities. Each of the 25,600 nanowell
compartments are 20 × 20 × 50 μm3, with 20-pL volumes that are
106 times smaller than those of typical PCR assays, thereby en-
abling higher sensitivity from higher mRNA concentrations. To
this point, we observed that conventional RT-PCR assays of
mRNA extracted from patients’ blood yielded undetectable
TERT expression for all samples and no MET expression for
76% of patient samples (Fig. S4). Nanowell assays also achieve
excellent specificity by using hydrolysis probes (e.g., TaqMan).
Detection of EGFR mutations, such as del19, L858R, and
T790M, in lung cancer is now proving critical to inform clinical
treatment decisions with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
therapies (39). Because 15% of lung adenocarcinomas harbor
EGFR mutations—a number that is at least twice as high in the
Asian population—many patients undergoing treatment in clin-
ics for whom biopsy material is difficult to obtain may not be
receiving optimal therapy. Furthermore, because resistance in-
evitably develops in patient with EGFR driver mutations that are
treated over 12–24 months, and currently this can be monitored
only by imaging and clinical gestalt, blood biomarkers for disease
monitoring are desperately needed to guide management. Cir-
culating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising avenue to guide
therapy, but recent data suggest that CTCs may be a comple-
mentary, rather than extraneous, approach (40). For example,
ctDNA analysis from a del19 patient (Fig. 4A) using cancer
personalized profiling by deep sequencing (41) (CaPP-Seq) de-
tected del19 mutation at an allele frequency of 3.12%, indicating
nontrivial tumor burden with this particular mutation.
Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated the promising
potential of next-generation sequencing (NGS) profiling of CTCs
(29, 42), especially to inform prognostic assessment and precise
personalized cancer treatment (43). Unfortunately, widespread
adoption of NGS for single-CTC sequencing is currently hindered
by high costs and technical complexity for extracting clinically
actionable information. Our integrated nanoplatform has the ad-
vantages of lower cost (with reagent costs of ∼25 US dollars per
assay) and fast sample-to-answer time (Table S3) given its targeted
strategy. Nonetheless, we believe NGS is a powerful tool that will
become more cost-effective over time, and we envision using the
Nanowell as a validation tool to confirm targets on CTCs dis-
covered by whole-genome approaches.
The modular nature of our multiplex assay using “off-the-
shelf” commercial reagents provides versatility for exploring re-
search questions on individual CTCs and acts as a valuable tool for
CTC analysis. As an example, we have demonstrated heterogeneous
expression of ALDH and VIM on putative CTCs in this study. Cell
immortality and plasticity defined by these types of expression
markers are well established to be important in cancer progression.
Exactly how this type of CTC heterogeneity affects patient outcome
and relates to imaging and clinical parameters is an important, and
incipient, avenue of inquiry that should be pursued by research
laboratories in the field.
The technology reported here requires further optimization
before widespread application in clinical settings. First, com-
prehensive enrichment of an entire population of heterogeneous
CTCs requires the use of multiple capture antibodies. Although
our platform currently relies on EpCAM enrichment, the
Nanowell assay is highly sensitive and specific to tumor-derived
cells neglected by ICC (Fig. S2). Moreover, MagSifter can be
generalized to accommodate multiple cell capture antibodies
instead of, or in conjunction with, EpCAM. This approach would
broaden the platform’s utility to many other cancers that shed
CTCs [e.g., human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) for
breast cancer, neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2) for melanoma, and
carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) for renal cell carcinoma] and to
EpCAM-low and EpCAM-negative populations. Second, our
platform currently employs up to four fluorophores for multiplex
single-cell gene expression profiling, because primer–probe sets
are only commercially available in four discrete excitation–
emission spectra that can be resolved by conventional fluores-
cence microscopy. However, further modifications, including
Table 1.

 laser excitation, sharper bandpass filters, and narrower-emission
hydrolysis probes, may extend the platform’s multiplex capability
to accommodate 12 or more genes (26). This expansion will al-
low comprehensive mutational profiling to develop along with
clinical advances to capture a comprehensive panel of relevant
“actionable” mutations for therapy selection and disease moni-
toring. We also envision that the Nanowell as a clinical research
tool to study (i) the assessment of heterogeneity across CTCs
with patient’s clinical outcomes, (ii) lineage mapping studies of
biopsied primary tumor cells, (iii) correlation studies with cell-
free and ctDNA, and (iv) discrimination between benign and
malignant states for early cancer detection.
Materials and Methods
Patient Samples and Clinical Data. All patient-related research was approved
by the Stanford Institutional Review Board before study initiation and in-
formed consent was obtained from the participants. For each patient,
samples of whole blood were drawn into 10-mL Vacutainer K2-EDTA tubes
(Becton Dickinson), and sample ID numbers were assigned to anonymize
clinical identification. Healthy human blood samples were obtained from
the Stanford Blood Center (Palo Alto, CA), and patient blood samples were
drawn from those with NSCLC from Pulmonary, Medical Oncology, and
Radiation Oncology Clinics at Stanford University Medical Center. Healthy
donor samples were used for our spike-in experiments with cell lines and as
negative controls, whereas patient blood samples were processed for CTC
identification and mutation detection. Lung cancer diagnoses were
extracted from the medical record, and we defined advanced-stage NSCLC
here as stage IV by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC-7)
staging criteria.
Some NSCLC patient samples were plasma depleted for other research
purposes and then resuspended with an equal volume of 1× Gibco PBS buffer
(Life Technologies). All blood samples were processed as soon as possible after
blood draw (within 1–24 h). For each 7.5-mL blood sample, 2 mL was pro-
cessed with the MagSifter and ICC for CTC enumeration, 2 mL was in-
dependently processed with the integrated nanoplatform for single-CTC gene
expression and mutation analysis, and the remaining volume was allocated for
total mRNA extraction via a TRIzol protocol for bulk gene expression analysis.
Nanowell Processing. Following CTC enrichment by MagSifter and treatment of
the eluent with lysis buffer and DNase, the entire eluent was loaded into an
assembled Nanowell array (Fig. S1D), by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for
10 min. Because each Nanowell array contains 25,600 wells and the CTC
population from 2 mL of blood is expected to be no more than 2,000 cells,
each individual well has a 99.7% chance of containing either a single cell or no
cell, according to the Poisson distribution (Table S4), and only a 0.3% of
containing two or more cells, thereby representing a high-throughput method
of analyzing “single” cells. Identification of putative CTCs was then performed
as follows. First, fluorescence microscope images of the entire Nanowell array
were acquired for identification and exclusion of wells containing WBCs by
CD45 signal. Next, the entire Nanowell array was completely dried at 70 °C for
10 min to fix seeded cells into the wells and to completely deactivate the
DNase. Then, an RT-PCR master mix was applied, and the array was centri-
fuged for nanowell seeding at 3,000 rpm (Sorvale Legend RT Centrifuge;
Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min. The RT-PCR master mix consisted of 2×
reaction mix (CellsDirect One-Step qRT-PCR; Life Technologies), polymerases
(SuperScript III RT/Platinum Taq Mix; Life Technologies), TaqMan probes (Life
Technologies; Bio-Rad) for targeting specific genes, and diethylpyrocarbonate
(DEPC)-treated water (for detailed quantities, see Table S5). To prevent water
evaporation during PCR thermocycling, the array was then capped with a small
piece of adhesive PCR sealant film (Bio-Rad) and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for
10 min, and white mineral oil (W. S. Dodge Oil) was applied around the array
edges. The array was then loaded into a thermal cycler (PTC-200; Peltier
Thermal Cycler; Bio-Rad) using the following cycle parameters: for the first
thermal cycler step, cell lysis and subsequent reverse transcription, the array
was incubated at 50 °C for 45 min. This was followed by 10 cycles of 60 s at
95 °C for denaturation and 90 s at 65 °C for an annealing and extension step.
Amplification commenced after with 35 cycles of 60 s at 90 °C and 90 s at 60 °C.
Nanowell Signal Acquisition. For all Nanowell assays, automated scanning of the
full array was performed at Stanford University’s Cell Science Imaging Facility
(CSIF) on a Zeiss Axio Imager fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) with Zeiss ZEN
Pro software. Each Nanowell was imaged for FAM, HEX, Texas Red, and Cy5
fluorescence after single-cell RT-PCR with a ZEISS Axiocam 503 monochrome
camera. For each Nanowell, 100 regions of the array were imaged at 10×
magnification, and images were stitched together with ZEN Pro software.
Marker Gene and Fluorophore Selection. We reviewed the biomedical literature
using the search terms “circulating tumor cell,” “lung cancer,” and “blood” in
MEDLINE to identify potential biomarkers for single-cell expression analysis of
CTCs. We identified about 400 articles pertaining to lung cancer CTCs, and from
this literature, we identified TERT (29, 30, 44–48) and MET (31, 32, 49–52) as
promising marker genes for the CTC identification panel. TERT is up-regulated
by many oncogenes, and overexpression of TERT is well established as dysre-
gulated in cancers. TERT is required for the perpetuation of the malignant clone
during cancer progression as it elongates telomeres in each cell division, but is
not expressed in normal somatic cells. Similarly, hepatocyte growth factor re-
ceptor (HGFR), or MET, is a proto-oncogene whose up-regulation is closely as-
sociated with NSCLC. Similarly, we reviewed the literature and identified VIM
and ALDH as promising marker genes for the heterogeneity panel. VIM is an
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker, whose expression indicates
the increased potential for tumor metastasis (36). Multiple markers of cancer
cell stemness exist, but we chose ALDH as a marker that indicates tumorige-
nicity and clonogenicity of lung cancer (37) based on commercially available
primer–probe sets. Finally, for the therapy prediction and monitoring panel, we
selected EGFR E746-A750del mutation, its associated wild-type gene, and
TERT. Other clinically relevant EGFR mutations, including L858R and T790M,
can also be included as needed. Each marker was assigned a specific fluores-
cence channel: FAM (492-nm excitation, 517-nm emission) to TERT, HEX (530-nm
excitation, 556-nm emission) to MET, Texas Red (596-nm excitation, 615-nm
emission) to VIM, and Cy5 (650-nm excitation, 670-nm emission) to ALDH.
Four-Gene Expression Development. Simultaneous gene expression mea-
surement of two genes in the Nanowell array was previously reported (26). To
extend this capability to accommodate four-plex gene expression analysis on
a single cell, the procedure was optimized to avoid issues of reagent de-
pletion and weaker signal for lower-expressing genes (53). We selected
probes with four different fluorophores and minimal spectral overlap for
simultaneous four-plex gene expression capability. The four fluorophores,
FAM, HEX, Texas Red, and Cy5, had excitation and emission peaks of 492 and
517 nm, 530 and 556 nm, 596 and 615 nm, and 650 and 670 nm, respectively.
Primer–probe assays were obtained commercially: TERT (Life Technologies),
MET (Life Technologies), VIM (Bio-Rad), and ALDH (Bio-Rad). The four-plex
RT-PCR process was optimized on conventional bulk assay in a CFX96 Touch
Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).
Statistical Analysis. After single-cell RT-PCR and fluorescence image acquisi-
tion were performed, custom-developed MATLAB and R scripts were used to
analyze signals from the Nanowell arrays. For the diagnosis of NSCLC patients
with Nanowell assays for TERT and MET, the following protocol was per-
formed. Bright-field images acquired before and after single-cell RT-PCR
were first manually inspected for the pixel locations of the Nanowell array at
the top left, top right, and bottom left of the image area to be analyzed.
These pixel locations were entered into a MATLAB script that extracted the
pixel spacing information for the Nanowell array by using its natural peri-
odicity. The script then used this periodicity to extrapolate the location of
each nanowell within the image area of interest, and extracted the pixel
intensities within each nanowell for every fluorescence channel of interest.
As successful amplification in a nanowell results in an extremely bright spot
within the nanowell, it was determined that a metric comparing the dis-
persion of pixel intensities within each nanowell could determine whether
amplification had successfully occurred. Thus, a custom R script was used to
run an outlier detection algorithm for each fluorescence image, whereby a z
score for the variance in pixel intensity within each nanowell was computed
to determine the probability of each individual point being an outlier from
the entire population. Due to the large number of nanowells in each pop-
ulation (typically >5,000 per image analyzed), the central limit theorem
dictates that the distribution should follow a normal distribution, thus
allowing use of the Z test to identify outliers at a significance level of P <
0.05. Additionally, due to the large number of points tested per image,
Bonferroni correction was performed when conducting the Z test to avoid
excessive type I errors, with the Bonferroni correction commonly regarded as
one of the most conservative ways to control familywise error rates. The R
script then computed a count for the nanowells with z scores above this
threshold and classifies these nanowells as positive for the particular mea-
surement. The images in the individual fluorescence channels were analyzed
separately, and the nanowell counts were then collated either individually (as
in the PE-fluorescence image pre–RT-PCR when excluding nanowells with
WBCs) or together (as per the use of both FAM and HEX channel images when

 enumerating potentially cancerous entities after RT-PCR). For all analysis
of images acquired by the Zeiss Axio Imager, including the EGFR mutation
assay and the four-marker gene expression panel, individual nanowell
fluorescence intensities were extracted from ZEN Pro for each channel and
collated manually after subtraction of background intensities from the
empty nanowells.
Identification of Putative CTCs. In this study, “putative CTCs” are mostly de-
fined as cells with the multigene signature having high expression in both
TERT and MET genes. This multigene approach yields the best assay perfor-
mance (compared with a single-gene assay of either TERT or MET) by mini-
mizing the frequency of “false positives” that are acquired because of intrinsic
and extrinsic sources of background noise. In addition, for mutational de-
tection purposes, we define putative CTCs as cells having either TERT and an
EGFR mutation gene, or TERT and the corresponding EGFR wild-type gene.
Transcriptomic profiles of putative CTCs are stable up to 12 hours from the
blood draw (Fig. S6).
