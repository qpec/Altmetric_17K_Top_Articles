Abstract
Background: Preterm prelabour rupture of the fetal membranes (PPROM) precedes 30% of preterm births and
is a risk factor for early onset neonatal sepsis. As PPROM is strongly associated with ascending vaginal
infection, prophylactic antibiotics are widely used. The evolution of vaginal microbiota compositions
associated with PPROM and the impact of antibiotics on bacterial compositions are unknown.
Methods: We prospectively assessed vaginal microbiota prior to and following PPROM using MiSeq-based
sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and examined the impact of erythromycin prophylaxis on bacterial
load and community structures.
Results: In contrast to pregnancies delivering at term, vaginal dysbiosis characterised by Lactobacillus spp.
depletion was present prior to the rupture of fetal membranes in approximately a third of cases (0% vs. 27%,
P = 0.026) and persisted following membrane rupture (31%, P = 0.005). Vaginal dysbiosis was exacerbated by
erythromycin treatment (47%, P = 0.00009) particularly in women initially colonised by Lactobacillus spp.
Lactobacillus depletion and increased relative abundance of Sneathia spp. were associated with subsequent
funisitis and early onset neonatal sepsis.
Conclusions: Our data show that vaginal microbiota composition is a risk factor for subsequent PPROM and
is associated with adverse short-term maternal and neonatal outcomes. This highlights vaginal microbiota as
a potentially modifiable antenatal risk factor for PPROM and suggests that routine use of erythromycin for
PPROM be re-examined.

Background
Preterm birth and its associated complications are the
leading cause of death for children under the age of five
worldwide [1]. Survivors often suffer significant motor
and sensory deficits, learning disabilities and respiratory
disorders [2]. Rupture of the fetal membranes prior to
37 weeks of gestation and before the onset of labour,
termed preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes
(PPROM), occurs prior to 30% of all spontaneous preterm
births [3]. Both pathogenesis of membrane rupture and
subsequent maternal and neonatal morbidities are strongly
associated with infection [4, 5]. It is hypothesised that
colonisation of the vagina with pathogenic bacteria activate
the local and upper (cervical and fetal membrane) innate
immune system [3, 6], driving an inflammatory cascade
[7–10] that leads to remodelling and disruption of mem-
brane architecture and premature rupture [11]. In 80% of
cases, delivery occurs within 9 days of rupture [12], during
which time the uterine cavity, placenta and fetus are

 exposed to ascending infection and increased risk of chor-
ioamnionitis and funisitis, which are associated with poor
maternal and neonatal outcomes [13–19].
While the vaginal microbiota composition of non-
pregnant women is temporally dynamic [20], healthy preg-
nancy is characterised by a shift towards stable, low-richness
and low-diversity community structures dominated by
Lactobacillus spp. [21–23] that inhibit growth of pathogenic
bacteria [24]. However, recent studies have found that the
dominance of vaginal bacterial communities by L. iners is a
risk factor for preterm birth [25, 26]. The absence of Lacto-
bacillus spp. and polymicrobial colonisation of the vagina
have long been recognised as a risk factor for PPROM [27],
preterm birth [28–31] and histological chorioamnionitis
[32–34]. Despite a well-described infectious aetiology and
high prevalence of chorioamnionitis in PPROM patients, the
few studies to have examined vaginal bacterial composition
in women with PPROM are limited to small sample sizes
collected only after membrane rupture [35–37].
The clinical management of PPROM is challenging, in-
volving an assessment of the balance between prolongation
of pregnancy to enable fetal maturation, and risk of infec-
tion and subsequent poor neonatal outcomes. As a result,
management during this latency period is controversial and
varies widely [38]. In many countries, PPROM is managed
conservatively with patients receiving steroids to promote
fetal lung maturation and prophylactic administration of
oral erythromycin at a dose of 250 mg for 10 days [39, 40].
In the presence of clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis, pa-
tients are treated with intravenous antibiotics and delivery
is expedited [40]. The widespread use of erythromycin for
PPROM is based upon the short-term neonatal benefits re-
ported in the ORACLE I trial, which compared erythro-
mycin
to
co-amoxiclav
(amoxicillin
and
clavulanate
potassium) or placebo [41]. The continued use of erythro-
mycin for PPROM is contentious considering the lack of
identifiable long-term neonatal benefits [42, 43], limited
coverage of gram negative bacteria [44], Mycoplasma spp.
or Ureaplasma spp. [45], rising resistance [46] and recent
association with increased risk of cerebral palsy, epilepsy
[42, 47] as well as asthma and obesity [48].
Developing a comprehensive understanding of the vagi-
nal microbiota composition and its response to antibiotic
treatment in pregnancies complicated by PPROM is, there-
fore, of paramount importance for improved diagnostic,
preventative and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we ex-
amined vaginal microbiota compositions prior to and fol-
lowing PPROM, both before and following erythromycin
prophylaxis, and correlated these findings with evidence of
funisitis and neonatal sepsis.
Methods
The study was approved by the National Research Ethics
Service Committee London–Stanmore of the National
Health Service (REC 14/LO/0328), and all participants pro-
vided written informed consent.
Study design
We performed a prospective cohort study whereby women
with and without risk factors for preterm birth were re-
cruited between 8 and 12 weeks from the preterm surveil-
lance and antenatal clinics of Queen Charlotte’s and Chelsea
Hospital and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital between
January 2013 and August 2014 (n = 250). Exclusion criteria
included women under 18 years of age, multiple pregnan-
cies, sexual intercourse or vaginal bleeding within 72 hours
of sampling, and HIV or hepatitis C positive status. Under
direct visualisation, cervico-vaginal fluid was sampled from
the posterior fornix using a BBL CultureSwab MaxV Liquid
Amies swab (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Oxford, UK)
at each of the following timepoints: 8–12, 19–25, 27–30 and
32–36 weeks of pregnancy gestation. The vaginal swabs
were placed immediately on ice before being snap frozen
and stored at -80 °C within 5 min of collection.
A second cohort were recruited upon presentation with
ruptured membranes between October 2013 and June
2015 (n = 87). As per participating hospitals guidelines,
PPROM was defined as a rupture of the fetal membranes,
diagnosed by pooling of amniotic fluid on speculum
examination, prior to 37 weeks gestation more than
24 hours prior to spontaneous preterm delivery or clinic-
ally indicated delivery or induction of labour. Swabs were
taken upon presentation before erythromycin treatment,
48 hours after erythromycin treatment, and 1 and 2 weeks
post-diagnosis. Patients referred from other hospital sites
for specialist neonatal care with a prior diagnosis of
PPROM who had already started erythromycin were sam-
pled upon arrival and 1 week later, if undelivered.
All patients were treated conservatively as per the United
Kingdom Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology
guidelines [40] and the policy of the admitting hospital,
which involved receiving antenatal steroids for fetal lung
maturation (if less than 34 weeks gestation) and oral erythro-
mycin 250 mg four times a day for 10 days. Delivery was ex-
pedited or induced in the presence of fetal distress, clinical
signs of chorioamnionitis or at 34 completed weeks of gesta-
tion. All patients received intrapartum antibiotics in the
form of intravenous benzylpenicillin and the eventual mode
of delivery was at the discretion of the attending clinician.
Histological examination of the placenta and fetal
membranes was performed following PPROM as per
routine practice in the study. Chorioamnionitis was de-
fined as the presence of polymorphonuclear cells within
the amnion or chorion whilst funisitis was defined by
the presence of polymorphonuclear cells (of fetal origin)
within the Wharton’s jelly of the umbilical cord.
Early onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) is defined as the
presence of confirmed or suspected sepsis at ≤3 days

 after birth for which neonatal antibiotic treatment was
prolonged beyond the routine 48 hours of prophylaxis.
Confirmed sepsis was established by positive blood cul-
tures whilst suspected sepsis was diagnosed in the pres-
ence of clinical suspicion of sepsis (lethargy, apnoea,
respiratory distress, hypoperfusion and shock) supported
by elevated neonatal C-reactive protein (CRP) (>10 mg/
dl) or blood film suggestive of bacteraemia. Detailed ma-
ternal and neonatal metadata were collected for all par-
ticipants from the hospital case notes and the electronic
patient databases Cerner Millennium®, Powerchart® and
Badger.net.
DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing
DNA extraction from vaginal swabs and confirmation of
DNA integrity by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifi-
cation was performed as previously described [22]. The
V1–V2 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA genes were
amplified for sequencing using forward and reverse fusion
primers. The forward primer consisted of an Illumina i5
adapter
(5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTA-
CAC-3′), an 8-base-pair (bp) bar code, a primer pad (for-
ward, 5′-TATGGTAATT-3′), and the 28 F primer (5′-
GAGTTTGATCNTGGCTCAG-3′) [49]. The reverse fu-
sion primer was constructed with an Illumina i7 adapter
(5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT-3′),
an
8-
bp bar code, a primer pad (reverse, 5′-AGTCAGTCAG-
3′), and the 388R primer (5′-TGCTGCCTCCCGTAG-
GAGT-3′). Sequencing was performed at RTL Genomics
(Lubbock, TX, USA) using an Illumina MiSeq platform
(Illumina Inc).
Resulting sequence data were analysed using the MiSeq
standard operating procedure pipeline of the Mothur
package [50]. Sequence alignment was performed using
the Silva bacterial database (www.arb-silva.de/), and classi-
fication was performed using the Ribosomal Database
Project (RDP) database reference sequence files and the
Wang method [51]. The RDP MultiClassifier script was
used for determination of operational taxonomic unit
taxonomies (phylum to genus) and species-level taxon-
omies were determined using USEARCH [52]. To avoid
sequencing bias, data were resampled and normalised to
the lowest read count (n = 6940).
Public access to sequence data and accompanying meta-
data can be obtained from the Sequence Read Archive of
the European Nucleotide Archive (PRJEB21325).
Quantitative bacteriology
The total number of 16S rRNA gene copies per swab
was measured as a representation of the total bacterial
load. A bacterial DNA template was used for broad
coverage quantitative real-time PCR using the Bact-
QUANT method [53]. For this, a tenfold standard curve
(30 to 3,000,000 copies) of Escherichia coli 16S DNA
(Sigma, D4889) was generated and each standard was
combined with 5 μl of sample DNA templates and plat-
inum PCR-supermix UDG containing 50 nM Rox (Life
Tech, cat. no. 11730-017), BactQUANT forward primer
sequence (5' CCT ACG GGA GGC AGC A), BactQuant
reverse primer sequence (5' GGA CTA CCG GGT ATC
TAA TC) and BactQUANT probe (Life Tech, cat. no.
4316034, 6000pmol scale) sequence 5' 6FAM-CAG CAG
CCG CGG TA-MGBNFQ. Template-free PCR controls
and sham digest controls were included in each run.
Bacterial load was displayed as copy number per swab
corrected for variation of 16S rRNA gene copy propor-
tional to bacterial species abundance in each swab. For
this, 16S rRNA gene copy number of bacterial species
comprising >95% of sequence reads for each swab was
identified using the Michigan rrn database (https://
rrndb.umms.med.umich.edu/) and weighted for relative
abundance. Bacterial load values were then normalised
to the weighted copy number. Where operon copy num-
ber was not available at the species level, average copy
number at the genera level was used.
Statistical analysis
Examination of statistical differences between vaginal
microbiota was performed at genera and species taxo-
nomic levels using the Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic
Profiles software package (STAMP) [54]. Samples were
classified into eight vaginal microbiota groups (VMGs)
according to Ward’s linkage hierarchical clustering analysis
of bacterial species using a clustering density threshold of
0.75 with the 50 most abundant species displayed. Clusters
were then sub-grouped based on Lactobacillus abundance
into Lactobacillus dominant (>80%), intermediate abun-
dance (33–78%) and depleted/dysbiotic (<10%).
The significance of differences between richness and di-
versity measures, bacterial load and relative abundance of
species and genera data between patient groups was
assessed using one-way ANOVA with Dunn’s multiple com-
parisons and the Mann–Whitney t-test where appropriate.
The linear discriminant analysis with effect size (LEfSe)
method [55] was used to identify differentially abundant
taxonomic features between patient groups of interest. An
α value of 0.05 was used for the factorial Kruskal–Wallis
test between classes and a minimum threshold of 2.0 was
used for the logarithmic latent discriminatory analysis
(LDA) score for discriminative features for all LEfSe plots.
Transition of the VMGs following administration of
erythromycin was visualised using a Sankey plot created in
the JavaScript Sankey Diagram package from Google Charts
(https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gal-
lery/sankey). A statistical comparison of data from paired
samples obtained before and after erythromycin was admin-
istered was performed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test.

 To assess the statistical significance of dysbiosis and
microbiome groups, we performed linear regression ana-
lysis in the R programming environment. Specifically, we
used the function lmer() (R package lme4 version 1.1-7,
http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4) where paired
samples were present and lm() where no paired samples
were present. For each analysis, a false discovery rate ad-
justment (Benjamin and Hochberg) was applied to cor-
rect P values. In total, four analyses were carried out as
follows:
(i) Analysis of differences in microbiome composition
between patient groups and dysbiosis/microbiome
groups. An indicator variable is created, where the
indicator is 1 for samples that could be assigned to
the given dysbiosis or microbiome group and the
indicator is 0 for all other samples. This indicator
variable is regressed against pairs of patient groups
adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity, body mass
index, smoking status, cervical stitch and
progesterone treatment. Where paired samples were
available, the model also included the patient ID
modelled as a random effect.
(ii)Analysis of differences in microbiome composition
between PPROM patients (n = 16) before
erythromycin was given and 48 hours thereafter. As
above, an indicator variable is created and regressed
against the time point. As all samples are paired, no
additional predictors are included in the model.
(iii)Analysis of differences in microbiome composition
between healthy patients and patients with
chorioamnionitis or funisitis. As above an indicator
variable is created and regressed against the
chorioamnionitis/funisitis status adjusted for
maternal age, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking
status, cervical stitch, progesterone usage and
latency.
(iv)Analysis of differences in microbiome composition
between PPROM patients with and without EONS.
As above, an indicator variable is created and
regressed against the EONS status adjusted for
maternal age, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking
status, cervical stitch and progesterone usage.
Results
Baseline clinical characteristics of the study cohort
A total of 250 pregnant women were prospectively
recruited while attending a prematurity surveillance clinic
after a history of preterm birth or mid-trimester loss and
followed up at 8–12, 19–25, 27–30 and 32–36 weeks of
gestation. The majority of these patients delivered at term
(n = 212, 85%). Of those who delivered preterm after
<37 weeks of gestation (38/250, 15%), 15 experienced
PPROM and were sampled at a mean gestational age of 30
+1 weeks. Samples collected at 27–30 weeks (mean
29 weeks) from 20 patients who delivered at term follow-
ing uncomplicated pregnancy were used as gestational age
matched controls. An additional 87 women presenting
acutely with PPROM at a mean gestational age of 28+1
weeks were recruited; 39 were sampled before erythro-
mycin prophylaxis, 48 after erythromycin only. Of these
women, 16 were sampled both before and after erythro-
mycin treatment.
There was no significant difference in maternal age (P
= 0.93, Mann–Whitney) or ethnicity (P = 0.92, Fisher’s
exact)
between
prospectively
recruited
control
or
PPROM cases or women presenting with PPROM
(Table 1). Women who were recruited after PPROM had
membrane rupture at an earlier gestational age than
those who were sampled prior to rupture (27+0 vs. 34+4
weeks, P = 0.0011; Mann–Whitney). Gestational age at
delivery (30+4 vs. 34+4 weeks, P = 0.0142), 1-minute post-
delivery Apgar scores (6 vs. 9, P = 0.004) and birth
weight (1550 g vs. 2285 g, P = 0.0194, Mann–Whitney)
were lower in this cohort compared to prospectively
sampled women subsequently experiencing PPROM,
whereas admissions to the neonatal unit were higher
(68% vs. 20%, P = 0.00094, Fisher’s exact).
Vaginal microbiota composition prior to and following
PPROM
A total of 4,542,391 high quality reads were generated in
the study, with a mean read count per sample of 27,530
(range 6940 to 163,610). After removing singletons and
rare operational taxonomic units (<10 reads per sample), a
total of 37, 84 and 332 taxa were identified in vaginal swabs
collected from controls, women who subsequently devel-
oped PPROM and women sampled at time of PPROM
presentation, respectively.
Samples were classified into eight VMGs using hierarch-
ical clustering of relative abundance data from the top 50
bacterial species identified (accounting for >95% of all se-
quence reads) (Fig. 1). VMGs 1, 3, 4 and 5 were charac-
terised by the dominance of Lactobacillus species: L. iners
(>92% relative abundance, VMG 1), L. crispatus (>93%,
VMG 3), L. gasseri (>80%, VMG 4) and L. jensenii (>92%,
VMG 5), consistent with previous descriptions of vaginal
bacterial communities in non-pregnant [56, 57] and preg-
nant populations [22, 23]. VMGs 2 and 6 were charac-
terised by reduced L. iners (33–68%) and L. crispatus (51–
78%) dominance, respectively, and significantly elevated
diversity and richness (Additional file 1: Figure S1). VMG
7 was characterised by low relative abundance of Lactoba-
cillus spp. (<1%, VMG 7) and low diversity. VMG 8 had
low Lactobacillus spp. levels (<10%) but high diversity and
richness (Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Table S1). VMGs
were alternatively grouped according to relative abun-
dance of Lactobacillus spp. into dominant (VMGs 1, 3, 4
Brown et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:9 
Page 4 of 15
 and 5), intermediate (VMGs 2 and 6) and depleted (VMG
7 and 8) categories.
Vaginal microbial communities isolated from control
women sampled at 28 weeks of gestation were charac-
terised by low richness and diversity and dominance by
Lactobacillus spp. (Fig. 1a–d). In contrast, women sampled
antenatally who subsequently experienced PPROM had a
higher proportion of microbiota profiles characterised by
intermediate or low Lactobacillus spp. dominance and high
diversity (7/15, P = 0.011, Fisher’s exact). Significant differ-
ences in the proportion of Lactobacillus spp. dominant,
intermediate and depleted communities remained when
analyses were adjusted for potential confounders, including
maternal age, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking status
and treatment interventions (cervical stitch or progesterone
therapy) (Additional file 1: Table S2).
To identify vaginal bacteria associated with PPROM risk,
we used LEfSe on 16S rRNA data collected from control
patients and women sampled antenatally prior to PPROM.
Samples from the latter cohort were enriched in bacteria
classes Bacteroidales, Fusobacteriales and Clostridiales,
whereas increased Lactobacillales was predictive of normal-
term delivery (Fig. 2a–d).
Impact of membrane rupture on the vaginal microbiome
Membrane rupture prior to erythromycin prophylaxis was
associated with a reduction in bacterial load compared to
both control (P = 9.37 × 10-8) and PPROM cases (P =
0.0011) sampled prior to membrane rupture (Fig. 1e). Al-
though a similar proportion of Lactobacillus spp. depleted,
high-diversity communities were observed post-rupture
(Fig. 1b), membrane rupture was associated with a signifi-
cant increase in richness (P = 0.000001, Fig. 1c) and alpha
diversity (P = 0.00194, Fig. 1d). LEfSe analysis identified 20
genera
positively
associated
with
membrane
rupture
(Additional

including
Prevotella,
Staphylococcus, Aerococcus and Streptococcus spp., and a
negative association with Lactobacillus spp.
The effect of erythromycin treatment on vaginal
microbiota following PPROM
Analysis of cross-sectional samples taken after PPROM
following 48 hours of oral erythromycin treatment
(average 8 × 250 mg doses) demonstrated a strong shift
towards dysbiosis as characterised by a reduction in the
proportion of Lactobacillus spp. dominated vaginal
microbiota and an increase in intermediate communi-
ties (Fig. 1b, P = 0.001, Fisher’s exact, Additional file 1:
Table S2) that persisted for up to 1 week of treatment.
Treatment beyond 1 week was associated with a reduc-
tion of intermediate communities and an increase in
Lactobacillus spp. dominance. However, the proportion
of dysbiotic vaginal microbiota remained constant. Bac-
terial richness (Fig. 1c), diversity (Fig. 1d) and load
(Fig. 1e) remained unchanged following erythromycin
treatment at all time points. Similar results were

 Fig. 1 Decreased vaginal Lactobacillus spp. abundance occurs prior to PPROM and is further exacerbated by membrane rupture and erythromycin
treatment. a Ward’s linkage hierarchical clustering analysis of vaginal bacterial species data from cervical vaginal fluid samples (n = 165) collected from
women with uncomplicated term delivery, sampled at 28 weeks (n = 20), pre-PPROM (n = 15), following PPROM before erythromycin (n = 39), after 48 hours
of erythromycin (n = 43), 48 hours to 1 week of erythromycin (n = 22) and >1 week of erythromycin treatment (n = 26). Vaginal bacterial communities were
classified based on Lactobacillus spp. abundance into dominant, intermediate and depleted, and further into eight vaginal microbiota groups: VMG 1: L.
iners dominant, VMG 2: L. iners high diversity, VMG 3: L. crispatus dominant, VMG 4: L. gasseri dominant, VMG 5: L. jensenii dominant, VMG 6: L. crispatus high
diversity, VMG 7: Lactobacillus spp. depleted and low diversity, VMG 8: Lactobacillus spp. depleted and high diversity. b Relative Lactobacillus spp. abundance
is significantly lower in the pre-PPROM and membrane rupture groups compared to gestation age matched and normal pregnancy controls
(P = 0.011). Erythromycin treatment exacerbates Lactobacillus spp. depletion and expansion of dysbiotic vaginal communities (P = 0.001).
Reduced Lactobacillus spp. abundance is accompanied by a reciprocal increase in c richness and d diversity. e Bacterial load is significantly
higher pre-membrane rupture in comparison to post-membrane rupture (P = 9.37 × 10-8) but remains stable thereafter, despite ongoing

 observed in paired samples taken before and 48 hours
after erythromycin treatment (n = 16, Fig. 3a–d). A sub-
analysis of women with Lactobacillus spp. dominance
prior to erythromycin exposure (n = 10) showed that
treatment was associated with a shift towards an inter-
mediate or dysbiotic community structure in 80% of
cases (8/10, P = 0.009, Fisher’s exact, Fig. 3a, Additional
file 1: Table S3), a significant decrease in Lactobacillus
spp. relative abundance (P = 0.0039, Wilcoxon matched
pairs, Fig. 3h) and increased diversity (P = 0.0098, Wil-
coxon matched pairs) (Fig. 3e,f). In contrast, erythro-
mycin treatment was associated with a reduction in
both richness (P = 0.031) and diversity (P = 0.031, Wil-
coxon matched pairs) in samples collected from women
with Lactobacillus spp. depletion prior to treatment

 Relationship between vaginal microbiota composition
and chorioamnionitis with funisitis
Histopathologic examination of placenta, fetal membranes
and umbilical cord was performed following delivery for 53
PPROM cases (53/87, 61%). Evidence of chorioamnionitis
with funisitis, chorioamnionitis or normal histology were
reported in 34 (64%), 4 (8%), and 15 (28%) cases respect-
ively. Cases of chorioamnionitis and chorioamnionitis with
funisitis were combined for further analyses. The average
gestational age for membrane rupture in women with chor-
ioamnionitis +/- funisitis was similar to those with normal
histology [26+3 (25+3–27+2) vs. 27+1 (25+3–28+6) gestation
weeks, P = 0.43, Mann–Whitney test]. The average latency
between membrane rupture and delivery was not statisti-
cally different between groups [6.8 (5–8.7) days for those
with chorioamnionitis +/- funisitis vs. 24.7 (6.2–43.2) days
for normal histology, P = 0.88, Mann–Whitney], gestational
age at delivery was significantly lower for those cases com-
plicated by chorioamnionitis +/- funisitis [27+3 (26+3–28+2)
vs. 31+5 (29+4–33+6) gestational weeks, P = 0.009, Mann–
Whitney, Additional file 1: Table S4].
Examination of vaginal microbiota composition in
samples obtained just prior to delivery showed that
chorioamnionitis with funisitis was associated with en-
richment for Prevotella, Sneathia, Peptostreptococcus
and Catonella spp. and reduced Lactobacillus spp. levels
(P = 0.0025) compared to women with normal histology
(Fig. 4a–c, Additional file 1: Table S5). Chorioamnionitis
with funisitis was associated with increased vaginal
alpha diversity (P = 0.0134, Mann–Whitney, Fig. 4e),
but not richness (Fig. 4d) or bacterial load (Fig. 4f).
Maternal CRP (P = 0.000016) and white cell count (WCC)
(P = 0.0016, Mann–Whitney U) (Fig. 4g,h) were elevated
in patients with chorioamnionitis with funisitis and
both were significantly correlated with vaginal bacterial
alpha diversity (WCC; rho = 0.54, P = 0.0001 and CRP;
rho = 0.45, P = 0.0013) (Fig. 4i,j).

gender, mode of delivery, arterial cord pH and latency

closest to the time of delivery were enriched for Cato-
nella spp. and Sneathia spp. in cases developing EONS,

Other
species
previously
associated with EONS, including Streptococcus agalac-
tiae, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli,
were frequently observed in vaginal samples collected
from EONS-complicated pregnancies but not in samples
isolated from uncomplicated controls (Fig. 4c). Similar
results were obtained when the analysis was repeated
only for those mothers who delivered at 28 weeks or
sooner (n = 27) (Additional file 1: Figure S3).
Discussion
Infection is strongly associated with PPROM and as a re-
sult, empiric antibiotic therapy is routinely used, particu-
larly in high-income countries [58]. In this study, we show

 that vaginal dysbiosis is present prior to the rupture of
fetal membranes in approximately a third of cases and is
associated with both chorioamnionitis with funisitis and
with EONS. Reported benefits of antibiotic treatment fol-
lowing PPROM are often attributed to the prevention of
neonatal infection caused by ascending colonisation of
pathogenic bacteria originating from the vagina [59]. We,
therefore, hypothesised that prophylactic erythromycin
would lead to a reduction of vaginal bacterial load, diversity
and richness. However, treatment was associated with a
shift towards vaginal dysbiosis, particularly in women ini-
tially colonised predominately by Lactobacillus species. Our
sub-analysis showed that in women with Lactobacillus spp.
dominance, erythromycin exposure was associated with a
shift towards a dysbiotic community structure in most
cases. In contrast, erythromycin treatment was associated
with a reduction in both richness and diversity in women
with a Lactobacillus spp. depleted vaginal microbiota.
There are, therefore, two groups of women who experience
PPROM, for one of which erythromycin therapy is detri-
mental and for the other potentially beneficial. This has im-
portant implications for the continued use of prophylactic
erythromycin in the context of PPROM, as is currently rec-
ommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [60]
and professional bodies throughout the world including
the United Kingdom [40], Canada [61], Germany [62],
Australia and New Zealand [63].
Lactobacillus-depleted
high-diversity
vaginal
bacterial
communities have been identified as risk factors for pre-
term birth in prospective studies using both culture-
dependent [29, 64] and culture-independent [30, 31]
methods. The pathophysiology linking vaginal dysbiosis to
activation of inflammation and untimely stimulation of pro-
labour pathways in gestational tissues is well documented
[6, 65, 66]. Our results indicate that around one third of pa-
tients have vaginal dysbiosis prior to membrane rupture,
providing further evidence for ascending vaginal infection
in the pathophysiology of PPROM and preterm birth.
Haematogenous infection of the gestational tissues leading
to rupture may be responsible for a small proportion of
PPROM cases. However, a non-infectious mechanism is
likely responsible for the remainder. Therefore, patient-
specific selection of targeted antibiotic therapy may im-
prove efficacy and patient outcomes.
Moreover, vaginal dysbiosis just prior to delivery was
strongly associated with both chorioamnionitis with
funisitis and maternal serum markers of infection and
inflammation. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses
showed that erythromycin failed to resolve this dysbiosis
within 1 week of treatment, which coincides with deliv-
ery in approximately 80% of cases, and instead was asso-
ciated with a significant and persistent increase in
dysbiotic community structures. This increase was par-
ticularly apparent in women with initial colonisation of
Lactobacillus species. In women with pre-existing dys-
biosis, erythromycin was associated with a reduction in
species richness and diversity. However, communities
continued to be depleted of Lactobacillus species, indi-
cating there was a restructuring of the highly diverse
compositions. Erythromycin treatment beyond 1 week
was associated with a recovery of pre-treatment levels of
Lactobacillus species dominance. However, the propor-
tion of dysbiotic communities remained unchanged
throughout the treatment course.
The use of erythromycin treatment for PPROM is
largely driven by results from the ORACLE I trial, which
reported prolongation of pregnancy for 48 hours (34.8%
vs. 40.7%, P = 0.004), reduced need for supplemental
oxygen (31.1% vs. 35.6%, P = 0.02) and a 2.2% reduction
in
composite
neonatal
morbidity
(neonatal
death,
chronic lung disease or major cerebral abnormality;
11.2% vs. 14.4%, P = 0.02) in women randomised to or-
ally administered erythromycin prophylaxis compared to
placebo [67]. The trial also included randomisation arms
of co-amoxiclav and co-amoxiclav plus erythromycin,
which were both associated with a significant increase in
the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (1.9% vs. 0.5%, P =
0.001 and 1.7% vs. 0.5%, P = 0.005, respectively). The de-
cision to test these antibiotics in the trial was based
upon their broad spectrum, complementary ranges of
activities, comparatively minimal contraindications in
pregnancy and the opportunity to test a macrolide and
β-lactam antibiotic. Beneficial outcomes associated with
erythromycin treatment in PPROM are often attributed
to its assumed inhibition of ascending vaginal infection,
but this seems unlikely considering erythromycin con-
centration in the vaginal lumen following oral dosing is
low [68], reaching a mean inhibitory concentration ef-
fective against Lactobacillus species [44, 69, 70], but not
against most other species known to colonise the vagina
[44]. This provides a possible explanation for the reduc-
tion of Lactobacillus spp. and increased diversity and
richness of bacterial communities observed in our study
following erythromycin treatment that occurred without
a reduction in overall bacterial load.
Despite adverse effects on vaginal microbiota compos-
ition, reported improvements in neonatal and maternal
outcomes following erythromycin treatment for PPROM
may be attributable to anti-bacterial activity at other ges-
tational tissue sites (e.g. the placenta) or to other modes
of action. Erythromycin is used primarily as an anti-
inflammatory for the treatment of chronic inflammatory
lung disease (panbronchiolitis) [71, 72] and has been
shown to have tocolytic action in vitro [73]. Considering
that the placental transfer of erythromycin into the fetal
circulation is low (approximately 2%) [74], neonatal ben-
efits are more likely due to action on maternal tissues
and subsequent inhibition of inflammatory mediators
Brown et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:9 
Page 11 of 15
 that could cross the placenta. Nevertheless, vaginal de-
livery acts as a high-dose inoculum to the neonate,
which shapes the composition of the early infant gut
microbiome [25, 75–78], which is in turn linked to
short-term and long-term health outcomes [79, 80].
Therefore, aberrant augmentation of vaginal bacterial
communities towards dysbiosis just prior to delivery is
undesirable and may contribute to poor neonatal out-
comes. In our study, vaginal dysbiosis and enrichment
of Sneathia spp. and other potential pathogenic bac-
teria (e.g. Streptococcus agalactiae) just prior to delivery
were observed in cases subsequently developing EONS.
Sneathia spp. are often associated with bacterial vagin-
osis [81] and their colonisation of the vagina has been
linked to various adverse pregnancy outcomes includ-
ing septic abortion [82], neonatal bacteraemia [83],
neonatal meningitis [84] and chorioamnionitis [85]. Va-
ginal bacterial communities isolated from cases subse-
quently developing EONS were almost entirely void of
Lactobacillus crispatus. Colonisation of L. crispatus is
highly stable in healthy pregnancies from similar co-
horts to those studied here [22, 25] and dominant col-
onisation
in
early
pregnancy
is
associated
with
protection against preterm birth in those women at
high risk [25]. Our data indicate that L. crispatus may
also provide protection against subsequent develop-
ment of EONS.
Although our study size is limited by the practicalities
and costs associated with prospectively recruiting large
numbers of women subsequently experiencing PPROM,
it represents a unique assessment of vaginal microbiota
prior to rupture of fetal membranes and is the largest
study of the vaginal microbiota in the context of
PPROM to date. Given the observational nature of the
study, it was not possible, in the context of UK National
Health Service care, to longitudinally sample a cohort of
women following PPROM who did not receive erythro-
mycin as part of treatment guidelines issued by the
WHO, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE), the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynae-
cologists and the recruiting hospital. Therefore, it is dif-
ficult to separate the potential temporal impact of
membrane rupture on shaping vaginal community struc-
ture from the pharmacological effect of erythromycin.
Amniotic fluid is highly alkaline with a pH of 7.1–7.3
and contains antimicrobial peptides [86] that may ac-
count for the reduction in bacterial load following rup-
ture observed in our study, prior to erythromycin
treatment. However, even if erythromycin is not the pri-
mary driver of dysbiosis, our data show that it fails to
improve the composition of the vaginal microbiome by
eradicating potential pathogens or reducing overall bac-
terial load and is detrimental for individuals with a
Lactobacillus spp. dominated microbiome.
Conclusions
Our data show that the composition of the vaginal
microbiome is a risk factor for subsequent PPROM and
is associated with adverse short-term maternal and neo-
natal outcomes. Erythromycin prophylaxis promotes
Lactobacillus spp. depletion and increased the bacterial
diversity of the microbiota, which correlates with in-
creased prevalence of chorioamnionitis, funisitis and
EONS. There is an urgent need to review the continued
use of prophylactic erythromycin in the context of
PPROM and to develop alternative treatment strategies,
such as patient-specific therapy, selective antibiotics or
different routes of administration, to resolve the vaginal
dysbiosis associated with PPROM and improve maternal
and neonatal outcomes.
