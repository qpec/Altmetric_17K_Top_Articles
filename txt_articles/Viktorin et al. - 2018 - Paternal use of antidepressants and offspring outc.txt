AbstrAct
Objective
To examine the association between paternal 
antidepressant use at conception and offspring 
preterm birth, malformations, autism spectrum 
disorder, and intellectual disability.
Design
Observational prospective cohort study with 
regression methods, and negative control comparison.
setting
Sweden nationwide.
ParticiPants
170 508 children conceived from 29 July 2005 and 
born in 2006-07, followed up to 2014 at age 8-9 
years. This cohort included 3983 children born 
to fathers receiving antidepressant treatment 
during the conception period (that is, from four 
weeks before conception to four weeks after), a 
control group of 164 492 children not exposed 
to paternal antidepressant use, and a negative 
control comparison group of 2033 children born 
to fathers who did not use antidepressants during 
the conception period but began antidepressant 
treatment later during the pregnancy period (that is, 
from four weeks after conception to childbirth).
Main OutcOMe Measure
Offspring preterm birth, malformation diagnosed at 
birth, diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, and 
diagnosis of intellectual disability.
results
Paternal antidepressant use during conception 
was not associated with preterm birth (adjusted 
odds ratio 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.79 to 
1.04)) or malformations (1.06 (0.90 to 1.26)) using 
logistic regression, compared with offspring born 
to unexposed fathers. No association was seen 
between antidepressant use during conception and 
autism (adjusted hazard ratio 1.13 (0.84 to 1.53)) 
or intellectual disability (0.82 (0.51 to 1.31)) using 
Cox regression. In children whose fathers initiated 
antidepressant treatment during pregnancy, results 
were similar for all outcomes apart from intellectual 
disability, which had an increased adjusted hazard 
ratio (1.66 (1.06 to 2.59)). Compared with the 2033 
children whose fathers initiated antidepressant 
treatment during pregnancy, the 3983 children 
exposed to paternal use of antidepressants at 
conception had no differences in preterm birth, 
malformation, and autism, but a reduced risk of 
intellectual disability (adjusted hazard ratio 0.49 
(0.26 to 0.93)).
cOnclusiOn
Paternal intake of antidepressants during the period 
around conception is safe with respect to the risk 
of the four major adverse outcomes in offspring—
preterm birth, malformation, autism, or intellectual 
disability.
Introduction
The health of the developing fetus and newborn child 
is of utmost importance to expecting parents, health-
care providers, and society at large, with preconcep-
tion and pregnancy health efforts traditionally centred 
on the mothers. Substantial literature exists on various 
maternal characteristics during pregnancy (includ-
ing advanced age,1 2 vitamin supplementation,3 and 
exposure to drug treatment4-13), maternal pregnancy 
complications,14 15 offspring preterm birth,7 10 malfor-
mations,16 and neuropsychiatric disorders,1-9 among 
others. Depression is currently the leading cause of 
disability worldwide according to the World Health 
Organization,17 with ensuing high rates of antide-
pressant prescriptions.18 The effects of maternal anti-
depressant treatment during pregnancy on short and 
long term outcomes in offspring has been extensively 
investigated.4-16 By contrast, only limited attention has 
been given to paternal antidepressant use through po-
tential effects on sperm.19-21
The paternal contribution to the embryo is nuclear 
DNA, which can increase the risk of adverse offspring 
outcomes from inherited genes, de novo mutations, 
and epigenetic changes,22 directly or indirectly 
through the placenta, which is derived from fetal 
cells. In vitro research has shown spermicidal action 
of varying degrees after antidepressant exposure.23 
Other previous studies have assessed sperm quality as 
a result of antidepressant toxicity, and have suggested

damage.25-28 Sperm DNA fragmentation seems to affect 
human embryos after implantation development,29 
and environmental genotoxic exposures have been 
shown to cause de novo mutations in mice.30 In people, 
increased rates of de novo mutations have been linked 
to autism.31 32 Moreover, advanced paternal age is 
strongly associated with increased rates of de novo 
mutations in offspring, and advanced paternal age has 
in turn been associated with autism and intellectual 
disability in offspring.2 33
Although the quality of evidence related to the 
antidepressant effects on sperm is weak and is based 
on small study samples and on case reports, there is 
growing but limited interest in the effects of paternal 
drug exposure before conception on birth outcomes. 
Researchers have associated paternal exposure to 
antidepressants before conception with a modest 
increase in risk of preterm birth,20 whereas others 
have observed a mildly increased risk of autism in a 
study of paternal antidepressant treatment during 
conception.21 Furthermore, paternal antidepressant 
treatment at the time of pregnancy has been used as a 
negative control in studies of maternal treatment.7
A better understanding of potential adverse effects 
of paternal antidepressant treatment is relevant to 
public health policy, clinical care, family planning, 
and future research. Therefore, we investigated the 
effects of paternal antidepressant treatment during 
conception on preterm birth, birth malformation, 
autism, and intellectual disability, using data from a 
Swedish nationwide cohort.
Methods
Population
Our study cohort consisted of all liveborn children with 
complete information on gestational age at birth and 
on the identity of both parents, conceived between 29 
July 2005 and 31 December 2007 as identified in the 
Swedish Medical Birth Register. The register includes 
99% of all births nationwide since 1973, and provides 
information on gestational age at birth that was used 
to calculate the date of conception.34 In Sweden, 95% 
of pregnant women receive early second trimester 
ultrasonography, which provides the gestational age of 
the fetus with an error margin of seven days.35 Fathers 
were identified by use of the Multi-Generation Register 
provided by Statistics Sweden, which separates 
biological and adoptive parents and excludes parents 
who do not pass on any information (eg, lack of birth 
date, or extreme age at birth of the child).36 37 The study 
was approved by the regional ethics committee in 
Stockholm, Sweden (2012/1548/31-1). No individual 
level consent was required, and all data used were 
anonymised.
antidepressant exposure
The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register holds information 
on all dispensed prescription drugs in Sweden since 
1 July 2005, along with the drug name, number of 
pills per prescription, and an anatomical therapeutic 
chemical classification system (ATC) code.38 39 We 
identified dispensations of all psychotropic drugs 
given to both parents (eTables 1 and 2) and calculated 
treatment periods assuming either one pill was 
consumed per day for antidepressants or according to 
the defined daily dose (DDD) provided by WHO for all 
other psychotropic drugs. Figure 1 describes periods 
used to classify three mutually exclusive exposure 
groups:
•  
Exposure to antidepressants during conception, 
including offspring born to fathers with at least 
one dispensation of an antidepressant drug from 
four weeks before conception to four weeks after 
(period A in fig 1). Consequently, this group would 
include offspring born to fathers who started a 
new antidepressant treatment during this eight 
week period, and those with fathers with a stable 
long term treatment regimen overlapping concep-
tion, who might have started treatment before the 
eight week conception period. Moreover, fathers 
identified as using antidepressants during this 
period were likely to have continued antidepres-
sant treatment after the conception, overlapping 
pregnancy and possibly beyond.
•  
Exposure to antidepressants initiated during 
pregnancy only, including offspring born to 
fathers not in group 1—that is, fathers who did 
not receive antidepressant treatment during the 
conception period (A in fig 1) but beginning from 
four weeks after conception to childbirth (B in fig 
1). Consequently, this group would only include 
fathers who started a new antidepressant treatment 
during pregnancy, because fathers on a stable 
long term treatment regimen were likely to have 
overlapped the eight week conception period.
•  
No exposure to antidepressants, including children 
of fathers not in the first two groups, who had no 
antidepressant drug dispensed during conception 
or pregnancy.
We chose the eight week conception window to 
account for the final 10 day postmeiotic, late stage

of spermatogenesis, during which DNA repair 
cannot occur,40 and to account for the margin of 
error of ultrasound dating.35 Effects of potential 
misclassification due to strict definition of the exposure 
periods were examined in sensitivity analyses.
Outcomes
We defined preterm births as having a gestational 
age of less than 37 weeks. Malformation at birth was 
identified in the Medical Birth Register (eTable 3), 
based on a binary variable including any malformation 
according to ICD-10 (international classification of 
diseases, 10th revision) codes Q00-99.34 Clinically 
ascertained ICD-10 diagnoses of autism spectrum 
disorder and intellectual disability were identified 
from birth to 31 December 2014 in the Swedish 
National Patient Register,41 42 which includes dates of 
all inpatient psychiatric admissions since 1973 and all 
outpatient specialist visits since 2001 (eTable 3).41
covariates
In the current cohort, consistent with previous stud-
ies,4 5 9 43 the prevalence of childhood psychiatric disor-
ders increased over time (eFigure 1). Therefore, to ad-
just for potential confounding due to temporal trends, 
we included the offspring birth date, coded as number 
of days from 1 January 2005. Maternal and paternal 
age are well established risk factors for childhood 
neuropsychiatric disorders,2 and we categorised these 
ages at childbirth as 20, 20-29, 30-39, and 40 years 
or above.1 Maternal use of antidepressants during 
pregnancy with psychotropic treatment has previous-
ly been associated with many maternal and offspring 
related outcomes, including pre-eclampsia,15 postpar-
tum haemorrhage,14 neuropsychiatric disorders,4-13 
preterm birth,7 10 and malformations16; this was in-
cluded as a binary variable, defined as a dispensation 
overlapping the pregnancy period. 
Genomic studies have identified genetic correlations 
between many psychiatric disorders,44 45 as well as 
between psychiatric disorders and somatic disorders 
and offspring birth characteristics.45 Therefore, 
maternal and paternal psychiatric history of 10 
separate psychiatric disorder categories (eTable 3) 
were included, ascertained on the basis of having at 
least one diagnosis before childbirth in the Swedish 
National Patient Register. The register includes all 
Swedish inpatient psychiatric admissions since 1973 
and all outpatient specialist admissions since 2001, 
and provides admission dates along with diagnosis 
codes in accordance with ICD.41 Socioeconomic status 
was defined by paternal and maternal education levels 
(duration of education; eTable 4).
statistical analysis
We estimated odds ratios of preterm birth and 
malformations and associated Wald type two sided 
95% confidence intervals by logistic regression. For 
autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, 
we calculated hazard ratios and associated Wald 
type two sided 95% confidence intervals from Cox 
regression models, which allow for detailed adjustment 
for censoring affecting the length of follow-up of each 
child.46 Days since birth was used as the underlying 
time scale. Each child was followed from birth until a 
diagnosis of the outcome, death, or end of follow-up 
at 31 December 2014, whichever event occurred first.
All estimates were calculated by models with 
increasing 
complexity, 
beginning 
with 
models 
without adjustment for covariates (model 1), followed 
by models adjusting for all included potentially 
confounding covariates (model 2). We calculated 
the estimates in offspring born to fathers receiving 
antidepressant treatment during the conception 
period (A in fig 1) and in offspring born to fathers 
initiating treatment beginning in the pregnancy period 
(B in fig 1), compared with offspring of fathers not 
receiving treatment during conception or pregnancy. 
Estimates were then calculated in offspring born to 
fathers receiving antidepressant treatment during the 
conception period, compared with offspring of fathers 
initiating treatment in the pregnancy period.
To test the statistical hypothesis of no adverse 
outcomes in offspring born to fathers receiving 
antidepressant treatment, the statistical significance 
was set at the nominal two sided 5% level. We did 
not perform any adjustment due to multiplicity of 
statistical tests. Data management was performed 
by SAS 9.4, and STATA/IC 14 was used for logistic 
regression (command logistic) and Cox regression 
(command stcox).
sensitivity analyses
To rule out associations in offspring outcome 
subgroups, we performed additional analyses in 
children with mild to moderate intellectual disability, 
and in those with the most severe type of autism, 
autistic disorder. The exposure periods were selected 
prioritising the exposure during conception, which 
could cause potential misclassification. For example, 
a father who received antidepressant treatment in the 
two years before conception but who stopped treatment 
five weeks before conception would be classified as a 
non-user, and a father not receiving treatment until 
three weeks after conception would be classified as 
being exposed to antidepressants during conception. 
To examine effects of such potential misclassifications, 
we analysed more extensive and more restrictive 
exposure periods. 
To rule out risks attributed to specific types of 
antidepressant drugs, we performed additional 
analyses for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor 
(SSRI) antidepressants of any type, and for each of 
the four most common SSRI antidepressants. We 
examined the role of polypharmacy by excluding 
offspring exposed to non-antidepressant psychotropic 
drugs. Because data for siblings from the same parents 
could introduce correlations in the data that are not 
automatically taken into account when calculating 
the standard errors and confidence intervals, we 
performed sensitivity analyses taking into account 
such correlations through bootstrap techniques.47

To ascertain the influences of maternal psychiatric 
disorders and maternal psychotropic medication on our 
results, we performed sensitivity analyses by excluding 
offspring born to mothers receiving psychotropic 
treatment during pregnancy. We investigated potential 
sex specificity of associations by performing subgroup 
analyses by offspring sex. The proportional hazards 
assumption for the Cox regression models was 
examined by use of Schoenfeld residuals.48
Because paternal adherence to treatment was not 
known, we investigated the proportion of fathers with 
an antidepressant treatment dispensation overlapping 
the conception period who did not have a secondary 
dispensation. Antidepressants are commonly used 
over longer periods, so one isolated dispensation could 
indicate that the treatment had not been initiated 
or was stopped before conception. To examine the 
effect of single dispensations, we separately analysed 
fathers with a continuous treatment regimen of 
antidepressants by including only fathers with at 
least one additional dispensation within six months. 
Lastly, fathers exposed to antidepressants only after 
conception were likely to have incident depression 
or worse to trigger a prescription (that is, new users), 
whereas those already receiving antidepressant 
treatment at conception were more likely to be stable 
(stable users). The role of this potential difference 
in new and stable users was examined in analyses 
confined to users receiving no antidepressant treatment 
from seven to three months before conception (that is, 
only newly initiated prescriptions).
Missing values
Data from 171 879 livebirths of children conceived 
from 29 July 2005 and born up to 31 December 2007 
were provided by the Swedish National Board of 
Health and Welfare. Paternity information was missing 
for 1314 (0.76%) children (eTable 5), and gestational 
age at birth was missing for an additional 57 children; 
in total, 1371 (0.80%) children did not have complete 
data and were excluded from the statistical analyses.
Patient involvement
As mandated by the ethical permission, no attempts 
were made to contact any cohort members for any 
aspect of this record linkage study. As such, cohort 
members were not involved in setting the research 
question or the outcome measures, nor were they 
involved in developing plans for the design or 
implementation of the study. No patients were asked to 
advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There 
are no plans to directly disseminate the results of the 
research to cohort members, but dissemination to the 
general public and relevant patient groups will be 
undertaken by using presentations and social media.
results
Table 1 presents general descriptive data for the study 
cohort, and table 2 presents descriptive data for the 
parents diagnosed as having psychiatric disorders 
before childbirth. Of 170 508 children conceived 
from 29 July 2005 and born up to 31 December 2007, 
3983 (2.3%) were born to fathers who had dispensed 
an antidepressant drug within a treatment period 
overlapping during the conception period, 2033 
(1.2%) were born to fathers without a dispensation 
overlapping conception but with a dispensation 
during pregnancy, and 164 492 (96.5%) were born to 
fathers without a dispensation during conception or 
pregnancy. Records showed 10 689 children (6.3%) 
born preterm, 6502 (3.8%) with birth malformations, 
1556 (0.9%) with autism, and 832 (0.5%) with 
intellectual disability diagnosed between birth and 31 
December 2014 when the children were 8-9 years old.
antidepressant exposure and adverse outcomes
In the first comparison, 3983 children born to fathers 
receiving antidepressant drug treatment during the con-
ception period were compared with 164 492 unexposed 
children. In analyses without covariate adjustment 
(model 1), antidepressant exposure during conception 
was only associated with an increased risk of autism 
(hazard ratio 1.39 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 
1.84)). After covariate adjustment (model 2), no asso-
ciation was observed between antidepressant exposure 
during conception and any of the outcomes (fig 2).
In the second comparison, 2033 children born to 
fathers with antidepressant drug treatment beginning 
during the pregnancy period only were compared with 
164 492 unexposed children. In analyses without co-
variate adjustment (model 1), antidepressant exposure 
after conception and during pregnancy was associat-
ed with an increased risk of autism (hazard ratio 1.69 
(95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.41)) and intellectu-
al  
disability (2.14 (1.39 to 3.30); fig 2). After covariate 
adjustment (model 2), antidepressant exposure after 
conception and during pregnancy was only associated 
with an increased risk of intellectual disability (adjusted 
hazard ratio 1.66 (1.06 to 2.59); fig 2).
In the third comparison, 3983 children born to 
fathers receiving antidepressant drug treatment 
during the conception period were compared with 
2033 children born to fathers who initiated treatment 
during the pregnancy period only. In analyses without 
covariate adjustment (model 1), antidepressant 
exposure during conception was associated with 
a decreased risk of intellectual disability (hazard 
ratio 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.27 to 0.91)), 
with comparable results remaining after covariate 
adjustment (model 2; fig 3).
sensitivity analyses
Supplemental analyses revealed results that did not 
deviate quantitatively or qualitatively from the main 
findings in the conception exposure group in figure 2. 
These sensitivity analyses looked at:
•  
Autistic 
disorder 
and 
mild 
and 
moderate 
intellectual disability (eFigure 2) 
•  
Extended conception periods (eFigures 3-6)

Principal findings
In this Swedish population based study of 170 508 
children born in 2006-07 and followed up to the 
end of 2014, we investigated the effects of paternal 
antidepressant treatment during conception on 
offspring 
preterm 
birth, 
malformation, 
autism, 
and intellectual disability. We found that children 
born to fathers receiving antidepressant treatment 
during conception did not seem to be at a higher 
risk of these adverse outcomes, although there was 
evidence of confounding. This finding was consistent 
in all sensitivity analyses conducted, and was further 
supported by comparison with the group of children 
born to fathers who did not receive antidepressant 
treatment during conception but who initiated 
treatment during pregnancy. This control comparison 
group included children who were unlikely to have 
been conceived from sperm exposed to antidepressant 
treatment but who were born to fathers who might 
have shared similar underlying characteristics with 
fathers receiving antidepressant treatment during 
conception. We saw a statistically significant reduction 
in risk of intellectual disability in children born to 
fathers receiving antidepressant treatment during 
conception, compared with those born to fathers who 
initiated treatment later during pregnancy.

strengths and limitations
As a strength, the study included a large, prospective 
population based cohort of children born during a 
specific time period, with recent and close to complete 
coverage of data (0.8% missing data), from a healthcare 
system with equal access irrespective of ethnicity or 
geographical location. The independent collection of 
exposure and outcome data reduced ascertainment 
bias, and identification of parental diagnoses of 
psychiatric disorders within several categories allowed 
a detailed adjustment of psychiatric comorbidity, 
which is very common. This setting should allow 
generalisability of the findings beyond the specific 
population study, and limit the risk of bias by selection 
or through temporal trends.
However, we cannot rule potential variation of the 
generalisability of our results in populations that 
differ from the Swedish population—for example, with 
respect to variation in cultural diversity and genetic 
makeup. The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register began 
on 1 July 2005; if a father had a dispensation of an 
antidepressant drug just before this date, it would 
either be undetected if only one dispensation was 
made, or be defined as treatment that began during 
pregnancy if there was a follow-up dispensation. 
Sensitivity analyses revealed that some children 
could have been misclassified, but the effect of the 
misclassification did not alter the finding that paternal 
antidepressant treatment during conception was 
not statistically significantly associated with any of 
the adverse outcomes (eFigures 3-5). Furthermore, 
adherence to dispensed treatment was not known. 
However, among fathers who received antidepressant 
treatment during the conception period, 3450 (86.6%) 
had an additional dispensation within six months, 
suggesting that most were on continuous treatment. 
Analyses limited to these 3450 fathers revealed results 
that did not deviate significantly from the main results 
(eFigure 15). 
Additionally, malformation data were obtained 
from the Swedish Medical Birth Register as a binary 
variable that includes all malformations according 
to ICD-10 diagnosis codes of Q00-99, so we were not 
able to analyse specific malformations. Moreover, 
our study was limited to livebirths, and thus, any 
potential effects of paternal antidepressants on fetal 
survival could not be studied. Although the Swedish 
Medical Birth Register have stillbirth data, they are 
limited to stillbirths that occur during the planned 
delivery. Spontaneous abortions, planned abortions, 
and stillbirths outside the planned delivery are not 
captured, which makes the information difficult to 
interpret. 
We also did not have access to psychiatric diagnoses 
from primary care, which could have contributed to 
the relatively low number of psychiatric diagnoses

observed 
in 
fathers 
prescribed 
antidepressant 
treatment. Lack of primary care diagnoses is, however, 
less likely to affect detection of children with autism 
or intellectual disability, because they are usually 
referred to a specialist and identified in the Swedish 
National Patient Register. Lastly, we cannot rule out 
residual confounding by covariates not included in the 
analysis—for example, genetics, psychiatric disorder 
severity, smoking, alcohol consumption, paternal 
use of non-antidepressant drugs including over-the-
counter drugs, maternal folic acid use, emigration, or 
parental somatic diseases. Unanalysed confounders 
could be observed from the point estimates that 
increase and decrease the risk in the analysis. But 
despite potential residual confounding, the confidence 
intervals overlapped across all analyses (fig 2).
comparison with other studies
In the present study, autism was diagnosed in 0.9% of 
children and intellectual disability in 0.5% of children 
during the follow-up period of the first seven to eight 
years after birth, which is similar to the prevalence 
of 0.6% for both autism and intellectual disability in 
children aged 3-10 years in a recent American survey49 
and prevalence estimates from register based sources 
in other Scandinavian cohorts.50 Similar to a previous 
study by Yang and colleagues,21 we observed an 
association between paternal antidepressant treatment 
during conception and autism when potential 
confounders were not adjusted for, and an attenuation 
of the association when confounders were adjusted 
for. But contrary to the Yang study, we did not observe 
any remaining risk after adjusting for confounders, 
which might relate to our inclusion of more detailed 
information about the history of parental psychiatric 
disorders. This interpretation was further supported 
by our additional comparison with a negative control 
group consisting of children unlikely to be exposed to 
antidepressants during conception but born to fathers 
who carried similar characteristics associated with the 
need for antidepressant treatment.
Moreover, in the current study, preterm birth was 
observed in 6.3% of children, while malformations 
according to ICD-10 codes Q00-Q99 were seen in 3.8% 
of children. These figures are comparable to those of a 
study by Engeland and colleagues, who used data from 
the Medical Birth Registry of Norway; the Norwegian 
register uses data collection methods similar to those 
used by the Swedish Medical Birth Register in our 
study.20 Similar to the Engeland study, we observed 
no association between paternal antidepressant use 
during conception and offspring malformations. 
However, although Engeland and colleagues observed 
a modest increase in risk of preterm birth (adjusted 
odds ratio 1.3 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.5)) in 
association with fathers receiving SSRI antidepressant 
treatment during conception, we did not observe an 
increased risk of preterm birth in association with 
paternal antidepressant treatment overall (fig 2) 
or with SSRI antidepressant treatment specifically 
(eFigure 7).

analysis of findings from the present study
The consistency of our results in the main analysis 
and sensitivity analyses suggest that paternal 
antidepressant treatment during conception is not 
causally related to increased risks of preterm birth, 
malformations, autism, or intellectual disability in 
offspring. Instead, our results suggest other factors 
underlying and confounding the associations between 
fathers who are treated with antidepressants at 
conception and the risks of autism and intellectual 
disability in their offspring. This interpretation is 
supported by the elevated risks in our crude unadjusted 
analyses (model 1 in fig 2), which was attenuated by 
the adjustment for potentially confounding factors. 
This interpretation is further supported by results 
from the analyses of children in the negative control 
group, who were born to fathers who initiated antide-
pressant treatment during pregnancy (that is, unlikely 
to have been exposed to antidepressants at conception 
but exposed to paternal characteristics similar to those 
born to fathers receiving antidepressant treatment dur-
ing conception). The analyses in the negative control 
group showed similar and even stronger associations 
in the crude analyses, and a small but statistically sig-
nificant increased risk of intellectual disability even 
after adjustment for confounding factors. The elevat-
ed risk of intellectual disability was also seen in direct 
comparison between children born to fathers receiv-
ing antidepressant treatment during conception and 
the negative control group, which further support the 
 
importance of the underlying characteristics and not 
the treatment for the association. These underlying 
characteristics could be related to dissimilarities be-
tween the two exposure groups, for example, relating 
to the disorder stability. 
Antidepressants are used over longer periods of 
time, and when defining the two mutually exclusive 
exposure groups, we prioritised the conception 
period. Therefore, this conception window would 
include fathers who might just have started their 
antidepressant treatment, as well as the large number 
of fathers receiving stable continuous treatment at 
any given time. By contrast, owing to the mutually 
exclusive design, fathers who began treatment during 
pregnancy could not have used antidepressants 
during conception, and will therefore represent 
fathers who had experienced an onset or worsening 
of the underlying disorder that needed the treatment 
initiation. The observed association between paternal 
antidepressant treatment beginning during pregnancy 
and offspring intellectual disability could indicate 
that having a psychiatric disorder—either through the 
symptoms or through factors underlying the disorder 
at this stage of life (eg, genetic susceptibility or life 
situation)—could constitute a risk factor for offspring 
autism and intellectual disability. 
Furthermore, although our results suggest that 
antidepressants are not causally associated with the 
studied outcomes, paternal antidepressant treatment 
could be a causal factor for other outcomes. And in 
situations where paternal antidepressant treatment 
is not thought to be a causal factor, information 
about paternal treatment could still be an important 
marker for the underlying factors related to raised 
risks of autism and intellectual disability in offspring, 
as shown in our results. Consequently, paternal 
treatment with antidepressants around the time of 
conception and pregnancy might be a useful variable 
in future studies—for example, to capture the onset 
or worsening of underlying psychiatric illness. 
Furthermore, our results do not contradict the use 
of paternal antidepressant treatment as a negative 
control group when studying the effects of maternal

antidepressant treatment, given that the outcomes 
studied are preterm birth, malformations of any kind, 
autism, and intellectual disability.
clinical implications
Depressive illness is a growing health problem 
worldwide, 
and 
antidepressant 
treatment 
is 
increasingly prescribed. At the same time, attention to 
paternal factors has increased in relation to fetal and 
offspring health, but research on potential adverse 
effects on offspring due to paternal antidepressant 
treatment is limited. Our results suggest that 
antidepressant use during conception does not 
increase the risks of preterm birth, malformations, 
autism, or intellectual disability in offspring. Instead, 
we observed an increased risk of intellectual disability 
in children born to fathers who were not treated 
with antidepressants at the time of conception, but 
who required antidepressant treatment later during 
pregnancy.
These results could provide important information 
to doctors and patients regarding the risks of harming 
offspring through antidepressant treatment during 
conception. The information could help families 
planning to have children and who are concerned 
about potential risks of paternal treatment on sperm. 
The results might also be useful to fathers who received 
antidepressant treatment during the conception of a 
child who had a preterm birth, malformation, autism, 
or intellectual disability, and who might be blaming 
themselves unnecessarily. However, research on this 
topic is limited, and although the present study did not 
find a causal link between the studied outcomes and 
antidepressant treatment, replication of the results is 
imperative. Furthermore, the results reflect effects on 
a group level, and might not be generalisable to all 
individuals and populations.
