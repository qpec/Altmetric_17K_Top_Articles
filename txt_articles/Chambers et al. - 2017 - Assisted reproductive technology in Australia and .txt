The known Almost 70 000 assisted reproductive technology
(ART) cycles are performed each year in Australia and New
Zealand. Success rates are generally reported per individual
cycle attempt, rather than from the overall perspective of a
course of ART treatment.
The new This is the first study to report cumulative success
rates based on complete ovarian stimulation cycles for women
undergoing ART in Australia and New Zealand, and also
provides estimates that take into account women who
discontinued treatment.
The implications These estimates can be used when
counselling women about their likelihood of having a baby
using ART treatment, and to inform public policy.
I
nfertility is experienced by about one in six couples, causing
significant personal anguish to millions around the world.1,2
Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) such as in vitro
fertilisation (IVF) have revolutionised the treatment of infertility.
It is estimated that more than 1.8 million ART cycles were
undertaken worldwide in 2010, and that more than 6 million
children have been conceived using these technologies over the
past three decades.3 The Australian and New Zealand Assisted
Reproductive Database (ANZARD) recorded 33 750 women
having 67 707 ART cycles during 2014, resulting in the births of
12 875 babies; this was one in 25 children born in Australia, and
1 in 12 children to women over 35.4
A fresh ART treatment cycle typically involves ovarian stimulation
and the retrieval of several mature oocytes (eggs) for fertilisation.
The resulting embryos are cultured in vitro for 2e6 days before one
or, occasionally, two embryos are transferred to the woman’s
uterus. Unused embryos are cryopreserved for potential transfer in
subsequent frozen/thaw cycles.
The success rate of ARTs is generally reported as the number of
clinical pregnancies or live births per single fresh or frozen/thaw
cycle.4-6 However, cryopreservation has become increasingly cen-
tral to clinical practice over the past decade, calling into question the
relevance of this measure of success. The shift to frozen/thaw cycles
has been largely driven by the move to single embryo transfers — to
minimise the health risks associated with multiple gestation
pregnancies — and by strategies that delay embryo transfer, to
improve synchronicity between the endometrium and embryo and
toaccommodatepre-implantationgenetictesting.Further,evidence
that fetal wellbeing is not harmed by embryo cryopreservation, and
higher ART success rates per embryo transfer (particularly with
frozen/thaw embryos), have elevated the importance of the cryo-
preservation program.7-9 This shift in practice means that, when
informing patients about the chances of ART success, a more
meaningful measure would be based on “complete cycles”,
encompassing the outcomes from all fresh and frozen/thaw
embryo transfers following one ovarian stimulation10,11 (Box 1).
Our objective was to report the cumulative live birth rate (CLBRs)
for all complete ART cycles a woman might undergo, with a
minimum 2-year period follow-up from the commencement of her
first cycle; that is, to determine the chance of a woman having her
first live birth after repeated ART treatment cycles.

Abstract
Objectives: To estimate cumulative live birth rates (CLBRs)
following repeated assisted reproductive technology (ART)
ovarian stimulation cycles, including all fresh and frozen/thaw
embryo transfers (complete cycles).
Design, setting and participants: Prospective follow-up of
56 652 women commencing ART in Australian and New
Zealand during 2009e2012, and followed until 2014 or the first
treatment-dependent live birth.
Main outcome measures: CLBRs and cycle-specific live birth
rates were calculated for up to eight cycles, stratified by the age
of the women (< 30, 30e34, 35e39, 40e44, > 44 years).
Conservative CLBRs assumed that women discontinuing
treatment had no chance of achieving a live birth if had they
continued treatment; optimal CLBRs assumed that they would
have had the same chance as women who continued treatment.
Results: The overall CLBR was 32.7% (95% CI, 32.2e33.1%) in
the first cycle, rising by the eighth cycle to 54.3% (95% CI,
53.9e54.7%) (conservative) and 77.2% (95% CI, 76.5e77.9%)
(optimal). The CLBR decreased with age and number of
complete cycles. For women who commenced ART treatment
before 30 years of age, the CLBR for the first complete cycle was
43.7% (95% CI, 42.6e44.7%), rising to 69.2% (95% CI,
68.2e70.1%) (conservative) and 92.8% (95% CI, 91.6e94.0)
(optimal) for the seventh cycle. For women aged 40e44 years,
the CLBR was 10.7% (95% CI, 10.1e11.3%) for the first complete
cycle, rising to 21.0% (95% CI, 20.2e21.8%) (conservative) and
37.9% (95% CI, 35.9e39.9%) (optimal) for the eighth cycle.
Conclusion: CLBRs based on complete cycles are meaningful
estimates of ART success, reflecting contemporary clinical
practice and encouraging safe practice. These estimates can be
used when counselling patients and to inform public policy on
ART treatment.

 the 56 652 women in Australia and New Zealand commencing
autologous ART (with their own oocytes) during 2009e2012. These
data allowed 2e6 years’ follow-up of each woman.
ANZARD, managed by the National Epidemiology and Perinatal
Statistics Unit of the University of New South Wales, collects
information on all ART treatment cycles undertaken in the 90
fertility clinics in Australia and New Zealand. All fertility clinics
report ART treatment information to ANZARD as part of their
licensing requirements, so that full registration of ART cycles is
assumed. Records of all frozen/thaw transfers were linked to the
associated episode of ovarian stimulation for each woman. This
allowed each complete treatment cycle to be identified, and the
reproductive outcome to be measured. Cycles were excluded for
women who used donated oocytes or embryos, or surrogacy
arrangements, and when the purpose of treatment was the long
term storage of oocytes or embryos (eg, onco-fertility preservation).
The follow-up period was chosen to allow sufficient time to achieve
at least one live birth and a sufficient number of complete cycles for
reliable estimates of live birth rates. Live birth was defined as the
birth of at least one infant of at least 20 weeks’ gestation or a
minimum 400 g birth weight; ie, the birth of twins or triplets was
counted as one live birth. CLBRs were reported according to age
group at the commencement of treatment (under 30 years, 30e34
years, 35e39 years, 40e44 years, 45 years or older).
Statistical analysis
Two CLBRs were calculated, according to differing assumptions
about the prognosis of women who discontinued ART treatment.
The conservative CLBR assumed that women who discontinued
treatment would not have achieved a live birth if they had
continued; it was calculated for each complete cycle as the pro-
portion of women who commenced ART treatment during
2009e2012 who had achieved a live birth. The 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated from standard errors of the binomial
distribution. Women were excluded from analysis once they had
achieved their first live birth. Women were considered to have
discontinued ART treatment if they did not have a treatment-
dependent live birth and did not return for further ART treat-
ment before 31 December 2014. To ensure reliable estimates, the
CLBR was calculated for a complete cycle only when at least 50
women had commenced the cycle.
The optimal CLBR assumed that women who dis-
continued treatment would have had the same chance
of a live birth with continued ART as those who did
continue; it was estimated (with 95% CIs) by the
KaplaneMeier method.
Women discontinue ART treatment for a number of
reasons, but mainly because of the psychological and
physical demands of treatment, and its costs.12 Reason
for discontinuation is not available in ART registry data,
so the conservative and optimal CLBRs provide a range
within which the actual CLBR would be expected to fall.
To further pursue this question, we performed a sensi-
tivity analysis predicated on varying the assumptions
about the probability of future treatment success in
women who had discontinued treatment. A recent sys-
tematic review found that 38% (95% CI, 24e54%) of
women who discontinued treatment after a failed ART
cycle had been advised to end treatment (doctor
censoring).12 We therefore assumed that 38% could
conservatively be expected to have a zero chance of a
live birth with their own eggs, and that 62% of women
who discontinued treatment without a live birth could be expected
to have had the same chance of a live birth as women who
continued with treatment (online Appendix 1).
Cycle-specific live birth rates were calculated as the number of live
births resulting from a cycle divided by the number of women who
commenced that cycle. Analyses were conducted in Stata 14
(StataCorp).
Ethics approval
This study was approved by the University of New South Wales
Human Research Ethics Advisory Panel (reference, GHC16983).
Results
Descriptive statistics
The characteristics of the 56 652 women who commenced ART
treatment during 2009e2012 and of the 120 930 complete treat-
ment cycles they underwent by 2014 are summarised in Box 2 and
online Appendix 2. The median age of women commencing
treatment was 35 years (interquartile range [IQR], 31e39 years),
30% presented with infertility caused by female factors, 37% with
infertility caused by male or a combination of male and female
factors; for 25% of women the cause of infertility was unexplained.
Women underwent an average of 2.1 complete cycles, and 3.0
single fresh or frozen/thaw cycles. The median number of oocytes
retrieved per fresh stimulated cycle was eight (IQR, 4e12), and
73% of embryo transfer procedures transferred a single embryo. Of
the women who commenced treatment, 54.5% achieved at least
one live birth; 25.5% of complete cycles resulted in a live birth. The
live birth rate per embryo transfer cycle was 22.9% for fresh
embryo transfers.
Cycle-specific live birth rates
The live birth rate (first live birth) for the first complete cycle was
32.7% (95% CI, 32.2e33.1%) (Box 3). The cycle-specific live birth
rate decreased with increasing maternal age and with increasing
cycle number. The highest rates were for the first complete cycle
undertaken by women who commenced treatment before the age
of 35 (43.7% [95% CI, 42.3e45.1%] for women under 30;
43.4% [95% CI, 42.4e44.4%] for women aged 30e34 years).

 The lowest live birth rates for the first complete cycle were for
women aged 40e44 (10.7%; 95% CI, 10.1e11.3%) and 45 or more
(1.4%; 95% CI, 0.8e2.8%) (online Appendix 3).
The discontinuation rates after each complete cycle for women who
commenced treatment before 45 years of age were similar for all
age groups (23e35% during the first six cycles). Discontinuation
rates forwomen who commenced treatment when 45 years orolder
were much higher, ranging from 49.1% after the first cycle to
35.2% after the fifth cycle (Box 3 and online Appendix 3).
Cumulative live birth rates
The conservative and optimal CLBRs for up to eight complete cy-
cles are presented in Box 3, Box 4, and online Appendix 3. Overall
(ie, for all ages), the CLBR was 32.7% (95% CI, 32.2e33.1%) for the
first complete cycle, rising to 54.3% (95% CI, 53.9e54.7%) (con-
servative) and 77.2% (95% CI, 76.5e77.9%) (optimal) for the eighth
cycle.
CLBRs declined with increasing maternal age. For women who
commenced ART treatment before 30 years of age, the CLBR for the
first complete cycle was 43.7% (95% CI, 42.6e44.7%), rising to
69.2% (95% CI, 68.2e70.1%) (conservative) and 92.8% (95% CI,
91.6e94.0%) (optimal) for the seventh cycle. For women aged
40e44 years when they commenced treatment, the CLBR was
10.7% (95% CI, 10.1e11.3%) for the first complete cycle, rising to
21.0% (95% CI, 20.2e21.8) (conservative) and 37.9% (95%
CI, 35.9e39.9%) (optimal) for the eighth cycle (Box 4, online
Appendix 3).
The sensitivity analysis found that when the CLBR was adjusted
for the proportion of women likely to discontinue ART treatment
because of doctor censoring, the CLBR after three complete cycles
was 55.2% (95% CI, 56.5e53.8%), closer to the optimal (58.8%) than
the conservative rate (49.9%). This finding was similar for all age
groups (online Appendix 1).
Discussion
This is the first report of CLBRs based on complete ART treatment
cycles derived from population-based Australian and New Zea-
land fertility clinic data. The perspective of a complete cycle, which
links all fresh and frozen/thaw embryo transfers to the associated
ovarian stimulation, allows cycle-specific and CLBRs to be calcu-
lated. The cycle-specific rates inform women about their chances of
their first live birth from one course of ovarian stimulation fol-
lowed by all embryo transfers. The CLBR informs women about
their chances of at least one live birth after a given number of
repeated ovarian stimulation cycles. For example, for women
commencing ART treatment when aged 30e34 years, the esti-
mated chance of a live birth lies between 64.5% (95% CI,
63.8e65.2%) and 73.6% (95% CI, 72.8e74.4%) after three complete
cycles, and the chance of a live birth during the third complete cycle
is 28.0% (95% CI, 26.3e29.8%).
ART success rates based on complete cycles are more meaningful
than single fresh or frozen/thaw cycle success rates because they
provide an overall perspective of a course of ART treatment.
Complete cycle CLBRs also account for the shift in routine clinical
practice to cryopreservation of embryos, and encourage single
embryo transfers by removing the emphasis on single cycle success
rates.
Although cycle-specific rates declined with successive cycles,
conservative and optimal CLBRs increased for most age groups for
up to seven or eight cycles. The exception was women who
commenced ART treatment at 45 years of age or later (655 women),
of whom only 12 had had a live birth after five complete cycles.
Two recent analyses of data from the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology

(HFEA)

database

Kingdom) have also calculated conservative and optimal complete
cycle CLBRs.13,14 We cannot directly compare our results with

 those of these studies because the UK data were older, one study
did not report age-specific rates,13 and the other applied different
age groupings.14 However, our all-age conservative and optimal
CLBRs were generally higher. For example, we calculated a CLBR
of 32.7% for the first complete cycle, compared with 28.5e29.5% in
the UK; after six complete cycles, the conservative CLBR was
53.9% in Australia and New Zealand, 43.9e46.8% in the UK. These
differences may relate to differences in the patient populations,
laboratory expertise, or clinical practice. However, as with other
studies of ART CLBRs,13-16 and because the KaplaneMeier method
includes only the first event of interest, CLBRs and cycle-specific
rates do not account for women who achieve more than one
live birth as the result of ART treatment, and are therefore
underestimates.
The conservative CLBR is pessimistic in that it assumes that
women who discontinue treatment without a live birth have no
future prospect of treatment success. Conversely, the optimal
CLBR is probably overly optimistic, as it assumes that women who
discontinued treatment had the same chance of a live birth with
continued treatment as those who did continue. The range between
the two provides a reasonable appraisal of the probability of
achieving at least one live birth from repeated ART treatment. Our
sensitivity analysis accounted for the likely proportion of women
who discontinued because the prognosis was poor (doctor
censoring), and consistently found that the prognosis-adjusted
CLBRs were closer to the optimal than the conservative estimate
(online Appendix 1).
A limitation of our study is that our estimates are based on popu-
lation estimates and do not account for individual prognostic
factors that affect a woman’s chance of ART success, including
duration of infertility, body mass index, previous childbearing,
and ovarian reserve.17 Whether ART treatment should be
commenced or continued should ultimately be a decision for the
fertility clinician and the patient, taking into account all medical
and non-medical factors.
CLBR estimates do not report the probability of a multiple birth.
However, given that ART multiple birth rates in Australia and
New Zealand are among the lowest in the world (fewer than 5% of
all ART births3,4), the safety of ART in the current funding envi-
ronment in Australia and New Zealand is reassuring. Almost all
ART treatment is eligible for partial re-imbursement by Medicare,
without limitations on the number of cycles or the woman’s age.
The cost of fresh stimulated ART cycles is estimated to be about
$10 000, of which $6000e7000 is reimbursed by Medicare.18
Several studies have found that the out-of-pocket cost of ART
treatment for patients influences the number of embryos trans-
ferred: higher out-of-pockets costs encourage multiple embryo
transfers to maximise pregnancy rates with fewer funded
cycles.19,20 Australia has one of the most supportive funding

 arrangements for ART, which partially explains its relatively high
utilisation rate,21 as well as its low multiple birth rate. This not only
makes Australia one of the safest countries in the world to receive
ART treatment, but also reduces the costs arising from multiple
gestation births.22 In New Zealand, access to two publicly funded
ART cycles is based on meeting specific criteria, including
restrictions according to age and body mass index, and only single
embryo transfers are permitted,23 resulting in similarly low
multiple birth rates, but also more limited access.4
CLBRs based on complete ART cycles are meaningful estimates of
the success of ART treatment, reflecting contemporary clinical
practice and encouraging safe embryo transfer practices. These
estimates can be used when counselling prospective parents about
the likelihood of treatment success, as well as for educating the
public and informing policy on ART treatments.
