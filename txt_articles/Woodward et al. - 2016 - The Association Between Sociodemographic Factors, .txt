Abstract
Purpose—Several small-scale studies have reported associations between keratoconus (KCN) 
and an array of systemic diseases but no large-scale study has fully investigated this topic. The 
purpose of this study is to determine whether an association exists between common systemic 
diseases, sociodemographic factors, and KCN among a large, diverse group of insured individuals 
in the United States.
Design—Retrospective longitudinal cohort study
Participants—16,053 patients with KCN were matched 1:1 to 16,053 persons without KCN.
Methods—Persons with KCN were identified using International Classification of Diseases 9th 
Revision Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) billing codes and matched by age, sex, and overall 
health to a control group with no record of KCN. A multivariable logistic regression assessed 
whether sociodemographic factors and certain systemic diseases affected the odds of KCN.
Main Outcome Measures—Odd ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of KCN
Results—After adjustment for confounders, blacks (adjusted OR=1.57, CI: 1.38–1.79, p<0.001) 
had 57% higher odds and Latinos (adjusted OR=1.43, CI: 1.26–1.62, p<0.001) had 43% higher 
odds of being diagnosed with KCN compared with whites. Asians had 39% reduced odds 
(OR=0.61, CI: 0.50–0.75, p<0.001) of being diagnosed with KCN compared to whites. Patients 
with uncomplicated diabetes mellitus (DM) had 20% lower odds of KCN (adjusted OR=0.80, CI: 
0.71–0.90, p=0.002) while patients with DM complicated by end-organ damage had 52% lower 
odds of having KCN (adjusted OR=0.48, CI: 0.40–0.58, p<0.001) compared to those without DM.

 Persons with collagen vascular disease had 35% lower odds of KCN (adjusted OR=0.65, CI: 0.47–
0.91, p=0.01). Other conditions found to have increased odds of KCN included sleep apnea 
(adjusted OR=1.13, CI: 1.00–1.27, p=0.05), asthma (adjusted OR=1.31, CI: 1.17–1.47, p<0.001), 
and Down syndrome (adjusted OR=6.22, CI: 2.08–18.66, p<0.001). There was no association 
between KCN and allergic rhinitis, mitral valve disorder, aortic aneurysm, or depression (p>0.1, 
for all comparisons).
Conclusions—Clinicians caring for persons with KCN should inquire about difficulties with 
breathing or sleeping and, when appropriate, refer patients to undergo evaluation for conditions 
such as sleep apnea or asthma. Lower risk of KCN in those with DM, potentially due to corneal 
glycosylation, opens an interesting area of research.
Keratoconus (KCN) is a chronic non-inflammatory ectatic condition with an insidious onset, 
often presenting with bilateral decreased vision due to increasing myopia and irregular 
astigmatism. Studies have reported that the prevalence of KCN ranges from 50 to 2,300 
cases per 100,000, depending on the country studied.1–3 This condition primarily affects 
working-age people between 18–40 years of age and, if left untreated, can have a profound 
impact on quality of well-being.
Understanding the association between systemic diseases and KCN may help elucidate the 
pathophysiology of the disease. In 2015, the Global Delphi Panel of Keratoconus and Ectatic 
Diseases, a group of 9 corneal subspecialists representing countries throughout the world, 
reported risk factors for developing KCN based on a post-meeting survey of the panelists 
which included ocular allergy, atopy, connective tissue disorders, and Down syndrome.4 
They also noted that persons of Asian and Arabian ethnicity may carry an increased risk of 
this disease.
Recent literature has focused on the potential connection between diabetes mellitus (DM) 
and KCN.5–8 The biomechanical theory of KCN postulates that elevated glucose in patients 
with DM leads to glycosylation of corneal fibers, which causes collagen crosslinking and 
strengthens the cornea thus reducing the risk of developing ectasia and KCN.9–12 While 
some clinical evidence supports this theory,5,6 a recent case-control study of 1377 patients 
with KCN actually found that patients with DM were more likely to have KCN compared to 
controls.7 Conflicting evidence in the clinical literature calls into question the nature of this 
association.13
A host of other systemic diseases have been reported to be associated with KCN including 
allergy, Down syndrome, collagen vascular disorders, aortic aneurysm, sleep apnea, atopy, 
asthma, and ocular allergy.14–21 One theory suggests that KCN and atopy are associated 
because pruritis leads to eye rubbing, which causes mechanical ‘wear’ of the cornea and 
progressive ectasia.16,22–26 Another theory is that the same human leukocyte antigens may 
be activated in KCN and allergic conditions.16 Although a strong association has been 
reported between Down syndrome and KCN, the pathophysiologic connection is unclear.27 
Some have postulated that persons with Down syndrome are more likely to rub their eyes, 
leading to the same mechanical wear that may be involved in the association between 
allergy and KCN. Whether or not systemic diseases that affect collagen, such as mitral valve 
prolapse and collagen vascular disorders, are associated with KCN has also been debated in

 the literature. Mitral valve prolapse and collagen vascular disease may be associated with 
KCN,28–30 although other studies have found no such association.31 Akcay and colleagues 
implicated abnormal or weak collagen structure in both mitral valve prolapse and collagen 
vascular disease.32 Similarly, a single-center survey of patients with KCN by Gupta and 
coworkers found that sleep apnea was more prevalent in patients with KCN than in the 
general population.33 These prior studies all had relatively small sample sizes ranging from 
25 to 1,529 patients, so for many of these conditions, the researchers were limited in their 
ability to perform rigorous statistical analyses and adjust for potential confounding factors.
The purpose of this study is to use a health care claims database containing records for over 
16,000 patients with KCN and controls matched by age, sex, and overall health to evaluate 
the association between various systemic diseases and KCN to help reconcile some of the 
conflicting reports in the literature.
Methods
Data Source
The Clinformatics DataMart database (OptumInsight, Eden Prairie, MN) contains detailed 
records of all beneficiaries in a large nationwide U.S. managed care network. The dataset 
contains all individuals with one or more International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for eye-related diagnoses (360–379.9)34, 
one or more Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for any eye-related visits, 
diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures (65091–68899 or 92002–92499)35, or any other claim 
submitted by an ophthalmologist or optometrist from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 
2012. For each enrollee, the data included all medical claims for ocular and non-ocular 
conditions and sociodemographic information including age, sex, race, education level, 
personal income, and geographic setting of residence at plan enrollment (residence in an 
urban or rural setting). All data were de-identified prior to receipt by the researchers and the 
University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approved this as a non-regulated study.
Identification of Cases and Controls
Enrollees were included in the analysis if they met the following criteria: continuous 
enrollment in the medical plan, enrollment in the plan for at least one year, and ≥1 visits to 
an eye care provider (ophthalmologist or optometrist). The requirement of ≥1 visit to an eye 
care provider helped assure that all the enrollees had at least 1 opportunity to get diagnosed 
with KCN. Beneficiaries were identified with KCN (cases) if they had the following ICD-9-
CM codes: 371.6, 371.60–.62. A confirmatory diagnosis of KCN at another visit on a 
separate date was required to classify an enrollee with KCN. A control group was randomly 
selected among patients with one or more visits to an eye care provider and no record of 
KCN who were enrolled in the medical plan between 2001 and 2012. Cases and controls 
were matched 1:1 on age at plan enrollment, sex, and overall health based on Clinical Risk 
Group (CRG) score. CRG is a measure of overall health status that is commonly used in 
health services research. It assigns persons to a risk group based on demographics and 
clinical diseases to predict future healthcare needs.36

 Identification of Presence of Systemic Diseases
Systemic diseases chosen for this study were identified from a review of the literature of 
prior studies and case series that have reported associations between such conditions and 
KCN. ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes were used to identify individuals with the following 
systemic diseases of interest: DM, asthma, allergic rhinitis, mitral valve prolapse, collagen 
vascular disease, aortic aneurysm, Down syndrome, sleep apnea, and depression. Persons 
with DM were defined as having uncomplicated DM if they had no record of end-organ 
damage from this condition, while those with any record of end-organ damage, including 
nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, or circulatory disorders, were characterized as having 
complicated DM. A listing of the specific ICD-9-CM codes for all conditions and 
procedures for this study can be found in Online Table 1 (available at www.aaojournal.org). 
Since the goal of this analysis was to identify associations between these systemic diseases 
and KCN and not to necessarily identify systemic conditions that cause KCN, we did not 
restrict diagnoses of these systemic conditions having occurred before the first record of 
KCN, thus cases and controls could have received the diagnosis of these conditions at any 
time while in the plan.
Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC). Participant characteristics were summarized for the entire sample using means and 
standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for 
categorical variables.
Multivariable Regression Models—A multivariable logistic regression model was 
constructed to estimate the potential association of various systemic diseases with a 
diagnosis of KCN. The dependent variable in the model was a diagnosis of KCN. The 
independent variables included sociodemographic factors (race, income, education, urban/
rural residential status) and all of the above-mentioned medical conditions of interest that 
have previously been reported to be associated with KCN, length of time in the medical 
plan, and number of visits to eye care providers. By including length of time in plan and 
number of eye visits in the model, we are accounting for these factors that can impact odds 
of getting diagnosed with KCN and other conditions.
In a second logistic regression model we assessed, among those persons with KCN, whether 
the same covariates listed above were associated with receipt of a diagnosis of severe KCN 
versus mild KCN. Persons were characterized with severe KCN if they had ≥1 record of 
keratoplasty surgery (CPT-4 codes 65710, 65730, 65750, 65755) during their time in the 
plan or if they were coded with ICD-9-CM code 371.62 (keratoconus with acute hydrops). 
Persons identified with KCN by codes 371.6 or 371.61 and with no record of keratoplasty or 
record of code 371.62 during their time in the plan were considered to have mild disease.
In a separate multivariable regression model adjusting for these same covariates as the 
previous model, we assessed the relationship between KCN and different manifestations of 
end-organ damage from DM (neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, circulatory disease,

 more than one of these manifestations). We also assessed KCN severity with different 
manifestations of end-organ damage from DM.
Checks of the models for multicolinearity were performed and none of the covariates were 
highly correlated with one another. For all analyses, p-values of <0.05 were considered 
statistically significant.
Results
A total of 16,053 beneficiaries with KCN met the study inclusion criteria along with 16,053 
controls matched 1:1 by age, sex, and CRG score. (Figure 1) Among those diagnosed with 
KCN, 13,727 patients (85.5%) were characterized with mild KCN and 2,326 patients 
(14.5%) were characterized with severe KCN. The mean ± SD age at enrollment of patients 
with KCN (and matched controls) was 40.4 ± 13.0 years. The patients with KCN were 
enrolled in the plan for 4.7 ± 2.9 years, and controls were enrolled for 4.6 ± 2.9 years. The 
proportion of persons with KCN who graduated from college was higher than the controls 
(32.4% vs. 28.2%) as was the proportion with incomes ≥$100,000 (38.9% vs. 35.1%). 
(Table 1) As expected, patients with KCN had over double the number of visits to eye care 
providers (6.5 ± 7.1 visits) than the controls (2.6 ± 3.2 visits) (p<0.001). Online Table 2 
(available at www.aaojournal.org) describes the characteristics of those with mild versus 
severe KCN.
Sociodemographic Factors
After accounting for confounding factors, blacks had a 57% higher odds of KCN than whites 
(adjusted OR=1.57, CI: 1.38–1.79, p<0.001), and Latinos had a 43% higher odds of KCN 
compared to whites (adjusted OR=1.43, CI: 1.26–1.62, p<0.001). Asian Americans had a 
39% lower odds of KCN compared with whites (adjusted OR=0.61, CI: 0.50–0.75, 
p<0.001). Education level (p>0.05 for all comparisons) and personal income (p≥0.40 for all 
comparisons) were not associated with higher or lower odds of KCN. Compared to persons 
residing in urban communities, those living in large rural communities had a 20% lower 
odds of KCN (adjusted OR=0.80, CI=0.68–0.94, p=0.007). (Table 2)
Systemic Diseases
In the multivariable regression model, persons with uncomplicated DM had a 20% reduced 
odds of KCN (adjusted OR=0.80, CI: 0.71–0.90, p=0.002), and those with complicated DM 
had a 52% reduced odds of KCN (OR=0.48, CI=0.40–0.58, p<0.001) compared to those 
without DM. Persons with collagen vascular disease had 35% reduced odds (OR=0.65, 
CI=0.47–0.91, p=0.01) had reduced odds of KCN. By comparison, persons with sleep apnea 
had a 13% increased odds of KCN (OR=1.13, CI: 1.00–1.27, p=0.05), those with asthma 
had a 31% increased odds of KCN (OR=1.31, CI: 1.17–1.47, p<0.001), and persons with 
Down syndrome had over a 6 fold increased odds of KCN (OR=6.22, CI: 2.08–18.66, 
p<0.001). There was no significant association between allergic rhinitis (p=0.51), mitral 
valve prolapse (p=0.08), aortic aneurysm (p=0.39), or depression (p=0.96) and KCN (Table 
2).

 In the separate multivariable regression model, we assessed the relationship between KCN 
and different manifestations of end-organ damage from DM. In this model, patients who had 
multiple (>1) manifestations of end-organ damage from DM had 66% lower odds of KCN 
(p<0.001) compared to those without DM (data not shown).
Associations of Systemic Diseases with Mild versus Severe Keratoconus
Among enrollees with KCN, after adjustment for confounders, the following factors were 
associated with increased odds of receiving a diagnosis of severe KCN compared to mild 
KCN: black race (OR=1.31, CN 1.10–1.56, p=0.003), uncomplicated DM (OR=1.23, 
CI=1.02–1.48, p=0.03), sleep apnea (OR=1.29, CI=1.09–1.53, p=0.003), and asthma 
(OR=1.21, CI=1.03–1.42, p=0.02). Two factors were associated with reduced odds of severe 
KCN compared to mild KCN: allergic rhinitis (OR=0.82, CI=0.72–0.94, p=0.004) and 
female sex (OR=0.76, CI=0.68–0.85, p<0.001). There were no statistically significant 
difference among persons with complicated DM (p=0.40), Down syndrome (p=0.34), mitral 
valve prolapse (p=0.75), collagen vascular disease (p=0.58), aortic aneurysm (p=0.44) 
depression (p=0.25), and severity of KCN (Table 3).
Discussion
Using a large nationwide managed care network health care claims database enabled us to 
harness data on large numbers of patients with KCN to learn more about this relatively 
uncommon but serious ocular disease. These analyses identified several key findings. First, 
the odds of KCN vary by race. Blacks and Latinos had higher odds of KCN while Asian 
Americans had a reduced odds of this disease relative to whites. Second, we learned that 
patients with DM and those with collagen vascular disease were less likely to have KCN. By 
comparison, persons with asthma, sleep apnea, and Down syndrome had considerably higher 
odds of receiving a diagnosis of KCN.
We found that Black and Latino persons had approximately 50% higher odds of KCN 
compared with whites. To the best of our knowledge, this finding has not been noted in the 
literature, perhaps because prior studies lacked adequate numbers of racial minorities to 
assess for differences in risk of KCN by race. We also found that Asian Americans had 
reduced odds of KCN. This finding differs from the consensus of a Delphi panel, consisting 
of cornea subspecialists from United States, Brazil, Singapore, Japan, India, and France, 
who concluded that Asian persons had at higher risk of keratoconus.4 The prior evidence 
substantiating a greater risk of KCN among Asian persons is somewhat limited. Two studies 
conducted in the United Kingdom with sample sizes of 338 and 75 patients with KCN 
reported a greater proportion of patients of Asian ethnicity compared with non-Asians.37,38 
Unlike our study, these investigations did not perform multivariable regression modeling to 
account for confounding factors. Nevertheless, additional work is needed to reconcile 
differences in the findings of these studies and ours with respect to whether Asian persons 
are at greater or lower risk of this disease.
Since we matched cases and controls by age and sex, we were unable to study whether these 
demographic factors impacted the risk of developing KCN. Several studies have reported 
that males are at higher risk for developing KCN.1,15,19,20,38,39 Among the 16,053 persons

 in this analysis identified with KCN, a greater proportion (58.9%) were male, which is in 
line with other studies. Moreover, we found that females had a 24% reduced odds of 
experiencing severe KCN compared with males.
After accounting for confounding variables, we did not find an association between 
education level or personal income and KCN. This is encouraging as one may suspect that 
patients with KCN would have limitations in education and employment because of limited 
vision from this disease but this appears to not be the case. Fortunately, advances in medical 
and surgical care, including use of rigid gas permeable contact lenses, have allowed many 
patients with KCN to achieve good visual acuity so they can be highly productive. It is 
important to note, though, that all of the patients with KCN in our study had health 
insurance and we suspect that these findings may not hold true for patients with KCN 
without health insurance.
Persons residing in large rural communities had lower odds of having KCN, and there was a 
similar trend in small rural populations. Possible explanations for this finding include 
persons residing in rural settings may be less likely to have access to corneal specialists for 
diagnosis and management of KCN and thus patients with mild or form fruste disease may 
go undetected in these settings. It is also possible that environmental pollutants in urban 
settings may exacerbate eye rubbing which could increase the odds of KCN.
Consistent with pathophysiologic mechanisms of crosslinking by glycosylation,9–12 our 
study showed that persons with DM had considerably reduced odds of KCN. Those with 
DM complicated by end-organ damage had 52% lower odds of KCN and persons with 
uncomplicated DM had 20% lower odds of KCN compared to persons without DM. 
Additional analyses showed that persons with multiple manifestations of end organ damage 
from DM had 66% lower odds of KCN compared to persons without DM. These results 
align with the findings of a study by Seiler and coworkers who evaluated 571 patients with 
KCN.5 Their group matched patients on age and sex with controls, and showed a 78% 
reduced odds of KCN (p=0.03) among persons with DM. In contrast, another case-control 
study by Kosker and colleagues, found that patients with DM were more likely to have 
KCN.7 It is worth noting, the work by Kosker did not account for length of follow up by the 
physicians and may have also been affected by surveillance bias such that patients with DM 
in their study likely underwent more frequent ocular examinations and thus had a greater 
opportunity to get identified with KCN compared to the control group.7 While the study by 
Seiler and ours may also be affected by surveillance bias, if DM increases the likelihood of 
seeking eye care and thus receiving a KCN diagnosis, one would expect more frequent 
interactions would bias the results to higher odds of KCN among persons with DM. 
Therefore our observation of a reduced odds of KCN among persons with DM suggests the 
true effect of a risk reduction may be larger than the levels we are capturing in our analysis 
once one considers differences in the frequency of eye care encounters between groups.
Kuo and colleagues reported that patients with more severe manifestations of DM were less 
likely to get diagnosed with severe KCN.6 Although our analysis did not reveal that those 
with increased severity of DM had a reduced severity of KCN, we did find that those with 
multiple manifestations of end-organ damage from DM were less likely to get diagnosed

 with KCN. If patients with DM as a group are indeed protected against KCN, therapies 
aimed at raising glucose levels in the cornea may be a viable therapeutic alternative to 
collagen crosslinking with riboflavin and ultraviolet light to prevent or treat KCN.
Consistent with published literature, we found that patients with Down syndrome had more 
than a 6 times higher odds of KCN.15 Despite such a strong association in this and other 
studies, researchers have yet to identify specific genetic mutations linking these 
conditions.27 Given some of the challenges that persons with Down syndrome have with 
communicating health concerns, a high index of suspicion for KCN is warranted in these 
patients since vision aids, corneal transplantation, and potentially collagen cross-linking 
treatment to halt disease progression may be able to improve the vision and quality of life of 
these patients. Furthermore, the findings of this analysis highlight the importance of regular 
eye care for patients with Down syndrome to monitor for KCN and other ocular diseases.
In our study, patients with asthma had 31% higher odds of having KCN. Moreover, those 
with asthma had a 21% increased odds of severe KCN. A recent cross-sectional study of 
adolescents evaluated by the Israeli Defense Force also showed an increased odds of KCN 
in persons with asthma (p<0.001).20 In their study, asthma was diagnosed by pulmonary 
function tests or consultation with a pulmonologist. In light of the findings of our study and 
theirs, we feel it is appropriate to inquire about breathing difficulties in patients with KCN 
as one may identify patients with previously undiagnosed asthma who may benefit from 
treatment.
An association of sleep apnea, floppy eyelid syndrome, and KCN has been well 
established.33,40–43 Gupta and colleagues conducted a survey of patients with KCN showing 
that 65% either had previously diagnosed sleep apnea or were at high risk for sleep apnea by 
the Berlin questionnaire.33 In our study, a greater proportion of persons with KCN had sleep 
apnea (10.6% vs. 8.7%), and patients with sleep apnea had 13% higher odds of KCN. Sleep 
apnea was also associated with more severe KCN. Given the increased morbidity and 
mortality associated with sleep apnea, it may be reasonable to administer the Berlin 
questionnaire to patients with KCN to screen for sleep apnea and consider requesting a 
formal sleep study for those found to be at high risk.
In our study, there was no statistical significant difference between controls and persons 
with KCN in receiving a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. In a study of Israeli adolescents, there 
was an increased odds of KCN among these patients (p<0.001),20 but allergic rhinitis was 
diagnosed by self-report, and not with quantitative diagnostic tests as was the case with 
asthma. We believe the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis likely represents a heterogeneous group 
of conditions of varying severity which makes it challenging to adequately analyze using 
claims data as we have attempted to do. Genetic studies have identified candidate genes for 
KCN linked to atopic disease including filaggrin mutations in atopic dermatitis and 
interleukin 1 pathway changes that occur with mechanical injury in keratoconic eyes.27 
Additional research is needed to better understand whether allergic rhinitis is associated with 
KCN.

 Our study has several strengths. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest to 
date focused on persons with KCN with over 16,000 cases identified in the database. We 
had a diverse group of patients of different sociodemographic profiles with relatively large 
numbers of racial minorities. These analyses identified patients with KCN residing in 
communities throughout the country who were receiving care by an array of different eye 
care providers including optometrists, comprehensive ophthalmologists, and corneal 
specialists. As such, the findings may have more generalizability relative to single center 
studies or those from academic centers that may be a biased sample of those with more 
severe disease.44 In addition, claims data does not rely on patient self-report of medical 
conditions such as KCN. Others have demonstrated patient self-report is less reliable 
compared with diagnoses made by medical professionals.45
Our study also has several limitations. First, without access to clinical records, we cannot 
confirm the presence of KCN among those identified as cases or absence of disease in 
controls.44 That said, a study by Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services found the 
specialty of ophthalmology has one of the lowest rates of improper coding of ocular 
diagnoses.46 Moreover, to help ensure that those who had been coded with KCN did indeed 
have the disease we required a confirmatory diagnosis on a separate visit. Second, it is 
difficult with claims data alone to determine causality between specific systemic diseases 
and KCN. This limitation is acknowledged. The purpose of the study was to identify 
whether these conditions are associated with one another or not. Additional studies using 
other data sources are needed to establish whether a causal relationship is present among the 
conditions we found to be associated with KCN. Third, we adjusted our regression model 
for important confounding factors but the data source lacks clinical detail on other factors 
such as eye rubbing, family history of KCN, and ocular and systemic diseases identified 
prior to plan enrollment. Lastly, all patients included had health insurance. Additional 
research using other data sources is needed to determine whether the findings can be 
generalized to the uninsured or those with other forms of insurance.
In conclusion, this study identified several factors that were associated with an increased or 
decreased risk of KCN. Clinicians should be aware that patients with KCN might have 
breathing issues and sleep disorders that carry risk of morbidity and mortality and should 
refer patients with KCN who are suspected to have sleep apnea or asthma to medical 
specialists for further evaluation. Caregivers of Down syndrome should be aware of KCN as 
a cause of vision impairment and make sure that persons with this condition are regularly 
seen by eye care professionals to monitor for KCN and other ocular diseases. The reduced 
odds of KCN among persons with DM supports the notion that corneal crosslinking may 
help stabilize the cornea from developing ectasia and KCN in persons with DM and this 
finding may help researchers identify novel treatment options to try to prevent or treat KCN.
