In Brief
Lee et al. reveal how glucose utilization by
brown fat in humans is coupled with heat
production in a circadian manner. Higher
brown fat abundance correlates with
lesser glycemia variability, suggesting
that brown fat may help buffer glucose
fluctuations and maintain whole-body
glucose homeostasis over time.

SUMMARY
High abundance of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is
linked to lower glycaemia in humans, leading to
the belief that BAT may protect against diabetes.
The relationship between BAT glucose utilization
and systemic glucose homeostasis has not been
defined. In this paper we have characterized glycae-
mic excursions and BAT thermogenic responses in
human brown adipocytes, BAT explants, and healthy
adults through supraclavicular temperature profiling,
revealing their circadian coupling in vivo and in vitro,
orchestrated by UCP1, GLUT4, and Rev-erba bio-
rhythms. Extent of glycated haemoglobin also corre-
lated positively
with environmental
temperature
among community-dwelling patients. These data un-
cover potential crosstalk between BAT and glucose
regulatory pathways, evident on cellular, tissue, indi-
vidual, and population levels, and provide impetus to
search for BAT harnessing strategies for therapeutic
purposes.
INTRODUCTION
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) generates heat by uncoupling
oxidative phosphorylation through the action of mitochondrial
uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). In cold-exposed rodents, this pro-
cess consumes remarkable quantities of glucose and lipids, far
exceeding hepatic and skeletal muscle capacity (Bartelt et al.,
2011). Accordingly, BAT induction reverses hyperglycaemia
and protects animals against diabetes (Schrauwen et al., 2015).
Rediscovery of BAT in humans (hBAT) by 18F-deoxyglucose
(FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT has driven global
research interest into therapeutic potential of BAT recruitment as
diabetes treatment (Spiegelman, 2013). BAT detection by cold-
stimulated PET/CT builds upon high FDG uptake of hBAT to
reveal its activity, supporting hBAT as a glucose-utilizing tissue.
It is widely assumed that its high FDG uptake indicates its partic-
ipation in whole-body glucose metabolism, at least during cold
exposure. This is corroborated by cross-sectional studies
revealing lower glycaemia among adults with greater hBAT
abundance (Lee et al., 2010; Matsushita et al., 2014), stimulation
of glucose uptake in hBAT by cold and insulin (Orava et al., 2011),
and improvement of insulin sensitivity following hBAT recruit-
ment (Chondronikola et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014b). However,
direct evidence associating hBAT activity with glycaemic excur-
sions is lacking. Whether hBAT activity relates to whole-body
glycaemia in the absence of cold exposure is not known. This
remains a fundamental question in the quest of BAT-based
therapeutics.
In this study, we explored the relationship between hBAT
and glucose metabolism in a series of whole-body and in vitro
studies in humans. We hypothesized that hBAT regulates
glucose fluxes and plays a determinative role in whole-body
glucose homeostasis.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Supraclavicular Skin Temperature Is a Surrogate for
hBAT Status
Cold-stimulated PET/CT provides only a single snapshot of
hBAT FDG uptake in time. In contrast, supraclavicular (SCV)
skin temperature profiling, previously shown to reflect BAT activ-
ity (Boon et al., 2014; Jang et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2011), can be
applied continuously and may be a feasible tool of capturing
hBAT activity in real time. To validate this methodology, eighteen
healthy volunteers (29 ± 4 years old, 15 men, body mass index
[BMI] 23 ± 2 kg/m2) underwent cold-stimulated PET/CT scanning
with concurrent measurement of skin temperature responses.
hBAT was present in all volunteers by PET/CT criteria (96 ± 11
g, mean standard uptake value [SUV] 3.4 ± 0.8) (Figures 1A
and 1B). Core temperature was unchanged, but mean skin tem-
perature fell and SCV skin temperature increased upon cold
exposure (Figure 1C), consistent with maintenance of thermal
balance via activation of insulative (5% ± 6%, p < 0.01) and
BAT thermogenic (3% ± 2%, p < 0.01) responses. Supraclavic-
ular temperature response (STR) during cold exposure corre-
lated positively with BAT activity (Figure 1D). These results

 thus validate STR profiling as a surrogate for hBAT status and
provide a tool to explore relationship between STR (i.e., hBAT
activity) and glucose metabolism in a real-time continuous
fashion.
hBAT Thermogenesis Increases during Glucose
Challenge
The same volunteers with known BAT status then underwent an
oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on a separate study day at
thermoneutrality (24�C). We hypothesized that STR would in-
crease during OGTT if hBAT was indeed a glucose-utilizing or-
gan. STR increased progressively during OGTT (Figure 1E),
exceeding baseline by 0.2�C ± 0.1�C at 120 min (p = 0.04) and
correlated positively with glucose-induced thermogenesis (GIT)
(Figure 1F). A positive correlation was also observed between
STR during cold exposure and OGTT within subject (r = 0.69,
p < 0.01), further supporting BAT as a common regulatory origin
of the two processes. In contrast, no relationships existed be-
tween changes in GIT and/or STR with blood pressure or heart
rate, indicating STR was not a phenomenon of general sympa-
thetic arousal (see Table S1 available online). No relationships
were observed between BAT abundance and prandial hormonal
and insulin-related indices (Table S1).
BAT is a regulator of GIT in animals, but how GIT is controlled
in humans has remained enigmatic (Himms-Hagen, 1989, 1995;
Isler et al., 1987). Our findings provide evidence linking hBAT
activation to GIT response during glucose challenge. This is
concordant with animal studies identifying BAT as a glucose-
clearing organ (Bartelt et al., 2011). Overall BAT positivity
among our healthy volunteers could have reduced the sensitivity
in detecting relationships between BAT versus insulin-related
parameters.
Glucose Utilization and Transport in Human Brown
Adipocytes
To ascertain a causal relationship between BAT activity and
glucose homeostasis, we characterized glucose utilization in
primary human brown adipocyte culture, a hBAT model
independent of systemic influences. Primary human brown
(hBA) and white adipocyte (hWA) cultures were established
from deep and subcutaneous neck adipose tissue, regions
known to harbor brown and white adipocyte precursors,
respectively
(Jespersen
et
al.,
2013).
Differentiated
hBA
expressed brown/beige but not white fat genes (Figure 2A).
Transcripts of GLUT4 and UCP1 mRNA were significantly
more abundant in hBA than in hWA (Figure 2A). Accordingly,
brown adipogenesis was accompanied by upregulation of
UCP1 and GLUT4 (Figure 2B), but not GLUT1 protein (Fig-
ure S1A). Glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, and fatty acid oxida-
tion were all significantly greater in hBA compared to hWA
(Figures S1B–S1E).
Although PET/CT demonstrates glucose/fatty acid uptake in
human BAT (Ouellet et al., 2012), the extent of glucose/fatty
acid-utilizing capacity of hBAT has remained elusive to date.
Our findings reveal functional glucose uptake machinery in
hBA sufficient to impact cellular bioenergetics and their sub-
strate versatility between glucose and fatty acids. These results
shed mechanistic insight on the close correlations between STR
and GIT observed in healthy volunteers.
Human Brown Adipocytes Display Circadian Glucose
Uptake
Coupling of glucose utilization and UCP1 expression in hBA
begs the question of whether hBA exhibits an intrinsic glucose-
responsive rhythm. Recent studies have discovered circadian
Figure 1. BAT, Thermogenic Response, and Glucose-Induced Thermogenesis
Cold-stimulated PET/CT scanning revealed BAT positivity in all volunteers. (A) and (B) show representative images of volunteers with high and low abundance,
respectively. During personalized cold exposure, mean skin temperature decreased while supraclavicular temperature rose (C). Core temperature remained
unchanged. Mean BAT activity (measured in standardized uptake value [SUV]) correlated positively with cold-stimulated supraclavicular temperature response
(cSTR) (D). During oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), BAT temperature progressively increased and mean temperature was significantly greater than baseline
after 60 min (E). Supraclavicular temperature response (gSTR) correlated positively with glucose-induced thermogenesis (GIT) (F). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

 thermogenic plasticity of rodent BAT under the control of nuclear
receptor Rev-erba (Gerhart-Hines et al., 2013). These led us to
hypothesize the existence of a functional circadian rhythm en-
trained in hBA orchestrated by UCP1, Rev-erba, and GLUT4
oscillations.
First, we profiled UCP1, GLUT4, and Rev-erba excursions in
hBA synchronized by serum shock. Figure 2C shows rhythmic
UCP1 expression antiphase to Rev-erba in hBA, with GLUT4
tracking UCP1 expression (p < 0.001). As a result, the nadir of
Rev-erba preceded peaks of UCP1 and GLUT4. Next, functional
significance of rhythmic gene changes was explored by glucose
uptake measurement. Basal glucose uptake demonstrated sig-
nificant rhythmicity (Figure 2D) with doubling of its amplitude
occurring at the fitted acrophase (�30 hr) (Table S3). These find-
ings unveil the presence of a functional glucose-utilizing rhythm
in human brown adipocytes.
Insulin and adrenergic agents are both known stimuli of
brown
adipose
thermogenesis.
We
thus
investigated
if
glucose-utilizing rhythms are insulin and b-adrenergic sensi-
tive. Insulin augmented the observed circadian rhythm by
19% ± 4% (p < 0.01) [Figure 2E]. However, coincubation
with a pan-b antagonist had no effect on glucose uptake
(�3% ± 4%, p = 0.45) (Figure 2F). These results suggest the
existence of nonadrenergic mediators capable of modulating
hBA metabolic activities. This is consistent with reports
showing greater BAT activation by cold exposure than phar-
macological sympathetic stimuli (Cypess et al., 2012; Vossel-
man et al., 2012). Indeed, nonadrenergic BAT-activating
agents, such as adenosine (Gnad et al., 2014), have been
described recently. Future studies should dissect the contribu-
tion of adrenergic and nonadrenergic factors on hBA bioener-
getics and glucose metabolism.
Figure 2. Human Brown Adipocytes Exhibit Glucose-Responsive Circadian Rhythm
(A) shows higher expression of general BAT, beige, and brown gene markers in differentiated human brown adipocytes (hBA) compared to white adipocytes
(hWA). UCP1 and GLUT4 were progressively upregulated during brown adipogenesis (B). Circadian rhythmicity of UCP1, Rev-erba, and GLUT4 were observed in
hBA following serum synchronization (C). Glucose uptake in hBA manifested circadian rhythm in basal state (D) and was augmented by insulin (20 nM) (E) but
unaffected by propranolol (1 uM) (F). Changes in glucose uptake were mirrored by plasma membrane (PM) GLUT4 expression (G and I) but not whole-cell or
cytosolic (C) GLUT4 level (H and I). Indinavir decreased hBA heat production in a dose-dependent manner, as shown by representative thermogram from 2 hBA
specimens (S1 and S2) in duplicates (J). Graph next to thermogram represents mean temperature changes from four hBA specimens. *p < 0.01, **p < 0.001,
compared to hWA or PBS treatment. Data are presented as mean ± SD.

 Because GLUT4 was significantly upregulated in mature
hBA (Figure 2B), we hypothesized GLUT4 expression to be an
effector of observed glucose uptake rhythmicity. As expected
from its t1/2, UCP1 protein did not change (data not shown) (Ne-
dergaard and Cannon, 2013). Total cellular GLUT4 protein was
also unchanged (Figure 2H). In contrast, plasma membrane
GLUT4 abundance varied in a rhythmic fashion (Figures 2G
and 2I), with peak and trough expression mirroring circadian
glucose uptake (Figure 2D). Insulin treatment alone without
serum synchronization abolished the observed rhythm (Figures
S1G and S1H). Taken together, these results indicate circadian
cytosolic-membrane GLUT4 trafficking as a mechanism contrib-
uting to cell-autonomous glucose uptake oscillations in hBA.
GLUT4 Upregulation Is Accompanied by Heat
Production in Human Brown Adipocytes
As the primary function of BAT is heat production, we asked
whether glucose utilization indeed couples with BAT thermogen-
esis. Heat production was quantified by high-sensitivity infrared
thermography during brown adipogenesis. Mature hBA that
expressed high abundance of UCP1 and GLUT4 (Figure 2B) pro-
duced the greatest amount of heat (0.5�C ± 0.2�C, p < 0.001)
(Figure S1F). Following indinavir treatment, a GLUT4-inhibiting
compound (Konrad et al., 2002), glucose uptake decreased (Fig-
ure S1I), which in turn repressed heat production in a dose-
dependent manner (Figure 2J). These results thus underscore
regulatory links between UCP1 and GLUT4 in fueling brown
adipose functional thermogenic machinery.
Crosstalk between hBAT Thermogenesis and Circadian
Glucose Homeostasis In Vivo
If hBA exhibits a cell-autonomous thermogenic rhythm, does a
corresponding rhythm modulate systemic glucose homeosta-
sis? We explored this possibility by performing simultaneous
continuous STR and subcutaneous glucose monitoring over a
12 hr period in 15 volunteers (27 ± 4 years old, 12 men, BMI
23 ± 3 kg/m2). They were stratified into three groups based on
BAT activity and differed only by BAT status (Table S2), thereby
allowing assessment of STR-glycaemia relationships indepen-
dent of anthropometric/hormonal confounders. Time-depen-
dent cross-correlation (R2 = 0.58, p < 0.001) coupled STR
and glucose excursions among BAT positive volunteers as a
whole (Figure 3A). No relationships were observed between
STR, core, and/or abdominal/mediastinal skin temperatures
(Table S1). Among individuals with the highest BAT abundance
(BAThigh), a negative correlation (R2 = 0.31, p < 0.0001) was de-
tected between glucose and STR (Figure 3B), with STR leading
glycaemic changes by three time periods (Figure 3D). In contrast,
glucose correlated positively with STR (R2 = 0.10, p < 0.001)
among individuals with low BAT abundance (BATlow) (Figure 3C),
and glycaemic changes preceded STR evolution among these
individuals (Figure 3F). No relationships were detected between
STR or glucose excursions among volunteers devoid of any
BAT (BATneg) (Figures S2A–S2D). BAT activity did not relate to
maximal or mean glycaemia (Table S1) but correlated negatively
with overall glycaemic variability (Figure 3E), which was greatest
among BATneg individuals (Figures S2E and S2F).
Our real-time BAT-glucose profiling in healthy volunteers re-
vealed an unexpected dichotomous relationship between ther-
mogenesis and glucose excursion dependent on BAT abun-
dance. Among BATlow individuals, BAT responds to systemic
glycaemic fluctuation, conceivably functioning as a glucose
sink (Kajimura et al., 2015). In contrast, BAT thermogenesis
modulates glycaemia directly among BAThigh individuals. Since
BAT activity was more than doubled in these volunteers
with ‘‘superactive BAT’’ compared to BATlow individuals, it is
tempting to speculate an activity-dependent BAT threshold
potentiating glucose-clearing dynamics. One cannot exclude
the possibility that a yet-to-be-defined systemic signal mediates
glycaemic changes in BAThigh individuals. Although no relation-
ships were observed between total glucose output and BAT ac-
tivity, possibly a result of the inclusion of a healthy euglycaemic
cohort, high BAT abundance was associated with significantly
lesser glycaemic variability, a protective factor against dysme-
tabolism (Blaak et al., 2012). Whether BATneg individuals, who
exhibited the greatest glycaemic variability, are at risk of dia-
betes warrants further prospective investigations.
hBAT Retains Rev-erba Circadian Patterning Ex Vivo
To definitively confirm that STR indeed represents an under-
lying BAT biorhythm, we repeated experiments using hBAT
ex vivo. Freshly harvested hBAT explants (Figure 4B) were
cultured and UCP1 expression studied in a circadian fashion
(Figure 4A). The underlying hypothesis is that hBAT explants
retained their intrinsic thermogenic rhythm entrained in vivo.
We mimicked physiologic sleep-wake cycle by extracting
mRNA throughout extrapolated day/night periods. A circadian
rhythm of UCP1, peaking during the day and reaching a nadir
at night, was observed, and UCP1 expression rose at dawn,
closely resembling in vivo STR responses (Figure 4C). GLUT4
tracked UCP1 rhythm closely, while Rev-erba manifested a
reciprocal relationship with UCP1 and GLUT4 (Figure 4C).
Their imputed parameters from periodic regression analysis
were concordant with those observed in primary brown adipo-
cytes (Table S3).
The physiology of the ‘‘dawning’’ phenomenon is poorly
understood. In rodents, BAT activity rises just before waking
(Gerhart-Hines et al., 2013), conceivably a survival mechanism
preparing animals for thermal defense during relatively cold-
challenged wakeful hours. Hormones that rise at dawn, such
as catecholamines and cortisol, have been regarded as sig-
nals prompting the waking response in humans. We therefore
examined thermogenic genes in hBAT explants incubated with
adrenergic or glucocorticoid antagonists to investigate their
interdependence. Neither affected expression of UCP1, GLUT4,
or Rev-erba (Table S3). Taken together, BAT explants harbored
the highest abundance of UCP1 and GLUT4 transcripts at hours
equating to prewaking period unaltered by adrenocortical or sym-
pathetic hormonal influences, further supporting the functionality
of a bona fide BAT thermogenic axis in humans.
Study Limitations
We emphasize that STR is a surrogate measurement of BAT
activity and does not represent a direct quantification of BAT
thermogenesis per se. Confounding by skin perfusion/insulation
is unlikely, given absent relationships between BAT and non-
SCV skin temperatures. Although we captured Rev-erba and
GLUT4 circadian rhythms in vitro and ex vivo, whether the

605
 same entrainment is present in vivo cannot be proven within the
confines of clinical research.
An Evolutionary Perspective
In the survival hierarchy, core temperature defense trumps
food/water. Our ancestors frequently faced cold/famine as
simultaneous environmental challenges. Active BAT may be a
survival organ, allowing defense against cold, minimization of
shivering, and thus efficient food hunting/gathering in a sub-
thermal environment. A hBAT-glucose biorhythm could repre-
sent a constitutive component of a fundamental survival mech-
anism ensuring protected BAT substrate utility independent of
nutrient-related hormonal signals, as BAT activity restrained
by nutrient scarcity could prove detrimental when thermal de-
fense is life sustaining.
Clinical Implications
Modernization has moved humans indoors. Hypothermia is
an infrequent threat. However, active BAT may equip the body
with an intrinsic glycemic buffering system. Coupling of STR
with glucose-induced thermogenesis led us to speculate that
‘‘BAT deficiency’’ could be a clinical stage potentially heralding
fasting/prandial hyperglycaemia development. So does BAT
abundance affect glycaemia over time? Because BAT is known
to be most abundant in winter (Saito et al., 2009), we probed
this question by examining the relationship between glycaemia
and outdoor temperature in 65,535 patients who had blood tests
throughout a 1-year period. Environmental temperature corre-
lated positively with glycated haemoglobin, a measurement of
overall glucose control (Figure S3). Whether this is a benefit of
greater BAT abundance merits further studies.
Figure 3. BAT Thermogenic and Glucose Circadian Rhythms in Healthy Volunteers
(A) shows 12 hr (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.) continuous tracing of supraclavicular temperature response (STR), core temperature (Tc), and subcutaneous glucose excursions
in 12 healthy volunteers, stratified into BAT high (BAThigh) and low (BATlow) status. Both BAThigh (B) and BATlow (C) individuals manifested significant cross-
correlations between STR and glucose. (D) and (F) are cross-correlation plots between glucose excursion and STR. A positive lag indicates that the first series
(i.e., glucose) leads the second series (i.e., STR), while a negative lag indicates that the first series (i.e., glucose) follows the second (i.e., STR). In this regard, STR
tracked glucose excursions among BATlow volunteers as signified by weakly positive correlative coefficients (F). In contrast, STR led changes in glycaemia among
BAThigh subjects, with strongly negative correlation coefficients (D). In other words, STR is a leading indicator among BAThigh individuals and predicts glucose
level best three periods later. Total BAT activity correlated negatively with glucose variability (E). Data are presented as mean ± SD.

 Summary and Conclusions
In a series of combined in vitro and in vivo experiments, we have
simultaneously captured glucose and BAT thermogenic bio-
rhythms, revealing their bidirectional modulatory relationships.
BAT participates in glucose clearance, yet in high abundance it
may be capable of dictating glycaemic excursions in healthy
humans. Collectively, our report provides evidence supporting
a therapeutically relevant glucose-modulatory role of active hu-
man BAT beyond cold-induced thermogenesis.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Clinical Studies
Eighteen
healthy
volunteers
were
recruited
via
local
advertisement
to participate in the Brown Adipose Tissue Thermogenesis in Humans
(BATTMAN) Study (ANZCTR: ACTRN1261500688583). The St. Vincent’s
Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee approved the study. All volun-
teers participated in cold-stimulated PET-CT scanning and main metabolic
study. Twelve of the volunteers and an additional three BAT-negative volun-
teers also underwent overnight continuous glucose and BAT thermogenic
monitoring.
Cold-Stimulated PET/CT Study
This study quantifies BAT abundance and allows assessment of relationship
between metabolic profile and BAT status. Volunteers were studied after
6 hr of fasting. Each was exposed to 2 hr of personalized cooling to elicit
maximal nonshivering thermogenesis response. All volunteers received a 50
MBq dose of 18Fluro-deoxyglucose (FDG) for PET/CT scanning. In the circa-
dian study, volunteers were stratified into those with high (BAThigh) and low
(BATlow) BAT status based on midrange BAT activity within the whole group
(Table S2). Further details on personalized cooling and PET/CT analysis are
described in Supplemental Information.
Main Metabolic Test
Volunteers attended on a separate date after an overnight fast to undergo
metabolic testing at thermoneutrality (24�C). Twenty minutes of resting energy
expenditure (EE) measurement was obtained by indirect calorimetry as
baseline, after which volunteers were given 75 g of glucose (Carbotest) in a
standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). EE measurement continued
throughout this period at 20 min interval for 2 hr. Supraclavicular temperature
response (STR) was measured by iButtons (Maxim, San Jose, CA), as previ-
ously described (Lee et al., 2014a), and subcutaneous glucose levels by
Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). Fifteen volunteers
wore iButtons and Dexcom for a continuous 12 hr period to study circadian
BAT and glucose rhythms.
Laboratory Measurements
Blood samples were obtained during OGTT at �20, 0, 10, 20, 30, 60 90, and
120 min for hormone/substrate measurements. Plasma glucose was deter-
mined by the glucose oxidase method using a YSI glucose analyzer (model
2300 STAT PLUS 230V, YSI, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Prandial hormones
were measured by commercially available immunoassays.
In Vitro Studies
Primary Adipocyte/Adipose Explant Culture
Primary adipocyte/explant cultures were established from 21 patients
(12 women, 51 ± 12 years old, BMI 25 ± 3 kg/m2) undergoing elective neck
surgery (Graves’ disease, multinodular goitre, thyroid adenoma/cancer). All
patients were biochemically euthyroid.
Circadian Study
Serum synchronization was performed by incubating differentiated adipocytes
with 50% horse serum for 2 hr. After PBS washes, cells were incubated in
basal media supplemented with 0.5% FCS with/without 20 nM insulin or

specified time points corresponding to Zeitgeber time (ZT) 16, 22, 4, and 10, with 6 a.m. as ZT = 0 (A). Transcripts of UCP1 and GLUT4 mRNA showed significant
rhythmicity reciprocating the trend of Rev-erba (C). Data are presented as mean ± SD.

 1 mM propranolol, followed by RNA/protein extraction and glucose uptake
analysis at designated time points, as previously described (Yamamoto
et al., 2011).
Gene/Protein Expression and Bioenergetics
Standard techniques were used for RNA/protein extraction and analysis
by semiquantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting. Cellular respiration
was measured by XF24-3 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience)
and heat production by infrared thermography (FLIR systems).

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Comparisons between results during
cold exposure/OGTT were performed using repeated-measure ANOVA with
Bonferroni’s correction. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparison between
volunteers stratified to BAT status. Pearson and Spearman correlation coeffi-
cients were computed to examine relations between parametric and nonpara-
metric variables, respectively. Areas under the curve were calculated using the
trapezoidal rule. Circadian rhythm analysis was performed by fitting of a cosine
function to data. Details on mathematical modeling are available in Supple-
mental Information. An a error of 0.05 was considered the threshold for statis-
tical significance.
