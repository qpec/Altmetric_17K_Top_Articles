Abstract
Background: Digital self-help interventions (including online or computerized programs and apps) for common mental health
issues have been shown to be appealing, engaging, and efficacious in randomized controlled trials. They show potential for
improving access to therapy and improving population mental health. However, their use in the real world, ie, as implemented
(disseminated) outside of research settings, may differ from that reported in trials, and implementation data are seldom reported.
Objective: This study aimed to review peer-reviewed articles reporting user uptake and/or ongoing use, retention, or completion
data (hereafter usage data or, for brevity, engagement) from implemented pure self-help (unguided) digital interventions for
depression, anxiety, or the enhancement of mood.
Methods: We conducted a systematic search of the Scopus, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO databases for studies reporting
user uptake and/or usage data from implemented digital self-help interventions for the treatment or prevention of depression or
anxiety, or the enhancement of mood, from 2002 to 2017. Additionally, we screened the reference lists of included articles,
citations of these articles, and the titles of articles published in Internet Interventions, Journal of Medical Internet Research
(JMIR), and JMIR Mental Health since their inception. We extracted data indicating the number of registrations or downloads
and usage of interventions.
Results: After the removal of duplicates, 970 papers were identified, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria. Hand searching
identified 1 additional article. The included articles reported on 7 publicly available interventions. There was little consistency
in the measures reported. The number of registrants or downloads ranged widely, from 8 to over 40,000 per month. From 21%
to 88% of users engaged in at least minimal use (eg, used the intervention at least once or completed one module or assessment),
whereas 7-42% engaged in moderate use (completing between 40% and 60% of modular fixed-length programs or continuing to
use apps after 4 weeks). Indications of completion or sustained use (completion of all modules or the last assessment or continuing
to use apps after six weeks or more) varied from 0.5% to 28.6%.
Conclusions: Available data suggest that uptake and engagement vary widely among the handful of implemented digital self-help
apps and programs that have reported this, and that usage may vary from that reported in trials. Implementation data should be
routinely gathered and reported to facilitate improved uptake and engagement, arguably among the major challenges in digital
health.

Introduction
Background
Digital interventions (including online or computerized programs
or apps) have been shown to be efficacious for depression and
anxiety [1-4] and they provide the opportunity to extend
psychological therapy to people who might otherwise not receive
it [3-5]. Adherence to digital interventions is important for
therapeutic gains [3,6] and is generally satisfactory relative to
face-to-face interventions [7]. Self-help interventions, provided
without guidance or personal support, might reach users who
are unable or unwilling to seek help and may be scaled up at
lower cost than interventions involving assistance [4,5].
Adherence to self-help is generally lower than that to guided
interventions [8], although approaches such as persuasive design
and telepresence may enhance retention [5,9] and advantages
such as scalability mean that self-help remains worthy of
attention.
Interventions may have poorer outcomes when implemented in
community or clinical settings than they do in research trials
[10-12]. Proven interventions can fail in the real world because
translation from research trials may involve changes in the
conditions under which the original results were obtained
[10,11]. For instance, trials may exclude participants with
complex issues, and trial participants may have additional
motivations to complete interventions, such as to please
researchers or to help others. Trial participants might also benefit
from assessment effects or face-to-face contacts that are
independent of the intervention [10]. Digital technology is
evolving rapidly; hence, digital interventions that are not updated
or refined following trials are at risk of becoming dated and,
consequently, less appealing by the time they are available
outside of research settings [13]. For these reasons, it is
important to examine the use of digital interventions in
real-world settings. Examining self-help interventions in
isolation provides the opportunity to highlight differences
between individual interventions of this type.
Objectives
In this study, we aimed to systematically review peer-reviewed
articles reporting user uptake (eg, number of users, registrations,
or downloads) and/or ongoing use, adherence, retention, or
completion data (hereafter usage data or, for brevity,
engagement) from implemented digital self-help interventions
for the prevention or treatment of anxiety or depression, or for
the enhancement of mood. We note that aspects of engagement
other than usage data (eg, emotional involvement) are important
[14-16]. However usage data are widely reported, are important
for efficacy [6,7], and are the focus here. We identified no prior
systematic reviews on this topic.
Methods
Search Strategy
Electronic searches were conducted of the Scopus, Embase,
MEDLINE, and PsychINFO databases. The following search
terms were used in Scopus, and the equivalent search was
repeated on the Ovid Embase, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO
databases:
( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( implementation OR “real world” OR
real-world OR naturalistic OR observational OR “open access”
OR public OR “publicly available” OR “publically available”
OR deployment OR community OR nationwide OR national
OR regist* OR dissemination ) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (
computerized PRE/5 therap* ) OR etherap* OR e-therap* OR
( online PRE/5 intervention* ) OR ( online PRE/5 treatment* )
OR ( internet PRE/5 intervention* ) OR ( website PRE/5
intervention* ) OR ( web-based PRE/5 intervention* ) OR (
web-based PRE/5 treatment* ) OR “smartphone app*” OR
“mobile app*” OR “smartphone intervention*” OR “smartphone
program*” OR “mobile program*” OR “mobile intervention*”
OR mhealth OR mtherapy ) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (
depression OR anxiety OR mood OR “mental health” OR
“psychological wellbeing” ) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY ( uptake
OR adopt* OR regist* OR enrol* OR recruit* OR logon OR
“logged on” OR usage OR adherence OR compliance OR
complet* OR attrition OR “drop out” OR dropout OR drop-out
) ).
The search strategy was developed in partnership with a
specialist research librarian. The search of the Ovid databases
included “mp” (“multi-purpose”), thus incorporated all subject
headings in which one or more word(s) matched the search term.
The following journals were hand-searched from their inception
(all post 2002) up to and including their February 2017 issue:
Internet Interventions, Journal of Medical Internet Research
(JMIR), and JMIR Mental Health. Finally, a hand search was
conducted of the included studies’ reference lists, and the titles
of articles that had cited the included papers.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Articles were included in the review if they:
•
were digital (computerized or online programs or apps)
self-help/unguided interventions explicitly described as
being for the prevention or treatment of depression or
anxiety, or for the enhancement or improvement of mood;
•
reported data on user uptake (eg, number of users,
registrations, or downloads) and/or usage, adherence, or
attrition (eg, number or percentage of users beginning,
completing, or partially completing the intervention, or
using the intervention for a specified period of time);
•
reported implementation (dissemination/observational) data;
and
•
were published in the peer-reviewed literature between
January 1, 2002, and March 8, 2017.

 Articles were excluded if they:
•
were pilot, exploratory, or feasibility studies; randomized
controlled trials (RCTs); or protocol papers;
•
were studies in which users were subject to assessments for
research purposes, over and above what would normally
be embedded in the intervention (ie, interventions could be
included if routinely administered assessments were
embedded as part of the self-help tool, but were excluded
if users were subject to face-to-face or additional
assessments for research purposes);
•
reported findings from supported digital interventions (ie,
supported by a therapist or where other human support was
provided) or interventions that utilized a moderator or that
were blended (eg, an adjunct to face-to-face therapy); and/or
•
were not available in English.
Study Selection
Two authors (TF and LB) independently screened all retrieved
titles, and then read the abstracts of all potentially relevant
articles. Articles identified by one or both screening author(s)
as potentially relevant were reviewed in full text. For each article
excluded at the full-text review, the main reason for exclusion
was recorded.
Data Extraction
The characteristics of all the included articles were coded by 2
of the 3 authors (LB, KS, and SH) and checked by 1 author
(ML). The authors utilized a data extraction template that was
developed for this systematic review and piloted on 2 of the
full-text articles. Any discrepancies were resolved by referring
to the original article and via discussion. The following
characteristics and data were extracted:
•
article reference details and data collection period;
•
intervention characteristics: name of the intervention,
intervention type (eg, online program, computerized
program such as CD-ROM, smartphone app), condition
treated, therapeutic modality, intervention length, features
of gamification and navigation, and whether previously
trialled and reported in the peer-reviewed literature;
•
number of persons registering for or downloading the
intervention;
•
registration rate (the percentage of visitors to the
intervention’s Website who then registered for the
intervention), where data allowed;
•
indicators of at least minimal use, such as number or
percentage of users who began or used the intervention at
least once or, where those data were not reported, number
or percentage of users who completed at least one module
or one assessment;
•
indicators of moderate use (ie, more than at least minimal
use but less than completion or sustained use), such as
number or percentage of users completing a specified
number or proportion of modules, or number of logins, or
use for a specific period of time; and
•
indicators of completion or sustained use, the number or
percentage of users completing the intervention or, where
no end-point was specified, the number or percentage using
it for at least 6 weeks. Where neither of these were
specified, the number or percentage of users who completed
a final assessment or assessment at 6 weeks or more was
recorded.
Results
Study Selection
The database search yielded 1701 records, of which 970
remained after the removal of duplicates as shown in Figure 1.
The initial title screening excluded 771 records, and the abstract
screening excluded a further 158 records. The full texts of the
remaining 41 articles were reviewed, of which 10 passed the
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Several papers required detailed
consideration. A paper by Al-Asadi and colleagues [17] was
excluded because it was not possible to separate data for those
persons who selected therapist-assisted self-help from those
who selected pure self-help. Another paper by Al-Asadi and
colleagues [18] was included because results for those receiving
pure self-help were provided. A paper by Menzies and
colleagues [19] was included, despite being described as a trial,
because the intervention was available online without referral,
no researcher contact was involved, no assessments beyond
those routinely included in the intervention were used, and there
was no randomization. An intervention for posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) [20] was included as PTSD was classified as
an anxiety disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,
Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [21], during most
of our review period (ie, 2002-2017), although it was reclassified
in the fifth edition of the DSM, issued in 2013 [22]. The
hand-searching process identified one additional article [23]
(Happify) for inclusion in the systematic review, bringing the
total of eligible articles to 11.
Study and Program Characteristics
The 11 articles reported implementation data from 7 different
interventions. Five articles reported on the original (ie, Mark I)
or updated (ie, Mark II) version of the MoodGYM program
[24-28], and the remaining 6 each described a unique
intervention [18-20,23,29,30].
Study and program characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
All of the included interventions were available without referral
and were free to the user, apart from one that offered purchases
or subscription for some content [23]. All were described as
based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or utilizing CBT
among other therapeutic modalities (eg, positive psychology),
apart from one that did not specify the modality used [18]. Four
interventions were online programs of fixed length, using
sequential navigation (where content is provided in a specific
order), or a choice of sequential or open navigation. The
remaining 3 interventions were available via smartphone as an
app [20], a suite of apps [30], or could be accessed as an app or
online [23]. These app-based interventions (hereafter apps) had
no fixed length and used open navigation. Notably, the articles
reporting on apps were all relatively recent (ie, from 2015 to
2016).

 Figure 1. Flow diagram of article selection.
The efficacy of one program (MoodGYM) has been empirically
supported through RCTs [25,31,32]. For 3 interventions there
was some evidence: a small, exploratory pre-post trial found
beneficial effects for CBTPsych [33]; a single-arm trial, which
included coaching, showed significant therapeutic improvements
for users of Intellicare apps [30]; and, for PTSD Coach, there
was both a pilot RCT reporting modest, nonsignificant effects
[34] and a subsequent RCT reporting significant therapeutic
effects at post-treatment [35]. At the time of writing, we found
no published studies examining the efficacy of 3 interventions:
Anxiety Online, Happify, and HDep.
Uptake and Usage Data
User uptake (registrations or downloads) and usage data for
each intervention are summarized in Table 2.
The number of registrations or downloads were reported in 8
papers. The remaining 3 studies reported related indicators as
shown in Table 2. Registrations or downloads varied markedly
from an average of 8 to at least 40,053 per month. Across the
7 interventions (and using the Mark II community user
registration rate for the MoodGYM program), the median
number of registrations or downloads was 401 per month, and
the mean when excluding the lower and upper outliers was 2098
per month. There were 3 interventions with thousands of
downloads or registrants per month, including 2 of the 3 apps,
PTSD Coach, and Happify [20,23], and 1 of the 4 online
programs, MoodGYM Mark II [27].
In Table 2, for MoodGYM, the number of assessments
completed is likely to be similar to the number of modules
completed, but not interchangeable. Assessments are completed
at the beginning of a module and some users may not complete

 modules that they commence. Furthermore, for the Mark I
version, assessments were not compulsory (a module could be
completed without doing the assessment associated with that
module); therefore, users may have skipped assessments.
Just 1 study, which was of MoodGYM Mark II [27], reported
both the number of website visitors and the number of
registrations, allowing the calculation of a registration rate,
which was 42.2%.
Available measures indicating at least minimal use were limited
and varied widely as shown in Table 2, making direct
comparisons challenging. Within these limitations, CBTPsych
[19] had the highest percentage of registrants engaging in at
least minimal use, although given the low number of
registrations per month, this was very few individuals.
Next, we reviewed indicators of moderate use. Again, there was
little consistency in available data. Of the online programs: up
to 16% of MoodGYM users completed 2 or more modules or
assessments (embedded within the modules) out of 5 [24-28];
10% of HDep users completed module 4 of this 7-module
program (although they could miss individual modules) [29];
and 39% of CBTPsych users completed at least 4 of the 7
modules [19]. The apps or blended interventions reported quite
different measures. Over 40% of PTSD Coach users continued
to use it a month after installation [20]. For Happify, 20.6% of
those who had completed an initial assessment also completed
a noncompulsory assessment 2 weeks later, and 7.2% completed
an assessment at 4 weeks [23]. The study of Intellicare apps
described those who used each app 10 or more times as “active
users.” This group comprised 4.7% to 35.7% of users for each
app [30].

aThe timeframe covered in this study is a subset of that reported by Christensen et al [25] for the same intervention, but the 2002 study reports some
data that are not reported in the 2004 study.
bThe timeframe reported in this study is a subset of that reported by Neil et al [28] for the same intervention. However, this study reports data for all
registrants, whereas Neil et al’s [28] study only reports data for adolescent users.
cPersons (n=9394) completed an online assessment and were then offered an online self-help or therapist-assisted program. No other indications of
registration are reported.
dPersons (n=3107) selected and commenced an online self-help program; they did not formally withdraw and were not recorded as “in progress” at the
time of the publication.
eNo other registration data were reported.
fAssessments were not compulsory.
Only 2 studies directly reported intervention completion rates.
In these cases, 2.8% of MoodGYM users completed all 5
modules [28] and 19.5% of CBTPsych users completed the
program [19]. Looking at other indicators of sustained use for
the online programs, 0.5% of MoodGYM Mark I users
completed a noncompulsory assessment in the final module
[25]. In total, 3.7% of Anxiety Online users who had completed
an initial assessment and were offered a self-help online
intervention also completed a post-treatment assessment [18];
however, these users may or may not have been utilizing the
treatment. There were no specific completion data reported for
the apps. However, 19.4% of PTSD Coach users continued to
use the app after 6 months [20] and 3.5% of Happify users
completed a 6-week assessment [23], although again, these users
may have completed assessments without engaging in other
content.
Combining completion or sustained use data with the number
of people beginning each intervention (uptake), as reported here,
suggests that fewer than 40 persons per month completed final
assessments or final modules for any of the online modular
programs during the study periods. In contrast, over 800 users
completed the Happify app assessments at 8 weeks [23], and
over 1000 persons per month demonstrated continued use of
PTSD Coach after 3 months [20].
Discussion
Summary of Evidence
For digital mental health interventions to have a population-level
impact, significant numbers of people must receive beneficial
doses. This requires both sufficient uptake and ongoing use of
effective interventions. Despite over 10,000 digital mental health
interventions being publicly available in 2017 [36], we identified
only 11 peer-reviewed publications reporting uptake and/or
usage data from publicly available digital self-help interventions
for depression, anxiety, or low mood. This is disappointing,
given 3 considerations. First, people may use interventions
differently in the real world, as compared with trial conditions.
Second, digital interventions allow relative ease of data
collection through automation. Third, comparisons of uptake
and usage across interventions could inform improvements in
the field. Where data have been reported, diverse measures were
used, making direct comparisons challenging. Nevertheless,
large differences are apparent. The widest-reaching intervention
in our review had tens of thousands of new users per month,
whereas the least used one had fewer than ten. Moreover,
ongoing use ranged from less than 1% to over 28% of users
completing interventions or demonstrating sustained use.
The findings suggest that people may use digital mental health
interventions differently in real-world settings, as compared
with trial conditions. Although this may be true for many
interventions, the phenomenon is easily quantifiable in digital
interventions through embedded routine data collection.
Completion rates, as reported in included studies, are lower than
the completion rates of 43% to 99% in a systematic review of
adherence in controlled trials of online interventions for
depression and anxiety [7]. Direct comparisons between research
trials and implementation usage data for the same intervention
also suggest reduced adherence in real-world settings. For
example, only 0.5% of community users (ie, users of MoodGYM
as publicly implemented and freely available online) of
MoodGYM completed a noncompulsory final assessment,
compared with 22.5% of participants in a trial evaluating the
same program [31]. Similarly, in the community, adolescent
users of MoodGYM completed an average of 3.1 exercises,
compared with an average of 9.4 exercises among adolescents
in a school-based trial [28].

 Textbox 1. Recommended reporting of real-world implementation data.
The following data should be reported from implemented digital mental health interventions:
•
total number of registrants or downloads over a specified time period
•
the characteristics (such as demographic details) of registrants and users where available
•
the number of modules/levels or activities that can be completed and that are completed by users
•
number of times the intervention has been accessed and/or the amount of time the user logged on
•
the number or percentage of persons completing a “therapeutic dose” of the intervention
•
clinical change or effectiveness measures as well as number or percentage of users with clinically significant improvements and deteriorations.
Previous studies have highlighted differences in adherence
between guided and unguided self-help interventions [8]. Given
the limited, heterogeneous data, we did not conduct
meta-analyses or test for differences between interventions.
However, on the face of it, a long established program
(MoodGYM released in 2001) [24] and 2 of the recently tested
app-based interventions (PTSD Coach [20] and Happify [23])
appear particularly promising in terms of uptake. Two
interventions reported high sustained use. The first was
CBTPsych [19], the 7-module online CBT program for
addressing social anxiety among stutterers. Very few people
used this, but retention was high. Second, a very different
intervention, PTSD coach (available as an app, with no fixed
length and an open navigation structure), had high sustained
use [20]. Over 10 times as many people engaged in sustained
use of apps as completed any of the online modular programs.
An issue for consideration is that of what is a beneficial dose
at a population level. The dose or amount of exposure to digital
mental health interventions for clinically significant effects has
been considered in previous research, with greater adherence
generally associated with greater clinical gains [6,7,9]. Included
studies show that large numbers of people accessed some mental
health interventions for brief periods. Relatively brief use might
have a significant population impact if this exposes large
numbers of people to ideas such as depression being common,
there being a range of ways to address it, and help being
available. Future research should consider this.
Perhaps, the strongest implication from this study is that future
research should report intervention uptake, ongoing use, and
impact in real-world settings. Transparent reporting of key data,
such as those as shown in Textbox 1, would facilitate
comparisons. Alongside these data, reporting of intervention
characteristics, 
modes 
of 
delivery, 
and 
features 
of
implementation such as marketing and methods of dissemination
would provide opportunities for understanding which
interventions, applied in which ways, engage and retain users.
Strengths and Limitations
This review examined data from peer-reviewed articles. We did
not examine grey literature or request data from providers of
interventions or Internet service providers due to resource
constraints. Further research should explore this. There is a risk
of publication bias, given that interventions with poor results
may not be reported. A meta-analysis was not conducted due
to the small number of published studies and the heterogeneity
of data. However, with increased data and more consistent
reporting, a meta-analysis would be a valuable future addition
to the literature. We set inclusion and exclusion criteria to focus
on interventions addressing the very common issues of
depression, anxiety, and low mood. We included an intervention
targeting PTSD. PTSD was included as an anxiety disorder in
the edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual/DSM-IV-TR
[21], which was in use at the start of our review period
(2002-2017), but not in the fifth edition, issued in 2013 [22].
Others might have made different decisions; however, we have
endeavored to be transparent in this. These limitations
notwithstanding, this is the first systematic review of
implementation data in this area, and it highlights valuable
opportunities for development.
Conclusion
Digital self-help interventions targeting depression, anxiety, or
the enhancement of mood have the potential to improve
population-level mental health in a highly scalable manner.
However, for these interventions to achieve meaningful impact,
they need to have adequate uptake and adherence in real-world
settings. Only a handful of interventions have reported this
information in the peer-reviewed literature to date, and these
utilized diverse measures. Nevertheless, the published studies
of unguided self-help interventions for anxiety, depression, and
mood demonstrate large differences in uptake and engagement
between 
interventions. 
Organizations 
delivering 
these
interventions should take advantage of the opportunity to gather
and publish data. Much of the data collection on intervention
usage can be automated, making such collection and subsequent
reporting generally easy and low-cost. We have proposed key
metrics that should be considered. Transparent, comparable,
and timely publication of real-world data would allow
between-program 
comparisons 
and 
hence 
facilitate
improvements in user uptake and engagement, arguably 2 of
the major challenges in the digital health world.
