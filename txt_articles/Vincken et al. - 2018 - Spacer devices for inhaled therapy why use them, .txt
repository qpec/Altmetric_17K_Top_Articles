ABSTRACT
We present an extensive review of the literature to date pertaining to the rationale for using
a spacer/valved holding chamber (VHC) to deliver inhaled therapy from a pressurised, metered-dose
inhaler, a discussion of how the properties of individual devices may vary according to their physical
characteristics and materials of manufacture, the potential risks and benefits of ancillaries such as valves,
and the evidence that they contribute tangibly to the delivery of therapy.
We also reiterate practical recommendations for the correct usage and maintenance of spacers/VHCs,
which we trust offer practical help and advice to patients and healthcare professionals alike.

REVIEW
ASTHMA AND COPD
 Introduction
Development of the pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) in the mid-1950s paved the way for
widespread, personalised delivery of topical inhaled therapy for the pharmacological management of
obstructive airways diseases (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), which has since
proved its worth in terms of benefit/risk ratio and tolerability. An important weakness of pMDI devices,
however, is their propensity to be used suboptimally or incorrectly [1], a problem that has been recognised
since their inception and that is unfortunately still prevalent today. Incorrect pMDI usage may have
knock-on effects on efficacy, safety and patient compliance.
Maximising airway deposition of a pMDI-delivered drug requires a slow (30 L·min−1), deep inhalation
commencing immediately after pMDI activation followed by a breath-hold pause of ⩾4 s and optimally up
to 10 s [2]. Even with optimal technique and modern hydrofluoroalkane propellants, however, pMDIs
deliver, at best, only ∼20% of the emitted dose to the lower airways, leaving ∼80% in the oropharynx [2].
With suboptimal or incorrect technique, this fraction is further reduced, potentially to zero.
The concept of activating the pMDI into a spacer (an additional reservoir placed between the mouthpiece
of the pMDI and the mouth of the patient) or a valved holding chamber (VHC) (a reservoir with a
one-way valve permitting airflow into, but not out of, the patient’s mouth) prior to inhalation was
developed in the 1950s [3, 4] to address some, but not all, of the problems and potentially critical errors
when using a pMDI. Use of a spacer/VHC slows down the aerosolised particles emitted from the pMDI,
which may further increase lung deposition of the respirable fine particles, although the clinical
significance of this effect is not well established. It certainly significantly filters out and thereby reduces
oropharyngeal deposition of the larger particles emitted from a pMDI, even with “perfect” technique [5].
The correct use of a spacer/VHC negotiates with the common and potentially critical problem of poor
coordination of activation of the pMDI with commencement of inhalation [1]. Although some synchrony
of activation of the pMDI with inhalation is still desirable when using a spacer/VHC, the patient has a lot
more time to accomplish this effectively. Breath-activated pMDIs are also available for the delivery of some
inhaled drugs and these may also assist with poor coordination, but do not deliver all of the potential
advantages of a spacer/VHC. No inhaler device can fully obviate the propensity for patients to breathe in
too quickly (although some more recent devices warn patients of this using a whistle activated above a
flow threshold, while another device whistles if used correctly) or to fail to hold their breath following
inhalation. In the late 1970s, larger VHCs were developed with the additional intention of creating a
reservoir for the aerosolised particles, enabling their administration by tidal breathing [4].
All patients using a pMDI to take inhaled medications should be advised to use a spacer/VHC for both
regular and emergency medications, and in particular those patients who are poor at coordinating
activation of the pMDI with inhalation. This includes children using a pMDI (using a face mask below the
age of 3 years) [6], the elderly and infirm, and those with compromised comprehension or manual
dexterity [7]. Such patients can be given their medication by their family members or care givers using the
pMDI–spacer/VHC combination.
Extensive studies have shown that in situations where emergency administration of a bronchodilator is
indicated for an acute exacerbation of COPD or asthma in both children and adults, the use of a pMDI
with a spacer/VHC is at least as effective and safe as nebulised therapy [8–11], and may indeed reduce
emergency room waiting times and systemic unwanted effects of bronchodilator therapy. Compared with
nebulised therapy, it is also cheaper, more convenient, portable and relatively maintenance free [12].
Despite recommendations in national and international guidelines that pMDIs should be used with a
spacer/VHC [13], they appear to be widely underused: previous estimates vary from 10% in the UK in
1990 to 46% in Canada in 2008 [14]. In a cross-sectional survey of patients with asthma or COPD
presenting to the emergency department in the USA, fewer than half of those using a pMDI owned a
spacer/VHC and only half of these had used it on the day of presentation [15]. Having a primary care
physician and a history of prior hospitalisation for asthma or COPD were factors independently associated
with spacer/VHC ownership. The likelihood of spacer/VHC usage also appears to vary with the type of
obstructive lung disease: in a study in New Zealand, 40% of COPD patients used a spacer/VHC as
compared with only 15% of asthma patients [16].
The aim of this article is to provide, for patients and healthcare professionals, an overview of the
advantages and potential disadvantages of spacers/VHCs, describe the situations in which a spacer/VHC is
most likely to be useful and indicated, and address practical issues such as correct handling, priming and
maintenance. We trust that it may help promoting regular and reliable usage and maintenance of spacers/
VHCs. Based on extensive scrutiny of the published literature and, where evidence is lacking, the
consensus amongst the ADMIT members, this paper adds to and complements previous reviews [14, 17–21],

 and in particular the report of the joint Task Force of the European Respiratory Society and the
International Society for Aerosols in Medicine [20].
Choosing a spacer
Not all spacers are equal: performance may vary according to their size/volume, shape, material of
manufacture and propensity to become electrostatically charged, their mode of interface with the patient,
and the presence or otherwise of valves and feedback devices (table 1).
Size
Small-volume spacers (up to 100 mL) usually are nonvalved, tube-like extensions of the mouthpiece of the
pMDI. They are least cumbersome but also least likely to obviate the need for additional coordination
between actuation of the pMDI and commencement of inhalation on the part of the patient.
Medium- (100–350 mL) and large-volume (>700 mL) spacers usually incorporate a unidirectional valve at
their mouthpiece end, allowing inhalation from, but not exhalation into, the spacer. These devices are
therefore called VHCs and allow more leeway in the time in which the patient has to commence
inhalation after activating the pMDI or allowing delivery by tidal breathing. They are more cumbersome
and less portable. Theoretical considerations suggest that a spacer/VHC should ideally be 100–700 mL in
volume, and should provide a distance of ⩾10 cm between the pMDI and the patient’s mouth [22].
Why else may volume of the spacer/VHC be important? For one thing, it determines the number of
breaths necessary to empty it, which is important in small children (generating tidal breaths of 10 mL·kg−1
body weight). Spacer/VHC size does not affect fine particle fraction [23] but may influence the aerosol
profile and thereby the variability of the particle content of the emitted dosage with time during inhalation
[24, 25]. In a large-volume spacer/VHC, the particle cloud becomes static prior to inhalation, providing
evenly distributed delivery of the aerosol throughout the inhalation. In a small-volume spacer, the particle
cloud remains turbulent and may deliver an initial “burst” of concentrated aerosol followed by
comparatively aerosol-free air. Thus, while the delivery of all of the particles from a single pMDI actuation
is more vulnerable to reduction by insubstantial inhalation using a large-volume, as compared with a
small-volume, spacer/VHC [26], a large-volume device may target the entire bronchial tree in a more
uniform fashion [24].
Valves
Valveless, open-tube spacers simply distance the pMDI from the patient’s oropharynx. VHCs, which
contain a low-resistance, one-way valve situated behind the mouthpiece, retain the aerosol within the
device until the patient inhales and prevent exhaled breath from re-entering the VHC. This allows the
VHC to be used with tidal breathing as well as with a single, deep inspiration. A significant proportion (15
out of 80 in the quoted study) of very young children (<24 months of age) is unable to generate sufficient
(subatmospheric) inspiratory pressure to open the unidirectional valve of various commercially available
VHCs [27]. This ability should be examined before they are prescribed. Valves may become jammed if
soiled or damaged, a problem easily detected and possibly solved by cleaning or replacement of the device,
provided that the patient is aware.
Material of manufacture
Plastic/polycarbonate/polymer spacers/VHCs do not conduct electricity and are therefore susceptible to
electrostatic charging of their inner surface [18]. Electrostatic charge attracts aerosol particles, which may
considerably (by up to 50%) reduce the aerosol dosage available for inhalation. Although electrostatic
charge can be reduced and lung deposition of aerosol correspondingly improved by priming the spacer/VHC

 with multiple dosages from a pMDI, this is wasteful of medication; similar effects accrue, to an extent,
with repeated use of the device and by rinsing it in soapy water (see later) [28–30]. In order to minimise
re-accumulation of electrostatic charge after cleaning and washing, nonconducting spacers should be
drip-dried, avoiding rubbing or wiping of the inner surface.
Metallic (steel or aluminium) spacers/VHCs and some plastic spacers/VHCs with an antistatic inner lining
(made of electrostatic charge-dissipative material) do not need priming since they are conducting and do
not accumulate electrostatic charge. As a result, fine-particle mass and lung deposition of aerosolised drug
is increased [7, 29, 31, 32] and may theoretically enable dosage reduction, but this is not guaranteed [33],
while possibly increasing systemic exposure [34].
Interface with the patient
Spacers/VHCs with a facemask rather than a mouthpiece may be preferable for children <3 years of age
[35] and for all patients incapable, for any reason, of making a slow, measured inspiratory effort while
holding a mouthpiece between the teeth. Children over the age of 3 years often continue to use facemasks
and, if so, technique should always be checked as spacers/VHCs with facemasks designed for use with
small children may provide a poor seal with the face, resulting in impaired or variable dosage delivery
[36]. A tight (but comfortable) mask-to-face seal using sufficient force is important but may be difficult to
achieve in young or uncooperative patients [37–39]. When using a facemask, the dead space between the
mouth and valve of the spacer/VHC should be minimised. Besides facial seal and dead space, other design
considerations for an optimal mask for young children and infants include contour, flexibility,
transparency, weight and cost [40].
Feedback devices and mechanisms
Some spacers are provided with a whistle that sounds if the patient inhales too quickly. It should be made
clear to the patient that the whistle is not intended to sound. Conversely, at least one spacer is now
available with a facemask designed for young children that whistles when the correct breathing technique
has been mastered and the fit is correct, reassuring healthcare providers and parents that medication is
being delivered.
pMDI-specific versus universally adaptable spacers/VHCs
It is important that the pMDI fits tightly into the spacer/VHC. Some spacers/VHCs are provided with a
soft rubber inlet that accepts pMDIs of various sizes. When using a non-dedicated pMDI–spacer/VHC
combination, it is important to verify that the spray exiting the pMDI remains directed into the centre of
the spacer/VHC. Other spacers/VHCs are designed for specific pMDIs and will not accept any others. If
the mouthpiece of the pMDI is larger than the inlet on the spacer/VHC, the combination is obviously not
suitable. When the mouthpiece is smaller than the inlet, tape is sometimes used to effect a seal but we
would suggest that this is inadvisable because such practice does not guarantee that the aerosol plume is
directed into the centre of the spacer/VHC.
Assessing the potential impact of spacers/VHCs on drug delivery
The use of a spacer/VHC is one link in the chain of processes necessary to establish an optimal
outcome when pMDIs are used for therapy, namely that the maximal quantity of the respirable
aerosol fraction (particles with an aerodynamic diameter ⩽5 µm) is delivered regularly to the airways
rather than elsewhere. Assessing the contribution of this particular link to the overall management
and clinical outcomes of patients with obstructive airway disease in the “real world” is a considerable
challenge.
With regard to studies addressing the intrinsic efficacy of spacers/VHCs, most are in vitro studies using
filters and/or cascade impactors to estimate how the spacer/VHC affects the respirable or fine-particle
fraction of the dose emitted from the pMDI. Some studies are refined by “models” of the human
oropharynx and airways. Using such approaches, available evidence would suggest that the use of a spacer/
VHC of any reasonable construction and design (including disposable devices [41] and homemade, ad hoc
devices such as bottomless plastic bottles and toilet paper rolls) significantly reduces the large-particle
fraction (that likely to impact in the mouth and throat) and maximises the fine-particle fraction delivered
to the airways from a pMDI, although the degree of this effect varies with the device [42, 43] and the
fine-particle fraction may represent a lower fraction of the total dosage than when a spacer/VHC is not
used at all [23, 44–54]. Some studies suggest no more than a marginal effect of specific spacers/VHCs on
the fine-particle fraction output [55, 56]. Reduction of oropharyngeal deposition of particles likely
minimises local/topical unwanted effects (hoarseness or oral thrush) but may increase systemic absorption
of the drug [57]. There are few substantial studies that estimate the magnitude and clinical impact of these
https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00065-2018

 effects in real life [58]: most of these address the effects of spacers/VHCs on the bronchodilatation
produced by short-acting β-agonists (and do suggest a measurable effect, even in patients with good pMDI
technique) [50, 59], although some address the effects of inhaled corticosteroids. Devices made of
antistatic materials further increase the delivery of the respirable particle fraction [46, 51, 52, 60], although
again the effects are sometimes marginal [55, 56, 61], and the clinical consequences of this for real-life
disease control are unclear.
Finally, when considering real-life outcomes of using spacers/VHCs, it is clear that many other influences
may potentially affect these, including the precise pMDI–spacer/VHC combination being used, spacer/
VHC priming and maintenance, aspects of inhaler technique uninfluenced by spacers/VHCs, and the
compliance of the patient with spacer/VHC usage and prescribed therapy in general [26, 62–66].
The hitherto discussed potential advantages and disadvantages of using a spacer/VHC are summarised in
table 2.
Recommendations on how to use a spacer/VHC properly
While the fine details of the usage of individual devices may vary, a number of universal and important
principles emerging from the literature form the basis of the following recommendations.
Recommendations
1)
Sit or stand up straight with the chin up and the neck slightly extended.
2)
Shake the pMDI five times and remove its cap.
3)
If using a valved spacer, shake it to check that the valve(s) is not stuck.
4)
Hold the pMDI upright (with the canister up) and fit it into the spacer/VHC. Hold the
pMDI–spacer/VHC assembly horizontal, with one hand holding the pMDI between the index finger
and thumb, and the other hand supporting the mouthpiece end of the spacer/VHC.
5)
Breathe out as far as is comfortable.
6)
Place the spacer/VHC mouthpiece between the teeth and seal the lips around it (or place the mask
gently but tightly over the nose and lips).
7)
Breathe in slowly, immediately press the inhaler once and continue to breathe in slowly (over 4–5 s)
until the lungs are full.
8)
Hold the breath for 10 s or for as long as is comfortable. While breath holding, take the spacer/VHC
out of the mouth (or lower the mask) and relax.
9)
When further doses are required, the entire sequence must be repeated for each additional dose,
including shaking the pMDI if necessary. Multiple doses should never be fired together into the
spacer/VHC and be inhaled with a single breath.
10) When the session is ended, take the pMDI out of the spacer/VHC port, place the cap back on the
pMDI, and rinse the mouth and gargle after inhalation of a corticosteroid.

 Notes on the recommendations
• It is important that there is little or no delay between activating the pMDI and breathing in through the
spacer/VHC. While slowing of the aerosol allows evaporation of the particles and increases the
respirable particle fraction, too long a delay in breathing in (⩾10 s) significantly reduces it [46, 66–69].
Activating the pMDI before inhaling or during expiration may further reduce drug delivery [45]. Thus,
some coordination between activation of the pMDI and inhalation is still desirable, even with a spacer/
VHC.
• When breathing in from a spacer/VHC, a single slow and deep inhalation followed by a breath hold is
optimal [2, 70]. A minimum flow rate of 15 L·min−1 is acceptable while 30 L·min−1 is optimal [17, 25, 71].
• If the patient is not able to inhale with a slow and deep breath, tidal breathing appears to be the
alternative manoeuvre of choice; some studies in children have suggested that this technique is of
equivalent efficacy [72], while others suggest it is inferior [73].
• If tidal breathing is employed, the pMDI should be activated at the beginning of a tidal inhalation [74].
Studies in children suggest that two tidal breaths are sufficient to empty a small-volume spacer/VHC,
while three are needed for a larger volume spacer/VHC [74–76]. Note that the inspiratory flow
generated by very young children during tidal breathing may be insufficient to open the valves of some
VHCs [71].
• Multiple activations of the pMDI into the spacer/VHC before inhalation create turbulence and
significantly reduce the respirable fraction of the aerosol [66–68, 77].
• Although spacers/VHCs significantly remove larger, nonrespirable particles and thus reduce their
oropharyngeal deposition, they do not obviate the need to rinse the mouth and gargle after inhalation of
a corticosteroid, especially for those patients for whom a spacer/VHC was prescribed to overcome
hoarseness or thrush.
Recommendations on spacer/VHC maintenance
There are no universal recommendations for spacer/VHC maintenance; leaflets are often provided by
manufacturers but advice varies. Some of the advice hereunder is therefore empirical and not based on
clinical trial evidence, although there is evidence that poor maintenance and understanding of spacer/
VHC etiquette impacts unfavourably on efficient delivery of inhaled medication [18].
Spacers/VHCs are potentially subject to microbial contamination and, since they come into contact with
mucous membranes, it has been argued that they should be cleaned, disinfected, rinsed and air-dried after
each use [78]. Bacterial contamination of spacers/VHCs appears to be common; for example, in one study,
contamination with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae was
detected in 35% of spacers/VHCs used by asthmatic children [79]. The clinical sequelae, if any, are not
clear, and the principle of thoroughly cleaning the spacer/VHC after each and every use is neither
practised nor recommended in manufacturers’ instructions. Nevertheless, it would at least seem prudent
not to share devices between individuals.
Spacers/VHCs fabricated with nonconducting plastic materials accumulate internal electrostatic charge,
which may significantly reduce the drug aerosol available for inhalation [80]. This electrostatic charge can
be reduced with antistatic agents [67, 68, 81] or, more simply, by washing the inner surface with ordinary
household ionic detergent [82]. This also keeps the device clean and presumably minimises contamination
with microorganisms. Spacers/VHCs made of conducting (metal) materials are not susceptible to static
charge [67, 68], but still need cleaning. New nonconducting spacers/VHCs should therefore be washed before
their first use. All spacers/VHCs should subsequently be washed at least monthly and preferably weekly.
Table 3 lists the different steps in the washing and cleaning procedure. The spacer/VHC should be
disassembled and washed by hand (never in the dishwasher), by immersion and vigorous shaking in cold
TABLE 3 Washing and cleaning a spacer/valved holding chamber (VHC)
1) Disassemble the spacer/VHC after the last dose of the day
2) Immerse the parts in lukewarm tap water containing a few drops of household detergent
3) Shake the parts in the water and rub them with a soft cloth
4) Leave the parts soaking for 15 min, then take them out of the water
5) Do not rinse or dry rub the inside of the parts
6) Rinse soapy water off the mouthpiece
7) Place the parts on a clean towel to air-dry overnight
8) Reassemble the parts the next morning and check that the valve is not stuck
9) Wash your spacer/VHC every week

 or lukewarm tap water containing a small amount of simple, household ionic detergent [83]. While still
underwater, the spacer/VHC parts may be wiped with a soft cloth but not scrubbed. Once cleaned, they
should be left to soak for 15 min, then be taken out of the water, placed on a clean towel without rinsing
and left to air-dry (washing the device last thing at night is therefore a good time). This allows the
detergent to form a thin, antistatic layer on the inner surface of the spacer/VHC. In contrast to the spacer/
VHC, it may be advisable to rinse the soapy water off the mouthpiece to get rid of the taste and because
of the potential for developing contact dermatitis from the detergent [78]. Spacers/VHCs made of
conducting, antistatic material may be rinsed both on the outside and inside before air drying overnight.
After drying overnight, the spacer/VHC should be reassembled with a check to see that the valves, if any,
are not stuck. The outside surface of the spacer/VHC may be cleaned more regularly when necessary.
“Priming” of the spacer/VHC by repeatedly firing aerosol from the pMDI into it without inhaling also
reduces the electrostatic charge on the inner wall of nonconducting (plastic) spacers/VHCs. With each
puff, lubricants in the aerosol coat the inner surface of the spacer/VHC with an antistatic lining, which
significantly reduces subsequent adherence of the aerosol during routine use [31]. This practice is often
recommended before first using a new nonconducting spacer/VHC and after each cleaning session.
Despite the theoretical advantages of this procedure, its real-life clinical implications are again unclear and
it is wasteful of expensive medication [84]. Some manufacturers’ leaflets recommend priming with 15–20
puffs of medication, which is certainly excessive. It appears reasonable to assume that no more than one
or two puffs after each cleaning session is sufficient. Regular (twice daily) use of the pMDI for
maintenance therapy will prime it in any case day by day. Conducting (metal) spacers do not need
priming at all [30, 82, 84].
According to manufacturers’ leaflets, the lifetime of a spacer/VHC varies between 6 and 12 months.
Spacers/VHCs should, therefore, be replaced at least annually.
Conclusions
An editorial written 25 years ago advocated more widespread use of spacers/VHCs [85] and today, the
message remains unchanged. In view of the many advantages and few disadvantages of spacers/VHCs,
every patient treated with a pMDI should own and regularly use a spacer/VHC, and know how to use it
properly, both for routine preventer therapy and in an emergency, and how to keep it clean and keep an
eye out for faults.
This implies that healthcare professionals should be empowered and motivated to impart this knowledge
in a uniform, systematic way as part of the routine management of obstructive airway diseases. Since
apparently only a small minority (∼10%) of healthcare professionals appears to be capable of teaching
patients how to use inhaler devices, including spacers, properly [86], the need for recommendations for
use and maintenance, as well as training and teaching, would appear as pressing as ever.
Further research is necessary to define more precisely the clinical benefits of the use of spacers/VHCs in
the real world, which will in turn allow estimation of their cost effectiveness. Finally, notwithstanding the
best intentions of healthcare professionals, there must be continued awareness of the question of whether
or not patients really use them and their possible impact, positive or negative, on compliance with inhaled
medication in general.
