Summary
Background To date, the burden of cancer among young adults has rarely been studied in depth. Our aim was to 
describe the scale and profile of cancer incidence and mortality worldwide among 20–39 year-olds, highlighting major 
patterns by age, sex, development level, and geographical region.
Methods We did a population-based study to quantify the burden of young adult cancers worldwide. We defined 
young adult cancers as those occurring between the ages of 20 and 39 years because these individuals will have 
passed puberty and adolescence, but not yet experienced the effects of hormonal decline, immune response 
deterioration, or organ dysfunction associated with chronic health conditions. Global, regional, and country-
specific (n=184) data estimates of the number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths that occurred in 
2012 among young adults were extracted in four 5-year bands from the International Agency for Research on 
Cancer’s GLOBOCAN 2012 for all cancers combined and for 27 major types as defined by the International 
Classification of Disease, tenth revision. We report the number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated deaths 
overall and by sex alongside corresponding age-standardised rates (ASR) per 100 000 people per year. We also 
present results using four levels of the Human Development Index (HDI; low [least developed], medium, high, 
and very high [most developed]), which is a composite indicator for socioeconomic development comprising life 
expectancy, education, and gross national income.
Findings 975 396 new cancer cases and 358 392 cancer-associated deaths occurred among young adults worldwide in 
2012, which equated to an ASR of 43·3 new cancer cases per 100 000 people per year and 15·9 cancer-associated 
deaths per 100 000 people per year. The burden was disproportionally greater among women and the most common 
cancer types overall in terms of new cases were female breast cancer, cervical cancer, thyroid cancer, leukaemia, and 
colorectal cancer; in terms of deaths, female breast cancer, liver cancer, leukaemia, and cervical cancer were the main 
contributors. When assessed by development level and geographical region, the cancer profile varied substantially; 
generally, the burden of infection-associated cancers was greater in regions under transition. Cancer incidence was 
elevated in very high-HDI regions compared with low-HDI regions (ASR 64·5 vs 46·2 cancer cases per 100 000 people 
per year); however, the mortality burden was 3 times higher in low-HDI regions (ASR 25·4 vs 9·2 cancer-associated 
deaths per 100 000 people per year), reflecting differences in cancer profiles and inferior outcomes.
Interpretation The global cancer burden among 20–39 year-olds differs from that seen in younger or older ages and 
varies substantially by age, sex, development level, and geographical region. Although the cancer burden is lower in 
this age group than that observed in older ages, the societal and economic effects remain great given the major effects 
of premature morbidity and mortality. Targeted surveillance, prevention, and treatment are needed to reduce the 
cancer burden in this underserved age group.

Introduction
Cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality 
across all age groups in both developed and 
transitioning economies.1 To date, research has focused 
on cancer in children and at older ages. This focus 
could be because a cure in children would lead to 
decades of productive life and because the burden of 
most epithelial cancers is increasing with age and 
cancer is becoming a leading cause of death in many 
countries. As a result, in relative terms, cancers that 
occur during young adulthood have been investigated 
to a lesser degree. These cancers are a bridge between 
paediatric and adult oncology, and represent a distinct 
spectrum of disease among young adults who have a

large proportion of their expected lifespans remaining, 
contribute substantially to the economy, and have an 
important role in caring for their families.2 Thus, 
international research investigating the specific issues 
unique to this age group of cancer patients is needed to 
improve cancer-associated outcomes.
In this study, we assess the scale and profile of young 
adult cancers globally. We report the estimated number of 
new cases and deaths in 2012, as well as the corresponding 
incidence and mortality, describing variations by human 
development level and geographical region. 
Methods
Study design
Although 0–14 years is broadly accepted as the age 
range for childhood cancer and 15–19 years is broadly 
accepted for adolescent cancer, the age range for young 
adult cancer is less clear because there is no uniform 
opinion on the upper age limit for this group,3 with the 
ages 24 years,4 25 years,5 29 years,6,7 34 years,8 and 
39 years9 all currently being used. For this study, we 
define young adult cancers as those that occur between 
the ages of 20 and 39 years, in line with that suggested 
by the Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology Progress 
Review Group.9 As the group states, the rationale for 
using this age range relates to biological and 
physiological maturity, with individuals having passed 
puberty, but not yet experienced the effects of hormonal 
decline, immune response deterioration, or organ 
dysfunction associated with chronic health conditions.9 
Thus, using this definition, we provide an inclusive 
assessment of the scale and profile of cancers in this 
age group that overlaps partially or entirely with that 
used by other organisations involved in young adult 
oncology.
Data sources and statistical analyses
To quantify the cancer burden for this age group, global, 
regional, and country-specific (n=184) estimates of the 
number of new cancer cases and cancer-associated 
deaths that occurred in 2012 among young adults were 
extracted in four 5-year bands from the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer’s GLOBOCAN 2012.1 To 
make comparisons with younger and older age groups, 
the estimated number of new cancer cases and deaths 
among individuals aged 0–19 years, 40–59 years, and 
60 years and older was also extracted. Further information 
on the methods used to create the incidence, mortality, 
and population estimates used in GLOBOCAN 2012 is 
provided elsewhere.1
We present the results for all cancer types included in 
GLOBOCAN 2012, defined by the International 
Classification of Disease, tenth revision (ICD-10):10 
lip and oral cavity (C00–08), nasopharynx (C11), other 
pharynx (C09–10, C12–14), oesophagus (C15), stomach 
(C16), colorectal (including anus; C18–21), liver (C22), 
gallbladder including biliary tract (C23–24), pancreas 
(C25), larynx (C32), lung including trachea (C33–34), 
melanoma of the skin (C43), Kaposi’s sarcoma (C46), 
female breast (hence 
forth referred to as breast; C50), 
cervix uteri (C53), corpus uteri (C54), ovary (C56), 
prostate (C61), testis (C62), kidney including renal pelvis 
and ureter (C64–66), bladder (C67), brain and CNS 
(C70–72), thyroid (C73), Hodgkin’s lymphoma (C81), 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (C82–85, C96), multiple 
myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases (C88, C90), 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Although substantial research on cancer in children and older 
age groups has been undertaken, the burden of cancer 
among young adults (20–39 years) has rarely been studied in 
depth, and is often overlooked by cancer researchers and 
policy makers alike. To determine the current evidence 
describing young adult oncology globally we searched 
PubMed for publications in English, without any date 
restrictions, using the terms “young adult”, “cancer”, “global”, 
“incidence”, and “mortality”. Because there is no 
internationally agreed definition for young adults, the term 
“adolescent and young adult” was also included, because 
these groups are sometimes combined. From our search it 
was clear that there was a paucity of research on young adult 
cancer in countries with limited resources, with nearly all of 
the literature focusing on high-income countries, particularly 
the USA, Canada, and several European countries. Thus, we 
sought to describe the magnitude and patterns of cancer in 
young adults globally to improve the understanding of 
cancer in this age group.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to explore the 
global burden of cancer among young adults for the given period 
and age group. By assessing all cancers combined and 27 major 
types, we provide evidence on the cancer burden distribution by 
age, sex, development level, and geographical region. 
Furthermore, our study explores barriers to improving cancer 
information and outcomes in young adults in low-income, 
middle-income, and high-income countries, and highlights 
future opportunities for improvement.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our data serve as a status report to aid young adult oncology 
researchers and increase awareness of cancers among this 
underserved age group. The considerable societal and economic 
effects of cancer in young adults as a major cause of premature 
morbidity and mortality requires targeted, resource-dependent 
interventions. Through continuous surveillance, vaccination, 
early detection programmes, and curative treatment the cancer 
burden can be reduced in this underserved age group.

leukaemia (C91–95), and all sites combined excluding 
non-melanoma skin cancer (C00–97, except C44).
We calculated age-standardised incidence and mortality 
rates (ASR) per 100 000 people per year at the global and 
country level using the World Standard Population as 
proposed by Segi11 and modified by Doll and colleagues.12 
Case fatality, a measure of the severity of a disease, was 
approximated by dividing the mortality ASR by the 
incidence ASR (M:I). To document key patterns in 
the cancer burden, we draw comparisons between 
low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and 
high-income countries (HICs). Furthermore, we present 
the results by geographical region, using 19 UN-defined 
geographical sub-regions, and development level, using 
the Human Development Index (HDI; low [least 
developed], medium, high, and very high [most 
developed]; appendix p 1);13 the HDI is a socioeconomic 
development indicator comprising life expectancy, 
education, and gross national income. All analyses were 
undertaken using Stata 13.1 statistical software.

Results
975 396 new cancer cases and 358 392 cancer-associated 
deaths were estimated to have occurred among 
20–39 year-olds worldwide in 2012, with the disease 
more frequent among women (male:female ratios of 
0·5 for incidence and 0·8 for mortality; tables 1 and 2). 
The incidence ASR was 43·3 new cancer cases per 
100 000 people per year and mortality ASR was 
15·9 cancer-associated deaths per 100 000 people per 
year. The annual burden was markedly higher among 
young adults relative to children and adolescents 
(0–19 year-olds) at approximately four times greater in

terms of new cancers and approximately three times 
greater in terms of cancer-associated deaths, but 
considerably lower than cases and deaths in middle-age 
(40–59 years) or in late-adulthood (60 years or older; 
figure 1).
The 
spectrum 
of 
cancers 
observed 
among 
20–39 year-olds also differed from those diagnosed at 
younger and older ages. Common tumour types in 
children and adolescents, including leukaemia and 
cancers of the brain and CNS were among the most 
common cancers at ages 20–39 years (figure 1). However, 
common epithelial tumours such as breast cancer 
(ranked first for new cases and deaths overall), cervical 
cancer (ranked second for new cases and fourth for 
deaths overall), and colorectal cancer (ranked fifth for 
new cases and sixth for deaths overall) were more 
frequently observed among young adults than children 
or adolescents, though still to a lesser extent than those 
observed in older ages.
Breast cancer or cervical cancer were the most common 
cancer types in young adults for most countries in 
terms of incidence and mortality (figure 2), and together 
accounted for 301 854 (30·9%) of the total estimated new 
cases and 76 661 (21·4%) of the total estimated cancer-
associated deaths (tables 1 and 2). The ASR for incidence 
of breast cancer was 17·0 per 100 000 people per year and 
9·9 per 100 000 people per year for cervical cancer. The 
ASR for mortality for breast cancer was 4·4 per 
100 000 people per year and 2·5 per 100 000 people per 
year for cervical cancer. Other frequently diagnosed 
cancers included thyroid cancer (78 568 [8·1%] cases; 
ASR 3·5 per 100 000 people per year), leukaemia 
(49 293 [5·1%] cases; ASR 2·2 per 100 000 people per year), 
and colorectal cancer (41 117 [4·2%] cases; ASR 1·8 per 
100 000 people per year). Notably, thyroid cancer was 
4-times more common in women than in men, with an 
ASR of 5·7 per 100 000 women per year and 1·4 per 
100 000 men per year. In terms of deaths, leukaemia

(36 253 [10·1%] deaths; ASR 1·6 per 100 000 people per 
year), liver cancer (36 228 [10·1%] deaths; ASR 1·6 per 
100 000 people per year), and brain or CNS cancer 
(20 783 [5·8%] deaths; ASR 0·9 per 100 000 people per 
year) were additional large contributors to the burden.
Even among young adults, the cancer profile according 
to 5-year age intervals was heterogeneous (figure 1). The 
proportion of leukaemia, lymphomas, testicular cancer, 
and thyroid cancer reduced with increasing age; whereas, 
the proportions of cervical, breast, liver, and colorectal 
cancer increased. A similar transition was observed 
when deaths were assessed, with cancers more 
commonly 
observed 
in 
children 
or 
adolescents 
decreasing in frequency as age at diagnosis increased, 
with these cancer types being replaced by cancers more 
common in adulthood. 
The global burden of young adult cancers in terms of 
new cases of cancer varied according to the four-level 
HDI (appendix pp 2–13). Although the absolute number 
of new cases was greatest among countries in the high-
HDI level, the incidence was greatest at the very high-
HDI level (ASR 64·5 new cases per 100 000 people per 
year), followed by the low-HDI level (ASR 46·2 new cases 
per 100 000 people per year). With respect to the cancer 
profile across the HDI levels (appendix pp 14–15), breast 
cancer was the most common cancer and cervical cancer 
was the second most common cancer, in the low, 
medium, and high-HDI levels, while at the very high-
HDI level these cancers ranked first and fifth, respectively 
(figure 3). Thyroid cancer, melanoma of the skin, and 
testicular cancer were more frequent in very high-HDI 
regions, whereas cancers associated with infection were 
more frequent in countries indexed within the low-HDI 
level; indeed, one in three cancers (33·2%) were linked to 
major infectious agents, including human papillomavirus 
(HPV), human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), hepatitis B virus 
(HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Helicobacter pylori, 
in low-HDI countries relative to one  in nine (11·3%) in 
very high-HDI settings (appendix p 16). Notably, across 
all HDI levels, the top five incident cancers accounted for 
more than 50% of the total estimated number of new 
cases (figure 3).
Mortality was reduced with increasing HDI (appendix 
pp 17–28). The overall case fatality of 55·0% (M:I 
 
25·4/46·2) and 49·1% (M:I 16·1/32·8) in low and 
medium-HDI countries, respectively, was approximately 
41 and 35 percentage points higher than that observed in 
very high-HDI populations (14.3%; M:I 9·2/64·5; 
appendix pp 29–32). In terms of the cancer profile, breast 
and cervical cancer were among the top five causes of 
cancer-associated deaths across all HDI levels, as was 
leukaemia (figure 3). Liver cancer and Kaposi’s sarcoma 
were the remaining largest contributors to the mortality 
burden in low-HDI regions. At the medium-HDI level, 
colorectal cancer and stomach cancer were among the 
most fatal cancers, while liver cancer was the leading 
cause of cancer-associated death in high-HDI regions. 
Finally, for very high-HDI regions, brain and CNS cancer 
and colorectal cancer were the remaining largest causes 
of cancer death. Briefly, for cancer-specific case fatality, 
an increasing step-wise gradient with decreasing human 
development was observed for most cancer sites 
(appendix pp 29–32); the greatest disparities were 
observed for Hodgkin’s lymphoma, melanoma of the 
skin, and cancers of the prostate, testis, thyroid, kidney, 
and breast—all of which had an estimated case fatality at 
least 5-times greater in low-HDI settings compared with 
very high-HDI settings.
With regard to geographical variations, the incidence 
among 20–39 year-olds was greatest in Australia and 
New Zealand, and most countries in northern America 
and Europe, whereas parts of Africa, western Asia, and 
southern Asia had the lowest incidence (figure 4A). 
When assessed on a broader regional scale, the cancer 
profiles were diverse (appendix pp 2–13). For example, 
the ASR for breast cancer varied from 6·6 per 
100 000 people per year in Central America to 14·0 per 
100 000 people per year in Australia and New Zealand. 
Greater variations were observed for cervical cancer, with 
the incidence varying 15-fold; it was lowest in northern 
Africa and highest in southern Africa (figure 5). Other 
marked geographical differences included those of

testicular cancer and melanoma of the skin, both of 
which were concentrated in northern America, Europe, 
and Australia and New Zealand (appendix pp 2–13). 
Kaposi’s sarcoma was most common in eastern Africa 
and southern Africa, where 17 024 (84·5%) of the 
estimated 20 153 new cases occurred. Finally, the greatest 
burden of thyroid cancer was observed in northern 
America (ASR 13·4 6 per 100 000 people per year), where 
the incidence was 45-times higher than that observed in 
middle Africa (ASR 0·3 per 100 000 people per year); the 
burden was also substantial in Australia and New Zealand 
(ASR 7·7 per 100 000 people per year), western Europe 
(ASR 6·1 per 100 000 people per year), western Asia 
(ASR 5·6 per 100 000 people per year), and eastern Asia 
(ASR 5·4 per 100 000 people per year).
Despite the incidence being greatest in the most 
developed countries, these regions conversely had the 
lowest mortality, with the mortality burden greatest in 
parts of Africa and Asia (figure 4B). Indeed, cancer fatality 
was greatest in western Africa (64·3%; M:I 25·4/39·5),

with proportions greater than 50% also seen in middle 
Africa, eastern Africa, and southern Asia—all substantially 
higher than the case fatality proportions in Australia and 
New Zealand (11·3%; M:I 8·6/76·4), western Europe 
(12·5%; M:I 8·6/68·9), and northern America (12·6%; 
M:I 9·6/76·0; appendix pp 29–32). Although not as 
substantial, variation in cancer mortality was also seen in 
HICs (figure 5). In terms of the cancer profile, the greatest 
mortality burden for breast cancer was observed in 
western Africa (ASR 6·5 per 100 000 people per year), 
middle Africa (ASR 4·7 per 100 000 people per year), and 
eastern Africa (ASR 4·7 per 100 000 people per year; 
appendix pp 17–28). For cervical cancer, the mortality 
burden varied 31-fold, ranging from an ASR of 0·2 per 
100 000 people per year in northern Africa and western 
Asia to an ASR of 5·1 per 100 000 people per year in 
Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Again, the case 
fatality for specific cancer sites varied substantially 
worldwide; however, cancers with known worse survival 
prospects showed less heterogeneity (appendix pp 29–32).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate 
cancer incidence and mortality among young adults 
worldwide. Overall, the global incidence of cancer in 
20–39 year-olds in 2012 was 43·3 per 100 000 people per 
year, and the corresponding mortality was 15·9 per 
100 000 people per year. We report considerable variations 
in the scale of incidence and mortality worldwide, and 
illustrate the heterogeneity of cancer types in this age 
group when stratified by age, sex, development level, and 
geographical region. Furthermore, our study highlights 
the need to increase awareness and resources for this 
neglected subpopulation.
Cancers of the breast and cervix uteri were the major 
contributors to the cancer burden among young adults 
globally, although there was wide variability in the scale 
and profile of cancer according to HDI level and 
geographical region. Broadly, we observed a greater 
proportion of infection-associated cancers at lower HDI 
levels. These findings are consistent with established 
epidemiological transitions and cancer transitions 
as countries become increasingly societally and 
economically developed.14
Variations in the young adult cancer profile globally 
also relate to differences in screening or detection 
practices, genetic predispositions, and exposure to other 
risk factors.2 For example, the burden of thyroid cancer is 
substantially greater in very high-HDI countries, with 
incidences highest in North America. This association 
with human development level probably corresponds to 
changes in diagnostic practice and overdiagnosis in the 
USA and Canada, as well as in Australia, New Zealand, 
Europe, and some HICs in Asia.15 Similarly, a substantial 
proportion of breast cancers diagnosed before the age of 
40 years are linked with genetic factors, and thus the 
elevated rates in North America, Australia, New Zealand, 
and Europe could relate to a higher incidence of BRCA1/2 
mutations in individuals of European ancestry.16 
However, breast cancer incidence in west Africa are 
strikingly similar to these western countries. Previous 
research has shown that women from west Africa 
develop breast cancer at younger ages, with a mean age at 
presentation of between 35 and 45 years, 10–15 years 
earlier than women in HICs;17 these cancers, which could 
include a disproportionate number of tumours with poor 
prognosis,17 are probably associated with a mix of genetic 
and environmental factors unique to this subpopulation.18
Such differences in the distribution of cancer types, 
with more fatal cancers generally more prominent in 
LMICs, was in turn responsible for the worse cancer

outcomes noted in our results among young adults from 
these regions. However, even within the same cancer 
type, mortality was higher in LMICs; this was particularly 
apparent for kidney, testicular, and breast cancer, 
leukaemia, and lymphoma, implying that these variations 
in case fatality are probably due to fractured health 
infrastructures,2 the detection of cancers at a later stage2 
because of ineffective screening tests or no early detection 
procedures,19 and poor access and availability of 
treatment.20
With nearly one million cancers occurring among 
young adults worldwide in 2012, efforts are urgently 
needed to address the cancer burden in this age group. 
This population has, however, been neglected by cancer 
researchers and policy makers, often being referred to as 
a lost tribe.9,21,22 Throughout the past decade, young adult 
oncology has attracted increasing attention in some 
HICs, given that cancer represents the most common 
cause of disease-associated death for this age group23 and 
survival improvements have lagged behind those of both 
children and older adults.6,21 Globally, however, much 
remains unknown in this area of oncology. Expanding 
the young adult cancer agenda beyond HICs remains a 
challenge, but one of great importance as young adults 
represent a large proportion of the population with an 
inherent potential for economic growth in many LMICs.
An opportunity to reduce the cancer burden in young 
adults lies in prevention because unlike most cancers 
occurring at younger ages, a substantial proportion of 
young adult cancers are preventable. In view of the 
substantial contribution of cervical and liver cancer to the 
global young adult cancer burden, national HPV 
vaccination programmes of HPV-naive people and HBV 
vaccination programmes for neonates would probably 
have a sizable effect in reducing cancer incidence in 
young adults worldwide. Similarly, adequate treatment

for HIV could further reduce the cancer burden of 
Kaposi’s sarcoma, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa 
where incidence was greatest. Although lifestyle and 
environmental factors drive some of the burden, many 
young adult cancers are not strongly influenced by the 
major risk factors associated with the onset of certain 
cancers at older ages, such as tobacco, alcohol, or 
nutrition. To target cancers representing smaller 
contributors to the overall burden, additional relatively 
inexpensive preventive strategies of known efficacy 
should be considered, including those targeting 
melanoma of the skin (eg, limiting exposure to direct 
sunlight, increased sunscreen use, and avoidance of 
tanning salons).9
Another relevant opportunity is ensuring timely 
diagnosis, with previous research suggesting that young 
adults experience more delays compared with children, 
adolescents, and older age groups.2,21 In HICs, delays in 
diagnosis have been associated with psychological and 
social factors; whereas, in LMICs, cultural norms and 
geographic accessibility could represent the greatest 
obstacles. Affordability of and access to care also 
represent substantial barriers to cancer care worldwide. 
Although no age-specific screening tests are currently 
available for young adults,24 our data indicate that 
screening and early detection programmes might have a 
significant effect at a limited cost—particularly those 
targeting cervical cancer (eg, visual inspection with acetic 
acid screening) and breast cancer (eg, self-awareness 
through self-examination and enhanced screening for 
BRCA1/2 carriers), with lesser but still potentially 
worthwhile effects for testicular cancer, colorectal cancer,

and melanoma of the skin in high-risk populations.9,24 
Research into such programmes specifically in young 
adults is needed, to determine the benefits and 
potential risks, particularly for breast and testicular 
self-examination because these recommendations24 are 
not currently supported by evidence. In general, 
increasing awareness of cancer in this age group at both 
public and professional levels is needed to bring attention 
to the aforementioned primary and secondary prevention 
measures, reduce delays, and lead to improvements in 
the cancer burden across all resource levels.
Finally, once diagnosed, young adults with cancer must 
be able to access high quality care. Currently, care for these 
individuals is scattered; even in HICs, young adult 
oncology expertise is rare, with 90% of North American 
young adults with cancer receiving their care in community 
practices.25,26 In many cases, which treatment protocols 
offer this population the best chance of cure is still unclear, 
with extrapolations made from younger and older 
populations. This uncertainty is largely due to the low 
participation in the relatively few clinical trials available for 
this age group;2,21 thus, increasing the availability of and 
participation in clinical trials for this group is of paramount 
importance.9 Even when effective treatment protocols for 
young adults are known, further work is necessary to 
ensure that all patients can access such treatment. For 
example, despite evidence proving the superiority of 
paediatric treatment protocols for young adults with acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), a study25 found that the 
percentage of Californian young adults with ALL treated 
with such protocols reduced from 31% in 2008–12 to 21% 
in 2013–14. Access to appropriate treatment is even more 
crucial in countries under transition. Although freely 
available guidelines for young adult oncology, such as that 
produced by the National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network,24 might be of help, it remains uncertain whether 
such guidelines are appropriate for more resource-limited 
settings. Finally, our data show that even within HICs 
cancer mortality varies substantially. Several HICs have 
built alternative models of young adult cancer care delivery, 
such as a nationwide network of young adult cancer units 
in the UK;27 whether these different models improve 
cancer outcomes is unknown.
Implementation of the above recommendations will 
require substantial investment in young adult oncology. 
Although such investments in LMICs might seem too 
complex or costly, the economic advantages are clear 
given the number of potential years of life saved; this is 
exemplified by the fact that this population has 
approximately 25–45 years of their life expectancy 
remaining (average global life expectancy at birth for 
individuals aged 20–39 years in 2012 was 63·3 years28), 
which is substantially greater than that observed in 
older adults who have not only a shorter remaining life 
expectancy but also poorer survival prospects after 
cancer diagnosis. Because individuals in this age group 
are the most financially productive members of their 
societies, it is clear that improving equity in prevention, 
diagnosis, and care will not only have large societal 
effects, but might also be cost-effective.21 Studies 
undertaking cost benefit analyses of improving young 
adult cancer care, particularly in LMICs, are needed to 
inform policy makers and advocates.
Our results provide a comprehensive estimation of 
young adult cancers worldwide in 2012 but have several 
limitations. The GLOBOCAN cancer groupings do not 
directly correspond with the recommended classification 
scheme for tumours diagnosed in young adults by Birch 
and colleagues.29 Furthermore, our results are estimates 
from the GLOBOCAN database, which were compiled 
using a hierarchy of methods; thus, accuracy was 
dependent on the quality and availability of the source 
information at a given time.1 Clearly, the inclusion of 
uncertainty intervals for the estimates provided in this 
study would be useful, and collaborative work is currently 
underway to create such intervals that take into account 
deficiencies in the quality and availability of the source 
information at the national level, as well as inherent 
statistical uncertainty. To address both of these 
limitations, future research should be undertaken using 
available population-based cancer registry data through 
Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, which would allow 
an assessment of histologically defined cancers, 
including those that we were not able to address in this 
paper (eg, bone cancer and soft tissue sarcomas), and 
trends, albeit for a limited number of countries or 
subnational regions.
In summary, the global cancer burden among 
20–39 year-olds differs from that in younger or older 
ages, but also varies substantially by age, sex, development 
level, and geographical region. Although cancer is less 
frequently observed in young adults than at older ages, 
its effects remain considerable because these individuals 
have a large proportion of their expected lifespans 
remaining, contribute substantially to the economy, and 
play a major part in caring for their families. Because 
young adult cancer patients exhibit a combination of 
features observed in younger and older patients, progress 
needs to be achieved through a combination of the 
methods that led to improvements in these other groups: 
advancement of risk stratification and treatment 
protocols through clinical trials in children and 
implementation of effective prevention and early 
detection at older ages.
