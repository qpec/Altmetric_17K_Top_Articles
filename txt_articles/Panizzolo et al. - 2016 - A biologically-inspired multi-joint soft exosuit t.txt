Abstract
Background: Carrying load alters normal walking, imposes additional stress to the musculoskeletal system, and results
in an increase in energy consumption and a consequent earlier onset of fatigue. This phenomenon is largely due to
increased work requirements in lower extremity joints, in turn requiring higher muscle activation. The aim of this work
was to assess the biomechanical and physiological effects of a multi-joint soft exosuit that applies assistive torques to
the biological hip and ankle joints during loaded walking.
Methods: The exosuit was evaluated under three conditions: powered (EXO_ON), unpowered (EXO_OFF) and unpowered
removing the equivalent mass of the device (EXO_OFF_EMR). Seven participants walked on an instrumented split-belt
treadmill and carried a load equivalent to 30 % their body mass. We assessed their metabolic cost of walking, kinetics,
kinematics, and lower limb muscle activation using a portable gas analysis system, motion capture system, and surface
electromyography.
Results: Our results showed that the exosuit could deliver controlled forces to a wearer. Net metabolic power
in the EXO_ON condition (7.5 ± 0.6 W kg−1) was 7.3 ± 5.0 % and 14.2 ± 6.1 % lower than in the EXO_OFF_EMR
condition (7.9 ± 0.8 W kg−1; p = 0.027) and in the EXO_OFF condition (8.5 ± 0.9 W kg−1; p = 0.005), respectively.
The exosuit also reduced the total joint positive biological work (sum of hip, knee and ankle) when comparing
the EXO_ON condition (1.06 ± 0.16 J kg−1) with respect to the EXO_OFF condition (1.28 ± 0.26 J kg−1; p = 0.020)
and to the EXO_OFF_EMR condition (1.22 ± 0.21 J kg−1; p = 0.007).
Conclusions: The results of the present work demonstrate for the first time that a soft wearable robot can improve
walking economy. These findings pave the way for future assistive devices that may enhance or restore gait in other
applications.

Background
Carrying heavy loads alters the biomechanics of walking,
leading to an increased metabolic burden. This negative
consequence of load carriage has been reported in soldiers,
first responders, and recreational athletes who are required
to execute physically demanding tasks during walking
[1, 2]. Several studies investigating the locomotion of
these populations reported increased lower limb joint work
[3, 4], which requires higher muscle activation to both sus-
tain the load and stabilize the joints themselves [5]. Higher
muscle activity is associated with an increased metabolic
cost [5], leading to an earlier onset of fatigue and an overall
reduction of performance [1, 2] while walking. Additionally,
prolonged load carriage can result in an increased risk of
injury, the most common of which are foot blisters, stress
fractures, back strains, metatarsalgia (foot pain), rucksack
palsy (shoulder traction injury) and knee pain [6]. Solutions
that effectively reduce the burden associated with load car-
riage during walking are thus warranted.

 Lower-limb exoskeletons have been proposed as a means
to augment or assist human locomotion for many applica-
tions [7]. Some exoskeletons have been designed to make
load carriage easier by providing a parallel load path to the
ground [8–10], while others apply torques directly to the
wearer’s joints [7, 11–14]. These systems are composed of
rigid frames that allow the transmission of high forces and,
although they represent remarkable achievements, their
rigid nature presents a number of practical challenges
toward the goal of assisting locomotion. The main
challenges arise in aligning the exoskeleton and bio-
logical joints with each other [15] and reducing sys-
tem mass and in particular distal mass as this can
increase metabolic effort [16].
As an alternative to rigid exoskeletons, we have devel-
oped a multi-joint soft exosuit [17–22] that uses textiles
to provide a more compliant means to interface with the
human body (Fig. 1a-b). Our exosuit is lightweight, with
the majority of mass worn close to the wearer’s center of
mass (Additional file 1: Table S1, which compares the
weight with other autonomous exoskeletons), minimizing
its impact on the energetics of gait [16]. The soft exosuit
transmits moments around the biological joint axes
through flexible cable-based transmissions and textiles
that anchor to the body. Moreover, the exosuit minimally
influences the wearer’s natural walking kinematics [17]
and is active only when it detects walking. At all other
times, the exosuit can be truly transparent when the
cables are commanded to go slack. For this study, the exo-
suit assisted walking by generating assistive torques at the
ankle and the hip, since they are the major power contrib-
utors to level-ground walking [23], via forces in two load
paths (Fig. 1c), each actuated by a proximally-mounted
actuation unit (Fig. 1d).
Our research group has demonstrated reductions in
metabolic cost during load carriage with a tethered soft
exosuit [20, 24]. One study [20], conducted with a lab-
based, multi-joint tethered actuation platform (composed
of a power supply, linear actuators and motor controllers
mounted on a stationary platform next to a treadmill),
reported reductions in the metabolic cost of walking for hip
extension assistance (4.6 %) and for multi-joint assistance
(14.6 %). Multi-joint assistance consisted of hip extension,
ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion. Though promising, the
tethered actuation platform limits the soft exosuit’s applic-
ability to everyday walking.
Therefore, the aim of this work was to perform the first
study with an autonomous (fully portable) multi-joint (assist-
ing hip extension, ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion as in
[20]) soft exosuit to evaluate if it could represent an effective
solution to reduce the metabolic cost during loaded walking.
We evaluated the performance of our soft exosuit on a
group of load carriers walking with a load equivalent to 30 %
their body weight under three conditions: with the device
powered (EXO_ON), with the device unpowered (EXO_-
OFF) and with the device unpowered with equivalent mass
removed (EXO_OFF_EMR). The second condition (EXO_-
OFF) was evaluated to assess the penalty associated with car-
rying the additional mass represented by the device itself, an
important consideration in the design of such systems. To
obtain additional insights on the benefit of wearing the
soft exosuit and to extend the knowledge on the biomech-
anical and physiological effects of this device, we evaluated
metabolic cost, muscle activation and joint mechanics

 which have been shown to be relevant for regulating
metabolic energy cost during gait [25].
Methods
Soft exosuit design and operation
A lower extremity soft exosuit (Fig. 1a-c) and the associated
actuation system (Fig. 1d) were fabricated. The exosuit and
the actuation system were discussed in detail in [22]. Briefly,
the exosuit consisted of a structured textile extending bilat-
erally from the waist to the feet and was composed of three
principle components: a waist belt, bilateral thigh pieces and
bilateral calf straps (Fig. 1e). Two actuation units (Fig. 1a-b)
were mounted on a backpack and connected to the exosuit
by Bowden cables. To operate, the actuation units retracted
the inner cable of the Bowden cable assembly, delivering a
controlled force to the wearer. The level of force transmitted
to the wearer was monitored by
load
cells
using
force-based position control, as described in Additional
file 1: Text S1 and in Additional file 1: Figure S1.
Briefly, force-based position control imposes a predefined
position trajectory as a function of the gait cycle to the
motor acting on the Bowden cables to achieve a spe-
cific force profile. The cable position trajectory generates
a force in the exosuit because the textile, the Bowden
cables, and the human tissue underneath the exosuit
are compliant. The combination of these factors, de-
fined as the “suit-human series stiffness” (Fig. 2), is a
mapping
between
the
cable
position
and
induced
force. While the position control method generated consist-
ent
force
profiles
for
fixed
kinematics
and
suit
conditions, an algorithm that monitors key force profile
features iteratively adjusted assistive position profiles on a
step-by-step basis to account for small variations in gait
and drift of textile components. Similar iterative learning
techniques to achieve desired exoskeleton torque patterns
have been explored [26].
The load-transferring elements in the exosuit followed
two distinct paths in each leg as described in Fig. 1c.
One multiarticular load path extended from the waist,
over the front of the thigh, down the side of the leg,
passing approximately through the knee joint axis, and
to the back of the calf. An additional supporting element
attached at the front of the shin. A Bowden cable sheath
was anchored to this load path at the back of the calf,
with the inner cable extending to the back of the heel. A
second monoarticular load path extended from the waist
to the back of the hip, and down to the thigh. Along this
load path, a Bowden cable sheath connected to the waist
belt at the back of the hip, and the inner cable con-
nected to the back of a thigh brace (Fig. 1).
Two actuation units (Fig. 1d) connected to the exosuit
via the Bowden cables generated external forces along
these two load paths. The multiarticular load path thus
enabled the generation of both ankle plantarflexion and
hip flexion torques, whereas the monoarticular load path
generated hip extension torques.
The ankle and hip contribute together approximately
80 % of the positive mechanical power produced by the
lower limb joints during walking [23, 27]. Power generation
at the ankle occurs mainly as the body is transitioning from
one leg to the other. The ankle on the trailing leg plantar-
flexes the foot, which propels the body upward and forward
to reduce the impact on the leading leg that is accepting
the weight of the body. Conversely, power at the hip is gen-
erated during extension when it accepts the body’s weight
just after heel strike and during flexion when it helps the
body to propel forward [27]. This second burst of power
generation at the hip occurs as the leg begins to swing
forward, which is approximately coincident with the ankle’s
pushing off. Therefore, our bioinspired design enables actu-
ation of both joints with a single load path. Details of how
the force in the multiarticular load path contributes to hip
flexion are explained further in Additional file 1: Text S1.
Fig. 2 Suit-human series stiffness. This schematic illustrates the mapping
between the cable position and the applied external force at the ankle
[24]. The three panels on the left describe the effect of the suit-human
series stiffness on force generation. The motor pulls on a Bowden cable
thus regulating its position across the gait cycle (top panel). This position
is transformed into a force on the wearer through the suit-human series
stiffness, a non-linear relationship between the force measured at the
ankle and the cable position of the motor (middle panel) that is due to
the presence of series elastic elements. These elements include cable
stretch, soft tissue compression and textile stretch. A force-based
feedback loop in the control system ensures the application of a
consistent force profile (bottom panel) accounting for the little variations
applied by the suit-human series stiffness [24]. The description of the
present schematic is relative to the multiarticular load path but an
analogous behavior is present in the monoarticular load path

 Soft exosuit actuation and control
The actuation system we built for the exosuit enabled
two motors to actuate all four of the load paths (two
load paths per leg). Each of the two actuation units
(Fig. 1d) consisted of: (1) a module with a geared motor,
(2) a multi-wrap pulley connected to two Bowden cables,
(3) electronics and (4) a battery module. One actuation
unit controlled the bilateral multiarticular load paths,
whereas the other actuation unit controlled the bilateral
monoarticular load paths as previously described in [22].
In each case, when the motor turned clockwise, the load
path on the left leg developed tension while the load path
on the right leg was made slack so that no force could be
generated. When the motor turned counterclockwise, the
load path on the right leg developed tension and the left
leg was made slack. Thus, this approach enabled the exo-
suit to become completely transparent along a particular
load path when desired. The total mass of the multi-joint
soft exosuit (including the soft exosuit and the two actu-
ation units) was 6.6 kg.
Participants
We recruited seven load carriers from the local community
(age: 29.3 ± 6.2 yr; height: 1.80 ± 0.07 m; weight: 77.9 ±
8.3 kg). All participants reported no musculoskeletal injur-
ies or diseases and provided written informed consent. The
participants whose images appear in the manuscript have
provided written consent for the publication of their images
according to the policies of the Journal of NeuroEngineer-
ing and Rehabilitation. The study was approved by the
Harvard Medical School Committee on Human Studies.
Testing protocol
Three different walking conditions were evaluated in the
present study: EXO_ON, EXO_OFF and EXO_OFF_EMR.
Participants walked on an instrumented split-belt tread-
mill measuring three-dimensional ground reaction forces
(Bertec, Columbus, OH, USA; 2160 Hz) at a constant
speed of 1.5 m s−1 while carrying a load equivalent to
30 % of their body mass (Fig. 3a) with the actuation units
powered (EXO_ON), and unpowered (EXO_OFF and
EXO_OFF_EMR). In the EXO_OFF_EMR condition, used
as baseline comparison, the equivalent weight of the
multi-joint soft exosuit (6.6 kg) was removed from the
load in the backpack, further details on this procedure are
provided in Additional file 1: Text S1. Participants wore
the same boots (Nike SFB) in all the conditions, as this
footwear is representative of that worn by load carriers.
These boots were worn because they had an integrated
attachment on the heel (Fig. 1a) to fix the inner cable of
the Bowden cable assembly, and have weight comparable
to that of walking shoes (450 g for size 9). Participants
walked for six minutes in the EXO_OFF_EMR and in the
EXO_OFF condition and for nine minutes in the EXO_ON
condition. The first three minutes of the EXO_ON condi-
tion allowed the device’s controller to ramp up forces to

 the desired level (detailed description in Additional file 1:
Text S1). The three walking conditions were randomized
for each participant to avoid any learning or adaptation
effects. Participants underwent a training session at least
two days prior to the data collection sessions to allow
them to become familiar with the exosuit and its oper-
ation before evaluations. In this session, participants com-
pleted two bouts of walking with the exosuit powered and
unpowered, for the same duration and with the same
modality of the EXO_ON and the EXO_OFF conditions.
Metabolic cost
Metabolic cost during walking was assessed by indirect
calorimetry using a portable gas analysis system (K4b2,
Cosmed, Roma, Italy) (Fig. 3b). Carbon dioxide and oxygen
rate were averaged across the last two minutes of each con-
dition used to calculate metabolic power using a modified
Brockway equation [28]. Net metabolic power for each
testing condition was obtained by subtracting the metabolic
power obtained during a standing trial performed at the
beginning of each session from the metabolic power calcu-
lated during the walking conditions. Net metabolic power
was normalized by the body mass of each participant.
Joints kinematics and kinetics
Three-dimensional (3D) gait analysis was performed
during treadmill walking. The marker set used for 3D
motion capture (VICON, Oxford Metrics, UK; 120 Hz)
was composed of 50 markers placed on specific anatom-
ical bony landmarks (Fig. 3b-c). Single markers were
placed on the left and right legs at the calcanei, heads of
the first and fifth metatarsals, medial and lateral malleoli,
medial and lateral knee condyles, greater trochanters,
left and right anterior superior iliac spines, left and right
iliac crests and at the midpoint between the iliac crest and
the anterior superior iliac spine on the left and right side.
Clusters of four markers were attached to the thighs and
shanks of both legs. Eight additional markers were placed
on the proximal and distal ends of each cable at the ankle
and hip, used to calculate the assistive forces’ lines of ac-
tion, along with their associated moment arms. All
markers and force trajectories were filtered using a zero-
lag 4th order low pass Butterworth filter with a 5–9 Hz op-
timal cut-off frequency selected using a custom residual
analysis algorithm (MATLAB, The MathWorks Inc.,
USA). Joint angles, net joint moments and powers were
calculated in the sagittal plane using filtered markers and
forces by means of an inverse kinematic and dynamic ap-
proach (Visual 3D, C-Motion, Rockville, MD, USA). Net
joint moments and powers were then normalized by each
participant’s body mass. An automatic gait event detection
algorithm (Visual 3D, C-Motion, Rockville, MD, USA)
was used to determine heel strikes that defined gait cycles.
Ten strides per condition were used for generating mean
kinematic and kinetic data for each participant, which were
subsequently combined to calculate condition mean data.
Muscle activity
During all trials, surface electromyography (EMG) signals
from eight lower limb muscles were measured by means of
a wired system (Delsys, Natick, MA, USA; 2160 Hz) simul-
taneously with the motion data measured by the VICON
system. Muscles investigated were: rectus femoris (RF), vas-
tus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), gluteus maximus
(GM), biceps femoris (BF), soleus (SOL), medial gastrocne-
mius (MG) and tibialis anterior (TA) (Fig. 3d). EMG signals
were band-pass filtered (4th order Butterworth, cut-off
20–450 Hz), rectified and low-pass filtered (4th order
Butterworth, cut-off 6 Hz) to obtain a linear envelope.
For each participant and for each muscle, the EMG linear
envelope was normalized to the peak value (averaged
across ten strides) recorded during the EXO_OFF_EMR
condition. Ten strides per condition were used to com-
pute mean muscle activation across each stride.
Biological joint work
To compute the biological components of net joint mo-
ment and power during the EXO_ON condition, the actu-
ation units were synchronized to the Vicon system using a
5 V signal generated at the beginning of the motion capture
data collection. Forces measured by load cells at the ankle
and the hip during the EXO_ON condition (Fig. 4a) were
segmented based on the heel strike times obtained by the
automatic gait events detection algorithm. Ten strides were
used to obtain an average force profile during the gait cycle.
Ankle and hip extension moments generated by the exosuit
during the EXO_ON condition (Fig. 4d) were calculated for
each participant as the product of the force recorded by the
corresponding (ankle or hip) load cell and the computed
moment arms. Moment arms were defined as the perpen-
dicular distance between the markers on the cable and the
respective joint center. As described above, the multiarticu-
lar nature of the exosuit generated a hip flexion moment
while assisting with ankle plantarflexion. To quantify this
flexion moment, an exosuit characterization experiment
was conducted on a separate testing day as described in
Additional file 1: Text S1. Briefly, two additional load cells
were placed at the point where the leg straps connect to
the waist belt (Fig. 4b). To assess the force distribution in
the multiarticular load path, the peak force collected by the
ankle load cell was compared to the sum of the peak forces
collected by the load cells at the waist belt (Fig. 4c). In this
way it was possible to assess which percentage of the force
applied at the ankle was also applied to the hip flexion
through the multiarticular load path. This estimated
peak force was multiplied by a constant moment arm
to compute the assistive moment during hip flexion. The
biological joint moments produced during the EXO_ON

 condition were then calculated by subtracting the mo-
ment generated by the exosuit at the ankle (or hip)
from the net joint moment at the ankle (or hip) as per
[29]. Biological moment was then multiplied by joint
velocity to obtain biological power (Fig. 4e). Lastly, bio-
logical
positive
and
negative
joint
work
for
the
EXO_ON condition were calculated for the ankle and
the hip joints of the right leg by integrating over time
the positive and negative corresponding biological powers.
For the EXO_OFF_EMR and the EXO_OFF conditions,
positive and negative biological work were calculated by
inverse dynamics.
Statistical methods
Statistical analysis was conducted in SPSS (SPSS Inc.,
Statistics21, USA). One-way repeated measures analyses
of variance (ANOVA) with three modes (EXO_OFF_EMR,
EXO_OFF and EXO_ON) were used to verify the effect of
the device on metabolic power and on the average muscle
activation across the stride. The biomechanical variables
of interest included: peak flexion and extension joint
angles and moments, as well as absorbed and generated
joint power (positive and negative area of the power trace
curves) at the ankle, knee and hip. Additional one-way
repeated measures ANOVA were conducted on positive

identify differences between conditions when a statisti-
cally significant main effect was identified by the
ANOVA. The significance level was set at p < 0.05 for
all analyses. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s
d method.
Results
Metabolic cost and muscle activity
Average metabolic power during standing with a load
equivalent to 30 % of each participant’s body mass
was, on average, 1.6 ± 0.3 W kg−1. Net metabolic
power was, on average, 7.9 ± 0.8 W kg−1, 7.5 ± 0.6 W kg−1,
and 8.5 ± 0.9 W kg−1 during the EXO_OFF_EMR, the
EXO_ON, and the EXO_OFF conditions, respectively. Net
metabolic power for the EXO_ON condition was 7.3 ±
5.0 % (p = 0.027; ES = 0.57) and 14.2 ± 6.1 % (p = 0.005;
ES = 1.31) lower than in the EXO_OFF_EMR and for
the EXO_OFF conditions, respectively. This resulted in
a significant metabolic power reduction during the
EXO_ON condition of 35.2 ± 23.0 W (p = 0.020; ES = 0.63)
and 74.8 ± 33.6 W (p = 0.003; ES = 1.36) with respect to
the EXO_OFF_EMR and to the EXO_OFF condition, re-
spectively (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, for every 1 J of exosuit
positive mechanical work generated, participants saved,
on average, 1.8 J of metabolic energy. Each participant’s
metabolic power during the three test conditions is
presented in Additional file 1: Table S2.
Significantly lower average muscle activation (4.7 ±
7.0 %) was reported in the vastus lateralis for the
EXO_OFF_EMR condition with respect to the EXO_OFF
condition (p = 0.005; ES = 0.47). Significantly lower aver-
age muscle activation (8.4 ± 9.8 %) was also reported in
the soleus for the EXO_ON condition with respect to
the EXO_OFF condition (p = 0.025; ES = 0.50). No main
effect of muscle activation was reported for the six other
lower limb muscles investigated. Muscle activations dur-
ing the three conditions of testing are presented in Fig. 6
and in Additional file 1: Table S3.
Spatio-temporal parameters
Stride length, stride frequency, duty factor and stance and
swing times were not significantly different between the
three testing conditions. A complete overview of these
parameters is presented in Additional file 1: Table S4.
Joints kinematics
Significantly lower peak ankle dorsi-flexion angle was
reported in the EXO_ON condition with respect to the
EXO_OFF_EMR (p = 0.001; ES = 0.93) and the EXO_OFF
(p = 0.002; ES = 0.81) conditions. Additionally, a signifi-
cantly lower knee flexion angle peak was reported in the
beginning of the stance phase in the EXO_ON condition
with respect to the EXO_OFF_EMR (p = 0.012; ES = 0.36)
and to the EXO_OFF (p = 0.015; ES = 0.40) conditions. No
other significant differences were reported in kinematics
(Fig. 7). A complete overview of joint kinematics data is
presented in Additional file 1: Table S5.
Joint kinetics
The only statistically significant differences in joint mo-
ments (Fig. 7), were a lower peak knee extension moment
in the EXO_ON condition with respect to the EXO_OFF
condition (p = 0.011; ES = 0.51) and a higher knee flexion
moment peak in the EXO_ON condition with respect to

higher ankle power generation was reported for the
EXO_ON condition with respect to the EXO_OFF_EMR
(p = 0.016; ES = 1.45) and to the EXO_OFF (p = 0.005;
ES = 1.07) conditions. Additionally, significantly lower
knee power absorption was reported in the EXO_ON con-
dition with respect to the EXO_OFF condition (p = 0.003;
ES = 0.87) and between the EXO_OFF_EMR condition
and the EXO_OFF condition (p = 0.018; ES = 0.59). A
complete overview of the joint kinetics data is presented
in Additional file 1: Table S5.
Biological joint work and power
Average peak forces generated by the exosuit across the
seven participants were 272 ± 43 N of ankle plantarflexion,
204 ± 32 N of hip flexion, and 68 ± 24 N of hip extension.
These external forces caused a significant reduction of total
joint biological positive work (sum of hip, knee, and ankle)
when comparing the EXO_ON condition with respect to
the EXO_OFF condition (1.28 ± 0.26 J kg−1; p = 0.020;
ES = 1.02) and to the EXO_OFF_EMR condition (1.22 ±
0.21 J kg−1; p = 0.007; ES = 0.86). Further, hip biological
positive work was significantly reduced in the EXO_ON
condition
with
respect
to
the
EXO_OFF
condition
(p = 0.011; ES = 1.18) and to the EXO_OFF_EMR condi-
tion (p = 0.007; ES = 1.25), and ankle biological positive
work was significantly reduced in the EXO_ON condition
with respect to the EXO_OFF condition (p = 0.035;
ES = 0.99). Total joint biological negative work was not

 nevertheless, knee biological negative work was signifi-
cantly reduced in the EXO_ON condition with respect to
the EXO_OFF condition (p = 0.003; ES = 0.82).
Similarly, total joint biological positive power (sum of
hip, knee, and ankle) was significantly reduced when
comparing the EXO_ON (1.02 ± 0.10 W kg−1) with
respect to the EXO_OFF condition (1.21 ± 0.19 W kg−1;
p = 0.009; ES = 1.25) and to the EXO_OFF_EMR condi-
tion (1.16 ± 0.15 W kg−1; p = 0.007; ES = 1.10). Hip bio-
logical positive power was significantly reduced in the
EXO_ON condition with respect to the EXO_OFF condi-
tion (p = 0.001; ES = 1.21) and to the EXO_OFF_EMR con-
dition (p = 0.011; ES = 1.21), and ankle biological positive
power was significantly reduced in the EXO_ON condition
with respect to the EXO_OFF condition (p = 0.044;
ES = 1.13). Total joint biological negative power was
not significantly different between the three conditions.
Knee biological negative power was significantly reduced
in the EXO_ON condition with respect to the EXO_OFF
condition (p = 0.004; ES = 1.20) and in the EXO_OFF
condition with respect to the EXO_OFF_EMR condition
(p = 0.020; ES = 0.85) (Fig. 5b).
Discussion
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an au-
tonomous (fully portable) multi-joint soft exosuit on the

 metabolic cost of loaded walking. A net reduction in the
metabolic cost was reported while walking with the exosuit
compared to wearing the exoskeleton unpowered with ef-
fective mass removed. This finding (Fig. 5a) represents the
first successful attempt to effectively reduce the metabolic
burden experienced by load carriers with an untethered soft
exosuit. In addition, this work also represents the first suc-
cessful attempt to reduce the metabolic cost of walking
with a multi-joint untethered wearable robot of any kind.
Recent work from two different research groups [30, 31]
also demonstrated an augmentation of human walking by
means of autonomous ankle exoskeletons. These two stud-
ies reported average reductions in metabolic cost of 11 ±
4 % and 7.2 ± 2.6 %, respectively, when the ankle joint was
assisted during unloaded walking. An additional study [32]
also reported an average reduction of 8 ± 3 % in metabolic
cost during loaded walking using a device similar to [30].
Although the magnitude of metabolic reduction observed
with the soft exosuit was similar to that reported by these
recent studies, differences in our approach to augmenting
human performance should be considered when comparing
systems and outcomes. Indeed, [30, 32] actively provided
assistance at the ankle joint only and delivered higher levels
than we did with the soft exosuit at the ankle. This early
embodiment of the soft exosuit and actuation units limited
the maximum force that could be delivered to the wearer.
However, by exploiting the legs being out of phase and tim-
ing synergy between hip flexion and ankle plantarflexion
we developed an actuation scheme by which a single motor
per leg could be used to assist multiple joints, enabling us
to minimize system mass and distal mass in particular. Earl-
ier work on multi-joint systems [9, 33, 34] did not report
reductions in the metabolic cost of walking, likely due to
high device mass.
As expected, the EXO_ON condition produced a larger
reduction in metabolic cost when compared to the
EXO_OFF condition than to the EXO_OFF_EMR condi-
tion. Although the relationship between muscle-tendon
behavior and whole body energy consumption is com-
plex [25], we hypothesized that the underlying physio-
logical mechanisms regulating this interaction could be
more pronounced in a EXO_ON vs EXO_OFF comparison
and concealed, at least in part, by the additional load im-
posed by the system in the EXO_OFF_EMR condition.
Walking with the powered device did not alter partici-
pants’ spatio-temporal parameters, indicating that the exo-
suit’s assistive forces were not disruptive to participants’
freely-selected step frequencies and step lengths. Neverthe-
less, some alterations in participants’ kinematics and kinet-
ics were present. Given the aforementioned finding of
reduced metabolic cost during walking, we posit that these
changes may have permitted the musculoskeletal system to
operate more efficiently. Indeed, considering that ankle
dorsiflexion and knee flexion have been shown to increase
with an increase of load [5], our observed reduction of
these two parameters in the EXO_ON condition suggests
that the exosuit facilitated a return to gait patterns that
resemble unloaded walking [5].
Walking with the soft exosuit reduced the total bio-
logical joint work produced by the lower limbs, and the
most marked reduction in biological work production
was at the hip joint. This reduction is of particular inter-
est especially considering that the hip joint seems to
have lower efficiency compared with the other lower
limb joints [35]. This hypothesis is also supported by the
fact that muscles crossing the hip have a reduced penna-
tion angle and a longer fiber length than those crossing
the ankle [36, 37]. This architectural difference, together
with a shorter tendon, makes the elastic recoil of the hip
muscle-tendon complex less effective compared to that
of the ankle [35]. Consequently, work production at the
hip during walking is more costly than at the ankle.
Based on this rationale and our previous work [20], it
seems possible that unloading the hip joint by means of
our multi-joint exosuit could have resulted in a more ef-
fective energy saving strategy. Nevertheless, only future
experimental studies decoupling the effect of the assist-
ance for each joint could provide further elucidation on
this point.
Although the main reduction in the biological work was
reported at the hip, the knee and ankle may also have con-
tributed to lowering the metabolic burden. Interestingly,
the assistance provided by the soft exosuit reduced knee
extension moments (Fig. 7) with an associated reduction
in negative biological work. The knee mainly functions as
a shock absorber during level ground walking [23], with
the muscles spanning this joint performing mostly eccen-
tric contractions [35]. This behavior is exaggerated during
load carriage [3] and, although this type of contraction is
more economical than an isometric or a concentric con-
traction [38], it is still associated with a metabolic cost.
Therefore, the reduction in negative biological work at the
knee may have contributed to a lower metabolic cost as
well. Although the multi-articular textile load path does
pass approximately through the center of the knee joint, it
is possible that a small level of assistance was applied at
the knee. However, given this, another hypothesis for the
reduced work at the knee related to the assistance of the
contralateral ankle joint can be presented, according to
[39]. Contralateral ankle assistance is synchronized with
the negative work generation at the knee during the gait
cycle. An augmented push-off on the contralateral limb
could have been beneficial to lower the load at the knee
joint. To support this explanation, a higher ankle moment
exhibited in the EXO_ON condition during push-off cor-
responded to a lower knee moment on the contralateral
limb during weight acceptance (Fig. 7), similar to what has
previously been reported by [39]. Moreover, a similar
Panizzolo et al. Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation  (2016) 13:43 
Page 10 of 13
 trend was present in positive ankle work during push-off
and in the negative knee work on the contralateral limb
during weight acceptance. Decreased production of bio-
logical ankle work was also reported in the EXO_ON condi-
tion with respect to the EXO_OFF condition. It can be
assumed that the ankle joint also contributed to the meta-
bolic reduction and this rationale can be supported by the
reduced soleus activation in the EXO_ON condition with
respect to the EXO_OFF condition. The reason this was
not found when comparing the EXO_ON and EXO_OF-
F_EMR conditions may have been that the effect was
masked by the wearer having to carry the increased mass of
the device.
Surprisingly, despite the fact that biological work
was significantly reduced, only small differences were
found in muscle activation between conditions (Fig. 6).
Reported variations of kinematics and kinetics may
have been linked to changes in the functional proper-
ties of the muscles rather than simply being the result
of reduced muscle activation. Although from a joint-
level kinematics analysis it is impossible to decouple
the individual behaviors of the tendon and muscle,
these alterations might have been the result of muscle
fascicles working in a more economical region of
their force-length relationship. Previous work on an
ankle exoskeleton designed for hopping [40], revealed
adaptive changes in the fascicle length of the soleus
associated with a reduction in metabolic cost. Never-
theless, at this stage this hypothesis remains specula-
tive and only future work examining in vivo muscle
properties could unravel the underlying specific muscle
mechanism.
The observed variability in the reduction of meta-
bolic cost between participants may be due to several
contributing
factors.
The
fixed
external
assistance
across participants coupled with small variations in
how the exosuit fit to different body sizes and shapes
resulted in variations in the percentage of the deliv-
ered assistance relative to nominal biological joint torques
at the hip and ankle. In addition, small variations in
how the multi-articular load path crossed the knee
may have resulted in small torques at the knee joint
for
some
participants.
Additionally,
neuromuscular
adaptation associated with the use of wearable robots
remains an active research area [41], with little to no
work done on loaded walking, and inter-individual
adaptations may have contributed to the variation in
our findings across subjects.
Based on the results of this study, we believe that
there is potential for further enhancing the exosuit’s
performance. First, it should be noted that the joint
torques applied by the exosuit to the wearer were
relatively low compared to the joint moments experi-
enced by load carriers [3]. This was mainly due to
the significant compliance in the textile component of
the exosuit and its interface to the wearer. In recent
work
we
have
demonstrated
that
higher
assistive
forces can be delivered that both the ankle and hip
with improvements to suit components and actuation
units, demonstrating metabolic reductions up to 8.5
and 15 % respectively when assisting only hip exten-
sion and ankle plantarflexion with a multi-articular
load path similar to that described in this work [42, 43].
These advances are driven by a more rigorous ap-
proach
to
soft
exosuit
component
evaluation and
characterization as we describe in [24, 44]. We be-
lieve that this will pave the way for future autono-
mous single and multi-joint soft exosuits that reduce
the energy cost of both loaded and unloaded walking.
Second, for the multi-joint exosuit presented in this
paper, the timing for hip extension assistance was de-
termined using sensor information from the ankle
joint of the contralateral limb (as described in Additional
file 1: Text S1). This limited the ability to precisely control
how assistance was applied during hip extension, as dem-
onstrated by the increased variability in the averaged
torque profiles (Fig. 4) both for a given participant and
across participants. To address this, we are developing
new control approaches for the hip [42] and ankle [43]
that provide more repeatable forces using inertial sensors
located at each individual joint.
Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that an autonomous soft exo-
suit can reduce the metabolic burden experienced by
load carriers, possibly augmenting their overall gait per-
formance. Although many basic fundamental research
and development challenges remain in actuator develop-
ment, textile innovation, sensing and control, this proof
of concept study provides the first demonstration of a
soft wearable robot to augment gait. This work also pre-
sented the first demonstration that an autonomous
multi-joint wearable robot can achieve a metabolic re-
duction. Future studies will be necessary to explore the
effects of assisting walking with a soft exosuit and ex-
plore if, for a given level of mechanical work, the most
effective approach to providing assistance is by augment-
ing the function of a single joint or multiple joints.
Moreover, the realization of devices that assist joints
other than the ankle can increase the knowledge on the
determinants of energy cost, potentially revealing differ-
ent adaptive mechanisms of the musculoskeletal system.
Finally, apart from assisting load carriers, we are explor-
ing how the soft exosuit can be used as a platform to as-
sist individuals with compromised ability to produce
adequate forces during locomotion [45], paving the way
for many translational opportunities of this technology
across a range of different populations.
