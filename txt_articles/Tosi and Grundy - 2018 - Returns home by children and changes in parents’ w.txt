Co-resident adult children may be a source of emotional and instrumental support for older parents, but also a
source of conflict and stress. Results from previous research are far from conclusive and indicate that inter-
generational co-residence may have both negative and positive effects on parents' depressive symptoms and
physical health. We analyse longitudinal data from four waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in
Europe (2007-2015) to examine whether returns to the parental home by adult children are associated with
changes in the quality of life of parents aged 50-75. Results from fixed effects linear regression models show that
returns to the parental home by adult children were associated with decreases in parents' quality of life and that
this largely reflected declines associated with the return of a child to an ‘empty nest’ where no other children
were still co-resident. In line with previous research which has indicated differing effects of co-residence on
parents' depressive symptoms by cultural tradition, this effect was largely driven by decreases in parents' quality
of life in a grouping of Nordic/social-democratic. There were no associations between changes in parental
quality of life and the returning child's characteristics, although unemployment of a child was negatively, and
new partnership of a child, positively associated with changes in parental quality of life.
1. Introduction
Over the past half century, intergenerational co-residence has de-
clined dramatically in Western countries (Da Vanzo and Goldscheider,
1990; Grundy, 2000). However, this pattern has recently altered, and in
some countries multigenerational co-residence has increased; a shift
interpreted as a family response to high unemployment rates, poor job
prospects and financial hardship among young adults (Mykyta and
Macartney, 2012). Adult children's increasing need for family support
has led to renewed interest in causes of and trends in intergenerational
co-residence. Many studies have examined the determinants of leaving
and returning to the parental home (Billari and Liefbroer, 2007; Stone
et al., 2014) and there is also a large and growing literature on possible
implications of intergenerational co-residence for the well-being of both
younger and older generations (Russell, 2009; Silverstein et al., 2006).
With some exceptions (Aranda, 2015; Maruyama, 2012) most of these
previous studies are cross-sectional and focus on the effects of inter-
generational co-residence on older parents' depressive symptoms or
physical health status. Some indicate a positive impact of co-residence
with adult children on parents' well-being (Aranda, 2015; Courtin and
Avendano, 2016 [Europe]; Do and Malhotra, 2012 [South Korea];
Teerawichitchainan et al., 2015 [Vietnam and Thailand]; Zunzunegui
et al., 2001 [Spain]), whereas others have found that older parents
living with children have worse physical health (Johar and Maruyama,
2014 [Indonesia]; Maruyama, 2012 [Japan]) and more depressive
symptoms (Lowenstein and Katz, 2005 [Israel]; Aquilino and Supple,
1991; Mitchell and Gee, 1996; Russell and Taylor, 2009; Silverstein and
Bengtson, 1994; Umberson and Gove, 1989 [U.S.]). These varying
findings suggest that implications of intergenerational co-residence for
parental well-being may vary considerably depending on whether co-
residence is a response to parental or to children's needs, whether it
reflects continuation of an existing living arrangement or a change for
one or other generation, as well as by cultural and institutional context.
There are several alternative pathways to intergenerational co-re-
sidence between older parents and adult children. Adult children may
have never left home, may have returned home because of their own
needs for support or in some cases returned to meet the support needs
of parents in need of help and care. In this paper we focus on one of
these pathways– returns by an adult child to the parental home when
parents are relatively young. We use longitudinal data to examine how
this impacts changes in parents' Quality of Life (QoL) as a broader in-
dicator of parents’ well-being including feelings of control, autonomy,
pleasure and self-realization in everyday life (Connell et al., 2014; Hyde
et al., 2003).
Apart from any intrinsic effect of intergenerational co-residence,
returns to the parental home – also known as boomerang moves

T
 (Mitchell, 2006) – may be associated with declines in parents’ QoL,
because of a violation of normative expectations that children should be
successfully launched into adulthood (Aquilino and Supple, 1991;
Pillemer et al., 2012; South and Lei, 2015; Shanahan, 2000). Ward and
Spitze (2007) suggest that such counter-transitions may have negative
consequences for parent-child relationships when they are perceived by
parents as indicating a lack of autonomy or unwarranted dependency
by children.
Returns to the parental home may be especially stressful for parents,
when they result in a disruption of the normative empty nest. Previous
studies have shown that parental life satisfaction increases as adult
children leave the family nest and achieve adult status (White and
Edwards, 1990; Pillemer et al., 2012; VanLaningham et al., 2001). A
reverse (negative) effect might be exerted by adult children refilling an
empty nest (Ward and Spitze, 2004). Home returning may thus be re-
lated to a decline in parents' QoL to a greater extent, or only, when all
other children have also left home. However, some parents may wel-
come adult children returning home and enjoy sharing experiences and
daily activities under the same roof (Aquilino and Supple, 1991).
Boomerang children may be an important source of support and com-
pany for parents living in an empty nest, which would suggest a positive
association between returns in the parental home and parents’ QoL.
1.1. Processes behind boomerang moves
Home returning behaviours are often affected by other life course
transitions, including changes in economic resources, such as un-
employment; changes in family circumstances, such as partnership
breakdown; or deterioration in the physical or mental health of the
child (South and Lei, 2015). New economic constraints, such as job loss
or income reduction, increase the need for intergenerational support
and are related to children's decision to move back to the parental home
(Kleinepier et al., 2017; Sandberg-Thoma et al., 2015; Smits et al.,
2010; Wiemers, 2014). Economic difficulties and temporary instability
prompt returns to the parental home, particularly among young adults
who leave education to find a position in the labour market (Stone
et al., 2011, 2014). Similarly, union dissolution may prompt a return to
the parental home as a possible solution to economic, housing, and
emotional problems arising from the event (Arundel and Lennartz,
2017;
Gram-Hanssen
and
Bech-Danielsen,
2008;
Guzzo,
2016;
Michielin et al., 2008; South and Lei, 2015). Emotional distress and
mental health problems per se make the transition to adulthood more
difficult and are correlated with boomerang moves (Sandberg-Thoma
et al., 2015).
For parents these events in a child's life may be distressing in
themselves, regardless of whether or not they result in the child's return
home. The notion of linked lives suggests that parents tend to suffer
when they see their children suffer, and previous studies have indicated
that children's exposure to problematic and stressful experiences are
associated with a decline in parents' well-being and mental health
(Elder et al., 2003; Fingerman et al., 2012; Greenfield and Marks, 2006;
Kalmijn and De Graaf, 2012; Knoester, 2003; Milkie et al., 2008;
Pillemer et al., 2017). It has been also shown that job loss and family
break-ups are factors that exacerbate the negative consequences of
living together on parents' well-being, life satisfaction and marital re-
lationship quality (Aquilino and Supple, 1991; Copp et al., 2017; Davis
et al., 2016).
1.2. European context
Variations in preferences, attitudes and family norms across
European regions suggest that returns to the parental home may have
diverse impacts on parents’ well-being (Grundy and Murphy, 2017).
Returning home may countervail expectations about a normal devel-
opmental path, especially in some Western and Nordic societies where
self-achievement and autonomy are valued. However, this may be not
the case in Southern and Eastern European countries where family at-
titudes are more conservative and are linked to values stressing family
interdependence and traditional roles (Inglehart, 2015; Duncan and Pfau-
Effinger, 2012; Jappens and Van Bavel, 2012; Reher, 1998).
Cultural traditions interact with political and economic institutions.
In Nordic countries, and other countries deemed ‘social-democratic’ in
some discourses on welfare state typologies, welfare systems provide
services and supports that cushion some of the impact of events such as
illness or unemployment arguably making practical support from the
family less critical (Anttonen et al., 2003; Esping-Andersen, 1990).
State or state facilitated provision of income, housing and care support
systems facilitates the residential independence of young and old gen-
erations (Oinonen, 2008). In Southern and Eastern Europe, by com-
parison, the supply of state support is much less generous and parents
may expect to provide support to adult children who need it through co-
residence. For example, there is evidence for some Southern countries
that weak public support systems along with high levels of home-
ownership and restricted rental markets are associated with delays in
home leaving and with returns home (Albertini et al., 2017; Tosi, 2017;
Mulder and Billari, 2010). In former Eastern bloc countries the erosion
of welfare states following the collapse of the Soviet Union has been
associated with an increase in intergenerational co-residence; and, it is
argued, a resurgence of familistic values (Mair, 2013).
The economic recession of the last decade has increased young
adults' needs for family support and in some countries has been asso-
ciated with higher rates of intergenerational co-residence (Aassve et al.,
2013). Economic hardship which generally has negative impacts on
people’ QoL, may affect young adults’ decision to return home, parti-
cularly in countries such as Greece where the crisis had more severe
consequences.
In this paper we investigate whether there is a negative (adverse)
association between boomerang moves and parent's QoL; whether any
such association varies across European regions and varies according to
whether the adult child returns to an ‘empty nest’ or a household in-
cluding other co-resident children. We also analyse whether antecedent
or concomitant transitions by the child into unemployment and di-
vorce/separation moderate any association between boomerang moves
and changes in parent's QoL.
2. Data and methods
2.1. Data and sample
We used data from four waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and
Retirement in Europe (SHARE). This is a cross-national population re-
presentative longitudinal survey. Information about individuals aged
fifty years or older and their partner – independently of his/her age –
were gathered in 2007 (wave 2), 2011 (wave 4), 2013 (wave 5) and
2015 (wave 6). Respondents were interviewed in multiple waves, but
the sample was also refreshed to keep it representative of the ageing
population at each wave. Although representative, the sample size is
not proportional to the population living in each country (weighted
results available upon request). We excluded the first wave from the
analysis because indicators of parents’ QoL were collected through a
self-completion (“drop off”) questionnaire including a high proportion
of missing values (about 36%) and a low response rate (less than 50%).
The third wave collected retrospective life history data and lacked in-
formation on variables of interest here. The initial household response
rate in wave 2 was 54% (Börsch-Supan et al., 2013) and only 61% of
these respondents also participated in the last interview. The attrition
rate was 33% between waves 2 and 4, 21% between waves 4 and 5, and
20% between waves 5 and 6. Attrition was particularly high in Ger-
many and the Czech Republic (about 60%), and low in Denmark (about
30%), while the household response rate was particularly low (< 40%)
in Belgium and Switzerland.
SHARE gathered detailed information for up to five children living

100
 inside or outside the household (about 98% of the overall population).
We used the reported sex and date of birth of each child to link chil-
dren's information and follow the same child across waves. In our
sample we included people aged 50-75 who had at least one child living
outside the parental home at baseline. We chose this upper age limit in
order to reduce the chance that home returning was driven by parents'
support needs as intergenerational co-residence of frail elderly parents
and caregiving children may have different implications for parents'
QoL. We restricted the sample to parents who were present in at least
two waves as our outcome of interest was change in quality of life. We
also excluded 3080 respondents not living in their country of origin as
migrant parents may have different levels of well-being and different
cultural views about intergenerational co-residence. The final sample
includes data from 17 countries. Drawing on previous research cultural
roots, attitudes and welfare regimes, in some analyses we divided
countries into four groups: a Southern European grouping (Italy, Spain,
Portugal and Greece), a former Eastern bloc cluster (Slovenia, Czech
Republic Estonia, and Poland), a Western European group (Austria,
France, Luxemburg, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland) and a Nordic
group (the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark). In additional sensi-
tivity analyses we also undertook some analyses for different subgroups
of countries.
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Quality of life
The indicator of quality of life used was the CASP-12; a short version
of the original 19 item version (CASP-19). CASP is a validated measure
of quality of life and well-being derived from a theory of human needs
comprising four life domains: ‘control’, ‘autonomy’, ‘pleasure’ and ‘self-
realization’ (Hyde et al., 2003; Sim et al., 2011). The shortened 12-item
scale combines the life domains ‘control and autonomy’ and has been
recommended in previous research as appropriate to measure quality of
life among people aged 50 or over (Wiggins et al., 2008). The scale is
based on 12 indicators and ranges from 12 to 48, with higher scores
indicating better quality of life.
2.2.2. Independent variables
The main independent variable referring to returns to the parental
home was derived from a question about parent-child geographical
proximity. In two parent households, questions about children's char-
acteristics were asked of one of the two parents (the family respondent)
who replied on behalf of both. The variable was set equal to one when a
parent reported that a specific child was living outside the parental
home at baseline but was co-resident at follow-up. Respondents who
had a returning child were then excluded from the sample after the
event, thus excluding reverse transitions (children leaving the parental
home) from the estimates. We excluded cases where parents changed
accommodation between waves (n = 139) as in this case it might be the
parent who moved to the child's home. We also created a dichotomous
variable indicating whether or not parents had any co-resident child at
baseline as we wished to see if the effects on parental well-being varied
depending on whether a child returned to an empty or a partially full
nest.
As noted above, parents' well-being may be influenced by the status
of their children, whether or not they return home. In order to allow for
this, we included four dummy variables in the analysis indicated
whether or not parents had at least one child who was (i) unemployed,
(ii) in education, (iii) married or partnered, or (iv) divorced or sepa-
rated. In a further step, we distinguished between children's returns to
the parental home occurring when they were employed, unemployed,
or not in the labour force, and when they were partnered, never mar-
ried, or divorced/separated. The reference group refers to parents who
had no children returning home. We considered employment and
marital status measured before the move of the child back to the par-
ental home, because the status prior to the move is more likely to
capture the actual reason for returning home. We also distinguished
between children who had left the parental home less than six years and
at least six years before returning home. A reasoning for this distinction
is that returns to co-residence may be seen as a violation of normative
expectations to a greater extent when they occur many years after the
transition out of the parental home.
2.2.3. Other covariates
Although children's needs are usually more important than parents'
ones in predicting boomerang moves (Smits et al., 2010), in some cases
parental support needs, such as poor health, may also prompt co-re-
sidence. As health is also strongly associated with QoL (Blane et al.,
2008) we included four covariates related to health status of the par-
ents. These were: number of chronic diseases (0-10); number of mobi-
lity limitations (0-10); one or more limitations in activities of daily
living (ADL); one or more limitations in instrumental activities of daily
living (IADL). Respondents answered these questions about health
conditions individually. Difficulties with everyday activities (ADL) in-
cluded in the questionnaire were related to dressing, eating, using the
toilet, bathing and showering, getting in and out of bed, and walking
across a room; while instrumental activities (IADLs) referred to pre-
paring a hot meal, shopping for groceries, making telephone calls,
taking medications, and managing money. Health indicators were to
some extent correlated with each other, and thus we checked our results
using an index of health conditions. The items were treated as con-
tinuous variables – indicating the number of ADL, IADL, mobility lim-
itations and chronic diseases – and were combined into an index
(Cronbach's alpha = 0.67) by adopting a principal component analysis
and weighting each item for its factor loading. We found similar results
to those presented in the text below.
Becoming widowed may be associated with both children's returns
to the parental home and parental QoL (Bond et al., 2003). Retirement
may also be associated with changes in parental QoL and probability of
a child returning home. We therefore included parent's age, marital and
employment status as additional covariates. Marital status was treated
as a categorical variable distinguishing between the currently part-
nered, the divorced/separated/never married, and the widowed. A di-
chotomized variable was derived to identify those who retired from the
labour market during the observation window.
2.3. Empirical model
We used fixed effects linear regression models in order to estimate
the association between changes in living arrangements and changes in
parent's QoL. The estimates were based on within-individual variation,
and thus, although 99,000 observations were included in the sample,
the coefficient related to boomerang moves was estimated on 1070
transitions (see Table 1). The advantage of this modelling strategy is
that it controls for time-invariant observed and unobserved character-
istics, for example, previous history of family relationships which might
influence children's decision to return home and parent's QoL. Between-
country differences are accounted for, under the assumption of parallel
intercepts.
We examined the pooled sample of mothers and fathers because
preliminary results showed no gender differences in the association
between boomerang moves and parent's QoL. Since there was a corre-
lation between partners' QoL, we used cluster-robust standard errors to
take account of this intra-household correlation (Wooldridge, 2003).
Although we observed a skewed distribution of CASP score, diagnostic
analyses for our fixed effects models showed that the residual dis-
tribution did not violate the normality assumption (at 95% level).
We analysed unbalanced panel data where the number of waves as
well as the time between waves vary remarkably across individuals and
countries. To account for this, we derived the number of months that
respondents spent in the observation window from the date of the first
interview. This variable served to control for the length of the time

101
 between waves.
2.4. Analytical strategy
After a brief description of the sample characteristics, we present
results from the fixed effects linear regression models. In the first
model, we analysed the main association between home returning and
changes in parent's QoL, net of parents' and children's characteristics. In
the second model, we added an interaction term between having a child
move back and having other children living at home. We tested whether
returns to an empty nest had a stronger association with changes in
parent's QoL, compared to boomerang moves when other children were
co-resident. In models 3, 4 and 5, we analysed children's characteristics
which may underlie reasons for moving back home as time spent by a
returning child outside the family of origin as well as his or her em-
ployment and marital status might moderate the association between
returns home and parent's QoL. Finally, we fitted separate models for
Nordic, Western, Southern and Eastern European countries, and then
we tested whether the association between returns to the parental home
and parent's QoL was significantly different in these contexts.
3. Results
3.1. Sample description
Table 1 provides descriptive information on the study sample.
Parent's QoL was on average equal to 38.3 (SD = 5.9) on a scale ran-
ging from 12 to 48. QoL increased on average by 0.08 points over time
with a standard deviation of five points. Only two per cent of parents
aged 50-75 had a child moving back to live with them. The second
panel in Table 1 shows that adult children who returned to the parental
home were on average aged thirty-six years old and about forty per cent
of them were daughters. Among boomerang children, 71% were em-
ployed, 12% unemployed and 17% out of the labour force. Most chil-
dren moving back home (about 56%) were never married, while only
twelve per cent were divorced or separated. Over 40% of children had
left the parental home no more than five years before returning home.
About one-tenth of parents had at least one unemployed child and/
or one in education, while 7% and 3% of parents had a child who be-
came unemployed or a student respectively. Reverse transitions out of
unemployment and education were relatively more frequent, and more
than half of parents with unemployed or student children had at least
one who found a job or left education. Most parents (76%) had at least
one child living with a partner, while only 16% of them had a divorced
child. About one-quarter of parents had a child who got married and 5%
had a child who became divorced.
3.2. Returning home and parent's quality of life
Table 2 presents the results of fixed effects linear regression models,
where we estimated the association between returning home and
changes in parent's QoL. Model 1 shows that parent's QoL decreased
when an adult child moved back to live with them. This association

 held after controlling for children's transitions into unemployment,
education, partnership, and divorce/separation. Parents' QoL score
decreased by 0.28 points when one of their children became un-
employed. By contrast, parents experienced an increase in QoL when a
child got married or started cohabiting with a partner. There were no
associations between children's transition to divorce/separation and
changes in parent's QoL. With regard to parents' health conditions, in-
dicators considered in the analysis were associated with changes in
parents' QoL in the expected direction. Increases in number of chronic
diseases and mobility limitations as well as starting to have limitation
(s) in daily and instrumental activities exerted a significant influence in
reducing parents' QoL.
In the second model, we added an interaction term between having
at least one child living in the parental home at baseline and having a
returning child. The coefficient related to the interaction term is posi-
tive, indicating that the negative association between boomerang
moves and parent's QoL was lower when another child was living in the
parental home. Parent's QoL decreased if children returned to an empty
nest, whereas there was no association between returns to the parental
home and changes in parent's QoL when other children still lived at
home. The size of the coefficients suggests that parent's QoL declined as
a child refilled the nest (Coef. = -0.88) to a similar extent as having at
least one limitation in instrumental activities (Coef. = -0.87). A like-
lihood-ratio test confirmed that the second model had a better fit
compared to the first one (LR test = 17.7; p-value < .001).
3.3. Movers’ characteristics
In Table 3 we analysed whether the association between returning
home and changes in parent's QoL was moderated by characteristics of
the boomerang child. Model 3 shows that declines in parent's QoL were
associated with boomerang moves when the mover was unemployed,
while there were no associations in case of employed and inactive
movers. The size of the coefficients would suggest that boomerang
moves due to unemployment (Coef. = -0.98) were strongly associated
with parent's QoL, compared to other returns associated with an active
(Coef. = -0.28) or an inactive (Coef. = -0.33) positions in the labour
market. However, we formally compared the coefficients using the
Wald test and the results indicated that there were no differences be-
tween coefficients related to employed, unemployed and inactive chil-
dren. Similarly, Model 4 indicates that parent's QoL declined as the
child who moved back in with them was never married. But the coef-
ficients correlated to partnered (Coef. = -0.42) and never married
(Coef. = -0.45) children were very similar to each other, suggesting
that children's partnership did not affect the association between re-
turns to the parental home and changes in parents' QoL. The Wald test
confirmed that there were no differences between coefficients.
In model 5 we examined whether the association between boom-
erang moves and parents' QoL was influenced by the time the returning
child had spent outside the parental home. The results suggest that
parents' QoL decreased when one of their children moved back after six
or more years of independent living, while there was no association
when a child returned home after a shorter period. However, the Wald
test indicated that the difference between the coefficients related to
short and long-term moves was not significant. Additional analyses
revealed no differences by movers’ age and sex.
3.4. European differences
Table 4 presents separate models for Nordic, Western, Southern and
Eastern European countries. We found that in Nordic European coun-
tries parent's QoL decreased as a child moved back whereas returns to
the parental home were not associated with changes in parents' QoL in
the other parts of Europe. We also tested whether these differences
between country clusters were significant, by including an interaction
term between returning home and country group in the analysis. The
results of the overall model in Table 4 indicate that decreases in parent's
QoL were associated with boomerang moves to a greater extent in
Nordic than in Western, Southern and Eastern Europe.
3.5. Robustness checks
We carried out a number of sensitivity analyses to check the ro-
bustness of our results. One of them was performed including lagged (t-
1) dummy variables for boomerang moves occurring in short (1 or 2
years between waves) and long term (more than 2 years between
waves). This allowed us to test the anticipation effect of returning home
on parent's QoL: parent's well-being might decline before a child's re-
turn in response to unobserved events related to home-returning be-
haviour. For example, mental health problems of a child might affect
both the decision to return to the parental home (Sandberg-Thoma
et al., 2015) and the well-being of parents (Knoester, 2003). An an-
ticipation effect might be also be due to reverse causality when children
return to the parental home as a result of a decline in parent's QoL.
However, the results presented in Table 5 show that there were no
anticipation effects and the results were similar to those presented
above. Returns to the parental home were associated with a decline in
parent's QoL when the returning child refilled the nest. Model 8 shows
that this association was stronger in Nordic than in other European
regions, in spite of a marginally significant anticipation effect.
4. Discussion
Previous research has investigated various aspects of associations
between intergenerational co-residence and parents' mental and phy-
sical health (Grundy and Murphy, 2017; Lowenstein and Katz, 2005;
Maruyama, 2012; Zunzunegui et al., 2001). Two recent studies have
shed new light on this association, indicating that co-residing with an
adult child is negatively related to parents' depressive symptoms in

 Europe (Aranda, 2015; Courtin and Avendano, 2016) but with some
geographic variation. In this paper, we extended this literature by
analysing a specific pathway to co-residence – boomerang moves – and
its association with changes in parent's quality of life. We found that
parents' experienced a decline in QoL when one of their children re-
turned to live with them, although, as discussed below, there were
variations across European regions and living arrangements.
The findings show that returning home was correlated with a de-
cline in parent's QoL when there were no other children in the parental
home. Parents enjoy their independence when their children leave the
home, and refilling an empty nest may be regarded as a violation of this
life
course
stage
(Settersten,
1998;
White
and
Edwards,
1990;
VanLaningham et al., 2001).
Returns to the parental home were associated with a decline in
parent's QoL in Nordic countries where autonomy has a greater value
and public support systems facilitate independence of younger and
older family generations. By contrast, there was no association in
Southern and Eastern European societies where people rely more on the
family and shelter is an important form of support that parents provide
to their adult children. Similarly to Aranda (2015)’s findings showing a
positive effect of co-residence on older parents' mental health in
Catholic areas of Europe, we found that home returning had a less
negative and non-significant association with parent's QoL in Southern
Europe where an interplay between cultural systems and welfare in-
stitutions fosters family interdependence. However, we also found no
associations in Western European societies where there is a higher
heterogeneity in family attitudes and welfare state arrangements. Many
other factors related to gender roles, care services and family cultures
might explain these results, but the analysis presented here does not
allow us to distinguish between cultural and institutional mechanisms.
Further research is needed to shed light on country-specific settings, as
well as on the role of the recent economic downturn.
We analysed transitions into unemployment and/or divorce/se-
paration as possible confounding factors in the association between
returns home and changes in parent's QoL. Parent's QoL decreased
when a child became unemployed, and increased when a child started
living with a partner. These findings are consistent with the concept of
linked lives (Elder et al., 2003) and previous research findings on the
U.S. (Greenfield and Marks, 2006; Milkie et al., 2008; Pillemer et al.,
2017). However, these life course factors did not explain the decrease of
parents' QoL associated with boomerang moves. Other unobserved
factors related to parent-child relationship quality and changes in
psychological states of children might confound the association be-
tween boomerang moves and parents' well-being. Ward and Spitze
(2007), for example, found that in the U.S. children moving back home
were negatively selected on prior relationship quality, but parents
provided housing support to them nonetheless. Our approach based on
fixed effects models eliminated the influence of such time-constant se-
lection factors, and additional analyses showed no significant interac-
tion terms between returning home and contact frequency at baseline as
an indicator of the strength of parent-child relationships.
We attempted to understand whether movers' characteristics mod-
erated the association between returning home on parental well-being.
We found no support for this hypothesis. This is inconsistent with
Aquilino and Supple (1991)’s results showing that parent-child conflicts
and parents' dissatisfaction with living arrangements increased when
they lived with an unemployed or divorced child. However, in our
sample the number of returns due to unemployment was small and this
may mean that we lacked sufficient statistical power to detect any such
association.
In interpreting these results a number of limitations need to be
considered. Firstly, as indicated above, the number of observations in
sub-groups of interest was small and thus our estimates were based on
only about one thousand parents who had a returning child. Secondly,
rates of initial non-response were high in some cases. We attempted to
address possible bias of non-response by repeating the analysis ex-
cluding two countries (Belgium and Switzerland) where the initial
household response rate was particularly low, and we found similar
results. Third, using SHARE data it is possible to examine changes in
QoL, but this comes at the cost of sample attrition which was quite high
in some countries included in the analysis. Our empirical strategy

 considered the time spent by respondents in the observation window to
at least partly adjust the results for the possible bias due to unbalanced
panel data.
Despite these limitations, the findings showed the importance of
considering adult children's residential moves in the analysis of older
people's quality of life. In some contexts where family orientations and
welfare institutions promote individuals' independence, returning to
the parental home may indicate a lack of autonomy which has negative
implications for parents' well-being.
