We report that the anticancer activity of the widely used diabetic drug metformin is strongly potentiated by
syrosingopine. Synthetic lethality elicited by combining the two drugs is synergistic and specific to transformed
cells. This effect is unrelated to syrosingopine’s known role as an inhibitor of the vesicular monoamine transporters.
Syrosingopine binds to the glycolytic enzyme a-enolase in vitro, and the expression of the g-enolase isoform
correlates with nonresponsiveness to the drug combination. Syrosingopine sensitized cancer cells to metformin
and its more potent derivative phenformin far below the individual toxic threshold of each compound. Thus,
combining syrosingopine and codrugs is a promising therapeutic strategy for clinical application for the treat-
ment of cancer.
INTRODUCTION
Metformin, an oral antidiabetic of the biguanide class, is the most
widely prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes. It acts as a mild mitochon-
drial inhibitor, and its impact on key metabolic organs, such as the
liver and muscle, results in reduced blood glucose levels and restora-
tion of insulin responsiveness at the whole-body level. Metformin is a
well-tolerated drug that can be taken for years with few adverse effects,
such as rare cases of lactic acidosis.
There is increasing evidence that metformin, in addition to its
antidiabetic effect, has anticancer properties. Epidemiological studies
have shown that the incidence of cancer is significantly reduced in
diabetic patients on metformin (1–5). Metformin prescription as a
neoadjuvant also results in an improved clinical response after opera-
tion (6, 7). These observations are corroborated by in vitro studies in
which metformin inhibits growth of cancer cell lines from a wide
variety of tissue types (8), and in vivo studies where metformin is
active in mouse xenograft models (9). Metformin is believed to exert
its anticancer effect by an indirect systemic and direct cellular effect
(10). The systemic effect of metformin lowers blood glucose levels
and, hence, glucose availability to glucose-hungry cancer cells. At the
cellular level, metformin inhibits mitochondrial respiration in cancer
cells that are already experiencing a shortfall in glucose uptake, leading
to lower adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) levels. The resulting activa-
tion of AMPK leads to inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1), a major signaling hub for cell growth, transla-
tion, and metabolism. Several clinical trials investigating metformin’s
antineoplastic activity are currently in progress [www.clinicaltrials.gov,
which is reviewed by Pollak and Chae et al. (11, 12)]. Despite this gen-
erally favorable picture of metformin as a potential anticancer agent,
there is a persistent background of studies where metformin shows
little to no effect in cancer (13–16) or no benefit in comparison with
other antidiabetics (17, 18).
A resolution to the discrepancy between the studies noted above is
that the concentration of metformin used to obtain antineoplastic
activity in vitro greatly exceeds the in vivo serum concentration that
can be attained with standard antidiabetic prescription (19). Thus,
there may be a clinical gray zone, where metformin efficacy is
dependent on factors that may vary between different study groups.
This suggests that, for the development of metformin as a clinically
efficacious anticancer agent, it would be desirable to lower its thera-
peutic threshold to within a reasonably attainable range in vivo. With
this objective, we performed a screening to identify compounds that
interact with a low, sublethal concentration of metformin to induce
cancer cell killing. We show that the antihypertensive syrosingopine,
a derivative of reserpine, is synthetically lethal with metformin and
that both compounds interact synergistically to kill a broad variety
of cancer cell types while demonstrating no activity against nontrans-
formed cells. Synthetic lethality with syrosingopine was also observed
with every inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain
(ETC) tested. The synthetic lethal interaction evoked by syrosingopine
and mitochondrial inhibitors occurs at concentrations substantially
below the toxic threshold for either compound alone. These results
suggest that a combination of syrosingopine with mitochondrial in-
hibitors represents a novel option for both classes of compounds in
cancer therapy. Lowering the therapeutic threshold of metformin,
and the related biguanide phenformin, may allow their clinical
application as anticancer agents.
RESULTS
Syrosingopine potentiates cell killing by metformin
We screened a drug library (1120 compounds) using murine 6.5 mast
cells to identify drugs that are cytotoxic only in the presence of metfor-
min. These are Pten-null, vH-Ras–expressing, and mTORC2-addicted
cells that display a transformed phenotype (20). Parallel screens were
performed in the absence and presence of metformin. The concen-
tration of metformin used in the screen was determined by a prior
titration with metformin; eventually, 4 mM metformin was chosen be-
cause it has minimal effect on cell growth (fig. S1A). Syrosingopine
was the only compound that fulfilled our selection criteria (>80%
growth in the absence of metformin and <10% growth in the presence
of metformin; Fig. 1A). Syrosingopine is a semisynthetic derivative of
reserpine (fig. S1B), both of which are clinically approved antihyper-
tensives (21).

 The synthetic lethal interaction was observed in most cell lines
tested (35 of 43 lines; table S1, selected lines shown in Fig. 1B, with
corresponding metformin titrations in fig. S1A), representing a
broad range of histotypes. Notably, some cell lines are nonrespon-
sive to the treatment (Fig. 1C), indicating that the effect is not due
to indiscriminate toxicity generated by the drug combination but
is selective.
The efficacy of the metformin-syrosingopine combination was
tested on ex vivo primary leukemic cells. These cells have limited pro-
liferation and survival in vitro but, nonetheless, provide an opportu-
nity to test drug efficacy on clinically derived material (22, 23).
Peripheral blasts were obtained from 15 leukemia patients [14 acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) and 1 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) pa-
tients] undergoing blast crisis. Individual patient-derived primary
cells showed a wide range of sensitivity to metformin (fig. S2, A and
B). Titration of syrosingopine in the presence of 5 mM metformin in
12 samples showed synergistic cell killing in all cases (Fig. 1D and fig.
S3A). Blast cells from 3 patients were metformin-sensitive compared
to the previous 12 patients (fig. S2B), but in one case (AML8124), it
was still possible to perform a cotitration with syrosingopine at a lower
metformin concentration (2.5 mM). This also turned out to be respon-
sive to the drug combination (fig. S3A). Thus, all primary leukemic
cells tested (13 of 13) responded to syrosingopine-metformin treat-
ment. Peripheral blood cells from healthy blood donors were in-
sensitive to metformin and to syrosingopine-metformin treatment
(Fig. 1D and fig. S3B). Two nontransformed cell lines generated from
primary human skin fibroblasts, Fib3 and Fib4, were also nonrespon-
sive to the drug combination, suggesting that the effect is specific to
transformed cells (fig. S3C).
The mode of cell death occurred via induction of apoptosis, as
measured by annexin V staining, an early apoptotic marker, with first
indications of cell death observed by 20 hours after treatment (Fig. 1E).

 This was confirmed with an alternative assay, measuring cell viability,
cytoxicity, and caspase activity (fig. S4A). Annexin V staining of blast
cells from one leukemic patient (CML7359) confirmed that, in
primary human leukemic blasts, the mode of killing was also due to
induction of apoptosis (Fig. 1F).
Hepatospheres are three-dimensional (3D) cultures of hepatocytes
that more accurately mimic the in vivo conditions of solid tumors
compared to conventional monolayer cell culture (24). We generated
hepatospheres from the hepatocellular carcinoma lines Huh7 and
HepG2, which are responsive to the syrosingopine-metformin combi-
nation in monolayer cell culture (table S1). The drug combination,
when added 24 hours after sphere formation, caused disaggregation
of fully formed hepatospheres and killing of individual cells (Fig. 2A
and fig. S4B). However, the amount of syrosingopine and the length of
treatment were greater than those required for killing of the cell lines
in 2D cultures.
The in vivo efficacy of the drug combination was tested in a mouse
liver cancer model. Tumor development in these mice is driven by
liver-specific deletion of the tumor suppressors Tsc1 and Pten, causing
hyperactive mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling. The liver is greatly
enlarged, and tumor nodules develop at multiple foci, starting from
12 weeks of age. Twenty-five 15-week-old Tsc1−/Pten− liver knockout
mice were treated on alternate days with syrosingopine (7.5 mg/kg
body weight), metformin (200 mg/kg), or in combination, for a total
of six treatments. Already after this short treatment, there was a reduc-
tion in liver size and the number of visible tumor nodules (Fig. 2, B and
C). Histological examination of liver sections showed a reduction in
tumor burden. The pathological report classified combination-treated
miceas having fewer and smaller nodules withlarge necrotic areasthat
were absent in vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 2D). Livers from two
combination-treated mice were classified as tumor-free.
Syrosingopine is synthetic lethal with inhibition of the
mitochondrial ETC
Metformin inhibits complex I of the mitochondrial ETC to disrupt
oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial ATP generation (25–27).

 Complex I inhibition by metformin has been shown to have a direct
antitumor effect (28). Phenformin, a more potent analog of metfor-
min, has been proposed as an alternative to metformin in the frame
of anticancer therapy (29). Phenformin also synergized strongly with
syrosingopine (fig. S5A), suggesting a common mode of action with
metformin in eliciting synthetic lethality with syrosingopine, namely,
via complex I inhibition.
Next, we tested syrosingopine in combination with an array of
pharmacological agents that inhibit the ETC at different points, com-
prising inhibitors against all four ETC complexes, an inhibitor of the
F1FO ATP synthase, and a proton ionophore [carbonyl cyanide p-
trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP)] that dissipates the mito-
chondrial membrane potential. Cell death was induced in all cases,
indicating that synthetic lethality is indeed due to inhibition of mito-
chondrial ETC activity and not via an extramitochondrial off-target
effect of the biguanide drugs metformin and phenformin (Fig. 3A
and fig. S5B).
To independently corroborate these findings, we generated cells
lacking the mitochondrial genome. The mitochondrial genome en-
codes components of the ETC, and cells depleted of mitochondrial
DNA (termed r0 cells) are consequently devoid of ETC activity, there-
by approximating a condition of constitutive ETC inhibition (30). r0
cells derived from 6.5, HL60, and OPM2 (Fig. 3B) became exquisitely
sensitive to syrosingopine alone compared to their parental cells (Fig.
3C). These results allow us to generalize that syrosingopine is synthetic
lethal with inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport.

 Syrosingopine potentiates the anticancer efficacy of
metformin and other mitochondrial inhibitors
Metformin and its more potent analog phenformin have attracted in-
terest as potential anticancer agents (29). However, the concentrations
required for anticancer efficacy in preclinical models are greater than
the plasma concentration attained with typical dosing in diabetic
patients (19). We performed a titration of metformin, phenformin,
and selected mitochondrial inhibitors in HL60 cells in the presence
of a fixed concentration of syrosingopine (5 mM) (Fig. 4A). There
was a shift in metformin sensitivity of approximately 15-fold [from
a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ~30 to ~2 mM] in the
presence of syrosingopine and 13-fold with phenformin (IC50 from
~400 to 30 mM). Piericidin A was not toxic up to 16 nM but had
an IC50 of 2 nM with syrosingopine. Rotenone had a 10-fold shift
in potency (IC50 from ~200 to 20 nM with syrosingopine). Antimycin
A had an IC50 at ~3 nM with syrosingopine while showing no toxicity
at 40 nM. Finally, oligomycin had an IC50 at ~750 pM with syrosingo-
pine while showing no toxicity up to 16 nM in the absence of syrosin-
gopine. Similar titrations for 6.5 cells are shown in fig. S6A.
The low concentrations at which the abovementioned mitochon-
drial inhibitors elicit synthetic lethality would be expected to have only
a slight impact on mitochondrial function. To confirm this, HL60 cells
were treated with the mitochondrial inhibitors at the concentrations
used for synergistic killing with syrosingopine, and the mitochondrial
membrane potential was measured using the potentiometric dye
TMRM (tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester). After 20 hours of treat-
ment, there was no change in membrane potential compared to the
untreated control (Fig. 4B), whereas cells treated with the proton ion-
ophore FCCP as a positive control were fully depolarized.
Syrosingopine alone had no effect on the membrane potential in
HL60 cells except in combination with metformin, when it resulted
in a collapse in the membrane potential after 20 hours of treatment
(Fig. 4C). Syrosingopine-metformin treatment for a shorter period
(6 hours) in HL60 did not generate a drop in the membrane poten-
tial. In nonresponsive HT1080 and NA8 cells, treatment with the
syrosingopine-metformin combination had no effect on the mem-
brane potential. Depolarization is correlated with low cell viability,
as measured by trypan blue staining (Fig. 4C). Although this may
suggest that depolarization is involved in eliciting cell death, it
could also be the case that the depolarized cells detected are those
already undergoing cell death as a consequence of the combined
drug treatment.

 It remains possible that syrosingopine is acting by preventing the
maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential. In the presence
of respiratory chain inhibition, the function of the F1Fo-ATP synthase
is reversed, and it uses cytosolic ATP generated by glycolysis to pump
protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane to maintain the
membrane potential (31, 32). Thus, any inhibitory effect by syrosin-
gopine on the reverse F1Fo-ATP synthase activity would be sufficient
to elicit synthetic lethality in the presence of respiratory chain inhibi-
tion. To test this possibility, we permeabilized HL60r0 cells to allow
uptake of exogenous ATP and measured the effect of syrosingopine
on the membrane potential. We observe membrane polarization in
the HL60r0 cells that is increased when exogenous ATP is added
(fig. S6B). This membrane potential is oligomycin-insensitive but
azide-sensitive, as has been reported by Appleby et al. (32). However,
the membrane is not depolarized by syrosingopine, leading us to dis-
count syrosingopine-dependent inhibition of F1FO-adenosine triphos-
phatase activity as a potential mechanism for its mode of action.
To summarize, neither syrosingopine nor the mitochondrial inhibi-
tors, when applied singly at the low concentrations used to elicit syn-
thetic lethality, have a detectable effect on mitochondrial function as
measured by the membrane potential. Nevertheless, this weak ETC
inhibition is potentiated by syrosingopine to generate strong synergis-
tic killing, giving hope that this may be clinically effective in combina-
tion with low plasma biguanide concentrations.
Syrosingopine-induced synthetic lethality is unrelated to its
antihypertensive properties
Syrosingopine is derived from the potent antihypertensive drug reser-
pine (fig. S1B). Both drugs inhibit the vesicular monoamine transpor-
ters (VMAT1 and VMAT2) to prevent sequestration of monoamines
into their storage granule, thus depleting catecholamine stores (33, 34).
Syrosingopine is less potent than reserpine, with consequently weaker
antihypertensive activity (35, 36). To test whether syrosingopine elicits
synthetic lethality via VMAT inhibition, we tested the combination of
reserpine with metformin. Despite being a stronger VMAT inhibitor,
reserpine only weakly synergized with metformin and was less potent
than syrosingopine in inducing synthetic lethality (Fig. 5A). The r0
cells were also less sensitive to reserpine in comparison to syrosingo-
pine (Fig. 5B).
To confirm that synthetic lethality with metformin is not due to
VMAT inhibition, we performed a cotitration of metformin with tetra-
benazine, a potent VMAT inhibitor structurally unrelated to the reserpine-
like compounds (fig. S1C), which binds to VMAT at a distinct site
(37). Tetrabenazine had no synthetic lethality with metformin in 6.5
and HL60 cells nor any greater toxicity in the r0 cells compared to the
respective parental cells (Fig. 5C). Collectively, these data suggest that
synthetic lethality with metformin by syrosingopine is unrelated to
VMAT inhibition.
Syrosingopine binds the glycolytic enzyme a-enolase
We used DARTS (drug affinity responsive target stability) to identify
the binding partners of syrosingopine (38). We observed a prominent
band that was protected from proteolytic digestion in the presence of
syrosingopine (Fig. 6A). This band was excised and identified by mass
spectrometry as the glycolytic enzyme a-enolase (Fig. 6B). Binding of
syrosingopine to a-enolase was confirmed in vitro by microscale ther-
mophoresis (39) with an observed Kd of 1.25 × 10−6 M (Fig. 6C).
a-Enolase catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phos-
phoenolpyruvate in glycolysis. Enolase activity was measured in HL60
lysates by an in vitro activity assay. However, we could not detect any
inhibition of enolase activity by syrosingopine, although it was
inhibited by the known enolase inhibitor NaF (Fig. 6D). These assays
were repeated under varying conditions (preincubation with syrosin-
gopine and length and temperature of incubation), but no inhibitory
effect of syrosingopine on a-enolase activity was observed.
The effect of syrosingopine on glycolysis at the cellular level was
monitored using 6.5r0 cells. Most cells are metabolically flexible
and can switch between glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phos-
phorylation for ATP production, should either one of the pathways be
inhibited. Because 6.5r0 cells rely exclusively on glycolysis for ATP
generation, they provide a simplified system for unambiguous mea-
surement of glycolytic output. As expected, metformin had no effect
on glycolytic output in this background (Fig. 6E). Treatment with syr-
osingopine reduced both ATP and lactate production to levels com-
parable to those seen with NaF (Fig. 6E). Thus, despite the lack of
enolase inhibition seen in the in vitro assay (Fig. 6D), syrosingopine
appears to have some impact on glycolysis at the cellular level. To see
whether enolase inhibition elicits synthetic lethality with metformin, a
NaF-metformin titration was performed (Fig. 6F and fig. S7A). NaF
was toxic between 2 and 10 mM, which was not increased by the
addition of metformin. The absence of synergy between NaF and met-
formin suggests that the strong synthetic lethality of syrosingopine in
combination with metformin is due to more than just the simulta-
neous inhibition of glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP-generating
pathways.
g-Enolase is a marker for resistance to
syrosingopine-metformin treatment
There are three enolase isozymes in humans: a-enolase (encoded by
Eno1; ubiquitously expressed), g-enolase (Eno2; mainly in the brain),
and b-enolase (Eno3; muscle-specific isoform). g-Enolase overexpres-
sion has been observed in cancer and is a tumor marker in non–small
cell lung cancer (40, 41) and neuroendocrine tumors (42). We probed a
panel of syrosingopine-metformin–responsive and syrosingopine-
metformin–nonresponsive cell lines to determine their a-enolase
and g-enolase levels. a-Enolase was expressed in all cell lines, as
expected (Fig. 7A). Markedly, most of the nonresponsive or poorly re-
sponding cell lines express g-enolase (syrosingopine-metformin respon-
siveness shown in fig. S7B). As described above, we could detect
binding between syrosingopine and recombinant a-enolase (Fig.
6C). Notably, syrosingopine does not bind recombinant g-enolase un-
der the same conditions.
Eno2 overexpression in the responsive cell line OPM2 (Fig. 7B)
conferred resistance to syrosingopine-metformin treatment (Fig. 7C).
Independently, we selected for resistance to the drug combination by
passaging human colorectal carcinoma Colo201 cells at a sublethal
concentration (1 mM syrosingopine and 4 mM metformin). Selecting
for resistant cells enriched for Eno2-expression that are resistant to
syrosingopine-metformin treatment (Fig. 7E). The resistant cells had
a lower proliferation rate, and removal of selection pressure resulted
in loss of high Eno2 expression in the cell pool (Fig. 7D), possibly be-
cause of overgrowth by Eno2-nonexpressing cells. This pool of “de-
selected” cells reverts to syrosingopine-metformin sensitivity (Fig. 7E).
Eno2 was deleted in resistant HT1080 and NA8 cell lines by
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)
using two independent constructs (fig. S8A). However, loss of g-enolase
expression did not sensitize cells to syrosingopine-metformin treatment
(fig. S8B). Thus, whereas ectopic Eno2 expression in a previously

 sensitive background confers resistance to the drug combination, the
reverse does not hold, and loss of Eno2 does not render cells insensitive
to syrosingopine-metformin treatment.
DISCUSSION
We describe a potent interaction between syrosingopine, an anti-
hypertensive drug, and mitochondrial ETC inhibitors. These two classes
of drugs, when combined, elicit a synthetic lethal reaction in most of the
cancer cell lines tested, which was specific to transformed cells.
Metformin and phenformin have attracted considerable interest as
potential anticancer agents. Although many mitochondrial inhibitors,
such as sodium azide, rotenone, and KCN, are notoriously toxic, the
mild ETC inhibition afforded by the biguanides allows for their safe
usage and generally clean clinical record. This has led to calls for re-
assessment of the risk-benefit ratio of phenformin for its introduction
in anticancer therapy (29, 43). However, the effective concentrations
of metformin and phenformin required for anticancer activity in in
vitro settings are higher than those attained with typical antidiabetic
dosage in vivo. The in vivo efficacy of these low doses for cancer treat-
ment has thus been a matter of debate (19, 44, 45). As noted in the
study by Chandel et al. (45), metformin plasma concentration in mu-
rine models, given doses comparable to human antidiabetic prescrip-
tion, overlaps with the concentration sufficient to inhibit oxidative
phosphorylation; nevertheless, other factors, such as pharmaco-
kinetics and tumor-related factors, may come into play to influence
clinical anticancer efficacy. Sensitizing compounds that lower the
therapeutic threshold of the biguanides may help pave the way for
their use in anticancer therapy.
Syrosingopine elicits cell death with all ETC inhibitors tested at con-
centrations orders of magnitude below their cytotoxic threshold. Syro-
singopine is thus able to leverage weak ETC inhibition that is practically
undetectable (Fig. 3, B and C) into potent cell killing. Oligomycin in
particular has an in vitro IC50 of 750 pM with syrosingopine and is

 nontoxic up to 16 nM in its absence. The low in vitro IC50 values of
these nonbiguanide ETC inhibitors suggest that they may be pharma-
cological alternatives to metformin or phenformin, as well as potential
alternatives should biguanide resistance develop in the course of therapy.
The mechanism by which syrosingopine elicits synthetic lethality
with metformin remains unknown, although we have established that
it is distinct from VMAT inhibition (Fig. 4). The observation that syr-
osingopine binds a-enolase could provide a clue to the underlying
mechanism. Cancer cells are more vulnerable to mitochondrial in-
hibition when combined with glucose limitation (46) or glycolytic
inhibition (47, 48). Syrosingopine-dependent inhibition of enolase
activity, and thus glycolysis, is a plausible mechanism for synthetic
lethality with concurrent mitochondrial inhibition. However, we do
not see any evidence for inhibition of enolase activity by syrosingopine
in vitro. It is possible that syrosingopine is a prodrug that requires in-
ternalization and metabolization into an active form, thus explaining
the lack of activity seen in in vitro assays. We do observe an effect by
syrosingopine on glycolysis in intact r0 cells, suggesting that this may
indeed play some part in the synthetic lethal interaction.
g-Enolase expression correlates with nonresponsiveness to
syrosingopine-metformin, and ectopic g-enolase expression confers
resistance to syrosingopine-metformin treatment. Glioblastomas that
are homozygously deleted for ENO1 are viable due to ENO2 expression;
however, these cells are more vulnerable to enolase inhibition be-
cause of the decrease in total enolase activity (49). Thus, expression
of both enolase isoforms is associated with greater resistance to eno-
lase inhibition. The fact that syrosingopine only binds to a- and not
tog-enolase,and presumably impairs its function, lends support to this

 view. However, it should be noted that knockout of g-enolase is not
sufficient to sensitize resistant cell lines to the drug treatment (fig. S8B).
a-Enolase and g-enolase have various moonlighting functions un-
related to glycolysis and for which their enzymatic activity is dispens-
able (41, 50, 51). Some of these functions are significant in the context
of cancer. A truncated Eno1 isoform, myc promoter-binding protein
1, transcriptionally regulates the c-myc oncogene (52). Cell surface–
bound a-enolase is a plasminogen receptor and is associated with
greater invasiveness and metastasis (50, 53, 54). g-Enolase has also
been reported at the plasma membrane (55) but lacks the C-terminal
lysine present in a-enolase that serves as a plasminogen receptor. In-
stead, its C-terminal sequence forms a PDZ-binding motif for protein-
protein interaction (41). The g-enolase C-terminal sequence promotes
cell survival by activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and
mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal–regulated kinase
signaling (56, 57) and inhibition of apoptosis (58). g-Enolase is re-
quired for the import of lysine tRNA acceptor 1 into the mitochondria
(59), a moonlighting activity that is conserved from yeast to humans.
It remains possible that impairment of one of these moonlighting
functions is involved in synthetic lethality.
Two recent publications have shown that inhibition of cytosolic
aspartate synthesis is synthetic lethal with ETC inhibition (50, 60),
raising the possibility that syrosingopine may be an inhibitor of
GOT1 (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1), the cytosolic enzyme
that synthesizes aspartate when the ETC is inhibited. However, this
does not appear to be the case because aspartate supplementation was
unable to rescue cells from syrosingopine-metformin killing.
Syrosingopine and metformin are approved drugs with well-
established clinical records outside cancer therapy. The interaction
between these drugs in in vitro and animal models holds out the
promise that, when appropriately combined, they may find appli-
cation in the treatment of cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Cells were grown in Iscove’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml), and strep-
tomycin (100mg/ml) at 37°C and 5% CO2. The 6.5 murine mast cell
medium was supplemented with murine interleukin-3 from conditioned
medium (20). Mitochondrial genome null r0 cells were generated by the
addition of ethidium bromide (0.2 mg/ml), uridine (50 mg/ml), and
mIL3 (for 6.5r0), and outgrowing r0 cells were obtained after four to
five passages. Primary leukemic blasts were obtained from patients

 undergoing blast crisis (14 AML and 1 CML patients), with the ap-
proval of the ethics committee of Basel, Switzerland, and informed
consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 3D cultures
of Huh7 and HepG2 hepatospheres were performed by seeding 2 ×
105 and 1 × 105 cells, respectively, in 1.5 ml of medium (Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium/F12 + GlutaMAX, supplemented with B27,
insulin, and epidermal growth factor) in six-well plates (Ultra-Low
Attachment surface plates, Costar). Sphere formation was assessed
microscopically, and drugs were added 24 hours after seeding, when
spheres could already be observed. Medium was changed every 2 days,
and fresh compounds were added. Hepatosphere viability was quan-
tified by adding 50 mM resazurin to the medium and measuring the
fluorescence. Normal peripheral blood cells were obtained from sur-
plus units at the local blood bank (Blutspendezentrum, University
Hospital Basel). Blood cells and leukemic blasts were plated in 96-well
plates at 20,000 cells/150 ml of medium and processed in a similar
manner to established cell lines.
Cell proliferation assays
Cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 3000 cells/
150 ml of medium (suspension cells) or 2000 cells/150 ml of medium
(adherent cells), and growth was measured after 3 days (suspension
cultures), or 5 days (adherent cell lines) by the addition of 0.1 vol re-
sazurin (final concentration of 50 mM). Fluorescence was read at 535/
595 nm (excitation/emission) with a plate reader. Growth was normalized
to untreated controls, and each data point was performed in triplicate.
Metformin synthetic lethal drug screen
The 6.5 cells were plated at a density of 3000 cells/150 ml of Iscove’s
medium in 96-well plates. Replica plates were set up in parallel,
containing 4 mM metformin. The plates were challenged with
1120 drugs (Prestwick Chemical Library) at 2 and 10 mM. A cell pro-
liferation assay was performed after a 3-day incubation with 50 mM
resazurin, and growth was normalized to untreated controls. Cyto-
toxic compounds killed or strongly reduced the proliferation, regard-
less of whether metformin was present. Metformin-interacting drugs
were lethal only in the presence of 4 mM metformin. A cutoff point
of >80% growth (normalized to DMSO controls) in the absence of
metformin and <10% growth in the presence of 4 mM metformin
was set.
FACS analysis
Apoptosis assay.
The cells were stained with annexin V (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol, and apoptotic cells were detected by FACS
analysis. The cells were also counterstained with propidium iodide
(5 mg/ml) as a vital stain, and the proportion of living cells was
simultaneously detected in a separate FACS channel.
Mitochondrial membrane potential determination.
The potentiometric dye TMRM (100 nM; ImmunoChemistry Tech-
nologies) was added to the cells 30 min before FACS analysis, and the
cells were directly subjected to FACS. For measurement of the mem-
brane potential in HL60r0, the cells were treated with drugs for 30 min
in full medium and then spun down and resuspended in mito-
chondrial assay buffer [250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, and 10 mM tris
(pH 7.4)] containing the respective drugs. Where required, cells were
permeabilized with the freshly prepared saponin (120 mg/ml). TMRM
was then added for 30 min before proceeding with FACS analysis.
FACS data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 9.6.2).
Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer
and total protein (20 to 40 mg) loaded on SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins
were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with com-
mercially available antibodies against a-enolase, g-enolase (Cell
Signaling), and MT-Co1 (Abcam).
Mouse experiments
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the federal
guidelines for animal experimentation and were approved by the
Kantonales Veterinäramt of Kanton Basel‐Stadt. Liver-specific Pten−/Tsc1−
double-knockout mice display tumor development from 10 weeks of
age. Treatment was initiated from 15 weeks. Mice were injected intra-
peritoneally every 2 days with syrosingopine (7.5 mg/kg body weight),
metformin (200 mg/kg body weight), or in combination. For the
double-treated animals, metformin was injected approximately an hour
before the second injection with syrosingopine. After six treatments,
mice were sacrificed at roughly 17 weeks of age.
DARTS assay
DARTS assay was performed according to Lomenick et al. (61) with
modifications. HL60 cell lysate prepared using DARTS buffer was pre-
absorbed with 50 mM syrosingopine for 30 min on ice before being
subjected to pronase digestion (0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml) for
30 min at room temperature. Half of the digested lysate was loaded
on an SDS-PAGE gel, and bands were visualized with Coomassie
staining. Excised bands were taken for mass spectrometric digestion
of proteins present.
Microscale thermophoresis
Recombinant a-enolase and g-enolase (Acris Antibodies) were
labeled with Monolith NT Blue dye. The amount of labeled protein
to use was empirically determined. Labeled protein was added to
syrosingopine (16-step twofold dilution starting from 8 mM in in-
dividual tubes) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Each individual
dilution was loaded on glass capillaries, and thermophoresis was
measured on Monolith NT.115 (NanoTemper Technologies).
Enolase activity assay
Enolase activity assay was conducted according to Muller et al. (62).
The reaction volume was scaled down to 100 ml and conducted in
96-well microtiter plates. Cell lysate (0.5 mg) was used, and the change in
fluorescence due to the oxidation of NADH (reduced form of nicotin-
amide adenine dinucleotide) was read using a plate reader at 360/460 nm
(excitation/emission). This basic experimental protocol was used with
varying conditions: drug pretreatment of cells or incubation at room
temperature or on ice. Enolase activity measurements were confirmed
using a commercially available kit (Enolase Activity Colorimetric/
Fluorometric Assay Kit, BioVision).
Metabolic measurements
ATP levels were measured using CellTiter-Glo reagent. Secreted lactic
acid was measured directly in cell culture medium using an ARKRAY
Lactate Pro 2 lactate test meter with corresponding test strips.
Eno2 knockout and overexpression
Eno2 was deleted using double-nickase CRISPR plasmids directed
against human Eno2 from Santa Cruz (h and h2). Recipient cells were
transfected using Lipofectamine 3000, and transfectants were selected
