n today’s healthcare environment, where 
resources are always stretched, there is 
a stronger policy focus on proving the 
effectiveness and cost efficiency of our 
health services. Economic evaluation has 
become a useful tool to assist clinical and 
policy decision making. Skin cancer, including 
melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer 
(NMSC), is the most common cancer in 
Australia.1 The age-standardised incidence of 
melanoma has increased from 27 in 100,000 
in 1982 to 49 in 100,000 in 2016.1 NMSC data 
have not been routinely collected in Australia 
and the latest estimate indicated an increase 
in the age-standardised rate of medical 
service for NMSC from 2,489 per 100,000 in 
2000 to 3,174 per 100,000 in 2010.2 
Public hospitals play a fundamental role in 
the Australian healthcare system and their 
funding is central to state government 
budgets. As one of Australia’s most prevalent 
and costly cancers, skin cancer imposes a 
large cost burden, not only on the primary 
care system, but also on hospitals through 
admissions and outpatient services.3 Despite 
this, there is limited published literature 
available on the cost of skin cancer to the 
public sector. The most recent reports were 
published by the Australian Institute of 
Health and Welfare (AIHW), but costs were 
not reported on a state-by-state basis.3,4 The 
latest AIHW report on skin cancer spending 
indicated that, in 2014, $9.2 million Medicare 
benefits claims were paid for melanoma 
and $127.6 million for NMSC, but hospital 
care costs were excluded.1 Total expenditure 
in treating NMSC was estimated to be 
$367 million in 2008-09 and $511 million 
in 2012. Melanoma, reported as the third 
most commonly diagnosed cancer in 2014, 
also represents a substantial cost burden to 
the healthcare system, with a reported $30 
million healthcare expenditure in 2001 ($40.3 
million in 2012 dollar terms).2,4 There is little 
accurate up-to-date information on the cost 
impact of treating and managing skin cancer. 
More importantly, skin cancer is one of 
the most preventable cancers.5,6 Proven 
prevention programs such as the SunSmart 
program in Australia offer excellent potential 
to redirect the enormous cost burden on our 
hospitals each year to other non-preventable 
diseases.7-9 This study aims to estimate the 
cost burden of managing skin cancer as well 
Skin cancer has a large impact on our public 
hospitals but prevention programs continue to 
demonstrate strong economic credentials

Abstract 
Objectives: While skin cancer is still the most common cancer in Australia, important 
information gaps remain. This paper addresses two gaps: i) the cost impact on public hospitals; 
and ii) an up-to-date assessment of economic credentials for prevention. 
Methods: A prevalence-based cost approach was undertaken in public hospitals in Victoria. 
Costs were estimated for inpatient admissions, using State service statistics, and outpatient 
services based on attendance at three hospitals in 2012-13. Cost-effectiveness for prevention 
was estimated from ‘observed vs expected’ analysis, together with program expenditure data.
Results: Combining inpatient and outpatient costs, total annual costs for Victoria were  
$48 million to $56 million. The SunSmart program is estimated to have prevented more than 
43,000 skin cancers between 1988 and 2010, a net cost saving of $92 million. Skin cancer 
treatment in public hospitals ($9.20~$10.39 per head/year) was 30-times current public 
funding in skin cancer prevention ($0.37 per head/year).
Conclusions: At about $50 million per year for hospitals in Victoria alone, the cost burden of a 
largely preventable disease is substantial. Skin cancer prevention remains highly cost-effective, 
yet underfunded.
Implications for public health: Increased funding for skin cancer prevention must be kept high 
on the public health agenda. Hospitals would also benefit from being able to redirect resources 
to non-preventable conditions.
Key words: skin cancer, economics, prevention, cost-effectiveness

as to assess the current cost-effectiveness 
credentials of the Victorian skin cancer 
prevention program. Economic information 
on cost, potential cost offsets and cost-
effectiveness is useful for both clinical and 
policy assessment of where limited resources 
should be directed.
Methods
Cost of skin cancer
We undertook a prevalence-based 
approach to estimate the cost of skin cancer 
management within the public hospital 
system in Victoria. Costs were estimated 
separately for inpatient admission and 
outpatient clinic services. Quantity of service 
data was combined with national unit cost 
data to develop the cost estimates. More 
specifically, inpatient costs were calculated 
based on the number of admissions in 
Victorian public hospitals for 2012-13, with 
aggregated health service statistics sourced 
from Victorian Integrated Care Services (ICS). 
Outpatient costs were determined by the 
number of outpatient attendances at three 
public hospitals, where data were available 
to our study. These three hospitals are major 
referral centres in metropolitan areas of 
Victoria. All costs were valued and reported in 
Australian dollars for the reference year 2012-
13. Where price adjustments were required, 
price indices published by the AIHW were 
applied.10 
Health service utilisation
The Cancer Services Framework for Victoria 
is a State Government initiative and the 
integrated service model is promoted 
through eight geographically based services 
and one speciality-based Paediatrics 
Integrated Care Service (PICS).11 Each of 
the Integrated Cancer Services (ICS) within 
the framework reports its services by 
accessing and using two main data sources: 
The Victorian Cancer Registry (VCR)12 and 
The Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset 
(VAED).13 Aggregated health service statistics 
from the ICS datasets for 2012-13 were used 
in our analysis. Table 1 presents the number 
of patients admitted to public hospitals and 
the number of admissions to public hospitals 
for melanoma and non-melanoma skin 
cancer treatment in each ICS. These numbers 
were used to estimate the cost of inpatient 
services incurred by Victorian public hospitals.
Data on outpatient clinic services was 
obtained from hospital departments in 
charge of health informatics or operational 
planning that had access to their hospital’s 
health service data. These departments/units 
provided counts of outpatient clinic services 
by type or unit of outpatient service. Due to 
variation in information operations at each 
of the three hospitals involved, the format, 
coverage and detail in the data provided were 
different but comparable. The limitations of 
data retrieval from each hospital information 
system meant that assumptions were 
required to estimate outpatient attendance in 
a comparable fashion. 
Outpatient costs were determined from 
outpatient attendances (see Table 1). 
As data on outpatient clinic services 
was only available from these public 
hospitals, extrapolation of outpatient cost 
to a statewide estimate was undertaken, 
weighted to reflect the proportion of skin 
cancer patients treated in each of the three 
hospitals. There were two steps involved: 
firstly, an extrapolation from the individual 
hospital to their ICS; and secondly, an 
extrapolation from the ICS level to the 
Victorian public hospital system.
Unit cost estimation
Unit costs were obtained from the National 
Hospital Cost Data Collection (NHCDC). More 
specifically, inpatient admission from Cost 
Weights for Australian Refined Diagnosis-
Related Groups (AR-DRG) and outpatient 
attendance by expenditure and occasion of 
service for non-admitted clinics. The national 
average costs per separation in the NHCDC 
report were used as the unit costs per hospital 
admission, by three levels of complexity in 
melanoma skin cancer treatment. Hospital 
admissions for melanoma were distributed 
across these three levels of complexity 
according to the number of separations in 
the samples reported to the NHCDC. The 
separation data was classified by AR-DRG 
code, which provides a useful indication of 
complexity.
Treatment of NMSC involves less complex 
procedures and consequently the average 
cost per NMSC admission is expected to be 
lower than that for melanoma. A separate 
unit cost for NMSC admissions was estimated 
based on Australian total expenditure on 
NMSC hospital admissions in 2008-09, divided 
by total NMSC cases calculated from the 
gender-specific NMSC hospital separation 
rates in 2006-07.3,4 Adjustment of separation 
rates was undertaken to reflect the trend of 
increase in NMSC incidence from 2006-07 to 
2008-09.2 The estimate was then adjusted to 
the reference year value (2012/2013) using 
AIHW inflators.10 Estimation of unit cost for 
NMSC admissions is presented in Table 2. 
Total expenditure and occasion of service 
data for non-admitted clinics in Victoria 
reported in the NHCDC for the year 2008-
09 were used to calculate an average cost 
per occasion of service for three types of

Economic burden of skin cancer and benefit of its prevention
outpatient clinic service, i.e. dermatology, 
radiation oncology and plastic surgery.14 
Using the proportions of attendance across 
the three outpatient units at one of the 
study hospitals, average weighted costs 
per melanoma and per non-melanoma 
skin cancer outpatient attendance were 
estimated. 
Economic evaluation framework
Economic evaluation was conducted from 
three perspectives: first, the government as 
‘3rd party funder’ to inform policy; second, the 
‘health sector’ to include both government 
and patient impacts; and third, from a ‘societal 
perspective’ to consider productivity impacts 
in the broader economy. Incremental cost-
effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated 
by comparing the incremental net costs to 
incremental health outcomes. The Victorian 
skin cancer prevention program (‘SunSmart’), 
was compared to skin cancer prevention in 
two populous states (New South Wales and 
Queensland). Based on a previous economic 
evaluation methodology, the present study 
updated the analysis with latest data in skin 
cancer incidence and program expenditures.8 
The incremental intervention costs were 
estimated based on the difference in 
expenditures between Victoria and the 
comparator states over a specified period. 
The incremental cost to individuals for 
the intervention was estimated based on 
the same assumptions as in the previous 
economic evaluation.8,9 Cost offsets were 
measured from the number of skin cancer 
cases prevented, multiplied by the unit cost 
for treatment and management per case 
(Table 2). Program investment return was 
estimated from the government perspective 
by comparing the savings in cancer treatment 
(cost offsets) to the SunSmart program 
expenditure.
The effectiveness of the Victorian SunSmart 
program in preventing cases of melanoma 
was estimated by the gap between the 
‘predicted’ and ‘observed’ incidence, 
expressed as a rate ratio (RR). The ‘observed’ 
was the actual incidence trend in Victorian 
between 1988 and 2007. The ‘expected’ 
skin cancer incidence was estimated by 
a counterfactual scenario, involving the 
Victorian SunSmart program modelled with 
lower levels of program expenditure as in the 
other two states. The predicted melanoma 
incidence for the counterfactual scenario was 
modelled by back calculating the Victorian 
incidence using the ratios of actual incidence 
over projected incidence trends in another 
two states with lower skin cancer prevention 
expenditure level from 1988 to 2007. This 
approach assumes that, if there were no 
Victorian SunSmart program implemented 
in 1988, the melanoma incidence in Victoria 
would have grown in the same trend pattern 
as in the other two states. The effectiveness of 
melanoma reduction was therefore estimated 
by the gap between the expected and 
observed incidence (RR). 
The methods for analysing NMSC involve 
analysis of BCC and SCC age-specific 
incidence rates across four national surveys 
in Australia. The national surveys were 
conducted in 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2004 to 
estimate NMSC incidence and the incidence 
trend.15,16 Available evidence from the 
gender specific incidence in the south 
regions (latitude >37°S) allowed BCC to be 
modelled, but not SCC. In estimating program 
effectiveness, 50% of the incidence reduction 
was attributed to the skin cancer prevention 
activities. This attributable fraction is in line 
with what has been reported in the available 
literature. For example, sunscreen use alone 
is reported to have preventable fractions of 
9.3% and 14% for SCC and melanoma.17 
Productivity gains/losses resulting from 
health impacts (i.e. cancer cases prevented 
and premature deaths averted), were 
assessed with a productivity model previously 
developed.18 There are two techniques 
available in the productivity model to assess 
production impacts in the general economy; 
the Human Capital Approach (HCA) and 
the Friction Cost Approach (FCA). The HCA 
method counts all future income lost from 
an individual who leaves the workforce due 
to premature death or illness; whereas the 
FCA method assumes an individual will be 
replaced after a specified period and the 
production loss to the society is temporary. 
We applied both methods and report results 
from both modelling techniques. 
One-way sensitivity analysis was undertaken 
for key model parameters, including unit cost, 
productivity estimation and the incidence 
reduction attribution to the program. 
Results 
Skin cancer cost burden to the 
Victorian public hospital system
In 2012-13, there were 12,700 admissions to 
Victorian public hospitals for the treatment 
of melanoma and NMSC. With three AR-
DRG codes assigned to the various levels 
of complexity in skin cancer treatment, 
weighted treatment costs for melanoma and 
NMSC were estimated based on the numbers 
of admission service counts reported for 
each code. These public hospital admissions 
involved an estimated cost of $42 million; 
$13 million for melanoma and $29 million for 
NMSC (Table 3). 
There were about 14,000 outpatient clinic 
attendances for the management of 
melanoma and NMSC in the three reference 
public hospitals. These involved $3.3 million 
in healthcare costs, estimated from the 
number of outpatient attendances in each 
hospital, together with the ‘weighted average 
cost per outpatient attendance’ reported 
by the NHCDC. Extrapolation to a statewide 
estimate yielded a cost of $6 million to $13 
million, depending on the proportion of all 
public skin cancer patients treated in each 
hospital. 
Total costs incurred by the Victorian public 
hospital system for skin cancer management, 
combining both inpatient admissions and 
outpatient clinic attendances, was estimated 
to be between $49.3 million and $55.7 million 
in 2012-13. Moving beyond the impact on 
public hospitals, the cost burden of skin 
cancer on the broader hospital care system 
is enormous. According to the aggregated 
hospital admission statistics reported by 
Victorian ICS, only one-third of skin cancer 
patients were treated in the public hospital 
system. When private hospital admissions 
($72 million) were included in addition to the 
Table 2: Estimation of unit cost for NMSC admissions.

public hospital care, the total annual costs 
in Victoria were estimated at $121–$127 
million. These costs would be higher still 
if the substantial number of radiotherapy 
treatments carried out in non-admitted 
private facilities were included. 
Cost-effectiveness and investment 
return for skin cancer prevention
The Victorian SunSmart program prevented 
more than 43,000 cases of skin cancer, i.e. 
11,500 melanomas and 32,200 NMSCs, from 
1988 to 2011. The reduction in melanomas 
resulted in almost 1,400 premature deaths 
averted, which is equivalent to 43,900 life 
years saved or 31,200 life years with full health 
Health-Adjusted Life-Years (HALYs). 
From 1988 to 2011, the average SunSmart 
program expenditure was $1.7 million per 
year, equivalent to $0.37 per head in Victoria, 
compared to $0.19 per head in the two 
comparator states. Total expenditure over the 
1988 to 2011 period was $42 million. The cost 
to individuals through purchasing sunscreen 
and hats in accordance with skin cancer 
prevention key messages was estimated at 
$955 million over the same period. The cost to 
individuals was incurred by the private sector 
and was relevant to the broader ‘societal’ and 
full ‘health sector’ perspectives. Details of 
program cost, cost offsets, productivity gains 
and incremental net costs in respect to the 
different perspectives are presented in Table 
4. Health sector costs of $93.6 million were 
saved due to skin cancer cases prevented 
over the past 24 years. These cost offsets 
included $65.1 million for melanomas and 
$28.5 million for NMSCs.
From the government as ‘3rd party funder’ 
perspective, the cost offsets were greater 
than the program costs, which resulted in 
net savings. The incremental analysis showed 
that the comprehensive skin cancer program 
in Victoria not only saved lives, but achieved 
cost savings as well. In economic terminology, 
the intervention ‘dominates’ its comparator – 
the Victorian SunSmart program is both more 
effective and less costly. In terms of returns on 
investment, the Victorian SunSmart program 
achieved a return of $2.22 on every dollar 
spent by the Victorian Government in the 
program from 1988 to 2011.
Expanding to a broader ‘health sector’ 
perspective, the incremental analysis shows 
an ICER of $11,000 per LYS and $16,000 per 
HALY, when cost offsets were excluded. When 
cost offsets were included, the ICERs were 
$9,000 per LYS and $13,000 per HALY. All 
these results are considered cost-effective 
against a value for money threshold of 
‘<$50,000 per QALY’ commonly used in 
countries like Australia, the UK and Canada. 
From an even broader ‘societal’ perspective, 
inclusion of productivity gains using the HCA 
method indicates the intervention is again 
dominant with an even greater incremental 
benefit. In contrast, a net social cost of $337 
million was estimated with productivity 
impacts estimated by the more conservative 
FCA method. With FCA, the ICERs are $8,000 
per LYS and $11,000 per HALY from the 
societal perspective. Productivity gains 
to society result from the avoidance of 
premature death and early retirement, as 
well as from absenteeism associated with 
treatment activity. With the more commonly 
used HCA approach, the Victorian SunSmart 
program prevented more than $713 million 
in productivity losses to the general economy 
over the past 24 years. Estimated productivity 
gains of more than $68 million were achieved 
with the more conservative FCA method. 
Apart from different methods used in 
productivity estimation, the sensitivity 
analysis results show that changing the unit 
costs and the fraction of cancer reduction 
attributable to the program did not alter 
the conclusions based on the ICERs and 
investment return. Accordingly, we would 
regard the results as robust to variation in key 
assumptions.
Discussion
The cost burden estimates are based on 
the best information currently available 
for public analysis. While indicative rather 
than comprehensive, they do provide a 
much clearer picture of the substantial 
cost impact of skin cancer on the Victorian 
hospital system than we have had before.

high number of incidence cases; there is 
little doubt that skin cancer has a significant 
cost impact on the health care system, with 
NMSC alone representing the second highest 
healthcare expenditure among all cancers.4 
Ironically, skin cancer is also the most 
preventable cancer, and efficient, affordable 
and effective prevention programs are 
available.7,8 The Victorian SunSmart 
program has demonstrated successful 
outcomes in changing the attitudes and 
behaviours in sun protection by providing 
multi-faceted interventions and supportive 
environments.19,20 The SunSmart program is 
also very cost-effective, with an estimated 
cost saving of $2.20 for every dollar invested 
in the program. Proven prevention programs 
like SunSmart can impact substantially on 
the incidence of skin cancer. Over time, 
skin cancer prevention offers the important 
potential to redirect some of the $56 million 
impact on Victorian public hospitals each year 
to other non-preventable diseases. Based on 
the present study, the cost per head incurred 
by skin cancer treatment in Victoria was in the 
range of $9.20 (low estimate) to $10.39 (high 
estimate) in 2012-13. Compared with the cost 
in Victoria of skin cancer prevention of $0.37 
per head, this adds weight to arguments to 
increase resources going into prevention.
Accurate cost studies require well-defined 
and complete data sources, together 
with rigorous analysis and associated 
sensitivity analysis. In this study, the data 
for inpatient costs (hospital admissions) 
was comprehensive in that we were able 
to obtain statewide statistics from the 
Victorian Integrated Cancer Service (ICS). 
In contrast, data available for outpatient 
services was less complete. We were able 
to obtain information from three hospitals 
for our ICS and statewide estimates. It is 
problematic whether quantity of service data 
from one hospital transfers readily to other 
hospitals with different data collection and 
reporting systems. More importantly, the 
profile of skin cancer patients differs from 
hospital to hospital, as does clinical practice. 
Extrapolation from three hospitals to the ICS 
and then on to the statewide estimate may 
overestimate the outpatient costs, as these 
three hospitals are major treatment centres 
within their ICS and complex treatment 
with higher costs are usually performed in 
the major centres. On the other hand, we 
adopted conservative parameters in our 
assumptions to help counter such biases. For 
example, the assumption on the number of 
NMSC outpatient clinic visits for Hospital A 
was assumed to be 4~5 times per admitted 
patient, similar to Hospital C with 4.3 per 
admitted patient, rather than the average 
visit of 7.1 per admitted patient reported 
elsewhere.
Further, many skin cancers are treated in 
multiple clinics (e.g. plastic surgery and 
dermatology) mixed with other diseases and 
conditions. In Hospital B, only patients with 
skin cancer diagnosis (ICD code C44) who 
had had radiotherapy contact were included 
in the outpatient clinic attendance estimate 
due to data availability. This is certainly an 
underestimate of what would have occurred, 
as not every skin cancer, in particular NMSC, 
requires radiotherapy. 
Our cost estimations necessarily involved 
assumptions. It may be worthwhile for more 
comprehensive sensitivity analysis to be 
conducted than that possible in the present 
paper, to fully test these assumptions. 
In particular, the unit costs adopted for 
admission for both melanoma and NMSC 
could be further explored. It is unclear 
whether the proportion of patients we used 
in the three levels of complexity in skin cancer 
malignancy admission is truly representative 
or not. Most people consider treatment for 
NMSC involves less complex procedures and 
would be treated in less costly GP/specialist 
clinic rooms. Thus it is not clear whether the 
NMSC cases admitted to public hospitals 
are in a more severe disease spectrum 
and therefore the cost (nearly $3,000 per 
separation) is higher than usually thought. 
On the other hand, there are substantial 
costs incurred in the private settings of 
Australian healthcare system, including care 
from GPs, specialists and private hospitals, 
which are not reported in this paper. Our 
study demonstrates substantial healthcare 
resources consumed in managing skin cancer 
each year in the public hospital system only. 
If the costs incurred in the private sector were 
included, the healthcare spending would 
have been significantly higher.
Cost of illness studies rely on complete 
and reliable data sources for accuracy. The 
collection of incidence and prevalence 
for skin cancers, in particular NMSC, is 
lacking. As NMSC is not routinely collected 
by cancer registries, there is a need for 
an alternative data collection to facilitate 
economic analysis of skin cancers as well 
as evaluation of prevention programs. Four 
potential models to collect national data on 
the incidence of NMSC were recommended 
by Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 
during an House of Representative Standing 
Committee on Health inquiry into skin cancer 
in Australia.1 While collecting NMSC data is 
challenging, it is important to collect it at a 
regular intervals due to its significant burden 
on Australian health system. 
Conclusions
Our study results demonstrate that 
substantial healthcare resources are 
consumed in managing skin cancer each 
year in the public hospital system, much 
of which was potentially preventable. In 
addition, there are substantial costs incurred 
in private settings, including care from GPs, 
specialists and private hospitals. Effective 
skin cancer prevention programs such as 
SunSmart are not only saving lives, they are 
saving substantial costs that would otherwise 
be incurred via treatment services. Our study 
suggests an investment return of $2.20 is 
achieved on every dollar invested in the 
Victorian SunSmart program. Compared 
to public hospital spending on skin cancer 
treatment of around $10 per head, the case 
for increased investment in prevention 
from the current level of $0.37 per head is 
compelling. 
Implications for public health
There is a common saying that “An ounce 
of prevention is better than a pound of 
cure”
. While to the economist such sayings 
need to be underpinned by valid economic 
evaluation, skin cancer is an excellent 
example of how true this saying can be. 
Currently, spending on skin cancer treatment 
far outweighs the investment in prevention, 
as indicated by our analysis and also those 
prevailing in the Australian health system. 
Skin cancer prevention programs have 
proven to be effective and cost-effective 
time after time over the past 10 years or so. 
Increased funding for skin cancer prevention 
must be kept high on the public health 
agenda. Hospitals would also benefit from 
being able to redirect resources to non-
preventable conditions.
