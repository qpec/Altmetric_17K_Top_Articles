Abstract
Introduction
The purpose of this study was to explore the viewpoints of parents of young people with
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in relation to their child’s transition to adulthood.
Methods
Data were collected during four structured focus groups with 19 parents of young people
with ASD with average to high intellectual capacities. Condensed meaning units were identi-
fied and checked during focus groups, and were subsequently linked to the International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).
Results
Three major themes emerged: to be understood, to understand the world and to succeed.
The ICF domains of activity and participation and environmental factors emerged as having
the greatest potential to influence transition outcomes.
Conclusions
Policies and services should focus on strengths to maximise participation in higher educa-
tion, employment and independent living amongst young people with ASD. Interventions tar-
geting environmental factors could be effective in improving participation in adult life.
Person-centred and individualised approaches could further complement this approach sup-
porting the transition to adulthood for people with ASD, ultimately improving outcomes in
adulthood.

 Introduction
Leaving school and transitioning to adulthood presents challenges for all adolescents and their
families, however this can be particularly stressful period for families living with disabilities
including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) [1]. The estimated prevalence of ASD has been
gradually increasing and is now thought to be approximately 1% across the lifespan [2, 3]. This
trend is likely to continue as evidenced by the Australian context, where 75% of people diag-
nosed with ASD are 19 years old or younger [4]. While young people with ASD are ambitious
and aspirational [5], they commonly experience poor transition outcomes including unem-
ployment [6], limited participation in further education [7] and low rates of independent living
[8], with most having few friendships [9, 10].
Poor vocational and educational outcomes are sustained across the lifespan for those with
ASD with average or above average intellectual capacities [11], outcomes resulting at least in
part from the limited appropriate and affordable services available to this population as they
transition into adulthood [5]. Current services are constrained by funding limitations and pro-
fessionals appropriately trained to work with adults with ASD [11, 12]; having been criticised
for lacking coherence and evidence to support the efficacy of their interventions [13, 14]. This
service environment results in many young people with ASD and their families experiencing
high levels of unmet needs [5], and struggling to navigate the transition process largely by
themselves [15].
Education is recognised as a basic human right [16]; in Australia equity in education
has been supported by the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) [17]. The DDA [17] has
a strong focus on promotion of equity through social inclusion, and has positively impacted
the education of people with disabilities[18] evidenced by the 94% increase in students
with disabilities attending university since 2008 [19]. However, the DDA [17] does not
mandate transition planning, a recognised gap in the current system [20], with many young
people with disabilities still struggling to find clear pathways during their transition to
adulthood.
Families are an integral support to their young person with ASD as they transition to
adulthood [21]. Parents continue to be a major source of support and advocacy for
young people with ASD even as they move into adult life [22], and focuss primarily on secur-
ing an acceptable future for their young person’s life [23]. The value of familial support in
improving transition outcomes is evident in its positive impact on employment post-
school [24], and in the role that parental expectations play in mediating the relationship
between leaving school and outcomes in adulthood [25]. However, the finding that parental
expectations for transition outcomes are lower for parents of children with ASD than for
parents of children with intellectual disability or multiple disabilities is cause for concern
[26].
Person-centred approaches have been suggested as a means of addressing the needs of the
young person with ASD during the transition to adulthood [27]. However, the development
of such approaches are constrained by a lack of knowledge and understanding of the experi-
ences, hopes and wishes of parents of young people with ASD as they transition to adulthood.
This is problematic, as support services decrease as young people with ASD move into adult
life [28]. The overall aim of this study was to explore the experience of parents during the
transition to adulthood for young adults with ASD. Specific research objectives included
identifying factors that supported the transition process and unmet needs during this period
in Australia.

 Method
Design
An inductive approach was utilised to gain an understanding of the experience of families of
young adults with ASD in normative IQ range as they transition to adulthood [29], from here
on in this article this population of interest will be referred to by the term ASD. Structured
focus groups were selected as the most appropriate data collection strategy, as the group
dynamics allowed parents to construct a shared understanding of the experiences, expanding
on the perspectives of individual participants, and enabling coverage of a wide range of topics
in an efficient manner [30]. Structured focus group method is a variant on the traditional
focus group method in that it provides the participants with information to guide the discus-
sion after commencing with an open-ended question [30]. The group process was guided
using stimulus questions that focused the discussion on transition to adulthood for young peo-
ple with ASD [31]. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
(ICF) [32] guided data collection and analysis, as part of a directed content analysis approach
[33]. The ICF is a biopsychosocial model that conceptualises the dynamic and bi-directional
interaction between health conditions, activities and contextual factors [32, 34]. Education is
recognised as a basic human right [16]; in Australia equity in education has been supported by
the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) [17]. The DDA [17] has a strong focus on promotion
of equity through social inclusion, and has positively impacted the education of people with
disabilities[18] evidenced by the 94% increase in students with disabilities attending university
since 2008 [19]. However, the DDA [17] does not mandate transition planning, a recognised
gap in the current system [18], with many young people with disability still struggling to find
clear pathways during their transition to adulthood.
Participants
Nineteen parents of young people with ASD, including Asperger’s Syndrome, were recruited
to participate in four structured focus groups. Recruitment was conducted using purposive
and snowball sampling, via the Autism Association of Western Australia and Autism West.
Participants self-selected as a “parent of a young person (aged 18–30) with ASD”. Parents
required adequate English language skills to participate in a group discussion and needed to be
available to attend one of the four scheduled groups. Although 21 parents initially agreed to
participate in the focus groups, two parents did not attend due to other commitments.
Of the 19 parents who participated in the structured focus groups, the majority were
mothers (n = 14), four were fathers and one was a step-father. Thirteen participants were part-
nered and they tended to have good socioeconomic status, with higher than average incomes
(median = AU$80,000 –AU$100,000 per year, with a range of less than AU$20,000 to more
than AU$100,000). All but two parents held university qualifications and 14 parents were in
paid employment. Five of the parents were not in employment, citing their child’s ASD as the
reason for their lack of workforce participation.
The parents reported on 15 male and seven female young people with ASD (Table 1), with
an average age of 20.1 years (SD = 2.0). The young people had typically received a diagnosis on
average at 4.5 years of age (SD = 1.0) with an average overall total score on the Social Respon-
siveness Scale—Second Edition (SRS-2) [35] as reported by their parents of 105.04 (SD = 25.9),
with a range of 31 to 144, equating to very low to severe symptomology (S1 Table). The range
of results from the SRS Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behaviour sub-scale was 6–34
(mean = 20.3; SD = 6.2) and the SRS Social Communication and Interaction was 41–114
(mean = 83.7; SD = 20.8), suggestive of a range of very mild to severe symptomology. At the

 time of the focus groups eight of the young people had completed a university qualification,
with six yet to complete secondary schooling, ten were studying full-time and three were in
paid employment. Three of the young people were unemployed, but not seeking work and a
further five were seeking work and one was participating in an alternative to employment pro-
gramme. The vast majority (19) of the young people were living in the family home; however,
two lived in individual accommodation with support and one in shared accommodation with
support.

 lifespan utilised the SRS-2 to corroborate DSM-5 ASD diagnostic criteria with good conver-
gence [40].
Procedure
The structured focus groups took place at a private clinic in the Perth metropolitan region,
scheduled across four weekday evenings, lasting between two to three hours. Prior to com-
mencing each group, parents had had no prior contact with any of the researchers. Following
informed consent, parents completed the sociodemographic questionnaire [36] and SRS-2
[35]. The lead author, a researcher with psychology and occupational therapy qualifications,
facilitated the focus groups. The facilitator was supported by another researcher who recorded
data (key statements) into a spreadsheet and took field notes. Digital voice recorders allowed
for post-hoc revision of key statements.
At the commencement of each group, parents were provided with stimulus material in both
written and verbal form. The stimulus question was based on contemporary views of young
adulthood proposed by Blatterer [41] and posed the question, “Thinking about your child with
ASD what would help them move into adult life?” Parents were encouraged to think broadly
about their children’s transition to adulthood, encompassing leaving school, seeking employ-
ment, intimate relationships, learning to drive, changes in accommodation and self-determi-
nation in decisions. Prior to the focus groups, the stimulus material was piloted in a forum
with 11 participants who had a range of personal and professional relationships with people
with ASD. The question fostered initial open discussion between participants, with follow-up
questions from the facilitator promoting interaction and discussion.
Data collection and in-vivo data analysis. Group discussions began with the facilitator
recording keywords of the discussion on a whiteboard. Subsequently, participants added to the
discussion and expanded their ideas. In collaboration with participants, meaning units raised
were grouped together, with duplicates removed and units defined and condensed on a white-
board. This strategy of expanding and then refining discussions allowed the researcher to code
the condensed meaning units in-vivo with the participants. A second researcher transcribed
these condensed meaning units into Microsoft Excel which were then provided to participants
for member checking [42].
After a refreshment break a printed copy of the condensed meaning units was provided to
each participant who were then asked to rank the three most important requirements for a
person with ASD to successfully transition to adult life. Subsequently, participants were asked
to rate each condensed meaning unit according to current status of the requirements for suc-
cessful transition (on a 5 point scale, where 1 = poor current status and 5 = excellent current
status). Participants were unaware that they would rate current status at the time they ranked
the three most important condensed meaning units. The rankings and ratings were immedi-
ately entered into Microsoft Excel enabling in situ comparison and group discussion of the rel-
ative importance and status of units (see S2 Table). Participants considered whether the output
was an accurate representation of the discussion and if anything had been omitted from the
discussion. This process simultaneously served to identify the subcategories from focus group
discussions and enable member checking, therefore increasing the trustworthiness of the data
[43]. Patterns in the data of the fourth focus group supported the conclsion that saturation had
been achieved, so data collection ceased [30].
Data analysis.
Data analysis occurred in three stages: (1) in-vivo analysis during the focus
groups (as described above), (2) coding findings against the ICF and (3) thematic analysis of
the data. Secondary coding of the findings involved compiling the condensed meaning units
from the four focus groups into codes and linking these to the ICF according to the process

 identified by Cieza and colleagues [44]. This involved identifying the meaningful concepts
within each unit, and linking it with the most appropriate code(s). For example the code “men-
toring at work and study” is associated with the condensed meaning unit “having access to
supports at work”, which contains the meaningful concepts of “access”, “supports” and
“work”. Hence, the ICF constructs of “interpersonal interactions and relationships, other spec-
ified (d798)”, “maintaining a job (d8451)” and “support and relationships, other specified
(e398)” were selected. Systematically linking the condensed meaning units to all applicable
ICF constructs [44] was completed through a process of consensus between the authors. This
linking process was aided by visually representing the coded meaning units in relation to ICF
constructs using Microsoft Visio.
Finally, the third stage of data analysis involved thematic analysis of the condensed meaning
units grouping them into themes, associated categories and sub-categories using directed con-
tent analysis [33]. This process occurred through collaboration between researchers, and
involved review of the meaning units identified during the focus groups.
Ethical issues
This study was approved by the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (HR
16/2014), written consent was obtained from all participants and all data have been managed
as per the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research [45].
Results
Stage 1: Focus group in-vivo results
During the focus groups the participants raised 281 ideas relating to the potential facilitators of
transition to adult life for their child with ASD (focus group median number of units = 58,
range = 32–133 per group). These were distilled into 132 condensed meaning units (focus
group median = 33.5, range = 28–37 per group) highlighting parents’ views of the importance
of activity participation for their young adults with ASD and the impact of the environment
on outcomes (see S2 Table). Across all four focus groups discussions centred on the contrast
between the requirements important in a successful transition and parents’ perception of the
current status. The key discrepancies related to community awareness of focusing on strengths
(Focus Group 1—“importance of people having a positive attitude towards people with ASD”)
and equal opportunities (Group 2—“equal opportunity to embrace ASD” and the “need for
social supports”; Group 4 –“work environment with social interaction”), along with services to
facilitate success (Group 1 –“access to information through an information centre”). In contrast,
group three overall described good current performance for the three most important con-
densed meaning units, which were all related to service provision (“people who create jobs for
young adults with ASD”, “services needed to focus on the individual” and “higher education pro-
viders that understand our children’s needs”). The condensed meaning units and the summed
importance rankings and average current performance ratings for each focus group are pro-
vided in S2 Table.
Stage 2: Linkage to the ICF
The condensed meaning units identified in the four focus groups were compiled and distilled
to create 22 codes (S3–S5 Tables) that were linked to the ICF, and with 45.2% of the condensed
meaning units linking with the Environmental Factors domain (Table 2), 52.0% against the
Participation domain (Table 3) and 2.7% against the Body Function domain (Table 4). The
focus group discussions focused on the engagement in Participation in learning and applying

 knowledge (d1), self-care (d5), domestic life (d6), interpersonal interactions and relationships
(d7), major life areas (d8), and community, social and civic life (d9). The focus group data
indicated that engagement in these major life areas could be mediated by contextual factors in
the Environment, including support and relationships (e3), attitudes (e4) and services, systems
and policies (e5). For example, the attitudes of friends, family, peers and people in authority
was described as potentially both an enabler and barrier participation. The most relevant con-
struct in the body function domain was mental functions (b1), which was also described as a
potential mediator of participation.
Stage 3: Interpretation of findings
Thematic coding of meaning units from the focus groups data resulted in three main themes:
to be understood, to understand the world and to succeed. These themes corresponded with
the findings from the linkage of meaning units with the ICF, highlighting the importance of
environmental aspects in transition. While the discussions within each focus group were subtly
different, thematic coding revealed the data were captured within these three main themes.
To be understood.
The theme of to be understood centred around parents’ wishes for
their children to be understood by their family, peers, employers, teachers and by society in
general. Parents described their wish to have the strengths of their child with ASD recognised
without prejudice. Parents desired that their children be afforded equal opportunities, which
they believed in part were dependent on remediating environmental barriers, see S3 Table.
The theme of to be understood is illustrated by the following quote:
“. . . employers having an understanding of autism, that is actually the trickiest bit,”
To understand the world. The parents aspired for their children to understand the
world, in terms of the social and institutional worlds in which they lived. Helping their chil-
dren to understand the world involved preparation and support for independence and social
integration are available in S4 Table. Parents referred to the mechanisms that supported their
children’s understanding including the value of mentors in areas of education and work.
Parents reported that mentors were at times able to act as advocates for their young person
with ASD, an important role particularly given their children’s challenges with self-advocacy.
Parents also expressed their hope that a mentor or other support person could help their
young person with ASD understand the value of completing self-care tasks, such as teeth clean-
ing. While parents highly valued mentors they highlighted that they needed to be consistent
and reliable, pointing to the negative impact of mentors changing or reneging on their com-
mitments. In absence of a peer mentor, the advocacy role for the young person with ASD fell
to parents, which was described as having a negative impact on the parent-child relationship.
Institutional supports were highly valued by parents, specifically those from schools includ-
ing planning for transition early and building life skills through work experience and life skills

 training. However, parents believed that further improvements would result from more indi-
vidualised tailoring of the curriculum to meet the needs of their young adults, specifically
through the inclusion of more social skills and daily living training.
The theme of to understand the world can be illustrated by the following quote:
“. . . someone who knew what it was like for them following them around telling them this is
what you do. . .. Not for the job learning, but for the social aspects. . .”
To succeed
Parents expressed their desire for their young people with ASD to succeed and to reach their
potential. The categories and subcategories associated with the theme to succeed are described
in available in S4 Table. Parents discussed the idea that their children should be given the
opportunities and supports to succeed in the areas of work and study. Parents reiterated the
importance of their young person being afforded opportunities to experience success by
leveraging their special interests and strengths, potentially fostering their motivation, resulting
in positive experiences and building self-confidence. Parents discussed the possibility that
some aspects of ASD, given the right environment and opportunities, could be harnessed and
help their children to succeed.
Living arrangements were discussed at length by parents, but their definitions of ‘successful’
living arrangements were highly individualised. Many preferred semi-detached living arrange-
ments, such as a “granny flat” or a self-contained studio within the family home, preferences
linked with the realisation that their young person was likely to need ongoing support in their
daily lives. Others described their aspirations for their child to live independently in their own
homes, see S5 Table.
The theme of to succeed can be illustrated by the following quote:
“. . . they need self-belief, self-efficacy. They are so often told what they can’t do and when they
get some positive feedback they feel great.”
Relationships with the ICF. In relation to the ICF the theme to be understood contributes
to several areas. The majority of subcategories within this theme mapped against the domain
of the environment. However, it also links to constructs within body functions and personal fac-
tors. The theme to understand the world can be mapped predominantly to the ICF domain of
the environment. However, it also links to the ICF domains of body function and personal fac-
tors. To succeed links to several domains of the ICF, with the majority of the subcategories in
this theme linking to constructs within the environment domain. It also mapped to constructs
within the domains of body functions and personal factors. S3–S5 Tables outline the themes,
categories and subcategories mapped according to the ICF.
Discussion
Young people with ASD predominantly live in the family home and parents continue to play a
vital role in the transition to adulthood [9, 46, 47], giving credence to their perspective in
understanding the transition to adulthood of young people with ASD within the normative IQ
range. The perspectives of parents and adolescents’ perceptions may diverge during this
period, and future research should explore the views of young adults with ASD. However, it is
unlikely that focus groups or interviews enable optimal qualitative data collection in this group

 given their communication difficulties, as such alternative techniques such as Q-methodology
should be considered [48–50]. While representative sampling and generalisation is not the
goal of qualitative research, findings from this study are potentially transferable [51], as they
provide an in-depth description of the perspective or parents of young adults with ASD in the
normative IQ range. The authors identified three themes from the data: to be understood, to
understand the world and to succeed. These themes have the potential to influence service
design and provision for young people and parents alike.
To be understood
The theme to be understood highlights the belief of parents that young people with ASD are
marginalised because of their diagnostic characteristics, and particularly because of their social
deficits [52]. The parents suggested that this was especially problematic given that ASD does
not have any physical markers, and in the absence of an intellectual disability, there was an
assumption that their children required little or no assistance. The social deficits of ASD con-
tinue to have implications for an individual even if they have an average or above average IQ
[53], and they require understanding from employers [54], education providers, and service
providers to facilitate their full participation in society.
To be understood encompassed participants’ belief that aspects of ASD could be harnessed
in a strengths-based approach, suggesting a move beyond equal opportunity to approaches
which recognise the specialised skills and abilities of people with ASD. This shift in paradigm
to a strengths-based approach, rather than the historical deficit viewpoint, was reiterated
across the focus groups [55]. Data analysis revealed that this idea was also linked with the
importance of person-centred approaches in improving outcomes for young people with ASD
[56].
To be understood highlighted the importance of maximising the person-environment fit of
these young people. Flexible work practices tailored to the needs of the individual with ASD
can facilitate workplace success and fit [50]. Maximising this fit includes ensuring employers
and colleagues are knowledgeable of the characteristics of people with ASD, who may require
accommodations such as minimising external stimuli and a workplace that is predictable and
supportive [50]. The role that being understood plays in facilitating workplace success for peo-
ple with ASD [50, 57, 58] is evident in the finding that while employees with ASD still require
support in ASD specific workplaces it is substantially less than in open employment [57]. A
holistic understanding of people with ASD should encompass the notion that many possess
strengths and abilities that are advantageous in the workplace and that can be utilised in soci-
ety [58, 59]. Fundamental to this understanding is recognition of individuality of people with
ASD [55, 60], and the role of tailored services and supports in meeting their needs and capita-
lising on their strengths. While participants in this study recognised that a person-centred
approach is already evident in some services [56], there is significant room for improvement.
To understand the world
The parents also recognised the bidirectional relationship between their young person with
ASD and society, recognising the need for their young person with ASD to understand the
world. This theme highlighted the challenges that young people with ASD experience with
some aspects of social interaction, such as emotion recognition and symbolic communication
[59]. While there has been hope that these difficulties would be in part be remediated by early
intervention [61], the experience of the parents in these focus groups suggest that there is a
need for life-long treatment options [62]. Peer mentoring is one possible life-long approach
that provides an opportunity for a young person with ASD to learn in vivo about their

 environment, avoiding the need to translate skills from training contexts to real-life [63]. Peer
mentoring could potentially reduce the requirement for parents’ to support their young person
with ASD in some situations, positively impacting on the relationship between parents and
their young person with ASD [64].
To succeed
The final theme to succeed was characterised by parents expressing their desire for their young
person to become a successful adult, however, parents’ definitions of success varied greatly.
For an individual with ASD success as an adult is facilitated by finding their niche [65] and
building self-efficacy through performance mastery [58, 66]. Matching the strengths and skills
of adults with ASD to employment environments and tasks fosters success [57] and reduces
the need for support [57], contributing to a positive employment relationship likely to perpetu-
ate success in other life areas [50, 67].
The use of the ICF
This study demonstrated the utility of the ICF in research, providing a framework which
facilitated data analysis. By elucidating the areas of greatest potential need, the ICF provides
important information to researchers and clinicians on the directions for future research and
intervention targets [55]. The use of the universal taxonomy of the ICF enables the data to be
interpreted and utilised by various professionals and sectors. Overall, the findings from this
research highlight the environment as a potential mediating factor in supporting young people
with ASD in their transition to adulthood and their participation in major life areas. The holis-
tic examination of ASD using the ICF in this study and in other projects such as the ASD core
sets (53, 58, 66, 67), highlight the strengths of people with ASD. Individualised and strengths-
based approaches that utilise environmental adaptation could ultimately, improve outcomes
for adults with ASD (58).
The findings of this study should be interpreted with the following limitations in mind. The
majority of participants were members of various Autism associations, which may have shaped
their experiences. Participants were from relatively high socioeconomic backgrounds and
likely to have had access to significant financial resources. Their experiences may not represent
those with fewer economic resources. It should also be noted that this study did not describe
the experiences of parents of people with ASD who had an intellectual disability, but rather
provided an in-depth description of those in the normative range. The results also need to be
interpreted with some caution as the study did not explore the viewpoints of young people
with ASD. While the study sample was small, purposive sampling enabled a rich exploration of
the phenomenon serving to enhance the trustworthiness of the data, specifically the transfer-
ability of the findings [68].
There is a paucity of evidence addressing the transition to adulthood for young people with
ASD. Findings from this research highlight that the environment as an important factor in
influencing transition outcomes. Future research should examine how the environment can be
modified to facilitate success and how individuals can be guided to seek out a future which
meets their aspirations. It would also be of interest to further examine how gaining employ-
ment for people with ASD can be fostered and maintained. While this study provided an in-
depth description of the viewpoints of parents of young adults with ASD, a similar study
should be undertaken with young people with ASD themselves and parents of youth with ASD
and an intellectual disability.

 Conclusion
The findings from these focus groups highlight the potential of modifying the environment as
an approach in working with young people with ASD [69, 70]. Such environmental adapta-
tions could augment other interventions for young people with ASD and ultimately serve to
support their participation in major life areas. Transition to adulthood represents a critical
period for young people with ASD and their families, a time when supports are needed to max-
imise the opportunities for young people with ASD to achieve their ambitions and participate
fully in society [71].
