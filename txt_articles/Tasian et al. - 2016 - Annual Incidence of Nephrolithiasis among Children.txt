Abstract
Background and objectives The prevalence of nephrolithiasis in the United States has increased substantially, but
recent changes in incidence with respect to age, sex, and race are not well characterized. This study examined
temporal trends in the annual incidence and cumulative risk of nephrolithiasis among children and adults living
in South Carolina over a 16-year period.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements We performed a population–based, repeated cross–sectional study
using the US Census and South Carolina Medical Encounter data, which capture all emergency department visits,
surgeries, and admissions in the state. The annual incidence of nephrolithiasis in South Carolina from 1997 to
2012 was estimated, and linear mixed models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios for age, sex, and racial
groups. The cumulative risk of nephrolithiasis during childhood and over the lifetime was estimated for males
and females in 1997 and 2012.
Results Among an at-risk population of 4,625,364 people, 152,925 unique patients received emergency, inpatient,
or surgical care for nephrolithiasis. Between 1997 and 2012, the mean annual incidence of nephrolithiasis
increased 1% annually from 206 to 239 per 100,000 persons. Among age groups, the greatest increase was
observed among 15–19 year olds, in whom incidence increased 26% per 5 years (incidence rate ratio, 1.26; 95%
confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.29). Adjusting for age and race, incidence increased 15% per 5 years among females
(incidence rate ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.14 to 1.16) but remained stable for males. The incidence
among blacks increased 15% more per 5 years compared with whites (incidence rate ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence
interval, 1.14 to 1.17). These changes in incidence resulted in doubling of the risk of nephrolithiasis during
childhood and a 45% increase in the lifetime risk of nephrolithiasis for women over the study period.
Conclusions The incidence of kidney stones has increased among young patients, particularly women, and
blacks.

Introduction
Kidney stone disease (nephrolithiasis) is a systemic
metabolic disorder associated with increased risks
of cardiovascular disease and CKD in adults and
fracture in children and adults (1–3), and it has an-
nual costs .$5.1 billion (4). The estimated prevalence
of nephrolithiasis in the United States increased from
5.2% (1988–1994) to 8.8% (2007–2010) (5,6). Histori-
cally, the prevalence of nephrolithiasis has been
highest among middle–aged, white men (5,6). How-
ever, over the last 25 years, there were smaller
changes in the prevalence among men than women,
and there have been reports of increasing fre-
quency of nephrolithiasis among children and ado-
lescents (7–10).
The populations at increasing risk for nephrolithiasis
remain unclear, because previous studies ascertained
only a history of kidney stones without describing
the age of onset (5,6), and most prior studies included
only children or adults (5–11) or had small sample
sizes that precluded examination of interactions be-
tween age, sex, and race (12,13). Understanding
changes in kidney stone incidence is critical to defin-
ing research priorities and developing strategies to
improve health care delivery, particularly for those
in whom nephrolithiasis was historically rare.
We performed a population-based study in South
Carolina from 1997 to 2012 to describe nephrolithiasis
incidence rates in different age, race, and sex groups
and estimate the cumulative risk of nephrolithiasis
during childhood and over the lifetime.
Materials and Methods
We performed a repeated cross–sectional study to
estimate the annual incidence of nephrolithiasis
among the population of South Carolina from Janu-
ary 1, 1997 to December 31, 2012. We used South
Carolina Medical Encounter Data and Financial Re-
ports, which contain individual patient–level data

 using encounter–level data elements, including unique
patient identifiers; zip code of patient’s mailing address;
dates of services; International Classification of Dis-
eases, 9th revision (ICD-9) codes; and payer classifica-
tion. The database, by law, captures all emergency
department (ED) visits, surgeries, and hospital admis-
sions for South Carolina’s population, including those
who are uninsured or have government insurance. Data
are sent by all health care facilities in the state on a
monthly basis. By law, all data must be 99.9% accurate
(valid codes) and 99.5% complete (nonmissing). Routine
audits are performed to ensure compliance and accu-
racy (14).
We included all patients who had encounters between
1997 and 2012 associated with primary ICD-9 diagnosis
codes for nephrolithiasis. To reduce misclassification of
prevalent stone diagnoses, we excluded patients who had
secondary ICD-9 codes for nephrolithiasis before the
primary code. Beginning in 1996, we used a 1-year look-
back for secondary ICD-9 codes to identify and exclude
prior stone diagnoses. We excluded patients with residen-
tial zip codes outside South Carolina, those with missing
geographic or demographic data, and individuals self-
identified as Hispanic (,2% of population) because of con-
flation of race and ethnicity in the dataset.
Kidney Stone Incidence
Kidney stone presentation was defined as ED, inpatient,
or surgical care for a primary diagnosis of nephrolithiasis
(Supplemental Table). These criteria likely capture nearly
all clinically important stone events because of the acute
nature of stone episodes that require emergency evalua-
tion, hospital admission, and/or surgery (8,9,15). The first
qualifying claim defined the date of presentation. Out-
comes among unique individuals were limited to the ear-
liest occurrence to avoid counting patients with recurrent
stones multiple times.
Aggregated at the county level, patients who presented
with kidney stones were combined with the corresponding
age–, sex–, and race–specific populations from the 2000
and 2010 US Censuses using linear extrapolation for inter-
census years (16). Annual incidences were calculated by
dividing the number of unique patients with kidney stones
by the at-risk population stratified by age, sex, and race.
Because kidney stones in any given year are rare, we as-
sumed that the whole population was at risk. We catego-
rized age to reflect developmental phases of childhood
and ranges in which the prevalence of nephrolithiasis is
similar among adults (6). Native Hawaiian, Native Amer-
ican, Asian, and mixed race patients were classified as
other because of small sample sizes and resultant unstable
annual incidences among individual races.
Statistical Analyses
We used Bayesian generalized linear mixed models with
random intercepts for county of residence to estimate
incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of nephrolithiasis (17). We used
six models to examine changes in nephrolithiasis incidence
among age groups, sexes, and races across time. Model 1
included an interaction term between age and year to es-
timate changes in incidence within age groups adjusting
for race and sex. Model 2 included an interaction term
between sex and year to estimate changes in incidence
among males and females adjusting for race and age.
Model 3 included a three-way interaction between age,
sex, and year to estimate sex differences in incidence rates
by age group over time adjusting for race. Model 4 in-
cluded an interaction term between race and year to esti-
mate changes in incidence among racial groups adjusting
for sex and age. Model 5 included a three-way interaction
between race, sex, and year to estimate sex differences in
incidence over time for different racial groups adjusting
for age. Model 6 included a three-way interaction between
age, race, and year to estimate racial differences in inci-
dence rates by age group adjusting for sex. Models in-
cluded all lower–order interaction terms and main effects
for the variables included in the interaction terms. Statis-
tical significance was defined by exclusion of zero in the
posterior 95% confidence interval (95% CI).
The cumulative risk of nephrolithiasis, defined as the
population-level risk of developing nephrolithiasis
during a certain age span assuming no other causes of
death, was calculated for females and males in 1997 and 2012

local institutional review board and exempted from review.
Results
Kidney Stone Incidence
From 1997 to 2012, 152,925 children and adults received
ED, inpatient, or surgical care for nephrolithiasis among a
population of 4,625,364 people (Figure 1, Table 1). The
observed mean annual incidence of nephrolithiasis from
1997 to 2012 was 226 per 100,000 persons. Unadjusted
mean annual incidence was highest for 35–44 year olds
(336 per 100,000 persons) and lowest for ,10 year olds
(four per 100,000 persons). From an unadjusted regres-
sion model (Supplemental Material), incidence increased
an estimated 5% per 5 years (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04 to
1.06) from 206 per 100,000 persons in 1997 to 239 per
100,000 persons in 2012. In any given year, adjusting for
race, annual incidence was higher among females ages
10–24 years old than among males the same age. The
annual incidence of nephrolithiasis was 52% higher
among 15- to 19-year-old females than males the same
age. Nephrolithiasis was more common among men be-
ginning at 25 years old.
Changes in Kidney Stone Incidence by Age, Sex, and Race
For ease of interpretation, we present group-level
changes in incidence over time (Figure 2, Tables 2–7). As-
sociated model coefficients and 95% CIs are displayed in
Supplemental Material. Effect modification was deemed
statistically significant if zero was excluded from the
95% CIs of the interaction terms. Adjusting for sex and
race, the incidence for 15–19 year olds increased an esti-
mated 26% per 5 years (IRR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.29)

 (Table 2), which was statistically significant compared
with the 5-year increase for ,10 year olds. Adjusting for
age and race, the incidence of nephrolithiasis among fe-
males increased an estimated 15% per 5 years (IRR, 1.15;
95% CI, 1.14 to 1.16) and was stable among males (IRR,
0.99; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.00) (Table 3). Moreover, differences
in annual incidences between males and females de-
creased statistically significantly over the study period,
which was evidenced by the negative coefficient for the
sex-by-year interaction term in Supplemental Material.
No statistically significant three–way interaction was ob-
served between change over time, age, and sex adjusting
for race (Table 4). However, a general pattern of sex dif-
ferences in age–specific incidence rates was found. Kid-
ney stone incidences increased 10%–28% per 5 years for
females, with highest rates among 10–19 year olds. Inci-
dence changed ,5% per 5 years in men .25 years old
(Table 4).
Adjusting for age and sex, the changes in kidney stone
incidence over time were significantly modified by race
(Table 5). The incidence increased an estimated 3% per 5
years among whites (IRR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.03) com-
pared with an estimated 15% increase among blacks (IRR,
1.15; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.17) (Table 5). There was evidence
of a three-way interaction between race, sex, and time ad-
justing for age (Table 6): the estimated changes in inci-
dence over time were greater among black females than
black males. Adjusting for sex, there was little evidence of a
three-way interaction between race, age, and time (Table 7).
However, changes in incidence over time were greater
among blacks than whites in all age groups, with the excep-
tion of 10–14 year olds (Table 7).
Cumulative Risk of Nephrolithiasis during Childhood and
over the Lifetime
Between 1997 and 2012, the cumulative risk of neph-
rolithiasis during childhood increased similarly among
girls (87%) and boys (90%), although the risk in 2012 was
modest at 0.9% and 0.6% in girls and boys, respectively.
The lifetime risk of nephrolithiasis among women in-
creased 45% between 1997 (10.5%) and 2012 (15.2%) and
remained stable among men at approximately 23% (Table 8).
Sensitivity Analyses
Results including patients who may have had prevalent
stones were consistent with and did not alter the statistical
significance of our findings.
Discussion
This study examined temporal trends in the annual
incidence of nephrolithiasis among the general population
living in a large geographic area in the United States. The
annual incidence of nephrolithiasis increased 16% between
1997 and 2012, which far outpaces the increase in obesity
prevalence over a similar period (18,19). The greatest rates
of increase were observed among adolescents, females,
and blacks, which indicate that the historic distribution
of nephrolithiasis is changing. These changes in incidence
resulted in a doubling of the risk of nephrolithiasis during
childhood for boys and girls and a 45% increase in the
lifetime risk of nephrolithiasis for women over the study
period.

 Prior studies from the Rochester Epidemiology Project
evaluated temporal trends among 248 patients who de-
veloped incident stones in Olmstead County, Minnesota
between 1970 and 2000 (12,13). These prior studies ex-
panded our knowledge of the changing incidence of neph-
rolithiasis, but small sample sizes, a population that is 86%
white, and calculating incidence every 10 years limited
their generalizability and granularity. Our study, which
included 152,925 patients, adds to this prior work by eval-
uating the interaction between age, sex, and race on an-
nual incidence rates of kidney stones among a larger and
geographically distinct population.
Our results offer insight into the age groups that are
contributing to the narrowing sex and race gap of neph-
rolithiasis in the United States (5,6,12,13). Incidence in-
creased 23% per 5 years among boys ages 15–19 years
old but remained stable among men. Among females, in-
cidence increased in all age groups, with rates of 27%–28%
per 5 years among girls ages 10–19 years old and slightly
lower rates of 10%–19% per 5 years among older women.
In the Olmstead County study, decennial incidence rates
between 1970 and 2000 were highest among women ages
20–29 years old. The higher rates among adolescent girls
that we observed in our study, which contained an addi-
tional 12 years of data, suggest that the age of onset of
stone disease has continued to decrease over time. Now,
adolescent girls are the group in which the risk of neph-
rolithiasis is increasing at the fastest rate. Additionally, the
greatest increases in incidence among blacks were noted in
younger patients: for blacks ages 15–44 years old, the in-
cidence of nephrolithiasis increased 20%–37% per 5 years,
which was higher than the rates among whites of the same
age and sex.
The emergence of nephrolithiasis as a disease that begins
in childhood is worrisome because there is limited evi-
dence about how to best treat children with nephrolithiasis.
Consequently, there is unwanted variability in evaluation
and treatment practices for children with nephrolithiasis,
including poor adherence to guidelines aimed at reducing
radiation exposure among children with suspected neph-
rolithiasis and use of surgical interventions that are de-
pendent more on local availability and ease of use than
clinical indications (20–22). The rising incidence of neph-
rolithiasis among younger girls also has important public
health implications. Controlling for comorbidities, medica-
tions, body mass index, and diet, nephrolithiasis is associ-
ated with an increased risk of CKD, cardiovascular
disease, and fracture, with the greatest risks observed
among younger women (1–3). Although these associations
may not be causal, it is likely that the risks for and burden
of these diseases will be greater for patients who develop
nephrolithiasis earlier in life because of a longer lifetime
over which kidney, heart, and bone diseases may develop.
Our data show areas needing additional research. Prior
randomized trials of thiazides and citrate to reduce kidney
stone recurrence have been conducted among adult pop-
ulations of primarily white men (23,24). However, the ef-
ficacy of thiazides for hypertension is dependent on age
and race, and black women have a higher urine pH than
age–matched white women, raising questions about po-
tential differences in the efficacy of these medications for

 nephrolithiasis reverses during the transition from adoles-
cence to adulthood can inform research on modifiable risk
factors that are unique to particular populations. Possible
factors include poor water intake, because dehydration is
common and varies by age, sex, and race (27). Other eco-
logic trends in dietary habits that also vary by age, sex,
and race, such as increasing sodium and decreasing cal-
cium intake, are consistent with the increases in nephroli-
thiasis incidence that we observed and could contribute to
differences in incidence between patient groups (28–32).
However, our ability to examine for these differences is
limited because of the lack of longitudinal cohorts that
span childhood and adulthood. Expanding the National
Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES)
to include stone history for participants ,21 years old
will help identify modifiable risk factors that vary by
age, sex, and race. Additionally, prospective cohort studies
of patients who develop nephrolithiasis in childhood and
are followed into adult life are needed to determine recur-
rence rates and metabolic risk factors for early onset of
nephrolithiasis. This knowledge will facilitate targeted pri-
mary and secondary prevention strategies for the groups
in which nephrolithiasis is increasing at the highest rates.
South Carolina is the largest of a few states that capture
all surgery, inpatient admissions, and ED visits in an all–
payer claims database and the only state that began col-
lecting data in the 1990s. South Carolina Medical Encoun-
ter Data include unique patient identifiers and dated
encounters for care received at every hospital in the state
over a 16-year period. We were thus able to describe

 annual changes in the distribution and frequency of neph-
rolithiasis in the population, which are obscured in analyses
using the NHANES and Healthcare Cost and Utiliza-
tion Project databases and could not be examined in the
Rochester Epidemiology Project because of insufficient
sample sizes (5,6,33).
Nevertheless, our study has several limitations. First, our
observations are on the basis of data from one state. It is
possible that the absolute incidence of nephrolithiasis is
higher in South Carolina than the rest of the United States
because of the higher prevalence of nephrolithiasis in the
Southeast (34,35). However, the trends that we observed
are consistent with increases in nephrolithiasis frequency
reported in prior studies from other areas in the United
States (1,7,912,13,36). These results should not be general-
ized to other countries, such as Japan, where the incidence
of nephrolithiasis has increased over time but not among
younger patients (37).
Second, we cannot completely discount that changes in
imaging use contributed to changes in nephrolithiasis
incidence. However, detection bias is unlikely, because
computed tomography use stabilized among young adults
and decreased among children beginning in the 2000s
(38,39). Additionally, although climate change may affect
future nephrolithiasis prevalence (40) and hot and cold
temperatures are associated with increased risk of stone
presentation (35), any environmental changes over the
study period would not substantively affect nephrolithia-
sis incidence. It is also likely that factors other than in-
creasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes (41) account
for the increasing incidence of nephrolithiasis that we ob-
served, particularly because obesity may not be associated
with increased risk for kidney stones among children or
adolescents (42). It is more likely that dietary choices and
behaviors associated with stone risk differ between the
groups that we studied. However, our dataset did not con-
tain dietary or clinical information that could help ascer-
tain potential causes of the differential changes in
nephrolithiasis incidence.
Third, we may have underestimated incidence because
we did not capture asymptomatic nephrolithiasis or
nephrocalcinosis or less severe presentations of stones
that did not warrant admission, surgery, or an ED visit.
However, the consistency of the age- and sex-specific
incidences that we observed with the incidences reported
for adults in the Health Professionals Follow-Up and
Nurses Health Studies suggests that our outcome criteria
were valid (43).
Fourth, recurrent stones may have been misclassified as
incident stones. However, recurrent stones would be more
likely to occur in older white men, who had the highest
incidence of nephrolithiasis in any given year. The rising
frequency among younger patients, women, and blacks
argues against misclassification as an important source of
bias in our findings.
Fifth, our results cannot be generalized to Hispanic
patients, because we excluded Hispanics because of the
conflation of race and ethnicity in the dataset. However,
patients who self-identified as Hispanic represented ,2%
of the population who presented with nephrolithiasis. It is
unlikely that the results would change substantively if we
were able to classify by race and ethnicity.
In conclusion, the annual incidence of nephrolithiasis has
increased among young patients, particularly girls, and
also among blacks, showing a reversal of historical trends.
Understanding modifiable risk factors that account for
the age, sex, and race differences in incidence rates will
facilitate targeted secondary prevention strategies, partic-
ularly for those groups in which nephrolithiasis were once
rare but are now increasing.
