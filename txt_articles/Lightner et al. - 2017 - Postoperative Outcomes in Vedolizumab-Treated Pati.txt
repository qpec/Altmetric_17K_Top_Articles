Abstract
Introduction: Vedolizumab was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the 
treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn’s disease [CD]. No study to date 
has examined the rate of postoperative infectious complications among patients who received 
vedolizumab in the perioperative period. We sought to determine the 30-day postoperative 
infectious complication rate among inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients who received 
vedolizumab within 12 weeks of an abdominal operation as compared to patients who received 
tumour necrosis factor α [TNFα] inhibitors or no biological therapy.
Methods: A retrospective chart review between May 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015 of adult IBD 
patients who underwent an abdominal operation was performed. The study cohort comprised 
patients who received vedolizumab within 12 weeks of their abdominal operation and the control 
cohorts were patients who received 
TNFα inhibitors or no biological therapy.
Results: In total, 94 patients received vedolizumab within 12 weeks of an abdominal operation. 
Fifty experienced postoperative complications [53%], 35 of which were surgical site infections 
[SSIs] [36%]. The vedolizumab group experienced significantly higher rates of any postoperative 
infection [53% vs 33% anti-TNF and 28% non-biologics; p<0.001] and SSI [37% vs 10% and 13%; 
p<0.001]. On univariate and multivariate analysis, exposure to vedolizumab remained a significant 
predictor of postoperative SSI [p<0.001].
Conclusions: Thirty-seven per cent of IBD patients who received vedolizumab within 30 days of 
a major abdominal operation experienced a 30-day postoperative SSI, significantly higher than 
patients receiving 
TNFα inhibitors or no biological therapy. 
Vedolizumab within 12 weeks of surgery 
remained the only predictor of 30-day postoperative SSI on multivariate analysis.

1. Introduction
Since the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approval of inf-
liximab for Crohn’s disease [CD] in 1998, biological therapy has 
gradually become the preferred treatment for moderate to severe 
inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. Adalimumab and certolizumab 
pegol, also anti-tumour necrosis-alpha [TNFα] inhibitors, were 
approved for moderate to severe CD in 2007 and 2008, respectively. 
Infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab are now approved for 
moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [UC]. While there is no doubt 
that these are effective medications for treating IBD, the efficacy 
of anti-TNFα therapy has been limited by primary non-response, 
secondary loss of response and treatment intolerance. Investigators

 have worked to fill this therapeutic gap, exploring therapies with 
different mechanisms of action. Vedolizumab [Entyvio™, Takeda 
Pharmaceuticals America], a humanized monoclonal antibody to 
the α4β7 integrin (whose ligand is mucosal addressin cell adhesion 
molecule-1 [MAdCAM-1], localized to the endothelial cells within 
the gastrointestinal tract), was approved by the FDA for moderate to 
severe UC and CD in May 2014.
There was great enthusiasm for vedolizumab’s approval because 
of its gut selectivity and theoretically more favourable safety pro-
file. The pivotal placebo-controlled trials of vedolizumab demon-
strated significantly improved remission rates and CD Activity Index 
scores among patients with moderate to severe CD, and significantly 
improved clinical remission rates and Mayo scores and quality of life 
among patients with moderate to severe UC.1,2 A recent integrated 
safety analysis of vedolizumab underlined its favourable safety pro-
file.3 While neither trial found a significantly increased infectious 
complication rate, the studies did not specifically examine surgical 
outcomes, and in fact excluded patients with stomas and intestinal 
strictures.
There are no published data regarding vedolizumab’s effect on 
postoperative outcomes, an important consideration in the inter-
disciplinary management of IBD, especially for operative timing, 
operative approach and need for diversion in the setting of a new 
anastomosis. The mechanism of vedolizumab’s action, blocking leu-
kocyte migration to the intestine, is a particular concern for surgeons, 
as healing of intestinal anastomoses or the mucocutaneous interface 
of a stoma is dependent upon the presence of leukocytes as a major 
component and coordinator of wound healing.4–7 Failure of appro-
priate intestinal healing in the postoperative period may contribute 
to the development of major complications, including anastomotic 
leaks or development of organ space surgical site infections [SSIs]. 
Deep space infections may be considered as a surrogate of ineffec-
tive wound healing. The risk of SSIs is an important consideration 
with any new immunosuppressant used perioperatively, as SSIs sig-
nificantly increase patient morbidity and length of hospital stay.8,9 As 
the use of vedolizumab increases in the IBD patient population, its 
possible impact on postoperative recovery is critical to understand. 
Therefore, we sought to determine the rate of postoperative infec-
tious complications among IBD patients who received vedolizumab 
within 12 weeks of a major abdominal operation as compared to 
patients exposed to either TNFα inhibitors or no biological therapy 
within 12 weeks of a major abdominal operation.
2. Materials and Methods
Following institutional review board approval, a retrospective chart 
review of the Mayo Clinic Rochester electronic medical record sys-
tem between May 20, 2014 and December 31, 2015 was performed. 
A list of all UC and CD patients who underwent a major abdomi-
nal operation was obtained. Study patients included adults [aged 
18–70 years] with UC or CD who received vedolizumab within 
12 weeks of a major abdominal operation. Two separate control 
cohorts included those patients exposed to TNFα inhibitors within 
12 weeks of a major abdominal operation and patients not exposed 
to any biological therapy within 12 weeks of a major abdominal 
operation. Patients were excluded if they did not have 30 days of fol-
low-up after their operation or if their operation was performed at 
an outside hospital. Data abstracted included patient demographics, 
IBD subtype, smoking history, duration of vedolizumab administra-
tion, date and type of surgery, concomitant immunosuppressive med-
ications, and postoperative infectious complications and mortality. 
The primary endpoint was postoperative infectious complications, 
including SSIs, anastomotic leak, catheter-associated infection, uri-
nary tract infection and respiratory tract infection, occurring within 
the first 30 post-operative days.
2.1 Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± SD or as median 
[range]. Differences in the means between subgroups were compared 
using the t test. Comparisons between categorical variables were 
analysed using the Fisher’s exact test. A p value of <0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant. Univariate and multivariable logistic 
regression was used to determine predictors of SSIs among all IBD 
patients as well as within the vedolizumab study cohort.
3. Results
A total of 392 patients were included in the analysis: 94 patients 
received vedolizumab, 126 received TNFα inhibitors and 172 
received no biological therapy within 12 weeks of an abdominal 
operation between May 20, 2014 and December 31, 2015 at Mayo 
Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Within the vedolizumab group, 67 
patients were female and 27 were male, the median age was 33 years 
[range, 18–74 years] and the median body mass index [BMI] was 
22 kg/m2 [range, 14–41 kg/m2]. Twenty-two patients had a diagno-
sis of UC [24%], 71 [76%] had CD and one had a diagnosis of 
indeterminate colitis [IC]. Four patients [4%] were active smokers 
and 11 patients [12%] were former smokers. Thirty-seven [39%] 
and 37 patients [39%] were receiving corticosteroid therapy and 
immunomodulator therapy, respectively, at the time of abdomi-
nal operation, compared to 33 [27%] and 41 [40%] in the TNF 
inhibitor biologics group and 53 [43%] and 23 [23%] in the non-
biologics group, respectively [p=0.11 and p<0.001, respectively]. Of 
the 57 patients receiving steroids, 55 were taking oral prednisone 
[2.5–60 mg daily], and two were receiving intravenous methylpred-
nisolone [40 mg daily]. Within 30 days of surgery, the median serum 
albumin was 3.7 g/dl [range, 2.6–4.7 
g/dl], leukocyte count was 
10.9 g/dl [3.5–31.1 g/dl], haemoglobin was 11.1 g/dl [6.1–15.2 g/
dl], platelet count was 347 × 109/l [137–805 × 109/l] and C reactive 
protein [CRP] drawn in only 13% of patients within a month was 
59.7 mg/dl [6.4–282.5 mg/dl] [Table 1].
The most common operations performed among the non-biologics 
group, TNFα inhibitors group and vedolizumab group were small 
bowel resection [39%], ileocolic resection [44%] and colectomy 
[28%], respectively. A total of 207 patients [53%] had an anastomosis 
performed at the time of surgery. Thirty-five of 94 patients in the vedoli-
zumab cohort [37%], 76 of 126 patients in the biologics cohort [63%] 
and 93 of 172 patients from the non-biologics cohort [54%] had an 
anastomosis constructed at the time of surgery [p<0.01]. Twenty-seven 
patients [13%] had their anastomosis diverted, including four of 35 in 
the vedolizumab cohort [11%], four of 79 in the biologics cohort [5%] 
and 19 of 93 from the non-biologics cohort [20%] [p=0.01] [Table 2].
Post-operatively, within the vedolizumab group, 50 of 94 patients 
who underwent an abdominal operation experienced a postopera-
tive complication within 30 days of surgery [53.2%], 35 of which 
were SSIs [37.2%]. Of the patients with SSIs, 20 patients [21%] had 
a superficial SSI treated with opening the wound and/or antibiotics, 
13 [14%] had a deep space SSI treated with percutaneous drain-
age and antibiotics, and two [2%] experienced an anastomotic leak. 
Seven patients [7.4%] had separation of the mucocutaneous border 
of the stoma with abscess formation, two of whom required intra-
operative stoma revision. Eight patients [8.5%] required a return

 to the operating room [ROR]. RORs were performed for stoma 
repair/revision [n=2], anastomotic leak [n=2], stoma abscess wash-
out [n=1], non-healing perineal wound debridement [n=1], small 
bowel obstruction [n=1] and a washout for unidentified perforation 
[n=1]. There was no 30-day mortality. The vedolizumab group had 
a significantly increased rate of any postoperative complications 
[p<0.001], all SSIs [p<0.001], superficial SSIs [p<0.001], deep space 
SSIs [p<0.001] and mucocutaneous separation [p<0.001] [Table 3].
Within the vedolizumab study group, there were no significant 
differences in age, gender, BMI, smoking status, steroid use, immu-
nomodulator therapy, median duration of vedolizumab therapy, 
serum albumin, haemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet counts or 
CRP levels between those who experienced a postoperative infec-
tious complication and those who did not. Vedolizumab patients 
who had diabetes mellitus were significantly more likely to have a 
postoperative SSI [p=0.03] [Table 4].
On univariate analysis, both perioperative use of vedolizumab 
[p<0.0001] and corticosteroids [p=0.045] were found to be signifi-
cantly associated with SSIs among IBD patients, regardless of the 
control group [TNFα or no biologics] [Table 5]. Upon multivariate 
analysis, perioperative use of vedolizumab remained significantly 
associated with the development of SSIs whether the control group 
was the no biologics cohort or the TNFα group [Table 6]. Interestingly, 
in multivariate analysis, perioperative TNFα inhibitor was not associ-
ated with the development of SSIs as compared to no biologics expo-
sure and nor was the type of operation performed [Table 6].
4. Discussion
Vedolizumab, a biological agent that selectively inhibits leukocyte 
migration into the intestinal tract, has been shown to be an effective 
medical therapy for IBD. However, some have speculated that this 
mechanism of action may affect postoperative healing. In this sin-
gle-centre retrospective cohort, we found that 53% of IBD patients 
who received vedolizumab within 12 weeks of a major abdominal 
operation had a postoperative complication, and 37% had a post-
operative SSI, significantly higher [p<0.001] than the rate in patients 
exposed to TNFα inhibitors or no biological therapy. On multivari-
able regression analysis, patients who received vedolizumab were 
found to be four times as likely to experience an SSI as compared to 
the TNFα inhibitors or no biological therapy cohorts.
Most of the literature regarding infectious and anastomotic com-
plications associated with perioperative biological therapy has focused 
on the use of infliximab within 12 weeks prior to surgery. While the 
literature remains controversial as to whether infliximab increases 
the risk of postoperative complications, a recent set of meta-analyses

 concluded infliximab does increase the rate of postoperative compli-
cations, especially postoperative infectious complications, which are 
reported to occur at a rate of 15–17%.10–12 To date, there is no study 
published regarding the postoperative infectious complications in the 
setting of preoperative vedolizumab administration. In our study, we 
demonstrated that the rate of all postoperative complications, super-
ficial SSIs, deep space SSIs and mucocutaneous separation were all 
significantly increased as compared to the TNFα inhibitor or no bio-
logical therapy control cohorts, and on multivariate analysis the expo-
sure to vedolizumab remained a significant predictor for SSIs. These 
results underline the risk of postoperative infectious complications in 
the setting of preoperative vedolizumab exposure.
There are several limitations to this study. First, this is a single-
centre retrospective review performed at a large referral centre. These 
patients were referred on a variety of medical regimens, or with 
severe uncontrolled disease, implying this cohort may be a sicker 
cohort than patients treated elsewhere. In fact, many of the patients 
initially treated with vedolizumab were patients with medically 
refractory disease awaiting its FDA approval. Moreover, more than 
half of our patient cohort was on concomitant corticosteroid and/or 
immunomodulator therapy at the time of their abdominal operation. 
Secondly, because vedolizumab was only recently approved by the 
FDA in 2014, our study includes just 20 months of data, thereby lim-
iting the number of patients included in our analysis. Third, only 12 
patients in our series had a primary anastomosis without proximal 
diversion. Thus, we cannot adequately address the important ques-
tion of anastomotic leak rate in the setting of perioperative adminis-
tration of vedolizumab.
To better understand the role of vedolizumab on SSIs and 
anastomotic leak rate, it will be important to study postoperative 
complications in a prospective manner. This could be more readily 
accomplished by performing a multi-institution case control study. 
Additionally, it will be important to investigate if vedolizumab is 
associated with increased anastomotic leak rates, especially given its 
mechanism of blocking leukocyte migration to the intestine, a step 
critical for anastomotic healing.

 In conclusion, vedolizumab is an effective treatment for moderate 
to severe CD and UC, offering an attractive alternative to anti-TNFα 
therapy. As its use increases, it is expected that more patients referred 
to surgery will be receiving vedolizumab therapy. We found a 37% 
30-day SSI rate and 53% postoperative complication rate in patients 
receiving vedolizumab in the perioperative period, a rate significantly 
higher than that seen in patients treated with TNFα inhibitors. Given 
the single-centre nature of this study, larger prospective studies would 
be useful to further define the impact of vedolizumab on postoperative 
SSIs and anastomotic leak rates. In the meantime, an active dialogue 
between treating gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons is criti-
cal to optimize patient care and determine optimal operative timing, 
operative approach and need for diversion to protect anastomoses.
