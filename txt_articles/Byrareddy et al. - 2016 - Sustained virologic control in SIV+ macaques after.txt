Antiretroviral drug therapy (ART) effectively suppresses replication of both the
immunodeficiency viruses, human (HIV) and simian (SIV); however, virus rebounds soon
after ART is withdrawn. SIV-infected monkeys were treated with a 90-day course of ART
initiated at 5 weeks post infection followed at 9 weeks post infection by infusions of a
primatized monoclonal antibody against the a4b7 integrin administered every 3 weeks until
week 32. These animals subsequently maintained low to undetectable viral loads and
normal CD4+ T cell counts in plasma and gastrointestinal tissues for more than 9 months,
even after all treatment was withdrawn. This combination therapy allows macaques to
effectively control viremia and reconstitute their immune systems without a need for
further therapy.
P
rofound and durable suppression of HIV
by antiretroviral therapy (ART) represents
a major accomplishment in HIV-AIDS re-
search. However, HIV persists in patients
despite long-term ART therapy such that,
once ART is withdrawn, virus invariably re-
bounds. Lifetime ART treatment is associated
with toxicity (1), residual chronic inflammation,
and the accelerated onset of diseases associated
with aging (2, 3).
High levels of viral replication in gastro-
intestinal tissues (GITs) during acute infec-
tion lead to severe depletion of local CD4+ T cells
(4), damage to the gut epithelium, and the rapid
formation of persistent viral reservoirs. Gener-
alized immune dysfunction and chronic immune
activation follow. Even when administered days
after infection, ART fails to fully reverse these
insults (5). We reasoned that preventing HIV-
susceptible cells from accessing GITs might
reduce damage to the gut and the mucosal im-
mune system in a way that would allow immune
mechanisms to effectively control infection.
A principal pathway that CD4+ T cells use
to traffic into GITs involves an interaction be-
tween integrin a4b7, expressed on CD4+ T cells,
with mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion
molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), expressed primarily on
high endothelial venules within GITs (6, 7). CD4+
T cells that express high levels of the a4b7 integrin
(a4b7
hi) are preferential targets of HIV and simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) during acute infec-
tion (8–12). In order to disrupt trafficking of
a4b7
hi CD4+ T cells into GITs, we developed a
recombinant rhesus monoclonal antibody against
the heterodimeric form of a4b7 (a4b7 mAb) that
blocks a4b7 binding to MAdCAM (13–15).
Administration of a4b7 mAb before and during
repeated low-dose intravaginal SIV challenge of
rhesus macaques (RMs) leads to significant pro-
tection from transmission (13). In treated animals
that became infected, GIT CD4+ T cells were
preserved and GIT proviral DNA was reduced,
and thus, virus-mediated damage to GITs was
minimized.
Because ART provides only partial protection
to GITs (5, 14), we considered the possibility that
adding a4b7 mAb might improve this protection.
To this end, we conducted a study in genetically
characterized (table S1, A to D) SIV-infected RMs
that combined a 90-day course of ART, begin-
ning 5 weeks post-infection with a series of eight
infusions of a4b7 mAb. This treatment strategy
included five phases as outlined in fig. S1. In
phase 1 (weeks 1 to 5), 18 RMs were infected
intravenously with a 200 median tissue culture
infectious dose (TCID50) of SIVmac239. After
5 weeks, all 18 animals began a 90-day daily
regimen of ART (phase II). During phase III
(weeks 9 to 18), 11 animals received a4b7 mAb
once every 3 weeks (eight infusions total); 7
animals received nonspecific rhesus immuno-
globulin G (IgG). During phase IV (weeks 18 to
32), ART was withdrawn, and a4b7 mAb–IgG
treatment was continued. In phase V (weeks 32
to 50), all treatment was terminated. Three out
of 11 a4b7 mAb–treated animals developed anti-
bodies against the a4b7 mAb (fig. S2) and were
excluded from further analysis.
ART + a4b7 mAb controls plasma and
gut viral loads
All 15 animals showed similar peaks in viremia
around weeks 2 to 3 (~2.9 × 106 copies/ml), and
they all fully suppressed viremia by 3 weeks after
ART initiation. The two groups developed diver-
gent viral load (VL) patterns after ART was with-
drawn (phase IV). In all seven IgG-treated animals,
viremia rebounded to high levels (~106 copies/ml)
within 2 weeks and maintained those levels out to
week 50 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, two out of eight a4b7
mAb–treated animals never rebounded, and the
remaining six out of eight rebounded but then
regained control of viremia within 4 weeks (Fig.
1A). Virologic control was robust in all eight a4b7
mAb–treated animals, with either complete con-
trol or transient low-level blips of viremia. The
difference in viremia between the two groups
after discontinuation of ART was significant
(P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1C). Virologic control in all
eight a4b7 mAb–treated animals persisted to week
81 (fig. S3), although the last infusion of a4b7 mAb
(half-life of ~11.4 days) was administered at week
32 (13).
Both treatment groups showed similar levels
of proviral DNA in GITs during phases I and II.
Immediately after cessation of ART, all monkeys
showed increases in proviral DNA. High levels
(20 to 40 copies/ng DNA) persisted in the seven
IgG-treated animals until week 50 (Fig. 1E). In
contrast, in all eight a4b7 mAb–treated macaques,
proviral DNA decreased to levels at or below the
level of detection by week 30 (Fig. 1D). The dif-
ference in the geometric means of the two groups
(Fig. 1F) during phases IV and V was significant
(P < 0.0001). Undetectable proviral DNA loads in
all eight a4b7 mAb–treated macaques persisted
well after the final infusion of a4b7 mAb (week 32).
Thus, combining a4b7 mAb therapy with short-
term ART promoted persistent systemic and

Rebound of CD4+ T cell subsets
Blood and GIT mononuclear cells isolated from
each phase of the study were analyzed by flow
cytometry (table S2, A to C). During phase I, the
absolute numbers of blood total CD4+ T cells and
subsets showed a sharp decline (Fig. 2, A to D).
After the first administration of a4b7 mAb (phase
III), CD4 values diverged. The a4b7 mAb–treated
animals, but not controls, showed marked in-
creases in total CD4+ T cells and, notably, in the
effector memory (EM) CD4+ T cell subset (>four-
fold increase, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2D). These increases
were sustained after discontinuation of the a4b7
mAb treatment (phase V). By week 50, total CD4+
T cell numbers approached preinfection levels.
Acute HIV-1 and SIV infections are charac-
terized by a rapid depletion of CD4+ T cells in GITs
(4, 15–18). Therefore, we evaluated the fate of GIT
CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2, E to H), with values expressed
as the percent of CD4+ T cells within the gated
population of CD45+ cells. We observed a sharp
decline in total CD4+ T cells during the acute
phase in both groups with CD45+/CD4+ T cells
reaching their nadir by the end of phase I (Fig.
2E). In phase III, the CD4+ T cell profile of the two
treatment groups diverged. The relative frequency
of CD45+/CD4+ cells in the a4b7 mAb–treated
animals gradually increased through phase V
(P < 0.0001). CD4+ T cell subsets showed an ap-
parent recovery of both T central memory (CM)

 and T EM cells in the a4b7 mAb–treated animals,
with the EM recovering at a faster rate (Fig. 2, G
and H). The relative proportion of naïve CD4+ T
cells remained constant through phase V (Fig.
2F). The quality of this recovery was well reflected
by increases in the frequencies of T helper 17
(TH17) and T helper 22 (TH22) subsets of CD4+
T cells in both GITs and blood (fig. S4) (19). Con-
sistent with these results, immunohistological
analysis of GIT sections after week 50 revealed
abundant CD4+ T cells in a4b7 mAb–treated ani-
mals but not in controls (fig. S5).
To better understand the repopulation of gut
tissues with CD4+ T cells, we used a newly devel-
oped antibody-targeted positron emission tomog-
raphy (immuno-PET) combined with the computed
tomography (CT) imaging technique (20). Around
week 50 (phase V), four macaques from each
treatment group were imaged with a 64Cu-labeled
F(ab′)2 antibody against CD4. Although we had
originally hypothesized that a4b7 mAb would in-
hibit CD4+ T cell trafficking to GITs, we instead
observed repopulation of CD4+ cells in a wide var-
iety of immune tissues, including GITs (Fig. 3). This
result suggests that the protective effect of a4b7
mAbinminimizingGIT viralloadearly ininfection
(Fig. 1, D to F) facilitated the repopulation of CD4+
cells throughoutthe systemic and mucosal immune
systems. It is unclear whether the reconstitution of
these immune sites resulted from the control of vi-
remia, whether these immune competent compo-
nents contributed to virologic control, or both.
Phenotypic analysis of NK cells and
other cell lineages
Total natural killer (NK) cells in blood remained
similar in both groups during phases I to IV (Fig.
4) and decreased during phase V but only in the
IgG-treated group (Fig. 4A). We observed a de-
crease in the cytolytic subset (NKG2a+/CD8+/
CD16+/CD56–) during phase III and IV in the
a4b7 mAb–treated group, followed by an increase
during phase V (Fig. 4B). Cytokine-synthesizing
NK cells (NKG2A+/CD8+/CD16–/CD56+) increased
during phase IV in a4b7 mAb–treated animals

 (Fig. 4C). By week 50, these values approached
baseline. A related pattern was observed in GITs.
In the a4b7 mAb–treated group, the proportion of
the cytokine-synthesizing NK cell subset increased
through phases IV and V (Fig. 4H), with corre-
sponding decreases in the proportion of other
NK cell subsets. These changes are noteworthy
in two ways. First, among all NK cell subsets
analyzed, a4b7 expression is highest (~40%) on
cytokine-synthesizing NK cells. Second, these in-
creases coincided with the appearance of viro-
logic control in phase IV. Frequencies of NKp44+
innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) decreased in both
treatment groups as early as phase I (fig. S6),
which is consistent with the loss of ILCs in acute
HIV infection (21). However, we observed a sus-
tained increase in the frequency of ILCs in gut
biopsies in ART + a4b7 mAb–treated animals
beginning in phase III but not in controls. Note
that vaccine-induced ILCs have been correlated
with protection from SIV infection (22). Other
cell lineages (CD8+ T cells, B cells, and plasma-
cytoid and myeloid dendritic cells) were analyzed
(figs. S7 and S8), as were activation markers on
CD4+,CD8+ T and NK cells (figs. S9 to S11). Al-
though differences were noted, further studies
will be required to inform the impact of those
differences.
Identification of signature
plasma cytokines
Results presented above suggest that virologic
control was immune mediated. To this end, we
analyzed a panel of 20 immune or inflammatory
markers (table S3) in plasma samples. To iden-
tify signatures for each of the five phases of the
study, we used a partial least square discriminant
analysis (PLSDA). PLSDA models were created
for the five study phases by using measurements
from each sample and time point, and variable
importance projection scores were used to omit
markers that did not contribute to group differ-
entiation. Cross-validation was used to assess
model performance. In phases I and II, we found
no distinction between treatment groups, with
a high cross-validation error between models
(0.28 and 0.21, respectively) (fig. S12, A and B). In
phases III to V, distinct signatures differenti-
ated the two treatment groups, with low cross-
validation errors in each phase (0.09, 0.02, and
0, respectively) (Fig. 5A). The differentiating sig-
nature varied in each of these phases. One
common feature of all three was a comparative
increase in retinoic acid (RA) in the a4b7 mAb–
treatment group (Fig. 5B). The signature in phase
III, when both groups were aviremic, included
increases in interleukin-21 (IL-21), granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor, soluble
CD14 (sCD14), interferon-a (IFN-a), as well as
RA; however, IFN-g and transforming growth
factor–b (TGF-b) were reduced. In phases IV and
V, a4b7 mAb treatment was associated with in-
creased IL-10 and RA, with comparative decreases
of proinflammatory markers, including IL-1b,
IFN-g–induced protein (IP-10), complement-
reactive protein (CRP), the coagulation biomarker
D-dimer, and two markers, sCD163 and intestinal
fatty acid–binding protein (I-FABP), associated
with gut permeability (Fig. 5A and fig. S13).
ART + a4b7 mAb restores plasma
retinoic acid levels
RA induces the expression of a4b7 (23, 24) and
also plays an essential role in gut homeostasis
(23, 25–27). Baseline RA levels decreased during
acute infection in both groups (Fig. 5B). A sim-
ilar response was observed in two uninfected
monkeys afflicted with chronic diarrhea (fig.
S14), suggesting that such declines are linked to
gut inflammation. Of note, measurements taken
on weeks 15, 17, and 19 (phase III) differentiated

 the two groups, such that RA in the a4b7 treat-
ment group recovered to near-baseline levels. To
understand whether these changes reflected the
administration of a4b7 mAb, independent of SIV
infection, we treated two uninfected animals
with a4b7 mAb and observed no effect on serum
RA (fig. S15). Indeed, we also observed a sim-
ilar response in I-FABP levels in phase III (fig.
S13). Finally, we carried out an exploratory
analysis to identify additional biomarkers in
phase III that might correlate with the degree
of gut proviral DNA rebound in phase IV. Both
positive and negative predictors of the magni-
tude of viral rebound in gut tissues were iden-
tified (fig. S16).
Induction of gp120 V2–specific
antibody responses
Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell
(PBMC) samples were also screened for SIV-specific
antibody responses and antibody-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). We found neither
neutralizing antibodies nor differences in ADCC
titers (fig. S17). In human and macaque vaccine
trials, nonneutralizing antibodies directed against
the second variable loop (V2) in Env glycoprotein
120 (gp120) correlated with reduced risk of ac-
quisition (28, 29). We therefore characterized
the specificity of the antibody responses by per-
forming Pepscan enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) of sera from five animals in each
group against linear peptides spanning the en-
tire gp120 subunit (fig. S18). Serum samples from
weeks 30 to 36 showed that five out of five a4b7
mAb–treated macaques reacted, to varying lev-
els, with two overlapping V2 peptides (peptides
26 and 27). None of the IgG-treated controls
reacted to both of these peptides (two animals
reacted to one peptide). We found no other con-
sistent difference in epitope-specific reactivity
between the two groups. We then evaluated
antibody responses using a more sensitive sur-
face plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. Sera from
all 15 animals through the five treatment phases
were reacted with both SIV gp120 and an SIV
cyclic V2 peptide. Sera from both treatment

 groups showed similar reactivity to gp120 (mean
values) (fig. S19). However, the two treatment
groups differed in their reactivity to V2. Whereas
eight out of eight a4b7 mAb–treated animals
showed persistent reactivity to V2, only three
out of seven IgG-treated animals reacted to V2
(Fig. 6A). We then fine-mapped this reactivity
by competing serum reactivity from all eight
animals with overlapping 15mer peptides span-
ning V2 (Fig. 6B). A peptide corresponding to
the sequence KFNMTGLKRDKKKEY (see Fig.
6 legend) reduced serum reactivity by ~80%.
Alignment of this sequence with an HIV Thai
clade A/E V2 sequence indicates that it recognizes
the same region identified in a sieving analysis
for immune correlates of reduced risk in the
RV144 vaccine trial (Fig. 6C) (30). These data
indicate that a4b7 mAb treatment promotes V2
antibody responses by an undefined mechanism.
Discussion
Combining ART with a4b7 mAb promoted pro-
longed virologic control (Fig. 1 and fig. S3) and
the restoration of CD4+ T cells. Control persisted
long after a4b7 mAb treatment was terminated.
It was not associated with neutralizing antibody
or classical cell-mediated immune responses (figs.
S20 to S24) but instead with reduced damage to
GITs. The precise mechanism(s) by which ART +
a4b7 mAb therapy promoted virologic control
remains to be defined. However, we identified
a series of correlates that individually or in com-
bination may have contributed to that control.
These include the recovery of TH17 and TH22
subsets of CD4+ T cells, significant increases
in cytokine-synthesizing NK cells and NKp44+
ILCs, skewing of the antibody response toward
the gp120 V2 domain, distinguishing plasma
biomarkers in phase III followed by signatures
associated with reduced gut damage and inflam-
mation in phases IV and V, and the recovery of
RA levels. RA is a key regulator of gut immune
responses (31, 32) but it also inhibits fibrosis (33).
Vedolizumab, the humanized analog of a4b7
mAb is believed to reduce trafficking of a4b7-
expressing CD4+ T cells to GITs. This is the basis
for its use in the treatment of inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) (34). Yet, paradoxically, in
this study a4b7 mAb promoted the repopula-
tion of GITs with CD4+ T cells. Future studies
are needed to address the phenotype and func-
tionality of these cells. Such information may
help us better understand both the virologic
control we are observing and the mechanism of
action of drugs like vedolizumab. Vedolizumab
belongs to a class of therapeutic agents that are
currently in various stages of development for
the treatment of IBD (34, 35). It may be possible
to use these drugs as adjunctive agents in the
treatment of HIV infection.

Fig. 6. Characterization of the anti-SIV gp120 V2 antibody response. (A) Reactivity (response
units, RU) of sera from individual animals in the groups treated with ART + IgG (top left) and ART +
a4b7 mAb (top right) against a cyclic V2 peptide (cV2). The dashed line represents the cut-off value
for positive reactivity. (B) Serum reactivity (percent response, means ± SD) against cV2 of four ART +
a4b7 mAb–treated animals in the presence of overlapping V2 peptides (41 to 45), or in the absence of
any competing peptide (black bar), defined as 100% response. Asterisk (*) represents the level of sig-
nificance (*P < 0.05; ***P < 0.001, paired t test for each condition, compared with the no-peptide
control). (C) Alignment of the SIV V2 overlapping peptides 41 to 45 with the V2 region of SIVmac239 and
the corresponding region of HIV A244 gp120. Single-letter abbreviations for the amino acid residues are
as follows: A, Ala; C, Cys; D, Asp; E, Glu; F, Phe; G, Gly; H, His; I, Ile; K, Lys; L, Leu; M, Met; N, Asn; P
, Pro;
Q, Gln; R, Arg; S, Ser; T, Thr; V, Val; W, T
