Abstract
Twin studies that focus on the correlation in age-at-death between twin pairs have yielded
important insights into the heritability and role of genetic factors in determining lifespan, but
less attention is paid to the biological and social role of zygosity itself in determining survival
across the entire life course. Using data from the Danish Twin Registry and the Human Mor-
tality Database, we show that monozygotic twins have greater cumulative survival propor-
tions at nearly every age compared to dizygotic twins and the Danish general population.
We examine this survival advantage by fitting these data with a two-process mortality model
that partitions survivorship patterns into extrinsic and intrinsic mortality processes roughly
corresponding to acute, environmental and chronic, biological origins. We find intrinsic pro-
cesses confer a survival advantage at older ages for males, while at younger ages, all
monozygotic twins show a health protection effect against extrinsic death akin to a marriage
protection effect. While existing research suggests an increasingly important role for genetic
factors at very advanced ages, we conclude that the social closeness of monozygotic twins
is a plausible driver of the survival advantage at ages <65.
Introduction
Due to the social and economic consequences of variation in human lifespan there is consider-
able interest in identifying the extent of social, environmental, and biological determinants of
survival patterns in humans. While studies of extreme longevity clustered within human fami-
lies have indicated at least some genetic role in determining lifespan at very advanced ages [1–
4], twin studies, which offer the opportunity to disentangle the genetic and environmental fac-
tors for a given trait, indicate genetic factors are responsible for only a modest amount of the
variation (20–30%) in human lifespan [5–7] and that the role of genetic factors is minimal
before age 60, but increases thereafter [4, 8]. Although twin studies that focus on the correla-
tion in age-at-death have yielded important insights into the role of genetics in human lifespan,
the determinants of human survival patterns are immensely complex and change with age—i.e.
while genetic factors play an increasingly larger role at advanced ages, environmental, social,

 and behavioral factors influence survival patterns much more heavily at younger ages. Perhaps
owing to this complexity and the traditional structure of twin survival studies, less is known
about differences in survival across age by zygosity, the underlying mortality processes that
produce these differences, or the role of zygosity itself in shaping age patterns of survival.
Fig 1 shows the difference in the cumulative survival proportion by age (lx column of the life
table) between all monozygotic (MZ) and like-sex dizygotic (DZ) twins born in Denmark from
1870–1900 and the 1870–1900 Danish general population cohort. MZ twins of both sexes have
a survival advantage at nearly every age over their DZ counterparts and both zygositites enjoy a
survival advantage over the general population cohort from the same time period. Our focus is
the origins of these twin advantages in survival across age.
We aim to quantify the extrinsic and intrinsic contributions to survival across age and by
zygosity by fitting a two-process vitality model to survival data for the twin and general popula-
tion cohorts shown in Fig 1. In the vitality framework, mortality is partitioned into either an
intrinsic process where death is the result of the cumulative and incremental degradation of
survival capacity with age or an extrinsic process in which death results from an acute environ-
mental challenge. While the extrinsic process is unlikely to be closely associated with genetic
endowment, the incremental decline in survival capacity—i.e. vitality—mimics the process of
senescence and is therefore postulated to be influenced by life-long cumulative health behav-
iors and, to a certain extent, genetic inheritance. Note that these two processes primarily influ-
ence mortality at different ages—extrinsic in adulthood and intrinsic in old age—and that the
distinction of the two processes ultimately relies on the time scale to death (extrinsic is short-
term and acute; intrinsic is long-term and chronic) rather than on cause of death per se. That
said we do not wish to convey that we are directly quantifying the environmental and genetic
contributions to longevity as is done in conventional genomic studies using twin data. While
this quantification is indeed an important task, it has been explored in numerous other pub-
lished works [4–6, 9–11] and our model framework is not designed to directly make this dis-
tinction. However, the vitality model’s decomposition of the overall survival function into
plausible underlying mortality processes that shape the survivorship patterns among twins
and the general population can reveal important insights into the factors that drive survival
across the life course in general. Furthermore, these partitions should link to a number of direct
causes that have implications for programs aimed at improving quality of life and meeting the
demands of ever increasing human lifespans.
Materials and Methods
Data
The Danish Twin Registry (DTR), a national register administered in accordance with the Pro-
cessing of Personal Data Act (Denmark), provided data for this study. The DTR Scientific
Board approved this project and the dataset provided by the DTR for analysis in this study is
anonymized.
The twins dataset consists of all monozygotic and like-sex dizygotic twin pairs born in Den-
mark from 1870–1900 [12, 13]. To identify all twin births, birth registrars from all parishes
within Denmark were manually reviewed and zygosity was established through a questionnaire
sent to the surviving twin(s) or closest surviving relative. It was not possible to follow up with
twins who died or emigrated at a young age, so pairs where one twin died or emigrated before
age six are excluded by the DTR. Because there is no childhood mortality in this dataset and
due to the modeling framework described in the next section, we further truncate the data to
twin pairs where both survived to age 10. Table 1 shows the total number of individuals by
zygosity and age of survival for both sexes. This dataset consists of 2,958 like-sex twin pairs

 total and 2,932 like-sex twin pairs where both survived to age 10. All twins born in the 1870–
1900 cohort are now deceased and thus their length of life is known. The validity of twin zygos-
ity classification by this manner has shown to be of high accuracy [8, 14, 15] and studies sug-
gest twin survival is a good model for studying longevity [16].
Survival data for the 1870–1900 Danish general population cohorts consisting of all births
from 1870–1900 in Denmark were obtained from the Human Mortality Database [17] and are
also truncated at age 10 for model fitting.
Two-Process Mortality Model
We fit the twin and general population data with a four-parameter version of a two-process
vitality model [18] that has been used to describe varying demographic phenomenon including
the historical pattern of Swedish mortality [18], late-middle life/early-old age mortality accelera-
tions [19], and the breakdown of the log-linear relationship of Gompertz mortality parameters
in the 20th century [20]. Fig 2a shows how the two mortality processes work over age. The blue
lines depict the intrinsic process where an individual’s death occurs with the passage of ‘vitality,’
an abstract measure of survival capacity, by a hidden Markov process to an absorbing boundary
representing death [18, 21–23]. Because the intrinsic process is a rudimentary representation of
the individual physiological processes leading to senescence, it has been described as a “process
point-of-view” approach [24]. The red plotting symbols in Fig 2a depict the extrinsic process,
which is equivalent to the Strehler and Mildvan [25] interpretation of Gompertz-type models
[26–29]. Acute environmental challenges that instantaneously exhaust remaining vitality result
in extrinsic death and are represented by the filled red circles in Fig 2a. The vitality framework
merges Gompertz-type force of mortality models with the “process point-of-view” approach

 and shifts the focus from explaining how the “force of mortality” (i.e. the mortality rate) changes
with age to how the underlying mortality processes change with age.
Estimating Model Parameters
The model is fit to the cumulative age pattern of survival for a population (excluding childhood
mortality), which is governed by a total of four parameters: r, the mean rate of vitality loss and
s, the variability in the rate of vitality loss, control intrinsic mortality, while λ, the frequency of
extrinsic challenges, and β, the mean magnitude of extrinsic challenges (exponentially distrib-
uted), control extrinsic mortality. Panel b of Fig 2 depicts the vitality model in terms of the
age-specific cumulative survival curves produced by the intrinsic and extrinsic processes. The
mathematical development of the two mortality processes is described elsewhere [18, 21–23].
Here we show the equations defining the intrinsic and extrinsic components of the survival
curve.
The total cumulative age pattern of survival is the product of the extrinsic and intrinsic sur-
vival curves as shown in Eq 1.

 Due to the interaction of the intrinsic and extrinsic processes (i.e. the extrinsic process is
dependent on the distribution of vitality at each age, which is controlled by the two intrinsic
parameters), the two-process approach cannot be expressed in a closed form that could be fit
to data to yield parameter estimates. Li and Anderson [18] developed an approximate analyti-
cal solution that can be fit to data by assuming that vitality for the extrinsic process is a linear
deterministic function, thus giving independent intrinsic and extrinsic parts. This closed form
solution is the model we fit in this paper, however this solution does give slightly biased param-
eter estimates—somewhat low for r and β and somewhat high for s and λ. Li and Anderson
provide a set of bias-correction formulas based on simulation with a numerical form of the
model with greater interaction between the two processes [18]. Because the closed form version
of the vitality model we fit in this paper has limited parameter interactions, we use a maximum
likelihood method to estimate the model parameters for age interval survival data [30]. See
Li and Anderson [18] and S1 Appendix for further details on model development and bias
correction.
All model fitting is performed with the fitting routines provided in the ‘vitality’ package
available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) (http://cran.r-project.org/web/
packages/vitality/index.html). Once we’ve obtained parameter estimates and calculated the fit-
ted survival curves from intrinsic and extrinsic processes using Eqs 2 and 3, we compare these
quantities for the twins and general population.
Intrinsic and Extrinsic Components from cohort data
A final note on interpretation concerns period versus cohort data. Because they are of biologi-
cal origin, intrinsic parameters estimated from cohort data are by definition constant within
the cohort and are expected to change slowly across cohorts. In contrast, extrinsic parameters,
which reflect environmental conditions, may be considered constant in a given period but
change from one period to the next [18]. Therefore, extrinsic parameters estimated from
cohort data represent weighted averages of environmental conditions comprising the cohort.
Results
Let us begin with a discussion of the cumulative survival functions arising from the two mortal-
ity processes to assess their contributions by age. Fig 3 shows the intrinsic and extrinsic

 cumulative survival curves for the twins and the general population. The model fits to the
observed cumulative survival data are shown in Fig 4.
For females, there is virtually no difference in intrinsic survival between either zygosity or
the general female population (solid lines in Fig 3a). The difference in age-specific survival
among females lies with extrinsic mortality where MZ females have a survival advantage over
DZ females and the general population across the entire life course (dashed lines in Fig 3a).
Similarly, DZ females have an extrinsic survival advantage over the general population until
roughly age 90. The bias-corrected fitted model parameters, which are shown in Fig 5, can lend
some additional detail to the fitted survival curves (In the interests of accepted scientific prac-
tice and for the reader’s benefit this figure also shows the confidence intervals as two standard
errors—calculated by taking the square root of the corresponding elements of the estimated
variance matrix [30]—on either side of the parameter estimate. However, we caution against
over interpreting these intervals since the size of the standard error depends on the initial
cohort size, which is obviously much larger for the general population than for either twin
group, yielding seemingly large errors for the twin groups by comparison.). Among females
there is of course very little difference in the intrinsic parameters, but MZ females do have a
slightly lower frequency of extrinsic challenges (parameter λ) compared to DZ females and
both female zygositites experience lower challenge magnitudes (parameter β) compared to the
general population leading to lower extrinsic mortality rates and greater survival at nearly
every age.
While MZ males also see an advantage in extrinsic mortality for most of life, this relation-
ship reverses at about age 70 (dashed lines in Fig 3b). Unlike female twins where the entire sur-
vival advantage can be attributed to lower extrinsic mortality, MZ males have lower intrinsic
mortality rates at ages >65 indicating the survival advantage for MZ males is driven by lower
extrinsic mortality in midlife and lower intrinsic mortality in old age compared to DZ males
and the general population. Again, these patterns are detailed in the model parameter estimates
(Fig 5). The MZ male intrinsic survival advantage is driven by a smaller r, the rate of vitality
loss, since, like females, s is similar for the groups we compare here. While MZ males do have a
greater frequency of challenges, which taken by itself might indicate higher extrinsic mortality,
note from Eq 3 that extrinsic survival is dependent on not just the frequency and magnitude of
extrinsic challenges but also the rate of vitality loss. The smaller r indicates a slower rate of
vitality loss for MZ males giving them higher vitality paths overall, which makes them less

 susceptible to high magnitude challenges relative to DZ males and the general population. Not
only are MZ males less susceptible to environmental challenges, they also experience smaller
magnitude challenges as indicated by the smaller β. Likewise, DZ males have smaller magni-
tude challenges compared to the general population. In sum, the MZ male survival advantage
is driven by lower extrinsic mortality earlier in life marked by smaller magnitude environmen-
tal challenges and lower intrinsic mortality later in life marked by a slower rate of vitality loss,
while the DZ male survival advantage over the general population is driven primarily by
smaller magnitude challenges.

 The survival advantage of MZ males over DZ males at advanced age can be explained by the
slower rate of vitality loss for MZ males, but bear in mind that differences in r reflect not only
genetic differences but also differences in cumulative health behaviors over the life course (e.g.
smoking, diet). In terms of vitality loss, it is unlikely that MZ twins as a group carry a special
genetic predisposition for longer lives compared to DZ twins or the general population. A plau-
sible alternative explanation for these survival advantages at old age is that the social closeness
of MZ twins over DZ twins may encourage positive cumulative health behaviors throughout
life (e.g. avoidance of smoking) that translate to higher survival proportions at advanced age
for MZ males.
For both sexes survival advantages in midlife by zygosity are explained by differential char-
acteristics of extrinsic challenges. Extrinsic challenges can include any number of direct causes
of death, e.g. intentional violence, accidents, acute illness, etc., so the smaller frequency and
magnitude of challenges leading to greater survival among twins indicates a protective effect
against extrinsic challenges that lead to death.
Both the protective effect against intrinsic death for MZ males at high ages and the protec-
tive effect against extrinsic death for both sexes at younger ages are akin to a marriage protec-
tion effect. A marriage protection refers to the fact that married adults are generally healthier
and at lower mortality risk than unmarried adults [31–34]. It is hypothesized that marriage is
associated with good health and lower mortality risk because marriage itself has some benefi-
cial aspect or that having a partner can encourage various good health practices [35], but it
may also be that healthier people select into marriage [36] rendering the association between
marriage and good health spurious. The study at hand documents a similar association
between zygosity and survival; however, twins do not have the confounding issue of self-selec-
tion into the lower mortality risk group.
Previous studies also suggest marriage protection effects tend to benefit male partners more
than female ones [31, 34, 37, 38], which could explain why the rate of vitality loss is lower for
MZ males compared to DZ males, but not lower for MZ females compared to DZ females. Fur-
thermore, the difference in extrinsic challenge magnitude between MZ and DZ twins is larger
among male twins than female twins (Fig 5) and Li and Anderson [18] show that over two cen-
turies of historical Swedish mortality data, challenge frequency is about 20% less for females
reflecting known risk-taking differences by sex. The sex differential in the model parameters
indicates the ‘twin protection effect’ mirrors marriage protection effects in that male twins
stand to benefit more from these extrinsic protective effects than female twins.
Validation
Finally, while we have high quality cohort data on the general population and all twins born in
Denmark at the end of the 19th century and assume any differences in survival among these
groups are due to zygosity or twin relationship, the twin data are few relative to the national
sample and may not be representative of mortality between twin groups or the general popula-
tion in other countries or time periods. Because the twin data set is relatively small compared
to the size of general population data, some unobserved mortality condition may result in an
unusual survival pattern in these twin cohorts, which our parameter estimates would reflect.
To address this issue, we performed a validation exercise in which the model was fit to ran-
domly selected subsets (75%) of the twin data for each zygosity. Repeating this process 1,000
times yields a distribution of model parameters that were compared to the parameter estimates
derived from the full data set. The bias-corrected parameter distributions are presented in Fig 6
and largely confirm the full sample fitting. Females show almost no difference in intrinsic
parameters with almost the full female advantage arising from extrinsic mortality. Male MZ

 twins also have an extrinsic advantage but coupled with a slower rate of vitality loss leading to
an intrinsic survival advantage at advanced ages.
Discussion
We fit a two-process vitality model by sex and zygosity to cumulative survival data from the
Danish Twin Registry and by sex to data from the Human Mortality Database for the 1870–
1900 Danish general population cohort to investigate the age-dependent effect of acute,

 extrinsic mortality and chronic, intrinsic mortality processes on survivorship patterns. Because
there is often a singular focus on the force of mortality by age, little research has partitioned
total mortality into these underlying processes. The vitality framework allows for the decompo-
sition of age-specific survival patterns into extrinsic and intrinsic components and therefor the
ability to isolate protective effects at different parts of the age range. When combined with the
research advantages of twin data, the two-process model serves as a unique means of assessing
the impact of zygosity and social and environmental factor interactions on human survival.
Overall, we find a survival advantage for MZ twins over DZ twins of both sexes at nearly
every age and of DZ twins over the general population, but that different processes confer these
advantages at different ages. For females, the survival advantage at all ages can be attributed to
lower extrinsic mortality rates. Among males, extrinsic advantages account for the survival
advantage up to about age 65 where the overall survival advantage begins to narrow and MZ
males show better intrinsic survival than DZ males and DZ males show better intrinsic survival
compared to the general population.
This research has documented a ‘twin protection effect’ akin to a marriage protection effect
where a socially close relationship contributes to better survival outcomes throughout most of
life. Notably, while we find evidence for a health protection effect arising from zygosity, the use
of twin data allows us to avoid the confounding issue of self-selection that studies of marriage
and health often encounter. Research on marriage protection effects as well as the findings pre-
sented in this paper are part of a larger body of literature that documents the importance of
social support and cohesion for mortality and longevity outcomes [39–41]. In this case greater
survival for MZ twins over DZ twins and DZ twins over the general population is driven by
lower extrinsic mortality at most ages, which is a likely consequence of the social bond between
twins buffering against risky behaviors, providing emotional or material assistance during
times of stress exposure, and promoting health-enhancing behaviors [39, 40].
We do not have further information on cause of death, marital status, or social circum-
stances among this set of twins that would allow further inquiry into the mechanism behind
the extrinsic survival advantage at younger ages, but further research in this area may lead to
policy recommendations on improving social support at younger ages to lower mortality risk
especially among young adult and working-age males.
