Abstract
BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE—Exposure to food advertisements may cue overeating among 
children, especially among those genetically predisposed to respond to food cues. We aimed to 
assess how television food advertisements affect eating in the absence of hunger among children in 
a randomized trial. We hypothesized that the Fat Mass and Obesity Associated Gene (FTO) 
rs9939609 single nucleotide polymorphism would modify the effect of food advertisements.
SUBJECTS/METHODS—In this randomized experiment, 200 children aged 9–10 years old 
were served a standardized lunch and then shown a 34-minute television show embedded with 
either food or toy advertisements. Children were provided with snack food to consume ad libitum 
while watching the show and we measured caloric intake. Children were genotyped for rs9939609 
and analyses were conducted in the overall sample and stratified by genotype. A formal test for 
interaction of the food ad effect on consumption by rs9939609 was conducted.
RESULTS—172 unrelated participants were included in this analysis. Children consumed on 
average 453 (SD=185) kCals during lunch and 482 (SD=274) kCals during the experimental 
exposure. Children who viewed food advertisements consumed an average of 48 kCals (95% CI: 
10, 85; P=0.01) more of a recently advertised food than those who viewed toy advertisements. 
There was a statistically significant interaction between genotype and food advertisement 
condition (P for interaction = 0.02), where the difference in consumption of a recently advertised 
food related to food advertisement exposure increased linearly with each additional FTO risk 
allele, even after controlling for BMI percentile.
CONCLUSIONS—Food advertisement exposure was associated with greater caloric 
consumption of a recently advertised food, and this effect was modified by an FTO genotype.

associations.
Introduction
Over one third of U.S. children are overweight or obese1 putting them at higher risk for 
adverse health outcomes.2–4 Food intake must balance with energy expenditure and growth 
demands in order for children to maintain a healthy body weight. Complex neural regulatory 
feedback systems monitor available energy stores in the body in order to prompt feeding 
behaviors to match energy needs.5 While these homeostatic mechanisms play a critical role 
in maintaining energy balance, non-homeostatic (hedonic) pathways can also drive 
consumption of highly palatable foods.6 Such foods are known to activate the dopaminergic 
mesolimbic pathway that is responsible for detecting rewarding stimuli and motivating 
behaviors to repeat exposure to those stimuli.7 This pathway is also involved in classical 
conditioning,8 i.e. a learning process where a reward-related stimulus can lead to 
anticipation and motivation for that reward.9 Our current obesogenic environment is replete 
with food-related stimuli, or food cues, that may activate reward pathways and motivate 
overconsumption.
Food advertising is a highly pervasive source of exposure to food cues. The food industry 
spends $1.79 billion marketing primarily energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods to U.S. children 
under 11 years old,10 resulting in an average viewing of 15 TV ads per day or 5,500 over 
each year.11 Given the high prevalence of exposure, it is important to understand whether 
TV food ads prompt excessive caloric consumption in children.
Randomized studies assessing whether TV food advertising affects consumption in children 
have had mixed results. Some have shown significantly higher consumption when children 
view food ads compared to non-food ads.12–16 For example, Harris et al. showed 118 
children, ages 7–11 years, two minutes of food or non-food ads embedded in a 14-minute 
cartoon and provided crackers to consume while watching the show.16 Children who viewed 
the food ads consumed an average of 28.5 g (133 kCals) more than those shown the non-
food ads, even though the crackers were not advertised during the session. Others have not 
observed a main effect of food ad exposure on consumption;17–21 however, several of these 
studies reported effects of food ad exposure in subsets of participants (e.g. boys17 and 
children with maternal encouragement to be thin18), or when looking at specific foods (e.g. 
celebrity-endorsed foods19).
Genetic factors likely interact with environmental drivers of eating behavior and could affect 
how individuals respond to environmental cues to eat. A common variant in the Fat Mass 
and Obesity Associated (FTO) gene was the first genetic factor to be associated with 
common obesity in large genome-wide association studies.22,23 While the biological 
mechanism is yet unknown pediatric studies suggest that FTO may decrease satiety 
responsiveness and lead to excess consumption.24–26 Interestingly, one study (n=24) 
examined FTO rs9939609 in relation to brain response to food images in adult men.27 The 
authors reported that, for the participants in a fasted state, FTO homozygous high-risk 
participants had a significantly greater response to food vs. nonfood images in brain reward

 regions compared to homozygous low-risk participants. This past research motivated our 
hypothesis that children with the FTO rs9939609 high-risk allele would have heightened 
susceptibility to excess consumption after viewing food ads.
In this study, we tested the effect of food ad exposure on cued eating among children 
enrolled in a randomized trial and further explored whether a common variant in FTO 
modified that effect.
Subjects and Methods
Participants
We recruited 200 children through community fliers and a contact list from Children’s 
Hospital at Dartmouth between July 2013 and February 2015 (Figure 1). Inclusion criteria 
included age 9 or 10 years, English fluency, absence of food allergies/restrictions, and 
absence of health conditions/medication use that may impact appetite or attention span. One 
caregiver accompanied each child to the visit. Participants were told that the study focused 
on how children process visual media. Caregivers and children provided written consent and 
assent, respectively, and Dartmouth’s Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects 
approved all study protocols.
To limit the analysis to unrelated children, one sibling from each of 21 sibling pairs was 
excluded at random using a computerized random number generator. In addition, four 
children were excluded because they did not report satiety after lunch, and three were 
excluded because of protocol violations (i.e., health condition potentially affecting appetite, 
caregiver interaction with child during experiment). The final analysis sample thus consisted 
of 172 unrelated children. There were no significant differences between included and 
excluded children in terms of baseline covariates or consumption (data not shown).
Preload Lunch
Children and one parent were schedule for a study appointment at 11:30 am or 12:30 pm. 
Children were instructed to eat a normal breakfast, but not to eat for the two hours prior to 
the appointment. During the appointment, children were provided lunch with their choice of 
main dish (macaroni and cheese, pizza bites, or chicken nuggets with ketchup), along with 
string cheese, carrots and dressing, apple slices, bread, butter, milk, and water. All meals 
were 1153–1183 kCals to help ensure that children would eat to satiety. Meals were 
balanced on macronutrients and contained 552–704 kCals of carbohydrates, 315–405 kCals 
of fat, and 152–188 kCals of protein. Foods were pre-and post-weighed, and nutrient labels 
and the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference28 were used to calculate 
caloric consumption.
After lunch, each child was asked to assess his/her satiety with a 5-point Likert scale ranging 
from “I am very hungry” to “I am very full”. Children who reported, “I am very hungry” or 
“I am a little hungry” were excluded from the analysis.

 Food Advertisement Exposure
After lunch, all children viewed a 34-minute TV show (Figure it Out!, Nickelodeon) that 
included 7.7 minutes of either food or toy ads, along with 3.1 minutes of neutral ads. The 
products advertised are listed in Table S2.
Eating in the Absence of Hunger
Our outcome measure was caloric consumption after self-reported satiety, i.e., eating in the 
absence of hunger (EAH),29,30 during the experimental exposure. We provided four snack 
foods during the experimental exposure: gummy candy (546 kCals), cookies (692 kCals), 
chocolate (1000 kCals), and cheese puffs (536 kCals). Only the gummy candy was 
advertised during the food ad condition. Nutritional information for the snack foods is 
presented in Table S1. Food was pre- and post-weighed, and product nutrition information 
was used to calculate caloric consumption.
FTO rs9939609 Genotyping
Buccal cell swabs were collected before lunch and stored at room temperature with 
desiccant capsules (Isohelix, Kent, U.K.). DNA was isolated using DDK-50 isolation kits 
(Isohelix, Kent, U.K.). Genotyping for rs9939609 was conducted with real-time PCR and 
Taqman chemistry using the 7500 Fast Real-time instrument (primers and instrument from 
Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, USA)). All samples were successfully genotyped and 
there was 100% genotyping consistency among the 10% blinded replicates.
Covariates
We measured children’s weight (to the nearest 0.1 kg) and height (to the nearest 0.5 cm), 
using a digital scale and stadiometer (Model 597KL, Seca, Hamberg, Germany). We 
calculated body mass index (BMI) percentile using U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) 
2000 age- and sex-specific distributions.31 Healthy weight was defined as <85th percentile, 
overweight was defined as ≥85th – <95th percentile and obese was defined as ≥95th 
percentile.
Estimated daily energy requirement (EER) was calculated according to Institute of Medicine 
guidelines using child’s sex, measured height and weight, and caregiver-reported daily 
average physical activity.32 Caregivers answered, “How much time does your child spend 
doing physical activity such as running around, climbing, biking, dancing, swimming, 
playing sports, etc.?” separately for school or weekend days. A single weighted average was 
created and categorized as “sedentary” for <30, “low active” for 30–<60, “active” for 60–
<120, and “very active” for ≥120 min/day.
Caregivers reported their child’s race and ethnicity, their highest level of education, their 
spouse’s highest level of education, and their household income category. Caregivers also 
reported their child’s typical number of hours spent watching TV or movies on a weekend 
day and school day, and responses were used to create a single weighted average. “Parental 
eating restriction” was calculated as an average of caregiver responses to the restriction 
subscale questions of the Child Feeding Questionnaire,33 (e.g., “I decide what my child eats”

 answered on a scale of: 1=disagree, 2=slightly disagree, 3=neutral, 4=slightly agree, and 
5=agree).
Statistical Analysis
We compared participant characteristics by study condition using unpaired, 2-tailed t-tests 
for continuous measures and X2 or Fisher’s Exact tests for categorical measures, as 
appropriate. Next, we examined unadjusted associations between participant characteristics 
and caloric consumption during the lunch and EAH phases using linear regression; 
consumption during the EAH phase was computed for total foods and separately for foods 
that were and were not advertised during the experiment. We then estimated the effect of the 
experimental condition on EAH for total foods, advertised food, and non-advertised foods 
separately using multivariable linear regression adjusted for EER and all covariates related 
to EAH at the P < 0.10 threshold. We did not include sex and BMI percentile as covariates 
because they were used to calculate EER; however, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to 
determine whether adding those variables to the final models influenced findings. To address 
whether the FTO rs9939609 genotype modified the effect between food ad exposure and 
EAH, we included a multiplicative interaction term between the exposure and genotype in 
the adjusted models and used a Wald test to determine the significance of the interaction 
term.
To assess the robustness of our findings, we repeated the final models after excluding 
participants who were above the 90th percentile for EAH consumption (>840 kCals). We 
also performed analyses stratified by sex and weight status, because some previous studies 
found interactions between food ad exposure and these variables on consumption. We 
conducted all analyses using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, USA).
Results
The analysis included 172 children who were equally distributed across study conditions 
(Table 1). Approximately half of the children were male, and they were mostly white (86%) 
and non-Hispanic (97%). Twenty-three percent of children were overweight or obese, which 
is slightly lower than the New Hampshire rate of 26%. The mothers of the children were 
generally highly educated with 78% obtaining at least a college degree. Children watched an 
average (SD) of 1.4 (1.0) hours of TV per day. Baseline characteristics were balanced across 
experimental conditions with the exception of EER, which was 145 kCals higher in the toy 
vs. food arm of the study (P = 0.03).
The frequency of FTO rs9939609 genotype frequencies (36% TT, 48% AT, and 16% AA) 
were similar to those of other studies22 and were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium (X2 test P value = 0.93). There was a strong relationship between the FTO 
genotype and adiposity; the rate of overweight/obesity was 18% among low-risk (TT) 
children compared to 44% among the highest-risk (AA) children (P < 0.01). In our sample, 
21% of heterozygotes were overweight/obese, a rate similar to that for homozygous low-risk 
participants (P = 0.68). The FTO genotype was not associated with any other child, caregiver 
or household characteristic at the P <0.05 significance level (Table S3).

 Participants across both experimental conditions consumed an average (SD) of 453 (185) 
kCals during lunch. Being male, having a higher BMI, and having a higher EER were 
associated with higher caloric consumption at lunch (Table 2).
Participants consumed an additional 482 (SD: 274) kCals during the EAH phase. Baseline 
characteristics associated with greater total EAH consumption were being male, increased 
BMI percentile, EER and parental eating restriction (Table 2). There was a statistically 
significant main effect of the food vs. toy ad exposure on the consumption of the food 
advertised during the session; children exposed to food ads consumed, on average, 44 
additional calories of gummy candy than children exposed to toy ads (P = 0.02). There was 
no main effect of experimental condition on total consumption or on foods not advertised 
during the experiment.
In analyses adjusted for EER and parental eating restriction (Table 3), the association 
between food ad exposure and consumption of the advertised food remained similar (β = 48 
kCals, P = 0.01). There were no main effects for total consumption (P = 0.21) or 
consumption of foods not advertised (P = 0.98). We conducted a Bonferonni correction of 
the significance level for the 3 hypothesis tests of consumption conducted (total food, 
advertised food, non-advertised food) and the association between food ad exposure and 
consumption of advertised food was still significant at the P < 0.017 level.
In a sensitivity analysis that also included sex and BMI percentile in the final models, results 
were not substantially changed. Findings also remained unchanged when the analysis was 
restricted to individuals below the 90th percentile of EAH consumption. In addition, findings 
were unchanged in analyses restricted to white participants.
There was a significant interaction between the FTO rs9939609 genotype and food ad 
exposure with advertised food consumption (P for interaction = 0.02) (Figure 2). The 
magnitude of the association between food ad exposure and consumption increased linearly 
with each additional risk allele; the estimate (95% CI) for the TT, AT, and AA genotypes 
were −3 (−64, 59), 59 (4, 115), and 125 (16, 233) kCals, respectively. Stratum-specific 
estimates also increased linearly when considering total foods rather than only the advertised 
food, though the estimates were not significant, nor was the interaction. There were no 
significant interactions between participant sex or weight status with food ad exposure on 
consumption (data not shown).
Discussion
In this randomized study, we observed a significant interaction between the FTO rs9939609 
genotype and food ad exposure on the consumption of a recently advertised food. Our 
results suggest that the FTO obesity-risk allele may confer children with a predisposition to 
heightened consumption in response to food cues. Although we did not find evidence of a 
generalized effect of food ad exposure on overall cued eating, we did find that exposure to 
food ads influenced the consumption of a recently advertised food. During just 34 minutes 
of TV viewing, children who viewed a show with embedded food ads, including one ad for 
gummy candy, ate an average of 48 more kCals of gummy candy than children who viewed

 toy ads. Moreover, that consumption occurred immediately after children reported eating 
lunch to satiety, reflecting excessive intake. The implications of such findings are concerning 
given the frequent exposure that children have to TV food ads and that the majority of 
television food advertising is for energy-dense, nutrient poor foods.34
Food cues such as those present in food advertising are thought to drive non-homeostatic 
pathways of food consumption via their incentive-motivational properties acquired via 
classical conditioning.9,35 The nucleus accumbens, part of the dopaminergic reward pathway 
of the brain, is the likely functional interface between motivational food cues and 
consumptive behaviors,36 and functional neuroimaging studies have observed activation of 
the nucleus accumbens in response to food advertisements.37,38 In addition, studies also 
suggest that the neural reward response to food cues is greater for participants with FTO 
rs9939609 obesity risk alleles, independent of adiposity.27,38 FTO rs9939609 may regulate 
dopamine (D2)-dependent reward learning,39 so the increased responsiveness to food cues 
may be a result of heightened prior conditioning. We hypothesize that genetic differences in 
the neural reward response to food cues underlies our observed behavioral findings; 
however, further research is needed to better understand genetic differences in the effect of 
food cues on overconsumption.
Ten studies performed by five unique research groups have explored measured food 
consumption in children during or after viewing TV food ads (systematically reviewed by 
Boyland in 201640).12–21 Of these studies, five reported a main effect of food ad 
exposure.12–16 A series of school-based experiments in the U.K. found that children 
consumed more after viewing a TV program proceeded by 8–10 food ads compared to toy 
ads.13–15 While compelling, the non-naturalistic presentation of ads in a single block before 
the show may have suggested the study goals to participants and thereby influenced 
behavior. However, two other studies presented the ads during more naturalistic commercial 
breaks, as we did in our study, and showed increased consumption related to food ad 
exposure.12,16 The remaining five studies did not find a main effect of food advertising 
exposure on consumption.17–21
The fact that the advertising effect was only observed for an advertised food differs from the 
majority of previous studies on cued eating that have demonstrated that the effect of 
advertising extends to non-advertised foods, a “beyond-brand” effect.40 Unlike our study, 
however, most of those previous studies only provided participants with foods that were not 
advertised during the experimental session and did not also provide them the choice of an 
advertised food. Only one other study provided participants with the choice between an 
advertised and non-advertised food; in that study, exposure to an ad for a celebrity-endorsed 
potato chip increased consumption of that specific chip, but did not impact consumption of 
chips with a generic label.19 Like our study, that study also did not observe a significant 
difference in consumption of the non-advertised food across study condition. We do not 
deem our study findings a contradiction of a beyond-brand effect, but consider them 
evidence of a preference for consuming advertised food when provided, a behavior that was 
not captured in most previous studies. The specificity of our food ad effect could also relate 
to the particular characteristics of the gummy candy, such as macronutrient composition, 
that differ from those of the other provided foods (cookies, chocolate, cheese puffs). In

 addition, while only one ad for the gummy candy was shown, six of the 20 ads shown were 
for candy and those ads may have also influenced the consumption of the gummy candy. 
Future research is necessary to better understand the observed specificity of the advertising 
effect on consumption.
The implications of our findings for weight gain are unclear given that we did not find a 
significant difference in total caloric consumption related to ad exposure, though we did 
observe a positive trend for the association. Given the high inter-individual variability in 
total consumption, our study may have been underpowered to test the effect of food ad 
exposure on this outcome. Unlike four of the five studies that found a significant main effect, 
our study did not measure consumption in the same children under both conditions. While a 
within-participant design may have been more powerful, we chose not to use such a design 
because of our concerns that participant awareness of study goals could influence their 
behavior. We posited that children would be more likely to remain naïve to the study goals 
when they were randomized to a single experiment condition. A larger study will be 
necessary to more definitively assess food ad exposure’s effect on total consumption.
Our finding that parental eating restriction of child eating was positively related to total 
consumption recapitulate results from other groups.41–43 It is possible that children develop 
an increased preference for restricted foods.44 Alternatively, parents may impose more 
restrictive feeding practices in response to a child’s tendency to overeat. Longitudinal 
studies are necessary to clarify the directionality of this relationship.
This study has the strength of controlling for initial satiety level, thereby enabling us to 
measure EAH. Indeed, a surprising finding was that children consumed approximately the 
same number of calories during the EAH and lunch phases, suggesting the inability of 
children to regulate caloric intake when presented with highly palatable foods. Through this 
EAH paradigm, we were able to demonstrate that recent food ad exposure prompted children 
to consume a recently advertised food even when they were full.
Our study was limited in that it measured one instance of cued eating in a laboratory setting, 
and it is unknown whether children compensate for increased short-term intake by 
modifying long-term intake, thus mitigating any effects on excess weight gain. Also, the 
generalizability of our laboratory-based findings to the home environment is unknown. 
However, studies suggest that children frequently eat snacks while watching TV.45 
Furthermore, studies also suggests that TV ads prompt children to request the purchase of 
advertised foods,46,47 which may relate to an increased availability of those foods at home. 
Thus, it is plausible that exposure to TV food ads among children at home may indeed relate 
to cued eating.
While TV is still a primary mechanism for advertising to children,11 food companies are 
increasingly using other marketing tactics.10 For example, advergames, internet games that 
promote brand recognition, have been shown to increase short-term caloric consumption in 
children.48,49 In addition, the use of celebrity endorsements19 and character tie-ins50 is 
concerning and warrants further research.

 Our study was also limited by its examination of a single genetic obesity risk factor, 
rs9939609. This polymorphism has shown one of the strongest associations with child 
obesity, however, so understanding potential mechanisms of its action are of both scientific 
and public health importance. This is also one of the first studies to examine genetic 
predisposition to reactivity to food cues and the first examination of this research area in 
children. Our study cannot rule out the possibility that unmeasured confounders, like other 
genetic loci related to excess consumption, were unbalanced between study arms and could 
have contributed to the association we report. Future, larger studies are necessary to study 
multiple genetic obesity risk factors related to food cue reactivity.
Conclusion
In this randomized experimental trial, exposure to TV food ads was associated with 
increased caloric consumption of a recently advertised food in children who had already 
eaten a meal to satiety, and that association was modified by the FTO rs9939609 obesity-risk 
allele. Future research is needed to understand the neurological mechanism underlying these 
associations and whether other genetic risk factors also influence reactivity to food cues. 
Given the high exposure that children have to ads marketing unhealthy foods, the observed 
cued eating may have a substantial impact on children’s dietary choices.
