ABSTRACT 
Background & Aims: We examined the relationship between symptoms of depression and 
anxiety and clinical recurrence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a large patient cohort. 
We considered the progression of depression and anxiety over time. 
 
Methods: We collected clinical and treatment data on 2007 adult participants in an IBD study 
(56% with Crohn’s disease [CD], 48% male) performed in Switzerland from 2006 through 
2015. Depression and anxiety symptoms were quantified using the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale. The relationship between depression and anxiety scores and the clinical 
recurrence was analyzed using survival–time techniques.  
 
Results: We found a significant association between symptoms of depression and clinical 
recurrence over time (for all patients with IBD, P=.000001; for subjects with CD, P=.0007; 
for subjects with ulcerative colitis, P=.005). There was also a significant relationship between 
symptoms of anxiety and clinical recurrence over time in all subjects with IBD (P=.0014) and 
in subjects with CD (P=.031), but not ulcerative colitis (P=.066).  
 
Conclusions: In an analysis of a large cohort of subjects with IBD, we found a significant 
association between symptoms of depression or anxiety and clinical recurrence. Patients with 
IBD should therefore be screened for clinically relevant levels of depression and anxiety and 
referred to psychologists or psychiatrists for further evaluation and treatment.

INTRODUCTION 
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), of which Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) 
and indeterminate colitis (IC) are subtypes, is a chronic relapsing gastrointestinal condition 
with etiology involving a deregulated immune response to intestinal microbiome, triggered 
by environmental factors, in those with a genetic susceptibility. There are over 2.2 million 
people living with IBD in Europe,(1) 12,000 in Switzerland alone,(2) and its incidence is on 
the rise.(3) The overall annual cost of IBD to European healthcare systems is estimated to be 
EUR4.6-5.6 billion.(3)  
 
IBD is associated with a clinically highly relevant and significant psychosocial burden.(4-9) 
A large Canadian population-based study reported the rates of depression in IBD to be three 
times higher than in the healthy population.(9) Symptoms of depression and anxiety have 
been linked to more severe IBD symptoms and more frequent IBD flares,(8) increased  
hospitalisation rates,(10) and lower compliance with treatment.(11) However, the relationship 
of depression and anxiety with disease activity in IBD has been controversial,(12) with no 
causal link established to date. Although some reviews have been published on the 
relationship between psychological factors and disease activity,(13-15) none to date has been 
systematic.   
 
Our recent search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO and Web of Science, for the 
purpose of this study, identified 12 prospective studies on depression and anxiety in IBD 
(studies on stress only were excluded), with samples varying from 18 to 388(8, 16-26) and an 
observation period of up to 37 months. Seven of these studies (n=978) observed a significant 
positive relationship between symptoms of depression and anxiety and disease activity(8, 16, 
19-21, 23, 24) while five (n=336) did not make this observation.(17, 18, 22, 25, 26) The

conflicting evidence in these studies may result from the observation periods that were too 
short (only in five studies the follow up exceeded one year) and small and unrepresentative 
samples (six studies with n<100), but also from different definitions and measures of 
depression and anxiety (only one study(16) used clinical interviews and thus provided data on 
the diagnosis of depression and anxiety rather than symptoms only), and measures of disease 
activity. Studies addressing these limitations of the previous literature are needed to inform 
current research and practice in IBD.    
 
The Swiss IBD cohort (SIBDC) offers an ideal setting for conducting a comprehensive study 
on a large IBD sample over a long period of time, allowing for an observation of the natural 
course of IBD. The present study thus aimed to examine the relationship between symptoms 
of depression and anxiety and clinical recurrence in a large IBD cohort, by taking into 
account the progression of depression and anxiety over time. The study examined the 
following hypothesis: There is a significant relationship between depression and anxiety 
symptoms and clinical recurrence over time. Given the inconclusive results across previous 
studies, we did not specify the direction of this relationship.    
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Design and setting 
This is a prospective cohort study using data from participants who had been included in the 
SIBDC between 2006 and 2015.(2) Participants were included through their treating 
gastroenterologist, located in Swiss university hospitals, regional hospitals and private 
practices. Clinical and treatment data were collected during the enrolment and yearly follow-
up medical visits; in addition, participants were receiving self-administered questionnaires (at 
 MANUSCRIPT

enrolment and on a yearly basis) comprising socio-demographic and psychosocial data, to be 
completed at home. The study reporting followed the STROBE Statement. 
Selection criteria 
All adult patients who were enrolled in the SIBDC (to be included, patients must have a 
diagnosis established at least 4 months prior to inclusion or have had at least one recurrence 
of symptoms), who completed the baseline patient self-reported questionnaire and the one 
year follow-up medical visit, were included. Pregnant patients and those with missing data on 
depression and anxiety scores were excluded.  
 
Measures  
To minimize the assessment bias and optimize data quality of the registry, gastroenterologists 
and study nurses were asked to clarify inconclusive data for information collected from 
patient charts (clinical and treatment characteristics).  
  
Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale (HADS). The HADS is a self-assessment mood scale developed for medical 
outpatients(27) containing 14 questions graded on a 4-point Likert scale, with subscales of 
anxiety and depression, with a sum score ranging from 0 to 21 for each, and a cut-off value of 
>7 on either of the two subscales. The scores of 0-7 are considered normal; 8-10 are 
indicative of mild anxiety / depression symptoms; 11-14 are indicative of moderate anxiety / 
depression symptoms; 15-21 are indicative of severe anxiety / depression symptoms. 
 
Disease activity measures included the widely used Crohn’s Disease Activity Index 
(CDAI)(28) and the Modified Truelove and Witts Severity Index (MTWAI),(29, 30) as 
appropriate. These were collected by the clinicians.

Outcome measure 
We were interested in the relationship between the symptoms of depression and anxiety and a 
clinical recurrence, as a measure of outcome. The outcome was constructed by taking account 
of the following variables: disease activity, flare events or worsening of the disease 
(established by physicians as part of their assessment of the patient’s overall disease activity), 
fistulas and stenosis, anal fissure, abscess, IBD surgery (including any type of resection, 
colectomy, ileostomy, colostomy), and intake of steroids or biologics. The endpoint was 
reached when any of these events occurred. Each participant started with a value of 0 at 
baseline, and this value became 1 when an event occurred. If a participant had already 
experienced the outcome (e.g. a fistula) at baseline, we were then interested in the appearance 
of the next event. We were interested in the time of the first appearance of a clinical 
recurrence event after enrolment. For each participant, we defined a time interval (��, ����] 
where �� corresponded to the time of the ��� visit. In this situation, we knew that no relevant 
event had occurred before ��, but at least one clinical recurrence event from the list above 
occurred between �� and ����.   
 
Data Analysis 
The composite outcome measure (clinical recurrence) was a 0/1 variable, which was analyzed 
using survival-time techniques. For each participant, the time between 0 and ���� was split in 
several smaller subintervals, according to their depression and anxiety levels. In each 
subinterval, depression and anxiety were assumed to be constant. The non-parametric 
approach of Kaplan-Meier curves with standard survival techniques, where events occurred 
exactly at t���, was applied. The obtained survival curves were compared using the log-rank

test, in order to quantify differences in survival probability (event-free probability) between 
participants with and without depression and anxiety. Missing or invalid information on the 
variables of interest resulted in exclusion of the respective case from analysis.      
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The ethical committees of all Cantons where participants were included approved the Swiss 
IBD Cohort Study, and all the participants were enrolled after providing written informed 
consent. 
 
RESULTS 
Descriptive statistics 
Of the 2,886 participants registered in the Swiss IBD cohort, 879 did not meet the inclusion 
criteria for the present study and were excluded. In particular, after excluding pregnant 
patients, 2,870 (99.4%) cases remained in the study. After excluding those who did not 
answer the questionnaire, 2,321 (80.4%) cases remained in the study. After excluding patients 
for whom depression and anxiety levels were unknown, 2,289 (79.3%) remained in the study, 
and finally, after excluding participants that were lost to follow-up (participants are 
considered lost-to-follow-up if they did not come for a medical visit / did not reply to a 
patient questionnaire for >= 18 months) after the enrollment, 2,007 (69.5%) remained in the 
study and these 2,007 participants were thus included in the analysis.   
 
Overall, 55.9% participants had CD, and 48.3% were males (CD: 45.6%, UC: 51.8%). At 
baseline, median age was 40.5 years, median disease duration was 7.2 years, and 20.2% of 
participants had a depression score while 37.5% had an anxiety score above the cut-off value 
(>7) (Table 1). There was no difference between the sexes in depression at baseline (200 
(20.6%) males versus 205 (19.8%) females, p=0.635). However, there was a significant 
 MANUSCRIPT

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
9 
 
difference in anxiety at baseline between the sexes, with 304 (31.3%) male participants 
versus 448 (43.2%) female participants anxious (p<0.001). There was no significant 
association between the CDAI score, anxiety or depression at baseline (p=0.221 and p=0.266, 
respectively). Similarly, there was no association between the MTWAI score, anxiety or 
depression (p=0.167 and p=0.288, respectively). 
 
Symptoms of depression and anxiety and clinical recurrence over time 
Figure 1 and Figure 2 present the Kaplan-Meier curves of the association between depression 
symptoms, anxiety symptoms and clinical recurrence. There was a strong and statistically 
significant relationship between depression and clinical recurrence over time (all IBD 
p=0.000001; CD p=0.0007; UC p=0.005). However, this relationship was less obvious for 
anxiety symptoms. The relationship between anxiety and clinical recurrence over time was 
observable in the whole sample (p=0.0014) and in the CD participants alone (p=0.031), but 
not in the UC participants (p=0.066). These results indicated that those IBD participants who 
reported clinically relevant symptoms of depression or anxiety (HADS score >7) had shorter 
time to a clinical recurrence event than the participants without depression or anxiety 
symptoms. When sex was factored in the Kaplan-Meier curves and a comparison conducted 
using a log-rank test, no significant difference was detected (p>0.05), indicating that the 
relationship between depression and clinical recurrence or anxiety and clinical recurrence is 
not influenced by sex.   
 
Exploring particular components of the composite outcome responsible for the effect, using 
the Kaplan-Meier curves, we observed that there was a statistically significant relationship 
between depression and fistula in CD patients (p=0.009); between anxiety and flares in CD 
and UC (p=0.070 and p=0.044, respectively) and between depression and flares in UC

(p=0.013); depression and surgery in CD (p=0.007); anxiety and biologics use and depression 
and biologics use in CD (p<0.001 and p=0.016, respectively); depression and steroids use in 
CD (p=0.035) and anxiety and steroids use in UC (p=0.013).

DISCUSSION 
This study is the largest to date prospective design on the relationship between depression 
and anxiety and clinical recurrence in IBD. While previous prospective studies on the topic 
exist, due to small samples, short observation periods and inconsistencies in measuring 
depression/anxiety and disease activity, the relationship between depression, anxiety and 
disease activity in IBD has been controversial.   
 
Examining the longitudinal data of over 2,000 Swiss IBD participants, we found that 
symptoms of depression are associated with clinical recurrence, with those depressed having 
a significantly shorter time to a clinical recurrence event. The link between depressive 
symptoms and clinical recurrence appears stronger in participants with CD, which has been 
previously reported in several much smaller studies.(12) Our study’s results are consistent 
with the results of seven out of 12 previous prospective studies,(8, 16, 19-21, 23, 24) 
offering, however, a significantly larger sample and the observations conducted from 2006 
till 2015, and thus the longest to date. In addition, our approach to defining clinical 
recurrence was different than in the previous studies as we used a composite outcome 
measure while the majority of studies relied solely on a single disease activity measure such 
as the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) which can be highly subjective. Opting to rely 
on physician-reported flare events, fistulas and stenosis (for CD only), IBD surgery, and 
steroids or biologics intake has allowed us to provide a more robust and likely less biased 
measure of clinical recurrence than relying on a single disease activity measure.  
 
While anxiety is a more prevalent mental disorder than depression [its 12-month prevalence 
in IBD is 17.9% as compared to 10.5% for mood disorders(31)], the role played by anxiety in 
terms of its negative influence on IBD activity seems less pronounced than that of depression.

Anxiety frequently coexists with depression and together with psychological stress, which is 
best examined of the three in the context of IBD, they impact inflammation.(32) Stress has 
also been linked to disease activity in 13 out of 18 prospective studies systematically 
reviewed by Camara et al.(33) Nevertheless, as there is a lack of research differentiating 
between depression and anxiety in terms of their specific impact on inflammation in IBD, it is 
unknown whether pathophysiology of either disorder can explain a stronger relationship of 
depression to clinical recurrence in IBD in the present study. It is, however, clear that 
symptoms of depression such as, for example, loss of interest in daily activities may lead to 
non-compliance with IBD treatment,(11) which, in turn, can lead to a flare. In addition, 
anxiety is often not a constant symptom in IBD participants  but rather related to a situation, 
for example, it can rise when patients have no easy access to a toilet but then drops to a 
normal level when the patient returns home. It is thus possible that an ongoing character of 
depressive symptoms is responsible for its strong relationship with clinical recurrence.  
 
Finally, this study unavoidably has limitations. One of them is reliance on patient self-report 
in psychological measures. A psychological diagnostic interview would likely provide more 
accurate rates of depression and anxiety than the HADS which is a screening measure unable 
to provide a diagnosis. Further, there is an ongoing controversy on the usefulness of the 
HADS. Some studies show it to be equally good in detecting anxiety and depression as the 
widely used Brief-PHQ(34) and better than another widely used scale the General Health 
Questionnaire (GHQ)(34, 35). The 2002 update to a literature review on the HADS validity, 
including 747 research papers, concluded that it performs well in assessing symptom severity 
and caseness of anxiety and depression in somatic, psychiatric and primary care patients, and 
in the general population.(36) On the other hand, the recent psychometric systematic reviews 
showed the HADS to be a measure of a state of general psychological distress rather than 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED

13 
 
unique mood states.(37, 38) Other measures may potentially more accurately report on these 
symptoms, however, it is, as yet, unclear, which questionnaire is best for depression and 
anxiety screening in IBD. To date, it is the HADS that has been used most commonly in the 
studies on IBD (39) and thus it is the scale that facilitates comparisons with previous studies. 
In any case, the controversy around the HADS’s performance had been unknown at the time 
the cohort was set up. Another limitation are annual intervals between each follow-up, which, 
while practical in the study of this size, may lead to underreporting of clinical recurrence 
events. In addition, patients themselves may underreport disease events to doctors, leading to 
further underreporting of disease activity. The cohort, while large, is not population-based 
and thus the study results may not be necessarily generalizable to the whole IBD population.  
  
CONCLUSION 
Depression (and to some degree anxiety as well) is strongly associated with clinical 
recurrence over time. It thus seems prudent to recommend that screening for common mental 
disorders and referring for psychological/psychiatric treatment should be included in standard 
IBD care. Whether this improves patient outcomes and is cost-effective remains to be 
established. Studies in other populations do not always support the value of routine screening 
particularly in primary care,(40)  though populations with chronic conditions or with a history 
of depression or other mental health problems may benefit from such screening.(41) As 
occurrence of depression appears to shorten the time to a clinical recurrence event, resulting 
in flares and complications, and thus, consequently, a more aggressive treatment, prevention 
and early detection of depression could potentially reduce not only individual patient’s 
suffering, but also healthcare costs. Stepped care or collaborative care models might facilitate 
this,(42) and their efficacy has been investigated in the context of IBD, with encouraging 
results.(43-45)
