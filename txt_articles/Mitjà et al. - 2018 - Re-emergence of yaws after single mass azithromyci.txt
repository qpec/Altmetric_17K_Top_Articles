ABSTRACT 
31 
Background 
32 
Yaws is a substantial cause of chronic disfiguring ulcers in children in at least 14 countries in the 
33 
tropics. WHO’s newly adopted strategy for yaws eradication employs a single round of mass 
34 
azithromycin treatment followed by targeted treatment programs, and data from pilot studies have 
35 
shown a short-term significant reduction of yaws. We assessed the long-term efficacy of the WHO 
36 
strategy for yaws eradication. 
37 
 
38 
Methods 
39 
Between April 15, 2013, and Oct 24, 2016, we did a longitudinal study on a Papua New Guinea island 
40 
(Lihir; 16092 population) in which yaws was endemic. In the initial study, the participants were 
41 
followed for 12 months; in this extended follow-up study, clinical, serological, and PCR surveys were 
42 
continued every 6 months for 42 months. We used genotyping and travel history to identify 
43 
importation events. Active yaws confirmed by PCR specific for Treponema pallidum was the primary-
44 
outcome indicator. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01955252. 
45 
 
46 
Findings 
47 
Mass azithromycin treatment (coverage rate of 84%) followed by targeted treatment programs 
48 
reduced the prevalence of active yaws from 1·8% to a minimum of 0·1% at 18 months (difference 
49 
from baseline, -1·7%, 95% CI, -1.9 to -1.4; P<0·0001), but the infection began to re-emerge after 24 
50 
months with a significant increase to 0·4% at 42 months (difference from 18 months, 0·3%, 95% CI 
51 
0.1 to 0.4; P<0·0001). At each time point after baseline, > 70% of the total community burden of 
52 
yaws was found in persons who had not had the mass treatment or as new infections in non-
53 
travelling residents. At months 36 and 42, five cases of active yaws, all from the same village, 
54 
demonstrated clinical failure following azithromycin treatment, with PCR detected mutations in the 
55 
23S ribosomal RNA genes conferring resistance to azithromycin. A sustained  decrease in the 
56 
prevalence of high titre latent yaws from 13.7% to <1.5% in asymptomatic children aged 1–5 years 
57 
old and of genetic diversity of yaws strains from 0·139 to  <0·046 between 24 and 42 months 
58 
indicated a reduction in transmission of infection. 
59 
 
60 
Interpretation 
61 
The implementation of the WHO strategy did not, in the long-term, achieve elimination in a high-
62 
endemic community mainly due to the individuals who were absent at the time of mass treatment in 
63 
whom yaws reactivated; repeated mass treatment might be necessary to eliminate yaws. To our 
64 
knowledge this is the first report of the emergence of azithromycin-resistant T. p. pertenue and 
65 
spread within one village. Communities’ surveillance should be strengthened to detect any possible 
66 
treatment failure and biological markers of resistance.

Panel 1. Research in context 
73 
Evidence before this study 
74 
We searched PubMed on Feb 17, 2017 for studies published in English using the search terms 
75 
“yaws”, “Treponema pallidum”, “mass treatment”, “azithromycin”, and “penicillin”. We searched for 
76 
studies that assessed the efficacy of mass azithromycin treatment for yaws. Empirical data on the 
77 
short-term impact of the WHO strategy became available after the start of this study; a single round 
78 
of mass treatment in communities with high baseline infection rates in Ghana and Solomon Islands 
79 
resulted in a significant decrease in prevalence of active and latent yaws at 12 and 18 months after 
80 
treatment, respectively. The quality of the evidence was low, comprising primarily small sample size 
81 
cross-sectional studies. Moreover, previous experience in the 1950s using mass treatment with 
82 
penicillin and recent mathematical modelling suggested that, after an initial reduction, the disease 
83 
may persist or rebound to pre-mass treatment amounts. 
84 
 
85 
Added value of this study 
86 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the long-term efficacy of the modern WHO 
87 
strategy for yaws eradication. We repeatedly examined a community of about 16,000 people and 
88 
used PCR analysis specific to Treponema pallidum to determine the prevalence of active disease over 
89 
42 months. Through this approach we were able to accurately measure the prevalence of active 
90 
yaws and detect the appearance of macrolide-resistant strains. We used a novel genotyping method 
91 
to determine temporal changes on genetic diversity of T. p. pertenue strains and to identify 
92 
importation events. 
93 
 
94 
Implications of all the available evidence 
95 
Active and latent yaws can be cured with single-dose azithromycin treatment and a single round of 
96 
mass antibiotic treatment with coverage as high as 84% greatly reduces infection and transmission, 
97 
but does not achieve complete and permanent reduction to zero new cases, with evidence of re-
98 
emergence after 24 months. We suggest that yaws eradication policies should be revised with 
99 
consideration of expansion to repeated 6-12 monthly mass treatments for at least two-three rounds. 
100 
The data also suggest that azithromycin resistance in T. p. pertenue has emerged as a result of the 
101 
program implementation, which reveals the need for effective drug resistance monitoring as part of 
102 
yaws eradication programs to prevent spread of antibiotic-resistant strains.

INTRODUCTION 
106 
The World Health Organization (WHO) has already begun implementing a program designed to 
107 
eradicate yaws, an infectious disease caused by Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue (T p pertenue). 
108 
The global burden of yaws is substantial, with more than 89 million people living in yaws endemic 
109 
areas and 100,000 annual reported cases of chronic ulcers or papilloma that are a major physical and 
110 
psychological burden in young children. 
111 
 
112 
The cornerstone of the WHO’s strategy is the mass administration of azithromycin aiming for a 
113 
population coverage of >90%.1 The drug is well-tolerated and very effective against yaws.2,3 It is 
114 
given as one supervised dose, so compliance is assured. Treatment of all members of a yaws-
115 
endemic community, irrespective of their clinical status, allows individuals harbouring the infection 
116 
without any skin manifestation (latent infection) to be successfully exposed to curative doses of the 
117 
treatment. Clearance of the pathogen responsible for yaws from individuals with active and latent 
118 
infection, which constitute the infectious reservoir, has the potential to interrupt transmission.4 The 
119 
WHO strategy calls for the use of PCR technology to confirm the diagnosis and to monitor the 
120 
emergence of resistance to azithromycin after mass treatment.5 
121 
 
122 
A second important element of the WHO strategy to increase the effectiveness of yaws eradication 
123 
programmes is to follow mass drug administration (MDA) with active case detection surveys every 3-
124 
6 months, consisting of blanket screening to identify and treat all active yaws cases and their 
125 
contacts (often called total targeted treatment).6 This second element aims to achieve elimination 
126 
by early detection of existing (e.g. missed MDA), recurrent (e.g. relapse of untreated latent 
127 
infections), or newly introduced (e.g. crossing regional borders) active yaws cases. A third element is 
128 
a strengthened health and community system for surveillance and management of patients who 
129 
present to health care between surveys.6 
130 
 
131 
We previously reported the effect of single-dose mass azithromycin treatment, with a coverage rate 
132 
of 83·8%, on the prevalence of active and latent yaws 12 months after the intervention.7 MDA with 
133 
azithromycin was associated with a nearly 90% reduction of serologically-confirmed active yaws 
134 
from 2·4% to 0·3%. Single mass azithromycin treatment has also shown short-term efficacy in other 
135 
clinical trials in Ghana (Aziz A, West Akim District Health Administration, Eastern Region, Ghana,  
136 
personal communication) and Solomon Islands;8,9 however, the long-term efficacy of the WHO 
137 
strategy has not yet been determined. 
138 
 
139 
We now report the results of 42 months of follow-up in our study communities to assess the long-
140 
term effect of the WHO strategy to eradicate yaws.  
141 
 
142 
METHODS 
143 
Study setting and participants 
144 
Between April 15, 2013 and Oct 24, 2016, we did  a longitudinal study of yaws in the population of 
145 
Lihir Island, New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea. The characteristics of the area have been 
146 
described in detail before.7 The climate is tropical with two distinct seasons: rainy and dry seasons. 
147 
All villages of Lihir Island had a high prevalence of active yaws before MDA (range 0·5 to 3·8%).10  
148 
 
149 
We have previously reported the results of the first 12 months of follow up after MDA, in which the 
150 
primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of clinically suspected yaws with serological 
151 
confirmation of treponemal infection.7 All residents of Lihir Island have been followed during the 
152 
extended phase of this study for an additional 30 months (months 12–42). Serological methods do 
153 
not result in identification of all cases of active yaws because very early infection, while highly 
154 
infectious, can be seronegative. By contrast, participants with latent yaws can present with skin 
155 
ulcers caused by other bacteria (e.g. Haemophilus ducreyi) resulting in false-positive diagnoses of 
156 
 5 
active yaws.11-13 Consequently, throughout our study we incorporated molecular diagnostics as our 
157 
case definition of active yaws. PCR testing of ulcers allowed us to more clearly delineate the effect of 
158 
the intervention on participants with true active yaws (lesion PCR positive for T. pallidum) and on 
159 
those participants with latent yaws and a different cause of the current skin infection (i.e. positive 
160 
serology for treponemal infection but lesion PCR negative for T. pallidum). 
161 
 
162 
The initial MDA programme consisted of a centralized distribution where community members in 
163 
each village gathered in a central location and received treatment, and compliance was recorded in 
164 
treatment register books (ie, census list). After the initial MDA campaign,7 we did six monthly total 
165 
targeted  surveys in accordance with the standards advocated by WHO. Before each survey, 
166 
population sensitization was undertaken to inform village authorities of the program. Villages were 
167 
visited by a mobile team of health-care workers that first screened the village schools to examine 
168 
children, and then did house-to-house screening. All subjects with skin ulcers and their contacts 
169 
(household, frequent family friends, schoolmates, and playmates) were treated with directly 
170 
observed single-dose azithromycin (30 mg/Kg) procured by WHO from Medopharm (Chennai, India). 
171 
To simplify the treatment in the field, dosing charts were used to guide the participants’ age-based 
172 
dose. Individuals were observed for 30 minutes following treatment; if vomiting occurred within this 
173 
time period, the child was retreated. Treatment was provided without cost to participants. Clinical 
174 
follow-up examinations were conducted 2 weeks after any treatment to identify potential treatment 
175 
failures. All field workers and clinical and laboratory staff involved in the follow-up of study 
176 
participants remained masked to previous individual-specific and village-specific results. 
177 
 
178 
All participants, or their parents, provided oral informed consent for screening. In addition, we 
179 
obtained written informed consent from parents or guardians, as well as verbal agreement of the 
180 
children with clinically suspected yaws before enrolment in ulcer aetiology studies and serological 
181 
surveys. The protocol was approved by the National Medical Research Advisory Committee of the 
182 
PNG Ministry of Health (MRAC no 12·36). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
183 
NTC01955252. 
184 
 
185 
Procedures 
186 
Clinical surveys were undertaken in the entire resident population present at the time of the visits 
187 
for assessment of clinical signs and symptoms of active yaws at study months 18, 24, 30, 36, and 42. 
188 
We used tally sheets to record the number of people examined at total targerted treatment surveys 
189 
and a standardized form to record data of patients with suspected lesions. Specimens were collected 
190 
from the largest lesion of all subjects with ulcers or papillomas using dacron swabs (FITZCO Inc, 
191 
Minneapolis, MN, USA) that were vigorously rotated across a 1 cm2 area and then placed into a tube 
192 
containing transport medium as previously described.7 At the baseline and 6-month surveys we 
193 
swabbe a systematic random sample of 90 and 84 ulcers. The specimens were forwarded to the 
194 
University of Washington laboratory (Seattle, WA, USA) for PCR testing. The number of active yaws 
195 
cases in the entire population was estimated using the proportion of PCR-positive specimens among 
196 
the subset of PCR-tested lesions multiplied by the total number of detected lesions. In 12-month to 
197 
42-month surveys, we swabbed to test all ulcers detected; therefore we obtained a direct 
198 
measurement of the number of yaws cases in the entire population.  
199 
 
200 
Laboratory methods used to confirm yaws and to detect macrolide-resistance mutations have been 
201 
previously described.11,14 In short, three T. pallidum gene targets, tp0548, tpN47 (tp0574), and a 
202 
pertenue-specific region of the tprL (tp1031) gene were PCR amplified to detect the presence of T. 
203 
pallidum DNA and to confirm the subspecies. We used previously described restriction fragment 
204 
length polymorphism methods to detect A2058G14 and A2059G15 point mutations in both copies of 
205 
the 23S ribosomal RNA genes. We did strain genotyping by sequencing a panel of three molecular 
206 
markers (tp0548, tp0136 and tp0326)16 to determine the genetic diversity of T. p. pertenue 
207 
 6 
infections and to identify importation events. The aggregated molecular typing of strains causing 
208 
incident infection in Lihir Island has been reported in a paper16 detailing the development of the 
209 
typing system. 
210 
 
211 
Significant reductions in transmission intensity are required to reduce the diversity of bacterial 
212 
populations; hence we used genetic diversity as a marker for transmission. We used PCR targeting 
213 
the 16S rRNA gene to identify H. ducreyi.17 Participants with lesions underwent serological testing 
214 
using both qualitative Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) and T. pallidum haemagglutination assay (TPHA); 
215 
specimens which tested dually positive were analysed with the quantitative RPR. 
216 
 
217 
Demographic and epidemiologic data were systematically collected for every case of ulcer detected. 
218 
Compliance with yaws MDA therapy was assessed by self-reported data and verified using the 
219 
treatment register books for MDA (ie, census lists). Travel history was assessed by self-reported 
220 
travel out of Lihir Island to a yaws endemic area in the preceding 6 months, regardless of compliance 
221 
to MDA. History of in-migration was assessed by self-reported migration to Lihir Island in the 
222 
preceding 6 months and verified by non-appearance at the previous year census, regardless of 
223 
compliance to MDA. 
224 
 
225 
Serological surveys to detect latent yaws in a subgroup of asymptomatic children 1–15 years old 
226 
were done at months 18, 24, 30, 36, and 42 after MDA. We selected six villages using computer-
227 
generated random numbers, and all children within the age group were recruited for inclusion. We 
228 
regenerated the random sample at each survey; therefore different villages may have been selected 
229 
for testing in different rounds. Venous blood samples were collected from assenting children for 
230 
TPHA and qualitative and quantitative RPR testing. 
231 
 
232 
Outcomes and statistical analysis 
233 
The primary outcome indicator to assess the prevalence of infection was the frequency of 
234 
participants with active yaws lesions confirmed by PCR (regardless of their serology result), which 
235 
was assessed by examining everyone in the population. Secondary outcome indicators included 
236 
prevalence of participants with an ulcer who were serologically positive (regardless of PCR result). To 
237 
control for potential confounders of infection persistence we looked at the proportion of post-MDA 
238 
new incident yaws cases that had missed MDA therapy, the proportion of yaws cases that originated 
239 
from travel versus local residual source according to travel history and genotyping results, and the 
240 
proportion of yaws samples with genetic mutations associated with macrolide resistance at each 
241 
timepoint. Secondary outcome indicators that were used to assess onward transmission of infection 
242 
were the prevalence of latent yaws with high-titre seroreactivity (RPR ≥1:16) in a subset of children 
243 
aged 1-5 years old in villages selected using computer generated random numbers, and the genetic 
244 
diversity of T. p. pertenue isolates from active yaws lesions. 
245 
 
246 
We estimated the prevalence ratiofor comparison of active yaws at seven time-points using a log-
247 
binomial regression model. The model accounted for the uncertainty in the estimate of number of 
248 
active yaws cases at baseline. We estimated the adjusted prevalence ratio of high-titre latent yaws 
249 
using the cluster option in the models to account for the variability between clusters selected for 
250 
serosurveys. Analyses were done using Stata (version 13·1). To measure the genetic diversity of T. p. 
251 
pertenue isolates at each round we estimated the Mean Evolutionary Diversity by calculating the 
252 
number of base substitutions per site for each round using the Kimura 2 parameter model in MEGA 
253 
(version 7).18 We determined significant differences among years using one-way ANOVA. 
254 
 
255 
We initially calculated that a sample size of 1000 children would be needed at 24-42 months to 
256 
estimate the prevalence of high-titre latent yaws with a precision of 0·83%, at a two-sided 
257 
significance level of 5% in a finite population of 6600 children 1-15 years old. We assumed that the 
258 
 7 
prevalence of latent yaws at 24-42 months would be 2%. However, we adjusted the sample size to 
259 
reduce survey fatigue by the survey team and to minimize venipuncture of children; the revised 
260 
calculations indicated that 500 children was enough to estimate prevalence with a precision of 
261 
1·18%.  
262 
 
263 
RESULTS 
264 
The study population lives in the 28 villages of Lihir Island; in small subsistence farming communities 
265 
with a mean population of 575 (SD 225) people per village. At baseline 16,092 people lived in the 
266 
area, and a total of 13,490 individuals (83·8%) received single-dose azithromycin (or benzathine 
267 
benzylpenicillin if azithromycin was contraindicated). Total population size remained fairly stable 
268 
throughout the study, and a mean proportion of 79·0% (SD 8·2) of the population was examined at 
269 
each survey (Table 1). Some individuals could not be reached at scheduled visit times (e.g. children 
270 
were absent from school, adults were working in the fields, families had moved away on temporary 
271 
or permanent basis).  
272 
The overall prevalence of active yaws fell from an estimated 1·8% before MDA to a minimum of 0·1% 
273 
at 18 months (difference from baseline, -1·7%; 95%CI, -1·9 to -1·4; P<0·0001), but began to re-
274 
emerge from 30 months onwards (table 1). The prevalence increased to 0·4% at 42 months 
275 
(difference from 18 months, 0·3%; 95%CI, 0·1 to 0·4; P<0·0001), with a major rise from 36 to 42 
276 
months (table 1). Similarly, the prevalence of participants with clinically suspected yaws lesions and 
277 
positive serological findings fell initially, but the prevalence appeared to increaseby month 30 (table 
278 
1). We noted anincrease from a minimum of 0·2% at 24 months to 0·5% at 42 months (difference, 
279 
0·3%; 95CI, 0·1 to 0·4; P<0·0001).  
280 
 
281 
Overall, 239 participants were PCR positive for T. pallidum throughout the study, including 31 (13%) 
282 
at baseline and 208 (87%) in total in the period after MDA. At each survey after MDA, between 36% 
283 
and 61% of the community burden of newly identified active yaws were accounted for by non-
284 
travelling residents who had been absent at initial mass treatment visit (figure-1). Non-travelling 
285 
residents who were present at MDA ranged from 27% to 53%, and migrants and residents who had 
286 
travelled to a yaws endemic area after MDA represented 28% of cases at each timepoint (figure 1).  
287 
 
288 
We report  the temporal variation of the genetic diversity over the 42-month study (figure 1). At 
289 
baseline, three molecular types were identified, with strain JG8 accounting for ten (58·8%) of 17 fully 
290 
typable samples (figure 1).  Over time, molecular type diversity was reduced to zero (only one 
291 
genotype –JG8– was present) at 24 months which represented a reduction of the mean evolutionary 
292 
diversity of T. p. pertenue from 0·139 to 0·000 (P<0·0001; figure 1). Diversity remained low (<0.046) 
293 
thereafter (figure 1). After 24 months, strain JG8 caused all 76 new incident cases of yaws in non-
294 
travelling patients with typable samples, and 18 (72%) of 25 cases in travelling patients. The 
295 
remaining seven cases (28%) who had a history of travel or migration were infected with genotypes 
296 
SE7 or SD6, which supports that these cases were imported and not derived from a local source.  
297 
 
298 
When we looked at the proportion of participants with a history of travel according to genotypes 
299 
(table 2), all TD6, TG6, and JD8, as well as 84% of JG8 specimens were seen in patients who had not 
300 
travelled; all SD6 and TG8 strains, and 82% of SE7 occurred in patients who travelled or migrated. 
301 
 
302 
Of 31 active yaws cases tested at baseline, the 23S rRNA gene could be amplified by PCR in 24 cases 
303 
(77%); all had wild type 23S rRNA sequence at positions 2058 and 2059 (figure 1). Of 208 PCR-
304 
confirmed cases of active yaws in the period after MDA, the 23S rRNA gene could be amplified by 
305 
PCR in 186 (89%), of which 181 (97%) had wild-type strains, but two cases (1%) at 36 months and 
306 
three cases (2%) at 42 months revealed A2059G mutations associated with macrolide-resistance. 
307 
The five samples had A2059G mutations in both of the 23S rRNA loci (figure 1). 
308 
 
309

The index case was an 11-year old boy who was diagnosed with active yaws at the 30-month survey 
310 
(lesional swab was PCR-positive for T. p. pertenue with wild-type 23S rRNA),treated with a full dose 
311 
of azithromycin 1.5 g without vomiting the medication, and shower clinical improvement 2 weeks 
312 
after medication (figure 2). The patient was seen 6 months later with recurrent papillomatous 
313 
lesions (figure 2) and serological treatment failure. The skin biopsy of these lesions showed 
314 
abundant spirochetes (figure 2 ) and T. p. pertenue containing the 23S rRNA A2059G macrolide 
315 
resistance mutation was identified by PCR. The patient was treated with 2.4 MUI of benzathine 
316 
benzylpenicillin and showed clinical cure after 2 weeks and serological cure after 6 months. 
317 
 
318 
The other four cases of antibiotic-resistant infection, diagnosed at 36 months (one case) and 42 
319 
months (three cases), were 9-14 year old boys who lived in the same village as the index case 
320 
(related to or friends of the index case); they had not travelled outside the village. All of them 
321 
reported no oral antibiotic-treatment other than that received during MDA. All presented with 
322 
worsening skin lesions 2-weeks after azithromycin treatment and were subsequently treated with 
323 
benzathine benzylpenicillin, according to age (1.2 MU for <10 years old and 2.4 MU for ≥10 years 
324 
old).  All strains with A2059G mutations were molecular type JG8, the most common type on Lihir 
325 
Island. 
326 
The prevalence of high titre latent yaws in children aged 1–5 years fell from 14% before MDA to 1% 
327 
at 12 months (P=0·0005)7 and remained lower than 2% at each timepoint thereafter. No participant 
328 
aged 1-5 years of age had high titre latent yaws infection at 30 or 42 months (Table 3). Decreases in 
329 
this index were also observed in the older age group of 6–15 years. The decrease from baseline to 12 
330 
months was significant (P<0·0001). 7 At 18, 24, 36, and 42 months, the prevalence of high titre latent 
331 
yaws infection remained significantly lower that it had been before mass treatment, although in 
332 
each instance it was not significantly below that recorded for the previous round (table 3). 
333 
 
334 
Regarding the proportion of ulcers due to T. p. pertenue and H. ducreyi, the baseline and 12 months  
335 
after treatment results for PCR in detecting the causal agents have been previously described.7 The 
336 
proportion of subjects that had detectable T. p. pertenue DNA (either alone or co-infection with H. 
337 
ducreyi) was lower at 12 (p=0.0030), 18 (p=0.023), and 24 (p=0.033) than it had been at baseline, but 
338 
it increased to a similar proportion as baseline by month 30 (p=0.176; appendix);although, the 
339 
overall prevalence of lesions remained much lower than baseline. The proportion of ulcers due to H. 
340 
ducreyi remained relatively stable during the 42 months of follow up (appendix). 
341 
 
342 
DISCUSSION 
343 
In our study, we found that one mass administration of antibiotics followed by targeted treatment of 
344 
symptomatic cases and their contacts caused a transient sharp decline on infection levels and 
345 
transmission, but did not eliminate yaws in a highly endemic island community. To our knowledge, 
346 
this is the largest studythat evaluates a yaws eradication program with oral antibiotics and with a 
347 
long, 42-month follow-up. The initial impact of a single-dose treatment with oral azithromycin was a 
348 
large reduction in prevalence of active yaws, similar to the findings subsequently described for 
349 
Ghana and Solomon Islands.8-9 The maximum impact of the intervention in this study was observed 
350 
by the end of the second year, but thereafter the overall prevalence of yaws increased with many 
351 
children presenting active yaws lesions in all villages. When we did molecular typing of T. p. pertenue 
352 
samples from Lihir, we found a great reduction in genetic diversity of the circulating strains over 
353 
time, which reached a minimum at 24 months when only one genotype was present. A reduction in 
354 
genetic diversity and in seroreactivity of children 1-5 years old indicated an overall reduction in 
355 
transmission, and hence the susceptibility of the bacteria population to the MDA intervention.  
356 
 
357 
The relapse of untreated latent infections was the most important factor that hindered elimination 
358 
efforts in this community, along with, to a lesser extent, the reintroduction of yaws throughcases of 
359 
in-migration. Almost half of the individuals with new infections at follow-up surveys had not been 
360 
 9 
present for MDA. Although we had not evaluated baseline serostatus for these children (because it 
361 
was impractical and impossible for financial reasons to assess the baseline serrostatus of everyone 
362 
on the entire island), given the high prevalence of seropositivity of about 30% in randomly selected 
363 
children at baseline, the active yaws episode was likely to be due to relapsed latent yaws. This 
364 
finding is significant because it highlights the importance of achieving high initial treatment coverage 
365 
of all persons to be sure of treating latent cases. Results of studies done in the 1950s indicate that 
366 
because of the tendency of latent yaws to relapse early in the course of untreated infection, it is 
367 
critical to treat latent infections as part of eradication efforts.19-21 In addition, results of a 
368 
mathematical model predict that >65% coverage of latent cases is required during each total 
369 
targeted treatment program to achieve eradication;22 however, contact tracingis unlikely to detect 
370 
this proportion of latently infected individuals. Given the high coverage requirements for latent 
371 
cases, and the relatively high fixed-costs of reaching endemic communities when compared to the 
372 
relatively low costs of generic azithromycin, doing multiple rounds of MDA before the switch to total 
373 
targeted treatment may be prefereable. Determination of the optimal number of MDA rounds to 
374 
achieve eradication, the best intervals between rounds, and suitable interventions to prevent 
375 
repeated non-attendance at MDA will require careful examination. 
376 
 
377 
Importantly, we report the first documented macrolide resistance in T. p. pertenue infections. 
378 
Analysis of five clinical specimens from 208 samples tested during the 42 month period after MDA, 
379 
showed a T. p. pertenue strain carrying the 23S rRNA A2059G point mutation. We speculate that the 
380 
first case likely to have had a de novo drug resistance mutation; antibiotic pressure has been 
381 
associated with selection of mutants in syphilis studies.23 A direct epidemiological association was 
382 
present among all patients who had macrolide-resistant yaws suggesting that all had been infected 
383 
with a single macrolide-resistant strain resulting from direct transmission by the index case; hence 
384 
there was local spread of the resistant clone. The selection of the resistance mutation is likely to be a 
385 
result of the yaws eradication programme implementation because azithromycin was used in these 
386 
communities (after MDA) only for targeted treatment of yaws and to treat urethritis and genital 
387 
ulcer disease in adults. For the syphilis agent, Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, the increase in 
388 
prevalence of macrolide resistant strains has been rapid up to 64-100% in some developed 
389 
countries.24-28 However, whether this increase in prevalence is due to de novo point mutations or 
390 
spread of a resistant strain, or both, is unclear. 14 In syphilis, macrolide-resistance mutations have 
391 
been found in many different molecular strain types, consistent with de novo mutation. The 
392 
frequency of emergence of primary resistance is proposed to be low because T. pallidum has two 
393 
copies of the 23s rRNA gene and mutations in both operons seem to be required;29 in all five mutant 
394 
samples from our study, the same mutation A2059G, was found in both copies of the 23S rRNA 
395 
gene. However, Treponema denticola (a related spirochete) can have phenotypic resistance with a 
396 
mutation in only a single allele.30 The role of dissemination of a single resistant strain in increased 
397 
prevalence is not well defined for syphilis, as network analyses have not been performed. For yaws, 
398 
travel of individuals is restricted in endemic countries, and the risk of spread from one country to 
399 
another may be minimal. Emergence of macrolide-resistant strains, however, might cause local 
400 
outbreaks. 
401 
 
402 
The strengths of this study are the use of PCR to conclusively diagnose active yaws and the use of 
403 
genotyping to differentiate between indigenous and imported cases. Additionally, the clinical 
404 
surveys involved the entire population of interest, which is important to accurately measure a 
405 
reduction of infection levels to zero because of the focal nature of the disease. A limitation of this 
406 
study is the sampling of ulcers for PCR testing used in the first two rounds. Our aim was to swab a 
407 
systematic sample of all observed ulcers, but this approach was not fully implemented in all villages. 
408 
However, we believe that any association that might exist between the probability that an ulcer was 
409 
swabbed and the probability that an ulcer was PCR positive is slight enough that it would not 
410 
compromise the conclusions of the paper. Another limitation is the smaller than anticipated sample 
411 
 10 
size in latent infection surveys. This might have reduced the power of our study to show definitively 
412 
whether transmission of yaws had ceased (i.e. infection in children 1-5 years indicates recent 
413 
infection). However, the finding of zero cases of high titre latent yaws in repeated surveys, together 
414 
with results showing an overall reduced genetic diversity of strains causing active yaws, strongly 
415 
indicates that transmission was largely interrupted.  
416 
 
417 
The generalizability of our findings is subject to three factors. First, rural Papua New Guinea might 
418 
differ from other high-endemic zones in important environmental or cultural characteristics; 
419 
however most yaws is found in rural tropical settings. Second, the impact of importation of infection 
420 
could be larger in communities that are geographically contiguous to neighbouring areas where the 
421 
disease is also endemic than in isolated island communities. Third, if the high coverage we achieved 
422 
in MDA and subsequent total targeted treatment programs cannot be attained, as might be the case 
423 
outside a research setting, re-emergence of disease could happen more rapidly. 
424 
 
425 
Our findings have substantial implications for the scalability of yaws eradication programs 
426 
internationally and support the following adaptations to the current WHO strategy. First, a 
427 
considerable effort to achieve coverage rates >90% should be the goal in the first round of 
428 
treatment.  Second, distribution of a second or third round of azithromycin at 6-12 months intervals 
429 
might be of substantial benefit. Third, efforts to eradicate yaws should aim to treat much broader 
430 
geographical areas, especially in regions with substantial migration. Finally, clinical and biological 
431 
surveillance needs to immediately detect drug resistance through the strengthening of capacities of 
432 
laboratory networks in endemic countries. Because the identified macrolide resistance mutations 
433 
appear to cause no fitness disadvantage in T. pallidum, resistant strains would likely persist in 
434 
communities even in the absence of antibiotic pressure. Therefore, communities where significant 
435 
resistance is identified will need guidelines for clinical and operational management of macrolide 
436 
resistant yaws with benzathine benzylpenicillin treatment to achieve cure and to avoid 
437 
dissemination of resistant strains.

*Active yaws refers to the estimated number of participants with lesional PCR positive results in either tpN47 (tp0574) or tp0548, and in which the 
pertenue subspecies was confirmed by TprL PCR amplicon size. 
†The prevalence ratio was calculated by means of the log-binomial model. The baseline prevalence is the reference value.  
‡ P<0.0001 for the significance of the model overall. 
§ At baseline, a random sample of 90 (out of 690) clinically suspected yaws lesions were tested by PCR; the number of active yaws cases in the entire 
population were estimated using the proportion of PCR-positive specimens among the subset of PCR-tested lesions (34·4% [31/90]) multiplied by the total 
number of clinically suspected yaws lesions detected (n 690).  
¶ At 6 months, the same approach as taken for baseline was used to estimate the number of active yaws cases. The proportion of PCR-positive specimens 
(48·8% [41/84]) was multiplied by the total number of clinically suspected yaws lesions detected (n 121). 
ǁ In 12-month to 42-month surveys, we tested all clinically suspicious lesions by PCR; therefore we obtained a direct measurement of the number of active 
yaws cases in the entire population.  
Baseline, 6, and 12 month data were previously published (Ref. 7) and are included here for comparison to later time points.
