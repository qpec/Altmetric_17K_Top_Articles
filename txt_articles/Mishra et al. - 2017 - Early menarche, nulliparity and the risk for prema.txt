STUDY QUESTION: Are parity and the timing of menarche associated with premature and early natural menopause?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Early menarche (≤11 years) is a risk factor for both premature menopause (final menstrual period, FMP <40 years)
and early menopause (FMP 40–44 years), a risk that is amplified for nulliparous women.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Women with either premature or early menopause face an increased risk of chronic conditions in later
life and of early death. Findings from some studies suggest that early menarche and nulliparity are associated with early menopause, however
overall the evidence is mixed. Much of the evidence for a direct relationship is hampered by a lack of comparability across studies, failure to
adjust for confounding factors and inadequate statistical power.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This pooled study comprises 51 450 postmenopausal women from nine observational studies in
the UK, Scandinavia, Australia and Japan that contribute to the International collaboration for a Life course Approach to reproductive health
and Chronic disease Events (InterLACE).
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Age at menarche (categorized as ≤11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 or more years) and
parity (categorized as no children, one child and two or more children) were exposures of interest. Age at FMP was confirmed by at least 12
months of cessation of menses where this was not the result of an intervention (such as surgical menopause due to bilateral oophorectomy
or hysterectomy) and categorized as premature menopause (FMP before age 40), early menopause (FMP 40–44 years), 45–49 years, 50–51

 years, 52–53 years and 54 or more years. We used multivariate multinomial logistic regression models to estimate relative risk ratio (RRR)
and 95% CI for associations between menarche, parity and age at FMP adjusting for within-study correlation.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The median age at FMP was 50 years (interquartile range 48–53 years), with 2% of
the women experiencing premature menopause and 7.6% early menopause. Women with early menarche (≤11 years, compared with 12–13
years) were at higher risk of premature menopause (RRR 1.80, 95% CI 1.53–2.12) and early menopause (1.31, 1.19–1.44). Nulliparity was
associated with increased risk of premature menopause (2.26, 1.84–2.77) and early menopause (1.32, 1.09–1.59). Women having early
menarche and nulliparity were at over 5-fold increased risk of premature menopause (5.64, 4.04–7.87) and 2-fold increased risk of early
menopause (2.16, 1.48–3.15) compared with women who had menarche at ≥12 years and two or more children.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Most of the studies (except the birth cohorts) relied on retrospectively reported age at
menarche, which may have led to some degree of recall bias.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings support early monitoring of women with early menarche, especially those
who have no children, for preventive health interventions aimed at mitigating the risk of adverse health outcomes associated with early
menopause.

Introduction
Women are usually defined as having ‘early menopause’ if they experi-
ence their final menstrual period (FMP) between the ages 40–44 years,
which is well before the median age of natural menopause of 51 years
for Western countries (North American Menopause Society, 2007).
Women diagnosed with ‘premature ovarian failure’ failure following
extended amenorrhoea, hypergonadotropinemia or oestrogen defi-
ciency (Nippita and Baber, 2007) may experience menopause before
the age of 40 and are usually classified as having ‘premature menopause’
(Shuster et al., 2010). These categories for the timing of natural meno-
pause are distinct from when cessation of menses has occurred as a
result of medical interventions, such as chemotherapy or bilateral
oophorectomy (sometimes referred to as surgical menopause).
Women with either premature or early menopause face increased
risk of early death and are more likely to suffer from chronic conditions
in later life, including cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and
osteoporosis (Gold, 2011; Muka et al., 2016).
Numerous factors influence the timing of the menopause, from gen-
etic and developmental factors to the cumulative effects of hormonal,
environmental and lifestyle exposures. For instance, a mother’s age at
menopause is correlated with her daughter’s age at menopause (van
Asselt et al., 2004; Forman et al., 2013; He and Murabito, 2014); higher
parity is associated with older age at menopause (Gold, 2011); and
smoking and teetotalism are established risk factors for younger age at
menopause (Gold, 2011; Schoenaker et al., 2014; Taneri et al., 2016).
Early menarche is suggested to be associated with the early meno-
pause. However, studies that have examined the links between the tim-
ing of menarche and the age at FMP show mixed findings (Hardy and
Kuh, 1999; Gold, 2011; Farahmand et al., 2013). Much of the evidence
for a direct relationship is hampered by a lack of comparability across
studies, including definitional differences of FMP, and lack of adjustment
for confounding factors (Gold, 2011; Forman et al., 2013). Lack of stat-
istical power also remains a key issue (Nippita and Baber, 2007).
This study used data from over 50 000 postmenopausal women
from populations in the UK, Scandinavia, Australia and Japan to exam-
ine associations between the age at menarche and parity with prema-
ture menopause and early menopause, while taking into account a
range of potential confounding factors. To achieve this objective, we
pooled participant-level data from selected studies that contribute to
the International collaboration for a Life course Approach to repro-
ductive health and Chronic disease Events (InterLACE) (Mishra et al.,
2013, 2016).
Materials and Methods
Ethics
Each study in the InterLACE has been undertaken with ethical approval
from the institutional review boards at each participating institution, and all
participants provided written informed consent.
Study participants
InterLACE has brought together 20 observational, mostly longitudinal
cohort studies with data on women’s health. A more detailed description
of the InterLACE collaboration has been published previously (Mishra
et al., 2013, 2016). Participating studies collected prospective as well as
retrospective self-reported survey data on key reproductive, sociodemo-
graphic and lifestyle variables. For these analyses, studies were included
only if their criteria for sample selection were not based on the meno-
pausal status of the women and data collection included information on
the key variables of interest for this analysis, such as age at menarche and
age at menopause. The resultant nine studies used for pooling data at the
individual level were Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health
(ALSWH) (Lee et al., 2005), Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study
(MCCS) (Giles and English, 2002), MRC National Survey of Health and

 Cohort Study (UKWCS) (Cade et al., 2015), Women’s Lifestyle and
Health Study (WLHS) (Roswall et al., 2015), Danish Nurse Cohort Study
(DNCS) (Hundrup et al., 2012) and the Japan Nurses’ Health Study
(JNHS) (Hayashi et al., 2007). The pooled study sample consisted of
51 450 women who had reported their FMP and had complete information
on the covariates used.
Main outcome and exposure variables
Age at FMP was confirmed by at least 12 months of cessation of menses
where this was not the result of an intervention (such as surgical meno-
pause due to bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy). If the age at FMP
was reported multiple times, data reported at the last available survey
were used. Using established age at FMP categories for premature and
early menopause, the timing of the FMP were classified as premature
menopause (before age 40), early menopause (40–44 years), 45–49 years,
50–51 years, 52–53 years and 54 or more years. Age at menarche (cate-
gorized as ≤11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 or more years) and parity (categorized
as no children, one child and two or more children) were exposure of
interest after adjusting for other covariates.
Covariates
The following sociodemographic and lifestyle factors reported at baseline
surveys (or at mid age surveys for the birth cohorts) were included in the
analysis as covariates: education level (≤10 years, 11–12 years and >12
years),
marital
status
(married
or
partnered,
separated/divorced/
widowed and never married/single), smoking status (never smokers, past
smokers and current smokers), BMI (<25, 25–30 and ≥30 kg/m2) and
year of birth (born before 1940, between 1940 and 1949 and between
1950 and 1969).
Statistical analysis
Multinomial (polytomous) logistic regression model with five categories of
outcome for FMP <40, 40–44, 45–49, 50–51, 52–53 and 54+ years was
used to examine the associations between age at menarche and parity
with age at FMP adjusted for the covariates mentioned above. Age at FMP
of 50–51 was used as a reference category for the outcome, and the
regression model was adjusted for birth year, education, smoking status,
BMI and marital status as categorical covariates. Categorized variables for
age at menarche and parity were first analysed as independent exposure
variables and relative risk ratios (RRRs) and 95% CI associated with menar-
che and parity were estimated separately for each FMP category with age
50–51 as the reference, corresponding to a generalized logit model.
Furthermore, to understand whether the joint effect of early menarche
and nulliparity on early menopause were simply additive or had a synergis-
tic effect, we included an interaction term between the two exposures in
the model and analysed their combined effects. For the combined variable,
age at menarche was dichotomized as early (≤11) versus all other (12 or
more) and combined with three levels of parity, resulting in six categories
in total and the combination of later menarche (menarche age ≥12) and
having two or more children was used as a reference category. The higher
order categories for age at menarche were collapsed since there were no
significant differences in their estimated effects. The SURVEYLOGISTIC
procedure (SAS Institute Inc, 2008.) in SAS Version 9.4 was used for the
multinomial logistic regression, with the generalized logit link that estimates
sampling errors based on the clustered sample survey from multiple stud-
ies and incorporates that in the estimates. All tests of statistical hypothesis
were done at the two-sided 5% of significance. We also performed study-
specific regression and random-effect meta-analysis to estimate the
between-study heterogeneity in the effect size estimates.
Results
Study characteristics
There were 51 450 women who have reported their age at FMP and
also had complete data on the covariates. Most women were born
before 1960, with two-thirds born between 1930 and 1949 (Table I).
The mean age at menarche (Table II) was 13.2 years (median 13
years, range 8–20 years), with 14.1% of the women having early
menarche (age 11 or less). Three-quarters of the women had two or
more children, while 11% had one child and 12% remained nullipar-
ous. Across studies, the prevalence of nulliparity varied from 8.2%
(ALSWH) to 20.1% (DNCS). Mean age at FMP (Table III) was 49.9
years (median 50, interquartile range 48–53 years). Overall, 2% of
the women experienced premature menopause (ranging across stud-
ies from 1% for the DNCS and NSHD to 3.6% for UKWCS), with a
further 7.6% having early menopause (ranging from 4.9% for NSHD
and JNHS to 9.4% for MCCS). Although women with premature
menopause had a mean age at FMP of 36.5 years (SD: 2.5) and
median 37.0 (IQR: 35.0, 39.0), two-thirds (68%) had more than one
child (results not shown).
Menarche, parity and FMP
Both the timing of menarche and parity were independently associated
with age at the FMP and adjusting for confounders or mutual adjust-
ment made no significant difference to their effect estimates. The esti-
mated RRRs for menarche and parity for various age at FMP groups,
after mutual adjustment and adjustment for study and confounders
(birth year, education level, marital status, smoking status, and BMI)
are presented in Table IV. Compared with those who had menarche
at age 13 years, women with early menarche had almost twice the
relative risk of experiencing premature menopause (RRR 1.80, 95% CI
1.53–2.12) and 31% higher risk of early menopause (RRR 1.31, 1.19–
1.44). Similarly, compared with women with two or more children,
nulliparous women had over twice the risk of experiencing premature
menopause (RRR 2.26, 1.84–2.77), 32% higher risk for experiencing
early menopause (RRR 1.32, 1.09–1.59) and 13% higher risk of having
menopause at age 45–49 (RRR 1.13, 1.03–1.23).
Combined exposure of early menarche and
nulliparity
There was a significant interaction between age at menarche and parity
associated with age at the FMP (P < 0.0001). The combination of having
both early menarche and no children was associated with five times the
relative risk of premature menopause (RRR 5.64, 4.04–7.87) and twice
the risk of early menopause (RRR 2.16, 1.48–3.15), compared with the
reference group (women with menarche at age 12 or later who had
two or more children). The increased risks for premature and early
menopause were also statistically significant for the combination of hav-
ing early menarche and only one child (Fig. 1) but to a lesser extent.
Meanwhile, nulliparous women with early menarche were also at
slightly increased risk of having FMP later than age 51 years.
Meta-analysis
Of the nine studies, six had sufficient data to contribute to the study-
specific analysis. Random-effect meta-analysis of the estimates from

 the six studies observed a pooled RRR estimate of 4.71 (95% CI
2.81–7.90) for the combined association of early menarche and nulli-
parity with premature menopause, with no significant heterogeneity
between studies (test for heterogeneity P = 0.20, I2 = 31.9%) in
the effect estimate (Fig. 2). The estimated effect size was much
larger for JNHS compared with all other studies. When the JNHS
was excluded, the combined effect was attenuated slightly to 3.75
(95% CI 2.46–5.72).

This study included all women who had complete data on education, BMI, smoking and marital status at the baseline.
aIn WLHS, marital status was only recorded from mothers’ birth registry, thus the data were missing for all women who did not give birth. The distribution of parity for WLHS pro-
vided in the table is for all women in the study instead of those with complete data on marital status (i.e. the sample used for analysis). Q1—25th percentile, Q3—75th percentile.

 Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale multinational study that
has found robust evidence for a number of key associations with
respect to the timing of the FMP, and particularly for premature and
early menopause. In our study, almost 1 in 10 women had premature
or early menopause. Having early menarche increased the risk of pre-
mature and early menopause by 80%, while the risk doubled for
women without children. Furthermore, the combination of early
menarche and nulliparity resulted in a 5-fold increased risk of prema-
ture menopause and twice the risk of early menopause compared with
women having later menarche and two or more children.
Our findings are consistent with previous studies that have estab-
lished the association between parity and age at natural menopause
(Dorjgochoo et al., 2008; Gold, 2011). Some individual studies included
in the InterLACE, such as JNHS (Yasui et al., 2012) and NSHD (Hardy
and Kuh, 1999), have also previously shown that nulliparity was asso-
ciated with early menopause. In contrast with previous reviews that
concluded a lack of evidence on the relationship between menarche
and menopause (Gold et al., 2001; Gold, 2011; Forman et al., 2013),
this study showed associations between early menarche and both early
and premature menopause (but no associations were evident for
late menarche and the timing of the FMP). Again these findings are con-
sistent with previous results from two individual studies (JNHS (Yasui
et al., 2011) and NSHD (Hardy and Kuh, 1999)) that were included in
the InterLACE study.
Previous studies have shown that early menarche is associated with
poor reproductive functioning, including irregular periods (Hunter,

Early menarche, nulliparity and early menopause

 1992; Mishra et al., 2009), PCOS (Ibanez et al., 2000) and a slightly
increased risk of endometriosis (Nnoaham et al., 2012). Although
some women may have used fertility controls to remain childless, par-
ity rates for the generation of women in this study should still reflect
fertility, because the childbearing years occurred when general fertility
rates were relatively high and prior to the wide availability of advanced
treatments for infertility. Further, since the majority of women with
premature menopause had their FMP between 35 and 40 years, they
had sufficient time to have children, as most did. In this study, 50% of
the women had their first child by age 25, 86% by age 30 and 97% by
age 35. It is possible, however, that reproductive decline preceded
FMP by 5–10 years and could have impacted fertility. Thus, the greatly
increased risk of premature and early menopause among nulliparous
women with early menarche is consistent with sub-fertility and accel-
erated ovarian ageing (Kok et al., 2003). A ‘dose response’ was also
evident: women with early menarche who had one child also faced
increased risk of premature and early menopause, but to a lesser
extent than nulliparous women. As the timing of menarche is influ-
enced by factors early in life, including by maternal weight gain, child-
hood obesity and psychosocial stress in childhood (e.g. infant–parent

ation of late age at menarche and two or more children were used as reference group; y-axis on log scale). The estimates were fully adjusted for study

 attachment security), the findings may reflect an underlying common
cause for poor reproductive health through the life course (Belsky
et al., 2010; Forman et al., 2013). Genetic studies also have shown that
a number of menarche-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) collectively predicted age at natural menopause (Day et al.,
2015), supporting a causal relationship between the timing of these
two reproductive factors. More studies are needed to understand the
cumulative and interactive effects of genetic and environmental factors
on the association between menarche and menopause.
The main strength of this study was access to individual-level data
across several populations across different geographic regions and cul-
tures. The scale of this study was sufficiently large to provide the het-
erogeneity and statistical power needed to examine premature
menopause. The participant-level data in InterLACE enabled harmon-
ization of variables using common definitions, coding and cut points
not normally possible with meta-analyses of published results.
However, a number of limitations need to be acknowledged. Although
InterLACE comprises mainly of longitudinal studies of women in mid-
life, most of the studies (except the birth cohorts) relied on retro-
spectively reported age at menarche which may have led to some
degree of recall bias. The NSHD has information on age at menarche
collected prospectively and retrospectively and found that validity was
improved when age categories for menarche were used (as this was
the case in this study) (Cooper et al., 2006). Even though 70% of
women retrospectively reported their age at menopause at baseline,
misclassification was less likely to occur among women with prema-
ture or early menopause since women would notice if their menstrual
periods stop much earlier than expected. The accuracy of recall could
be influenced by educational level and having experienced a stillbirth
or miscarriage (Cooper et al., 2006). Women with a history of these
pregnancy complications might provide more accurate information as
part of understanding their gynaecological history.
Findings in this study of a rather small but statistically significant high-
er relative risks of later FMP compared with the reference group
among nulliparous women with early menarche were unexpected.
Study-specific analysis (data not shown) suggested only DNCS contrib-
uted to the statistical significance of the finding, with the pooled effect
estimate no longer significant when DNCS was excluded. This could
be due to some unmeasured confounding associated with that study.
Cohort differences between the women in our study and women
who are younger now are unavoidable since our cohorts’ members
(and any similar study) have to be postmenopausal. In many high-
income countries, there has been a long-term decline in the age at
menarche, a decline in the mean fertility rate of women, and increased
use of fertility treatments (Forman et al., 2013). The robust relation-
ships evident in this study suggest that they are likely to be highly rele-
vant, even if they should be applied with some caution to the current
generation of young and mid-aged women.
In summary, this study provides strong evidence for early menarche
as a risk factor for both premature and early menopause, a risk that
was amplified for nulliparous women. Current guidelines for the clinical
management of the menopausal transition, such as those given by
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK, address
the diagnosis and treatment options for premature ovarian failure/
insufficiency (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2015).
It suggests that if the findings of this study were incorporated into clin-
ical guidelines for advising nulliparous women from around the age of
35 years who had an early menarche (≤11 years), clinicians would gain
valuable time to prepare these women for the possibility of premature
ovarian failure/insufficiency or early menopause. The evidence also
strengthens the case for early preventive strategies and clinical surveil-
lance for these women to address the increased risks of chronic dis-
eases associated with earlier menopause.
