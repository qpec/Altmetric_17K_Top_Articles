its association with multimorbidity and mortality: 
a prospective analysis of 493 737 UK Biobank participants

Summary
Background Frailty is associated with older age and multimorbidity (two or more long-term conditions); however, little is 
known about its prevalence or effects on mortality in younger populations. This paper aims to examine the association 
between frailty, multimorbidity, specific long-term conditions, and mortality in a middle-aged and older aged population.
Methods Data were sourced from the UK Biobank. Frailty phenotype was based on five criteria (weight loss, 
exhaustion, grip strength, low physical activity, slow walking pace). Participants were deemed frail if they met at least 
three criteria, pre-frail if they fulfilled one or two criteria, and not frail if no criteria were met. Sociodemographic 
characteristics and long-term conditions were examined. The outcome was all-cause mortality, which was measured 
at a median of 7 years follow-up. Multinomial logistic regression compared sociodemographic characteristics and 
long-term conditions of frail or pre-frail participants with non-frail participants. Cox proportional hazards models 
examined associations between frailty or pre-frailty and mortality. Results were stratified by age group (37–45, 45–55, 
55–65, 65–73 years) and sex, and were adjusted for multimorbidity count, socioeconomic status, body-mass index, 
smoking status, and alcohol use.
Findings 493 737 participants aged 37–73 years were included in the study, of whom 16 538 (3%) were considered frail, 
185 360 (38%) pre-frail, and 291 839 (59%) not frail. Frailty was significantly associated with multimorbidity (prevalence 
18% [4435/25 338] in those with four or more long-term conditions; odds ratio [OR] 27·1, 95% CI 25·3–29·1) 
socioeconomic deprivation, smoking, obesity, and infrequent alcohol consumption. The top five long-term conditions 
associated with frailty were multiple sclerosis (OR 15·3; 99·75% CI 12·8–18·2); chronic fatigue syndrome (12·9; 
11·1–15·0); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5·6; 5·2–6·1); connective tissue disease (5·4; 5·0–5·8); and 
diabetes (5·0; 4·7–5·2). Pre-frailty and frailty were significantly associated with mortality for all age strata in men and 
women (except in women aged 37–45 years) after adjustment for confounders. 
Interpretation Efforts to identify, manage, and prevent frailty should include middle-aged individuals with 
multimorbidity, in whom frailty is significantly associated with mortality, even after adjustment for number of long-
term conditions, sociodemographics, and lifestyle. Research, clinical guidelines, and health-care services must shift 
focus from single conditions to the requirements of increasingly complex patient populations.

Introduction
Multimorbidity, the presence of two or more long-term 
conditions, is an increasing clinical and public health 
challenge.1 Multimorbidity has been shown to be linked 
to, although not synonymous with, frailty.2 Evidence 
informing management of multimorbidity remains sparse 
with most guidelines focusing on single diseases. Both the 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
and British Geriatrics Society emphasise the importance of 
recognising frailty to identify patients with multimorbidity 
who are at greater risk of adverse outcomes and who might 
benefit from treatment optimisation.3,4 The term frailty 
describes impaired resolution to homoeostasis following a 
stressor event.5 Frailty has been found to be a predictor of 
mortality, falls, worsening disability, hospitalisation, and 
care home admission in cohorts of elderly people.5 Various 
frailty classifications exist, but most widely cited is the 
frailty phenotype described by Fried and colleagues,6 which 
defines frailty as the presence of three or more out of 
five indicators: weakness (reduced grip strength), slowness 
(gait speed), weight loss, low physical activity, and 
exhaustion. People with one or two indicators are classified 
as pre-frail. This classification has been adapted for 
various epidemiological cohorts.7,8 Fried and colleagues 
conceptualised frailty as a distinct clinical entity causing 
disability independently of clinical and subclinical disease, 
but frailty is widely seen as both a predictor and outcome 
of multimorbidity.9
Although the prevalence of multimorbidity and frailty 
increases with age, neither is limited to the elderly. 
Although most people over the age of 65 years have 
multimorbidity, the absolute number of people with

multiple conditions is greater in people younger than age 
65 years.1 Although the original description of the frailty 
phenotype excluded participants younger than age 
65 years,6 frailty can also affect younger people.2,10,11 Frailty 
reflects 
biological 
and 
phenotypic, 
rather 
than 
chronological, age.10,11 Precursors of frailty tend to arise 
earlier in the life-course.10 Implicit in the frailty phenotype 
is progression from pre-frailty to frailty;6 however, this 
progression could be reversible in some patients.12 Frailty 
predicts future disability but might be modifiable, 
particularly at an early stage,12 suggesting that identification 
of frailty and pre-frailty in middle age (those younger than 
65 years) might have implications for prognosis, 
optimising care, and planning interventions, particularly 
in individuals with multimorbidity.
Despite the potential importance of frailty in middle-
aged people, most epidemiological studies assessing 
frailty have excluded those aged younger than 65 years.4,8 
Methods to identify frailty in clinical practice, as well as 
interventions targeting people with frailty, have almost 
exclusively concerned people aged older than 65 years.4,5 
The few epidemiological studies of frailty that include 
people younger than 65 years (with lower age limits 
ranging from 50–65 years) generally have small sample 
sizes, with most participants being aged over 65 years.13–19 
Analyses of the effect on mortality at different ages are 
limited to a few studies, and none have adjusted for 
lifestyle 
factors, 
socioeconomic 
deprivation, 
or 
multimorbidity. The prognostic significance of frailty in 
people younger than 65 years, and its association with 
specific patterns of multimorbidity, remains uncertain. 
This study aims to assess if an adaptation of the frailty 
phenotype using data from UK Biobank (a large 
community cohort of over half a million people aged 
37–73 years) can be used to identify people at increased 
risk of mortality across a range of ages; to quantify the 
association between frailty, multimorbidity, and long-
term conditions; and to assess the effect of frailty and pre-
frailty on all-cause mortality, adjusting for multi-morbidity, 
sociodemographic characteristics, and lifestyle factors.
Methods 
Study design and participants
This was a prospective, population-based cohort study of 
participants enrolled in the UK Biobank. A total of 
502 640 participants were recruited by postal invitation 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched Ovid MEDLINE between January, 1996, and 
December, 2017, without language restriction, for articles 
examining the association between frailty or multimorbidity 
and mortality in people aged younger than 65 years. We used 
the following terms: “frail*”, “frail elderly”, “middle-age*”, 
“multimorbid*”, “multi-morbid*”, “multimorbidity”, 
“mortality”, “death”, and “survival”. Searches were 
supplemented by hand-searching reference lists of any 
identified systematic reviews. We also searched for articles 
citing the original description of the “frailty phenotype” by 
Fried and colleagues. We included any community-based 
studies with longitudinal follow-up assessing mortality that 
included any participants aged younger than 65 years. Thirteen 
cohorts were identified that included some measure of frailty 
and included those aged younger than 65 years (three of these 
used the frailty phenotype model). In all but one of these 
studies, the number of participants aged younger than 65 years 
was unclear and the mean age of the frail participants was more 
than 70 years. Only one study (n=998) specifically assessed the 
impact of frailty on mortality in those aged younger than 
65 years. The phenotype model did not show a statistically 
significant association with mortality. No studies of the effects 
of multimorbidity on mortality included an assessment of 
frailty.
Added value of this study
Our findings show a greater than two times increase in 7-year 
mortality that is associated with frailty (assessed using the 
frailty phenotype model) in a large cohort of 493 737 people 
aged 37–73 years. These findings are consistent across age and 
sex strata (except in women aged 37–45 years), and are 
independent of the mortality risk associated with 
multimorbidity. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to 
assess the effect of frailty on mortality to date. It also includes a 
greater proportion of participants aged younger than 65 years 
than previous studies of frailty. Previous studies have not 
assessed the association between the frailty phenotype and 
mortality adjusting for associated multimorbidity. Previous 
studies of frailty have also not adjusted for sociodemographics 
or lifestyle. Our study shows that frailty was strongly associated 
with socioeconomic deprivation, obesity, smoking, and 
multimorbidity and that the effect on mortality persisted after 
adjusting for these factors.
Implications of all the available evidence
The management of frailty is an important clinical priority for all 
health professionals, not just those caring for older people. Frailty 
is identifiable in middle-aged as well as older adults, and is 
associated with mortality independently of the extent of 
multimorbidity as well as age, sex, sociodemographic, and 
lifestyle factors. Frailty is also associated with a range of 
long-term conditions. Clinical guidelines must emphasise the 
importance of identifying and addressing frailty in a range of 
clinical contexts. Future research needs to focus on the clinical 
implications of frailty across different disease contexts and 
broader age ranges, to inform the accurate and efficient 
identification of frailty in clinical settings, and to inform 
development of interventions to modify frailty and ameliorate its 
effects earlier in the life-course. Our findings suggest an urgent 
need to re-imagine and reconfigure health-care services to better 
meet the needs of our increasingly complex patient populations.

between 2006 and 2010 (5% response rate) and attended 
one of 22 assessment centres across England, Scotland, 
and Wales. Each participant completed a touchscreen 
questionnaire, a nurse-led interview, and had physical 
measurements. All participants gave written informed 
 
consent for data collection, analysis, and linkage. 
Participants had to be registered with a general 
practitioner, live within reasonable travelling distance of 
the assessment centre, and aged 40–69 years to be invited 
to participate in the study. In practice, some outside the 
age limit were also included. This study had ethical 
approval and is part of UK Biobank project 14151 (NHS 
National Research Ethics Service 16/NW
/0274). 
Procedures
Participants reported their long-term conditions at 
baseline assessment. The list of morbidities described in 
this paper was taken from a list of 43 long-term conditions 
originally established for a large epidemiological study in 
Scotland, through systematic review, the Quality and 
Outcomes Framework, NHS Scotland, and an expert 
panel,1 and subsequently amended for UK Biobank.20 The 
number of long-term conditions reported was summed 
and multimorbidity categorised as zero, one, two, three, 
or at least four long-term conditions.
Age was categorised as 37–45, 45–55, 55–65, and 
65–73 years. Townsend scores were derived from 
participant postcodes as an area-specific measure of 
socioeconomic deprivation based on preceding national 
census data (percentage unemployment, percentage car 
ownership, percentage home ownership, and household 
overcrowding).21,22 Body-mass index was categorised 
into underweight (<18·5 kg/m²), normal weight 
(≥18·5–25 kg/m²), overweight (>25–30 kg/m²), and 
obese (>30 kg/m²). Smoking was categorised as current 
smoker, ex-smoker, and non-smoker. Alcohol intake was 
based on self-reported frequency of alcohol intake (never 
or special occasions only; one to three times per month; 
one to four times per week; or daily or almost daily). Grip 
strength was assessed using a Jamar J00105 hydraulic 
hand dynamometer. Right and left hand measurements 
were recorded, and the higher of the two used in this 
analysis. Other variables included in the frailty phenotype 
were slow walking speed, exhaustion, recent weight loss, 
and physical activity, which were defined based on 
assessment centre questionnaire (table 1).
Frailty status was assessed using the five frailty 
phenotype indicators originally described by Fried and 
colleagues.6 As specific questions and measurements 
gathered for UK Biobank differed from the Cardiovascular 
Health Study on which the phenotype is based, we 
adapted the definitions of the criteria to be estimable 
using available data. Table 1 shows our definitions 
alongside those of Fried and colleagues. When possible, 
these adaptations were based on previously validated 
versions of the phenotype.7,8,19
Participants were classified as not frail (met none of the 
frailty criteria), pre-frail (met one or two criteria), or frail 
(met three or more criteria) according to cutoffs described 
by Fried and colleagues, to ensure consistency with the 
existing literature.6 Participants with missing data for 
one or more frailty criteria were excluded.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Data from 
the UK Biobank baseline assessment centre were linked 
to national mortality records by UK Biobank. Median 
follow-up duration was 7 years (IQR 76–93 months).
Statistical analysis
All analyses were planned before inspection of the data 
in keeping with STROBE guidelines.
First, sociodemographic characteristics were sum-
marised for frail, pre-frail, and non-frail participants. 
Age, sex, ethnic origin, socioeconomic status (Townsend 
score), smoking status, body-mass index, frequency of 
alcohol intake, number of long-term conditions, and 
number of medications were compared using χ² test for 
categorical variables, and Kruskal-Wallis test for 
continuous variables.
Next, we constructed adjusted models to test the 
association between sociodemographic characteristics 
and frailty status. We used a multinomial logistic 
regression model that allowed simultaneous estimation 
of the probability of different outcomes. Separate odds 
ratios (OR) and 95% CI were calculated for the frail and 
pre-frail groups, comparing each with the reference 
group (non-frail). All significant variables from the 
descriptive analysis were included in the final model 
except ethnic origin (because of an insufficient number 
of non-white participants for meaningful results).
Next, we assessed the association between long-term 
conditions and frailty status. Multinomial logistic 
regression models were fitted (using non-frail as the 
reference group) to assess the odds of frailty and pre-
frailty in the context of each long-term condition. 
Separate models were fitted for each long-term condition 
with a prevalence of greater than 1% in the cohort, 
adjusting for age, sex, deprivation, body-mass index, 
smoking status, and alcohol use. To compensate for 
multiple testing we calculated 99·75% CI based on a 
Bonferroni correction.
To assess the validity of the criteria used in our frailty 
definition we assessed the effect of each individual 
variable on all-cause mortality using separate Cox 
proportional hazards models. Men and women, as well as 
age categories (37–45, 45–55, 55–65, and 65–73 years), 
were modelled separately to assess if the mortality risk 
differed across age ranges and between sexes. All variables 
were then included in a combined model, adjusted for age 
and sex, to assess the independent effect of each variable. 
The incremental effect of increasing number of frailty 
indicators was assessed by comparing the hazard ratios 
for the presence of one, two, three, four, or five indicators, 
using the non-frail as the reference group. This was done 
because the cutoffs of meeting the pre-frail and frail 
criteria were validated on an older population.
Finally, Cox-proportional hazards models were fitted to 
assess the effect of frailty status (non-frail, pre-frail, or 
frail) on all-cause mortality. Models were stratified by age 
and sex, and adjusted for socioeconomic status, body-
mass index, smoking status, alcohol frequency, and 
multimorbidity count. Results were presented as hazard 
ratios (HR) and 95% CI for each age and sex stratum. The 
following subgroup analyses (also stratified by age and 
sex) were done along with tests for statistical interactions 
between predictors and frailty, to assess if the effect of 
frailty was modified by other covariates: one or fewer 
long-term conditions versus at least two long-term 
conditions, never-smokers versus current or previous 
smokers, never or occasional alcohol drinkers versus 
those drinking weekly or more frequently, body-mass 
index of more than 25 versus body-mass index of 25 or 
lower, and more affluent socioeconomic status versus 
more deprived status (divided at median Townsend score).

All analyses were done using R software (version 3.4.1). 
Descriptive or unadjusted analyses included all available 
data for eligible participants. Adjusted analyses excluded 
those with missing data for one or more covariates.

Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. All authors had full access to all the data in 
the study and the corresponding author had final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Of the 502 640 participants recruited to UK Biobank, 
493 737 (98%) had complete data for all five frailty indicators 
and were included in the current study; of these, 266 618 
(54%) were female, 399 481 (81%) were aged younger than 
65 years, 16 538 (3%) met the criteria for frailty and 185 360 
(38%) were pre-frail. Prevalence of frailty status for each 
age and sex category is shown in table 2. The prevalence of 
frailty and pre-frailty increased with age. Low grip strength 
and slow walking pace were associated with increasing 
age, whereas self-reported exhaustion and weight loss 
were more prevalent in younger participants.
Table 3 shows adjusted multinomial logistic regression 
models comparing baseline characteristics for frail and 
pre-frail participants with a reference group of non-frail 
participants, excluding 7191 (1%) of 493 737 participants 
who had missing data for one or more covariates. The 
unadjusted baseline characteristics for participants with 
each frailty status are shown in the appendix. Participants 
with frailty were more likely to be female. A higher 
proportion of frail participants were relatively socio-
economically deprived (6952 [42%] of 16 538 frail 
participants in the most deprived quintile vs 45 971 [16%] 
of 291 839 in the non-frail group; OR 3·71, 95% CI 
3·49–3·94). Frail participants were more likely to smoke 
(3312 frail participants [20%] were current smokers vs 
25 888 non-frail participants [9%]; 2·47, 2·36–2·60), to be 
non-drinkers or occasional drinkers (7610 frail participants 
[46%] were never-drinkers vs 42 766 non-frail participants 
[15%]; 3·09, 2·97–3·22), and were more likely to be obese 
(8279 frail participants [52%] had a body-mass index >30 
vs 53 218 non-frail participants [18%]; 4·10, 3·90–4·31) or 
be underweight (150 frail participants [1%] vs 1371 non-
frail participants [<1%]; 2·92, 2·41–3·53). Furthermore, 
when considering the pre-frail group, the percentages of 
each of these characteristics (deprivation, smoking, 
obesity, and non-drinker) were higher than in the non-
frail group, but lower than those observed in the frail 
group (appendix).
The prevalence of frailty at different levels of 
multimorbidity is shown in figure 1. The prevalence of 
both frailty and pre-frailty increased with increasing 
multimorbidity. Of the 161 576 participants with at least 
two long-term conditions, 11 865 (7%) met the criteria for 
frailty. Multimorbidity was also more common in frail 
participants: 11 865 (72%) of 16 538 frail participants were 
multimorbid compared with 66 022 (25%) of 291 839 non-
frail participants (OR 5·14, 95% CI 4·82–5·49 for two 
long-term conditions; 10·4, 9·7–11·2 for three long-term 
conditions). For those with at least four long-term 
conditions, frailty was prevalent in 4435 (18%) of 
25 338 participants. The proportion with at least four

long-term conditions was 4435 (27%) of 16 538 in the frail 
group versus 7299 (2·5%) of 291 839 in the non-frail 
group (OR 27·1, 95% CI 25·3–29·1).
Each individual long-term condition was associated with 
significantly greater odds of frailty and pre-frailty (adjusted 
for age, sex, socioeconomic status, body-mass index, 
smoking status, and alcohol use frequency; figure 2A 
and B). The associations for multiple sclerosis, chronic 
fatigue syndrome, connective tissue disease, diabetes, and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with frailty had the 
largest effect sizes.
At 
the 
end 
of 
follow-up, 
13 801 
(3%) 
of 
493 737 participants had died (1398 [8%] of 16 538 in the 
frail group, 6366 [3%] of 185 360 in the pre-frail group, 
and 6037 [2%] of 291 839 in the non-frail group). Mortality 
was higher in those with multimorbidity (7412 [5%] of 
161 576 with at least two long-term conditions, 6330 [2%] 
of 330 547 with one or fewer long-term conditions). Each 
frailty indicator was independently associated with a 
higher risk of mortality in all age and sex groups except 
females aged 37–45 years, and overall risk was higher 
with increasing number of frailty indicators (appendix).
Analysis of the mortality associated with frailty and 
pre-frailty, adjusted for multimorbidity count, socio-
economic status, body-mass index, smoking status, and 
alcohol use are shown in figure 3. Both frailty and pre-
frailty were significantly associated with mortality for all 
strata except in women aged 37–45 years. In the subgroup 
analyses, the effect size was greater in current or previous 
smokers, in weekly or more frequent alcohol drinkers, 
and those with body-mass index of more than 25 
(particularly in women aged 45–55 years) but it did not 
vary for different multimorbidity or socioeconomic status 
categories (appendix).
Discussion
In this prospective cohort comprising nearly half a 
million middle-aged and older-aged people, our findings 
show, by use of an adaptation of the frailty phenotype, 
that frailty and pre-frailty are associated with mortality in 
men of all ages included (37–73 years) and in women 
aged 45–73 years. This is the first attempt to adapt the 
frailty phenotype criteria to the UK Biobank cohort, which 
includes a considerably younger age range than previous 
studies. Frailty was strongly associated with multi-
morbidity; however, the associated mortality risk persisted 
after controlling for the number of long-term conditions. 
Our adapted definition identified 16 538 frail individuals 
(3%) of 493 737 study participants, and over 185 000 (38%) 
who met the criteria for pre-frailty. The prevalence of 
frailty was high in people with long-term conditions (eg, 
17% in multiple sclerosis). Frailty and pre-frailty were 
associated with age, female sex, both obesity and 
underweight, smoking, socioeconomic deprivation, and 
infrequent alcohol intake. Frailty was associated with a 
more than two-times increased risk of mortality in men 
and women aged 45 years and older and men aged 
37–45 years; however, the absolute rate of mortality was 
considerably higher in participants with multimorbidity. 
These findings are important given growing levels of 
multimorbidity affecting younger, socioeconomically 
deprived populations.1 The association of frailty with 
increased mortality—independently of recognised risk 
factors and number of long-term conditions—has 
important implications for risk stratification, clinical 
guidelines, health-care delivery, and design and planning 
of interventions to address increasing multimorbidity. 
Assessment of frailty in people with multimorbidity 
might facilitate identification of those at greatest risk, 
who would benefit most from intervention.
The existing frailty literature has not focused sufficiently 
on people aged younger than 65 years, with studies 
generally involving selected populations of younger people 
or including a wider age range in which the number of 
frail people aged younger than 65 years is unclear.14,16,18,19 
The largest study involving people younger than age 
65 years included 36 751 participants aged at least 50 years 
from the longitudinal Survey of Health, Ageing and 
Retirement in Europe (1528 were frail, mean age 73 years).23 
This study showed that the discrimination ability of the 
comorbidity index and frailty to predict mortality decreased 
with increasing age. Our findings suggest assessment of 
frailty might help to identify high-risk, multimorbid 
patients; however, the concept of frailty should be applied

with caution to younger patients. Although associated with 
mortality, the adapted phenotypic definition of frailty used 
here might be clinically and biologically different from that 
encountered in older patients.6 Greater understanding of 
the implications of this phenotype across different ages, 
and in a range of long-term conditions, is required. 
Interventions to reverse frailty or improve outcomes have 
almost exclusively focused on the elderly or people in long-
term care.5 Our findings indicate a need for a change in 
focus, to identify frailty and intervene much earlier. 
Clinicians and policy makers require an evidence base 
regarding what interventions might be effective in 
reducing frailty, or ameliorating its effects. Future research 
should explore the consequences of frailty across a wider 
age range and in those affected by multimorbidity. This 
will inform intervention development, which should be 
targeted at modifying or reversing the process. 
Interventions should be tailored to patients’ clinical 
contexts, as no single intervention is likely to be applicable 
to all those meeting the criteria for frailty.5 By intervening 
earlier, individuals and health-care systems have potentially 
more to gain.
The high proportion of people identified as pre-frail 
suggests that screening of younger populations for 
pre-frailty is probably unhelpful, because such an 
approach is unlikely to have sufficient specificity. Instead, 
we suggest that an assessment of frailty should be 
incorporated into routine monitoring and assessment of 
people with multiple morbidity, which might help 
identification of those at greater risk to ensure more 
accurate targeting of the multidimensional, patient-
centred reorganisation of care required to address 
complex multimorbidity, which has been highlighted as 
an important issue.4 Such an approach is likely to identify 
a higher proportion of frail people and use fewer 
resources through the use of existing structure and 
practices and could be incorporated into current chronic 
disease management pathways. An assessment of frailty 
should complement, rather than replace, a holistic 
assessment of a patient’s needs and preferences.
Access to health care is more difficult for people in 
socioeconomically deprived areas who have higher levels 
of multimorbidity.24 The strong association between 
frailty, socioeconomic deprivation, and multimorbidity 
shown here has implications for the distribution of 
health-care resources, which should be targeted at those 
with greatest clinical need to avoid further increasing 
inequalities. The configuration of health-care delivery,

which is currently highly fragmented and difficult to 
navigate, increases treatment burden experienced by 
patients and needs to be re-imagined in ways that will 
better support these high risk individuals and increase 
their capacity to self-manage to maximise their own 
wellbeing.25
Further research should explore the implications of 
frailty in younger people within specific clinical contexts. 
There is also a pressing need for public engagement on 
this subject and research to explore understanding and 
beliefs about frailty and frailty prevention. Such work is 
needed to inform design of interventions to identify, 
prevent, and manage frailty and pre-frailty across the age 
spectrum, particularly in those with multimorbidity.
To our knowledge, this is the largest longitudinal study 
to assess the effect of frailty on mortality, and the number 
of younger participants (those aged younger than 65 years) 
is far greater than in previous studies. We were able to 
adjust our analyses for a wide range of sociodemographic 
and lifestyle factors and multimorbidity. However, these 
data were only available at baseline and we were unable to 
model changes in multimorbidity or frailty over time, 
which could be considered a limitation. Other potentially 
important sociodemographic factors associated with 
frailty, such as diet, were not included in the model. The 
finding that participants who never or only occasionally 
drank alcohol were more likely to be frail was surprising, 
possibly explained by abstainer bias (people may drink no 
alcohol because they have poorer health and might have 
been advised not to).26
UK Biobank is a non-probability sample (ie, participants 
had to respond to an invitation to be included and were 
not completely random). Participants are mostly white 
British 
and 
comparatively 
less 
socioeconomically 
deprived than the UK average.27 As such, direct inferences 
cannot be made concerning the prevalence of frailty in 
the wider population and our findings are likely to be 
conservative.
Our adaptation of the frailty phenotype is based on a 
mixture of objective measurements and self-reported 
characteristics. Evaluations of self-reported frailty criteria 
have shown them to be equivalent,28 or in some cases 
superior,29 to measured alternatives; however, specific 
questions such as walking speed and weight loss might 
be affected by reporting bias. Several of our indicators 
also differ from the original frailty phenotype: importantly, 
we only had data on weight loss, not unintentional weight 
loss, which potentially underestimates the effects of this 
indicator as it could include people who lost weight 
deliberately.6 They might also have different implications 
across different age groups, and might not necessarily be 
markers of ageing when applied to younger people. 
Exhaustion, notably, was associated with younger age, 
and weight loss, low grip strength, and low physical 
activity were not associated with mortality in women aged 
37–45 years. For this reason, in addition to combining 
them in the phenotype model, we assessed each frailty 
criterion separately in each age and sex category to 
support their application to this younger cohort. The use 
of self-reported data to identify long-term conditions is a 
limitation that potentially led to recall bias; however, 
participants were supported by a study nurse when 
providing these data and self-reported illness has been 
suggested as a valid measure of morbidity.30 The presence 
of shared characteristics might explain apparent 
associations between the frailty phenotype and some 
conditions (such as exhaustion or low-physical activity 
and chronic fatigue syndrome). In the absence of a gold-
standard measure of multimorbidity,31 we considered a 
simple count, which was appropriate given the availability 
of data on a wide range of long-term conditions. However, 
our count was not weighted and we were unable to assess 
severity of the long-term conditions described. It also 
might have excluded potentially relevant conditions 
that might have been subclinical and not reported 
(eg, anaemia).
The frailty phenotype can be used to identify middle-
aged and older-aged people at increased risk of mortality. 
The increasing focus on frailty as a clinical entity worthy 
of identification and intervention should be broadened to 
include the large and increasing number of younger 
people with multimorbidity, to allow targeted intervention 
to those with the greatest complexity. The specific 
associations and implications of frailty in middle age 
need to be explored and understood to inform tailored 
and individualised health promotion and health-care 
delivery, particularly in people with multimorbidity. 
Our study also suggests an urgent need to re-imagine 
and reconfigure health-care services to better meet the 
needs of our increasingly complex patient populations, 
because the status quo in untenable.
