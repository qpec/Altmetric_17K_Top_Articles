In Brief
Dopamine neurons within the dorsal
raphe nucleus are sensitive to acute
social isolation, and are able to modulate
a ‘‘loneliness-like’’ state upon optical
stimulation. These neurons may underlie
the subjective experience of social
isolation as well as the motivational drive
to re-engage in social connections.

SUMMARY
The motivation to seek social contact may arise from
either positive or negative emotional states, as social
interaction can be rewarding and social isolation can
be aversive. While ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopa-
mine (DA) neurons may mediate social reward, a
cellular substrate for the negative affective state of
loneliness has remained elusive. Here, we identify a
functional role for DA neurons in the dorsal raphe nu-
cleus (DRN), in which we observe synaptic changes
following acute social isolation. DRN DA neurons
show increased activity upon social contact following
isolation, revealed by in vivo calcium imaging.
Optogenetic activation of DRN DA neurons increases
social preference but causes
place avoidance.
Furthermore, these neurons are necessary for pro-
moting rebound sociability following an acute period
of isolation. Finally, the degree to which these neu-
rons modulate behavior is predicted by social rank,
together supporting a role for DRN dopamine neu-
rons in mediating a loneliness-like state.
INTRODUCTION
The establishment and maintenance of social bonds is crucial for
survival of a social species. A social group offers safety and se-
curity, supports offspring survival, reduces the need for energy
expenditure, and provides a stage for social reward (Eisen-
berger, 2012). The motivation to initiate and maintain social
bonds may be rooted in emotional states of either positive or
negative valence. Social interactions can be rewarding and
thereby recruit components of the brain’s reward circuitry,
including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neu-
rons and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Do
¨ len et al., 2013; Gu-
naydin et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2002).
Conversely, the absence of social contact also triggers a
strong desire to seek social interaction. Social isolation, social
exclusion, or feelings of social disconnection can lead to loneli-
ness, which is a strongly aversive emotional state in humans
and detrimental to physical and mental well-being (Cacioppo
et al., 2006, 2014; Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010; House et al., 1988).
The aversive nature of this state is emphasized by the controver-
sial use of solitary confinement as a form of punishment (Browne
et al., 2011; Walker et al., 2014). Therefore, the negative state of
isolation can trigger the motivation to seek and engage in social
contact (Baumeister and Leary, 1995; Maner et al., 2007; Williams
and Sommer, 1997), perhaps as an evolutionarily conserved
mechanism to maintain social connections (Buss, 1990).
Social isolation is also aversive to rodents. Rodents are
innately social creatures and prefer social rather than isolate
housing (Loo et al., 2001). Even an acute period of isolation in ro-
dents increases motivation to seek out and engage with conspe-
cifics (Niesink and van Ree, 1982; Panksepp and Beatty, 1980).
However, little is known about how this isolation-induced state is
represented at a neural level.
Given that the mesolimbic DA system has been implicated in
social behavior (Gunaydin et al., 2014; Puglisi-Allegra and Cabib,
1997; Robinson et al., 2002) and that perturbations in DA
signaling have been reported following chronic social isolation
(Hall et al., 1998), we initially considered VTA DA neurons as a
candidate neural substrate for social isolation. However, since
optogenetic activation of VTA DA neurons increases social inter-
action (Gunaydin et al., 2014) and supports positive reinforce-
ment (Tsai et al., 2009; Witten et al., 2011), they are thought to
play a causal role in social reward.
Given that DA neurons are functionally heterogeneous (Bri-
schoux et al., 2009; Lammel et al., 2012), we investigated a rela-
tively neglected subpopulation of DA neurons in the dorsal raphe
nucleus (DRN). Amid the sparse existing knowledge of the func-
tional role of DRN DA neurons, optical stimulation of these neu-
rons does not support intra-cranial self-stimulation (ICSS)
(McDevitt et al., 2014), in contrast to the VTA (Witten et al.,
2011), suggesting that DRN and VTA DA neurons may be func-
tionally distinct.
Here, we investigated the functional role of DRN DA neurons,
which we found to possess the properties expected of a neural
substrate for a ‘‘loneliness-like’’ state. Specifically, the strength

 of excitatory inputs onto DRN DA neurons and their naturally
occurring activity in vivo were sensitive to social isolation. Opti-
cal activation of these neurons recapitulated a loneliness-like
state, while optical inhibition prevented the sociability typically
observed following a period of isolation. Furthermore, the magni-
tude of these effects was predicted by an individual’s social rank,
which indicates the importance of prior social experience in
determining the behavioral effect governed by these neurons.
Taken together, we propose that DRN DA neurons represent a
neural substrate for the subjective experience of social isolation
and serve to promote a response to alleviate this aversive state.
RESULTS
Acute Social Isolation Potentiates Synapses onto DA
Neurons in the DRN, but Not the VTA
In order to probe the effect of social isolation on glutamatergic
synaptic strength, we used whole-cell patch-clamp electrophys-
iology in brain slices prepared from male mice expressing GFP in
DA neurons (Figures S1A–S1E; Supplemental Experimental Pro-
cedures) and measured the a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-iso-
xazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)/N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor (NMDAR) ratio. Glutamatergic synapses onto VTA DA
neurons undergo rapid changes in synaptic strength within
24 hr of an acute appetitive (Ungless et al., 2001) or aversive
experience (Lammel et al., 2011; Saal et al., 2003). We therefore
considered whether 24 hr of social isolation could induce poten-
tiation at these synapses. However, we did not detect a dif-
ference in AMPAR/NMDAR ratio between group-housed and
socially isolated mice in VTA DA neurons (Figure 1A).
Among the relatively unexplored subpopulations of DAergic
neurons residing outside of the VTA, an intriguing group lies
within the DRN (Figure 1B) (Ho
¨ kfelt et al., 1976), which is highly
conserved across species (Saper and Petito, 1982). Strikingly,
DRN DA neurons in mice that were socially isolated for 24 hr ex-
hibited a significantly greater AMPAR/NMDAR ratio than group-
housed, naive mice (Figure 1C). In order to confirm this effect
was related to the experience of social isolation, rather than a
nonspecific salient environmental manipulation, we also exam-
ined movement into a new cage. We found that transfer into a
new cage as a group had no detectable effect on AMPAR/
NMDAR ratio, but social isolation in a new cage also increased
the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (Figure 1C).
Social Isolation Changes Receptor Composition at
Synapses onto DRN DA Neurons
To examine the mechanism of social isolation-induced plasticity
in DRN DA neurons, we used additional electrophysiological
measures. Postsynaptically, AMPAR subunit composition can
influence neuron excitability and synaptic efficacy (Liu and
Zukin, 2007). In contrast to GluR2-containing AMPARs, GluR2-
lacking receptors are Ca2+-permeable and exhibit higher sin-
gle-channel conductance (Hollmann et al., 1991; Swanson
et al., 1997). We found that the rectification index (RI) of the AM-
PAR current was significantly greater in socially isolated mice
(Figure 1D), suggesting an increase in GluR2-lacking AMPARs,
which exhibit a characteristic inwardly rectifying current at pos-
itive potentials (Bellone and Lu
¨ scher, 2006; Liu and Zukin, 2007).
At resting membrane potentials, the polyamine spermine can
partially block GluR2-lacking AMPARs (Bowie and Mayer,
1995), but opening of the receptor temporarily relieves this
blockade, which results in a greater response to subsequent
stimulation (Rozov and Burnashev, 1999). This therefore pro-
motes paired-pulse facilitation at GluR2-lacking synapses (Liu
and Zukin, 2007). Indeed, we found that the paired-pulse ratio
(PPR) in the presence of spermine was greater in socially isolated
mice (Figures S1F and S1G). Contrastingly, we did not detect a
significant difference in decay time constant of the NMDAR
current between group-housed and socially-isolated mice
(Figure S1H). Finally, to confirm an increase in GluR2-lacking
AMPARs at these synapses, we applied 1-naphthyl acetyl sper-
mine (NASPM, a selective blocker of GluR2-lacking AMPARs) to
brain slices prepared from group-housed or socially isolated
mice. This reduced the amplitude of the evoked AMPAR current
recorded in DRN DA neurons from socially isolated, but not
group-housed, mice (Figure 1E). Taken together, this suggests
that social isolation induces a relative increase in GluR2-lacking
AMPARs at glutamatergic synapses onto DRN DA neurons
(Figure 1F).
Activity of DRN DA Neurons In Vivo Increases upon Initial
Social Contact after Social Isolation
We next considered whether acute social isolation affected the
naturally occurring activity within DRN DA neurons. To address
this question, we utilized a genetically encodable fluorescent cal-
cium indicator, GCaMP6m (Chen et al., 2013), combined with
fiber photometry to enable real-time recording of fluctuations in

 neural activity (Cui et al., 2013; Gunaydin et al., 2014). We tar-
geted expression of GCaMP6m to DRN DA neurons by injection
of an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV5) carrying GCaMP6m
(AAV5-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6m) into the DRN of tyrosine hydroxy-
lase (TH)::IRES-Cre mice, which facilitated GCaMP6m expres-
sion in a Cre-dependent manner. An optic fiber implanted over
the DRN allowed simultaneous delivery of 473 nm excitation light
and collection of GCaMP6m emission by means of a dichroic and
a photodetector (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A).
To assess the effect of a social target on DRN DA activity, mice
were recorded in their home cage during the introduction of a
novel juvenile mouse. We compared the fluorescence signal, in
response to initial contact with the juvenile mouse, in mice that
had either been previously group-housed or socially isolated
for 24 hr. Strikingly, in socially isolated mice, we observed a sig-
nificant increase in the fluorescence signal in response to first
contact with the juvenile mouse, compared with group-housed
mice (Figures 2C–2F; Movie S1). Furthermore, in isolated mice,
the activity in response to initial social contact was significantly
greater than in response to initial interaction with a novel object
(Figures 2C–2F).
This suggests that, following social isolation, the presence of a
social stimulus is associated with a significant increase in DRN
DA activity in vivo. This is consistent with our finding that synap-
tic inputs onto DRN DA neurons are potentiated following social
isolation.
DRN DA Neurons Release DA and Glutamate
We next sought to characterize the neurotransmitter content of
DRN DA neurons, establish their sites of release, and validate pa-
rameters for subsequent causal experimentation. The TH+ DRN
neurons have been confirmed as DAergic as they express aro-
matic L-amino decarboxylase (AADC), the enzyme that catalyzes
conversion of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, the product of TH,
to DA (Lu et al., 2006) and the DA transporter (DAT) (Dougalis
et al., 2012). Furthermore, DRN TH+ neurons lack dopamine-
b-hydroxylase, which is necessary to convert DA to norepineph-
rine (Nagatsu et al., 1979), and do not express 5-hydroxytrypta-
mine (5-HT) (Stratford and Wirtshafter, 1990).
Still, it remained to be demonstrated where these neurons
synapse, which neurotransmitters they release, and whether
their activation is sufficient to elicit detectable neurotransmitter
release in vivo. To address these questions, we expressed Chan-
nelrhodopsin-2 fused to the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein
(ChR2-eYFP) in the DRN in a Cre-dependent manner (Figures 3A
and 3B). In TH::Cre mice we found that 77.7% of eYFP+ neurons
co-labeled with TH using immunohistochemistry (Figures S2B,
S2D, and S2F). This is consistent with a previous study (McDevitt
et al., 2014) and is similar to overlap reported in other mouse
lines used to selectively target DA neurons, including TH-GFP
and Pitx3-GFP (Dougalis et al., 2012). For comparison, we also
examined the DRN of DAT::IRES-Cre mice and found a similar
proportion (79.8%) of eYFP+ neurons were colabeled with TH
(Figure S2C, S2E, and S2G). As previously suggested (Ho
¨ kfelt
et al., 1976; Rogers, 1992), it is possible that some DA neurons
within this region express low levels of TH, which may be below
the detection threshold for immunohistochemistry and, thus,
result in a relatively high proportion of seemingly eYFP+/TH�
neurons. Importantly, eYFP expression did not overlap with
5-HT+ (serotonergic) neurons in either TH::Cre or DAT::Cre
mice (Figures S2B–S2G).
In order to confirm optically induced firing in DRN DA neurons,
we recorded from ChR2-expressing neurons using whole-cell
patch-clamp electrophysiology in brain slices (Figure 3C). We
delivered 473 nm light in a train of eight pulses of 5 ms pulse-width
at 30 Hz every 5 s, a pattern used for VTA stimulation to elicit DA
release and promote behavioral changes (Gunaydin et al., 2014;
Tsai et al., 2009). In the DRN, ChR2-expressing neurons reliably
followed these photostimulation parameters (Figure 3D).
Consistent with previous reports, eYFP expression in DRN DA
somata resulted in terminal expression in several regions
including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), bed nucleus of
the stria terminalis (BNST), lateral hypothalamus, central amyg-
dala (CeA), entorhinal cortex, and basolateral amygdala (Hasue
and Shammah-Lagnado, 2002; Meloni et al., 2006; Swanson,
1982; Yoshida et al., 1989). We observed particularly dense ter-
minal expression within the dorsolateral BNST (dlBNST) (Fig-
ure 3E) and the lateral part of the CeA (Figure 3F) and, therefore,
tested the effects of optical activation of DRN DA neurons on
these regions.
To confirm DA release in anesthetized TH::Cre mice, with Cre-
dependent expression of ChR2 in the DRN, we performed in vivo
fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) (Figures S3A–S3C). Optical
stimulation of DRN DA neurons elicited DA release in both the
dlBNST (Figure 3G) and the CeA (Figure 3H). The peak-evoked
DA release was greater in the dlBNST than the CeA at 30 Hz
and 50 Hz (Figures S3D–S3F), suggesting possible differences
in the dynamics of DA release and reuptake in these two regions.
In response to eight pulses of 30 Hz stimulation, delivered every 5
s, DA transients were consistently recorded in the dlBNST. How-
ever, in the CeA, transients were inconsistent and signals did not
adequately resolve as DA, perhaps suggesting DA release just
below the FSCV detection threshold (Figures 3G and 3H).
To determine whether DRN DA neurons co-release glutamate
and/or GABA in downstream targets, we prepared brain slices
containing the dlBNST (Figure 4A) or CeA (Figure 4B) from
TH::Cre and DAT::Cre mice expressing ChR2 in a Cre-depen-
dent manner in the DRN and recorded from neurons within the
region of terminal expression (Figures S4A–S4D). Photostimula-
tion of ChR2-expressing DA terminals elicited a short-latency
fast AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC)
in 25/30 neurons recorded in the dlBNST and 17/21 neurons in
the CeA (Figure 4C-F). There was no significant difference in
the proportion of neurons responding with an EPSC in TH::Cre
and DAT::Cre mice, so these data were pooled (Figures S4E–
S4G). Furthermore, the EPSCs persisted in the presence of tet-
radotoxin (TTX) and 4-aminopyridine (4AP), suggesting that
they represent monosynaptic glutamate release from DRN DA
terminals (Petreanu et al., 2007).
In contrast, optical stimulation of DAergic terminals did not
elicit a short-latency GABAA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic
current (IPSC) in the dlBNST or CeA (Figures 4C and 4D). How-
ever, in 3/23 dlBNST neurons and 4/24 CeA neurons we observed
IPSC responses with a long and variable latency (Figures 4G and
4H), suggesting that terminal stimulation can activate GABAergic
neurons to elicit a polysynaptic IPSC.

 We next confirmed the presence of a glutamatergic, but not
GABAergic, marker in DRN DA neurons using two lines of trans-
genic mice: vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2)::IRES-
Cre and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT)::IRES-Cre. With
Cre-dependent expression of eYFP in the DRN, a subset of
TH+ neurons co-expressed VGLUT2 (Figures 4I and 4J), yet
there was almost no overlap with VGAT (Figures 4K and 4L).
This is consistent with the observed co-expression of VGLUT2
in more caudal and medially located DA neurons (Kawano
et al., 2006).
Taken together, this demonstrates that optical stimulation
of ChR2-expressing DRN DA neurons is sufficient to trigger
rapid DA and glutamate release in two major downstream
targets.
Optogenetic Activation of DRN DA Neurons Mimics a
Loneliness-like State
To test for a causal relationship between DRN DA activation and
an increase in sociability, we combined ChR2-mediated photo-
stimulation with freely moving behavior (Figures S5A and S5B).
We assessed social preference utilizing the three-chamber so-
ciability task, in which time spent on the ‘‘social’’ side of the
chamber (containing a juvenile mouse under a wire cup) is
used as a measure of sociability (Moy et al., 2004; Silverman
et al., 2010). Here, social approach is solely controlled by the
experimental animal, as containment of the juvenile mouse re-
moves the potential threat of territorial disputes, permitting an
unadulterated measure of social interest (Silverman et al.,
2010). We found that in TH::Cre mice expressing ChR2, but not
eYFP, optical stimulation resulted in a significant increase in
the proportion of time spent in the social zone (Figures 5A–5D),
a result we replicated in DAT::Cre mice (Figures S5C and S5D).
This suggests that activation of DRN DA neurons plays a
causal role in driving social behavior. Similarly, however, it has
been shown that calcium signals can be detected in VTA DA neu-
rons in response to a social target, and optical stimulation of
these neurons promotes social interaction (Gunaydin et al.,
2014), which has led to the hypothesis that VTA DA neurons
represent a neural substrate for social reward. If DRN DA neu-
rons were also encoding social reward, we would expect
increased activity within these neurons to be positively reinforc-
ing, similar to VTA activation, which has been shown to support
ICSS (Witten et al., 2011) and conditioned place preference
(CPP) (Tsai et al., 2009). Conversely, if DRN DA neurons are moti-
vating social approach, due to an unmet need for social contact
resulting from isolation, we would expect increased activity in
these neurons (in the absence of a social stimulus) to elicit a
negative affective state.
To distinguish between these two possibilities, we tested mice
on an ICSS paradigm. However, we found that optical stimula-
tion of DRN DA neurons did not support ICSS in TH::Cre (Figures
5E and 5F) or DAT::Cre mice (Figure S5E). Next, we assessed
behavior in a real-time place avoidance (RTPA) assay, whereby
mice freely explored a chamber in which one half was paired
with blue light stimulation. Here, we observed avoidance of
the light-paired side of the chamber relative to the unstimulated
side in ChR2-, but not eYFP-expressing, TH::Cre and DAT::Cre
mice (Figures S5F–S5H). Additionally, to eliminate confounding
effects of stimulation-induced arousal, we examined behavior
in a CPP paradigm (Figure 5G). During the test session, ChR2-
expressing mice showed significant avoidance of the stimula-
tion-associated zone, relative to eYFP-expressing mice (Figures
5H–5J). Furthermore, using additional behavioral assays, we
found that optical stimulation of DRN DA neurons had no detect-
able effect on locomotion, novelty preference, or anxiety-related
behavior (Figures S5I–S5X). This suggests that, in stark contrast
to VTA DA neurons, optical activation of DRN DA neurons pro-
duces an aversive state.
In sum, we find that increasing activity of DRN DA neurons in
group-housed mice promotes social preference but also elicits
a negative affective state in the absence of a social target. We
posit that this recapitulates a loneliness-like state, in which social
approach is driven to alleviate the aversive state associated with
social isolation.
Photoinhibition of DRN DA Neurons Reduces Isolation-
Induced Sociability
Typically, in response to situations of social isolation or loneli-
ness, individuals are motivated to re-establish social contact
(Maner et al., 2007) and pay greater attention to social stimuli
(Gardner et al., 2005; Pickett et al., 2004). In rodents, even an
acute period of social isolation can elicit a rebound increase in
social behavior (Niesink and van Ree, 1982; Panksepp and
Beatty, 1980). In order to test whether DRN DA neurons are
required to promote sociability following social isolation, we ex-
pressed a hyperpolarizing opsin (NpHR) in a Cre-dependent
manner in the DRN of TH::Cre mice to mediate optical inhibition
(Figure S6A).
Our in vivo recordings (Figure 2) revealed that the increase in
DRN DA activity, on initial contact with a social target, was signif-
icantly greater in isolated, compared with group-housed, mice.
First, therefore, we tested whether optical inhibition of DRN DA
neurons altered social preference in group-housed mice using
the three-chamber sociability task. Consistent with our recording
results, neither NpHR- nor eYFP-expressing mice showed a sig-
nificant difference in the proportion of time spent in the social
zone with optical inhibition (Figure 6A and 6B). Furthermore,
we did not observe significant effects of optical inhibition on
behavioral measures of arousal or anxiety-related behavior (Fig-
ures S6B–S6J).
We next socially isolated NpHR- and eYFP-expressing mice
for 24 hr and then tested social preference with optical inhibition.
This revealed that mice expressing NpHR spent a significantly
lower proportion of time in the social zone, compared with
eYFP-expressing mice (Figure 6C). We then compared the social
preference of mice tested with optical inhibition while group-
housed and following social isolation. While eYFP-expressing
mice showed the typical trend toward an increase in social pref-
erence following isolation, optical inhibition in NpHR-expressing
mice resulted in a significant decrease in social preference
following isolation (Figures 6D and 6E).
Collectively, these data suggest that inhibition of DRN DA neu-
rons prevents the typical restoration of social contact following a
period of isolation. This supports the hypothesis that DRN DA ac-
tivity is required for motivating sociability in response to the
negative state of isolation.

 Prior Social Experience Predicts Functional Role of DRN
DA Neurons
Social groups vary in terms of their size, complexity, and the na-
ture of interactions between individuals. Given that the size of so-
cial networks has been correlated to structural differences in the
brain (Sallet et al., 2011), we considered whether the degree of
synaptic potentiation induced by social isolation would be related
to the previous social group size. We compared data from mice
that either remained group-housed or experienced social isola-
tion and found that the magnitude of the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio
was positively correlated with the number of previous cagemates
in socially isolated, but not continually group-housed, mice (Fig-
ures 7A and 7B). This suggests that prior social environment con-
tributes to subsequent isolation-induced synaptic strength.
Mice, like primates, form dominance hierarchies when housed
together, which are thought to aid stability of social groups
(Drews, 1993; Uhrich, 1938). Dominant behavior in males in-
cludes agonistic displays of behavior, priority access to food
and resources, territorial urine marking, and winning situations
of social conflict (Wang et al., 2014). As a result, the subjective
experience of social interaction is likely to differ between mem-
bers of a social group dependent on their social rank. Thus, we
next hypothesized that social rank could influence the behavioral
effects elicited by activation or inhibition of DRN DA neurons.
We estimated relative dominance within each cage (see Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures and Figures S7A and S7B)
and examined the relationship between social rank and the
change in social preference elicited by photoactivation of DRN
DA neurons (Figure 5C). Intriguingly, we found that relative domi-
nance and change in social preference were positively corre-
lated, such that optical stimulation of DRN DA neurons appeared
to be more effective at promoting social preference in dominant
mice (Figures 7C, 7D, and S7C). Next, we assessed the relation-
ship between social dominance and preference for the optical
stimulation zone in ChR2-expressing mice tested in the RTPA
assay (Figure S5G). Here, we observed a negative correlation
between relative dominance and preference for the stimulation
zone, such that more dominant mice displayed greater avoid-
ance of the light-paired side of the chamber (Figures 7E, 7F,
and S7D).
Finally, we examined the change in social preference of NpHR-
expressing mice when receiving optical inhibition while group-
housed compared to following isolation. Conversely, we observed
a significant negative correlation (Figures 7G, 7H, S7E, and S7F),
indicating that photoinhibition produced a greater reduction in so-
cial preference following isolation in more dominant mice.
Thus, in all cases, dominant mice showed a greater degree of
behavioral modulation upon optogenetic manipulation of DRN
DA neurons.
DISCUSSION
Satisfying the Profile of a Neural Substrate for a
Loneliness-like State
The characteristics we have observed in DRN DA neurons bear
remarkable similarities to the hypotheses generated from human
psychology in describing the ‘‘need to belong’’ (Baumeister and
Leary, 1995). First, it has been hypothesized that a ‘‘social moni-
toring system’’ exists which assimilates information on an indi-
vidual’s current and desired level of social acceptance (Gardner
et al., 2005; Leary et al., 1995). Our finding that acute social isola-
tion induces synaptic plasticity at synapses onto DRN DA neu-
rons (Figure 1) suggests that these neurons either play a role in
detecting or in reconciling the disparity between the current
and desired social environment.
Second, in a state of loneliness, wherein an individual’s basic
need for social connection is unmet (Peplau, 1978), processing
of socially relevant information should be prioritized (Baumeister
and Leary, 1995). Indeed, in humans, socially excluded individ-
uals display an enhanced memory for social events (Gardner
et al., 2000), and more lonely individuals show increased attention
toward social cues (Gardner et al., 2005; Pickett et al., 2004).
Consistently,in sociallyisolated mice,we observed asignificantly
greater increase in DRN DA activity during initial contact with a
social target (Figure 2), compared with group-housed mice.
Third, it has been postulated that the motivation for social re-
connection should elicit ‘‘goal-orientated behavior’’ (Baumeister
and Leary, 1995). With photoactivation, we revealed that acti-
vating DRN DA neurons promoted social preference in group-
housed mice (Figure 5). However, in the absence of a social
target, mice avoided photoactivation of DRN DA neurons, sug-
gesting that stimulation is aversive. This suggests that activation
of these neurons may be recapitulating a loneliness-like state,
which is marked by a negative-affective state in which the drive
to seek social contact is increased.
Fourth, the motivation for social re-connection was hypothe-
sized to be ‘‘sensitive to satiation patterns’’ (Baumeister and
Leary, 1995). In line with this, in group-housed mice, we
observed limited changes in DRN activity related to initial juvenile
contact (Figure 2), and photoinhibition of these neurons did
not alter social behavior (Figure 6). Therefore, under ‘‘sated’’
group-housed conditions, this type of motivation may not be
playing a major role. In contrast, following social isolation, photo-
inhibition caused a reduction in social preference (Figure 6). This
indicates that the activity within these neurons may only be
necessary in situations in which the motivation for social contact
is high, such as that experienced after social isolation.
It has been hypothesized that the ‘‘need to belong’’ represents
a powerful motivational drive, comparable to the basic need for

 food in a state of hunger (Baumeister and Leary, 1995). In consid-
ering this analogy with feeding behavior, it is intriguing to note
that distinct neural circuits are thought to motivate food con-
sumption related to the rewarding value of food (Nieh et al.,
2015) and the need to obtain food to alleviate the negative state
of hunger (Chen et al., 2015; Sternson et al., 2013). Thus, in a
similar manner, social behavior may be driven by distinct neural
circuits when motivated by social reward and when motivated by
the punishment of social isolation.
The Subjective Experience of Social Isolation
In humans, a clear distinction can be made between an individ-
ual’s subjective (perceived) isolation and their objective isolation.
Perceived social isolation (or loneliness) reflects the quality of an
individual’s social interactions (Hawkley et al., 2008; Peplau,
1978) rather than their quantity or frequency. In humans,
perceived social isolation predicts a poor outcome in numerous
physical and mental health-related measures, entirely indepen-
dent of the level of objective isolation (Adam et al., 2006; Ca-
cioppo et al., 2006; Hawkley et al., 2006; Wen et al., 2006). While
‘‘loneliness’’ per se is difficult to directly test in mice, and conse-
quently, the lack of animal literature on this phenomenon is noted
(Cacioppo et al., 2014), social rank offers a useful estimate of an
individual’s subjective social experience.
When we overlaid this measure onto our behavioral data,
remarkably, we observed a relationship in which dominant mice
were more sensitive to the behavioral effects of manipulating
DRN DA activity (Figure 7). It might be expected that the quality
of social interaction for a dominant animal may be very different
from a subordinate, and thus, their subjective experience of so-
cial isolation may also differ. Therefore, in their representation

 of a loneliness-like state, changes in DRN DA activity may only
exert a significant effect on the behavior of individuals who are
engaged in positively valued social interactions. Importantly,
this also suggests that DRN DA neurons are not merely indicating
the removal of sensory stimuli by social isolation but actually rep-
resenting the subjective experience of a loneliness-like state.
It remains to be determined whether underlying neural differ-
ences play a causal role in dictating social rank and/or whether
social rank itself imposes a change in neuronal properties. In
monkeys, the attainment of a dominant social rank increases

striatal D2/3 receptor availability (Morgan
et al., 2002), while in mice, altering synap-
tic efficacy in the mPFC is sufficient to
promote a change in social rank (Wang
et al., 2011). Furthermore, the observa-
tion that socially isolated and subordinate

show
similar

receptor
availability (Morgan et al., 2002) supports
the notion that subordinate animals may be in a loneliness-like
state, even while group-housed. Therefore, this may be one
reason why manipulations of DRN DA activity were not as
effective in promoting behavioral adaptations in subordinate
animals.
Characterizing Components of the DRN DA Circuit
The relative bias of the DRN DA neurons in their projections to the
BNST and CeA (Hasue and Shammah-Lagnado, 2002; Meloni
et al., 2006) represents an important distinction from the VTA

627
 population and suggests these DA neurons are part of a distinct
circuit. The BNST and the CeA have been implicated in diverse
behavioral functions (Davis et al., 2010; Janak and Tye, 2015;
Kim et al., 2013), and DA receptor signaling in these regions
modulates synaptic transmission and activity (Kash et al.,
2008; de la Mora et al., 2010). Given that the BNST has been
associated with mediating long-term ‘‘tonic’’ behavioral re-
sponses to sustained, diffuse, and/or unpredictable threats,
whereas the CeA is thought to be more important in the rapid,
acute response to threatening stimuli (Davis et al., 2010), it is
likely that both of these regions may be important in mediating
the observed effects of DRN DA stimulation on behavior.
Indeed, 24 hr of social isolation results in a blunting of long-
term potentiation (LTP) in the BNST (Conrad et al., 2011). Given
that DA release in the BNST has been shown to facilitate LTP
(Kash et al., 2008), we speculate that increased DA release
following social isolation may occlude LTP. However, we also
demonstrate that glutamate can be released with optical stimu-
lation of the DRN DA neurons, and the neuropeptide vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP) is co-expressed in a subset of DA neurons
(Dougalis et al., 2012). Thus, DA, glutamate, VIP, or the coordi-
nated activity of these three neurotransmitters/neuromodulators
may be important in facilitating the output of the DRN DA
neurons.

Continued dissection of the neural mechanisms which govern
social behavior is vital for the understanding and treatment of

Figure 7. Prior Social Experience Predicts
Magnitude of Social Isolation-Induced Syn-
aptic Potentiation and Behavioral Response
to Optogenetic Manipulation
(A and B) Scatter plot of AMPAR/NMDAR ratios
recorded in DRN DA neurons plotted against the
number of mice per cage in group-housed mice,
and (B) the number of mice previously housed per
cage in socially isolated mice. No significant cor-
relation was detected in group-housed mice
(Pearson’s correlation: p = 0.3653, r2 = 0.0374, n =
24), but a significant positive correlation was found
in socially isolated mice (Pearson’s correlation:
**p = 0.0021, r2 = 0.5282; n = 15).
(C) Relative social rank of TH::Cre mice was esti-
mated with a score of 0 indicating the most sub-
ordinate and 1 the most dominant mouse in each
cage. Relative dominance of ChR2-expressing
mice plotted against the change in time spent in the
social zone of the three-chamber apparatus (with
blue light stimulation � without stimulation). There
was a significant positive correlation between
relative dominance and change in social zone time
(Pearson’s correlation: *p = 0.0163, r2 = 0.4913; n =
11).
(D) Mean (+ SEM) change in social-zone time for
mice of each social rank.
(E) Relative dominance of ChR2-expressing mice
plotted against the difference in preference for the
light-stimulation zone (proportion of time spent in
the stimulation zone � proportion of time spent in
the unstimulated zone) in the RTPA assay. There
was a significant negative correlation between
relative dominance and preference for the stimu-
lation zone (Pearson’s correlation: *p = 0.0338, r2 =
0.2668, n = 17).
(F) Mean (� SEM) difference in preference for
stimulation zone for mice of each social rank.
(G) Relative dominance of NpHR-expressing mice
plotted against the change in social-zone time
(isolated with yellow light – grouped with yellow
light). There was a significant negative correlation
between relative dominance and the change in
social-zone time following isolation (Pearson’s
correlation: **p = 0.0038, r2 = 0.6241, n = 11).
(H) Mean (± SEM) change in social zone time for
mice of each social rank.

 social impairments, which characterize many debilitating neuro-
psychiatric disorders. Our data present an additional element for
consideration in the control of social behavior, and support a
novel role for a relatively unstudied population of DA neurons
in representing the experience of social isolation.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ex Vivo Electrophysiology
Brain slices (220 mm thick) containing the DRN or VTA were prepared from
male heterozygous TH-GFP or Pitx3-GFP mice in order to target DA neurons.
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in voltage-clamp using a
Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and Clampex 10.2 software
(Molecular Devices). Afferent fibers were stimulated using a bipolar stimulating
electrode (FHC) and glutamatergic currents were isolated by addition of picro-
toxin (100 mM) to the ACSF.
Fiber Photometry
TH::Cre mice received an injection of AAV5-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6m into the
DRN, and an optic fiber, held in a stainless steel ferrule, was implanted in
the region. The photometry system was constructed similar to previously
described (Gunaydin et al., 2014). GCaMP6m fluorescence was recorded
while mice were in their home cage for 5 min before and after addition of a ju-
venile mouse or novel object.
Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV)
Anesthetized in vivo FSCV experiments were conducted similar to those pre-
viously described (Tsai et al., 2009). TH::Cre mice, which had received an in-
jection of AAV5-DIO-ChR2-eYFP into the DRN, were anesthetized with ure-
thane and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Voltammetric recordings were
collected, from either BNST or CeA, at 10 Hz by applying a triangular waveform
(�0.4 V to +1.3 V to �0.4 V, 400 V/s) to a carbon-fiber electrode lowered into
the region, versus an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.
Behavioral Testing
TH::Cre and DAT::Cre mice received an injection of AAV5-DIO-ChR2-eYFP,
AAV5-DIO-NpHR3.0-eYFP, or AAV5-DIO-eYFP into the DRN and were allowed
at least 4 weeks for viral expression before behavioral testing. Mice were
housed on a 12 hr:12 hr reverse light/dark cycle (lights off at 9:00 am) and
tested during their active dark phase. Optical activation or inhibition was
achieved by delivery of 473 nm light (30 Hz train of 8 pulses of 5 ms pulse width)
or 593 nm light (constant), respectively, via an optic fiber secured in a stainless
steel ferrule implanted over the DRN. For details of specific behavioral assays,
see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
