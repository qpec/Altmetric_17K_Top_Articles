ABSTRACT
Background: The consumption of sweet beverages has been asso-
ciated with greater risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity, which may be
involved in the development of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, it has
been hypothesized that sweet beverages may increase pancreatic
cancer risk as well.
Objective: We examined the association between sweet-beverage
consumption (including total, sugar-sweetened, and artificially
sweetened soft drink and juice and nectar consumption) and pan-
creatic cancer risk.
Design: The study was conducted within the European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. A total of 477,199
participants (70.2% women) with a mean age of 51 y at baseline
were included, and 865 exocrine pancreatic cancers were diagnosed
after a median follow-up of 11.60 y (IQR: 10.10-12.60 y). Sweet-
beverage consumption was assessed with the use of validated die-
tary questionnaires at baseline. HRs and 95% CIs were obtained with
the use of multivariable Cox regression models that were stratified by
age, sex, and center and adjusted for educational level, physical ac-
tivity, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. Associations with total
soft-drink consumption were adjusted for juice and nectar consump-
tion and vice versa.
Results: Total soft-drink consumption (HR per 100 g/d: 1.03; 95%
CI: 0.99, 1.07), sugar-sweetened soft-drink consumption (HR per
100 g/d: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.08), and artificially sweetened soft-
drink consumption (HR per 100 g/d: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.10) were

 not associated with pancreatic cancer risk. Juice and nectar con-
sumption was inversely associated with pancreatic cancer risk (HR
per 100 g/d: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.99); this association remained
statistically significant after adjustment for body size, type 2 diabe-
tes, and energy intake.
Conclusions: Soft-drink consumption does not seem to be associ-
ated with pancreatic cancer risk. Juice and nectar consumption
might be associated with a modest decreased pancreatic cancer risk.
Additional studies with specific information on juice and nectar
subtypes are warranted to clarify these results.

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer was the seventh most common cancer and
the fifth most common cause of cancer death in Europe in
2012 (1). Five-year survival rates are among the lowest (,5%)
of all cancer types in Europe (2). A screening test for early
detection does not exist, and treatment is hardly effective.
The avoidance of exposure to modifiable risk factors is cur-
rently the most feasible approach to reduce pancreatic cancer
incidence.
To date, no dietary factors have been consistently associated
with pancreatic cancer (3). However, type 2 diabetes and obesity
are established risk factors for pancreatic cancer (3, 4). Studies
have directly linked elevated prediagnostic blood glucose and
insulin to increased pancreatic cancer risk (5–7). Because sweet-
beverage consumption (comprising soft-drink consumption and
juice and nectar consumption) has been associated with greater
risks of type 2 diabetes and obesity (8, 9), it is conceivable that it
is also associated with pancreatic cancer. If confirmed, such
evidence could influence the formulation of health policies and
disease-preventative strategies.
Previous studies on soft-drink consumption and pancreatic
cancer have shown inconsistent results (3, 10, 11). Although
some individual studies have shown a significant positive asso-
ciation between soft-drink consumption and pancreatic cancer
(12, 13), a meta-analysis of 7 prospective cohort studies and
a pooled analysis of 14 cohort studies showed an overall non-
significant but positive association between high soft-drink
consumption and pancreatic cancer risk (3, 10).
Evidence on the association between subgroups of soft-drink
consumption and fruit-juice consumption and pancreatic cancer
has also been scarce, with a meta-analysis showing overall null
findings (3). The majority of the epidemiologic studies that have
explored the association of sweet-beverage consumption and
pancreatic cancer risk have been published in the United States,
and to our knowledge, only one European study (12) has been
published on this issue. The consumption of sweetened beverages
is lower in Europe than in the United States, although it is on the
rise (14). The aim of the current study was to examine the as-
sociation between sweet-beverage consumption (including total,
sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened soft-drink consump-
tion and juice and nectar consumption) and pancreatic cancer in
the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition) study. The EPIC study included European populations
with diverse dietary patterns, which is an asset for studies that
evaluate diet and disease risk; in addition, the large sample size
allowed for the stratification by subgroups of sugary drinks and
the evaluation of an effect modification with sufficient power.
METHODS
Population
The EPIC is a prospective study of .500,000 participants
from 23 centers in 10 European countries (Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Netherlands,
and United Kingdom) established between 1992 and 2000. In
some study centers, participants were recruited from the general
population who were residing in a given geographical area.
However, the French cohort consisted of female members of
a health-insurance scheme for school and university employees;
the Spanish and Italian cohorts consisted mainly of local blood
donors; the cohorts in Utrecht (Netherlands) and Florence (Italy)
consisted of women who were invited for a breast cancer–
screening program; the Norwegian cohort consisted of women
who were participating in a nationwide cancer study; and the
cohort in Oxford, United Kingdom, mostly included people who
did not eat meat and health conscious participants. In France,
Norway, Utrecht (Netherlands), and Naples (Italy), only women
were recruited. All participants provided informed consent, and
the study was approved by the Internal Review Board of the
International Agency for Research on Cancer and the ethics
committees of all centers. Recruitment and data collection have
been described in detail elsewhere (15).
A study flowchart is shown in Supplemental Figure 1. After

 did not complete dietary or nondietary questionnaires (n =
6253), participants with a ratio of energy intake and estimated
energy expenditure in the top or bottom 1% of the cohort distri-
bution (n = 9600), participants with pancreatic secondary tumors
(n = 67), endocrine tumors (n = 40), a benign tumor (n = 1),
a carcinoma in situ (n = 1), and a tumor with uncertain primary
or metastatic origin (n = 1), the analysis included a total of
477,199 participants (142,202 men and 334,997 women) with
a mean age of 51 y at baseline.
Exposure and covariate assessment
The usual diet over the previous 12 mo was assessed with the
use of country-specific validated dietary questionnaires (16) at
baseline. Individual energy, dietary folate intake, and alcohol
intake (g/d) were estimated through linkage with the standardized
EPIC Nutrient Database (17). Sweet-beverage consumption was
derived from questionnaire data by summing total soft-drink
consumption and juice and nectar consumption. For total soft
drinks, carbonate and isotonic drinks and diluted syrups were
combined. Juices and nectars refer to juices (obtained from either
100% fruit and vegetables or concentrates) and nectars (juices
with #20% added sugar). Total soft-drink consumption was
subdivided into sugar-sweetened consumption and artificially
sweetened soft-drink consumption; however, these different
types of soft drinks could not be distinguished in Italy, Spain,
and Sweden; hence, these countries were excluded in the anal-
ysis that explored subtypes of soft drinks. The available data did
not allow us to distinguish juice and nectar consumption into
separate categories.
At baseline, questionnaires were administered to collect in-
formation on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyles, and
previous illnesses (15). This information included educational
level (no formal education, primary school, secondary school,
technical school, university degree, or missing); smoking status
(never smoker, former smoker, or current smoker), intensity of
smoking (i.e., never; former: quit #10, 11–20, .20 y ago;
smoker of 1–15, 16–25, or .25 cigarettes/d; or smoker of a pipe
or cigar) and duration of smoking (in y); physical activity (in-
active, moderately inactive, moderately active, active, or miss-
ing; determined with the use of the Cambridge physical activity
index) (18); and self-reported prevalent type 2 diabetes history.
Height (cm), weight (kg), and waist circumference (cm) were
measured at baseline except in France, Oxford, and Norway, where
participants self-reported these data in questionnaires. For the
health-conscious group from Oxford, sex- and age-specific anthro-
pometric measures were predicted by fitting linear regression
models on a subset of subjects with measured and self-reported
values (19). In Norway, waist circumference was not assessed (20).
Outcome assessment
Incident cancer and mortality data were obtained from regional
or national population-based cancer and mortality registers ex-
cept in Germany, Greece, and France, where they came from
a combination of methods including active follow-up through
study participants, next-of-kin information, the use of health-
insurance records, and cancer and pathology registries. Follow-
up was considered completed up to the end of 2009 for Germany,
France, and Greece; mid-2008 for Cambridge; 2008 for Turin,
Norway, and Sweden; 2007 for Denmark, Netherlands, Murcia,
Navarra, and Oxford; 2006 for Florence, Varese, Ragusa, Naples,
Granada, and San Sebastian; and 2004 for Asturias. This
assessment resulted in 11.60 y of median follow-up (IQR:
10.10-12.60 y).
Pancreatic cancer cases were defined as having a first incident
adenocarcinoma of the exocrine pancreas (International Classi-
fication of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition codes C25.0–
C25.3 and C25.7–C25.9). All tumors that were self-reported by
the study participants in Greece, Germany, and France were
confirmed by a review of appropriate medical records. Of the
865 exocrine pancreatic cancer cases, 608 cases (70.3%) were
microscopically confirmed on the basis of the histology of the
primary tumor (n = 359), histology of metastasis (n = 68), cy-
tology (130), or autopsy (n = 51). For the remaining 29.7% of
cases, the diagnosis was based on the clinical symptoms,
physical examination, or imaging results.
Statistical analysis
We estimated HRs and 95% CIs with the use of a Cox pro-
portional hazards regression. The time at entry was the age at
baseline, and the exit time was the age of a first pancreatic cancer
diagnosis for cases and the age at censoring for noncases (death,
loss to follow-up, or end of follow-up, whichever came first).
Models were stratified by center, sex, and age at baseline in 1-y
categories. The nonzero slope of the scaled Schoenfield residuals
on the time function suggested that the proportional hazard as-
sumption was met.
Analyses were run separately for each country and combined
with the use of a random-effects meta-analysis while calculating
I2, which was the percentage of variation between countries that
was due to heterogeneity (21). Statistical heterogeneity between
studies was assessed with the use of Cochran’s Q test.
We calculated HRs of pancreatic cancer that were associated
with 100-g/d and 12-oz (336 g/d) increments in the consumption
of sweet beverages, total soft drinks, juices and nectars, and,
when available, sugar-sweetened soft drinks and artificially
sweetened soft drinks. We also modeled exposure variables that
were categorized into nonconsumers (consumption: 0 g/d) and
cohort-wide quintiles in consumers. To allow for comparison
with previous studies, we also used alternative categorizations of
consumption (i.e., 0.0, 0.1–124.9, 125.0–249.9, or $250.0 g/d or
,1 glass/mo, 1–4 glasses/mo, .1–6 glasses/wk, or $1 glass/d).
Because effect sizes and significance levels were comparable,
we have not presented these analyses.
Tests for linear trend were conducted in consumers only. The
median consumption within a quintile was assigned to all people
within that quintile and entered as a continuous term in the Cox
models.
Restricted cubic splines with 3 knots (fifth, 50th, and 95th
percentiles of the distribution of exposure variables) (22) showed
that all associations could be assumed to be linear (see Sup-
plemental Figure 2 for the association with juice and nectar
consumption; other models are not shown). Therefore, our in-
terpretation focuses on the continuous models.
We ran both minimally adjusted (stratified for sex, age, and
center) and multivariable-adjusted models, which were controlled
for alcohol consumption as a continuous variable and educational
level, physical activity, and smoking status as categorical variables

 with an additional category for missing values. Models on total
soft-drink consumption and juice and nectar consumption were
mutually adjusted. Models on sugar-sweetened and artificially
sweetened soft-drink consumption were mutually adjusted and
adjusted for juice and nectar consumption. Models were further
adjusted for energy intake [continuously, with the use of the
standard model for energy adjustment (23), self-reported type 2
diabetes, and BMI (in kg/m2); these variables are shown sepa-
rately because these factors could intermediate or confound the
association between sweet-beverage consumption and pancreatic
cancer]. Red meat, fruit and vegetables, dietary sugar, coffee, and
folate intakes did not materially alter the effect size of the asso-
ciations and, therefore, were not included in the final Cox models.
Adjustment for weight and height or waist circumference instead
of BMI did not appreciably change the HRs. The same effect
applied after adjustment for the intensity and duration of smoking
instead of smoking status. Therefore, these variables were not
used in the models.
In sensitivity analyses, we excluded the first 2 and 5 y of
follow-up to minimize any potential effect of subclinical pan-
creatic cancers on sweet-beverage consumption. These analyses
were carried out as 2 different sensitivity analyses. We also
focused on histologically confirmed pancreatic cancer as an
outcome (n = 608) and repeated our analyses in nonpatients with
diabetes to minimize any influence of possible dietary changes
related to a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. We also examined the
associations after the exclusion of participants who were obese
(BMI .30) at baseline to minimize reverse-causation bias.
Effect modifications by age at diagnosis (,62 and $62 y; i.e.,
the mean age in the study), sex, BMI (,25 and $25), waist
circumference (normal or moderate: ,102 cm in men and ,88 cm
in women; and large: $102 cm in men and $88 cm in
women), physical activity (combining inactive and moderately
inactive in low and moderately active and active in high), and
smoking status (never, former, and current smokers) were ex-
amined by including cross-product terms along with the main
effect terms in the adjusted plus BMI, type 2 diabetes, and en-
ergy intake Cox models and with the use of likelihood ratio
tests.
All statistical analyses were performed with Stata 10.0 soft-
ware (StataCorp LP). P , 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics according to categories of consump-
tion are shown in Table 1 (total soft drinks), Supplemental
Table 1 (sweet-beverage consumption), Supplemental Table 2
(juice and nectar consumption), Supplemental Table 3 (sugar-
sweetened soft drinks), and Supplemental Table 4 (artificially
sweetened soft drinks). Fruit and vegetable intake decreased
across quintiles of soft-drink consumption. In contrast, total
energy, total carbohydrates, sugar, total fat, and coffee and tea
intakes increased across quintiles of soft-drink consumption.
Compared with the first quintile of soft-drinks intake, partici-
pants in the fifth quintile had higher height and weight but
similar BMI, waist circumference, and self-reported type 2 di-
abetes. Participants with high soft-drink consumption were more
likely to be men, less educated, and less physically active.
Comparable dietary patterns were seen across juice and nectar
quintiles. However, BMI, waist circumference, and the percent-
age of self-reported type 2 diabetes appeared to be lower in high
consumers of juices and nectars.
HRs (95% CIs) for pancreatic cancer according to types and
amount of sweet-beverage consumption are shown in Table 2.
Total soft-drink consumption was not associated with pancreatic
cancer risk. No consistent trend was seen for the association
between total sweet-beverage quintiles and pancreatic cancer.
However, the consumption of juices and nectars was inversely
associated with pancreatic cancer. Adjustment for BMI, self-
reported type 2 diabetes, and total energy intake did not mate-
rially change HR estimates.
Table 3 shows overall and stratified associations between 100-
g/d increment of sweet-beverage consumption and pancreatic
cancer. Supplemental Table 5 shows these associations per 336
g/d (12 oz). As in Table 2, an inverse association between juice
and nectar consumption and pancreatic cancer was observed.
Soft-drink intakes, of both sugar-sweetened soft-drinks and ar-
tificially sweetened soft drinks, were not significantly associated
with pancreatic cancer risk. HRs did not change after additional
adjustment for total energy intake, type 2 diabetes, and BMI.
The association with artificially sweetened soft-drink con-
sumption was modified by sex (P = 0.004), and a positive sig-
nificant association was detected in women (HR: 1.09; 95% CI:
1.03, 1.15).
The association with sugar-sweetened soft-drink consumption
was modified by waist circumference (P = 0.035). The HR was
higher in subjects with a normal or moderate waist circumfer-
ence than in those with a large waist circumference, but these
HRs were NS within strata.
HRs did not materially change after the exclusion of the first
2 or 5 y of follow-up or of participants with obesity (BMI $30).
The consideration of only nonpatients with diabetes yielded
almost the same HRs (data not shown).
Supplemental Figures 3–7 show HRs (95% CIs) of pan-
creatic cancer associated with a 100-g/d increment of sweet-
beverage consumption types by country. There was no evidence
of heterogeneity by country on the association of consumption
of sweet beverages (I2 = 0.0%, P-heterogeneity = 0.98), soft
drinks (I2 = 0.0%, P-heterogeneity = 0.95), sugar-sweetened soft
drinks (I2 = 0.0%, P-heterogeneity = 0.65), and artificially
sweetened soft drinks (I2 = 0.0%, P-heterogeneity = 0.66) with
pancreatic cancer, whereas the association with juice and
nectar consumption was slightly heterogeneous (I2 = 30.5%,
P-heterogeneity = 0.17).
DISCUSSION
This analysis was conducted in the EPIC cohort, which is
a European study of participants with diverse dietary patterns and
sweet-beverage consumption, and did not provide evidence that
the consumption of soft drinks is associated with pancreatic
cancer. However, our findings suggest that the consumption of
juices and nectars might be associated with modest decreased
pancreatic cancer risk.
Previous evidence on the association between soft-drink
consumption and pancreatic cancer has been inconsistent (3, 10,
11). In a pooled analysis of 14 cohort studies on 853,984 indi-
viduals including 2185 incident pancreatic cancer cases, a modest
positive association was reported between sugar-sweetened,
carbonated soft-drink consumption and pancreatic cancer risk

1Different types of sweet-beverage consumption were categorized in nondrinkers (consumption: 0 g/d) and as cohort-wide quintiles in drinkers (consumption .0 g/d). Minimally adjusted models were
stratified by center, sex, and age at recruitment in 1-y categories. Multivariable-adjusted models were stratified as for minimally adjusted models and adjusted for educational level (no degree or primary school
completed, technical or professional school completed, secondary school completed, university degree, or not specified or missing), physical activity (active, moderately active, moderately inactive, inactive, or
missing), smoking status (never, former, current, or missing), and alcohol consumption (g/d). Juices and nectars and soft drinks (g/d) were mutually adjusted, and sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened soft
drinks were also mutually adjusted plus additional adjustment for juice consumption. P values were obtained with the use of a trend test. D, diabetes; EPIC, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and

SWEET-BEVERAGE CONSUMPTION AND PANCREATIC CANCER

 (HR for every 177.5-g/d increase = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.12)
(10). A meta-analysis of 6 prospective cohorts (3) reported un-
explained heterogeneous results on the continuous scale although
the summary RR suggested a positive nonsignificant association
(RR for every 200-mL/d increase in soft-drink consumption:
1.22; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.51). The World Cancer Research Fund/
American Institute for Cancer Research Continuous Update
Panel judged the evidence for an association between soft drinks
and pancreatic cancer as limited (3).
We observed a borderline inverse association for juice and
nectar consumption with pancreatic cancer risk, which was of
a similar magnitude to that observed in a meta-analysis on fruit-
juice consumption and pancreatic cancer (3) that included a total
of 1735 pancreatic cancer cases from 2 studies conducted in
Europe, 2 pancreatic cancer cases in Asia, and 1 pancreatic
cancer case in the United States, but this association did not reach
significance. The summary RR for every 200-mL/d increase in
fruit juice was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.13) in the meta-analysis (3),
whereas we observed an HR per 200-mL/d increase in fruit juice
of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.97) (the model was stratified by center,
sex, and age and adjusted for education, physical activity, smok-
ing status, alcohol consumption, and soft-drink consumption).
Our findings were not mediated by energy intake, type 2 diabetes,
or BMI.
Juice and nectar consumption might prevent pancreatic cancer
through the high contents of antioxidants, minerals, fiber, flavo-
noids, and polyphenols in juice and nectars, which might reduce
oxidative DNA damage and genetic mutations (24, 25). In the
EPIC, plasma concentrations of b-carotene, zeaxanthin, and
a-tocopherol were inversely associated with pancreatic cancer
risk (26). The same result applied to a-tocopherol (27) and ly-
copene (28) in 2 other prospective cohort studies. However, in
the EPIC, correlations of plasma concentrations of a-carotene,
b-carotene, a-tocopherol, lutein, zeaxanthin, b-cryptoxanthin,
lycopene, folate, and vitamin C with juice and nectar consump-
tion and total soft-drink consumption were virtually absent (r ,
0.15); hence, it is unlikely that the antioxidant contents of juices
and nectars may explain the observed association.
The observed inverse association between juice and nectar
consumption and pancreatic cancer should be interpreted with

 caution; juices and nectars are usually rich in added sugars and
fructose, which could potentially increase pancreatic cancer risk
(29). However, the correlation between juice and nectar con-
sumption and sugar of 0.29 in the EPIC suggests that juice and
nectar consumption represents mostly juice with no added sugars.
We could not elude that our association may have been due to
chance in part because other studies (including the EPIC) did not
find an inverse association between fruit consumption and pan-
creatic cancer (3, 22, 30). Also, it might have been possible that the
observed inverse association between juice and nectar consumption
and pancreatic cancer was due to residual confounding because the
high consumers of juices and nectars in this population tended to be
slimmer and were less likely to be diabetic; nevertheless, we ad-
justed for these variables that were measured at baseline with no
considerable changes in the effect estimate. Studies with detailed
information on different types of juices are needed to confirm the
associations of these juices with pancreatic cancer.
Strengths of our study include its prospective design that
minimized recall and selection biases and the high number of
histologically confirmed pancreatic cancers. We were able to
evaluate the association between different types of sweet bev-
erages and pancreatic cancer in a European population with
a varied range of consumption and control for a large number of
possible confounders. The study size allowed us to evaluate effect
modifications and perform sensitivity analyses.
Limitations of our study include the single assessment of diet
and anthropometric measures and our inability to differentiate
between beverages with or without added sugars. Measurement
errors in self-reported dietary data may have biased estimated
diet-disease relations and reduced the statistical power to detect
a dietary effect despite the use of validated dietary question-
naires and adjustment for energy. As with any observational
study, residual confounding could not be totally ruled out.
In conclusion, in this large prospective cohort study, no soft-drink
category was associated with pancreatic cancer. However, increased
juice and nectar consumption was modestly associated with de-
creased risk of pancreatic cancer. Future studies that are sufficiently
sampled should be conducted to confirm our findings and to ex-
amine the association between juice consumption and pancreatic
cancer by distinguishing juices with added sugar from those without.
