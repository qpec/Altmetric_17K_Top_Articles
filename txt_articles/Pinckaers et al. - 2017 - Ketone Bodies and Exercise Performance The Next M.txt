Abstract Elite athletes and coaches are in a constant
search for training methods and nutritional strategies to
support training and recovery efforts that may ultimately
maximize athletes’ performance. Recently, there has been a
re-emerging interest in the role of ketone bodies in exercise
metabolism, with considerable media speculation about
ketone body supplements being routinely used by profes-
sional cyclists. Ketone bodies can serve as an important
energy substrate under certain conditions, such as starva-
tion, and can modulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.
Dietary strategies to increase endogenous ketone body
availability (i.e., a ketogenic diet) require a diet high in
lipids and low in carbohydrates for *4 days to induce
nutritional ketosis. However, a high fat, low carbohydrate
ketogenic diet may impair exercise performance via
reducing the capacity to utilize carbohydrate, which forms
a key fuel source for skeletal muscle during intense
endurance-type exercise. Recently, ketone body supple-
ments (ketone salts and esters) have emerged and may be
used to rapidly increase ketone body availability, without
the need to first adapt to a ketogenic diet. However, the
extent to which ketone bodies regulate skeletal muscle
bioenergetics and substrate metabolism during prolonged
endurance-type exercise of varying intensity and duration
remains unknown. Therefore, at present there are no data
available to suggest that ingestion of ketone bodies during
exercise improves athletes’ performance under conditions
where evidence-based nutritional strategies are applied
appropriately.
Key Points
There is increasing interest in ketogenic diets and the
use of ketone body supplements within the athletic
community.
Ketone bodies represent an alternative energy
substrate, and may alter substrate metabolism under
certain conditions such as starvation and after
supplementation.
Our current understanding of ketone body kinetics
during exercise is insufficient to warrant their use as
an ergogenic aid in any practical sports setting.
1 Introduction
Nutrients consumed before and during exercise training
can support optimal performance by delaying the onset of
fatigue and assisting in the recovery process by replen-

Particularly
for
endurance-type sports characterized by high rates, and
absolute levels of energy expenditure, appropriate nutrient
intake is essential to fuel exercise, delay the deterioration
in performance, and promote post-exercise recovery [1–5].

 alternative fueling strategies based on adaptation to a high-
fat carbohydrate-restricted diet increase fat oxidation dur-
ing exercise and, as such, may help to spare the body’s
limited glycogen stores [7]. Although the focus of fat-based
fueling strategies has been to enhance the capacity for fat
oxidation during exercise, extreme carbohydrate restriction
(e.g., \
50 g/day) [8] also increases the production of
ketone bodies, which may provide an additional energy
substrate for the brain and skeletal muscle tissue [9, 10].
Recently, the ingestion of ketone body supplements has
emerged as an alternative strategy to induce hyperketone-
mia [11], with considerable media speculation about ketone
body supplements being used by professional cyclists [12].
This article will discuss what is currently known regarding
ketone bodies within the context of exercise metabolism
and performance, with an emphasis on the proposed use of
ketone body supplements to improve exercise performance.
2 What are Ketone Bodies?
Ketone bodies are lipid-derived organic compounds that
can serve as a circulating energy source for tissues during
starvation/fasting or prolonged exercise [13]. Under phys-
iological conditions in which ample carbohydrate is
available, or after an overnight fast, circulating ketone
body concentrations are relatively low (*0.1–0.5 mmol/L)
[14, 15]. However, under conditions of limited carbohy-
drate availability such as starvation (i.e., depletion of
muscle and liver glycogen stores), fatty acid mobilization
from adipose tissue is increased as a means to supply
energy. Under these circumstances, some of the acetyl-
CoA derived from fatty acids is converted to ketone bodies
via hepatic mitochondria (up to *150 g/day) [16, 17]. The
ketone body acetoacetate (AcAc) can subsequently be
enzymatically converted to b-hydroxybutyrate (b-OHB) or
spontaneously degraded to acetone which is less abundant
[13]. For clarification, although the term ‘‘ketone bodies’’
refers to the compounds AcAc, b-OHB, and acetone which
are derived from acetyl-CoA, only AcAc and acetone are
actual ‘‘ketones’’ containing a carbonyl group with two
hydrocarbon atoms. b-OHB is a ketone body, but is tech-
nically not a ketone since one of its hydrocarbon atoms is
replaced by a hydroxyl group [18]. While the majority of
acetone is secreted through urine and lost via expiration,
AcAc and b-OHB are transported in the bloodstream to
extrahepatic tissues with a high metabolic demand such as
the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. Ketone bodies cross
the plasma and mitochondrial membranes by monocar-
boxylate transporters and are converted back to acetyl-CoA
and used as an alternative source of energy by the tricar-
boxylic acid (TCA) cycle [13, 14, 19]. In addition to
serving as an alternative energy substrate, ketone bodies
play an important role in the regulation of skeletal muscle
substrate utilization [14], cellular signaling and transcrip-
tion [13, 20], and may have various therapeutic implica-
tions (for a review on that topic see Veech [16] and Hashim
and VanItallie [21]).
3 Availability of Ketone Bodies
3.1 Hyperketonemia from Endogenous Origin
After an overnight fast endogenous ketone body production
amounts to *0.25 mmol/min (or *35 g/24 h) resulting in
relatively low circulating ketone body concentrations
(*0.1–0.5 mmol/L) [22–24]. However, with prolonged
fasting/starvation (*5 days), the rate of ketone body pro-
duction reaches levels of *1–2 mmol/min (or 140–280
g/24 h) [23, 24], corresponding to a plasma concentration
of *7–10 mmol/L. Beyond 5 days without food, plasma
ketone body concentrations plateau and rarely exceed *10
mmol/L [22]. This upper limit of ketonemia has been
suggested to be the result of an inherent feedback mecha-
nism by which ketone bodies inhibit their own production
via exerting an insulinotropic [25–27] and anti-lipolytic
effect [28] (for a review on this topic, see Balasse and Fe
´ry
[22] and Balasse [29]). Outside of prolonged fasting/star-
vation a ketogenic diet can increase circulating ketone
body concentrations to *1–2 mmol/L after 2–4 days
[30, 31]. Typical ketogenic diets are characterized by high
fat (*80 % of daily energy intake), low carbohydrate
(*20–50 g/day or *5 % of daily energy intake), and
moderate to relatively low protein intake (*15 % of daily
energy intake) [9, 32]. However, the level of ketonemia
induced via a ketogenic diet is largely dependent on the
amount of carbohydrate ingested and can reach *7–8
mmol/L following sustained periods of severe carbohydrate
intake restriction (i.e., keto adaptation) [9].
Next to dietary interventions, prolonged physical exer-
cise performed in the fasted state also stimulates ketogen-
esis during exercise [33–35] and results in post-exercise
hyperketonemia [22, 34–38]. For example, ketone body
concentrations can reach *0.5–1.0 mmol/L in response to
2 h of exercise performed in an overnight fasted state [33]
and can subsequently increase to *1–4 mmol/L during
early post-exercise recovery [22, 34–38]. The extent of
exercise-induced hyperketonemia during and after exercise
is influenced by the intensity and duration of the exercise
performed as well as the nutritional status [22, 35, 38, 39].
For example, carbohydrate intake in close temporal prox-
imity to exercise strongly attenuates the exercise induced
increase
in
plasma
ketone
body
concentrations
384

123
 [22, 35, 38–41]. Interestingly, well-trained individuals
demonstrate an attenuated rise in plasma ketone body
concentrations during and after exercise when compared to
untrained individuals [34, 36, 37]. This has been attributed
to a training mediated attenuation in the post-exercise
increase in free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations [34, 36],
and/or to increased activity of the enzymes involved in
ketone body utilization [42, 43].
Evaluating ketone body kinetics in an overnight fasted
state [44–46] or in response to prolonged fasting/starvation
[33, 47–49] is of little practical relevance to endurance
athletes seeking to apply optimal fueling strategies for
competition. Furthermore, although ketogenic diets have
been
proposed
to
benefit
various
types
of
athletes
[9, 10, 32], induction of nutritional ketosis via a ketogenic
diet is dependent upon the depletion of hepatic and muscle
glycogen reserves, thereby increasing circulating FFA and
endogenous ketone body production [50]. However, a high
fat, low carbohydrate ketogenic diet may reduce the
capacity to utilize carbohydrate [51], thereby compromis-
ing exercise training intensity [8] and limiting exercise
performance [52–54], particularly during moderate to high-
intensity exercise activities, such as marathon running and
hill climbs, sprints, and accelerations during a cycling race
[55]. Therefore, orally ingested ketone body supplements
may represent a more practical alternative to increase cir-
culating ketone body concentrations in athletes [11, 15]
since they do not require adherence to a high fat, low
carbohydrate ketogenic diet to induce ketosis.
3.2 Hyperketonemia from Exogenous Origin
Since the 1960s, studies examining the effects of exoge-
nously provided ketone bodies have utilized ketone body
salts administered either intravenously [47, 56–61] or
orally [37]. Currently commercially available ketone body
supplements (salts) provide *8–12 g of b-OHB and *1 g
of sodium per serving, and serve as a means to rapidly
increase circulating ketone body availability. Recently,
ketone esters [i.e., (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybu-
tyrate] have emerged as a more practical and applicable
way to increase the availability of blood ketone bodies
[15, 62–64]. Following ingestion, ketone esters [i.e., ketone
monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] are
cleaved in the gut and absorbed via the gut epithelium and
monocarboxylate transporters
into the
circulation, or
undergo first-pass metabolism in the liver to ketone bodies
[11]. In comparison to starvation and/or a ketogenic diet
which can take days to elicit a robust increase in ketone
body concentrations, ingestion of ketone body supplements
can rapidly increase plasma ketone body concentrations,
reaching peak levels within 1–2 h [15, 62]. Plasma ketone
body concentrations may increase to *3 mmol/L 1 h after
ingestion of *400 mg of the ketone ester per kg body
weight [31, 45, 46] or alternatively reach similar concen-
trations 10 min after ingesting *600 mg/kg body weight,
eventually resulting in plasma ketone body concentrations
of *6 mmol/L 45 min after ingestion [47].
Although ketone body supplements may induce a state
of
hyperketonemia,
the
ketone
body
concentrations
achieved following ingestion appear to be influenced by
concomitant food intake [41]. In this regard, recent data
published in abstract form [41] reported that postprandial
ketone body concentrations following ingestion of a ketone
ester supplement (395 mg/kg body weight) were strongly
influenced by baseline nutritional status. Specifically, an
attenuated increase in peak plasma b-OHB concentrations
(fed: 2.1 ± 0.2 mmol/L vs. fasted: 3.1 ± 0.1 mmol/L), and
a 60 % reduction in b-OHB area under the curve was
demonstrated when the ketone esters were ingested after
consumption of a mixed meal when compared to con-
sumption under fasted (post-absorptive) conditions [41].
These findings suggest that co-ingestion of ketone esters
with other nutrients may impact gastric emptying and/or
tissue uptake of the ingested ketone bodies. This finding
may have implications regarding the effectiveness of
ketone ester supplementation in athletes, who ingest large
amounts of carbohydrate during a competitive event and
adapt their nutrient intake during competition according to
their specific nutritional needs [65]. Alternatively, whether
ketone body supplementation impacts or compromises the
intake of other important substrates, such as carbohydrate,
may be an important consideration for endurance athletes
who often struggle to ingest adequate amounts of carbo-
hydrate during competition [66]. Finally, an additional
consideration is how ketone body intake during exercise is
tolerated by athletes. Normal healthy subjects, consuming
714 mg/kg of a milk-based ketone ester drink three times a
day, were reported to experience feelings of discomfort,
including abdominal distention and headaches [15]. How-
ever, it should be noted that the milk-based test drink
volume amounted to 1.1 L per serving, making it difficult
to differentiate between the effects of the ketone esters per
se and simply the volume of the drinks that were ingested
[15].
4 Factors Influencing Ketone Body Utilization
Although ketone bodies may serve as an alternative
oxidative fuel source, factors including tissue type (i.e.,
skeletal muscle vs. brain) [22, 58], exercise/training status
[34,
36–38],
circulating
ketone
body
concentrations
[33, 58], and skeletal muscle fiber type (i.e., type I vs. type

123
 II muscle fibers) [42, 43] have been shown to influence
ketone body metabolism. For example, reduced ketone
body uptake and oxidation rates were observed by skeletal
muscle when compared to the brain when assessed under
resting conditions [58]. Specifically, although ketone body
uptake and oxidation by the brain appears to be linearly
related to circulating ketone body concentrations, ketone
body uptake by skeletal muscle is much lower than that
observed by the brain and demonstrates saturation in
ketone body uptake between plasma concentrations of
*0.8–1.7 mmol/L [58]. This finding supports earlier work
[22] demonstrating that while skeletal muscle is able to
extract *50 % of circulating ketone bodies when con-
centrations are low (0.1–0.5 mmol/L), this uptake capacity
is reduced to only *5 % when concentrations reach *6–7
mmol/L [22]. However, exercise may increase ketone body
uptake, as recent pilot data [58] and preliminary reports
[67] suggest that exercise increases the absolute rate of
ketone body uptake and oxidation by skeletal muscle
[58, 67]. In addition, ketone body uptake during exercise
may also be influenced by the extent of hyperketonemia
[33] and how it is induced [45]. For example, when
hyperketonemia is induced by short-term starvation, the
exercise-induced
increase
in
ketone
body
uptake
is
diminished when plasma concentrations exceed *3–4
mmol/L [33], indicating saturation of ketone body uptake
during exercise. However, 2 h of treadmill exercise at 50 %
of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was shown to stim-
ulate ketone body uptake at the whole-body level when
hyperketonemia
(*5.5–6
mmol/L)
was
induced
via
exogenously provided ketone bodies in subjects studied in
the overnight fasted state, but not in subjects who achieved
a similar level of hyperketonemia induced by short-term
starvation [45]. Another investigation [68] reported that
ketone body oxidation rates increased *three- to fivefold
during 30 min of cycling exercise at 60 % VO2max in
subjects
who
had
undergone
short-term
starvation.
Specifically, ketone body oxidation rates increased from
*0.44 mmol/min at rest to *2.1 mmol/min (or *13 g/h)
over the initial stages of exercise, but subsequently
decreased to *1.4 mmol/min (or *9 g/h). Based on the
heat of combustion of the ketone body b-OHB (*19.6 kJ)
[16], ketone bodies provided *85–125 kJ of energy over
30 min of exercise as compared to *27 kJ during 30 min
of rest. Further studies are required to confirm these
observations by supplementing
ketone
bodies during
exercise of different duration and intensity to athletes
adhering to evidence based fueling strategies.
In addition to differences in ketone body uptake and
oxidation rates between various tissues and in response to
exercise, studies in rodents have demonstrated that differ-
ent skeletal muscle fiber types possess different activity
levels of the enzymes involved in the utilization of ketone
bodies [42, 43]. For example, oxidative muscle fibers have
been reported to express higher activity levels of 3-hy-
droxybutyrate dehydrogenase, 3-ketoacid CoA-transferase,
and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase when compared to glycolytic
muscle fibers [43]. In addition, endurance type exercise
training has been suggested to increase the capacity of
skeletal muscle to oxidize ketone bodies [42, 43, 69–74]. In
this respect, endurance type exercise training has been
shown to increase the activity of enzymes involved in
ketone body metabolism and to attenuate the increase in
circulating ketone body concentrations during exercise and
post-exercise recovery [42, 43, 72–74]. Therefore, well-
trained athletes might be better endowed to utilize ketone
bodies as a fuel source [72] and may express a different
metabolic response to increased ketone body concentra-
tions compared to that of moderately trained or untrained
subjects. However, the few studies that have directly
assessed human skeletal muscle [75, 76] or whole body
[33, 45, 47, 48, 61] ketone body uptake and/or oxidation
rates during exercise have all been performed in untrained
subjects.
5 Ketone Body Supplements and Exercise
Performance
Ketone body supplements have drawn attention as a prac-
tical means to induce nutritional ketosis that may have
ergogenic effects based on the function of ketone bodies as
an alternative and efficient oxidative fuel source, and their
capacity to modulate carbohydrate [58], lipid [77], and
protein [78, 79] metabolism. Furthermore, as ketone bodies
can serve as an alternative fuel for the brain and have been
associated with improved cognitive function in patient
groups (i.e., Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease,
epilepsy) [16, 19, 80, 81], ketone bodies have been sug-
gested to enhance performance in endurance athletes via
decreases in central (i.e., neural brain) fatigue and
improved cognitive functioning [10].
5.1 Ketone Bodies as an Alternative Fuel Source
Ketone bodies have been reported to improve metabolic
efficiency (i.e., energetic performance) in animal models
[82], primarily through mechanisms involving alternations
in glycolytic intermediates and enhanced mitochondrial
energetics [16, 82]. Specifically, data obtained from
rodents demonstrated a 28 % increase in cardiac efficiency
(work in J/mol O2 consumed) in response to combined
glucose ? ketone body (5 mmol/L) administration when
compared to glucose alone [82]. The reason for this
increase in efficiency has been explained by the higher heat
of combustion per C2 inherent in b-OHB as compared to
386
P. J. M. Pinckaers et al.
123
 carbohydrate derived substrates [16], which is of impor-
tance when considering the potential of different mito-
chondrial
substrates
on
energetic
performance.
For
example, the higher heat of combustion of b-OHB versus
pyruvate means that it has the potential to supply more
energy to the electron transport chain [16]. As highlighted
by Veech [16], pyruvate would liberate *777 kJ/mole of
C2 units if combusted in a bomb calorimeter, whereas b-
OHB would liberate *1019 kJ/mole of C2 units [16].
Although these findings may provide a rationale to support
an ergogenic effect of ketone bodies, there are currently
limited human data available on the effects of ketone
bodies on exercise metabolism [33, 45, 47, 48, 61] and
performance [62] in vivo.
5.2 Influence of Ketone Bodies on Carbohydrate
Metabolism
The influence of ketone bodies on fuel metabolism during
exercise is unclear, in part because much of the available
information on ketone body kinetics has been obtained
from subjects subjected to prolonged fasting/starvation
[33, 47, 48, 61]. Ketone bodies can be readily oxidized as a
fuel source by skeletal muscle during exercise [68], and
have a similar respiratory quotient to that of glucose (AcAc
= 1.0, b-OHB = 0.89) if completely oxidized. By serving as
an alternative fuel substrate, ketone bodies may reduce the
reliance on glucose utilization and spare endogenous
glycogen stores [11]. Alternatively, ketone bodies may
compromise endogenous carbohydrate availability via
inhibition of hepatic glucose output [58–60] and/or a
reduction in pyruvate and lactate oxidation resulting from
inhibition
of
pyruvate
dehydrogenase
activity
[46, 51, 58, 83–86] (for a review see Robinson and Wil-
liamson [14]). Therefore, although carbohydrate sparing
may benefit endurance performance, it may be hypothe-
sized that ketone body supplementation during exercise
reduces carbohydrate oxidation, thereby lowering the
capacity to sustain higher intensity efforts [87]. The vast
majority of Olympic sports require relatively short-dura-
tion, high-intensity efforts. Although these sports are
highly dependent on carbohydrate metabolism to sustain
high intensity exercise performance, glycogen levels are
unlikely to become depleted due to the short duration of
competition. Therefore, supplementing ketone bodies as a
means to spare carbohydrate utilization in these sports may
be irrelevant. The proposed ergogenic effect of ketone
bodies when utilized in these sports might be related to the
proposed fuel efficiency of ketone bodies. On the other
hand, sports such as triathlon and cycling are generally
classified as endurance events characterized by high levels
of oxidative metabolism in which carbohydrate availability
is a major factor limiting performance. For such endurance
events, ketone bodies have been proposed to be beneficial
to support exercise performance [11]. However, road race
cycling also includes repeated sprints and periods of
increased workload that exceed an athlete’s maximal aer-
obic power [88, 89]. These periods of increased exercise
intensity often determine the eventual race outcome. Under
such conditions, a reduction in glycolytic capacity may
compromise an athlete’s specific energy needs during
competition. In addition to altering acute exercise meta-
bolism, ketone bodies may augment post-exercise recovery
by facilitating the replenishment of muscle glycogen [84].
A recent preliminary report [90] showed that ingestion of a
ketone ester beverage resulting in plasma b-OHB concen-
trations of *5.3 mmol/L, increased glucose disposal *33
% and muscle glycogen content *50 % versus a control
beverage after exhaustive exercise [90]. Research is war-
ranted to determine whether the possible benefits of
ketone-mediated
carbohydrate
sparing
outweigh
the
potential adverse effects on the maintenance of high
intensity exercise performance (Fig. 1).
5.3 Influence of Ketone Bodies on Fat Metabolism
In addition to altering carbohydrate metabolism, recent data
presented in abstract form reported that in comparison to
ingestion of carbohydrate, ingestion of combined ketone
esters and carbohydrate decreased the respiratory quotient
during exercise and decreased intramuscular triacylglycerol
(IMTAG) content following 2 h of intense endurance exercise
[40]. A greater reliance on endogenous fat sources for energy
provision during prolonged exercise could be hypothesized to
spare endogenous glycogen stores, thereby improving per-
formance capacity. However, ketone bodies have also been
showntoreducecirculatoryFFAavailabilityvia inhibitingthe
lipolytic effect of catecholamines [28], and/or via stimulation
of hyperinsulinemia, which subsequently reduces lipolysis
[25]. Fe
´ry and Balasse [45] reported that the intravenous
administration of ketone bodies during exercise attenuated the
exercise-mediated increase in circulating FFA and glycerol
availability, suggesting that ketone bodies may have sup-
pressed the lipolytic effect of exercise [45]. More recently, b-
OHB has been demonstrated to inhibit adipocyte lipolysis
in vitro via the nicotinic acid receptor protein upregulated in
macrophages by interferon-c (PUMA-G/HM74a) [91]. Col-
lectively, ketone body supplementation may provide an
alternative fuel source for working skeletal muscle and alter
fuel selection during exercise. However, whether ketone
bodies ‘‘spare’’ carbohydrate reserves or impair carbohydrate
utilization during higher intensity exercise is unclear. Simi-
larly, whether supplementation with ketone bodies can
increasethe utilizationofIMTAGasfuelorattenuate lipolysis
and the availability of FFA during exercise remains to be
elucidated (Fig. 1).

 6 Ketone Bodies in Elite Sports Performance:
Focus on Cycling
Although ketone bodies could act as an ergogenic aid for elite
endurance athletes whose performance is determined by
substrate availability, limited (published) evidence to sup-
port this proposed benefit makes advocating the use of such a
novel supplement to elite athletes challenging. Supplemen-
tation with the recently developed ketone ester drink
demonstrates elevated blood ketone body concentrations,
with preliminary data indicating altered substrate utilization
[40, 92]. When attempting to translate these findings to elite
sports performance it is important to consider the practicality
of using such a supplement as well as acknowledge any
potential negative effects on performance. Timing, dosage,
and palatability are important factors to consider when pro-
moting a novel nutritional supplement to elite athletes.
Additionally, a comprehensive understanding of the com-
plete metabolic response to ingesting a ketone ester supple-
ment prior to or during endurance performance is essential
(Fig. 1). The metabolic demands of endurance sports alone
can be highly variable from even paced marathon running
and time trial performance to more stochastic intensity
observed with biathlon and professional road cycling
[88, 89]. Thus, any variation in substrate utilization during
performance should be fully understood before attempting to
intervene. Current evidence to support the ergogenic effects
of a ketone ester supplement is obtainedfrom data reportedin
a patent application filed in April 2013. The application of a

ingestion with other nutrients (i.e., carbohydrate). These factors may

Increased concentrations of ketone bodies during exercise can
increase their utilization by tissues such as skeletal muscle and brain.

 prior to exercise in a fasted state subsequently resulted in
modest improvements in 30-min rowing performance (av-
eraging *1 % and up to *2 %) in 22 elite and sub-elite
heavy and lightweight male and female rowers. [62]. How-
ever, it is difficult to extrapolate these findings to more
prolonged, variable intensity endurance type exercise sports
such as cycling during which typical competition duration
can range from 1–6 h and where exercise bouts are often
repeated over multiple days [89]. Furthermore, when eval-
uating the ergogenic potential of a nutritional supplement it
is important to take into account the day-to-day variability in
athletic performance for a given event [93]. Performance
improvements in response to a supplement that are within the
coefficient of variation observed for a specific sporting
event/performance test should be interpreted with caution.
Professional cyclists typically rely on carbohydrate
supplements during prolonged multiday stage races such as
the Tour de France [65, 94]. In this respect, a reduction in
the reliance on carbohydrate metabolism by supplementing
ketone esters, may improve performance. For example,
retrieving carbohydrate supplements from support staff/
vehicles is time consuming, energy inefficient, and often
associated with risk of accident or poor positioning during
the race. Sparing endogenous carbohydrate stores would, in
theory, result in an increased performance capacity during
the key parts of the cycling races, e.g. the final hour climb
to a summit finish, during which carbohydrate is the
dominant substrate. Hypothetically, ketone body oxidation
may also permit
relatively higher exercise
intensity
throughout the whole competition in contrast to contribu-
tions from fat oxidation. However, until the metabolic
interactions of ketone ester supplementation with skeletal
muscle fuel selection during exercise are fully elucidated,
any proposed ergogenic properties remain theoretical.
7 Conclusion
Ketone bodies possess the ability to affect several physi-
ological processes. Previously it has been proposed that
ketone bodies can be utilized as an effective energy sub-
strate under certain conditions. As such, ketone bodies
have been suggested to have potential positive effects on
exercise metabolism and performance. Serving as an
alternative fuel source and sparing endogenous carbohy-
drate stores are among the proposed mechanisms by which
ketone bodies have been suggested to benefit endurance
exercise performance. Although ketone body supplemen-
tation has been proposed to be beneficial for endurance
athletes and ketone esters are speculated to be routinely
used by professional cyclists, to the best of our knowledge
there is currently limited information on the effects of
ketone body supplementation on exercise metabolism and
performance in recreational and/or elite athletes. Future
research should focus on elucidating the metabolic effects
of ketone body supplementation during exercise in athletes
who adhere to appropriate nutrient intake strategies rele-
vant for their respective sport and/or sports setting. Sub-
sequently,
many
questions
remain
to
be
answered,
including practical issues regarding the dose and timing of
the proposed ketone (ester) supplement, the interaction
with other substrates in various nutritional settings, and
their quantitative contribution as an energy substrate during
exercise of varying exercise intensity and duration. It will
be important to evaluate the kinetics of ketone body
availability in a sports-specific manner, tailored towards
the needs of the individual athlete. In conclusion, based
upon the few available data and our current understanding
of ketone body metabolism during exercise in a sports
specific setting, we conclude there is currently no evidence
to support the use of ketone bodies as an ergogenic aid
under conditions where optimal evidence based nutritional
strategies are applied.
