Abstract
The popularity of electronic (e-) cigarettes has greatly increased recently, particularly in 
adolescents. However, the extent of psychiatric comorbidity with adolescent e-cigarette use and 
dual use of conventional (combustible) and e-cigarettes is unknown. This study characterized 
psychiatric comorbidity in adolescent conventional and e-cigarette use. Ninth grade students 
attending high schools in Los Angeles, CA (M age=14) completed self-report measures of 
conventional/e-cigarette use, emotional disorders, substance use/problems, and transdiagnostic 
psychiatric phenotypes consistent with the NIMH-Research Domain Criteria Initiative. Outcomes 
were compared by lifetime use of: (1) neither conventional nor e-cigarettes (non-use; N=2557, 
77.3%); (2) e-cigarettes only (N=412, 12.4%); (3) conventional cigarettes only (N=152, 4.6%); 
and (4) conventional and e-cigarettes (dual use; N=189, 5.6%). In comparison to adolescents who 
used conventional cigarettes only, e-cigarette only users reported lower levels of internalizing 
syndromes (depression, generalized anxiety, panic, social phobia, and obsessive-compulsive 
disorder) and transdiagnostic phenotypes (i.e., distress intolerance, anxiety sensitivity, rash action 
during negative affect). Depression, panic disorder, and anhedonia were higher in e-cigarette only 
vs. non-users. For several externalizing outcomes (mania, rash action during positive affect, 
alcohol drug use/abuse) and anhedonia, an ordered pattern was observed, whereby comorbidity 
was lowest in non-users, moderate in single product users (conventional or e-cigarette), and

 highest in dual users. These findings: (1) raise question of whether emotionally-healthier (‘lower-
risk’) adolescents who are not interested in conventional cigarettes are being attracted to e-
cigarettes; (2) indicate that research, intervention, and policy dedicated to adolescent tobacco-
psychiatric comorbidity should distinguish conventional cigarette, e-cigarette, and dual use.

INTRODUCTION
Mid-adolescence is a vulnerable developmental period for cigarette smoking uptake, the 
onset of mental health conditions, and the emergence of comorbid tobacco use and mental 
health problems (Upadhyaya, Deas, Brady, & Kruesi, 2002). The over-representation of 
smoking among adolescents with mental health problems generalizes across various 
conditions (e.g., depressive, mania, anxiety, alcohol/drug use disorders), remains robust after 
controlling for confounders, and is mediated by theoretically-relevant factors suggesting a 
causal relation (e.g., beliefs that smoking has mood-modulating effects) (Audrain-
McGovern et al., 2012; Upadhyaya et al., 2002). The rapid emergence and appeal of novel 
tobacco and nicotine products such as electronic (e-) cigarettes raises the question as to 
whether the same adolescent subgroup with mental health problems is at risk for using these 
products (Cummins, Zhu, Tedeschi, Gamst, & Myers, 2014). This is important to address 
because this population may be particularly vulnerable to nicotine addiction, given that 
neural plasticity during adolescence and neuropathology in psychiatric conditions can 
enhance the brain’s sensitivity to nicotine (Balfour & Ridley, 2000; Counotte, Smit, Pattij, & 
Spijker, 2011; Sinha, 2008).
E-cigarettes—electronic devices that deliver inhaled nicotine emulate the sensorimotor 
properties of conventional (combustible) cigarettes—are gaining popularity among 
adolescents. According to 2014 estimates, past 30 day use of e-cigarettes is more common 
than conventional cigarettes among U.S. 8th- (9% vs. 4%) and 10th- (16% vs. 7%) graders, 
and many adolescent e-cigarette users have never tried conventional cigarettes (Johnston, 
O’Malley, Miech, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2015). E-cigarettes may be an attractive

 alternative to conventional cigarettes among youth because of beliefs that they are less 
harmful, addictive, malodorous, and costly than conventional cigarettes (Peters, Meshack, 
Lin, Hill, & Abughosh, 2013). Furthermore, e-cigarettes come in flavors appealing to youth 
and may be easier to obtain than conventional cigarettes because of inconsistent 
enforcement of restrictions against sales to minors (Collaco, Drummond, & McGrath-
Morrow, 2015). Such factors may facilitate e-cigarette initiation in adolescents who would 
not otherwise smoke conventional cigarettes and may perhaps have fewer risk factors for 
smoking (Wills, Knight, Williams, Pagano, & Sargent, 2015)—including mental health 
problems.
Dual use of conventional and e-cigarettes is also common in adolescents (Johnston et al., 
2015; Wills et al., 2015), raising the possibility that some adolescents may use e-cigarettes 
to substitute for conventional cigarettes in situations where smoking is restricted. Indeed, 
school bathrooms and staircases are among the most common places adolescents report 
using e-cigarettes (Peters et al., 2013). Given that adolescents with (vs. without) mental 
health symptoms are more prone to nicotine dependence (Upadhyaya et al., 2002), these 
populations could be more likely to initiate use of e-cigarettes to bridge situations when they 
are not able to smoke, which ultimately could perpetuate the over-representation of smoking 
among individuals with mental health problems.
While research has yet to characterize the psychiatric comorbidity with patterns of 
conventional and e-cigarette use in adolescents, a recent study of Hawaiian adolescents 
found that alcohol/marijuana use and other psychosocial risk factors (e.g., sensation seeking, 
rebelliousness, emotional/behavioral dysregulation) were highest in dual users, moderate in 
e-cigarette only users, and lowest in non-users (Wills et al., 2015). Most pairwise 
comparisons involving conventional cigarette only users were not significant in that study, 
perhaps limited by reduced statistical power due to the smaller size of this group (N=53) 
(Wills et al., 2015). Given these findings, stratification of psychiatric comorbidity across 
dual use, single-product use, and non-use in adolescents is plausible.
The current study characterized the mental health of adolescents who reported ever using e-
cigarettes, conventional cigarettes, both, or neither. To provide a wide-ranging picture of 
psychiatric comorbidity, traditional syndrome-based indices of various depressive, manic, 
anxiety, and substance use disorders were administered. Consistent with NIMH’s Research 
Domain Criteria Initiative (Insel et al., 2010), we also assessed several transdiagnostic 
phenotypes implicated in multiple internalizing and externalizing psychopathologies and 
conventional cigarette use (e.g., impulsivity, anhedonia, distress tolerance) (Leventhal & 
Zvolensky, 2015b). Up to this point, data on the psychiatric comorbidity associated with e-
cigarette and dual use is virtually absent, leaving unclear as to how the mental health of 
these two groups compare to conventional cigarette users and non-users. Given that 
conventional cigarettes and e-cigarettes have both similarities (e.g., the experience of 
inhaling aerosol/smoke, nicotine intake) and differences (e.g., e-cigarettes are perceived as 
less harmful than conventional cigarettes; (Ambrose et al., 2014)), whether the patterns of 
psychiatric comorbidity are similar or different between e-cigarette only users and 
conventional cigarette users is unclear. As the first study to comprehensively characterize 
psychiatric comorbidity in adolescent e-cigarette and dual use, this study may yield data that

 is important to tobacco policy by identifying adolescent populations that are psychiatrically 
vulnerable and potentially at risk for use of traditional and emerging tobacco products. Such 
data could highlight the need to protect psychiatrically vulnerable adolescents from tobacco 
product use take via targeted tobacco product regulation and behavioral health prevention 
programming for this populations.
METHODS
Participants and Procedure
This report is based on a cross-sectional survey of substance use and mental health among 
9th grade students enrolled in ten public high schools surrounding Los Angeles, CA, USA. 
The schools were recruited based on their adequate representation of diverse demographic 
characteristics. The percentage of students eligible for free lunch within each school (i.e., 
student’s parental income ≤ 185% of the national poverty level) on average across the ten 
schools was 31.1% (SD=19.7, range: 8.0% – 62.4%). Students not in special education (e.g., 
severe learning disabilities) or English as a Second Language programs were eligible 
(N=4100). Of the students who assented to participate (N=3,874; 94.5%), 3,383 (82.5%) 
provided active parental consent and enrolled in the study. In-classroom paper-and-pencil 
surveys were administered across two 60-minute data collections during the fall of 2013, 
conducted less than two weeks apart. Some students did not complete all questionnaires 
within the time allotted or were absent for data collections (n=73), leaving a final sample of 
3310. The University of Southern California Institutional Review Board approved the 
protocol.
Measures
Each study measure described below has shown good psychometric properties in previous 
adolescent samples (Audrain-McGovern et al., 2004; Bastiani et al., 2013; Eaton et al., 
2010; Johnston et al., 2015; Leventhal et al., 2015 in press; Martino, Grilo, & Fehon, 2000; 
Muris & Meesters, 2008; Pang, Farrahi, Glazier, Sussman, & Leventhal, 2015 in press; 
Wagner et al., 2006; White & Labouvie, 1989). Unless otherwise specified, a mean score per 
item composite was calculated and composites were scored such that higher scores reflect 
higher psychopathology.
Electronic Cigarettes, Conventional Cigarettes, and other Substance Use—
Using items derived from the Youth Behavior Risk Surveillance (Eaton et al., 2010) and 
Monitoring the Future (Johnston et al., 2015) Surveys, lifetime use of e-cigarettes (described 
as “electronic cigarettes, personal vaporizers; prevalence in this sample = 18.2%) and 
conventional cigarettes (10.3%) was measured, as well as these additional substances: 
marijuana (15.1%), one full drink of alcohol (26.5%), inhalants (6.0%), cocaine (1.0%), 
methamphetamines (0.71%), ecstasy (1.5%), LSD/mushrooms/psychedelics (1.7%), salvia 
(1.0%), heroin (0.5%), prescription pain killers (2.3%), tranquilizers or sedatives (3.3%), 
diet pills (1.7%), prescription stimulant pills (0.82%), and other drugs (1.2%). Only 
substances with lifetime prevalence greater than 5% were analyzed as individual outcomes.

 Clinical Syndromes
Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) (Chorpita, Yim, Moffitt, 
Umemoto, & Francis, 2000): The RCADS instructs respondents to report the frequency of 
40 different DSM-IV symptoms from 1=never to 4=always. Subscales yield scores for major 
depression, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and 
social phobia.
Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) (Hirschfeld et al., 2000): The MDQ instructs 
respondents to indicate whether they experienced 13 DSM-IV mania symptoms in the past 
year (yes=1, no=0). A symptom count sum score was utilized for analyses, per prior work 
(Boschloo et al., 2014). (Supplemental analyses utilizing the cutoff for probable DSM-IV 
hypomanic/manic episode yielded the same findings with the continuous score.)
Transdiagnostic Phenotypes—Each of the transdiagnostic phenotype measures 
described below has been consistently associated with multiple psychopathologies (Audrain-
McGovern et al., 2009; Audrain-McGovern et al., 2004; Cyders et al., 2007; Ellis & 
Rothbart, 2001; Isolan, Salum, Menezes Flores, de Carvalho, & Gus Manfro, 2012; 
Leventhal et al., 2015 in press; Leyro, Zvolensky, & Bernstein, 2010; Muris et al., 2008; 
Muris, Schmidt, Merckelbach, & Schouten, 2001; Pang et al., 2015 in press; Smith et al., 
2007).
Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) (Simons & Gaher, 2005): The 14-item DTS measures 
capacity to tolerate affective distress (e.g., “I’ll do anything to avoid feeling distressed or 
upset”) using 5-point ratings (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree).
Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI) (Silverman, Fleisig, Rabian, & Peterson, 
1991): The 18-item CASI measures fear of and concerns about anxiety-related sensations 
and consequences (e.g., “It scares me when my heart beats fast”; none=0, some=1, a lot=2).
Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) (Snaith et al., 1995): The SHAPS assesses 
anhedonia using 14 self-statements regarding pleasure response to common pleasant 
experiences (e.g., “I would enjoy seeing others’ smiling faces”; 1=strongly agree, 
4=strongly disagree).
Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI)-Impulsivity Scale (Cloninger, Przybeck, 
Syrakic, & Wetzel, 1994): The 5-item TCI Impulsivity subscale assesses tendency towards 
acting on instinct without conscious deliberation (e.g., “I often do things based on how I feel 
at the moment”). It uses a sum across items (True=1, False=0; range: 0–5).
UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale-Positive and Negative Urgency Subscales (Whiteside 
& Lynam, 2001): The UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale(Whiteside et al., 2001) has 
subscales tapping the tendency towards rash action during states of negative affect (negative 
urgency; 12 items, e.g., “When I’m upset I often act without thinking”) and positive affect 
(positive urgency; 14 items, e.g., “I tend to lose control when I am in a great mood”). Items 
are rated from 1=disagree strongly to 4=agree strongly.

 The Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire – Revised (EATQ-R)-Inhibitory 
Control Scale (Ellis et al., 2001): The 5-item EATQ-R Inhibitory Control scale assesses 
ability to inhibit reflexive responses (e.g., “When someone tells me to stop doing something, 
it is easy for me to stop”; 1=almost always true to 5=almost always untrue).
Substance Abuse and Problems
Drug Abuse Screening Test-Adolescent Version (DAST) (Martino et al., 2000): The 10-
item DAST assesses problems associated with use and abuse of drugs other than alcohol 
(e.g., blackouts, family problems, withdrawal symptoms, legal problems; yes/no). A total 
sum score (0 – 10) is calculated.
Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) (LEGLEYE, KARILA, BECK, & REYNAUD, 
2007): The 6-item CAST measures problems experienced from cannabis use (e.g., failed 
attempts to stop use, social or academic consequences). Participants rate frequency from 
never (=0) to often (=4) and a sum score is calculated.
Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI) (White et al., 1989): The 23-item RAPI 
measures the frequency of negative consequences associated with drinking within the last 12 
months. Responses to items (0=never to 4=10 or more times) are summed.
Data Analysis
Based on patterns of lifetime use, the sample was divided into: (1) use of neither electronic 
nor conventional cigarettes (non-use; N=2557); (2) use of conventional cigarettes only 
(N=152); (3) use of electronic cigarettes only (N=412); (4) use of electronic and 
conventional cigarettes (dual use; N=189). Primary analyses used generalized linear mixed 
models (GLMMs) that accounted for clustering of data within school, in which the 4-level 
cigarette use group variable was a categorical regressor variable and a mental health 
indicator was the outcome variable, with separate models for each outcome. GLMM 
specified binary and continuous distributions for the lifetime substance use status and mental 
health quantitative outcomes, respectively. Because of skewed distributions on the three 
substance use problems measures, Poisson distributions were specified for these outcomes. 
For outcomes with omnibus groups differences, we conducted follow up pairwise contrasts 
using an adjusted p-value, correcting for study-wise false discovery rate of 0.05. GLMMs 
were adjusted for gender, age, ethnicity, and highest parental education; missing data on 
covariates were accounted for by dummy coding a ‘missingness’ variable to allow inclusion 
in analyses. Results are reported as standardized effect size estimates (rs).
RESULTS
Use of e-cigarettes only (12.4%) was more common than conventional cigarettes only 
(4.6%) and dual (5.7%) use, ps < .0001. Dual use was more common than conventional 
cigarette use only, p = .04. Demographic characteristics by group are reported in Table 1. 
Cronbach αs for continuous outcomes are reported in Table 2. The correlations between all 
of the continuous mental health measures can be found in Supplementary Table 1, which

 showed a wide range correlations across each pair of constructs (M[SD] r-statistic between 
two measures = 0.27 [0.20], range: −0.25, 0.77).
As illustrated in Table 2, there were omnibus differences across the four groups for all 
outcomes. Pairwise contrasts indicated that adolescents who used conventional cigarettes 
only reported worse mental health than non-users and e-cigarette only users on multiple 
internalizing emotional syndromes (i.e., major depression, generalized anxiety, panic, social 
phobia, and obsessive compulsive disorder) and transdiagnostic phenotypes (i.e., distress 
tolerance, anxiety sensitivity, negative urgency; see Table 2). On these internalizing-
emotional outcomes, the conventional cigarettes only and dual use groups did not 
significantly differ. For some internalizing outcomes (i.e., anhedonia, major depression, 
panic disorder), e-cigarette only users had higher elevations than non-users, but lower 
problem levels than conventional only or dual users. Relative to non-users, use of either 
product (e-cigarettes only, conventional cigarettes only, or dual use) was related to the 
externalizing phenotypes of poorer inhibitory control and impulsivity. An ordered effect of 
dual use vs. e-cigarette use only vs. non-use was found for elevations in mania, positive 
urgency, and anhedonia. An ordered effect of dual use vs. either single product use (e-
cigarettes only or conventional cigarettes only) vs. non-use was also found for lifetime use 
status and level of abuse/problems for all substances.
Given the differences in patterns across internalizing (i.e., negative emotion-related) and 
externalizing and positive-emotion seeking (i.e., mania, behavioral dyscontrol, substance 
use) behaviors, syndromes, and traits, we plotted standardized T-scores of the outcomes by 
conventional/e-cigarette use status separately in the two domains. These figures respectively 
illustrate general trends of: (a) differentiation of conventional and dual cigarette use from 
never and e-cigarette use on most internalizing outcomes (Figure 1), and (b) tri-level ordered 
differentiation of never vs. single product vs. dual use on externalizing outcomes (Figure 2).
Analyses of the substance problem outcomes utilizing the overall sample cannot distinguish 
between substance ever-users who report zero drug/alcohol-related problems and substance 
never-users. To identify whether e- and conventional-cigarette use status differentiates level 
of substance problems among substance ever-users, a supplementary analysis of the three 
substance problem outcomes was conducted that limited each analysis to ever-users of the 
respective substance using the same GLMM analytic strategy and covariates as the primary 
analyses with a continuous outcome distribution specified. As in the analysis in the primary 
sample, these analyses of substance ever-users generally showed an ordered pattern whereby 
dual tobacco product users reported the highest levels of alcohol, cannabis, and drug 
problems, followed by single tobacco product users (either conventional- or e-cigarette use), 
and then never-users of either tobacco product, respectively (see supplementary table 2).
DISCUSSION
This study is the first to comprehensively examine differences in psychiatric profiles 
between four different groups based on typologies of tobacco product use: (1) non-users; (2) 
e-cigarette only users; (3) conventional cigarette only users; and (4) dual users. This novel 4-
group comparison is a critical innovation; with changes in the pattern of tobacco product use

 in the past several years, new typologies of adolescent tobacco product use have emerged, 
including both e-cigarette and dual use (Arrazola et al., 2015; Dutra & Glantz, 2014). Given 
the relative lack of data to suggest that additional psychiatric problems would be associated 
with e-cigarette vs. conventional cigarette or dual use, it was unclear whether e-cigarette 
only users would differ from the other user groups in psychiatric comorbidity.
This study’s main findings were that: (1) e-cigarette only users reported a level of 
internalizing mental health problems midway between non-use and conventional cigarette 
use; and (2) externalizing/substance use comorbidity was extensive and followed an ordered 
pattern with dual users having the most severe and pervasive comorbidity, followed by 
single-product users and non-users, respectively. These results are novel and raise an 
important question as to whether e-cigarette use may be common in ‘lower-risk’ subgroups 
of the adolescent population (including those with better mental health) who otherwise are 
not attracted to other tobacco products, like conventional cigarettes. These results are 
broadly consistent with recent data in adults (Cummins et al., 2014) as well as Wills et al.’s 
study of psychosocial risk factors and alcohol/marijuana use in Hawaiian 9th/10th graders, 
which found that e-cigarette users were at an intermediate risk status in between non-users 
and dual users (Wills et al., 2015). In the current sample of Los Angeles 9th graders, a 
similar pattern of differentiation by dual vs. e-cigarette only vs. non-use is seen that extends 
across a number of mental health syndromes and transdiangostic phenotypes. The current 
study also found that conventional cigarette only users have worse internalizing mental 
health problems than e-cigarette only users. Overall, it is clear that future research and 
intervention dedicated to comorbidity between use of tobacco (or tobacco-like) products and 
mental health problems in adolescents should assess and distinguish between use of 
conventional cigarettes only, e-cigarettes only, and dual use.
For eight internalizing emotional disorder symptoms and phenotypes, adolescents who used 
e-cigarettes only reported an intermediate level of problems which was lower than 
conventional cigarette only users on seven outcomes and higher than never-users on three 
outcomes. Prior research suggests that adolescents with better (vs. worse) emotional health 
are more strongly deterred from initiating smoking due to concerns about smoking’s 
negative effects on health and social acceptability (Stone & Leventhal, 2014). Thus, 
emotionally-healthier adolescents may be more willing to use e-cigarettes, which are 
generally perceived to be more socially acceptable and less harmful than conventional 
cigarettes (Wills et al., 2015). The availability of tobacco products that are perceived as less 
harmful and more socially acceptable, like e-cigarettes, may lower the threshold of risk for 
tobacco product experimentation associated with certain mental health problems.
Externalizing behavioral comorbidities (i.e., substance use and abuse, impulsivity, poor 
inhibitory control, tendency toward rash action during positive affect) and mania were 
elevated in adolescents who used e-cigarettes only versus those who use never used either 
tobacco product. Adolescents who used conventional cigarettes only also showed this 
pattern relative to those who never used either tobacco product, which extends prior research 
on tobacco-psychiatric comorbidity (Upadhyaya et al., 2002). Moreover, this study provides 
novel data indicating use of e-cigarettes per se is not universally linked with all types of

 mental health comorbidities; rather use of e-cigarettes alone (vs. non-use) is associated more 
prominently with externalizing problems and less prominently with internalizing problems.
A clear gradient was observed in which substance use/problems, mania, and positive 
urgency that successively increased with the number of tobacco products used (dual vs. 
single vs. never users). One explanation for these findings is that adolescent cigarette 
smokers with these comorbidities may be more nicotine dependent and may therefore be 
motivated to also use e-cigarettes to alleviate withdrawal during times when they cannot 
smoke (Peters et al., 2013). Indeed, these disorders are linked with more severe conventional 
cigarette dependence (Griesler, Hu, Schaffran, & Kandel, 2011). Another explanation is that 
adolescents with substance use and mania comorbidity who have experimented with e-
cigarette use may not derive enough reinforcement from e-cigarettes, which may be an 
important factor given prior evidence that conventional cigarette smokers with these 
comorbidities report stronger motivation to smoke for positive reinforcement (Kahler et al., 
2010). Because e-cigarettes have provided less reliable nicotine delivery and reinforcement 
than conventional cigarettes in novice users (Evans & Hoffman, 2014), adolescents with 
substance use and mania comorbidities who have tried e-cigarettes may be motivated to 
subsequently experiment with conventional cigarettes in an effort to find a product that 
provides stronger and more consistent rewarding effects. An additional perspective is that 
substance experimentation is driven by a drive for pleasure and means for rebelling against 
norms (Wills et al., 2015), and that teens with externalizing mental health problems are 
motivated to experiment with a wider array of multiple substances, including e-cigarettes, 
conventional cigarettes, and other drugs. Further longitudinal evaluation of these hypotheses 
is necessary and future research should explore whether there is a gradient in the intensity of 
intervention needed in preventing conventional cigarette smoking and dual use.
This study had several strengths, including a comprehensive four-group comparison strategy 
that distinguished four unique patterns of tobacco product use, broad sampling of mental 
health syndromes and cross-cutting traits, and utilization of a large, diverse sample. The 
cross-sectional design does not permit an assessment of the temporal precedence of the 
mental health problems and the use of conventional/e-cigarettes. Accordingly, this study 
cannot speak to etiological mechanisms underpinning the link between mental health and 
tobacco product use. Because the survey did not assess past 30-day e-cigarette use, use 
frequency and progression in use, persistence of use, and nicotine strength (i.e., whether 
products contain nicotine and at what level), several aspects regarding the quality and profile 
of e-cigarette and conventional cigarette use are not addressed in this study. Furthermore, 
the focus on lifetime use leaves unclear whether findings generalize to brief experimentation 
or more persistent use patterns. To limit burden on students and class time, brief self-report 
measures were used. As such, these results reflect self-reported symptoms, and the extent to 
which they generalize to psychiatric diagnoses is unclear. Future work utilizing structured 
clinical interviews are warranted to identify diagnoses associated with conventional and e-
cigarette use.
This is first the investigation to characterize adolescent psychiatric comorbidity in an era 
when the extensive popularity of e-cigarettes in youth is now clearly established. The 
current data are of use for policy and tobacco and mental illness intervention by elucidating

 a subpopulation based on mental health status that may be at higher risk for use of 
traditional and emerging tobacco products. Describing patterns of psychiatric comorbidity 
between different forms of tobacco product use in teens provides clues to practitioners on 
assessment and intervention. For instance, these findings suggest that if a teen is a dual user 
or conventional cigarette smoker, she or he may be more likely to have comorbid mental 
health problems than teens who use e-cigarettes only; practitioners should thus make mental 
health assessment a priority such populations. Similarly, these findings suggest that teens 
with mild levels of emotional pathology may nonetheless be at elevated likelihood of e-
cigarette use and should be asked by practitioners about their e-cigarette use patterns, 
particularly given recent evidence that teens who use e-cigarettes are more likely to initiate 
combustible tobacco product use.(Leventhal et al., 2015a; Primack, Soneji, Stoolmiller, 
Fine, & Sargent, 2015). These results also raise the possibility that adolescents with more 
severe and pervasive mental health problems could be more vulnerable to factors that 
increase risk of initiation of e-cigarettes and dual use in teen populations. Some of these risk 
factors could be targeted via regulation (e.g., youth exposure to e-cigarette advertising, 
restrictions on ability for minors to purchase e-cigarettes, flavorings and other elements of e-
cigarettes and conventional cigarettes that could attract youths) or intervention (e.g., tobacco 
prevention media campaigns that tailor message characteristics to sufficiently resonate with 
youth with certain behavioral tendencies; Allen, Vallone, Vargyas, & Healton, 2009). The 
current results may also have implications for patterns of comorbidity that are likely to arise 
in the future. Namely, emotionally-healthier individuals who previously might be deterred 
from using any tobacco products may now be at risk for uptake of e-cigarettes or other 
emerging products. Furthermore, individuals with certain behavioral comorbidities may be 
more prone to use multiple products, which may alter the trajectory of future conventional 
cigarette smoking in patterns that remain to be seen.

 HIGHLIGHTS
•
Relative to conventional cigarette only users, e-cigarette only users reported 
lower levels of internalizing mental health syndromes (depression, generalized 
anxiety, panic disorder, social phobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder) and 
traits (i.e., distress intolerance, fear of anxiety-related sensations, rash action 
during negative affect).
•
Depression, panic disorder, and inability to experience pleasure (i.e., anhedonia) 
were higher in e-cigarette only users vs. non-users.
•
For externalizing mental health (mania, rash action during positive affect, 
alcohol/drug use/abuse) and anhedonia, comorbidity was lowest in non-users, 
moderate in single-product users (conventional or e-cigarette), and highest in 
dual users.
•
Adolescent e-cigarette use is characterized by emotional problems midway 
between non-use and conventional cigarette use. Dual use is associated with 
pervasive psychiatric comorbidity.
