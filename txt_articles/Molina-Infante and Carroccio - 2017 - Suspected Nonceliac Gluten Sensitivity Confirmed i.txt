A double-blind, placebo-controlled, gluten challenge has
been proposed to confirm a diagnosis of nonceliac gluten
sensitivity (NCGS) in patients without celiac disease who
respond to a gluten-free diet. To determine the accuracy of
this approach, we analyzed data from 10 double-blind,
placebo-controlled,
gluten-challenge
trials,
comprising
1312 adults. The studies varied in the duration of the
challenge (range, 1 d to 6 wk), daily doses for the gluten
challenge (range, 2–52 g; 3 studies administered <8 g/d),
and composition of the placebo (gluten-free products,
xylose, whey protein, rice, or corn starch containing
fermentable carbohydrates). Most of the studies found
gluten challenge to significantly increase symptom scores
compared with placebo. However, only 38 of 231 NCGS
patients
(16%)
showed
gluten-specific
symptoms.
Furthermore, 40% of these subjects had a nocebo response
(similar or increased symptoms in response to placebo).
These findings reveal heterogeneity and potential meth-
odology flaws among studies of gluten challenge, cast
doubt on gluten as the culprit food component in most
patients
with
presumptive
NCGS,
and
highlight
the
importance of the nocebo effect in these types of studies.

N
onceliac
gluten
sensitivity
(NCGS)
was
first
described in the late 1970s1,2 and the first series
dates back to 1980.3 However, it has been only since
2009 that rapidly increasing evidence has called our
attention to an apparently novel condition.4 Several
epidemiologic studies have suggested that NCGS may
affect a variable range (from 0.5% to 13%) of the
Western population.5–9 In line with the advent of NCGS,
gluten-free foods among nonceliac patients have grown
steadily in popularity, for reasons other than sensitivity,
such as eating healthy food or aids in weight loss.10 A
recent survey conducted in the United States showed
that almost one third of the adult healthy population
were trying to cut down or avoid gluten in their diets.11
Currently, NCGS is a syndrome characterized by
intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms related to the
ingestion of gluten-containing food, in subjects in whom
either celiac disease or wheat allergy previously has been
ruled out.12 The clinical spectrum includes irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS)-like and other functional gastrointestinal
symptoms (bloating, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia,
and so forth), along with extraintestinal manifestations
such as fatigue, headache, numbness, mental confusion,
anxiety/depression, and fibromyalgia-like symptoms.13
Given the lack of a diagnostic biomarker, NCGS mostly re-
mains a self-reported diagnosis for patients and a diagnosis
of exclusion for physicians, so a confirmatory test is
required. The Salerno experts14 recently advocated a
double-blind,
placebo-controlled
(DBPC),
cross-over,
gluten challenge as the gold standard test to discriminate
true NCGS patients. First of all, the patient should show at
least a 30% decrease in gastrointestinal symptoms after a
6-week gluten-free diet. Then, a DBPC challenge with cross-
over should be performed, with a 1-week duration for each
challenge and the wash-out period between. The recom-
mended daily doses for gluten are 8 g, whereas the placebo
should be gluten-free.14 It is likely that outcome reports of
DBPC in NCGS might be discrepant depending on the se-
lection of patients through previous elimination diets and
the challenge methods, including doses and duration for
gluten and components for the placebo. The aim of this
article is to critically revise the published procedures for
DBPC challenge in NCGS trials, to understand potential
inconsistent results in trials.

 to the MeSH search terms “non celiac OR nonceliac OR
non-celiac OR noncoeliac AND gluten sensitivity” from
English language journals. Only randomized DBPC trials
evaluating gluten challenge in either NCGS or IBS patients
were included. Patients suffering from celiac disease or
other gluten-related disorders (gluten ataxia, autism,
neurologic symptoms), mostly referenced as “gluten
sensitivity,” were excluded as well. Duplicate publications
were excluded. The reference lists of these articles were
reviewed to include further appropriate articles.
Results
The review and selection process is detailed in
Figure 1. From a total of 325 eligible articles in our initial
search, we finally retrieved 10 DBPC trials with gluten/
wheat challenge including a total of 1312 patients with
suspected NCGS.3,15–23 All of these studies were con-
ducted in adult populations. Nine in 10 (90%) studies
were published over the past 5 years.
Study Design and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
These data are summarized in Table 1. Six of 10
studies had a cross-over DBPC design.16–18,20–22 All of
the studies generally included patients with IBS-like
symptoms showing improvement on a gluten-free diet.
Celiac disease was ruled out by seronegativity and lack of
villous atrophy in duodenal biopsy specimens. Only the 3
studies from the Australian group15,17,18 used more
stringent criteria to exclude celiac disease. Celiac disease
was ruled out either by absence of the HLA DQ2/DQ8
haplotypes or by a baseline normal duodenal biopsy
(Marsh 0) while on a gluten-containing diet in in-
dividuals expressing the HLA DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes. HLA
DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes were present in 56%,15 53%,16
55%,17 55%,18 57%,19 26%,20 46%,21 and 75%22 of
patients, respectively. When reported, wheat allergy was
ruled out by specific IgE testing, mostly skin testing. A
recent Italian study excluded patients with lactose and
fermentable oligosaccharides, di-, monosaccharides and
polyols (FODMAP) intolerance,20 apart from those with
celiac disease and wheat allergy.
Gluten Challenge
Only 1 study used wheat instead of gluten for the
food challenge.16 Among the studies using gluten for the
food challenge, 3 of the 4 Italian trials used a gluten
amount less than 8 g/d,20–22 which is in disagreement
with
recent
recommendations
from
the
Salerno
experts.14 The remaining studies used a higher gluten
amount than that recently recommended: 10 g/d,23 16
g/d,15,17,18 with a low-dose gluten arm in 1 study that
used 2 g/d.17 The study with the longest duration (6
weeks) also used the highest gluten doses (52 g/d),19
whereas the pioneer study by Cooper et al3 used 20 g/
d for 2 separate days.
Placebo Challenge
All research groups used different placebo compo-
nents, including gluten-free muffins and bread, xylose,
whey protein, or starch. Of note, 2 studies used FODMAP-
containing placebo, such as corn starch,19 and corn
starch, lactose, and fructans.21 The duration of the chal-
lenge (from 1 day to 6 weeks) and the wash-out periods
between challenges in cross-over studies (from 3 days to
a minimum of 2 weeks) also was extremely variable. This
information is summarized in Table 2.

Placebo–Controlled Gluten Challenge for NCGS

 Primary End Points and Outcome Report
The main findings of the included studies are shown in
Table 2. Measurement of the primary end point was
performed in 9 studies by means of overall change in
symptoms after both challenges.3,15–20,22–23 The studies
by Biesiekierski et al17 and Di Sabatino et al20 reported the
ability to adequately distinguish gluten from placebo as a
secondary end point of the study. After these studies, 2
more Italian studies also included the distinction between
gluten and placebo as a primary21 or secondary22 end
point.
When overall symptoms were reported quantitatively
(sum of symptom scores in all patients), gluten or wheat
was shown to trigger significantly more symptoms
compared with placebo in 7 trials studies.3,15,16,18–20,22
However,
only
4
studies17,20–22
also
reported
the
challenge outcome qualitatively, aiming at differentiating
patients with
specific-gluten symptoms or patients
with similar or more symptoms on placebo than with
gluten (nocebo effect). These data are summarized in
Table 3. Only 38 of 231 (16%) NCGS patients showed
gluten-specific symptoms.17,20–22 Of note, a nocebo
response (similar or higher symptom worsening with
placebo) was observed in 94 of 231 (40%) patients. When
the only study using a FODMAP-containing placebo was
excluded,21 the nocebo effect remained unaltered (77 of
196; 39%). Interestingly, using wheat instead of gluten for
the food challenge, which was conducted in 1 single
study,16 resulted in identification of 30% of patients with
nonceliac wheat sensitivity.
Discussion
The present review shows that more than 80% of
nonceliac patients, labeled as suffering from NCGS after a
favorable response to a gluten-free diet, cannot reach a
formal diagnosis of NCGS after a double-blind, placebo-
controlled
gluten
challenge.
Double-blind,
placebo-
controlled, cross-over trials currently represent the gold
standard for confirming dietary factors involved in func-
tional gastrointestinal symptom generation. Accordingly,
several conclusions can be drawn from our results. To

 begin with, they hint at the possibility that gluten may not
be responsible for gastrointestinal and extraintestinal
symptoms in the vast majority of patients with self-
reported NCGS. Second, they suggest that the accuracy of
a DBPC trial may be far from perfect for diagnosing NCGS.
Most of the enrolled patients are highly motivated and
would expect that the disease can be controlled by dietary
modifications and this likely may promote both a precebo
(before the intervention) and placebo effect (during the
intervention). Conversely, some others may show nega-
tive expectations irrespective of the consumed food, and
experience symptoms with a placebo, namely, the nocebo
effect. It is noteworthy that up to 40% of patients with
suspected NCGS in this systematic review undergoing a
DBPC challenge showed a nocebo response. Beyond
negative expectations, potential reasons responsible for a
nocebo effect are discussed later. Combining the afore-
mentioned considerations and our present findings, a
DBPC food challenge currently remains as the imperfect
gold standard for NCGS, until we have diagnostic bio-
markers available.
As for the gluten challenge procedure, a literature
search in the present review drew marked heterogeneity
in doses and duration for gluten and placebo challenges.
The NCGS diagnostic protocol recommended by the
Salerno experts14 in 2015 included an 8 g/d gluten
challenge for 1 week, followed by a wash-out period for 1
week, and then a cross-over to placebo for 1 week. It is
important to acknowledge that these are not evidence-
based recommendations, but expert committee recom-
mendations. Furthermore, some aspects of the challenge
procedure may be questionable and should be validated
in prospective studies. A 1-week duration for the gluten
challenge might be short for patients showing mild or
fluctuating symptoms. If tolerated, the challenge might
be prolonged to at least 2 weeks or beyond to ensure
detection of the whole spectrum of patients. Likewise,
the diagnostic yield of the gluten challenge may be
increased with higher gluten doses. The current recom-
mendation of 8 g/d is lower than the average daily intake
of gluten in Western countries (10–15 g).14 By using a
gluten dose of 7.9 g/d for 10 days, the study by Zanini
et al21 diagnosed twice as many patients with gluten-
specific symptoms (34%) compared with the studies by
Di Sabatino et al20 (17%) and Elli et al22 (14%), which
used lower gluten doses (4.7 and 5.6 g, respectively) for
1
week.
As
proposed
by
the
Australian
research
group,15,17,18 16 g/d may be more accurate doses for a
diagnostic gluten challenge, although tolerability might
be a concern for high doses. With regard to the wash-out
period, it also is relevant to underscore that 1 week may
be too short to avoid carry-over effects (the possibility
that effects from previous challenge still may be present
in a cross-over trial). Finally, the placebo substance must
be completely gluten-free,14 but we detected 2 studies
using FODMAP-containing corn starch.19,21 Symptoms
related to this placebo substance might have been mis-
interpreted as a nocebo effect and potentially prevented
a diagnosis of NCGS.
Beyond optimization in the food challenge proced-
ure, the key question is: what diagnosis should be given
to the majority of symptomatic patients who feel better
on a gluten-free diet but cannot be diagnosed formally
with NCGS? As brilliantly suggested in a recent editorial,
“the strange world of NCGS is complex and will not give
up its secrets easily.”24 The potential inclusion of
different cohorts of patients with wheat- (and maybe
other cereal-) related symptoms under the common um-
brella of NCGS might explain this enormous diagnostic
gap for the gluten challenge. This melting pot hypothesis
is shown in Figure 2. First, inclusion of misdiagnosed
celiac patients as NCGS patients may blur our under-
standing of this new entity, therefore adequately ruling
out celiac disease is essential.24 A survey characterizing
Figure 2. The melting pot
hypothesis for NCGS, with
different patients lumped
together under a common
label. Although a gluten
challenge might not iden-
tify patients intolerant to
FODMAP or sensitive or
allergic to nongluten pro-
teins, a wheat challenge
likely may identify these
patients
along
with
pa-
tients
suffering
from
gluten-specific symptoms.
March 2017
Placebo–Controlled Gluten Challenge for NCGS
345
 147 adults with self-reported NCGS showed that celiac
disease had been ruled out inadequately in 61% of pa-
tients.25 In a recent systematic review, up to 20% of NCGS
patients in the literature who showed HLA haplotypes
and lymphocytic enteritis eventually were relabeled as
celiac patients, after advanced diagnostic techniques
(including the HLA-DQ2–gliadin tetramer test and anti-
endomysium antibodies in duodenal cell culture) or re-
evaluation after gluten challenge.26 Consequently, more
sensitive assays27–30 than those commonly used for celiac
disease should be considered for patients with gluten-
related symptoms who carry the DQ2 and/or the DQ8
haplotypes.
Second, Carroccio et al16 explored a subset of NCGS
patients showing a high prevalence of concomitant atopic
disease, multiple food hypersensitivity, and duodenal
and colon eosinophilic infiltration. These findings sug-
gest the existence of a different cohort of NCGS patients
with a wheat allergy–like profile. In these patients, a
wheat allergy likely may be driven by a non-IgE mech-
anism and therefore may be overlooked with currently
recommended skin and blood testing.31 In this respect,
there are very recent data that suggest a wheat-
dependent Th1 immunologic activation in the rectal
mucosa of NCGS patients.32 Third, aside from gluten,
wheat may have at least 2 components that may trigger
or exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms: carbohydrates
(primarily fructans, included in the FODMAP list), and
proteins different from gluten, such as amylase-trypsin
inhibitors (ATIs) and wheat germ agglutinin.33 The effi-
cacy of a low FODMAP diet for IBS symptoms is out of
the
question
and
supported
by
high-quality
evi-
dence.17,34,35 Consequently, FODMAP intolerance likely
may play an important role in the NCGS grey zone be-
tween celiac disease and wheat allergy (Figure 2).
Further studies comparing gluten-free and low FODMAP
diet in patients with a presumptive diagnosis of NCGS
definitely are warranted. On the other hand, nongluten
proteins contained in wheat deserve further attention.
ATIs are strong activators of innate immune responses in
monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells,36 and
wheat germ agglutinin, which has epithelial-damaging
and immune effects at very low doses in vitro, also
might contribute to both intestinal and extraintestinal
manifestations of NCGS.37 ATIs conceivably might induce
symptoms in a subset of NCGS patients with concomitant
autoimmune38 or allergic diseases31 because those clin-
ical conditions can be exacerbated by a high ATI inges-
tion. It is noteworthy that commercially available gluten
is not purified, therefore nongluten proteins are not
removed specifically for the challenge. This issue makes
it difficult to discern whether gluten-specific symptoms
in challenges ultimately are triggered by either gluten or
nongluten proteins, such as ATIs. Furthermore, ATI ef-
fects are dose-dependent and a great variability in ATI
activity has been reported in different wheat varieties,39
so this could be another important factor to consider
when designing gluten challenges.
Furthermore,
a
noteworthy
recent
study
using
confocal
endomicroscopy
in
the
duodenum
after
duodenal infusion of foods, including wheat, showed
early (5 minutes) epithelial breaks, dilation of inter-
villous spaces, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes
after food challenge.40 This could evoke an innate
immune mechanism, which has been suggested repeat-
edly in NCGS pathogenesis,41–43 but an adaptative
response in previously sensitized patients also must be
considered. Over the past 5 years, active research in
pursuit of a diagnostic biomarker for NCGS has been
developed, including antigliadin antibodies,44 chemokine
secretion from peripheral blood mononucleated cells,45
in vitro cytometric basophil activation tests,46 and fecal
assays.47 Although promising, these tools have not been
replicated unequivocally by others,48,49 therefore an ac-
curate diagnostic biomarker remains an unmet goal.
This confusing uncertainty on the true culprit(s) for
NCGS has opened a scenario of different semantic defini-
tions, including nonceliac gluten sensitivity or nonceliac
wheat sensitivity50 to nonceliac wheat protein sensi-
tivity.33 According to the results of the present review, it is
questionable to continue including gluten in the name of
the disease when a high proportion of patients with sus-
pected NCGS do not seem to have gluten-specific symp-
toms in a double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge.
Nonceliac wheat sensitivity might be a more accurate term
to cover the whole spectrum of patients. One drawback of
changing gluten for wheat is that barley and oats may be
excluded inappropriately. However, wheat is by far the
most
common
source
of
gluten.
Likewise,
some
investigators have advocated to distinguish between
carbohydrates (causing food intolerance as a result of
carbohydrate fermentation by the colonic microbiota) and
nongluten proteins (causing food sensitivity owing to an
immune response to nutrient-derived antigens).33,43
Albeit this distinction might be necessary from a physio-
pathologic standpoint, we believe that the term wheat
should prevail within nomenclature and food challenge
for these patients in clinical practice. Nonceliac wheat
sensitivity might be a more accurate term to cover the
whole spectrum of patients, including patients intolerant
to carbohydrates, showing sensitivity, and allergic to
wheat through a non-IgE mechanism.43,50
Conclusions
In conclusion, more than 80% of patients with sus-
pected NCGS cannot be diagnosed formally after a
double-blind,
placebo-controlled,
cross-over
gluten
challenge.
Many
doubts arise
from
these
findings,
including the appropriateness of including gluten in the
name of the disease, the methodologic flaws of the
currently
recommended
double-blind,
placebo-
controlled, cross-over trials as the gold standard diag-
nostic tool for NCGS, along with the possibility of NCGS
being a melting pot made up of different patients lumped

 together under a common label. The nocebo effect was
detected in up to 40% of patients, possibly related to
several factors including negative expectations, carry-
over effect in cross-over trials, or use of FODMAP-
containing placebo. Further research should assess
several
optimizations
proposed
for
the
currently
accepted double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, aside
from deciphering whether using wheat instead of gluten
for the food challenge may increase the diagnostic yield
of food challenge in patients with suspected NCGS.
