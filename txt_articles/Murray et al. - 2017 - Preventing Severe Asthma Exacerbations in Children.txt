Scientific knowledge on the Subject: Asthma exacerbations in children are a leading cause of 
hospitalisation. Exposure in sensitised individuals in synergy with viral infections greatly 
increases hospital admission risk. In the developed world house dust mite is the commonest 
sensitising allergen. Studies to date have not investigated the effect of allergen avoidance on 
asthma exacerbations and hospital admissions in children.  
What this study adds to the field: The use of mite impermeable bedding in mite sensitised 
asthmatic children can significantly reduce the risk of severe exacerbations resulting in 
emergency hospital attendance.

ABSTRACT 
Rationale: Allergen exposure in sensitised asthmatics interacts with viruses in increasing the 
risk of asthma exacerbation. 
Objectives: To evaluate the use of house dust mite impermeable bedding on severe asthma 
exacerbations in children. 
Methods: We randomized mite-sensitised asthmatic children (3-17 years), following an 
emergency hospital attendance with an asthma exacerbation, to receive mite-impermeable 
(Active) or control (Placebo) bed encasings.  
Measurements and main results: Over a 12-month intervention period the occurrence of 
severe asthma exacerbations were investigated. Of 434 asthmatic children who consented, 286 
(mean age 7.7 years, 65.8% male) were mite sensitised and 284 were randomised (146 Active; 
138 Placebo). At 12 months, significantly fewer children in the Active group had attended 
hospital with an exacerbation compared to the Placebo group (36/123 [29.3%] versus 49/118 
[41.5%], p=0.047). In the multivariable analysis, the risk of emergency hospital attendance was 
45% lower in the Active group (Hazard Ratio 0.55 [95%CI, 0.36-0.85], p=0.006) compared with 
the Placebo group. The annual rate of emergency hospital attendance with exacerbations was 
27% lower in the Active compared with the Placebo group, but this did not reach significance 
(Estimated marginal mean [95% CI]: Active 0.38 [0.26-0.56] vs Placebo 0.52 [0.35-0.76], p=0.18).  
No difference between the groups in the risk of prednisolone use for exacerbation was found 
(Hazard Ratio 0.82 [0.58-1.17], p=0.28).  
Conclusions: Mite-impermeable encasings are effective in reducing the number of mite 
sensitised asthmatic children attending hospital with asthma exacerbations, but not the

INTRODUCTION 
Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood. Although most children with asthma 
are well-controlled on pharmacotherapies, a significant number experience exacerbations 
which remain one of the commonest reasons for paediatric hospital admission in the developed 
world (1).  This unscheduled care accounts for a large proportion of asthma costs, and a single 
exacerbation can increase annual costs more than 3-fold (2).  Previous hospital admissions 
predict future hospitalizations (3). Respiratory virus infections are major risk factors for hospital 
admission (4-6), particularly amongst children who are exposed to allergens to which they are 
sensitised, where these factors act synergistically to markedly increase the risk of hospital 
admission (7, 8). However, disrupting this interaction in atopic asthmatics is challenging.     
There are currently no available vaccines for viruses which cause the majority of exacerbations.  
Allergen-specific immunotherapy is generally not recommended for patients with uncontrolled 
asthma (9). Anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (omalizumab) can reduce asthma exacerbations, but 
its use is limited to the most severe cases of asthma because of high cost and requirement for 
regular injections (10).  Avoidance of allergen remains a potentially cost-effective intervention.  
However, no studies to date have investigated the effect of allergen avoidance on asthma 
exacerbations and hospital admissions, instead focussing on symptom scores, medication usage 
and lung function. 
House dust mite (HDM) is a common allergen linked to expression of asthma, with ~65% of UK 
asthmatic children demonstrating sensitisation (7).  Although high HDM exposure has been 
linked to asthma severity (11), a meta-analysis of 44 trials of mite avoidance was unable to 
demonstrate any clinical benefit of measures designed to reduce mite exposure, and concluded

that mite control measures could not be recommended for asthma (12).  However, this meta-
analysis included many studies where no exposure reduction was achieved, and did not 
distinguish between adult and paediatric studies.  Indeed, most studies which suggest benefits 
of mite avoidance have been conducted in children (13-17).  However, these studies were 
either small (13, 15, 17), used multifaceted interventions making blinding difficult (13, 17), 
targeted multiple allergens (14, 16), or were conducted in populations which have poor access 
to healthcare/medications (14, 16).  Given the evidence of a synergism between viral infection 
and allergen exposure in increasing the risk of asthma exacerbations in sensitised individuals (7, 
18), we hypothesized that effective reduction in mite exposure may reduce the risk of 
exacerbations in these patients. 
In this double-blind study, Preventing asthma exacerbations by avoiding mite allergen 
(PAXAMA), we compared the effect of mite-impermeable bed covers to that of placebo covers 
in reducing the risk of severe asthma exacerbations in mite-sensitised asthmatic children, who 
had recently attended hospital with an asthma exacerbation. Some of the results of these 
studies have been previously reported in the form of an abstract (19). 
 
METHODS 
STUDY DESIGN  
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of the effect of mite-
impermeable bed covers on the risk of severe asthma exacerbations in mite-sensitised 
asthmatic children was conducted across 14 hospitals with acute pediatric secondary care 
services in North-West England.  Children were recruited between November 2011 and May

2013 and were followed for 12 months. The protocol was approved by local research ethics 
committee (NRES Committee North-West/Lancaster, REC approval number 11/ NW/0262).  
STUDY PARTICIPANTS  
We screened children aged 3-17 years with physician-diagnosed asthma who had presented to 
hospital with an asthma exacerbation.  Children were excluded if already using allergen-
impermeable bedding, born prematurely (<36 weeks) or had another respiratory disease. 
Participants were skin-prick tested once their exacerbation had resolved, to HDM, cat, dog, 
pollen and other pet allergens if applicable (Stallergenes, Paris, France), and classed as 
sensitized if the weal diameter was at least 3mm greater than the negative control.  Only 
children sensitised to HDM (+/- other allergens) were eligible for randomisation. Parents 
provided written informed consent and children assent. 
Randomisation and Masking 
Children were randomly assigned 1:1 to active or placebo encasings using a computer-based 
minimisation procedure by a researcher who was not otherwise involved in the study. Children 
were stratified for age (3-10 years; 11-17 years), household cigarette smoking, pet 
sensitisation/ownership and treatment level (GINA steps 1-2; >3; eMethods, Online 
Supplement) in a double-blind manner. To maintain blinding no other information on HDM 
avoidance was given. All participants received identical printed washing instructions for the 
supplied encasings (eMethods, Online Supplement). The active encasings (Astex Pristine, ACP 
solutions Ltd, Gloucestershire, UK) were selected because their mite-proof efficacy had been 
demonstrated previously (20).  Placebo encasings (made from poly-cotton) were custom 
manufactured (Musbury Fabrics, Rossendale, UK), to match the active encasings (Figure E1).

Neither encasings contained a label.  If more than one child from a family were allocated to the 
study, the second child was enrolled in the same arm as the index child, to avoid potential 
unblinding. Researchers fitting covers and collecting dust samples for allergen analysis were not 
involved in follow-up.  
Procedures 
Children had their inhaler technique checked and corrected if necessary.  Encasings were fitted 
to the pillow, mattress and duvet of the child’s bed. Other beds in the same room and beds in 
which participants spent >1 night per week were also encased.  
STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
Baseline evaluation included questionnaires on demographics, past medical/family history, 
sleeping arrangements, pet exposure and medication use.  Interviewers masked to the child’s 
group assignment conducted telephone interviews with the primary caregiver at one, four, 
eight and twelve months to collect data on exacerbations, unscheduled medical care and 
medication. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed using Pediatric Asthma Caregiver’s Quality of Life 
Questionnaire PACQLQ(21) completed by parents, mini Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life 
Questionnaire (PAQLQ)(22) completed by children age >7 years, and asthma control by  Asthma 
Control Questionnaire (ACQ)(23) completed in children aged 6 years or over.   
Mite allergen (Der p 1) was measured in vacuumed dust samples collected from the child’s 
mattress and lounge floor prior to fitting the encasings and at 12 months, using enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (Indoor Biotechnologies, Cardiff, UK; eMethods, Online Supplement)

The primary outcome was the occurrence of severe asthma exacerbations during the 12-month 
intervention period.  We used ATS/ERS definition of severe exacerbations (24), including:  
(A) A hospitalization or emergency department (ED) visit because of asthma, requiring systemic 
corticosteroids (OCS) – abbreviated to emergency hospital attendance;  
(B) Use of OCS or an increase from a stable maintenance dose, for >3 days (includes all OCS 
courses whether associated with an emergency hospital attendance or not).   
Secondary endpoints included change in controller treatment from baseline to 12 months, 
PACQLQ(21), mini PAQLQ(22) and ACQ(23) scores. Compliance and acceptability of intervention 
was recorded. 
STATISTICAL METHODS 
Power calculation 
Data from UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD; www.gprd.com) estimated that 
children who had >1 course of OCS in the previous 12 months had a mean exacerbation rate of 
1.5/year (variance 1.02). For 90% power to detect a 30% reduction in exacerbation rate during 
the 12-month intervention period, 114 children per group were required, at a two-sided 
significance level of 0.05. Assuming 20% lost during follow-up, we aimed to randomise 284 
children. 
Data Analysis 
Baseline characteristics were compared between groups using t-tests, Mann-Whitney U and 
chi-squared tests as appropriate. Efficacy analysis was performed according to the intention-to-
treat principle (per-protocol analysis in supplement).  Outcomes were assessed between the 
groups using chi-squared tests and logistic regression for children who completed 12 months of

follow-up. Cox regression analysis assessed time to first emergency hospital attendance and 
prednisolone usage, and included all evaluable data with censoring for those who did not 
complete 12 months follow-up. Negative binomial generalized linear models analysed count 
data for outcomes; results expressed as estimated marginal means (EMM) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) for annual rates/participant (25). Multivariable models were adjusted for age, 
gender, ethnic group, maintenance asthma treatment, hospitalisations in the 12-months prior 
to randomisation, index of multiple deprivation and tobacco smoke exposure. General linear 
models with repeated measures were used to compare mite allergen levels and prescribed 
treatments across time between the groups. Der p 1 levels were loge transformed to normalise 
the data prior to analysis; results presented as geometric means (GM). The conventional two-
sided 5% significance level was used.  
Exploratory subgroup analyses (not pre-specified) were conducted based on age, GINA step, 
sensitisation status, exposure to smoking and socioeconomic status (eMethods in Supplement) 
(26).  
Analyses were carried out using SPSS 22 (IBM, New York, USA) and Stata 13 (StataCorp, Texas, 
USA). 
 
RESULTS 
PATIENTS 
From November 2011 to May 2013, 434 children were screened to take part in the study.  Of 
those, 286 were HDM-sensitised and 284 underwent randomization (146 Active; 138 Placebo; 
Figure 1).  Baseline characteristics and Der p 1 levels were similar in both groups (Table 1;

Tables E1, E2).  Twelve month follow-up was completed in 123 (84.2%) in the Active arm and 
118 (85.5%) in the Placebo arm; overall, 208 children (73.2%) reported full compliance 
throughout the study (Per-protocol analysis). 
Primary outcome 
A) Hospitalization or ED visit because of asthma requiring systemic corticosteroids  
Significantly fewer children in the Active group attended hospital with one or more severe 
asthma exacerbations compared to the Placebo group (36/123 [29.3%] versus 49/118 [41.5%]; 
OR 0.58 (0.34, 0.99), p=0.047; Figure 2A).  
Time to first exacerbation requiring emergency hospital attendance was significantly longer in 
the Active group (p=0.041), and the risk of emergency hospital attendance was 45% lower in 
the Active group (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.55 [0.36-0.85], p=0.006), compared with the Placebo 
group (Figure 3; Table E3, multivariable model, adjusted for age, gender, GINA step, ethnicity, 
deprivation score and tobacco smoke exposure). Although, the annual rate of emergency 
hospital attendance was 27% lower in the Active compared with the Placebo group, this did not 
reach significance (EMM [95% CI]: Active 0.38 [0.26-0.56] vs Placebo 0.52 [0.35-0.76], p=0.18). 
The distribution of the numbers of attendances did not differ between the groups (p=0.5; 
FigureE2).  
Per protocol analysis is presented in the Online Supplement (Figures E3-E6); the risk of 
emergency hospital attendance was 54% lower in the Active group compared to the Placebo 
group (HR 0.46 [0.28-0.76]; p=0.002).  
B) Use of oral corticosteroids for >3 days

There was no difference in the numbers of children who received a course of OCS for an asthma 
exacerbation (whether associated with an unscheduled hospital or general practitioner 
attendance or by a home rescue pack) between the groups (Active 48.8% vs Placebo 50.0%, 
p=0.85, Figure 2B).  
Investigating the time to first OCS use, there was no difference between groups in the 
univariable analysis (p=0.67) or in the multivariable model (HR 0.82 [0.58-1.17], p=0.28). The 
annual rate of OCS courses prescribed was not different between the groups (EMM [95% CI]; 
Active: 0.77 [0.55-1.06] vs Placebo: 0.85 [0.62-1.16], p=0.57). Per protocol analysis is presented 
in the Online Supplement (Figure E3b).   
SECONDARY OUTCOMES 
Mean values for PACQLQ and ACQ at each time are presented in Table E4 in the online 
supplement. Parents of children in both groups reported significantly improved PACQLQ 
between one and 12 months (mean difference [95% CI]; Active: 0.50 points [0.14-0.8], p=0.007; 
Placebo: 0.57 points [0.12-1.02], p=0.01), with no difference between the groups. Although 
significant improvement in ACQ score over time was observed only in Active children (-0.56 
points, [-0.18,-0.93], p=0.004), and not in those with Placebo covers (-0.25 points, [-0.61, 0.11], 
p=0.16), there was no difference between the groups.  
There was no difference in GINA step between the two groups at baseline (Table1, Table E1). At 
the end of the intervention period, GINA step had been increased in 10.7% of the Active group 
and 14.5% of Placebo group (p=0.37). Children who had any exacerbations during follow-up 
were more likely to have their GINA step increased by the end of follow-up compared to

children who did not suffer an exacerbation (27.1% vs 4.5% respectively, p<0.001), irrespective 
of group allocation.  
Children in the active group were more likely to complain about the encasings (Table E5). 
Despite this, the number adhering to the intervention at 12 months was similar in both groups 
(101 Active, 107 Placebo, p=0.11). Amongst all those fully compliant with the bedding almost 
90% reported they would continue to use the encasings after the study. 
MITE ALLERGEN LEVELS 
Der p 1 levels in dust from the child’s mattress was reduced by 84% in the Active group 
following the intervention, with no change in the Placebo group (p<0.001; Figure 4).  Der p 1 in 
the lounge floor was unchanged in both groups (p=0.48; Figure E7). 
Post-hoc analyses 
In a multivariable Cox regression analysis (Table E6) a reduction in risk of an emergency hospital 
attendance was seen for children in the Active group aged 3-10 years (HR 0.54 [0.33-0.87], 
p=0.01, Figure E8), in those sensitised only to mite (p=0.04), in those from non-smoking homes 
(p=0.02), in those on GINA treatment step >3 (p=0.03) and in those from the most deprived 
homes (p=0.01). None of the interaction terms were significant however. Also, in younger 
children (3-10years), a non-significant reduction in risk of OCS use was seen in those in the 
Active group (HR 0.69 [0.46-1.04], p=0.08, Figure E9). 
 
DISCUSSION 
In our study of HDM allergic children who had recently suffered a severe asthma exacerbation, 
the risk of further severe asthma exacerbations requiring an emergency hospital attendance

was reduced by 45% in those who had mite-impermeable encasings fitted to the mattress, 
pillow and duvet. This is the first study of the effect of such an intervention on exacerbations in 
children. The annual rate of emergency hospital attendance, though 27% lower in the active 
compared to the placebo group, was not significantly reduced (p=0.18).  There was no 
difference in the proportion of children requiring courses of oral steroids for asthma 
exacerbations. The encasings were highly effective in reducing recoverable mite allergen. 
Asthma exacerbations have been ranked highly by clinicians and parents as important 
outcomes for clinical trials in children (27). Although comparatively rare events, severe asthma 
exacerbations result in many hospital admissions which are particularly costly, emphasizing the 
relevance of this as an outcome (28).  Using real data from UK GPRD to power the study, we 
estimated that the exacerbation rate would be 1.5/annum for children who had suffered an 
exacerbation in the previous year. As previous hospitalizations/exacerbations are amongst the 
best predictors of future risk (3,29), we recruited children when attending hospital with an 
exacerbation. However, our observed exacerbation rate during follow-up was materially lower 
(Placebo group:  0.85 oral corticosteroid courses/annum), reducing our power to detect 
significant differences between the groups. That we were able to detect a statistically 
significant difference between groups for numbers of children requiring hospital attendances 
for asthma exacerbations reflects the large effect size seen.  
Although the number of children who experienced any emergency hospital attendance with an 
asthma exacerbation was significantly reduced following the active intervention, some children 
continued to have hospital attendances, a few of them having multiple attendances. However, 
the distribution of multiple attendances did not differ between treatment groups.

As with many treatments for asthma (e.g. long acting Beta-agonists, leukotriene receptor 
antagonists), it is clear that some individuals respond to the treatment and others do not (30), 
but predicting those who will respond is challenging. Although our trial was not powered to 
carry out subgroup analyses, we performed exploratory analyses in an attempt to identify the 
characteristics of the children who showed the best response; this indicated that younger 
children, those sensitised only to mite, those with more severe disease (GINA 3+) and those not 
exposed to smoking had fewer emergency hospital attendances. Similar subgroup analyses in 
those requiring OCS courses for asthma exacerbations also suggested that younger children 
may be more likely to respond to this intervention. Whilst recognising that the subgroup 
analysis is exploratory, we propose that allergen avoidance may be more effective in younger 
children, in whom the disease may have been present for a shorter time.  This may be 
analogous to occupational asthma, where removal of allergen exposure is effective if done soon 
after the onset of disease (31), and may explain the differences between our results compared 
to large studies in adults (32).  In addition, younger children may spend a higher proportion of 
time in bed, making this dust reservoir a potentially larger contributor to personal mite 
exposure than in older children or adults.  Recent reports in adults suggested that mite 
exposure may be higher during the daytime, and may reflect lifestyle and clothing worn (33).  
We speculate that personal allergen exposure is different in young children, who generally wear 
clothes that can be hot washed, and undertake different activities. We have no evidence that 
the younger children were more compliant with the intervention.  
Despite the risk of emergency hospital attendance being reduced in the Active group, the risk of 
receiving OCS was not significantly reduced, although a trend was seen in younger children. A

small number of OCS courses were administered by parents using home rescue packs without 
contemporaneous medical direction (eight, three day courses, in total in 6 children), some of 
which may have been unnecessary. Unfortunately we were unable to assess children to confirm 
the presence of an exacerbation; care was provided by their family doctor or by urgent care 
services as the parents saw appropriate. It may be that the study intervention genuinely 
reduced the severity of exacerbations resulting in fewer hospital attendances, but not fewer 
courses of OCS.  
Many factors influence consulting behaviours in parents with sick children; our recruitment 
strategy may have selected those more likely to present to hospital. Indeed, in our population, 
the majority of exacerbations resulted in an emergency hospital attendance (~70%). It is likely 
however, that those exacerbations requiring an emergency hospital attendance were more 
severe and regardless are certainly more expensive to the provider, and so we believe that the 
reduction seen is of clinical importance. 
In order to establish that the reduction in exacerbations seen was not due to changes in 
controller medication we examined changes in prescribed medication during follow-up and 
found no difference between the groups. All treatments were prescribed by the participants’ 
usual physicians who were blind to the treatment allocation and not influenced by the study 
team. 
As there is no QOL score for asthma sufferers or caregivers validated for use in children under 
seven years, we used the PACQLQ for all participants (recognising that this has limitations), and 
the mini PAQLQ for children over seven years.  There were no between-group differences in 
quality of life (both tending to show within-group improvements).  Interestingly, despite recent

exacerbations, both groups reported good QOL and control at baseline, leaving little prospect 
of demonstrating significant between group differences.   
Children who were in the Active group complained more about the bedding than those using 
the placebo covers. It is possible that this difference in perception led to unblinding of 
individuals (i.e. believing that they must have the real covers because they are uncomfortable). 
However, we believe this is unlikely to have affected the results of the study given the objective 
nature of our outcomes. It is important to note that compliance with the covers was not 
significantly different between the groups, and adherence (>70%) appeared to be at least as 
good, if not better than, with medications usually prescribed for asthma (e.g. inhaled 
corticosteroids ~50% (34)). 
There are some other limitations to our study. All data on exacerbations and OCS use was 
reported by parents/carers and not confirmed by their primary care physician. However, we 
gathered information from parents on a 3 monthly basis and therefore recall should not be a 
significant issue and we would expect any bias to be similar across the groups. We were unable 
to measure adherence to prescribed treatment within this study, and although it is unlikely that 
one arm was more adherent than the other, we cannot exclude this from having occurred. 
Evidence from previous studies suggest that viruses and allergens in sensitised individuals act 
synergistically to increase the risk of asthma exacerbation and hospitalisation. As we have no 
information on the trigger for individual exacerbations (viral or otherwise) we were unable to 
perform an analysis to identify whether the effectiveness of the intervention was dependent 
upon the trigger.

CONCLUSIONS 
We found that the simple and relatively cheap intervention of mite allergen impermeable bed 
encasings, costing around £130/US $200, is effective in reducing emergency hospital 
attendance with severe asthma exacerbations. In the population we have studied we estimate 
that approximately 8 children would need to be treated in order to prevent one child having 
any hospital attendances in the following year. It is likely that there is a subgroup of children in 
whom the intervention is more beneficial and although our subgroup analysis would suggest 
this might be younger, mono-sensitised children in non-smoking households, further research is 
required to clarify this.

Supplementary Methods 
Dust sampling methodology. 
1. Dust sample collection 
Reservoir dust samples were collected from the living room floor and the child’s mattress. Dust 
samples were collected by vacuuming a 1m2 area using a Medivac dust sampler (airflow 45 l/s; 
Medivac Plc, Wilmslow, Cheshire, UK) for 2 minutes in a standardised fashion. The sampling 
head was loaded with a stainless steel mesh filter, to remove particles >300µm diameter, 
allowing a sample of fine dust to be collected onto a 5 µm pore size vinyl filter (Plastok 
Associates Ltd, Wirral, UK). Immediately after collection, the dust sample was transferred into a 
pre-weighed Petri dish and coded. The filled Petri dish was weighed to calculate the mass of 
fine dust collected and sample was stored at 4oC until extraction.  After each sample collection 
the sampling head was cleaned using 70% isopropyl alcohol.  
2. Extraction 
A 100 mg aliquot of the dust was then extracted by rotation with 2 ml borate-buffered saline 
with 0.1% Tween20 pH 8.0, at room temperature for 2 hours before being centrifuged for 20 
minutes at 2500 rpm at 4oC. The supernatant was stored at -20oC until analysed for allergen 
content. 
3. Measurement of house dust mite allergen 
As the dominant mite species in the UK is Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, we chose to 
measure the major allergen Der p 1 in the dust samples collected. In the UK, in previous studies 
Dermatophagoides farina accounts for  ~ 0.5% of pyroglyphid mites collected and therefore Der 
f 1 was not measured 1.  
4. Der p 1 ELISA 
All samples were assayed for content of major Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergen Der p 
1 using monoclonal antibody (mAb) based ELISA (Indoor Biotechnologies, Cardiff, UK) using the 
technique described by Luczynska et al 2 
Ninety-six well micro titre plates (Immulon II Dynatech) were coated with 100µl of mAb 5H8 
(0.1ml of 1/1000 dilution 5H8 in 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6), overnight at 
4oC. The wells were then washed twice with phosphate buffered saline-0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4 
(PBS-T) and patted dry. The wells were then blocked by adding 100µl of 1% bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) PBS-T to each well and incubating for 30 minutes at room temperature. Each 
well was washed twice with PBS-T.  100µl of diluted dust samples (starting at 1 in 5) were 
added and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. A control curve was

generated by adding doubling dilutions of the Universal Allergen Standard (containing 
2500ng/ml Der p 1)  ranging from 250 – 0.5ng/ml Der p 1 in 1% BSA, PBS-T.  The wells were 
then washed 5 times with PBS-T, and then incubated with 100µl of diluted biotinylated anti- 
Der p 1 mAb 4C1(1/1000 dilution in 1% BSA, PBS-T) for 1 hour. The wells were washed 5 times 
with PBS-T and then incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with 100µl Streptavidin 
Peroxidase (Sigma S5512, 0.25mg reconstituted in 1ml distilled water) diluted to 1/1000 with 
1%BSA PBS-T. The wells were washed a further 5 times and the assays were developed by 
adding  100µl of 1mM azino-di(3 ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid) (ABTS) in 70mM citrate 
phosphate buffer, pH 4.2 and 1/1000 dilution of H2O2. The plates were read using an EpochTM 
Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek® Instruments, Inc., Vermont, USA) when the 
absorbance (405nm) reached 2.0-2.4.    
Results were then calculated as µg Der p 1 per gram of fine dust collected (µg/g) or as total Der 
p 1 allergen collected (ng). The lower limit of detection for Der p 1 was 0.05µg/g.

Bedding Care instructions (given to all participants) 
The bedding you have been provided with need not be washed. In the event of an accident or 
spillage on the bedding please wash at 40oC on a normal cycle. For assistance with any matter 
regarding the bedding please call the study team on 0161291xxxx 
Index of multiple deprivation 
Index of multiple deprivation (IMD) as a marker of socioeconomic status was calculated from 
the postcode (serves a similar function to US zip code; each postcode relates to on average 15 
homes in a small geographic area) using http://tools.npeu.ox.ac.uk/imd/. Both the absolute 
value and the deprivation quintile group compared to national data for England were 
calculated.  
Exploratory Subgroup Analyses 
To identify characteristics of subjects most likely to respond to treatment we conducted 
subgroup analyses (not pre-specified) based on age, GINA step, sensitisation status, exposure to 
passive smoking and socioeconomic status.22 To assess whether any of the characteristics 
differed significantly between the randomisation groups in their effect on time to event, an 
interaction term was used. For each characteristic, the interaction term was added to the full 
multivariable Cox regression model and also to a model with just the characteristic and 
randomisation group.

Table E4 - Asthma control and quality of life questionnaire scores, compared 
between groups at each time point separately. 
Measurements of asthma related quality of life and control were requested at 1 month, 4 
month 8 months and 12 months by questionnaire, but completion rates were poor. For 
example for ACQ only 25 subjects in the Active group and 26 subjects in the placebo group 
completed the questionnaires at all time points. Furthermore, measurements could not be 
collected at baseline as all subjects had recently suffered an exacerbation as this was an 
inclusion criterion for the study; therefore it was not possible to adjust for baseline measures. 
PACQLQ and PAQLQ’s high score indicates better quality of life (1-7). ACQ low score indicates 
better control (0-6).
