SUMMARY
Patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)
commonly experience aberrant tactile sensitivity,
yet the neural alterations underlying somatosensory
dysfunction and the extent to which tactile deficits
contribute to ASD characteristics are unknown. We
report that mice harboring mutations in Mecp2,
Gabrb3, Shank3, and Fmr1 genes associated with
ASDs in humans exhibit altered tactile discrimina-
tion and hypersensitivity to gentle touch. Deletion
of Mecp2 or Gabrb3 in peripheral somatosen-
sory neurons causes mechanosensory dysfunction
through loss of GABAA receptor-mediated presynap-
tic inhibition of inputs to the CNS. Remarkably, tactile
defects resulting from Mecp2 or Gabrb3 deletion in
somatosensory neurons during development, but
not in adulthood, cause social interaction deficits
and anxiety-like behavior. Restoring Mecp2 expres-
sion exclusively in the somatosensory neurons of
Mecp2-null mice rescues tactile sensitivity, anxiety-
like behavior, and social interaction deficits, but not
lethality, memory, or motor deficits. Thus, mechano-
sensory processing defects contribute to anxiety-
like behavior and social interaction deficits in ASD
mouse models.
INTRODUCTION
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a highly prevalent class
of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairments
in social communication and interactions, as well as restricted
and repetitive behaviors. Strikingly, 95% of individuals with
ASDs also exhibit aberrant reactivity to sensory stimuli, including
tactile stimuli. Indeed, a majority of ASD patients (60.9%) report
altered tactile sensitivity in both glabrous (smooth) and hairy skin
(Tomchek and Dunn, 2007) and increased sensitivity to vibration
and thermal pain (Blakemore et al., 2006; Cascio et al., 2008).
As with idiopathic or non-syndromic ASDs, pervasive develop-
mental disorders that cause syndromic forms of ASDs are also
associated with altered somatosensation (Tomchek and Dunn,
2007). For example, tactile hypersensitivity is common in pa-
tients with Rett Syndrome, which is caused by mutations in
the X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2) gene (Badr
et al., 1987; Amir et al., 1999). Similarly, abnormalities in tactile
perception are observed in patients with fragile X syndrome,
which is highly associated with ASDs and caused by mutations
in Fmr1 (Rogers et al., 2003). Moreover, an inverse correlation
exists between the presence of ASD traits in human subjects
and their neural responses to C-low-threshold mechanore-
ceptor-targeted affective touch (Voos et al., 2013).
Although abnormalities in touch perception are commonly
reported in ASDs, the underlying neural mechanisms are un-
known. The first step leading to normal touch perception is the
activation of low-threshold mechanosensory neurons (LTMRs)
with highly specialized endings in the skin. LTMRs respond to
innocuous mechanical stimuli and mediate perception of object
shape, texture, skin stroking, skin indentation, hair movement,
and vibration (Abraira and Ginty, 2013). As with all mammalian
somatosensory neurons, cutaneous LTMRs are pseudo-unipo-
lar neurons with one peripheral axonal branch that innervates
the skin and another branch that innervates the CNS. While
LTMR central projections terminate in a somatotopic manner
within the spinal cord (SC) dorsal horn, forming synaptic con-
tacts onto both locally projecting interneurons and postsynaptic
dorsal column projection neurons (PSDCs), a large subset of
myelinated LTMRs also send an axonal branch via the dorsal
column that terminates in the dorsal column nuclei (DCN) of
the brainstem. Thus, the SC dorsal horn and DCN are initial sites
of integration and processing of innocuous touch information
then conveyed to higher brain centers. In principle, LTMRs,
the SC dorsal horn, DCN, thalamus, and cortex represent poten-
tial loci of dysfunction underlying impairments in touch percep-
tion in ASD patients.
The great majority of ASD research has focused on brain-spe-
cific mechanisms and circuits, with little attention to potential
contributions of the peripheral nervous system and SC to ASD
phenotypes. Systemic virally mediated replacement of Mecp2
in Mecp2 hemizygous (Mecp2�/y) male mice effectively res-
cues behavioral deficits relevant to some ASD phenotypes. In
contrast, intracranial viral delivery of Mecp2 only mildly improves
behavioral phenotypes (Garg et al., 2013). These findings
prompted us to investigate the role of peripheral nervous system
or SC deficiencies caused by the disruption of Mecp2 or other
ASD-associated genes in cutaneous tactile sensitivity. More-
over, as early childhood tactile experiences are critical for the
acquisition of normal social behavior and communication skills

 in humans and rodents (Hertenstein et al., 2006), we hypothe-
sized that tactile processing deficits in ASDs contribute to aber-
rant cognitive and social behaviors.
In the present study we have used a range of mouse ASD
genetic models combined with behavioral testing, synaptic
analyses, and electrophysiology to define both the etiology of
aberrant tactile sensitivity in ASDs and the contribution of so-
matosensory dysfunction to the expression of ASD-like traits.
Our findings reveal a SC locus of mechanosensory neuron
synaptic dysfunction underlying aberrant tactile perception in
ASDs and a contribution of tactile processing deficiency during
development to anxiety-like behavior and social interaction def-
icits in adulthood.
RESULTS
ASD Mouse Models Exhibit Aberrant Innocuous Touch
Sensitivity
We asked whether mouse models of syndromic and non-syn-
dromic forms of ASDs exhibit deficits in texture discrimination
and tactile sensitivity. We examined Mecp2-null mice, as well
as mice with an arginine-to-cysteine missense mutation in
Mecp2 (Mecp2R306C), a common mutation found in human RTT
patients (Lyst et al., 2013). Mice harboring mutations in Shank3
and Fmr1, which in humans are associated with forms of ASDs
and fragile X syndrome, respectively (Pec
¸ a et al., 2011; Spencer
et al., 2005), were also analyzed. Thus, six-week-old male
Mecp2�/y, Mecp2R306C, Shank3B+/�, and Fmr1�/y mice and con-
trol littermates were subjected to tactile-based tasks to assess
mechanosensory behaviors and sensitivity.
To assess glabrous skin tactile discrimination abilities in mice,
we developed a texture-specific novel object recognition test
(textured NORT), utilizing 4-cm-long cubes that differ only in
texture (rough or smooth; Figures 1A, 1B, and S1; see the Exper-
imental Procedures). While control mice preferentially explored
the cube with novel texture in this assay, Mecp2�/y, Mecp2R306C,
Shank3B+/�, and Fmr1�/y mice did not (Figure 1C). The deficits
are specific for textured NORT, and not a general lack of nov-
elty-seeking behavior, as mutant mice performed comparably
to control mice on a control NORT in which objects differed in
color and shape, but not in texture, when the retention period
was 5 min (Figure 1D). Moreover, the amount of time spent
investigating objects during NORT did not differ between mu-
tants and control littermates (Figure S2A). This indicates that
mutant mice did not exhibit an aversion to the objects, and
they did not avoid tactile exploration. Mecp2�/y, Mecp2R306C,
Shank3B+/�, and Fmr1�/y mice did not show a preference for
novel colored/shaped objects when the retention period was
increased to 1 hr (Figure 1E). This is consistent with previous
studies demonstrating that mice with mutations in these genes
have learning/memory deficits (Arnett et al., 2014; Garg et al.,
2013; Wang et al., 2011). Thus, four distinct ASD/RTT mouse
models exhibit impairments in glabrous skin-based texture
discrimination.
Next, we asked whether Mecp2�/y, Mecp2R306C, Shank3B+/�,
and Fmr1�/y mice exhibit abnormalities in hairy skin sensitivity
and/or sensorimotor gating using a novel tactile prepulse inhibi-
tion (tactile PPI) assay. For tactile PPI, the ‘‘prepulse’’ is a light air
puff (0.9 PSI) applied to back hairy skin, and this prepulse is
followed by a broadband white noise acoustic startle ‘‘pulse’’
of 125 decibels (dB) to elicit an acoustic startle reflex. Air puffs
were administered to the backs of mice at various times (inter-
stimulus intervals [ISIs]) prior to the acoustic startle pulse to
assess both hairy skin sensitivity and sensorimotor gating (Fig-
ure 1F). We have found that a light air puff prepulse robustly re-
duces the magnitude of an acoustic startle response in control
mice (Figures 1G and 1H). Tactile PPI is mediated by cutaneous
sensory neuron detection of the tactile prepulse because it
is abolished when back hairy skin is pretreated with lidocaine
to silence cutaneous sensory nerve fibers or when the air puff
stimulus is pointed away from the mouse (Figures 1G, 1H, S1I,
and S1J).
Interestingly,Mecp2�/y, Mecp2R306C, Shank3B+/�, andFmr1�/y
mice all exhibited enhanced tactile PPI responses, compared to
control littermates (Figure 1J). For comparison, all ASD and con-
trol mice were also tested on an acoustic version of PPI, with vary-
ing acoustic prepulse intensities. Mecp2�/y and Mecp2R306C mice
exhibited an increase in acoustic PPI at a prepulse intensity 15 dB
above background, while the other mutant lines tested showed
no acoustic PPI deficits (Figure S2B). Mecp2�/y and Mecp2R306C
mice also reacted significantly less to the 125-dB startle noise,
indicative of motor impairments (Figure 1I). Tactile PPI alterations
in the mutants are, at least in part, due to hypersensitivity to
the air puff prepulse stimulus itself, as Mecp2�/y, Mecp2R306C,
Shank3B+/�, and Fmr1�/y mutant mice displayed significantly
increased responses to the air puff alone (Figure 1K), but not to
an acoustic prepulse alone (Figure S2C), compared to control
littermates.
Somatosensory Neuron Deletion of Mecp2 in Either
Development or Adulthood Leads to Aberrant Tactile
Sensitivity
We sought to identify the cellular locus of tactile sensory
dysfunction in Mecp2 mutants using a conditional Mecp2 allele.
Crossing Mecp2 floxed (Mecp2f/y) mice (Guy et al., 2001) with
mice expressing Cre recombinase in specific cell types allowed
for Mecp2 deletion and loss of MECP2 protein in either excitatory
neurons in the forebrain (Emx1Cre; Mecp2f/y) (Gorski et al., 2002),
all cells caudal to cervical level 2 (Cdx2Cre; Mecp2f/y) (Akyol
et al., 2008), or all DRG and trigeminal somatosensory neurons
(AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y) (Hasegawa et al., 2007) (Figure 2A).
Deletion of Mecp2 in cells below the neck (Cdx2Cre; Mecp2f/y)
recapitulated the reduced lifespan observed in Mecp2�/y and
Mecp2R306C mutant mice; the majority of these mice did not sur-
vive beyond 16 weeks (Figure 2B), likely due to respiratory and/or
cardiovascular deficits. Similar to Mecp2�/y mice, Cdx2Cre;
Mecp2f/y mutants also displayed abnormal breathing patterns,
decreased respiratory tidal volume and rate, and decreased
CO2 expiration as measured by plethysmography (Figures
S3E–S3H). Cdx2Cre; Mecp2f/y mutants also exhibited reduced
body weight, a hindlimb-clasping phenotype, and motor deficits
as measured using an accelerating rotarod, but not reduced
brain size (Figures S3D, S3I, and S3J). In contrast, mice lacking
Mecp2
exclusively
in
somatosensory
neurons
(AdvillinCre;
Mecp2f/y) exhibited normal body weight, brain size, hindlimb
extension, motor performance, respiration (Figures S3D–S3J),

 and lifespan (Figure 2B). Thus, Mecp2 deletion in primary so-
matosensory neurons does not lead to overt RTT phenotypes.
To ask whether Mecp2 in excitatory neurons of the forebrain,
SC, and/or peripheral somatosensory neurons contribute to
tactile perception deficits, we next subjected Emx1Cre; Mecp2f/y,
Cdx2Cre; Mecp2f/y, and AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y mice to textured and
control NORT, as well as tactile and acoustic PPI. Strikingly,
Cdx2Cre; Mecp2f/y and AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y mice, but not
Emx1Cre; Mecp2f/y mice, had a significant deficit in textured
NORT, even though both conditional mutants were able to
discriminate between objects that differ in color and shape in
both the 5-min and 1-hr retention period tests (Figures 2C–2E).
Females with heterozygous deletion of Mecp2 in somatosensory
neurons (AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/+) also exhibited deficits in textured

 NORT (Figure 2C). We did not observe any differences in object
exploration time in any condition or genotype tested (Figure S3A).
Similarly, deletion of Mecp2 in neurons below the neck or in
primary somatosensory neurons led to tactile hypersensitivity
in hairy skin, as measured by tactile PPI (Figure 2G). These
changes are, at least in part, due to hypersensitivity to tactile
stimuli applied to hairy skin because Cdx2Cre; Mecp2f/y,
AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y, and AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/+ mutants exhibited
enhanced responses to air puff alone (Figure 2H), but not to an
acoustic prepulse (Figure S3C), compared to control littermates.
As expected, Cdx2Cre; Mecp2f/y mice showed a significant
reduction in startle amplitude compared to control littermates
(Figure 2F). Mice with deletion of Mecp2 in excitatory forebrain
neurons (Emx1Cre; Mecp2f/y) performed similarly to control litter-
mates on the tactile PPI assay and did not show increased
responsiveness to air puff stimuli alone (Figures 2G and 2H).
We also addressed whether Mecp2 expression in primary
somatosensory neurons is required in adulthood for normal
tactile discrimination and sensitivity. For this, Mecp2f/y mice
were crossed to an AdvillinCreERT2 mouse line (Lau et al., 2011),
enabling excision of floxed alleles in primary somatosensory
neurons of adult mice following treatment with tamoxifen.
Administration of 1 mg tamoxifen per day for 5 days beginning
at P28 resulted in deletion of Mecp2 in >90% of DRG neurons,
whereas Mecp2 expression in the SC and brain was unaltered
(Figure 2A). Interestingly, adult deletion of Mecp2 in primary so-
matosensory neurons (in either males or heterozygous females)
recapitulated the tactile behavioral deficits observed in the
developmental Mecp2 mutants; both textured NORT and tactile
PPI were impaired (Figures 2C–2H). Thus, Mecp2 expression in
primary somatosensory neurons is necessary for both normal
glabrous skin tactile discrimination and hairy skin sensitivity.
Sensory Neuron Deletion of Mecp2 Leads to a Decrease
in GABRB3 in the Dorsal Horn, and Gabrb3 Expression in
Sensory Neurons Is Required for Tactile Sensitivity
Multiple etiologies of ASDs exist, and one common observation
among ASD animal models is a deficit in GABAergic signaling
(Braat and Kooy, 2015). Indeed, mutations in the GABAA recep-
tor subunit b3 (Gabrb3) gene are associated with ASDs in hu-
mans, and mice harboring a Gabrb3 mutation (Gabrb3+/�) exhibit
social behavior deficits, hypersensitivity to both thermal and me-
chanical stimuli, and sensorimotor impairments (DeLorey et al.,
2008, 2011). Therefore, we asked whether GABRB3 is localized
to synapses between LTMR subtypes and their postsynaptic
partners in the SC dorsal horn. Previous work has shown that
the b3 subunit of the GABAA receptor is associated with sensory
terminals in the SC, both during development and in adulthood
(Zeilhofer et al., 2012). Furthermore, the b3 subunit is an obligate
component of GABAA receptors in DRG neurons, as it is the pre-
dominant b subunit expressed in DRG neurons in adulthood (Ma
et al., 1993). We have found that GABRB3-containing GABAA re-
ceptors are indeed localized to presynaptic compartments of
Ab- and Ad-LTMR central terminals in the dorsal horn (Figure 3A).
GABRB3 puncta are also found on presynaptic primary sensory
neuron terminals associated with PSDC projection neurons (data
not shown). The finding that GABRB3 is associated with LTMR
central terminals is consistent with previous work showing that
GABAA receptors containing GABRB3 modulate sensory input
to the SC (Chen et al., 2014). SC sections from Cdx2Cre;
Gabrb3f/f mutant mice revealed a 75% loss in the number
of GABRB3 puncta in the dorsal horn, compared to controls
(Figures S4A and S4B). GABRB3 puncta associated with axonal
fibers emanating from DRG sensory neurons were completely
absent in AdvillinCre; Gabrb3f/f mice (Figures S4C and S4D),
demonstrating both antibody specificity and primary somato-
sensory neurons as the cellular source of most dorsal horn
GABRB3 puncta.
Mecp2 deficiency leads to decreased expression of Gabrb3 in
brains of both humans and mice (Samaco et al., 2005). To deter-
mine whether tactile perception abnormalities in Mecp2 mutants
are associated with a loss of GABRB3-containing GABAA recep-
tors on primary somatosensory neuron terminals in the dorsal
horn, GABRB3 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed us-
ing SC sections of Mecp2 mutant mice and control littermates.
Mecp2-null mice exhibited >80% reduction in GABRB3 puncta
associated with vGlut1+ terminals in the dorsal horn (Figures
3B and 3C). Strikingly, AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y mutant mice ex-
hibited �70% loss of GABRB3 puncta associated with vGlut1+
terminals in the dorsal horn (Figures 3D and 3E), indicating a
reduction in GABRB3-containing GABAA receptors on presyn-
aptic terminals of primary somatosensory neurons.
Our findings suggested a model in which tactile perception
abnormalities in Mecp2 mutants arise due to a reduction in
presynaptic GABAA receptors on LTMR terminals in the dorsal
horn and thus a lack of presynaptic inhibition (PSI) of LTMR in-
puts to the CNS. If this is the case, then deletion of the ASD-
associated gene Gabrb3 should recapitulate the Mecp2 mutant
tactile behavior phenotype. Indeed, as with Mecp2 mutants,
Gabrb3+/� mice exhibited deficits in both glabrous skin tactile
discrimination and hairy skin sensitivity (Figures 3F–3K). Next,
we generated AdvillinCre; Gabrb3f/+, AdvillinCre; Gabrb3f/f, and
AdvillinCreERT2; Gabrb3f/+ mutant mice, using a Gabrb3 floxed
mouse line (Chen et al., 2014), to ask whether reduced
Gabrb3 expression selectively in somatosensory neurons during
development and in adulthood leads to tactile response abnor-
malities in adults. AdvillinCre; Gabrb3f/+, AdvillinCre; Gabrb3f/f,
and AdvillinCreERT2; Gabrb3f/+ mice exhibited deficits in textured
NORT, while no impairments were observed in control NORT as-
says (Figures 3F–3H and S4E). Moreover, Gabrb3 conditional
mutant mice from each group exhibited enhanced responses
to air puff stimuli alone and enhanced tactile PPI, but were not
different from control littermates in acoustic PPI performance
(Figures 3I–3K, S4F, and S4G). Thus, mice lacking Gabrb3 in pri-
mary somatosensory neurons phenocopy mice lacking Mecp2 in
somatosensory neurons, implicating a functional link between
these ASD-associated genes.
Sensory Neuron Deletion of Either Mecp2 or Gabrb3
Induces A-Fiber Synapse Hyperexcitability
Our findings led us to hypothesize that the loss of GABAA recep-
tor-dependent PSI of LTMR inputs in the dorsal horn causes
excessive LTMR excitatory drive onto postsynaptic SC neu-
rons and thus increases responsiveness to tactile stimuli in
both Mecp2 and Gabrb3 mutant mice. This hypothesis was
tested using both SC slice (Figure 4) and intact isolated SC

 (Figure 5) electrophysiological measurements. We recorded
from retrogradely labeled PSDC projection neurons in SC slices
with dorsal roots attached, enabling direct electrical stimulation
of the roots to evoke postsynaptic responses in PSDCs (Fig-
ure 4A). To selectively monitor quantal events from primary
somatosensory neurons onto PSDCs, as opposed to global
miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) that reflect
both primary afferent and other, non-primary afferent synaptic
inputs, we replaced calcium in the extracellular recording
solution with strontium and evoked asynchronous quantal
EPSCs (qEPSCs) from stimulated sensory afferents (Chirila
et al., 2014; Oliet et al., 1996). Using this approach, we reliably
triggered qEPSCs in PSDCs following dorsal root stimulation at
an intensity that selectively activates A-fibers (100 mA, 0.1 ms)
(Torsney and MacDermott, 2006). Strikingly, qEPSC frequency,
but not amplitude or decay time, was increased in slices from
AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y mutants compared to slices from age-
matched controls (Figures 4B–4H; data not shown). These re-
sults indicate that enhanced presynaptic release probability,
and not a change in the number and/or biophysical properties
of postsynaptic glutamate receptors, accounts for increased
synaptic transmission between mechanosensory afferents lack-
ing Mecp2 and PSDCs. A similar finding of enhanced presynap-
tic release probability was observed in recordings from slices
obtained from AdvillinCre; Gabrb3f/+ mice compared with con-
trols (Figures 4B–4H; data not shown). These findings suggest
a model in which neurotransmitter release probability is signifi-
cantly enhanced at A-fiber synapses in the SC dorsal horn of
mice lacking Mecp2 due to a loss of GABA-mediated PSI at
these terminals.
Sensory Neuron Deletion of Either Mecp2 or Gabrb3
Leads to Loss of PSI in the SC Dorsal Horn
We tested our model by directly measuring PSI in the dorsal horn
of both AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y and AdvillinCre; Gabrb3f/+ mutant
mice using an isolated SC preparation. In the SC dorsal horn,
PSI of LTMRs is predominantly mediated through primary
afferent depolarization (PAD) (Barker and Nicoll, 1972). PAD is
believed to be generated through a trisynaptic circuit in which
primary afferents innervate dorsal horn glutamatergic interneu-
rons, which then innervate GABAergic interneurons that form
axo-axonic synapses onto primary afferent terminals (Figure 5A).
Due to the relatively depolarized chloride reversal potential of pri-
mary somatosensory neurons, GABA acting on primary afferent
terminals leads to their depolarization, which, in turn, reduces

can be measured as a back-propagating depolarization of the
dorsal root, or dorsal root potential (DRP) (Rudomin and
Schmidt, 1999; Russo et al., 2000). Activity-dependent PSI can
thus be assessed by electrically stimulating one dorsal root

a low-threshold DRP was readily elicited
in control mice (Figure 5B). This DRP is
almost entirely inhibited by the GABAA
receptor blocker bicuculline (Figure 5B)
(Levy et al., 1971). As stimulus intensity
increases, a greater number and variety
of afferents are recruited, and DRPs in-
crease in magnitude. At maximal inten-
sity, DRPs are no longer solely GABAA
receptor dependent (Figure 5B) (Russo
et al., 2000). Evoked DRPs were greatly
diminished in both AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y
and AdvillinCre; Gabrb3f/+ mice (Figures
5C–5E). At low threshold stimulus inten-
sity, DRPs in these mice were virtually
non-existent, and as stimulus intensity
increased, small DRPs were observed.
As GABAA receptors on SC interneurons
are likely to be unaffected in AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y and AdvillinCre;
Gabrb3f/+ mice, we hypothesized that motor reflexes, as
recorded electrophysiologically from ventral roots, would be
unchanged. Indeed, motor reflexes were unaffected in both
AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y and AdvillinCre; Gabrb3f/+ mutants (data
not shown), and GABAA receptor modulation of these reflexes
was comparable to that of control mice (Figures 5F and 5G).

 These findings indicate that primary somatosensory neuron
deletion of either Mecp2 or Gabrb3 increases sensitivity to light
touch due to a deficiency of GABAA receptors on somatosensory
neuron terminals and a loss of GABAA receptor-mediated PSI.
Primary Somatosensory Neuron Deletion of Either
Mecp2 or Gabrb3 Leads to Deficits in Cognitive and
Mouse Social Behaviors
Next, we asked whether mice harboring developmental or adult
deletions of either Mecp2 or Gabrb3 in primary somatosensory
neurons exhibit anxiety-like behavior, deficits in nest building,
and/or social interactions. Mutant and control mice were first
subjected to a 10-min open-field (OF) test; mice with anxiety-
like behavior spend less time exploring the center of the chamber
and travel shorter distances (McGill et al., 2006). In agreement
with previous reports, Mecp2�/y and Gabrb3+/� mutant mice
exhibited a decrease in both the percentage of time spent in
the center of the chamber and total distance traveled during
the OF test (Figures 6A–6C, S5B, and S5C). Remarkably, mice
lacking either Mecp2 or Gabrb3 exclusively in primary somato-
sensory neurons during development (AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y, Ad-
villinCre; Gabrb3f/f, and AdvillinCre; Gabrb3f/+ mice), but not
mice in which Mecp2 or Gabrb3 was deleted in somatosensory
neurons in adulthood (AdvillinCreERT2; Mecp2f/y or AdvillinCreERT2;
Gabrb3f/+), also exhibited anxiety-like behavior compared to
control littermates (Figures 6A–6C and S5A–S5C). Whether
ASD mouse models exhibit abnormal habituation to aversive
stimuli, which is a behavior associated with anxiety in both hu-
mans and rodents (Campbell et al., 2014), was also measured.
In normal humans and mice, the startle response to loud acous-
tic stimuli decreases over time, whereas humans and rodents
with anxiety exhibit less habituation to aversive startle stimuli
(Campbell et al., 2014; Glowa et al., 1992). To assess habituation
to acoustic startle noises, we performed acoustic startle trials
before and after the PPI trials described above. Across geno-
types, control mice exhibited �30% reduction in the acoustic
startle response at the end of the session compared to re-
sponses measured at the beginning of the session (Figures 6D
and S5D). Interestingly, AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y and AdvillinCre;
Gabrb3f/f, as well as germline Mecp2 and Gabrb3 mutants, failed
to habituate to the acoustic startle noise (Figures 6D and S5D). In
contrast, mice in which either Mecp2 or Gabrb3 was deleted in
primary somatosensory neurons in adulthood (AdvillinCreERT2;
Mecp2f/y or AdvillinCreERT2; Gabrb3f/+) exhibited normal de-
creases in their startle responses over time (Figure 6D). Next,
we tested a subset of the mouse lines on an additional measure
of anxiety-like behavior in rodents, the elevated plus maze (EPM)
(McGill et al., 2006). Mecp2R306C and AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y
mutant mice spent significantly less time in the open arms of
the EPM compared to littermate controls, indicative of increased
anxiety-like behavior in these mice (Figure 6E). Conversely,
Emx1Cre;
Mecp2f/y
and
AdvillinCreERT2;
Mecp2f/y
exhibited
normal behavior in this test (Figure 6E). Thus, primary somato-
sensory neuron deletion of either Mecp2 or Gabrb3 during devel-
opment, but not in adulthood, leads to anxiety-like behavior in
mice.
Next, we assessed nest building, a socially relevant tactile
behavior of adult rodents in which both Mecp2 and Gabrb3
mutant mice display deficits (DeLorey et al., 2008; Garg et al.,
2013). Adult mice were placed in individual cages and provided
nestlets 30 min before the start of the dark cycle. 14 to 16 hours
later, nest construction was scored as previously described
using a five-point scale (Deacon, 2006). Mice with either embry-
onic or adult deletion of Mecp2 or Gabrb3 in primary somatosen-
sory neurons showed impairments in nest building behavior,
compared to control littermates, although these nesting deficits
were not as severe as those of Mecp2�/y and Mecp2R306C
mutant mice (Figures S5E and S5F).
We also implemented the three-chamber socialinteraction test,
which is used to assess both sociability and social recognition/
preference in rodents, and ASD mouse models displayed altered
behaviors in this assay (Silverman et al., 2010). Control mice with
normal social preferences spent more time exploring a novel
mouse in both the sociability and social novelty preference tests.
In contrast, several ASD mouse models, including Gabrb3+/�
mice, displayed a reduced amount of time exploring the novel
mouse in this assay (DeLorey et al., 2008). Thus, as predicted,
we observed that Mecp2�/y, Mecp2R306C, and Gabrb3+/� mice
exhibit impairments in both sessions of this test, as they did not
prefer a novel mouse compared to an empty cup (sociability
test), and they did not prefer a novel mouse to a familiar mouse
(social novelty preference test) (Figures 6F–6H and S5G–S5I;
Table S1). Mice with primary somatosensory neuron deletion
of either Mecp2 (AdvillinCre; Mecp2f/y) or Gabrb3 (AdvillinCre;
Gabrb3f/f and AdvillinCre; Gabrb3f/+) displayed comparable defi-
cits in both sociability and social novelty preference (Figures 6F–
6H; Table S1). On the other hand, mice in which either Mecp2
or Gabrb3 was deleted in adulthood (AdvillinCreERT2; Mecp2f/y or
AdvillinCreERT2; Gabrb3f/+) displayed significant preference for
the novel mouse during the sociability test, but did not display a
preferenceforanovelmousecomparedtoafamiliarmouseduring
the social novelty preference test (Figures 6G and 6H; Table S1).
To further evaluate social interactions, mice were subjected
to a tube dominance test, which allowed us to assess social
approach/avoidance behavior, as well as evaluate dominance
hierarchies in mice. These approaches can be used to assess
social impairments in ASD mouse models (Shahbazian et al.,
2002; Spencer et al., 2005). We have found that Mecp2�/y,
Mecp2R306C, and Gabrb3+/� mutant mice exhibit decreased
social dominance and aggression, as they lost the majority of
matches against control mice (Figures 6I and S5J). These results
are consistent with previous reports indicating that Mecp2-null
mice exhibit increased escape and avoidance behaviors in a
predator-threat stimulus test (Pearson et al., 2015). Similarly,
Cdx2Cre;
Mecp2f/y,
AdvillinCre;
Mecp2f/y,
and
AdvillinCre;
Gabrb3f/f mutant mice were all significantly more submissive
and lost the majority of their matches (Figures 6I and S5J). In
contrast, mice in which either Mecp2 or Gabrb3 was deleted in
somatosensory neurons in adulthood demonstrated increased
dominance, as these mice won the majority of their matches
(Figure 6I). Mice with deletion of Mecp2 in excitatory forebrain
neurons were neither submissive nor dominant in this assay.
Taken together, these results indicate that there is a develop-
mental requirement of Mecp2 and Gabrb3 in primary somato-
sensory neurons for the acquisition of certain cognitive and
social behaviors in mice.

 Mecp2 Expression in Primary Somatosensory Neurons
Is Sufficient for Normal Tactile Discrimination, PSI, and
Certain Cognitive and Social Behaviors
Whether Mecp2 in primary somatosensory neurons is sufficient
for normal tactile function was addressed by restoring Mecp2
expression exclusively in the peripheral somatosensory neurons
in a Mecp2-null background. Here, we utilized a Mecp2STOP/y
mouse line (Guy et al., 2007), in which Mecp2 is expressed
only in cells following Cre-mediated excision of a STOP codon
(Figure 7A). Expression of Mecp2 exclusively in primary somato-
sensory neurons in an otherwise Mecp2-null background (Advil-
linCre; Mecp2STOP/y; Figure 7A) rescued the deficits in textured
NORT (Figure 7D), hypersensitivity to air puff and alterations in
tactile PPI (Figures 7E and 7F) observed in Mecp2-null mutants.

Cell 166, 299–313, July 14, 2016
 We also have found that Mecp2 expression in primary somato-
sensory neurons alone is sufficient to rescue expression of
GABRB3 at presynaptic sensory neuron terminals (Figures 7B
and 7C) and normalize GABAA receptor-mediated PSI of so-
matosensory input to the dorsal horn (Figures 7G and 7H).
Remarkably, behavioral analyses of mice with expression of
Mecp2 only in primary somatosensory neurons revealed normal
levels of anxiety-like behaviors, assessed by their performances
in the OF test, habituation to acoustic startle noises, and by
EPM, whereas Mecp2STOP/y mutants showed increased anxi-
ety-like behavior in each of these tests (Figures 7I–7M). Although
AdvillinCre; Mecp2STOP/y mice displayed lower nest building
scores than controls, their values were improved relative to
Mecp2STOP/y mutants (Figure S6I). AdvillinCre; Mecp2STOP/y
mice also performed no differently than controls in either portion
of the three-chamber social interaction test (Figures 7N, 7O, and
S6J–S6L), and they exhibited neither submissive nor dominant
behavior in the tube dominance assay (Figure 7P). However,
expression of Mecp2 exclusively in primary somatosensory neu-
rons did not rescue decreased brain size, memory, motor, or
acoustic PPI abnormalities (Figure S6). Thus, Mecp2 expression
in primary somatosensory neurons in an otherwise Mecp2-null
mouse rescues tactile behavioral deficits, deficits in GABRB3
expression associated with LTMR terminals, abnormalities in
tactile PPI, anxiety-like behaviors, and a subset of the social
behavior deficits observed in Mecp2-null mutants.
DISCUSSION
The majority of ASD research has focused on brain-specific func-
tions of ASD-related genes and their impact on behavior. Here, we
report that mice harboring mutations in Mecp2, Gabrb3, Shank3,
and Fmr1, genes that when mutated in humans are associated
withASDs,exhibitalteredtactilediscrimination and hypersensitiv-
ity to gentle touch. Deletion of either Mecp2 or Gabrb3 selectively
in peripheral somatosensory neurons results in aberrant tactile
sensitivity due to a loss of PSI of somatosensory neuron transmis-
sionintheSC.Remarkably,tactileprocessingdysfunctioncaused
by developmental deletion of either Mecp2 or Gabrb3 in mecha-
nosensory neurons leads to social and cognitive behavior deficits
that recapitulate some of the core phenotypes of ASDs, including
anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, while deletion of Mecp2 or
Gabrb3 in adult primary somatosensory neurons also leads to
altered tactile sensitivity, it does not cause anxiety-like behavior
and results in more modest social behavior deficits. These find-
ings reveal an essential, cell-autonomous requirement for the
ASD-associated genes Mecp2 and Gabrb3 for mechanosensory
neuron synaptic transmission and tactile sensitivity, and they
implicate developmental somatosensory dysfunction in the gene-
sis of anxiety and aberrant social behaviors in patients with ASDs.
While ablation of Mecp2 or Gabrb3 in primary somatosensory
neurons during either development or in adulthood leads to
tactile discrimination deficits and hairy skin hypersensitivity,
the behavioral deficits resulting from developmental or adult
deletion of these genes are strikingly distinct. Developmental
ablation of either Mecp2 or Gabrb3 exclusively in primary so-
matosensory neurons leads to anxiety-like behaviors, reduced
sociability, and preference for social novelty and increased sub-
missive behavior. In contrast, mice in which either Mecp2 or
Gabrb3 was deleted in primary somatosensory neurons in adult-
hood do not exhibit anxiety-like behavior, their sociability deficits
are less pronounced, and they are conversely aggressive in the
tube dominance test. Thus, tactile processing defects that man-
ifest during development or in adulthood lead to different behav-
ioral outcomes in adult mice.
Our behavioral findings are reminiscent of human, non-human
primate, and rodent tactile deprivation studies, which showed
that early life experiences and developmental tactile stimulation
are essential for proper brain development, cognition, and adult
social behaviors. Indeed, children who experienced institutional
rearing with low caregiver investment and physical handling
exhibited deficits in cognitive function, delayed, or impaired
language acquisition and social interactions and an increased
incidence of anxiety and psychiatric disorders (Frank et al.,
1996; Sheridan et al., 2012). The related anxiety-like behavior
and social interaction deficits in ASD models and in rodents
reared in the absence of normal tactile experiences lead us to
speculate the existence of a common mechanistic link between
these two conditions. Consistent with this idea, young children
with ASDs are typically averse to tactile stimuli and an aversion
to nurturing touch has been suggested to impact their develop-
ment and behavior (Cascio, 2010). On the other hand, environ-
mental enrichment, such as increased maternal licking and
grooming in mice, during early postnatal periods can improve
behavioral outcomes in ASD models (Lonetti et al., 2010).
We speculate that aberrant PSI and thus defective gain control
in the SC and brainstem renders ASD patients incapable of prop-
erly interpreting the physical world. Thus, loss of PSI of LTMR
inputs to the CNS may lead to misinterpreted or overwhelming
tactile sensations during normal physical exploration, which may
manifest as anxiety and withdrawal from social situations that
are normally associated with unpredictable and dynamic physical
interactions. It should be emphasized that sensory impairment in
ASDs is not restricted to the sense of touch. ASD patients and
the associated animal models of these disorders often exhibit vi-
sual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory abnormalities. Therefore,
impairments in multiple sensory systems during critical devel-
opmental windows may contribute to abnormal language acqui-
sition, cognition, anxiety, and social behaviors. Defining the
functional relationships between the initial stages of sensory infor-
mation processing, anxiety, and social interaction behaviors in the
mouse models described here and other ASD models may aid in
the development of novel approaches to treat patients with ASDs.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mouse Lines
Mice were group housed in standard housing on a 12-hr light/dark
cycle. Mecp2�/y, Mecp2R306C, Mecp2f/y, Mecp2STOP, Shank3B+/�, Fmr1�/y,
Gabrb3f/f, EIIaCre, Emx1Cre, Cdx2Cre, AdvillinCre, and AdvillinCreERT2 mouse
lines have been previously described, and references are included in the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures. For all experiments, experimenters
were blinded to genotype.
Behavioral Testing
Male and female mice were of mixed genetic backgrounds (C57BL/6J and
129/SvEv), except for Mecp2-null and Mecp2R306C mice, which were on a

 C57BL/6J background. Testing began at 6 weeks of age and, in most cases,
was completed by 8 weeks of age. The OF test, NORT, startle reflex/PPI,
EPM, plethysmography, rotarod, tube dominance test, nest building, and
three-chamber social interaction tests are described in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Electrophysiological Recordings
P14–P19 acute SC slices with dorsal roots attached were used for whole-cell
patch clamp recordings of PSDCs. Quantal EPSCs were recorded in ACSF
with 4-mM strontium replacing Ca2+ using a holding potential of �70 mV
and induced by dorsal root stimulation at A-fiber strength (100 mA, 0.1 ms).
For DRP measurements, isolated spinal cords with spinal roots attached
were prepared. Bipolar glass suction electrodes (inner diameter 80–120 mm)
were used to stimulate the T11-L1 dorsal root; recordings were taken from
the same root to measure afferent recruitment, from an adjacent dorsal root
to measure DRPs, and from ventral roots to measure spinal reflexes. See
the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Histological Analyses
IHC of tissue sections were performed using standard procedures (Bai et al.,
2015). For GABRB3 puncta analysis, z stack images of SC slices were taken
on a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope using a 633 oil-immersion lens
(Zeiss; Plan-Apochromat 633/na 1.40), as described in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analyses
All data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Unless otherwise stated in the
figure legend, data were analyzed using Student’s t test. Animal numbers
per group are shown in the bars or legends of each panel. See the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
