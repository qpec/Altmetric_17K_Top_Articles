quadrupedal limb coordination in birds

The evolution of flight in birds involves (i) decoupling of the primitive mode of quadrupedal locomotor coordi-
nation, with a new synchronized flapping motion of the wings while conserving alternating leg movements, 
and (ii) reduction of wing digits and loss of functional claws. Our observations show that hoatzin nestlings move 
with alternated walking coordination of the four limbs using the mobile claws on their wings to anchor them-
selves to the substrate. When swimming, hoatzin nestlings use a coordinated motion of the four limbs involving 
synchronous or alternated movements of the wings, indicating a versatile motor pattern. Last, the proportions of 
claws and phalanges in juvenile hoatzin are radically divergent from those in adults, yet strikingly similar to those of 
Archaeopteryx. The locomotor plasticity observed in the hoatzin suggests that transitional forms that retained 
claws on the wings could have also used them for locomotion.
INTRODUCTION
Birds are flying theropods that power their flight by flapping both 
wings simultaneously. Developmental data indicate that the reduc­
tion of wing digits and the loss of claws are concomitant during bird 
evolution (1) such that the wings lose their grasping function. 
Although some birds such as chukars, ducks, rails, and owls re­
tain claws on the wing (2), they do not use them for locomotion. 
Hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) nestlings, however, retain functional 
claws on the wing and have been suggested to use them to climb in 
the vegetation. This is possibly one of the most remarkable but also 
the least documented traits in this unusual bird. The first descrip­
tion of this behavior was provided by C. G. Young in 1888: “As soon 
as the young escape from the egg, they creep about with the assist­
ance of these hands, stretching out their wings and digging these 
claws into hooking on whatever they meet.” He further added that a 
“specimen, by means of these claws walked out of a calabash” (3). 
Another unusual trait in hoatzin nestlings is to escape by jumping 
into the water below the nest and to swim back to the vegetation. 
Although hoatzins are not rare, quantitative data on locomotion in 
nestlings during either climbing or swimming have never been col­
lected and references to locomotion in these animals all refer back 
to the original publication on their behavior (3).
Juvenile extant birds may provide key insights into our under­
standing of the evolutionary and functional transformations that 
took place toward the evolution of modern birds (2). Before they are 
capable of active flight, most juveniles flap their wings in the context 
of wing­assisted incline running (WAIR) to move up steep slopes. 
During WAIR, the wings generate aerodynamic forces that help the 
animal ascend obstacles (4, 5). As the synchronous wing coordina­
tion observed during flying and WAIR is shared by many birds 
across the majority of clades, it is likely basal for the group (6). The 
neuronal networks, functionally organized early during develop­
ment, drive the in­phase movements of the wings during bird loco­
motion. This determinism is so robust that the experimental substi­
tution of a brachial spinal cord segment by a lumbosacral segment 
and vice versa during the early stages of development in chickens 
leads to synchronized movements of the limbs connected to the 
brachial segment of the spinal cord and alternated movements of 
the wings connected to the lumbosacral segment (7). In that con­
text, the hoatzin is remarkable. Do hoatzin nestlings move using an 
alternating quadrupedal walk, as suggested by Young’s description 
(3), or do they use the wings and claws in an opportunistic reflex­ 
like way to grasp branches when possible, as when a newborn child 
grasps a finger (8), or do they use a kind of WAIR behavior during 
climbing, as do all other birds? Here, we provide the first quantita­
tive data on the locomotion of nestling hoatzins that inform on the 
use of the claws and the coordination pattern of the limbs. We 
filmed four nestlings, caught in nests along the Cojedes River in 
Venezuela, while moving on an inclined substrate and while swim­
ming. Whereas movements were spontaneous in water, nestlings 
needed to be encouraged to move on the inclined surface by touch­
ing their tail or hind feet. The inclined substrate was covered with a 
towel, providing grip for the claws on the wings.
RESULTS
The limbs moved in an alternating fashion, with the movement 
of a leg being followed by the movement of the contralateral wing, 
then the other leg, and the other wing (Fig. 1). The claws were 
hooked onto the substrate and the wing flexed, pulling the body 
upward. Locomotor cycles were most often irregular, as the lack of 
an immediate attachment of the claws to the substrate destabilized 
the nestling bird. When the claw did not hook into the substrate, the 
motion of the wing continued further laterally until the claw at­
tached. If it did not, the wing was reversed and a new movement 
cycle of the same wing was initiated. The quadrupedal locomotion 
observed was rather irregular with birds stopping typically after two 
or three cycles. However, the movements of the four limbs were 
coordinated. The swing phase duration of the forelimbs was longer 
than the swing phase duration of the hindlimbs (i.e., the wing duty 
factor was smaller than the foot duty factor). The time lag between

the movements was more irregular for the wings than for the legs. 
However, the tendency is clearly to move the limbs in an alternating 
way (Table 1) (9), with a coordination typical of a quadrupedal 
walking pattern [fore lag (FL), hind lag (HL), and pair lag (PL) close 
to 0.5]. This suggests that the use of the wings is not limited to an 
opportunistic grasping reflex.
The alternating coordination pattern of the wings also does not 
correspond to WAIR, where the wings flap in phase to create aero­
dynamic forces. At hatching, chukars (Alectoris chukar) can ascend 
slopes by crawling on all four limbs (6), but the wings, without claws, 
cannot anchor to the substrate. No alternated wing coordination 
has been reported. The hoatzin coordination pattern of the four 
limbs is typical of a quadrupedal walking gait, a trait lost in all other 
modern birds. This symmetrical gait (9) secures at least three points 
of contact with the substrate and is the most stable of the quadrupedal 
coordination patterns.
When placed in the pool, the nestlings swam vigorously and 
with great ease, either under water or with the head kept outside of 
the water. Irrespective of the coordination, the swimming cycles 
were rather regular, even if a bit more variable for the wings com­
pared to the legs. The wing power phases were shorter than the 
recovery phases, whereas they were longer for the legs. The coordi­
nation between the leg and the wing (PL) was variable (high SDs). 
The movements of the legs were alternated (HL close to 0.5), while 
the wings typically moved in phase (FL close to 0; Table 1) (Fig. 2). 
Out of the 50 locomotor cycles observed, only 4 of them showed 
an out­of­ 
phase coordination pattern. The coordination during 
most swimming cycles was thus generally similar to that ob­
served during WAIR (in other birds, but in a different mechanical 
context).
In a more complex environment with branches, hoatzin nest­
lings used a quadrupedal walking coordination, but due to the 
irregularity of the substrate, the coordination was far less regular 
than on our experimental substrate. The head was also used as a 
hook: It was flexed so that the base of the beak was positioned on the 
branch, the neck appearing to pull the body upward and helping the

with the substrate. The movements of the four legs are alternating: The left wing moves and grips the substrate (A). Next, the right foot moves up and touches down (B), 
followed by the right wing that moves forward (C). The left foot then moves forward and touches down (D), and the left wing moves again (E) followed by the right foot 
(F). However, the left claw was unable to grip the substrate at its most forward position (star), resulting in it moving backward until gripping the substrate (E). The lateral 
position of the wing perturbates the progression and changes the coordination pattern. The pattern is still alternated but with the left foot (G) moving before the right 
foot (I) and the right wing (H) before the left wing (J). LF, left fore (wing); RF, right fore (wing); RH, right hind (foot); LH, left hind (foot).

wings. The claws on the fingers were actively moved independent of 
the movements of the rest of the hand skeleton. Contrast­ 
enhanced 
microcomputed tomography (CT) images of a late­stage embryo 
show that the hoatzin has multiple muscles and tendons attaching 
onto the finger bones, as observed in most other birds (10–13). 
However, an additional tendon of one of the digital flexor muscles 
attaches onto the distal phalanx of the alula (Fig. 3). This likely 
allows the active gripping of the branches by the claws. A compari­
son of the proportions of the phalanges of the hoatzin nestlings with 
those of Archaeopteryx (14) shows a remarkable similarity in pro­
portions between the two (Fig. 4). The proportions in adult hoatzin 
are, however, quite different from those observed in nestlings.
DISCUSSION
Quadrupedal locomotion requires a coupling of the forelimbs, a 
coupling of the hindlimbs, and a coupling between the limb pairs at 
the level of the spinal neuronal network (9, 15). In vertebrates, loco­
motion is initiated at the level of the brainstem and generated by a 
central spinal network (16). In mammals, which are able to use 
in­phase and out­of­phase movements for each limb pair, two sets 
of commissural interneurons are involved in the right­left coordi­
nation. An inhibitory pool of neurons is activated for alternating, 
out­of­phase coordination, and an excitatory pool is activated for 
synchronous, in­phase coordination (17). Their interplay depends 
on the behavioral context and the associated locomotor speed. In 
birds, the neural network is organized early during development 
(7) and triggers in­phase movement of the wings. The in­phase flap­
ping of the wings could thus have arisen from either the loss of the 
inhibitor commissural neuron pool or its silencing. The hoatzin 
nestlings exhibit both in­phase movements during swimming and 
out­of­phase movements during climbing. This suggests that they 
have both excitatory and inhibitory connections between the inter­
neuronal networks of the limbs. The plasticity exhibited in the cou­
pling between the excitatory and inhibitory connections in the 
hoatzin nestling could then arise either from descending drive or 
from the effects of proprioceptive feedback, or both. The quadrupe­
dal coordination goes hand in hand with the presence of functional 
claws on the wing (1), since without claws the wings cannot anchor 
the body to the substrate and would thus be unable to generate the 
locomotor forces. During slow movements, the locomotor mechanics

require at least three anchoring points for stability, preventing 
the coordination of wings into an in­phase motion. Proprioceptive 
feedback may participate in the reactivation of a silent inhibitory 
motoneuron pool during quadrupedal locomotion.
Birds originate from theropods, bipedal animals that did not use 
the forelimbs for walking. Although the exact position of the hoatzin 
in the bird tree of life remains controversial (18–22), its divergence 
seems to have occurred after the origin of Paleognaths, Galloanseres, 
and other neoavian radiations (22). None of the species of these 
clades are known to use the wings for climbing. Furthermore, the 
forelimb in­phase coordination is determined early in the develop­
ment in the chicken (Gallus gallus) (7), a Galloanseres species from 
a clade more basal than the Opisthocomiformes (22). The quadru­
pedal walking coordination of the hoatzin nestling thus represents 
the reappearance of a trait lost during bipedal saurischian dinosaur 
evolution (23), without the loss of a trait that has arisen later in the 
evolution of birds (wing flapping during flight retained in adult 
hoatzin). The quadrupedal coordination may be the expression of 
the conservative nature of the central nervous system, with a 
basic interneural network reactivation in response to proprioceptive 
feedback, driven by the contact of the claws to the substrate. It is 
possible that the interneuronal networks show greater plasticity and 
diversity among birds than has been previously recognized due to 
a sparse sampling of “model animal” species in neurophysiological 
studies. As Archaeopteryx shows large claws on the wing similar in 
proportion to those observed in the hoatzin nestlings, the latter 
might be used as a functional analog to infer the locomotor reper­
toire in transitional forms like Archaeopteryx. Our results thus sug­
gest the existence of a larger locomotor repertoire in transitional 
forms likely including both WAIR wing flapping and quadrupedal 
limb coordination during climbing allowed by the presence of claws 
on wings (24).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and filming
Animals were caught in October 2014 along the Cojedes River near the 
town of El Baul under permit number 950 issued by the Venezuelan 
government. Animals were transported back to the field labora­
tory and filmed with three HDR­CX740VE Sony cameras at 50 Hz. 
Animals were induced to climb up an inclined surface covered with 
a cloth to provide grip and then climb on branches. Subsequently, 
animals were induced to swim in an aquarium (100 cm × 50 cm × 50 cm) 
with a water depth of 15 cm. All the procedures were approved by 
the ethics committees of the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle 
(MNHN) (Comité Cuvier) and Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones 
Cientificas (IVIC) (COBIANIM).
CT scanning
A late­stage hoatzin embryo (egg length, 4.1 mm), four juveniles, 
and two adults were CT­scanned at the Centre for X­ray Tomog­
raphy at Ghent University (UGCT). A first in toto scan of each 
specimen was performed to get a complete overview of the mineral­
ized skeletal anatomy using the in­house developed HECTOR scanner 
(25). A total of 2400 x­ray projections over 360° were taken at 120­kV 
tube voltage and 20­W target power with a PerkinElmer detector 
(pixel pitch, 0.2 mm; exposure time, 1000 ms per image), yielding an 
isotropic voxel pitch of 20 m. Subsequently, the left wing was cut 
off of the late­stage embryo and transferred to 50% ethanol and 
phosphate­buffered saline (1 hour), after which it was treated with 
2.5% phosphomolybdic acid for 1 week, to visualize soft tissues with 
CT. The wing was then gradually transferred back to 70% ethanol 
and scanned at HECTOR under similar settings (but at 100 kV and 10 W) 
at an isotropic voxel pitch of 10 m. Virtual cross sections were 
reconstructed using the in­house developed software Octopus 
[version 8.8.2.1; (26)]. Bone and soft tissues were segmented and 
visualized using Amira (version 6.0, FEI). Proportions of the pha­
langes and claws in Archaeopteryx were measured on the basis of 
the illustrations of Griffiths (14).
Gait analysis
Climbing
On the videos, we noted the time when the limbs gripped the 
cloth and stopped moving as well as the time when the claws were 
released from the cloth. Even if the delays between the movements 
may be long and the coordination may be perturbed by additional 
grips, the coordination remained similar across the more than 20 
locomotor cycles analyzed: The movement of a wing was followed 
by the movement of the opposite foot, then the other wing moved 
followed by the other foot. Last, the first wing moved again (Fig. 1). 
The movements were, however, very slow and irregular. For our 
quantitative analysis, we kept only the cycles with stance phases 
lasting less than 10 s and swing phases less than 2 s. As the birds 
often stopped, we did not always have two successive complete cycles 
so that we calculate the gait parameters for each limb even if it was 
not possible to quantify all the parameters for all of them in a given 
cycle. The swing phase was defined as the time when the limb is off 
the substrate; the stance phase was defined as the time during which 
the claw gripped the cloth. Cycle duration was quantified as the sum 
of the swing phase duration plus the stance phase duration. The 
duty factor was defined as the participation of the stance to the total 
cycle duration (i.e., the stance duration divided by the cycle duration). 
We also calculated coordination parameters (27): The FL was defined 
as the time lag between the beginning of the two wing stance phases. 
The HL was defined as the time lag between the beginning of the 
two foot stance phases. Last, the PL was defined as the time lag 
between the stance phase of a wing and the stance phase of the 
ipsilateral foot.
Swimming
Fifty swimming cycles were observed. In four of them, the wings 
moved in phase. In all the other cases, the wings and the feet moved 
out of phase. We observed different coupling (Fig. 2) between the 
Fig. 4. Proportions of the digit phalanx in the Archaeopteryx compared to 
three hoatzin developmental stages. Values are in percent of the digit length. 
Variability is shown with white line.

forelimbs and the hindlimbs. Because of the constraints of the field 
experiments, we were not able to quantify all the cycles observed. 
We selected the sequences when the birds moved parallel to the 
camera in lateral view, allowing us to see the motion of both the 
hindlimbs. The motion of the wings was visible but not accurate 
enough to be measured on the lateral view. The two wings were 
clearly visible on the dorsal views, but the hindlimbs were often hidden 
by the wings or by reflections on the water. We selected sequences 
where it was possible to synchronize the motion of the wings and 
the legs for our quantitative analysis. We considered the power phase 
of a limb to be the phase when it moved backward and the recovery 
phase when it moved forward (hindlimbs) or laterally (wings).
