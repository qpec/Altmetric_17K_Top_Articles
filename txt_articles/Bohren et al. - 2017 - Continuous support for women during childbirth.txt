Background
Historically, women have generally been attended and supported by other women during labour. However, in hospitals worldwide,
continuous support during labour has often become the exception rather than the routine.
Objectives
The primary objective was to assess the effects, on women and their babies, of continuous, one-to-one intrapartum support compared
with usual care, in any setting. Secondary objectives were to determine whether the effects of continuous support are influenced by:
1. Routine practices and policies in the birth environment that may affect a woman’s autonomy, freedom of movement and ability
to cope with labour, including: policies about the presence of support people of the woman’s own choosing; epidural analgesia; and
continuous electronic fetal monitoring.
2. The provider’s relationship to the woman and to the facility: staff member of the facility (and thus has additional loyalties or
responsibilities); not a staff member and not part of the woman’s social network (present solely for the purpose of providing continuous
support, e.g. a doula); or a person chosen by the woman from family members and friends;
3. Timing of onset (early or later in labour);
4. Model of support (support provided only around the time of childbirth or extended to include support during the antenatal and
postpartum periods);
5. Country income level (high-income compared to low- and middle-income).
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (31 October 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO Inter-
national Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (1 June 2017) and reference lists of retrieved studies.
Selection criteria
All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials, cluster-randomised trials comparing continuous support during labour
with usual care. Quasi-randomised and cross-over designs were not eligible for inclusion.

 Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We sought
additional information from the trial authors. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.
Main results
We included a total of 27 trials, and 26 trials involving 15,858 women provided usable outcome data for analysis. These trials were
conducted in 17 different countries: 13 trials were conducted in high-income settings; 13 trials in middle-income settings; and no
studies in low-income settings. Women allocated to continuous support were more likely to have a spontaneous vaginal birth (average
RR 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.12; 21 trials, 14,369 women; low-quality evidence) and less likely to report negative
ratings of or feelings about their childbirth experience (average RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.79; 11 trials, 11,133 women; low-quality
evidence) and to use any intrapartum analgesia (average RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.96; 15 trials, 12,433 women). In addition, their
labours were shorter (MD -0.69 hours, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.34; 13 trials, 5429 women; low-quality evidence), they were less likely to
have a caesarean birth (average RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.88; 24 trials, 15,347 women; low-quality evidence) or instrumental vaginal
birth (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.96; 19 trials, 14,118 women), regional analgesia (average RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99; 9 trials,
11,444 women), or a baby with a low five-minute Apgar score (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85; 14 trials, 12,615 women). Data from
two trials for postpartum depression were not combined due to differences in women, hospitals and care providers included; both
trials found fewer women developed depressive symptomatology if they had been supported in birth, although this may have been a
chance result in one of the studies (low-quality evidence). There was no apparent impact on other intrapartum interventions, maternal
or neonatal complications, such as admission to special care nursery (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.25; 7 trials, 8897 women; low-
quality evidence), and exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point (average RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.16; 4 trials, 5584 women;
low-quality evidence).
Subgroup analyses suggested that continuous support was most effective at reducing caesarean birth, when the provider was present in a
doula role, and in settings in which epidural analgesia was not routinely available. Continuous labour support in settings where women
were not permitted to have companions of their choosing with them in labour, was associated with greater likelihood of spontaneous
vaginal birth and lower likelihood of a caesarean birth. Subgroup analysis of trials conducted in high-income compared with trials
in middle-income countries suggests that continuous labour support offers similar benefits to women and babies for most outcomes,
with the exception of caesarean birth, where studies from middle-income countries showed a larger reduction in caesarean birth. No
conclusions could be drawn about low-income settings, electronic fetal monitoring, the timing of onset of continuous support or model
of support.
Risk of bias varied in included studies: no study clearly blinded women and personnel; only one study sufficiently blinded outcome
assessors. All other domains were of varying degrees of risk of bias. The quality of evidence was downgraded for lack of blinding in
studies and other limitations in study designs, inconsistency, or imprecision of effect estimates.
Authors’ conclusions
Continuous support during labour may improve outcomes for women and infants, including increased spontaneous vaginal birth,
shorter duration of labour, and decreased caesarean birth, instrumental vaginal birth, use of any analgesia, use of regional analgesia,
low five-minute Apgar score and negative feelings about childbirth experiences. We found no evidence of harms of continuous labour
support. Subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution, and considered as exploratory and hypothesis-generating, but evidence
suggests continuous support with certain provider characteristics, in settings where epidural analgesia was not routinely available, in
settings where women were not permitted to have companions of their choosing in labour, and in middle-income country settings,
may have a favourable impact on outcomes such as caesarean birth. Future research on continuous support during labour could focus
on longer-term outcomes (breastfeeding, mother-infant interactions, postpartum depression, self-esteem, difficulty mothering) and
include more woman-centred outcomes in low-income settings.

Continuous support for women during childbirth
What is the issue?
In the past, women have been cared for and supported by other women during labour and birth, and have had someone with them
throughout, which we call ‘continuous support’. However, in many countries more women are giving birth in hospital rather than at
2

 home. This has meant continuous support during labour has become the exception rather than the norm. The aim of this Cochrane
Review was to understand the effect of continuous support on a woman during labour and childbirth, and on her baby. We collected
and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question (search date: October 2016).
Why is this important?
Research shows that women value and benefit from the presence of a support person during labour and childbirth. This support may
include emotional support (continuous presence, reassurance and praise) and information about labour progress. It may also include
advice about coping techniques, comfort measures (comforting touch, massage, warm baths/showers, encouraging mobility, promoting
adequate fluid intake and output) and speaking up when needed on behalf of the woman. Lack of continuous support during childbirth
has led to concerns that the experience of labour and birth may have become dehumanised.
Modern obstetric care frequently means women are required to experience institutional routines. These may have adverse effects on
the quality, outcomes and experience of care during labour and childbirth. Supportive care during labour may enhance physiological
labour processes, as well as women’s feelings of control and confidence in their own strength and ability to give birth. This may reduce
the need for obstetric intervention and also improve women’s experiences.
What evidence did we find?
We found 26 studies that provided data from 17 countries, involving more than 15,000 women in a wide range of settings and
circumstances. The continuous support was provided either by hospital staff (such as nurses or midwives), or women who were not
hospital employees and had no personal relationship to the labouring woman (such as doulas or women who were provided with a
modest amount of guidance on providing support). In other cases, the support came from companions of the woman’s choice from her
own network (such as her partner, mother, or friend).
Women who received continuous labour support may be more likely to give birth ’spontaneously’, i.e. give birth vaginally with neither
ventouse nor forceps nor caesarean. In addition, women may be less likely to use pain medications or to have a caesarean birth, and may
be more likely to be satisfied and have shorter labours. Postpartum depression could be lower in women who were supported in labour,
but we cannot be sure of this due to the studies being difficult to compare (they were in different settings, with different people giving
support). The babies of women who received continuous support may be less likely to have low five-minute Apgar scores (the score
used when babies’ health and well-being are assessed at birth and shortly afterwards). We did not find any difference in the numbers of
babies admitted to special care, and there was no difference found in whether the babies were breastfed at age eight weeks. No adverse
effects of support were identified. Overall, the quality of the evidence was all low due to limitations in study design and differences
between studies.
What does this mean?
Continuous support in labour may improve a number of outcomes for both mother and baby, and no adverse outcomes have been
identified. Continuous support from a person who is present solely to provide support, is not a member of the woman’s own network,
is experienced in providing labour support, and has at least a modest amount of training (such as a doula), appears beneficial. In
comparison with having no companion during labour, support from a chosen family member or friend appears to increase women’s
satisfaction with their experience. Future research should explore how continuous support can be best provided in different contexts.

This is an update of a review last published in 2013 (Hodnett
2013).
Description of the condition
Historically and cross-culturally, women have been attended and
supported by other women during labour and birth. However,
since the middle of the twentieth century, in many countries most
women gave birth in hospital rather than at home, and continuous
support during labour has become the exception rather than the
routine. Concerns about dehumanisation of women’s birth expe-
riences (in high-, middle-, and low-income countries) have led to
calls for a return to continuous, one-to-one support by women for
women during labour (Klaus 2002). Research has demonstrated
that women benefit from and value the presence of a support per-
son during labour, to provide psychological, physical, emotional,
informational and practical support (Kabakian-Khasholian 2015).
This support person may act as an advocate for the woman, for
example by helping to communicate her preferences to a health
worker, and also provides encouragement, reassurance, and phys-
ical comfort. A support person may also help to communicate
to the woman about her progress through labour, suggest coping
techniques, and support her decision-making. Two World Health
Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend a companion of the
woman’s choice during labour and childbirth, to improve labour
outcomes and women’s satisfaction with services (World Health
Organization 2015; World Health Organization 2016).
Description of the intervention
Common elements of continuous support during childbirth in-
clude emotional support (e.g. continuous presence, reassurance
and praise), information about labour progress and advice regard-
ing coping techniques, comfort measures (e.g. comforting touch,
massage, warm baths/showers, encouraging mobility, promoting
adequate fluid intake and output) and advocacy (e.g. helping the
woman to articulate her wishes to others). The period of support
for this intervention varies greatly across studies and contexts. For
example, some doula programs may initiate support during the
pregnancy, provide continuous support during labour and child-
birth, and provide support through three months postpartum.
Other programs focus specifically on facility-based care, and con-
tinuous support is provided from around the time of admission
through the birth. Definitions for what constitutes “continuous”
support vary across trials and contexts. For example, “continuous”
is defined as “no interruption” (Langer 1998), “minimum of 80%
of the time” (Hodnett 2002), and “as continuously as possible”
(Hofmeyr 1991) across three large trials in this review.
For the purposes of this review, we have defined continuous sup-
port as some combination of comfort measures, emotional sup-
port, provision of information, and advocacy on behalf of the
woman, provided from at least early labour (before 6 cm dila-
tion) or within one hour of hospital admission (for admission with
greater than or equal to 6 cm dilation), through until at least the
birth, and provided by a person whose sole responsibility is to
provide support to the woman, as continuously as practical in a
given context.
How the intervention might work
Two complementary theoretical explanations have been offered
for the effects of labour support on childbirth outcomes. Both ex-
planations hypothesise that labour support enhances labour phys-
iology and mothers’ feelings of control and competence, reducing
reliance on medical interventions. The first theoretical explana-
tion considers possible mechanisms when companionship during
labour is used in stressful, threatening and disempowering clini-
cal birth environments (Hofmeyr 1991). During labour, women
may be uniquely vulnerable to environmental influences; modern
obstetric care frequently subjects women to institutional routines,
high rates of intervention, unfamiliar personnel, lack of privacy
and other conditions that may be experienced as harsh. These con-
ditions may have an adverse effect on the progress of labour and on
the development of feelings of competence and confidence; this
may in turn impair adjustment to parenthood and establishment
of breastfeeding, and increase the risk of postpartum depression.
The provision of support and companionship during labour may
to some extent buffer such stressors.
The second theoretical explanation does not focus on a particular
type of birth environment. Rather, it describes two pathways -
enhanced passage of the fetus through the pelvis and soft tissues,
as well as decreased stress response - by which labour support may
reduce the likelihood of operative birth and subsequent compli-
cations, and enhance women’s feelings of control and satisfaction
with their childbirth experiences (Hodnett 2002a). Enhanced fe-
topelvic relationships may be accomplished by encouraging mo-
bility and effective use of gravity, supporting women to assume
their preferred positions and recommending specific positions for
specific situations. Studies of the relationships among fear and anx-
iety, the stress response and pregnancy complications have shown
that anxiety during labour is associated with high levels of the stress
hormone epinephrine in the blood, which may in turn lead to ab-
normal fetal heart rate patterns in labour, decreased uterine con-
tractility, a longer active labour phase with regular well-established
contractions and low Apgar scores (Lederman 1978; Lederman
1981). Furthermore, individual interventions (e.g. labour induc-
tion, epidural anaesthesia, caesarean birth) and a cascade of in-
terventions throughout labour may disrupt hormonal physiology
and introduce risks to the woman or her baby, both in the short
and long term (Buckley 2015). Emotional support, information
and advice, comfort measures and advocacy may reduce anxiety
and fear and associated adverse effects during labour.

Continuous support for women during childbirth (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Continuous support has been viewed by some as a form of pain
relief, specifically, asanalternative toepidural analgesia(Dickinson
2002), because of concerns about the deleterious effects of epidural
analgesia, including on labour progress (Anim-Somuah 2011).
Many labour and birth interventions routinely involve, or increase
the likelihood of, co-interventions to monitor, prevent or treat
adverse effects, in a “cascade of interventions”. Continuous, one-
to-one support has the potential to limit this cascade and therefore,
to have a broad range of different effects, in comparison to usual
care. For example, if continuous support leads to reduced use of
epidural analgesia, it may in turn involve less use of electronic
fetal monitoring, intravenous drips, synthetic oxytocin, drugs to
combat hypotension, bladder catheterisation, vacuum extraction
or forceps, episiotomy and less morbidity associated with these,
and may increase mobility during labour and spontaneous birth
(Caton 2002; Anim-Somuah 2011) and impact the experience of
giving birth.
Why it is important to do this review
A systematic review examining factors associated with women’s
satisfaction with the childbirth experience suggests that continu-
ous support can make a substantial contribution to women’s satis-
faction. When women evaluate their experience, four factors pre-
dominate: the amount of support from caregivers, the quality of
relationships with caregivers, being involved with decision-mak-
ing and having high expectations or having experiences that ex-
ceed expectations (Hodnett 2002a).
Clarification of the effects of continuous support during labour,
overall and within specific circumstances, is important in light of
public and social policies and programs that encourage this type
of care. For example, the Congress in Uruguay passed a law in
2001 decreeing that all women have the right to companionship
during labour. In several low- and middle-income countries (in-
cluding China, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe), the Better
Births Initiative promotes labour companionship as a core element
of care for improving maternal and infant health (World Health
Organization 2016a). In many low-income countries, women are
not permitted to have anyone with them during labour and birth.
Efforts to change policies in these settings have led to questions
about the effectiveness of support from spouses/partners or other
support people of the woman’s own choosing, particularly in set-
tings where the cost of paid companions (e.g. doulas) would be
prohibitive.
In North America, and increasingly in many other areas of the
world, the services of women with special training in labour sup-
port have become available. Most commonly known as doula (a
Greek word for ’handmaiden’), this new member of the caregiver
team may also be called a labour companion, birth companion,
laboursupportspecialist,labourassistantorbirth assistant.A num-
ber of North American organisations offer doula training, certifi-
cation and professional support; according to one estimate more
than 50,000 people have received this training to date (P Simkin,
personal communication). Some North American hospitals have
begun to sponsor doula services. In a recent national survey of
childbearing women in the United States, 6% of respondents in-
dicated that they had used doula services during their most re-
cent labours (Declercq 2013). Many associations for doulas have
been established in high-income countries, including DONA In-
ternational, Doula UK, NCT Doula, British Doula, Childbirth
International, Australian Doulas, Australian Doula College and
Europoean Doula Network, among others. Doula services are
usually paid for out-of-pocket, and therefore affordable to afflu-
ent, higher-educated women only. However, a meta-analysis con-
ducted by Zhang 1996a showed that socially disadvantaged pop-
ulations, such as low-income women, could benefit more from
doula support. Maternal healthcare systems in dozens of high-
and low- to middle-income countries throughout the world are
developing new traditions for supportive female companionship
during labour (Pascali-Bonaro 2010).
Questions have arisen about the ability of employees (such as
nurses or midwives) to provide effective labour support, in the con-
text of modern institutional birth environments (Hodnett 1997).
For example, nurses and midwives often have simultaneous re-
sponsibility for more than one labouring woman, spend a large
proportion of time managing technology and keeping records, en-
sure adherence to institutional practices and protocols, and begin
or end work shifts in the middle of women’s labours. They may
work in short-staffed environments or lack labour support skills.
Companions chosen by a woman from her own network, such as
spouses/partners and female relatives, usually have little experience
in providing labour support and are often themselves in need of
support when with a loved one during labour and birth. As they
are frequently available to assume the role, often without extra cost
to families or health systems, it is important to understand their
effectiveness as providers of continuous labour support.
In addition to questions about the impact of the type of provider
of labour support, there are other questions about the effectiveness
of support, including its impact under a variety of environmental
conditions, and whether its effects are mediated by when contin-
uous support begins (early versus active labour).
There are also questions about the relative impact of different
models of labour support; specifically, effects of support provided
only during the intrapartum period versus effects of an extended
model with support during the antenatal, intrapartum and post-
partum periods.
Childbearing women, policy-makers, payers of health services,
health professionals and facilities and those who provide labour
support all need evidence about the effects of continuous support,
overall and under specific conditions.

Continuous support for women during childbirth (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The primary objective was to assess the effects, on women and
their babies, of continuous, one-to-one intrapartum support com-
pared with usual care, in any setting. Secondary objectives were
to determine whether the effects of continuous support are influ-
enced by the following:
1. Routine practices and policies in the birth environment
that may affect a woman’s autonomy, freedom of movement and
ability to cope with labour, including:
i) policies about the presence of support people of the
woman’s own choosing;
ii) epidural analgesia; and
iii) continuous electronic fetal monitoring.
2. The provider’s relationship to the woman and to the facility:
i) staff member of the facility (and thus may have
additional loyalties or responsibilities);
ii) not a staff member and not part of the woman’s social
network (present solely for the purpose of providing continuous
support, e.g. a doula); or
iii) a person chosen by the woman from family members
and friends.
3. Timing of onset (early or later in labour).
4. Model of support (support provided only around the time
of childbirth or extended to include support during the antenatal
and postpartum periods).
5. Country income level (high-income compared to low- and
middle-income)

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster-RCTs,
comparing continuous labour support by either a familiar or un-
familiar person (with or without healthcare professional qualifica-
tions) with usual care, in which there was random allocation to
treatment and control groups, were considered for inclusion in the
review. RCTs published in abstract form only were not eligible for
inclusion (unless additional information could be obtained from
the authors). Quasi-RCTs and RCTs using a cross-over design were
not eligible for inclusion in the review.
Types of participants
Pregnant women, in labour.
Types of interventions
We evaluated continuous presence and support during labour and
birth. The person providing the support could have qualifications
as a healthcare professional (nurse, midwife) or training as a doula
or childbirth educator, or be a family member, a spouse/partner,
a friend or a stranger with some or no special training in labour
support. The control group received usual care, as defined by the
trialists. In all cases, ’usual care’ did not involve continuous in-
trapartum support, but it could involve other measures, such as
routine epidural analgesia, to help women to cope with labour.
Types of outcome measures
Theoretically, continuous support can have many diverse physio-
logical and psychosocial effects (both short- and long-term), and
therefore, a larger than usual number of outcomes were consid-
ered.
Primary outcomes
Woman
1. Spontaneous vaginal birth.
2. Negative rating of/negative feelings about the birth
experience, as defined by trial authors.
3. Postpartum depression (defined using a pre-specified cutoff
score on a validated instrument).
Baby
1. Admission to special care nursery.
2. Exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point, as defined
by trial authors.
Secondary outcomes
Woman
1. Any analgesia/anaesthesia (pain medication).
2. Regional analgesia/anaesthesia.
3. Synthetic oxytocin during labour.
4. Labour length.
5. Severe labour pain (postpartum report).
6. Caesarean birth.
7. Instrumental vaginal birth.
8. Perineal trauma (defined as episiotomy or laceration
requiring suturing).
9. Delayed skin-to-skin contact (defined as immediately
following birth), not pre-specified.

Search methods for identification of studies
The following methods section of this review is based on a standard
template used by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth.
Electronic searches
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Tri-
als Register by contacting their Information Specialist (31 Octo-
ber 2016).
The Register is a database containing over 23,000 reports of con-
trolledtrialsinthe fieldof pregnancyandchildbirth.Forfull search
methods used to populate Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Regis-
ter including the detailed search strategies for CENTRAL, MED-
LINE, Embase and CINAHL; the list of handsearched journals
and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via
the current awareness service, please follow this link to the edi-
torial information about the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth
in the Cochrane Library and select the ‘Specialized Register ’ sec-
tion from the options on the left side of the screen.
Briefly, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register is
maintained by their Information Specialist and contains trials
identified from:
1. monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);
2. weekly searches of MEDLINE (Ovid);
3. weekly searches of Embase (Ovid);
4. monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO);
5. handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major
conferences; and
6. weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals
plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.
Search results are screened by two people and the full text of
all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activi-
ties described above is reviewed. Based on the intervention de-
scribed, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds
to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics),
and is then added to the Register. The Information Specialist
searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather
than keywords. This results in a more specific search set that has
been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (Included
studies; Excluded studies; Studies awaiting classification; Ongoing
studies).
In addition, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO Interna-
tional Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP) (1 June 2017) for
unpublished, planned and ongoing trial reports using the search
terms detailed in Appendix 1
Searching other resources
We searched the reference lists of retrieved studies.
We did not apply any language or date restrictions.
Data collection and analysis
For methods used in the previous version of this review, see
Hodnett 2013. For this update, the following methods were used
for assessing the 27 reports that were identified as a result of the
updated search. The following methods section of this review is
based on a standard template used by Cochrane Pregnancy and
Childbirth.
Selection of studies
Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the
potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We
resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we
consulted another review author.
Data extraction and management
We adapted the recommended Cochrane Pregnancy and Child-
birth data extraction form for this review. For eligible studies, two
review authors independently extracted the data using the agreed
form. We resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if required,
we consulted another review author. Data were entered into Re-
view Manager software (RevMan 2014) and checked for accuracy.
When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we
contacted authors of the original reports to provide further details.

 Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each
study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Sys-
tematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). Any disagreement
was resolved by discussion or by involving a third review author.
(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible
selection bias)
We described for each included study the method used to generate
the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment
of whether it should produce comparable groups.
We assessed the method as:
• low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random
number table; computer random number generator);
• high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even
date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or
• unclear risk of bias.
(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection
bias)
We described for each included study the method used to con-
ceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed
whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in ad-
vance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.
We assessed the methods as:
• low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation;
consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);
• high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-
opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or
• unclear risk of bias.
(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for
possible performance bias)
We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to
blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which
intervention a participant received. We considered that studies
were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that
the lack of blinding unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding
separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.
We assessed the methods as:
• low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants; and
• low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.
(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible
detection bias)
We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to
blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a
participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different
outcomes or classes of outcomes.
We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as:
• low, high or unclear risk of bias.
(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition
bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete
outcome data)
We described for each included study, and for each outcome or
class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and
exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and ex-
clusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at
each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), rea-
sons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether miss-
ing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.
Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied
by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the
analyses which we undertook.
We assessed methods as:
• low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing
outcome data balanced across groups);
• high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data
imbalanced across groups; ‘as treated’ analysis done with
substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned
at randomisation); or
• unclear risk of bias.
(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)
We described for each included study how we investigated the
possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.
We assessed the methods as:
• low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study’s pre-
specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the
review have been reported);
• high risk of bias (where not all the study’s pre-specified
outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary
outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are
reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to
include results of a key outcome that would have been expected
to have been reported); or
• unclear risk of bias.
(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not
covered by (1) to (5) above)
We described for each included study any important concerns we
had about other possible sources of bias.
(7) Overall risk of bias
We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high
risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook (
Higgins 2011). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to
assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether
12

 we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. In future
updates, we will explore the impact of the level of bias through
undertaking sensitivity analyses - see Sensitivity analysis.
Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the
GRADE approach
For this update, the quality of the evidence was assessed using
the GRADE approach as outlined in the GRADE handbook to
assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following
outcomes for the main comparison (comparison 1: continuous
support versus usual care - all trials).
1. Spontaneous vaginal birth.
2. Caesarean birth.
3. Negative rating of/negative feelings about the birth
experience, as defined by trial authors.
4. Postpartum depression, (defined using a pre-specified cutoff
score on a validated instrument).
5. Admission to special care nursery.
6. Exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point, as defined
by trial authors.
7. Labour length.
GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool was used to import data
from Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 2014) to create ’Summary of
findings’ tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a mea-
sure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced us-
ing the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five con-
siderations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision,
indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body
of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded
from ’high quality’ by one level for serious (or by two levelsfor very
serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, in-
directness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect
estimates or potential publication bias.
Measures of treatment effect
Dichotomous data
For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratio
with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Continuous data
We used the mean difference if outcomes were measured in the
same way between trials. If trials measured the same outcome but
useddifferentmethods, we wouldhave usedthe standardisedmean
difference.
Unit of analysis issues
Cluster-randomised trials
Had we found cluster-randomised trials, we would have included
them in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials.
Our plan was: we would adjust their sample sizes or standard er-
rors using the methods described in the Handbook (Section 16.3.4
or 16.3.6 as appropriate) (Higgins 2011) using an estimate of the
intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if
possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar popula-
tion. If we had used ICCs from other sources, we planned to report
this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of
variation in the ICC. In future updates of this review, if we identify
both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials,
we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider
it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little het-
erogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between
the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is
considered to be unlikely.
We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit
and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of the
randomisation unit.
Dealing with missing data
We noted levels of attrition for included studies. In future updates,
if more eligible studies are included, we will explore the impact
of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall
assessment of treatment effect using sensitivity analysis.
For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an
intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all partici-
pants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator
for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus
any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using
the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as sub-
stantial if I² was greater than 30% and either Tau² was greater
than zero, or there was a low P value (< 0.10) in the Chi² test for
heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (> 30%),
we planned to explore it by pre-specified subgroup analysis.
Assessment of reporting biases
Where there were 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we in-
vestigated reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel
plots. We assessed funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry
was suggested by a visual assessment, we planned to perform ex-
ploratory analyses to investigate the source.
Data synthesis
We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager soft-
ware (RevMan 2014). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for com-
bining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were
13

 estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials
were examining the same intervention, and the trials’ populations
and methods were judged to be sufficiently similar.
If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the un-
derlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substan-
tial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects
meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treat-
ment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The
random-effects summary is treated as the average range of possible
treatment effects and we discuss the clinical implications of treat-
ment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment ef-
fect is not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. When
we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the
average treatment effect with 95% CIs, and the estimates of Tau²
and I².
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Where we identified substantial heterogeneity, we investigated the
source using subgroup analyses. We considered whether an overall
summary was meaningful, and if it was, we used random-effects
analysis to produce the effect. We added two new subgroup anal-
yses on the model of support received (D) and country income
level where trials were conducted (E).
We planned the following subgroup analyses.
(A) Three subgroup analyses that concern characteristics of
the childbirth environment
• Trials in settings in which women were permitted to be
accompanied by one or more support persons of their own
choosing compared with trials in which accompaniment was not
permitted.
• Trials conducted in settings in which epidural analgesia was
available compared with trials in settings in which it was
unavailable.
• Trials in which there was a policy of routine electronic fetal
heart rate monitoring compared with trials in settings in which
continuous electronic fetal monitoring was not routine.
(B) One subgroup analysis that concerns characteristics of
the providers of labour support
• Trials in which the caregivers were employees of the
institution, compared with trials in which the caregivers were not
employees and were not members of the woman’s social network,
compared with trials in which the providers were not employees
and were lay people chosen by the participants (e.g. spouse/
partner, friend, close relative).
(C) One subgroup analysis that concerns differences in the
timing of onset of continuous support
• Trials in which continuous labour support began prior to or
during early labour (as defined by trial authors), compared with
trials in which continuous support began in active labour.
(D) One subgroup analysis that concerns the model of
support received
• Trials in which support was provided solely during the
intrapartum period, compared with trials in which extended
support was provided during the antenatal and postpartum
periods, in addition to continuously during the intrapartum
period.
(E) One subgroup analysis that concerns the country income
level
• Trials conducted in high-income settings, compared with
trials conducted in low- or middle-income settings.
The following outcomes were used in subgroup analyses:
• spontaneous vaginal birth;
• negative ratings of the birth experience;
• postpartum depression;
• admission to special care nursery;
• exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point, as defined
by trial authors;
• any analgesia/anaesthesia;
• synthetic oxytocin during labour; and
• caesarean birth.
The five primary outcomes and three common labour interven-
tion outcomes were used in the subgroup analyses. While normally
subgroup analyses are restricted to primary outcomes, we also in-
cluded the outcome of caesarean birth, because there is widespread
concern about escalating caesarean rates worldwide, and subgroup
analyses could be helpful to policy makers in decisions about the
provision of continuous labour support.
We assessed subgroup differences by interaction tests available in
RevMan (RevMan 2014). We reported the results of subgroup
analyses quoting the Chi² statistic and P value, and the interaction
test I² value.
Because few of the trial reports contained all of the information
needed for the above subgroup analyses, we contacted the trial
authors in an attempt to verify the presence/absence of routine
electronic fetal monitoring (EFM), hospital policy regarding the
presence of a support person, the presence/absence of epidural
analgesia and timing of onset of continuous support. We excluded
some studies included in the primary comparisons from the sub-
group analyses concerning the use of EFM, presence/absence of
epidural analgesia, hospital policy regarding the presence of a sup-
port person, because their status was unknown. For tests of differ-
ences between these subgroups, we recalculated the overall analysis
by including only the studies in which these characteristics were
known.

 We were unable to carry out subgroup analysis for subgroup (C)
timing of onset of continuous support because we could not suf-
ficiently categorise trials according to this subgroup, and in sub-
group (D) there were only data for one outcome.
Sensitivity analysis
We performed sensitivity analyses, for the primary outcomes, in
instances where there was a high risk of bias associated with se-
lection bias (allocation concealment). We also performed sensi-
tivity analyses for any outcomes where reciprocal data had to be
calculated to include data in an analysis (exclusive breastfeeding;
negative rating of/negative feelings about the birth experience).

Bello 2009). We excluded six studies because: the interven-
tion was not continuous support during labour (Dong 2009;
ISRCTN33728802; Orbach-Zinger 2012; U1111-1175-8408;
Wan 2011); and participants were not randomly assigned to study
groups (Senanayake 2013). Twelve studies are awaiting transla-
tion and classification (Aghdam 2015; Bakhshi 2015; Farahani
2005; Huang 2003; IRCT2013111710297N3; McGrath 1999;
NCT00664118; Pinheiro 1996; Rahimiyan 2015; Samieizadeh
2011; Sangestani 2013; Shahshahan 2014). Of these studies,
five are awaiting translation (Aghdam 2015; Bakhshi 2015;
Farahani 2005; Samieizadeh 2011; Sangestani 2013), we are
awaiting further information from authors for six (Huang
2003; IRCT2013111710297N3; McGrath 1999; Pinheiro 1996;
Rahimiyan 2015; Shahshahan 2014), and were unable to lo-
cate contact details for the authors of NCT00664118. Four
trials are ongoing (IRCT2015083123837N1; NCT01216098;
NCT01947244; NCT02550730).

 Characteristics of included studies tables. Of these, 26 studies in-
volving 15,858 women contributed data to the analyses for pri-
mary and secondary outcomes; one included study (Thomassen
2003) met our inclusion criteria but did not report data on any
of our pre-specified outcomes. Thomassen 2003 is not described
in this section, but details are provided in the Characteristics of
included studies tables.
Methods
We included 27 randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
Settings
All 26 trials (n = 15,858) that provided usable outcome data
were conducted in hospital settings. The 26 trials were conducted
in 17 countries: Australia (Dickinson 2002), Belgium (Bréart
- Belgium 1992), Botswana (Madi 1999), Brazil (Bruggemann
2007), Canada (3 studies: Gagnon 1997; Hodnett 1989; Hodnett
2002), Chile (Torres 1999), Finland (2 studies: Hemminki
1990a; Hemminki 1990b), France (Bréart - France 1992), Greece
(Bréart - Greece 1992), Guatemala (Klaus 1986), Iran (3 stud-
ies: Akbarzadeh 2014; Kashanian 2010; Safarzadeh 2012), Mex-
ico (Langer 1998), Nigeria (Morhason-Bello 2009), South Africa
(Hofmeyr 1991), Thailand (Yuenyong 2012), Turkey (Isbir 2015)
and USA (6 studies: Campbell 2006; Cogan 1988; Hans 2013;
Hodnett 2002; Kennell 1991; McGrath 2008). The trials were
conducted under widely disparate hospital conditions, regulations
and routines.
Based on World Bank Development Indicators (World Bank
2017), at the time of study publication: 13 trials were conducted
in high-income settings (Bréart - Belgium 1992; Bréart - France
1992; Campbell 2006; Cogan 1988; Dickinson 2002; Gagnon
1997; Hans 2013; Hemminki 1990a; Hemminki 1990b; Hodnett
1989; Hodnett 2002; Kennell 1991; McGrath 2008), 13 trials
were conducted in middle-income settings (Akbarzadeh 2014;
Bréart - Greece 1992; Bruggemann 2007; Hofmeyr 1991; Isbir
2015; Kashanian 2010; Klaus 1986; Langer 1998; Madi 1999;
Morhason-Bello 2009; Safarzadeh 2012; Torres 1999; Yuenyong
2012), and no studies were conducted in low-income settings.
Chile (Torres 1999) and Greece (Bréart - Greece 1992) are classi-
fied as high-income settings in 2017; however, they were classified
as middle-income settings at the time of the study publications and
were treated as middle-income settings in this analysis. Two stud-
ies were conducted in lower-middle income countries (Guatemala
(Klaus 1986), and Nigeria (Morhason-Bello 2009)).
There was remarkable consistency in the descriptions of contin-
uous support across all trials. In most instances the intervention
included continuous or nearly continuous presence, at least dur-
ing active labour. One trial (Hans 2013) was a community doula
intervention throughout pregnancy, labour, childbirth and three
months postpartum, including continuous support during child-
birth. Twenty-four of the 26 trials that provided usable outcome
data (all except Cogan 1988 and Dickinson 2002) also included
specific mention of comforting touch and words of praise and en-
couragement.
Seventeen trials reported funding sources. The majority of these
trials were funded by government or charitable grants. One study
(Campbell 2006) reported to have received a “small stipend” from
Johnson and Johnson to complete data analysis, though authors
reported that; “Johnson & Johnson did not influence the design
and conduct of the study or the analysis and interpretation of
the data”. The remaining nine trials (Bréart - Belgium 1992;
Bréart - France 1992; Bréart - Greece 1992; Cogan 1988; Isbir
2015; Kashanian 2010; Safarzadeh 2012; Thomassen 2003;Torres
1999) did not clearly report funding sources. Five trials declared no
conflicts of interest (Akbarzadeh 2014; Bruggemann 2007; Isbir
2015; Kashanian 2010; Yuenyong 2012); this was not reported in
the remaining trials.
Participants
In 20 trials, pregnant women were recruited around the time of
admission to the hospital for childbirth or during the active stage
of labour; whereas in six trials, women were recruited during an-
tenatal visits, ranging from 12 to 38 weeks (Campbell 2006; Hans
2013; Hodnett 1989; McGrath 2008; Morhason-Bello 2009;
Torres 1999).
Interventions and comparisons
The interventions included continuous presence and support for
women during childbirth by a member of hospital staff, a woman
in a doula role, or a trained or untrained member of the woman’s
social network (e.g. spouse or partner, family member, or friend).
In 11 trials (Bréart - Belgium 1992; Bréart - France 1992;
Campbell 2006; Cogan 1988; Dickinson 2002; Gagnon 1997;
Hemminki 1990a; Hemminki 1990b; Hodnett 1989; Hodnett
2002; McGrath 2008), hospital policy permitted women to be
accompanied by their spouses/partners or other family mem-
bers during labour, while in the other 15 trials, no additional
support people were allowed, or it was unclear if other support
people were allowed. Epidural analgesia was not routinely avail-
able in eight trials (Bréart - Greece 1992; Hofmeyr 1991; Isbir
2015; Kashanian 2010; Klaus 1986; Madi 1999; Morhason-Bello
2009; Yuenyong 2012). We were unsuccessful in obtaining infor-
mation about the availability of epidural analgesia in four trials
(Akbarzadeh 2014; Cogan 1988, Hans 2013; Safarzadeh 2012).
Epidural analgesia was routinely available in the other 14 trials.
Electronic fetal heart rate monitoring was not routine in nine trials
(Bruggemann 2007; Hofmeyr 1991; Isbir 2015; Kashanian 2010;
Klaus 1986; Langer 1998; Madi 1999; Morhason-Bello 2009;
Yuenyong 2012). In nine trials (Campbell 2006; Dickinson 2002;
Gagnon 1997; Hemminki 1990a; Hemminki 1990b; Hodnett
1989; Hodnett 2002; Kennell 1991; McGrath 2008) electronic
17

 fetal monitoring (EFM) was used routinely. We were unsuccess-
ful in obtaining information about the use of EFM in eight trials
(Akbarzadeh 2014; Bréart - Greece 1992; Bréart - Belgium 1992;
Bréart - France 1992; Cogan 1988; Hans 2013; Safarzadeh 2012;
Torres 1999).
It was not possible to categorise most of the trials according to
the pre-specified subgroups of early versus active labour. In four
trials (Cogan 1988; Hodnett 1989; Klaus 1986; Madi 1999), the
support began in early labour. In the other 22 trials, the timing of
onset of support was much more heterogenous, as were definitions
of early and active labour, in instances in which these were defined.
Women were in varying phases of labour, from elective induction
to active labour.
In addition, the people providing the support intervention varied
in their experience, qualifications and relationship to the labouring
women. In nine trials (Bréart - Belgium 1992; Bréart - France
1992; Bréart - Greece 1992; Dickinson 2002; Gagnon 1997;
Hemminki 1990a; Hemminki 1990b; Hodnett 2002; Kashanian
2010), the support was provided by a member of the hospital
staff, for example, a midwife, student midwife or nurse. In 10
trials the providers were not members of the hospital staff and
were not part of the woman’s social network; they were women
with or without special training, such as doulas or women who
had given birth before (Akbarzadeh 2014; Hans 2013; Hodnett
1989; Hofmeyr 1991; Isbir 2015; Kennell 1991; Klaus 1986;
McGrath 2008); a childbirth educator (Cogan 1988), or retired
nurses (Langer 1998). In seven trials they were companions of the
woman’s choice from her social network, with or without brief
training - a female relative or friend or the woman’s spouse/partner
(Bruggemann 2007; Campbell2006; Madi 1999; Morhason-Bello
2009; Safarzadeh 2012; Torres 1999; Yuenyong 2012).
The comparisons were usual care in the same setting. Usual care
did not involve continuous support during childbirth, but in some
cases included other coping measures, such as routine epidural
analgesia.
Excluded studies
We excluded a total of 19 trials (Bender 1968; Bochain 2000;
Brown 2007; Dalal 2006; Dong 2009; Gordon 1999; Hemminki
1990c; Lindow 1998; Manning-Orenstein 1998; Orbach-Zinger
2012; Ran 2005; Riley 2012; Scott 1999; Senanayake 2013; Sosa
1980; Trueba 2000; Tryon 1966; Wan 2011; Zhang 1996b).
Eight trials were excluded as they were not randomised trials
(Bender 1968; Dalal 2006; Ran 2005; Scott 1999; Senanayake
2013; Sosa 1980; Trueba 2000; Tryon 1966). Eight trials were
excluded because the intervention was not continuous support
during childbirth (Bochain 2000; Brown 2007; Dong 2009;
Lindow 1998; Manning-Orenstein 1998; Orbach-Zinger 2012;
Wan 2011; Zhang 1996b). One trial reported as an abstract pro-
vided insufficient information to assess eligibility (Riley 2012).
Two further trials were excluded because they did not provide any
usable data, due to post-randomisation exclusions (Gordon 1999)
and data not separated by treatment group (Hemminki 1990c).

Allocation
Random sequence generation: 13 trials were at unclear risk of
bias (Bréart - Belgium 1992; Bréart - France 1992; Bréart -
Greece 1992; Cogan 1988; Dickinson 2002; Hemminki 1990a;
Hemminki 1990b; Kennell 1991; Klaus 1986; Madi 1999;
McGrath 2008; Safarzadeh 2012; Thomassen 2003) because they
did not describe the method of random assignment. Fourteen tri-
als described using a computer random number generator or re-
ferred to a random number table (Akbarzadeh 2014; Bruggemann
2007; Campbell 2006; Gagnon 1997; Hans 2013; Hodnett 1989;
Hodnett 2002; Hofmeyr 1991; Isbir 2015; Kashanian 2010;
Langer 1998; Morhason-Bello 2009; Torres 1999; Yuenyong
2012) and were assessed as low risk of bias.
Allocation concealment: the risk of selection bias was high in two
small trials (Bruggemann 2007; Kashanian 2010). In Bruggemann
2007, women picked their treatment allocation from an opaque
container; Kashanian 2010 used block randomisation under
which allocation could have been easily predicted. In 12 tri-
als (Campbell 2006; Gagnon 1997; Hans 2013; Hodnett 1989;
Hodnett 2002; Kennell 1991; Klaus 1986; Madi 1999; McGrath
2008; Morhason-Bello 2009; Torres 1999; Yuenyong 2012), risk
of selection bias was low with allocation described as either us-
ing central allocation, e.g. Hodnett 2002 used a central, comput-
erised randomisation service accessed by telephone or other trials
described using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.
In the remaining trials (Akbarzadeh 2014; Bréart - Belgium
1992; Bréart - France 1992; Bréart - Greece 1992; Cogan 1988;
Dickinson 2002; Hemminki 1990a; Hemminki 1990b; Hofmeyr
1991; Isbir 2015; Langer 1998; Safarzadeh 2012; Thomassen
2003), risk of selection bias was unclear, e.g. one trial used methods
that were centrally controlled but not concealed (Cogan 1988).
Blinding
Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias): neither
those providing nor receiving care could be blinded to the pres-
ence/absence of a person providing continuous support. Hodnett
2002 provided evidence to discount contamination and co-inter-
vention as serious threats to validity. All trials therefore were as-
sessed as having high risk of bias for blinding of participants and
personnel.
Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias): In eight tri-
als group assignment was known and no attempt to blind out-
come assessment was apparent. These trials were assessed as be-
ing at high risk of bias (Akbarzadeh 2014, Bruggemann 2007;
Campbell 2006; Hans 2013; Hemminki 1990a; Hofmeyr 1991;
Madi 1999; Morhason-Bello 2009). One trial was assessed as be-
ing at low risk of bias because some blinding of outcome as-
sessment was performed (Isbir 2015). In the remaining 18 tri-
als, risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessment was unclear,
often because it was not reported who assessed outcomes and
whether or not they were blinded (Bréart - Belgium 1992; Bréart

 - France 1992; Bréart - Greece 1992; Cogan 1988; Dickinson
2002; Gagnon 1997; Hemminki 1990b; Hodnett 1989; Hodnett
2002; Kashanian 2010; Kennell 1991; Klaus 1986; Langer 1998;
McGrath 2008; Safarzadeh 2012; Thomassen 2003; Torres 1999;
Yuenyong 2012).
Incomplete outcome data
Attrition bias: we did not include data for outcomes assessed in
hospital in a comparison if there was more than 20% loss to follow-
up; we did not include longer-term outcome data if there was
more than 25% loss to follow-up. Based on these criteria, one
trial (Thomassen 2003) provided no usable outcome data. Three
further trials were assessed as being at high risk of bias for attrition
bias (Campbell 2006; Cogan 1988, Isbir 2015). Isbir 2015 had
a total of nine post-randomisation exclusions, due to emergency
caesarean sections. One trial (Safarzadeh 2012) had unclear risk
of attrition bias.
Selective reporting
All outcomes appear to have been reported on in most trials. In two
trials, it was unclear whether selective reporting had taken place
(Cogan 1988; Thomassen 2003). In Cogan 1988 the outcomes
had not been specified a priori. In Thomassen 2003 the sample
size was based on caesarean section rate, but it is unclear why only
emergency caesarean section was reported. One trial (Isbir 2015)
had high risk of reporting bias, because women who underwent
emergency caesarean section were excluded from the analysis of
other outcomes, and caesarean section is a frequently reported
outcome for continuous support during childbirth.
Other potential sources of bias
Three trials were assessed as being at high risk of other bias: in
two trials the women had been told the purpose of the study
differentially (Hemminki 1990a; Hemminki 1990b) and one trial
was stopped early for “a range of largely organizational issues”
when only a quarter of the original sample size had been enrolled (
Thomassen 2003). Riskof biaswasunclearinone study(Campbell
2006) and no other sources of bias were apparent in the remaining
trials.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Continuous
support compared to usual care (all trials) for women during
childbirth
Main comparison: continuous support versus usual
care - all trials
We considered 23 outcomes. Between one and 24 trials con-
tributed to the analysis of each outcome. Sensitivity analyses, con-
ducted by removing the trials (all of which were small) with a high
likelihood of selection bias (Bruggemann 2007; Kashanian 2010)
did not alter the conclusions. According to our pre-specified cri-
teria, there was statistical heterogeneity in all but three outcomes
(instrumental vaginal birth, low five-minute Apgar score, and low
postpartum self-esteem). Inspection of the forest plots did not
suggest sources of heterogeneity. For the three outcomes postpar-
tum depression, delayed initiation of breastfeeding and difficulty
mothering, this statistical heterogeneity confirmed our conclusion
that based on clinical heterogeneity a summary statistic would not
yield meaningful results (discussed further below). We report the
results of fixed-effect analyses for instrumental vaginal birth, low
five-minute Apgar score, and low postpartum self-esteem (the lat-
ter only contained one trial), and random-effects analyses for all
other outcomes in which summary statistics were computed.
Primary outcomes
Women who had continuous, one-to-one support during labour
were:
more likely to have
• a spontaneous vaginal birth (21 trials, 14,369 women,
average risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04
to 1.12, I² = 61%, Tau² = 0.00, low-quality evidence), Analysis
1.1;
◦ We included 21 studies that reported spontaneous
vaginal birth that we assessed for small-study effect (publication
bias). For spontaneous vaginal birth, we observed that most
studies clustered around the effect estimate without any obvious
asymmetry, indicating a low risk of publication bias (Figure 4).

• reported negative rating of or negative feelings about
childbirth experience (11 trials, 11,133 women, average RR
0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.79, I² = 63%, Tau² = 0.03, low-quality
evidence), Analysis 1.2;
◦ we included 11 studies that reported negative rating of
or negative feelings about birth experience that we assessed for
small-study effect (publication bias). For negative rating of or
negative feelings about birth experience, we observed that most
studies clustered around the effect estimate without any obvious
asymmetry, indicating a low risk of publication bias (Figure 5).
Two trials reported negative ratings or negative feelings about
childbirth experience as satisfaction with care received
(Bruggemann 2007) and overall rating of birth experience
(Campbell 2006). We acknowledge that this is not ideal, and so
carried out a sensitivity analysis to account for this. We removed
Bruggemann 2007 and Campbell 2006 from the overall analysis
to see if this made any difference to the result. The overall result
was unchanged (9 trials, 10,427 women, average RR 0.72, 95%
CI 0.61 to 0.84, I² = 62%,Tau² = 0.03).

Negative rating of/negative feelings about birth experience
and there was no apparent impact of continuous sup-
port on
• admission to the special care nursery (7 trials; 8897 infants,
average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.25, I² 37%, Tau² = 0.03,
low-quality evidence), Analysis 1.4; and
• exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point, as defined
by trial authors (4 trials, 5584 women, average RR 1.05, 95% CI
0.96 to 1.16, I² = 66%, Tau² = 0.01, low-quality evidence),
Analysis 1.5;
◦ trials reported exclusive or any breastfeeding at any
time point as: self-reported breastfeeding duration at one month
postpartum (Langer 1998), at six weeks postpartum (Hofmeyr
1991), and at four months postpartum (Hans 2013). Hodnett
2002 reported “not breastfeeding at all” at six weeks postpartum
and we calculated the reciprocal for this outcome for this analysis
(Analysis 1.5). We acknowledge that this is not ideal, and so
carried out a sensitivity analysis to account for this. We removed
Hodnett 2002 from the overall analysis to see if this made any
difference to the result. The overall result was unchanged (3
trials, 1025 women, average RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27, I² =
48%,Tau² = 0.01).
Evidence of postpartum depression was a reported out-
come in just two trials (Hodnett 2002; Hofmeyr 1991). Hodnett
2002 used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Inventory and re-
ported the frequencies of scores greater than 12. Hofmeyr 1991
used the Pitt Depression Inventory and reported scores indicating
mild (< 20), moderate (20 to 34), and severe (> 34) depressive
symptomatology. We combined the frequencies of moderate and
severe depressive symptomatology, since Pitt scores greater than 19
have been considered indicative of postpartum depression (Avan
2010). The two trials were widely disparate in populations, the
hospital conditions within which they were conducted, and the
type of support provider (Hodnett 2002 conducted in 13 tertiary
and community hospitals in the USA and Canada, and Hofmeyr
1991 conducted in one community hospital in South Africa). We
concluded that combining the studies would not yield meaningful
information. In both trials the direction of effect was the same. In
Hofmeyr 1991, eight out of 74 women (10.8%) in the group re-
ceiving continuous support had depressive symptomatology com-
pared to 44 out of 75 women (58.6%) in the control group (RR
0.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.36). In Hodnett 2002, 245 out of 2816
(8.7%) in the supported group had depressive symptomatology,
compared to 277 out of 2751 (10.0%) in the control group (RR

Secondary outcomes
Women who had continuous, one-to-one support during labour
were:
more likely to have
• shorter labours (13 trials, 5429 women, mean difference
(MD) -0.69 hours, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.34, I² = 66%, Tau² =
0.20, low-quality evidence), Analysis 1.9;
◦ we included 13 studies that reported duration of
labour that we assessed for small-study effect (publication bias).
For duration of labour, we observed that most studies clustered
around the effect estimate, without any obvious asymmetry,
indicating a low risk of publication bias (Figure 6).

Labour length
• shorter time from birth to initiation of breastfeeding (1
trial, 585 women, MD -44.60 minutes, 95% CI -47.63 to -
41.57), Analysis 1.16;
and less likely to have
• any intrapartum analgesia or anaesthesia (15 trials, 12,433
women, average RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.96, I² = 73%, Tau²

◦ we included 15 studies that reported use of any
analgesia or anaesthesia that we assessed for small-study effect
(publication bias). For use of any analgesia or anaesthesia, we
observed that most studies fell at the top around the effect
estimate without any obvious asymmetry, suggesting a low risk of
publication bias (Figure 7).

because the forest plot suggests that the apparent small effect was
caused by a large effect in one study.

reported);

◦ Hofmeyr 1991 reported self-esteem scores at day 1, 6
weeks, and 1 year postpartum using the Coopersmith self-esteem
inventory (using mean and either standard deviation or standard
error). Hofmeyr 1991 reported no clear difference in mean self-
esteem scores between the support and control groups at day 1 or
1 year postpartum. However, mean self-esteem scores were
higher in the support group at six weeks postpartum, compared
to the control group (mean 74.5, SE 2.0 versus mean 58.8, SE
2.8, P = 0.0001). A score above 46 is indicative of high self-
esteem (Ryden 1978).

Reported outcomes that were based on few trials, a small
number of women, or both, should be interpreted with caution.
These outcomesare: unsatisfactorymother-infantinteractions,de-
layed initiation of breastfeeding, low postpartum self-esteem, de-
layed skin-to-skin contact, and restricted mobility during labour.
Two trials reported results related to delayed initiation
of breastfeeding (Campbell 2006; Morhason-Bello 2009). As was
the case with postpartum depression and difficulty in mothering,
the trials were widely disparate in populations, hospital conditions
where they were conducted, the type of support provider. Inspec-
tion of the forest plot supported our conclusion that combining
the trials would not yield meaningful information. Delayed initi-
ation of breastfeeding was reduced in both studies that reported
this outcome, but data were not aggregated due to extreme het-

 erogeneity. Campbell 2006 reported the number of mothers who
started breastfeeding within the first hour, which we recalculated
to the reciprocal, and calculated to 112 out of 229 (48.9%) in the
continuous support group reported delayed initiation of breast-
feeding, compared to 172 out of 265 (64.9%) in the control group
(RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64, 0.88; Analysis 1.15). In Morhason-Bello
2009, no women in the continuous support group (N = 94) re-
ported delayed initiation of breastfeeding, compared to 68 out of
115 (59.1%) in the control group (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00, 0.14).
No trials reported results related to women who were
unlikely to recommend birth in that institution.
Subgroup comparisons
We present the results of the subgroup analyses below. Although
we made every effort to obtain required information from trial
authors, none of the subgroup comparisons were based on the to-
tal number of included trials for which usable data were available.
Thus, results must be interpreted with caution. We did not report
results for postpartum depression or exclusive or any breastfeed-
ing at any time point, because too few trials provided data. Only
two trials contributed data about postpartum depression (Hodnett
2002; Hofmeyr 1991) and four about exclusive or any breastfeed-
ing at any time point (Hans 2013; Hodnett 2002; Hofmeyr 1991;
Langer 1998).
We were unable to conduct the planned subgroup comparison
based on timing of onset of labour support. It was not possible
to categorise most of the trials according to the pre-specified sub-
groups of early versus active labour. In four trials (Cogan 1988;
Hodnett 1989; Klaus 1986; Madi 1999), the support began in
early labour. In the other 22 trials, both the definitions of early and
active labour and the timing of onset of support were much more
heterogenous, where they were defined. Women were in varying
phases of labour, from elective induction to active labour.
As noted in Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity,
totals in the subgroup analysis figures may differ slightly from
those in the main comparisons.
Subgroup A.1: Policies about the presence of companions
during labour and birth
1. Spontaneous vaginal birth: In nine trials (10,889 women)
companions were permitted (average RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to
1.06). In 10 trials (3329 women) companions were not
permitted (average RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.17). Chi² for the
subgroup comparison = 7.19, P = 0.007, Analysis 2.1. There was
a modest but clear difference between the subgroups. Although
the group in which companions were permitted was borderline,
both favoured support over usual care. Women who were not
able to have companions with them in labour benefited more
from having continuous support in labour than those who were
not permitted to have a companion.
2. Negative ratings of or negative views about the birth
experience: In five trials (8639 women) companions were
permitted (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.00). In six trials
(2539 women) companions were not permitted (average RR
0.63, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.74). Chi² for the subgroup comparison
= 1.74, P = 0.19, Analysis 2.2. There was no clear difference
between the subgroups, which both favoured support regardless
of whether or not a labour companion was permitted. It should
be noted that when the two trials that reported reciprocal data
were omitted from the analysis there was evidence of a subgroup
difference (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 6.53, P = 0.01.
3. Postpartum depression: too few trials contributed to this
outcome to produce a meaningful subgroup analysis, Analysis
2.3.
4. Admission to special care nursery: in two trials (7328
women), companions were permitted (average RR 0.99, 95% CI
0.82 to 1.20). In five trials (1569 women), companions were not
permitted (average RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.61). Chi² for the
subgroup comparison = 0.17, P = 0.68, Analysis 2.4. No clear
difference was observed between the subgroups. Labour
companions do not appear to affect the number of babies
admitted to special care nursery.
5. Exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point: too few
trials contributed to this outcome to produce a meaningful
subgroup analysis, Analysis 2.5.
6. Any intrapartum analgesia or anaesthesia: In seven trials
(9752 women) companions were permitted (average RR 0.97,
95% CI 0.96 to 0.99), and in seven trials (2598 women)
companions were not permitted (average RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61
to 1.00). Chi² for the subgroup comparison = 3.12, P = 0.08,
Analysis 2.6. There may be a small difference between subgroups
but we cannot be certain of this.
7. Synthetic oxytocin during labour: in five trials (9495
women) companions were permitted (average RR 0.99, 95% CI
0.90 to 1.10). In 10 trials (3125 women) companions were not
permitted (average RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.05). Chi² for the
subgroup comparison = 0.45, P = 0.50, Analysis 2.7. There was
no clear difference between these subgroups.
8. Caesarean birth: in 11 trials (11,326 women) companions
were permitted (average RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04). In 11
trials (3849 women) companions were not permitted (average
RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.88). Chi² for the subgroup
comparison = 3.73, P = 0.05, Analysis 2.8. A clear difference was
observed between the subgroups, although the confidence
intervals just cross. It appears that women not permitted to have
other support benefited most from having continuous support.
The effect was not clear for those women who were permitted to
have other companions present.
Subgroup A.2: Availability of epidural analgesia

Continuous support for women during childbirth (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 1. Spontaneous vaginal birth: In 13 trials (12,672 women),
epidural analgesia was routinely available (average RR 1.06, 95%
CI 1.02 to 1.10). In six trials (1546 women) epidural analgesia
was not routinely available (average RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04 to
1.19). Chi² for the subgroup comparison = 1.38, P = 0.24,
Analysis 3.1. There was no evidence of a difference between
subgroups.
2. Negative ratings of or negative views about the birth
experience: In nine trials (10,404 women) epidural analgesia was
routinely available (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.86). In
two trials (774 women) epidural analgesia was not routinely
available (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.63). Chi² for the subgroup
comparison = 7.10, P = 0.008, Analysis 3.2. Continuous support
produced more positive feelings about birth experience regardless
of epidural availability; however, the difference was clearly
greater in women unable to access epidural anaesthesia. The
subgroup difference was still apparent even when we omitted the
two trials where we had analysed the data as reciprocals
(Bruggemann 2007; Campbell 2006), test for subgroup
differences: Chi² = 15.32, P < 0.0001.
3. Postpartum depression: too few trials contributed to this
outcome to produce a meaningful subgroup analysis, Analysis
3.3.
4. Admission to special care nursery: In five trials (8380
women) epidural analgesia was routinely available (average RR
0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.13). In two trials (517 women) epidural
analgesia was not routinely available (average RR 0.26, 95% CI
0.08 to 0.88). Chi² for the subgroup comparison = 4.51, P =
0.03, Analysis 3.4. There was a modest subgroup difference for
this outcome. Babies of women who did not have access to
epidurals and had continuous support were less likely to be
admitted to the special care nursery. Similar numbers of babies
were admitted to special care in the continuous support and
usual care groups when the women had access to epidurals.
5. Exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point: too few
trials contributed to this outcome to produce a meaningful
subgroup analysis, Analysis 3.5.
6. Any intrapartum analgesia or anaesthesia: In nine trials
(10,888 women), epidural analgesia was routinely available
(average RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97). In five trials (1462
women) epidural analgesia was not routinely available (average
RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99). Chi² for the subgroup
comparison = 0.89, P = 0.35, Analysis 3.6. There was no clear
difference between the subgroups for this outcome.
7. Synthetic oxytocin during labour: in eight trials (10,568
women) epidural analgesia was routinely available; (average RR
0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.05). In eight trials (2129 women),
epidural analgesia was not routinely available; (average RR 0.80,
95% CI 0.62 to 1.03). Chi² for the subgroup comparison =
2.56, P = 0.11, Analysis 3.7. There was no clear difference
between the subgroups for this outcome.
8. Caesarean birth: in 14 trials (13,064 women), epidural
analgesia was routinely available (average RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81
to 1.02). In eight trials (2149 women), epidural analgesia was
not routinely available (average RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.72).
In two very small trials (34 women and 100 women), we were
unable to determine if epidural analgesia was routinely available
(average RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.09). Chi² for the subgroup
comparison = 12.03, P = 0.002, Analysis 3.8. Continuous
support did not make a clear difference on rates of caesarean
section compared with usual care in women who had epidurals
available to them. However, there was a clear difference between
this subgroup and women not able to have an epidural.
Continuous support had a greater effect in reducing the rate of
caesarean sections when women were not able to have epidurals.
Subgroup A.3: Routine use of electronic fetal monitoring
(EFM)
1. Spontaneous vaginal birth: In eight trials (9717 women)
EFM was routine (average RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13). In
seven trials (1913 women) EFM was not routine (average RR
1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.17). In six trials (2811 women), the
policy about routine EFM is not known (average RR 1.09, 95%
CI 1.00 to 1.18). Chi² for the subgroup comparison = 1.27, P =
0.53, Analysis 4.1. This subgroup analysis is difficult to interpret
but it appears that continuous support probably increases the
likelihood of women having a spontaneous vaginal birth
regardless of EFM. There was no evidence of a subgroup
difference. The effect was greater in women who did not have
EFM although the lower CI touches the upper CI of those who
had EFM. Where it was not clear whether women had EFM or
not, the CIs cross the line of no effect.
2. Negative ratings of or negative views about the birth
experience: four trials (7467 women) were conducted in settings
with routine EFM (average RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94).
Four trials (1710 women) were conducted in settings in which
EFM was not routine (average RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.74).
Three trials (1977 women) were conducted in settings in which
the use of routine EFM is not known (average RR 0.84, 95% CI
0.65 to 1.08). Chi² for the subgroup comparison = 4.02, P =
0.13, Analysis 4.2. The use of EFM made no clear difference to
the number of women with negative feelings about their birth
experience. It should be noted that there was also no subgroup
difference when we omitted the two trials where we had analysed
the data as reciprocals (Bruggemann 2007; Campbell 2006), test
for subgroup differences: Chi² = 4.01, P = 0.13.
3. Postpartum depression: too few trials contributed to this
outcome to produce a meaningful subgroup analysis, Analysis
4.3.
4. Admission to special care nursery: in three trials (7740
women) EFM was routine (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to
1.11). In three trials (729 women) EFM was not routine (average
RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.52). In one trial (428 women), it is

 not known whether EFM was routine (RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.76 to
5.18). Chi² for the subgroup comparison = 4.76, P = 0.09,
Analysis 4.4. The use of EFM made no clear difference to the
number of women who had babies admitted to special care.
5. Exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point: too few
trials contributed to this outcome to produce a meaningful
subgroup analysis, Analysis 4.5.
6. Any intrapartum analgesia or anaesthesia: in six trials (8580
women), EFM was routine (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to
0.99). In six trials (2186 women), EFM was not routine (average
RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04). In two trials (1579 women), the
policy about routine EFM was unknown (average RR 0.89, 95%
CI 0.80 to 0.99). Chi² for the subgroup comparison = 0.07, P =
0.97, Analysis 4.6. There is no clear difference in numbers of
women receiving any analgesia or anaesthesia between the
subgroups. Women who had routine EFM, and those where it
was not clear if they had EFM, who had continuous support
were less likely to require analgesia although this result is
borderline. The effect was not clear for the women who did not
have routine EFM.
7. Synthetic oxytocin during labour: In four trials (8340
women) EFM was routine (average RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to
1.11). In eight trials (1789 women) EFM was not routine
(average RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.01). In five trials (2718
women) it is not known whether EFM was routine (average RR
1.02, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.08). Chi² for the subgroup comparison
= 4.62, P = 0.10, Analysis 4.7. There was no evidence of a
subgroup difference for this outcome.
8. Caesarean birth: In nine trials (10,123 women), EFM was
routine (average RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.00). In nine trials
(2529 women) EFM was not routine (average RR 0.59, 95% CI
0.43 to 0.81). In six trials (2695 women), it is not known
whether EFM was routine (average RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.56 to
1.32). Chi² for the subgroup comparison = 3.95, P = 0.14,
Analysis 4.8. There was no evidence of a subgroup difference for
this outcome. Women who had continuous support and did not
have routine EFM were less likely to have a caesarean section.
The subgroup of women who did have routine EFM and
continuous care probably had fewer caesarean sections then those
with usual care but the result is borderline.
Subgroup B: Provider characteristics
1. Spontaneous vaginal birth: In nine trials (10,813 women)
the support was provided by a member of the hospital staff
(average RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09). In six trials (2035
women) the support was provided by a woman who was not part
of the hospital staff nor part of the woman’s social network
(average RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.26). In six trials (1620
women), the support was provided by a member of the woman’s
social network (average RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11). Chi² for
the subgroup comparison = 3.99, P = 0.14, Analysis 5.1. There is
no evidence of a difference between subgroups. The largest
effect, favouring continuous support, was observed in the group
of women supported by people not employed by the hospital or
chosen by the women, for example, doulas, although
heterogeneity is high within this outcome. A smaller effect size
was seen with support given by hospital staff. The difference in
spontaneous vaginal birth numbers between usual care and
continuous care for women who chose their companion was not
clear.
2. Negative ratings of or negative views about the birth
experience: in four trials (8145 women) support providers were
hospital staff (average RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.03). In three
trials (1325 women) the providers were not hospital staff and not
part of the woman’s social network (average RR 0.65, 95% CI
0.53 to 0.80). In four trials (1708 women), providers were part
of the woman’s social network (average RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.50 to
0.67). Chi² for the subgroup comparison = 12.65, P = 0.002,
Analysis 5.2. The effect size of negative views about the birth
experience, favouring continuous support, was similar for
women who were supported by someone not employed by the
hospital, if they knew the person giving the support or not. The
effect was less clear with those women who were supported by
hospital staff with the CI crossing the line of no effect. The
subgroup difference was still apparent even when we omitted the
two trials where we had analysed the data as reciprocals
(Bruggemann 2007; Campbell 2006), test for subgroup
differences: Chi² = 5.24, P = 0.07.
3. Postpartum depression: too few trials contributed to this
outcome to produce a meaningful subgroup analysis, Analysis

4. Admission to special care nursery: in three trials (7428
women), the support was provided by a member of the hospital
staff (average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.20). In two trials (829
women), the support was provided by a woman who was not a
member of the hospital staff and not part of the woman’s social
network (average RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.87). In two trials
(640 women) the support was provided by a member of the
woman’s social network (average RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.61 to
3.14). Chi² for the subgroup comparison = 1.47, P = 0.48,
Analysis 5.4. There were only seven trials in this subgroup
analysis and there was no evidence of a difference between them.
All subgroup meta-analysis crossed the line of no effect.
5. Exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point: no trials
contributed to this outcome, Analysis 5.5.
6. Any intrapartum analgesia or anaesthesia: In six trials (9152

(1790 women), the support was provided by a woman who was
not a member of the staff and was not part of the woman’s social

 1.01). Chi² for the subgroup comparison = 3.16, P = 0.21,
Analysis 5.6. There was no evidence of a difference between
subgroups for this outcome, CIs overlapped, and were either very
close to, or touching the line of no effect.
7. Synthetic oxytocin during labour: In six trials (9561
women), the support was provided by a member of the hospital
staff (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.11). In four trials
(1081 women), the support was provided by a woman who was
not a member of the staff and was not part of the woman’s social
network (average RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.06). In seven trials
(2191 women), the support was provided by a member of the
woman’s social network (average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96 to
1.01). Chi² for the subgroup comparison = 3.04, P = 0.22,
Analysis 5.7. There was no evidence of a subgroup difference.
8. Caesarean birth: in nine trials (10,786 women), the support
was provided by a member of the hospital staff (average RR 0.94,
95% CI 0.84 to 1.05). In nine trials (2502 women), the support
was provided by a woman who was not a member of the hospital
staff and not part of the woman’s social network (average RR
0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.83). In six trials (2059 women), the
support was provided by a member of the woman’s social network
(average RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.17). Chi² for the subgroup
comparison = 7.02, P = 0.03, Analysis 5.8. There appears to be
evidence of a subgroup difference between the groups of women
supported by hospital staff, and those supported by non-staff,
not chosen by the women herself. For reducing caesarean section
rates, the effect was greater for women being supported by a
companion who they did not choose and were not hospital staff.
Continuous support by hospital staff did not make a clear
difference. Similarly, there was not a clear difference for women
with support given by a chosen companion although the meta-
analysis appears to favour continuous support over usual care.
Subgroup C: Timing of onset of continuous support
We were unable to conduct the planned subgroup comparison
based on timing of onset of labour support as it was not possible
to categorise most of the trials according to this pre-specified sub-
group.
Subgroup D: Model of support
1. Spontaneous vaginal birth: no trials contributed to this
outcome.
2. Negative ratings of or negative views about the birth
experience: no trials contributed to this outcome.
3. Postpartum depression: no trials contributed to this
outcome.
4. Admission to special care nursery: no trials contributed to
this outcome.
5. Exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point: too few
trials contributed to this outcome to produce a meaningful
subgroup analysis, Analysis 6.1.
6. Any intrapartum analgesia or anaesthesia: no trials
contributed to this outcome.
7. Synthetic oxytocin during labour: no trials contributed to
this outcome.
8. Caesarean birth: no trials contributed to this outcome.
Subgroup E: Country income level
1. Spontaneous vaginal birth: 10 trials (11,284 women) were
conducted in high-income countries (HIC) (average RR 1.07,
95% CI 1.02 to 1.12). Eleven trials (3085 women) were
conducted in middle-income countries (MIC) (average RR 1.11,
95% CI 1.03 to 1.20). Chi² for subgroup comparison = 0.72, P
= 0.39, Analysis 7.1. There was no evidence of a subgroup
difference between the groups, but both had more spontaneous
vaginal births in the continuous support groups though the
effect was greater in MIC.
2. Negative ratings of or negative views about the birth
experience: six trials (9021 women) took place in HIC (average
RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.93). Five trials took place in middle-
income countries (MIC) (average RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52 to
0.76; participants = 2112). Chi² for the subgroup comparison =
1.34, P = 0.25, Analysis 7.2. There was no clear difference
among groups from different countries. All women reported less
negative feeling about their childbirth experience if they had
continuous support in labour. It should be noted, that when the
two trials that reported reciprocal data were omitted from the
analysis (Bruggemann 2007; Campbell 2006), there was
evidence of a small subgroup difference, test for subgroup
differences: Chi² = 3.09, P = 0.08.
3. Postpartum depression: too few trials contributed to this
outcome to produce a meaningful subgroup analysis, Analysis
7.3.
4. Admission to special care nursery: three trials (7740
women) took place in HIC (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to
1.11). Four trials (1157 women) took place in MIC (average RR
0.80, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.56). Chi² for subgroup comparison =
0.11, P = 0.74, Analysis 7.4. There were no clear differences
among trials conducted in HIC and MIC. Trials in all countries
did not find a clear difference between continuous support and
usual care in numbers of babies admitted to special care nurseries.
5. Exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point: too few
trials contributed to this outcome to produce a meaningful
subgroup analysis, Analysis 7.5.
6. Any analgesia or anaesthesia: eight trials (10,145 women)
were conducted in HIC (average RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to
0.97). Seven trials (2288 women) took place in MIC (average
RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04). Chi² for subgroup differences =
0.52, P = 0.47, Analysis 7.6. There was no evidence of a
subgroup difference. Both subgroups appeared to favour
continuous support although the results were unclear.
7. Synthetic oxytocin during labour: six trials (9907 women)

 took place in HIC (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.08).
Eleven trials (2926 women) took place in MIC (average RR
0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05). Chi² for subgroup differences =
0.38, P = 0.54, Analysis 7.7. There was no difference between
subgroups for this outcome. The CIs of both groups touch the
line of no effect.
8. Caesarean birth: twelve trials (11,738 women) took place in
HIC (average RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.02). Twelve trials
(3609 women) took place in MIC (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to
0.84). Chi² for subgroup differences = 4.30, P = 0.04, Analysis
7.8. There appears to be evidence of a subgroup difference with
trials in MIC reporting a larger effect size in the form of fewer
caesarean births taking place in the continuous support group.
Whilst trials in HIC report results in the same direction, the
effect size was smaller and CIs just cross the line of no effect.

Summary of main results
This review included a total of 27 trials and summarises data from
26 trials involving 15,858 women, conducted in hospital settings
in 17 countries under a wide variety of circumstances. Continu-
ous one-to-one support was given by providers with a variety of
experiences, through having given birth themselves or education
or both, and practice as nurses, midwives, doulas or childbirth
educators, or by the woman’s spouse or partner, female relative or
close friend.
In the primary comparison, women who were allocated to con-
tinuous one-to-one support were more likely to have a sponta-
neous vaginal birth (low-quality evidence) and less likely to have
any intrapartum analgesia or to report negative ratings of or neg-
ative feelings about the birth experience (low-quality evidence). In
addition, these women had shorter labours (low-quality evidence),
were less likely to have a caesarean birth (low-quality evidence) or
instrumental vaginal birth, regional analgesia, or a baby with a
low five-minute Apgar score. Data from two trials for postpartum
depression were not combined due to differences in women, hos-
pitals and care providers included; both trials found fewer women
developed depressive symptomatology if they had been supported
in birth, although this may have been a chance result in one of
the studies (low-quality evidence). There was no apparent impact
on other intrapartum interventions, maternal or neonatal compli-
cations, or breastfeeding, such as admission to special care nurs-
ery (low-quality evidence), and exclusive or any breastfeeding at
any time point, as defined by trial authors (low-quality evidence).
This review did not identify any adverse effects of continuous
labour support. This form of care appears to confer important
benefits without attendant risks. The results of earlier versions of
this review prompted organisations in Canada, the UK and the
USA to issue practice guidelines, advocating continuous support
(ACOG 2017; ACOG 2016; AWHONN 2002; MIDIRS 2008;
NICE Intrapartum Care 2007; Lee [SOGC] 2016; World Health
Organization 2015; World Health Organization 2016). The re-
sults of the primary comparison in the current review offer con-
tinued justification for such practice guidelines.
The subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution. Indi-
vidually, each should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-
generating, particularly when the sample size in one subgroup was
much smaller than in another. However, taken in their totality,
the consistency of the patterns suggests that the effectiveness of
continuous intrapartum support may be enhanced or reduced by
policies and practices in the birth setting and by the nature of
the relationship between the provider of continuous support and
labouring woman.
We chose three aspects of the birth environment - routine use of
electronic fetal monitoring (EFM), availability of epidural anal-
gesia and policies about the presence of additional support peo-
ple of the woman’s own choosing - as proxies for environmen-
tal conditions that may mediate the effectiveness of labour sup-
port. This review cannot answer questions about the mechanisms
whereby settings with epidural analgesia limit the effectiveness of
labour support. The impact of epidural analgesia may be direct
(Anim-Somuah 2011) or indirect, as part of the ’cascade of in-
terventions’ described in the Background. The effects of a policy
of routine EFM are less clear, possibly because we were unable to
obtain information about EFM policies for several of the trials.
Women who were not permitted to have companions with them
in labour, benefited more from continuous support than those in
settings that permitted their own companions, in the form of fewer
caesarean sections and more spontaneous vaginal births. Labour
support appears to be effective in reducing the adverse conse-
quences of the fear and distress associated with labouring alone in
an unfamiliar environment. A report of a qualitative component
of one of the included trials (Langer 1998), aptly titled “Alone, I
wouldn’t have known what to do”, provides further justification
for this argument.
Effects of continuous labour support may vary by provider char-
acteristics. Divided loyalties, additional duties besides labour sup-
port, self-selection and the constraints of institutional policies and
routine practices may all have played a role in the apparently lim-
ited effectiveness of members of the hospital staff. Childbirth envi-
ronments influence the healthcare professionals who work in them
as well as labouring women and their support people. Further-
more, while women often want and benefit from the presence of
selected members of their social network, the support of partners
and others with whom they have a longstanding relationship is
qualitatively different and more complex than that of a woman
who is experienced and often trained to provide labour support
and who has no other role other than to provide support. Members
of a woman’s social network may be less experienced with child-
birth and have their own needs relating to the woman, baby and
childbirth process, compared to someone in a doula role. An early
34

 trial of labour support with partners present found that women re-
ceived more support from their partners when a doula was present
to guide them, and the partners themselves reported more sup-
port (Hodnett 1989). While continuous labour support appears
to be more effective in achieving desirable clinical outcomes and
fewer negative experiences when it is provided by someone in a
doula role (e.g. caregivers who are not employees of an institution
and thus have no obligation to anyone other than the labouring
woman) and who have an exclusive focus on this task, support
from a member of the woman’s social network is effective in re-
ducing women’s negative birth experiences.
Subgroup analysis of trials conducted in high-income countries
compared with trials conducted in middle-income countries sug-
gests that continuous labour support offers similar benefits to
women and babies for most outcomes, with the exception of cae-
sarean birth, where studies from middle-income countries showed
a larger reduction in caesarean birth. It should be noted that only
two included studies were conducted in lower-middle income
countries (Guatemala (Klaus 1986), and Nigeria (Morhason-Bello
2009)), so conclusions about the effect of continuous support for
women and babies in the poorest countries is limited but worthy
of further exploration.
There remains relatively little information about the effects of
continuous intrapartum support on mothers’ and babies’ health
and well-being in the postpartum period, and none of the included
studies contributed to the proposed subgroup analysis to compare
extended to intrapartum-only models of continuous support.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The studies included in this review are from a diverse range of
geographical locations (Oceania, Europe, Africa, South America,
North America, Middle East and Asia) and country-income levels,
ranging from low- to high-income countries. However, only two
trials were conducted in lower-middle income countries. Although
we included data from 26 studies, there were diverse interventions
among these studies, ranging from providing support only during
active labour to providing support across the pregnancy, labour,
childbirth and postpartum periods.
Many of the studies in this review included only women with
uncomplicated pregnancies, nulliparous women or both. Nulli-
parous women are an important group to target as they are by
definition less experienced with the childbirth process compared
to multiparous women, but there is a gap in the evidence related to
multiparous women and women with complicated pregnancies.
Quality of the evidence
We assessed included studies at varying levels of risk of bias (see
Figure 2; Figure 3). None of the studies blinded women or staff
due to the nature of the intervention and only one study (Isbir
2015) attempted to fully blind the outcome assessors. We used
GRADEpro software to assess the quality of evidence contribut-
ing to GRADE outcomes for the main review comparison (see
Summary of findings for the main comparison). Evidence con-
tributing to all GRADE outcomes (spontaneous vaginal birth,
negative rating of/negative feelings about birth experience, post-
partum depression, admission to special care nursery, exclusive or
any breastfeeding at any time point, as defined by trial authors,
labour length, and caesarean birth) were graded low quality. Ev-
idence was downgraded for lack of blinding in studies (it is not
possible to blind study participants or personnel to a continuous
support intervention) and other limitations in study designs, in-
consistency, or imprecision of effect estimates.
Potential biases in the review process
We followed the review process recommended by Cochrane. We
obtained and reviewed all potentially relevant studies identified
from the search results, resolving any disagreements by discussion.
Potential bias in the review process should be minimal: two review
authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted
the data. We resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if re-
quired, we consulted another review author. Review author GJ
Hofmeyr was the author of a study included in this review. He
was not involved in extracting data from the trials which he had
authored. For some outcomes, such as exclusive breastfeeding and
negative rating of or negative feelings about the birth experience,
some trials reported the outcome in the opposite way. For exam-
ple, Hodnett 2002 reported “not breastfeeding at all” at six weeks
postpartum and Bruggemann 2007 reported satisfaction with care
received and Campbell 2006 overall rating of birth experience. We
calculated the reciprocals for these two outcomes so that they could
be included in analyses. We acknowledge that this is not ideal and
so performed additional sensitivity analyses to omit studies with
reciprocal data to ensure that this made no difference to the over-
all result. Sensitivity analyses excluding reciprocal data for these
two outcomes made no difference to the overall results, although
some differences were observed in terms of subgroup analyses, as
reported in the results section.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
There are no other Cochrane Reviews that assess continuous sup-
port for women during childbirth.
A non-Cochrane review (Steel 2015) used critical integrative re-
view methods to explore professional doulas supporting and caring
for women. This review provided a descriptive analysis of work-
force issues in professional doula care, role and skills of profes-
sional doulas, physical outcomes of professional doula care, and
35

 social outcomes of professional doula care, while noting several
methodological weaknesses across the body of evidence.

Implications for practice
Continuous support during labour may improve outcomes for
women and infants, including increased spontaneous vaginal
birth, shorter duration of labour, and decreased caesarean birth,
instrumental vaginal birth, use of any analgesia, use of regional
analgesia, low- five-minute Apgar score and negative feelings about
childbirth experiences. We found no evidence of harms of con-
tinuous labour support. Subgroup analyses should be interpreted
with caution, and considered as exploratory and hypothesis gener-
ating, but evidence suggests continuous labour support with cer-
tain provider characteristics (support from someone with a doula
role), in settings in which epidural analgesia was not routinely
available, in settings where women were not permitted to have
companions of their choosing with them in labour (e.g., spouse/
partner, mother, friend), and in middle-income country settings,
may have a favourable impact on outcomes such as caesarean birth.
Implications for research
There remains relativelylittle information about the effectsof con-
tinuous intrapartum support on mothers’ and babies’ health and
well-being in the postpartum period, and thus trials across all types
of settings, which include a focus on longer-term outcomes for
the woman and baby, would be helpful. In particular, exploring
longer-term outcomes related to exclusive or any breastfeeding,
difficulty mothering, low-self esteem, and unsatisfactory mother-
infant interactions would help to better understand the impact of
continuous support outside the time period of labour, childbirth
and the immediate postpartum period. Relatedly, given the rising
rates of caesarean birth globally, future research could consider ex-
ploring targeted continuous support interventions for nulliparous
women, to reduce the risk of first caesarean birth.
This review update included six new outcomes not previously re-
ported. These outcomes were designed to be woman-centric, pro-
mote the inclusion of women’s experiences of care as important
aspects of quality of care, and ensure that women’s choices, au-
tonomy and control are respected. Woman-reported measures of
the experience and outcomes of maternal and newborn care are
essential for a full evaluation of maternity care practices and sys-
tems. The inclusion of these outcomes is aligned with the World
Health Organization (WHO) vision for quality of care for preg-
nant women and newborns (Tunçalp 2015). We hope that the in-
clusion of these outcomes in this review will encourage researchers,
policy-makers, clinicians and other key stakeholders to consider
the importance of measuring and promoting woman-centred care.
A mixed-methods systematic review concluded that women across
the world may experience mistreatment during childbirth, in-
cluding physical abuse (slapping, hitting, pinching), verbal abuse,
stigma and discrimination, lack of supportive care, neglect and
denial of autonomy (Bohren 2015). It is possible that continuous
support for women during childbirth could help reduce mistreat-
ment during childbirth and promote respectful maternity care, as
a labour companion could act as an advocate for the woman and
potentially safeguard against mistreatment. Further research could
explore the impact of labour companionship on mistreatment and
respectful care.
The trials in resource-constrained countries were relatively small
compared to the trials in higher-income countries. Additional,
larger trials may be required in resource-constrained settings,
where the cost of providing continuous support may compete
with other resource priorities. In these settings, implementation
research could explore how to effectively implement labour com-
panionship to assuage provider and health system barriers to inter-
vention. Outcomes that have been under-researched in resource-
poor settings, but are causes of significant morbidity and poor ex-
periences of care may be worthy of further exploration, includ-
ing urinary and faecal incontinence, pain during intercourse, pro-
longed perineal pain, postpartum depression, respect for women’s
choices and preferences, and promoting dignified and respectful
maternity care.
Trials of different models of training providers of labour support
would help to inform decision makers about the most effective
models in the context of their settings. Trials are also needed to
understand whether an extended model of care across the ante-
natal, intrapartum and postpartum periods adds value to the in-
trapartum-only continuous support, which has been the primary
focus of trials to date. Similarly, future research could compare the
effectiveness of models of one-to-one midwifery care with contin-
uous support by an additional person, as it is unclear whether rou-
tine midwifery tasks such as charting and managing equipment,
impact the provision of supportive care.
Economic analyses of the relative costs and benefits, as well as
sufficient details about the training and/or orientation materials
provided to the support person (whether they are a doula or a
lay person) would be an important contribution to the current
evidence base.

Akbarzadeh 2014
Methods
RCT
Participants
Pregnant women aged 18 to 35 years, with a singleton, term pregnancy, and healthy fetal
membranes. No history of medical, surgical, or mental problems and no special problems
during pregnancy. The participants’ uterine contractions started spontaneously and, at
admission, the contractions occurred every 5 to 10 minutes and cervical dilatation was
3 to 4 cm
Interventions
The study was conducted in Shoushtari Hospital, Iran in 2012. In the supportive care
group (N = 50), the doula was constantly beside the mother from the beginning of the
mother’s maternity ward admission (beginning of the active phase of labour at 3 to 4
cm cervical dilatation) to the end of the second stage of labour. Supportive measures
classified into psychological and emotional, educational, and physical categories were
offered to the mother. Psychological and emotional support included touching, empathy,
compassion, encouraging the mother to continue cooperation in the labour process,
reassurance, taking mother’s hands, maintaining eye contact, creating a sense of trust and
confidence, continuous talking, and reduction of fear during labour. Educational support
included informing the mother about the natural process of childbirth and answering her
questions. Finally, physical support included cooling the mother, satisfying her hunger
and thirst, and helping her change the positions in various stages of labour
The control group (N = 50) received the department’s routine care and underwent no
interventions
Outcomes
Pain assessment (before and after intervention) using the VAS. VAS is a scale numerated
from 0 to 10 with 0, 1 to 3, 4 to 6, 7 to 9, and 10 representing no, mild, moderate,
severe, and the worst possible pain
Mode of delivery (CS, VD)
Notes
For all women who received doula care in the intervention group, the doula was one
researcher. Unknown if companions were typically permitted on the ward, if continuous
EFM was used routinely, or if epidural anaesthesia was available
Dates of study: 2012
Funding: The study was financially supported by the Research Center for Traditional
Medicine andHistoryof Medicine andthe Research Vice-Chancellorof ShirazUniversity
of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran

sure, and control groups using stratified block randomisation.
In doing so, a number was randomly selected from the table
of random numbers and the researcher moved toward the right
or left column or row and wrote the 5 digit numbers down.
Since the participants were divided into 3 groups in this study,
3-therapy method was used and classification was performed as
follows: A: supportive care group, B: acupressure group, and C:
control group. Accordingly, ABC: 1, ACB: 2, BAC: 3, BCA: 4,
CAB: 5, and CBA: 6. It should be noted that numbers 0, 7, and
9 were ignored”
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Unclear risk
Unclear if central randomisation, sequentially numbered/
opaque containers were used during allocation
Blinding of participants and personnel

All outcomes
High risk
There is no mention of blinding of participants or personnel
throughout this study, but blinding of participants and person-

All outcomes
High risk
The study data were collected using interview form (including
demographic information, history of pregnancy, familial status,
and pregnancy information), observation form (including eval-
uation of uterine contractions, fetal heart rate, labour progress,
and delivery outcome), and VAS. VAS is a scale numerated from
0 to 10 with 0, 1 to 3, 4 to 6, 7 to 9, and 10 representing no,
mild, moderate, severe, and the worst possible pain. High risk
of bias for pain reporting in the intervention-supportive care
group, as pain is a subjective and self-reported outcome and
women would know whether they were in the intervention or
control group. Low risk of bias for mode of delivery, as was as-
sessed using observation and mode of delivery is an objective
outcome
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)

Low risk
From tables 1 and 2, it appears that there was no missing data
from either outcome in the intervention or control group

Methods
RCT
Participants
212 nulliparous women in active labour at term (105 support group, 107 control group)
at a University-affiliated hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. To be eligible a companion of
the woman’s choosing had to be available. 49.5% of the companions were present at
enrolment and the others were phoned and asked to come to the hospital (4 failed to
make it before delivery)

Interventions
Support was ’presence of a chosen companion during labour and delivery’. ’The com-
panions received verbal and written information on the activities involved in providing
support, expected behaviour when confronted with signs of tiredness, anxiety, concern,
crying, screaming and/or the woman’s feelings of inability to cope, compliance with
regulations and the possibility of requesting information from staff’. in 47.6% of the
sample the woman’s companion was her partner, for 29.5% it was her mother
The control group received usual care where a companion during labour and delivery
was not permitted
For both groups labour and delivery care was provided ’according to the routine protocol
including active management of labour (early amniotomy, use of oxytocin, intermittent
EFM and systematic analgesia)’
Outcomes
Satisfaction with labour and delivery, perinatal and breastfeeding outcome in the 12
hours post delivery
Notes
All women in labour at this hospital received epidural analgesia as a routine practice.
Therefore, we did not include epidural analgesia data in the review
EFM was not used routinely

Allocation concealment (selection bias)
High risk
’Individual assignment numbers were all placed in an opaque
container to assure the concealment. The eligible women who
had agreed to participate selected one of the numbers once, and
were therefore allocated to either intervention group or control
according to the list.’
This process was open to selection bias as women could have re-
picked another number from the container. No audit process is
possible with this system of randomisation

RCT
Participants
600 nulliparous, low-income, under-insured pregnant women (300 doula group, 300
control group)bookedfordeliveryatahospital inNewJersey, USA were enrolledbetween
12 and 38 weeks’ gestation. They were considered low risk, with no contraindications
to labour and had a female friend or relative willing to act as their lay doula. The doula
was in addition to support people of their own choosing
Interventions
Intervention: continuous support by a female friend or relative who had 2, 2-hour
sessions about labour support. The training sessions were conducted for nearly all of the
lay caregivers when the participants were 34 to 36 weeks’ gestation
Control group: support people of their own choosing
Outcomes
Labour length, epidural analgesia, oxytocin augmentation, cervical dilation at epidural
insertion, length of second stage labour, caesarean birth, 1-min Apgar score > 6, 5-min
Apgar score > 6, delayed initiation of breastfeeding
Notes
Epidural analgesia was available and EFM was used routinely
Dates of study: enrolment took place between 1998 and 2002
Funding: Johnson & Johnson provided a small stipend to complete the data analysis.

Medical record information was completed for 97.7% of the
sample (82.3% in the intervention group and 94.3% in the con-

the intervention group for doula related reasons (incomplete
training and not being present during labour). The 6-week ques-
tionnaire was completed for 82.3% of the sample. Only those
women included in the study at delivery had the opportunity to
complete the questionnaire and thus the differential completion
rate between groups remained (76.3% in the intervention group
and 88.3% in the control group). The differential withdrawals
could introduce selection bias

group, i.e. some women were withdrawn because of an event that
occurred before the support person arrived. Women in the control
group with the same event were not withdrawn. We were able to
re-create the original study groups for 1 outcome only, caesarean
birth, and therefore it was included in the analysis table

fetal presentation, cervical dilatation < 5 cm, in a hospital in Perth, Western Australia
Interventions
Group 1: continuous physical and emotional support by midwifery staff, and women
were encouraged to use pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic alternatives to epidural
analgesia.
Group 2: continuous midwifery support was not provided and women were encouraged
to have epidural analgesia as their primary method of pain relief in labour
Outcomes
Labour length (expressed as median and interquartile range), epidural analgesia, mode
of delivery, 5 min Apgar score < 7, arterial cord pH

Notes
The stated purpose was to compare the effects of intrapartum analgesic techniques on
labour outcomes. Continuous midwifery support was conceptualised as an analgesic
technique. Both groups had access to opioids and nitrous oxide. No data were presented
about the number of women who used no pharmacologic analgesia. Because the type of
analgesia used was a measure of compliance rather than an outcome, no data on analgesic
outcomes are included in this review
It was not stated if other support person was allowed. epidural analgesia was available
and EFM was used routinely

treal, Canada, were randomly allocated to experimental (N = 209) or control (N = 204)
groups. All but 3 in the experimental group and 6 in the control group were accompa-
nied by a spouse, relative or friend during labour. All participants were nulliparous, with
singleton fetuses, > 37 weeks’ gestation, and in labour
Interventions
Experimental: One-to-one nursing care from randomisation until 1 hour post birth. Care
was provided by on-call nurses who were hired specifically for the study and had received
a 30-hour training program and quarterly refresher workshops. The training program
included critical reviews of the literature concerning the effects of intrapartum medical
and nursing practices, as well as discussions of stress and pain management techniques.
The nurse provided the usual nursing care plus physical comfort, emotional support,
and instruction on relaxation and coping techniques. The nurse took meal breaks and
brief rest breaks
Women in the comparison group received usual nursing care by the regular unit staff,
consisting of intermittent support and monitoring
Outcomes
Caesarean birth, caesarean birth for cephalopelvic disproportion or failure to progress,
post-randomisation artificial oxytocin augmentation, post-randomisation analgesia/
anaesthesia, instrumental vaginal delivery (forceps or vacuum extraction), NICU admis-
sion, perineal trauma, mean duration of labour post-randomisation, postpartum urinary
catheterisation
Notes
The participants had been admitted to the unit for an average of 5 hours (SD = 4 hours)
prior to randomisation. 36 women in the experimental group and 41 in the control
group had epidural analgesia prior to randomisation. 55 women in the experimental
group and 45 in the control group had intravenous oxytocin augmentation of labour
prior to randomisation. Mean duration of labour post-randomisation was 9.2 hours (SD
= 4.3)
Epidural analgesia was available but it was not stated if EFM was used routinely

Methods
RCT
Participants
248pregnantwomen(124control group, 124doulagroup)attending 2affiliatedprenatal
clinics, who were aged under 22 years, less than 34 weeks’ gestation, and not planning
to move from the area or give their baby up for adoption
Interventions
Intervention: doula support from a community doula service during pregnancy through
3 months postpartum, as well as usual care services. 4 doulas were trained as part of
the program, from the communities surrounding the hospital, and participated in a 10
week training session. Doulas initiated contact with participants, and scheduled weekly
visits throughout her pregnancy through 3 months postpartum, and participants were
encouraged to call the doula when they went into labour
Control: usual prenatal healthcare and social services
Outcomes
Parent-child interactions: reported through 2 parenting constructs (maternal sensitive
responsiveness and maternal encouragement and guidance) and 1 child construct (pos-
itive involvement with parent), as measured through video recordings of parent-child
interactions at 4, 12 and 24 months of age using the Parent-Child Observation Guide
Parenting attitudes: reported through the Adult-Adolescent Parenting Inventory at 4
months of age
Parenting stress: reported through the Parenting Stress Inventory-Short Form at 4, 12
and 24 months of age
Breastfeeding duration
Notes
For all women who received doula care in the intervention group, the doula was 1
of 4 study doulas. Unknown if companions were typically permitted on the ward, if
continuous EFM was used routinely, or if epidural anaesthesia was available. Women in
the doula group were encouraged to contact their doula at the start of their labour, but
only 101 women (81.5%) in the doula group had the doula in attendance at the birth.
The authors report that the most common reasons for doula absence at the birth were:
(1) short labours; and (2) failed communication between the woman and the doula. In

Methods
2 RCTs reported in the same publication. The Zelen method was used: only those
participants randomised to the experimental group were told the true purpose of the
trial and asked for consent. The participants in the control group were told about the
study in the introduction letter for the postpartum questionnaire and they were told it
was “a study on factors influencing birth”
Participants
Healthy nulliparous and parous women in labour at a hospital in Finland. 86 women
were enrolled in Trial A. The actual number enrolled to each group was not noted but
medical record data were collected for 79 women (41 in the support group and 38 in
the control group). These 79 women represented 91.9% of the total sample

Methods
RCT, stratified by type of prenatal classes (Lamaze versus general)
Participants
145 nulliparous women (72 to support group and 73 to control) in the last trimester of
a healthy pregnancy, booked for delivery at a Toronto, Canada, hospital
Interventions
Support provided by a monitrice (community ’lay’ midwife or midwifery apprentice)
compared with usual hospital care, defined as the intermittent presence of a nurse. Sup-
port described as including physical comfort measures, continuous presence, informa-
tion, emotional support, and advocacy. The monitrice met with the woman twice in the
latter weeks of pregnancy, to discuss her birth plans
Comparable prenatal attention was provided to the controls.
All but 1 woman also had husbands or partners present during labour. Support began
in early labour at home or in hospital and continued through delivery
Outcomes
Intrapartum interventions, perceived control, method of delivery

Methods
Multicentre RCT with prognostic stratification for parity and hospital
Participants
6915 nulliparous and parous women in labour at 13 hospitals in the USA and Canada
(3454 to continuous labour support and 3461 to usual care). Eligibility criteria: live
singleton fetus or twins, no contraindications to labour, in labour. Women were excluded
if gestational age was < 34 weeks or if they were so high risk that a 1:1 patient-nurse ratio
was medically necessary
Interventions
Experimental: continuous support from staff labour and delivery nurses who had volun-
teered for and received a 2-day training workshop in labour support. Prior to the trial,
the support nurses had opportunities to practice their skills. They also had opportunities
to continue learning from each other and the labour support trainer, throughout the
trial. The nurses with training were part of the regular staffing complement of the unit
and they provided care to the continuous support group but not to the usual care group
Usual care: intermittent support from a nurse who had not received labour support
training
Outcomes
Intrapartum interventions, method of birth, immediate complications (mother or baby)
, complications (mother or baby) in the first 6-8 weeks postpartum, perceived control,
postpartum depression, breastfeeding at 6-8 weeks, relationship with partner and with
baby, likes and dislikes about birth experience and future preferences for labour support

Methods
RCT
Participants
This study took place in the obstetrics clinic of a state hospital in a city located in the
Middle Anatolia Region in Turkey between April and August 2014. Pregnant women
at least 18 years of age, who were literate, with at least a primary school education,
gestational age ≥ 37 weeks, conscious, able to communicate in Turkish, and ≥ 3 cm
dilated
Interventions
The intervention group (N = 36) was given routine care and continuous supportive care
during labour and delivery. Supportive care was provided by 5 midwifery students from
the School of Health who had taken an obstetrics course in their third year and had
expressed willingness to join the study. The students were provided 24 hours of skills
training directed toward continuous supportive care and practices during labour and a
2-hour theoretical course for the research procedures that was taught by the researchers.
The interventions began upon hospital admission and finished at the end of the third
stage of labour. Participants in the control group (N = 36) received the routine care
that was normally provided at the hospital only. At the participating hospital, pregnant
women are monitored, and midwives perform the deliveries; doctors are consulted when
necessary. The physical support normally offered by midwives during the first phase
of labour included controlling room temperature and odours, patient positioning, and
hygiene and urinary elimination
Outcomes
Delivery fear (10 item scale to measure fear during delivery) during latent, active and
transitional phases of labour; pain score (assessed on a 10 cm VAS ranging from 0 (no
pain) to 10 (worst pain)) during latent, active and transitional phases of labour; perceived
control and support in birth (SCIB subscales include internal control, external control,
and support, with a total of 33 items and a 5-point Likert scale to score responses, scale
range 33 to 165, higher score associated with higher degree of perceived support and
control during birth); duration of labour (hours); use of oxytocin, and caesarean section
(see note)
Notes
EFM not used routinely and epidural anaesthesia not available in the study hospital.
Women who had in labour emergency caesarean section were excluded from both the
intervention group (N = 3 excluded) and the control group (N = 6 excluded) of the study,
as the investigators felt that the emergency situation interfered with supportive care, and
control passed from the research and midwife team to the doctor. Caesarean section
is included in this review as an outcome, calculated from the number of participants
randomised to the intervention group (N = 36) and control group (N = 36), less the
number of in labour emergency caesarean sections for each group

Interventions
“Women allocated to the intervention group were shown to an isolated room and were
supported by an experienced midwife. The women were free to choose their position,
and able to eat and walk about freely. During labour, the midwife explained the process
of labour and the importance of body relaxation. Midwife-led support included close
physical proximity, touch, and eye contact with the labouring women, and teaching,
reassurance, and encouragement. The midwife remained with the woman throughout
labour and delivery, and applied warm or cold packs to the woman’s back, abdomen,
or other parts of the body, as well as performing massage according to each woman’s
request.”
“Women allocated to the routine care group were admitted to the labour ward (where
5-7 women labour in the same room), did not receive continuous support, and followed
the routine orders of the ward. They did not have a private room, did not receive one-
to-one care,were not permitted food, and did not receive education and explanation
about the labour process. The only persons allowed in the delivery room were nurses,

Methods
RCT of continuous support versus usual care with an ’inconspicuous observer’ plus a
retrospective non-random control group. This review is restricted to comparisons of the
outcomes of the participants who were randomly assigned
Participants
412 nulliparous women (212 in support group and 200 in observed group) were part
of the RCT. They were aged 13 to 34 years, with singleton, term, healthy pregnancies,
many not English-speaking, in active labour at a public hospital in Texas which provides
care for low-income patients
Interventions
The description of the setting, the participants, and the type of care echo developing
world conditions. All women laboured in a large 12-bed room
For the women in the support group a doula stayed by their bedside and gave continuous
support
For those in the observed group they had the routine intermittent presence of a nurse and
continuous presence of an “inconspicuous observer” who “kept a record of staff contact,
interaction and procedures”. The observer was away from the beside and never spoke to
the labouring woman
Outcomes
Analgesia/anaesthesia, labour length, artificial oxytocin use, method of birth, complica-
tions (mother and baby), neonatal health, number of women who rated their experience
as negative
Notes
In instances in which outcome data (such as analgesia/anaesthesia use) in the published
report were only provided for subgroups, the primary author was contacted and he
provided complete outcome data for all women who were originally randomised
Family members were not allowed to be present. Epidural analgesia was available and

There is some discrepancy in the number
of women enrolled in the study. The report
states 412 were enrolled and reports out-
come data on all 412 women. But it also
states that “14 women that agreed to partic-
ipate were not included in the study.” The
reasons for not including them seem to be
events that would happen after randomisa-
tion - e.g. transferred due to staffing limita-

Methods
RCT
Participants
724 women (361 to support and 363 to control) admitted for delivery at a large social
security hospital in Mexico City, who met the following criteria: singleton fetus, no
previous vaginal delivery, < 6 cm cervical dilatation, and no indications for an elective
caesarean delivery
Interventions
Support group: continuous support from 1 of 10 women who had received doula training
(6 were retired nurses), throughout labour, birth, and the immediate postpartum period.
Support included: emotional support, information, physical comfort measures, social
communication, ensuring immediate contact between mother and baby after birth, and
offering advice about breastfeeding during a single brief session postnatally
Control group: women received “routine care”
Outcomes
The main outcomes were exclusive and full breastfeeding at 1 month postpartum. Other
outcomes included labour length, epidural anaesthesia, forceps birth, caesarean birth,
meconium staining, and Apgar scores, as well as mothers’ perceived control during
childbirth, anxiety, pain, satisfaction, and self-esteem

Methods
RCT. Enrollment occurred at childbirth education classes and randomisation occurred
when the woman arrived at hospital in labour
Participants
420 nulliparous middle and upper class women (224 on doula group and 196 in control
group) were enrolled in the third trimester of an uncomplicated pregnancy in Cleveland,
Ohio. All women expected to be accompanied during labour by their male partner
Interventions
Experimental group: a doula met the couple at the hospital as soon as possible after
randomassignment(typicallywithinanhour of theirarrival at the hospital)andremained
with them throughout labour and delivery. The central component of doula support
was the doula’s continuous bedside presence during labour and delivery, although her
specificactivitieswere individualisedtothe needsof the labouring woman. Doulasupport
included close physical proximity, touch, and eye contact with the labouring woman,
and teaching, reassurance, and encouragement of the woman and her male partner. All
doulas completed training requirements that were equivalent to the DONA international
doula certification
Control group: routine obstetric and nursing care which included the presence of a male
partner or other support person
Outcomes
Caesarean delivery, epidural anaesthesia, oxytocin use, labour length, mode of delivery,
fever during labour, satisfaction at 6 weeks postpartum
Notes
Epidural analgesia was available and EFM was used routinely.

 Morhason-Bello 2009
Methods
RCT
Participants
603womenfromIbadan, Nigeriawith anticipatedvaginal deliverywere enrolledbetween
30 and 32 weeks’ gestation at an antenatal clinic (305 to intervention and 298 to control)
from November 2006 to March 2007
Interventions
Those in the experimental group were informed to bring someone of their choice to
act as a companion during labour. On arrival in labour the accompanying companions
were provided with an information leaflet that explained their responsibilities. These
included: gentle massage of the woman’s back during contraction, reassuring words,
spiritual support inform of prayers and also acting as intermediary between the woman
and healthcare team. After studying the leaflets, they were allowed to seek clarifications.
The information leaflet was also interpreted for those that are not literate. The attending
midwife allowed and ensured companions performed their expected duties throughout.
The companions were told to offer continuous support - they were to be by the patient’s
side except for feeding and use of toilet until 2 hours after childbirth. Husbands were
the most common support person (65.4%)
The women in the control group had only routine care where relatives of patients are
usually barred from the labour ward
Outcomes
Caesarean section rate, active phase of labour duration, pain score, need for analgesia,
need for oxytocin augmentation, time from delivery to initiation of breastfeeding and
the emotional experience during labour
Notes
Epidural analgesia was not available and it was not stated whether EFM was used rou-
tinely. We have requested further details from the authors
The randomisation process was well done, but resulted in an imbalance in socioeco-
nomic status between the groups. Women in the experimental group tended to be more
educated (82% versus 48% with tertiary level) and skilled workers (78% versus 39%).
This imbalance was noted and discussed by the authors

Methods
RCT
Participants
150 primiparous women with a single foetus, who arrived at the labour ward in active
labour (4 cm cervical dilatation). The age range of the women was 18 to 34 years, and
gestational age was 38 to 42 weeks. None of the women had evidence of any severe
obstetric disease
Interventions
This study was carried out in maternity wards of Zahedan and Mirjaveh, Iran from July
2007 to May 2008. Women in the intervention group received doula support during
active labour from an untrained woman such as a female friend or relative (mother-in-
law, mother, sister-in-law, sister) who had been selected by the mother
Women in the control group (without doula support) received routine care. To avoid
contamination between the intervention and control groups, separate labour rooms,
screens between the beds or beds at opposite ends of the same room were used
Outcomes
Severity of pain: using a VAS at the beginning of active labour (4 cm cervical dilation)
and at the end of the second active phase of labour (10 cm cervical dilatation)
Duration of the active phases of labour
Mode of delivery
Use of medication (oxytocin/promethazine/hyosin)

Interventions
Intervention group: psychosocial support during labour from a companion chosen by
the pregnant woman. The companions were trained by trial staff to provide emotional
support, promote physical comfort and encourage progress of labour, without interfering
with the activities of the obstetricians or midwives. They were with the labouring woman
continuously from admission to delivery. Women were encouraged to pick a companion
who had experienced a vaginal birth

Bender 1968
Two studies were reported, N = 12 in the first study and N = 30 in the second. Neither was an RCT.
Both employed alternate allocation that was neither centrally controlled nor concealed. The researcher
delivered the intervention and collected outcome data. In the first study the researcher also enrolled
participants. No usable outcome data were reported
Bochain 2000
The intervention was not continuous labour support. It was a short nursing intervention (taking ap-
proximately 1 hour) administered in early labour for women undergoing Misoprostol induction
Brown 2007
The intervention was not continuous labour support. It was an educational intervention to promote
childbirth companions in hospital deliveries. A cluster-RCT was undertaken at 10 South African state
maternity hospitals

Not a trial. A review of selected studies of intrapartum support
Senanayake 2013
Control group not randomised
Sosa 1980
Strong evidence of selection bias. “A woman was removed from the study if labour was false or prolonged;
if fetal distress necessitated an intervention such as oxytocin, caesarean delivery, or forceps”; or if the
infant was asphyxiated or ill at birth, etc. “If a woman was removed, her group assignment was inserted
at random into the pool of unused assignments. Women were enrolled in the study until there were 20
in the control group and 20 in the experimental group.” The total study sample of 127 mothers includes
95 in the control group and 32 in the experimental group. Thus assignment was not random
Trueba 2000
Direct contact with investigator revealed that randomisation was not used. On arrival at the hospital,
women were asked if they wanted to have a doula. If they accepted, a doula was assigned to them. Also
support was not continuous throughout active labour for most women, since admission to the labour
ward (and assignment of a doula) did not usually occur until 8 cm

control groups.” Women who developed severe complications in labour (number not specified), such as
fetal distress, were dropped from the study

The study compared 2 types of nursing care: intervention is continuous primary nursing care, compared
to task-centred primary nursing care
Zhang 1996b
Not a trial of continuous 1-to-1 support. On admission to the labour ward, women received instruction
about normal labour, non-pharmacological methods to ease pain, and how to push in second stage, from
a team of physicians and nurses. Support was continuous, depending on the women’s needs, but not 1-

able follow-up rate for long term outcomes, and we
expanded the number of outcomes to be included in
the planned subgroup analyses

In this review update, we re-organised the outcome list and added six new outcomes from the previous version of the review (Hodnett
2013). These include:
• delayed skin-to-skin contact, as defined by trial authors;
• delayed initiation of breastfeeding (more than one hour after birth, or as defined by trial authors);
• time from birth to initiation of breastfeeding;
• unlikely to recommend birth in that institution;
• restricted mobility during labour, as defined by trial authors; and
• unsatisfactory mother-infant interactions.

 We included these outcomes based on the rationale that women’s experiences of care are an important component of quality of care, as
noted in the World Health Organization (WHO) quality of care vision for pregnant women and newborns (Tunçalp 2015). We based
these outcomes on available evidence, including the WHO Standards for improving quality of maternal and newborn care in health
facilities (World Health Organization 2016), and other Cochrane Reviews that explored similar topics. In this update, we assessed all
new trials for these outcomes, and returned to all previously included trials to identify and include any data contributing to these new
outcomes.
We also modified one review outcome to “Exclusive or any breastfeeding at any time point as defined by trial authors” (from “Breast-
feeding at one to two months postpartum”), to be more inclusive of trials that had postpartum follow-up at a time point outside of the
specified range.
We have added two new subgroup analyses on the model of support received (support solely during the intrapartum period, compared
with extended support during antenatal and postpartum periods, in addition to continuous support during the intrapartum period),
and country income level where trials were conducted (high-income countries compared to low- and middle-income countries).
This review update also includes an assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
We also performed sensitivity analyses for any outcomes where reciprocal data had to be calculated in order to include data in an analysis
(exclusive breastfeeding; negative rating of/negative feelings about the birth experience).
In 2017, we added in an additional search of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP).
