Mechanical allodynia is a major symptom of neuropathic pain whereby innocuous touch
evokes severe pain. Here we identify a population of peripheral sensory neurons expressing
TrkB that are both necessary and sufficient for producing pain from light touch after nerve
injury in mice. Mice in which TrkB-Cre-expressing neurons are ablated are less sensitive to
the lightest touch under basal conditions, and fail to develop mechanical allodynia in a model
of neuropathic pain. Moreover, selective optogenetic activation of these neurons after nerve
injury evokes marked nociceptive behavior. Using a phototherapeutic approach based upon
BDNF, the ligand for TrkB, we perform molecule-guided laser ablation of these neurons and
achieve long-term retraction of TrkB-positive neurons from the skin and pronounced reversal
of mechanical allodynia across multiple types of neuropathic pain. Thus we identify the
peripheral neurons which transmit pain from light touch and uncover a novel pharmacological
strategy for its treatment.

n neuropathic pain patients, hypersensitivity to light touch can
develop to the extent that movement of a single hair shaft is
sufficient to provoke severe pain1. This is difficult to treat
using conventional analgesics such as opioid or NSAIDS, and it
impacts greatly upon quality of life due to the pervasive nature of
mechanical stimuli; for example, small movements of the body, or
the weight of clothing can cause severe pain in neuropathic
patients2. While much recent progress has been made in deli-
neating the spinal circuits that gate mechanical pain3–6, the
identity of the sensory neurons that input this sensation into the
spinal cord is less clear7.
Hypothetically,
mechanical
hypersensitivity
could
be
mediated either by sensitization of nociceptors (hyperalgesia), or
through integration of input from low-threshold mechan-
oreceptors
into
pain
transmitting
circuits
(allodynia)1.
In human studies, there is little evidence for nociceptor sensiti-
zation, and most reports indicate that mechanical allodynia is
conveyed by myelinated A-fiber mechanoreceptors, although it is
not known which subtype2. Thus, differential block of these
nerves alleviates brush-evoked pain8, and the short latency of
pain perception is indicative of the fast conduction velocity of A-
fibers9. In experimental animal studies the situation is less clear.
For example, it has been demonstrated that mice develop
mechanical
allodynia
in
neuropathic
pain
models
even
when all nociceptors are genetically ablated10. In contrast, iso-
lectin
B4-positive
nociceptors
have
also
been
implicated
as drivers of allodynia11. Another study proposed unmyelinated
C-low
threshold
mechanoreceptors
marked
by
Vglut3
expression as a candidate population for driving mechanical
hypersensitivity12. However, allodynia persists even when these
neurons fail to develop13, and recent evidence indicates that
transient Vglut3 expression in spinal interneurons accounts for
the
phenotype4.
Finally,
A-fibers
marked
by
de
novo
expression of neuropeptide Y14, TLR5 expression15, or TrkB
expression16 have also been suggested to influence mechanical
hypersensitivity.
The skin is innervated by an array of functionally distinct
populations of mechanoreceptors that can be distinguished by
their
conduction
velocity,
response
properties,
mechanical
threshold, and the type of end organ that they innervate17.
Molecular markers for many of these populations have recently
been identified, among which, the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB,
has been proposed to mark both D-hairs18 and rapidly adapting
Aβ mechanoreceptors (RAMs)19–21. These neurons innervate the
same hair follicle forming a functional unit18, and are among the
most sensitive of all cutaneous mechanoreceptors, and respond
preferentially to dynamic stimuli, making them a strong candi-
date for the neuronal subtype mediating mechanical allodynia.
Here we generated an inducible TrkBCreERT2 mouse line to
manipulate this population of neurons in adult mice in vivo.
Through loss- and gain-of-function experiments, we demonstrate
that TrkB-positive neurons are both necessary and sufficient for
the expression of mechanical hypersensitivity after nerve injury.
Because TrkB is a cell surface receptor, we reasoned that its ligand
BDNF could allow for pharmacological targeting of these neurons
and suppression of their role in driving mechanical allodynia. We
therefore generated a recombinant BDNFSNAP fusion protein and
conjugated
it
to
the
near
infra-red
(IR)
photosensitizer
IRDye®700DX phthalocyanine (IR700). In vivo delivery of
BDNFSNAP-IR700 and near IR illumination led to a retraction of
TrkB-positive sensory neurons from the skin and a prolonged
alleviation of mechanical hypersensitivity in multiple models of
neuropathic pain. Thus, ligand-guided laser ablation of a subset of
mechanoreceptors in the skin is an effective means of selectively
silencing the input, which drives mechanical allodynia in neu-
ropathic pain states.
Results
TrkB-positive sensory neurons are D-hair and RAMS. We
generated
TrkBCreERT2
mice
(Supplementary
Fig.
1)
and
crossed them with Rosa26RFP reporter mice to examine co-
localization of TrkB with established cellular markers in adult
mouse sensory ganglia. Approximately 10% of neurons in the
dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were positive for TrkBCreERT2, corre-
sponding
to
the
~8%
of
cells
which
expressed
TrkB
mRNA (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2). Expression was evi-
dent in large neurons marked by NF200, and NF200 plus
Ret, and not present in nociceptors positive for IB4 or CGRP, or
C low threshold mechanoreceptors marked by TH (Fig. 1a–d and
Supplementary Fig. 3). To assay TrkBCreERT2-positive sensory
input into the spinal cord, we generated a reporter line in which
Cre-dependent expression of mCherry was driven from the sen-
sory neuron-specific Avil locus (Supplementary Fig. 1B, C).
TrkBCreERT2::AvilmCherry-positive sensory neurons were present
in laminae III/IV of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord,
where they formed column-like structures extending dorsally
(Fig. 1i)18. We further investigated the projections of TrkB neu-
rons to the skin. TrkBCreERT2 fibers formed longitudinal lan-
ceolate endings around hair follicles (Fig. 1j) and extended to
Meissner corpuscles in the glabrous skin (Fig. 1k). We also
examined expression of TrkB in human tissue using a TrkB
antibody. In agreement with mouse data, TrkB immunoreactivity
was present in human DRG in large neurons co-expressing
NF200 and Ret, but largely absent from nociceptors expressing
TrkA (Fig. 1e–h). Similarly, in glabrous skin, TrkB immunor-
eactivity was detected in NF200-positive fibers innervating
Meissner corpuscles (Fig. 1l). Collectively, these data indicate that
TrkBCreERT2 marks a population of putative mechanoreceptive
neurons in mouse and human.
To unequivocally establish the identity of TrkBCreERT2-positive
sensory neurons, we characterized their response properties
utilizing a combination of electrophysiology and optogenetic
activation.
Mice
expressing
the
light-gated
ion
channel
channelrhodopsin-2
(ChR2)
in
TrkB-positive
cells
were
generated (TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2) and an ex vivo skin nerve
preparation was used to identify neuronal subtypes which could
be concomitantly activated by light. Strikingly, we determined
that all D-hair and RAMs could be stimulated by light, whereas
all other subtypes of sensory neurons were not responsive
(Fig. 2a–c). Thus, TrkB marks myelinated neurons that innervate
hair follicles and Meissner’s corpuscles and are tuned to detect
gentle mechanical stimuli.
TrkB+ neurons detect light touch under basal conditions. To
determine the role played by TrkBCreERT2-positive D-hairs and
RAMs in sensory evoked behavior, we genetically ablated
TrkB neurons in the peripheral nervous system. We used
a Cre-dependent diphtheria toxin receptor driven from the Avil
locus22,23 that allowed for selective deletion of TrkB-positive
neurons only in adult sensory ganglia. Upon systemic injection of
diphtheria toxin we achieved an ~85% ablation of TrkBCreERT2::
AviliDTR and TrkB mRNA-positive neurons with a reduction in
the number of NF200-positive neurons by 36% (presumably
reflecting an additional loss of TrkB neurons not detected by
histological
methods),
and
no
change
in
the
expression
of other markers (Fig. 3a–c, Supplementary Fig. 2, and Supple-
mentary Table 1). We performed a series of behavioral tests in
these animals examining sensory responses to a range of
thermal and mechanical stimuli applied to the glabrous and hairy
skin. There were no differences in responses to evaporative
cooling evoked by acetone application (Fig. 3d, e), or in
thresholds to noxious heat (Fig. 3f, g) after diphtheria toxin

 ablation. Similarly, grip strength (Fig. 3h) was unaltered by
ablation
of
TrkBCreERT2
neurons,
as
were
responses
to
noxious pinprick (Fig. 3i), and static or punctate mechanical
stimulation of the hairy skin of the back (Fig. 3j, k). We
further examined responses to dynamic mechanical stimuli by
monitoring responses to brushing of the plantar surface of the
paw. Using a puffed out cotton swab which exerts forces in the
range 0.7–1.6 mN, we observed a significant reduction in
responsiveness upon ablation of TrkB-positive neurons (Fig. 3l).
Intriguingly, these differences were not apparent upon applica-
tion of stronger dynamic forces using a paint brush (>4 mN,
Fig. 4b). Thus, under basal conditions, TrkB-positive sensory
neurons are required for behavioral responses to the lightest of
mechanical stimuli.
TrkB neurons signal pain from light touch after nerve injury.
On account of the exquisite sensitivity of TrkB-positive neurons,
we
next
asked
whether
they
contribute
to
mechanical
hypersensitivity in models of injury-induced pain. We took both a
loss-of-function approach using genetic ablation, and a gain-of-
function approach using optogenetic activation of TrkB neurons.
We first considered a model of inflammatory pain by injecting
complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into the plantar surface of the
paw, and monitoring responses to von Frey filaments and
dynamic brush or cotton swab stimuli (Fig. 4a). Ablation of TrkB
neurons in TrkBCreERT2::AviliDTR mice had no effect on any of
these measures of mechanical hypersensitivity after inflammation
(Fig. 4b–d). We next induced neuropathic pain in mice using the
spared nerve injury (SNI) model (Fig. 4f). Control mice devel-
oped a profound mechanical and cold hypersensitivity in the
sural nerve territory of the paw (Fig. 4g–i and Supplementary
Fig. 4). Strikingly, upon ablation of TrkBCreERT2::AviliDTR sensory
neurons, mice did not develop mechanical allodynia to either
punctate or brushing stimuli (Fig. 4g–i), while response to cold
stimuli was unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 4). We further
examined whether optogenetic activation of TrkB neurons could
evoke pain behavior. Using photo-stimulation parameters which

 evoked robust firing in the ex vivo skin nerve preparation, we
observed no discernible behavioral response to light application
to the paw either in basal conditions or after CFA-induced
inflammation in TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2 mice (Fig. 4e and
Supplementary Movie 1). Identical stimulation conditions applied
to the hairy skin of the ear auricle evoked a brief ear twitch in
TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2 mice (Supplementary Movie 2), likely
reflecting activation of the dense network of mechanoreceptors in
this structure24. We performed further experiments in mice with
the SNI model of neuropathic pain. Three days after injury we
observed that selective stimulation of TrkB neurons with light-
evoked nocifensive behavior. This was evident as a prolonged paw
withdrawal from the stimulation, lifting of the paw and licking of
the illuminated area (Fig. 4j and Supplementary Movie 3) that
continued for several minutes after light application. Such
behavior persisted throughout the 2 weeks' observation period
and was never observed in control mice (Fig. 4j). Thus, under
neuropathic pain conditions, TrkB sensory neurons are necessary
and sufficient to convey the light touch signal that evokes pain.
As a neuronal correlate of this apparent pain behavior, we
examined induction of the immediate early gene C-fos in the
dorsal horn of the spinal cord (Fig. 4k, l and Supplementary
Fig. 5A–B). In TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2 mice without injury,
optical stimulation evoked C-fos immunoreactivity primarily in
laminae III and IV of the spinal cord, the region where TrkB
neurons terminate (Fig. 4k, l). Upon nerve injury, however,
identical stimulation parameters induced C-fos staining in lamina
I of the dorsal horn (Fig. 4k, l), an area associated with
nociceptive processing. To determine whether this resulted from
aberrant sprouting of TrkB+ afferents into superficial laminae
after nerve lesion, we examined TrkB+ sensory input into the
spinal cord using TrkBCreERT2::AvilmCherry mice (Supplementary
Fig. 5C, D). We were unable to detect any difference in TrkB
distribution in mice with SNI, suggesting that de novo expression
of C-fos likely arises from plasticity within the interneuron
network of the dorsal horn3–5,25 and not from sprouting26,27 of
TrkB+ mechanoreceptors into the superficial dorsal horn.
Ligand-guided laser ablation TrkB+ sensory neurons. In light
of the clinical importance of mechanical allodynia in neuropathic
pain patients, we sought to develop a pharmacological strategy to
exploit the striking selectivity of TrkB to the peripheral neurons,
which provoke this pain state. We reasoned that BDNF, the
ligand for TrkB, may give access to these neurons and allow for
their manipulation in wild type, non-transgenic animals. To this
end we produced recombinant BDNF protein with an SNAP-tag
fused to its C terminus that would enable its chemical derivati-
zation. BDNFSNAP was labeled in vitro with fluorescent SNAP-
Surface 647 substrate and applied to HEK293T cells expressing
neurotrophin
receptors.

(Supplementary
Fig. 6A–C). We further tested whether BDNFSNAP would
recognize native TrkB receptors in DRG neurons. BDNFSNAP was
conjugated to Qdot 655 quantum dots and applied to dissociated
DRG from TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26RFP mice. We observed a >95%
overlap between BDNFSNAP- and TrkBCreERT2-positive cells
(Fig. 5a), indicating that recombinant BDNFSNAP is a highly
selective means of targeting TrkB neurons.
To manipulate TrkB neurons in vivo, we reasoned that
BDNFSNAP may allow for targeted photoablation of these
neurons through delivery of a photosensitizing agent28,29. We
synthesized a benzylguanine-modified derivative of the highly
potent near infrared photosensitizer IRDye®700DX phthalocya-
nine (IR700) and conjugated it in vitro to BDNFSNAP. In initial
experiments we applied BDNFSNAP-IR700 to HEK293T cells
expressing TrkB/p75 and assayed cell death following near infra-
red illumination. In cells expressing TrkB/p75, we observed
substantial cell death 24 h after brief illumination that was not
evident upon mock transfection or treatment with IR700 alone
(Supplementary Fig. 6D–F). We next sought to assess the
therapeutic potential of this approach by investigating the effects
of BDNFSNAP-IR700-mediated photoablation in wild-type mice
with neuropathic pain. Upon establishment of robust mechanical
allodynia 3 days after SNI, we injected a range of concentrations
of BDNFSNAP-IR700 into the ipsilateral paw of injured mice and
illuminated the skin with different light intensities (Fig. 5b).
Strikingly, we observed a concentration and illumination-
dependent rescue of both von Frey withdrawal thresholds (Fig. 5c)
and dynamic brush or cotton swab-evoked allodynia (Fig. 5d, e)
that persisted for more than 2 weeks after a single treatment
regime. We examined whether such pronounced effects were also
evident in other types of neuropathic pain. Indeed, in both the
streptozotocin model of painful diabetic neuropathy30, and the
paclitaxel model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain31,

 we observed a marked reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity that
peaked around 10 days post treatment and returned to injury
levels by day 20 (Fig. 5f, g). To determine the selectivity of this
approach, we further assessed the effects of BDNFSNAP-IR700-
mediated photoablation on behavioral responses under basal
conditions. We observed no deficits in sensitivity to cold, heat, or
pinprick upon treatment (Supplementary Fig. 7A–C). Responses
to cotton swab were also unaffected by photoablation (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7D), perhaps because the skin area that is stimulated
in this test (50 mm2) extends beyond the zone of illumination
(15–20 mm2).
Mechanism of BDNFSNAP-IR700-mediated ablation. Using a
TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26SNAPCaaX reporter mouse line28 to identify
TrkB-positive afferents, and a PGP9.5 antibody to label all fibers,
we examined the innervation density of hypersensitive skin over
the course of phototherapy. Prior to photoablation, we detected
TrkB-positive lanceolate endings around hair follicles (Fig. 6a)
and innervation of Meissner corpuscles in the plantar surface of
the paw (Supplementary Fig. 8D). At 7 days after photoablation
(13 days post-SNI) when behavioral reversal of mechanical
hypersensitivity was most pronounced, we observed selective loss
of TrkB fibers but persistent innervation by PGP9.5 fibers in hairy
and glabrous skin (Fig. 6b, f and Supplementary Fig. 8). Indeed,
many hair follicles displayed a complete loss of TrkB innervation
but still contained PGP9.5-positive circumferential and free nerve
endings demonstrating the remarkable specificity of ablation
(Supplementary Fig. 9). At 24 days post photoablation when

 mechanical hypersensitivity had reverted, TrkB-positive fibers
were again seen innervating their appropriate end organs in both
glabrous and hairy skin (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 8).
Importantly, we observed no apparent reduction in innervation of
control tissue injected with unconjugated IR700 and illuminated
(Figure Supplementary Fig. 9). We further investigated whether
loss of TrkBCreERT2 neurons was also evident at the level of the
cell soma by analyzing the number of TrkBCreERT2-positive
neurons in the DRG. We observed no difference in the propor-
tion of TrkB neurons 10 days after photoablation (Fig. 6d–f),
indicating that the loss of fibers likely reflects local retraction
from their peripheral targets.
TrkB is also expressed by other cells in the skin in addition to
sensory fibers32–35. We sought to identify these cell types and
determine whether they are lost upon photoablation and
contribute to the behavioral phenotype. TrkB was not detected
in Merkel cells, keratinocytes, or dendritic and dermal antigen-
presenting cells (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Fig. 6g, j), and
BDNFSNAP-IR700-mediated photoablation did not alter their
numbers in the skin (Fig. 6h, k, i, l). Expression of TrkB was
however evident in cells labeled with CD34, a marker of mast cells
and epithelial and endothelial progenitor cells (Fig. 6m). More-
over, photoablation significantly reduced the number of CD34-
positive cells in the skin (Fig. 6n–o).
To determine whether it is loss of CD34+ cells or TrkB+
afferents
which
influences
sensory
behavior,
we
injected
BDNFSNAP-IR700 into the sciatic nerve at mid-thigh level of
SNI mice and illuminated the nerve to ablate TrkB sensory fibers
but spare CD34 cells in the skin. We first examined histological
indicators at the site of injection. In control samples, TrkB+ fibers
were clearly visible in both longitudinal and cross sections of
nerve, whereas after illumination they were essentially eliminated
(Fig. 7a–d, g). Importantly we did not detect any CD34+ cells in
nerve samples, either before or after illumination (Fig. 7a–d).
Similarly, TrkB expression was also not evident in other non-
neuronal cell type in the sciatic nerve such as S100-positive
Schwann cells (Fig. 7e, f). Finally, we quantified the number of
DAPI-positive nuclei in nerve sections as a measure of non-
neuronal cell density. There was no overlap between DAPI and
TrkB expression (Fig. 7a, c, e–g) indicating that TrkB is restricted

 to neurons in the nerve; indeed, we observed an increase in
DAPI-positive nuclei after illumination, likely reflecting immune
cell infiltration upon photoablation. Collectively, these data
indicate that BDNF targeted photoablation selectively and
effectively eliminates TrkB-positive fibers.
We further explored the behavioral consequence of TrkB fiber
ablation in the sciatic
nerve.
In animals
which
received
BDNFSNAP-IR700 and illumination of the nerve, behavioral
responses to
cooling, heating,
and
pinprick were
normal
(Fig. 7h–j). However, sensitivity to cotton swab was significantly
reduced (Fig. 7k), paralleling the results using genetic ablation of
TrkB+ neurons. Finally, we investigated whether optogenetically
evoked pain behavior in TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2 mice with SNI
is also reduced by BDNFSNAP-IR700 nerve injection and
illumination. Upon photoablation of TrkB+ fibers in the sciatic
nerve we observed a significant reduction in light-driven
nocifensive behavior in TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2 mice (Fig. 4l).
Thus, TrkB+ sensory afferents, and not CD34+ cells in the skin,
likely underlie behavioral sensitivity to light touch under basal
conditions and after nerve lesion.
Discussion
Mechanical allodynia is a cardinal feature of neuropathic pain
that is challenging to treat and exerts a substantial societal bur-
den. Here we identify the first relay station in the neuronal
pathway that confers pain from gentle touch under neuropathic
pain states. We demonstrate that TrkB-positive sensory neurons
detect the lightest touch under basal conditions, but after nerve
injury are both necessary and sufficient to drive mechanical
allodynia. We further describe new technology based upon
ligand-mediated delivery of a phototoxic agent to target these
neurons and reverse mechanical hypersensitivity in neuropathic
pain states.
Our work on the identity of TrkB-positive sensory neurons
builds upon previous studies that have reported that TrkB is

 expressed in two populations of myelinated mechanoreceptors
that are differentiated by co-expression of Ret, and form long-
itudinal lanceolate endings around hair follicles18,19,36,37. We
demonstrate that TrkB+ afferents also innervate Meissner’s cor-
puscles in the glabrous skin, and that TrkB marks essentially all
Aδ-LTMR’s (also known as D-hairs) and RA Aβ−LTMR’s, but
no other cutaneous sensory neuron subtype, establishing the
TrkBCreERT2 mouse line as a powerful tool for investigating the
function of these neurons in vivo. Moreover, our histological
analysis of human tissue indicates that DRG neurons and skin
biopsies of human subjects have comparable molecular profiles to
mice, suggesting that TrkB+ neurons in humans may also form
LTMRs.
To explore the role of Aδ-LTMR’s and RA Aβ−LTMR’s in
sensory evoked behavior, we took both a loss-of-function
approach
using
genetic
ablation,
and
a
gain-of-function
approach using optogenetic activation of TrkB+ neurons. We
found that TrkB+ neurons were required for a behavioral
response to the gentlest of dynamic touches, but that their abla-
tion had no influence on responses evoked by thermal or stronger
static mechanical stimuli. Similarly, blue-light stimulation of the
nape of the neck or the border of the ear in TrkBCreERT2::
Rosa26ChR2 mice elicited a flicking of the ears or the head
(Supplementary Movie 2) that was different from previously
described wiping or itching in response to pain38. It was shown as
early as the 1940s that the slightest movement provoked by a
cotton bristle is enough to activate D-hairs, and that this may
represent sensations of tickle or gentle blowing of air39. It is
intriguing to speculate that optogenetic activation of TrkB+
neurons in the ear may elicit a similar sensation.
Previously, TrkB+ D-hairs have been shown to specifically
innervate hair follicles in a direction-dependent manner and
respond to movement of hair in the caudal-to-rostral direction,
suggesting that they may be important for tactile determination of
direction18,40. We did not determine whether mice had deficits in
orientating toward a moving mechanical stimulus in the absence
of TrkB+ neurons. However, the ablation approach described
here would be valuable for investigating the contribution of these
neurons toward orientation. In the same light, development of
more intricate tests to measure gentle tactile stimulation of the
skin will help better understand the behavioral consequences of
stimuli transduced by TrkB+ neurons.
We further reasoned that manipulation of TrkB+ neurons
through loss- and gain-of-function experiments would also allow
us to identify the peripheral neuron type which inputs mechanical
hypersensitivity into the spinal cord. Both nociceptors and
LTMRs have been implicated in mechanical allodynia but con-
sensus on the sufficiency and necessity of a specific subpopulation
of neurons that conveys this sensation is lacking10–12,14–16,41. We
found that TrkB+ LTMRs were required for hypersensitivity to
both punctate and dynamic mechanical stimuli after nerve injury,
and that optogenetic activation of TrkB+ neurons was sufficient
to evoke strong nocifensive behavior. Importantly, we also
determined that in the CFA model of inflammatory pain, TrkB+
neurons were dispensable for mechanical hypersensitivity. Thus,
mechanical pain arising from neuropathy or tissue inflammation
is likely mechanistically different and should therefore be treated
as a distinct clinical entity. Of note, the neurons marked in the
TrkBCreERT2 line do not express C-fiber markers such as IB4,
CGRP, and Vglut3, but overlap with markers of A-fibers, all of
which have previously been implicated in mechanical allody-
nia10–12, 14–16, 41. A future challenge will be to determine whether
mechanical hypersensitivity is conveyed by only Aδ-LTMR’s or
RA Aβ−LTMR’s fibers, or whether both afferent types are
required.
We did not explore in detail the mechanistic basis of how TrkB
+ neurons provoke mechanical allodynia after nerve injury,
focusing instead on developing a potentially translatable tool for
its treatment. However, our data do give some insights into events
in the spinal cord post-injury. For example, using a TrkBCreERT2::
AvilmCherry mouse line to label TrkB+ afferent projections into
the dorsal horn, we detected no gross differences in their termi-
nation pattern after nerve injury, arguing against sprouting of
LTMR’s from lamina III/IV into lamina II26. We did however
observe c-fos labeling in lamina I evoked by optogenetic activa-
tion of TrkB+ afferents in the hindpaw of injured mice, indicating
that LTMRs do indeed gain access to pain transmitting neurons
in lamina I following nerve injury. Recent evidence suggests that
this may arise both through altered gene expression in TrkB
neurons16 and through a defect in the feed-forward inhibition of
interneurons within laminae III/IV3,5,6,42. The TrkBCreERT2 line
and tools described here will allow for further investigations into
these mechanisms.
Current clinical options for reducing neuropathic pain include
opioids (like morphine and oxycodone), anti-epileptics such as
gabapentin, and tricyclic antidepressants43–45. These drugs have
limited effectiveness, serious safety issues, and long-term use can
lead to addiction46. Cutaneous receptors in the skin represent an
attractive target for novel analgesics, however many potential
therapies under development, such as anti-NGF antibodies, and
sodium channel blockers are geared toward blocking the function
of nociceptors. Our data indicate that LTMRs would be a more
appropriate target for alleviating mechanical allodynia, and
indeed
small-molecule
inhibitors
that
silence
mechan-
oreceptors47, or inhibit electrical activity in Aβ-LTMRs15 have
been shown to be effective at reducing mechanical allodynia in
mouse models. Our approach takes this further by utilizing the
TrkB ligand BDNF to deliver a photosensitizer directly to TrkB+
neurons, selectively targeting those neurons which initiate
mechanical allodynia. We show that this leads to long-term
reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity across models of trau-
matic, diabetic, and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, with
minimal effects on other sensory modalities.
Application of BDNFSNAP-IR700 to the skin and subsequent
illumination led to the local retraction of TrkB+ neurons from
their end organs, followed by a re-innervation of appropriate
targets 3 weeks later that paralleled the return of mechanical
allodynia. This was a remarkably selective process, as illustrated
by the continued presence of circumferential endings around hair
follicles (likely TrkC/Ret-positive field receptors48), and free
nerve endings in the epidermis. Indeed, it is feasible that ligand-
targeted photoablation could also be applied to other subtypes of
sensory neurons using different ligands to inhibit other sensa-
tions. Beyond the therapeutic potential of such an approach, this
may also have value as an experimental tool for exploring the
consequences of subtype-specific nerve ablation and the events
that lead to regeneration.

expressing cells in the skin and their contribution to allodynia.
For example, it has been demonstrated that optogenetic activation
of keratinocytes can trigger action potentials in some populations
of cutaneous sensory neurons (but not Aδ-LTMRs or RA Aβ
−LTMRs) and initiate nociceptive behavior49. While we detected
no expression of TrkB in keratinocytes, Merkel cells or dendritic
cells in the skin, TrkB was observed in mast cells and epithelial
and endothelial progenitor cells marked by CD34. Moreover,
photoablation reduced the number of CD34+ cells in the skin in
addition to TrkB+ fibers. To determine which of these cell types
underlies the behavioral phenotype, we performed photoablation
on the sciatic nerve. Importantly, CD34+ cells were not evident in

 the nerve, and photoablation of the nerve produced a phenotype
similar to our skin injections, suggesting that CD34+ skin cells
are not responsible. TrkB has also been reported to be expressed
by Schwann cells in the nerve50; however, we were unable to
detect overlap of TrkB with the Schwann cell marker S100.
Further experiments using a transectional approach to limit ChR2
expression to TrkB fibers, or a triple transgenic TrkBCreERT2::
AviliDTR::Rosa26ChR2-YFP mouse line with which to perform
optogenetic activation in the absence of TrkB+ fibers, would
further clarify the role of afferent fibers versus other cell types in
mediating mechanical allodynia. Moreover, investigation of the
role of non-neuronal TrkB+ cells in mediating allodynia would be
required for therapeutic development of BDNFSNAP-IR700-
mediated ablation.
In summary, here we identify the peripheral neuronal substrate
that confers pain from gentle touch under neuropathic pain
states. We demonstrate that TrkB marks a population of sensory
neurons that normally detect the lightest touch but drive
mechanical hypersensitivity after nerve injury. We further
describe new technology based upon a phototoxic derivative of
BDNF to target these neurons and reverse allodynia in multiple
types of neuropathic pain. This approach is analogous to clini-
cally approved capsaicin patches, in which a high concentration
of capsaicin is applied to the skin and leads to retraction of
nociceptive fibers51. Instead, here we target directly the neurons
responsible for mechanical allodynia, allowing for local, on-
demand treatment of pain through application of light. Further
use of this technology and of the genetic tools developed here to
manipulate TrkB neurons will now allow precise characterization
of the central circuits that gate mechanical pain and transform a
normally innocuous sensation into a noxious one.
Methods
Animals. A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the TrkB mouse
locus was obtained from Source Bioscience (RP23-391J8). Individual BAC clones
were screened and electroporated with a plasmid conferring competence for
lambda RedET-mediated recombineering. A cassette containing a modified
CreERT2-pA-Frt-Ampicillin-Frt was inserted in the ATG of trkB, deleting the
entire coding region of exon 2 by homologous recombination using the primers:
homology to CreERT2: gacgcctggctcagcgtaggga-
cacgcactccgactgactggcactggcagctcgggatgtccaatttactga and homology to FAF:
cccaaacatacacctgcctgattcctgaggtggggacaggagaaaaagtaaaaggaactcacgccc tgata-
gacggtttttcgccctttgacgttgg. Clonal identity was confirmed by PCR and full-length
sequencing of the inserted cassette and the ampicillin cassette was removed using
bacterial Flp. Purified BAC DNA was dissolved into endotoxin-free TE and injected
into pronuclei derived from the hybrid B6D2F1/N strain (Charles River Labora-
tories) or prepared for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Both methods were
successful and produced offspring. To determine the genotype of the mouse, PCR
was performed using the following primers: gcactgatttcgaccaggtt (fwd) and gagt-
catccttagcgccgta (rev), yielding products of 408 bp.
An AvilhM3Dq-mCherry line was obtained by a knock-in of a Lox-STOP-Lox-
hM3Dq-mCherry cassette into the Advilin locus, to replace exon 2 and 66 bp
upstream. The targeting construct was transfected into A9 ESCs. Individual ESC
clones were screened to identify homologous recombinantion. Southern blot was
performed as described previously22. DNA was digested with PstI and HindIII and
hybridized with 5′ or 3′ probe, respectively. We obtained 9600 bp (wild type) and
6300 bp (targeted) DNA fragments by using the 5′ probe and 7100 bp (wild type)
and 6100 bp (targeted) DNA fragments by using the 3′ probe. Positive clones were
injected into 8-cell-stage embryos to generate heterozygous mice for the targeted
allele. To determine the genotype, PCR were performed using the following primer
pairs: gccccgtaatgcagaagaag (fwd), gtgtagtcctcgttgtggga (rev).
For diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation, AviliDTR mice as described previously22
were crossed to TrkBCreERT2 to generate TrkBCreERT2::AviliDTR heterozygous mice.
Littermates lacking the Cre (referred to as AviliDTR) were used as controls. For
optogenetic activation using channelrhodopsin, TrkBCreERT2 were crossed to
Rosa26ChR2-YFP mice to generate TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2-YFP mice.
For efficient Cre recombination, adult TrkBCreERT2 mice (6–8 weeks of age)
were injected i.p. with 75 mg/kg of body weight of Tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich,
T5648) in sunflower seed oil (Sigma-Aldrich, S5007) for 5 consecutive days. Mice
were then used for experiments 1–2 weeks after the final tamoxifen injection. All
behavioral experiments were performed on male mice. Tissue for histological
analysis was taken from male and female mice.
Mice were housed in the Epigenetics and Neurobiology unit, EMBL Rome
according to the Italian legislation (Art. 9, 27. Jan 1992, no 116) and experiments
were performed under license from the Italian Ministry of Health, and in
compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines.
Immunofluorescence. DRG and spinal cord were dissected from adult mice and
fixed with 4% PFA for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were embedded in 12%
bovine gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich, G9391) and sectioned at 50 µm and 100 µm,
respectively. Sections were then treated with cold 50% ethanol for 30 min and
incubated with blocking solution containing 5% serum (goat or donkey) and 0.3%
Triton-X in PBS for 30 min and subsequently with primary antibodies in blocking
solution overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies were added in blocking solution
for 1–2 h and the slides were mounted with prolong gold (Invitrogen, P36930).
For SNAP-tag labeling of the skin, 10 µM of Snap Cell TMR-Star (New England
Bioloabs, S9105S) was injected intradermally into the back skin and into the paw of
TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26SNAPCaaX mice28. The skin was dissected after 6 h and
cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were then embedded in
Tissue-Tek O.C.T compound. Forty micrometer thick sections were cut using a
cryostat (Leica, CM3050S) and stained with one or more antibodies listed below.
We used K14 antibodies to identify keratinocytes52, MHC-II antibodies for
dendritic and antigen-presenting cells53,54, and CD34 for mast cells55,56,
endothelial and epithelial progenitor cells. For assessing the effect of photoablation
using BDNFSNAP, skin from TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26SNAPCaaX mice were used and
processed as described above.
For human DRG/skin staining, 20 µm sections of snap frozen tissues were cut,
dried, post fixed with 4% PFA and immunostained as mentioned above. Primary
and secondary antibodies were incubated in a solution containing 2% BSA (wt/vol)
and 0.01% Tween-20 in PBS. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-RFP (Rockland, 600-
401-379), 1:200, mouse anti-NF200 (Sigma-Aldrich, N0142) 1:500, mouse anti-
CGRP (Rockland, 200-301-D15) 1:500, isolectin GS-B4-biotin XX conjugate
(Invitrogen I21414) 1:100, rabbit anti-TH, (Millipore, AB152), 1:1000, rabbit anti-

(Biolegend 107607) 1:100, CD34-Biotin conjugate (ThermoFisher 13-0341-82)
1:200. All Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:1000
concentration and streptavidin-conjugated antibodies were used at 1:600
concentration. All images were taken with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope and
analyzed in ImageJ.
In situ hybridization. DRGs were dissected from TrkBCreERT2 mice and post fixed
overnight in 4% PFA at 4 °C and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution overnight
at 4 °C. Tissues were then embedded in tissue Tek O.C.T compound and 10 mm
sections were cut using a cryostat. In situ hybridization was performed using a
riboprobe generated from a cDNA template57. Briefly, sections were digested with
proteinase K for 6 min, acetylated, and hybridized with the either antisense or sense
probes in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt’s solution, 500 µg/ml salmon
sperm DNA and 250 µg/ml tRNA overnight at 56 °C. After post hybridization,
washes were done with 50% formamide, 2× SSC, then 0.5× SSC at 56 °C, and with
2× SSC at ambient temperature, sections were blocked and incubated overnight
with anti-digoxigenin-AP (Roche; at 1:1000). Signal detection was done using
NBT/BCIP substrate.
Ex vivo skin nerve preparation. The skin nerve preparation was performed on
8–16 weeks old mice killed with CO2 followed by cervical dislocation. After dis-
section, the hairy and glabrous skin of the hind limb was placed corium side up
with the sural nerve attached in the bath chamber. During the recording, the skin
was bathed with 32 °C-warm synthetic interstitial fluid (SIF buffer in mM 108
NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 0.7 mM MgSO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.7 mM NaH2PO4, 1.5 mM
CaCl2, 9.5 mM sodium gluconate, 5.5 mM glucose, and 7.5 mM sucrose at a pH of
7.4). The sural nerve was teased into thin bundles and laid on the recording
electrode connected to the neurolog extracellular recording amplifier (Digitimer,
modules NL104, NL125/NL126). Single fiber units were located by mechanically
stimulating different regions of the skin using brush and punctate stimuli. Data
were recorded with the Powerlab 2 4SP system and Labchart 7.1 software (AD
Instruments) and then the units were classified according to their conduction
velocity, von Frey hair thresholds, and adaptation properties to suprathreshold
stimuli. Further characterization with ramp-and-hold mechanical stimulation was
achieved with a computer-controlled nanomotor (Kleindieck), which allowed for
simultaneous recording of electrophysiological and stimulation data. For light
stimulation of ChR2-expressing fibers, blue-light pulses from a 470 nm laser were
focused on discrete spots by coupling the light guide (FG910UEC, Thorlabs) to a
×20 microscope objective using a custom-made adapter. The different light-pulse
durations and frequencies were generated by the built-in stimulator function of
LabChart 7.1 and simultaneously recorded. The light intensities were assessed with
a powermeter (PM100D, Thorlabs).

 Diphtheria toxin injection. TrkBCreERT2::AviliDTR mice were injected i.p. with 40
μg/kg of diphtheria toxin (Sigma, D0564) twice with a gap of 72 h between the two
injections. Behavioral tests were performed 2 weeks after the final DTX injection to
avoid potential effects of inflammation. All mice received diphtheria toxin
injections.
Behavioral testing. All behavior experiments were performed on adult male mice
(>8–10 weeks of age). For controls, littermates without the Cre were used. The
experimenter was always blind to the genotype of the mice.
For testing the effect of evaporative cooling, an acetone drop test was
performed. Mice were habituated for 30 min on an elevated platform with mesh
flooring. A single drop of cold acetone was sprayed onto to the dorsal or the plantar
side of the hindpaw of mice using a syringe without touching the paw of the
mice58. The behavioral responses were scored according to the following scheme: 0
= no response, 1 = paw withdrawal or a single flick, 2 = repeated flicking of the
paw and 3 = licking of the paw. The test was repeated five times by alternating the
paw and mice between trials.
To measure heat nociception, mice were placed on top of a hot plate (Ugo
Basile, 35150) that was preset to 52 °C and the latency to response as distinguished
by flicking or licking of the hindpaw was noted. In order to avoid injury to the
mice, a cutoff of 30 s was set.
The latency to respond to heat was measured by focusing thermal heat onto the
plantar side of the paw or the tail of the mice using a modified Hargreaves
apparatus. In order to avoid injury, a cutoff of 15 s was set.
The grip strength test was performed to test the ability of mice to grip a metal
grid (Bioseb; BIO-GS3). The mice were placed on a metal grid with all four paws
touching the grid. The tail of the mice was gently pulled and the force at which the
mice first let go of the grid was measured. The test was repeated five times with a
30 s interval between trials.
The plantar side of the hindpaw was gently touched using an insect pin glued
onto a 1 g von Frey filament without penetrating the skin and the responses were
noted for 10 trials with an interval of 1 min between the trials.
Mice were habituated to a plexiglass chamber for 15 min. A 3 cm × 1 cm piece of
adhesive tape (Identi tape) was applied along the back of the mice. Responses were
quantified as an attempt to remove the tape by shaking, scratching, or biting of the
tape over a 5 min period59.
Mice were placed on an elevated platform with a mesh floor and habituated for
30 min. A cotton swab was “puffed-out” to about three times its original size. The
hindpaw of mice was then brushed using this cotton swab in the heel-to-toe
direction and the frequency of responses were noted60. The trials were repeated 10
times alternating between paws with an interval of 1 min between trials.
For the von Frey test, mice were habituated on an elevated platform with a mesh
floor for 30 min. The plantar side of the hindpaw was stimulated with calibrated
von Frey filaments (North coast medical, NC12775-99). The 50% paw withdrawal
thresholds were calculated using the Up-Down method61. Post SNI, von Frey
testing was confined to the sural nerve innervating region of the paw.
The nape of the neck was shaved and stimulated with a 0.07 g von Frey hair, 10
times with an interval of 1 min between stimulation. Frequency of responses as
visualized by flicking of the head was measured.
To measure dynamic allodynia, the plantar hindpaw was stimulated by stroking
using a paint brush in the heel-to-toe direction. The responses were scored as
described by Duan et al.3. For each test under baseline conditions, 0 = no response,
1 = paw withdrawal, 2 = flicking of the paw, and 3 = licking of the paw. After
injury responses were quantified: 0 = brief withdrawal, 1 = prolonged paw
withdrawal toward the body, 2 = repeated flicking or flinching of the affected leg,
and 3 = licking of the paw.
Mouse pain models. The spared nerve injury (SNI) was performed as described by
Pertin et al.62. Adult mice were anesthetized using 2.5% isoflurane. The sciatic
nerve near the thigh region was exposed; the common peroneal and tibial nerves
were ligated and cut, leaving the sural nerve intact. Behavioral testing was per-
formed starting from 3 days after injury. Sham controls underwent exposure of the
thigh region without any damage to the nerve.
For the CFA model of pain, 20 μl of CFA (Sigma-Aldrich, F5881) was injected
into the hindpaw of mice. Behavioral tests were performed 24 and 48 h after
inflammation. Ten percent saline injections were used as sham controls
To mimic chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, wild-type C57BL6 mice
were injected with 1 mg/kg of paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich, T7191) intraperitoneally
for 4 alternate days63. Mechanical thresholds were assayed 1 week after the final
injection.
To induce diabetic neuropathy, wild-type C57BL6 mice were injected
systemically with 180 mg/kg of Streptozotocin (STZ, Sigma-Aldrich S0130) in 0.05
M citrate buffer (pH 4.5). This led to the development of diabetes within 3 days of
administration64. The blood–glucose levels were monitored frequently using
ACCU-CHEK glucose sticks (Aviva). Mice with blood–glucose levels greater than
350 mg/dl were considered diabetic. The blood–glucose levels were maintained
between 350 and 400 mg/dl by administration of insulin (Caninsulin 40 U/ml MSD
animal health). Four weeks after the onset of diabetes, mice developed mechanical
hypersensitivity. Behavior experiments to test allodynia were carried out as
described earlier.
Light activation using channelrhodopsin. Optogenetic stimulation of the paw
was performed using 473 nm Blue DPSS laser (SLOC CO., Ltd; BL473T8) coupled
to a powerlab source (Powerlab 4SP) to generate light pulses. Five–10 ms pulses of
blue light of (15 Hz) were applied onto the plantar hindpaw of mice using an
0.93NA optic fiber cable (SLOC CO., Ltd; FC-200-10-PC). Paw withdrawal to light
application was considered as a positive response. In all experiments, ipsilateral and
contralateral paws of TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2-YFP were tested along with litter-
mate controls (referred to as Rosa26ChR2-YFP).
C-fos labeling. For c-fos labeling of the spinal cord, TrkBCreERT2::Rosa26ChR2 mice
were exposed to optogenetic stimulation of the injured (ipsilateral) and con-
tralateral paw with a 15 Hz laser for 1 min. Mice were then killed and the lumbar
spinal cord was removed and fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were
then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T compound.
Forty micrometer sections of the spinal cord were cut using a cryostat and stained
for antibody against c-fos following the protocol described above.
Production of recombinant BDNFSNAP. cDNAs encoding for the murine BDNF
and SNAP proteins including a C-terminal poly-Histidine Tag (His6) inserted for
purification purposes were cloned into the pMP-PB vector as a fusion protein65.
Protein expression was carried out using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells
(ATCC, mycoplasma negative) as described by Balasubramanian et al.66. Secreted
BDNF-SNAP was purified from cell medium using a Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen,
#30210) and eluted with an excess of imidazole. Eluted fractions were then pooled,
concentrated, and stored for further analysis.
Synthesis of BG-IR700. Aliquot of 3 mg of IRDye700DX N-hydroxysuccinimide
ester fluorophore (LI-COR Biosciences GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany) was
dissolved in 150 μl DMSO and treated with 1.5 mg BG-PEG11-NH2 and 5 μl dii-
sopropylethylamine. After 1 h, the product BG-PEG11-IRDye700DX was purified
by HPLC using a Waters Sunfire Prep C18 OBD 5 µM; 19 × 150 mm column using
0.1 M triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) (pH 7.0) and 0.1 M TEAA in water/
acetonitrile 3:7 (pH 7.0) as mobile phases A and B, respectively. A linear gradient
from 100% A to 100% B within 30 min was used. The fractions containing the
product were lyophilized67.
In vitro labeling of BDNF-SNAP. HEK293T cells (ATCC, mycoplasma negative)
were transfected with a combination of 0.125 µg trkB/trkA/trkC in pcDNA plasmid
and 0.125 µg p75NTR (all gifts from Moses Chao, Addgene plasmid #24088,
#24089, #24093, and #24091, respectively) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
11668-019) in a medium containing DMEM (Gibco, 41966-029), 10% FBS, 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. Before labeling, cells were incubated in serum-free med-
ium for 1 h. Aliquot of 0.1 µM BDNFSNAP was coupled to 0.3 µM of SNAP-surface
647 (New England Biolabs, S9136S) for 1 h at 37 °C and applied onto cells for 15
min at 4 °C and imaged using a Zeiss AxioObserver A1 microscope.
DRG from TrkBCreERT2::RFP mice was collected in PBS and incubated in 1 mg/
ml collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich, C5138) and 0.05% Trypsin (Gibco, 25300-054)
for 25 min each at 37 °C. Cells were filtered and suspended in medium containing
DMEM (Gibco, 41966-029), 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (PAA,
A15101), 0.8% glucose, and 100 U of penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, 15140-122).
Cells were plated on glass coverslips treated with poly-L-lysine and stored at 37 °C.
An equimolar concentration of BDNFSNAP was coupled to a mixture of SNAP-
Biotin (New England Biolabs, S9110S) and QD655 quantum dots (Invitrogen,
Q10121MP) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were labeled with the above mixture for 5
min and imaged using a Zeiss AxioObserver A1 microscope.
In vitro photoablation. HEK293T cells transfected with TrkB (as described above)
were incubated with a mixture of 1 µM BDNFSNAP and 3 µM BG-IR700 for 30 min
at 37 °C. Cells were then exposed to near infra-red light (680 nm) illuminated at 40
J/cm2 for 2 min. Twenty-four hours after light exposure, cells were stained with
propidium iodide (eBioscience; 00-6990-50) to assess cellular apoptosis. Controls
used were non-transfected cells with BDNFSNAP-IR700 and transfected cells with
IR700 alone.
In vivo photoablation. The left hindpaw of C57BL6 mice was injected with dif-
ferent concentrations of BDNFSNAP coupled to BG-IR700 (1:3). Fifteen–twenty
minutes after the injections, near infra-red light (680 nm) at 120–150 J/cm2 or at
550–600 J/cm2 was applied onto the paw of the mice for 4–15 min. This procedure
was repeated for 3 consecutive days. Behavioral tests were performed 1 day after
the final treatment. For rescue experiments, photoablation was performed fol-
lowing robust development of neuropathic pain as mentioned above. For the
in vivo photoablation of the sciatic nerve, the nerve was first exposed at the mid-
thigh level; 5 µM BDNFSNAP coupled to BG-IR700 (1:3) was injected directly into
the nerve. Ten minutes after the injection, near infra-red light (680 nm) at 200 J/
cm2 was applied onto the nerve for 45 s.
Quantification of cell types in skin. To quantify PGP9.5-positive free nerves in
the skin, individual intra-epidermal fibers were identified and the number of fibers

 per section of skin was counted. Similarly, total number of K14 and MHC-II-
positive cells was identified using DAPI labeling of nuclei. For CD34, number of
TrkB/CD34-positive cells was quantified over an area of 1 mm2.
Statistical analysis. All statistical data are presented as standard error of the mean
(SEM) along with the number of samples analyzed (n). Student’s t-test and/or two-
way repeated measures ANOVA were used and p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Sample sizes were determined from the power of the statistical test
performed. No animals were excluded and all experiments were performed blinded
with order of testing randomized.
Data availability. The data that support the findings of this study are available
