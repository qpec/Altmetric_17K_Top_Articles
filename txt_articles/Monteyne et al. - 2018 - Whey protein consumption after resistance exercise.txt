observed for subjective measures of appetite. The PRO 
drink was perceived as creamier and thicker, and less pleas-
ant, sweet and refreshing (P < 0.05).
Conclusion These results suggest whey protein consump-
tion after resistance exercise reduces subsequent energy 
intake, and this might be partially mediated by a reduced 
eating rate. Whilst this reduced energy intake is unlikely 
to impair hypertrophy, it may be of value in supporting an 
energy deficit for weight loss.

Introduction
Muscle hypertrophy is highly desirable to a wide range 
of populations, ranging from those seeking optimal ath-
letic performance, to those seeking to maintain functional 
capacity for health. Concurrently, resistance exercise is also 
recommended as part of a holistic model for weight man-
agement [1]. Resistance exercise and post-exercise protein 
feeding synergistically potentiate muscle protein synthe-
sis, orchestrating muscle fibre hypertrophy [2]. At least 
in young, resistance-trained men, whey protein has been 
shown to stimulate muscle protein synthesis to a greater 
extent than other proteins when doses of 20–25 g protein 
are ingested [3], with this amount of whey protein being 
sufficient to maximise this response after lower limb resist-
ance exercise [4].
Protein has been suggested to be the most satiating 
macronutrient, and protein feeding at rest has been shown 
to reduce subsequent energy intake compared to other 
macronutrients [5], and protein-containing drinks have 
Abstract 
Purpose Protein consumption after resistance exercise 
potentiates muscle protein synthesis, but its effects on sub-
sequent appetite in this context are unknown. This study 
examined appetite and energy intake following consump-
tion of protein- and carbohydrate-containing drinks after 
resistance exercise.
Methods After familiarisation, 15 resistance training 
males (age 21 ± 1 years, body mass 78.0 ± 11.9 kg, stat-
ure 1.78 ± 0.07 m) completed two randomised, double-
blind trials, consisting of lower-body resistance exer-
cise, followed by consumption of a whey protein (PRO 
23.9 ± 3.6 g protein) or dextrose (CHO 26.5 ± 3.8 g car-
bohydrate) drink in the 5 min post-exercise. An ad libitum 
meal was served 60 min later, with subjective appetite 
measured throughout. Drinks were flavoured and matched 
for energy content and volume. The PRO drink provided 
0.3 g/kg body mass protein.
Results Ad libitum energy intake (PRO 3742 ± 994 kJ; 
CHO 4172 ± 1132 kJ; P = 0.007) and mean eating 
rate (PRO 339 ± 102 kJ/min; CHO 405 ± 154 kJ/min; 
P = 0.009) were lower during PRO. The change in eat-
ing rate was associated with the change in energy intake 
(R = 0.661, P = 0.007). No interaction effects were

been shown to attenuate energy intake at a subsequent 
meal in a dose-dependent manner [6]. Therefore, if post-
exercise protein intake reduces subsequent energy intake 
sufficiently, this might reduce the anabolic response to sub-
sequent protein intake, which is potentiated for some time 
after exercise [7].
Whilst resistance exercise in isolation has been shown 
to alter appetite regulation, to date, very few studies have 
considered the interaction of exercise and post-exercise 
nutrition on subsequent appetite and energy intake. This is 
particularly important for resistance exercise where post-
exercise protein intake is recommended to maximise the 
anabolic response [2]. When consumed after aerobic exer-
cise, Clayton et al. [8] observed no significant difference 
in subsequent energy intake between energy-matched whey 
protein and carbohydrate drinks. It is feasible, however, 
that resistance exercise may interact with liquid protein to 
elicit a dissimilar response to aerobic exercise; a premise 
that has yet to be investigated.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare 
drinks containing dextrose (i.e. carbohydrate) and whey 
protein consumed after resistance exercise on subsequent 
appetite and energy intake. It was hypothesised that the 
whey protein drink would suppress appetite and reduce 
energy intake relative to the carbohydrate drink.
Methods
Subjects
After approval by the Loughborough University Eth-
ics Approvals (Human Participants) Sub-Committee, 15 
physically active, healthy males, who included resist-
ance exercise in their exercise routine (age 21 ± 1 years, 
body mass 78 ± 11.9 kg, stature 1.78 ± 0.07 m, BMI 
24.6 ± 2.6 kg m−2) provided consent and completed this 
study. Subjects were not restrained, disinhibited or hungry 
eaters [9]. Subjects performed a familiarisation trial and 
two experimental trials, with the experimental trials being 
administered in a randomised double-blind manner and 
separated by ≥5 days. Using previous data from our labo-
ratory for the main outcome variable (i.e. ad libitum energy 
intake), an a priori sample size calculation with statistical 
power of 0.95 and α of 0.05 estimated 15 subjects would 
be required to reject the null hypothesis if there was a mean 
difference of 400 kJ between trials.
Familiarisation trial
Subject’s stature and mass were recorded and skinfold 
measurements were made at four sites (biceps, triceps, 
subscapular and suprailiac) to estimate body fat using the 
Siri equation [10]. Subjects then completed a 5-min warm-
up on a friction-braked cycle ergometer (Monark828E, 
Varberg, Sweden), at a standardised work rate (1.5–2 W/
kg body mass). One repetition maximum (1RM) was 
then determined for unilateral leg extension and leg flex-
ion (Technogym Element + Leg Extension and Leg Curl, 
Technogym U.K. Ltd, Berkshire, UK). A successful repeti-
tion was judged by subjects producing an acceptably full 
range of motion. Subjects rested as required between 1RM 
attempts. Subjects then completed two sets of 10 reps at 
70% of 1RM (Table 1) to familiarise them with the resist-
ance training protocol used in the experimental trials, after 
which they were familiarised with the ad libitum pasta 
meal described later.
Pre‑trial standardisation
Subjects completed a food and activity diary in the 24 h 
preceding the first experimental trial and were asked to 
replicate this in the 24 h before their second trial. Atypi-
cal dietary habits, alcohol ingestion and strenuous physi-
cal activity were not permitted in this period. All subjects 
consumed a standardised breakfast two h before exercise 
commenced, providing 15% of estimated energy require-
ments (RMR [11] multiplied by a physical activity level of 
1.7) and 1 g/kg body mass of carbohydrate. The breakfast 
was consumed in the subject’s home and consisted of semi-
skimmed milk (Tesco, Cheshunt, UK) and Nutri-Grain bars 
(Kelloggs, Manchester, UK) in a ratio of 125-ml milk 30 g 
Nutri-Grain. Compliance with these pre-trial requirements 
was verbally confirmed prior to each trial.
Experimental trials
Participants arrived at the testing facility between 10:00 
and 11:00 (standardised within subjects), and post-void 
body mass in minimal clothing was measured. Subjects 
completed approximately 50 min of resistance exercise and 
then immediately ingested either a protein (PRO) or car-
bohydrate (CHO) drink. This was followed by a period of 
60-min rest in a comfortable environment. The ad libitum 
meal was served 65 min after the end of exercise, and sub-
jects were allowed 20 min in which to eat. Questionnaires 
assessing subjective appetite were collected at regular inter-
vals throughout, along with a drink characteristic question-
naire that was collected after post-exercise drink ingestion.
Resistance exercise
Subjects completed the standardised 5-min warm-up 
described for the familiarisation trial, followed by 2-min 
rest. Resistance exercise was unilateral extension of the 
right and left leg, followed by unilateral flexion of the 
 587

right and left leg. For each exercise on each leg subjects 
completed one warm-up set of 10 repetitions at 35% 1RM 
and four working sets of 10 reps at 70% 1RM. If subjects 
fatigued before they had completed four sets of 10 reps 
during the first experimental trial, they replicated this work 
in the second trial. In the second trial, all subjects were able 
to replicate work done from the first trial. Two minutes 
rest was allowed between each set. Subjects were provided 
with water ad libitum up until the start of the final exercise 
(i.e. left leg flexion) during the first trial, with this amount 
matched during the second trial.
Ad libitum meal
Subjects were seated in an eating booth to isolate them 
from external stimuli as much as possible. The test 
meal consisted of pasta (400 g dry-weight), Bolognese 
sauce (400 g), and olive oil (32 g) (Tesco, Cheshunt, 
UK). The meal was homogenous in nature and provided 
5.84 ± 0.04 kJ/g (12% protein, 69% carbohydrate, 19% 
fat). Subjects were initially provided with a portion con-
taining just over half of the total food prepared. A new por-
tion, containing the remainder of the prepared food, was 
provided part way through the protocol at a time specific to 
the subjects eating rate. This was to ensure that finishing a 
bowl did not act as a satiety cue. Subjects were instructed 
to “eat until comfortably full and satisfied”, at which point 
they moved from the eating booth to a chair inside the eat-
ing laboratory. A period of 20 min was allocated to eat the 
test meal and subjects remained in the eating laboratory 
for the entire time. The time spent eating was recorded and 
together with the total energy intake was used to determine 
the mean eating rate. Water was available ad libitum during 
the meal. The meal was served in two large pasta bowls and 
warmed before serving. All meals were subject to identical 
preparation, cooking, heating and serving protocols. Food 
and water intake were measured by weighing bowls and 
glasses before and after consumption, with energy intake 
quantified from manufacturer values.
Post‑exercise drink
Subjects were provided with a dextrose monohydrate 
drink (Myprotein, Manchester, UK) in the CHO trial, and 
a whey protein isolate drink (WPI90, Volac International 
Ltd., Orwell, UK) in the PRO trial. (Table 2) The protein 
drink provided 0.3 g protein/kg body mass, in line with 
current guidelines [2]. The carbohydrate drink was isoen-
ergetic in comparison with the protein drink, although a 
little over 0.3 g carbohydrate/kg body mass was provided 
due the small additional fat and lactose content of the whey 
protein isolate. Manufacturer values were used to deter-
mine the macronutrient and energy content of powders. 
The powder for each drink was assimilated in 400 ml of 
no added sugar orange squash (Tesco Stores Ltd., Ches-
hunt, UK) and the subjects consumed this 400 ml. An addi-
tional 100 ml squash was then added to the bottle, mixed 
with any remaining residue and consumed by the subjects. 
Subjects were given 5 min to consume the drink. The drink 
was served in an opaque sports bottle and was consumed 
through a sports cap to reduce sensory and textural cues. 
The drink was provided in a randomised, double-blind 
manner. Drinks were prepared on the same day as the trial, 
earlier that morning. Subjects were aware that the study 
was investigating the appetite effects of post-resistance 
exercise drink composition, but were unaware of the com-
position of drinks.
At the end of the study, subjects were told that the drinks 
consumed were a carbohydrate drink and a whey protein 
drink and were asked if they could identify which drink 
they had ingested on which trial.
Subjective appetite questionnaire
Subjects rated their perceptions of appetite via 100-mm 
visual analogue scales (VAS) [12]. Questions asked were 
related to hunger “How hungry do you feel?”; fullness 
“How full do you feel?”; desire to eat (DTE) “How strong 
is your desire to eat?” and prospective food consumption 
(PFC) “How much food do you think you could eat?”, 
with verbal anchors “not at all”/“none at all” at 0 mm 
and “extremely”/“a lot” at 100 mm. Subjects completed 
this questionnaire pre-exercise, post-exercise, post-drink, 
15 min post-drink, 30 min post-drink, 45 min post-drink, 
60 min post-drink and at the end of the test meal. Total area 
under the curve (AUC) values were calculated for subjec-
tive appetite responses in the period between drink con-
sumption and the ad libitum meal (i.e. post-drink to 60 min 
post-drink).
Drink characteristics questionnaire
Additional 100-mm VAS questions were assessed immedi-
ately after drink consumption. Questions asked were “How 
pleasant was the drink?”, “How much aftertaste did the 
drink have?”, “How salty was the drink?”, “How bitter was 
the drink?”, “How sweet was the drink?”, “How creamy 
was the drink?”, “How thick was the drink?”, “How sticky 
was the drink?”, “How fruity was the drink?” and “How 
refreshing was the drink?”. Verbal anchors “not at all” and 
“extremely/extreme” were placed at 0 mm and 100 mm, 
respectively.

Data analysis
Data were analysed using SPSS 22 (SPSS Inc., Somers, 
NY, USA). All data were examined for normality of distri-
bution using a Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally distributed data 
containing one factor were analysed using paired samples 
t tests, and non-normally distributed data containing one 
factor were analysed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. 
Data containing two factors were analysed using a two-
way repeated measures ANOVA. Statistical significance 
was set at P < 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± standard 
deviation.
Results
Pre‑trial measurements
There was no difference between trials for pre-trial 
body mass (PRO 78.9 ± 12.4 kg; CHO 78.7 ± 12.4 kg; 
P = 0.437), or subjective sensations of hunger (PRO 
40 ± 20 mm; CHO 40 ± 18 mm; P = 0.978), fullness 
(PRO 51 ± 12 mm; CHO 47 ± 15 mm; P = 0.347), DTE 
(PRO 40 ± 23 mm; CHO 43 ± 21 mm; P = 0.193) or PFC 
(PRO 46 ± 21 mm; CHO 51 ± 19 mm; P = 0.282).  
Ad libitum meal
Energy intake at the ad libitum meal was reduced during 
PRO compared to CHO (P = 0.009; Fig. 1). Eating rate was 
also reduced during PRO compared to CHO (P = 0.011; 
Fig. 2). The change in eating rate between trials was asso-
ciated with the change in energy intake between trials 
(r = 0.662, P = 0.007) Fig. 3. Ad libitum water intake 
did not differ between trials (P = 0.691) and amounted to 
339 ± 146 ml during PRO and 349 ± 152 ml during CHO. 
There was no trial order effect for energy intake (trial 1 
3874 ± 924 kJ; trial 2 4040 ± 1224 kJ; P = 0.599) or eating 
rate (trial 1 373 ± 90 kJ; trial 2 371 ± 168 kJ; P = 0.689).

P = 0.001; PFC P = 0.001), but no main effects of trial 
(hunger P = 0.301; fullness P = 0.671; DTE P = 0.150; 
PFC P = 0.051) or interaction effect (hunger P = 0.559; 
fullness P = 0.442; DTE P = 0.163; PFC P = 0.302). 
AUC values in response to the drinks were not different 
between trials for any subjective appetite variable (hun-
ger P = 0.425; fullness P = 0.512; DTE P = 0.234; PFC 
P = 0.220) (Table 3). 
Detection of study drinks
At the end of the study when subjects were told the drinks 
used in the study were a carbohydrate drink and a whey 
protein drink, 11 of the 15 subjects correctly identified on 
which trial they had consumed which drink.

Discussion
The aim of this study was to examine the effect of the macro-
nutrient composition of a drink consumed after resistance 
exercise on subsequent appetite and ad libitum energy intake. 
The primary finding was that energy intake was reduced after 
the consumption of a whey protein isolate drink compared to 
an energy-matched carbohydrate drink. Mean eating rate was 
also reduced after consumption of the whey protein drink. Fur-
thermore, there were significant differences in drink character-
istics, with the whey protein drink being perceived as thicker 
and creamier, as well as less sweet, pleasant and refreshing, 
which might have influenced subsequent energy intake.
It has been suggested that the daily discrepancy between 
intake and expenditure causing long-term weight gain is 
slight [13, 14]. Accordingly, the modest reduction in energy 
intake observed in the current study (430 ± 579 kJ) may 
augment the effects of resistance exercise in aiding long-
term weight management. The coefficient of variation of a 
single-item ad libitum meal with prior dietary standardisa-
tion has been shown to be ~8.9% [15]. The mean difference 
in energy intake between trials in the present study equated 
to 10.3%, which was slightly greater than that reported 
by Gregersen et al. [15], although the reproducibility of 
the ad libitum meal in the present study might have been 
improved by the inclusion of a familiarisation trial to habit-
uate subjects to the meal and eating environment. Resist-
ance exercise increases acute energy expenditure [16] and 
the resultant increase in muscle mass [17] might increase 
daily energy requirements via alterations in basal metabolic 
rate. The present study suggests that a reduction in energy 
intake following resistance exercise with whey protein 
consumption may offer an additional mechanism through 
which body re-composition might occur.
Several plausible explanations exist as to why protein 
in drink form might be more satiating than carbohydrate. 
These include effects on: gastrointestinal appetite-related 
hormones; circulating amino acids; and the sensory pro-
file of the drink. Protein consumption has been shown to 
elevate peripheral concentrations of the anorexogenic hor-
mones CCK and GLP-1 to a greater extent than carbohy-
drate, resulting in greater satiety [18, 19], although the 
strength of this relationship remains unclear. Additionally, 
the hyperaminoacidemia that occurs following protein 
ingestion may affect appetite both directly through amino 
acid-mediated mechanisms and indirectly by influencing 
glucose homeostasis [20]. These blood-based measure-
ments were not made in the present study, representing a 
limitation that should be rectified in future studies. Whilst 
energy intake was reduced during the PRO trial, there was 
no difference between trials for any subjective appetite 
measures. Some [6, 19, 21, 22], but not all [18, 23] previ-
ous studies at rest have reported enhanced satiety after con-
suming protein-containing drinks, but perhaps the inclusion 
of resistance exercise in the present study, which alters sub-
jective appetite responses independently [16] accounts for 
the lack of difference observed. In line with this hypothesis, 
no difference in subjective appetite has been observed fol-
lowing manipulation of the carbohydrate and protein con-
tent of drinks consumed after endurance exercise [8, 24], 
which also independently alters subjective appetite [16].
The greater thickness and creaminess of the protein drink 
may have played a role in reducing energy intake. The sen-
sory characteristics of a drink modify its satiating properties 
and might influence subsequent energy intake [25]. Viscos-
ity, or thickness, seems to play a particularly important role, 
with thicker drinks enhancing expectations of satiety [26, 
27]. Within the literature that has noted differences in energy 
intake between drinks of differing macronutrient content, it 
is not uncommon for drinks to either differ in hedonic quali-
ties or for subjects to clearly identify differences between 
drinks in terms of texture or flavour [6, 21, 23, 24]. Berten-
shaw et al. [28] demonstrated that matching high protein and 
carbohydrate drinks for perceived thickness and creaminess 
resulted in very similar satiety responses, despite liquid pro-
tein typically being found to induce greater satiety elsewhere 
in the literature. Furthermore, protein drinks that were less 
thick and creamy, despite being matched for nutritional 
content, were found to be less satiating, resulting in greater 
ad libitum energy intake compared to a sensory-enhanced 
protein drink. These results suggest that the sensory charac-
teristics of drinks are critical in determining short-term sati-
ety [28]. The exact mechanisms by which orosensory char-
acteristics of drinks influence appetite and energy intake are 
not clear, although such factors have been shown to elicit a 
hormonal effect associated with appetite control [29].
Within the current study, the protein drink was perceived 
to be thicker and creamier than the carbohydrate drink, and 
less pleasant. Consequently, it is probable that orosensory 
factors may have played a causal role in the reduction in 
energy intake after consumption of the protein drink com-
pared to the carbohydrate drink. Clayton et al. [8] reported 
energy intake 60 min after consuming whey protein and 
carbohydrate drinks was not different, whilst Rumbold 
et al. [24] reported reduced energy intake 60 min after

consuming skimmed milk compared to a carbohydrate 
drink. Interestingly, Clayton et al. [8] did not observe dif-
ferences in the thickness or creaminess of the drinks, a find-
ing that is likely due to the nature of the whey protein used 
and the fact that drinks were consumed through a straw to 
limit orosensory exposure. Whilst Rumbold et al. [24] did 
not report the subjects sensory perceptions of the drinks, 
the nature of the drinks (milk vs. orange juice) means it is 
highly likely that sensory differences, particularly thickness 
and creaminess would have been present [23]. Collectively, 
these results suggest that similar to consumption at rest 
[28], the orosensory effects of drinks consumed after exer-
cise might be important for how a drink impacts ad libi-
tum energy intake. Whilst the failure to match drinks for 
orosensory factors might represent a limitation of the pre-
sent study, it also increases the external validity of the study 
as in practice protein and carbohydrate drinks consumed in 
a post-exercise setting would likely differ hedonically.
The results of the present study suggest that the reduc-
tion in energy intake after protein consumption appears 
to be at least partially mediated by a reduction in eating 
rate. Mean eating rate was reduced after protein consump-
tion, and the change in eating rate was associated with the 
change in energy intake. Empirical evidence suggests that 
manipulating eating rate affects energy intake, with slower 
eating rates reducing energy intake [30]. Furthermore, 
reductions in energy intake as a result of slowed eating 
rates are not associated with increased hunger, decreasing 
the risk of subsequent compensatory eating [31]. In evalu-
ation, consuming a protein drink after resistance exercise 
may be an effective behavioural strategy to modify subse-
quent eating rate, which in turn might reduce energy intake 
without deleterious effects on hunger.
Resistance exercise increases muscle protein synthesis 
[32], and protein feeding post-exercise further potentiates this 
response [33], whilst concurrently suppressing muscle pro-
tein breakdown [34]. The synergistically stimulated increase 
in muscle protein synthesis, and to a lesser extent decrease in 
muscle protein breakdown, permits positive net protein bal-
ance and consequent muscle fibre hypertrophy [17]. Whilst 
the impact on hypertrophy of the reduction in energy intake 
observed in the present study is unknown, it seems unlikely 
it would significantly impair the process. Longland et al. [35] 
restricted energy intake by ~40% during a 4-week resistance 
training period whilst providing protein equivalent to 1.2 and 
2.4 g/kg body mass in two separate groups, respectively. Over 
the 4-week training period both groups lost ~3.5 kg of body 
mass, but there was no change in lean mass in a group con-
suming 1.2 g/kg protein and a ~1.2 kg increase in lean mass 
in a group consuming 2.4 g/kg protein. This suggests lean 
mass can be augmented whilst in negative energy balance, 
providing a high protein intake and resistance exercise are in 
place, at least in non-resistance-trained males. The reduction 
in energy intake after the whey protein drink in the present 
study equates to ~3% of subject’s estimated daily energy 
requirements. Given the findings of Longland et al. [35], 
the small reduction in energy intake observed after the whey 
protein beverage in the present study is unlikely to adversely 
affect the augmentation of lean mass.
The proximity of the ad libitum meal to the post-exer-
cise drink is relatively close within the current investiga-
tion, and it would be interesting to see whether the reduc-
tion in energy intake would remain at a more distal time 
point. The average time interval for voluntary meal requests 
has been suggested to occur ~80 min after the termination 
of exercise [36], which is similar to the 65 min used in the 
present study. Furthermore, the present study only exam-
ined a single post-exercise meal and as such future inves-
tigations should track energy intake responses over longer 
periods, as well as including measurements of other com-
ponents of energy balance (i.e. resting and physical activ-
ity energy expenditure). Finally, as the subjects used in the 
present study were experienced with resistance exercise, 
these results might not translate to those at the start of a 
resistance training programme.
To conclude, when a whey protein isolate drink was con-
sumed after resistance exercise in lean men experienced 
with resistance exercise, in an amount known to maximise 
muscle protein synthesis, there was a reduction in subse-
quent energy intake at a single ad libitum meal compared 
to an energy-matched carbohydrate drink. The reduction in 
energy intake was modest (430 kJ), and may have been par-
tially mediated by a reduction in eating rate, as well as the 
sensory characteristics of the drink. Whilst this reduction 
in energy intake is unlikely to impair the energy provision 
required to optimise muscle hypertrophy, it may be benefi-
cial for those individuals seeking to reduce body fat.
