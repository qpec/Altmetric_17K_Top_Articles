Recent studies suggest that exercise alters the gut microbiome. We determined whether
six-weeks endurance exercise, without changing diet, affected the gut metagenome and
systemic metabolites of overweight women. Previously sedentary overweight women
(n = 19) underwent a six-weeks endurance exercise intervention, but two were excluded
due to antibiotic therapy. The gut microbiota composition and functions were analyzed
by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metagenomics. Body composition
was analyzed with DXA X-ray densitometer and serum metabolomics with NMR
metabolomics. Total energy and energy-yielding nutrient intakes were analyzed from
food records using Micro-Nutrica software. Serum clinical variables were determined
with KONELAB instrument. Soluble Vascular Adhesion Protein 1 (VAP-1) was measured
with ELISA and its’ enzymatic activity as produced hydrogen peroxide. The exercise
intervention was effective, as maximal power and maximum rate of oxygen consumption
increased while android fat mass decreased. No changes in diet were observed.
Metagenomic analysis revealed taxonomic shifts including an increase in Akkermansia
and a decrease in Proteobacteria. These changes were independent of age, weight,
fat % as well as energy and fiber intake. Training slightly increased Jaccard distance
of genus level β-diversity. Training did not alter the enriched metagenomic pathways,
which, according to Bray Curtis dissimilarity analysis, may have been due to that only
half of the subjects’ microbiomes responded considerably to exercise. Nevertheless,
tranining decreased the abundance of several genes including those related to fructose
and amino acid metabolism. These metagenomic changes, however, were not translated
into major systemic metabolic changes as only two metabolites, phospholipids and
cholesterol in large VLDL particles, decreased after exercise. Training also decreased
the amine oxidase activity of pro-inflammatory VAP-1, whereas no changes in CRP
were detected. All clinical blood variables were within normal range, yet exercise slightly

increased glucose and decreased LDL and HDL. In conclusion, exercise training modified
the gut microbiome without greatly affecting systemic metabolites or body composition.
Based on our data and existing literature, we propose that especially Akkermansia and
Proteobacteria are exercise-responsive taxa. Our results warrant the need for further
studies in larger cohorts to determine whether exercise types other than endurance
exercise also modify the gut metagenome.

INTRODUCTION
The impact of the gut microbiota on human metabolic and
immunologic health is increasingly recognized (Sekirov et al.,
2010). Over a decade, a dysbiotic and metabolically unfavorable
gut microbiota composition has been linked with several diseases
(Ley et al., 2006; Cani et al., 2007; Munukka et al., 2012,
2014). Recently, animal models have shown that exercise impacts
microbial abundance (Lambert et al., 2015; Welly et al., 2016),
however, whether this holds true also in humans, is currently not
well known as discrepant results have been published. To date,
one study showed that exercise induced compositional changes
in the human gut microbiota that were more pronounced in lean
than in obese (Allen et al., 2017). Another study reported that
combined eight-weeks aerobic and resistance exercise induced
modest shifts in gut metagenomes despite no changes in the
diversity of taxa or metabolic pathways (Cronin et al., 2018).
Cross-sectional human studies have reported that professional
rugby players diverge from body mass index (BMI)-matched
non-athletes in several bacterial phyla (Clarke et al., 2014), and
that normal weight active women differ from sedentary women
in several taxa (Bressa et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the intake of
gut microbiota -affecting nutrients including fiber was notably
higher in athletes and active women than in non-athletes and
sedentary, respectively, which may have influenced the outcomes.
In addition, in the study of Bressa et al. the sedentary group
had significantly higher body fat percentage and mass (Bressa
et al., 2017), traits known to be highly associated with gut
microbiota composition (Turnbaugh et al., 2009). Acute effects of
exercise have also been studied using maximal bicycle ergometer
test that showed an increase in the abundance of 7 out of 9
major taxa in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic
fatigue syndrome compared to 2 of 9 in healthy controls (Shukla
et al., 2015). In addition, half marathon performed by amateurs
was reported to affect gut microbiota composition, predicted
functions and fecal metabolites (Zhao et al., 2018b).
Both exercise and gut microbiota are known to induce
inflammation (Clark and Mach, 2017), which may be mediated
by bacterial molecules-recognizing Toll-like receptors (TLR)
(McKenzie et al., 2017). Thus, inflammation could be one link
between the microbiota and the effects of exercise. Previously we
have shown that the amine oxidase activity of Vascular Adhesion
Protein 1 (VAP-1) is involved in a lipolysaccharide-induced
inflammation model (Yu et al., 2006) and thus might potentially
mediate the effects of the microbiota on inflammation. VAP-1
is a multifunctional protein with amine oxidase activity (Salmi
and Jalkanen, 2017) that degrades primary amines and produces
hydrogen peroxide, ammonium and aldehydes, which can
modify the microenvironment to pro-inflammatory direction
and cause detrimental effects on vasculature. Whether exercise
regulates VAP-1 enzymatic activity is currently unknown.
In order to amplify the knowledge on the relationship
between gut microbiota and exercise response in humans, this
study determined the effects of six-weeks endurance exercise
both on the gut microbiota composition and functions of
overweight women. We hypothesized that exercise training
would considerably change the microbiomes, which would
be associated with both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory
effects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Subjects
Inclusion criteria were sedentary lifestyle and body mass index
(BMI) >27.5 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria were major inflammatory
gastrointestinal disorders (Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, IBD),
major eating disorders, diagnosed type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus,
cardiovascular diseases other than hypertension (previous stroke,
transient ischemic attack, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction,
use of medication for cardiovascular diseases other than
hypertension, coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty or abnormal
result on an exercise test indicating myocardial ischemia),
hypothyroidism or other endocrine disease that may affect
training or the study outcomes, and musculoskeletal diseases that
could preclude the ability to perform training and testing. The
subjects had not ingested antibiotics within 2 months prior to the
sampling.
The study subjects were recruited through social media and by
advertising the study in the newspaper of Central Finland area.
Twenty-two women fulfilling the inclusion criteria were invited
to the laboratory measurements based on phone interview. The
medical history and current health status were evaluated via
self-administered questionnaire and clinical examination by a
physician including resting electrocardiogram. The physician
confirmed that the subjects met the inclusion criteria. Two
women were excluded: one due to the use of antidepressants that
affect serotonin levels and one because of multiple allergies and
anaphylactic reactions. Twenty women were thus included in the
study. Afterwards, one dropped out and two were excluded of the

microbiota analyses due to antibiotic therapy that is known to
affect gut microbiota composition. The study design is presented
in Figure 1. The study was conducted in accordance with the
Helsinki Declaration and approved by the ethical committee
of the Central Finland Health Care district (KSSHP) (KSSHP
document number 2U/2015). A written informed consent was
obtained from all study subjects prior to the study.
Food Diaries
The participants were advised to maintain their habitual ad
libitum diet. The intake of total energy and energy-yielding
nutrients were analyzed from 3-days food records (2 weekdays
and 1 weekend day) using Micro-Nutrica software. The software
has been continuously updated with new foods/drinks and
recipes. Food records contained time of eating, foods/drinks
consumed, and the amount of food/drink. Details of foods and
drinks, i.e., type and commercial brand name, were entered in
the records. Fourteen subjects completed the food diaries in all
time points and were included in the analyses.
Endurance Exercise Test
Incremental submaximal endurance exercise test was carried
out using bicycle ergometer (SRM ErgoMeter, Schoberer Rad
Messtechnik, Jülich, Germany). The intensity of 30 W was used
at the beginning of the test, and was increased by 20 W every
second minute until 85% of subject’s age-predicted heart rate
maximum (HRmax) (Tanaka et al., 2001) was reached. The
identical loading protocol was used in each test session and
changes in gross efficiency and cycling economy was studied at 62
± 3% of the estimated maximal power output at baseline (Pre).
The subjects maintained a pedal cadence of 60 rpm that was
observed continuously by a visual display on the cycle ergometer.
Subjects perception of exertion was monitored using Borg’s 6–
20-point RPE scale (Borg, 1970) at the end of each stage. HR
was monitored throughout the test (Polar S410; Polar Electro
Oy, Kempele, Finland) and the average over the last 30 s of each
stage was used for the subsequent analyses. To calculate estimated
VO2max, the HR response was plotted against the workloads of
each stage which were then extrapolated to the subject’s estimated
HRmax (Tanaka et al., 2001) to predict corresponding maximal
power output. Predicted maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was
calculated using the equation: VO2max (ml kg−1 min −1) = (1.8
× predicted maximal power output, kgm min−1)/body mass, kg)
+ 7. Oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2),
and ventilation (VE) were determined continuously breath-by-
breath using a metabolic cart (Oxycon Mobile, Jaeger, VIASYS
Healthcare GmbH, Hoechberg, Germany). The average of the
last 30 s of each stage was recorded for the analysis. The gas
analyzer was calibrated on each testing day. Gross efficiency (%)
for each stage was calculated dividing power output (W) by
energy expended (J s−1) as previously described (Moseley and
Jeukendrup, 2001). Energy expenditure was calculated as follows:
[(3.869 × VO2) + (1.195 × VCO2)] × (4.186/60) × 1,000
(Moseley and Jeukendrup, 2001). In the calculation of energy
expended, 1 J/s = 1 W. Blood. samples for lactate concentration
were taken from the fingertip before and every second minute
during the incremental loading, as well as 2 min after the exercise
test. Blood lactate concentrations were analyzed with Biosen C-
line Clinic analyzer (EKF Diagnostic, Cardiff, UK). Individual
aerobic and anaerobic thresholds for the determination of
training intensities were assessed using deflection points obtained
by plotting the curves of blood lactate concentrations, ventilation,
oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production (Aunola
and Rusko, 1986).
Maximal Isometric Force
An electromechanical dynamometer (modified DAVID F 200
apparatus, David Health Solutions Ltd., Helsinki, Finland) was
used to measure maximal voluntary isometric force of the
bilateral knee extension action at a knee angle of 107◦. A
minimum of three trials was completed for each subject, and the

best performance trial (kg) was used for the subsequent statistical
analysis.
Muscle Thickness of M. vastus lateralis
The muscle thickness of M. vastus lateralis from the midpoint
of proximal border of the patella and trochanter major of the
right leg was measured with a compound ultrasonography (Aloka
ProSound SSD-5500, Tokyo, Japan). At each ultrasonography
measurement, three consecutive measures were taken and two
closest values were averaged for further analyses.
Endurance Training
Subjects were asked to maintain individual habitual physical
activity throughout the study. All prescribed training in the
study was consistently supervised by qualified instructors.
The training was designed to reflect a program aimed for
physically active populations according to recommendations
outlined by the American College of Sports Medicine. The
intensity of the endurance training during the 6-weeks training
period was controlled by HR (Polar S410; Polar Electro Oy,
Kempele, Finland) associated with subject’s individual aerobic
and anaerobic threshold determined during the measurement
before the training period. Subjects were instructed to maintain
a constant pedaling frequency of ∼60 rpm during each training
session (controlled by metronome), while the magnetic resistance
of the ergometer (Precor Studio Team Bike, Gym Equipment
Ireland, Dublin, Ireland) was adjusted to achieve the required
exercise intensity. Three training sessions were performed per
week and carried out in groups of 2–4 subjects. During weeks 1–
2, 40 min steady-state cycling of low intensity (below the aerobic
threshold) was performed. During weeks 3–4, the duration of the
exercise session was 50 min. Every other training session included
three 10-min intervals of moderate intensity cycling (between the
aerobic and anaerobic threshold) while rest of the training session
was performed with low intensity cycling. Every other training
session included only low intensity cycling. During weeks 5–6,
the duration of training sessions were 60 min and included four
10-min intervals of moderate intensity cycling while rest of the
training session was performed with low intensity cycling. The
training intensity was verified by RPE scale and blood lactate
measures in the beginning of the training period.
Body Composition Measurement
Body height (cm) was measured by using a wall-fixed measuring
device and weight (kg) determined with electronic scale. BMI
was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2. Waist circumference
was measured twice with a tape measure, and the mean value
was used. Body composition, i.e., total body fat mass (FM, kg),
FM percentage (FM%), android and gynoid FM and % and
lean tissue mass (LM, kg), was assessed with dual-energy X-
ray absorptiometry (DXA, Prodigy; GE Lunar Corp., Madison,
WI, USA).
Fecal Sample Collection, 16s rRNA Gene
Sequencing and Metagenome Analyses
Subjects self-collected the fecal samples before the control
period, and after the control period and the exercise training
period. The samples were always collected over 72 h after the
last exercise bout. Samples were frozen immediately at −20◦C
after collection, brought to laboratory frozen and stored at
−80◦C until processing. Total bacterial DNA was extracted using
GTX stool kit and semi-automated GenoXtract machine (Hain
Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) within 2 days after arrival. The
gut microbiota composition of the samples from the baseline,
before the exercise period and after the exercise period was
analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Variable
region V4 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified as
described previously (Rintala et al., 2018), and the 16S rRNA gene
libraries were sequenced with 2 × 250 bp paired-end reads on
Illumina MiSeq system (Illumina, Inc.) using MiSeq v3 reagent
kit (Illumina, Inc.). The sequences have been deposited to ENA
with the accession number PRJEB27978.
The samples before and after the exercise training were
further subject to metagenome analysis. DNA libraries were
generated following Nextera XT Illumina protocol (#FC-131-
1024, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and 0.2 ng/ul of purified
gDNA. The multiplexing step was performed using Nextera
XT Index Kit (#FC-131-1096). The libraries were sequenced
using 2 × 300 pb paired-end run (#MiSeq Reagent kit v3 #MS-
102-3001) on a MiSeq Sequencer according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Illumina). After sequencing, quality assessment of
the obtained reads was performed using “prinseq-lite” program
(Schmieder and Edwards, 2011) applying following parameters:
min_length: 50; trim_qual_right: 20; trim_qual_type: mean;
trim_qual_window: 20. Paired-end fastq files resulting from
Illumina sequencing were joined using “fastq-join” from “ea-
tools” suite (https://expressionanalysis.github.io/ea-utils/, last
web-site access 19/10/2017). Sequences passing quality controls
were screened for ribosomal genes, i.e., Small Subunit (SSU) and
Large Subunit (LS): 16S and 23S rRNA genes, respectively, using
“sortmerna” program (Kopylova et al., 2012). Reads containing
ribosomal gene fragments were passed to taxonomic analysis, and
taxonomic annotation of SSU and LSU reads was carried out with
SILVA Incremental Aligner (SINA) v1.2.10 using SILVA Release
123.1 (Pruesse et al., 2007, 2012). The rest of the reads were used
for ORFs. The metagenome taxonomic data has been deposited
to ENA with the accession number PRJEB27914.
The database of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs)
(Tatusov et al., 1997; Galperin et al., 2015) was used to identify
the role of predicted proteins and to determine the relative
abundance of broad functional categories. The latest version of
the COGs database contains 4,631 orthologous proteins based
on the annotation of 711 microbial genomes that represent the
diversity of bacteria and archaea. All predicted proteins from
the fecal samples were mapped onto the COGs database via
BLASTP searches using a cut-off of 10−10 and selection of the best
blast hit. The functional annotation of all ORFs was performed
in two steps: (1) a BLASTP search using an e-value cut-off of
10−10 to filter out random matches and (2) selection of only
one matching sequence based on the best blast hit to prevent
cross-reference among genes. The gene abundances, the gene
abundance enrichment in KEGG pathways, Principal component
analysis (PCA) and Bray Curtis dissimilarity analysis were further
performed using Microbiome Analyst (www.microbiomeanalyst.

ca). After filtering genes with the lowest abundance (<2 hits),
the total number of genes was 256 of which 132 were mapped
to Microbiome Analyst database. The abundance range of the
genes was 68-3773 before exercise and 47-3688 after exercise.
When assessing the metagenome data the samples of two subjects
clustered differently and were removed from the final analyses.
Therefore, 15 subjects were included in the metagenome analyses.
Blood Samples, Analysis of Clinical
Variables and Metabolomics
Blood samples were taken after overnight fasting over 72 h
after the last exercise bout. The analysis of clinical variables
(glucose, LDL and HDL cholesterol, free fatty acids, triglycerides
and insulin) were analyzed with KONELAB 20XTi analyser
(Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA).
Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)
was calculated fasting glucose × fasting insulin/22.5.
Metabolic biomarkers were quantified from plasma using
targeted high-throughput proton NMR metabolomics platform
(Brainshake Ltd, Helsinki, Finland). This method provides
simultaneous
quantification
of
routine
lipids,
lipoprotein
subclass profiling with lipid concentrations within 14 subclasses,
fatty acid composition, abundant proteins and various low-
molecular metabolites including amino acids, ketone bodies
and gluconeogenesis-related metabolites in molar concentration
units. The 14 lipoprotein subclass sizes were defined as follows:
extremely large VLDL with particle diameters from 75 nm
upwards and a possible contribution of chylomicrons, five VLDL
subclasses (average particle diameters of 64.0, 53.6, 44.5, 36.8,
and 31.3 nm), IDL (28.6 nm), three LDL subclasses (25.5, 23.0,
and 18.7 nm), and four HDL subclasses (14.3, 12.1, 10.9, and
8.7 nm). The following components of the lipoprotein subclasses
were
quantified:
phospholipids,
triglycerides,
cholesterol,
free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. The mean size for
VLDL, LDL, and HDL particles was calculated by weighing
the
corresponding
subclass
diameters
with
their
particle
concentrations. Representative coefficients of variations over
thousands of samples for the NMR-based metabolic measures
have been reported before (Kettunen et al., 2016).
VAP-1 Concentration and Enzymatic
Activity
Soluble VAP-1 (sVAP-1) levels were measured with an in-
house sandwich ELISA as previously described (Aalto et al.,
2014) and the enzymatic activity of VAP-1 as production of
hydrogen peroxide as previously described (Aalto et al., 2012).
Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Roskilde,
Denmark) were coated with a monoclonal anti-VAP-1 antibody
overnight. Serum samples (diluted in 1:100) were added, and
after incubation and subsequent washes bound VAP-1 was
detected with another biotinylated anti-VAP-1 monoclonal
antibody and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate
(GEHealthcare, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Finally,
BM Chemiluminescence ELISA substrate (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany) was added, and the luminescence was
measured with Tecan Infinite M200 plate reader (Tecan Group
Ltd, Männedorf, Switzerland). The sVAP-1 values are presented
as nanograms of protein in a milliliter of serum.
VAP-1 amine oxidase activity was assayed radiochemically
using
[7-14C]-benzylamine
hydrochloride
(spec.
act.
57
mCi/mmol, Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK) as a substrate. The
catalytic reaction was stopped by 100 µl of 2 mol/L citric acid,
and aldehyde reaction products were extracted from the analyzed
mixture into toluene containing 0.35 g/L diphenyloxazole.
The amount of 14C-labeled benzaldehyde was quantified by
scintillation counting with a β-counter (Wallac, Waltham, MA,
USA). The activity of the enzyme was expressed as nanomoles of
benzaldehyde oxidized by 1 mg lysate protein per hour. Protein
concentrations were determined with Pierce bicinchoninic acid
assay (Thermo Fischer, Waltham, MA, USA).
Real-Time Quantitative PCR From Whole
Blood
Total RNA was extracted of 500 µl of whole blood using Tri
reagent (Fischer Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA) according to
the supplier’s protocol. Total RNA was reversely transcribed
according
to
the
manufacturer’s
instructions
using
High
Capacity cDNA Synthesis Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA). Real-time PCR analyses were performed according to
MIQE guidelines using in-house designed primers (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), iQ SYBR Supermix, and CFX96TM Real-
time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond,
CA, USA). The primer sequences were as follows; TLR4:
Fwd5′AAGCCGAAAGGTGATTGTTG′3
and
Rev5′CTGA
GCAGGGTCTTCTCCAC′3; TLR5: Fwd5′TCAAACCCCTTC
AGAGAATCCC′3
and
Rev5′TTGGAGTTGAGGCTTAGT
CCCC′3; GAPDH: Fwd5′CCACCCATGGCAAATTCC′3 and
Rev5′TGGGATTTCCATTGATGACAA′3.
Each
sample
was
analyzed in duplicate, and PCR cycle parameters were as follows:
+95◦C for 10 min, 40 cycles at +95◦C for 10 s, at +56◦C
(TLR4) or +59◦C (TLR5) or +60◦C (GAPDH) for 30 s, and at
+72◦C for 30 s, followed finally by 5 s at +65◦C. The relative
expression levels of TLR4 and TLR5 were determined with
CFX96TM Manager Software against the standard curve. Finally,
the relative expression levels were normalized to the levels of the
GAPDH housekeeping gene.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were made using IBM SPSS Statistics 22
(Armonk, NY, USA). Shapiro Wilk’s test in SPSS was used to
assess the normality of distribution. The differences in normally
distributed variables: body composition, metabolites, physical
performance,
energy
intakes,
and
metagenome
functions
between different time points were studied with repeated
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the GLM
procedure and Bonferroni post-hoc test. From the 16S rRNA
gene amplicon sequencing and metagenome sequencing the
group comparisons of gut microbiota were analyzed with
non-parametric Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank test and
corrected for multiple comparison with Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure. Regarding the taxonomic data, all analyses were
made with QIIME from the randomly subsampled OTU table
with rarefaction level matching the sample with the lowest total

OTU count. The bacterial diversity of the samples (α-diversity
metrics) and statistically significant differences in the OTU
abundances were computed with QIIME. Taxonomic levels
Phylum, Family and Genus were studied. The correlations
between the non-normally distributed gut microbiota and other
variables were determined using Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient in SPSS. General linear model in SPSS was used to
determine whether the changes in taxa occurred in response to
exercise or whether they were dependent on age, weight, body fat
%, android fat %, intake of total energy intake, sucrose or fiber.
RESULTS
Exercise Training Significantly Increased
Maximal Power and Oxygen Uptake
Capacity and Decreased Blood Lactate
Previously sedentary overweight women (n = 19) underwent the
six-weeks guided endurance exercise intervention but two were
excluded of the final analyses due to antibiotic therapy during the
intervention. They had no intestinal or other chronic diseases or
medications that could have affected the gut microbiota. While
no changes in the physical performance were observed after the
control period, both the maximal power and maximum rate
of oxygen consumption (VO2max) increased after the exercise
training period (Table 1). Blood lactate levels at submaximal
workload decreased following the training period (Table 1)
indicating improved aerobic metabolism.
Exercise Training did not Lead to a
Significant Weight Loss but Decreased
Android Fat Mass
Due to that the gut microbiota composition is known to be
highly associated with weight and body composition (Turnbaugh
et al., 2009), the body composition of the study subjects was
determined with DXA, BMI and weight. In the beginning of
the study the study participants (36.8 ± 3.9 years old) weighed
90.1 ± 15.7 kg, after the control period 89.9 ± 15.0 kg and after
exercise training 89.1 ± 15.2 kg. The BMI in the beginning of
the study was 31.7 ± 4.4 kg/m2, after the control period 31.7
± 4.1 kg/m2 and after exercise training 31.4 ± 4.1 kg/m2. No
significant changes after the control or exercise training period
were observed in weight, blood pressure, waist circumference,
BMI, total or gynoid FM, total, android or gynoid fat%, or visceral

fat (Table 2). After the exercise training period, a reduction of
android fat mass (p = 0.005) was measured, which was not found
after the control period (Table 2).
Exercise Slightly Affected Clinical Variables
While the determined clinical variables were within normal
healthy range, exercise training slightly increased serum glucose
and decreased HDL and LDL cholesterol levels (Table 3). Free
fatty acids decreased and triglycerides and insulin increased after
the control period.
No Changes in Total Energy Intake, Intake
of Energy-Yielding or Gut
Microbiota-Affecting Nutrients Were
Observed After the Exercise Period
As dietary composition affects the gut microbiota, the total daily
energy and the intake of energy-yielding nutrients, were analyzed
from the 3-days food records. In addition, the energy % derived
from the nutrients as well as daily intake of bread, other grain
products, vegetables, fruits, berries, meat, fish, fermented milk
products and cheeses were analyzed. Fourteen subjects completed
the food diaries in all time points. No changes in their intake were
observed after the control period or the exercise training period
(Table 4). However, the energy % derived from starch slightly
increased after the exercise period (p = 0.033).
Microbiome Analysis Revealed That
Exercise Training Modified the
Composition and Functions of the Gut
Microbiota
Due to that the exercise intervention was successful in increasing
the maximal power and maximum rate of oxygen consumption,
and no gross changes in weight, body composition or diet
occurred after the exercise period, we were confident to detect
the specific effects of exercise training on the gut microbiota if
there were any.
With 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, no governing
effects on gut microbiota were observed after the control period,

while after the exercise period the genus Streptococcus tended to
decrease (p = 0.16). The read count in 16S rRNA gene sequencing
was 49,761–207,043 per sample. The variation in the genus level
composition of the gut microbiota between the subjects appears
to be vast in all analyzed time points (Figure 2A). The Principal
component analysis (PCoA) showed that the lack of abundant
changes may have been due to relatively heterogeneous responses
of the subjects to exercise training and inter-individual variation
in gut microbiota (Figure 2B).
To obtain a deeper insight into the possible compositional and
functional shifts of the gut microbiota, metagenome analysis was
performed from the samples before and after the exercise period.
The mean read count in the samples before exercise training
was 579,673 ± 230,079, and after exercise training 583,651 ±

clustered differently and were excluded of the final analyses. In
response to exercise training, no differences in gut microbiota
α-diversity or the phylum level abundancies or the relationship
of Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes were found (data not shown).
However, the Jaccard distance of genus level β-diversity increased
from 0.449 to 0.465 (p = 0.014) in response to exercise training,

gene amplicon sequencing show great inter-individual variation that may have caused the lack of significant differences between the samples collected before the

while phyla and family levels did not change. In addition, exercise
training resulted in a decrease of gram-negative Proteobacteria
(p = 0.039, Figure 3A) and an increase in Verrucomicrobia
(p = 0.038). Specifically, exercise increased Verrucomicrobiaceae
(p = 0.038) and Bifidobacteriaceae (p = 0.015; Figure 3A).
Further, the genus Dorea (p = 0.028), Anaerofilum (p = 0.037)
and Akkermansia (p = 0.038) increased while unidentified
Porphyromonadaceae (p = 0.016), Odoribacter (p = 0.033),
unidentified Desulfovibrionaceae (p = 0.037), and unidentified
Enterobacteriaceae (p = 0.036) decreased after exercise training
(Figure 3A).
We further determined using general linear model whether
the changes in taxa occurred in response to exercise training
or whether they were dependent on age, weight, body fat
%, android fat %, intake of total energy intake, sucrose
or fiber (Table 5). The changes in Bifidobacteraceae, and
unidentified Desulfovibrionaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were
dependent on all variables except age. The results suggest that
only Proteobacteria, Verrucomibrobia, Verrucomicrobiaceae, and
Akkermansia respond to exercise training independently of
above-mentioned variables.
The metagenomics assessment of the functional genes
revealed
no
changes
in

pathways
after

exercise period (Figure 3B). Accordingly the enrichment of
pathways was not altered as shown in Table 6. The same

were

microbiomes before and after the exercise training. Of the
enriched pathways only Polyketide sugar unit biosynthesis
remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons
(FDR). However, a closer analysis of individual genes showed
that several gut microbiota functions decreased after the exercise
period (Table 7). Despite finding post-intervention alterations in
these genes, it was evident from the PCoA (Figure 4A) and Bray
Curtis analyses that the samples before and after the exercise
training cluster closely together indicating their similarity
and that only approximately half of the subject’s microbiome
had considerably responded to the exercise training, i.e., had
Bray Curtis index close to 0.8 (Figure 4B). In agreement, the
Correspondence analysis shows that the samples before exercise
are less variable (more close to the centroid) than the samples
after exercise indicating that the exercise has caused shifts
in COGs, which, nevertheless, are relatively heterogeneous
(Figure 4C).
We further looked at the changes in body composition and
clinical variables in those subjects whose microbiomes changed
after exercise training according to Bray Curtis index. In this
subgroup no significant changes in body composition occurred,
and the change in android fat mass was no longer significant.
Of the clinical variables the change in HDL, LDL and glucose
remained significant while no other changes were detected.

Exercise and Gut Metagenome
FIGURE 3 | The fecal metagenome analysis reveals that exercise causes shifts in the microbiome at taxonomic while no changes in the major functional pathways
were detected. (A) The box plots in the figure show phylum, family and genus level abundances before (n = 15) and after (n = 15) the exercise period of the
significantly changing gut microbiota according to the metagenome analysis. An increase was detected in Verrucomicrobia, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae,
Akkermansia, Anaerofilum and Dorea while Proteobacteria, Odoribacter and unidentified Desulfovibrionaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae
decreased. (B) In the metagenomes no significant differences in the major KEGG metabolic pathways were detected between the samples before and after exercise
according to the analysis performed with Microbiome Analyst. When assessing the metagenome data the samples of two subjects clustered differently and were
removed from the final analyses. Therefore, 15 subjects were included in the metagenome analyses.
Association of the Diet With Metagenomic
Functions
As several reduced metagenomic functions were related to
protein metabolism and B vitamin synthesis, we analyzed the
associations between total protein, meat, vitamins B2 and
B12 intake, the metagenomic functions and the abundance of
microbial taxa. We found that aspartate ammonialyase after the
exercise training associated inversely with protein intake before
the exercise training (r = −0.720, p = 0.019) and B2 vitamin
intake after the exercise training (r = −0.648, p = 0.043), and
meat intake after the exercise training with the transcriptional
regulator of aromatic amino acid metabolism (r = −0.774,
p = 0.024).

Cardiovascular Effects
Exercise

decreased
plasma

and
cholesterol in large VLDL particles (p < 0.05 for both,
Figure 5A) that, however, were not associated with gut
microbiota.
Somewhat
surprisingly,
exercise
training
did
not significantly alter any other serum metabolites. The
Correspondence analysis shows that it may be due to different
clustering and inter-individual variation of samples before and
after the exercise training (Figure 5B), and moreover, because
the samples of each subject before and after exercise tended to
cluster together indicating no gross changes in metabolites in
response to exercise training (Figure 5B).
No changes were observed in serum CRP levels at any time
point (Figure 5C). Exercise training decreased the enzymatic
activity of VAP-1 (p = 0.011, Figure 5C), while such decrease
was not seen in protein concentration, suggesting induction
of an endogenous inhibitor. No significant differences in the
expression levels of TLR4 were found while TLR5 expression
significantly increased during the exercise period (p = 0.029,
Figure 5D).
The Associations of Gut Microbiota With
Body Composition Disappear After the
Exercise Period
The associations of gut microbiota with body composition
were studied before and after the exercise training. The
significant associations of gut microbiota with body composition
before the exercise period are displayed in Figure 6. After the
exercise period, Bifidobacterium genus correlated with waist
circumference (r = −0.580, p = 0.036), and Dorea with weight

(r = 0.591, p = 0.033), android FM (r = 0.630, p = 0.021) and
waist circumefrence (r = 0.674, p = 0.012).
DISCUSSION
In this study we showed that six-weeks endurance exercise
intervention modestly modified the composition and functions
of the gut microbiota without greatly affecting systemic
metabolites
or
body
composition.
However,
the
exercise
intervention was successful as the maximal power and maximum
rate of oxygen consumption increased. Since no evident changes
in weight, body composition and diet occurred during the
exercise training, it can be proposed that the effects on gut
microbiota were related to the exercise training. The only change
in the diet after the exercise period was a slight increase in
energy derived from starch. However, this has not likely affected
the metagenome as starch is broken down into glucose moieties
and metagenome analysis revealed no increases in glucose
metabolism genes.
The major findings of this study indicate that the six-
weeks guided endurance exercise training induced modest
shifts in gut microbiota both at taxonomical and functional
level. In accordance, animal studies by us and others have
reported that high-intensity endurance training modified the
gut microbiota (Campbell et al., 2016; Denou et al., 2016)
and, that intrinsic aerobic capacity impacts the microbiota
composition (Pekkala et al., 2017). In recent times, accumulating
attention has been addressed to the possible link between gut
microbiota and physical fitness also in humans. It seems that both
compositional and functional differencies in the gut microbiota
exist between professional athletes and their BMI-matched
sedentary counterparts (Clarke et al., 2014) as well as between
physically active and sedentary women (Bressa et al., 2017). But
interestingly, contradictory findings from the human exercise
interventions have been recently presented (Allen et al., 2017;
Cronin et al., 2018). In contrast to our study, after eight-weeks
of non-guided, combined aerobic and resistance exercise, Cronin
et al. failed to detect significant changes in the gut microbiota
composition or functions. However, including both genders in
the study may have hindered some of the discoveries, as gender
differences in the gut microbiota are known to influence, for
instance, metabolic outcomes and immunity (Fransen et al.,
2017). Therefore, our study is not straightforward comparable to
the study published by Cronin et al. On the other hand, similar
to our results, Allen and co-workers reported compositional and
β-diversity changes of the microbiota in response to six-weeks
endurance training that resembled the intervention of our study
(Allen et al., 2017). The authors concluded that the shifts were
dependent on the obesity status and were reversed after cessation
of the training.
Inter-individual variation in the gut microbiota composition
and gene content is known to be vast (Lozupone et al., 2012).
Hence, also the responsiviness of an individual to certain lifestyle
changes, such as dietary intervention or increased physical
activity varies greatly (Korpela and de Vos, 2016; Korpela et al.,
2016) creating a challenge in studies designed to modify the gut
microbiota. Therefore, we studied the effects of exercise training
on the microbiome in a study setting in which the subjects
served as their own controls. However, even with such study
set up no effects of the intervention on gut microbiota were
observed with lower sequencing depth, and modest changes were
found with deeper metagenomic analysis. It was evident from
Bray Curtis dissimilarity analysis that the difficulty in finding
more than modest changes is partly due to that approximately
only half of the subjects’ microbiomes actually responded to the
exercise training. This suggests that among the microbiota there
may be exercise responsive and non-responsive taxa that will be
discussed in the following paragraph. A similar concept of the so-
called responder microbes was also raised in a diet intervention
that attempted to ameliorate Type 2 diabetes by improving short
chain fatty acid (SCFA) production from fibers (Zhao et al.,
2018a). The authors treated 27 subjects with a high-fiber diet and
found that despite harboring SCFA metabolism genes only 15 out
of 154 potential taxa responded to the diet.
It is noteworthy that the exercise training increased the
abundance of Verrucomirobia, a phylum that contains only
a few species, and further Akkermansia, one of the major
representatives of Verrucomicrobia. Akkermansia is suggested to
be health-beneficial for its capacity to improve lipid oxidation
in diet-induced obese mice (Everard et al., 2013). In agreement
with our findings, several line of evidence suggest that these taxa
respond to exercise. First, athletes harbored more Akkermansia
than sedentary controls (Clarke et al., 2014) as did the active
women compared to inactive (Bressa et al., 2017). However, it
should be noted that in both studies the active and sedentary
group differed from each other in dietary intakes, especially
fiber intake. This may have influenced the outcomes as fiber-
rich diet seem to promote Akkermansia growth (Everard et al.,
2014). In our study the change in Akkermansia occurred
independent of weight, body compostion and food intake.
Second, a 4-days cross-country, military ski-march increased
Verrucomicrobia abundance (Karl et al., 2017) supporting further
the emplacement of this phyla among the exercise-responsive
taxa. Akkermansia has been found to be lower in several
conditions, such as during obesity, diabetes (Cani and de Vos,
2017) and therefore, if future studies are able to show that the low
abundance is major contributor to these coinditions and exercise
increases the abundace, exercise would likely improve the
diseases.
Our

intervention
decreased
the
abundance of Proteobacteria and an unidentified genus of
Enterobacteriaceae. The change in Proteobacteria occurred
independent of weight, body compostion and food intake. An
increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae has been reported in
obesity (Scheepers et al., 2015) and non-alcoholic steatohepatosis
(Zhu et al., 2013), suggesting that these species may be health-
detrimental. In agreement with our findings, exercise decreased
Proteobacteria in rats with high aerobic capacity (Liu et al., 2015).
However, to our knowledge, no studies in humans have reported
associations between Proteobacteria and exercise or physical
fitness that would support the responsiveness of this taxon to
exercise training. But Dorea, Odoribacter and a yet unidentified
genus of Desulfovibrionaceae may be responders. Corroborating

our findings Odoribacter and unidentified Desulfovibrionaceae
were lower in active women than sedentary (Bressa et al., 2017)
and in rats the latter decreased in response to voluntary exercise
(Liu et al., 2015). In animal models exercise has boosted the
abundance of Dorea (Allen et al., 2015; Denou et al., 2016) while
in a human study it increased after cessation of the training and
not in response to exercise (Allen et al., 2017). However, the
changes in Dorea, Odoribacter and a yet unidentified genus of
Desulfovibrionaceae were dependent on age, weight, body fat
%, android fat %, intake of total energy, sucrose or fiber. We
therefore propose that Verrucomicrobia and Akkermansia are
true exercise-responsive taxa.
It was recently demonstrated by targeted gene amplification,
not metagenomics, that in addition to the influence on the
gut microbiota composition, exercise training increased the
gene encoding butyrate forming Butyryl CoA: Acetate CoA
transferase (Allen et al., 2017), which occured due to an
increase in butyrate-producing bacteria. However, in our study,
despite the favorable taxonomic shifts in butyrate-producing
Akkermansia and Dorea, exercise training did not increase
butyrate metabolism genes but reduced several metagenomic
functions including those related to fructose, mannose, alanine
and aromatic amino acids metabolism. Some of these functional
changes may have simple biological explanations. As exercise

Exercise and Gut Metagenome
FIGURE 4 | Exercise training increases the variability of the functional genes but only half of the subjects microbiomes respond to exercise. (A) PCoA plot of the
functional genes shows that the samples before (n = 15) and after (n = 15) the exercise cluster closely together indicating their similarity. The first component explains
39.3% and the second 11.5% of the variability. (B) The Correspondence analysis of the functional genes shows that the samples before the exercise are less variable
(more close to the centroid) than the samples after the exercise training indicating that the exercise has caused shifts in the gene abundances. (C) The Bray Curtis
dissimilarity analysis shows that only approximately half of the subjects microbiomes have considerably responded to the exercise training, i.e., have Bray Curtis index
close to 0.8.
is known to increase absorption of fructose (Fujisawa et al.,
1993) that mainly occurs in the small intestine, it is possible that
less sugars reach the colon where the majority of carbohydrate-
metabolizing microbes reside (Krajmalnik-Brown et al., 2012).
This could contribute to the reduction in fructose and mannose
metabolism genes. Similarly, the statistically non-signifcant
decline in protein ingestion during the exercise period can
contribute to the decrease of metagenomic functions related
to amino acids metabolism. Nevertheless, a prolonged protein
supplementation did not affect the gut microbiome (Cronin
et al., 2018) and therefore the real effect of reduced protein
intake can be questioned. In summary, it seems that exercise
training without an accompanying robust dietary change may
not considerably affect the metagenomic functions. However,
it should be noted that although food records are considered
as a reliable dietary assessment tool, they are prone to under-
reporting, and social-desirability and social approval bias, which
could e.g., result in lower assessed energy intake, and over-
reporting of healthy foods and underreporting of unhealthy
foods. In agreement with no gross changes in the diet, the modest
functional changes in gut microbiota were not translated into
major systemic metabolic changes, as metabolomics analyses
showed changes only in phospholipids and cholesterol in
large VLDL particles in response to exercise. However, these
changes are beneficial for cardiometabolic health as VLDL
transports lipids from liver to peripheral tissues and thus has
detrimental cardiovascular effects (Ren et al., 2010). The VLDL
particle reducing effect of exercise is supported by our own
study showing that long-term leisure time physical activity
was associated with lower cholesterol in VLDL (Kujala et al.,
2013).
Finally, exercise training decreased VAP-1 activity, which
can have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects especially on
vasculature, though the underlying mechanisms could not be
determined in this study. Exercise training possibly produces
a yet unknown endogenous inhibitor of VAP-1, but it remains
to be determined how exercise regulates VAP-1 activity without
affecting its protein concentration. Another immunologic change
was the increased expression of TLR5 in response to exercise
training. Our finding is in agreement with the report showing
that a prolonged bout of strenuous exercise increases the
expression of TLRs (Gleeson, 2007). In addition, in mice,
exhaustive exercise up-regulates flagellin-mediated inflammation
by increasing TLR5 expression (Uchida et al., 2014).

Exercise and Gut Metagenome
In conclusion, a successfully conducted six-weeks guided
endurance exercise training modified the composition and
functions of gut microbiota without greatly affecting systemic
metabolites. These shifts were independent of gross changes in
weight, body composition or diet. Based on our data and existing
literature we propose that especially Akkermansia is an exercise-
responsive taxon. Our results warrant the need for further studies
in larger cohorts to determine whether all exercise types other
than endurance exercise also modify the gut metagenome. In
the future, it would be important to confirm the gut microbiota
findings with longer/larger exercise trials and to see whether in
long-term the exercise-induced gut microbiota changes lead to
changes in the metabolome.
