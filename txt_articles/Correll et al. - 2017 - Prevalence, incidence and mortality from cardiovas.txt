People with severe mental illness (SMI) – schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder – appear at risk for cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD), but a comprehensive meta-analysis is lacking. We conducted a large-scale meta-analysis assessing the prevalence and incidence of
CVD; coronary heart disease; stroke, transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular disease; congestive heart failure; peripheral vascular disease;
and CVD-related death in SMI patients (N53,211,768) versus controls (N5113,383,368) (92 studies). The pooled CVD prevalence in SMI
patients (mean age 50 years) was 9.9% (95% CI: 7.4-13.3). Adjusting for a median of seven confounders, patients had significantly higher odds
of CVD versus controls in cross-sectional studies (odds ratio, OR51.53, 95% CI: 1.27-1.83; 11 studies), and higher odds of coronary heart dis-
ease (OR51.51, 95% CI: 1.47-1.55) and cerebrovascular disease (OR51.42, 95% CI: 1.21-1.66). People with major depressive disorder were at
increased risk for coronary heart disease, while those with schizophrenia were at increased risk for coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular dis-
ease and congestive heart failure. Cumulative CVD incidence in SMI patients was 3.6% (95% CI: 2.7-5.3) during a median follow-up of 8.4
years (range 1.8-30.0). Adjusting for a median of six confounders, SMI patients had significantly higher CVD incidence than controls in longi-
tudinal studies (hazard ratio, HR51.78, 95% CI: 1.60-1.98; 31 studies). The incidence was also higher for coronary heart disease (HR51.54,
95% CI: 1.30-1.82), cerebrovascular disease (HR51.64, 95% CI: 1.26-2.14), congestive heart failure (HR52.10, 95% CI: 1.64-2.70), and CVD-
related death (HR51.85, 95% CI: 1.53-2.24). People with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia were all at increased
risk of CVD-related death versus controls. CVD incidence increased with antipsychotic use (p50.008), higher body mass index (p50.008) and
higher baseline CVD prevalence (p50.03) in patients vs. controls. Moreover, CVD prevalence (p50.007), but not CVD incidence (p50.21),
increased in more recently conducted studies. This large-scale meta-analysis confirms that SMI patients have significantly increased risk of
CVD and CVD-related mortality, and that elevated body mass index, antipsychotic use, and CVD screening and management require urgent
clinical attention.
Key words: Cardiovascular disease, severe mental illness, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, coronary heart disease, cere-
brovascular disease, congestive heart failure, premature mortality
(World Psychiatry 2017;16:163–180)
People with severe mental illness (SMI) – including schizo-
phrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and their
related spectrum disorders – have a life expectancy shortened
of 10-17.5 years compared to the general population1,2. While
suicide explains some of this reduced life expectancy3, it is
now established that physical diseases account for the over-
whelming majority of premature mortality4,5. Among physical
conditions, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main potentially
avoidable contributor to early deaths in patients with SMI4.
Given the importance of understanding the magnitude,
contributors to and relative distribution of CVD risk in people
with SMI, a number of disease-specific meta-analyses investi-
gated if people with major depressive disorder, bipolar disor-
der or schizophrenia are at an increased risk of CVD compared
to controls. These meta-analyses reported that people with
depression (defined by the presence of depressive symptoms
or a diagnosis of major depressive disorder) are at increased
CVD risk6,7, including stroke (risk ratio, RR51.34, 95% CI:
1.17-1.54), myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, HR51.31, 95%
CI: 1.09-1.57), coronary heart disease (RR51.36, 95% CI:
1.24-1.49) and coronary heart disease-related death (HR51.36,
95% CI: 1.14-1.63)6-8. While clearly informative, results concern-
ing CVD were not specific for major depressive disorder defined
according to established diagnostic criteria, possibly biasing
such observed association towards a lower risk9. Another
meta-analysis of longitudinal studies, which utilized standard-
ized criteria to define bipolar disorder, reported mixed results,
since people with that disorder were actually not at increased
risk of myocardial infarction (RR51.09, 95% CI: 0.96-1.24),
whereas the risk of stroke was higher compared to controls
(RR51.74, 95% CI: 1.29-2.35)10. Among individuals with schiz-
ophrenia, previous meta-analyses11,12 reported an overall
increased risk of CVD compared to controls (RR51.53, 95% CI:
1.27-1.86). This risk increase included stroke (up to RR51.71,
World Psychiatry 16:2 - June 2017

 95% CI: 1.19-2.46) and heart failure (RR51.81, 95% CI: 1.42-2.29),
but not coronary heart disease (RR51.20, 95% CI: 0.93-1.53).
While the existing literature has provided relevant insights,
several limitations are to be highlighted and important questions
remain unanswered. First, some of the previous meta-analyses
did not use standardized clinical assessments to identify and
categorize SMI and/or cardiovascular events. Second, the exact
prevalence and incidence of each type of CVD among people
with SMI, both within and across major diagnostic SMI sub-
groups, remains unclear. Third, the magnitude of premature
CVD-related mortality risk in people with SMI versus controls
is to be specified. Fourth, potential risk factors for increased
CVD and related mortality risk across the SMI groups have not
been elucidated via meta-analytic techniques, which could
help identify targets for treatment guidelines, clinical stand-
ards and development of preventive and therapeutic pro-
grams. In this regard, large-scale pooled analyses in the SMI
population can provide relevant information, allowing the
investigation of potentially shared risk factors across many
studies and participants, thus dissecting CVD risk factors asso-
ciated with SMI and/or treatments for these disorders from
factors which are non-specific or shared with the general pop-
ulation13. Additionally, pooling of data allows for the investiga-
tion of demographic, regional and treatment variables, both
within and across major diagnostic categories.
Given the caveats mentioned above, the current gaps within
the literature and the need to better understand CVD risk among
people with SMI, we conducted a large scale meta-analysis
investigating the prevalence, incidence and mortality attributed
to CVD and their correlates among people with SMI, both
within and across major diagnostic groups.
METHODS
This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the
PRISMA statement14, following a predetermined, but unpub-
lished protocol.
Search strategy
An electronic literature search was conducted in PubMed,
Embase and Scopus from database inception until August 2,
2016 by two independent reviewers, using the search terms
(“bipolar disorder” OR mania OR schizophrenia OR schizoaffec-
tive OR psychosis OR “major depression” OR “serious mental
illness”) AND (cardiovascular OR stroke OR cerebrovascular OR
“transient ischemic attack” OR “transient ischaemic attack” OR
“peripheral vascular” OR “myocardial infarction” OR “coronary
heart disease” OR” coronary artery disease” OR “ischemic heart
disease” OR “ischaemic heart disease” OR “hypertensive heart
disease” OR angina OR “cardiac failure” OR “heart failure” OR
“congestive heart failure” OR “atrial fibrillation” OR “pulmonary
embolism” OR “cardiovascular mortality”). Furthermore, bibli-
ographies of included papers were reviewed.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We included studies with the following characteristics: a)
reporting on patients with schizophrenia, schizophrenia spec-
trum or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or bipolar
spectrum disorders, major depressive disorder or depressive
episodes, or SMI (defined as at least two among major depres-
sive spectrum, bipolar spectrum and schizophrenia spectrum
disorders) according to DSM-III, DSM-IV, DSM-5, ICD-8, ICD-
9 or ICD-10, or a medical record diagnosis based on a clinical
interview; b) having a cross-sectional or a retrospective/
prospective longitudinal design, either with or without a control
group; c) using a standardized definition of CVD; d) reporting RR,
HR or odds ratio (OR) comparing patients with region-specific
controls, percentage or number of events at baseline (data used
for cross-sectional analysis 5 prevalence) and/or follow-up (data
used for longitudinal analysis5 cumulative incidence).
We excluded studies that investigated cardiovascular risk
estimates and/or factors, subclinical CVD, or SMI rates in pop-
ulations with CVD. In case of multiple publications from the
same study, only the most recent paper or the article with the
longest follow-up was included. When required, we contacted
the primary/corresponding authors of potential studies to
confirm eligibility or acquire unpublished variables of interest.
Data extraction
Seven authors divided in four pairs independently extracted
data in a standardized Microsoft Excel sheet, with reciprocal
validation of data extraction results. The extracted data includ-
ed: authors, year and country; geographic region; study design;
data source; period of data collection; SMI diagnostic criteria;
CVD diagnostic criteria; specific SMI and CVD diagnosis; case
and control inclusion criteria; number of cases and controls;
percentage or number with CVD, coronary heart disease, cere-
brovascular disease and congestive heart failure at baseline;
number of events at follow-up; follow-up duration; number
and type of covariates considered in the analyses; OR, RR, rate
ratio and HR with their respective 95% upper and lower CIs;
mean age with standard deviation; mean body mass index
with standard deviation; proportion of males; co-occurring
obesity, alcohol and substance related disorders, diabetes,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia; married status; employ-
ment status; percentage of patients with poorest income and
least urbanized; and percentage of patients taking antipsy-
chotics. Rate ratios calculated with Cox regression models
were included in HR analyses. When authors did not specify
whether or not a rate ratio had been calculated with Cox
regression models, we contacted them seeking clarification.
Outcomes
Primary outcomes were CVD prevalence and cumulative
incidence plus CVD-related mortality in people with SMI, as
164
World Psychiatry 16:2 - June 2017
 well as adjusted OR for prevalence and HR for incidence rates
in SMI versus controls. Secondary outcomes were the same
measures for specific CVDs (i.e., coronary heart disease, cere-
brovascular disease, congestive heart failure) in SMI patients,
as well as adjusted OR and HR versus controls.
Prevalence and OR were calculated from cross-sectional
studies and from baseline results of longitudinal studies.
Where available, incidence, RR and HR were calculated from
longitudinal studies.
Quality assessment
For the purpose of this meta-analysis, a checklist (yes versus
no) was used to assess the methodological quality of included
studies. The evaluation of methodological quality across stud-
ies was based on the following factors: clear diagnostic criteria,
presence of a control group, matching of the control group,
covariate-adjusted outcomes, reported cardiovascular risk fac-
tors at baseline, and follow-up �5 years.
Data analysis
This meta-analysis was performed using Comprehensive
Meta-Analysis V315. All outcomes were meta-analyzed when at
least two studies provided data. A random effects model16,17
was used to account for between-study heterogeneity. We cal-
culated pooled CVD prevalences and pooled CVD cumulative
incidences, each with SMI subgrouping. For dichotomous pri-
mary and secondary outcomes comparing pooled SMI and
SMI subgroups with controls, we calculated unadjusted as
well as adjusted pooled OR for cross-sectional data, and unad-
justed pooled RR, as well as adjusted pooled HR, for longitudi-
nal data. Funnel plots were visually inspected, and Egger’s
test18 and Begg-Mazumdar Kendall’s tau19 were used to deter-
mine if publication bias was likely. When publication bias was
present, the trim and fill20 procedure was run to evaluate if the
results changed after imputing potentially missing studies.
Between-study heterogeneity was measured using the chi-
squared and I-squared statistics, with chi-squared p<0.05 and
I-squared �50% indicating significant heterogeneity21. To iden-
tify potential moderators, meta-regression was run with Com-
prehensive Meta-Analysis V3 for unadjusted outcomes where
heterogeneity was significant.
Since CVD rates in the general population vary across the
world, we also performed a stratified analysis across geograph-
ic regions (Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania) regarding
raw CVD prevalence and incidence in SMI populations, and
compared patients to their respective region-specific general
population controls (calculating RRs as well as adjusted ORs
and HRs for the four regional strata and comparing them
across the different regions whenever at least two studies pro-
vided data per each region).
The following study and patient characteristics were explor-
ed as potential moderators and mediators in addition to SMI
status: geographical region of the sample; time of data collec-
tion; percentage of patients taking antipsychotics; and the dif-
ference between patient and control samples regarding age,
body mass index, proportion of males and of those with married
status, unemployed, with poorest income, least urbanized, and
having co-occurring obesity, alcohol and substance-related dis-
orders, diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidemia.
RESULTS
Search results
Out of 18,064 initial hits across the searched electronic
databases, 11,878 unduplicated hits were screened, and 11,576
were excluded through title/abstract reading. Altogether, 302
full texts were reviewed, and 210 were excluded with specific
reasons. Among 92 studies meeting inclusion criteria, 27 had a
cross-sectional design22-48 and 65 studies had a retrospective
or prospective longitudinal design49-113 (Figure 1).
Characteristics of included studies
We included 92 studies, with a total population of 3,211,768
patients (mean age 50 years, 49%
male) with SMI and
113,383,368 controls (mean age 51 years, 49% male), with a total
of 116,595,136 subjects when summing those studies where
patient and control sample sizes were not separately reported.
Altogether, 27 studies (N527,037,943) were cross-sectional and
65 studies (N589,557,193) were longitudinal. Overall, 38 studies
included patients with schizophrenia (of which 29 were longitu-
dinal), 30 with bipolar disorder (21 longitudinal), 30 with major
depressive disorder (22 longitudinal), and 14 with SMI (8 longitu-
dinal). Taken together, six studies included only patients with
SMI (N5884,412), 16 studies included only patients with bipolar
disorder (N571,832), 20 studies included only patients with
major depressive disorder (N5111,360), and 29 studies includ-
ed only patients with schizophrenia (N51,591,106), while 19
studies included different subgroups of SMI, providing data for
each of them separately (some studies included more than
one diagnostic group, see Tables 1 and 2 for details).
Meta-analysis: cross-sectional results
The pooled CVD prevalence in SMI was 9.9% (95% CI: 7.4-13.3;
38 studies). Individual rates were 8.4% for people with bipolar
disorder (95% CI: 5.4-12.6, 12 studies, N566,911); 11.7% for
those with major depressive disorder (95% CI: 3.6-32.2, 7 stud-
ies, N583,965); 11.8% for those with schizophrenia (95% CI:
7.1-19.0, 13 studies, N5191,982), and 11.8% for those with SMI
(95% CI: 4.1-29.4, 6 studies, N517,286) (p<0.001 for SMI diag-
nostic subgroup comparisons).
Adjusting for a median of seven potential confounders, the
adjusted pooled OR for CVD in SMI compared to controls was
World Psychiatry 16:2 - June 2017
165
 1.53 (95% CI: 1.27-1.83, p<0.001, 11 studies). For specific
CVDs, pooled together, people with SMI had an increased risk
of coronary heart disease (OR51.51, 95% CI: 1.47-1.55,
p<0.001, 5 studies) and cerebrovascular disease (OR51.42,
95% CI: 1.21-1.66, p<0.001, 6 studies), with a strong statistical
trend for congestive heart failure (OR51.28, 95% CI: 0.99-1.65,
p50.06, 4 studies). Considering separately single types of SMI
and CVD, in adjusted OR analyses, bipolar disorder was not
significantly associated with CVD or its subtypes; major
depressive disorder was significantly associated with CVD and
coronary heart disease; and schizophrenia was significantly
associated with coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular dis-
ease and congestive heart failure (Table 3). No adjusted ORs
were available for mixed SMI groups.
All significant results were significantly heterogeneous. After
adjusting for publication bias with the trim-and-fill method, all
pooled previously significant ORs remained statistically signifi-
cant, confirming the association of CVD, coronary heart disease
and cerebrovascular disease with SMI, while the OR for conges-
tive heart failure became marginally significant (p50.05).
Meta-analysis: longitudinal adjusted results
Among patients with SMI, 3.6% (95% CI: 2.7-5.3%) experi-
enced a CVD event during a median follow-up period of 8.4
years (range 1.8-30.0) (65 studies). After adjusting for a median
of six potential confounders, people with SMI were at signifi-
cantly increased risk across longitudinal studies for CVD
(HR51.78, 95% CI: 1.60-1.98) (31 studies, N5671,384 cases vs.
N514,335,203 controls) as well as for specific CVDs, including
coronary heart disease (HR51.54, 95% CI: 1.30-1.82, 18 studies,
N5194,017 cases vs. N513,530,858 controls), cerebrovascular

 disease (HR51.64, 95% CI: 1.26-2.14, 11 studies, N5188,841
cases vs. N513,113,564 controls), congestive heart failure
(HR52.10, 95% CI: 1.64-2.70, 2 studies, N5409 cases vs.
N541,678 controls), peripheral vascular disease (only unad-
justed RR53.11, 95% CI: 2.46-3.91, three studies), and CVD-
related death (HR51.85, 95% CI: 1.53-2.24, 16 studies, N5353,407
cases vs. N57,317,053 controls).
According to adjusted HRs, schizophrenia was significantly
associated with CVD in longitudinal studies (HR51.95, 95%
CI: 1.41-2.70, 14 studies), as well as with coronary heart dis-
ease (HR51.59, 95% CI: 1.08-2.35, 5 studies), cerebrovascular
disease (HR51.57, 95% CI: 1.09-2.25, 5 studies), and CVD-
related death (HR52.45, 95% CI: 1.64-3.65, 9 studies).
According to adjusted HRs, bipolar disorder was significant-
ly associated with CVD in longitudinal studies (HR51.57, 95%
CI: 1.28-1.93, 10 studies) as well as with CVD-related death
(HR51.65, 95% CI: 1.10-2.47, 3 studies), with a trend toward a
significant association with cerebrovascular disease (HR51.60,
95% CI: 0.99-2.57, 4 studies), but no significant association
with coronary heart disease (HR51.16, 95% CI: 0.76-1.78, 4
studies). One study reported a significant association with
congestive heart failure (HR 5 2.27, 95% CI: 1.49-3.45).
According to adjusted HRs, major depressive disorder was
significantly associated with CVD in longitudinal studies
(HR51.72, 95% CI: 1.48-2.00, 18 studies) as well as with coro-
nary heart disease (HR51.63, 95% CI: 1.33-2.00, 9 studies),
cerebrovascular disease (HR52.04, 95% CI: 1.05-3.96, 3 stud-
ies), congestive heart failure (HR52.02, 95% CI: 1.48-2.75, 2
studies), and CVD-related death (HR51.63, 95% CI: 1.25-2.13,
7 studies).
According to adjusted HRs, mixed SMIs were significantly
associated with CVD in longitudinal studies (HR53.24, 95%

 CI: 2.15-4.88, 3 studies) as well as with CVD-related death
(HR52.75, 95% CI: 1.32-5.73, 3 studies).
All significant results were significantly heterogeneous,
except for mixed SMI and CVD risk, as well as all the conges-
tive heart failure results. After trim and fill procedure, all
results remained unchanged, and Egger test did not show any
evidence of publication bias influencing the results (see Table
4 for details).
Quality assessment of included studies
Quality ratings of single studies are presented in Table 5. All
studies used clear diagnostic criteria, by design. Among the 27
cross-sectional studies, all except 9 studies had a control group,
5 studies used a matched control sample, 13 studies adjusted
analyses for relevant covariates, and all except 6 studies reported
cardiovascular risk factors. Among the 65 longitudinal studies, all

CVD risk in SMI patients in each region with their respective
control groups, there was no statistically significant difference
anymore across regions, with both RRs and adjusted HRs show-
ing comparably increased CVD incidence risk in the SMI popu-
lation (RRs ranging from 1.17 in Europe to 1.63 in Asia, p50.08;
and HRs ranging from 1.58 in Oceania to 1.88 in both Europe
and North America, p50.29) (Table 6). There were insufficient
numbers of studies to perform this analysis for adjusted ORs

 regarding prevalence rates across regions, or for adjusted ORs,
RRs or HRs pertaining to specific CVD subgroups.
Meta-regression
Due to heterogeneous or partial reporting of possible mod-
erator variables in the included studies, all meta-regression
analyses were based on a much reduced number of studies.
Hence, all analyses were less powered in comparison with the
large sets of data used for cross-sectional prevalence and lon-
gitudinal incidence analyses. Nonetheless, CVD incidence
increased significantly with a higher percentage of patients
using antipsychotics (12 studies; b50.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.08,
p50.008), higher baseline body mass index in patients vs. con-
trols (6 studies; b50.24, 95% CI: 0.06-0.42, p50.008), and
higher CVD prevalence at baseline in patients vs. controls (7
studies; b50.07, 95% CI: 0.01-0.14, p50.03). CVD prevalence
increased in more recent studies (38 studies; b50.07, 95% CI:
0.02-0.12, p50.007), whereas the same was not true for CVD
incidence (65 studies; b5–0.02, 95% CI5–0.07 to 0.01, p50.21).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first large scale meta-analysis
providing comprehensive quantitative data on the prevalence
and incidence of CVD in people with SMI, including both
pooled data and comparisons across CVD and SMI diagnostic
subgroups. Our results establish that approximately 10% of
people with SMI with a mean age of 50 years have at least one
comorbid CVD. Moreover, our longitudinal analysis docu-
ments a 3.6% incidence rate of CVD during a median of 8.4
years of follow-up. Patients with SMI show a 53% higher risk
for having CVD, a 78% higher risk for developing CVD, and an
85% higher risk of death from CVD compared to the regionally
matched general population.
This study provides a worldwide epidemiologic representa-
tion of CVD prevalence and incidence rates in SMI, reporting
the lowest absolute prevalence and incidence in Asia, increas-
ing through Europe and North America, and reaching the
highest levels in Oceania. However, in analyses with sufficient
numbers of available studies, neither RRs nor adjusted HRs
indicated significantly different CVD incidence risk across
regions, meaning that SMI patients are at an increased risk
across the world and that CVD risk-reducing interventions in
SMI are needed with the same urgency across all regions of
the world. Moreover, while the prevalence and incidence of
each CVD in people with SMI show some minor variations, peo-
ple with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizo-
phrenia are clearly all at an increased risk of CVD-related deaths
compared to population-stratified controls, calling for urgent
action.
We were able to identify some important and actionable
moderators of increased CVD risk, including antipsychotic
use, elevated body mass index and elevated baseline CVD.
Based on these results, it is imperative that clinicians: a) only
utilize antipsychotics, particularly for non-psychotic condi-
tions, when alternative treatment options with lower CVD risk
potential have been tried sufficiently; and b) screen for and
manage emerging and existing CVDs as well as their risk fac-
tors, including weight gain and elevated body mass index. Our
data, adding to research demonstrating a significantly higher
prevalence of metabolic syndrome in people with SMI com-
pared to controls114, clearly suggest there is an urgent need to
prevent and manage CVD risk in this population.
Our results demonstrating a higher CVD prevalence in SMI
populations versus controls in more recent studies are also
concerning, as they support accumulating data indicating that
secondary prevention has been much less successful in the
SMI population that in the general population, leading to a
widening of the mortality gap in recent years49,115,116. Our
findings confirm prior reports that antipsychotic medication
use is associated with higher CVD risk13,117,118. However, due
to limitations in the published data, we were unable to explore
variations in CVD risk profiles between different antipsychotic
medications13,117-120. Previous research has suggested that the
highest cardio-metabolic risks are associated with clozapine
and olanzapine, whilst the lowest risk is with aripiprazole,
ziprasidone, lurasidone, amisulpride and high potency typical
antipsychotics13,117-122. However, in this context it is also
important to note that antipsychotic medications can decrease
CVD-related mortality, as reported for example in Finnish79
and Swedish123 national database studies, that are highly gen-
eralizable. These data underscore that symptom control and
functional improvement benefit both psychiatric and overall
health, as severe psychiatric illness negatively affects lifestyle
behaviors, medical care seeking and adherence to medical
treatments. Thus, benefits of improved psychiatric status with
antipsychotics and other psychotropic agents need to be care-
fully weighed against their potential for elevated cardiometa-
bolic risk, which differs across available agents13,117.
Since antipsychotic medication use moderates CVD risk and
since antipsychotics are increasingly used as first line treatments
for much more prevalent non-psychotic conditions, including
bipolar disorder124 and major depressive disorder with subopti-
mal response to antidepressant treatment125, the pool of people
at an increased CVD risk is greatly enlarged. Therefore, research
on the underlying mechanisms for the increased CVD risk after
pharmacotherapy initiation is even more urgently needed to
develop more effective and targeted preventive and intervention-
al treatments. Studies should also examine whether different
clinical subtypes of depression (i.e., melancholic, psychotic,
atypical or undifferentiated) and bipolar disorder (e.g., type 1 or
2, cyclothymic disorder), certain mood states (manic, depressive,
mixed or euthymic), or different antipsychotics, antidepressants
or mood stabilizers13 significantly moderate CVD risk.
Furthermore, the pathophysiology underlying the associa-
tion between SMI and CVD risk is complex and not well
understood, clearly requiring further investigation. Emerging
176
World Psychiatry 16:2 - June 2017
 evidence suggests that SMI and CVD share pathophysiological
features, including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and mito-
chondrial dysfunction, peripheral immune activation, neuro-
inflammation, oxidative and nitrosative stress, as well as com-
mon genetic links and epigenetic interactions126. However,
since these different mechanisms probably interact, research
that integrates these pathways is urgently needed. Beyond
mechanistic evaluations, such studies also need to investigate
the general and specific effects of physical health improve-
ments on SMI outcomes.
Future research should also investigate optimal monitoring
regimens across stratified patient subgroups as well as the most
effective timing and efficacy of primary, secondary and tertiary
preventive interventions120,127. In this regard, studies should
comprehensively assess relevant moderator and mediator varia-
bles of CVD risk, including type and duration of specific psy-
chotropic medications use, physical activity (including using
passive monitoring via actimetry or mobile phone technology),
diet, smoking, body mass index, personal and family history of
CVD, in order to identify subgroups of patients who may require
different monitoring and or interventions schemes. Long-term
follow-up studies are also required to accurately document the
emergence of more distal physical and mental health as well as
health economic outcomes in relationship to the early identifi-
cation and management of CVD risk factors and manifest CVD
conditions in people with SMI.
Finally, since people with SMI engage in unhealthy lifestyle
and often take psychotropic medication for extensive periods,
long-term follow-up studies are needed that assess whether
current predictor models based on the magnitude of tradition-
al CVD risk factor effects observed in the general population
apply or need to be adjusted for the SMI population93, in
whom CVD risk factors also emerge at a far earlier age117,128.
While this is the most comprehensive meta-analysis of CVD
risk in people with SMI conducted to date, we acknowledge
several limitations that are largely related to factors in the pri-
mary data. First, lifestyle behavior information (e.g., physical
activity) was inadequately reported, precluding meta-analytic
assessment of these important factors as moderating or medi-
ating variables. People with SMI are less likely than the general
population to engage in physical activity and have higher lev-
els of sedentary behaviour129, smoke more130, consume diets
that are high in saturated fats and refined sugars, while being
low in fruit and vegetables131, all factors relevant for CVD risk.
Second, variables such as clinical subtypes of major depressive
disorder and bipolar disorder, negative symptom severity in
people with schizophrenia, and concomitant or previous use
of specific antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabil-
izers were not reported or were insufficiently reported or con-
trolled for in most available studies. Third, as expected when
combining observational data132, many of the results were
moderately to highly heterogeneous. However, in accordance
with the MOOSE guidelines133, we conducted meta-regression
analyses and were able to explain some of the observed het-
erogeneity. In addition, all of our results remained robust after
adjustment for potential publication bias with the trim and fill
analysis.
In conclusion, SMIs pooled together were significantly
associated in cross-sectional studies with CVD, coronary heart
disease, cerebrovascular disease and CVD-related death. Addi-
tionally, in longitudinal studies, each specific diagnostic SMI
group was significantly associated with CVD and CVD-related
death. Furthermore, schizophrenia was associated with coro-
nary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, while bipolar dis-
order was associated with congestive heart failure, and major
depressive disorder was associated with coronary heart disease,
cerebrovascular disease, and congestive heart failure.
Importantly, our data confirm that CVDs are associated with
an increased risk of mortality in people with SMI, which to a
large part explains the shortened life expectancy of people with
SMI compared to the general population2,4,5. Furthermore, we
showed geographical variations in raw CVD prevalence and inci-
dence risk in SMI populations, but no significant regional vari-
ance in the difference in CVD risk compared to the region-
specific general population. Finally, the fact that antipsychotic
use, higher body mass index and baseline CVD significantly
increased the risk for CVD morbidity and mortality underscores
the urgent need to limit antipsychotic use to those populations
truly requiring them, choosing the lowest risk antipsychotic
agents first in the treatment algorithm, screening all SMI patients
regularly for CVD risk factors and conditions, and addressing any
identified abnormalities aggressively.
