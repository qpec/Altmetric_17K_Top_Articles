Eff
 ectiveness of personalised risk information and taster 
sessions to increase the uptake of smoking cessation services 
(Start2quit): a randomised controlled trial
Hazel Gilbert, Stephen Sutton, Richard Morris, Irene Petersen, Simon Galton, Qi Wu, Steve Parrott, Irwin Nazareth
Summary
Background National Health Service Stop Smoking Services (SSSs) off
 er help to smokers motivated to quit; however, 
attendance rates are low and recent fi
 gures show a downward trend. We aimed to assess the eff
 ectiveness of a 
two-component personalised intervention on attendance at SSSs.
Methods We did this randomised controlled trial in 18 SSSs in England. Current smokers (aged ≥16 years) were 
identifi
 ed from medical records in 99 general practices and invited to participate by their general practitioner. Individuals 
who gave consent, were motivated to quit, and had not attended the SSS within the past 12 months, were randomly 
assigned (3:2), via computer-generated randomisation with permuted blocks (block size of fi
 ve), to receive either an 
individually tailored risk letter and invitation to attend a no-commitment introductory session run by the local SSS 
(intervention group) or a standard generic letter advertising the local SSS (control group). Randomisation was stratifi
 ed 
by sex. Masking of participants to receipt of a personal letter and invitation to a taster session was not possible. The 
personal letter was generated by a research assistant, but the remainder of the research team were masked to group 
allocation. General practitioners, practice staff
 , and SSS advisers were unaware of their patients’ allocation. The primary 
outcome was attendance at the fi
 rst session of an SSS course within 6 months from randomisation. We did analysis by 
intention to treat. This trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN 76561916.
Findings Recruitment, collection of baseline data, delivery of the intervention, and follow up of participants took place 
between Jan 31, 2011, and July 12, 2014. We randomly assigned 4384 smokers to the intervention group (n=2636) or 
the control group (n=1748); 4383 participants comprised the intention-to-treat population. Attendance at the 
fi
 rst session of an SSS course was signifi
 cantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (458 [17·4%] 
vs 158 [9·0%] participants; unadjusted odds ratio 2·12 [95% CI 1·75–2·57]; p<0·0001).
Interpretation Delivery of personalised risk information alongside an invitation to an introductory session more than 
doubled the odds of attending the SSS compared with a standard generic invitation to contact the service. This result 
suggests that a more proactive approach, combined with an opportunity to experience local services, can reduce 
patient barriers to receiving treatment and has high potential to increase uptake.

Introduction
Smoking is the leading cause of preventable ill health and 
premature mortality, accounting for more than 5 million 
deaths annually worldwide1 and 80 000 deaths in England.2 
Although the prevalence of smoking in the adult 
population in Great Britain has fallen by more than half 
since 1974, the fall has slowed and changed little since 
2007
.3 The total direct cost to the National Health Service 
(NHS) of treating smoking-related disease was estimated 
at £5·2 billion in 2005–06 (£6·1 billion by 2016  prices).4
Government-funded 
specialist 
smoking 
cessation 
services, now known as NHS Stop Smoking Services 
(SSSs), were established by primary care trusts throughout 
England in 2000,5 to help and support smokers to quit. 
These services are eff
 ective,6,7 with quit rates of around 
35% at 4 weeks.8 This quit rate is higher than if the 
smokers attending SSSs had received only a prescription 
for a stop smoking medication.8 However, despite the 
increased probability of success, fewer than 5% of smokers 
attend the SSS each year and, since 2012, fi
 gures have 
shown a continuing downward trend.9,10 Anecdotal 
evidence suggests that the increasing use of e-cigarettes as 
a stop smoking aid could account for this trend.10
Although general practitioners (GPs) and other health 
practitioners are encouraged to off
 er brief advice and to 
refer smokers to these services, as few as 8% of 
individuals report being referred.11 Moreover, smokers 
are generally expected to follow-up their referral and 
contact the service themselves to make the appointment,12 
and a wide range of factors can deter smokers from 
seeking help. Direct marketing approaches involving 
proactive and personalised invitations to use the services 
are acceptable to smokers and could result in an increase 
in uptake.13–15 A UK study16 reported a 7·7% absolute

increase in smokers attending the SSS when a proactive 
method of recruitment was used to attract smokers into 
the services.
Smokers underestimate their own personal risk of 
illness compared with that of other smokers;17 thus, a key 
aim in motivating smokers to make a quit attempt is to 
persuade them that these risks are personally relevant. 
Computer tailoring uses information about individual 
characteristics to personalise and tailor communications,18 
and individually tailored self-help materials can have a 
small but useful eff
 ect over generic materials for smoking 
cessation.19 Tailored smoking cessation advice can also 
include personalised risk communication based on an 
individual’s own risk factors, which is more relevant than 
information about population average risks.20 Individual 
risk information can also arouse fear or concern, which 
might prompt a quit attempt, particularly when 
combined with a reassuring message that adoption of the 
recommended action would be eff
 ective.21,22 The Health 
Belief Model emphasises the importance of provision of 
a specifi
 c cue to action, which can act as a trigger and 
increase adoption of the recommended behaviour.23 This 
combination of hard-hitting “why quit” messages about 
the consequences of tobacco use, and supportive and 
positive “how to quit” messages, emphasising quitting 
resources, has been shown to be eff
 ective in some mass 
media campaigns.24,25 Additionally, smokers might be 
deterred from seeking help because of low awareness or 
inadequate information about available services.26 
Off
 ering a no-commitment introductory session as a way 
to experience the service can build awareness of, and 
comfort with, the quitting services.24 This approach, 
combined with personalised communications to patients, 
has the potential to engage with a larger proportion of 
the smoking population.15
We did the Start2quit trial to assess the eff
 ectiveness 
of a two-component personalised intervention on 
attendance at the SSS, and on biochemically validated 
7 day point-prevalent abstinence.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did this randomised controlled trial in 18 SSS areas 
in England, with 99 general practices within the SSS 
areas. The trial was originally funded for 48 months, with 
plans to recruit practices from ten SSSs. Additional 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Few published studies have investigated novel methods of 
referral to a stop smoking service (SSS), and the present study 
was initiated in response to a National Institutes of Health 
Research Health Technology Assessment call to quantify the 
eff
 ect of new interventions on the numbers of smokers using 
National Health Service (NHS) smoking cessation services. In 
planning this trial, we identifi
 ed studies suggesting that the 
direct marketing approach has potential as a population-based 
strategy for recruitment of smokers into support services, and 
that interpersonal strategies have a positive eff
 ect on 
recruitment into smoking cessation programmes. However, only 
two previous studies used proactive methods of recruitment and 
referral to inform smokers about such services. Lichtenstein and 
Hollis’ study done in the USA combined a proactive approach 
with an introductory session, and the study by Murray and 
colleagues was the fi
 rst in the UK to assess a proactive method of 
recruitment to attract smokers into the SSS. We built on these 
two studies by use of evidence from the Cochrane reviews that 
individually tailored self-help materials have a small, but useful, 
eff
 ect over generic materials on smoking cessation, and that the 
addition of personalised risk communication that is more 
personally relevant to the consumer has been found to increase 
uptake of screening.
Since the start of our study, research has been published 
showing that proactive off
 ering of the services of telephone 
quitlines can result in an increase in uptake, and a systematic 
review of recruitment methods for smoking cessation 
programmes suggested that personal tailored messages and 
proactive and intensive recruitment strategies can enhance 
recruitment. More recently, a published study showing that a 
more proactive approach of Ask-Advise-Connect, whereby 
smokers are contacted proactively by the service upon receipt 
of their contact information, can reduce patient barriers to 
receiving treatment, and also has high potential to increase 
uptake.
Added value of this study
We extended the work of Murray and colleagues by providing a 
more intensive intervention, using computer-tailored feedback 
to deliver personalised risk information to invite and encourage 
people to attend the NHS SSS. To our knowledge, no other 
study has assessed the eff
 ects of this combined intervention in 
smokers. Our results add to the evidence of Lichtenstein and 
Hollis and of Murray and colleagues, in a larger trial, showing 
that personalised risk information alongside an invitation to an 
introductory session can increase the use of stop smoking 
services and lead to increased quit rates.
Implications of all the available evidence
SSSs off
 er smokers a substantially higher chance of stopping 
smoking than does attempting to quit without support. 
The evidence suggests that a programme of proactive 
recruitment can be eff
 ective in raising awareness of the SSS, 
and personal invitations off
 er an opportunity to promote 
the services in the form of introductory sessions to 
emphasise its approachability and empathy. Further 
research is needed to distinguish the eff
 ects of the 
two components of the intervention.

funding was approved in July, 2012, 2 years after the 
initial funding of the trial by the National Institute for 
Health Research (NIHR), to increase the sample size to 
allow suffi
  cient power to assess the main secondary 
outcome of 7 day point-prevalent abstinence. The study 
did not otherwise deviate from the original protocol.
The NIHR England Primary Care Research Network 
recruited SSSs and practices. We targeted areas of high 
deprivation with large ethnic minority populations, in 
which smoking prevalence is high. Current smokers 
were identifi
 ed from medical records in participating 
practices. GPs screened these records to exclude any 
severely or terminally ill individuals. Those remaining 
on the list were sent an invitation letter from their GP to 
participate, together with a participant information sheet, 
a consent form, and a screening questionnaire. Only one 
participant per household was invited to participate. 
Eligible individuals were aged 16 years or older, could 
read English, were motivated to quit, and had not 
attended the SSS in the previous 12 months. Motivation 
to quit was defi
 ned as an individual answering “yes” to 
either or both of two questions: are you seriously thinking 
of quitting in the next 6 months? Would you think of 
quitting if appropriate help were off
 ered at a convenient 
time and place? The screening questionnaire assessed 
eligibility, demographics, self-reported health, nicotine 
dependence, smoking history, determination and 
confi
 dence to quit. We sought consent to use information 
from medical records and from the screening 
questionnaire to generate personal messages about 
quitting, and for researchers to access data for SSS 
attendance. Non-responders were sent a reminder and 
duplicate questionnaire after 3 weeks. Eligible smokers 
who returned the questionnaire and signed the consent 
form were randomly assigned to the intervention or 
control groups. Patients had the opportunity to decline 
participation, but to return the questionnaire with basic 
information to update their smoking status in their 
medical records.
The protocol was approved by the South West London 
Research Ethics Committee.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly assigned (3:2) within 
practice, 
via 
computer-generated 
permuted 
block 
randomisation (block size of fi
 ve), to receive either an 
individually tailored risk letter and invitation to attend a 
no-commitment “come and try” introductory session run 
by the local SSS or a standard generic letter advertising 
the local SSS. Randomisation was stratifi
 ed by sex. The 
use of a computer program that implemented 
randomisation after consent and baseline data entry 
ensured that allocation was concealed and selection bias 
eliminated. The same computer program combined the 
data from the baseline questionnaire and from patient 
medical records with the correct messages from a 
message library to generate tailored letters and invitations 
to the taster session for participants assigned to the 
intervention group, and the generic letters for those 
assigned to the control group.
Masking of participants to receipt of a personal letter 
and invitation to a taster session was not possible. 
Although the personal letter was generated in the practice 
by a research assistant, the remainder of the research 
team were masked to group allocation. In follow-up 
interviews, the interviewer was masked to the allocation 
of the respondent to avoid bias in outcome assessment. 
Interviewers could become unmasked during the course 
of the interview by information volunteered by the 
participants; however, the main outcome questions were 
asked at the start of the interview. GPs, practice staff
 , and 
SSS advisers were not aware of their patients’ allocation. 
Randomisation at the level of participant rather than by 
practice meant there was a slight risk of contamination 
by communication between patients at the same practice 
allocated to diff
 erent intervention groups. This risk was 
reduced by only one person from the same household 
being invited to participate.
Procedures
Participants allocated to the control group were sent a 
standard generic letter from the GP practice, which 
advertised the local SSS and asked the smoker to contact 
the service to make an appointment to see an adviser. 
Participants allocated to the intervention group received 
a brief personalised and tailored letter sent from the GP 
that included information specifi
 c to the patient, obtained 
via the screening questionnaire and from their medical 
records; a personal invitation and appointment to attend 
a “come and try it” taster session to fi
 nd out more about 
the services, run by advisers from the local SSS; and a 
repeated personal letter with a further invitation 
3 months after the original for participants who did not 
attend a taster session after the fi
 rst letter and invitation.
The aims of the letter were to communicate personal 
risk level of serious illness if the individual continued to 
smoke, by use of personalised information, and to 
encourage attendance at the SSS. The letter was 
accompanied by a personal invitation to a taster session 
held roughly 2 weeks after the invitation was mailed, 
with details of time and place. The recipient did not have 
to book an appointment, just to turn up at the specifi
 ed 
time. The goals of the taster session were to provide 
information, to promote the SSS, to address any concerns 
or queries participants might have had, and to encourage 
sign up to a course. This session was not intended to 
replicate the fi
 rst session of an SSS course. The appendix 
provides a full description of the intervention.
At the end of the 6 month follow-up period in each 
SSS, attendance data were collected from the SSSs using 
NHS monitoring data. Additionally, a computer-assisted 
telephone interview was done 6 months after the date of 
randomisation by research interviewers, independent 
from the service providers, to assess self-reported SSS

attendance, current smoking status, and other outcome 
data. If no response was received or if the participant was 
unable to complete the telephone interview, a paper 
version of the follow-up questionnaire was sent by post. 
If a participant did not wish to complete the telephone 
interview or paper questionnaire, the interviewer 
attempted to ask four basic questions relevant to the 
primary and main secondary outcome. The number of 
participants attending the taster sessions was derived 
from records of attendance. Participants claiming 
abstinence at follow-up were asked to provide a salivary 
cotinine sample by post, by use of a saliva sample kit,27 to 
biochemically validate 7 day point-prevalent abstinence,28 
with a cotinine cutoff
  concen 
tration of 12 ng/mL.29 Use of 
nicotine replacement therapy and e-cigarettes at the time 
of the sample was assessed by questionnaire. Returned 
saliva samples were packaged in dry ice and posted to 
Salimetrics (Newmarket, Suff
 olk, UK)—an independent 
laboratory specialising in analysis of biological samples. 
The appendix shows details of the timing of assessments, 
intervention, and follow-up.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was attendance at the fi
 rst 
session of a 6 week SSS course, over a period of 6 months 
from the receipt of the invitation letter, measured by 
records of attendance at the SSSs. The main secondary 
outcome measure was 7 day point-prevalent abstinence at 
6 months’ follow-up, validated by salivary cotinine. Other 
secondary outcome measures were additional periods of 
abstinence (24 h and 7 day point-prevalent, 1 month and 
3 month prolonged) measured by self-report, and 
validated 3 month prolonged abstinence; self-reported 
quit attempts and changes from baseline in daily cigarette 
consumption, and in motivation and intention to quit in 
continuing smokers; and the number of participants 
completing the 6 week SSS course.
Process measures included the number of smokers 
attending the taster session, and the perception of both 
the personal risk letter and of the taster session, based on 
questions included in the telephone interview at the 
6 month follow-up.
Economic evaluation was done alongside the trial 
to 
estimate 
short-term 
cost-eff
 ectiveness 
of 
the 
two interventions from an NHS and personal social 
services perspective, as recommended by National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance.30 
We estimated the costs of provision of the interventions 
and the costs of patients’ use of health and social care 
services. Costs were expressed in pounds sterling (£)  
 
at a 
2012–13 price base. The primary outcome for the economic 
evaluation was assessed in terms of quality-adjusted life-
years (QALYs) based on patients’ responses to the EuroQol 
fi
 ve dimensions (EQ-5D) health-related quality-of-life 
questionnaires.31 We did an additional model-based 
analysis to extrapolate the expected lifetime cost-
eff
 ectiveness of the intervention compared with control.
Anonymised data comprising sex, date of birth 
(converted to age at the time of the invitation), and home 
postcode (converted to an Index of Multiple Deprivation 
[IMD] score—the government’s offi
  cial measure of 
multiple deprivation at small area level32) of patients 
invited to participate in the study, but who declined or 
did not respond, were collected to establish the external 
validity of our results.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis plan is available online. On the 
basis of evidence from a study by Murray and colleagues,16 
we conservatively estimated an increase in SSS 
attendance of 4·6% (from 8·9% to 13·5%; odds ratio 
[OR] 1·65), requiring 1029 participants per group 
(n=2058) to detect a statistically signifi
 cant diff
 erence at 
the 5% level with 90% power. We originally planned to 
recruit practices from ten SSSs. The taster sessions in 
each SSS were to be run by the same four advisers, 
comprising 
ten 
therapist 
clusters. 
Thus, 
before 
adjustment for clustering, we would expect 103 patients 
per cluster. We assumed a therapist intraclass correlation 
coeffi
  cient (ICC) of 0·005, requiring further infl
 ation of 
the sample size by a factor of 1·51 in the intervention 
group in which the eff
 ects would occur. Thus, 
1554 participants would receive the tailored letter and 
invitation to the taster session (n=2583), equivalent to a 
randomisation ratio of 3:2.
The study by Murray and colleagues16 also reported 
validated 6 month quit rates of 4% in the intervention 
group versus 2·2% in the control group (a diff
 erence of 
1·8%). Our planned sample size of 2583 participants 
provided less than 80% power to detect a diff
 erence of 
1·8%; however, if the intervention were to cause the quit 
rate to double from 2·2% to 4·4% (diff
 erence of 2·2%) 
there would have still been 80% power to detect such a 
diff
 erence. The trial extension to enable evaluation with 
adequate power of the intervention eff
 ect on 7 day 
point-prevalent abstinence at the 6 month follow-up 
required an 80% increase in the sample size, to 1793 in 
the control group and 2707 in the intervention group 
(n=4500), assuming the same therapist eff
 ect as the 
original protocol. This increase would give 85·4% power 
to detect a diff
 erence of 1·8% at the 5% signifi
 cance level, 
assuming quit rates of 4% in the intervention group and 
2·2% in the control group. The same sample size would 
provide 95% power to detect the diff
 erence between quit 
rates of 4·4% and 2·2% (doubling of quit rate).
Introduction of this particular secondary outcome, in 
view of its importance in assessment of the intervention, 
necessitated the consideration of multiple signifi
 cance 
testing. We therefore planned to split the permitted type 1 
error rate of 0·05 between the original primary outcome 
and this key secondary outcome.
We initially estimated that six practices, with a list size 
of more than 4000 patients, in each of ten SSSs would 
contribute about 240 000 patients and, assuming a

conservative smoking prevalence of 15% in patients aged 
16 years and older, 36 000 smokers. On the basis of 
previous studies,16,33 we estimated a response rate of 7% 
from smokers motivated to quit, from two mailings to 
secure 2520 participants, which would meet the 
requirements of the original sample size calculation. The 
extension 
to 
the 
trial 
required 
an 
additional 
2000 participants and, in view of good recruitment rates 
at the time the extension was funded, we estimated that 
an additional eight SSSs (48 practices) would recruit 
2060 participants, giving a total of 4580 participants and 
meeting the requirement of the new power calculation.
Comparison of proportions was done for binary outcomes 
between the intervention and control groups, by use of 
logistic regression with a random intercept model to allow 
for possible correlation within SSSs. We deemed this 
univariable analysis as primary, but multivariable analysis 
was also done to account for potential imbalance in baseline 
characteristics (sex, age, IMD score, dependence score, 
intention to quit, determination to quit, longest previous 
quit attempt, living with other smokers, and previous SSS 
attendance). Self-reported quit attempts and changes in 
daily cigarette consumption and in motivation and intention 
to quit in continuing smokers were compared descriptively.
We assessed interactions between intervention and 
deprivation (defi
 ned in quintiles), intervention and sex, 
and intervention and age (defi
 ned by categories 
16–39 years, 40–64, and >65 years), for the primary 
outcome and 7 day point-prevalent abstinence at the 
6 month follow-up. Analysis of the interaction by social 
deprivation was specifi
 ed in the original protocol. The 
analyses by sex and age were added when we prepared 
our analysis plan. Planned subsidiary analyses were done 
to examine any delayed eff
 ect of sending repeat reminders 
to smokers on the uptake of service. We also report post-
hoc analyses of diff
 erences in recruitment in SSSs, 
follow-up response, and outcome between SSSs.
The prespecifi
 ed statistical analysis plan, which was 
agreed and approved by the trial steering committee 
before database lock, was strictly adhered to, in keeping 
with International Comparison Program harmonisation. 
We did analysis by intention to treat. For abstinence, the 
standard assumption was that participants lost to 
follow-up were still smoking.34 Analysis was done with 
Stata (version 13). This trial is registered with Current 
Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN 76561916.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. HG, RM, and IP had full access to all the data 
in the study, and HG had fi
 nal responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
Recruitment, collection of baseline data, delivery of the 
intervention, and follow up of participants took place 
between Jan 31, 2011, and July 12, 2014. We randomly 
assigned 4384 participants to the intervention group 
(n=2636) 
or 
to 
the 
control 
group 
(n=1748); 
4383 participants comprised the intention-to-treat 
population (fi

non-participants.
Objective data for attendance at the SSS were obtained 
for all participants from SSSs at the end of the 6 month 
follow-up period. Additional self-report data were 
obtained from 3372 (77%) participants (appendix p 10).

group and n=120 from the control group); samples from 
44 (10%) participants who reported that they had resumed 
smoking between follow-up and returning the sample 
were not analysed. Of the samples analysed, 345 (86·5%) 
were validated (243 [87·0%] of 279 from the intervention 
group and 102 [85·0%] of 120 from the control group]): 
249 (72·1%) samples contained less than 12 ng/mL

replacement therapy, and 60 (17·3%) samples indicated 
use of e-cigarettes. Of the 54 (13·5%) samples not

the 6 week SSS course was likewise signifi
 cantly higher 
in the intervention group than in the control group (14% 
vs 7%; unadjusted OR 2·24 [95% CI 1·81–2·78], p<0·0001; 
table 2). 7 day point-prevalent abstinence at 6 month 
follow-up, validated by salivary cotinine, was signifi
 cantly 
higher in participants in the intervention group than in 
those in the control group (9·0% vs 5·6%; unadjusted 
OR 1·68 [95% CI 1·32–2·15], p<0·0001), as it was for all 
other periods of abstinence measured by self-report, and 
3 month validated prolonged abstinence (table 2).
Cigarette consumption was slightly reduced in 
individuals who continued to smoke, and almost a 
quarter had made a quit attempt (table 3). Intention and 
motivation to quit changed little in continuing smokers, 
with few diff
 erences in these measures between groups 
(table 3).
The intervention eff
 ect was signifi
 cantly greater in 
men than in women for attendance at the SSS and for 
validated 7-day point-prevalent abstinence (table 4). The 
intervention eff
 ect on attendance at the SSS also diff
 ered 
signifi
 cantly by IMD quintile, although this diff
 erence 
was due to attendance being lower in the control group 
for participants in quintiles 2 and 3 rather than higher in 
the intervention group (table 4).
Attendance at the SSS over the 6 months from 
randomisation peaked after the fi
 rst taster sessions, 
with little increase after a repeat invitation was sent 
(appendix p 12). Recruitment rates diff
 ered greatly 
between the SSSs, ranging from 2% to 6%, as did 
follow-up response rates (appendix p 13). Moreover, 
there were large variations between practices within 
SSSs. We deliberately included some practices in areas 
with high ethnic populations, but recruitment was 
especially low in these practices (appendix p 14). We 
recorded some variation in outcome between SSSs. 
Overall attendance between SSSs varied from 2% to 
23% (ICC 0·031 [95% CI 0·01–0·09]), and validated 
7 day abstinence from 2% to 13% (0·034 [0·011–0·096]), 
suggesting that around 3% of participants’ tendency to 
attend and to quit smoking was explained by the SSS in 
which they were located.
Of the 2635 participants in the intervention group 
invited to attend a taster session, 739 (28%) attended. In 
the intervention group, more participants who had 
attended a taster session attended the SSS than those 
who did not (338 [45·7%] of 739 vs 120 [6·3%] of 1896), 
and more participants who attended a taster session and 
the SSS achieved validated 7 day abstinence (97 [28·7%] 
of 338) than those who only attended the taster session 
(40 [10·0%] of 401), or only attended the SSS (21 [17·5%] 
of 120). Participants who did not attend a taster session 
or the SSS had the lowest rates of validated 7 day 
abstinence (78 [4·4%] of 1776 in the intervention group 
and 74 [4·9%] of 1590 in the control group).
Of 2910 (66·4%) participants who completed the 
telephone follow-up, the letter was more often read by 
participants in the intervention group than by those in the 
control group (1517 [87·2%] of 1740 vs 977 [83·5%] of 1170) 
and more participants in the intervention group discussed 
the letter with others (654 [37·5%] vs 348 [29·7%]). The 
personal risk letter was considered to be acceptable, with 
most respondents rating it easy to read (1421 [95·8%] of 
1484), easy to understand (1440 [96·8%] of 1488), 
interesting (888 [61·2%] of 1452) and useful (960 [66·0%] 
of 1452). Very few respondents reported feeling angry 
(60 [4·1%]), anxious (122 [8·2%]) or depressed (67 [4·5%]). 
The taster sessions were viewed positively by the majority 
of attendees; 334 (73·9%) of 452 found the session 
interesting and 329 (72·8%) of 452 found it useful.
The mean total intervention cost was £777 (SD £2176) in 
the intervention group and £679 (£1860) in the control 
group. The intervention has a 20–27% probability of 
being deemed more cost eff
 ective at 6 months than the 
control strategy on the basis of NICE decision-making 
thresholds. However, the probability that the intervention 
is the most cost-eff
 ective option was 83% when a lifetime 
horizon was adopted, which suggests that the intervention 
represents a cost-eff
 ective use of NHS resources.
Discussion
Our fi
 ndings show that an intensive intervention 
delivering personalised risk information together with an 
invitation to attend a no-commitment taster session 
designed to inform smokers about the service and what it 
off
 ers more than doubled the odds of attending the SSS 
compared with a standard generic invitation to contact 
the service. Additionally, participants in the intervention 
group were more than twice as likely to complete the 
6 week SSS course. These results support and extend 
previous evidence that a more proactive approach, 
combined with an opportunity to experience local 
services, can reduce patient barriers to receiving 
treatment and has high potential to increase uptake.15,16,35 
We also found a signifi
 cantly higher rate of validated 7 day 
point-prevalent abstinence at 6 months in participants in 
the intervention group than in those in the control group. 
The rate of abstinence was also higher for all other 
periods of abstinence at the 6 month follow-up point.

The intervention was particularly eff
 ective among men. 
Typically, more women than men attend and set a quit 
date with the services.2 This intervention encouraged 
more men than women to attend. If, by use of recruitment 
methods such as this, more men can be persuaded to use 
the support, the number of unaided and unsuccessful 
attempts made by men to quit smoking could be reduced.
Traditionally, SSSs target smokers with an intention to 
quit in the next 2 weeks, and concern has been expressed 
that smokers recruited proactively might be less likely to 
quit than would those who self-referred.36 Despite 
recruitment of a high proportion (42·5%) of participants 
with no immediate plans to quit, and 12·6% with no 
plans to quit, the overall abstinence rate in those 
attending the SSS was similar to estimates of longer-
term abstinence in smokers setting a quit date with the 
SSS.6 Treatments do not only help during a quit attempt 
and help to prevent relapse, but can also increase 
motivation to quit.37 Tzelepis and colleagues38 also pointed 
out that if counselling were off
 ered only to smokers ready 
to quit, a large proportion of proactively recruited 
smokers would miss out on getting eff
 ective support.
Thus, recruitment of smokers with more distant plans to 
quit might result in more successful attempts and 
long-term abstinence than if these smokers were left to 
make unplanned attempts on their own.
We recorded some variation in both attendance and 
7 day validated abstinence between SSSs. There is known 
to be wide variation in outcomes between SSSs.39,40 
Furthermore, SSSs were going through a substantial 
change in commissioning during the recruitment period 
for this study, and we do not know how this might have 
aff
 ected our fi
 ndings. Organisational and service 
diff
 erences could also have a key infl
 uence on attendance 
following the taster session.
Both parts of the intervention had demonstrated 
acceptability. The taster sessions were regarded as helpful 
and reassuring, and built the intended awareness and 
comfort with the services. Very few respondents reported 
perceiving the letter as antagonistic or depressing, or 
reported feeling anxious because of the letter, suggesting 
that the balance of risk information with awareness of 
the availability of support was appropriate.41
This is the fi
 rst study to examine the eff
 ect of use of 
introductory taster sessions to encourage people to attend 
a smoking cessation service. The strategy of proactive 
recruitment approach via mass mailing was a strength of 
the study, and enabled recruitment of a more representative 
sample of smokers than if more traditional reactive 
recruitment methods were used. The strategy also allowed 
us to target at-risk groups and disadvantaged people, and 
to deliver cessation services to poorer communities14—a 
priority of the SSS—with the result that more than half of 
practices were located in areas of high deprivation. 
A further strength was the collection of anonymised data 
for individuals who were invited but did not agree to take 
part, allowing us to assess external validity. Another 
strength was that the primary outcome was an objective 
measure of attendance, obtained for all participants.
Our study has some limitations. Although we achieved 
a good geographical spread, we included only 18 of the 
151 SSSs in England, and these participating SSSs might 
not necessarily be representative of all SSSs in England. 
A further limitation is that, despite our proactive 
recruitment strategy, the recruitment rate of 4·1% of 
potentially eligible smokers who were sent an invitation 
was low and, as a result, we recruited only a small 
proportion of smokers in each area. However, the sample 
was representative of smokers in terms of sex and 
deprivation, but we did not manage to recruit a suffi
  cient 
number of younger smokers. Attendance at the SSS 
tends to be concentrated in older age groups, and it is 
important to attract younger smokers.

all members of the research team, in particular Leanne Gardner, 
Dimitra Kale, and Molly Sweeney Magee, who managed the recruitment 
of participants and data collection, and provided administrative support 
to the trial. The successful completion of the study would not have been 
possible without the support and input from the local UK Primary Care 
Research Networks and Comprehensive Local Research Networks, the 
local collaborators and service managers of the participating Stop 
Smoking Services, and practice managers and administrative staff
  at all 
of the participating general practices. We also acknowledge the support of 
the trial steering committee and of user representative Sue Dowd, who 
sat on both the trial management group and the trial steering committee.

In view of the research design we used for this study, 
we could not estimate the relative contribution of the 
two intervention components on attendance and 
abstinence. Further research in the form of a factorial 
study (whereby participants are randomised to receive a 
personalised invitation to a local SSS, or an invitation to 
a taster session, or both, or neither) is necessary to 
estimate the separate eff
 ects of the two components. 
Implementation studies are also needed to confi
 rm the 
fi
 ndings of this study and establish a real-world eff
 ect 
size. In implementation of this intervention to all 
smokers in the practice, information available in 
medical records could be used to generate a personal 
invitation to a taster session. This approach would 
eliminate the need for return of an assessment 
questionnaire and obtaining of consent, and could 
result in increased attendance.
Compared with the generic letter, the tailored letter 
plus the taster session is likely to be more eff
 ective, but 
also more costly. In the short term (6 months), the 
intervention is less likely to be cost eff
 ective compared 
with the control. However, smoking cessation yields 
long-term health-care cost savings and health benefi
 ts 
attributable to the reduced risk of smoking-related 
diseases. The long-term economic model indicates that 
the intervention has a great probability of being more 
cost eff
 ective than the control strategy over a lifetime 
horizon. A full cost-eff
 ectiveness analysis has been done 
and will be published elsewhere.
The number of smokers accessing the SSS has 
decreased signifi
 cantly in the past few years.10 Eff
 orts to 
reverse this trend should be a priority, because services 
off
 er smokers a substantially higher chance of stopping 
smoking than does attempting to quit without support. 
Our fi
 ndings suggest that a programme in general 
practice of proactive recruitment using personal 
tailored letters and introductory sessions can more 
than double the odds of attending the SSS, and lead to 
increased quit rates.
