ABSTRACT
Attempts to alter intestinal dysbiosis via administration of probiotics
have consistently shown that colonization with the administered microbes is tran-
sient. This study sought to determine whether provision of an initial course of Bifido-
bacterium longum subsp. infantis (B. infantis) would lead to persistent colonization of
the probiotic organism in breastfed infants. Mothers intending to breastfeed were
recruited and provided with lactation support. One group of mothers fed B. infantis
EVC001 to their infants from day 7 to day 28 of life (n � 34), and the second group
did not administer any probiotic (n � 32). Fecal samples were collected during the
first 60 postnatal days in both groups. Fecal samples were assessed by 16S rRNA
gene sequencing, quantitative PCR, mass spectrometry, and endotoxin measure-
ment. B. infantis-fed infants had significantly higher populations of fecal Bifidobacte-
riaceae, in particular B. infantis, while EVC001 was fed, and this difference persisted
more than 30 days after EVC001 supplementation ceased. Fecal milk oligosaccha-
rides were significantly lower in B. infantis EVC001-fed infants, demonstrating higher
consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by B. infantis EVC001. Concentrations
of acetate and lactate were significantly higher and fecal pH was significantly lower
in infants fed EVC001, demonstrating alterations in intestinal fermentation. Infants
colonized by Bifidobacteriaceae at high levels had 4-fold-lower fecal endotoxin levels,
consistent with observed lower levels of Gram-negative Proteobacteria and Bacte-
roidetes.
IMPORTANCE The gut microbiome in early life plays an important role for long-
term health and is shaped in large part by diet. Probiotics may contribute to im-
provements in health, but they have not been shown to alter the community com-
position of the gut microbiome. Here, we found that breastfed infants could be
stably colonized at high levels by provision of B. infantis EVC001, with significant
changes to the overall microbiome composition persisting more than a month later,
whether the infants were born vaginally or by caesarean section. This observation is
consistent with previous studies demonstrating the capacity of this subspecies to
utilize human milk glycans as a nutrient and underscores the importance of pairing
a probiotic organism with a specific substrate. Colonization by B. infantis EVC001 re-
sulted in significant changes to fecal microbiome composition and was associated
with improvements in fecal biochemistry. The combination of human milk and an
infant-associated Bifidobacterium sp. shows, for the first time, that durable changes

I
n many resource-poor countries, bifidobacteria are the dominant fecal microbes in
breastfed infants (1–3), whereas in resource-rich countries there is marked variability,
with some studies showing low numbers of fecal bifidobacteria among breastfed
infants (4–6). Infant delivery mode, diet, and maternal fecal bifidobacteria influence
infant colonization with bifidobacteria. Decreased numbers of intestinal bifidobacteria
have clinical relevance, based on a large body of evidence that intestinal dysbiosis early
in life predisposes to inflammation, and increases risks for obesity, atopic and allergic
diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (7–9), and diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2) (6,
10). It is not likely coincidental that dysbiosis-associated diseases are markedly less
common in resource-poor countries.
Bifidobacteria appear to be particularly important, given the evidence for reversal of
stress-induced inflammation and intestinal hyperpermeability both in vitro and in
animal models (11–13). Probiotics hold promise as a potential modality to correct
dysbiosis in early life and prevent gut microbiota-associated diseases; however, many
commercially available probiotic products have shown only limited benefits to date.
This may be due in part to the high degree of variability in purity and viability of current
probiotic products (14). In addition, probiotic trials to date have demonstrated only
transient colonization with the administered strain (15–17). This is likely a consequence
of the ecological and evolutionary adaptations of the probiotic strains used, as stable
persistence of an exogenous strain is possible (18).
Human milk contains prebiotic oligosaccharides that are not digestible by the host
infant but are rapidly consumed by a limited number of species of Bifidobacterium and
Bacteroides (19). Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (B. infantis) is unique among gut
microbes in its capacity to transport into its cytoplasm and consume the full range of
human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) (20). We previously reported a clinical trial of
B. infantis EVC001 in breastfed term infants, in which mother-infant dyads received
either lactation support or lactation support plus the probiotic for 21 days (21). We now
present a secondary analysis of fecal samples collected from these infants. We hypoth-
esized that given the capacity of B. infantis to outcompete other gut bacteria for HMOs,
infants colonized with this strain in the first weeks of life would be stably colonized as
long as human milk was provided. We also hypothesized that providing this strain
would increase fecal short-chain fatty acids and decrease fecal pH, fecal HMO content,
and fecal endotoxin concentrations.
RESULTS
Changes in the fecal microbiome. Among the infants whose mothers received
lactation support alone (no probiotic for the infant [CON]), 22 out of 32 achieved
measurable levels of Bifidobacterium colonization (�1% Bifidobacterium) in the first
60 days of life; however, only 10 infants maintained populations of Bifidobacterium
greater than 50% of the total community, despite exclusive breastfeeding during this
time period. Representative Bifidobacterium isolates from infants were predominantly
B. longum subsp. longum and B. breve (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).
When multiple confounding factors (subject, sampling day, mode of delivery) were
corrected by multivariate linear modeling using MaAsLin, caesarean section (CS) deliv-
ery significantly altered the composition of the breastfed infant fecal microbiome over
the first 60 days of life (Fig. 1A). Infants delivered vaginally (DV) had a higher abundance
of Bacteroidaceae and lower abundances of Enterococcaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Carno-
bacteriaceae, and Gemellaceae compared to CS infants (Fig. 1B and C; Table 1).
Among the infants fed B. infantis EVC001, fecal Bifidobacteriaceae were significantly
higher in these infants than in the CON infants (Fig. 2A and B; Table 1). In addition, a

 species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) measurement showed significantly higher
mean levels of B. infantis in supplemented infants (10.81 log10 cells per g of feces
[standard deviation, or SD, 11.13]). The number of cells (reported as the log number of
cells per gram of feces) at day 10 postnatal in the EVC001 treatment group (Fig. 2C) was
higher than in CON infants, whose mean levels of B. infantis fell below the limit of
detection throughout the 21-day feeding period (days 7 to 28 postnatal) and through
60 days postnatal (Fig. 2C). After the baseline sample (P � 0.431, Holm-Sidak adjusted),
the difference was significant between the two groups from day 10 through day 60
(P � 0.0001, Holm-Sidak adjusted). The relative abundances of Enterobacteriaceae,
Clostridiaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Micrococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae
were markedly diminished in supplemented infants compared with CON infants based
on a comparison using MaAsLin to account for subject, sampling day, and delivery
mode as confounding variables (Fig. 2D). Mean relative abundances of the dominant
taxonomic families (� SD) are shown in Table 1 for each day, each delivery mode, and
each treatment group.
To examine the effect of feeding B. infantis EVC001 on the fecal microbiome of
CS infants and whether any changes resolved the effect of CS on the infant fecal
microbiome, the weighted UniFrac distances were compared between delivery
modes (CS versus DV) in probiotic-supplemented infants. After supplementation,
the mean weighted UniFrac distance among samples within delivery groups de-
creased significantly from that of baseline samples (P � 0.001, Holm-Sidak-
corrected multiple-comparisons test) (Fig. 3A). Despite these compositional
changes in the overall microbial community, the Shannon diversity index was not
significantly different between EVC001-fed and CON infants (P � 0.05, Holm-Sidak-
corrected multiple-comparisons test) (Fig. 3B). Community stability was compared
over this time period using an abundance-weighted Jaccard index. The fecal
microbiome of infants fed with B. infantis EVC001 was more stable over time than
that of CON infants, and this higher stability persisted through postnatal day 60

HMOs by the probiotic B. infantis EVC001. Nearly all HMOs in the stools decreased after
colonization with B. infantis EVC001 (Table 3).
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was also used to measure lactate and
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces, as these are the primary metabolic end products
of Bifidobacterium HMO fermentation. Infants fed B. infantis EVC001 had significantly
increased fecal lactate and acetate (Fig. 5C; Table 4). Infants fed B. infantis EVC001 had
significantly greater total fecal organic acids than CON infants at day 29 (71.41 �
20.75 �mol/g versus 45.00 � 14.73 �mol/g; adjusted P � 0.001, multiple t test with
Holm-Sidak correction).
To test whether fecal pH changed in tandem with increased lactate and acetate
concentrations, the pH of the fecal samples at postnatal day 21 from 18 randomly
chosen CON infants was measured. The mean fecal pH of these samples was 5.97 �
0.57. In contrast, feces from 18 randomly sampled B. infantis EVC001-fed infants at day

from CON infants (P � 0.01, Mann-Whitney test) (Fig. 6A). Comparison between infant
groups showed absolute Bifidobacterium populations in infant stools were negatively
correlated with fecal pH (Spearman’
s � � �0.62, P � 0.01) (Fig. 6B). Comparing
weighted UniFrac distance matrices, the pH was also found to be a significant discrim-
inator of community composition (Mantel test, R � 0.32, P � 0.002). Actinobacteria (the
phylum containing bifidobacteria) were significantly and negatively correlated with pH
(Spearman’
s � � �0.54, P � 0.018, Bonferroni corrected), while Proteobacteria were
significantly and positively correlated with pH (Spearman’
s � � 0.65, P � 0.001,
Bonferroni corrected).
Endotoxin, an important outer membrane component of Gram-negative organisms
(e.g., Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes), was significantly and positively correlated with
the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (Spearman’
s � � 0.51, P � 0.001) and was
negatively correlated with Bifidobacteriaceae abundance (Spearman’
s � � �0.42, P �

EU/ml in B. infantis EVC001-fed infants and 4.58 � 0.75 log10 EU/ml in CON infants; P �
0.04). A stronger effect was found when Bifidobacteriaceae relative abundance was
taken into account in all infants tested. Infants with high populations of Bifidobacteri-
aceae (�50%; n � 46) had significantly lower endotoxin concentrations than infants
with low Bifidobacteriaceae abundance levels (�50%; n � 13), with 4.68 log10 EU/ml

DISCUSSION
Neonates are rapidly colonized by the organisms they encounter at parturition,
through exposure to vaginal and fecal microbes during vaginal delivery or by exposure
to skin and hospital-associated surfaces during caesarean section delivery (24, 25).
Despite exclusive breastfeeding, in this study many CON infants remained uncolo-
nized by Bifidobacterium throughout the initial 60-day study period, and those that
were colonized by this genus harbored species that were distinct from B. infantis,
the predominant species found in many breastfed infants in resource-poor coun-
tries (15, 26).
The most striking finding of this study was the stable colonization of B. infantis well

 beyond the supplementation period. Even though B. infantis EVC001 was not provided
after day 28, fecal bifidobacteria, which we confirmed as B. infantis EVC001 based on
quantitative PCR, remained the dominant organism in these infants at day 60 (Fig. 2).
We postulate that this prolonged colonization, which has been rarely observed in
probiotic studies (18), is a function of the ancient adaptations of B. longum subsp.
infantis to HMOs (27), and some of these adaptations provide a specific ecological
advantage over those of other gut microbes (e.g., Bacteroides) (28). Thus, both probiotic
inoculation and continued provision of a selective nutrient (HMOs) for the probiotic
strain are likely to be essential to long-term colonization; these findings are analogous
to recent findings for B. longum subsp. longum in adults (18).
In the distal gut, carbohydrates play a major role in shaping the microbial commu-
nity structure. HMOs are energetically expensive for the mother to produce and
compose the third largest fraction of solids in human milk (19). Given that HMOs are not
digested by the infant, they are abundant in the stool in the absence of B. infantis or
other HMO-consuming microbes. This could represent a potential marker of intestinal
dysbiosis (i.e., when the intestinal microbiome is dominated by non-HMO-consuming
microbes, such as Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, the fecal HMO content is high) (22, 29,
30). A number of functions of HMOs have been proposed, from immune signaling to
serving as prebiotics (31), and changes in the concentrations of HMOs in milk and
microbiome compositions are associated with differential impacts on health outcomes
(3). Here, the provision of B. infantis EVC001 markedly decreased fecal HMOs, consistent

 with high levels of consumption by B. infantis EVC001. The associated increases in
lactate and acetate and decline in fecal pH were not surprising, given that the central
metabolic pathway for Bifidobacterium yields lactate and acetate as primary products of
fermentation (32).
In the absence of Bifidobacterium, the community that dominates the gut micro-
biome of infants in resource-rich countries is typically characterized as having low
community stability and diminished colonization resistance, which are among the key
ecosystem functions for the gut microbiome (33). In infants colonized by B. infantis
EVC001, community stability is high and saturated, even at a low level of community
diversity, compared with the adult gut ecosystem. Thus, we hypothesize that the
evolutionary and ecological adaptations that have shaped the mother-infant-B. infantis
relationship have converged on an optimum that maximizes community stability and
the fermentative output of organic acids for the benefit of the host. Here, we found that
a low fecal pH was negatively associated with Proteobacteria, whose presence in a gut
community is considered a signature of dysbiosis (34). By producing lactate and
acetate, B. infantis EVC001 is also able to convert indigestible carbohydrates—other-
wise lost in the stool—into substrates that are actively transported by the host and play
central roles in host overall energy balance, immune development, and support of
colonic epithelial cell growth during a critical window of infant development (35, 36).
Indeed, recent studies have shown that infants colonized with B. infantis at levels
comparable to those of the infants supplemented with B. infantis EVC001 have im-
proved health outcomes compared to infants with dysbiotic gut microbiomes (1) and
that high levels of B. infantis are typical for healthy infants (37). Future studies will be
necessary to elucidate the durability of this effect through later childhood and whether
these effects have an impact on overall health later in life.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study subjects and design. The details of the clinical trial design were reported previously (21).
Briefly, mother-infant dyads were recruited in the Davis and Sacramento metropolitan region of Northern
California (USA) (Table S2). Mothers received either lactation support or lactation support and 1.8 �
1010 CFU of activated B. infantis EVC001 (ATCC SD-7035; manufactured by Evolve Biosystems, Inc.) to feed
their infants daily from postnatal day 7 to day 28. This strain of B. infantis was selected for its capacity
to digest the full breadth of HMOs (38–40). B. infantis EVC001 was delivered as 156 mg of live bacteria
(�1.8 � 1010 CFU) diluted in 469 mg of lactose as an excipient, and it was packaged in single-use sachets.
Mothers were trained by lactation consultants to mix the contents of the sachet in 5 ml of expressed
breast milk and feed this to the infant. The probiotic was stored at �20°
C by the mothers during the
study, and stability at �20°
C was confirmed by plate counts. Subject sampling is illustrated in Fig. S1. The
study and methods were approved by the UC Davis Institutional Review Board, and the study was
registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02457338).
Sample collection. Fecal samples were collected at home on postnatal days 6 (baseline), 10, 14,
21, 25, 29, 32, 40, 50, and 60 as previously described (21). Infants from the EVC001-fed group (n �
34) and the control group (n � 32, CON) who maintained exclusive breastfeeding or abstained from
routine use of nonstudy probiotics were included in this secondary analysis. Adequate sample
volumes for the analysis were available for 66 infants (Fig. S1) who met these final study criteria.
Stool samples were stored at �20°
C in a home freezer and transferred on dry ice to a �80°
C freezer
for storage prior to DNA extraction. All individuals processing and analyzing samples were blinded
to study group assignments.
Molecular methods and analyses. Total DNA was extracted from approximately 100 mg of feces by
using the Zymo fecal DNA miniprep kit according to the manufacturer’
s instructions (Zymo Research).
Negative controls for detection of kit contamination were included and failed to produce visible PCR
bands in an agarose gel but were analyzed as quality controls. Quantitative PCR was carried out using
standard curves of known cultures prepared by serial dilution and extracted in the same manner as the
fecal samples. Individual samples were analyzed in duplicate under the conditions listed in Table 5.
Reactions were carried out in 20-�l volumes with PerfeCTa SYBR green FastMix ROX (QuantaBio; Beverly,
MA USA) or TaqMan universal master mix II, with uracil-N-glycosylase (Thermo Fisher Scientific;
Waltham, MA, USA), in 5 �l of extracted DNA in a QuantStudio 3 qPCR machine (Thermo Fisher Scientific;
Waltham, MA, USA).
Development of Blon_0915 primers. A bidirectional BLAST search was used to compare type
strains of B. infantis and B. longum to identify subspecies-specific genes. Candidate genes were screened
against B. infantis EVC001 ATCC SD7035, and Blon_0915 was found to be present in both the type strain
of B. infantis and EVC001 ATCC SD7035 and other closely related strains of B. infantis but not among other
Bifidobacterium species. BLASTN searches confirmed these findings, indicating that Blon_0915 had little
sequence homology among other Bifidobacterium sequences in the NCBI database. Primer3 (41, 42) was
used to identify primer pairs with high efficiency and specificity for B. infantis. In comparison to the

 B. longum group primers used here (Table 5), primers Blon_0915F and Blon_0915R, when coupled with
Blon_0915P, did not produce false amplification from infants who were not previously fed B. infantis. This
was true even when tested in fecal samples from infants natively colonized by B. longum, which was
independently verified by using genus-specific Bifidobacterium and B. longum group-specific qPCR primer
sets (Fig. S2). The TaqMan reaction was carried out using the manufacturer’
s instructions (Thermo, Fisher
Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA), which included a preincubation step for 2 min at 50°
C and then 10 min
at 95°
C, followed by 40 cycles of a two-step PCR for 15 s at 95°
C and 60 s at 60°
C for Blon_0915 primers;
other primer/probe chemistries are outlined in Table 5.
Culture and identification of Bifidobacterium isolates. Fecal Bifidobacterium isolates were ob-
tained by serial dilution of feces in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) and spread by plating on
Bifidobacterium selective isolation medium (4). Plates were incubated anoxically at 37°
C for 48 h, and 10
colonies were randomly selected and isolated per sample. The resulting strains were identified by PCR
amplification, and the internal transcribed spacer amplicons were identified using primers and reaction
conditions (Table 5) and then purified for Sanger sequencing at the UC Davis DNA Sequencing Core
Facility.
16S rRNA sequencing and analysis. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and
sequenced using primers 515f and 806r as previously described with recent modifications (43, 44) and
as listed in Table 5, in a HEPA-filtered laminar flow cabinet dedicated to PCR preparation. Paired-end DNA
(300 bp) sequencing was performed at the UC Davis Genome Center on an Illumina MiSeq system.
Sequences were analyzed using QIIME 1.9.1 (45). Open-reference operational taxonomical unit (OTU)
picking was performed using UCLUST at 97% identity (46). OTUs with a relative abundance of less than
0.005% were removed (47). Samples with fewer than 2,779 reads were omitted from analysis, which
removed 10 samples and the negative-control samples (PCR and extraction control samples). After
quality filtering, a mean of 9,216 (�4,505 [SD]) and a median of 7,749 reads were obtained per sample.
The observed species index, Faith’
s phylogenetic diversity index (48), and Shannon diversity index were
used as metrics to compute alpha diversity. Weighted UniFrac distances were used as a beta diversity
metric, in addition to the abundance-weighted Jaccard index, to calculate community compositional
stability, congruent with previously described metrics of community stability (26, 49). Multivariate linear
modeling (MaAsLin) was used to compare groups of samples at the family and genus level, correcting
for subject, sampling day, treatment group, and delivery mode (50). In particular, taxonomic profiles at
the family level of samples from day 10 to day 60 were imputed in MaAsLin, and the test was run to
correct for subject, collection day, delivery mode (DV or CS), and treatment (EVC001-fed or CON).
MaAsLin was run with a false-discovery rate of 0.05, a minimum of 0.0001 for feature relative abundance
filtering, and a minimum of 0.01 for feature prevalence filtering.
Biochemical measurements. Breast milk collected on postnatal day 21 and fecal samples collected
from baseline (day 6) to the end of EVC001 feeding (day 29) were analyzed for HMO composition as
previously described (22) and also analyzed for fecal lactate and SCFA as previously described (51). To
measure fecal pH, feces were diluted 1:10 in sterile water, mixed with a vortex mixer for 4 min, and
centrifuged to precipitate solids (2 min, 12,000 relative centrifugal force). The supernatant was collected
and its pH was measured (Oakton pH 700). Fecal endotoxin concentrations were measured by serial
dilution in sterile, endotoxin-free water to within the reference range by using a Pierce LAL chromogenic
