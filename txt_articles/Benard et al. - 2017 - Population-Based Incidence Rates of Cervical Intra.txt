Abstract
IMPORTANCE—A substantial effect of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines on reducing 
HPV-related cervical disease is essential before modifying clinical practice guidelines in partially 
vaccinated populations.
OBJECTIVE—To determine the population-based cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) trends 
when adjusting for changes in cervical screening practices that overlapped with HPV vaccination 
implementation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—The New Mexico HPV Pap Registry, which 
captures population-based estimates of both cervical screening prevalence and CIN, was used to 
compute CIN trends from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2014. Under New Mexico 
Administrative Code, the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry, a statewide public health surveillance 
program, receives mandatory reporting of all cervical screening (cytologic and HPV testing) and 
any cervical, vulvar, and vaginal histopathological findings for all women residing in New Mexico 
irrespective of outcome.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Prespecified outcome measures included low-grade CIN 
(grade 1 [CIN1]) and high-grade CIN (grade 2 [CIN2] and grade 3 [CIN3]).
RESULTS—From 2007 to 2014, a total of 13 520 CIN1, 4296 CIN2, and 2823 CIN3 lesions 
were diagnosed among female individuals 15 to 29 years old. After adjustment for changes in 
cervical screening across the period, reductions in the CIN incidence per 100 000 women screened 
were significant for all grades of CIN among female individuals 15 to 19 years old, dropping from 
3468.3 to 1590.6 for CIN1 (annual percentage change [APC], −9.0; 95% CI, −12.0 to −5.8; P < .
001), from 896.4 to 414.9 for CIN2 (APC, −10.5; 95% CI, −18.8 to −1.2; P = .03), and from 240.2 
to 0 for CIN3 (APC, −41.3; 95% CI, −65.7 to 0.3; P = .05). Reductions in the CIN2 incidence 
were also significant for women 20 to 24 years old, dropping from 1027.7 to 627.1 (APC, −6.3; 
95% CI, −10.9 to −1.4; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Population-level decreases in CIN among cohorts 
partially vaccinated for HPV may be considered when clinical practice guidelines for cervical 
cancer screening are reassessed. Evidence is rapidly growing to suggest that further increases in 
raising the age to start screening are imminent, one step toward integrating screening and 
vaccination.
Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause high-grade cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which can progress to invasive cervical cancer if left 
untreated. Randomized trials have shown that HPV vaccines are efficacious in preventing 
HPV infection and low-grade and high-grade CIN,1 and cervical cancer reductions of 70%

 to 90% are envisioned to be possible through population vaccination during the next 25 
years.2 Reductions in cervical cancer precursors will be observed much earlier as successive 
cohorts of women with greater vaccination coverage move into cervical screening. However, 
a coincident decreasing predictive value of current clinical approaches to cervical cancer 
screening is expected as a consequence of the absence of HPV,3 and as CIN prevalence 
decreases, the residual cases identified by screening could result in unnecessary clinical 
management and follow-up.4
The New Mexico HPV Pap Registry (NMHPVPR)5 is the only surveillance system in the 
United States that has captured population-based estimates of both screening prevalence and 
CIN since the beginning of the vaccine introduction (in 2007) to 2014. All data were 
reported to the NMHPVPR under New Mexico Administrative Code regulation (NMAC 
7.4.3.). The NMHPVPR data were examined to estimate the HPV vaccine effect on CIN 
rates when adjusting for cervical cancer screening.
Methods
Under state regulations, all cytologic and HPV testing and histopathologic findings 
ascertained as part of clinical cervical screening are reported to the NMHPVPR. Ongoing 
evaluations of cervical screening, diagnosis, and treatment by the NMHPVPR have been 
reviewed and approved under exempt status by the University of New Mexico Human 
Research Review Committee. There were 658 093 women residing in New Mexico with 
cervical cytologic testing from 2007 to 2014, and 219 797 women (33.4%) were younger 
than 30 years at the time of screening. Cervical biopsy results were classified as CIN grade 1 
(CIN1), CIN grade 2 (CIN2), CIN grade 3 (CIN3), carcinoma in situ, and adenocarcinoma 
in situ. Invasive cervical cancers were not included in the analyses.
The CIN incidence rates are presented per women with a cervical cytologic test in a given 
year to adjust the rates for changes in cervical cancer screening.6 The number of women 
tested per year is used as the denominator because CIN can only be detected in women who 
are screened. For the annual CIN incidence for a given age group, the numerator is the 
number of women diagnosed a shaving CIN1, CIN2, or CIN3, and the denominator is the 
total number of women with cervical cytologic testing. For the annual cervical cytologic 
testing rates for a given age group, the numerator is the number of women with cervical 
cytologic screening tests, and the denominator is the total number of women in the state’s 
population estimated from the US Census. For women with more than 1 biopsy per year, the 
first instance of the worst diagnosis was selected for that year. A woman can contribute to 
only one endpoint (CIN1, CIN2, or CIN3) in any given year within a given age category.
Trends in CIN were characterized by the annual percentage change (APC) with 95% CIs.7 
The APC was estimated by fitting a least squares regression line to the natural logarithm of 
the incidence using the calendar year as a regressor variable. P values tested if the slope of 
the fitted linear line is zero under the assumption that the estimate of the slope follows a t 
distribution, which in turn tests whether the APC is significant. In the Figure, the incidences 
over calendar years were fitted using a smoothing function with a local polynomial

 regression approach.8 Software programs (SAS, version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc and R, 
version 3.2.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing) were used for the analyses.
Results
Among female individuals 15 to 29 years old, there were 13 520 CIN1, 4296 CIN2, and 
2823 CIN3 lesions diagnosed from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2014. After adjusting 
for changes in cervical screening across the period, the CIN incidence showed significant 
reductions for all grades of CIN in female individuals 15 to 19 years old, dropping from 
3468.3 to 1590.6 for CIN1 (APC, −9.0; 95% CI, −12.0 to −5.8; P < .001) (Figure, A), from 
896.4 to 414.9 for CIN2 (APC, −10.5; 95% CI, −18.8 to −1.2; P = .03) (Figure, B), and from 
240.2 to 0 for CIN3 (APC, −41.3; 95% CI, −65.7 to 0.3; P = .05) (Figure, C). Reductions in 
the CIN2 incidence were also significant for women 20 to 24 years old, dropping from 
1027.7 to 627.1 (APC, −6.3; 95% CI, −10.9 to −1.4; P = .02) (Figure, B). For women 25 to 
29 years old, the CIN incidence increased, and this increase was significant for CIN1 and 
CIN3 (Figure, A and C). A decrease in cervical screening rates among the state population 
for all age groups was observed from 2007 to 2014 (Figure, D). eTable 1 in the Supplement 
lists other results.
Finer age stratifications (2.5 years) provide additional perspective on time-dependent 
changes in CIN rates as the proportion of vaccinated women increased within the cohorts. 
These data are summarized in eTable 2 and the eFigure in the Supplement.
Discussion
In New Mexico, the mean uptake of all 3 doses of HPV vaccine among female individuals 
(age range, 13–17 years) in 2014 was 40%.9 In earlier years, the uptake ranged from 17% (in 
2008) to 38% (in 2013).10 We observed a significant population-level decrease in the 
incidence rate of all grades of CIN for female individuals 15 to 19 years old and in the 
incidence of CIN2 for women 20 to 24 years old. Reductions in the incidence were greater 
than anticipated based on HPV vaccination coverage in the population and the proportions of 
CIN attributable to HPV types directly targeted by the vaccine (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, 
and HPV-18). Cross-protection against non vaccine HPV types, efficacy of less than 3 
vaccine doses, and herd immunity may likely be contributing to these observations.
The primary goal of HPV vaccines is to prevent cervical cancer. Reductions in CIN2 and 
CIN3 precancers are early benchmarks for achieving this aim, but reductions in CIN1 are a 
direct measure of reductions in HPV infections requisite to the development of almost all 
invasive cervical cancer. Because CIN1 is the most common cervical neoplastic diagnosis 
that can lead to additional clinical follow-up, increased health care costs, and patient 
morbidities, reductions in CIN1 are an added benefit of HPV vaccination.
In the oldest age group (25–29 years), there were higher rates of all grades of CIN, with a 
pronounced increase observed in later years. This finding has been seen in other 
investigations11 and is believed to reflect longer intervals between screens and more HPV 
testing associated with increases in colposcopy referral and CIN detection within this age 
group.

 Adjusting the incidence rates for screening takes into account changes in guideline 
recommendations, including a later age to start screening and lengthened intervals between 
screening episodes, leading to overall reductions in women who were screened each year.5,6 
Using census-based denominators, we observed a significant decrease in the CIN incidence 
rates for all age groups between 15 and 29 years. When screening changes were accounted 
for, the decline was not as large and remained significant only in the younger age groups. 
These observations indicate the importance of adjusting for cancer screening when 
estimating the CIN incidence, and they highlight that CIN reductions attributed to the HPV 
vaccine effect will be overestimated when using census-based denominators.12–14
Currently, cervical cancer screening guidelines6 do not differentiate between vaccinated vs 
nonvaccinated women, yet our findings of decreasing rates of CIN at the population level 
may warrant a review of the growing body of evidence in the near future. In particular, a 
later starting age for cervical screening among partially vaccinated populations of young 
women in the United States may be prudent given the already infrequent incidence of 
invasive cervical cancer for women younger than 25 years reported before HPV vaccination 
implementation.15
Conclusions
Overall, our data demonstrate that clinical outcomes of CIN will be reduced among cohorts 
partially vaccinated for HPV, which will change clinical practice and reduce the cost-
effectiveness of current clinical care that supports cervical cancer prevention. Most 
important, screening modalities and strategies, as well as clinical management algorithms, 
will need to evolve as we work toward a rational integration of HPV vaccination and 
cervical screening.

 Key Points
Question
What is the effect of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia (CIN) rates when adjusting for cervical cancer screening?
Findings
In this population-based registry study, after adjustment for changes in screening across 
2007 to 2014, reductions in the population-based CIN incidence were significant for all 
grades (CIN 1, 2, and 3) among females 15 to 19 years old and for CIN grade 2 among 
women 20 to 24 years old. Based on vaccination coverage, reductions were greater than 
anticipated, supporting vaccine cross-protection, efficacy of less than 3 vaccine doses, 
and herd immunity contributions.
Meaning
Significant population-level decreases in CIN among cohorts partially vaccinated for 
HPV suggests a rapidly approaching need to revisit guidelines for cervical cancer 
screening in the United States, including increasing the age to begin screening.
