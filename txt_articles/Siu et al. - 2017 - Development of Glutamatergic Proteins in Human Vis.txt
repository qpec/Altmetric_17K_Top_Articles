tem tissue from human V1 (12 female, 18 male) covering a range of ages. Then we quantified a set of postsynaptic glutamatergic proteins
(PSD-95, GluA2, GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B), calculated indices for functional pairs that are developmentally regulated (GluA2:GluN1;
GluN2A:GluN2B), and determined interindividual variability. We found early loss of GluN1, prolonged development of PSD-95 and
GluA2 into late childhood, protracted development of GluN2A until �40 years, and dramatic loss of GluN2A in aging. The GluA2:GluN1
index switched at �1 year, but the GluN2A:GluN2B index continued to shift until �40 year before changing back to GluN2B in aging. We
also identified young childhood as a stage of heightened interindividual variability. The changes show that human V1 develops gradually
through a series of five orchestrated stages, making it likely that V1 participates in visual development and plasticity across the lifespan.

Introduction
Anatomical development of human visual cortex (V1) proceeds
quickly over the first few years (Huttenlocher et al., 1982; Zilles et
al., 1986; Burkhalter, 1993; Burkhalter et al., 1993), but matura-
tion of vision is slow, changing through childhood, adolescence,
adulthood, and aging (Kova
´cs et al., 1999; Lewis and Maurer,
2005; Germine et al., 2011; Owsley, 2011). The discrepancy be-
tween development of structure and function led to the idea that
prolonged maturation of vision might depend on features of V1
not captured by anatomical studies (Taylor et al., 2014). For ex-
ample, some GABAergic and myelin proteins involved with plas-
ticity continue developing into adulthood in human V1 (Pinto et
al., 2010; Siu et al., 2015). Most V1 synapses, however, are excit-
atory (Beaulieu et al., 1992) and glutamatergic receptors regulate

Significance Statement
Anatomical structure of human V1 appears to mature early, but vision changes across the lifespan. This discrepancy has fostered
two hypotheses: either other aspects of V1 continue changing, or later changes in visual perception depend on extrastriate areas.
Previously, we showed that some GABAergic synaptic proteins change across the lifespan, but most synapses in V1 are excitatory
leaving unanswered how they change. So we studied expression of glutamatergic proteins in human V1 to determine their
development. Here we report prolonged maturation of glutamatergic proteins, with five stages that map onto life-long changes in
human visual perception. Thus, the apparent discrepancy between development of structure and function may be explained by
life-long synaptic changes in human V1.

 experience-dependent plasticity (Hensch, 2004; Turrigiano and
Nelson, 2004; Cooper and Bear, 2012; Levelt and Hu
¨bener, 2012)
and receptive field properties (Ramoa et al., 2001; Rivadulla et al.,
2001; Fagiolini et al., 2004; Self et al., 2012). Currently, little is
known about expression of glutamatergic proteins in human V1
(Huntley et al., 1994; Scherzer et al., 1998) and less about how
they change across the lifespan (Pinto et al., 2015).
Animal models found that activation of glutamate receptors,
NMDA and AMPA, regulates plasticity in V1 (Kleinschmidt et
al., 1987; Daw et al., 1992; Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004; Yashiro
and Philpot, 2008; Smith et al., 2009; Cooke and Bear, 2014;
Turrigiano, 2017). The recruitment of AMPARs to silent syn-
apses starts the critical period (CP) (Rumpel et al., 1998) and an
increase in the glutamate receptor scaffolding protein, PSD-95,
consolidates synapses to end the CP (Huang et al., 2015). The
composition of AMPARs and NMDARs regulates juvenile ocular
dominance plasticity starting with weakening of deprived eye
responses by the rapid loss of GluA2 (Heynen et al., 2003; Lambo
and Turrigiano, 2013) and increase of GluN2B (Chen and Bear,
2007). Next, open eye responses are strengthened by an increase
of GluA2 (Lambo and Turrigiano, 2013) and decrease of GluN2A
(Smith et al., 2009). The developmental shift from more GluN2B
to more GluN2A (2A:2B balance) regulates metaplasticity be-
cause GluN2B allows more Ca 2� to enter the synapse and activate
LTP mechanisms (Yashiro and Philpot, 2008). The 2A:2B balance
shifts during the CP (Sheng et al., 1994) when visual experience
drives a loss of GluN2B (Philpot et al., 2001), an increase of
GluN2A (Quinlan et al., 1999a, b), and reduces ocular domi-
nance plasticity (Philpot et al., 2003, 2007).
Receptive field properties in V1 are also regulated by gluta-
mate receptors. The dense expression of glutamate receptors in
layers 2/3 and 4 (Huntley et al., 1994; Kooijmans et al., 2014)
supports AMPARs dominated feedforward and NMDARs dom-
inated feedback drive (Self et al., 2012). Furthermore, develop-
ment of orientation preference is prevented by suppressing
NMDARs (Ramoa et al., 2001) and requires the GluN2A subunit
(Fagiolini et al., 2003).
Here, we investigate development of glutamate receptors in
human V1 (PSD-95, GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluA2) from
birth to 80 years of age. We find changes that could contribute to
visual processing and plasticity throughout the lifespan.
Materials and Methods
Samples. The postmortem tissue samples from human visual cortex used
in this study were obtained from the Brain and Tissue Bank for Develop-
mental Disorders at the University of Maryland (Baltimore) and the
study was approved by the McMaster University Research Ethics Board.
Cortical samples were from individuals with no history of brain disor-
ders, and all causes of death were with minimal trauma. Samples were
collected within 23 h postmortem, sectioned coronally in 1 cm intervals,
flash frozen at the Brain and Tissue Bank, and stored at �80°C. Visual
cortex samples were taken from the posterior pole of the left hemisphere
and included both superior and inferior portions of the calcarine fissure.
A total of 30 cases were used and ranged in age from 20 d to 79 years
(Table 1).
Sample preparation. A small piece of tissue (50–100 mg) was cut from
the calcarine fissure of each frozen block of human V1, suspended in cold
homogenization buffer (1 ml buffer: 50 mg tissue, 0.5 mM DTT, 2 mM
EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mg/L leupeptin, 100 nM micro-
cystin, 0.1 mM PMSF, 50 mg/L soybean trypsin inhibitor), and homoge-
nized in a glass-glass Dounce hand homogenizer (Kontes). To enrich for
synaptic proteins, we used a synaptosome preparation. Homogenate
samples were filtered through coarse (100 �g) and fine (5 �g) pore
hydrophilic mesh filters (Millipore), and then centrifuged at 1000 � g for
10 min to obtain the synaptic fraction. The synaptosome pellet was re-
suspended in boiling 1% SDS, heated for 10 min, and stored at �80°C.
Synaptosome protein measurement and equating. Low abundance syn-
aptic proteins are enriched threefold to fivefold by the synaptosome
preparation (Murphy et al., 2014), which facilitates the reliable detection
of synaptic proteins by Western blot analysis. In contrast, housekeeping
proteins used as loading controls, such as GAPDH or �-tubulin, are
reduced approximately 10-fold in a synaptosome preparation because
the small synaptosome volume is dominated by synaptic proteins (Balsor
and K.M.M., unpublished observation). Moreover, those loading con-
trols are known to exhibit high variability (Lee et al., 2016) and change
under many conditions, including experience (Dahlhaus et al., 2011) and
development (Pinto et al., 2015). For these reasons, normalizing an en-
riched synaptosome preparation with a diminished loading control can
lead to the undesirable outcome of inflating the apparent expression of
synaptic proteins, especially early in development. It is important, how-
ever, for Western blot analyses to accurately quantify total protein and to
load equivalent amounts. To achieve these, we used a stringent 3 stage
protocol to measure and equate protein concentrations among the sam-
ples and then load equivalent volumes into each gel.
To measure and equate protein concentration for each synaptosome
sample, we used a BCA assay (Pierce, ThermoFisher Scientific) and com-
pared the samples with a set of protein standards (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0
mg/ml) (BSA protein standards, Bio-Rad Laboratories). We mixed a
small amount of each sample and standard (9 �l) with BCA assay solu-
tion (1:100), and loaded 3 aliquots (each 300 �l) into separate wells of a
96-well microplate. The plate was incubated at 45°C for 45 min to acti-
vate the reaction, then scanned in an iMark Microplate Absorbance
Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories) to quantify the colorimetric change.
Next, we plotted the absorbance values of the standards relative to their
known concentrations, and fit a linear correlation to the data. The fit for
the correlation had to be R 2 � 0.99; and if it did not reach that level, the
BCA assay was rerun. The absorbance of the human samples was mea-
sured and averaged for the 3 aliquots. This sample absorbance value and

 the linear equation fit to the standards were used to determine the
amount of Laemmli buffer (Cayman Chemical) and sample buffer
(M260 Next Gel Sample loading buffer 4�, Amresco) needed to achieve
protein concentrations of 1 �g/�l. Finally, to ensure loading of equiva-
lent volumes into each well of the gel, we used a high-quality pipette (e.g.,
Picus, Sartorius) and performed regular calibrations.
Immunoblotting. Synaptosome samples (20 �g) were separated on 4%–
20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-FL
PVDF, EMD Millipore). Each sample was run multiple times, and a control
sample,madebycombiningasmallamountofthesynaptosomepreparation
from each of the 30 cases, was run on each gel. Blots were preincubated in
blocking buffer for 1 h (Odyssey Blocking Buffer 1:1 with PBS) (Li-Cor
Biosciences), then incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4°C using
these primary antibodies: anti-NMDAR1, 1:4000 (RRID: AB_396353, BD
BiosciencesPharMingen);anti-NR2A,1:1000(RRID:AB_95169,EMDMil-
lipore); anti-NMDAR2B, 1:1000 (RRID: AB_2112925, EMD Millipore);
anti-GluA2, 1:1000 (RRID: AB_2533058, Invitrogen); and anti-PSD95,
1:16000 (RRID: AB_94278, EMD Millipore). These antibodies were selected
aftertestingthemonamultispeciesblotthatincludedsamplesfromhuman,
monkey, cat, and rat to ensure that the human samples had bands compa-
rable with the other species. The blots were washed with PBS-Tween (0.05%
PBS-T,Sigma)(3�10min)andincubatedfor1hatroomtemperaturewith
the appropriate IRDye labeled secondary antibody (anti-mouse, 1:8000,
RRID: AB_10956588; anti-rabbit, 1:10,000, RRID: AB_621843; Li-Cor Bio-
sciences), and washed again in PBS-Tween (3 � 10 min). The bands were
visualized using the Odyssey scanner (Li-Cor Biosciences), and we deter-
mined that the amount of protein loaded into each well and the antibody
concentrations were within the linear range of the Odyssey scanner. After
scanning, the blots were stripped using a Blot Restore Membrane Rejuvena-
tionKit(EMDMillipore),rescannedtoensurecompletestripping,andthen
reprobed with another antibody.
Band analysis. To analyze the bands, blots were scanned on an Odyssey
infrared scanner and quantified using densitometry (Odyssey Software
version 3.0; Li-Cor Biosciences). A density profile for each band was
calculated by performing a subtraction of the background, integrating
the pixel intensity across the area of the band, and dividing the intensity
by the width of the band to control for variations in lane width. A control
sample, made by combining a small amount from each sample, was run
on each gel, and the density of each sample was quantified relative to the
control (sample density/control density).
Band image manipulation. Bands shown on figures are representative
samples and were added to the figures in Photoshop (Adobe Systems,
RRID:SCR_014199). Horizontal and vertical transformations were ap-
plied to size and orient the bands for each figure. A linear adjustment
layer was applied uniformly to all bands for each protein, preserving the
relative intensities among bands.
Receptor subunit index. To quantify the balance between functional
pairs of proteins, we calculated a difference ratio, often called a contrast
index, that is commonly used in signal processing to determine the qual-
ity of a signal. We calculated two indices that reflect the balance between
pairs of proteins that are developmentally regulated: AMPA:NMDA in-
dex, (GluA2 � GluN1)/(GluA2 � GluN1); and NMDAR subunit 2A:2B
index, (GluN2A � GluN2B)/(GluN2B � GluN2A). These indices can
have values between �1 and 1.
Curve-fitting and statistical analyses. The results were plotted in two
ways to visualize and analyze changes in expression across the lifespan.
First, to describe the time course of changes in protein expression, scat-
terplots were made for each protein showing the expression level from
each run (gray dots) and the average of the runs (black dots). To deter-
mine the trajectory of changes across the lifespan, we used a model-fitting
approach (Christopoulos and Lew, 2000) and found the best curve-fit to
the data using MATLAB (The MathWorks, RRID: SCR_001622). A
single-exponential decay function (Y � A � exp(�(x/�)) � B) was fit to
the data for GluN1. A Gaussian function (Y � A � exp(�((log(x/�) 2)/
(2 � (� 2))) � B) was fit to the data for PSD-95, GluA2, GluN2B, and the
2A:2B index. A quadratic function was fit to the AMPA:NMDA balance
(Y � A � B � log(x) � C � log(x) 2). Finally, a weighted average was
used to describe the trajectory for GluN2A. The fits were found by least
squares, and the goodness-of-fit (R 2) and statistical significance of the fit
(p) were determined. For the decay function, we calculated the time
constants (�) and defined 3 � (when 87.5% of the change in expression
had occurred) as the age when mature expression was reached with the
95% CI around that age. For Gaussian functions, the age at the peak was
calculated and the 95% CI determined.
Second, to compare changes among different stages across the lifes-
pan, samples were binned into age groups (�0.3 years, Neonates; 0.3–1
year, Infants; 1–4 years, Young Children; 5–11 years, Older Children;
12–20 years, Teens; 21–55 years, Young Adults; �55 years, Older
Adults), and histograms were plotted showing the mean and SEM for
each group. We used bootstrapping to make statistical comparisons
among the groups because this method provides robust estimates of SE
and CI, which are especially useful for human studies constrained to
smaller sample sizes. The statistical software R (R Core Team, 2014, R: A
language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, http://www.R-project.org, RRID: SCR_001905)
was used for the bootstrapping, and we began by simulating a normally
distributed dataset (1,000,000 points) with the same mean and SD of the
group being compared. We used this normally distributed dataset to
determine whether the observed means for the other age groups were
significantly different. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to randomly
sample from the simulated dataset N times, where N was the number of
cases in the other age groups. This simulation was run 10,000 times to
generate an expected distribution for the N number of cases. CIs were
calculated for that simulated distribution (i.e., 95%, 99% CI) and com-
pared with the observed group means. The age groups were considered to
be significantly different (i.e., p � 0.05) when the observed mean was
outside the 95% CI.
Analysis of interindividual variability. Previously, we identified ages
during infancy and childhood with waves of high interindividual vari-
ability (Pinto et al., 2015; Siu et al., 2015). To analyze whether the gluta-
matergic proteins studied here have similar waves of interindividual
variabilitywecalculatedtheFanofactor(variance-to-meanratio[VMR])for
each protein and examined how it changed across the lifespan. The VMR
around each case was determined by calculating the mean and variance for
theproteinexpressionwithinamovingboxthatincludedthreeadjacentages
and then dividing the variance by the mean. Scatterplots were made to show
how the VMRs changed across the life span, and functions were fit to those
data to identify ages when there was high interindividual variability. The
VMRswerefitwiththesameGaussianfunctiondescribedabove,andawave
of higher interindividual variability was identified when 4 or more points at
the peak fell above the 95% CI for lower bound of the curve.
Results
Postmortem interval
We examined whether glutamate protein expression levels were
affected by postmortem interval (PMI). First, we verified that
immunoreactivity was present and then analyzed the correlation
between PMI and protein expression. There were no significant
correlations between PMI and expression of the five glutamater-
gic proteins (PSD-95: r � 0.05, p � 0.66; GluA2: r � 0.17, p �
0.13; GluN1: r � 0.26, p � 0.11; GluN2A: r � 0.17, p � 0.41;
GluN2B: r � 0.16, p � 0.24), so all of the data were included in the
following analyses.
Slow development of PSD-95, earlier but opposite
development of GluA2 and GluN1
We began analyzing development of glutamate proteins in hu-
man V1 by measuring expression of PSD-95, a scaffolding pro-
tein involved in anchoring AMPA and NMDA receptors (Kim
and Sheng, 2004), controlling visual developmental plasticity
(Yoshii et al., 2003), and ending the CP for ocular dominance
plasticity (Huang et al., 2015). We found a steady increase in
expression of PSD-95 in the synaptosome preparation used in
this study and analyzed the results in two ways (Fig. 1): (1) by
model fitting to all the data to determine the best curve to capture
changes across the lifespan; and (2) by binning the data into age

 groups and using bootstrapping for statistical comparisons be-
tween groups. Development of PSD-95 peaked at 9.6 years (�4.1
years; R 2 � 0.457, p � 0.0001) (Fig. 1A). This result was similar to
our previous findings using whole homogenate samples (Pinto et
al., 2015). The magnitude of the peak in the synaptosome, how-
ever, was approximately half that found using the whole homog-
enate (Pinto et al., 2015) (see Fig. 3), suggesting there could be a
large mobile pool of PSD-95 during late childhood. Comparing
the age-binned results showed a threefold increase in PSD-95
expression during development that reached a peak in older chil-
dren (5–11 years, p � 0.001) before dropping �30% into aging
(p � 0.001) (Fig. 1B). The PSD-95 peak corresponded with the
age when children are no longer susceptible to amblyopia (Lewis
and Maurer, 2005) and may signify that PSD-95 contributes to
ending the CP for ocular dominance plasticity in humans similar
to its role in rat V1 (Huang et al., 2015).

Siu, Beshara et al. • Development of Human Visual Cortex
 Next, we quantified development of GluA2 and GluN1, which
identify the two main classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors
AMPARs and NMDARs, respectively. Development of these sub-
units followed a similar pattern to that found in animal studies,
where GluA2 increased, whereas GluN1 decreased during devel-
opment (Fig. 1C–F). GluA2 expression increased �40% during
childhood and then declined a similar amount into adulthood
and aging. The GluA2 developmental trajectory peaked at 3.1
years (�1.8 years, R 2 � 0.131, p � 0.01) (Fig. 1C). Comparison
of GluA2 expression among the age groups, however, identified a
slightly later peak during late childhood (5–11 years) (Fig. 1D).
The uncertainty about the peak for GluA2 probably reflects vari-
ability in expression during childhood and the modest increase
between neonates and older children.
The trajectory of GluN1 expression started high �1 year of
age and then rapidly decreased to a relatively constant level for
the rest of the lifespan (Fig. 1E,F). The change in GluN1
expression was fit with an exponential decay function (R 2 �
0.482, p � 0.0001) that fell to mature levels (3 �) by 4.2 years
(�1.7 years) (Fig. 1E). The same pattern was found when we
compared among age groups where GluN1 levels were higher
�1 year and dropped by almost half during young childhood
(1–4 years) (p � 0.001) and remained at that level for the rest
of the lifespan (Fig. 1F).
Comparing the changes across the lifespan for PSD-95,
GluA2, and GluN1, we found different timing (GluA2 and GluN1
matured before PSD-95), different directions (PSD-95 and
GluA2 increased while GluN1 decreased), and different amounts
of protein change. Thus, even these three tightly associated pro-
teins had different developmental trajectories.
Early shift from more NMDA to more AMPA in human V1
Animal studies have shown that there is an early developmental
shift from NMDAR-dominated silent synapses to functional syn-
apses with AMPARs (Isaac et al., 1997; Rumpel et al., 1998). Here
we examined development of the AMPA:NMDA balance in hu-
man V1 as an indication of functional maturation of glutamater-
gic transmission. We calculated an AMPA:NMDA index where a
value of �1 indicated only GluN1 expression, 0 indicated equal
expression, and 1 indicated only GluA2 expression. We found an
early switch from more GluN1 �1 year of age to more GluA2
after 1 year (Fig. 2). The AMPA:NMDA balance was fit with a
quadratic function (R 2 � 0.406, p � 0.0001) that captured the
shift from GluN1 to GluA2 that peaked at 10.7 years (95% CI,
4.8–23.7 years) before slowly returning to equal expression dur-
ing aging (Fig. 2A). The age-binned results showed the same
pattern of a significant switch at 1 year, GluA2 peaking during late
childhood, and returning to balanced expression in older adults
(Fig. 2B). The changes in this AMPA:NMDA balance suggest an
early stage of human V1 development during infancy (�1 year)
that may characterize unsilencing of glutamate synapses followed
by AMPAR dominated excitatory drive during childhood and
young adults before regressing to balanced AMPAR and NMDAR
expression in aging.
GluN2A and GluN2B subunit expression in human V1
We examined developmental changes in expression of 2 NMDAR
subunits, GluN2A and GluN2B, because they affect development
of receptive field tuning and ocular dominance plasticity. In par-
ticular, the rise of GluN2A and concomitant loss of GluN2B
during the CP is one mechanism that causes reduced ocular dom-
inance plasticity in adult cortex (Philpot et al., 2007). The scat-
terplot of GluN2B expression showed a modest peak during
childhood and relatively constant expression through teens,
young adults, and older adults (Fig. 3A,B). The GluN2B trajec-
tory was fit by a Gaussian function (R 2 � 0.176, p � 0.01) that
peaked at 1.2 years (�0.7 years) (Fig. 3A). We compared GluN2B
expression among the age groups and found higher levels during
childhood (5–11 years) relative to teens, young adults, and older
adults (Fig. 3B) (p � 0.01).
The developmental trajectory for GluN2A was different from
GluN2B. Initially, GluN2A expression was low, then variable
during childhood and teenage years (8 cases with low and 3 cases
with high GluN2A expression) followed by high expression in
young adults and ending with a large (�75%) decline into aging.
The variability during childhood reduced the goodness-of-fit for
a Gaussian function, so instead we plotted a descriptive weighted
curve (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the 3 childhood cases with high
GluN2A expression also had high GluN2B expression. Binning
the results into age groups showed that young adults had more

 GluN2A expression than infants (p � 0.001), young children
(p � 0.01), teens (p � 0.01), and older adults (p � 0.001) (Fig.
3D).
NMDARs are tetrameric channels with diheteromeric nas-
cent receptors comprised of GluN1/GluN2B that shift during
development with the majority becoming triheteromers com-
prised of GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B (Sheng et al., 1994). Be-
cause GluN1 is a component of all NMDARs, we normalized
expression of GluN2A and GluN2B to the expression of GluN1
to determine whether high variability during childhood was
driven by variability in the total pool of NMDARs. Normaliz-
ing with GluN1 expression reduced the variability for both
GluN2A and GluN2B throughout childhood; it also enhanced
the GluN2B peak in late childhood (Fig. 4A,B) and the
GluN2A peak in adulthood (Fig. 4C,D). The GluN1 normal-
ization, however, did not eliminate variability of GluN2A and
GluN2B during childhood.
2A:2B balance: protracted change across the lifespan
Visual experience shifts the 2A:2B balance in favor of GluN2A
(Quinlan et al., 1999a, b) and that regulates the synaptic modifi-
cation threshold for engaging LTP versus LTD (Philpot et al.,
2007). Because the 2A:2B balance is a key mechanism regulating
visual experience-dependent metaplasticity, we analyzed it for
human V1 by calculating an index of 2A:2B expression for each
case. Here we found an orderly progression from more GluN2B
�5 years of age, to approximately balanced GluN2B and GluN2A
during the teen years, to a peak with more GluN2A during adult-
hood, followed by a shift back to more GluN2B in aging (Fig.
5A,B). These changes in the 2A:2B balance were fit by a Gaussian
function (R 2 � 0.633, p � 0.0001) that peaked at 35.9 years (�4.6
years) (Fig. 5A). The binned results illustrate the progressive shift
toward significantly more GluN2A in adulthood and then shift-
ing back to GluN2B in aging (Fig. 5B). The orderly shift in the
2A:2B balance, especially through childhood, was somewhat sur-
prising because the individual subunits showed a lot of variability
at that stage. The low variability of the 2A:2B index suggests that
the balance between this pair of subunits, rather than the absolute
amount of each, is a critical component for GluN2A and GluN2B
regulation of developmental plasticity. Importantly, compared
with animal models where the shift to GluN2A is complete by the
end of the CP (Sheng et al., 1994; Quinlan et al., 1999a; Beston et
al., 2010), the 2A:2B shift in human V1 continued for 25 years
beyond the age for susceptibility of developing amblyopia (Lewis
and Maurer, 2005).

 Waves of interindividual variability during childhood
Many studies of human brain development and function have
found large interindividual variations, including our studies of
synaptic and nonsynaptic proteins in human V1. We analyzed
interindividual variability and found waves of higher variability
in childhood (Pinto et al., 2015; Siu et al., 2015). Here we applied
the same approach and calculated the Fano factor to determine
how the VMR changed across the lifespan for the current set of
glutamatergic proteins.
We found that each glutamatergic protein had a wave of
higher interindividual variability during childhood that was well
fit by a Gaussian function (Fig. 6A–E). There was a progression in
the peak age of interindividual variability (VMRs) that began
with GluN1 and GluN2B at 1.1 years (GluN1, �0.2 years, R 2 �
0.8, p � 0.0001) (GluN2B, �0.3 years, R 2 � 0.618, p � 0.0001),
to GluN2A at 1.6 years (�0.4 years, R 2 � 0.694, p � 0.0001), to
GluA2 at 2.1 years (�0.6 years, R 2 � 0.641, p � 0.0001), to
PSD-95 at 2.5 years (�0.5 years, R 2 � 0.778, p � 0.0001) (Fig.
6A–E). We plotted the progression of peak ages for interindi-
vidual variability with their 95% CIs to show that variability oc-
curred between 1 and 3 years of age, and the peaks started with
GluN1 and GluN2B then progressed to GluN2A, GluA2, and
ended with PSD-95 (Fig. 6F).
Discussion
Our results show that development of glutamatergic synaptic
proteins in human V1 mirror changes in visual perception across
the lifespan. Human visual perception matures in stages (Ellem-
berg et al., 1999; Kova
´cs et al., 1999; Braddick et al., 2005; Owsley,
2011; Hartshorne and Germine, 2015), and the glutamate recep-
tor proteins studied here revealed five stages of development (Fig.
7). Those stages can support structural maturation of the intrin-
sic network, visually driven plasticity, closure of the CP, synaptic
stability, and degeneration in human V1. These results are similar
to the maturation of GABAergic proteins in human V1 (Pinto et
al., 2010) and suggest that synaptic changes in V1 are likely to
impact visual perception and plasticity across the lifespan.
Glutamatergic proteins regulate fundamental aspects of excit-
atory neurotransmission (Cull-Candy et al., 1998), visual plastic-
ity (Turrigiano, 2008; Yashiro and Philpot, 2008; Cooke and
Bear, 2014; Turrigiano, 2017), and receptive field properties in
V1 (Ramoa et al., 2001; Rivadulla et al., 2001; Fagiolini et al.,
2004; Self et al., 2012). Quantification of these proteins by West-
ern blotting is one of the few methods that can track the matura-
tion of human V1 to link changes in synaptic function, network
structure, and visual perception. Protein analysis, however, does
not address the cell types, layers, and circuits that are changing.
Nor does it separate presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDARs,
which play different roles in neurotransmission and experience-
dependent plasticity (Banerjee et al., 2016). The current results
may provide a blueprint to focus anatomical and other studies of
human V1 on key stages of development.
The five stages of glutamatergic protein development in hu-
man V1 are as follows:
Stage 1: the first year, structural maturation of the
intrinsic network
Initially, GluN1 expression was high and then a rapid reduction
at �1 year caused a switch in the AMPA:NMDA balance to more
GluA2. That pattern suggests initial dominance by NMDAR-
containing silent synapses that are rapidly replaced by AMPAR-
containing active synapses (Isaac et al., 1997; Rumpel et al.,
1998). The loss of GluN1 at �1 year coincides with a loss of the
endocannabinoid receptor CB1 (Pinto et al., 2010); and because
CB1 plays a central role in establishing excitatory connections
(Harkany et al., 2008), the high levels of CB1 and GluN1 may
contribute
to
the
functional
maturation
of
intracortical
(Burkhalter et al., 1993) and intercortical connections (Burkhal-
ter, 1993).

 We found that GluN2B dominated the 2A:2B balance
throughout Stages 1–3. Many animal studies have shown that the
2A:2B balance contributes to developmental plasticity in V1 and
emergence of visual function (Quinlan et al., 1999a; Erisir and
Harris, 2003; Philpot et al., 2007; Cho et al., 2009; Smith et al.,
2009; Durand et al., 2012). The dominance of GluN2B suggests
that the synaptic modification threshold favors LTP (Philpot et
al., 2007; Yashiro and Philpot, 2008), and V1 neurons are more
receptive to potentiation of an open eye’s inputs (Cho et al.,
2009). This may explain why just 1 h of visual experience in an
infant is enough to improve acuity of an eye treated for congenital
cataracts (Maurer et al., 1999). Thus, this stage reflects the estab-
lishment of nascent excitatory synapses and initiation of plastic-
ity in V1 circuits.
Stage 2: young children (1–4 years), visually driven plasticity
During the second stage of V1 development, we found progres-
sive increases in GluA2, PSD-95, and GluN2A, but the dominant
feature was the wave of interindividual variability. The variability
was similar to our previous findings for presynaptic (Synapsin,
Synaptophysin), postsynaptic (Gephyrin, PSD-95), and a non-
neuronal protein (Golli myelin basic protein, MBP) (Pinto et al.,
2015; Siu et al., 2015). Variability peaking with GluN1 and
GluN2B at �1 year, GluN2A at �1.5 years, GluA2 at �2 years,
and ending with PSD-95 at �2.5 years. Those waves may reflect
true interindividual variability in young children with cortical
development taking off at different ages. The waves may also
represent high levels of intraindividual variability driven by the
dynamics of network states where expression of each synaptic
protein could be high one day and low the next. Because the data
here are cross-sectional, we cannot differentiate between these
two ideas, but the implications for them on cortical development
are different. For example, if the waves reflect ongoing dynamics
then they could function similar to how feedback about the net-
work state shifts processing of olfactory circuits in Caenorhabditis
elegans (Gordus et al., 2015). In that model, environmental or
other factors could modulate the state of synaptic plasticity.
Rather than thinking about the waves as random or unpredict-
able, they may reveal a feature of visually driven plasticity needed
to develop adaptive circuits that support visual processing.
Stage 3: older children (5–11 years), closure of the
critical period
Expression of GluN2B, PSD-95, GluA2, and the AMPA:NMDA
balance peaked in the third stage. These changes could end the CP
for ocular dominance plasticity (Erisir and Harris, 2003; Huang
et al., 2015). For example, in mouse V1, PSD-95 peaks at the end
of the CP and consolidates AMPA-containing synapses (Huang
et al., 2015). This stage also coincides with the end of susceptibil-
ity for children developing amblyopia (Epelbaum et al., 1993;
Keech and Kutschke, 1995; Lewis and Maurer, 2005).
By the end of Stage 3, the 2A:2B balance was approximately
equal. A shift to more GluN2A in V1 is driven by visual experi-
ence (Quinlan et al., 1999b), and the findings here show that the
2A:2B shift begins in young children but is still not complete by
the end of the CP for developing amblyopia. In contrast, the
2A:2B shift in animal models is complete by the end of the CP
(Sheng et al., 1994; Quinlan et al., 1999a; Beston et al., 2010).
Perhaps the slow 2A:2B shift in combination with peak expres-
sion of GluA2 allows for strong engagement of both Hebbian and
homeostatic forms of experience-dependent plasticity (Turri-
giano, 2017).
Stage 4: teens and young adults (12–55 years),
synaptic stability
Through teens and young adults, there was continued develop-
ment as the 2A:2B balance switched to favor GluN2A and peak
expression of GluN2A did not occur until �40 years. This may
seem like surprisingly slow development for human V1, but it was
comparable with the development of some GABAergic proteins
(GAD65 and GABAA�1) (Pinto et al., 2010) as well as cortical
myelin (classic MBP) (Siu et al., 2015).
In mouse V1, the developmental shift to more GluN2A is
slower for parvalbumin-positive (PV �) inhibitory interneurons
than pyramidal neurons (Mierau et al., 2016). Perhaps the slow
2A:2B shift in human V1 reflects late maturation of PV � cells.
Fast-spiking PV � cells also have GluA2-containing AMPARs
(Kooijmans et al., 2014), so they are a site where changes in visual
experience could activate inhibitory and excitatory aspects of
short-term plasticity in human V1 (Lunghi et al., 2011, 2015a, b).
Interestingly, blocking NMDARs prevents surround-suppression
in monkey V1 (Self et al., 2012), and even a low dose of the
noncompetitive NMDAR antagonist, ketamine, impairs the per-
formance of human observers on a spatial integration task (Meu-
wese et al., 2013).
The late 2A:2B shift is likely to adjust the synaptic modifica-
tion threshold, making it more difficult for visual experience to
engage LTP (Yashiro and Philpot, 2008). More GluN2A will also
shorten the decay time of NMDARs (Stocca and Vicini, 1998;
Vicini et al., 1998), even for triheteromeric receptors (Hansen et
al., 2014). In addition, GluN2A-containing NMDARs are more
stable in the synapse (Groc et al., 2006), and their activation
promotes cell survival (Liu et al., 2007). These features of
GluN2A-containing receptors suggest that this stage reflects a
time of synaptic stability in human V1.
Stage 5: aging (>55 years), degeneration
The last stage saw a dramatic �75% loss of GluN2A expression,
bringing it back to levels found in infants (�1 year of age). In
contrast, there was no change in GluN2B expression so the 2A:2B
balance switched back to GluN2B in aging.
Age-related changes in human vision (Bennett et al., 2007;
Betts et al., 2007) and monkey receptive field properties (Lev-
enthal et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2008) have been
described as resulting from poor signal-to-noise caused by a loss
of inhibition. Our previous study of GABAergic proteins in hu-
man V1 found a modest loss of GAD65 (Pinto et al., 2010), but
that was much less than the loss of GuN2A found here. Because
GluN2A-containing NMDARs are dense on PV � inhibitory in-
terneurons in young mice (Mierau et al., 2016), the loss of
GluN2A in aging human V1 may involve PV � cells.
The age-related 2A:2B shift to more GluN2B is likely to cause
slower decay times and weaker conductances at NMDARs (Cull-
Candy et al., 1998; Vicini et al., 1998; Hansen et al., 2014). It could
also slide the synaptic modification threshold so that visual expe-
rience can more readily engage LTP. That plasticity, however,
may come at the cost of higher metabolic stress, GluN2B-
activated excitotoxicity (Liu et al., 2007) and other vulnerabilities
linked with NMDARs changes in aging (Magnusson et al., 2010).
It is clear that the aging cortex does not simply become juvenile-
like (Williams et al., 2010), and the specific loss of GluN2A found
here could be a harbinger of degeneration in human V1.
In conclusion, the current results and our other investigations
of human V1 show that synaptic and nonsynaptic proteins de-
velop through a series of orchestrated stages that extend across
the lifespan (Murphy et al., 2005; Pinto et al., 2010, 2015; Wil-
6040 • J. Neurosci., June 21, 2017 • 37(25):6031–6042
Siu, Beshara et al. • Development of Human Visual Cortex
 liams et al., 2010; Siu et al., 2015). The glutamatergic proteins
studied here are central players in visually driven plasticity, re-
ceptive field properties, and visual function. We found a late shift
in the 2A:2B balance and a gradual maturation of GluA2. These
findings will enable researchers to test the efficacy of specific
neuroplasticity-based therapies at different stages of the lifespan.
