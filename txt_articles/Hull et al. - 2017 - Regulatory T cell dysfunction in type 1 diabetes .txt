Abstract Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease
characterised by the destruction of insulin producing beta cells
in the pancreas. Whilst it remains unclear what the original
triggering factors for this destruction are, observations from
the natural history of human type 1 diabetes, including inci-
dence rates in twins, suggest that the disease results from a
combination of genetic and environmental factors. Whilst
many different immune cells have been implicated, including
members of the innate and adaptive immune systems, a view
has emerged over the past 10 years that beta cell damage is
mediated by the combined actions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
with specificity for islet autoantigens. In health, these poten-
tially pathogenic T cells are held in check by multiple regula-
tory mechanisms, known collectively as ‘immunological tol-
erance’. This raises the question as to whether type 1 diabetes
develops, at least in part, as a result of a defect in one or more
of these control mechanisms. Immunological tolerance in-
cludes both central mechanisms (purging of the T cell reper-
toire of high-affinity autoreactive T cells in the thymus) and
peripheral mechanisms, a major component of which is the
action of a specialised subpopulation of T cells, known as
regulatory T cells (Tregs). In this review, we highlight the
evidence suggesting that a reduction in the functional capacity
of different Treg populations contributes to disease develop-
ment in type 1 diabetes. We also address current controversies
regarding the putative causes of this defect and discuss strat-
egies to correct it as a means to reduce or prevent islet destruc-
tion in a clinical setting.

 of Treg-mediated control has been shown to play a role in
numerous autoimmune disorders [2] and in tumour immunol-
ogy Tregs have been implicated as a mechanism by which
tumours evade immune recognition [3].
Regulatory function has been ascribed to a wide variety of
different T cell subpopulations, with sometimes confusing no-
menclature. In this review, we will adopt recent recommenda-
tions and discuss two different populations of CD4+ Tregs,
delineated based on constitutive expression of the transcrip-
tion factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3). More details on Treg
nomenclature, generation and function are shown in the Text
box.
CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs
Perhaps the clearest evidence for a vital role in preventing
autoimmunity has been found for a population of CD4+ Tcells
defined by constitutive expression of high levels of CD25 (the
IL-2 receptor α chain) and expression of the transcription
factor FOXP3. FOXP3+ Tregs can either be generated in the
thymus (tTregs, previously known as naturally occurring
Tregs [nTregs]) or periphery (pTregs, previously called adap-
tive Tregs [aTregs]) [1, 4]. However, because there are cur-
rently no definitive phenotypic markers that can be used to
differentiate between these cell types in humans, we will use
here the generic term ‘FOXP3+ Treg’ to refer to both tTreg and
pTreg subtypes. Generation of FOXP3+ Tregs depends on the
encounter with antigen and signalling via IL-2 [4], a cytokine
vital not only for the generation of these cells but also for their
survival, expansion and function in the periphery [5, 6].
FOXP3+ Tregs exert their suppressive capabilities via several
cell-to-cell-contact-dependent and -contact-independent
mechanisms. Due to high levels of CD25 expression,
FOXP3+ Tregs can act as an ‘IL-2 sink’, depriving pathogenic

Function
A subset of CD4     T cells leave the thymus expressing high levels of FOXP3 and CD25 (tTregs); these 
are pre-committed to a regulatory function.
FOXP3   Tregs can also be generated from naive CD4  CD25     T cells in the periphery (pTregs) [1]. 
Epigenetic profiles of tTregs and pTregs differ subtly; in humans, no definitive markers can be used to 
differentiate them at the single-cell resolution; ‘FOXP3   Treg’ is typically used to refer to both. 
Tr1 cells, a second population of Tregs, do not constitutively express FOXP3 but secrete high levels of 
IL-10 [46].
tTregs are generated by a process involving: (1) moderate–high TCR signalling owing to self-peptides 
presented by specialised APCs; followed by (2) IL-2 signalling, stabilising FOXP3 expression [4]. 
pTregs are generated in vivo via: (1) recognition of self or foreign antigens displayed in a tolerogenic 
milieu, presented by immature dendritic cells; and (2) signalling via IL-2 and/or TGF-β, leading to expres-
sion of FOXP3 and gain of regulatory function [77, 78]. 
FOXP3    Tregs can also be induced in vitro from naive or memory T cells (referred to as induced Tregs).
tTregs and pTregs suppress immune responses via: (1) constitutive expression of CD25, preventing 
proliferation/differentiation of Teffs via IL-2 signalling [7]; (2) cell-to-cell contact mechanisms (e.g. involv-
ing cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4] and granzymes) [98, 99]; and (3) secretion of 
soluble immunosuppressive factors (including IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-β) [8, 100, 101].  
iTregs share many properties with ex vivo-isolated Tregs, although important differences exist, including 
lack of stability of regulatory function and dissimilar epigenetic methylation patterns [77].  
Following induction of Tr1 cells in the periphery, they co-express CD49b and lymphocyte-activation gene 
3 (LAG-3) [102], and exert their regulatory function by multiple mechanisms, including secretion of IL-10 
and TGF-β [47, 103–107].

 Tcells of this growth factor [7]. Suppression can also occur by
secretion of suppressive soluble factors, such as TGF-β, IL-
10, IL-35 and adenosine, as well as expression of molecules
such as lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), cytotoxic T
lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and granzyme B
[8]. The clearest link between FOXP3+ Tregs and autoimmu-
nity comes from the disorder immunodysregulation
polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome (IPEX),
in which there are loss-of-function mutations in the FOXP3
gene [9]. Affected individuals develop a wide range of immu-
nopathology and autoimmune disorders, including type 1 di-
abetes in >80% of individuals before the age of 2 years. This
demonstrates that, if profound, defects in FOXP3+ Tregs can
elicit type 1 diabetes in most individuals regardless of other
genetic or environmental influences, thus pointing to a key
role for these cells in maintaining islet-specific tolerance.
Similarly, scurfy mice, lacking a functional Foxp3 gene, dis-
play a profoundly dysregulated immune system, including
severe generalised autoimmunity, and die of uncontrolled
lymphoproliferative disease [10]. Conversely, therapies that
increase the number or functional capacity of FOXP3+ Tregs
can lead to prevention or cure of disease in preclinical models
of autoimmunity, including type 1 diabetes [11].
Defective FOXP3+ Treg function: a key
immunophenotype in type 1 diabetes
The importance of understanding whether type 1 diabetes is
caused by defective immune regulation is clear: not only could
it clarify aspects of type 1 diabetes pathogenesis but it could
also identify and lead to the development of novel therapeutic
interventions or adoptive transfer strategies that specifically
strengthen regulatory pathways and, thereby, delay or prevent
disease onset in at-risk individuals. Although the defects are
not as profound as those seen in individuals affected by IPEX,
there is mounting evidence that individuals with polygenic
type 1 diabetes display alterations in the fitness and function
of FOXP3+ Tregs. The theory that such alteration may con-
tribute to disease pathogenesis is supported by the observation
that many of the type 1 diabetes susceptibility loci identified
by genome-wide association studies may well influence Treg
function (e.g. IL2RA, IL2, PTPN2, CTLA4 and IL10) [12], a
theme that is discussed in more detail below.
One early report suggested that FOXP3+ Tregs (defined as
CD4+CD25+ T cells) were decreased in frequency in individ-
uals with type 1 diabetes (vs control individuals without dia-
betes) [13]. However, the use of more accurate markers to
define these Tregs, including low expression of CD127 and
expression of FOXP3, has led to a consensus that the overall
frequency of FOXP3+ Tregs is unaltered in individuals with
type 1 diabetes [14–17]. It is worth noting that these markers
are not perfect and that in humans, for example, FOXP3 is
transiently upregulated on recently activated effector T cells
(Teff), meaning that cells identified by this phenotype are
likely to contain a mixture of Tregs and non-regulatory cells
[18]. More recently, the selective demethylation of certain
regions of the FOXP3 locus (the Treg-specific demethylated
region [TSDR]) has been used to identify stable, functionally
competent Tregs, allowing their discrimination from activated
CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Teffs [19–21]. However, to date, no
difference in the frequency of FOXP3+ Tregs has been report-
ed using this or any other enumeration method. Recently, it
has also become clear that FOXP3+ Tregs are not simply a
population of cells sharing a common phenotype but are in
fact a heterogeneous mixture of cellular phenotypic subtypes
that reflect different states of maturation, differentiation and
activation, or use different methods or targets of suppression
[22, 23]. It is therefore possible that a shift in the balance or
alteration in the frequency of a subtype of Tregs might be
present in type 1 diabetes. Indeed Okubo et al recently dem-
onstrated that the frequency of activated FOXP3+ Tregs was
reduced in individuals with type 1 diabetes when compared
with control individuals without diabetes [24].
In contrast to studies examining the frequency of Tregs,
there is now a large body of evidence to suggest that
FOXP3+ Treg function is altered in those with type 1 diabetes.
In 2005, Lindley and colleagues reported for the first time that
Tregs from individuals with type 1 diabetes were less able to
control the proliferation of autologous Teffs than Tregs from
HLA- and age-matched control individuals [14], a finding
since confirmed by many other researchers [15, 25–28].
Furthermore, not only was suppression of proliferation altered
in these co-cultures, but also the balance of cytokines pro-
duced was seen to differ: cells from individuals with diabetes
produced predominantly proinflammatory cytokines, whereas
the co-cultures from individuals without diabetes were domi-
nated by anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10.
Importantly, this reduced suppression is not only present close
to diagnosis but is also present in individuals who have had
type 1 diabetes for over 20 years. Reduced suppression thus
appears to be consistent in type 1 diabetes over time, suggest-
ing that the functional defect represents a stable phenotype.
While decreased FOXP3+ Treg suppression has been ob-
served independently by several groups, important questions
remain regarding the cause, timing and relevance of these
findings.
What causes reduced FOXP3+ Treg-mediated suppres-
sion? The reduction in suppression observed in the studies
described above could result from changes in either responder
or regulatory T cells that were present in the co-cultures. This
is a key issue, since many immunotherapy trials are aimed at
improving Treg function in those with type 1 diabetes and
understanding the nature of the defect is critical for correcting
it. This important question has been examined in case–control

1841
 studies using crossover co-cultures, mixing Tregs and Teffs.
These studies observed both effector cell resistance to regula-
tion and reduced Treg suppressive function in type 1 diabetes,
with the relative contribution of each phenotype to reduced
regulation varying between individuals [27, 28].
In contrast, data from the NOD mouse model of autoim-
mune diabetes suggest that increasing resistance to Teff regu-
lation with disease progression [29] is the primary cause for
reduced suppression. However, there are key differences be-
tween type 1 diabetes and the preclinical model. For example,
although it has been suggested that a relative deficiency in the
strength of IL-2 signalling received by FOXP3+ Tregs in both
mice and humans may play a key role in their functional
deficiency (as discussed below in more detail), in mice this
may be mainly driven by polymorphisms in IL2, resulting in
reduced IL-2 production by Teffs [30], while in humans, in
addition to the type 1 diabetes-associated polymorphisms in
IL2, other disease-associated polymorphisms that confer
higher risk are also present in key elements of the IL-2 recep-
tor (IL2RA and IL2RB) and molecules/phosphatases modulat-
ing downstream signalling of IL-2 (e.g. PTPN2) [12, 31, 32].
In humans, therefore, the genes that are most relevant to Teff
regulation exert their greatest effect in cells reliant upon IL-2
signalling for function and survival, such as Tregs. Thus, in
human type 1 diabetes, ‘resistance to regulation’ may also be
explained by the inability of Teffs to provide an environment
conducive to Treg fitness and function, further compounded
by intrinsic Treg defects.
In support of these concepts, in individuals with type 1
diabetes a wide variety of intrinsic differences within the
Treg population has been reported, most of which could be
viewed as representing less-fit or less-stable FOXP3+ Tregs
(see Table 1 for details). Alterations in the Treg population in
type 1 diabetes include increased levels of Treg apoptosis [25,
26], a decrease in the stability of FOXP3 expression [33, 34]
and an increase in the frequency of Tregs that produce proin-
flammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and IL-17 [35, 36].
More recently, in an elegant study, Pesenacker and colleagues
examined the expression of a panel of FOXP3+ Treg-specific
transcripts in Tregs freshly isolated from individuals with
recent-onset type 1 diabetes and well-matched individuals
without diabetes [37]. They identified a panel of six genes,
including FOXP3, TNFRSF1B (CD120b) and LRRC32
(GARP), which were directly linked to Treg function and sta-
bility and were differentially expressed in Tregs from individ-
uals with diabetes. Similarly, other studies have identified
subtle differences in gene expression profiles in Tregs accord-
ing to type 1 diabetes presence or absence [38].
Given the key role that IL-2 signalling plays in maintaining
FOXP3 expression, thereby maintaining Treg fitness, it has
been postulated that many of the Treg-intrinsic defects ob-
served in type 1 diabetes may be caused by a relative reduction
in IL-2 signalling. Indeed, transcriptional profiles of Tregs
from individuals with recent-onset diabetes share many fea-
tures with IL-2-starved, apoptosis-prone Tregs. Yang and col-
leagues recently linked many of these associations together for
the first time, demonstrating that individuals with type 1 dia-
betes and low IL-2 signalling had Tregs that were less able to
maintain FOXP3 expression under limiting concentrations of
IL-2 and displayed reduced suppressor function [39].
Although our knowledge of factors that influence FOXP3+
Treg stability and function has increased rapidly over the past
few years, and the possibility that differential IL-2 signalling
may explain at least some of the differences seen in those with
type 1 diabetes, a full understanding of the precise molecular
basis underlying FOXP3+ Treg dysfunction in type 1 diabetes
is still lacking and warrants further investigation. In summary,
the fitness and function of Tregs and Teffs may be inextricably
linked. However, phenotypic differences are clearly observ-
able in Tregs when comparing those from individuals with and
without type 1 diabetes, irrespective of whether this is primar-
ily a case of ‘nature’ or ‘nurture’.
Is reduced FOXP3+ Treg function a cause or effect of dis-
ease? To better understand how tolerance is lost in type 1
diabetes, a key issue to address is whether the decreased sup-
pressive capability of Tregs is due to changes in the immune
system that are caused by development of type 1 diabetes or
whether Treg dysfunction is involved in disease initiation.
Studies examining Treg function in individuals with stage 1
diabetes, as defined by autoantibody positivity, suggest that
Treg defects pre-date clinical disease, supporting a causative
role for Treg dysfunction [26, 40]. However, interpretation of
these results is not straightforward because although these
individuals do not show overt diabetes, they may already have
islet inflammation which could influence Treg function. An
alternative approach is to assess Treg fitness and function in
individuals who possess a high-risk haplotype for type 1 dia-
betes but who have no evidence of disease. These genotype–
phenotype studies rest on the hypothesis that if a type 1 dia-
betes susceptibility genotype is associated with altered Treg
function, then Treg dysfunction is likely to be causal in type 1
diabetes. To date, such studies have demonstrated that poly-
morphisms in IL2RA and PTPN2 are indeed associated with
reduced Treg fitness and/or function in the absence of disease
[32, 34]. These observations in individuals without diabetes
are supported by similar genotype–phenotype studies in indi-
viduals with type 1 diabetes, including the associations be-
tween Treg IL-2 sensitivity and IL2RA genotype [39] and
between Treg apoptosis and HLA class II haplotype [41].
While these studies all support a causative role for Treg dys-
function in type 1 diabetes, to fully understand the timing of
Treg dysfunction and its relationship with disease progression,
longitudinal studies are required that follow individuals at
high risk through the stages of type 1 diabetes. Such studies
may lead to the correlation of Treg function with the
1842

 breakdown of immunological tolerance, the emergence of ac-
tivated autoreactive T cells and the progression to beta cell
destruction.
Where does the imbalance in FOXP3+ Treg function oc-
cur? The studies discussed so far demonstrate reduced
FOXP3+ Treg function in type 1 diabetes, but an important
caveat is that their conclusions are drawn based on a pheno-
type found in circulating peripheral Tregs rather than Tregs
present at the site of tissue damage. Studies in the NOD mouse
have highlighted the fact that Treg dysfunction is mainly lim-
ited to the pancreas and draining lymph nodes. In this model
of type 1 diabetes, as the disease develops the frequency of
Tregs increases in the pancreatic draining lymph node (PLN)
but decreases in the pancreas, with reduced Treg CD25 ex-
pression and an increase in apoptosis being observed.
Successful treatment of NOD mice by IL-2 therapy, leading
to reversal of disease, specifically prevents the loss of Tregs in
the pancreas [11], demonstrating the importance of studying
Tregs from the site of tissue damage.
Although such studies are not easily performed in human
type 1 diabetes, relevant observations have been made using
tissue recovered from donor cadavers. Interestingly, these
studies have revealed important differences between mouse
and human insulitis. Most notably, infiltration in human islets
is far less florid than seen in mouse islets and rarely contains

 any FOXP3+ Tregs, suggesting that regulation of the immune
response takes place at another location [42]. In this regard, an
important study by Ferraro and colleagues revealed differ-
ences in Tregs from the PLN of individuals with type 1 dia-
betes [43]. These investigators observed decreased levels of
suppression by Tregs obtained from the PLN of individuals
with type 1 diabetes and an increase in secretion of the proin-
flammatory cytokine IL-17. These studies demonstrate the
importance of tissue-specific investigations and suggest that
the PLN may be a key site of Treg dysfunction in type 1
diabetes. Furthermore, detailed studies using cells isolated
from a variety of anatomical sites, such as those available
via the JDRF-sponsored Network for Pancreatic Organ donors
with Diabetes programme (nPOD), will be vital for gaining a
deeper insight into immune dysregulation in type 1 diabetes
closer to the target organ.
Is reduced FOXP3+ Treg function universal in type 1 dia-
betes? Another topic worthy of discussion is the degree of
heterogeneity of Treg function observed in all studies to date.
From the studies described above, one could conclude that
reduced Treg function plays a role in all type 1 diabetes de-
velopment. However, it is worth noting that, to date, all studies
examining FOXP3+ Treg function have found a large degree
of overlap between individuals with and without type 1 dia-
betes, with only a subgroup of individuals with type 1 diabetes
clearly displaying the immune phenotype associated with
poor function. This suggests that the reduced Treg function
observed using these assays may be restricted to, or more
easily revealed in, a subset of individuals with type 1 diabetes.
Understanding how to stratify individuals in terms of the spe-
cific defects that have led to an imbalanced immune response
will be critical when deciding who is likely to benefit from a
given immunotherapy. An example highlighting the heteroge-
neity seen within type 1 diabetes cohorts demonstrated varia-
tion in the IL-2 sensitivity of Tregs from different individuals
[44]. Those with reduced Treg IL-2 sensitivity had unstable
FOXP3 expression and poor suppressor capabilities and it is
possible that these individuals would benefit from IL-2 immu-
notherapy. As we continue to develop our understanding of
the heterogeneity present within individuals with type 1 dia-
betes, it is important to test potential therapies in those who are
most likely to benefit from a given treatment, highlighting the
need for a personalised approach to immunotherapy in type 1
diabetes.
CD4+FOXP3− Treg cells
In addition to FOXP3+ Tregs, other subsets of CD4 T cells
with regulatory properties have been described, including
one characterised by secretion of high levels of IL-10 upon
recognition of cognate peptide. Often referred to as T
regulatory type 1 (Tr1) Tregs, these cells were first de-
scribed in individuals who developed tolerance following
HLA-mismatched haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation
[45]. Tr1 cells are capable of suppressing T cell responses
and modulating antigen-presenting cell (APC) function via
a variety of mechanisms, including expression of inhibitory
cell surface receptors, cytolytic activity and secretion of
soluble factors [46]. The mechanism by which Tr1 cells
are naturally induced in vivo remains poorly understood,
although evidence from mouse models and human studies
suggests that they are generated from naive CD4 T cells
upon repeated stimulation with self or foreign antigens pre-
sented by immature or tolerogenic dendritic cells.
Numerous experimental models have demonstrated that
Tr1 cells play a key role in maintaining tolerance to both
self-antigens and gut microbiota [46]. Furthermore, defects
in the number and/or functional potential of Tr1 (or Tr1-
like) cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a
range of human autoimmune [47–49] and allergic condi-
tions [50].
Islet-specific IL-10-secreting cells in type 1 diabetes A
mounting body of evidence now suggests that islet-
specific Tr1-like cells may play an important role in the
development of type 1 diabetes. In 2004 Arif and colleagues
identified a novel population of naturally arising CD4+ T
cells that secrete IL-10 following exposure to islet
autoantigens [51]. Subsequent isolation and functional
characterisation of these naturally occurring islet-specific
T cells from individuals without diabetes demonstrated that
they share many properties with Tr1 cells and exert a potent
regulatory function. In vitro, this regulatory function is pri-
marily mediated by the specific destruction of APCs
presenting islet peptides. This mechanism prevents activa-
tion of proinflammatory T cells by the same APC and, if
operational in vivo, would represent a potentially important
mechanism of maintaining antigen-specific tolerance.
Studies investigating the frequency of these cells in individ-
uals with varying backgrounds of islet autoimmunity have
made several important observations. First, these cells are
enriched in those at risk of type 1 diabetes but with no evi-
dence of pathogenic islet autoimmunity, such as individuals
without diabetes but carrying high-risk HLA class II mole-
cules [51]. Second, IL-10-secreting Tregs that are observed
in those with type 1 diabetes are associated with less-
aggressive autoimmunity as demonstrated by a reduced
magnitude of proinflammatory islet-specific T cells and
fewer autoantibodies [52], a later age of onset [51] and su-
perior glycaemic control after diagnosis [53]. Third, al-
though the overall frequency of islet-specific IL-10-
secreting T cells does not differ between those with type 1
diabetes and autoantibody-negative first-degree relatives
(FDRs), cells from FDRs were observed to secrete more
1844
Diabetologia (2017) 60:1839–1850
 IL-10, suggesting potential functional differences in these
cells; this warrants further investigation [54]. Taken togeth-
er, these data suggest that islet-specific IL-10-secreting cells
are associated with protection from pathological islet auto-
immunity and offer a potentially powerful method by which
to strengthen tolerance in an antigen-specific manner.
Promoting immune regulation in type 1 diabetes
Despite heterogeneity within type 1 diabetes cohorts, pro-
moting immune regulation, even in individuals who do not
have reduced Treg frequency or function, may tip the bal-
ance of the immune response enough to promote protection
of beta cells. Evidence is mounting from clinical studies in
type 1 diabetes and other conditions characterised by im-
mune dysregulation that such therapeutic approaches
might have an impact upon established and developing
disease (see Fig. 1 for a summary of Treg defects and
current immunotherapies aimed at strengthening immune
regulation).
Agents that alter the balance of effector:regulatory T cells
Several monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule therapies
that were initially developed to treat other diseases have been
found to demonstrate clinical benefit in type 1 diabetes and
may operate by altering Treg frequency or function. Treatment

Fig. 1 Alterations in Treg phenotype and function observed in type 1
diabetes. FOXP3+ Tregs from individuals with type 1 diabetes are less
able to control the proliferation of and cytokine production by effector
CD4+ T cells compared with those from individuals without diabetes.
This defective regulation may be owing to two non-mutually exclusive
factors: differences in the Teff population (shown in red boxes) and/or
Treg intrinsic defects (shown in blue boxes) (where differences overlap,
details are shown in red/blue boxes). Additionally, the frequency and
function of induced Tregs (iTregs) may play a role in promoting imbal-
ance of the immune system in type 1 diabetes (green boxes). In many
cases, these immunophenotypes may be influenced by gene polymor-
phisms associated with type 1 diabetes susceptibility (shown in grey
boxes). Potential avenues for strengthening immune regulation by Treg
invigoration are indicated in beige boxes. Red circles, IFN-γ/IL-17; green

ly decreased dependency on exogenous insulin 24 months
after treatment [55]. This effect correlated with an increase
in the ratio of FOXP3+ Tregs to CD4+ and CD8+ effector
and central memory T cells. In another study, combination
therapy with antithymocyte globulin and granulocyte colony
stimulating factor increased or preserved beta cell function in
individuals with type 1 diabetes when measured 1 year fol-
lowing treatment [56] and this was associated with a higher
frequency of FOXP3+ Tregs. Taken together, these studies
support further investigation of the therapeutic potential of
Tregs in type 1 diabetes.
Monoclonal antibody therapies blocking proinflammatory
cytokines may also represent a method by which Treg func-
tion can be promoted. It is well known that Treg-mediated
suppression can be reduced in the presence of pro-
inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6. The potential of anti-
IL-6 therapy has previously been demonstrated in a variety of
conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus and
Crohn’s disease (reviewed by Nepom et al [57]) and a clinical
trial testing anti-IL6 therapy in type 1 diabetes has begun
(ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT02293837) [58].
Direct targeting of FOXP3+ Tregs by IL-2 administration
Clinical trials have now begun testing therapies that are spe-
cifically designed to promote the expansion or function of
FOXP3+ Tregs in type 1 diabetes. One such strategy, support-
ed by observations on Treg dysfunction, is to use exogenously
administered low-dose IL-2 to selectively promote Treg func-
tion with the rationale that Tregs respond to lower doses of IL-
2 compared with other cells of the immune system because of
their high expression levels of CD25 [59]. Similar studies in
other conditions marked by immune dysregulation, including
chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) [60, 61], hepatitis C
virus-induced vasculitis [62], systemic lupus erythematosus
[63] and alopecia areata [64], have been conducted with en-
couraging results. A Phase I/II clinical trial in type 1 diabetes
[65] demonstrated the safety of low-dose IL-2 administration
and an increase in the frequency of pTregs was observed.
Similar studies in other conditions marked by immune dys-
regulation have shown great promise and clinical benefit in
some individuals. A second clinical trial, conducted by
Diabetes TrialNet and the Immune Tolerance Network, used
higher doses of IL-2 in combination with the inhibitor of the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), rapamycin. While
this therapy led to an increase in Treg frequency, it also in-
duced a transient reduction in beta cell function, possibly ow-
ing to off-target effects on other cell populations such as nat-
ural killer (NK) cells [66, 67]. This study clearly highlights the
importance of carefully assessing the dose and frequency of
IL-2 administration to selectively target Tregs while avoiding
unwanted off-target effects. These issues are being investigat-
ed intensively in mechanistic studies with immunological end-
points prior to conducting fully powered Phase II efficacy
trials [68, 69].
Adoptive Treg cell therapy An alternative method to pro-
mote immune regulation by Tregs is to increase their fre-
quency by adoptively transferring autologous Treg popula-
tions. Recent advances in cell sorting allow for the isolation
of highly pure FOXP3+ Tregs, under conditions of good
manufacturing practice, using a cell surface phenotype of
CD4+CD25highCD127low. Subsequent polyclonal stimula-
tion of isolated FOXP3+ Tregs ex vivo leads to the expansion
ofbillionsofcellsfromasingleblooddraw,allowingfortheir
therapeutic potential to be explored. The first clinical trial
applying adoptive polyclonal Treg therapy to type 1 diabetes
was completed in 2012 [70]. Administration of autologous,
expanded CD4+CD25highCD127low Tregs to children within
2 months of type 1 diabetes diagnosis significantly increased
pTreg frequency, coinciding with a decrease in dependency
on exogenous insulin. A 1 year follow-up study showed that
8 out of 12 children treated with Tregs required less exoge-
nous insulin and two children were independent of exoge-
nous insulin [71]. A second Phase I safety trial in individuals
diagnosed with type 1 diabetes within 2 years of recruitment
was also completed in 2015, further demonstrating the safety
and feasibility of this approach [72].
While the initial clinical trials using polyclonal Treg thera-
py in type 1 diabetes demonstrate the feasibility and safety of
this approach, studies in the NOD mouse suggest that islet
antigen-specific Tregs would be more efficacious as a therapy
[73–75]. Large populations of murine antigen-specific Tregs
can be produced with ease using T cell receptor (TCR)-trans-
genic mice, but in humans this is difficult as islet antigen-
specific Tregs within the pTreg pool are very rare. Selective
expansion of antigen-specific Tregs has been used to produce
alloantigen-specific populations to treat GvHD. Tregs specific
for alloantigens presented by donor-derived B cells stimulated
with CD40 ligand were successfully expanded to clinically
relevant numbers [76]. This approach is unlikely to be suc-
cessful in type 1 diabetes as there are fewer antigens involved
in the autoimmune response and, therefore, Tregs with a rele-
vant specificity have an even lower frequency. Expansion of
all islet antigen-specific CD4+ T cells could also be a strategy,
since stimulation of Teffs via their TCR has been found to
induce a subpopulation of cells with regulatory potential
[77] and the presence of TGF-β in cultures has also been
shown to induce Treg populations [78]. Using culture condi-
tions to skew T cells towards a regulatory phenotype has the
disadvantage that once cells are adoptively transferred, the
stability of their regulatory phenotype is unknown. One option
to improve the stability of Treg populations is by ectopic ex-
pression of FOXP3 to achieve a homogeneous FOXP3+ Treg
1846

 population with potent regulatory potential [79, 80]. An alter-
native that has received a great deal of attention in both auto-
immunity and cancer therapy is the redirection of T cell spec-
ificity using TCR gene therapy. In type 1 diabetes, the antigen
specificity of polyclonal Treg populations could be redirected
towards islet antigens to produce large populations of islet
antigen-specific Tregs. A proof of principle study has indeed
demonstrated that human Treg antigen specificity can be
redirected by TCR gene transfer [81].
Further development of adoptive Treg therapy may need to
consider the homing potential of Treg populations in addition
to their antigen specificities. It has previously been demon-
strated in the NOD mouse that adoptive transfer of CD62L+
but not CD62L− Tregs inhibited type 1 diabetes development.
In humans, isolation of CD45RA+ rather than CD45RA−
Tregs produced a homogeneous population of Tregs that
expressed lymph node homing receptors, including CCR7
and CD62L [22, 82]. The use of drugs, such as rapamycin
and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), influences the homing sig-
natures of human Treg populations produced for adoptive cell
therapy. Tregs expanded in the presence of rapamycin express
skin homing receptors, such as CCR4, while those expanded
in the presence of ATRA express gut homing receptors, such
as α4β7 integrin [83]. Expansion using a combination of both
drugs produces a Treg population with a diverse range of
homing receptors. Together, these data provide an insight into
how isolation and expansion methods can be used to ‘imprint’
different homing profiles on Treg populations, adding an ad-
ditional level of control. The use of adoptive Treg therapy in
type 1 diabetes may be in its infancy but recent advances in the
fields of cancer and transplantation demonstrate that adoptive
cell therapies may hold great promise for rebalancing the hu-
man immune system.
Expanding islet-specific Tregs by antigen-specific immu-
notherapy It has long been acknowledged that administration
of antigens or peptides under tolerogenic conditions has the
potential to induce or expand populations of antigen-specific
Tregs capable of modulating disease. In animal models of type
1 diabetes, administration of islet autoantigen using a variety
of tolerogenic regimens has provided protection against islet
destruction, which is often associated with an increase in IL-
10 production by CD4+ T cells, although in many cases the
regulatory potential of these cells is not well understood
[84–86]. More recently, in a humanised HLA-transgenic
mouse model of islet autoimmunity, Gibson and colleagues
demonstrated that, while peptide presented by tolerogenic
dendritic cells controlled autoimmunity and was associated
with islet-specific IL-10 production, intradermal injection of
the same peptide also reduced autoimmunity and increased the
proliferation of FOXP3+ Tregs [87]. This elegantly demon-
strates that the route and method of delivery of an antigen-
specific immunotherapy can influence the mechanism by
which it may afford protection. In human type 1 diabetes,
administration of the islet autoantigen GAD65 in alum result-
ed in some preservation of islet function in new-onset type 1
diabetes in Phase II trials [88] but failed to meet its primary
endpoints in Phase III trials [89]. Treatment was associated
with increased expression of FOXP3 in Tcells stimulated with
GAD65 ex vivo, although this response was not associated
with preserved C-peptide and it was unclear whether it
reflected an increase in bona fide FOXP3+ Tregs or activated
Teffs [90]. In a 2009 Phase I study in individuals with type 1
diabetes, those who were given low doses of proinsulin pep-
tide showed an increase in peptide-specific IL-10 responses
when compared with individuals given placebo, demonstrat-
ing proof of concept [91]. Other trials using islet peptides
representing known epitopes recognised by CD4+ T cells are
ongoing. Several of these involve novel methods of delivery
aimed at increasing the potential to induce Treg responses,
including loading peptide onto tolerogenic dendritic cells
[92] or conjugating the peptides to nanoparticles [93], and
appear to induce populations of Tregs with similar properties
to the naturally occurring IL-10-secreting cells described
above [94, 95].
Compared with the progress in other fields (such as aller-
gy), antigen-specific immunotherapy in type 1 diabetes may
still be in its infancy. However, it remains a potentially pow-
erful weapon that has the potential to specifically control islet
autoimmunity, thereby avoiding many of the potential adverse
events that may be associated with more generalised
immunosuppression.
Conclusions
Partly fuelled by observations of diminished Treg function or
frequency in type 1 diabetes, the strengthening of immuno-
regulation by Treg invigoration is a major area of clinical trial
activity. However, despite the focus of several high-profile
clinical studies on increasing Tregs via therapeutic interven-
tion, key questions remain unanswered: when and precisely
how do changes in Treg populations arise? How can we best
identify individuals with dysfunctional Tregs? Who will ben-
efit from particular forms of immunotherapy? What are the
best ways to increase Treg frequency or function? Gaining a
better understanding of the natural history of Treg function in
type 1 diabetes and unravelling the molecular profile of func-
tional and dysfunctional Treg subsets has the potential to in-
crease our understanding of the molecular basis of type 1
diabetes and may reveal new targets for immunotherapy.
These studies may also identify biomarkers that can be de-
ployed in ongoing clinical trials and ultimately offer the po-
tential to stratify individuals who may benefit most from Treg-
strengthening therapies.
