ABSTRACT 
27 
Recent years have drawn attention to the link between lateral bias and cerebral functional 
28 
asymmetry in animals.  Most studies of animal laterality have focused on limb use arising 
29 
from forced experimental challenges as opposed to spontaneous behaviours.  This study 
30 
explored, for the first time, the expression of lateralised spontaneous behaviour in the 
31 
domestic cat, a species that exhibits motor bias in the form of paw preferences.  The side used 
32 
by 44 pet cats to perform three spontaneous behaviours (lying side, stepping down a flight of 
33 
stairs, stepping over a raised object) was recorded.  Paw preferences were also assessed using 
34 
a more traditional forced food reaching challenge.  Cats showed a significant lateral bias for 
35 
food reaching (73%), stepping down (70%) and stepping over (66%).  Paw-preferent animals, 
36 
however, did not differ significantly in their tendency towards left- or right-sideness.  The 
37 
direction of the cats’ side preferences was significantly correlated for most of the measures, 
38 
whether forced or spontaneous.  The strength of the cats’ motor bias was significantly related 
39 
to task; animals displayed a weaker lateral bias for lying side than any of the other measures.  
40 
The study revealed a sex split in the direction, although not the strength, of the cats’ lateral 
41 
bias for food reaching, stepping down and stepping over.  Male animals showed a significant 
42 
preference for using their left paw on these measures, while females were more inclined 
43 
towards right-sideness. The study provides the first evidence that the domestic cat displays 
44 
motor laterality on specific spontaneous behaviours, and that the direction, although not the 
45 
strength, of these lateral biases is largely consistent with that of an experimental task.  The 
46 
results suggest that the more forced food reaching test traditionally used to assess motor bias 
47 
in the cat offers a biologically valid measure of limb use in this species.

INTRODUCTION 
51 
One of the most prevalent features of human behaviour is motor laterality, defined as the 
52 
preferred use of one limb over another (e.g., Harris, 1983; Springer & Deutsch, 1989).  The 
53 
most obvious display of motor bias in humans is handedness.  An estimated 90% of people 
54 
prefer to use their right hand for most activities, including tool-use, teeth brushing and 
55 
writing (Annett, 1985; Porac & Coren, 1981). 
56 
 
57 
It was previously believed that lateralised behaviour was a uniquely human trait.  Research 
58 
now indicates, however, that many species of animal (e.g., amphibians, rodents, cats, 
59 
primates, marsupials, whales) display lateralised motor behaviours.  This has led to 
60 
suggestions that lateral bias may be a universal phenomenon (for reviews see Frasnelli, 
61 
Vallortigara & Rogers, 2012; MacNeilage, Rogers & Vallortigara, 2009; Rogers, 2002; 
62 
Rogers, Vallortigara & Andrew, 2013; Vallortigara, Chiandetti & Sovrano, 2010; 
63 
Vallortigara & Rogers, 2005), although whether this exists at the level of group in animals, or 
64 
is related to other aspects of brain asymmetry, is still unclear (see reviews by Corballis, 2009; 
65 
Rogers, 2009; Vallortigara & Versace, 2017; Versace & Vallortigara, 2015). 
66 
 
67 
Studies in the area of animal laterality have typically focused their attention on experiments 
68 
involving forced tasks, notably food reaching.  However, a smaller number of investigations 
69 
have explored the directionality of more spontaneous expressions of animal behaviour.  
70 
Studies have focused on behaviours including the side used for foraging and feeding 
71 
(gorillas- Byrne & Byrne, 1991; Tabiowo & Forrester, 2013; humpback whales- Canning et 
72 
al., 2011; Clapham, Leimkuhler, Gray & Mattila, 1995; Woodward & Winn, 2006; walruses- 
73 
Levermann, Galatius, Ehlme, Rysgaard & Born, 2003), the limb employed to initiate 
74 
movement  (horses- Lucidi et al., 2013; McGreevy & Rogers, 2005; giraffes- Svoke, 2017; 
75 
 4 
 
dogs- Hackert, Maes, Herbin, Libourel, & Abourachid, 2008; Tomkins, Thomson, & 
76 
McGreevy, 2010), grooming (chimpanzees- Marchant & McGrew, 1996), infant cradling 
77 
(chimpanzees- Manning & Chamberlain, 1994; Toback, 1999), clapping (chimpanzees- 
78 
Fletcher, 2006), suckling (horses- Komarkova & Bartosova, 2013; zebra- Pluhacek al. 2013), 
79 
hemifield use (birds- Ventolini, Ferrero, Sponza, Chiesa, Zucca & Vallortigara, 2005), 
80 
turning behaviour (sheep- Versace, Morgante, Pulina & Vallortigara, 2007), ground 
81 
scratching (chicks- Tommasi, 1999), and even urination (dogs- Gough & McGuire, 2015).  
82 
Many, although not all, of these studies suggest that lateral biases can be recorded 
83 
successfully from naturalistic observations of animal behaviour. What is less apparent is 
84 
whether these biases are consistent with those recorded experimentally using more forced 
85 
limb reaching tasks. Indeed, only a small number of studies, all involving primates 
86 
(Campbell’s monkeys- Chapelain, Bec & Blois-Heulin, 2006, Chapelain et al., 2012; red-
87 
capped mangabeys- Chapelain et al., 2012; red-fronted lemurs, Schnoell, Huebner, Kappeler 
88 
& Fichtel, 2014 common marmosets- Hook & Rogers, 2008;), have compared motor 
89 
preferences using these two methodological approaches. Two of the studies (Chapelain et al., 
90 
2006; Schnoell et al., 2014) found that the expression of manual laterality was weaker in 
91 
naturally occurring behaviours (e.g., holding branches, self-grooming, feeding) compared to 
92 
forced limb use on an experimental task. Such findings are in line with the hypothesis 
93 
proposed by Warren (1980) which states that hand preferences should be stronger and more 
94 
rigid in experimental conditions on the basis that laterality is an artificial phenomenon 
95 
created by such situations. Moreover, Schnoell and others (2014) argue that a strong manual 
96 
bias for spontaneous actions may not be ecologically relevant for some species, particularly if 
97 
both hands are needed to ensure health and safety, e.g., swinging across trees.  Nevertheless, 
98 
it seems that studying manual preferences on both experimental tasks and spontaneous 
99 
behaviours may provide more realistic and ecologically valid insights into the evolution and 
100 
 5 
 
significance of lateral biases in an animal’s daily life than the use of only one methodological 
101 
approach. 
102 
 
103 
The following study explored the expression of lateralised spontaneous behaviour in the 
104 
domestic cat, Felis silvestris, a species that has been shown to exhibit motor bias in the form 
105 
of paw preferences (e.g., McDowell, Wells & Hepper, 2016; Pike & Maitland, 1997; Wells & 
106 
Millsopp, 2009, 2012).  We recorded the limb or side used by 44 pet cats to perform three 
107 
spontaneous (i.e., unforced) behaviours (lying side, stepping down a flight of stairs, stepping 
108 
over a raised object).   Each animal’s paw preferences were also assessed using a more 
109 
traditional forced food reaching challenge (McDowell et al., 2016).  The study aimed to 
110 
identify whether asymmetries are consistent using two methodological approaches and 
111 
determine whether spontaneous expressions of natural behaviour can be used as a reliable 
112 
indicator of cerebral asymmetry in the cat.

METHODS 
115 
 
116 
Subjects 
117 
Forty-four neutered pet cats (24 male, 20 female), of mixed breed, aged between 1-17 years 
118 
(mean age=3.98 +/- 0.56 years), participated in the study.  For the purpose of analysis (see 
119 
later), the age of the cats was categorised as ‘young’ (defined as animals between 1-6 years of 
120 
age) and ‘old’ (defined as animals between 6-17 years of age).  There was no significant 
121 
difference in the distribution of male and female animals in the two age groups (χ21=3.26, 
122 
p=0.08).  All of the cats were family pets whose owners had consented to them participating 
123 
in the study.  None of the cats had undergone any behavioural training, nor had any disability 
124 
or behavioural problem preventing them from completing the study. 
125 
 
126 
Laterality measures 
127 
Cats’ lateral preferences were assessed using two approaches, namely, an experimental food 
128 
reaching test and observations of 3 spontaneous behaviours: 
129 
 
130 
Food reaching test 
131 
Cats’ paw preferences for food reaching were assessed using the Catit Senses Food Maze 
132 
(Catit, UK).  This maze is a 35.6cm tall spherical feeding ‘tower’, comprising 3 levels into 
133 
which food can be placed.  The food is accessed via 3 holes on each level (see Figure 1 and 
134 
https://www.catit.com/uk/shop/senses-2-food-tree).  For the purpose of this study, the top 
135 
level of the food maze was removed as it proved too high for the cats to put their paws into 
136 
without standing on their rear legs and compromising balance.  The Catit has been used 
137 
successfully to record cats’ paw preferences (McDowell et al., 2016), and demonstrates good 
138 
test-retest reliability (McDowell, 2017).

141 
 
142 
Spontaneous behaviours 
143 
Three spontaneous behaviours were recorded:  
144 
i)  Lying side 
145 
Lying side has been studied as a measure of lateral bias in quadrupedal species including 
146 
dairy cattle (e.g., Tucker, Cox, Weary & Spinka, 2009) and sheep (Lane & Phillips, 2004).  
147 
Cats typically lie on one side of their body while resting or sleeping.  For this study, owners 
148 
were required to record whether their cat lay down on their left or right side for each 
149 
occurrence of this behaviour.   
150 
 
151 
ii)  Step down 
152 
The “First-stepping” task has been used to successfully measure paw preference in dogs 
153 
(Tomkins et al., 2010).  For this study, owners were required to record the paw (left or right) 
154 
first used by their pet to descend their indoor set of stairs. 
155 
 
156 
iii) Step over 
157 
Many cats use a litter tray for urination and/or defecation (Crowell-Davis, Curtis & Knowles, 
158 
2004). As this is often a tray with a slightly raised perimeter, the cat must lift one of its 
159 
forelimbs to step into it.  For the purpose of this study, owners were therefore required to 
160 
record the paw first used by their cat to enter their litter tray. 
161 
 
162 
To ensure familiarity with the three spontaneous behaviours and increase the objectivity of 
163 
measures between subjects, the cats’ owners were provided with an information sheet 
164 
 8 
 
describing the actions they should expect to witness in their pet.  Any spontaneous 
165 
occurrences of the behaviours made by the subject cats were also pointed out to the owners at 
166 
the time of the Experimenter’s visit to their homes.  In addition, pictures depicting cats 
167 
showing the three activities were presented to the owners.  It was made clear that an animals’ 
168 
use of both paws simultaneously should not be recorded.  Owners were contacted once a 
169 
week to ensure compliance with the protocol and address any concerns. 
170 
 
171 
Procedure 
172 
All of the subjects were tested individually in their own home environment.  Each cat was 
173 
initially required to undertake the experimental food reaching test.  Prior to the start of the 
174 
first trial, the cat was shown, and allowed to sniff, the food treat (Dreamies, Mars Petcare, 
175 
UK - small squares of cheese flavored cat treats). As the cat watched, 10 treats were placed 
176 
on the top (i.e., second) level of the food maze. Since the food could be accessed through 3 
177 
holes, it was ensured that the cat was placed directly in front of one hole for each trial.  As 
178 
and when required (i.e., once all the food treats had been accessed by the cat), another 10 
179 
treats were placed in the food maze.  A single trial comprised the cat placing its paw inside 
180 
the food maze and attempting to remove the treat. Only once the paw had been removed from 
181 
the maze did the next trial begin. The paw the cat used to attempt food retrieval, regardless of 
182 
whether or not a treat was retrieved, was recorded.  Testing was carried out on a daily basis 
183 
until 50 responses were made.  An average of 15 trials were carried out by each cat every day 
184 
to avoid the animals becoming bored, tired or stressed.  No reward, be it tactile (comforting, 
185 
stroking) or social (verbal praise or smiling), was provided during the task. 
186 
 
187 
Laterality data on the cats’ spontaneous behaviours were collected by the subjects’ owners 
188 
over a period of 3 months.  Owners were given a score sheet and asked to record each 
189 
 9 
 
occurrence of the 3 spontaneous behaviours outlined above.  The occurrence of 50 (left plus 
190 
right) expressions of each of the three spontaneous behaviours (lying side, step down, step 
191 
over) was recorded for each subject. Between 15-20 occurrences of each behaviour were 
192 
recorded per month by each cats’ owner.  Data were collected over a range of observation 
193 
sessions (e.g., in the morning, afternoon and evening) for each animal to reduce the 
194 
likelihood of interference from either one-off, or very habitual, events. 
195 
 
196 
Statistical Analysis 
197 
Fifty data points per animal were recorded for each of the laterality measures (food reaching, 
198 
lying side, step down, step over).  Binomial z-scores were calculated to determine whether the 
199 
frequency of right- or left-side use exceeded that expected by chance for each of the 
200 
measures.  An alpha value of 0.05 was adopted for all analyses.  A z-score greater than +1.96 
201 
(two-tailed) reflected a significant left paw preference, whilst a z-score less than -1.96 
202 
indicated a significant right paw preference.  Cats with z-scores between +1.96 and –1.96 
203 
were classified as ambilateral. 
204 
 
205 
A directional handedness index (HI) was calculated (see Wells, 2003) to quantify each cat’s 
206 
lateral preference for each measure on a continuum from strongly left-side preferent (+1) to 
207 
strongly right side-preferent (-1).  The HI was calculated by dividing the difference between 
208 
the total number of left and right side uses by their sum (L-R)/(L+R).  A mixed-design 
209 
ANOVA for the between-subjects factors of feline sex (male, female) and age (young, old) 
210 
and the within-subjects factor of task (food reaching, lying side, step down, step over) was 
211 
carried out to determine whether the direction of the cats’ side preferences differed between 
212 
the tasks or was influenced by the animals’ sex or age.   
213 
 
214 
 10 
 
The strength of the cats’ lateral preferences was calculated by taking the absolute value of 
215 
each HI score (ABS-HI) for each measure.  A mixed-design ANOVA for the between-
216 
subjects factors of feline sex (male, female) and age (young, old) and the within-subjects 
217 
factor of task (food reaching, lying side, step down, step over) was carried out to determine 
218 
whether the strength of the cats’ side preferences differed between the tasks or was 
219 
influenced by the animals’ sex or age. 
220 
 
221 
Finally, Pearson product moment correlations were conducted to compare both the direction 
222 
(HI scores) and strength (ABS-HI scores) of lateral bias across the four tasks to explore for 
223 
any consistencies in strength and/or direction of motor asymmetry. 
224

Ethical Note 
226 
All methods adhered to the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour/ Animal Behavior 
227 
Society Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Research (Association for the Study of Animal 
228 
Behaviour, 2006).  Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Research Ethics 
229 
Committee, School of Psychology, QUB.  All of the cats’ owners were required to complete a 
230 
written consent form at the time of subject recruitment.  Owners were fully informed in 
231 
writing of the study’s purpose and advised that they were free to leave the project and have 
232 
their pets’ data withdrawn at any time.  To minimise stress to the cats, data were collected in 
233 
the subjects’ own homes.  Animals’ paw preferences on the food reaching test were collected 
234 
over an average of 3 days to minimise the risk of inducing tiredness or stress.

RESULTS 
237 
 
238 
Distribution of lateral bias 
239 
 
240 
Food reaching 
241 
The distribution of the cats’ paw preferences on the food reaching test was not significantly 
242 
different to that expected by chance alone (χ22=1.27, P=0.53).  Significantly (P=0.003, 
243 
binomial test) more cats had a paw preference (N=32, 72.7%) than were ambilateral (N=12, 
244 
27.3%), however the paw-preferent cats were no more likely to be left- (N=18, 56.2%) than 
245 
right- (N=14, 43.8%) pawed (P>0.05, binomial test) [Figure 2]. 
246 
 
247 
Lying side 
248 
Analysis revealed that 4 (9.1%) cats preferred to consistently lie on their left side, 7 (15.9%) 
249 
preferred to lie on their right side, while 33 (75.0%) were ambilateral for this behaviour 
250 
(Figure 2).  This distribution of lateral bias was significantly different to that expected by 
251 
chance alone (χ22=34.68, P<0.001).  Significantly (P=0.001, binomial test) more cats were 
252 
ambilateral than side-preferent, but side-preferent cats were no more likely to exhibit a left 
253 
than right side preference for this behaviour (P>0.05, binomial test). 
254 
 
255 
Step down 
256 
Fifteen (34.1%) cats were reported to consistently use their left paw to step down a flight of 
257 
stairs, 16 (36.4%) to use their right paw, while 13 (29.5%) animals were ambilateral (Figure 
258 
2). This distribution of paw use did not differ significantly (χ22=0.32, p=0.85).  Significantly 
259 
(P=0.010, binomial test) more cats were paw-preferent than ambilateral for this behaviour, 
260 
 12 
 
however paw-preferent cats were no more likely to be left- than right-pawed (P>0.05, 
261 
binomial test). 
262 
 
263 
Step over 
264 
Sixteen (36.4%) of the subjects were reported to consistently use their left paw to step over, 
265 
13 (29.5%) to use their right paw and 15 (34.1%) showed no paw preference (Figure 2). This 
266 
distribution of paw preference was not significantly different to that expected by chance 
267 
alone (χ22=0.32, p=0.85).  Significantly (P=0.04, binomial test) more cats were paw-preferent 
268 
for this behaviour than ambilateral, however paw-preferent cats were no more likely to be 
269 
left- than right-pawed (P>0.05, binomial test). 
270 
 
271 
(Figure 2 about here) 
272 
 
273 
Direction of lateral bias 
274 
A mixed-design ANOVA revealed no significant effect of task (F3,120=1.03, P=0.38) on the 
275 
direction of the cats’ motor bias.  This measure was significantly related to feline sex 
276 
(F1,40=5.15, P=0.02), with males favouring their left side (mean HI= 0.15 +/- 0.07) and 
277 
females preferring their right side (mean HI= -0.12 +/- 0.07). The age of the cats was 
278 
unrelated to the direction of the animals’ motor bias (F1,40=0.11, P=0.74). 
279 
 
280 
There was a significant positive correlation in the direction of the cats’ lateral bias between 
281 
the food reaching test and all of the three spontaneous behaviours [P values corrected for 
282 
multiple comparisons] (lying side, R44=0.38, C.I.=0.09-0.67, P<0.05, step down, R44=0.61, 
283 
C.I.=0.37-0.86, P<0.001, step over, R44=0.54, C.I.=0.28-0.80, P<0.001).  HI scores for the 
284 
step down and step over tests were also significantly correlated (R44=0.58, C.I=0.33-0.84, 
285 
 13 
 
P<0.001).  There was no significant correlation in the direction of the cats’ motor preferences 
286 
for behaviours of lying side and step down (R44=0.28, C.I.=-0.02-0.58, P=0.06) or step over 
287 
(R44=0.25, C.I.=-0.48-0.13, P=0.10). 
288 
 
289 
Strength of lateral bias 
290 
The strength of the cats’ lateral bias differed significantly between the tasks (F3,120=4.49, 
291 
P=0.005).  Post-hoc paired t-tests (with P values corrected for multiple comparisons) showed 
292 
that cats displayed a significantly weaker lateral bias for lying side (mean ABS-HI= 0.20 +/-
293

DISCUSSION 
305 
The results from this study provide the first evidence that certain spontaneous behaviours, 
306 
notably those involving limb use, are lateralised in the domestic cat.  The study also suggests 
307 
that food reaching tests, commonly used to assess paw preference in the cat, offer an 
308 
ecologically valid measure of laterality for this species. 
309 
 
310 
The majority of cats in the present study showed a lateral bias on the measures involving paw 
311 
use, i.e., food reaching (73%), step down (70%) and step over (66%).  Paw-preferent animals, 
312 
however, did not differ significantly in their tendency towards left- or right-sideness.  
313 
Previous studies have reported a roughly similar distribution of lateralisation in cats tested on 
314 
a range of challenges designed to assess paw preference (Pike & Maitland, 1997; Tan & 
315 
Kutlu, 1991; Tan, Yaprak & Kutlu, 1990; Wells & Millsopp, 2009, 2012), and, together, 
316 
point strongly to paw use at the level of the individual for this species.  The spontaneous 
317 
behaviour of lying side, the only measure that did not concentrate on paw use, was not found 
318 
to be lateralised, with only 25% of the subjects exhibiting a significant side preference for 
319 
this activity.  With this in mind, future studies on feline laterality may be wiser to focus their 
320 
attention on behaviours involving limb use, which appear to be more reflective of 
321 
hemispheric specialisation in the cat. 
322 
 
323 
The cats’ HI scores were found to be significantly correlated for most of the measures in this 
324 
study, whether forced or spontaneous.  Previous experiments have yielded mixed results 
325 
regarding the consistency of motor bias on experimental tasks vs. expressions of spontaneous 
326 
behaviours, with some authors pointing to a significant relationship between such measures 
327 
(Chapelain et al., 2012), and yet others unearthing no evidence of an association (Chapelain 
328 
et al., 2006; Schnoell et al., 2014).  Much appears to depend on the nature of the measures 
329 
 15 
 
under scrutiny.  Studies which have isolated a specific spontaneous action have reported more 
330 
consistent patterns of motor bias between experimental tasks and natural behaviours than 
331 
those that have combined very different actions.  For instance, Chapelain and associates 
332 
(2012) found consistency in reaching for an object (food) both spontaneously and in a more 
333 
forced experimental set-up in both red-capped mangabeys and Campbell’s monkeys.  By 
334 
contrast, Schnoell and colleagues (2014) reported no consistency in the hand use of red-
335 
fronted lemurs on a forced food reaching task compared to the expression of 5 spontaneous 
336 
actions, e.g., allogrooming, autogrooming, warding off conspecifics.  It may be more 
337 
beneficial and methodologically valid to focus on one specific spontaneous behaviour to get a 
338 
clearer representation of natural laterality, although deciding on an adequate measure has 
339 
proven difficult (e.g., Marchant & McGrew, 1996).  Studies on primates have shown that 
340 
animals often only show lateralised hand use for specific spontaneous actions, e.g., feeding 
341 
(Meguerditchian et al., 2010; Tabiowo & Forrester, 2013), whilst others, often those for 
342 
which there is no biological value to be gained from lateralisation (e.g., lying side, as 
343 
reflected in the present study), are more likely to be ambilateral in nature. 
344 
 
345 
The strength of the cats’ motor bias was found to be related to task, with animals displaying a 
346 
significantly weaker lateral bias for lying side than any of the other measures.  However, 
347 
strength of paw preference did not differ significantly between the food reaching, step down 
348 
or step over tests, as might have been expected.  It has been argued that the synthetic nature 
349 
of an experimental task can create artificially stronger motor asymmetries (Warren, 1980); 
350 
limb preferences tend to be less flexible on forced tasks, and are perhaps more readily 
351 
reinforced, e.g., by food treats.  In a similar vein, the ‘task complexity’ hypothesis argues that 
352 
more complex actions, which tend to demand the use of one hemisphere over the other, 
353 
typically result in a stronger motor bias (Fagot & Vauclair, 1991).  These theories may 
354 
 16 
 
explain why the cats in the present study were more weakly lateralised for the spontaneous 
355 
behaviour of lying side, the least demanding motor challenge.  However, they do not 
356 
necessarily explain why the cats showed no stronger a paw preference on the food reaching 
357 
task.  The findings suggest that limb use on a forced experimental challenge may not be an 
358 
artificial phenomenon, but may, rather, be an ecologically reliable indicator of motor bias for 
359 
the domestic cat.  The findings also lend support for the suggestion that task specific cues 
360 
(e.g., postural support, task complexity) may not influence manual laterality in non-primate 
361 
mammals (Konerding, Hedrich, Bleich, & Zimmerman, 2012). 
362 
 
363 
The study revealed a sex split in the direction, although not the strength, of the cats’ lateral 
364 
bias on the food reaching task and two of the three spontaneous behaviours (step down and 
365 
step over).  In all cases, male animals showed a significant preference for using their left paw, 
366 
while females were more inclined to exhibit a right-sided bias. This sex split has been found 
367 
previously in cats (Wells & Millsopp, 2009, 2012) and other species, e.g., dogs (Quaranta, 
368 
Siniscalchi, Frate & Vallortigara, 2004; Wells, 2003), horses (Murphy, Sutherland, & Arkins, 
369 
2005).  It is the first time, however, that spontaneous actions have been shown to be related to 
370 
feline sex.  Interestingly, the few studies that have reported differences between male and 
371 
female animals for naturalistic behaviours have demonstrated a directional effect similar to 
372 
that observed in this experiment for some tasks (black and white snub-nosed monkeys, Pan, 
373 
Xiao & Zhao, 2011; lemurs, Ward, Milliken, Dodson, Stafford & Wallace, 1990).  It has been 
374 
argued that naturalistic behaviours encouraged the evolution of cerebral specialisation for 
375 
motor dominance (Forrester et al., 2013). Assuming this is the case, a sex split would not 
376 
necessarily be expected for spontaneous actions. Indeed, it would be more efficient and 
377 
generally advantageous for a species to demonstrate population-level laterality for 
378 
 17 
 
spontaneous expressions of behaviour (e.g., Ghirlanda, Frasnelli & Vallortigara, 2009; 
379 
Ghirlanda & Vallortigara, 2004). 
380 
 
381 
In some respects, it is surprising that a sex effect was discovered in this study, since the 
382 
sample was comprised entirely of castrated animals.  Studies on dogs have failed to report an 
383 
effect of canine sex on paw preferences in samples of neutered, or a mixture of de-sexed and 
384 
entire, animals (Batt, Batt, Baguley & McGreevy, 2008; Branson & Rogers, 2006; Schneider, 
385 
Delfabbro & Burns, 2013; Wells, Hepper, Milligan & Barnard, 2017); this has led the authors 
386 
to argue that a hormonal factor may be at play in shaping motor bias.  Further work is needed 
387 
to investigate this, but the strong sex effects reported here, and elsewhere, both on 
388 
experimental challenges and expressions of spontaneous behaviour, and using both castrated 
389 
and de-sexed populations, point more and more strongly to underlying differences in the 
390 
neural architecture of male and female cats. This is perhaps not surprising, given the sex 
391 
differences in brain asymmetries reported across species (see Bianki & Filippova, 2001). 
392 
 
393 
Some authors have reported relative stability in preferred limb use across the lifespan in 
394 
nonhuman species, notably primates (e.g., Hook & Rogers, 2000; Stafford, Milliken & Ward, 
395 
1990).  There was no evidence from the present investigation that paw use differed between 
396 
the younger and older cohorts of cat.   In their earlier studies, Wells and Millsopp (2012) 
397 
found that cats’ paw preferences differ significantly over the course of their first year of life, 
398 
stabilising thereafter.  The youngest cats in the present study were 1 year of age, no doubt 
399 
explaining the lack of any significant age effects.  The findings from this study lend further 
400 
support for the idea that cats, like others species, show stability in paw preferences across 
401 
adulthood, even in the display of naturalistic behaviours. 
402

Conclusions 
404 
The findings from this study provide the first evidence that the domestic cat displays motor 
405 
laterality on specific spontaneous behaviours, notably those involving limb use, and that the 
406 
direction of these lateral biases is largely consistent with that of an experimental task.  The 
407 
results suggest that the more forced food reaching tests traditionally used to assess motor bias 
408 
in the cat offer a biologically valid measure of limb use in this species.  It is clear that both 
409 
context and relevance of lateralisation of particular behaviours are important factors which 
410 
need to be considered when interpreting the results from investigations of this nature.   
411 
However, it could be argued that exploring lateral bias on an experimental task, as well as 
412 
spontaneous expressions of behaviour, may provide more realistic insights into the evolution 
413 
and importance of lateral bias in an animal’s daily life than the use of just one methodological 
414 
approach.  Future studies may also consider exploring other forms of lateral bias in addition 
415 
to limb preferences as an indicator of cerebral asymmetry.  Feral horses, for example, have 
416 
been found to display significant eye preferences in the absence of a limb bias (Austin & 
417 
Rogers, 2012), while common marmosets show a strong bias at the level of the group for eye 
418 
use, but not hand preference (Hook & Rogers, 1998).  Exploring lateral biases beyond limb 
419 
preference may further our understanding of cerebral functioning in nonhuman species.
