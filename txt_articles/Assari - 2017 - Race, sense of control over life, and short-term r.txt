Race, sense of control over life, and short-term risk of 
mortality among older adults in the United States
Shervin Assari 
A b s t r a c t
Introduction: Sense of control over life has been shown to have protective 
health effects in studies that have mostly enrolled White middle class indi-
viduals. It is unknown, however, whether populations differ in the protective 
health gain associated with sense of control over life. This study compared 
a nationally representative sample of Black and White older adults for pro-
tective effects of sense of control over life on short-term risk of all-cause 
mortality in the United States.
Material and methods: This longitudinal prospective study followed 1,493 
White (n = 759) and Black (n = 734) older adults (age 66 or more) from 2001 
to 2004. Race, demographics, socio-economics, sense of control over life, 
health behaviors, and self-rated health were measured at baseline in 2001. 
Outcome was all-cause mortality occurring between 2001 and 2004. Logis-
tic regression models were used for data analysis. 
Results: In the pooled sample, sense of control over life was protective 
against 3-year mortality risk above and beyond demographics, socio-eco-
nomics, health behaviors, and self-rated health. We found a race by sense of 
control over life interaction, suggesting a stronger protective effect of con-
trol over life on mortality risk for Whites compared to Blacks. In race-specific 
models, sense of control over life at baseline was predictive of mortality 
among Whites but not Blacks.
Conclusions: In the United States, Black older adults do not gain a survival 
benefit associated with high levels of sense of control over life, as do their 
White counterparts. It is not clear why sense of control over life translates 
into survival for Whites but not for Blacks.
Key words: health disparities, ethnic groups, African Americans, Blacks, 
mortality, control over life.
Introduction
Similar to other psychological constructs such as locus of control, 
self-efficacy, mastery, self-directedness, personal autonomy, instrumen-
talism, and helplessness, which have been used interchangeably [1], 
sense of control over life also predicts better health status [2]. Individu-
als with a high sense of control over life report higher well-being [3] and 
lower stress, anxiety, and depression [4]. A high level of control is also 
associated with better physical health outcomes such as physical func-
tioning [5] as well as lower risk of cardiovascular disease [6]. A high level 
of control over life also predicts lower risk of mortality [7]. 
Sense of control over life – also known as perceived control, control 
beliefs, or sense of control – refers to subjective expectations regard-

ing one’s ability to exert an influence over life 
circumstances and outcomes in the surrounding 
environment [2]. Sense of control over life is a cog-
nitive style which reflects whether life outcomes 
are subjectively ascribed to the self vs. something 
external to a person. While shaped by age, gender 
[8], life events [9], and sociological and contextual 
factors such as race, education, and marriage [1], 
sense of control is frequently viewed as a stable 
personality trait [10]. In this view, individuals are 
located on a continuum, from having the gener-
alized belief that one can and does master, con-
trol, and shape one’s own life, to the opposite end 
of the continuum, which is perceived powerless-
ness, accompanied by the belief that one’s life is 
shaped by external forces, such as luck, chance, 
fate, or powerful others [7, 11].
In 2014, Turiano et al. studied population vari-
ation in the protective effects of sense of control 
over life on mortality risk. The authors found that 
education level alters how sense of control over 
life predicts risk of all-cause mortality. Control be-
liefs were a predictor of mortality risk only among 
individuals with low but not high education. The 
authors also showed that such an interaction is 
not due to confounders such as health behaviors, 
mood, or health status [7]. Although in the U.S. 
race is a strong proxy of social class [12], it is still 
unknown whether race moderates the protective 
effect of control beliefs. In other terms, it is un-
known whether Blacks and Whites differ in the 
health gain associated with such control beliefs.
In 2016, Assari used follow-up data of 3,361 
Black (n = 1,156) or White (n = 2,205) adults for up 
to 25 years from 1986 to 2011. The author mea-
sured self-efficacy in 1986 and used Cox propor-
tional hazards models to test whether the effect of 
self-efficacy beliefs on risk of mortality depends on 
race. The author found a stronger protective effect 
of self-efficacy on mortality for Whites compared 
to Blacks. In race-specific models, self-efficacy pro-
tected Whites but not Blacks against mortality. The 
author concluded that in the United States, long-
term health gains associated with high self-effica-
cy are not universal but race-specific [13].
In response to the very limited knowledge on 
group differences in the protective effect of control 
beliefs on mortality, the current study compared 
Blacks and Whites for the effects of sense of con-
trol over life on short-term risk of mortality in the 
United States. To provide generalizable results, we 
used nationally representative data. 
Material and methods
Design and setting
This was a longitudinal panel study with three 
years of follow-up. Data came from wave 1 and 
wave 2 of the Religion, Aging, and Health Survey, 
a household survey from 2001 until 2004 [14]. 
Ethics
The project received Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) approval from the University of Michigan. All 
participants provided consent. 
Participants
The study only included White and Black old-
er adults. All participants were non-institution-
alized English speaking people of age more than 
 
65 years. Geographically, the study population 
was restricted to individuals residing in the co-
terminous United States (i.e., residents of Alaska 
and Hawaii were not sampled). The study popula-
tion was limited to Christians or those who were 
never associated with any faith. Older Blacks were 
oversampled in the survey [14]. 
Sampling frame
The study used a random sampling strategy. 
The sampling frame for this study consisted of all 
eligible persons contained in the Medicare Bene-
ficiary list maintained by the Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services (CMS). A five-step process 
was used to draw a sample from the CMS file (54).
Interviews
Data collection was performed by Louis Harris 
and Associates (now Harris Interactive, New York). 
Interviewing began in March 2001 and concluded 
in August 2001 [14].
Measures
Age, race, family income, number of chronic 
medical conditions (13 chronic medical condi-
tions), perceived financial difficulty, self-rated 
health, perceived control over life, and death anx-
iety were measured.
Perceived control over life. The following four 
items were used to measure control over life. 
 
1) I have a lot of influence over most things that 
happen in my life. 2) I can do just about anything 
I really set my mind to. 3) When I make plans, 
I’m almost certain to make them work. 4) When 
I encounter problems, I don’t give up until I solve 
them. Responses ranged from 4 (Strongly Agree) 
 
to 1 (Strongly Disagree). A higher score reflected 
higher control over life. (Cronbach’s α = 0.743) [15].
Self-rated health (poor). Individuals were asked 
three questions. 1) How would you rate your over-
all health at the present time? Would you say your 
health is excellent, good, fair, or poor? 2) Would 
you say your health is better, about the same, or 
worse than most people your age? 3) Do you think

your health is better, about the same, or worse 
than it was a year ago? Responses to the first item 
included: 1) Excellent, 2) Good, 3) Fair, 4) Poor. Re-
sponses to the second and third items included 
1) Better, 2) About the same, and 3) Worse (Cron-
bach’s α = 0.678). 
Mortality. Information on occurrence of death 
from 2001 to 2004 was obtained through the in-
formants, death certificates, and national death 
index. Mortality during the follow-up was treated 
as a dichotomous variable, independent of time 
and cause of death. Overall, 208 deceased Black 
or White participants were detected. From this 
number, 112 were Black and 96 were White.
Statistical analysis
We used SPSS 20.0 for data analysis. We fit-
ted logistic regressions in the pooled sample, and 
specific to race, with sense of control as the inde-
pendent variable, mortality as the outcome, and 
demographics, socio-economics, health behaviors, 
and self-rated health as covariates, and race as 
the focal moderator. Odds ratios with 95% confi-
dence intervals (CI) were reported. 
Results
The study followed 1,493 Black (n = 734) and 
White (n = 759) older adults (age 65 or more) for 
3 years. Overall, 208 deceased participants were 
detected. From this number, 112 (54%) individuals 
were Blacks and 96 (56%) individuals were Whites. 
Table I presents descriptive statistics overall 
and also based on race. While age was not sig-
nificantly different between Blacks and Whites, 
Blacks were more often female, had lower educa-
tion, were less frequently married, more frequent-

ly smoked, less frequently drank, and reported 
worse self-rated health. Sense of control over life 
was also lower among Blacks compared to Whites. 
Table II shows the results of six logistic regres-
sions in the pooled sample. While sense of control 
over life was a predictor of mortality (Model 2), we 
also found significant interaction effects between 
race and sense of control over life on mortality, 
suggesting larger effect for Whites compared to 
Blacks (Model 3). This interaction remained sig-
nificant in models that controlled for covariates 
(Models 4 to 6).
Table III presents race-specific models to esti-
mate the associations between sense of control 
over life and subsequent risk of mortality among 
Blacks and Whites. Model 1 only included age and 
gender, Model 2 added control beliefs, Model 3 
added SES factors, Model 4 also added health be-
haviors (smoking and drinking), and Model 5 also 
controlled for health status. These models suggest 
that sense of control over life at baseline was pre-
dictive of mortality among Whites but not Blacks. 
The significant association between control over 
life and risk of mortality among Whites did not 
change across models, suggesting that the asso-
ciation was not due to SES, behaviors, or health. 
Among Blacks, in all five models, control over life 
failed to predict risk of mortality. 
Discussion
Based on our findings, race alters how sense 
of control over life translates into survival benefit, 
with a weaker protective effect of sense of control 
over life on short-term mortality risk for Blacks 
compared to Whites. In race-specific models, 
self-efficacy was only protective against mortality 
among Whites but not Blacks.
Our finding is in line with a recent study by As-
sari showing a stronger protective role of self-effi-
cacy on risk of mortality over 25 years for Whites 
compared to Blacks. In race-specific models, 
self-efficacy at baseline was predictive of mor-
tality among Whites but not Blacks. The author 
concluded that in the United States, race modi-
fies long-term health gains associated with high 
self-efficacy [13]. The current study suggests that, 
similar to self-efficacy, sense of control over life 
better predicts risk of mortality for Whites com-
pared to Blacks. Our study also suggests that 
Black-White differences in gain associated with 
such control beliefs and psychological and cogni-
tive styles are not seen in either long-term [13] or 
short-term outcomes. 
The protective role of having a sense of con-
trol over life against risk of mortality has already 
been shown [6, 7]. Such an effect may be due to 
protective effects of control beliefs on developing 
psychological distress, as well as metabolic [16]

and cardiovascular [17] disease. Such beliefs also 
reflect lower symptoms [18], better wellbeing [18], 
and higher physical functioning [18, 19]. Low con-
trol beliefs reflect feeling of powerless and low ef-
ficacy in dealing with stress [20] as well as high 
levels of exposure to stress [21]. Among individu-
als of low socioeconomic status, those with higher 
control beliefs have better self-rated health, few-
er acute health symptoms, and better physical 
functioning compared to those with lower levels 
of control beliefs [22]. The protective effect of 
self-efficacy is shown to hold above and beyond 
confounders such as SES and health [23, 24].
Several mechanisms have been proposed to 
explain the protective effects of control beliefs on 
health. Health behaviors and mental health are 
major mediators of the effects of control beliefs 
on health [4, 7]. Control beliefs may mitigate the 
negative health effects of stress or structural and 
material limitations that often accompany low so-
cioeconomic status [22]. According to the Lazarus 
and Folkman theory of stress and coping, at least 
some of the negative health effects of stress are 
because of reduced individuals’ perception of con-
trol over life [25]. While some of the deleterious 
effects of stress on health are direct, some of the 
negative effects may be due deterioration of pos-
itive appraisals such as mastery, self-efficacy, and 
sense of control over life [25].
Our findings on racial differences in protective 
effects of sense of control may be due to differ-
ent meanings of control beliefs across population 
groups. Control beliefs may reflect different as-
pects of life of Blacks and Whites [13, 26, 27]. The 
differential roles of other psychosocial and sub-
jective measures such as depressive symptoms 
and self-rated health for Blacks and Whites are 
already known [28–33]. Thus group differences in 
the predictive role of psychosocial outcomes are 
rules rather than exceptions and are found regard-
less of population, setting, type of predictor, and 
outcome [29–33]. 
The low sense of control over life among 
Whites and Blacks may reflect different aspects 
of life. Given the social and economic conditions 
that Blacks face on a daily basis, low control be-
liefs may reflect a healthy sensitivity to the real 
world (realistic system-blame). For Blacks, low 
sense of control over time may be an attribute 
of their racial group, rather than their individual 
characteristic. Among Blacks, low sense of control 
may be secondary to realization of the existing 
social and economic inequalities in the U.S. Thus, 
such control beliefs may not similarly reflect pas-
sive beliefs, external locus of control or fatalism 
among Blacks and Whites [34].
According to our findings, high sense of con-
trol does not result in similar survival gains for 
Black and White older adults. Under certain envi-
ronmental circumstances, high level of control be-
liefs has predicted poor health outcomes [35, 36]. 
Thus, control beliefs may even harm the individu-
al, particularly when high expectations for control 
coexist with constrained opportunities [36, 37]. In 
uncontrollable or difficult to control situations, en-
dorsement of high control beliefs can lead to high 
cardiovascular reactivity [38, 39], which is associ-
ated with higher risk of metabolic and cardiovas-
cular conditions, via neuroendocrine and immune 
mechanisms [38–40]. While societal structural 
conditions prevent Blacks who endorse high con-
trol beliefs from actualization of their control be-
liefs, Blacks with high control beliefs may be at 
higher risk of cardiovascular disease due to expe-
riencing high levels of physiological reactivity [35]. 
For Blacks a combination of constrained opportu-
nities and high control beliefs may do more harm 
than good. This phenomenon may also be relat-
ed to the role of John Henryism for Blacks, which 
results in effortful coping, and is a risk factor for 
several adverse health outcomes [41].
Our study has a number of limitations. It is un-
clear how such control beliefs reflect coping styles, 
coping resources and life environment across di-
verse populations. Validity of control over life may 
differ based on race and ethnicity. In addition, the 
study did not control for baseline medical condi-
tions and stressful life events, or access to and use 
of health care. Finally, due to the limited sample 
size and short follow-up period, the number of 
deaths was low. However, a major strength of this 
study was the use of a nationally representative 
sample. 
In conclusion, Black and White older adults dif-
fer in benefits of high levels of control beliefs in 
preventing short-term all-cause mortality. Control 
beliefs may reflect different aspects of life across 
minority and oppressed populations. For Ameri-
can Blacks, a high level of self-efficacy may reflect 
a low level of awareness of blocked opportunities 
and racism, which may not be a healthy realization. 
Such psychosocial constructs may have race-spe-
cific – rather than universal – health effects.
