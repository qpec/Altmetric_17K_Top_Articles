R
ed blood cell (RBC) transfusion is the most common
medical procedure in contemporary medicine.1 In the
United States, 7.6% of all hospitalized patients will re-
ceive at least 1 blood transfusion during their hospitalization,
anditsusehasincreasedbetween1997and2011by134%.1With
the main objective to improve oxygen delivery to tissues,2 RBC
transfusion is used in a variety of medical situations, ranging
from correction of chronic low-grade anemia to resuscitation
of the massively bleeding patient.2-5 When a decision to trans-
fuse has been made, usual practice is to order 1 or more com-
patible RBC units from the blood bank. Limited characteristics
of the RBC unit can be requested, such as cytomegalovirus
(CMV)status,leukoreduction,orirradiation;however,evidence
ofclinicalbenefitwiththesespecificcharacteristicsislimited.6
Thereisgrowingpreclinicalandclinicalevidencethatblood
donor characteristics may affect recipient outcomes. Erythro-
poiesis is altered by aging,7 as are other characteristics related
to blood, including immune tolerance, inflammation, oncoge-
nicity,andprematurecellularturnover.8,9Humanswholivelon-
ger may also have different genetic factors affecting RBC
characteristics.10 Immunological phenomena related to do-
nors, such as the antileukocyte antibodies (anti-HLA or anti-
neutrophil antibodies) that occur after pregnancies (eg, sex ef-
fectontransfusion-relatedacutelunginjury[TRALI]),havebeen
shown to affect clinical outcomes.11,12
Transfusion of a blood component is analogous to solid
organ transplantation because it involves the retrieval of an
organ (blood) from a donor, postdonation processing and
IMPORTANCE While red blood cells (RBCs) are administered to improve oxygen delivery and
patient outcomes, they also have been associated with potential harm. Unlike solid organ
transplantation, the clinical consequences of donor characteristics on recipients have not
been evaluated in transfusion medicine.
OBJECTIVE To analyze the association of RBC donor age and sex with the survival of
transfusion recipients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We established a longitudinal cohort by linking data
from a blood collection agency with clinical and administrative data at 4 academic hospitals.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to
evaluate the risk of donor age and sex on transfusion recipient survival.
RESULTS Between October 25, 2006, and December 31, 2013, a total of 30 503 RBC
transfusion recipients received 187 960 RBC transfusions from 80 755 unique blood donors.
For recipients receiving an RBC unit from younger donors, the risk of death was increased
compared with recipients receiving an RBC unit from a donor 40 to 49.9 years old (adjusted
hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.10; P < .001 for donor age range 17-19.9 years and 1.06; 95%
CI, 1.04-1.09; P < .001 for donor age range 20-29.9 years). Receiving an RBC transfusion from
a female donor was associated with an 8% statistically significant increased risk of death
compared with receiving an RBC transfusion from a male donor (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.08;
95% CI, 1.06-1.09; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Red blood cell transfusions from younger donors and from
female donors were statistically significantly associated with increased mortality. These
findings suggest that donor characteristics may affect RBC transfusion outcomes.

storage, and “transplantation” (transfusion) into a recipient.13
In the transplant literature, specific donor characteristics have
been associated with adverse outcomes in recipients. For ex-
ample, in heart, lung, liver, kidney, and stem cell transplan-
tation, donor age has repeatedly been shown to be associated
with transplantation outcome.14-22 Female donor sex has also
been suggested to be associated with poorer outcomes in stem
cell transplantation,21 as well as a cohort study23 assessing out-
comes after RBC transfusions in male recipients. Such charac-
teristics have not been extensively evaluated for RBC
transfusion.24 Understanding that current evidence (although
limited) suggests that blood donor characteristics may influ-
ence transfusion recipient outcomes, the 2015 National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute State of the Science in Transfusion
Medicinemeetingidentifieddonorfactors,suchasageandsex,
as “compelling questions necessitating additional basic, trans-
lational or clinical research.”25 Based on the emerging evi-
dence and a lack of robust studies assessing potential clinical
effects of donor characteristics, we analyzed the effect of do-
nor age and sex on the survival of RBC transfusion recipients.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
We conducted a longitudinal cohort study at 4 academic hos-
pitals to investigate the association of donor age and sex with
recipient survival after RBC transfusion. A detailed version of
the study design and methods has been published.13 Briefly,
we obtained blood donor data prospectively collected at the
time of blood donation from Canadian Blood Services (Ed-
monton, Alberta), the operator of the blood system in Canada
in all provinces and territories except for Quebec; short-term
descriptive and outcome data from hospital-based clinical and
administrative databases; and long-term outcome data from
population-based administrative data housed at the Institute
forClinicalEvaluativeSciences(Toronto,Ontario,Canada).The
4 participating sites included the General, Riverside, and Civic
campuses of The Ottawa Hospital and the University of Ot-
tawaHeartInstitute(allinOttawa,Ontario,Canada).Thisstudy
was approved by The Ottawa Hospital Research Ethics Board
(protocol 20140111-01H) and Canadian Blood Services Re-
searchEthicsBoard(protocol2014.004).Informedconsentwas
not required by the research ethics boards.
Recipient Population
We included all recipients regardless of age who received at
least 1 RBC transfusion between October 25, 2006, and De-
cember 31, 2013, and had a mandatory valid health insurance
number from the Canadian province of Ontario. The October
25, 2006, date was chosen because it represents the date when
dataonallbloodproductstransfusedwereelectronicallystored
at the included institutions. The recipients had to have a valid
healthinsurancenumberforoutcomedatatobeobtainedfrom
the provincial databases. We excluded recipients who re-
ceived RBC units that could not be linked to Canadian Blood
Services because they were produced by a different blood col-
lection agency.
Donor Population
Donor information was obtained from Canadian Blood Ser-
vices databases. Data collected included donor demograph-
ics (eg, age and sex), as well as blood product characteristics
(blood group, CMV status, irradiation status, and additive
solution) for each unit of blood collected.
Data Collection
We predefined exposures, covariates, and outcomes of inter-
est in the published protocol.13 We deterministically linked do-
nor and blood product information for each RBC unit trans-
fused at each study center. We then linked to hospital-based
administrative data sets to determine recipient characteris-
tics, including age, sex, transfusion history, and medical co-
morbidities. The resulting data set was then linked determin-
istically to the Ontario Registered Persons Database, which
contains vital status information on all Ontario residents, to
determine if and when recipients died. Therefore, the result-
ing data sets allowed the evaluation of the complete donor-
to-recipient or vein-to-vein continuum.
Study Exposures
Our primary exposure of interest was donor age, and the
secondary exposure was donor sex. This information was
collected at the time of donation for each RBC unit trans-
fused.Wealsocollectedthedateofdonation,donorABOblood
group, number of previous whole blood donations, and manu-
facturing methods (additive solution, filtration methods, CMV
status, and irradiation status). All transfused RBC units were
leukoreduced, and all donors were at least 17 years old as per
Canadian Blood Services blood donation policies. Recipients
could receive more than 1 RBC transfusion from more than 1
donor. For recipients, we collected the date and time of each
RBC transfusion, whether they received any other blood prod-
ucts, hospital administrative information (admission and dis-
charge dates and discharge disposition), age and sex, and ABO
blood group. For inpatient transfusions, we collected the in-
dividual elements of the validated Charlson Comorbidity
Index26-28 to obtain the main comorbidities of each trans-
fused recipient. This information was obtained from the Ca-
nadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Da-
tabase, which records detailed diagnostic and procedural
information for all hospital admissions in Ontario. For outpa-
tient transfusions, the elements of the Charlson Comorbidity
Index were not available.
Key Points
Question What is the effect of red blood cell (RBC) donor age and
sex on transfusion recipient survival?
Findings This longitudinal cohort study included 30 503
transfusion recipients who received 187 960 transfusions from
80 755 unique blood donors. Receipt of transfusions from female
donors or donors younger than 30 years was associated with a
statistically significant increased risk of death compared with
receiving transfusions from male donors.
Meaning Donor characteristics may be associated with RBC
transfusion outcomes and mortality.

Study Outcome
Our primary study outcome was recipient survival, measured
from the date of first RBC transfusion. Recipients who did not
have a death record at the time of study completion were as-
sumed to be alive and censored on December 31, 2013.
Statistical Analysis
The principal analysis was based on a Cox proportional haz-
ards regression model that accounted for a recipient’
s cumu-
lative RBC transfusion episodes over time.29,30 Our model had
to account for patients who received RBC transfusions from
differentdonorswithdifferentdonorcharacteristics(donorage
and sex) (eAppendix in the Supplement). We considered the
varying follow-up time of each recipient, with the start of fol-
low-up defined as the time of first transfusion and the end of
follow-up at either death or end of the study.
The exposure of interest was the cumulative number of
units received with a feature of interest (ie, donor sex and do-
nor age category), which was updated with each transfusion.
We assumed that the effect of a previous transfusion would
notstopatthemomentofanadditionalRBCtransfusion;there-
fore, the exposure of interest had to consider cumulative ex-
posure over time. We calculated the risk (hazard) of receiving
an RBC unit with a feature of interest compared with receiv-
ing an RBC unit from a fixed reference group (opposite sex and
donor age group of 40-49.9 years), while adjusting for all other
covariates, including the cumulative number of RBC units re-
ceived. Donor age was categorized into groups of 10 years. All
donors 70 years or older were considered in one group be-
cause of the limited number of donors older than 70 years. The
exposure to RBCs from donors with one of the features of in-
terest (donor age or donor sex) was allowed to be repeated over
time and treated as time varying.
Our model adjusted for the cumulative mix of RBC donor
exposures(ie,donorsexordonorage)andforthepotentialcon-
founders of recipient age, sex, and comorbid illnesses. Con-
founding variables except recipient sex were treated as time-
varying covariates. Comorbidity data were not collected for
outpatient transfusions, coded as a dummy missing variable
when occurring. Because outpatient comorbidity was miss-
ingnotatrandom,multipleimputationstrategiesweredeemed
inappropriate.31
Planned subgroup analyses were based on the follow-
ing: recipient sex, recipient age (<1, 1 to <18, 18 to <65, or
≥65 years), and comorbid illness (using the Charlson Comor-
bidity Index). To test the at-random distribution of the
exposures, we also compared characteristics of recipients
who received RBCs only from male or female donors or from
young or older donors. The effect of exposures was also
tested for proportionality over time. We tested visually any
evidence of departure from proportionality by plotting
Kaplan-Meier survival curves for patients who received only
one unit of blood of each characteristic. To test whether the
cumulative risk associated with one transfusion also
respected the proportionality assumption, we introduced a
time interaction term between the cumulative exposure
covariates and the time each patient was exposed to each
level of covariates in each model.
All tests of statistical inference reflect a 2-sided α = .05.
Analyses were performed using statistical software (SAS, ver-
sion 9.4; SAS Institute).
Results
Over the study period, 32 798 patients received at least 1 RBC
transfusion. A total of 2279 (6.9%) recipients were excluded
because they did not have a valid health insurance number,
and 16 (0.1%) recipients were excluded because they could not
be linked to the provincial databases. A further 133 RBC units
were excluded because they were obtained from a different
blood collection agency. Therefore, our cohort included 30 503
recipients, 80 755 unique blood donors, and 187 960 trans-
fused RBC units (Figure 1) The mean (SD) recipient follow-up
was 2.3 (2.1) years from the time of first transfusion, and maxi-
mum follow-up was 7.2 years. Death occurred in 13 118 (43.0%)
of our cohort of recipients.
Recipient and donor characteristics are summarized in
Table 1 and Table 2. There were no missing values for age
and sex for either donors or recipients. The median recipi-
ent age was 69.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 56.0-80.0
years), and 52.1% (n = 15 906) were female. The proportion
of recipients with a Charlson Comorbidity Index of at least 5
was 20.7% (n = 6314). The median number of RBC units
received was 3 (IQR, 2-6). The median donor age was 42.0
years (IQR, 27.0-52.0 years), and 48.7% (n = 39 328) were
female. Donors had given a median of 5 (IQR, 1-17) whole
blood donations.
Characteristics of the RBC units transfused are summa-
rizedineTable1intheSupplement.Atotalof32.1%(n = 60 334)
of the units were produced using the buffy coat method. The
most commonly used additive solutions were saline-adenine-
glucose-mannitol (73.6% [n = 138 328]) and AS-3 (25.7%
[n = 48 314]). The median storage age of the transfused RBC
units was 17 days (IQR, 13-23 days). A significant proportion
of recipients (40.5% [n = 12 343]) also received other blood
products (eTable 2 in the Supplement).

Primary Analysis
The risk of death was statistically significantly higher for
recipients who received RBC transfusions from younger
donors. For a recipient receiving an RBC unit from a donor
17 to 19.9 years old, the increased risk of death was 8% com-
pared with a recipient receiving an RBC unit from a donor
40 to 49.9 years old (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.08: 95%
CI, 1.06-1.10 for each additional unit transfused; P < .001).
For a recipient receiving a red blood cell unit from a donor
aged 20-29.9 years, the increased risk of death was 6%
compared with a recipient receiving an RBC unit from a
donor aged 40-49.9 years (adjusted HR, 1.06; 95% CI 1.04 to
1.09; P < .001) (Figure 2, Table 3, and eFigure 1 in the
Supplement).
Donor sex was associated with survival after RBC trans-
fusion (Figure 2, Table 3, and eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
The transfusion of each additional RBC unit from a female
donor was associated with an increased risk of death of 8%
compared with receipt from a male donor (adjusted HR,
1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.09 for each additional unit transfused;
P < .001).
Subgroup Analyses
Subgroupanalyses(eTable3intheSupplement)suggestedthat
young donor age was associated with reduced survival mainly
in male recipients, with the greatest risk in male recipients re-
ceiving blood from the youngest donor strata (adjusted HR,
1.14; 95% CI, 1.11-1.17 for each additional unit transfused;
P < .001). Female sex was associated with reduced survival in

both male recipients (adjusted HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.07-1.10 for
each additional unit transfused; P < .001) and female recipi-
ents (adjusted HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05 for each additional
unit transfused; P < .001).
Few deaths occurred in the youngest recipient age groups
(64deathsamongthose<1yearand19deathsamongthose1-18
years). Each additional RBC transfusion from any donor age
or sex increased the risk of death except for the older donors
(≥60 years) and male donors for recipients between 1 and 18
years old. Subgroup analyses of recipients between 18 and 64
years old or 65 years or older produced results similar to those
of our main analysis, and female donor sex and younger do-
nor age were associated with poorer survival.
An association between young donor age and survival was
observed among recipients with a Charlson Comorbidity In-
dex less than 3. For donor sex, the observed decreased sur-
vival associated with RBC units from female donors was con-
sistent across Charlson Comorbidity Index subgroups.
Discussion
In our large cohort study, we found a statistically significant
increase in the risk of death for recipients of RBC transfu-
sionsfromyoungdonorsandfemaledonors.Thefindingswere
observed across recipient subgroups of age, sex, and comor-
bidities. Because more than 100 million RBC units are col-
lectedandtransfusedworldwideeveryyear,32anincreasedrisk
of death of 8% for each additional transfusion could have a sig-
nificant mortality effect in absolute terms. For example, the
observed 1-year mortality rate of 36.4% in recipients of 6 fe-
male donor units transfused (study mean) would decrease to
27.1%(absoluteriskreduction,9.3%;95%CI,8.3%-10.4%)com-
pared with recipients of male-only transfusions. This obser-
vation translates to a number needed to treat of 11.
Thefactthatyoungdonoragewasassociatedwithsurvival
wasunexpected.Theresultsofanimalinvestigationshavesug-
gested improved cognitive function and synaptic plasticity in
mice that were transfused with young blood.33 In a different
study in mice, Loffredo et al34 showed that shared blood circu-
lation (parabiosis, not transfusion) between young and old
mice may reverse age-related cardiac hypertrophy. However,
we are unaware of any human studies that support such an
association.24 Five studies35-39 involving a total of 586 recipi-
ents have assessed the association between RBC donor age and
clinicaloutcomes.Nonedirectlyassessedtheriskofdeath.Four
studies35,36,38,39 reported no association with the outcomes of
TRALI or risk of human immunodeficiency virus and human
T-lymphotropic virus transmission. One study37 evaluated the
riskofdeath,butinpatientsreceivingplasma.Arecentmatched
cohort study40 from the Scandinavian Donations and Transfu-
sions 2 (SCANDAT2) database reported no association between
donor age and survival after RBC transfusion. However, the
transfusionexposurewasrestrictedto7daysafterthefirsttrans-
fusion, and the authors excluded patients who received units
fromdonorsinmorethan1agecategory.Therefore,themedian
number of transfusions was low (1 transfusion), and it is likely
that the transfusion recipients received transfusions after the
7-day exposure windows, thus diluting the observed effect. In
our study, we did not restrict the exposure period to RBC trans-
fusions, we accounted for patients who received transfusions
from donors of different age groups, we have a longer follow-
up time, and patients received a larger RBC dose.
One potential explanation for our findings may be related
to the healthy donor phenomenon.41 This phenomenon is re-
lated to the fact that one must be in a good state of health to
proceed with blood donation. Potential blood donors un-
dergo a screening questionnaire that can lead to donation de-
ferraliftheprovidedresponsesaredeemedinappropriate.Also,
patients who are unhealthy are less likely to give blood, thus

excluding the sickest patients from donating blood. It has also
been shown that long-term blood donors are healthier than
short-career donors.41 Therefore, it is possible that our obser-
vation is related to a healthy donor effect, such that young do-
nors may not be aware of an ongoing medical condition that
may affect recipients, whereas the development of medical ill-
nesses with age may lead donors to be excluded or to exclude
themselves, leaving a more healthy older donor pool.
We found that the transfusion of a cumulative number of
female donor units was also associated with worse survival.
In normal physiological conditions, male and female RBCs are
comparable regarding their oxygen delivery capacity, deform-
ability, and composition.42,43 However, sex differences exist
when erythrocytes are exposed to adrenaline. It has been
shown that the enzymatic activity (acetylcholinesterase) de-
creases, and there is increased RBC membrane rigidity and de-
creased affinity to oxygen in women but not men exposed to
adrenaline.42 These perturbations at the cellular level may ex-
plain the different tissue responses to stress between the
sexes.42 Blood composition is also affected by sex. Female do-
nor plasma has been associated with TRALI. In a recent sys-
tematic review,24 low-risk TRALI donor strategies, which in-
cluded male plasma donors only, were associated with a
reduced odds of TRALI (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.29-0.90).
Female sex, history of pregnancy, and presence of human leu-
cocyteantibodiesinthedonorhavebeenassociatedwithTRALI
outcomes. These mechanisms may contribute to the in-
creased risk of death in recipients of female blood but are un-
likely to be the only factors because RBC products contain only
a minimal amount of plasma. However, this residual amount
of plasma may contain other circulating factors that could po-
tentially affect recipient outcomes.
Effectonsurvivalwasobservedearlyduringfollow-upand
was maintained over time. Although we do not have a defini-
tive explanation, transfusion of RBC units is associated with
numerous immunomodulatory effects.3,44,45 Those effects
could differ depending on the donor characteristics. Immu-
nomodulatory effects may be associated with an increased risk
of infections and cancer recurrence over time, hence the lag
in mortality. Because of the observational nature of our study,
our findings are not evidence that young donor age is causal
inthesurvivalpathwayoftransfusionrecipients.However,our
results suggest that currently unknown biological or environ-
mental factors affecting young donors may influence the RBC
products transfused. The resulting association with mortal-
ity may not be due to young age but rather due to factors as-
sociated with young age. Once identified, removing donors
with these adverse biological or environmental factors could
mitigate the association with survival. Current blood screen-
ing and distribution procedures do not include consider-
ations of potential associations between donor characteris-
tics, such as age and sex, on posttransfusion survival. Our
observation that blood from young donors, on average, may
in fact be associated with increased mortality in transfusion
recipientsdoesnotsupporttheuseofyoungbloodforitsthera-
peutic effects and warrants further epidemiological study to
elucidate potential mechanisms.
Our study has some limitations. First, its observational
design is subject to unmeasured confounding factors. How-
ever, because of the current practices in blood collection,
distribution, and transfusion, we believe that unmeasured
confounders will tend to be evenly distributed between
groups. Indeed, the current model for allogeneic blood dona-
tion ensures that all donor characteristics are always strictly
concealed from prescribing physicians and that blood is dis-
tributedinarandommanneracrossandwithinhospitals.There-
fore, our exposures of interest are randomly distributed among
recipients.Becauseofthemaskingofdonorcharacteristics,our
study has similarities with features associated with random-
ized clinical trials, such as allocation concealment and
double-blinding.46,47 Furthermore, our statistical adjust-
ments for recipient characteristics and comorbidities did not
alteroureffectestimates(althoughtheselectedcovariateswere
strongly associated with outcome), suggesting a random dis-
tribution of donor characteristics (eTable 4 in the Supple-
ment). Another limitation of the study is that it was impossible
for us to further detail donor factors that may explain our find-
ings. Our initial hypothesis focused on donor age and sex, and
we did not design our study to examine other donor character-
istics that may provide further insight into our findings. How-
ever, our framework will enable such exploratory analyses in
thefuture.Meanwhile,evenwithoutdefinitivemechanisticex-
planation, we believe that the strength of our findings, repro-
ducibilityacrosssubgroups,andsensitivityanalysessuggestthat
the observed associations are likely not due to chance alone or
only to unmeasured confounders and further emphasize the
need for more investigation.
Conclusions
Cumulative RBC transfusions from young donors and from fe-
male donors were statistically significantly associated with an
increasedriskofdeathinalargecohortoftransfusedrecipients.
