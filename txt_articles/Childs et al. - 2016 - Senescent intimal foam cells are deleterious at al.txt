 (24) and by doing so would position the Xist-
coated DNA away from the actively transcribed
Xist transcription locus. This would enable other
DNA regions on the X chromosome, which are
physically linked to these tethered regions, to
be brought into closer spatial proximity of the
Xist transcription locus. In this way, Xist and its
silencing factors can spread to these newly
accessible DNA regions on the X chromosome.

VASCULAR DISEASE
Senescent intimal foam cells
are deleterious at all stages
of atherosclerosis
Bennett G. Childs,1 Darren J. Baker,2 Tobias Wijshake,2,3 Cheryl A. Conover,4

Advanced atherosclerotic lesions contain senescent cells, but the role of these cells
in atherogenesis remains unclear. Using transgenic and pharmacological approaches
to eliminate senescent cells in atherosclerosis-prone low-density lipoprotein
receptor–deficient (Ldlr–/–) mice, we show that these cells are detrimental throughout
disease pathogenesis. We find that foamy macrophages with senescence markers
accumulate in the subendothelial space at the onset of atherosclerosis, where they drive
pathology by increasing expression of key atherogenic and inflammatory cytokines
and chemokines. In advanced lesions, senescent cells promote features of plaque
instability, including elastic fiber degradation and fibrous cap thinning, by heightening
metalloprotease production. Together, these results demonstrate that senescent cells are
key drivers of atheroma formation and maturation and suggest that selective clearance
of these cells by senolytic agents holds promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
A
therosclerosis initiates when oxidized lipo-
protein infiltrates the subendothelial space
of arteries, often due to aberrantly elevated
levels of apolipoprotein B–containing lipo-
proteins in the blood (1). Chemotactic signals
arising from activated endothelium and vascu-
lar smooth muscle attract circulating monocytes
that develop into lipid-loaded foamy macrophages,
a subset of which adopt a proinflammatory pheno-
type through a mechanism that is not fully un-
derstood. The proinflammatory signals lead to
additional rounds of monocyte recruitment and
accumulation of other inflammatory cells (in-
cluding T and B cells, dendritic cells, and mast
cells), allowing initial lesions, often termed “fatty
streaks,” to increase in size and develop into
plaques (2). Plaque stability, rather than abso-
lute size, determines whether atherosclerosis
is clinically silent or pathogenic because un-
stable plaques can rupture and produce vessel-
occluding thrombosis and end-organ damage.
Stable plaques have a relatively thick fibrous
cap, which largely consists of vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMCs) and extracellular matrix
components, partitioning soluble clotting fac-
tors in the blood from thrombogenic molecules
in the plaque (3). In advanced disease, plaques
destabilize when elevated local matrix metallo-
protease production degrades the fibrous cap,
increasing the risk of lesion rupture and subse-
quent thrombosis.
Advanced plaques contain cells with markers
of senescence, a stress response that entails a per-
manent growth arrest coupled to the robust se-
cretion of numerous biologically active molecules
and is referred to as the senescence-associated
secretory phenotype (SASP). The senescence
markers include elevated senescence-associated
b-galactosidase (SA b-Gal) activity and p16Ink4a,
p53, and p21 expression (4, 5). However, whether
and how senescent cells contribute to athero-
genesis remains unclear (6, 7). Human plaques
contain cells with shortened telomeres, which
predispose cells to undergo senescence (8). Con-
sistent with a proatherogenic role of senescence
is the observation that expression of a loss-of-
function telomere-binding protein (Trf2) in VSMCs
accelerates plaque growth in the ApoE–/– mouse
model of atherosclerosis, although in vivo evi-
dence for increased senescence in plaques was
not provided. On the other hand, mice lacking
core components of senescence pathways, such
as p53, p21, or p19Arf (7, 9–11), show accelerated
atherosclerosis, implying a protective role for se-
nescence. Studies showing that human and mouse
polymorphisms that reduce expression of p16Ink4a
and p14Arf (p19Arf in mice) correlate with in-
creased atheroma risk support this conclusion
(7, 12, 13). Thus, whether senescent cells accel-
erate or retard atherogenesis is unclear.
We used genetic and pharmacological meth-
ods of eliminating senescent cells to examine the
role of naturally occurring senescent cells at dif-
ferent stages of atherogenesis. First, we verified
that senescent cells accumulate in low-density
lipoprotein receptor–deficient (Ldlr–/–) mice,
a model of atherogenesis. We fed 10-week-old
Ldlr–/– mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 88 days.
We then performed SA b-Gal staining, which

 revealed that senescent cells are present in
atherosclerotic lesions but not in the normal
adjacent vasculature or aortas of Ldlr–/– mice
fed a low-fat diet (LFD) (fig. S1A). In addition,
plaque-rich aortic arches had elevated transcript
levels of p16Ink4a, p19Arf, and various canonical
SASP components, including the matrix metallo-
proteases Mmp3 and Mmp13 and the inflam-
matory cytokines Il1a and Tnfa (fig. S1B). To
eliminate senescent cells from plaques, we used
p16-3MR (3MR) mice (14), a transgenic model
that expresses the herpes simplex virus thymidine
kinase under the control of the p16Ink4a gene
promoter and kills p16Ink4a+ senescent cells upon
administration of ganciclovir (GCV). Plaques of
Ldlr–/–;3MR mice fed a HFD for 88 days and
then treated short term with GCV had low levels
of SA b-Gal activity compared with Ldlr–/– mice
(fig. S1C), indicating efficient clearance of senes-
cent cells. Examination of the plaques by trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed
that three morphologically distinct cell types—
elongated, vacuolated cells located in the endo-
thelial layer; spindly foam cells with histological
properties of VSMCs; and large foamy cells re-
sembling lipid-loaded macrophages—produced
X-galactosidase (X-Gal) crystals (Fig. 1A). We refer
to these cells as endothelial-like, foamy VSMC–
like, and foamy macrophage–like cells, respec-
tively, because cells within plaques change shape
and lineage markers, precluding accurate assess-
ment of cell origin (15, 16). All three senescent cell
types were efficiently eliminated by treatment
with GCV (Fig. 1A).
To assess the impact senescent cells have
on plaque development, we placed 10-week-old
Ldlr–/–;3MR mice on a HFD for 88 days and
simultaneously treated them with GCV or ve-
hicle during this period (Fig. 1B) to intermittent-
ly remove p16Ink4a+ cells. To control for potential
effects of GCV, independent of 3MR expression,
we also examined GCV-treated Ldlr–/– mice on
a HFD. En face staining of descending aortas
with Sudan IV revealed that plaque burden
was ~60% lower in GCV-treated Ldlr–/–;3MR
mice than in vehicle-treated Ldlr–/–;3MR or GCV-
treated Ldlr–/– mice, owing to decreases in both
plaque number and size (Fig. 1C). Similarly, GCV-
treated Ldlr–/–;3MR mice showed reduced plaque
burden and destruction of aortic elastic fibers
beneath the neointima in the brachiocephalic
artery (fig. S2, A to C), a site that rapidly de-
velops advanced atherosclerotic plaques (17).

 GCV-treated Ldlr–/–;3MR mice expressed lower
amounts of p16Ink4a mRNA and other senescence-
marker mRNAs in aortic arches, confirming that
p16Ink4a+ senescent cells were efficiently cleared
by GCV (fig. S3A). Expression of 3MR, as measured
by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis of monomeric
red fluorescent protein transcripts, increased in
HFD-fed mice but remained at baseline levels
with GCV treatment. Complementary en face
SA b-Gal staining of aortas confirmed that
p16Ink4a+ senescent cells were effectively cleared
(fig. S3B). GCV-treatment of Ldlr–/– mice did
not alter SA b-Gal staining or other senescence
markers (fig. S3, B and C). GCV-treated Ldlr–/–
and Ldlr–/–;3MR mice did not differ in body
weight, fat mass, and fat deposit weight (fig. S4,
A to D). Circulating monocytes, lymphocytes,
platelets, and neutrophils, all of which are involved
in atherogenesis, were unaffected (fig. S4, E to H).
Levels of atherogenic lipids in the blood of GCV-
treated Ldlr–/– and Ldlr–/–;3MR mice and vehicle-
treated Ldlr–/–;3MR mice were highly elevated
compared with levels in LFD-fed controls, with
no differences between the distinct HFD-fed
cohorts (fig. S4I). Thus, the atheroprotective ef-
fect in GCV-treated Ldlr–/–;3MR mice is due to
the killing of p16Ink4a+ senescent cells rather
than changes in feeding habits, blood lipids, or
circulating immunocytes. Reductions in plaque
burden, number, and size observed with p16-3MR
were reproducible with two independent trans-
genic systems [INK-ATTAC (fig. S5) (18, 19) and
INK-Nitroreductase (NTR) (fig. S6)] designed
to kill p16Ink4a+ senescent cells through distinct
mechanisms, as well as with the senolytic drug
ABT263, which inhibits the anti-apoptotic pro-
teins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and selectively kills senes-
cent cells (fig. S7) (20).
To investigate how senescent cells drive plaque
initiation and growth, we focused on atherogen-
esis onset at lesion-prone sites of the vascula-
ture (21). After just 9 days on an atherogenic diet,
Ldlr–/– mice had overtly detectable fatty-streak
lesions solely in the inner curvature of the aortic
arch (Fig. 2A and fig. S8A). Surprisingly, these
early lesions were highly positive for SA b-Gal
activity (Fig. 2A). By contrast, Ldlr–/– mice con-
taining 3MR and treated daily with GCV during
the 9-day HFD-feeding period had low levels of
SA b-Gal activity and much smaller fatty streaks
(Fig. 2A). Histological examination by TEM of
the SA b-Gal–stained samples revealed that fatty
streaks of HFD-fed Ldlr−/− mice consisted of foci
of foam cell macrophages arranged in mono- or
multilayers (Fig. 2, B and C). The lesions had
intact elastic fibers and no fibrous cap. X-Gal
crystals were detectable exclusively in foam cell
macrophages, irrespective of lesion size (Fig. 2,
B and D). Foam cell macrophages in foci of 9-day
lesions of Ldlr–/–;3MR mice receiving daily, high-
dose GCV were rarely arranged in multilayers and
had a much lower incidence of crystals (Fig. 2, C

 and D). Elevated SA b-Gal activity in fatty streaks
correlated with increased levels of p16Ink4a and
various other senescence markers, including
Mmp3, Mmp13, Il1a, and Tnfa (fig. S8B). Nine-
day treatment of HFD-fed Ldlr–/– mice with
ABT263 confirmed that senolysis reduces ath-
erogenesis onset (fig. S8C).
To determine how senescent foamy macro-
phages contribute to early atherogenesis, we
established 9-day fatty streaks in Ldlr–/– and
Ldlr–/–;3MR mice and then administered high-
dose GCV for 3 days while continuing to feed the
mice a HFD. Short-term clearance of senescent
cells markedly reduced streak size and SA b-Gal
positivity (Fig. 2E). TEM images showed that
cleared foci were drastically remodeled, with
acellular debris retained in the subendothelium
and few foamy macrophages containing X-Gal
crystals (fig. S8, D and E). RT-qPCR revealed a
stark reduction in p16Ink4a and SASP components
(including Mmp3, Mmp13, Il1a, and Tnfa), as
well as two key molecular drivers of monocyte
recruitment (the chemokine Mcp1 and the leuko-
cyte receptor Vcam1), whose expression is partly
driven by Tnfa (Fig. 2F). These data suggest
that subendothelial senescent foamy macro-
phages arising in early lesions enhance Tnfa-
mediated Vcam1 expression, as well as the Mcp1
gradient, to perpetuate monocyte recruitment
from the blood.
Next, we examined the role of senescent cells
in the maturation of benign plaques to complex
advanced lesions. Although mouse models for
atherosclerosis do not develop clinical symp-
toms associated with plaque ruptures, plaque
maturation in these mice can be studied using
surrogate markers of plaque instability, includ-
ing fibrous cap thinning (22, 23), decreased col-
lagen deposition, elastic fiber degradation, and
plaque calcification (24). To assess the effect of
senescent cell clearance on the maturation of
existing plaques, we employed late-disease senes-
cent cell clearance protocols in which we placed
Ldlr/– and Ldlr –/–;3MR mice on a HFD for 88 days
to create plaques, followed by 100 days of GCV
treatment. During GCV treatment, mice were
fed a HFD or LFD to promote continued plaque
advancement or stasis, respectively (Fig. 3A and
fig. S9). Ldlr–/–;3MR mice maintained on the
HFD and receiving GCV showed attenuated dis-
ease progression, as evidenced by a lower plaque
number and size compared with GCV-treated
Ldlr–/– or vehicle-treated Ldlr–/–;3MR controls (Fig.
3A). Whereas plaques of GCV-treated Ldlr–/–;3MR
mice on a LFD had markedly reduced Sudan IV
staining compared with plaques of control mice,
the lesion-covered aortic area did not change
(fig. S10A), even though 3MR-mediated senescent
cell killing was confirmed by SA b-Gal staining
(fig. S10B) and RT-qPCR for senescence markers
(Fig. 3B). Regardless of diet, senescent cell clear-
ance reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines
(Fig. 3B) and monocyte recruitment factors (fig.
S10C). GCV treatment decreased expression
of matrix metalloproteases linked to plaque de-
stabilization, including Mmp3, Mmp12, and Mmp13
(25, 26) (Fig. 3B), which suggests that senescent
cell elimination stabilizes the fibrous cap.
To investigate this and other features of plaque
maturation, we conducted histopathology on
plaques collected from the above cohorts. When
Ldlr–/– mice originally fed a HFD for 88 days
were left on the diet for an additional 100 days,
their descending aorta plaques showed reduced
cap thickness, diminished collagen content (by
Masson’s trichrome staining), and more disrupt-
ed aortic elastic fibers (by Voerhoff von Gieson
staining) in comparison with those of LFD-fed
mice (Fig. 4, A and B, and fig. S11). In contrast,
all of these markers of plaque instability were
decreased with clearance of p16Ink4a+ cells, re-
gardless of diet, during the 100-day GCV treat-
ment period. Similarly, clearance of p16Ink4a+ cells
increased cap thickness and collagen content
in brachiocephalic arteries from mice reverted
to LFD (fig. S12). We extended these studies by
switching Ldlr–/–;3MR and Ldlr–/– mice after
88 days of HFD feeding to a LFD with GCV injec-
tions for 35 days (fig. S13A). In this experiment,
senescent cell elimination preserved fibrous cap

sional foamy macrophage–like cell content was
reduced, whereas VSMC-like cell content increased
(fig. S13, D and E), resulting in plaques with a
higher VSMC-like/macrophage-like cell ratio, a
marker for greater stability (fig. S13F) (27). Clear-
ance markedly reduced monocyte attachment
to plaque-adjacent endothelium (fig. S13G), thus
supporting our conclusion from early fatty-streak
experiments that enhanced monocyte chemo-
taxis may partially explain the proatherogenic
nature of senescent cells. These results strongly
suggest that eliminating p16Ink4a+ cells promotes
plaque stability.
To further investigate the mechanism by which
senescent cells drive atherogenesis, we tested the
possibility that senescent cells in plaques express
proatherogenic factors. We dissected lesion-
bearing tissue from HFD-fed Ldlr–/–;ATTAC mice,
prepared single-cell suspensions, and exploited
p16Ink4a-dependent expression of green fluores-
cent protein (GFP) by ATTAC to collect GFP+ se-
nescent and GFP– nonsenescent cell populations
for analysis by RT-qPCR (Fig. 4C). Senescent cells
expressed a broad spectrum of proatherogenic
factors, including Il1a, Tnfa, Mmp3, Mmp12,
Mmp13, Mcp1, and Vcam1 (Fig. 4C). A subset of
these factors (including Il1a, Mmp12, Mmp13, and
Mcp1) was expressed at markedly elevated levels
compared with expression in nonsenescent cells.
Using both transgenic and pharmacological
approaches to clear p16Ink4a+ cells without inter-
fering with the senescence program, we showed

Downloaded from 
 that senescent cells are uniformly deleterious
throughout atherogenesis. Very early fatty streaks
contain abundant senescent foam cell macro-
phages, which create an environment conducive
to further lesion growth by up-regulating inflam-
matory cytokines and monocyte chemotactic
factors. Removal of p16Ink4a+ foamy macrophages
from fatty streaks led to marked lesion regres-
sion. In contrast, advanced plaques contain three
morphologically distinct senescent cell types that
not only drive lesion maturation through inflam-
mation and monocyte chemotaxis but also pro-
mote extracellular matrix degradation. Clearing
senescent cells from advanced lesions inhibits
both plaque growth and maladaptive plaque re-
modeling processes associated with plaque rup-
ture, including fibrous cap thinning and elastic
fiber degeneration. Furthermore, senescent cells
in lesions show heightened expression of key
SASP factors and effectors of inflammation,
monocyte chemotaxis, and proteolysis, including
Il1a, Mcp1, Mmp12, and Mmp13. These data sug-
gest that senescent cells can directly influence
core proatherogenic processes through spe-
cific secreted factors. By comparison, the ex-
pression of other factors such as Mmp3, Tnfa,
and Vcam1 is reduced with senolysis, but these
factors are not enriched in p16Ink4a+ cells, which
implies that senescent cells also can influence the
proatherogenic milieu indirectly. Collectively, our
results show that senescent cells drive athero-
sclerosis at all stages through paracrine activity
and raise the possibility that druglike molecules
that remove senescent cells from patients with-
out toxic side effects could contribute to ther-
apeutic management of the disease.

Our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, have a complex demographic
history. We analyzed the high-coverage whole genomes of 75 wild-born chimpanzees
and bonobos from 10 countries in Africa. We found that chimpanzee population
substructure makes genetic information a good predictor of geographic origin at country
and regional scales. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that gene flow occurred from
bonobos into the ancestors of central and eastern chimpanzees between 200,000 and
550,000 years ago, probably with subsequent spread into Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees.
Together with another, possibly more recent contact (after 200,000 years ago), bonobos
contributed less than 1% to the central chimpanzee genomes. Admixture
thus appears to have been widespread during hominid evolution.
C
ompared with our knowledge of the ori-
gins and population history of humans,
much less is known about the extant spe-
cies closest to humans, chimpanzees (Pan
troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus).
Unraveling the demographic histories of our closest
living relatives provides an opportunity for com-
parisons with our own history and thus for study-
ing processes that might have played a recurring
role in hominid evolution. Because of a paucity of
fossil records (1), our understanding of the demo-
graphic history of the Pan genus has primarily
relied on population genetic data from mitochon-
drial genomes (2, 3), nuclear fragments (4, 5), and
microsatellites (6, 7). More recently, the analysis
of whole-genome sequences from chimpanzees
and bonobos has hinted at a complex evolution-
ary history for the four taxonomically recognized
chimpanzee subspecies (8). However, although
chimpanzees and bonobos hybridize in captivity
(9), the extent of interbreeding among chimpan-
zee subspecies and between chimpanzees and
bonobos in the wild remains unclear.
We analyzed 75 complete genomes from the
Pan genus, of which 40 were sequenced for this
project to a mean sequence coverage of 25-fold.
Our samples span 10 African countries, from the
westernmost to the easternmost regions of the
chimpanzee range (Fig. 1A). We discovered 32%
more variable sites than previously identified (8, 10),
highlighting the value of our sampling scheme.
Different lines of evidence suggest larger histor-
ical effective population sizes in central chim-
panzees, including haplotype diversity in each
subspecies (fig. S5), Y chromosome diversity (fig.
S3), fixation index (FST)–based phylogenies (fig.
S16), and genome-wide linkage disequilibrium
(fig S6). An analysis of the long-term demographic
