What is already known about the topic?
•
•
End-of-life care has been highlighted as a priority for policymakers nationally and internationally, but the extent to which 
this has been acted upon has not been systematically examined.
•
•
Policymakers are expected to base decisions on academic evidence; how evidence is used in relation to end-of-life care 
is unknown.
What this paper adds?
•
•
This is the first study to systematically analyse content relating to end-of-life care within local health care strategies, 
providing a comprehensive national picture of priorities and plans.
•
•
Half of local strategies in England did not mention end-of-life care; just 4% included end-of-life care as a priority area.
•
•
There was sparse use of evidence in relation to end-of-life care, particularly with respect to the effectiveness of interventions.
•
•
There was a lack of connection between identification of local end-of-life care needs, relevant targets and interventions.
•
•
There was a reliance on the place of death for quantifying need.

Abstract
Background: Prioritisation of end-of-life care by policymakers has been the subject of extensive rhetoric, but little scrutiny. In England, 
responsibility for improving health and care lies with 152 regional Health and Wellbeing Boards.
Aim: To understand the extent to which Health and Wellbeing Boards have identified and prioritised end-of-life care needs and their 
plans for improvement.
Design: Qualitative documentary analysis of Health and Wellbeing Strategies. Summative content analysis to quantify key concepts 
and identify themes.
Data sources: Strategies were identified from Local Authority web pages and systematically searched to identify relevant content.
Results: In total, 150 strategies were identified. End-of-life care was mentioned in 78 (52.0%) and prioritised in 6 (4.0%). Four themes 
emerged: (1) clinical context – in 43/78 strategies end-of-life care was mentioned within a specific clinical context, most often ageing and 
dementia; (2) aims and aspirations – 31 strategies identified local needs and/or quantifiable aims, most related to the place of death; 
(3) narrative thread – the connection between need, aim and planned intervention was disjointed, just six strategies included all three 
components; and (4) focus of evidence – where cited, evidence related to evidence of need, not evidence for effective interventions.
Conclusion: Half of Health and Wellbeing Strategies mention end-of-life care, few prioritise it and none cite evidence for effective 
interventions. The absence of connection between need, aim and intervention is concerning. Future research should explore whether 
and how strategies have impacted on local populations.

Implications for practice, theory or policy
•
•
Academic engagement with policymakers is needed to frame evidence relating to end-of-life care in such a way that it is 
timely, important, relevant and easy to use.
•
•
A more diverse array of metrics relating to end-of-life care, including for high-priority groups, should be provided at the 
local level.
•
•
Future research should investigate why some areas prioritised end-of-life care more than others, and whether and how 
strategies have impacted on local populations.
Introduction
The presence of a national government–led strategy for 
palliative and end-of-life care has been suggested as an 
important driver of the quality of care of the dying.1 In the 
United Kingdom, the first government-led End of Life Care 
Strategy was published in 2008.2 However, since then 
numerous high-profile reports including the Neuberger 
review into the Liverpool Care Pathway,3 the Ombudsman’s 
report Dying Without Dignity,4 the Health Select Committee 
report on end-of-life care5 and the Care Quality Commission 
review of inequalities near the end of life6 have highlighted 
the consequences of inadequate and highly variable end-
of-life care services.
In 2012, the health care system in England underwent 
a process of radical reform through the Health and Social 
Care act, which devolved planning for and delivery of 
health and social care to the local level. This was achieved 
through the establishment of Health and Wellbeing 
Boards, statutory committees of each of the 152 upper-
tier Local Authorities in England, designed to bring 
together the health and care system to improve the health 
and wellbeing of the local population. To do this, Health 
and Wellbeing Boards were required to produce a Joint 
Health and Wellbeing Strategy, setting out how the local 
population’s needs should be met by commissioners, with 
a core aim of developing ‘local evidence-based priorities 
for commissioning’.7
There are compelling reasons for end-of-life care to be 
a priority for local policymakers. It is estimated that 75% 
of those who die would benefit from palliative care,8 and 
the need for palliative care is projected to increase 42% by 
2040 due to population ageing.9 International evidence 
shows that access to services can improve outcomes near 
the end of life, for example, people who receive support 
from a specialist palliative care team are more likely to die 
at home and less likely to attend Emergency Departments 
close to death.10,11 In addition, there is a strong economic 
argument for investment in end-of-life care services, 
which are frequently cost neutral or cost saving.12 
However, there are currently large variations in commis-
sioning of specialist palliative care services: in England 
budgets for specialist palliative care services range from 
£51.83 to £2329.19 per patient per annum.13
Prioritisation of end-of-life care by policymakers has 
been the subject of extensive rhetoric.14–17 Whether and 
how this has been achieved at the local level has not been 
scrutinised. Devolution of responsibility for health and 
care to the local level provides an opportunity to examine 
how end-of-life care is prioritised and to identify opportu-
nities for improvement. The aim was to understand the 
extent to which Health and Wellbeing Boards have identi-
fied end-of-life care needs in their local populations, and 
their priorities and plans for improvement.
Methods
Design
Qualitative documentary analysis.
Data acquisition
Health and Wellbeing Strategies were identified from 
searches of Local Authority web pages. We were inter-
ested in the first strategies, published from 2012 onwards, 
to facilitate comparison across different areas. If the first 
strategy could not be identified, an email was sent to the 
Health and Wellbeing Board. Non-response was followed 
up by a further email. Searches and correspondence 
occurred between May 2017 and October 2017.
Data extraction
Strategies were systematically searched electronically for 
key terms to identify content relating to end-of-life care 
(palliat*, end of*, terminal, bereave*, death, die, dying). 
Content where key terms were mentioned in a context that 
did not relate specifically to end-of-life care (e.g. ‘winter 
deaths’), or those that mentioned these terms only in the 
context of the life course (e.g. ‘from birth to end of life’) 
without further focus on end-of-life care, was not included.
Where strategies did not include any reference to end-
of-life care, this was confirmed by two authors (K.E.S. and 
J.L.-M.). Where end-of-life care was included, the relevant 
sections were printed to produce a resource folder from 
which familiarisation of the data occurred. Qualitative soft-
ware was not used as we wanted to preserve the original 
 1476 
Palliative Medicine 32(9)
format, enabling distinction between the appearance of 
key terms in the main text and in figures. The relevant sec-
tion of each strategy was read in detail by K.E.S. and J.L.-M.
Following familiarisation and a pilot study focussing on 
one area (London), a data extraction form was devised. 
Information extracted included timescale of the strategy, 
total number of pages in the strategy, inclusion in the 
strategy of any mention of key terms relating to end-of-
life care, number of pages that included a mention of end-
of-life care, prioritisation of end-of-life care (named as a 
priority area or strategic objective, or focus area), identifi-
cation of a specific clinical context within which end-of-life 
care was mentioned, identification of evidence of need 
for improved end-of-life care, identification of a target for 
improvement and identification of a specific intervention 
for improving end-of-life care or link to an existing local 
end-of-life care strategy.
Data analysis
Summative content analysis was used to quantify key con-
cepts and identify themes. In summative content analysis, 
data analysis begins with systematic searches to quantify 
the occurrence of specific words or phrases, forming the 
basis for exploration of the data.18 This then allows for 
examination of the contextual use of these words and 
phrases, and further interpretation of the data. Summative 
content analysis is particularly useful when the aim is to 
summarise the content of qualitative data, such as docu-
ments and texts, for example, previous studies have used 
this approach to examine death and bereavement in nurs-
ing textbooks.19
An iterative process of analysis and discussion of each 
strategy informed the development of themes. Following a 
deductive analysis to identify ‘cases’ (strategies that did 
include reference to end-of-life care), more inductive and 
exploratory analyses were undertaken to consider the con-
text and detail of each case. Following analysis of all strate-
gies, themes and subthemes were refined in line with the 
study aims. Initial coding was undertaken by K.E.S. and 
J.L.-M., and any discrepancies were resolved in discussion 
between the analysis team (K.E.S., J.L.-M. and K.B.).
Results
In total, 150 Health and Wellbeing Strategies were iden-
tified, covering all 152 Health and Wellbeing Boards 
(Appendix 1). There were two strategies that each 
included two Health and Wellbeing Board areas. The 150 
strategies comprised a total of 4229 pages (mean 28.2, 
range 1–92). Most started in 2012 (35) or 2013 (92). 
Seven commenced in 2014 and one in 2015. In 15 there 
was no start date.
Of the 150 strategies identified, 72 (48.0%) contained 
no mention of any end-of-life care key terms (Figure 1). 
For the 78 strategies that did mention end-of-life care, the 
most common term identified was ‘end of*’ (either ‘end 
of life’ or ‘end of their lives’) a total of 245 uses in 70 strat-
egies. There were 180 uses of terms ‘death’, ‘dying’ or 
‘die’ in 48 strategies. The term ‘palliat*’ was used 16 times 
in 11 strategies, ‘bereave*’ was used 10 times in six strate-
gies and ‘terminal’ five times in five strategies.
The extent to which end-of-life care was prioritised 
within the 78 strategies was highly variable. The number 
of pages that mentioned end-of-life care ranged from 1 to 
8 (mean 2.4 pages). Six strategies (4.0% total) included 
end-of-life care as one of their main priorities. In contrast, 
39 of 78 strategies that mentioned end-of-life care 
included no contextual information on local need, an aim 
or target, or any specific plans for improvement. For 
example, in one strategy ‘End of Life Care’ was written in 
a figure, without any further detail in the text (strategy 
89). Another strategy mentioned ‘Supporting a good 
death for everyone’ but without any further information 
on how this might be achieved (strategy 65).
Four themes emerged from the data, regarding the 
context of end-of-life care, documentation of the aims 
and/or aspirations, narrative thread between needs and 
outcomes, and inclusion of evidence.
Context
This theme related to the clinical context within which 
end-of-life care was mentioned.
In 43 of 78 strategies, end-of-life care was mentioned 
within a specific clinical context, and in 29 of these the 
clinical context was exclusive: end-of-life care was not 
mentioned outside this context. The clinical context was 
most often related to ageing and older people (27 strate-
gies) and dementia (15 strategies). In these strategies, 
end-of-life care was usually mentioned as one part of an 
overall priority for this clinical group. For example, in one 
strategy with a priority on dementia: ‘An integrated care 
pathway for dementia is being developed … from raising 
awareness and early intervention, right through to end of 
life support’ (strategy 110).
Two strategies mentioned end-of-life care within the 
context of support for carers, one in the context of chil-
dren’s palliative care and one strategy mentioned end-of-
life care in the context of cancer. Three strategies had 
more than one clinical context.
Aims and aspirations
This theme contained two subthemes: identification of 
need and identification of targets for improvement.
Strategies frequently included general aspirations to 
improve end-of-life care, using abstract concepts such as 
‘dignity’, ‘support’, ‘respect’ and ‘choice’ (e.g. ‘make sure 
people are supported and treated with dignity and respect 
 Sleeman et al. 
1477
at the end of their lives’, strategy 108). No strategy quanti-
fied the level of need or identified a target with respect to 
these aspirations.
Identification of need. Quantifiable outcomes were both 
less common and less variable. A total of 21 strategies 
quantified local end-of-life care need, in all cases this was 
related to the place of death: 14 strategies cited the local 
home death rate, 8 the percentage of hospital deaths and 
3 other aspects of place of death; 10 of these 21 strategies 
included a geographical comparison for context, for exam-
ple, comparing the local proportion of home deaths with 
another region (either local or national), and 5 included 
the temporal context, for example, indicating that home 
deaths are rising in the local area.
Identification of targets for improvement. A total of 19 
strategies included one or more quantifiable aims relating 
to end-of-life care. Again, these most commonly related 
to the place of death (in 18 strategies). Seven strategies 
identified increasing home and care home deaths as a tar-
get, four identified reducing hospital deaths and nine 
identified other aspects of the place of death. Strategies 
commonly used words such as ‘increase’ and ‘decrease’ 
with respect to these aims; however, few strategies iden-
tified specific numerical targets.
Four of these 19 strategies included aims that were not 
related to the place of death: in two the number of people 
with end-of-life or advance care plans, in one the number 
of people on an Electronic Palliative Care Coordination 
System and in one plans to measure bereaved carers’ 
views of quality of end-of-life care and the number of 
patients on ‘appropriate recognised care pathways’.
Strategies that mentioned end-of-life care within a 
specific clinical context (such as ageing or dementia) were 
less likely to include evidence of need or targets than 
those that mentioned end-of-life care in general contexts. 
Of the 29 strategies with an exclusive clinical context, four 
identified a need and just three included a target.
Narrative thread
Overall, the connection between need, aim and interven-
tion was disjointed.
Of the 78 strategies, 39 identified one or more of the 
following: evidence of need (21 strategies), a target (19 
strategies) and a specific intervention or linked strategy 
for improvement (21 strategies). Only six included all 
three elements (Figure 2).
Of the 21 strategies that cited evidence of need, 9 strate-
gies identified a related aim or target and 10 identified spe-
cific interventions or linked strategies. Specific interventions

Strategies were identified, covering all 152 Health and Wellbeing Boards in England. Of these, 72 (48.0%) contained no mention of 
any end-of-life care key terms. Of the 78 strategies that mentioned end-of-life care, 39 (50.0%) included no information on local 
needs, aims or planned interventions. Six strategies (4.0% total) included end-of-life care as a priority area.

included the Gold Standards Framework, named Electronic 
Palliative Care Coordination Systems, and regionally devel-
oped End of Life Models and Charters. The rationale for 
these specific interventions was not usually given, and no 
strategy highlighted the likely expected improvement in out-
comes from implementing these specific interventions.
A further 8 of these 21 strategies mentioned non-spe-
cific aspirational plans to improve end-of-life care. These

evidence of need (21 strategies), an aim or target (19 strategies) and a specific intervention or linked strategy for improvement (21 
strategies). Six Health and Wellbeing Strategies included all three elements.
 Sleeman et al. 
1479
included ‘Empower and enable people to make positive 
choices’, ‘Ensure that community based services are in 
place’, ‘Encourage and provide a system for families and 
carers to feedback their experiences’ and ‘Ensure that pal-
liative care services are integrated’ (strategies 73, 37, 79 
and 131). There was no indication of how these aspira-
tions might be achieved.
Narrow focus of evidence
Where evidence was cited, this related to evidence of 
need and not evidence for effective interventions.
Of the 21 strategies that cited evidence of need, few 
provided a source or reference for the information. Two 
strategies cited National End of Life Care Profiles, availa-
ble from NHS England. One strategy cited academic evi-
dence in relation to end-of-life care ‘The Cicely Saunders 
Institute 2012 study found that 66% of study participants 
… would prefer to die at home’ (strategy 114), but did not 
provide a full reference.
No strategy cited evidence in the context of planned 
interventions.
Discussion
Improving end-of-life care requires not only prioritisation 
by policymakers, but also strategies that focus on evi-
dence-based interventions and plans for measuring pro-
gress. In this qualitative documentary analysis, almost half 
of Health and Wellbeing Strategies in England included no 
mention of end-of-life care, and very few included end-of-
life care as a priority area. There was a lack of connection 
between identification of need, relevant targets and inter-
ventions for improvement. Even among the six strategies 
that prioritised end-of-life care, just three identified a 
need, a target and an intervention. There was sparse use 
of evidence, particularly in the context of interventions.
Given that the core aim of Health and Wellbeing 
Strategies is to develop local ‘evidence-based priorities’,7 
the sparse use of evidence in them is a concern. Where 
evidence was used, it was in the context of need, rather 
than evidence for effective interventions. This may reflect 
the relative scarcity of interventional compared to obser-
vational research, an issue which is not exclusive to end-
of-life care.20,21
There was a reliance on the place of death as a meas-
ure of need and a target for improvement. This reflects a 
strong policy focus on the place of death over the past 
decade.2 This policy focus has been accompanied by a 
research focus, and there is a growing body of evidence 
for interventions that reduce death in hospital.10,22 Better 
dissemination of this evidence to policymakers may be 
key to improve the narrative thread from the need to 
intervention. There was less emphasis on the place of 
death in strategies that focused exclusively on a particular 
clinical context (e.g. ageing or dementia), which may 
reflect a paucity of available data for these subgroups.
That only one strategy mentioned end-of-life care in 
the context of cancer is surprising given the historical 
association of UK palliative care services with cancer.23 In 
contrast, end-of-life care was frequently mentioned in the 
context of ageing and dementia, which is encouraging in 
light of the projected increase in population palliative care 
needs in these groups.9
While Health and Wellbeing Strategies have existed 
since 2012, they have been subject to little academic scru-
tiny. A previous study of 50 Health and Wellbeing 
Strategies found that they varied widely in timescale, 
length and structure, and had inadequate focus on evi-
dence.24 Other studies have examined Health and 
Wellbeing Board activity from the perspective of a specific 
clinical area. An exploration of mental health coverage in 
Health and Wellbeing Strategies found that 91% included 
at least one area of mental health and 46% set mental 
health as a standalone priority.25
Strengths and limitations
We believe our study is the first to systematically analyse 
prioritisation of end-of-life care within local health care 
strategies, providing a comprehensive national picture of 
priorities and plans. All 150 Health and Wellbeing Strategies 
were analysed. However, this method cannot inform us 
about the context in which strategies were developed, 
about why variation occurs or about how these strategies 
are being used.24 At the time of analysis, some Health and 
Wellbeing Boards had published follow-on strategies, 
which were not examined. It would be interesting to com-
pare the first with subsequent strategies. Some Health and 
Wellbeing Strategies indicated the presence of a separate 
end-of-life care strategy. It was beyond the scope of this 
study to examine these in detail, and therefore we adopted 
an inclusive approach such that these were included with 
‘specific interventions’ to improve care.
Conclusion
1. 
Despite high-profile calls for prioritisation of end-
of-life care, our study shows that only half of Health 
and Wellbeing Strategies mention end-of-life care 
and few indicate what should be improved or how 
this will happen. Engagement with policymakers 
around the importance of the narrative thread 
from need to intervention would be valuable. 
Further research is needed to explore why some 
areas prioritised end-of-life care more than others 
and to examine whether and how local strategies 
have influenced outcomes at the end of life.
2. 
Although the core aim of Health and Wellbeing 
Strategies is to develop evidence-based priorities 
 1480 
Palliative Medicine 32(9)
for commissioning, there is scant use of evidence 
with respect to end-of-life care. Academic engage-
ment with policymakers is needed to frame appro-
priate evidence in such a way that it is timely, 
important, relevant and easy to use. Building rela-
tionships with policymakers, and understanding 
policymakers’ priorities, is key.26,27
3. 
The identification of targets for improvement is 
constrained by available data, which in England 
has focused on the place of death. Providing local 
policymakers with a more diverse array of metrics 
would enable a broader focus for improvement. 
For example, in England additional metrics have 
been proposed to include Emergency Department 
attendance and time spent in hospital in the last 
months of life.28 These data should be available for 
high-priority groups such as older people and 
those with dementia, to enable policymakers to 
identify their specific needs and plan services 
accordingly.
4. 
Documentary analysis of health care strategies can 
be a valuable tool to highlight areas of inequality 
and drive change.29,30 For example, such analyses 
have been used to examine palliative care content 
in national dementia strategies.31 These methods 
have the potential to be adopted more widely to 
explore the prioritisation of end-of-life care by poli-
cymakers, both within and between different health 
care settings. We recommend that future analyses 
include assessment of the following elements: (1) 
identification of local end-of-life care needs, includ-
ing temporal and geographical trends; (2) identifica-
tion of numerical targets for improvement with 
indicative time frames and (3) identification of 
appropriate interventions, including evidence of 
effectiveness with respect to the identified target, 
and the anticipated improvement.
