Objective.—To determine whether headache disorders are a risk factor for the development of new onset hypothyroidism.
Background.—Past studies have reported associations between headache disorders and hypothyroidism, but the direc-
tionality of the association is unknown.
Methods.—This was a longitudinal retrospective cohort study using data from the Fernald Medical Monitoring Program
(FMMP). Residents received physical examinations and thyroid function testing every 3 years during the 20 year program.
Residents were excluded from the cohort if there was evidence of past thyroid disease or abnormal thyroid function tests at
the first office visit. A diagnosis of a headache disorder was established by self-report of “frequent headaches,” use of any
headache-specific medication, or a physician diagnosis of a headache disorder. The primary outcome measure was new onset
hypothyroidism defined as the initiation of thyroid replacement therapy or TSH � 10 without thyroid medication. A Cox sur-
vival analysis with time dependent variables were used for the model. Headache disorders, age, sex, body mass index, income,
smoking, narcotic use, and hypothyroidism-producing medications were independent variables in the model.
Results.—Data from 8412 residents enrolled in the FMMP were used in the current study. Headache disorders were pre-
sent in about 26% of the residents and new onset hypothyroidism developed in �7%. The hazard ratio for the development
of new onset hypothyroidism was 1.21 (95% CI5 1.001, 1.462) for those with headache disorders.
Conclusions.—Headache disorders may be associated with an increased risk for the development of new onset hypothyroidism.

INTRODUCTION
Migraine and hypothyroidism are both common
medical disorders. Migraine occurs in 12% of the
United States population1 while hypothyroidism is
present in 0.1–2% of the general population.2–4 Both
are more prevalent in women and are associated with
significant morbidity.1,5 Annual costs for migraine and
thyroid disease are estimated at $17 billion and $4

 billion, respectively.6,7 Therefore, migraine and hypo-
thyroidism share many demographic and socioeco-
nomic characteristics.
Hypothyroidism is associated with a variety of
symptoms including fatigue, constipation, cold intol-
erance, weight gain, and infertility.5 It is diagnosed
when serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone
(TSH) are � 10 mU/L and/or total serum thyroxine
(T4) levels are � 4.8 lg/dL.8 Hypothyroidism can
result from a variety of causes, but the majority of
cases in developed nations are due to Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis.5 The pathophysiology of Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis has been thought to involve immunolog-
ic mechanisms with anti-thyroid antibodies being
present in 90% of persons with this disorder.2
Most studies have reported an increased preva-
lence of hypothyroidism in persons with headache
disorders.9–14 Many of these studies however have
important methodological limitations. First, many of
the past studies used clinic-based samples,10,12–15
which may not be representative of the general pop-
ulation. Second, some studies relied upon patient
self-report instead of hormone levels to establish a
diagnosis of hypothyroidism, which may not provide
an accurate diagnosis of the condition.9,10,12 Third,
all of the past studies were cross-sectional and,
therefore, unable to assess the direction of the asso-
ciation.9–14 Fourth, covariates associated with hypo-
thyroidism (eg, smoking, gender, medications) were
not controlled for in many of the analyses.9,10,12–15
We
performed
a
longitudinal
retrospective
cohort study using data from the Fernald Medical
Monitoring Program (FMMP), a medical surveil-
lance program of residents who lived around the
Fernald uranium processing plant near Cincinnati,
Ohio.16,17 Our primary objective for this study was
to determine whether the incidence of hypothyroid-
ism was increased in patients with preexisting head-
ache
disorders
and/or
possible
migraine
after
adjusting for covariates such as age, gender, medi-
cations, smoking, and body mass index (BMI).
METHODS
The Fernald cohort included 8788 adult resi-
dents that lived around the Fernald uranium proc-
essing plant near Cincinnati, Ohio.17 The medical
monitoring
program
was
financed
with
funds
obtained from a settlement of a class action law
suit filed by the Fernald residents against National
Lead of Ohio (NLO) and the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE). This law suit was filed after it was
discovered that uranium dust had been released by
the plant into the environment from 1952 to 1989.
The FMMP was conducted from 1988 to 2008. A
separate medical monitoring program was estab-
lished for workers of the Fernald plant.
Residents were required to be at least 18 years
old and live or work within 5 miles of the uranium
plant for a continuous period of 2 years or greater
during 1952–1984 to be eligible for the FMMP.
Approximately one quarter of the eligible persons
volunteered for the FMMP. Program participants
received physical examinations upon entrance into
the program and every 2 or 3 years thereafter. Dur-
ing the initial and follow-up physical examinations,
the age and body mass index (BMI) of each partici-
pant was ascertained. Medication use was verified
during physical examinations by recall of their medi-
cation lists and/or review of the pill bottles that were
brought with them. A verbal question querying the
patient about the presence or absence of “frequent
headaches” was included during the initial examina-
tion for the FMMP. Thyroid function testing was
performed during the initial and all subsequent
follow-up examinations. The type of thyroid function
testing used to screen for hypothyroidism varied by
year. Thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) resin
uptake tests were done from 1988 to 1994 and thy-
roxine stimulating hormone (TSH) tests were done
from 1994 to 2008. Participants also completed writ-
ten questionnaires by mail every year asking them

 to record any new medical illnesses and to list their
current medications.
All adult participants of the Fernald cohort
aged 18 years or older were eligible for participa-
tion in this study. The only exclusion criterion was
the presence of past thyroid disease at the time of
enrollment in the surveillance program. Past thy-
roid disease was defined as patient self-report of
thyroid disease, thyroid cancer, or thyroid ablation
with radioactive iodine, use of any thyroid-specific
medication (eg, any thyroid replacement therapy,
methimazole, propylthiouracil), or values of TSH at
the time of the initial physical examination that
were outside the normal ranges as defined by the
laboratory that performed the test. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the
University of Cincinnati.
A headache disorder was diagnosed by any of
the following: (1) physician diagnosis of tension
headache,
migraine,
or
cluster
headache
at
the
time of one of the examinations, (2) self-report of
“frequent headaches” from the standardized review
of systems (ROS) from the initial physical examina-
tion, or (3) use of headache-specific abortive medica-
tions (eg, triptans, ergots, isometheptan or butalbital-
containing medications) at any time prior to a diag-
nosis
of
hypothyroidism.
Possible
migraine
was
defined as use of headache-specific medications or a
diagnosis of migraine headache established by the
treating physician. We believe this definition of possi-
ble migraine is justified as a past study reported that
a physician diagnosis of migraine had a 98% positive
predictive value for identifying patients with migraine
or possible migraine when patient diaries were exam-
ined by experts in the headache field.18 Another
study found the use of prescription headache medica-
tions
conferred
a
12-fold
greater
likelihood
of
migraine than tension-type headache.19
Definition of Covariates.—Covariates included in
the analysis were age, sex, body mass index (BMI),
smoking,
narcotic
use,
hypothyroidism-inducing
medications,
and
cumulative
uranium
exposure.
The age and BMI were defined as the value of
these variables recorded at the time of the initial
physical examination. Age was categorized into six
different age groups: 18–30, 30–40, 40–50, 50–60,
60–70, and > 70 years old. Hypothyroidism-inducing
medications were defined as any use of lithium,
amiodarone, and a-interferon prior to the diagnosis
of hypothyroidism. Narcotic use was considered
present with any use of narcotic medications (eg,
oxycodone, hydrocodone, methadone, meperidine,
morphine, and butorphenol) prior to diagnosis.
Narcotic use was included in the models because
narcotics have been associated with opioid-induced
endocrinopathies
and
elevation
of
TSH
in
humans.20 Smoking was defined as cumulative pack
years prior to diagnosis and cumulative uranium
exposure was measured in micrograms/m3-year esti-
mated by algorithms developed by the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC).21
Definition of Primary Outcome Measure.—The
primary outcome measure was (1) new onset hypo-
thyroidism defined as the start of thyroid replace-
ment medication by the treating physician at any
time after the first physical examination for the
monitoring program or (2) TSH � 10 in the absence
of thyroid medication or history of thyroid surgery
or irradiation.
Statistics.—Initially, a t-test with unequal vari-
ance was used to analyze differences of mean age
and BMI between the incident and non-incident
hypothyroidism groups. Differences in all other
covariates were assessed with a chi-square test.
For the primary analyses, a Cox survival analy-
sis was performed with time-dependent and time-
independent covariates. The time-dependent covari-
ates included body mass index (BMI), smoking
(cumulative pack years), narcotic use (yes/no), and
hypothyroidism-producing meds (yes/no). Sex and
age at baseline were the time independent covari-
ates. Two different models were run. Model 1
included headaches disorders (yes/no) along with
the above covariates and model 2 included possible
migraine (yes/no) with the above covariates. Each
of the headache outcome measures was a time-
dependent
covariate.
Uranium
exposure
was
trimmed from the final models as it was not signifi-
cant in any of our analyses. No imputation of miss-
ing data
was
performed because
of the
small
amount of missing data. A P-value of � .05 was
considered significant.

 RESULTS
There were a total of 8788 adult participants
enrolled in the FMMP. Two hundred and sixteen partic-
ipants voluntarily withdrew from the FMMP at some
point during the length of the FMMP and 184 were lost
to follow-up, but both groups were included in the sur-
vival analysis. The mean duration of participation in the
FMMP was 12.6 years and the median number of com-
pleted visits was four. Greater than 50% of the partici-
pants initially enrolled in the study continued to receive
physical examinations every 2 or 3 years until its
completion. Thyroid function testing was performed at
the time of every medical monitoring examination.
For this analysis, 16 participants were excluded
for past thyroid cancer while another 360 were
excluded for a diagnosis of hypothyroidism or
hyperthyroidism noted at baseline. Therefore, there
were 8412 persons that comprised the study popula-
tion for this study (Fig. 1). The total number of per-
son years included in the study was 105,780 years.
There were differences in the demographic and
clinical characteristics between the incident and
non-incident hypothyroidism groups. The percent-
age of participants within the incident hypothyroid-
ism group were significantly more likely to be
female (76% vs 52%), older (P < .0001 comparing
age groups), and to have used narcotics (14% vs
8.9%) or hypothyroidism-inducing medications (3%
vs 0.8%). Those with incident hypothyroidism also
had a higher BMI (28.2 vs 27.5) and were less likely
to smoke (14.9% vs 23.1%) than the non-incident
group. The percentage of participants at baseline
with a diagnosis of a headache disorder did not dif-
fer between the groups. In contrast, the percentage

—New onset hypothyroidism developed in 8.2%
(166/2021) of patients with headache disorders and
6.2%
(396/6391) of those

After
adjusting for covariates, the hazard ratio (HR) for
the development of new onset hypothyroidism was
1.210 (95% CI 5 1.001, 1.462) in patients with head-
ache disorders. Age was a significant predictor of
new
onset
hypothyroidism
with
a
progressive
increase in the HRs from the youngest to the oldest
age groups. Other covariates that were significant
included female gender (HR 2.638; 95% CI 2.169,
3.209), BMI (HR 1.027; 95% CI 1.014, 1.039),
smoking (HR 0.618; 95% CI 0.458, 0.835), and HT-
inducing medications (HR 5.836; 95% CI 3.416,
9.970). Narcotic use was not a significant predictor
of new onset hypothyroidism (Table 2).
Figure 2 illustrates the model predicted cumula-
tive incidence of hypothyroidism in those with and
without headache disorders stratified by years from

significantly increased percentage of new onset
hypothyroidism after 10, 15, and 20 years.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge this represents the first lon-
gitudinal cohort study investigating the relationship
between headache disorders and hypothyroidism.
Our study found that patients with preexisting
headache disorders had a 21% increased risk of
developing new onset hypothyroidism while those
with possible migraine showed an increased risk of
41%. The fact that the HR increased in those with
possible migraine might suggest that individuals
with migraine are particularly susceptible to the
future development of hypothyroidism.
Our results are consistent with past studies dem-
onstrating
headache
and
hypothyroidism
to
be
comorbid conditions.9–14 Most of the these studies
were clinic-based, but two that were population-
based also found the prevalence of self-reported
hypothyroidism to be greater in persons with head-
ache and/or migraine than controls.9,11 In contrast to
our findings, one of the two population-based studies
reported that headache was 50% less likely in women
without self-reported hypothyroidism that had TSH
values � 10.11 These contradictory findings might be
explained by differences in study design. First, our
definition of headache was primarily based on a ques-
tion regarding “frequent headaches” while theirs was
based on “any headache occurring in the last year.”
Therefore, our study may have included patients with
more frequent headaches, which may have increased
the probability of finding an association with hypothy-
roidism. This is corroborated by a past study in which
hypothyroidism was 8.4 times more prevalent in per-
sons with chronic migraine compared to those with
episodic migraine.10 Our study employed a longitudi-
nal design as opposed to a cross-sectional design used
in their study. In addition, our use of a Cox survival
analysis is a very robust statistical analysis and one
that is more sensitive for identifying differences
between groups.
The longitudinal design of our study allowed us
to evaluate a unidirectional temporal relationship
between headache and hypothyroidism. We found
that headache disorders preceded the development
of hypothyroidism. We were not able to determine
whether
preexisting
hypothyroidism
predicted
future development of headache disorders since our
definition
of
headache
disorders
was
primarily
based on the question regarding “frequent head-
aches” that was only completed at the time of the
initial physical examination upon entrance into the
Fernald program. Therefore, a longitudinal study
would not have been plausible because of the small
number of incident headache cases.
Other Covariates.—We also found that female
gender,
increasing
age,
higher
BMI,
and
hypothyroid-inducing medications were associated
with incident hypothyroidism. These findings are
consistent
with
past
studies
demonstrating
an
increased prevalence of hypothyroidism in individ-
uals with these covariates.2,5 Furthermore, previ-
ous
literature
has
established
smoking
as
a
protective factor in the development of hypothy-
roidism and our data concur with these findings.22
Radiation is a known risk factor for the develop-
ment of hypothyroidism, yet no association of ura-
nium exposure and thyroid disease was found in
this study likely due to the type of uranium
released by the Fernald nuclear plant. Uranium
digestion
by-products
were
released
into
the
ground water, and uranium oxide and fluoride par-
ticulates were the primary exposures to the com-
munity. Since this plant processed uranium ore
and recycled uranium metal products, almost no
enriched uranium was processed, and therefore
there was no I-131 exposure from this plant.23 In
6
Month 2016
 addition, we did not find narcotic use to be associ-
ated with incident hypothyroidism.
Proposed Mechanisms.—There are several pro-
posed mechanisms to explain the association between
headache disorders and hypothyroidism including
unidirectional or bidirectional causal relationships,
shared genetic or environmental factors and con-
founding variables. Two potential mechanisms to
explain a causal relationship include alterations in the
immune system and autonomic nervous system.
Alterations in the immune system that occur as
a result of headache disorders and/or migraine might
directly cause Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Human stud-
ies have reported elevations in C-reactive protein
(CRP) and alterations in the proportions of T lym-
phocytes in migraineurs during interictal time peri-
ods as well as elevations of cytokines and leukocyte
adhesion
molecules
during
an
acute
migraine
attack.24–27 Likewise, deviations in serum cytokines,
humeral/cellular immunity, and leukocyte cell sur-
face receptors exist in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.28
Therefore, one might theorize that inflammation
that occurs as a result of migraine might predispose
to thyroid autoimmunity.
In contrast, the production of anti-thyroid anti-
bodies as a result of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis could
cause headache. This possibility may at first seem
unlikely since headache preceded the TSH elevation;
nevertheless,
thyroid
autoantibodies
are
present
long before the development of hypothyroidism.29,30
Research conducted on Hashimoto’s encephalopathy
(HE) has found that anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-
TPO) and anti-neuronal antibodies are present in cere-
brospinal fluid and brain tissue.31,32 While few if any
patients in our study had HE, it is possible that autoan-
tibody penetration into the central nervous system may
predispose to headache disorders prior to the onset of
serum disturbances in thyroid hormones.
Several studies have shown decreased sympa-
thetic nervous system activity during interictal time
periods in migraine patients.33–35 Catecholamines
promote the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the
much more active triiodothyronine (T3) and may
directly induce mitosis in the thyroid gland.36 Thus,
migraineurs with sympathetic hypofunction may be
at a greater risk for migraine and hypothyroidism.
Shared genetic mechanisms may explain the
association as elevated serum homocysteine levels
have been found in both disorders.37,38 Genetic anal-
yses have linked the C677T polymorphism of the
methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene to
migraine and the homozygous variant of this poly-
morphism has been shown to be associated with
hyperhomocysteinemia.39 A meta-analysis demon-
strated elevated plasma homocysteine to be associat-
ed with hypothyroidism which is consistent with the
results of this study.38 Therefore, hyperhomocyste-
mia as a result of MTHFR gene mutations could
predispose to both migraine and hypothyroidism.
Shared environmental factors could lead to both
disorders if the lag time after exposure to initiate the
disorder was longer for hypothyroidism than head-
ache disorders. Examples of such factors include air
pollutants, bisphenol A (BPA), and perfluorooctanoic
acid (PFOA). Air pollutants and synthetic com-
pounds such as BPA can alter thyroid peroxidase
function in rodent models.40,41 Thyroid peroxidase is
a key enzyme involved in the formation of thyroid
hormone. Air pollution is also a known trigger factor
for migraine headaches42 and one study found BPA
increased migraine-like behavior (eg, locomotor retar-
dation, photophobia, phonophobia, facial grooming,
and startle response) in rats.43 PFOA has also been
linked to thyroid disease in adults44 and, in rodents,
can accumulate in the brain causing neurotoxicity.45
Finally, headache and hypothyroidism could be
related through known or unknown confounding
variables. However, we made every attempt to con-
trol for known confounding variables in our analy-
ses
such
as
smoking,
hypothyroidism-inducing
medications, narcotic medication use, and obesity.
Strengths and Limitations.—There are several
strengths of the study. First, we used robust mathe-
matical modeling employing survival analysis, which
improved estimates of our outcome measures by
using time-dependent variables. Second, thyroid
function testing was performed every 3 years for an
average follow-up of 10 years. Therefore, we should
have captured the vast majority of cases of hypo-
thyroidism in our sample with such rigorous screen-
ing of the population. Third, this represented a
large population-based sample, which should allow
Headache

 for generalization to persons with headache disor-
ders in the United States. Third, we were able to
include most of the known risk factors for hypothy-
roidism as covariates in our models (eg, age, gen-
der, hypothyroidism-inducing medications, smoking,
and obesity).
There were several important limitations to the
study. First, our diagnoses of headache disorders
and possible migraine were not based on Interna-
tional
Classification
of
Headache
Disorders-III
(ICHD-III) beta criteria. Future studies will need
to be performed that define specific headache disor-
ders
such
as
migraine
using
criteria
from
the
ICHD-III beta to confirm or refute the findings
from this study. Second, serum samples were not
analyzed for thyroid autoantibodies and thus no
conclusions can be definitively made about the role
of these antibodies in the relationship between
headache and hypothyroidism. Third, only about
25% of participants who were eligible for the
FMMP enrolled in the study leading to the possibil-
ity of volunteer bias. Fourth, we did not adjust our
analyses for multiple comparisons and therefore
our results should be preliminary until confirmed in
other studies. Fifth, our definition of hypothyroid-
ism included those that were started on thyroid
replacement medications by their treating physi-
cian. It is possible that some of these participants
were started on these medications because of sub-
clinical hypothyroidism and not overt hypothyroid-
ism. We cannot rule out the possibility that some of
our cases of overt hypothyroidism might have actu-
ally been included those with subclinical hypothy-
roidism. Sixth, our study definition of headache
disorders was primarily based on a question regard-
ing “frequent headaches” from the patient ques-
tionnaire during the first office and these results
may be most generalizable to a population with fre-
quent headaches. Seventh, the P values for both of
the above analyses were < .05, but were very close
to non-significance. Thus our results should be cau-
tiously interpreted until replicated in future studies.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study provides evidence that headache dis-
orders in general and particularly possible migraine
may increase the risk of future development of
hypothyroidism. Mechanisms through which these
two disorders might be associated include modula-
tion of immune function, autonomic dysfunction,
elevated serum homocysteine levels, shared envi-
ronmental factors, or confounding variables. These
represent interesting results that will need to be
confirmed in future epidemiology studies.
