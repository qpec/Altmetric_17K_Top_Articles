How does human brain structure mature during adolescence? We
used MRI to measure cortical thickness and intracortical myelination
in 297 population volunteers aged 14–24 y old. We found and repli-
cated that association cortical areas were thicker and less myelinated
than primary cortical areas at 14 y. However, association cortex had
faster rates of shrinkage and myelination over the course of adoles-
cence. Age-related increases in cortical myelination were maximized
approximately at the internal layer of projection neurons. Adolescent
cortical myelination and shrinkage were coupled and specifically as-
sociated with a dorsoventrally patterned gene expression profile
enriched for synaptic, oligodendroglial- and schizophrenia-related
genes. Topologically efficient and biologically expensive hubs of the
brain anatomical network had greater rates of shrinkage/myelination
and were associated with overexpression of the same transcriptional
profile as cortical consolidation. We conclude that normative human
brain maturation involves a genetically patterned process of consoli-
dating anatomical network hubs. We argue that developmental var-
iation of this consolidation process may be relevant both to normal
cognitive and behavioral changes and the high incidence of schizo-
phrenia during human brain adolescence.

A
dolescence is associated with major behavioral, social, and
sexual changes as well as increased risk for many psychiatric
disorders (1). However, human brain maturation during ado-
lescence is not yet so well understood. Historically, pioneering
studies used histological techniques to show that distinct areas of
cortex were differentially myelinated in postmortem examination
of perinatal tissue, suggesting “myelinogenesis” as an important
process in human brain development (2, 3). MRI can measure
human brain development more comprehensively and over a
wider age range than is possible for postmortem anatomists. The
thickness of human cortex can be reliably and replicably mea-
sured by MRI (4), and longitudinal studies have shown that
cortical thickness (CT; millimeters) monotonically shrinks over
the course of postnatal development, with variable shrinkage
rates estimated for different age ranges (5–11; review in ref. 12).
CT typically shrinks from about 3.5 mm at age 13 y old (9) to
about 2.2 mm at age 75 y old (10, 11). Rates of cortical shrinkage
are faster during adolescence (approximately −0.05 mm/y) than
in later adulthood or earlier childhood (9).
What does this MRI phenomenon of cortical shrinkage repre-
sent at a cellular level? There are broadly two tenable models:
pruning and myelination. Basic physical principles of MRI predict
that shorter longitudinal (T1) relaxation times reflect either a
reduction in the fraction of “watery” cytoplasmic material, like cell
bodies, synapses, or extracellular fluid, or an increase in the
fraction of “fatty” myelinated material, like axons. Pruning models
propose that cortical shrinkage in adolescence represents loss or
remodeling of synapses, dendrites, or cell bodies (13). Myelination
models propose that the cortex appears to shrink because of an
increasing proportion of myelinated axons, without necessarily
implying any loss or change of neuronal material (5).
In the macaque monkey, although the main phase of synaptic
pruning and neuronal loss occurs earlier in development (14, 15),
there is evidence for further synaptic remodeling during adolescence
(16, 17). In rodents, there is histological evidence for increasing
intracortical myelination during adolescence, especially at the deeper
cytoarchitectonic layers of cortex (V and VI) (18, 19). At a cellular
Significance
Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high in-
cidence of mental health disorders. Here, we show consistently
in two MRI cohorts that human brain changes in adolescence
were concentrated on the more densely connected hubs of the
connectome (i.e., association cortical regions that mediated
efficient connectivity throughout the human brain structural
network). Hubs were less myelinated at 14 y but had faster
rates of myelination and cortical shrinkage in the 14- to 24-y
period. This topologically focused process of cortical consoli-
dation was associated with expression of genes enriched for
normal synaptic and myelin-related processes and risk of
schizophrenia. Consolidation of anatomical network hubs
could be important for normal and clinically disordered ado-
lescent brain development.

 level, this signal likely reflects a developmentally late myelination of
efferent axonal segments immediately distal to the axonal hillock of
pyramidal cells (20). MRI sequences have been recently developed
for myelin mapping in humans (21). These techniques include
methods based on magnetization transfer (MT), which have been
validated as an MRI marker of myelination by postmortem imaging
and histological studies of multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating disorder
(22) (details are in Methods). It has been shown that primary sensory
and motor areas of cortex are more heavily myelinated than associ-
ation cortical areas, that most cortical areas show progressive in-
creases in myelination over the course of normative development into
middle age, and that myelination is concentrated in deeper layers of
cortex (21, 23, 24). Association cortical areas have been identified
among the highly connected “hubs” of structural brain networks (25),
suggesting that differential rates of intracortical myelination might be
related to differences between regions in their topological roles as
part of the connectome. Developmental changes in structural and
functional MRI network topology have been reported (review in ref.
26) but not previously related to measures of cortical shrinkage or
myelination. Recently, several studies have linked brain regional gene
expression to axonal connectivity in the mouse (27, 28) and functional
MRI networks in humans (29, 30), but there have been no previous
efforts to investigate genetic mechanisms of adolescent myelination of
human cortex.
In this context, we aimed to test three hypotheses: (i) that ado-
lescent cortical shrinkage was coupled to intracortical myelination, (ii)
that adolescent cortical shrinkage/myelination (also known as con-
solidation) was concentrated anatomically on association cortex and
topologically on the most strongly connected regions (hubs) of the
human brain anatomical network, and (iii) that adolescent consoli-
dation of these connectome hubs was associated with a specific
gene expression profile, enriched for neuronal and oligodendroglial
function, and enriched for risk of schizophrenia, a neuro-
developmental disorder with its highest incidence in young adults.
We used quantitative multiparameter mapping (MPM) (31) to
test these hypotheses on MRI data acquired from a sample of
297 healthy young people sampled from primary healthcare
registers, stratified by age, and balanced for sex in the adolescent
age range 14–24 y old, with ∼60 participants in each of five age-
defined strata: 14–15 y old inclusive, 16–17 y old, 18–19 y old,
20–21 y old, and 22–24 y old (Methods and SI Appendix, Table
S1). From the MRI data, we measured CT (millimeters) and MT
[percentage units (PU)] at each of 308 cortical regions for all
participants. We used linear models to estimate baseline CT and
MT at 14 y old and age-related rates of change in the period
from 14 to 24 y old (ΔCT and ΔMT) from data on participants of
all ages at each regional node. We explored the relationships
between these local cortical MRI markers and a few key metrics
of complex network topology that have been widely used in prior
neuroimaging and other neuroscience studies (review in ref. 32).
We focused on the degree and closeness of each node—as
measures of nodal “hubness”—and the community structure of
the network—defined as a set of sparsely interconnected mod-
ules; details of topological connectome analysis are in Methods
and SI Appendix. We investigated the relationships between gene
transcriptional profiles and colocalized MRI (CT and MT) and
network topological phenotypes by multivariate analysis of MRI
data on 297 adolescents and whole-genome gene expression
maps of six adult human brains (postmortem) provided by the
Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) (33); details are in
Methods and SI Appendix.
For robustness and generalizability, we first analyzed data from a
discovery cohort (n = 100; balanced for age and sex as per the
sample design) and then replicated all of the key findings in a vali-
dation cohort (n = 197). Nonidentifiable data and all analyses codes
are available at the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network Cortical
Myelination Figshare Repository (details are in SI Appendix).
Results
CT and Shrinkage. CT at 14 y of age ranged between 1.93 and
3.8 mm across different cortical areas. Baseline CT was thinnest
in primary somatosensory and visual cortices (Fig. 1A) (34). In
the adolescent period from 14 to 24 y old, there was evidence of
significant cortical shrinkage (r2 = 0.10; P = 0.006; estimated
global rate of shrinkage; ΔCT = −0.011 mm/y) (Fig. 1B). Al-
though 289 of 308 nodes exhibited cortical shrinkage (ΔCT < 0),
only 79 nodes showed shrinkage that was statistically significant
at P < 0.05 after false discovery rate (FDR) correction for
multiple comparisons (Fig. 1C). The regions with the greatest
rates of shrinkage were located in association cortex.
Intracortical MT and Myelination. By combining data from neigh-
boring voxels in each regional node, we could estimate regional MT
for each depth at submillimeter resolution (4), corresponding ap-
proximately to different layers of cortex (Fig. 2A). MT was esti-
mated at 10 fractional depths of the cortical ribbon from the pial
surface (0% depth) to the gray/white matter (GM/WM) boundary
(100% depth) and two infracortical locations 0.4 and 0.8 mm below
the GM/WM boundary. At each cortical depth, we estimated
baseline MT (at age 14 y old) and adolescent change in MT (over
the age range of 14–24 y old). In all regions, as expected, baseline
MT increased monotonically as a function of increasing depth
from the pial surface, reflecting greater density of myelinated
fibers in deeper cortical layers (Fig. 2B and Movie S1). However,
there was marked regional variability (Fig. 1C): areas of primary
sensory cortex had greater MT at age 14 y old than association
cortical areas.
The rate of adolescent change in MT, ΔMT, was greatest when
measured at 70% of the depth of cortex (Fig. 2D and Movie S2)
[i.e., ∼1.9 mm below the pial surface and ∼0.8 mm above the
boundary with white matter; across all cortical regions: r2 = 0.17;
P < 0.001; ΔMT = 4.98 × 10−3 y−1 (Fig. 1D)]. Seventy percent
cortical depth corresponds approximately to the level of lamina V
Fig. 1.
Cortical thickness (CT) and magnetization transfer (MT) maps. At
14 y old, primary somatosensory and visual cortices had (A) thinner cortex
and (C) greater MT than association cortical areas. (F) Baseline CT (millimeters)
and MT (PU) were negatively correlated, confirming that thinner cortex was
more myelinated at 14 y old. Globally, over all 308 regions, (B) CT decreased
linearly with increasing age in the range 14–24 y old, although (E) there
were regional differences in the rate of cortical shrinkage (ΔCT), with sig-
nificantly nonzero rates of shrinkage (permutation test; FDR = 0.05) located
mainly in the association cortex. (D) Globally, MT increased linearly with
increasing age in the range 14–24 y old, although (G) there were regional
differences in the rate of cortical myelination (ΔMT), with significantly
nonzero rates of myelination (permutation test; FDR = 0.05) located mainly
in the association cortex. (H) Rates of change in thickness and MT were
negatively correlated, confirming that more rapidly shrinking areas of cortex
had faster rates of myelination.

 and VI, comprising the internal layer of pyramidal or projection
neurons (Fig. 2C). There was marked regional variability in the
rates of myelination: regions with the greatest rates of myelina-
tion were located in association cortices (Fig. 1G).
In light of these complementary anatomical and developmental
profiles of CT and MT, it is not surprising that there was a strong
negative correlation between baseline CT and MT (r2 = 0.43; P <
0.001; β = −0.120 PU/mm) (Fig. 1F) and a strong negative corre-
lation between rates of cortical shrinkage and intracortical myeli-
nation (r2 = 0.22; P < 0.001; β = −0.126 PU/mm) (Fig. 1H).
Adolescent cortical shrinkage was significantly but not entirely
mediated by age-dependent changes in MT (SI Appendix, Fig. S1E),
indicating that myelination is necessary but not sufficient to account
for cortical shrinkage.
Internal Replication. All of the results reported so far were based on
analysis of the discovery cohort (n = 100; 20 in each of five age bins;
50 females), and all were closely replicated in the validation cohort
(n = 197; ∼40 in each of five age bins; 98 females) (SI Appendix,
Figs. S1 and S2). Because the validation cohort had twice as many
participants, it conferred greater statistical power to test hypotheses.
We henceforth focus on the most precise estimates of CT and MT
(at 70% cortical depth) estimated from the total sample (n = 297;
60 per age bin; 30 females), although all additional analyses were
also reproduced separately for the discovery and validation cohorts
(SI Appendix, Figs. S3 and S4).
Genomic Patterning of Adolescent Cortical Consolidation. To eluci-
date the molecular mechanisms of local change in CT and MT, we
explored the association between these MRI markers and regional
gene expression profiles from human adult brain microarray data-
sets provided by the AIBS (33). For example, baseline MT was
correlated with regional expression of the gene for myelin basic
protein (MBP) across cortex (Fig. 2E), confirming that the MT
signal is indicative of myelin content (22). The association was
strongest at 70% cortical depth (r2 = 0.21; P < 0.001; β = 0.0723) (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3A).
To explore analogous associations between all four cortical
MRI metrics and all 20,737 genes measured in the AIBS
microarrays, at each of 308 regions, we used the multivariate,
dimension-reducing technique of partial least squares (PLS)
(35). This analysis defined a few PLS components, which were
the linear combinations of the weighted gene expression scores
(predictor variables) that were most strongly correlated with one
or more of the MRI markers (response variables; CT at 14 y, MT
at 14 y, ΔCT, and ΔMT).
The top two PLS components explained 28% of the variance in
the MRI response variables (permutation test; P < 0.001). The first
partial least squares component (PLS1) (Fig. 3A) represented a
significant association between a rostrocaudally patterned gene
expression profile and baseline measures of CT and MT at 14 y old
(Fig. 3 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S5). The second independent
partial least squares component (PLS2) (Fig. 3D) represented a
significant association between a dorsoventrally patterned gene
expression profile and measures of adolescent cortical shrinkage
and myelination (Fig. 3 E and F). Dataset S1 has a full list of sig-
nificantly over- or underexpressed genes represented by the first two
PLS components.
Focusing on the gene expression profile defined by PLS2, be-
cause it was specifically associated with adolescent cortical shrink-
age and intracortical myelination, we found that this transcriptional
signature was significantly enriched in genes relating to synaptic
transmission (P < 0.001), regulation of glutamatergic signaling (P <
0.001), and potassium ion channels (P < 0.001) (36) (SI Appendix,
Fig. S3G). We also found that the transcriptional profile associated
with association cortical consolidation was significantly enriched for
an oligodendroglial gene set (P < 0.001) (37) (SI Appendix, Fig.
S3F) as well as a set of genes robustly associated with risk for
schizophrenia, a neurodevelopmental disorder (P < 0.001) (38) (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3G).
Adolescent Cortical Consolidation and the Connectome. We used the
measurements of CT on the total sample to estimate the mean
structural covariance matrix, representing the pairwise correla-
tion of CT between each possible pair of 308 regions. This matrix
was thresholded to construct a binary graph or structural co-
variance network that had a complex topology, consistent with
many prior reports of human anatomical connectomes (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S6) (39).
Globally, the network was small world with hubs (indicated by a
fat-tailed degree distribution), a modular community structure,
and a rich club or core of densely interconnected high-degree
nodes or hubs, which were located primarily in frontal and parietal
association cortices (Fig. 4A and SI Appendix, Fig. S6). At a nodal
level of analysis, high-degree hub nodes also had high closeness
centrality, indicating short path length of connections to other
nodes in the network (Fig. 4B), as well as long physical distance of
connections. Cortical shrinkage was faster for topologically central
hubs with long-distance connections (Fig. 4C) (degree: r2 = 0.14,;
P < 0.001; β = −1.48 × 10−3 mm−1; closeness: r2 = 0.18; P < 0.001;
β = −4.91 mm−1; distance: r2 = 0.09; P < 0.001; β = −0.81 × 10−3).
Intracortical myelination rates were also faster for long-distance
hubs (Fig. 4D) (degree: r2 = 0.07; P < 0.001; β = 3.81 × 103 PU−1;
closeness: r2 = 0.13; P < 0.001; β = 14.8 PU−1; distance: r2 = 0.21;
P < 0.001; β = 4.42 × 103 mm/PU).
We found that degree, closeness, and connection distance were
also positively correlated with the pattern of gene expression asso-
ciated with adolescent change in cortical structure (PLS2; degree:
r2 = 0.21; P < 0.001; β = 178; closeness: r2 = 0.26; P < 0.001; β = 572 ×
10−3; distance: r2 = 0.15; P < 0.001; β = 100 mm) (Fig. 4E). In

 contrast, these metrics were not so strongly correlated with the
pattern of gene expression associated with cortical structure at 14 y
old (PLS1; degree: r2 < 0.01; P = 0.904; β = −2.36; closeness: r2 <
0.01; P = 0.892; β = 9.39 × 10−3; distance: r2 = 0.02; P = 0.02; β =
−35.2 mm).
Discussion
We have shown that adolescent cortical shrinkage is related to
changes in intracortical MT in humans. This observation supports
myelination models of shrinkage and, more generally, confirms
association cortical myelinogenesis as a key neurodevelopmental
process in adolescence. Our baseline MT-based myelination maps
(Figs. 1 and 2) show a high degree of correspondence with previous
myelin maps based on alternative MRI parameters (23, 24, 40–42).
Across modalities, the highest levels of myelin are located in areas
of primary isocortex comprising many large pyramidal cells, which
are the principal targets and sources of axonal projections (43).
However, arguably, the strongest evidence that MT is representative
of myelin content in these data is that MT was highly correlated
with regional expression of the gene for MBP and that the set of
genes most strongly correlated with adolescent change in MT was
significantly enriched for oligodendroglia-related genes.
We interpret our findings as indicating that adolescent cortical
myelination was greatest in association areas, which were least
myelinated at age 14 y old. It is plausible, although not directly
shown by these data, that specialized motor and sensory cortices
may show faster rates of intracortical MT change compared with
association cortex at earlier stages of development. This prediction
would be compatible with the idea, dating back to Flechsig (2), that
association cortical areas are the focus of a relatively late wave of
myelinogenesis. The intracortical location of strongest maturational
changes in MT, corresponding approximately to the boundary be-
tween layers V (internal pyramid) and VI, further suggests that
adolescent intracortical myelination may be concentrated on
the proximal segments of efferent projections from pyramidal
neurons (20).
Although adolescent intracortical myelination was greatest in
areas that showed fastest rates of cortical shrinkage, it did not
entirely explain age-related changes in CT. Likewise, although
the gene expression profile associated with adolescent change
was enriched for genes related to oligodendroglial function, it
was also significantly enriched for neuronal genes, especially
those implicated in remodeling of synapses or transport of glu-
tamate-containing vesicles. Thus, it seems plausible that geneti-
cally programmed processes of synaptic remodeling act together
with locally coupled processes of intracortical myelination to
consolidate synaptic and axonal connectivity of association cor-
tical areas in adolescence. The set of gene transcription markers
most strongly associated with this late maturational process (44)
was enriched for genes known to confer risk for schizophrenia
(38), generating the hypothesis that deviation from the norma-
tive developmental trajectory of cortical hub consolidation could
be an intermediate phenotype underlying the high incidence of
the clinical phenotype of schizophrenia in young people.
However, we note some important caveats that mandate ad-
ditional critical testing of these results and their hypothetical
implications. First, the gene expression profiles used in this
analysis were measured in six postmortem adult brains (mean
age = 43 y old). Brain regional gene expression is known to
change somewhat over the two decades approximately in-
tervening between the oldest subject in the MRI dataset and the
average age of the subjects in the genomic dataset (45). Any such
age-related changes in gene expression will have confounded our
analysis of the association between imaging and genomic vari-
ables. We might expect this age disparity to reduce the statistical
power to detect true MRI/mRNA associations rather than inflate
the probability of false positive associations. Nonetheless, the
genomic analysis of developmental MRI phenotypes would cer-
tainly be stronger in the future if it was informed by age-matched
Fig. 3.
Distinct gene expression profiles were specifically associated with CT and
MT at 14 y old or adolescent processes of cortical consolidation. PLS1 identified a
profile of genes that were (A) overexpressed in occipital and somatosensory
cortices, (B) negatively correlated with baseline CT, and (C) positively correlated
with baseline MT. PLS2 identified a profile of genes that were (D) overexpressed
in prefrontal cortex, (E) negatively correlated with adolescent cortical shrinkage
(ΔCT), and (F) positively correlated with adolescent intracortical myelination
(ΔMT). (G) PLS2 was enriched for genes functionally related to synaptic trans-
mission, glutamatergic signaling, and potassium ion channels (color-coded by
P value for significant enrichment) in the gene ontology of biological processes.

Hubs of the connectome were located in regions with faster rates of
cortical consolidation and associated with the same gene expression profile
as consolidation. The structural covariance network comprised hubs with
(A) high degree centrality and (B) high closeness centrality that were con-
centrated anatomically in association cortical areas; in both A and B, nodes
are colored and sized by the corresponding centrality metric, and square
nodes represent members of the rich club. Both degree (red) and closeness
centrality (green) were (C) negatively correlated with cortical shrinkage
(ΔCT) and (D) positively correlated with adolescent increase in myelination
(ΔMT). (E) The gene expression profile associated with adolescent cortical
consolidation (PLS2 from Fig. 3) was also significantly associated with degree
and closeness centrality.

 regional gene expression profiles (such data are not currently
available). Second, the MRI changes that we have interpreted
developmentally are estimated from cross-sectional data. A
longitudinal design incorporating multiple repeated MRI scans
over time would provide a more secure basis for estimation of
age-related changes attributable to the developmental matura-
tion of individual brains. Third, we have not presented any evi-
dence that people at risk for schizophrenia do, indeed, show
abnormal cortical hub consolidation, although we note that there
is prior evidence for abnormal CT, MT, and cortical shrinkage in
patients with schizophrenia (46, 47). Future longitudinal studies
of network development (and ideally, also gene expression) in
young people genetically or environmentally at risk for schizo-
phrenia will be required to test the pathogenic role of hub
consolidation more definitively.
It is well known that brain networks generally have complex to-
pological properties, including hubs, modules, and rich clubs (39,
48). We replicated these findings by graph theoretical analysis
of structural covariance networks (derived from the CT measure-
ments), showing that topologically central nodes had higher rates of
adolescent shrinkage and myelination and higher levels of gene
expression associated with cortical consolidation. In a sense, this
result is not surprising given our earlier data showing that the
coupled changes in CT and MT were greatest in association cortex
and prior studies showing that network hubs of the structural brain
connectome are disproportionately located in association cortex
(39). It suggests that adolescent cortical consolidation is topologi-
cally targeted to optimize the performance of network hubs. For
example, synaptic remodeling and intracortical myelination of cor-
tical hubs might be expected to minimize the conduction time for
axonal propagation of electrical signals or enhance the synchroni-
zation of oscillations across anatomically distributed cortical areas
(49). These physiological implications of connectome hub consoli-
dation would hypothetically favor more integrative functional net-
work topology and dynamics, which are known to be important for
later-maturing, “higher-order” cognitive functions (50).
We predict that age-related cortical consolidation of human
cortical network hubs will prove to be relevant to the normal ac-
quisition of cognitive and behavioral skills during the adolescent
transition from childhood to adulthood and may also prove to be
implicated in the clinical emergence of neurodevelopmental and
psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, in young people (1, 3).
Methods
Design. In total, 2135 healthy young people in the age range 14–24 y old were
recruited from schools, colleges, National Health Service (NHS) primary care
services, and via direct advertisement in north London and Cambridgeshire.
To populate the (secondary) MRI cohort, 300 participants were subsampled
from the primary cohort (conserving sex and ethnicity balance), with n = 60
in each of five age strata. Additional detail and exclusion criteria are in SI
Appendix. Participants provided informed written consent for each aspect of
the study, and parental consent was obtained for those aged 14–15 y old.
The study was ethically approved by the National Research Ethics Service and
conducted in accordance with NHS research governance standards.
MRI Data Acquisition. All scans were acquired using the MPM sequence (31)
implemented on three identical 3T whole-body MRI systems (Magnetom TIM
Trio; VB17 software version; Siemens Healthcare): two located in Cambridge
and one located in London. Between-site reliability and tolerability of all
MRI procedures were satisfactorily assessed by a pilot study of five healthy
volunteers each scanned for ∼25 min at each site (31). The between-site bias
was less than 3% and the between-site coefficient of variation was less than
8% for both longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) and MT parameters (31). R1
and MT were quantified in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc.) using SPM8 (www.
fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and custom tools; details are in SI Appendix.
Estimation of Regional CT and MT. The cortical surface for each participant was
reconstructed from the R1 image by the following steps: skull stripping (51),
segmentation of cortical gray and white matter (52), separation of the two
hemispheres and subcortical structures (52–54), and finally, construction of a
smooth representation of the gray/white interface and the pial surface
(52). We used FreeSurfer v5.3.0 software to implement these processes
(surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). After quality control, three participants
had to be excluded from the analyses because of movement artifacts, which
prevented accurate surface reconstructions. We used a backtracking algo-
rithm (55) to parcellate 66 regions defined by sulcogyral criteria in the
Desikan–Killiany atlas (56) into 308 contiguous parcels of approximately
equal area (500 mm2) across both hemispheres in standard space (SI Appendix,
Fig. S2A). This parcellation template was then transformed to the native space
of each participant’s image to minimize geometric deformation of the MRI
data and prevent age-related bias (57) before estimation of CT of each region.
To localize cortical myelination at a spatial resolution corresponding approx-
imately to the scale of six lamina of neocortex, at each regional node, we
estimated MT at each of 11 equidistant points on the normal line from the
GM/WM boundary (fractional cortical depth = 100%) to the pial surface (0%).
By measuring MT at depths defined in proportion to CT, we aimed to adjust
the measurements for variation in absolute CT between different regions and
as a function of age. We additionally estimated MT at two locations, consis-
tently defined as 0.4 and 0.8 mm below the GM/WM boundary, to sample the
dense myelination of central white matter as a point of comparison for
intracortical MT (details are in Fig. 2 and SI Appendix).
Gene Expression Dataset. Microarray data for five male and one female do-
nors with a mean age of 42.5 y old were available from the AIBS (33) (human.
brain-map.org). We matched the centroids of the regions of the MRI par-
cellation to the closest regional gene expression profile. Microarray data
were averaged across all samples from all donors in the matching anatomical
region across both hemispheres. The data were also averaged across probes
corresponding to the same gene, excluding probes that were not matched
to gene symbols in the AIBS data. Two MRI regions were excluded, because
both the mean and the range of gene expression values in these regions
were outliers compared with the other cortical regions of interest. The final
output was a matrix of Z-scored expression values for each of 20,737 genes
estimated in 306 MRI regions (details are in SI Appendix). Gene expression
data for individual genes, such as MBP, were obtained from the appropriate
row of this matrix. Similarly, gene expression values for larger gene sets of
interest were extracted from the whole-genome data. These hypothetically
motivated gene sets included 94 genes that were identified as oligoden-
drocyte-specific by Cahoy et al. (37) and 349 protein-coding genes recently
identified as schizophrenia risk genes (38), of which 312 were successfully
matched to genes in the AIBS dataset.
Structural Covariance and Network Analyses. The structural covariance matrix
comprised the pairwise correlations of CT for all possible pairs of regions in the
parcellation template. Binary graphs were constructed to be node-connected,
with a connection density of 10% (39). From this graphical model of the con-
nectome, we estimated two measures of topological centrality at each node:
degree and closeness. These metrics are representative of the more general
concept of nodal centrality, and they are strongly correlated. We also estimated
the connection distance as the mean of the Euclidean distance of all of the
nonzero edges at each node. On average over all nodes, we estimated clustering
and global efficiency and combined these measures of network segregation and
integration, respectively, to estimate the small worldness of the global network
(58). The community structure of the graph was “nearly decomposed” by
maximization of modularity (59) into a set of sparsely interconnected modules or
subgraphs. The core/periphery structure of the graph was defined as a small rich
club or core of highly interconnected hubs embedded in a larger set of more
peripheral nodes. Details are in SI Appendix.
Statistical Analyses. At each regional node, we fitted a simple linear regression
model across all participants to estimate the gradient (ΔCT and ΔMT) and in-
tercept or baseline (CT and MT) for each MRI measurement. For MT, the same
model was fitted separately at each depth level between the pial surface and
0.8 mm below the GM/WM boundary. The null hypothesis of zero age-related
change in ΔCT or ΔMT was tested globally on average over all regions and at
each region individually, controlling the FDR at 5% to correct for multiple
comparisons entailed by regional analysis. PLS regression on the gene expres-
sion matrix was used to identify the linear combinations of genes that best
predicted the response variables (CT, MT, ΔCT, and ΔMT). The statistical sig-
nificance of the goodness of fit of the first two PLS components was tested with
two-tailed α = 0.05 by 1,000 permutations of the response variables. The error
in estimation of the weight of each gene on each PLS component was assessed
by bootstrapping, and the ratio of the weight of each gene to its bootstrap SE
was used to rank the genes according to their contribution to each PLS com-
ponent. We used gene ontology enrichment analysis tools to identify and
summarize annotations corresponding to biological processes that were sig-
nificantly overrepresented (FDR = 5%) (details are in SI Appendix). We

 predicted hypothetically that the transcriptional profile strongly asso-
ciated with adolescent cortical consolidation (PLS2) should be enriched
for genes associated with oligodendroglia (37) or risk for schizophrenia
(38). We tested for significant enrichment by a permutation test of the
normalized bootstrap weight of each gene in PLS1 and PLS2 summed
over all genes in the set.
