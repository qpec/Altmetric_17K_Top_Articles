IMPORTANCE Data are limited regarding the association between CYP2C19 genetic variants
and clinical outcomes of patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack treated
with clopidogrel.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the association between CYP2C19 genetic variants and clinical
outcomes of clopidogrel-treated patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Three CYP2C19 major alleles (*2, *3, *17) were
genotyped among 2933 Chinese patients from 73 sites who were enrolled in the Clopidogrel
in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) randomized
trial conducted from January 2, 2010, to March 20, 2012.
INTERVENTIONS Patients with acute minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in the
trial were randomized to treatment with clopidogrel combined with aspirin or to aspirin alone.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary efficacy outcome was new stroke.
The secondary efficacy outcome was a composite of new composite vascular events
(ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death). Bleeding
was the safety outcome.
RESULTS Among 2933 patients, 1948 (66.4%) were men, with a mean age of 62.4 years.
Overall, 1207 patients (41.2%) were noncarriers and 1726 patients (58.8%) were carriers of
loss-of-function alleles (*2, *3). After day 90 follow-up, clopidogrel-aspirin reduced the rate of
new stroke in the noncarriers but not in the carriers of the loss-of-function alleles (P = .02 for
interaction; events among noncarriers, 41 [6.7%] with clopidogrel-aspirin vs 74 [12.4%] with
aspirin; hazard ratio [HR], 0.51 [95% CI, 0.35-0.75]; events among carriers, 80 [9.4%] with
clopidogrel-aspirin vs 94 [10.8%] with aspirin; HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.26]). Similar
results were observed for the secondary composite efficacy outcome (noncarriers: 41 [6.7%]
with clopidogrel-aspirin vs 75 [12.5%] with aspirin; HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.34-0.74]; carriers: 80
[9.4%] with clopidogrel-aspirin vs 95 [10.9%] with aspirin; HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.68-1.24];
P = .02 for interaction). The effect of treatment assignment on bleeding did not vary
significantly between the carriers and the noncarriers of the loss-of-function alleles (2.3% for
carriers and 2.5% for noncarriers in the clopidogrel-aspirin group vs 1.4% for carriers and 1.7%
for noncarriers in the aspirin only group; P = .78 for interaction).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with minor ischemic stroke or transient
ischemic attack, the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone reduced the
risk of a new stroke only in the subgroup of patients who were not carriers of the CYP2C19
loss-of-function alleles. These findings support a role of CYP2C19 genotype in the efficacy of
this treatment.

T
he Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Non-
disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial
showed that the combination of clopidogrel with aspi-
rin compared with aspirin alone reduced the risk of stroke
among patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor
ischemic stroke who can be treated within 24 hours after the
onset of symptoms.1 Clopidogrel, in combination with aspi-
rin, has become a recommended treatment option for
patients with TIA or acute minor stroke.2,3
Clopidogrel requires conversion to an active metabolite by
hepatic cytochrome p450 (CYP) isoenzymes to exert an anti-
plateleteffect,andpolymorphismsoftheCYP2C19gene(OMIM
124020) have been identified as strong predictors of clopido-
grel nonresponsiveness.4,5 In the clinical setting the associa-
tion between CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles (especially the
most common *2 and *3 variants) and clinical efficacy of clopi-
dogrel has been studied extensively with discordant results.6-8
The CYP2C19 gain-of-function allele (*17) is associated with in-
creased catalytic activity,9 and its influence on clopidogrel
pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes is unclear.10 Very
limiteddataareavailableaddressingtheeffectofCYP2C19vari-
ants on clopidogrel efficacy in stroke, especially in Asian popu-
lations, in which the rates of stroke incidence11 and mortality12
are higher compared with white populations. The prevalence
of CYP2C19 loss-of-function variants is also high in Asian
populations.13
In China, there are approximately 3 million new strokes
every year, and approximately 30% of them are minor ische-
mic strokes.14 TIA is even more common with an estimate
d 23.9 million occurring in 2010, based on a Chinese national
survey.15 Understanding the relationship between CYP2C19
variants and clinical effect of clopidogrel is critically impor-
tant to optimize treatment for patients with minor stroke
or TIA.
In this study, the efficacy and safety of dual therapy of
clopidogrel and aspirin compared with aspirin alone were
examined according to genotype status among patients in
the trial.
Methods
Study Population and Clinical Outcomes
The protocol and data collection were approved by ethics com-
mittees of Beijing Tiantan Hospital and all other study
centers. All participants or representatives provided written
informed consent before being entered into the study. The de-
sign and results of the trial have been published previously.1
In brief, the trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled multicenter trial conducted in China comparing
clopidogrel (loading dose of 300 mg followed by 75 mg daily
for 3 months) plus aspirin (loading dose of 75-300 mg fol-
lowed by 75 mg daily for 21 days) vs aspirin alone (loading dose
of 75-300 mg followed by 75 mg daily for 3 months) among
5170 patients with acute TIA or minor ischemic stroke within
24 hours of symptom onset.
The genetic substudy was prespecified. Seventy-three
sites among 114 in the larger trial had prior experience col-
lecting samples for genetic studies and agreed to participate
in the substudy. A separate consent form was obtained from
patients recruited by these 73 sites. All patients who were
recruited to the parent trial also participated in this genetic
substudy at these sites. The primary efficacy outcome (new
stroke including both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke) in
the current analyses was the same as that in the trial.1 The
secondary efficacy outcome was the composite outcome, a
new clinical vascular event (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic
stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death), and the
safety outcome was any bleeding.1 All reported efficacy and
safety outcomes were confirmed by a central adjudication
committee that was blinded to the study group assignments.
Genotyping
Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for CYP2C19
(National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI]
Genome build 37.1, GenBank NG_008384), including
CYP2C19*2 (681G>A, dbSNP rs4244285), CYP2C19*3
(636G>A, dbSNP rs4986893), and CYP2C19*17 (−806C>T,
dbSNP rs12248560), were genotyped in 3010 participants.
Genotyping of the 3 SNPs was performed using the Seque-
nom MassARRAY iPLEX platform (Sequenom). Details on
genotyping technology are presented in the Supplement. The
call rate was greater than 98.5% for each of the 3 SNPs. Indi-
viduals with complete information for each of the 3 SNPs
were included in the current analyses.
Patients were categorized by CYP2C19 metabolizer status
based on *2, *3, and *17 genotypes using the common con-
sensus star allele nomenclature.16 Patients with at least two
*2 or *3 alleles (*2/*2, *2/*3, or *3/*3) were classified as poor
metabolizers, those with one *2 or *3 allele (*1/*2 or *1/*3)
were classified as intermediate metabolizers, and those with-
out a *2, *3, or *17 allele (*1/*1) were classified as extensive
metabolizers. Individuals carrying at least one *17 allele
(*1/*17 or *17/*17) were classified as ultra-metabolizers.
Because the clinical consequences of one *17 and a loss-of-
function allele (ie, *2 or *3) still remains unclear17; these indi-
viduals (*2/*17 or *3/*17) were classified as unknown
metabolizers.18 Those with at least 1 loss-of-function allele
(*2 or *3) were classified as loss-of-function allele carriers
Key Points
Question Do variations in the CYP2C19 gene, affecting drug
metabolism, modify the benefit of clopidogrel in patients with
minor stroke or transient ischemic attack?
Findings In this preplanned substudy of a randomized clinical trial
that included 2933 adults, clopidogrel in addition to aspirin
reduced the rate of new stroke in noncarriers of the CYP2C19
loss-of-function alleles compared with aspirin alone (6.7% vs
12.4%, a significant difference) but not in carriers (9.4% vs 10.8%,
no significant difference).
Meaning Clopidogrel may not confer additional stroke prevention
compared with aspirin alone for patients with minor stroke and
transient ischemic attack who are carriers of the CYP2C19
loss-of-function alleles.

and those with at least 1 gain-of-function allele (*17) were
classified as gain-of-function allele carriers.
Statistical Analysis
The baseline characteristics of the patients were compared
between treatment groups, with or without genotype data,
and carriers and noncarriers of a CYP2C19 loss-of-function
allele. Proportions were used for categorical variables, and
medians with interquartile ranges were used for continuous
variables. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to
compare group differences for nominal variables, and χ2 tests
for dichotomous variables. Differences in the rate of stroke
(ischemic or hemorrhagic), the secondary composite out-
come, or any bleeding during the 90-day follow-up period
were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression.
Because patients who participated in the current study were
a subset of those in the trial, 2 models were adopted to evalu-
ate whether the estimates would be affected by potential
divergence from the parent study: 1 unadjusted model and 1
adjusted by age, sex, body mass index (BMI; calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared),
previous or current smoker, minor stroke or TIA at random-
ization, time to randomization, and medical history includ-
ing ischemic stroke, TIA, hypertension, diabetes, and hyper-
lipidemia, with pooled study centers (≥20 patients) as a
random effect. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals
are reported. When there were multiple events of the same
type, the time to the first event was used in the model. Data
from patients who had no events during the study were cen-
sored at the time of study termination or nonvascular death.
For each model, the proportional hazards assumption was
assessed by testing the interaction between treatment and
time. Whether the treatment effect differed in certain geno-
type categories was assessed by testing the treatment-
by-genotype interaction effect with the use of Cox models
adjusted by the factors mentioned previously. Similar
approaches were performed in sensitivity analyses for out-
come subtypes, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke,
progressive and recurrent ischemic stroke,19 and subtypes
based on the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment
(TOAST) criteria20 including large artery atherosclerosis,
small vessel occlusion, cardiogenic embolism, and other or
undetermined etiology. Safety outcome subtypes, including
severe, moderate, and mild bleeding, which were defined
according to the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tis-
sue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries
(GUSTO) criteria,1,21 were also examined. All tests were
2-sided, and a P value of .05 was defined to indicate statisti-
cal significance. All statistical analyses were performed with
SAS software (SAS Institute), version 9.4.
Results
Study Patients
A total of 3010 patients participated and 2933 of them were
successfully genotyped for all the 3 SNPs (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). Compared with the trial participants without ge-
netic data, patients included in this study were less likely to
have a history of ischemic stroke, diabetes, and hyperlipid-
emia (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The proportion of patients
with a diagnosis of acute minor stroke rather than TIA, or tak-
ing concomitant antihypertension agents was higher in the
study population compared with the individuals without ge-
netic data.
Among the 2933 participants, 1726 (58.8%) were classi-
fied as CYP2C19 loss-of-function carriers. Patient character-
istics were similar between the carriers and the noncarriers
and between treatment groups within the carriers or the
noncarriers (Table 1). In this genetic substudy population,
new stroke occurred within 90 days in 8.3% (121 of 1463
patients) in the clopidogrel-aspirin group vs 11.4% (168 of
1470 patients) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71
[95% CI, 0.56-0.90]; P = .0045). The benefit of clopidogrel-
aspirin treatment compared with aspirin alone in patients
with genotype data was similar to that in the parent trial
population with respect to new stroke—the primary efficacy
outcome—as well as the composite efficacy outcome. The
rate of any bleeding with clopidogrel-aspirin compared
with aspirin in the genotyped patients was also similar to
that in the total cohort in the parent trial (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).1
Clinical Outcomes
The frequency distribution and rate of new stroke for each
genotype of the three CYP2C19 SNPs are shown in Table 2.
Carriers of the CYP2C19*2 allele were common, accounting
for 52.5% (42.8% for GA and 9.7% for AA genotypes) of the
study population, and 9.0% of the genotyped patients were
*3 carriers (8.9% for GA and 0.1% for AA genotypes). Gain-
of-function allele carriers (CT or TT genotype) were rare in
this population. The event rates for the composite event and
the safety outcome of any bleeding for each genotype of the
three CYP2C19 SNPs are listed in eTable 3 and eTable 4 in the
Supplement, respectively. The minor allele frequencies for
the CYP2C19 *2, *3, and *17 alleles were 31.1%, 4.6%, and
1.0%, respectively.
Event rates for stroke, the composite secondary out-
come, and bleeding varied by treatment assignment and
genotype (Figure 1). Due to the low prevalence of *17 carriers,
the number of patients with ultra or unknown metabolizer
phenotypes was very small in this study population. No
event was observed in the 18 patients with unknown metabo-
lizer phenotype and only 1 ultra metabolizer treated with
aspirin had a new stroke. The hazard ratio for patients with
ultra or unknown metabolizer phenotypes, as well as the
metabolizer phenotype by treatment interaction, were not
estimated.
The effect of clopidogrel-aspirin compared with aspirin
in reducing the rate of stroke was significant in the noncar-
riers but not in the carriers of the loss-of-function alleles
(rate among noncarriers, 6.7% with clopidogrel-aspirin vs
12.4% with aspirin; HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.35-0.75]; rate among
carriers, 9.4% with clopidogrel-aspirin vs 10.8% with aspi-
rin; HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.69-1.26]; P = .02 for interaction).
Similar results were observed for the secondary composite

associated with bleeding in either carriers or noncarriers
and did not differ between the carriers and the noncarriers
(P = .78 for interaction, Table 3). Similar results were

presented. The corresponding cumulative risk curves dem-
onstrated findings consistent with the analyses using Cox
models and showed that most events occurred in the first
few days (Figure 2).
Similar trends were observed for outcome subtypes in-
cluding progressive and recurrent ischemic stroke, large ar-
tery atherosclerosis, and small vessel occlusion as shown in
eTable 5 in the Supplement, and the finding for progressive is-
chemic stroke was statistically significant (P = .04 for inter-
action effect). There were 20 out of 2933 patients who had con-
comitant usage of proton pump inhibitors with high events
rates compared with those without proton pump inhibitor us-
age (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Secondary Analysis
The association between CYP2C19 loss-of-function carrier sta-
tus with the clinical outcomes was tested in patients who re-
ceived clopidogrel-aspirin dual treatment or aspirin only sepa-
rately. The event rates for both stroke and the composite
outcome (rates were same as for stroke) were higher in carri-
ers compared with noncarriers (9.4% for carriers vs 6.7% for
noncarriers; HR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.05-2.13]; P = .047) receiving
clopidogrel-aspirin treatment. No difference in either stroke

Discussion
In this substudy, the CYP2C19 loss-of-function carrier geno-
types were associated with less protection from subsequent
stroke and composite vascular events for patients with acute
minor stroke or TIA treated with clopidogrel and aspirin com-
pared with noncarrier status. The differences in response to
therapy were largely driven by that within the noncarriers.
Increased risk for stroke and composite vascular events was
observed in carriers compared with noncarriers of CYP2C19
loss-of-function alleles in patients treated with clopidogrel-

aspirin. The risk of any bleeding for clopidogrel-aspirin treat-
ment compared with aspirin was not modified by the loss-of-
function genotype.
There are limited data available addressing the associa-
tion of CYP2C19 variants with clopidogrel efficacy in stroke.
Three recent small studies reported an association between
CYP2C19*2 loss-of-function allele and elevated risk of poor
outcome in patients receiving clopidogrel.22-24 In a group of
176 white patients with small subcortical stroke who received
clopidogrel and aspirin, CYP2C19*2 loss-of-function allele
was associated with increased risk of stroke compared with
extensive or ultrarapid (*17) metabolizer phenotypes.23 No
such association was observed in either African American or
Spanish patients. Sun and colleagues24 observed an
increased risk of a composite of vascular events (including
vascular death, nonfatal ischemic stroke, and nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction) during 3-month follow-up in carriers com-
pared with noncarriers of CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3 alleles in
a cohort of 625 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke
receiving clopidogrel. No association between bleeding and
carrier status was observed in either of the 2 studies.23,24 The
results from the clopidogrel-aspirin–treated group support
both of their findings. Jia and colleagues22 and Yang and
colleagues.25 reported an association between CYP2C19
loss-of-function allele (*2 or *3) and elevated adenosine-
diphosphate–induced platelet aggregation in stroke patients
with clopidogrel treatment. Compared with previous studies,
this study population is larger with increased power and pre-
cision. This study included a randomized control group
(patients treated with aspirin only) to evaluate the effect of
genotype status on clopidogrel efficacy whereas the prior
studies were conducted exclusively in patients with clopido-
grel treatment (with or without aspirin). Including a random-
ized control group allowed us to avoid pleiotropic effect-
of-function alleles and other potential confounding.18
The frequency of CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles in
this study was 58.8% (1726 of 2933 patients), similar to that
which has been reported in other East Asian populations,24,26
and higher than that in other populations, where it has ranged
from 18% in Mexicans to 33% in African Americans.13,17,27 This
study provided evidence supporting genetic testing that may
allow clinicians to personalize antiplatelet therapy, espe-
cially in East Asian patient populations for whom the preva-
lence of CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele is high. However,
clopidogrel is currently the only approved antiplatelet agent
adjunct to aspirin after stroke or TIA, so there is no existing
alternative in the acute period. Varying the dose of clopido-
grel or shifting to new antiplatelet agents (eg, prasugrel) based
on genetic results may be alternatives but have not been ad-
equately evaluated.28
There were several limitations in this study. Because the
baseline data were not available for study participants, it was
not possible to assess the effect of stroke mechanisms on the
pharmacogenetic effect of CYP2C19 observed in this study.
Aspirin resistance is well documented.29 Because aspirin
aggregability function was not tested in this study, it remains
possible that more aspirin-resistant patients were randomly
included in the CYP2C19 loss-of-function carriers, and there-
fore influenced the patients’outcomes in this group. The
event rates for bleeding were very low in this population;
therefore the statistic power was limited to detect any asso-
ciation with this safety outcome. In addition, this study was

National Institutes of Health, which is similar to this trial, is
currently enrolling patients at sites primarily in North America
and Europe. The POINT trial is assessing a higher loading dose
of clopidogrel (600 mg) and a narrower time window (treat-
ment within 12 hours after symptom onset).30 It will be im-
portant to compare the association of CYP2C19 variants with
efficacy of clopidogrel in a different population before apply-
ing these results to non-Asian populations, particularly given
the variability in results of cardiovascular studies.
Conclusions
Among patients with minor ischemic stroke or transient is-
chemic attack, the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin compared
with aspirin alone reduced the risk of a new stroke only in the
subgroupofpatientswhowerenotcarriersoftheCYP2C19loss-
of-function alleles. These findings support a role of CYP2C19
genotype in the efficacy of this treatment.
