Disparities for LGBTQ and Gender 
Nonconforming Adolescents
Laura Baams, PhD
OBJECTIVES: To identify patterns of childhood adversity in a sample of adolescents and assess 
disparities in these experiences for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning 
adolescents and by level of gender nonconformity.
METHOD By using the cross-sectional, statewide, anonymous 2016 Minnesota Student Survey, 
81 885 students were included in the current study (50.59% male; mean age = 15.51). 
Participants were enrolled in grades 9 and 11 in a total of 348 schools.
RESULTS: Four patterns of childhood adversity were identified with sex-stratified latent 
class analyses (entropy = 0.833 males; 0.833 females), ranging from relatively low levels of 
abuse (85.3% males; 80.1% females) to polyvictimization (0.84% males; 1.98% females). 
A regression analysis showed that compared with heterosexual adolescents, gay, lesbian, 
bisexual, and questioning adolescents were more likely to be classified into profiles 
characterized by polyvictimization (odds ratio [OR] 1.81–7.53) and psychological and/
or physical abuse (OR 1.29–3.12), than no or low adversity. Similarly, compared with 
nontransgender adolescents, transgender adolescents were more likely to be classified into 
profiles characterized by patterns of polyvictimization (OR 1.49–2.91) and psychological 
and/or physical abuse (OR 1.23–1.96). A higher level of gender nonconformity predicted a 
higher likelihood of being classified into each adversity profile compared with the no or low 
adversity profile (OR 1.14–1.45).
CONCLUSIONS: Sexual minority adolescents and adolescents with high levels of gender 
nonconformity are vulnerable to experience adversity. The disparities for lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, and questioning adolescents and adolescents with high gender 
nonconformity highlight the variation in patterns of childhood adversity that these youth 
are at risk of experiencing. The findings reveal the need for further research on the benefits 
and harm of screening for childhood adversity by physicians and pediatricians.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) and 
gender nonconforming adolescents experience high 
rates of parental abuse and polyvictimization. There is 
currently no knowledge of patterns of adversity for these 
youth. Awareness of patterns of childhood adversity 
could help physicians and pediatricians to monitor these 
experiences.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: LGBTQ adolescents are more 
likely to experience patterns of abuse compared with 
heterosexual adolescents. Adversity among LGBTQ 
adolescents and those with high levels of gender 
nonconformity should be monitored. Primary physicians 
and pediatricians may be first lines of contact.

 Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
and questioning (LGBTQ) adolescents 
and adults and those with high 
levels of gender nonconformity 
show elevated rates of depression 
and suicidality.1 
– 
3 Victimization 
is an important contributor to 
these health disparities.1– 
3 A meta-
analysis has revealed that sexual 
minority individuals (ie, lesbian, 
gay, bisexual, and questioning) 
are up to 3 times more likely to 
experience abuse during childhood.4 
Specific to parents, sexual minority 
individuals are more likely to report 
various forms of parental abuse 
and household dysfunction during 
childhood.5 
– 
9 However, there is 
currently no research in which the 
types of childhood adversity that 
co-occur are examined and whether 
LGBTQ adolescents, and those with 
high gender nonconformity, are 
more likely to experience patterns 
of abuse. This knowledge could aid 
physicians and pediatricians in being 
alerted to these experiences.10 
–12
Parents’ responses to their child’s 
disclosure of their sexual orientation, 
gender identity, or gender expression 
(ie, mannerisms, appearance, 
activity13) can be abusive.4, 
 
9, 
 
14, 
15  
For example, a sibling study16  
in which experiences of sexual 
minority and heterosexual siblings 
were compared revealed that sexual 
minority individuals reported 
more childhood psychological and 
physical abuse; the findings indicate 
that sexual minority youth may be 
“singled out by their parents for 
maltreatment” (p. 483).16 Gender 
nonconforming adolescents also 
experience higher rates of abuse.2, 
 
9, 
17, 
 
18 
 
Because gender expression in 
childhood is associated with sexual 
orientation in adolescence, 
19 early 
gender nonconforming behavior may 
make children targets of abuse before 
a youth’s disclosure or awareness of 
their sexual orientation.
Researchers of adverse childhood 
experiences20 have argued that 
there are certain conditions in 
which children grow up that 
separately and cumulatively create 
an environment that may negatively 
affect children’s development. 
These adverse conditions range 
from household dysfunction, such 
as parental substance abuse and 
domestic violence to childhood abuse 
including psychological, physical, 
and sexual abuse. On average, 
sexual minority adults report more 
adverse childhood experiences than 
heterosexual adults, 
21 
– 
25 and bisexual 
adults are particularly vulnerable to 
these experiences.21, 
 
24
Although experiences of victimization 
are also common among transgender 
adolescents and those with high 
levels of gender nonconformity26 
– 
31 
and research has revealed that the 
more gender nonconforming an 
individual is the more abuse they 
experience, 
26, 
 
28 there is currently 
no research documenting the 
prevalence of childhood adversity for 
transgender adolescents compared 
with nontransgender adolescents or 
for adolescents with high levels of 
gender nonconformity.
Researchers of adverse childhood 
experiences often use a cumulative 
risk approach.20, 
 
32, 
 
33 Although it 
is important to know that sexual 
minority adults are more likely to 
report experience with multiple 
adverse childhood experiences 
(polyvictimization), 
21 
– 
24 it is 
currently unclear what experiences 
are likely to co-occur; some adverse 
experiences may be more likely to 
co-occur than others. Furthermore, it 
is currently unclear whether LGBTQ 
adolescents and adolescents with 
high levels of gender nonconformity 
are more likely to report cumulative 
childhood adversity and certain 
patterns of abuse. A person-centered 
approach enables the identification 
of typologies of childhood adversity, 
answering questions such as the 
following: What types of adversity 
are likely to co-occur? And are 
LGBTQ youth and those with high 
levels of gender nonconformity more 
likely to experience specific patterns 
of adversity?
In the current study, adolescents’ 
sexual orientation, gender identity, 
and gender nonconformity are used 
to predict disparities in cumulative 
childhood adversity, as well as 
patterns of childhood adversity. 
Following previous work, 
21 
– 
24 it is 
hypothesized that LGBTQ adolescents 
and those with relatively high levels 
of gender nonconformity are more 
likely to experience all types of 
childhood adversity compared with 
heterosexual and nontransgender 
adolescents. On the basis of research 
revealing disparities in experiences 
of childhood adversity4, 
 
21, 
 
24 for 
bisexual youth compared with 
lesbian and gay adolescents, bisexual 
adolescents seem to be at risk. High 
rates of victimization and subsequent 
detrimental health outcomes may be 
explained by the finding that bisexual 
youth experience unique stigma, 
often from both heterosexual and 
LGBTQ communities.34 
–36 Disparities 
in childhood adversity are therefore 
expected to be most prominent for 
bisexual adolescents. Because there 
are important differences in the 
number and type of experiences of 
childhood adversity for male and 
female adolescents37, 
 
38 and also 
among LGBTQ adolescents, 
4, 
 
39 all 
analyses are sex stratified.
METHODS
Data Source
The current study includes data 
from the 2016 Minnesota Student 
Survey provided by public school 
students in Minnesota via local 
public school districts (or alternative 
education programs) and managed 
by the Minnesota Student Survey 
Interagency Team 2016.40
Sexual orientation, gender identity, 
and gender nonconformity were 
only assessed in grades 9 and 
11; therefore, grades 5 and 8 
were excluded from the current

Downloaded from 
 analyses. Data from a total of 81 885 
adolescents enrolled in 348 schools 
were included in the current analyses 
with a mean age of 15.51 (SD = 1.13). 
See Table 1 for a full description of 
the sample.
The Minnesota Student Survey is 
administered every 3 years in schools 
throughout the state of Minnesota to 
monitor the health and well-being 
of adolescents. Of the 330 operating 
public school districts that were 
invited to participate in the survey, 
282 (85.5%) participated. Parents 
of students were asked for passive 
consent. Student participation is 
voluntary and anonymous. The 
University of Groningen, Department 
of Pedagogy and Educational 
Sciences' Institutional Review Board 
has deemed this study of secondary 
data to be exempt.
Childhood Adversity
Experiences of lifetime household 
dysfunction and childhood abuse 
were assessed with 8 items, 
previously used as part of the 
adverse childhood experiences scale 
with (young) adult samples24, 
 
41, 
 
42: 
Parent or guardian in prison: “Have 
any of your parents or guardians 
ever been in jail or prison? (Mark all 
that apply), 
” with answer options 
“None of my parents or guardians 
has ever been in jail or prison” (0), 
“Yes, I have a parent or guardian in 
jail or prison right now, 
” and “Yes, 
I have had a parent or guardian in 
jail or prison in the past” (1). Live 
with problem drinker: “Do you live 
with anyone who drinks too much 
alcohol?” Live with drug abuser: “Do 
you live with anyone who uses illegal 
drugs or abuses prescription drugs?” 
Psychological abuse: “Does a parent 
or other adult in your home regularly 
swear at you, insult you or put you 
down?” Physical abuse: “Has a parent 
or other adult in your household ever

 hit, beat, kicked or physically hurt 
you in any way?” Witnessed domestic 
abuse: “Have your parents or other 
adults in your home ever slapped, hit, 
kicked, punched or beat each other 
up?” Sexual abuse by nonfamily: “Has 
any adult or other person outside of 
the family ever touched you sexually 
against your wishes or forced you to 
touch them sexually?” Sexual abuse 
by family member: “Has any older 
or stronger member of your family 
ever touched you or had you touch 
them sexually?” with answer options 
“Yes” (1) and “No” (0). All adversity 
items were summed (ranging from 0 
to 8) to create a score for cumulative 
childhood adversity.
Biological Sex, Gender Identity, 
Gender Nonconformity, and Sexual 
Orientation
In order of presentation in the survey: 
Biological sex was assessed with the 
item “What is your biological sex?” 
with answer options “Male” (1) and 
“Female” (0). Whether adolescents 
identified as transgender was 
assessed with a single item39: “Do 
you consider yourself transgender, 
genderqueer, genderfluid, or unsure 
about your gender identity?” with 
answer options “Yes” (1) and “No” 
(0). Level of gender nonconformity43, 
 
44  
was assessed with a single item: “A 
person’s appearance, style, dress, or 
the way they walk or talk may affect 
how people describe them. How do 
you think other people at school 
would describe you?” Answer options 
ranged from “1 = Very or mostly 
feminine” to “5 = Very or mostly 
masculine.” Scores were recoded 
for males so that higher scores 
indicate higher levels of gender 
nonconformity. Supplemental Table 
6 presents the percentage of gender 
nonconformity scores by sexual 
orientation and gender identity. 
Sexual orientation was assessed with 
a single item: “Which of the following 
best describes you?” with answer 
options “Heterosexual (straight), 
”  
“Bisexual, 
” “Gay or Lesbian, 
” and 
“Not sure (questioning).”
Covariates
Age was included as a continuous 
covariate. Ethnicity was assessed 
with 3 items. Adolescents were 
asked whether they were Hispanic 
or Latino/a, Somali, or Hmong with 
answer options “Yes” (1) and “No” 
(0). Race was assessed with the 
following item: “In addition, what is 
your race? (if more than 1 describes 
you, mark all that apply), 
” with 
answer options American Indian 
or Alaskan Native; Asian American; 
black, African, or African American; 
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific 
Islander; or white. Race and ethnicity 
categories were nonmutually 
exclusive and added to the models. 
Socioeconomic status (SES) was 
assessed with a single item: “Do 
you currently get free or reduced-
price lunch at school?” with answer 
options “Yes” (1) and “No” (0).
Statistical Analyses
Disparities for LGBTQ adolescents, 
and by level of gender 
nonconformity, in cumulative 
childhood adversity were assessed 
with a sex-stratified linear regression 
analysis in Stata 15.0 (adjusted for 
clustering by using svy) by using 
the sum score of experiences with 
childhood adversity as the dependent 
variable and sexual orientation, 
gender identity, and gender 
nonconformity as independent 
variables, controlling for SES, age, 
and race and/or ethnicity.
To assess patterns of childhood 
adversity, latent class analyses 
(LCAs) were conducted with 
solutions ranging from 2 to 7 
latent classes in Mplus version 
7.0, accounting for the nested 
(complex) structure of the data 
(students nested in schools). The LCA 
procedure enables the identification 
of latent classes on the basis of 
manifest variables and is often 
used to identify profiles of risk that 
might benefit from prevention or 
intervention efforts.45 
– 
48 A 3-step 
LCA procedure was used to predict 
class membership. In this approach, 
the uncertainties (ie, measurement 
error) when assessing the most  
likely class memberships and in 
predicting class membership from  
covariates are taken into account.49, 
 
50 
 
In this procedure, the predictors 
(covariates) of class memberships 
are added simultaneously 
(adolescent’s sexual orientation 
and gender identity, gender 
nonconformity, SES, age, and race 
and/or ethnicity). The 3-step LCA 
procedure was conducted for male 
and female adolescents separately.
Four statistics were used to 
determine the best LCA solution: (1) 
Entropy was used to assess how well 
individual cases could be classified, 
with larger values indicating a 
clearer delineation of profiles; (2) the 
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 
was used as a measure of model fit, 
with lower values indicating that an 
estimated model is more likely to be 
the true model; and (3) the Vuong-
Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio 
test (LRT); and (4) the Lo-Mendell-
Rubin Adjusted LRT were used to 
indicate whether a solution with 
k-classes provided a significantly 
better fit to the data than a solution 
with k − 1 classes. A nonsignificant 
P value for these LRTs (P > .05) 
indicates that a solution with 1 
more class is not needed. Finally, the 
interpretability of classes was used to 
evaluate the LCA solutions.
The 3-step LCA procedure 
provides multinomial logistic 
regression analyses comparing 
class membership in 1 class to each 
other, predicted by the covariates. 
Regression coefficients were 
transformed to odds ratios to aid the 
interpretation of results.51

Downloaded from 
 the sum score of experiences  
in a regression analysis reveal 
that both male and female LGBTQ 
adolescents had higher scores of 
cumulative childhood adverse 
experiences; a higher level of 
gender nonconformity was 
associated with a higher score 
of cumulative childhood adverse 
experiences (B’s = 0.17–0.68,  
P’s < .001; see Table 2).
Complex 3-Step LCAs of Childhood 
Adversity
To assess patterns of childhood 
adversity, several LCAs were 
conducted. On the basis of fit 
statistics (see Table 3), the 4-class 
model was determined to be the 
best fitting model for both male 
and female adolescents. The 4-class 
solution had a high entropy and 
relatively low BIC among both 
males and females. Table 4 includes 
descriptive information of each class. 
The first class is labeled “No/low 
adversity” because of the relatively 
low probabilities of adversity for 
both male and female adolescents. 
Despite there being a sizable group 
of adolescents (n = 49 932) who 
reported not experiencing any of the 
adverse events, these adolescents 
were grouped together with 
adolescents who reported a relatively 
low number of adverse events. The 
second class is labeled “Household 
dysfunction, 
” with relatively 
high probabilities of household 
dysfunction and relatively low 
probabilities of abuse for both male 
and female adolescents. The third 
class is labeled “Polyvictimization” 
and characterized by relatively 
high probabilities for all adverse 
experiences among both male and 
female adolescents. The fourth 
class is labeled “Psychological, 
physical abuse, 
” with relatively 
low probabilities of household 
dysfunction and sexual abuse, but 
relatively high probabilities of 
psychological and physical abuse for 
both male and female adolescents.
Predicting Childhood Adversity 
Typologies
Whether LGBTQ adolescents were 
more likely to be classified into 1 of 
the adversity classes (compared with 
the “No/low adversity” class) was 
assessed with a multinomial logistic 
regression analysis in a 3-step LCA 
procedure, as well as the association 
between gender nonconformity 
and the classification into 1 of the 
adversity classes (see Table 5).
Biological Male Adolescents
Compared with heterosexual 
adolescents, gay or lesbian and 
bisexual adolescents were more 
likely to be classified into each 
adversity profile compared with 
the “No/low adversity” profile. 
Questioning adolescents were 
more likely to be classified into the 
“Polyvictimization” profile and the 
“Psychological/physical abuse” 
profile but not the “Household 
dysfunction” profile. Compared 
with nontransgender adolescents, 
transgender adolescents were more 
likely to be classified into each 
adversity profile compared with the 
“No/low adversity” profile. Last, a 
higher level of gender nonconformity 
was related to a higher likelihood of 
being classified into each adversity 
profile, compared with the “No/low 
adversity” profile.
Biological Female Adolescents
Compared with heterosexual 
adolescents, gay or lesbian, 
bisexual, and questioning 
adolescents were more likely 
to be classified into the 
“Polyvictimization” profile, the 
“Psychological/physical abuse”

the “No/low adversity” profile. 
Compared with nontransgender 
adolescents, transgender 
adolescents were more likely to 
be classified into each adversity 
profile compared with the “No/low 
adversity” profile. Last, a higher 
level of gender nonconformity was 
related to a higher likelihood of 
being classified into each adversity 
profile compared with the “No/low

DISCUSSION
There were 2 aims in the current 
study: (1) to identify patterns 
in childhood adversity in a large 
statewide sample of adolescents 
and (2) to assess disparities for 
LGBTQ adolescents and those 
with a high level of gender 
nonconformity in cumulative 
as well as patterns of childhood 
adversity. Corroborating previous 
work among adults, 
21 
– 
24 the findings 
reveal that LGBTQ adolescents 
and those with relatively high 
levels of gender nonconformity 
reported more (cumulative) types of 
childhood adversity compared with 
heterosexual and nontransgender 
adolescents. The current study is 
unique in that patterns of childhood 
adversity and disparities for LGBTQ 
adolescents were identified, and 
by level of gender nonconformity. 
The current findings point to 4 
distinct groups of adolescents who 
have experience with different 
sets of adverse experiences: the 
largest group of adolescents 
reported relatively low levels of 
childhood adversity, whereas 
smaller groups reported high 
levels of household dysfunction, 
psychological and physical abuse, 
and polyvictimization. All groups 
were compared with the “relatively 
low adversity” group, and findings 
reveal that LGBTQ adolescents and 
those with relatively high levels of 
gender nonconformity were more 
likely to experience most patterns of 
abuse. Disparities were particularly 
pronounced for bisexual adolescents 
and those with high levels of gender 
nonconformity. Although small in 
size, the group that experienced 
polyvictimization (0.84% of 
male subjects, 1.98% of female 
subjects) represents adolescents 
who experienced significant 
adversity. Youth who experience 
polyvictimization have the greatest 
risk for negative outcomes, such 
as poor mental health.52 
– 
54 Thus, 
the finding that LGBTQ adolescents 
and those with relatively high 
levels of gender nonconformity 
are more likely to experience 
polyvictimization is relevant in the 
context of the high risk for mental 
health problems among these 
youth.3, 
 
55
Findings for transgender adolescents 
need to be considered in the context 
of “biological sex”–stratified 
analyses. The results reveal that 
adolescents who identified as 
transgender were more likely 
to experience multiple types of 
childhood adversity (household 
dysfunction, psychological 
and/or physical abuse, and 
polyvictimization). These disparities 
were more pronounced in “biological 
male” transgender adolescents. 
Unfortunately, from the current 
data, adolescents’ gender identity 
cannot be inferred; therefore, we 
cannot directly interpret this finding 
as a difference between transgender 
men and transgender women or 
transmasculine and transfeminine 
adolescents.
The models testing disparities all 
included gender nonconformity. 
Although gender nonconformity is, 
in general, confounded with sexual 
orientation and gender identity, 
2, 
 
19 a 
higher level of gender nonconformity 
was found to predict all patterns of 
childhood adversity. The inclusion

Downloaded from 
 same time allows for the inspection 
of disparities for sexual minority 
adolescents while controlling for 
gender nonconformity. This may 
be important because researchers 
have previously suggested sexual 
orientation disparities may be 
explained by adolescent’s gender 
expression, 
16, 
 
21, 
22 assuming that 
parents may be abusive to censor 
or control the gender expression 
of their child.56, 
 
57 The current 
findings reveal that controlling for 
adolescents’ gender expression 
or identity, sexual minority youth 
are at increased risk of childhood 
adversity. Thus, adolescents’ self-
reported gender expression is not the 
only explanation for the disparities 
found among sexual minority 
adolescents. Additional research on 
parental rejection and responses 
to adolescent’s sexual orientation 
and gender expression is needed to 
examine different developmental 
pathways of adversity.
Although previous research has 
revealed disparities in household 
dysfunction for sexual minority 
individuals, 
21, 
 
22 it is currently 
unclear why LGBTQ adolescents 
or those with high levels of gender 
nonconformity would be more likely 
to have, for example, a parent who 
has been incarcerated or abuses 
drugs. However, in contrast to 
previous work, the current study 
identified patterns of childhood 
adversity. The analyses identified 
only 1 pattern of adversity that was 
distinct in its high level of household 
dysfunction, and disparities for 
LGBTQ adolescents and those with 
high levels of gender nonconformity 
were not as pronounced as they were 
for the other adversity profiles.
In the current study, a contemporary 
adolescent sample is used to 
examine disparities for LGBTQ 
adolescents and those with high 
levels of gender nonconformity 
in childhood adversity. There are 
several limitations of the study and 
data to note. First, the current data 
are cross-sectional; this does not 
allow for the testing of effects of 
childhood adversity or explanatory 
models. These pathways could be 
tested with a longitudinal study. 
Second, the questions pertaining 
to childhood adversity do not ask 
when these adverse childhood 
experiences occurred. Especially for 
LGBTQ adolescents and those with 
high gender nonconformity, it may 
be relevant to ascertain when the 
adverse experience occurred and 
whether adolescents interpret these 
experiences to be related to their 
sexual orientation, gender identity, or 
gender expression. Third, as the data 
used in the current study are from a 
school-based sample, findings cannot 
be generalized to adolescents who do 
not attend school. Because unstably 
housed adolescents are more likely  
to experience abuse58, 
 
59 and are  
more likely to identify as LGBTQ, 
60  
the current findings are likely an 
underestimation of the occurrence 
of childhood adversity among 
LGBTQ and gender nonconforming 
adolescents. Last, the current study 
includes adolescents from the state 
of Minnesota. Despite the size of 
the sample, current findings cannot 
be generalized to other geographic 
locations.
CONCLUSIONS
Although this study was not designed 
to estimate the prevalence of 
adversity, this large statewide survey 
does indicate how common these 
experiences are. The findings are not 
only evidence of the poor conditions 
in which many LGBTQ adolescents 
and those with high gender 
nonconformity grow up, the findings 
are also relevant for pediatricians 
and primary care physicians who are 
often the first to see these youth in 
their practices.10
From assessing these disparities 
it becomes clear that LGBTQ 
adolescents and those who are gender 
nonconforming are at increased 
risk for past or current experiences 
of abuse and at risk for developing 
health problems later in life because 
of these experiences.22

Downloaded from 
 research on disparities for LGBTQ 
adolescents, and those with high 
gender nonconformity, as well as 
mechanisms that explain parental 
rejection of their child’s sexual 
orientation or gender expression 
and identity is needed. In addition, 
research into the harm and benefit of 
screening for family violence, child 
maltreatment, and child abuse is 
needed to design risk assessments 
and interventions that are effective 
and acknowledge the co-occurrence of 
adverse experiences.61
