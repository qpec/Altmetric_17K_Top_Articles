Background. Connected health devices with lifestyle coaching can provide real-time support for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
However, the intensity of lifestyle coaching needed to achieve outcomes is unknown. Methods. Livongo provides connected, two-way
messaging glucose meters, unlimited blood glucose (BG) test strips, and access to certified diabetes educators. We evaluated the
incremental effects of adding lifestyle coaching on BG, estimated HbA1c, and weight. We randomized 330 eligible adults (T2D,
HbA1c > 7.5%, BMI ≥ 25) to receive no further intervention (n = 75), a connected scale (n = 115), scale plus lightweight
coaching (n = 73), or scale plus intense coaching (n = 67) for 12 weeks. We evaluated the change in outcomes using ANOVA.
Results. Livongo participation alone resulted in improved BG control (mean HbA1c declined: 8.5% to 7.5%, p = 0 01). Mean
weight loss and additional BG decreases were higher in the intensive compared with the lightweight coaching and scale-only
groups (weight change (lb): −6.4, −4.1, and −1.1, resp., p = 0 01; BG change (mg/dL): −19.4, −11.3, and −2.9, resp., p = 0 02).
The estimated 12-week program costs were 5.5 times more for intensive than lightweight coaching. Conclusion. Livongo
participation significantly improves BG control in people with T2D. Additional lifestyle coaching may be a cost-effective
intervention to achieve further glucose control and weight loss.
1. Background
In the USA, 1 in 11 people have diabetes, costing the health-
care system over $150 billion annually [1–3]. For these
patients, maintaining blood glucose in the normal range
(80–180 mg/dL) [4] is a critical part of reducing emergency
department visits, hospitalizations, renal failure, and other
costly complications of diabetes [5, 6]. Wirelessly connected
glucose meters combined with certified diabetes educator
(CDE) support for managing daily fluctuations in blood
glucose (e.g., Livongo for diabetes program) have demon-
strated sustained improvement in glucose control by reduc-
ing HbA1c by 0.9% for up to 12 months [7]. However, not
all patients achieve goal glucose control with this type of
support alone and many patients with T2D find weight loss
in the setting of insulin and other glucose-lowering medica-
tions to be difficult.
Lifestyle coaching through the National Diabetes Preven-
tion Program is increasingly recommended to help patients
with prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome change their
diets, increase physical activity, improve coping skills, and
adopt
other
key
behaviors
associated
with metabolic
improvements and long-term outcomes [8, 9]. To our knowl-
edge, there has been no published evaluation of effects of life-
style coaching for people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in
the setting of a connected glucose meter and CDE support.

 Large healthcare provider systems such as Sutter Health
and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have made
enormous investments in coaching and other educational
programs for patients with diabetes. The VHA, for example,
has grown its telehealth and remote patient monitoring from
an initial program of 2000 patients in 2003 to over 150,000 in
2012 [10]. Patients with diabetes represent the largest popu-
lation of veterans served through these programs, accounting
for 48% of telehealth/remote monitoring visits per year. The
annual cost to deploy these programs is $1600 per patient per
year—which represents a considerable investment but one
that is associated with a 20% reduction in hospital admis-
sions related to diabetes [10] and is much lower than histor-
ical alternatives (e.g., over $13,000 per patient per year for
traditional home-based care).
Increasingly, self-insured employers are investing in sim-
ilar programs for their employees with diabetes [11]. Highly
customized programs that are able to personalize outreach
to target populations, match the intensity of support to the
need of the employees, and optimize individuals’ blood glu-
cose readings and overall metabolic control are more likely
to be cost-effective than with intensive programs deployed
to a broad population.
We evaluated the effects of adding lifestyle modification
coaching for a population of people with type 2 diabetes
enrolled in a program supported by connected glucose meters
andCDEswhohadnotyetachievedtheirglycemiccontroland
weight goals. We hypothesized that intensive lifestyle coach-
ing would be associated with greater improvements in glyce-
mic control and weight loss than either lightweight coaching,
scale-only or no further intervention. Secondarily, we investi-
gated which patient characteristics are associated with the
greatest engagement with the lifestyle coaching program.
2. Methods
2.1. Interventions
2.1.1. Livongo Diabetes Program. The Livongo for the diabetes
program offers participants (1) a connected two-way messag-
ing device that measures blood glucose, centrally stores the
glucose data and other contextual data (e.g., time of day, rela-
tionship to a meal, insulin dose, and carbohydrates eaten), and
delivers relevant messages back to the patient; (2) unlimited
glucose test strips; and (3) access to a team of CDEs who are
available to answer patient questions, help with goal setting,
and provide immediate support in the setting of extreme glu-
cose excursions. The Livongo program was provided to par-
ticipants by their employer or health plan at no cost to the
participant.
Algorithmic-driven messages are sent through the
Livongo meter in response to each BG reading. For example,
if the BG value is <50 mg/dL, the message on the BG meter
could read “Your reading is very low, drink 4 oz of juice or take
4 glucose tabs and check BG again in 15 minutes”. If the BG
value is >400 mg/dL, the message could read “Drink a glass
of water, take medication as prescribed and check BG again
in 30 minutes”. When a patient has a BG value of >400 mg/
dL or <50 mg/dL or when the BG value is outside the specific
threshold the patient sets, an alert is sent to a Livongo CDE
who then contacts the patient to ensure the patient’s safety
and discuss an appropriate action based on the BG value.
Twenty-seven percent of Livongo patients have been con-
tacted at least once by a CDE on the basis of an alert BG value.
Livongo patients can also schedule 1 : 1 telephonic sessions
with CDEs for goal setting, personalized feedback, and diabe-
tes education.
2.1.2. Restore Health Lifestyle Modification Program. The two
12-week lifestyle coaching interventions evaluated in this
study were provided by Restore Health (Palo Alto, California)
between May and September 2016. Lifestyle modification
focused on the four key factors that drive insulin resistance:
nutrition, exercise, sleep, and stress. While these topics are
addressed according to the AADE7 Self-Care Behavior guide-
lines followed by Livongo CDEs, the Restore Health nutri-
tional approach recommends a specific diet that is lower in
carbohydrates, especially refined carbohydrates and sugar,
moderate in protein, and unrestricted in healthy fats. There
is no calorie restriction or macronutrient counting involved.
Meals were photographed by participants and rated by
Restore Health coaches using emojis they texted suggestions
to provide real-time feedback to participants. Participants in
the intensive coaching arm received a 60-minute onboarding
call covering numerous lifestyle-related topics and goal set-
ting and customized lessons as well as daily personalized text
messages, personalized meal ratings, and activity recommen-
dations. Participants in the lightweight coaching arm received
a 20-minute onboarding call, standardized lessons and tem-
plated text message support, meal ratings, and activity
recommendations.
2.1.3. Connected Scale. We provided a connected scale
(BodyTrace Inc.) to participants in the three intervention
arms of this study but not the control/Livongo-only group.
Participants were allowed to keep the scale after the pilot pro-
gram finished. For participants in the control/Livongo-only
group, preintervention height and weight were obtained by
self-report but no weight values were obtained at the end of
the intervention period.
2.2. Study Design. 1936 adults (age ≥21 years) with type 2
diabetes who had been in the Livongo program (between
October 1, 2014, and February 26, 2016) for at least 80 days,
were overweight (BMI ≥25) and had not yet achieved their
target glucose control (i.e., estimated HbA1c < 7.0%) were
invited to participate in the study. Of these, 454 subjects
agreed to participate and were randomized to one of the
four intervention groups. 330 subjects provided sufficient
data for analysis: (1) Livongo program with no additional
support (control group, N = 75), (2) Livongo program plus a
connected scale (N = 115), (3) Livongo program plus a con-
nected scale and 12 weeks of lightweight lifestyle coaching
(N = 73), or (4) Livongo program plus a connected scale and
12 weeks of intensive lifestyle coaching (N = 67).
We collected demographic data (e.g., gender and age),
weight, height, and diabetes information (e.g., diabetes type,
insulin use, and most recent HbA1c) from participants.

Journal of Diabetes Research
 Blood glucose data were collected directly from members
through their connected Livongo blood glucose meter.
Weight data were collected through a connected scale for
all participants who were given a scale and by self-report
for participants in the control arm. All participants used the
same version of the glucose meter, and no significant device
or algorithmic changes were made during the study period.
No specific guidelines about blood glucose testing frequency
were given to participants; rather, they were instructed to fol-
low their healthcare providers’ advice. This protocol (LDR-
2016) received IRB approval from Aspire Independent
Review Board (Santee, CA).
2.3. Outcome Measures and Statistical Methods. We per-
formed ANOVA to assess the extent of group assignment
on the key outcomes of interest. We performed logistic
regression to evaluate the characteristics of individuals with
significant improvements in mean blood glucose, estimated
HbA1c, and weight. We conducted all statistical analyses in
R [12].
2.3.1. Estimated HbA1c. We used a linear model published
from the ADAG study [13] to convert the mean blood glu-
cose over 90 days to estimate HbA1c for participants prior
to and after the intervention period. The mean blood glucose
values prior to the intervention were calculated by taking the
average of the blood glucose levels 30 days prior to the partic-
ipant’s enrollment in the study. Similarly, the blood glucose
levels from the last 30 days of the study were used as the
post-intervention mean blood glucose levels. When there
was more than 1 blood glucose value on a given day, the aver-
age was taken to be the blood glucose for that day.

 2.3.2. Weight Data from Connected Scales. 9182 weight values
were received from 230 participants. Participants who trans-
mitted fewer than two weight values over the intervention
period were excluded from analyses (number of participants
removed =8). We took several steps to assure that data
received from connected scales were from the study partici-
pant and not another household member. First, transmitted
weights at program initiation were compared to self-
reported weights to determine a reference starting weight.
Second, transmitted weight values more than 20% off of the
participant’s median weight were excluded (number of
weights removed = 436, number of participants removed =1).
Third, if a weight change greater than 3% occurred over one
day, transmitted weight values were excluded (number of
weights removed = 184). Thus, a total of 8554 weight values
from 221 participants were used in the analyses. Sample
weight values transmitted from a single scale are shown in
Supplementary Figure 1.
2.3.3. Engagement. Program engagement in the lifestyle
coaching intervention groups was assessed subjectively by
coaches (i.e., “engaged” or “not engaged”) based on pro-
gram participation, frequency of meal ratings, logged
activity level, and sleep. The engagement was quantita-
tively assessed by the frequency of conversations recorded
between coaches and participants.
Diabetes empowerment was evaluated using the Diabetes
Empowerment Scale (DES), an eight-item measure of the
self-efficacy of people with diabetes, prior to Livongo enroll-
ment and during month 6 of the program [14]. A higher
value indicates more positive feelings of empowerment
regarding diabetes management.
3. Results
Table 1 presents the demographic data for the 330 partici-
pants. Baseline characteristics among groups were similar
except that the participants randomized to the lightweight
coaching intervention were significantly less likely to be on
insulin than control participants (p = 0 007).
Figure 1 presents the change in glucose control for all
participants. Livongo participation resulted in significantly
improved BG control with a mean estimated HbA1c decrease
from 8.5% to 7.5% (p = 0 01) across all groups prior to the
Restore Health lifestyle modification intervention. Table 2
presents the change in the key weight and glucose control
outcomes for participants in the control and intervention
arms. Both coaching arms had statistically significant
improvements in weight and additional mean blood glu-
cose compared with the Livongo only and the Livongo
plus scale groups. The mean weight loss was greatest in
the intensive coaching group (−6.4 ±9.7 lb) compared to
the lightweight coaching (−4.1 ± 9.4 lb) and the Livongo
plus scale-only groups (−1.1 ±13.7 lb) (p = 0 005 for inten-
sive coaching compared to scale-only). The additional mean
improvement in blood glucose was highest in the intensive

Figure 3: Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES-SF). The DES-SF asks respondents on a 5-point scale how much they agree with eight
statements related how they feel they are coping with diabetes (strongly disagree = 1, strongly agree = 5). Higher scores are associated with
greater empowerment. Individual intervention groups did not vary significantly from each other, however the overall mean DES-SF score

 with improved blood glucose control at the end of the inter-
vention (177 ±52 mg/dL versus 139 ±26 mg/dL, p = 0 001).
Age, gender, race/ethnicity, and insulin use were not associ-
ated with improvements in mean blood glucose.
Within each of the coaching groups, participants deemed
subjectively “engaged” by Restore Health coaches had a signif-
icantly higher number of coach interactions with their Restore
Health coaches and the number of coach interactions was
associated with positive outcomes as shown in Figure 2. The
mean number of coach interactions over the 12-week pro-
gram for the intense coaching group was 44 (range 5–136)
compared to 8 (range 1–32) for the lightweight coaching
group. The number of coach interactions was strongly cor-
related with weight loss in the intensive coaching group
(Pearson’s r = −0 36, p = 0 003) and to a lesser degree in
the lightweight group (Pearson’s r = −0 22, p = 0 11), but
it was not significantly correlated with a change in BG.
Diabetes empowerment as measured by the DES-SF
instrument improved for all participants from a mean value
of 3.4 at baseline to 4.1 at 6 months. Areas of the biggest
improvement were related to participants’ motivation for
caring for their diabetes and positive coping strategies. No
statistically significant differences between groups were noted
as shown in Figure 3.
The incremental cost differences between the two coach-
ing intervention arms were assumed to be related primarily
to the coaching time as the fixed costs for the two programs
were otherwise the same (i.e., lesson creation, platform for
tracking progress towards goals, and connected scale). We
further assumed that coaching costs were a function of esti-
mated coach time per text (3 minutes), cost of coaching time
($0.60 per minute) based on $43,500 salary per year [15],
15% fringe benefits, and 70% work hours (40 per week) spent
coaching. The mean number of text messages exchanged
between coaches and participants was 44 for the intensive
coaching group, 8 for the lightweight coaching group, and 0
for the scale-only group.
Based on these assumptions, the 12-week incremental
costs above the Livongo program were $92 for the scale-only
group, $120 for the scale plus lightweight coaching, and $240
for the scale plus intensive coaching. This translates into $84,
$29, and $38 per pound lost; $31.72, $10.62, and $12.37 per
mean change in 1 mg/dL of BG; and $230, $300, and $329 per
1% decrease in estimated HbA1c for the scale-only, the light-
weight, and the intensive coaching intervention groups,
respectively. Though the overall intervention effect size was
greatest in the intensive coaching arm, lightweight coaching
wasmorecost-effectiveforweightlossandchangeinmeanBG.
Based on literature estimates of cost savings attributable
to HbA1c reduction ranging from $113 to $179 per member
per month [16], lifestyle coaching may be a cost-effective
adjunctive therapy for reaching target glucose control for
selected participants.
4. Discussion
This study has four key findings: first, participation in the
Livongo Diabetes program resulted in significant improve-
ment in blood glucose control. For many participants, this
program alone is sufficient to achieve desired blood glucose
control [7].
Second, among those participants who did not achieve
their goal HbA1c through the Livongo program alone, weight
loss and glucose control were only significantly greater in the
intensive lifestyle coaching group compared to the other
groups. The intensive program resulted in better, but nonsta-
tistically significant, outcomes than lightweight coaching.
Future studies should be directed to understanding the key
components of the lifestyle coaching program most associ-
ated with the outcomes of interest to further reduce costs
while maintaining effectiveness.
Third, those participants with the greatest improvements
in glucose control at the end of the intervention had
higher preintervention mean blood glucose levels. This
key insight can enable risk stratification of patients entering
a program like Livongo to identify the population who might
require adjunctive lifestyle counseling to achieve their glu-
cose control goals. By selectively offering lifestyle coaching
to this group, the more expensive intervention can be
applied to those participants likely to receive the greatest
benefit from it.
Finally, all groups experienced an improvement in their
sense of empowerment and well-being about managing their
diabetes. We attribute this to the personalized digital and
telephonic diabetes advice available to all participants
through the Livongo-certified diabetes educators.
The limitations of this study include that glucose con-
trol at the end of the intervention was calculated from
daily blood glucose values rather than measured by labora-
tory HbA1c. Notably, estimated HbA1c values have been
previously demonstrated to be highly correlated with
directly measured HbA1c values [13]. Additionally, the
population that had the greatest improvement in glucose
control may have received additional outside interventions
by their primary care and other health care providers that
could have contributed to this finding. We did not find
significant differences in the frequency of interaction with
Livongo coaches either through alerts or scheduled coach-
ing between the groups, but other unmeasured interven-
tions may have occurred.
Future research should be directed at understanding
the key elements of the intensive lifestyle coaching pro-
gram most associated with improvements in weight and
glucose control so that those elements can be provided
in the most cost-effective means possible to the T2D pop-
ulation most likely to benefit from them.
