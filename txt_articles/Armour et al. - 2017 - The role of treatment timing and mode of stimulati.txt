Abstract
Objectives
We examined the effect of changing treatment timing and the use of manual, electro acu-
puncture on the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea.
Methods
A randomised controlled trial was performed with four arms, low frequency manual acupunc-
ture (LF-MA), high frequency manual acupuncture (HF-MA), low frequency electro acupunc-
ture (LF-EA) and high frequency electro acupuncture (HF-EA). A manualised trial protocol
was used to allow differentiation and individualized treatment over three months. A total of
74 women were randomly assigned to one of the four groups (LF-MA n = 19, HF-MA n = 18,
LF-EA n = 18, HF-EA n = 19). Twelve treatments were performed over three menstrual
cycles, either once per week (LF groups) or three times in the week prior to menses (HF
groups). All groups received a treatment in the first 48 hours of menses. The primary out-
come was the reduction in peak menstrual pain at 12 months from trial entry.
Results
During the treatment period and nine month follow-up all groups showed statistically sig-
nificant (p < .001) reductions in peak and average menstrual pain compared to baseline
but there were no differences between groups (p > 0.05). Health related quality of life
increased significantly in six domains in groups having high frequency of treatment com-
pared to two domains in low frequency groups. Manual acupuncture groups required
less analgesic medication than electro-acupuncture groups (p = 0.02). HF-MA was most
effective in reducing secondary menstrual symptoms compared to both–EA groups
(p<0.05).

 Conclusion
Acupuncture treatment reduced menstrual pain intensity and duration after three months of
treatment and this was sustained for up to one year after trial entry. The effect of changing
mode of stimulation or frequency of treatment on menstrual pain was not significant. This
may be due to a lack of power. The role of acupuncture stimulation on menstrual pain needs
to be investigated in appropriately powered randomised controlled trials.
Introduction
Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as menstrual pain in the absence of any organic cause and is
most common in women under the age of 25. Primary dysmenorrhea’s characteristic symptom is
crampy, colicky spasms of pain in the suprapubic area, occurring within 8–72 hours of menstrua-
tion and peaking within the first few days as menstrual flow increases[1]. In addition to painful
cramps, many women with primary dysmenorrhea experience other menstrual-related symp-
toms, including back and thigh pain, headaches, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting[1]. Pain com-
monly starts within three years of menarche[2] and results in life time world-wide prevalence
rates ranging from 17–81%[3] with 71% of Australian women suffering from dysmenorrhea in a
given year[4]. Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common cause for school absenteeism in
women [5] and in 10–30% of women causes regular absence from work, school or university
each month [6, 7]. In addition to absenteeism primary dysmenorrhea causes a reduction in aca-
demic performance [8, 9], reduced participation in sport and social activities[8] and an overall
significant decrease in women’s quality of life [9, 10]. Despite the significant negative impact and
disruption to daily living that primary dysmenorrhea has on women most do not seek medical
treatment [11, 12].When women do present to their doctor with primary dysmenorrhea, the
most commonly prescribed treatments are non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) and the
combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill. These treatments are effective for many women [2, 13],
however approximately 25% of women have pain that is refractory to either or both of these stan-
dard treatments[14].
Lack of satisfaction in standard treatment leads to an increase in self-care [15, 16], with
women commonly using complementary therapies to deal with their menstrual pain[17] in
addition to, or instead of, pharmaceutical pain relief, due to a lack of perceived effectiveness
[15, 18, 19] or a dislike of using analgesic medication[20]. Surveys of practice show women are
presenting to acupuncturists in the community with gynaecological complaints such as pri-
mary dysmenorrhea [21] despite the evidence for acupuncture’s effectiveness in treating pri-
mary dysmenorrhea being uncertain[22]. Many clinical trials are characterised as having a
high risk of bias or a lack of clinical validity due to a significant departure from how acupunc-
ture is delivered in contemporary clinical practice.
Despite the lack of high quality evidence there are plausible mechanisms of action for acu-
puncture to improve primary dysmenorrhea, including endogenous opioid release[23], reduc-
tion of inflammation [24], alterations in uterine blood flow[25] and changes in prostaglandin
levels [26]. Acupuncture appears to show a dose response relationship between various nee-
dling parameters and pain [27]. There is some evidence that electro-acupuncture provides a
more rapid reduction in menstrual pain compared to manual acupuncture; however this find-
ing was based on a single study that used an uncommon style of indwelling acupuncture
administered only during menses and assessed using non-validated outcome measures [28].
The timing of treatment around menses has been examined in two studies [29, 30] which

 suggested that treatment three to seven days prior to menses was more effective than treatment
during menses. No previous trials have directly investigated the possible dose response rela-
tionship that appears to be present between the use of electro-acupuncture and manual acu-
puncture or in changing frequency of treatment in a western clinical setting where use of
manual acupuncture delivered once per week is more common.
This exploratory study aims to examine the possible impact of changing the mode of acu-
puncture stimulation and treatment timing on menstrual pain. We hypothesised that both
electro-acupuncture and higher frequency of treatment would deliver greater reductions in
menstrual pain and greater improvements in health-related quality of life compared to lower
frequency or manual acupuncture.
Materials and methods
Study design
An exploratory study using a 2x2 factorial design, to test the individual and combined effects
of changing 1) treatment timing, and 2) mode of stimulation. This study used a pragmatic clin-
ical trial design with some qualifications, including the use of a manualised acupuncture proto-
col designed to reduce the amount of variation between practitioners (S1 File). This design
allows for a balance between removing excessive inter-practitioner variation and still encom-
passing the complex nature of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical practice [31].
When evaluating a complex intervention or “package of care,” such as TCM acupuncture, a
design slanted towards the pragmatic effectiveness end of the continuum is more appropriate
and increases the ecological validity of the outcome [32]. Acupuncture-specific reporting in
this trial follows the revised Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acu-
puncture [33].
The University of Western Sydney Human Ethics Committee (H10082) and the Health and
Disability Ethics Committee New Zealand (13/CEN/60) approved this study. Maori approval
was obtained from the Office of Tumuaki along with locality assessments for the clinic sites in
Auckland and Wellington through the Health and Disability Ethics Committee New Zealand.
Written consent was obtained from all participants before trial entry. The trial was prospec-
tively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (https://www.anzctr.
org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=363933) ACTRN12613000351718. Recruit-
ment ran from June 2013 to January 2014.
Participants
Eligible participants were aged 18–45 years, with suspected or confirmed primary dysmenor-
rhea as defined by the following: a history of period pain beginning before the age of 18, or
period pain beginning after the age of 18, but gynaecological investigations by laparoscopy or
ultrasound scan showing no evidence of secondary dysmenorrhea, pain greater than or equal
to 3 out of 10 on a numeric rating scale during the first three days of menses for at least two of
the past three menstrual cycles, regular menstrual cycles (28 +/- 5 days) for the last three
months, spoken and written English skills and able to give informed consent.

 Recruitment
Based on prevalence data we expected the majority of potential participants to be aged under
25 [6]. Most of these women would not have discussed their condition with their general prac-
titioner [10, 34] therefore we used similar promotion and recruitment strategies to Griffin [35]
with promotion of the study focussed on distributing study information using university email
lists, flyers and posters placed on campus. In addition, a Facebook advertisement and Google
Ad-words were created in conjunction with the University of Western Sydney (UWS) social
media committee. Both of these linked the participant with the UWS study website which pro-
vided more information and the contact details of the researcher. Facebook advertisements
were targeted to women, aged 18–45 years living within 60 miles of Auckland and Wellington,
New Zealand. Sixty miles was chosen as a suitable radius as it was considered unlikely that
women outside this distance would be happy to travel in for treatment if randomised to either
of the high-frequency groups. Upon contacting the primary investigator, women were assessed
for initial eligibility. Women were then instructed to fill in a menstrual pain diary during their
next menstrual period and this was assessed to confirm the presence of cycle length, pain levels
and pain characteristics indicative of primary dysmenorrhea. Menstrual pain diary and base-
line data were assessed to confirm eligibility before randomisation occurred. Fig 1 outlines the
participant flow in the trial.
Randomisation was computer generated and allocation was concealed by way of an inter-
net-based randomisation service, Sealed Envelope (www.sealedenvelope.com). Randomisation
into one of four study groups using a 1:1:1:1 ratio was undertaken using the web interface by
the primary investigator (MA). The four groups were, high frequency, manual acupuncture
(HF–MA), high frequency, electro acupuncture (HF–EA), low frequency, manual acupuncture
(LF–MA), low frequency, electro acupuncture (LF–EA).
Treatment protocol
All women in the study were scheduled to receive 12 treatments over the course of three men-
strual cycles. Women in the high frequency (HF) group received three treatments in the seven
days prior to the estimated day one of the menstrual cycle. Women in the low frequency (LF)
group received three treatments in the time between menses, approximately every seven to ten
days’ dependent on cycle length. All groups received a treatment in the first two days of menses
(day one or day two of the menses). In the manual acupuncture groups (-MA) all needles were
stimulated by hand using tonifying, reducing or even method, based on the practitioner’s clinical
judgement approximately 10–15 minutes after needle insertion was completed. In the electro-
acupuncture groups (-EA) Two distal points (from the previously chosen point prescription)
were selected by the practitioner and a 2Hz / 100Hz square wave pulse of 200ms duration was
applied between each point for 20 minutes using an ITO ES-160 electro-acupuncture machine
(Ito Co. Ltd, Japan). Intensity level was based on patient feedback; noticeable sensation present,
but below the threshold for discomfort. All initial consultations were allocated 60 minutes, with
follow-up consultations of 45 minutes’ duration.
The manualised protocol was based on data collected from an international survey of expe-
rienced women’s health practitioners [21] and focus groups [12]. Treatment was based on
TCM’s eight principles and Zang Fu diagnosis. Once a TCM diagnosis had been ascertained,
the practitioners had the flexibility with their point selection to address the diagnosed pattern
of disharmony as per the treatment handbook. Each subsequent treatment session would
allow for a confirmation or update on the TCM diagnosis and therefore point selection could
vary from treatment to treatment. Multiple patterns of disharmony are common in dysmenor-
rhea[36] and this trial supported up to two concurrent patterns of disharmony, designated as

 root (primary) and secondary (branch) patterns. In all cases no more than seven acupuncture
points were to be used. S1 Fig outlines how point selection occurred in both patients with one
or two TCM patterns. Acupuncture points were needled bilaterally, except those where only
one side was used clinically, such as opening extraordinary vessels such as the Chong Mai.
Point location and needling depth was as specified in A Manual of Acupuncture [37]. Single
use, stainless steel needles of varying gauge (.20 x 30mm or .25 x 40mm, DongBang, Korea)
were used. DeQi (the arrival of Qi) is the sensation generated by the insertion and/or

 manipulation of an acupuncture needle in an acupuncture point [38]. In all groups DeQi was
obtained for each acupuncture point at the beginning of the session and needles were retained
for 20–30 minutes. Each pattern also has moxibustion as a compulsory, optional or forbidden
component of the treatment. Indirect moxa was administered via smokeless moxa stick for
5–10 minutes on one of the selected acupuncture points. Each patient was given a diet and life-
style advice sheet during their first treatment session. These were grounded in TCM theory.
Blinding
Participants were not blinded to group allocation. Data entry was undertaken blind to the
study group, and analysis was undertaken blind to group allocation.
Outcomes
Changes in menstrual pain and other secondary symptoms were measured using a menstrual
pain diary (MPD) that was designed by the authors (See S2 File). This was used to assess the
changes in pain, analgesic intake, menstrual characteristics and secondary symptoms, and
allowed women to self-rate the severity of their dysmenorrhea in both intensity and duration
of pain, as well as the presence of secondary symptoms. The primary data endpoint used an
11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) for both “peak” and “average” pain each day, with 0
being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. The NRS has a high compliance rate, is
easy to use, preferred by chronic pain patients and fits the compact format of a menstrual
diary [39]. The diary also collected information on duration of menstrual pain each day (hours
or “all day”), secondary menstrual symptoms, including breast tenderness, emotional changes,
nausea etc. and analgesic usage (brand / pharmaceutical name, dosage and number of doses
per day) This MPD could be filled in either in hard copy or using a webform. Both were identi-
cal in content and layout. The diary was completed by the participant at the conclusion of the
day during either the menstrual period itself or one to two days prior to the menstrual period
if they were experiencing sharp, stabbing, cramping or aching pain in the lower abdomen or
lower back that they would normally associate with their period. The MPD was administered
at baseline, at each of the three menstrual periods during the study, the menstrual period fol-
lowing the completion of the study, and at one, six and 12 months after the conclusion of the
study.
Health related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using the 36-Item Short Form
Health Survey (SF-36v2). The SF-36 has been shown to be valid and reliable [40], and has
previously shown suitability for use in dysmenorrhea[41]. The SF-36v2 was self-adminis-
tered at baseline (prior to the first acupuncture session) and again at one-month follow-up
(post-trial completion).
An exit questionnaire was also used to determine self-reported improvement score, treat-
ment satisfaction and to record which, if any, symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea improved
(See S3 File).
The decision to calculate a responder rate was made a posteriori. The responder rate pro-
vides clinically meaningful information on the magnitude of pain reduction, in addition to the
continuous outcome data. Responder rates were calculated for the primary outcome measures
between baseline and one-month follow up, due to the significant loss to follow-up at 6 and 12
months. A recent review of chronic pain has shown that the threshold of a 30% reduction in
pain scores is where patients feel a clinically important change has occurred [42]. However,
the choice of responder rate can appear arbitrary and possibly bias the results, therefore pro-
viding a range of responder rates allows a more transparent view of the data [43]. Numeric
data for responder rates is provided for 30%, 50% and 70% reductions from baseline.

 Sample size
This trial was designed explore a difference in peak pain intensity on the first 3 days of the
menstrual period between groups as measured by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). A minimal
clinically important 20% difference between groups was expected and based on previous study
data [44], a standard deviation of 1.3 units on a pain scale was used. An alpha of 0.05 and
power of 90% gives a total sample size of 60 women. A power calculation was performed using
G�Power 3(G�Power: Statistical Power Analyses for Windows and Mac, Universita
¨t Du
¨ssel-
dorf). Previous studies [44, 45] had relatively low loss to follow-up (<15%), therefore a sample
size of 72 women (18 per group) was used to account for the predicted loss to follow-up of 10–
15%.
Analysis
Data analysis used descriptive statistics and inferential statistics to examine the demographic
and baseline characteristics. All statistical calculations were performed using IBM SPSS Statis-
tics v23 (IBM Corporation). Age, BMI, age of menarche, analgesic usage, expectation, smoking
and alcohol status, peak pain on the first three days of the menstrual period, average pain and
SF-36 scores were compared between groups at baseline using one-way ANOVA for continu-
ous data or chi-square for categorical data to ensure randomisation was successful. Differences
at baseline are reported as means and standard deviations or frequencies and percentages.
Both an ‘intention to treat’ approach and a per protocol analysis were undertaken for the pri-
mary and secondary endpoints. The menstrual symptoms score was calculated as the mean
number of symptoms per participant per day. Average pain for each menstrual cycle was calcu-
lated as the mean of each days ‘average pain’ score over each menstrual period. Pre-planned
contrasts were to compare mode of stimulation (MA vs EA) and frequency of treatment (HF
vs LF) and the effect of these combinations via the four different groups. Differences in the pri-
mary and secondary outcome measures were analysed using linear mixed model analysis of
variance with either i) group and time as fixed effects or ii) mode of stimulation, frequency of
treatment and time as fixed effects. In all linear mixed models subject was a used as a random
effect. Any interactions between group and time, mode of stimulation and time and frequency
of treatment and time were investigated. Due to the small sample size all p-values are explor-
atory. All pre-planned post hoc tests used Sidak for multiple pairwise comparisons. In the sec-
ondary analysis where means have been adjusted by SF-36 Role Physical, expectation of
benefit and current alcohol consumption, all relevant tables report both adjusted and unad-
justed means.
Results
A total of 106 women expressed interest in the study (See Fig 1). Seventy-four women met the
eligibility criteria and were randomised to one of the four groups. Sixty-three (85%) women
completed the treatment phase of the trial. Ten participants withdrew during the treatment
phase of the trial. Withdrawal from the trial was equally distributed across groups, with none
of the women citing any group-related concerns as reason for withdrawal.
The demographic and menstrual characteristics of the women at baseline are shown in
Table 1. One-way ANOVA and Pearson Chi-square showed three areas of imbalance between
the groups at baseline, in SF-36 role physical (F(3,69) = 1.12, p = 0.008), in expectation of bene-
fit (χ(6) = 13.205, p = 0.04) and in current alcohol consumption (χ(3) = 8.562, p = 0.036).
These were used as co-variates in the secondary analysis.
However, not all women received all 12 treatments, mostly due to logistical issues around
timing of treatments with regards to the start of menses. Twenty-five participants (35.2%)

 received the full 12 study treatments. The mean number of treatments was 10.6 [95% CI 10.22
to 10.99] for all women who had at least one study treatment. There was no difference in the
number of treatments given between groups (F(3,59) = 1.855, p = 0.147).

 Table 2 outlines peak pain, average pain, duration of pain and analgesic usage for each of
the groups at each time point for adjusted and unadjusted ITT analysis. See S4 File for results
of the per-protocol analysis.
Primary outcome
Abdominal pain.
For the primary outcome of peak pain during the first three days of
menses at the 12 month follow-up, all groups showed a significant reduction in peak abdomi-
nal pain over time, (F(6, 1519) = 12.3, p < .0001) and neither mode of stimulation (MA vs EA)
(p = 0.48) nor frequency of treatment (LF vs HF) (p = 0.362) showed a significant effect. There
was no significant difference between groups (p = 0.597) or any group�time interaction
(p = 0.506). A secondary analysis which included baseline co-variates as fixed effects did not
significantly alter any of the outcomes.
Secondary outcomes
Abdominal pain.
For the secondary outcome of average abdominal pain over the men-
strual period all groups showed reductions in average abdominal pain over time (F(6, 2324) =
7.98, p < .0001) and neither mode of stimulation (MA vs EA) (p = 0.61) nor frequency of treat-
ment (LF vs HF) (p = 0.74) showed a significant effect. There was no difference between the
four groups (p = 0.846) or any group�time interaction (p = 0.105). A secondary analysis with
baseline covariates did not significantly alter any of the outcomes.
Duration of menstrual pain.
For the duration of menstrual pain each day all groups
showed reductions in the duration of menstrual pain over time, (F(6, 2317) = 12.721, p <
.0001) and neither mode of stimulation (MA vs EA) (p = 0.61) nor frequency of treatment (LF
vs HF) (p = 0.74) showed a significant effect. There was no significant difference between
groups (p = 0.247) or any group�time interaction (p = 0.287). A secondary analysis with base-
line covariates did show a difference between groups (F(3, 2313) = 3.151, p = 0.024). A post-
hoc pairwise analysis showed that the HF-MA group had significantly shorter duration of pain
at baseline compared to HF-EA (MD -4.4, 95%CI -7.9 to -1.50, p = 0.003) and LF-MA (MD
-3.9, 95%CI -6.9 to 1.0, p = 0.008), at month 1 compared to HF-EA (MD -4.4, 95%CI -7.3 to
-1.4, p = 0.004), LF-MA (MD -4.4, 95%CI -7.4 to -1.5, p = 0.003), and LF-EA (MD -3.7, 95%CI
-6.6 to -0.8, p = 0.01) and at month 2 compared to HF-EA (MD -5.1, 95%CI -8.1 to -2.2,
p = 0.001). This difference was no longer significant from month 3 onwards.
Analgesic medication.
Medication usage was the mean number of doses per day of men-
ses of analgesic medication. Analgesic medication usage reduced in all groups over time, (F(6,
1519) = 3.4, p = 0.002) and mode of stimulation (MA vs EA) showed a significant effect, (F(1,
2343) = 5.3, p = 0.02) while frequency of treatment (LF vs HF) did not (p = 0.338). Post-hoc
pairwise analysis showed the manual acupuncture groups had lower analgesic intake at month
1 (MD -0.230, 95% CI -0.437 to -0.023, p = 0.03) and 1 month follow-up (MD -0.234, 95% CI
MD -0.441 to -0.027, p = 0.027), 6 month follow-up (MD -0.228, 95% CI MD -0.40 to -0.051,
p = 0.012) and 12 month follow-up (MD -0.182, 95% CI MD -0.361 to -0.004, p = 0.045).
There was no significant difference between groups (p = 0.151) or any group�time interaction
(p = 0.921). Secondary analysis which included baseline co-variates as fixed effects did not sig-
nificantly alter any of the outcomes.
Secondary symptoms.
There was a decrease in menstrual symptoms over time (F(6,
2313) = 8.4, p<0.001) which was different between groups (F(18, 2313) = 2.49, p<0.001), see
Fig 2. Mode of stimulation (MA vs EA) showed a significant difference in the number of men-
strual symptoms at different time points, (F(1, 2320) = 4.2, p<0.001) while frequency of treat-
ment (LF vs HF) did not (p = 0.858). Post-hoc pairwise analysis showed that the LF–EA group

 had significantly higher menstrual symptom count at Month Two to all groups, at Month
Three compared with HF–MA (MD -0.975, 95% CI -1.7 to -0.2, p = 0.005) and LF–MA (MD
-0.908, 95% CI -0.14 to -1.6, p = 0.011) and at one-month follow-up to HF–MA (MD -1.1, 95%
CI -0.32 to -1.9, p = 0.001) and LF–MA (MD -0.92,95% CI -0.12 to -1.7, p = 0.013). At six and
12-month follow-up the HF-MA group had significantly lower secondary symptom count
compared to both HF-EA (MD -1.12, 95% CI -1.9 to -0.30, p = 0.003) and LF-EA (MD -0.956,
95% CI -1.79 to -0.12, p = 0.018).
Responder rate. The proportion of responders with clinically significant pain reduction
of 30% in their peak pain was highest in the HF–MA group across all three days (55%, 60%
and 61% of women respectively) and over a third of women in this group had a 70% reduction
in their peak pain (See Table 3). Almost three-quarters (72%) of the women in the HF–MA
group had a clinically significant 30% reduction in their average pain, with 69% of the LF–MA
group, 61% of the LF–EA group and the 47% of the HF–EA group achieving this reduction.
Almost 60% of the LF–MA group and 55% of the HF–MA group had a 50% reduction in aver-
age pain from baseline to one-month follow-up. The electro-acupuncture groups had lower
scores, with 42% and 33% of the HF–EA and LF–EA groups achieving a 50% reduction.
Health-related quality of life (SF-36v2).
Overall, both the high-frequency groups showed
a greater number of improvements in the SF-36 domains (six domains) compared to the low-
frequency groups (two domains). Health related quality of life measured by the SF-36 improved
across a number of domains, between baseline and one-month follow-up (see Table 4). Paired
t-tests showed that there were improvements in the domains of role physical (p = 0.0029),
bodily pain (p = 0.0002), vitality (p = 0.028), social function (p = 0.0067) and overall physical
component (p = 0.001) between baseline and one-month follow-up. A one-way ANOVA
showed no difference between groups at the one month follow-up time point.
Self-rated symptom improvement.
At the end of the intervention the mean self-rated
improvement score by group was HF–MA 7.4 (95% CI 6.13 to 8.67), HF–EA 6.75 (95% CI
5.15 to 8.35), LF–MA 7.47 (95% CI 6.44 to 8.50), and LF–EA 6.5 (95% CI 5.07 to 7.93). Overall
self-rated improvement score, independent of group was 7.05 (95% CI 6.43 to 7.67). A one-
way ANOVA showed no difference between groups in self-rated improvement (F(3,58) = .577,
p = 0.632). Participants were asked to list the symptoms, if any, that they thought improved
the most during the trial. Women reported that abdominal cramps were the most common
symptom to improve, with 36 women indicating abdominal pain or cramping showed signifi-
cant improvement. Emotional changes (13 women) and back and leg pain (15 women) were
also commonly reported improvements.
Safety.
Fifty-two adverse events (AE) occurred over 702 acupuncture sessions, giving an
overall adverse event rate of 7.4% (95% CI 5.6 to 9.6) (see Table 5). There was no difference in
AE rate between groups. Most of the events were minor and self-limiting. Bruising (haema-
toma) was the most common adverse event (50% of all AE or 3.7% of treatments) with post
treatment soreness occurring in 1.4% of treatments and fatigue in 1.1% of treatments.
Discussion
Acupuncture treatment, regardless of group, using a manualised acupuncture protocol, showed
significant clinical improvements in all menstrual pain scores recorded; ‘peak pain’ over the
first three days of the menstrual period and ‘average pain’ over the entire menstrual period, and
that reduction was sustained for twelve months. This was supported by a similar significant
reduction across all other measures of menstrual impact; duration of pain, analgesic usage, sec-
ondary menstrual symptoms and a high self-rated improvement score. Electro-acupuncture did
not deliver greater pain reduction than manual acupuncture. Manual acupuncture groups

 tended to have a higher responder rate, significantly greater reduction in secondary symptoms,
and lower analgesic usage. With respect to health related quality of life six domains improved
from baseline in the HF groups, with only two improving from baseline in the LF groups. There
was no difference between manual and electro-acupuncture in terms of domains improved.
The lack of superiority of electro-acupuncture in terms of pain reduction was unexpected.
Electro-acupuncture in the trial was delivered at a 2/100Hz frequency, which has been shown
to provide maximal opioid gene expression by combining both high and low frequencies to
provide maximal pain relief[46]. This high frequency–low frequency stimulation pattern is
very common in gynaecological disorders[47], and is identical to the frequency used in many
other trials of electro-acupuncture for primary dysmenorrhea[48–51]. Animal models suggest
that needling at REN4, SP8 and SP6, used in 80%, 55% and 98% of all study treatments respec-
tively, regulates neuro-endocrine activities, including levels of progesterone[52]; and needling
SP6 has been shown to increase ovarian blood flow via a reflex response in rats[53]. A similar
reflex response exists in humans, increasing uterine blood flow by reducing sympathetic activ-
ity on vasoconstrictor fibres that innervate the uterus[25, 54]. Uterine blood flow is often
reduced in women with primary dysmenorrhea[55, 56] and increasing uterine blood flow
appears to be related to some of the analgesic benefits of acupuncture in primary dysmenor-
rhea[50, 57]. The magnitude of the impact of needling SP6 and, to a lesser extent, REN4 and
SP8, may be larger than stimulation-specific differences. Another plausible possibility is that
the time course of increased endogenous opioid release caused by electro-acupuncture is too
short to contribute to a noticeable overall reduction in menstrual pain [58].
In addition to reductions in pain, many women had a reduction in their secondary men-
strual symptoms. Inflammation is a primary cause of primary dysmenorrhea [59] and a

 possible cause of PMS symptoms, including mood changes, bloating and breast tenderness
[60]. The wide range of improvements in both pain and PMS related symptoms, especially
mood changes, seen in this trial provide support for acupuncture’s posited anti-inflammatory
effects[24], future research including suitable bio-makers would provide more information on
these possible pathways.
Analgesic medication usage was lower amongst the manual acupuncture groups. As analge-
sic usage was allowed ad libitum women may have used analgesic medication to achieve an
acceptable level of pain. Therefore, the lower usage of analgesic medication amongst these two
groups suggests that without analgesic usage there may have been more pronounced differ-
ences between these two groups. The reasons for this lower use are unclear, as electro-acu-
puncture should provide at least the same amount of relief as manual acupuncture, as the
needles were stimulated to obtain DeQi prior to electro-stimulation, thereby delivering a man-
ual acupuncture-like stimulus prior to the addition of the electro-acupuncture pulse[61]. The
changes in the HRQoL SF-36 domains suggest that after the course of acupuncture treatment,
participants had less problems with work or daily activities as a result of their physical health,
less pain and subsequent limitations due to pain, more energy, and less interference from
physical and emotional problems in social activities[62], all of which are commonly experi-
enced by women with primary dysmenorrhea [8, 63].
In terms of pain reduction, the trial findings were similar to results provided by previous
studies. Direct comparison to studies performed in China[29, 48–51] with very short time-
scales of measurement post-treatment are problematic as these may not represent meaningful
changes over the entire menses. Comparisons with other trials outside of China tend to show
similar results to this study. Absolute pain reductions were less than Witt (Germany)[45] and
Helms (US) [64] but similar to that found by Smith (Australia)[44]. Comparison with Helms
[64] is complicated by the fact that the sample size was very small, showing no between group
differences and the use of a custom pain scale that was not validated. The greater absolute pain
reduction found by Witt [45] may be due to the nature of the intervention, where physicians
were allowed to choose treatment without restriction, or due to the greater sample size, almost
ten times the size of this study. However, the responder rates (>30% reduction in average pain
from baseline) were similar to Witt’s, showing that the percentage pain reduction from base-
line was relatively equal between the two studies. Similarly to Smith [44] and Witt [45], reduc-
tions in pain in this study appeared to be sustained or increased after the trial period ended.
There were no between group differences in all pain outcome measures, despite large differ-
ences in responder rates between groups. This is most likely due to the exploratory nature of
the study, which was not powered to detect small between group differences. A post-hoc power
analysis shows that a sample size of 192 would be required to determine a 20% difference
between groups for average pain. While a difference of >30% from baseline is considered clini-
cally important, the size of differences between groups that are important to participants

 appears to be dependent on the condition treated[43]. In this case, these between group differ-
ences do not appear to significantly alter how successful women felt their treatment was, sup-
ported by the fact there was no difference in self-reported improvement score between groups,
however, future studies with significantly more participants would be required to answer this
question.
The strengths of this exploratory study were that it recruited a group of participants who
were representative of women in the community with dysmenorrhea, having a variety of sec-
ondary symptoms, including back pain, fatigue, breast tenderness, nausea, headaches and
bowel changes, consistent with many other populations with primary dysmenorrhea[8, 9, 34].
Analgesic usage amongst the study participants was very prevalent (81%), almost identical to
the prevalence of analgesic usage in Australian women with dysmenorrhea (80%)[65]. There
are several limitations on this exploratory study: Due to the high loss to follow-up at 6 and 12
months the significant use of last observation carried forward in a small sample such as this
could contribute to over-estimating the duration of the treatment effect in the intention to
treat analysis, however a per-protocol analysis without using last observation carried forward
showed similar results. The RCT, due to its design in comparing effectiveness of differing
doses of acupuncture, did not have a usual care group. The changes observed over the 12
month period are unlikely to be due to natural reductions in the pain from primary dysmenor-
rhea[66]. Witt (Germany) [45] showed a 15% reduction in average menstrual pain in the usual
care group at 3 months while our study found a 24% reduction in average pain independent of
group allocation at the same time point. This suggests an additional benefit of acupuncture but
our ability to determine the extent to which acupuncture treatment is responsible for the
changes in pain, menstrual symptoms and health-related quality of life observed in the study is
limited.
Conclusion
This exploratory study suggests acupuncture administered over three menstrual cycles gave
both statistically and clinically significant reductions in menstrual pain compared to baseline
and persisted for 12 months, however there was no significant difference in pain intensity
between groups. Electro-acupuncture was well tolerated but did not always provide the same
magnitude of improvements as manual acupuncture in reducing secondary menstrual symp-
toms and analgesic medication intake. Manual acupuncture provided the same or greater pain
relief as electro-acupuncture, but with less analgesic medication required to achieve this pain
reduction. Treatment timing appears to play a small role, with high frequency of treatment
providing greater improvements in health-related quality of life. This exploratory trial suggests
that there may be an effect of both treatment timing and mode of stimulation, but possibly
only of small clinical benefit. Future adequately powered studies are needed to confirm the
role of both mode of stimulation and treatment timing and to provide a more accurate indica-
tion of the clinical impact of altering these dose components on menstrual pain.
