Abstract
BACKGROUND—Excessive binge alcohol drinking has acute cardiac arrhythmogenic effects, 
including promotion of atrial fibrillation (AF), which underlies “Holiday Heart Syndrome.” The 
mechanism that couples binge alcohol abuse with AF susceptibility remains unclear. We 
previously reported stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling contributes to AF 
development. This is interesting because JNK is implicated in alcohol-caused organ malfunction 
beyond the heart.
OBJECTIVES—The purpose of this study was to detail how JNK promotes binge alcohol-
evoked susceptibility to AF.
METHODS—The authors found binge alcohol-exposure leads to activated JNK, specifically 
JNK2. Furthermore, binge alcohol induces AF (24- vs. 1.8-Hz burst pacing-induced episodes per 
attempt per animal), higher incidence of diastolic intracellular Ca2+activity (Ca2+waves, 
sarcoplasmic reticulum [SR] Ca2+leakage), and membrane voltage (Vm) and systolic Ca2+ release 
spatiotemporal heterogeneity (ΔtVm-Ca). These changes were completely eliminated by JNK 
inhibition both in vivo and in vitro. calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) is a proarrhythmic molecule 
known to drive SR Ca2+ mishandling.
RESULTS—The authors report for the first time that binge alcohol activates JNK2, which 
subsequently phosphorylates the CaMKII protein, enhancing CaMKII-driven SR Ca2+ 
mishandling. CaMKII inhibition eliminates binge alcohol-evoked arrhythmic activities.

 CONCLUSIONS—Our studies demonstrate that binge alcohol exposure activates JNK2 in atria, 
which then drives CaMKII activation, prompting aberrant Ca2+ waves and, thus, enhanced 
susceptibility to atrial arrhythmia. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized form of alcohol-
driven kinase-on-kinase proarrhythmic crosstalk. Atrial JNK2 function represents a potential novel 
therapeutic target to treat and/or prevent AF.

Excessive binge drinking affects 38 million adults in the United States (1,2). Despite 
growing efforts at prevention, there is a significantly rising trend in the prevalence of binge 
drinking (1–3). The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines 
binge drinking as a short-term pattern of consumption (4 to 5 drinks per episode) leading to 
a blood alcohol level (BAL) >80 mg/dl (2,4).
Excessive binge drinking is a known independent risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias often 
called Holiday Heart Syndrome (5,6). Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequently 
diagnosed arrhythmia among Holiday Heart Syndrome patients (5–7). Moreover, AF 
substantially increases the risk of morbidity and mortality due to embolic stroke and heart 
failure (8,9). Clinical data suggest that one-third of all new-onset AF cases are related to 
alcohol intoxication (10,11). Furthermore, clinical studies have revealed that binge alcohol 
intake creates a higher AF risk among patients with cardiovascular disease (12). Strikingly, 
this alcohol-associated AF risk exists even in patients without co-existing cardiovascular 
diseases (7,13,14). Alcohol abstinence can reverse AF, but recurrence is common as repeat 
binge drinking occurs at an alarmingly high frequency worldwide (5,6). Repeated binge 
drinking significantly enhances the risk of chronic alcohol abuse that can ultimately lead to 
alcoholic cardiomyopathy, which can also increase the risk of arrhythmia (15). To date, the 
molecular mechanisms that couple binge alcohol and enhanced AF propensity remain 
unclear. Thus, defining those mechanisms will further our understanding of this substantial 
alcohol-related public health issue.
Stress-activated c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) is activated by many types of stress 
stimuli such as cardiovascular diseases, aging, and diabetes (16–19). JNK activation is well 
known to contribute to alcohol-caused organ damage (20,21). We recently reported that JNK 
activation promotes AF in aged hearts (18,19). We also showed that direct JNK activation by 
a JNK activator increased AF risk in young healthy animals (18,19). These findings 
prompted us to explore whether JNK plays a role in binge alcohol-associated enhancement 
of atrial arrhythmogenicity.
Emerging evidence suggests alcohol may change intracellular Ca2+dynamics (22) and 
cardiac contractile function (23), yet the consequences of binge alcohol on atrial 
sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) handling of Ca2+and AF propensity remain largely unknown to 
date. Here, we combined a unique intravital atrial Ca2+ imaging approach in cardiac-specific 
transgenic mice to detail a causal link between binge alcohol and atrial arrhythmogenicity. 
The goal of the current studies was to understand how alcohol-evoked JNK regulates

 calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII), a proarrhythmic molecule (24) that, in turn, drives SR Ca2+ 
mishandling and consequently enhances AF susceptibility. Our findings indicate that 
modulating JNK could be a novel therapeutic approach to prevent or treat AF.
METHODS

HUMAN SAMPLES
Human donor hearts were obtained from Illinois Gift of Hope Organ and Tissue Donor 
Network. The alcohol-exposed hearts were from donors with a history of repeated binge 
drinking whereas the control hearts were from donors without a history of alcohol use. All 
patients had no history of AF or any major cardiovascular diseases. Online Table 1 shows 
de-identified general data (age, sex, race, and other factors) of the donors obtained from Gift 
of Hope. The studies were approved by the Human Study Committees of Rush University 
Medical Center (RUMC) and Illinois Gift of Hope.
ANIMAL MODELS
All animal studies followed Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH 
publication, 8th edition, 2011) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committees of RUMC, Loyola University Chicago, and University of Alabama at 
Birmingham.
New Zealand White male rabbits were infused with either alcohol or saline (2 g/kg, 
intravenously every other day for a total of 4 injections) followed by atrial arrhythmia 
induction procedures and biochemical assays as previously described (18). Rabbit atrial 
myocytes were isolated as previously described (25). AF induction, confocal imaging, 
membrane potential (Vm)/Ca2+ dual-channel optical mapping and biochemical assays were 
conducted to assess the functional role of binge alcohol-evoked JNK in 3 binge alcohol-
exposed mouse models including: 1) wild-type (WT) C57/Bj mice; 2) WT mice treated with 
a JNK2 inhibitor (in vivo); and 3) transgenic (Tg) JNK1/2dn (where “dn” stands for 
dominant negative) mice with overexpression of inactive cardiac-specific dominant negative 
JNK1 and JNK2 protein (26). Cardiac function of alcohol exposed mice and sham controls 
remained unaltered (Online Figure 1). The functional role of CaMKII was assessed in 
alcohol-exposed WT mice treated with the CaMKII inhibitor KN93 or its inactive analog 
KN92 prior to the terminal studies (Online Methods).
AF INDUCIBILITY ASSESSMENT, CONFOCAL CA2+ IMAGING, AND DUAL-CHANNEL 
OPTICAL MAPPING
Atrial arrhythmia inducibility was examined in alcohol-exposed rabbits and mouse models 
as previously described, with modification (18,19). Ca2+ imaging, and dual-channel optical 
mapping studies were conducted in intact mouse hearts (24 h after the last treatment of the 4 
alcohol injections) as previously described (18,27). The lapse between the activation time of 
membrane voltage and Ca2+ transient (ΔtVm-Ca) was calculated and the standard deviation of 
the ΔtVm-Ca was calculated as previously described (28). Results were compared between

 binge alcohol hearts and sham controls. A well-characterized cultured atrial myocyte line, 
HL-1, was also used for our studies (18). To assess the roles of JNK and CaMKII, a JNK2-
specific inhibitor or the CaMKII inhibitor KN93 was applied 24 h before the alcohol 
exposure. Diastolic SR Ca2+ leakage was measured using a well-established tetracaine-
sensitive SR Ca2+ leakage protocol as previously described (25).
BIOCHEMICAL ASSAYS
Kinase activities were assessed from the production of ADP in the kinase reaction with 
either JNK-specific substrate c-Jun or CaMKII-specific substrate autocamtide-2 as 
previously described (19). Protein expression and phosphorylation status were assessed by 
immunoblotting assay as previously described (18,19,25).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All data are presented as mean ± SEM. Differences between multiple groups or any 2 groups 
were evaluated using 1-way ANOVA with the post hoc Tukey test or Student’s t-test. When 
heterogeneity of variance was observed, a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test or 
nonparametric 1-way ANOVA was performed. A p value of <0.05 was considered 
significant.
RESULTS
BINGE ALCOHOL ENHANCES JNK ACTIVATION AND ARRHYTHMIA SUSCEPTIBILITY IN 
RABBIT AND HUMAN ATRIA
Human hearts from donors with a history of repeat binge alcohol exposure were studied and 
compared to donor hearts without a history of alcohol exposure. Langendorff-perfused 
human atrial preparations were challenged with electrical burst stimulations. There was a 
significantly increased AF incidence immediately after we stopped the electrical stimulation 
in the alcohol-exposed human atria (3 out of 4 hearts) (Figure 1A, long red arrows). In 
contrast, no pacing-induced AF events were found in the non–alcohol-exposed age-matched 
human control atria (0 out of 4 hearts) (Figure 1B). To further confirm these findings in 
human atria, we assessed proarrhythmic effects of well-controlled alcohol exposure in 
animals. The binge alcohol regimen consisted of 4 repeated doses (see Methods). In rabbits, 
there was a significantly increased pacing-induced incidence of AF in binge alcohol-exposed 
rabbit atria (6 of 6 vs. 0 of 5 in sham controls) (Figures 1C and 1D). The average length of 
pacing-induced AF was 29.8 ± 11.5 s in alcohol-exposed rabbits compared to 0.7 ± 0.1 s in 
sham controls (Figure 1D, sham, far right). Immunoblotting revealed the activation of the 
stress-response kinase JNK (assessed by phosphorylated JNK [JNK-p]), which was 
markedly enhanced in alcohol-exposed human atria, whereas the total JNK2 and JNK1 
protein contents remained unchanged (Figure 2A). Similar to humans, significantly 
enhanced JNK activation (compared to sham control) was also found in alcohol-exposed 
rabbit atria (Figure 2B).

 CAUSAL LINK–BETWEEN ALCOHOL-EVOKED JNK ACTIVATION, ARRHYTHMOGENIC 
CA2+ ACTIVITIES AND AF
AF inducibility was further measured in binge alcohol-exposed mouse models. In WT mice, 
binge alcohol exposure significantly increased JNK activation (JNK-p) (Figure 2C), as well 
as the incidence of burst-pacing–induced atrial arrhythmias. Burst-pacing– induced atrial 
arrhythmias were absent in sham controls (Figures 3A to 3C). Representative electrogram 
traces show alcohol-exposed mice developed atrial arrhythmia following 30 s of pacing at 8 
Hz (3× diastolic threshold) (Figure 3A1), while sham control animals immediately returned 
to sinus rhythm (Figure 3A2). Strikingly, alcohol-evoked arrhythmia inducibility was nearly 
absent in JNK1/2dn mice (JNK1/2dn) (Figures 3A3, 3B, and 3C far right bars). The 
JNK1/2dn mice have cardiac-specific overexpression of inactive dominant negative JNK1 
and JNK2 proteins for competing JNK inhibition. These results imply that JNK activation 
contributes to the enhanced AF susceptibility of alcohol hearts.
SR Ca2+ mishandling is known to be pivotal for Ca2+-triggered arrhythmic activities, and 
thus, high-resolution confocal Ca2+ imaging studies were performed using Langendorff-
perfused intact mouse hearts. Binge alcohol-exposed WT mouse atria (compared to sham 
controls) had markedly increased spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ waves during normal sinus 
rhythm (NSR), as well as more frequent waves following 10-Hz burst pacing (Figures 4A1, 
4A2, and 4B). The binge alcohol exposure also prolonged the intracellular Ca2+ decay 
constant (τ) (37.8 ± 1.26 ms vs. 31.0 ± 0.96 ms in sham) (Figure 4C). In the cardiac-specific 
JNK1/2dn Tg mouse atria, the expression of inactive JNK1/2dn proteins precluded alcohol-
driven atrial Ca2+ waves and Ca2+ transient τ prolongation (31.1 ± 2.9 ms vs. 31.0 ± 0.9 ms 
in sham) (Figures 4A3, 4B, and 4C, far right bars). This is consistent with the rescue effect 
of JNK1/2 inhibition on alcohol-evoked AF shown in Figure 3.
JNK2 INHIBITION ATTENUATES ALCOHOL-EVOKED ARRHYTHMOGENIC CA2+ ACTIVATES
Cardiac muscle contains predominantly the JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms, but these 2 isoforms 
have different functions (26). We immunoprecipitated the JNK2 and JNK1 proteins with 
JNK isoform-specific antibodies, followed by JNK isoform-specific activity measurement. 
In alcohol-exposed WT mouse atria, there was a 37% increase in JNK2 activity compared to 
activity in sham controls (Figure 5A, left bars), whereas JNK1 activity remained unchanged 
(Figure 5A, right bars). The functional contribution of JNK2 during alcohol-driven atrial 
arrhythmogenicity was assessed using JNK2-specific inhibition and simultaneous Vm and 
intracellular Ca2+ dual-channel optical mapping in intact WT mouse atria. Compared to the 
sham controls, alcohol-exposed atria showed substantially increased spatiotemporal Vm and 
Ca2+ signal heterogeneity. Summarized data show binge alcohol significantly increases the 
mean standard deviation of the lapse between the activation time of action potential and 
Ca2+ transient (ΔtVm-Ca) (Figures 5B and 5C) compared to sham controls. This type of 
increased spatial heterogeneity of ΔtVm-Ca is arrhythmogenic (28) and indicative of 
abnormal Ca2+ activities. Binge alcohol-exposed WT mice were then treated with a JNK2 
inhibitor in vivo (JNK2I; a total of 3 doses) along with the alcohol exposure. In alcohol-
exposed WT mice, the JNK2I effectively suppressed atrial arrhythmogenicity, as shown by 
reduced ΔtVm-Ca heterogeneity (Figure 5B, far right bar). Specificity of the JNK2I in JNK2 
activity was verified by the results of JNK isoform activity measurement. JNK2I

 significantly reduced JNK2, not JNK1, activity in alcohol-exposed atrial myocytes (Online 
Figure 2). Recently, we reported (18,19) that JNK was also activated by aging, and this leads 
to Cx43 gap junction remodeling, which impairs cell–cell communication, slowing atrial 
action potential conduction velocity. Here, we found that the alcohol-exposed atria had 
preserved conduction velocity and unchanged Cx43 expression (Online Figure 3). Overall, 
our results suggest alcohol-evoked JNK2 activation promotes atrial arrhythmias by abnormal 
atrial Ca2+ activities.
Enhanced diastolic SR Ca2+ leakage is often associated with abnormal diastolic Ca2+ waves 
(25). Indeed, alcohol-exposed rabbit atrial myocytes and HL-1 atrial myocytes had 
dramatically increased SR Ca2+ leakage (0.15 ± 0.02 vs. 0.05 ± 0.01 ΔF/F0 in sham 
controls) (Figures 5D and 5E, middle bars). With the JNK2 inhibition, the alcohol-evoked 
increase of diastolic SR Ca2+ leakage was abolished by the JNK2I treatment (0.05 ± 0.01 vs. 
0.05 ± 0.01 ΔF/F0 in sham controls) (Figures 5D and 5E, far right bars). These data were 
also consistent with the findings of alcohol-evoked JNK2 action on abnormal Ca2+ activities 
in intact atria as shown in Figures 4 and 5.
ALCOHOL-EVOKED CaMKII-DEPENDENT SR CA2+ LEAKAGE AND ABERRANT CA2+ 
ACTIVITIES
CaMKII is well known as an important molecule that promotes SR Ca2+ mishandling and 
cardiac arrhythmogenicity. Here, atrial myocytes (HL-1 cells) were treated with a CaMKII 
inhibitor, KN93, or its inactive analog KN92, and then exposed to alcohol (24 h). The 
alcohol-evoked tetracaine-sensitive SR Ca2+ leakage was abolished by KN93 (0.06 ± 0.02 
vs. 0.05 ± 0.01 ΔF/F0 in sham) (Figure 6A). In contrast, KN92 pre-treatment did not alter 
alcohol-evoked tetracaine-sensitive SR Ca2+ leakage (0.15 ± 0.02 vs. 0.05 ± 0.01 ΔF/F0 in 
sham) (Figure 6A, far right bar). We measured the functional effects of CaMKII inhibition in 
alcohol hearts. A single dose of KN93 or KN92 was administered in alcohol-infused mice in 
vivo prior to the terminal studies. We found that KN93, but not KN92, significantly 
decreased alcohol-evoked SR Ca2+ waves (Figure 6B) and reversed the alcohol-evoked 
prolongation of intracellular Ca2+ decay constant (28.9 ± 1.3 in KN93-treated vs. 42.4 ± 4.6 
ms in KN92-treated atria) (Figure 6C). Thus, CaMKII inhibition had the same anti-
arrhythmic actions as JNK2 inhibition. This suggests that the mechanism that couples 
alcohol, SR Ca2+ mishandling, and atrial arrhythmogenicity may involve both JNK2 and 
CaMKII.
ALCOHOL-EVOKED JNK2 ACTIVATES CaMKII BY PROTEIN PHOSPHORYLATION
To explore the JNK-CaMKII relationship in alcohol-evoked atrial arrhythmogenicity, human 
influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged CaMKII-WT was overexpressed in alcohol-exposed 
(24 h) HEK293 cells in the presence or absence of a JNK2 inhibitor. Then, CaMKII activity 
was assessed by kinase assays in CaMKII-WT proteins immunoprecipitated by an anti-HA 
antibody. Alcohol alone increased CaMKII activity by 50%. This did not happen with the 
JNK2I present (Figure 7A). These results indicate that alcohol-evoked JNK2 upregulates 
CaMKII activity. One possibility is that JNK2 directly phosphorylates the CaMKII protein. 
To test this possibility, pure active human JNK2 proteins (hJNK2) were incubated with anti-
HA antibody-immunoprecipitated CaMKII-WT or mutant CaMKII-T286A proteins. The

 CaMKII-T286A mutant has a silenced autophosphorylation site. To monitor protein 
phosphorylation (i.e., ATP consumption), we used the ADP-Glo assay kit (Promega, 
Madison, Wisconsin) We found that active JNK2 significantly increased phosphorylation of 
HA-tagged CaMKII-WT proteins but not of the HA-tagged CaMKII-T286A mutated protein 
(Figure 7B). Immunoblotting data with a phospho-specific anti-CaMKII-P286 antibody 
confirmed the JNK2 action on CaMKII phosphorylation (Figure 7D). These results suggest 
JNK2 directly phosphorylates the CaMKII protein, activating CaMKII.
Note that alcohol may increase production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Elevated ROS 
could promote CaMKII activation by oxidizing CaMKII’s Met280 and Met281 sites (29). To 
assess the potential ROS contribution to alcohol-evoked CaMKII activation, an HA-tagged 
Met280Val/Met281Val mutant CaMKII vector (CaMKII-VV) was overexpressed in HEK293 
cells, and then these cells were exposed to 50 mM alcohol for 24 h. CaMKII-VV was 
nonresponsive to intracellular ROS challenge but retained the autophosphorylation T286 site 
function. The activity of HA-tagged CaMKII-VV proteins was significantly higher in 
alcohol-exposed cells than in sham controls (Figure 7C). The increased CaMKII activity was 
similar to that of alcohol-exposed CaMKII-WT proteins. This demonstrates that alcohol-
evoked JNK2 activation alone is sufficient to explain the observed CaMKII activation.
DISCUSSION
Here we have shown for the first time that alcohol-evoked JNK2 activation enhances atrial 
susceptibility of arrhythmic Ca2+ activities and AF. We discovered that alcohol-evoked 
JNK2 targets CaMKII activation. Specifically, the JNK2 phosphorylates the CaMKII 
protein, activating CaMKII. The resulting enhanced CaMKII activity, in turn, promotes 
aberrant SR Ca2+ activities and enhanced AF susceptibility (Central Illustration).
In humans, binge drinkers have a significantly increased AF risk compared to nondrinkers 
(5–7). Accumulating clinical data show binge alcohol exposure promotes cardiac 
arrhythmias even in the patients who lack a clinical history of cardiovascular diseases. Our 
AF inducibility studies reproduce the increased AF susceptibility following binge alcohol 
exposure in both human and animal hearts that had preserved cardiac function and no AF or 
major cardiovascular disease history. Clinical data also suggest the highest risk time frame 
for binge alcohol-induced atrial arrhythmia is approximately 24 h following the alcohol 
exposure (14). Interestingly, BALs have already reversed to the baseline levels by this time 
(14). Thus, the alcohol is no longer actually present when the atrial arrhythmic ramifications 
of the binge alcohol exposure occur. Most binge alcohol animal models designed for 
studying binge alcohol-associated organ damage (i.e., to liver) have extremely high BALs, 
which indeed lead to severe measurable tissue injury but also likely drive substantial ROS 
production (30,31). Here, we applied a binge alcohol-exposure model that mimics the 
human holiday drinking pattern, one with repeated episodes of alcohol intake separated by 
recovery periods. At the time of terminal studies, alcohol-exposed animals’ BAL had 
returned to the baseline and was comparable to that in the sham controls. These animals also 
had preserved cardiac function, unaltered heart weight-to-body weight ratio, as well as no 
cardiac hypertrophy or pulmonary edema.

 This study is the first to report that binge alcohol activates stress response kinase JNK, 
which leads to SR Ca2+ mishandling and enhances atrial arrhythmogenicity. JNK activation 
has been observed under various pathological conditions and is involved in the development 
of cancer, diabetes, and arthritis (16,17). JNK activation has also been shown in various 
cardiac diseases such as heart failure and ischemic-reperfusion injury (32,33), conditions in 
which the heart is prone to arrhythmia. Emerging evidence suggests that activated JNK is 
linked to AF in aged hearts and a tachypacing dog model (18,19,34). Here, we found that 
alcohol-evoked JNK leads to augmented CaMKII-driven SR Ca2+ mishandling, which 
ultimately enhances atrial arrhythmogenicity. A causal link among alcohol, JNK activation, 
and atrial arrhythmogenicity was strongly supported by cardiac-specific JNK inhibition 
rescue results in alcohol-exposed JNK1/2dn mice, overexpressing inactive JNK1 and JNK2 
dominant negative proteins (Figure 3). JNK1 and JNK2 are known to have distinctive 
functions (17,26). JNK1 has been shown to be critical in preserving cardiac function and 
promoting apoptosis in hearts with in vitro ischemia-reperfusion. JNK2 has been found to 
contribute to the development of diabetes, atherosclerosis, and skin tumors. (17,26) Here, we 
found that elevated JNK2 activity, not JNK1, is implicated in binge alcohol-evoked atrial 
arrhythmogenicity. The antiarrhythmic action of a JNK2 specific inhibitor in live alcohol-
exposed animals further supports the role of JNK2 activation. This new finding suggests that 
development of drugs specifically targeting the JNK2 isoform may be helpful for future AF 
prevention and treatment.
Activation of stress-response kinase JNK, a member of the important MAPK family, is a 
common feature of alcohol-caused tissue injury (20,21). Other MAPK family members (p38 
and extracellular ERK) may also contribute in a cellular context and type-dependent fashion 
(35–37). For example, JNK and p38 have opposite functions (activation or suppression) 
during cellular senescence (36). In the acutely alcohol-exposed heart, p38 is unchanged, and 
ERK is suppressed (37). These previous findings are quite consistent with our unpublished 
results showing unchanged p38 and ERK activation in binge alcohol-exposed atria from both 
humans and animal models.
Another interesting new finding here is that alcohol-evoked JNK2 activation drives 
enhancement of CaM-KII activation. This is the first description of this form of kinase–
kinase crosstalk, and it may have substantial ramifications in the heart, considering the 
pivotal role of CaMKII in arrhythmogenesis (24,25,29,38–40). Last, alcohol is known to 
increase cellular ROS (41), and ROS may activate CaMKII (29). To assess the relative 
contributions of JNK- and ROS-dependent CaMKII activation here, we used CaMKII 
mutants missing the ROS-sensing sites (Met280/281). These mutations did not prevent 
alcohol-induced CaMKII activation. However, JNK2 inhibition effectively suppressed 
alcohol-evoked CaMKII activation. Thus, this JNK2-CaMKII causal link is critical in binge 
alcohol-evoked SR Ca2+ mishandling and atrial arrhythmogenicity.
STUDY LIMITATIONS
We note that it is always a great challenge to get accurate donor history of binge drinking 
habits in human studies. Thus, increasing sample size is required for further human heart 
studies. However, our current results from well-controlled alcohol exposure in animals

 provided strong evidence suggesting the pivotal role of JNK2 in enhanced atrial 
arrhythmogenicity in binge alcohol-exposed hearts.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that alcohol activates JNK2. The JNK2 then phosphorylates the CaMKII 
protein, enhancing cellular CaMKII activity and, consequently, atrial arrhythmogenicity. 
Future therapeutic strategies targeting JNK2-specific inhibition might be helpful for AF 
prevention and treatment in alcoholic patients. The potential clinical significance of our 
findings may have implications beyond our alcohol focus as other cellular challenges (such 
as aging, post-surgical inflammation, heart failure, and so forth) may also cause JNK2 
activation.

 PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE
Excessive “binge” alcohol intake underlies the “holiday heart syndrome” of paroxysmal 
AF. A causal link between stress-response kinase JNK2 activation and the propensity to 
AF evoked by binge drinking involves a form of alcohol-driven kinase interaction.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK
Future studies should explore whether modulating JNK2 activity could prevent the 
proarrhythmic CaMKII activity associated with AF.

Heart and Rabbit Heart
(A) Representative electrogram trace showing burst pacing (3 Hz)-induced AF in a binge 
alcohol-exposed human donor heart (with normal cardiac function). (B) Representative EG 
recording from a paced age-matched control human donor heart and there was no AF upon 
cessation of pacing. (C) Representative electrogram trace showing burst pacing (for 30 s at 
6× diastolic threshold; cycle length = 100 ms)-induced AF immediately after cessation of the

 FIGURE 4. JNK Inhibition Abolished Binge Alcohol-Evoked Abnormal Atrial Ca2+ Waves in 
Intact Mouse Atria
(A) Representative confocal images show increased frequency of Ca2+ sparks (yellow

burst pacing (1.) and reversion of NSR in either control WT mice (2.) or JNK1/2dn mice 
with overexpression of cardiac-specific JNK1/2dn (3.). (B) Summarized data show increased 
frequency of Ca2+ waves in binge alcohol-exposed mouse atria, while dominant negative 
overexpression of JNK1/2 precluded binge alcohol-prompted Ca2+waves. (C) Atrial 
Ca2+decay constant τ was increased in binge alcohol-exposed WT mice, but binge alcohol-
exposed JNK1/2dn mice exhibited unchanged τ of Ca2+ decay compared to that of sham 
controls. Ca2+ = calcium; other abbreviations as in Figures 1 to 3.

 FIGURE 5. JNK2 Inhibition (In Vivo Treatment) Eliminates Binge Alcohol-Evoked Abnormal 
Ca2+ Handling in Intact Atria and Atrial Myocytes
(A) Summarized data show enhanced JNK2 kinase activity (measured by ADP production) 
in JNK2 antibody-specific pulldown JNK2 proteins but unchanged JNK1 activity. (B) 
Summarized data show enhanced heterogeneity of ΔtVm-Ca in alcohol-exposed mouse left 
atria, whereas JNK2 inhibitor in vivo treatment abolished this arrhythmogenic abnormality. 
(C) Representative optical isochronal maps show heterogeneous wavefront propagation of 
the Vm and Ca2+ signals in an alcohol-exposed atrium compared to a WT sham control. 
JNK2 inhibition effectively reversed this alcohol-evoked heterogeneity. (D, E) Summarized 
data show increased tetracaine-sensitive diastolic SR Ca2+ leakage in alcohol-exposed rabbit 
atrial myocytes (D) and HL-1 myocytes (E), while JNK2 inhibition abolished this alcohol-
induced SR Ca2+ leak. ADP = adenosine diphosphate; JNK2I = JNK2 inhibitor; NS = no 
statistical significance; RLU = relative light units; Vm = membrane potential; other

inactive analog KN92) also prevented alcohol-evoked tetracaine-sensitive diastolic SR Ca2+ 
leakage in HL-1 myocytes. (B) (C) In vivo treatment with a single dose of KN93 eliminated

(A) Summarized data show increased ADP production (reflecting an increased ATP 
consumption in the CaMKII reaction with its substrate) in HA-pulldown CaMKII-WT 
proteins from alcohol-exposed cells, while JNK2I suppressed alcohol-evoked CaMKII 
activity. (B) Pooled ADP production assay data and representative immunoblotting images 
show that active pure JNK2 proteins increase the phosphorylation of CaMKII-WT, whereas 
autophosphorylation site mutation prevents this JNK2 action on HA-pulldown CaMKII-
T286A proteins. (C) Summarized data show alcohol-enhanced CaMKII activity is not 
affected by the mutation of CaMKII oxidative sites Met280/281. (D) Summarized 
quantitative immunoblotting data and representative images show JNK2 inhibition prevented 
alcohol-enhanced phosphorylation of CaMKII (activated) in cultured HL-1 myocytes. 
CaMKII = calmodulin kinase; CaMKII-WT = wildtype CaMKII; CaMKII-T286A = 
CaMKII with Thr287Ala mutation; CaMKII-VV = CaMKII with Met280/281Val mutation;
