SUMMARY
The majority of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-related mutations in the enzyme Cu, Zn 
superoxide dismutase (SOD1), as well as a post-translational modification, glutathionylation, 
destabilize the protein and lead to a misfolded oligomer that is toxic to motor neurons. The 
biophysical role of another physiological SOD1 modification, T2-phosphorylation, has remained a 
mystery. Here, we find that a phosphomimetic mutation, T2D, thermodynamically stabilizes 
SOD1 even in the context of a strongly SOD1-destabilizing mutation, A4V, one of the most 
prevalent and aggressive ALS-associated mutations in North America. This stabilization protects 
against formation of toxic SOD oligomers and positively impacts motor neuron survival in cellular 
assays. We solve the crystal structure of T2D-SOD1 and explain its stabilization effect using DMD 
simulations. These findings imply that T2-phosphorylation may be a plausible innate cellular 
protection response against SOD1-induced cytotoxicity, and stabilizing the SOD1 native 
conformation might offer us viable pharmaceutical strategies against currently incurable ALS.

 INTRODUCTION
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
gradual loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord (Boillee et al., 2006; Cleveland 
and Rothstein, 2001; Redler and Dokholyan, 2012). Currently no effective therapeutics for 
ALS exist (Abel et al., 2012; Ilieva et al., 2009; Israelson et al., 2015). Genomic studies have 
associated approximately 12% of familial ALS cases and 1.5% of sporadic cases with 
mutations in the ubiquitous antioxidant enzyme Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) 
(Cirulli et al., 2015; Rosen et al., 1993). SOD1 aggregates have been discovered in the 
ventral horns of spinal cords from patients with familial or sporadic cases of ALS, indicating 
a contribution of non-genetic factors to disease progression (Shibata et al., 1996; Shibata et 
al., 1994). Recent studies have further implicated non-native SOD1 oligomers, instead of 
large aggregates, as the toxic species in cellular assays (Jonsson et al., 2004; Luchinat et al., 
2014; Proctor et al., 2016; Zetterstrom et al., 2007). Indeed, several disease mutants (e.g. 
A4V and G93A) destabilize SOD1 and promote formation of a trimeric species (Proctor et 
al., 2016; Redler et al., 2014). Aberrant post-translational modifications such as 
glutathionylation, a result of oxidative stress (Barber et al., 2006; Townsend, 2007), also 
increase the rate of SOD1 oligomerization as well as the exposure of a toxicity-associated 
epitope (Bosco et al., 2010; Redler et al., 2014; Redler et al., 2011). Hence, understanding 
how somatic mutations and non-genetic factors affect the stability of the SOD1 dimer and 
non-native oligomers is vital to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Identifying 
mechanisms to stabilize the native conformation of SOD1 and to eliminate potentially toxic 
species can shed light on new venues for drug discovery.
The stability of the SOD1 dimer is affected by ALS-related mutations and several post-
translational modifications, which typically bias the SOD1 misfolding pathway toward 
dimmer dissociation and lead to larger populations of oligomers and aggregates (Broom et 
al., 2016; Khare et al., 2004; Redler et al., 2014). In familial and sporadic ALS cases, post-
translational modifications induced by environmental factors play a significant role in 
disease progression (Barber and Shaw, 2010; Chattopadhyay et al., 2015; Pasinelli and 
Brown, 2006). Specifically, glutathionylation of C111, oxidative modification of W32, and

 phosphorylation of T2 or S58/T59 have been identified in human SOD1 (Coelho et al., 
2014; Wilcox et al., 2009). While C111-glutathionylation and W32-oxidation have been 
studied thoroughly and linked to increased concentrations of non-native oligomers (Coelho 
et al., 2014; Redler et al., 2011), studies on phosphorylation have been limited due to a lack 
of knowledge of the corresponding kinases. A recent study demonstrated that S59-
phosphorylated SOD1 relocates to the nucleus and functions as a transcription factor 
regulating oxidative resistance genes (Tsang et al., 2014). However, the effects of T2-
phosphorylation, especially its impact on protein stability, have remained elusive.
Experimental characterization of phosphorylated SOD1 has been limited due to the inability 
to isolate pure T2-phosphorylated SOD1 or to artificially produce it via kinase reaction 
(Goscin and Fridovich, 1972). Phosphorylated SOD1 can be enriched through ion exchange 
chromatography, but the resulting sample is impure, containing a large proportion of 
unmodified and alternatively phosphorylated SOD1 (T2 or S58/T59) (Wilcox et al., 2009). 
Here we address this problem by producing the phosphomimetic mutant T2D-SOD1. We 
explore the properties of phosphomimetic mutant using a synergistic computational and 
experimental approach. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate similarities 
between T2D-SOD1 and T2-phosphorylated SOD1 in terms of their energetic, 
thermodynamic, and structural characteristics, thus supporting the use of T2D as a 
phosphomimetic mutation. We solve the crystal structure of T2D-SOD1, and find that it 
closely matches the wild type (WT-SOD1) structure (Deng et al., 1993). In agreement with 
our computational predictions, the phosphomimetic T2D mutation stabilizes the SOD1 
dimer without altering its native structure and preserves the same level of cellular viability 
when compared to WT-SOD1. In order to assess the role of phosphorylation in disease, we 
test the ability of the T2D mutation to mitigate the effects of an aggressive ALS mutation 
A4V. By expressing T2D-SOD1, A4V–SOD1 and T2D/A4V–SOD1 in hybridized motor 
neuron cells, we find that the T2D mutation rescues the cytotoxic effect of A4V–SOD1, 
demonstrating the benefit of stabilizing the SOD1 native conformation and offering a 
plausible pharmaceutical strategy to fight ALS.
RESULTS
Computational analysis suggests common characteristics shared by T2-phosphorylated 
SOD1 and T2D-SOD1
We perform all-atom DMD simulations to test whether the physical properties of the 
phosphomimetic mutant T2D-SOD1 reproduce those of T2-phosphorylated SOD1 (Pi-
SOD1). We compare energetic, structural, and thermodynamic signatures of T2D-SOD1 and 
Pi-SOD1 (Figure S1). Specifically, we compare the potential energy distribution of each 
species, which are obtained through replica exchange simulations. The free energy 
histogram contains three distinct peaks representing three co-existing metastable states: a 
native low-energy dimeric structure, a partially unfolded dimer, and dissociated monomers 
with partial unfolding. T2D-SOD1 and Pi-SOD1 both have enriched populations of native 
dimers (peak 1) and decreased populations of dissociated monomers (peak 3) (Figure S1A, 
B), indicating reduced amounts of nonnative states in both species in comparison with the 
unmodified SOD1 (WT-SOD1). We also compare melting temperatures (Tm) corresponding

 to the unfolding of SOD1 monomers through specific heat analysis (Ding and Dokholyan, 
2008). We find that the Tm of both T2D-SOD1 and Pi-SOD1 are lower than that of WT-
SOD1 (Figure S1C, D). Furthermore, Pi-SOD1 exhibits a major peak with a shoulder in the 
specific heat plot against temperature (Figure S1C, D), in contrast to WT-SOD1 that shows a 
single peak in heat capacity. The single peak suggests the dimer dissociation and monomer 
unfolding are coupled processes for unmodified SOD1 and the shoulder peak represents a 
partial decoupling induced by phosphorylation (Proctor et al., 2011). We find that T2D-
SOD1 reproduces this feature by preserving this decoupling. Together these results reveal 
similar monomer and dimer stabilities for T2D-SOD1 and Pi-SOD1.
The T2D-SOD1 dimer is structurally similar to the WT-SOD1 dimer
In order to study the structural effect of the phosphomimetic mutation T2D, we solve the 
crystal structure of T2D-SOD1 to resolution of 2.2 Å (PDB: 5K02, Table 1). Structure 
solution by molecular replacement with the model of WT-SOD1 (PDB: 1SPD) reveals a 
dimeric β-barrel occupying the center of an asymmetric unit (Figure 1). In the T2D-SOD1 
crystals, the packing between the central dimers leads to a ternary complex in space group 
P1 (Figure S2). The structures of T2D-SOD1 and WT-SOD1 are similar to each other. By 
superimposing their backbone and side chains, we find that T2D-SOD1 deviates from WT-
SOD1 with root mean square deviation of 0.93 Å (Figure 1A). This deviation largely 
originates from the flexible loops near the N terminus (Figure 1B). CD spectra also indicate 
that T2D-SOD1 and WT-SOD1 have similar secondary structure composition in solution 
(Figure 1C). To quantitate the rearrangement induced by the T2D mutation, we calculate the 
rotation angles between two monomers using previously described algorithms (Proctor et al., 
2011). For T2D-SOD1 and WT-SOD1 these angles are 36.0° and 33.6°, respectively. Our 
DMD simulation predicts that both the T2D mutation and T2-phosphorylation induces an 
increase in the average monomer-monomer angle (Figure S3), suggesting that the T2D 
mutation may structurally mimic the steric effects of SOD1 phosphorylation at T2. Overall 
the crystal structure confirms that no large rearrangement of subunits or disruption of the 
dimer interface occurs in T2D-SOD1.
T2D mutation promotes the native dimer population in both WT- and A4V–SOD1
Many disease-linked SOD1 mutants undergo dimer dissociation with greater frequency than 
WT-SOD1, leading to an increase in the populations of monomeric species that form the 
available pool for further oligomerization (Broom et al., 2015; Khare and Dokholyan, 2006). 
In contrast, we found that T2D-SOD1 maintained a stable dimer population after incubation 
at 37 °C for up to seven days (Figure 2A). For comparison, WT-SOD1 forms a small 
population of monomeric proteins during the same time period (Figure 2A). 
Glutathionylation at C111 has been shown to promote SOD1 dimer dissociation in both wild 
type and mutant SOD1 (e.g. A4V–SOD1) by inducing steric clashing near the dimer 
interface (Redler et al., 2011; Proctor et al., 2011). The small difference in the monomer-
dimer population distribution between T2D- and WT-SOD1 is exacerbated by 
glutathionylation. As seen previously, glutathionylated WT-SOD1 (GS-WT-SOD1) features 
an increased population of monomer as compared to unmodified WT-SOD1, yielding up to 
50% of the entire protein population after an incubation period of seven days at 37°C 
(Figure 2B). However, GS-T2D-SOD1 and GS-T2D/A4V–SOD1 resist dimer dissociation,

 featuring significantly smaller proportions of monomer than GS-WT-SOD1. Furthermore, 
A4V–SOD1 has previously been shown to have a higher propensity to form both monomer 
and oligomers (Luchinat et al., 2014; Redler et al., 2014). However, no formation of higher 
oligomer is evident in any of the phosphomimetic samples (Figure 2 and Figure S4). These 
results suggest that the phosphomimetic T2D mutation prevents or decreases SOD1 dimer 
dissociation.
T2D mutation strengthens interactions at the SOD1 dimer Interface
In order to explore the mechanism of T2D dimer stabilization, we measure the dimer 
dissociation rates using SPR. In the case of glutathionylation-enriched SOD1 samples, 
Redler, et al showed that reassociation of previously dissociated monomers is inhibited 
(Redler et al., 2011). Together these studies determined the dissociation rate constants for 
WT-SOD1 and A4V–SOD1 as 1.72×10−4 s−1 and 2.60 ×10−3 s−1, respectively, indicating 
that A4V–SOD1 dissociates 15 times faster than does the WT-SOD1. We measure the 
dissociation rate constants for T2D-SOD1 as 1.01×10−4 s−1, approximately half that of WT-
SOD1 (Table 2 and Figure 2C). For the glutathionylation-enriched samples, the rate constant 
of GS-T2D-SOD1 is reduced by a factor of 9 compared to GS-WT-SOD1, indicating GS-
T2D-SOD1 dissociated significantly slower with an average half-time of 1.85 hr, in 
comparison to a half-time of 0.29 hr for GS-WT-SOD1 (Table 2 and Figure 2D). The 
dissociation rates of unmodified and glutathionylated T2D/A4V–SOD1 are similar to the 
respective values for T2D-SOD1 (16 times slower than A4V–SOD1), indicating an overall 
decrease in dimer dissociation consistent with our results from size exclusion 
chromatography. Because dimer dissociation and subsequent metal loss induce the structural 
distortions that promote protein aggregation, the decrease we find in dimer dissociation upon 
phosphomimetic T2D mutation suggests that phosphorylation at T2 may inhibit the 
formation of toxic SOD1 oligomers (Proctor et al., 2016).
T2D mutation rescues cell viability in the context of an FALS mutation A4V
In order to gain an understanding of the physiological relevance of the phosphomimetic 
mutant SOD1 in cellular environment, we overexpress T2D-SOD1 and WT-SOD1 in 
immortalized mouse motor neuron-like cells (NSC-34) with similar expression levels for 
wild type and mutants (Figure 3) (Cashman et al., 1992). We measure the cell viability using 
propidium iodide to mark non-viable cells, in concert with Hoescht staining of viable cells 
(Figure 3A) (Latt and Stetten, 1976; Moore et al., 1998). Overexpression of T2D-SOD1 and 
WT-SOD1 yield cell death rates of 7% and 6%, respectively (Figure 3B), which are identical 
results within experimental error. For a disease-relevant comparison, we similarly 
overexpress an aggressive ALS mutant A4V–SOD1 and the double mutant T2D/A4V–SOD1 
in NSC-34 cells. While A4V–SOD1 expression results in 20% cell death, T2D/A4V–SOD1 
expression results in only 6% cell death, demonstrating the ability of the T2D mutation to 
rescue toxicity of one of the most aggressive ALS-associated SOD1 variants. Supporting this 
finding, we find that cells expressing SOD1 with the A4V mutation alone feature high 
expression of the apoptotic marker caspase3, in agreement with the known toxicity of the 
A4V–SOD1 mutant, while cells transfected with T2D/A4V–SOD1 express lower levels of 
caspase3, similar to the levels expressed by cells transfected with WT-SOD1 (Figure 3C).

 These results indicate that the T2D mutation ameliorates cytotoxicity in the context of a 
severe ALS related mutation.
Possible destabilizing effect of the T2D mutation on SOD1 trimers
Since cytotoxicity in motor neuron-like cells is found to correlate with the propensity of 
forming trimeric SOD1 (Proctor et al., 2016), we study the effect of T2D mutation on the 
stability of toxic SOD1 trimers. We use structural models of the trimer proposed by Proctor 
et al (Proctor et al., 2016) to computationally evaluate the change in free energy upon 
mutation (ΔΔGmut) using the Eris molecular design suite (Yin et al., 2007a, b). The T2D 
mutation destabilizes the SOD1 trimer structure (ΔΔGmut = 2.9 kcal/mol) (Figure S5), while 
the A4V mutation stabilizes the trimer (ΔΔGmut = −4.8 kcal/mol), in accordance with 
experimental observations (Redler et al., 2014). When combined in the same structure, the 
T2D mutation rescues the trimer-stabilizing effect of the A4V mutation (ΔΔGmut = 1.2 kcal/
mol), suggesting that not only is the T2D mutation stabilizing to the native SOD1 dimer 
structure, but also inhibits formation of the toxic trimeric form by making the trimer 
structure less stable. Therefore, the phosphomimetic T2D mutation has a profound effect on 
SOD1 stability: by both stabilizing native dimer and destabilizing the toxic trimer states, this 
mutation strongly inhibits formation of toxic oligomers and promotes significant increase in 
cell viability.
Previous studies indicate that ALS-associated mutations and aberrant post-translational 
modifications can disrupt the dynamic coupling between SOD1 monomers, which leads to 
disruption of stabilizing structural elements (the β-plug and zinc-binding loop) and global 
destabilization of the native state (Ding and Dokholyan, 2008; Khare and Dokholyan, 2006). 
To understand whether and how phosphomimetic mutation affect the dynamics of SOD1 
dimer on a nanosecond time scale, we have performed short (50 ns) DMD simulations and 
observed different dynamic signatures of WT-SOD1, T2D-SOD1, T2D/A4V–SOD1, and 
A4V–SOD1 (Figure 4 and Figure S6). In contrast to WT, T2D, and T2D/A4V, the A4V 
mutation leads to higher fluctuation of the residues at dimer interface, as measured by root 
mean square fluctuation in the DMD trajectories (Figure 4). Specifically, V148-V148 and 
F50-I151 are key hydrophobic contacts between the SOD1 monomers. We observe high 
flexibility of Val148 and Ile 151 only in the A4V–SOD1 (Figure 4B, green dash line). We 
also find that T2/A4 and V148/151 have cross-correlated motions in the inter-residue 
covariance matrix (Figure S6), which indicates that the packing strain induced by the T2D or 
A4V mutation can affect these residues. The A4V mutation likely induces steric clash at the 
interface or weakens the V148-V148 and F50-I151 interactions, whereas in T2D-SOD1 and 
T2D/A4V–SOD1 these interactions are stable (Figure 4C, D). This observation is consistent 
with the high propensity of A4V–SOD1 to dissociate and form monomers in comparison 
with WT-SOD1, T2D-SOD1 and T2D/A4V–SOD1. Furthermore, we find strong 
correlations within the zinc-binding loop (residues 49–60) only in A4V–SOD1, whereas in 
WT-, T2D-, and T2D/A4V–SOD1 these correlated motions are suppressed (Figure S6). The 
zinc-binding loop has been suggested to allosterically regulate the conformation of the C4F6 
epitope (Bosco et al., 2010), which is directly linked to neural-toxicity of SOD1 in a primary 
microglia activation assay (Furukawa et al., 2015; Rotunno et al., 2014). We propose that in 
A4V–SOD1 the cross-correlated motions promote the exposure of the disease-related

 epitope, and that the T2D/A4V double mutant prevents this effect. These effects may lead to 
the differential cytotoxicity observed in cells transfected with A4V–SOD1 and T2D/A4V–
SOD1.
DISCUSSION
Recent studies suggest that non-native SOD1 oligomers are the cytotoxic species that 
promote disease progression and cause motor neuron degeneration in SOD1-mediated ALS 
(Jonsson et al., 2004; Proctor et al., 2016; Zetterstrom et al., 2007). The formation of SOD1 
oligomers and aggregates is critically dependent on the dissociation of the native dimer into 
monomers, a process exacerbated by disease-linked mutations (Ding et al., 2012; Ivanova et 
al., 2014; Khare et al., 2004b). By reducing the population of SOD1 monomers, the 
formation of cytotoxic oligomers can be inhibited. Our findings demonstrate that the T2D 
mutation, which mimics phosphorylation at T2, increases the stability of the native 
conformation of SOD1 and reduces the cytotoxic effect of A4V–SOD1 in motor neuron-like 
cells. Furthermore, we suggest that T2-phosphorylation may be an intrinsic protective 
mechanism that stabilizes cytosolic SOD1. Our simulations and structural calculations for 
T2D-SOD1 and Pi-SOD1 not only demonstrate the stabilizing effect of the T2D mutation, 
but also establish the high degree of structural and energetic similarity between the 
phosphomimetic T2D-SOD1 construct and phosphorylated WT-SOD1. Quantitative analysis 
of the crystal structure of T2D reveals that T2D-SOD1 has a larger monomer-monomer 
angle in comparison to WT-SOD1, as predicted for the Pi-SOD1 (Figure S4). We also 
measure the thermal melting temperature (Tm) for T2D-SOD1 and find that T2D-SOD1 has 
a lower Tm than WT-SOD1 (T2D-SOD1: 79.8°C, WT-SOD1: 81.5°C) (Table 2 and Figure 2 
E , F), which agrees with the shift of corresponding specific heat (Cv) peak to a lower 
temperature for Pi-SOD1 (Figure S1C, D). Based on these results, we posit that T2-
phosphorylation of SOD1 has similar biophysical characteristics to T2D-SOD1 and 
stabilizes the native conformation of SOD1 dimer.
T2-phosphorylation and C111-glutathionylation have been identified as the dominant post-
translational modifications to SOD1 in human erythrocytes (Wilcox et al., 2009). It is 
plausible that the phosphorylation is an intrinsic mechanism to offset the impact of oxidative 
stress or other deleterious effects on the SOD1 structure. The late onset of ALS symptoms 
(∼55 years old on average) suggests that such mechanisms may have evolved to protect the 
native SOD1 dimer (Ilieva et al., 2009; Redler and Dokholyan, 2012). Given the high 
cytosolic concentration (30–100 µM) of SOD1, a balancing mechanism that would offset 
environmental stressors, such as oxidative stress, may be important for the stability and 
function of SOD1 (Jaarsma et al., 2000). The protective role of phosphorylation has been 
discovered in other neurodegenerative diseases. In a rat model of Parkinson`s disease, 
researchers have applied phosphomimetic mutations and suggested phosphorylation at S87 
inhibits the aggregation of human α-synuclein and protects against its toxicity (Oueslati et 
al., 2012). However, the roles of phosphorylation in neurodegenerative diseases are usually 
deleterious. Phosphorylation can promote the spreading of β-amyloid in Alzheimer 
pathogenesis (Rezaei-Ghaleh et al., 2016), reduce binding of Tau-protein to microtubules 
and correlate with severity of neuronal cytopathology (Augustinack et al., 2002; Lindwall 
and Cole, 1984). Together our findings and other studies reveal that while C111-

 glutathionylation promotes dimer dissociation by inhibiting the association of SOD1 
monomers (decreased kon) (McAlary et al., 2013; Redler et al., 2011), T2-phosphorylation 
may inhibit dimer dissociation by stabilizing the dimer interface (decreased koff) (Figure 5).
SOD1 represents a common factor in both familial and sporadic cases of ALS (Pasinelli and 
Brown, 2006; Renton et al., 2014). While most familial mutations destabilize SOD1, our 
work demonstrates the contrasting influence of a phosphomimetic mutation that stabilizes 
the native dimer and ameliorates toxicity induced by an aggressive disease mutation. 
Therefore, stimulating SOD1 phosphorylation in motor neurons or developing drugs to 
mimic the effects of T2D mutation may offer promising new directions for development of 
therapeutic strategies. The inhibition of small oligomer formation for disease-linked proteins 
represents a pharmaceutical approach broadly applicable to many neurodegenerative 
disorders (Haass and Selkoe, 2007; Kirkitadze et al., 2002). For SOD1, oligomerization and 
aggregation are proportional to the fraction of monomers (Khare et al., 2004). Researchers 
have developed various strategies to stabilize SOD1 dimer, including co-expression of 
chaperones and small molecule binding (Bruening et al., 1999; Limpert et al., 2013; Naik et 
al., 2012). T2D-SOD1 features a significantly reduce the population of monomers and 
oligomers, which underlies its beneficial effect to motor neuron-like cells. Hence, 
identification of T2D as a stabilizing mutation suggests new avenues for therapy 
development in currently incurable ALS.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Modeling of phosphorylated SOD1 and phosphomimetic mutants
All-atom discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) is a molecular dynamics algorithm that 
utilizes discrete step functions in place of continuous potentials to describe interaction 
energies between particles in a simulation (Ding et al., 2008; Proctor et al., 2011). The all-
atom protein model features explicit modeling of all heavy atoms, polar hydrogens, and a 
reaction-based hydrogen bonding potential. We obtained the known structure of SOD1 from 
the Protein Data Bank (PDB: 1SPD, 1UXM) and performed computational mutagenesis 
using the Eris suite (Yin et al., 2007a, b). We made no structural adjustment to residues 
participating in metal-binding or disulfide bond interactions. Following mutation, we 
minimized the structure using an iterative relaxation and equilibration protocol (Proctor et 
al., 2011). We performed single-temperature and replica exchange DMD simulations of the 
optimized T2D-SOD1 structure. In the monomer species, we used 12 replicas for a 
simulation length of 100 ns at temperatures of 0.5 (∼252 K), 0.52 (∼262 K), 0.54 (∼272 K), 
0.56 (∼282 K), 0.58 (∼292 K), 0.60 (∼302 K), 0.62 (∼312 K), 0.64 (∼322 K), 0.66 (∼332 
K), 0.68 (∼343 K), 0.70 (∼353 K), and 0.72 (∼363 K) kcal mol−1. In the dimer species, we 
used 16 replicas for a simulation of 50 ns at temperatures of 0.48 (∼242 K), 0.495 (∼249 K), 
0.51 (∼257 K), 0.525 (∼264 K), 0.54 (∼272 K), 0.555 (∼280 K), 0.57 (∼287 K), 0.585 
(∼295 K), 0.60 (∼302 K), 0.615 (∼310 K), 0.63 (∼317 K), 0.645 (∼325 K), 0.65 (∼327 K), 
0.67 (∼337 K), 0.69 (∼347 K), and 0.71 (∼357 K) kcal (mol kB)−1. While the temperatures 
used in MD simulations do not equate directly with physical temperatures, they can be used 
to evaluate relative changes in physical temperature. We combined replica trajectories using 
weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) (Kumar et al., 1992). We utilized the

Cloning, expression, and purification of SOD1
We produced the SOD1 mutant vectors (T2D-SOD1, A4V–SOD1 and T2D/A4V–SOD1) 
with a Stratagene mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, CA) following the provided 
protocol. Expression, purification, and separation of modified populations were carried out 
as described previously (Goscin and Fridovich, 1972; Wilcox et al., 2009).
Circular dichroism (CD) and thermal melting points analysis
We collected CD spectroscopy data using a Chirascan Plus instrument (Applied 
Photophysics, MA). We dialyzed protein samples against 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) 
and diluted them to 0.2 mg/mL for analysis. CD spectra were measured from 260 nm to 185 
nm at 20°C with 50,000 readings taken at each 0.5 nm increment. Melting curves were 
monitored from 20°C to 94°C at 205 nm. The apparent melting temperature was determined 
by fitting to a two-state model (Zhu et al., 2013).
Size exclusion chromatography
We prepared the samples (8.8 µM SOD1 in 20 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and 
incubated them at 37°C for 0 hr, 24 hr, or 7 days. After incubation the samples were 
analyzed using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, PA) described 
previously (Redler et al., 2011).
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
SOD1 samples were biotinylated on one subunit using the EZ-link NHS-LC-LC-biotin 
linker (Life Technologies, CA) (Khare et al., 2004). We then dialyzed the biotinylated SOD1 
into PBS buffer (40 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) before loading onto a SA chip 
(Biorad, CA). Dimer dissociation was monitored for WT-SOD1, T2D-SOD1 and T2D/A4V–
SOD1 samples using the Proteon XPR36 (Bio-Rad, CA) at 25 °C. The dissociation reaction 
was initiated by flowing PBS buffer with 0.005% Tween 20 over the SA chip. Each SPR 
curve is an average of six independent measurements Data was analyzed as describe 
previously (Redler et al., 2011).
Crystallization, data collection, and model building
Crystallization of T2D was accomplished using a hanging drop vapor diffusion method 
against a well buffer. T2D was crystallized in a buffer of 2 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M Sodium 
Cacodylate, 20% MPD and 10 mM ZnCl2 (pH 6.5) after a period of approximately 5 
months.
The T2D crystals were transferred into the well buffer plus 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant 
and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The X-ray diffraction data of T2D crystal were 
collected at 100K on Beamline X29 at Brookhaven National Laboratory. We processed the 
raw data with HKL2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The structure of SOD T2D was 
solved by molecular replacement method (Navaza and Saludjian, 1997). We then performed 
the refinement with Program Refmac5 in CCP4 Suite (Murshudov et al., 2011). The resulted

 model was rebuilt by program O (Jones et al., 1991) and further refined by Chiron 
(Ramachandran et al., 2011).
Cell culture, transfection, and cell viability assay
We maintained the NSC-34 cells in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium growth medium 
containing 10% FBS (Cashman et al., 1992). We plated approximately 5000 NSC 34 cells in 
one well of 24-well format plate with differentiation medium (1% FBS+NEAA+10 µM 
Retinoid Acid). After two days of differentiation, we transfected cells with 2 µg of pCI neo 
WT SOD1 or pCI neo SOD1 mutants using Lipofectamine 3000 following the 
manufacturer’s instruction. We performed propidium iodide (for dead cells) and Hoechst 
(for all cells) staining (Fisher Scientific, PA) 3 days post transfection without fixation (Latt 
and Stetten, 1976). We fixed the cells 24 hours post-transfection for immunostaining. For 
Western blot, we used approximately 20,000 cells per well of 6-well format and collected 
the cells 2 days post-transfection.
Immunoblotting and immunostaining
We performed Western blotting as previously described (Tao et al., 2011). Briefly, cell 
lysates were denatured in SDS loading buffer, resolved by 18% or 4–20% SDS-PAGE and 
transferred to a PVDF membrane. Then we incubated the membranes with antibodies 
against cCaspase3 (Cell Signaling Technology, MA), SOD1 (Calbiochem, MA) and 
GAPDH, followed by secondary antibody incubation (Moore et al., 1998). The protein 
bands were visualized with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, NE). 
The expression level of cCaspase 3 was normalized using ImageJ.

 In Brief
SOD1 destabilization and misfolding are associated with the fatal neurodegenerative 
disease ALS. Fay and Zhu et al. report the discovery of a phosphomimetic mutation, 
T2D, which stabilizes SOD1 and rescues the cytotoxic effect of an ALS-associated 
mutant.

 Figure 3. T2D mutation reduces the cytotoxic effect of A4V in motor neuron-like cells
(A) Transfection of NSC-34 cells with T2D-SOD1 and WT-SOD1 (negative control) led to 
similar cell death ratio. A4V–SOD1 transfection (positive control) decreased cell viability 
and T2D/A4V–SOD1 rescued cells from A4V–SOD1 mediated cytotoxicity. Applied three 
days post-transfection, red stain (propidium iodide) identifies dead cells, while blue stain 
(Hoechst) identifies all cell population. (B) Average cell death rates are measured as the 
percentage of red stained cells: WT 5.4%, T2D 5.6%, A4V 20.7% and T2D/A4V 6.0%. 
Each bar represents the standard error of the mean, n=3. (C) Levels of the apoptotic marker 
cCaspase 3 in NSC-34 cells demonstrated by western blot confirm the protection role of

 T2D mutation, as T2D/A4V leads to reduced expression of cCaspase 3. The normalized 
expression levels: WT 100%, T2D 89%, A4V 377% and T2D/A4V 135%.

 Figure 4. DMD simulation suggests the key interface interactions are disrupted in A4V–SOD1, in 
contrast to WT-, T2D- and T2D/A4V–SOD1
The flexibility of the protein backbone is measured as root mean square fluctuation (RMSF, 
Red: 3.5 Å, Blue: 0.5 Å) and the results are an average of ten DMD trajectories: (A) WT-
SOD1, (B) A4V–SOD1, (C) T2D-SOD1 and (D) T2D/A4V–SOD1. The hydrophobic 
contact between V148-V148 is indicated as green dash line. The zinc-binding loop (Zn-
loop) which allosterically modulates the C4F6 epitope is indicated in the WT-SOD1 
structure. See also Figure S5 and S6.

 Figure 5. A proposed mechanism of the regulation of dimer-monomer equilibrium in SOD1 by 
post-translational modifications
T2-Phosphorylation and C-111 glutathionylation may regulate the dimer-monomer 
equilibrium and have opposing effects on the stability of native SOD1 dimers. The T2D 
mutation (or T2-Phosphorylation) inhibits the dimer dissociation (decreased koff), whereas 
C111-glutathionylation inhibits the association of monomers (decreased kon).

Biophysical characterization of T2D-, T2D/A4V- and WT-SOD1
T2D, T2D/A4V and WT indicate unmodified species, GS-T2D, GS-T2D/A4V and GS-WT indicate C111-
glutathionylation enriched species. Thermal melting temperatures (Tm) for the unfolding process of SOD1 
monomers were measured by circular dichroism thermal denaturation. Dimer dissociation rate constants (koff) 
were measured by surface plasmon resonance. The standard deviation is indicated with ±.
