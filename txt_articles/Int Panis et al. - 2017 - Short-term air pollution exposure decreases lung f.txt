Abstract
Background: Daily changes in ambient concentrations of particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and ozone are
associated with increased cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality, with the lungs and their function being a
vulnerable target.
Methods: To evaluate the association between daily changes in air pollution and lung function in healthy adults
we obtained annual lung function measurements from a routine worker health surveillance program not designed
for research purposes. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC
and Peak Expiratory flow (PEF) from a cohort of 2449 employees were associated with daily measurements of PM10,
NO2 and ozone at a nearby monitoring station in the North of Belgium. Repeated measures were available for the
period 2011–2015.
Results: The mean (SD) PM10 concentration on the day of the lung function test was 24.9 (15.5) μg/m3. A 10 μg
PM10/m3 increase on the day of the clinical examination was associated with a 18.9 ml lower FVC (95% CI: -27.5 to
−10.3, p < 0.0001), 12.8 ml lower FEV1 (−19.1 to −6.5; p < 0.0001), and a 51.4 ml/s lower PEF (−75.0 to −27.0; p < 0.
0001). The FEV1/FVC-ratio showed no associations. An increase of 10 μgNO2/m3 was associated with a reduction in
PEF (−66.1 ml/s (−106.6 to −25.6; p < 0.001)) on the day of the examination.
Conclusions: We found negative associations between daily variations in ambient air pollution and FVC, FEV1 and
PEF in healthy adults.

Background
Air pollution exposure contributes to all-cause morbidity
and mortality. Epidemiological studies indicate that
short-term exposure to increased fine particulate matter
concentration triggers negative health effects. Inhaled
particles can affect the cardiopulmonary system, eventu-
ally leading to atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction,
stroke, chronic lung diseases, and a wide range of other
clinical and subclinical effects [1, 2].
The short-term effects of air pollution exposure on
lung function have predominantly been investigated in
vulnerable subgroups such as children and asthmatics.
Zwozdziak et al. [3] reported small FEV1 reductions in
healthy children associated with PM1 and PM2.5 expos-
ure [3]. In a landmark study in London, traffic-related
air pollution exposure immediately induced adverse pul-
monary effects in adult asthmatics [4]. Walking for 2 h
on Oxford Street consistently reduced forced expiratory
volume during the first second (FEV1) and forced vital
capacity (FVC). Forced expiratory flow was negatively
associated with fine particulate matter with a diameter
smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and traffic-related nitrogen
dioxide (NO2) concentrations, whereas FEV1 and FVC
were most consistently associated with ultrafine particles

 and elemental carbon. Since then, observational studies
have accumulated evidence about the association be-
tween selected outdoor air pollutants and worsening of
asthma symptoms [5, 6]. A recent meta-analysis of panel
studies in COPD patients revealed that a10 μgPM10/m3
increase in ambient levels had a small, but statistically
significant impact on FEV1 and peak expiratory flow
(PEF), but also showed significant heterogeneity across
the included studies [7].
Less is known about the acute subclinical effects of air
pollution on healthy individuals. Acute lung function
reduction was observed after exposure to relatively high
levels of PM2.5 and BC in a small panel of traffic police
[8]. Rice et al. [9] found effects on FEV1 in relation to
short-term exposure to relatively low levels of PM2.5,
NO2 and ozone in 3262 healthy participants in the
Framingham Heart Study which disappeared after 48 h.
Other experimental studies of acute and personal expos-
ure found no or weak associations with lung function
but were underpowered [10–12].
We assessed the associations of selected air pollutants
(PM10 and NO2 and ozone) and lung function in a large
retrospective cohort of healthy adult workers, using a
repeated measures design. This study adds to the evi-
dence base of respiratory effects caused by air pollution
because it was carried out on healthy adults working in
a rural area with relatively low concentrations i.e. below
the EU limit values, but above the levels proposed by
the WHO.
Methods
Study design
This retrospective cohort study used data from the
occupational
medical
surveillance
program
of
the
Belgian Nuclear Research Centre (SCK●CEN) in Mol
(Belgium). All employees of the organizations SCK●CEN,
VITO, BELGOPROCESS, BELGONUCLEAIRE and the
European School undergo an annual check-up at the
SCK●CEN medical centre, including a lung function test
based on spirometry. Medical examinations are routinely
performed on weekdays in the morning between 8 am and
12 am. We obtained repeated lung function measure-
ments from 2449 adults over a 4-year period between 26/
01/2011 and 30/01/2015. The ethics board of University
Hospital Antwerp approved the study. All participant in-
formation was anonymized and de-identified prior to ana-
lysis. No informed consent from the participants was
required for the present analysis.
Lung function
Lung function was measured using a Vitalograph Pneu-
motrac (Ennis, U.K.) in a standing posture, but otherwise
following the most recent guidelines by the European
Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society
with respect to lung function testing in occupational set-
tings [13, 14]. The same device was used throughout the
study. Participants were supervised and coached by one of
the three trained nurses in this medical surveillance pro-
gram. Participants performed three respiratory manoeu-
vres (maximum exhalation) during the clinical visits in the
years 2011, 2012 and 2013. Because of the high reproduci-
bility of the measurements, most of the participants per-
formed only two manoeuvres in the years 2014 and 2015.
Quality of the manoeuvres and lung function parameters
were obtained with the Vitalograph Pneumotrac software.
Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume
in the first second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio and Peak Ex-
piratory Flow (PEF) were obtained.
A measuring session was considered usable when at
least two manoeuvres, free from artefacts, passed the
test acceptability criteria (quality grade C). A session
with a maximum difference between two FEV1 values of
150 mL and a maximum difference between two FVC
values of 150 mL was graded as A; when only the former
was met, the quality was graded B. The highest volume
parameters
from
usable
tests
were
retained.
The
manoeuvre having the largest FEV1 + FVC sum was re-
corded and used for all other parameters in this study.
Further information on the use of the Vitalograph can
be found in the operation manual provided by the
manufacturer.
Air pollution exposure assessment
Ambient air pollution levels were measured at an official
air quality monitoring station of the Flanders Environment
Agency (VMM) in Dessel (station number 42 N016), lo-
cated 6 km east from the SCK●CEN medical centre. This
background monitoring station is located near the cross-
ing of two canals that are mainly used for recreation. The
monitoring station and the SCK●CEN medical centre are
both situated in a rural environment without any major
local air pollution sources. The nearest road with car traf-
fic is ~1 km to the south east and the nearest major road
(with some heavy vehicles) is about 1.5 km to the east
(downwind). Validated daily concentrations for particulate
matter with diameter smaller than 10 μm (PM10; Thermo
Andersen ESM FH 62 I-R), nitrogen dioxide (NO2; Ther-
moFisher Model 42i) and ozone (O3; Teledyne API Model
T400) were obtained. Air pollution exposure was calcu-
lated as the average exposure during the day of each clin-
ical visit (lag 0), the day before (lag 1) or 2 days before (lag
2) the clinical visit. The 24-h mean outdoor temperature
and humidity were obtained from the meteorological sta-
tion Antwerpen-Luchtbal (station number T2 M802, ap-
proximately 50 km away from the air quality monitoring
station) and used to calculate the apparent temperature
with the August-Roche-Magnus approximation.

 Statistical analysis
SAS software (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,
USA) was used for database management and statistical
analysis. The effect of short-term air pollution exposure
on lung function parameters was investigated using the
MIXED procedure to account for the clustered data
within the same person, i.e. repeated lung function tests.
A random intercept model was used and the coefficients
and standard errors were estimated under restricted
maximum likelihood estimation (REML) with unstruc-
tured autocorrelation.
The effects of PM10, NO2, and O3 were evaluated in
separate models, with adjustment for an a priori chosen
list of covariates including sex, age, age2, body mass
index (BMI), smoking status (current-former-never),
quality grade of the lung function test (A-B-C), apparent
temperature, hour of the day, day of the week, month
and year of the lung function test. All variables were
time-variant except sex. Q-Q plots of the residuals were
used to test the assumptions of the model. Estimates are
given as ml change in FVC or FEV1, percent change in
FEV1/FVC ratio or ml/s change in PEF associated with a
10 μg/m3 increase in PM10, NO2 or O3. Analyses for
ozone were restricted to the warm season (May to
September) when impacts were considered most likely.
Stratification by sex, age, smoking status and influenza
season was done to perform secondary analyses. Finally,
mixed models that included terms for within- and
between-subject air pollution exposure were fitted in
addition to the main model because we considered the
possibility of differences in between- and within-subject
air pollution effects.
Results
The age of the 2449 participants ranged between 16 and
70 years, with an average of 37 (Inter Quartile Range
(IQR) = 18) years when entering the study. The average
Body Mass Index (BMI) was 25.4 kg/m2 (IQR = 4.8). The
study included 1756 (72%) male participants. The majority
(94%) was Caucasian. A total of 1739 (71%) participants
were non-smokers, 342 (14%) were current smokers, and
368 (15%) reported to be former smokers. For 98% of the
sample, the smoking status did not change during the
study period. On average, 37% received free influenza im-
munisation. More details about the study population are
given in Table 1. The majority of the participants were of-
fice workers with a college degree and similar socio-
economic background. A few participants were blue-collar
workers. No additional profiling details could be obtained
due to the prior anonymization of the dataset.
A total of 5404 clinical visits with lung function test were
obtained for the 2449 participants. Most visits were sched-
uled on a Monday (22%), Tuesday (26%) or Wednesday
(21%). Fewer visits were scheduled on Thursday (16%) or
Friday (15%). 49% of the sessions were graded A, 15% B
and 36% C, respectively. Most participants (35%) had 3
valid measurements during the study period; 28% had 2
and 25% had a single valid measurement; while 12% had
more than 3 valid measurements. The clinical examina-
tions with the lung function tests were on average
435 ± 92 days apart from each other. The FVC ranged
from 1.89 to 10.84 L with an average of 4.71 L (IQR = 1.49).
The average FVC for males and females was 5.06 and
3.67 L, respectively. FEV1 ranged from 0.9 to 7.35 L with
an average of 3.79 L (IQR = 1.18). Additional anthropo-
metric and pulmonary characteristics of the study popula-
tion are given in Additional file 4: Table S1.
The average concentration of PM10, NO2 and O3 on the
day of the clinical visit (lag 0) were 24.9 ± 15.5 μg/m3,
23.1 ± 9.6 μg/m3 and 44.3 ± 19.0 μg/m3, respectively (Table
2). Values for the other exposure lags are given in Table 2.
Average annual concentrations of PM10 and NO2 were well
below the European limit values of 40 μg/m3 during the
entire study period (Additional file 5: Table S2). Daily aver-
age concentrations exceeded 50 μg PM10/m3 on 26, 18, 14
and 13 days in the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, re-
spectively. This was well below the European regulatory
limit of 35 days/year but above the WHO recommended
maximum of 3 days/year. Also for ozone, the target value
for protection of human health was not exceeded during
the study period, i.e. the number of days per calendar year
on which the daily maximum 8-h average O3 concentra-
tion exceeded the level of 120 μg/m3 was below 25.

 A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 concentration on the
same day (lag 0) as the lung function test was signifi-
cantly associated with a 18.9 ml lower FVC, a 12.8 ml
lower FEV1 and a 51.4 ml/s lower PEF (all p-values
<0.0001). Comparable significant changes were ob-
served for FVC, FEV1 and PEF in association with
PM10 exposure 1 day (lag 1) and 2 days (lag 2) before
the clinical visit (Table 3). In addition, a 10 μg NO2/m3
increase was associated with significantly lower PEF
values (−66.1 ml/s, −66.0 ml/s and −99 ml/s) for lag 0,
lag 1 and lag 2 respectively, as well as with lower FEV1
(−13.8 ml) at lag 0. Similar FEV1 reductions were seen
at lag 1 and lag 2.
FVC and FEV1/FVC were not significantly associated
with NO2 exposure. None of the lung function outcomes
were significantly associated with O3. Although some re-
sults reach borderline significance, overall results for
ozone were inconclusive.
We conducted secondary analyses to investigate the
effect of sex, age (older or younger than 30) and smok-
ing status on each of the lung outcome parameters. We
did not find evidence for a differential effect of sex or
smoking status on our main outcomes, see Fig. 1 for the
association between PM10 and FVC (all other figures are
provided as Additional file 1: Figure S1, Additional file 2:
Figure S2 and Additional file 3: Figure S3). Sensitivity
analyses excluding people who changed smoking status
and excluding measurements made during the influenza
season did not affect the conclusions (data not shown).
Models to differentiate between within- and between-
subject specific effects were evaluated. Results from
these models showed that the reported associations are
driven by within-subject effects, which were statistically
significant and similar in effect size compared to the re-
sults from the main analyses, while the between-subject
effects were not significant (data not shown).

 Discussion
This repeated measures study in a population of working
adults finds consistent associations between several pa-
rameters of lung function and short-term variation in
PM10 and NO2, but not ozone. The observed effect sizes
for particulate air pollution are small but they may still
have an important public health impact [15]. For in-
stance, in epidemiology they have been shown to be in-
dependent indicators of all-cause mortality [16, 17],
although spirometry markers alone are not seen as a
strict or single criterion to determine lung disease in a
clinical setting.
Large cohort studies have mainly looked at the effects
of long-term air pollution exposure on lung function. In
the Framingham Heart Study and ESCAPE, each 10 μg/
m3 increase in (long-term) PM10 exposure was associ-
ated with a reduction in FVC of respectively 65 ml and
59 ml [18, 19]. Assuming that 1 μg/m3 PM2.5 corre-
sponds to 1.43 μg/m3 PM10 [20], our short-term associa-
tions between FVC and FEV1 and exposure to gaseous
pollutants
(NO2)
are
smaller
than
the
long-term
associations reported by aforementioned studies. How-
ever, other studies have also reported smaller effect
sizes for acute effects [9, 19]. The fact that short-term
effects are smaller than those reported for long-term
air pollution exposure might be suggestive for a cumu-
lative effect of air pollution exposure. Similar to the re-
sults of the Framingham Heart study cohort, we did
not find an association between air pollution and the
FEV1/FVC ratio [18, 21].
The fact that we observe an association between lung
function and air pollution exposure on the same day is
remarkable, but is also known for other impacts. A large
recent review found that air pollution increased the risk
of stroke significantly on the day of maximum exposure
to air pollution, with risk decreasing on following days,
demonstrating a clear short-term association [2]. In
addition, a multicentre panel study found that short-
term increases in particulate matter and ozone can
worsen respiratory symptoms of patients with asthma
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [22].
There are several strengths to underline in this study.
We used a repeated measures design in a relatively large
dataset from
a homogenous
population of
healthy
workers normally not considered to be vulnerable to
current levels of air pollution in Belgium. A homoge-
neous study population reduces between-individual vari-
ability
and
further
increases
statistical
power;
the
longitudinal
study
design
(within-subject
repeated
measures) improves statistical efficiency by reducing po-
tential confounding by personal characteristics that do
not vary over time. Spirometry measurements were al-
ways made with the same instrument and on the same
time of day (8 am–10 am), which excludes between in-
strument and within-day variations in pulmonary func-
tion [23, 24]. In addition, the subjects were unaware of
the objectives of our the study, which makes participation
bias very unlikely. The effects persisted when the analysis
was repeated for smaller subgroups such as current and
former smokers and women. The effect of air pollution
exposure on FVC and FEV1 appeared to be the same in
men and women; this is in line with Rice et al. [9] who
also found no difference between men and women.
There are, however, several limitations to be men-
tioned as well. NO2 is a traffic-related pollutant that is
known to exhibit a large spatial variation in concentra-
tion. Because the monitoring station used is situated
6 km from the study centre and many participants trav-
elled by car or bicycle to the examination on the same
morning, there is likely more exposure misclassification
for this pollutant than for PM10, which is more homoge-
neous over time and space. This may have biased our ef-
fect size for NO2 towards the null and may explain the
difference with the ESCAPE study, which used land use
regression models to estimate NO2 exposure at each

 participant’s residential address. Residential addresses
were not made available in our study, nor was the travel
history prior to the medical examination recorded. In
this study, we could not use personal monitoring devices
to measure the actual air pollution exposure due to the
large cohort size. In the future, automated BC and PM2.5
measurements will continue at the air pollution moni-
toring site as will the lung function measurements. This
will increase the power to detect associations with these
pollutants, as well as provide the opportunity to deter-
mine the relationship between ageing and lung function
decline. Another important limitation, is that we were
unable to include asthmatic status of the members of
the cohort. Asthmatic status and other clinical data were
recorded in written medical files, which could not be
digitized and anonymized for this study. Another weak-
ness is that the spirometry protocol was modified during
the study. In 2011–2013 three manoeuvres were per-
formed, and in 2014–2015 only two, which is a deviation
from ERS/ATS guidelines. Spirometry results from the
second period may therefore be less accurate than in the
first period, but sensitivity analyses suggest that it is un-
likely to have affected our main finding.
The results for this apparently healthy group of adults
are novel because few panel studies have looked at
healthy adults. Routinely collected data from occupa-
tional health surveys can be a valuable source of re-
search data, and using it should not be discouraged, as
long as its limitations are recognised and appropriately
discussed. Results cannot be extrapolated to other more
vulnerable groups such as children, elderly or people
with chronic conditions that prevent them to work. Fi-
nally, we have not looked into possible physiological
pathways for the effects observed in this study.
Conclusions
Short-term variation in particulate air pollution affects
lung function in healthy adults in an area with concen-
trations below the European air quality limit but above
the WHO threshold.
