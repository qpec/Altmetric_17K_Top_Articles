SUMMARY
T cells can be re-directed to kill cancer cells using
chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or T cell receptors
(TCRs). This approach, however, is constrained by
the rarity of tumor-specific single antigens. Targeting
antigens also found on bystander tissues can cause
life-threatening adverse effects. A powerful way to
enhance ON-target activity of therapeutic T cells is
to engineer them to require combinatorial antigens.
Here, we engineer a combinatorially activated T cell
circuit in which a synthetic Notch receptor for one an-
tigen induces the expression of a CAR for a second
antigen. These dual-receptor AND-gate T cells are
only armed and activated in the presence of dual an-
tigen tumor cells. These T cells show precise thera-
peutic discrimination in vivo—sparing single antigen
‘‘bystander’’ tumors while efficiently clearing combi-
natorial antigen ‘‘disease’’ tumors. This type of preci-
sion dual-receptor circuit opens the door to immune
recognition of a wider range of tumors.
INTRODUCTION
Recent advances in immunotherapy have demonstrated that
T cells can be redirected to recognize and eliminate tumors using
chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or engineered T cell receptors
(TCRs) that bind tumor-specific antigens (Barrett et al., 2014a;
June et al., 2009). The application of this therapeutic approach,
however, is limited by the rarity of single, highly specific tumor-
only antigens. Few antigens are absolutely tumor specific, and
T cells targeted to antigens that are also found on normal
bystander tissues can cause life-threatening adverse side ef-
fects. The most successful T cell therapies, to date, have been
targeted to B cell malignancies, utilizing CARs directed to the
B cell-specific antigen CD19. Even in this successful treatment,
however, normal B cells are targeted and eradicated (Brentjens
et al., 2013; Grupp et al., 2013; Porter et al., 2011). Although pa-
tients can live without B cells, this type of treatment would be far
more broadly applicable if T cell therapeutics could more reliably
discriminate normal tissue from diseased (Lamers et al., 2006;
Morgan et al., 2013; 2010; Sadelain et al., 2009).
Attempting to discriminate cancer cells via a single receptor
that recognizes a single antigen is inherently a one-dimensional
approach, and it would be a significant improvement if multiple
receptors could be used to combinatorially detect multiple anti-
gens (Figures 1A and 1B) (Barrett et al., 2014b). Such multi-anti-
gen approaches would take full advantage of the capabilities of a
cell-based therapy, as cells usually integrate multiple inputs to
modulate their natural decisions in sophisticated ways.
Prior strategies to engineer multi-input control of T cells have
focused on expressing two CARs in the same cell, each with par-
tial signaling function and distinct extracellular antigen recogni-
tion domains (Kloss et al., 2013; Wilkie et al., 2012). While such
cells show enhanced activation when both target antigens are
present, success of this approach relies on delicately balancing
the same set of coordinated signaling events that occur down-
stream from the CAR. Thus, behavior is highly dependent on
the exact expression ratios and activities of the different receptor
chains, leading to less robust and predictable behavior. More-
over, partial independent function of each receptor inherently
limits the dynamic range of this approach—it remains chal-
lenging to obtain an AND-gate T cell that is both fully inhibited
in the presence of either individual antigen but fully activated in
the presence of both antigens.
To construct more reliable multi-antigen responses, it would
be ideal to have new receptors that function completely indepen-
dently from the CAR/TCR pathway but that can interface with
CAR activity in a controlled manner (Figure 1B). Recently, we
have developed a new class of modular receptors called syn-
thetic Notch (synNotch) receptors (Morsut et al., 2016 [this issue
of Cell]). SynNotch receptors use an extracellular recognition
domain (e.g., single-chain variable fragment [scFv]) to recognize
a target antigen but, unlike CARs, binding of the target antigen
does not trigger T cell activation. Instead, ligand engagement
leads to cleavage of the receptor and to release of a transcrip-
tional activator domain, which can in turn enter the nucleus
and drive expression of user specified target genes (Figure 1C).
These receptors harness the mechanical activation mechanism
of Notch (Gordon et al., 2015).
Here, we show that we can construct combinatorial antigen
recognition T cell circuits in which a synNotch receptor for
one antigen drives the inducible expression of a CAR for a
second antigen (Figure 1D). These dual-receptor T cells are
only armed and activated in the presence of dual antigen tumor
cells (AND-gate). These combinatorially gated T cells show a
770

 remarkable degree of therapeutic discrimination both in vitro and
in vivo—sparing single antigen ‘‘bystander’’ tumors while effi-
ciently eradicating combinatorial antigen ‘‘disease’’ tumors.
Here, we are able to harness the computational power of a dy-
namic synthetic regulatory circuit to achieve much higher
target-cell discrimination, while still maintaining a high dynamic
range of tumor killing. Given the modularity of both CARs and
synNotch receptors, and the robust discrimination we observe,
this type of dual-receptor circuit could lead to precise immune
recognition of a much larger set of tumors.
RESULTS
Design of a Two Antigen AND-Gate Circuit: SynNotch
Receptors Induce CAR Expression
The design of a simple two receptor AND-gate circuit is outlined
in Figure 1D. A T cell is engineered to constitutively express a
synNotch receptor that recognizes antigen A. In addition, the
gene for a CAR that recognizes antigen B would also be inserted
into the cell, but it would be under the control of a promoter that
requires activation by the synNotch-induced transcription factor
(synNotch engagement results in receptor cleavage and release
of a transcriptional activation domain; Morsut et al., 2016). Thus,
no CAR expression or activity should be present in the cell
until the synNotch receptor is activated. This sequential receptor
activation circuit is highly modular in design since swapping
extracellular domains can easily change the antigen recognition
properties of both receptors.
Testing SynNotch-Gated CAR Expression in Jurkat
T Cells—Combinatorial Antigen Requirement for Jurkat
T Cell Activation
To test the concept of utilizing synNotch receptors to control the
expression of CARs, we first attempted to engineer combinatorial
antigen control over the activation of Jurkat T cells. In these
experiments, we targeted two model tumor antigens, CD19
and mesothelin. The Jurkat T cells were engineered with an
a-CD19 synNotch receptor bearing an intracellular tetracycline-
controlled transactivator (tTa) domain (TetR-VP64). We also in-
serted the a-mesothelin CAR gene (with 4-1BBz costimulatory

Sensing Circuits in T Cells Using Sequen-
tially Regulated SynNotch and Chimeric An-
tigen Receptors
(A) CAR or tumor-specific TCR T cells generally
target single antigens, often causing off-target tis-
sue damage. Improved therapeutic T cells will
require multiple sensors that recognize combina-
tions of both tumor antigens and tissue-specific
antigens, allowing the cells to assess their envi-
ronment and make more precise decisions on
when to activate. Such therapeutic cells would be
better equipped to distinguish the target diseased
tissue from normal tissue.
(B) New types of receptors that sense combina-
tions of antigens and regulate T cell signaling and
transcription must be built to allow for sophisti-
cated cellular decision making and more precise
therapeutic T cell responses.
(C) SynNotch receptors are engineered with a
custom extracellular ligand-binding domain (e.g.,
scFv or nanobody) directed toward an antigen of
interest (e.g., CD19 or surface GFP). Upon ligand
recognition by the synNotch receptor, an orthog-
onal transcription factor (e.g., TetR-VP64 or Gal4-
VP64) is cleaved from the cytoplasmic tail that
regulates a custom genetic circuit.
(D) Design of a synNotch AND-gate circuit that re-
quires T cells to sense two antigens to activate.
This AND-gate signaling circuit works in two
sequential steps: (1) a synNotch receptor allows
the T cell to recognize the first antigen A and (2) the
T cell expresses a CAR directed toward a second
tumor antigen B. If antigen A and antigen B are
present, the T cells can activate and kill the target
tumor.

 domain), which is under the control of a promoter with the corre-
sponding tetracycline response elements (TRE) activated by the
synNotch receptor (Figures 2A and 2B). The engineered Jurkats
were co-cultured in vitro with target K562 myelogenous leukemia
cells with ectopic expression of CD19, mesothelin, or both
antigens together (Figures 2A and 2B). Since these engineered
Jurkat T cells only express the a-mesothelin CAR in response
to a-CD19 synNotch stimulation, the T cells should not activate
in response to mesothelin alone. If the T cells are exposed to
CD19, the a-mesothelin CAR is expressed and the T cells are
primed for activation. The T cells can then sense mesothelin
and activate (Figures 2A and 2B).
When we tested these cells, we indeed observed activation
only by the tumor cells that expressed both CD19 and mesothe-
lin, as measured by the upregulation of the activation marker
CD69 and by the secretion of the cytokine IL-2. Tumor cells ex-
pressing either single antigen did not lead to activation (Figures
2C and 2D). We analyzed the dynamics of T cell activation
when stimulated by dual antigens (Figures 2E, S1A, and S1B).
The Jurkat synNotch AND-Gate T cells induce CAR expression
in response to tumor cell stimulation with a t1/2 of �6 hr, reaching
steady-state expression by 24 hr (Figures 2E, S1A, and S1B).
The subsequent T cell activation (monitored via CD69 expres-
sion) occurs after CAR expression initiates, with an expected
sequential delay of an additional �6 hr. Thus, the effective com-
posite half-time for T cell activation by this two-step circuit is
�13 hr (Figure 2E).
We also characterized the decay dynamics of synNotch-
induced CAR expression (Figures 2F and S2C). We first exposed
the synNotch T cells to a surrogate of the priming antigen CD19.
Since the a-CD19 synNotch receptor has a Myc-tag on its
extracellular domain, we previously found that the receptor could
also be activated by exposure of the cells to a-Myc-antibody-
coated plates.This activation approachallowsforrapid cessation
of synNotch activation by removing cells from the plate-bound
antigen. After 24 hr of stimulus with a-Myc antibody, we removed
the T cells and monitored the decay of a-mesothelin CAR expres-
sion over 24 hr. The half-life of CAR expression after removal of
the synNotch stimulus was �8 hr (Figures 2F and S1C).
SynNotch-Gated CAR Expression in Human Primary T
Cells—Combinatorial Antigen Control over T Cell
Activation and Tumor Killing
Given the success of the synNotch AND-gate in Jurkat T cells,
we then tested whether the same type of synNotch-driven
CAR expression circuit could function in primary T cells to
discriminate multiple antigens. We tested various synNotch
receptors in primary T cells and found that the Gal4-VP64 tran-
scriptional activation domain worked reliably, yielding good syn-
Notch receptor expression and minimal basal transcriptional ac-
tivity. This is an ideal scenario for the synNotch/CAR AND-gate
because there should be no basal expression of the CAR until the
T cells sense the synNotch antigen.
As a proof-of-principle demonstration of this approach, we
first utilized an a-GFP synNotch receptor (a-GFP nanobody rec-
ognizes surface-expressed GFP and intracellular Gal4VP64 is
released) to drive expression of the a-CD19 4-1BBz CAR (Fig-
ure 3A). Our rationale for choosing this model setup is that the
a-CD19 CAR is a gold standard in the field of immunotherapy
and it shows potent tumor clearance in vivo.
Human primary CD4+ T cells were engineered with the a-GFP
synNotch Gal4VP64 receptor and the corresponding response
elements controlling a-CD19 4-1BBz CAR expression. These
T cells were then exposed to K562 target cells expressing
CD19 only, GFP only, or both GFP and CD19. The CD4+
T cells only displayed expression of the a-CD19 4-1BBz CAR
when stimulated with cells expressing the synNotch ligand,
GFP (Figure 3B). Moreover, these T cells only showed activation,
as assayed by cytokine production, when exposed to target cells
expressing both GFP and CD19 on their surface (Figures 3B and
3C).
Human primary CD8+ cells containing the same dual-receptor
circuit also showed AND-gate behavior, only killing targets
when GFP and CD19 were present on the target cell (Figures
3D–3F). Thus, the synNotch AND-gate is functional in the critical
cell types required for T cell immunotherapy in humans. To
show the versatility and modularity of this approach, we tested
two other synNotch/CAR AND-gate configurations, and they all
showed combinatorial antigen requirements for CD4+ and
CD8+ T cell activation (Figures S2A–S2I).
SynNotch Receptors Drive Tumor-Localized CAR
Expression In Vivo
Since synNotch receptors reliably gate CAR expression in pri-
mary T cells in vitro, we next tested whether T cells could be
targeted to tumors in vivo via synNotch receptors and only ex-
press the CAR when in the tumor microenvironment. For these
experiments, we injected bilateral xenograft CD19+ Daudi B
cell lymphoblast tumors in immunocompromised NOD scid
IL-2Rg�/� (NSG) mice. Wild-type Daudi cells (containing no
synNotch ligand) were injected subcutaneously in the left
flank, while Daudi tumor cells also expressing surface GFP
were injected in the right flank. After giving the tumors
10 days to implant, we injected primary CD4+ and CD8+
human T cells equipped with the a-GFP synNotch Gal4VP64
receptor, the corresponding response elements controlling
the expression of the a-CD19 4-1BBz CAR, and an IRES
enhanced firefly luciferase (effluc) reporter (Figures 4A, S3A,
and S3B) (Rabinovich et al., 2008). We then monitored lucif-
erase expression as a reporter for CAR expression over the
course of 11 days. The T cells started to express the CAR
selectively in the GFP+ Daudi tumor by day 1 and continually
increased local expression of the CAR over the 11 day period
in the dual antigen tumor (Figure 4B and 4C). The increase in
luciferase signal in the target tumor is likely the result of a
combination of synNotch-driven CAR expression and expan-
sion of cells in the dual antigen target tumor (Figures S3B
and S3C). No increase in luciferase was observed in the con-
trol GFP� tumor.
Selective Combinatorial Antigen Tumor Clearance
In Vivo by SynNotch-Gated CAR Expression
Now that we knew that the a-GFP synNotch receptor could
target T cells to tumors and control local expression of the
a-CD19 CAR, we tested whether the synNotch AND-gate
T cells could selectively clear a dual antigen tumor in vivo. For
772

 these experiments, we set up a similar bilateral tumor model with
K562 tumor cells (Figures 5A, S4A, and S4B). We implanted the
tumors and allowed 4 days for implantation (K562 tumors grow
more rapidly and establish larger tumors compared to Daudi
cells). At day 4, we injected CD4+ and CD8+ T cells bearing
the a-GFP synNotch/a-CD19 CAR AND-gate circuit and moni-
tored tumor growth via caliper for 20 days (Figure 5A). We also
treated a group of mice with untransduced control T cells to
have a reference for tumor growth. In this experiment, the
T cells are directly challenged to discriminate dual antigen ‘‘dis-
ease’’ tumors from single antigen ‘‘bystander’’ tissues within the
same animal.
The synNotch AND-gate T cells displayed remarkably high
and reproducible discriminatory action against the two tumors
present in the same animal. In all animals, they selectively
cleared the dual antigen ‘‘disease’’ tumor (GFP+/CD19+) while
leaving the single antigen ‘‘bystander’’ tumor (CD19+ only) un-
perturbed. These bystander single antigen tumors grew at
rates similar to the negative control tumor treated with un-
transduced T cells (Figures 5B, 5C, and S4B). Thus, there is
little detectable off-target killing of the ‘‘bystander’’ single an-
tigen tumor.
We also set up single-tumor experiments where mice were
implanted with either a single antigen (CD19+ only) or a dual an-
tigen (GFP+/CD19+) K562 tumor. The mice were then treated
with a-GFP synNotch/a-CD19 CAR AND-gate T cells or un-
transduced control T cells. The mice treated with control
T cells all reached euthanasia criteria rapidly, regardless of
the tumor type. The mice with GFP/CD19 tumors treated with
the AND-gate T cells all lived, and the tumor was completely

Notch receptor in order to initiate CAR expression.
After the T cell is primed to activate by CD19, the
a-mesothelin CAR can then bind mesothelin and
activate the Jurkat cell. Two canonical markers of
T cell activation are CD69 upregulation and IL-2
production. The synNotch AND-gate Jurkat T cells
should only activate when exposed to target tumor
cells expressing both CD19 and mesothelin.

 cleared by day 25 post-tumor injection (Figure 5D). Mice with
CD19-only tumors treated with synNotch AND-gate T cells
reached euthanasia criteria at the same rate as mice treated
with untransduced T cells, suggesting there is no off-target
killing of single antigen tumors (Figure 5D). These in vivo data
collectively show that synNotch-gated CAR expression is an
effective AND-gate allowing T cells to confine their activity to
the tumor microenvironment and to only activate and kill in
response to multiple antigens.
An important concern was whether the AND-gate T cells
could
engage
a
tumor
expressing
the
synNotch
ligand
(GFP), become primed by expressing the a-CD19 CAR, and
then migrate elsewhere to then kill single antigen (CD19+
only) bystander tissues. To test this, we performed experi-
ments with a bilateral tumor model, but in this case, one tumor
contained CD19+-only cells and the other tumor contained
GFP+-only cells (two single antigen tumors) (Figure S4D). In
these mice, it would in principle be possible for the T cells
to be primed by the GFP+-only tumor, then migrate and kill
the CD19+ only tumors. Nonetheless, when we monitored
growth of the CD19+ tumor treated with AND-gate T cells,
we found that it was identical to the growth observed when
treated with negative control T cells (untransduced) (Fig-
ure S4E). Thus, there appears to be no evidence for priming
of the AND-gate T cells and subsequent killing of bystander
CD19+ cells elsewhere. Based on our prior data (Figure 2),
the decay of induced CAR expression is on the order of
several hours, which is likely faster than the composite time

Gal4VP64 receptor and the corresponding res-

synNotch AND-gate T cells first must sense
surface GFP via their synNotch receptor, and
only then do they express the a-CD19 CAR and

T cells should only activate and produce cytokine

CD19.

the target cell (representative of at least three in-
dependent experiments).

 that would be required for migration out of the priming tumor,
combined with the time required for CAR-mediated T cell acti-
vation in the bystander tumor. These activation/inactivation
dynamics could explain the requirement for highly local dual
antigens.
DISCUSSION
The Discriminatory Power of Dual Antigen Sensing
SynNotch/CAR Circuits in Therapeutic T Cells
The general concept of utilizing synNotch receptors to regulate
expression of receptors that drive T cell activation (e.g., CARs
or TCRs) has great potential to improve the safety and effective-
ness of T cell therapies by precisely and reliably localizing when
and where the therapeutic (and toxic) action of T cells occurs.
Here, we have shown that synNotch AND-gate T cells reliably
discriminate tumors with two identifying antigens from tissues
expressing only one of these antigens. The AND-gate circuit
works in a sequential manner—the synNotch receptor first rec-
ognizes a tumor-localized antigen, thereby driving the expres-
sion of a CAR that recognizes a second tumor antigen. The
CAR then mediates T cell activation only if the second cognate
antigen is present. This strategy (1) restricts the expression of
the CAR to the tumor microenvironment and (2) has the potential
to overcome the problem of off-target cross reaction that can
occur with conventional CAR T cells when the target antigen is
also present in bystander tissues (Figures 6A and 6B). Specific
discrimination for a tumor could be achieved if the tumor has a
unique combinatorial antigen profile that distinguishes it from
other bystander tissues.

This approach for combinatorial anti-
gen recognition is a critical advance for
T cell therapies, as most other combina-
torial
antigen
recognition
strategies
involve integrated signaling from multiple partially functional
CARs that work cooperatively or antagonistically to control the
activation of the T cell (Fedorov et al., 2013; Kloss et al., 2013;
Wilkie et al., 2012). Combinatorial control over T cell activation
with
the
synNotch-CAR
AND-gate
has
several
benefits
compared to the multiple CAR approach. Importantly, the syn-
Notch receptor by itself does not directly trigger T cell activation
at all—it is completely independent from CAR/TCR signaling.
Therefore, synNotch receptor engagement by itself does not
inflict any damage on the synNotch antigen bearing tissue—it
simply results in the priming response of inducing CAR
expression.
In contrast, when multiple CARs are expressed for combinato-
rial antigen gating of the T cell response, there are often sce-
narios where the partial signaling through one of the receptors
can generate sufficient T cell activity to cause some off-target
tissue damage (Wilkie et al., 2012). Multiple CAR strategies are
dependent on achieving a delicate balance of signaling and,
thus, have inherent limitations on generating digital-like AND-
gate behavior (no activity toward single antigens, maximal activ-
ity toward dual antigens). Moreover, many parameters of multi-
CAR systems must be precisely controlled, including the level
and ratio of the complimentary receptors and their relative
signaling strength. The amount of the target antigens present
on different tissues in the body can also complicate the ability
of the T cells to truly exhibit AND-gate logic (Kloss et al., 2013;
Wilkie et al., 2012). While these multi-CAR systems are an
exciting and important approach to enhance tumor targeting, a
wider range of combinatorial-sensing strategies will improve
our ability to treat a variety of tumors and diseases with T cell

 therapies. It is in principle possible to combine the dynamically
controlled synNotch/CAR system described here with these
other strategies.
Factors Contributing to Robust Dual Antigen
Discrimination
There are also valid concerns for the synNotch-gated CAR
T cells, including the potential for cells to leave the ‘‘priming’’ tis-
sue and cause damage to off-target tissues that express only the
CAR antigen. We have performed in vivo experiments to deter-
mine the extent to which this is a problem and have found that,
for our dual tumor model, T cells do not migrate from the region
of priming to then kill a ‘‘bystander’’ tumor (Figures S4D and
S4E). We hypothesize that once synNotch engagement is
ceased, the decay of CAR expression is fast (hours) compared

Tumor Killing In Vivo by SynNotch-Gated
CAR Expression
(A) Primary human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were
engineered with the a-GFP synNotch Gal4VP64
receptor and the corresponding response elements
regulating a-CD19 4-1BBz CAR expression and
were injected i.v. into NSG mice with a CD19 K562
tumor on the left flank and a surface-GFP/CD19
K562 tumor on the right flank. Tumor size was
monitored over 16 days after i.v. injection of en-
gineered T cells or untransduced T cell controls.

volumes for mice treated with synNotch AND-gate
T cells (top) and untransduced control T cells

dual antigen tumor exclusively and the CD19-only
tumor grew at the same rate as in mice treated
with untransduced control T cells (n = 5 mice, error

t test, ** = p % 0.01, *** = p % 0.001).

mor growth curves are given on the right of (D) (n = 5

to the time required for effective migration
and for full T cell activation by the CAR,
preventing such issues (Figure 2).
Moreover, there are other factors that
are likely to strongly amplify T cell action
within a dual antigen ‘‘disease’’ tumor.
First, induced expression of the CAR will
result in two recognition domains that
may more strongly retain the T cells in
the dual antigen tumor. Second, and
perhaps most importantly, the resulting
T cell activation will induce both local IL-
2 release and proliferation, leading to a strong positive feedback
loop of local T cell expansion and activation. It is likely that these
local positive feedback loops have multiplicative effects, contrib-
uting to the remarkable degree of discrimination that we observe
with these AND-gate T cells.
It is also worth noting that one of the most powerful aspects of
synNotch receptor circuits is their amenability to facile engineer-
ing. Although not explored here, in addition to engineering the
selectivity of antigen recognition, it is possible to modulate the
dynamics of CAR expression (e.g., using degrons, mRNA desta-
bilization, and feedback control), which could tune the duration
and range of CAR activity (Lienert et al., 2014; Lim, 2010). In ef-
fect, such strategies would tune the degree of temporal coupling
between the priming synNotch receptor and the effector CAR.
The current synNotch-CAR circuits already function in a highly
776

 controlled manner with no observable off-target toxicity but
could likely be further improved or tailored for particular tumor
contexts.
SynNotch Receptors Increase the Landscape of
Targetable Antigens for T Cell Therapies
Most engineered T cell strategies have focused on identifying
and targeting a single tumor-specific antigen with a CAR or
engineered TCR. Thus, the rarity of these truly tumor-specific an-
tigens has limited this approach. Although there are many tumor-
associated antigens, few of them are truly tumor specific. Many
tumors, particularly solid tumors, overexpress antigens that
could be targeted but are also expressed at lower levels in other
bystander tissues.
The robust AND-gate dual antigen detection demonstrated by
the synNotch/CAR T cells now opens the possibility that tumors
could be targeted based on combinatorial antigen signatures
(Figure 6C). It is far more likely that multiple antigens will provide
higher discriminatory power between tumor and normal tissues.
For example, it might be possible to target both a disease-asso-
ciated antigen and a tissue-specific (normal) antigen to more
precisely attack a particular type of cancer cell. Tissue-specific
antigen detection by synNotch receptors could restrict the prim-
ing of therapeutic T cells only to particular tissues. This is a unique
way in which synNotch receptors could both increase the thera-
peutic effect and reduce systemic toxicity.
Dual antigen AND-gate T cells might allow more widespread
use of CARs and TCRs directed to tumor-associated antigens
that, when recognized by themselves, often yield toxic side ef-
fects (e.g., the a-Her2 CAR) (Barrett et al., 2014b; Dotti et al.,
2014; Morgan et al., 2010). SynNotch receptors could be used
to gate the expression of this class of CARs to confine their
expression to the disease site, away from off-target tissue. Syn-
Notch receptors thus increase the landscape of targetable anti-
gens for CARs and may facilitate the usage of CARs that have so
far been thought to have high toxic potential (Figure 6C) (Dotti
et al., 2014).
SynNotch receptors are a general and powerful platform to not
only localize therapeutic T cell activity, but also to build combina-
torial antigen-sensing capabilities that enhance the ability of any
therapeutic cell to recognize diseased target tissues with high
precision and specificity. While much development remains,
the versatility and modularity of the synNotch receptor system
could in principle be used to program therapeutic cells to
perform a large spectrum of combinatorial logical decisions ex-
tending beyond dual antigen sensing.

Localize CAR T Cell Responses for Precision
Immunotherapy
(A) Here, we engineered T cells with synNotch re-
ceptors that sense tumor antigens and upregulate
expression of a CAR to a second antigen. Thus,
these synNotch AND-gate T cells only activate in
response to combinatorial antigen recognition in
the tumor microenvironment, preventing off-target
toxicity mediated by single antigen recognition.
(B) SynNotch AND-gate T cells, unlike therapeutic
T cells that target single antigens, can reliably
discriminate combinatorial antigen targets from
single antigen bystander tissue. Combinatorial
antigen sensing by synNotch-CAR T cells could aid
in precisely targeting T cells to tumors, preventing
off-target toxicity.
(C) synNotch receptors expand the targetable tu-
mor antigen space. Tumor-specific antigens are
rare compared to tumor-associated antigens (an-
tigens that are expressed on normal tissue but are
more highly expressed on tumors). Since CARs
fully activate T cells, resulting in the killing of target
tissue, T cells engineered with a single CAR must
be targeted to tumor-specific antigens in order to
reduce fatal off-target toxicity (upper venn dia-
gram). SynNotch receptors can gate CAR expres-
sion and control where the T cells are armed.
When targeting tumor-specific antigen combina-
tions, it may now be possible to use CAR re-
ceptors directed toward tumor-associated anti-
gens. This should reduce off-target damage to
tissues that express the CAR antigen in other parts
of the body.

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
SynNotch Receptor and Response Element Construct Design
SynNotch receptors were built by fusing the CD19 scFv (Porter et al., 2011),
LaG17 (lower affinity GFP), or LaG16_2 (high-affinity GFP) nanobody (Fridy
et al., 2014) to the mouse Notch1 (NM_008714) minimal regulatory region
(Ile1427 to Arg1752) and Gal4 DBD VP64 or TetR VP64 (tTa). All synNotch re-
ceptors contain an n-terminal CD8a signal peptide (MALPVTALLLPLALLL
HAARP) for membrane targeting and a myc-tag (EQKLISEEDL) for easy deter-
mination of surface expression with a-myc A647 (cell-signaling #2233; see
Morsut et al., [2016] for receptor synNotch receptor peptide sequences).
The receptors were cloned into a modified pHR’SIN:CSW vector containing
a PGK promoter for all primary T cell experiments. The pHR’SIN:CSW vector
was also modified to make the response element plasmids. Five copies of
the Gal4 DNA binding domain target sequence (GGAGCACTGTCCTCC
GAACG) were cloned 50 to a minimal CMV promoter. Also included in the
response element plasmids is a PGK promoter that constitutively drives
mCherry expression to easily identify transduced T cells. For all inducible
CAR vectors, the CARs were tagged c-terminally with GFP and were cloned
via a BamHI site in the multiple cloning site 30 to the Gal4 response elements.
All constructs were cloned via in fusion cloning (Clontech #ST0345).
Primary Human T Cell Isolation and Culture
Primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were isolated from anonymous donor blood
after apheresis by negative selection (STEMCELL Technologies #15062 and
#15063). Blood was obtained from Blood Centers of the Pacific, as approved
by the University Institutional Review Board. T cells were cryopreserved in
RPMI-1640 (UCSF cell culture core) with 20% human AB serum (Valley
Biomedical, #HP1022) and 10% DMSO. After thawing, T cells were cultured
in human T cell medium consisting of X-VIVO 15 (Lonza #04-418Q), 5% Human
AB serum, and 10 mM neutralized N-acetyl L-Cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich
#A9165) supplemented with 30 units/mL IL-2 (NCI BRB Preclinical Repository)
for all experiments.
Lentiviral Transduction of Human T Cells
Pantropic VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus was produced via transfection of
Lenti-X 293T cells (Clontech #11131D) with a pHR’SIN:CSW transgene
expression vector and the viral packaging plasmids pCMVdR8.91 and
pMD2.G using Fugene HD (Promega #E2312). Primary T cells were thawed
the same day and, after 24 hr in culture, were stimulated with Human T-Acti-
vator CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Life Technologies #11131D) at a 1:3 cell:bead ra-
tio. At 48 hr, viral supernatant was harvested and the primary T cells were
exposed to the virus for 24 hr. At day 4 after T cell stimulation, the Dynabeads
were removed, and the T cells expanded until day 9 when they were rested and
could be used in assays. T cells were sorted for assays with a Beckton Dick-
inson (BD) FACs ARIA II. AND-gate T cells exhibiting basal CAR expression
were gated out during sorting.
Generation of SynNotch AND-Gate Jurkat T Cells
E6-1 Jurkat T cells (ATCC# TIB-152) were lentivirally transduced with the
a-CD19 synNotch tTa receptor (Myc-tagged) and a TRE3GS inducible
promoter controlling expression of the a-mesothelin 4-1BBz CAR that also
contains a constitutive cassette driving mCherry expression. After viral trans-
duction, the Jurkat cells, with expression of both the receptor and response
elements, were single-cell sorted into 96-well plates with a FACs ARIA II. Sin-
gle-cell clones that grew out in culture were then assessed for retained expres-
sion of the constructs and used in assays.
Cancer Cell Lines
The cancer cell lines used were K562 myelogenous leukemia cells (ATCC
#CCL-243) and Daudi B cell lymphoblasts (ATCC #CCL-213). K562s were len-
tivirally transduced to stably express human CD19 at equivalent levels as
Daudi tumors. CD19 levels were determined by staining the cells with
a-CD19 APC (Biolegend #302212). K562s and Daudi cells were also trans-
duced to stably express surface GFP (GFP fused to the PDGF transmembrane
domain). The CD19 and surface-GFP peptide sequences can be found in Mor-
sut et al., (2016). All cell lines were sorted for expression of the transgenes.
In Vitro Stimulation of SynNotch T cells
For all in vitro synNotch T cell stimulations, 2 3 105 T cells were co-cultured
with sender cells at a 1:1 ratio. After mixing the T cells and cancer cells in round
bottom 96-well tissue culture plates, the cells were centrifuged for 1 min at
400 3 g to force interaction of the cells, and the cultures were analyzed at
24 hr for markers of activation (e.g., CD69) for CD4+ T cells and specific lysis
of target tumor cells for CD8+ T cells with a BD LSR II. All flow cytometry anal-
ysis was performed in FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Luminex MAGPIX Cytokine Quantification
Primary CD4+ T cells expressing the a-CD19 synNotch Gal4VP64 receptor
and 53 Gal4 response elements controlling the CAR were stimulated as
described above with the indicated target cancer cell line. The supernatant
was collected at 24 hr and analyzed with a Luminex MAGPIX (Luminex) Human
Cytokine Magnetic 25-plex Panel (Invitrogen ref#LHC0009M) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. All cytokine levels were calculated based on stan-
dard curves with xPONENT software (Luminex).
IL-2 ELISA and CD69 Staining
Primary CD4+ or Jurkat synNotch AND-Gate T cells were stimulated with the
indicated cancer cell line as described above for 24 hr and supernatant was
harvested. IL-2 levels in the supernatant were determined via IL-2 ELISA (eBio-
sciences #BMS2221HS). The T cells were also collected and stained with
a-CD69 APC (Biolegend #310910) to determine if they were activated.
Assessment of SynNotch AND-Gate T Cell Cytotoxicity
CD8+ synNotch AND-Gate T cells were stimulated for 24 hr as described
above with target cells expressing the indicated antigens. The level of specific
lysis of target cancer cells was determined by comparing the fraction of target
cells alive in the culture compared to treatment with untransduced T cell con-
trols. Cell death was monitored by uptake of the live/dead stain SYTOX Blue
(Thermo Scientific #S34857) and shifting of the target cells out of the side scat-
ter and forward scatter region normally populated by the target cells.
In Vitro Quantification of Luciferase Reporter Activity in SynNotch
T Cells
Sorted CD4+ and CD8+ primary human T cells engineered to express the
a-GFP nanobody (LaG17) synNotch Gal4VP64 receptor and the correspond-
ing response elements controlling a-CD19 4-1BBz CAR IRES effluc expression
were stimulated with GFP+ or GFP� Daudi cells for 24 hr (2 3 105 T cells and
2 3 105 K562s). Production of effluc was assessed with the ONE-glo Lucif-
erase Assay System (Promega #E6110). Bioluminescence was measured
with a FlexStation 3 (Molecular Devices).
In Vivo Luciferase Imaging of SynNotch T Cells
Animal studies were conducted with the UCSF Preclinical Therapeutics Core
under a protocol approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Ten days prior to T cell injection, Daudi tumors and surface-GFP
Daudi tumors were injected subcutaneously into the left and right flanks of
mice (female, �8- to 12-weeks old, Jackson Laboratory #005557). Sorted
CD4+ and CD8+ primary human T cells engineered to express the a-GFP
nanobody (LaG17) synNotch Gal4VP64 receptor and the corresponding
response elements controlling a-CD19 4-1BBz CAR IRES effluc expression
were injected at a 1:1 CD4+ to CD8+ T cell ratio (1 3 106 of each T cell type)
intravenously (i.v.) into the tumor-bearing mice 10 days after tumor implanta-
tion. Luciferase expression was monitored over 11 days with bioluminescent
imaging performed using the IVIS 100 (Xenogen) preclinical imaging system
at the indicated time points. Images were acquired 10 min following intraper-
itoneal (i.p.) injection with 150 mg/kg of D-luciferin (Gold Technology #LUCK-
100). Quantification of integrated bioluminescence intensities was quantified in
ImageJ (NIH).
In Vivo Dual Antigen Tumor Targeting by SynNotch AND-Gate T Cells
NSG mice were implanted with two xenograft tumors—5 3 106 CD19+ and
GFP+/CD19+ K562 tumor cells subcutaneously on the left and right flank,
respectively. Four days after tumor implantation, 1 3 106 primary human
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (2 3 106 total T cells) were injected i.v. into the
778
Cell 164, 770–779, February 11, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
 mice. These T cells were either untransduced (control) or engineered with the
a-GFP synNotch Gal4VP64 receptor and the corresponding response ele-
ments regulating a-CD19 4-1BBz CAR expression. Tumor size was monitored
by the UCSF Preclinical Therapeutics Core staff via caliper over 20 days after
T cell injection. For Kaplan-Meier experiments, the same protocol was used
but single tumors were injected into the mice. Mice were considered dead
when the tumor size reached euthanasia criteria.
Statistical Analysis and Curve Fitting
Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t test (two-tailed) unless
otherwise noted. All statistical analysis and curve fitting was performed
with Prism 6 (Graphpad) and p values are reported (not significant = p >
0.05, * = p % 0.05, ** = p % 0.01, *** = p % 0.001, **** = p % 0.0001). All error
bars represent either SEM or SD.
