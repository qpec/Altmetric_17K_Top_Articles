Abstract
Objective: TX-004HR is an investigational, muco-adhesive, vaginal, softgel capsule containing low-dose,
solubilized, 17b-estradiol designed to treat postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) and improve user
experience without an applicator and less mess.
Methods: As part of the 12-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 REJOICE trial evaluating the
efficacy/safety of 4-, 10-, and 25-mg TX-004HR in 764 postmenopausal women with VVA, a five-question product
survey was administered. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate correlations between clinical
endpoints (vaginal physiology, dyspareunia, and vaginal dryness) and patient acceptability and satisfaction.
Results: Majority of the women receiving TX-004HR or placebo reported that the product was easy to use
(85.4%-92.1%) and rated ease of capsule insertion as ‘‘good’’ to ‘‘excellent’’ (75.0%-82.6%). A significantly
greater percentage of women reported being ‘‘very satisfied’’ or ‘‘satisfied’’ with TX-004HR (68.6%-76.3%) than
with placebo (56.8%, P < 0.05 for all). A greater percentage of women ‘‘somewhat’’ or ‘‘very much’’ preferred TX-
004HR over their previous treatment versus those taking placebo (P < 0.05). Significantly more women receiving
TX-004HR (72.8%-80.5%) versus placebo (62.5%, P < 0.05) would ‘‘probably’’ or ‘‘definitely’’ consider using the
product again. Dyspareunia and vaginal dryness reductions were correlated with higher product satisfaction and the
percentage of women who would consider re-using TX-004HR.
Conclusions: TX-004HR had a high level of product acceptability, and more women were satisfied with TX-
004HR, preferred it over their previous treatment, and would consider using it again versus placebo. Women may
find TX-004HR to be a more acceptable product than current options to treat their dyspareunia associated with
postmenopausal VVA.

P
ostmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA)
often results from a decline in circulating estrogen
levels experienced at the onset of menopause.1,2 VVA
is characterized by a constellation of symptoms, including
dyspareunia; vaginal dryness, irritation, soreness, stinging
pain, and discharge; and dysuria.1,2 In 2014, the International
Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health and The
North American Menopause Society adopted genitourinary
syndrome of menopause as a medically more accurate and all-
encompassing term for describing VVA and its urogenitary
symptoms3; however, this term has yet to be adopted by the
United States Food and Drug Administration.

 therapies for women with symptomatic VVA and low-dose
vaginal estrogens for those with moderate-to-severe VVA or
who have failed to respond to lubricants and moisturizers,4
which do not address the underlying physiological condition.
The vaginal route of administration allows for localized
treatment with low-dose estrogens to relieve symptoms with
little to no systemic estrogen exposure.4,5 Potential benefits of
vaginal versus oral administration are avoidance of gastroin-
testinal absorption and hepatic first-pass effects, which allows
for lower dosing and lower systemic exposure, and potentially
a lower incidence of adverse effects.5,6
Despite being proven as clinically efficacious and safe as
indicated, use of many vaginal estrogen treatments has been
hindered by issues related to route of administration, conven-
ience, and safety concerns with long-term use and systemic
exposure.7-10 Respondents in the Real Women’s Views
of Treatment Options for Menopausal Vaginal Changes
(REVIVE) survey frequently reported messiness, difficult
administration, inconvenience, and insufficient symptomatic
relief as limitations of over-the-counter vaginal moisturizers
or lubricants and prescription vaginal products.7 Women
using vaginal creams also expressed difficulties with admin-
istering the correct dosage,9 whereas those using vaginal rings
experienced difficulties with insertion and removal as well
as concern related to potential dislodging of the ring and
hygiene.1,4,8
Collectively, these issues with currently available products
often result in poor patient satisfaction and ultimately poor
adherence to the prescribed dosing regimen and longer-term
treatment. About one-quarter of the respondents in the Wom-
en’s EMPOWER survey reported being not very and not at all
satisfied (21%-50%) with currently available vaginal-based
hormone therapies for VVA, with those using a vaginal
ring being the least satisfied (50%).11 Poor adherence was
demonstrated by a survey (n ¼ 200) that found many of the
postmenopausal vaginal cream users deliberately did not
adhere to the prescribed dosage, with some applying larger
amounts to achieve greater efficacy or faster therapeutic
response, and others applying a smaller amount to avoid
messiness or leakage.9 Furthermore, a retrospective analysis
of prescription renewals reported that the majority of Amer-
ican women discontinued the use of vaginal creams after an
average of 45 days and vaginal tablets after 103 days.12
Similarly, 38% of women who had ever used prescription
products in the Respondents in the REVIVE survey chose not
to refill their vaginal estrogen therapy because of concerns
related to safety or adverse effects, including long-term
safety, administration, messiness, and overall treatment
efficacy.10
TX-004HR (TherapeuticsMD, Inc, Boca Raton, FL) is an
investigational, applicator-free, muco-adhesive, vaginal, soft-
gel capsule containing low-dose solubilized 17b-estradiol
designed to provide relief from symptoms of postmenopausal
VVA.13 TX-004HR at doses of 4, 10, and 25 mg significantly
and rapidly improved the percentages of superficial and
parabasal cells, vaginal pH, and severity of dyspareunia
and vaginal dryness in postmenopausal women with VVA
during the 12-week study period,13 with negligible to very low
systemic absorption of estradiol.14
The present study evaluated the product acceptability and
patient satisfaction with applicator-free TX-004HR vaginal
softgel capsules, as assessed by a survey as part of the phase 3,
placebo-controlled REJOICE pivotal trial.
METHODS
Study design
The 12-week phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled REJOICE trial evaluated the effi-
cacy and safety of TX-004HR at doses of 4, 10, and 25 mg in
postmenopausal women diagnosed with VVA and self-
reported most bothersome symptom of moderate-to-severe
dyspareunia (NCT02253173). Complete details regarding the
study design for the REJOICE trial have been previously
reported.13 Briefly, women were randomized 1:1:1:1 to 4-,
10-, or 25-mg TX-004HR or matching placebo, using a
computer-generated randomization schedule.13 All study
medication looked the same, and study staff and participants
were not aware of the treatment they dispensed or received,
respectively.13 Women self-administered one capsule per day
intravaginally for 2 weeks, after biweekly dosing (3-4 days
apart) for 10 weeks.13 Co-primary endpoints were changes
from baseline to week 12 in the percentages of superficial and
parabasal cells, vaginal pH, and severity of dyspareunia.13
Secondary outcome measures included changes from baseline
to weeks 2, 6, and 8 in the same endpoints and vaginal dryness
and vulvar and/or vaginal itching and irritation at all time
points, as well as a product acceptability questionnaire admin-
istered at week 12.13 Dyspareunia and vaginal dryness were
assessed with the VVA Symptom Self-Assessment Question-
naire (scoring: 0 ¼ none, 1 ¼ mild, 2 ¼ moderate, 3 ¼ severe)
at each timepoint.
The study was conducted in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the Inter-
national Conference on Harmonization Guideline for Good
Clinical Practice and the ethical principles that have their
origins in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol,
including the informed consent form, was approved by an
independent institutional review board.
Study participants
Complete details regarding the inclusion/exclusion criteria
for the REJOICE trial have been previously published.13
Postmenopausal women 40 to 75 years of age were enrolled
if they had �5% superficial cells on vaginal cytological
smear; vaginal pH >5.0, most bothersome symptom of
moderate-to-severe vaginal pain associated with sexual
activity (dyspareunia), onset of moderate-to-severe dyspar-
eunia after menopause, body mass index �38 kg/m2, and were
sexually active (with vaginal penetration) and anticipated
having sexual activity during the trial period. Participants
with an intact uterus must have had a screening endometrial
biopsy sample sufficient for analysis.
PATIENT ACCEPTABILITY OF TX-004HR
Menopause, Vol. 24, No. 8, 2017
895
 Acceptability questionnaire
The acceptability questionnaire consisted of five questions
and was administered to study participants at the end of their
study participation. The questions were related to ease of
product use, ease of capsule insertion, level of product
satisfaction, the likelihood of reusing this form of treatment,
and the preference of the study medication to previous
medications (Table 1).
Statistical analyses
Responses to the acceptability questionnaire were analyzed
for the intent-to-treat population, with each TX-004HR dose
group being compared with placebo using either Fisher’s
exact test or the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Pearson
correlation coefficients were calculated and used to assess
the relationship between product acceptability and each of the
four co-primary endpoints (changes from baseline to week 12
in percentage of superficial cells, percentage of parabasal
cells, vaginal pH, and severity of dyspareunia) and the
secondary endpoint of change from baseline to week 12 in
vaginal dryness evaluated as part of the primary REJOICE
trial. Correlations were based on individual level paired data.
Change in dyspareunia and vaginal dryness severity ranged
from �3 to þ3, ease of insertion ranged from 1 (poor) to 4
(excellent), level of satisfaction ranged from �2 (very dis-
satisfied) to 2 (very satisfied), and whether women would
consider using the product again ranged from �2 (definitely
no) to 2 (definitely yes). Associations between ease of product
use (binary variable: yes or no) and mean changes in dys-
pareunia and vaginal dryness were analyzed using t tests.
P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. No
Bonferroni adjustments were made for simultaneous multiple
inferences.
RESULTS
Participant disposition and baseline characteristics
Of 2,183 women screened, 764 satisfied eligibility criteria
and were randomized to TX-004HR 4 mg (n ¼ 191), 10 mg
(n ¼ 191), or 25 mg (n ¼ 190), or placebo (n ¼ 192). Ninety-
two percent (704/764) of the women completed the study, and
96% (731/764) provided answers to the questionnaire. Partici-
pant demographics and baseline characteristics were similar
between the four groups, with women having a mean age of
59, and the majority being white (Table 2). At baseline,
approximately 32% of women had not used any product to
treat their VVA symptoms (Table 2).
Product administration
The majority of women taking either TX-004HR or placebo
(85.4%-92.1%) found the product easy to use. Similarly, the
majority of all women (75.0%-82.6%) rated the ease of
capsule insertion as ‘‘good’’ or ‘‘excellent.’’ Statistically
significant differences between 10-mg (90.1%) and 25-mg
(92.1%) TX-004HR with placebo (85.4%, P < 0.05) were
found for ease of use but not for the 4-mg dose (89.5%,
P > 0.05). Statistically significant differences were also found
for ease of insertion for all three TX-004HR doses compared
with placebo (4 mg [81.7%], 10 mg [81.2%], and 25 mg
[82.6%] vs placebo [75.0%], P < 0.05).
Changes in dyspareunia severity were significantly associ-
ated with ease of product use (P ¼ 0.0002) and correlated
with an inverse relationship with ease of capsule insertion

Changes
in

severity were also significantly associated with ease of prod-
uct use (P < 0.0001) and correlated with an inverse relation-
ship with ease of capsule insertion (r ¼ �0.236, P < 0.0001).
Product satisfaction and treatment preference
A significantly greater percentage of women reported being
‘‘satisfied’’ or ‘‘very satisfied’’ with TX-004HR 4 mg (68.6%,
P ¼ 0.0009), 10 mg (72.8%, P < 0.0001), and 25 mg (76.3%,
P < 0.0001) versus placebo (56.8%; Fig. 1). Correlations with
an inverse relationship were observed between the level of
product satisfaction and changes in dyspareunia (r ¼ �0.551,
P < 0.0001) as well as changes in vaginal dryness (r ¼ �0.533,
P < 0.0001). Level of product satisfaction was also correlated
with changes in the percentage of superficial cells (r¼ 0.142,
P ¼ 0.0002) and inversely correlated with changes in vaginal
pH (r ¼ �0.159, P < 0.0001).
Of the women who had previously used a product to treat
their VVA, significantly more preferred TX-004HR 4 mg
(68.2%, P ¼ 0.0010), 10mg (61.8%, P ¼ 0.0212), and 25mg
(70.9%, P ¼ 0.0003) over a previously used treatment than the
ones who used placebo (51.9%; Fig. 2). A significantly greater
percentage of women from the TX-004HR groups (72.8%-
80.5%) would ‘‘probably’’ or ‘‘definitely’’ consider using the
product again relative to placebo (62.5%; P ¼ 0.0015 for 4 and
10mg, P < 0.0001 for 25mg; Fig. 3). Changes in dyspareunia
(r¼ �0.433, P < 0.0001) and vaginal dryness (r¼ �0.410,
P < 0.0001) severity were inversely correlated with the like-
lihood that women would consider using the study treatment
again.
DISCUSSION
This product acceptability questionnaire, administered as
part of the phase 3 REJOICE trial, revealed that approxi-
mately 90% of the women found the product easy to use,
with most rating the ease of capsule insertion as ‘‘good’’
or ‘‘excellent.’’ The majority of women reported being
‘‘satisfied’’ to ‘‘very satisfied’’ with TX-004HR (68.6%-
76.3% vs 56.8% for placebo) and would ‘‘definitely’’ or
‘‘probably use’’ TX-004HR again (72.8%-80.5% vs 62.5%
for placebo), with statistically significant differences between
the three TX-004HR doses and placebo. Importantly, most
women reported that they preferred TX-004HR over their
previous treatment. As expected, correlation analyses found
that as severity of dyspareunia and vaginal dryness decreased,
ease of product use, ease of capsule insertion, patient satis-
faction, and the likelihood of using the study treatment again
increased. In addition, an increase in the percentage of
superficial cells and a decrease in vaginal pH were associated
with higher patient satisfaction.
Data from this study are consistent with previously pre-
sented data from a phase 2 trial evaluating TX-004HR 10 mg
(N ¼ 49).15 Overall, 96% of the women participating in the
study reported that the capsule was easy to insert, and 66%
stated that they would ‘‘probably’’ or ‘‘definitely’’ consider
using the capsule again.15 More women reported being
‘‘satisfied’’ or ‘‘very satisfied’’ with TX-004HR 10 mg
(63%) versus 36% with placebo.15
Patient satisfaction with all three doses of TX-004HR
(68.6%-76.3%) was considerably higher than that reported
in separate studies for currently available vaginal products; in
the Women’s EMPOWER survey, the percentage of women
who were very to extremely satisfied with their vaginal
products did not exceed 51%.11 Furthermore, TX-004HR
is the only vaginal product to have satisfaction rates that
approach (68.5% [4 mg]) or meet (72.8% [10 mg] and 76.3%
[25 mg]) the benchmark for acceptable patient satisfaction of
greater than 70%.16
In this study, patient satisfaction was correlated, to a
varying extent, with improvements in dyspareunia and vag-
inal dryness severity, percentage of superficial cells, and

 vaginal pH. Because all four treatments were identical in
appearance, patient satisfaction with TX-004HR is likely due
to the demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of TX-004HR.13 The
higher than expected satisfaction rate with placebo (56.8%) is
likely due to a large placebo response likely resulting from the
use of Miglyol, a fractionated coconut oil with potential
lubricating properties, in the formulation of the vaginal
capsule.13,17 Reductions in the severity of dyspareunia and
vaginal dryness being correlated with higher ease of product
use and capsule insertion suggest that using the product
becomes easier as vaginal physiology improved and severity
of dyspareunia and vaginal dryness decreased with TX-004HR.
The formulation of the capsule may address key limitations
of currently available VVA products and, in turn, may con-
tribute to the high rates of satisfaction observed with TX-
004HR. Women using vaginal creams reported missing doses
because of messiness when filling and inserting the applicator,
general unpleasantness of the cream, and leakage.8 Addition-
ally, significant safety concerns associated with underdosing
or overdosing were reported to cause many women to switch
from a vaginal cream to a vaginal tablet.8 Women using
vaginal rings were found to delay refilling their prescription
because they had difficulty removing or inserting the ring;
they or their partner could feel the ring; they were concerned
about vaginal infection, hygiene, and cleanliness; or because
the ring was not the lowest effective dose of estrogen that
could be prescribed.8 The softgel capsule formulation of TX-
004HR may circumvent many of these issues by allowing for
accurate dosing and easy administration, which may be more
hygienic as an applicator is not necessary. TX-004HR has
been designed to rapidly dissolve, with no vaginal secretions
required for activation, and therefore, should minimize vag-
inal discharge, resulting in less messiness.
A separate analysis of 13,074 American women found that
women initiating vaginal tablets versus vaginal cream were
more likely to continue therapy for a longer period and
exhibited greater adherence to medication, suggested by
the authors to be due to less issues with messiness and fixed
dosing.18 An online survey of 200 American women reported
that 45% of women who use vaginal creams for VVA
deliberately used less than the recommended dose to avoid
messiness or leakage.9 Furthermore, significantly more
women who used vaginal creams reported delaying or not
using the medication because of messiness compared with
users of vaginal tablets (67% vs 17%).9 Another online survey
of 423 Swedish women reported that women would be willing
to pay more for vaginal tablets than vaginal creams to avoid
smudges/leakage.19 Thus, women prescribed TX-004HR may
be more likely to adhere to treatment due to the demonstrated
efficacy of TX-004HR for treating postmenopausal VVA and
overall ease of use of the product and inserting the capsule, as
well as patient satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS
TX-004HR, an investigational, applicator-free, muco-
adhesive, vaginal, softgel capsule of low-dose, solubilized,
17b-estradiol designed to treat postmenopausal VVA provided
an improved user experience compared with other currently
used vaginal treatments for VVA. The majority of postmeno-
pausal women participating in the REJOICE trial rated using
the product and inserting the applicator-free capsule as easy,
and when compared with placebo, were more satisfied with
TX-004HR, preferred it over their previous VVA treatment,
and would consider using TX-004HR again. Together with
previously reported improvements in vaginal physiology and
severity of dyspareunia, these survey results suggest women
prescribed TX-004HR will be satisfied with their vaginal
therapy, which may enhance treatment adherence for their
postmenopausal VVA and moderate-to-severe dyspareunia.
