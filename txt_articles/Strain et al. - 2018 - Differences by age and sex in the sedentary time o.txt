 Differences by age and sex in the sedentary time of adults in Scotland 
Previous nationally-representative research in Scotland found a j-shaped 
relationship between age and leisure sedentary time (ST): a decrease from young 
to middle-age, before rising steeply in older-age. This study investigated the 
effects of age and sex on weekday (including work) ST for all adults and 
stratified by work-status, and on weekend day ST. Differences in the relative 
contributions of component behaviours were also investigated. Responses from 
14,367 adult (≥16 years) 2012-14 Scottish Health Survey participants were 
analysed using linear regressions. We found no j-shaped relationship between age 
and weekday ST. Instead, only 16-24 year olds reported lower levels than those 
over 75 years (6.6 (95% CI: 6.3-6.9) compared to 7.4 (95% CI: 7.2-7.6) 
hours/day; p<0001). The j-shape was only evident in the stratified analysis 
amongst women not in work, and for weekend day ST for all groups. For those in 
work, work ST accounted for 45% of weekday ST. Television/screen ST made up 
over half of leisure ST on weekdays and weekend days, regardless of sex, age, or 
work-status. These results challenge our understanding of how ST varies by age. 
Interventions to reduce ST should consider differences in the relative 
contributions of ST behaviours by age and work-status. 
Keywords: sedentary; survey; sex; age; adults 
Introduction 
Sedentary time (ST) is defined as time spent in any waking activity which is undertaken 
in a sitting or reclined posture and has an energy expenditure of ≤1.5 metabolic 
equivalents of task (METs) (Sedentary Behaviour Research Network, 2012). There is 
growing evidence to suggest that high levels of ST (>7-10 hours/day) are associated 
with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, 
and some cancers amongst adults (Biswas et al., 2015; Chau et al., 2013; Pandey et al., 
2016). These harmful effects can be attenuated by physical activity, but are only 
eliminated amongst those who undertake very high volumes (approximately 60-75 
minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per day) (Ekelund et al., 2016). There is 
 also evidence to suggest that not all sedentary behaviours have equal health impacts: 
high levels of television (TV) viewing often show stronger negative associations than 
total ST with health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes and obesity (Hu, Li, Colditz, 
Willett, & Manson, 2003), and cancer (Schmid & Leitzmann, 2014). It is plausible that 
this is due to other concurrent unhealthy behaviours such as snacking on calorie dense 
foods (Jeffery & French, 1998; Meyer et al., 2008). 
Currently, the UK physical activity guidelines recommend that people of all 
ages minimise the amount of time they spend being sedentary for extended periods 
(Department of Health, 2011). In Scotland, average daily ST is measured by the 
Scottish Health Survey (SHeS). Adult (≥16 years) participants are asked to report how 
much time they spend in sedentary behaviours, grouped into three categories: sitting at 
work, leisure TV/screen time, and any other leisure sedentary behaviours (such as 
eating a meal, reading, or listening to music). Participants are asked to respond based on 
their ‘typical’ working day (if applicable). For TV/screen ST and other leisure ST they 
are asked to report for an average week and weekend day (Bromley, Campbell-Jack, & 
Hinchliffe, 2015).  
Although these data have been collected annually since 2012, limited summary 
statistics have been reported. The 2012 SHeS annual report published the mean hours of 
reported ST on weekdays and weekend days by age and sex, but only including leisure 
TV/screen ST and other leisure sedentary behaviours. Averages ranged between 4.6–7.6 
hours/day, and there was a clear j-shaped trend with age for men and women: a decrease 
from young to middle-age, before rising steeply in older-age (Bromley, 2013). The 
Health Survey for England (HSE) found very similar results, using the same survey 
items (Scholes & Mindell, 2013).  
 The first research question is: do the relationships between ST and age and sex 
remain the same when work ST is included in the measure of weekday ST? Not 
including work ST could be distorting our understanding of the levels of ST amongst 
office workers in Scotland who, estimates suggest, spend 65-75% of their work time 
sitting down (Buckley et al., 2015). As the workplace is already a focus of many ST 
interventions (Shrestha et al., 2016) it is vital to include time spent sitting there in the 
national prevalence statistics. 
The second research question is: how do the relative contributions of the 
categories of behaviours (sitting time at work, leisure TV/screen ST, and any other 
leisure ST) to weekday and weekend day ST vary by age and sex? This information is 
important to tailor and direct interventions to reduce ST. Given the potential differential 
health effects of the behaviours, further understanding of how they vary by age and sex 
for adults in Scotland is warranted. 
 
Methods 
Data source 
We acquired the 2012-2013-2014 SHeS combined dataset from the UK data archive on 
17th December 2015 (ScotCen Social Research, 2015). After weighting, the dataset is 
nationally representative of the population living in private households in Scotland from 
2012 to 2014. Data are collected via an interviewer-led computer assisted interview. For 
more details see the SHeS Technical Report (Bromley et al., 2015). 
Assessment of sedentary time 
Adult participants (≥16 years) were asked to report the duration of sedentary behaviours 
 under three categories: (i) time spent sitting at work on a typical day, (ii) leisure time 
spent sitting watching TV or other screen devices on a typical weekday and weekend 
day, (iii) time spent in other leisure sedentary activities such as eating a meal, reading, 
or listening to music, on a typical weekday and weekend day (see Supplementary File 1 
for the full questionnaire). Participants were instructed not to double-count the 
behaviours. We assumed that a typical work day was a weekday. Typical weekday ST 
was calculated as the sum of (i) and the weekday responses to (ii) and (iii). This relies 
on the assumption that a weekday is a working day. There are no official statistics for 
Scotland that support or discredit this assumption, however, the European Working 
Conditions Survey concluded that working a five-day week from Monday to Friday was 
still the norm for most Europeans (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living 
and Working Conditions, 2012). Typical weekend day ST was calculated as the sum of 
the weekend day responses to (ii) and (iii). Relative contributions of the categories of 
behaviours to weekday and weekend day ST were calculated for each individual as the 
proportion of time spent in each category out of the respective totals.  
We undertook a comprehensive assessment of the validity and reliability 
evidence of the ST questions in the SHeS using the Edinburgh Framework as a guide 
(Kelly, Fitzsimons, & Baker, 2016). We found that limited high-quality evidence 
existed, but there were no major concerns (a summary of this work is included in 
Supplementary File 2). We acknowledge that the inherent limitation of self-reported 
data is the reliance on the participants’ recall, however, this is currently the optimal way 
of collecting nationally-representative data on total and behaviour-specific ST for adults 
in Scotland (Dall et al., 2017). 
Sample 
There were 14,367 adult participants in the 2012-13-14 SHeS. Due to missing data in 
 one or more of the component variables, 98 cases were excluded from the weekday 
analyses and 77 from the weekend day analyses (<1% of total cases). In line with 
previous similar research (Bennie et al., 2013; Bennie et al., 2016), cases were excluded 
if their total exceeded 16 hours per day as these were considered to be outliers (136 
cases for weekdays and 111 cases for weekend days; <1% of total cases). This left 
14,133 cases in the weekday analyses and 14,179 cases in the weekend day analyses. 
These were weighted to make the sample nationally-representative of adults living in 
private households in Scotland (see Table 1).  
Statistical analyses 
We used multiple linear regressions to investigate the differences in weekday and 
weekend day ST by 10-year age band (from age 16), sex, and any interaction between 
these terms. We repeated these analyses stratified by work status (whether undertaken 
paid or self-employed work in four weeks prior to interview (57% of the sample), or 
not), and for the relative and absolute contributions of the categories of sedentary 
behaviours. Only one regression analysis was performed on the relative contributions of 
the categories of behaviours of weekday ST amongst non-workers and for weekend day 
ST. This was because the two categories were reciprocals. The reference categories 
were males and those over the age of 75 years as these were the groups that previous 
work had identified as sitting the most (Bromley, 2013). The analyses stratified by work 
status were an exception to this as there were not sufficient numbers in the oldest age 
group amongst those in employment to make meaningful comparisons. In this case we 
used 65-74 year olds as the reference age group. 
There was strong evidence of digit preference for all the time variables as over 
99% of responses ended in the digits 0 or 5; (Beaman, Vaske, Donnelly, & Manfredo, 
1997; Kelly, 2013; Rietveld, 2001). Despite this, the underlying distributions of the 
 model residuals was approximately normal, with slight evidence of leptokurtis. 
Recommended strategies for dealing with these issues such as grouping observations 
into categories (Forthofer, Lee, & Hernandez, 2007), or performing transformations, did 
not alter the distribution pattern of the residuals and therefore the data were analysed as 
planned. 
All analyses were performed in STATA version 14. Due to the stratified 
clustered sampling design (see Bromley et al. (2015)), we used Taylor-Series 
linearisation methods to estimate the variance. This was necessary because when a 
sample is clustered and/or stratified, the observations are not independent and 
identically distributed (an assumption of normal variance estimation techniques) 
(Heeringa, West, & Berglund, 2010). We have not used any cut-off to determine 
statistical significance but have presented the 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-
values (see Supplementary Tables), and have interpreted the results based on these 
factors and overall trends. 
 
Results 
Weekday sedentary time for men and women, by age group 
Figure 1 and Table 1 show the mean reported typical weekday ST of adults in Scotland. 
There was strong evidence to suggest that, for men, the youngest age group (16-24 year 
olds) reported less ST than the oldest age group (over 75 years; 6.6 (6.3-6.9) compared 
to 7.4 (7.2-7.6) hours/day; p<0.001). There was some evidence to suggest the middle-
age groups reported higher levels of ST than the oldest age group; 45-54 year olds 
reported 7.8 (7.6-7.8) compared to 7.4 (7.2-7.6) hours/day (p=0.007). However, we 
should be cautious not to over-interpret a 0.4 hour (24-minute) difference. For women, 
 there was strong evidence to suggest that the over 75s reported more ST than all other 
age groups (ranging between 6.6-6.9 (6.4-7.1) hours/day for 16-74 year olds compared 
to 7.4 (7.2-7.6) hours/day for the over 75s. We reached this conclusion as there was no 
evidence for a main effect of sex, but the p-values and confidence intervals suggested a 
main effect for 16-24 year olds and interaction effects between ages of 25 and 74. There 
was no difference in the reported weekday ST of men and women over the age of 75 
years, but the interaction effect p-values suggest that women reported less ST than men 
between the ages of 25 and 74 (all p<0.05). See Supplementary Table 1 for regression 
results. 
***Insert Figure 1 and Table 1*** 
Weekday sedentary time, stratified by work status 
Figure 2 and Table 1 show the mean reported weekday ST of adults in Scotland, 
stratified by work status. For those in work (Figure 2A), the trends were similar to those 
for all adults, except that there was no evidence of any differences between the sexes. 
The youngest age group (16-24 year olds) were the only age group where there was 
evidence to suggest lower levels of reported ST compared to 65-74 year olds (6.8 (6.4-
7.2) for men and women compared to 7.3-7.7 (6.7-8.2) hours/day; p=0.003). For those 
not in work (Figure 2B), there were clear differences by sex (relevant interaction effect 
p-values between ages of 25-65 years all ≤0.001). For men, again, it was only the 16-24 
year olds where there was strong evidence to suggest lower levels of reported ST 
compared those over 75 years (6.3 (5.9-6.6) hours/day compared to 7.4 hours/day; 
p<0.001). However, for women, a j-shaped pattern was evident where those aged 25-44 
years reported the lowest levels of ST (5.2-5.4 (4.9- 5.6) hours/day), but the highest 
levels of reported ST were amongst those over the age of 65 (6.7-7.4 (6.5-7.6) 
hours/day). See Supplementary Table 1 for regression results. 
 ***Insert Figure 2 *** 
Weekend day sedentary time 
Figure 3 and Table 2 show that the association between reported weekend day ST and 
age group followed a j-shaped pattern for both sexes. Those aged 25 to 54 reported the 
lowest levels of weekend day ST (5.2-5.7 (5.0-5.9) hours/day). There was strong 
evidence to suggest that those over the age of 75 reported the most ST (7.3-7.4 (7.1-7.7) 
hours/day compared to 5.2-6.9 (5.0-7.1) hours/day for 16-65 year olds; all p≤0.001). 
See Supplementary Table 2 for regression results.  
***Insert Figure 3 and Table 2*** 
Relative contributions of the categories of behaviours of weekday sedentary 
time 
Figure 4 shows the mean relative contributions of the categories of behaviours to 
weekday ST, stratified by work status (see Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 for 95% CIs 
and regression results). For those that worked (Figure 4A), the relative contribution of 
sitting time at work was highest for both sexes between the ages of 25 to 64 (35-45% 
(33-47%) compared to 33.6% (30-37%) for men and 31% (26-36%) for women aged 
65-74 years; all p<0.01). For those aged 16 to 74 years, leisure TV/screen ST showed 
the converse relationship. The highest contributions were seen amongst 16-24 year olds 
(50% (47-54%) for men and 45% (42-47%) for women). Other leisure ST was relatively 
constant between the ages of 16-74, ranging between 19 and 30% (18-32%).  
Amongst those not in work (Figure 4B), the lowest contribution of leisure 
TV/screen ST (57-58% (55-59%)) and the highest contribution of other leisure ST (42-
43% (41-45%)) was evident in those over the age of 75 (p<0.001 compared to all other 
age groups). For men, there was a gradual decline with age of the relative contribution 
 of leisure TV/screen ST, whilst for females there was some evidence of a peak in 
middle-age. 
Relative contributions of weekend day sedentary time 
Figure 5 shows the mean relative contributions of the categories of behaviours of 
weekend day ST (see Supplementary Table 3 and 4 for 95% CIs and regression results). 
Men over 75 years spent the lowest proportion of their weekend day ST watching TV or 
other screens compared to all other age groups (56% (54-58%) compared to 61-65% 
(60-68%) for 16-74 year olds; all p<0.001). This trend was not apparent amongst 
women where the division between leisure TV/screen ST and other leisure ST was more 
consistent between the age groups (ranging between 56-60% (55-62%); interaction 
effects for age groups between 16-65 years all p<0.05). This interaction effect could 
also be interpreted as indicating lower relative contributions of leisure TV/screen ST to 
weekend day ST for women compared with men, except in the oldest two age groups.

Discussion 
The main finding from this paper is that including work ST in the estimates for weekday 
ST changes our understanding of how ST varies by age and sex for adults in Scotland. 
Without its inclusion, we see a j-shaped curve with the oldest age groups being most 
sedentary, and middle-aged adults the least. Our results indicate that this is only the case 
for women who do not work; all others demonstrate a different relationship between age 
group and weekday ST. 
We have also found that, for those in work, up to 45% of weekday ST is 
accumulated at work. Leisure TV/screen ST made up over half of leisure ST for all age 
groups, both sexes, those in and out of employment, on weekdays and weekend days. 
 Weekday sedentary time including sitting time at work 
The previous analyses of SHeS and HSE data have led to the assumption that older 
adults are the most sedentary age group within the UK (British Heart Foundation, 
2014). Our results challenge that perception and stress the need to analyse the data on 
ST at work from UK national surveys. Without these analyses the potential health risk 
associated with ST is being underestimated for the working population. Our results also 
suggest that we need interventions to tackle high levels of ST in early and middle-age 
where patterns may develop, and that the workplace could be an appropriate place to 
target.  
Our results are supported by some international multi-country studies that have 
also failed to show an increase in ST with age (Bauman et al., 2011; Bennie et al., 2013; 
Loyen, van der Ploeg, Bauman, Brug, & Lakerveld, 2016). This could be due to the 
method: all of these studies used a single item to ask about sitting time on a ‘usual’ day, 
although two of them specified weekday (Bauman et al., 2011; Bennie et al., 2013). 
Contrary to the present results, however, two of these reported the highest levels of ST 
amongst young adults (Bauman et al., 2011; Loyen, van der Ploeg, et al., 2016). It is 
possible that these mixed results could be explained by variations in the reference 
group. Our study chose to use the oldest age group, while others choose the youngest 
(Bennie et al., 2013), second youngest (Loyen, van der Ploeg, et al., 2016), or middle 
aged adults (Bauman et al., 2011). As this group drives all the comparisons, it is 
particularly important that this group have a sufficient sample size to enable differences 
to be detected, and are representative of their target population. In the present study, the 
older adult sample in the SHeS should be representative of those living in private 
households. However, this does not include those in medical or long-term care 
 establishments who may be more sedentary than respondents to the survey (Bromley et 
al., 2015). 
We also found that, amongst adults that do not work, the relationship between 
age group and reported weekday ST was different for men and women. We speculate 
that the difference between middle aged men and women could be due to different 
reasons for not being at work: women may be more likely to be involved in childcare, 
which may involve lower levels of ST, whilst men may be more likely to be unable to 
work for health reasons, which may result higher levels of ST. These speculations are 
tentatively supported by Eurostat data for the United Kingdom: in 2013, 5% of men 
compared to 29% of women stated their main reason for not seeking employment was 
“looking after children or incapacitated adults”, while 31% of men and 18% of women 
gave “own illness or disability” as their answer (Eurostat, 2016).  If this sex difference 
is confirmed in other datasets using other populations and other measurement methods, 
then further research should investigate the potential reasons for these differences. 
In the present study, the average reported ST for men and women ranged 
between 6.6-7.8 hours on weekdays and 5.2-7.4 hours on weekend days for the different 
age groups. These figures are slightly higher than some estimates from international 
studies using self-report questionnaires. The 2013 Eurobarometer survey asked over 
24,000 inhabitants (≥15 years) of EU member states a single-item question on sitting. 
The whole sample mean was 4.9 hours, and the Great Britain sub-sample mean was 5.0 
hours (Milton, Gale, Stamatakis, & Bauman, 2015). A recent review of population-level 
estimates for daily ST in European countries found the averages reported ranged 
between 2.5 hours/day to 10.3 hours/day, and UK studies had the largest variation of 
any nation (Loyen, Verloigne, et al., 2016). The large variation may be attributable to 
the variety of self-report and device-based measurement methods used, and the statistics 
 reported (medians and means). These results strengthen the case for further work is to 
find a common solution to measuring ST at a population-level (Dall et al., 2017). This 
will help us to fully understand the potential health-burden that it is placing on our 
society.  
Behaviour-specific sedentary time 
Our results show that for those that work, work ST makes up between one-quarter to 
nearly half of weekday ST. This justifies its inclusion in prevalence estimates. However, 
it is unclear why these proportions are lower than usual ranges reported in the literature 
(Clemes, O'Connell, & Edwardson, 2014; Clemes, Patel, Mahon, & Griffiths, 2014; 
Kazi, Duncan, Clemes, & Haslam, 2014; Ryan, Dall, Granat, & Grant, 2011), 
particularly, as described above, when the overall ST estimates are fractionally higher 
than other studies. We cannot rule out that that it is due to differences in measurement 
methods and/or contexts. The studies cited above use a variety of methods (objective, 
subjective, and a combination), and so it is possible that the context of data collection 
(e.g. in a wider health survey, or a specific study on sitting time at work) affected the 
reporting of domain-specific ST. 
Like others, we found that leisure TV/screen ST was a greater contributor to 
leisure ST than other behaviours such as reading or eating (Clemes et al., 2015; Kazi et 
al., 2014). This applied to all adults, although was evident to the greatest extent amongst 
the 16-24 year olds. The cross-sectional nature of these data prevents us from making 
judgements as to whether this is a societal change that will continue as the current 16-24 
year olds age, or whether it is a feature of that age group. It is nonetheless concerning 
given the potentially greater deleterious effects on health that TV viewing has compared 
to other sedentary behaviours (Ekelund et al., 2016). 
 We did not find substantial differences by sex in the relative contributions of the 
categories of behaviours. This is in contrast to the findings of Proper, Cerin, Brown, and 
Owen (2007). This may be due to the fact they looked at differences in individual 
activities rather than categories of behaviours in a sample of working-age Australian 
adults.  
Implications for policy and practice  
Based on these results, we would recommend that policy-makers in Scotland address 
the levels of ST amongst the adult population. The average weekday ST reported by the 
men and women in the different age groups ranged between 6.6 and 7.8 hours/day (95% 
CI 6.3-8.0). This implies that a large proportion of the population are at an increased 
risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers 
amongst adults (Biswas et al., 2015; Chau et al., 2013; Pandey et al., 2016). A first step 
would be the addition of an appropriate indicator to the existing framework for 
monitoring physical activity levels in Scotland: the ‘Active Scotland Outcomes 
Framework’ (The Scottish Government, 2014).  
Our results suggest that a key target group for intervention are early-to-middle 
aged adults who are in employment. They reported some of the highest weekday ST 
levels (group averages over 7 hours per day), close to half of which was accumulated at 
work. A recent review by Shrestha et al. (2016) found tentative evidence to suggest sit-
to-stand desks could reduce work ST, at least in the short term. There was limited high 
quality evidence for other intervention types and so we support their call for more well-
designed studies in this area. Regardless of sex or employment status, adults in Scotland 
accumulated more of their leisure ST through TV/screen time than other leisure-time 
sedentary behaviours. Wu, Sun, He, and Jiang (2016) found that interventions involving 
 health promotion or counselling rather than automated monitoring of screen time were 
most effective. This suggests interventions could be targeted at reducing TV/screen 
time, however, national surveillance in Scotland should decide whether the current level 
of behaviour-specific detail is appropriate to inform such interventions.  
The challenge for researchers and policy-makers together, is to interpret the 
constantly evolving evidence that currently implies an interaction between levels of 
physical activity and ST on health outcomes (Ekelund et al., 2015), into clear public 
health messages. It may be, as Buckley et al. (2015) suggest, that encouraging people to 
“simply get standing and moving more frequently” could be the “first behavioural step” 
towards a healthier lifestyle as it is potentially more achievable than the aerobic 
physical activity guidelines (Department of Health, 2011).  
 
Strengths and limitations 
This paper is the first to use nationally representative data to show the differences by 
age and sex in the reported ST amongst adults in Scotland. In England, the HSE uses 
the same questions and method for deriving estimates for ST as the SHeS (Craig & 
Mindell, 2013), and the levels of ST are similar between the nations (Scholes & 
Mindell, 2013). Therefore, one would expect similar results if one repeated this analyses 
on the HSE data. 
There are some limitations to this study and it is important to consider what 
effect they may have on the interpretation of the results.  
Firstly, the data are self-reported and are therefore prone to error (random and 
systematic) in the recall process (Atkin et al., 2012). Some but not all studies have 
found that self-reported methods often produce lower estimates of ST compared to 
 objective measures (Healy et al., 2011). This would only strengthen the case for 
addressing the issue of high ST amongst adults in Scotland. However, it is important to 
remember thatself-report is the only realistic method of measurement for population-
level surveillance in Scotland at present, and has the benefit of providing behaviour-
level information (Dall et al., 2017).  
Secondly, participants may not report some ST because they are carrying out 
activities that are not explicitly prompted. For example, time spent in motorised 
transport is not explicitly mentioned in the questions, nor is time spent sitting at school 
or university. The latter may particularly affect the youngest age group and is a potential 
explanation for their lower levels of reported ST. 
Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we have shown that the relationship between weekday ST and age 
and sex differs from our current understanding when ST at work is included in the 
measure. Our results challenge the conventional understanding that older adults in 
Scotland report the highest levels of ST, as the majority of middle-aged adults reported 
similar levels to older adults. In light of these results, we suggest changing the way 
national prevalence estimates are calculated for Scotland and England, so that they 
include ST at work. We have also shown the division of ST in three categories of 
behaviours. Based on these results, we recommend that ST at work amongst early-to-
middle aged adults and leisure TV/screen time for all adults are considered as targets for 
interventions to reduce ST.
