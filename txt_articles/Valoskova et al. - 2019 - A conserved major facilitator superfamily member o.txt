Abstract Aberrant display of the truncated core1 O-glycan T-antigen is a common feature of
human cancer cells that correlates with metastasis. Here we show that T-antigen in Drosophila
melanogaster macrophages is involved in their developmentally programmed tissue invasion.
Higher macrophage T-antigen levels require an atypical major facilitator superfamily (MFS) member
that we named Minerva which enables macrophage dissemination and invasion. We characterize for
the first time the T and Tn glycoform O-glycoproteome of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo,
and determine that Minerva increases the presence of T-antigen on proteins in pathways previously
linked to cancer, most strongly on the sulfhydryl oxidase Qsox1 which we show is required for
macrophage tissue entry. Minerva’s vertebrate ortholog, MFSD1, rescues the minerva mutant’s
migration and T-antigen glycosylation defects. We thus identify a key conserved regulator that
orchestrates O-glycosylation on a protein subset to activate a program governing migration steps
important for both development and cancer metastasis.

Introduction
The set of proteins expressed by a cell defines much of its potential capacities. However, a diverse
set of modifications can occur after the protein is produced to alter its function and thus determine
the cell’s final behavior. One of the most frequent and variable of such alterations is glycosylation, in
which sugars are added onto the oxygen (O) of a serine or threonine or onto the nitrogen (N) of an
asparagine (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985; Marshall, 1972; Ohtsubo and Marth, 2006). O-linked
addition can occur on cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins in eukaryotes (Comer and Hart, 2000;
Hart et al., 2011), but the most extensive N- and O- linked glycosylation occurs during the transit of
a protein through the secretory pathway. A series of sugar molecules are added starting in the endo-
plasmic reticulum (ER) or cis-Golgi and continuing to be incorporated and removed until passage
through the trans Golgi network is complete (Aebi, 2013; Stanley et al., 2009). N-linked glycosyla-
tion is initiated in the ER at consensus NxS/T X6¼P site, whereas the most common GalNAc-type
O-linked glycosylation is initiated in the early Golgi and glycosites display no clear sequence motifs,
apart from a prevalence of neighboring prolines (Bennett et al., 2012; Thanka Christlet and
Valoskova et al. eLife 2019;8:e41801. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.41801

 Veluraja, 2001). Glycosylation can affect protein folding, stability and localization as well as serve
specific roles in fine-tuning protein processing and functions such as protein adhesion and signaling
(Goth et al., 2018; Varki, 2017). The basic process by which such glycosylation occurs has been
well studied. However our understanding of how specific glycan structures participate in modulating
particular cellular functions is still at its beginning.
The need to understand the regulation of O-glycosylation is particularly relevant for cancer
(Fu et al., 2016; Ha
¨uselmann and Borsig, 2014). The truncated O-glycans called T and Tn antigen
are not normally found on most mature human cells (Cao et al., 1996) but up to 95% of cells from
many cancer types display these at high levels (Boland et al., 1982; Cao et al., 1996; Howard and
Taylor, 1980; Limas and Lange, 1986; Orntoft et al., 1985; Springer, 1984; Springer et al.,
1975). The T O-glycan structure (Galb1-3GalNAca1-O-Ser/Thr) is synthesized by the large family of
polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (GalNAc-Ts) that initiate protein O-glycosylation by adding Gal-
NAc to form Tn antigen and the core1 synthase C1GalT1 that adds Gal to the initial GalNAc residues
(Tian and Ten Hagen, 2009) to form T antigen (Figure 1A). The human C1GalT1 synthase requires a
dedicated chaperone, COSMC, for folding and ER exit (Ju and Cummings, 2005). In adult humans
these O-glycans are normally capped by sialic acids and/or elongated and branched into complex
structures (Tarp and Clausen, 2008). However, in cancer this elongation and branching is reduced
or absent and the appearance of these truncated T and Tn O-glycans correlates positively with can-
cer aggressiveness and negatively with long-term prognoses for many cancers in patients
(Baldus et al., 2000; Carrasco et al., 2013; Ferguson et al., 2014; MacLean and Longenecker,
1991; Schindlbeck et al., 2005; Springer, 1997; Springer, 1989; Summers et al., 1983; Yu et al.,
2007). The molecular basis for the enhanced appearance of T antigen in cancers is not clear
(Chia et al., 2016), although higher Golgi pH in cancer cells correlates with increases in T antigen
(Kellokumpu et al., 2002). Interestingly, T antigen is also observed as a transient fetal modification
(Barr et al., 1989) and cancer cells frequently recapitulate processes that happened earlier in devel-
opment (Cofre and Abdelhay, 2017; Pierce, 1974). Identifying new mechanisms that regulate T
antigen modifications developmentally has the potential to lead to insights into cancer biology.
Drosophila as a classic genetic model system is an excellent organism in which to investigate
these questions. Drosophila displays T antigen as the predominant form of GalNAc-, or mucin-type,
O-glycosylation in the embryo with 18% of the T glycans being further elaborated, predominantly by
the addition of GlcA (Aoki et al., 2008). As in vertebrates, the GalNAc-T isoenzymes directing the
eLife digest Proteins, the workhorses of the body, participate in virtually every single process in
a cell. Different types of molecules, such as sugars, can be added onto a protein to change its role
or location, but this process may also play a role in cancer. Indeed, tumor cells that contain certain
sugar modifications are more likely to be able to spread through the body. For example, a specific
combination of sugars called T antigen is rarely present in healthy adult cells; yet, it is commonly
found in cancer cells that leave the tumor where they were born and invade another tissue to form a
new tumor. However, it is not clear whether T antigen actively helps this process inside the body, or
is simply present during it.
To answer this question, Valoskova
�
, Biebl et al. used genetic and biochemistry tools to study
developing fruit fly embryos, where certain immune cells carry T antigen on their proteins. Like
invading cancer cells, these immune cells can get inside tissues during development. The
experiments revealed that a protein called Minerva helps attach T antigen onto proteins. When
embryos were engineered to contain less Minerva, the amount of T antigen in the immune cells
dropped, and the cells could not easily make their way into tissues anymore. When the mouse
version of Minerva was then added to the embryos, the immune cells of the fruit flies had higher T
antigen levels on their proteins and could invade tissues again.
Some of the proteins targeted by Minerva were known to be involved in cancer, but not all of
them. Future experiments will investigate which role the human version of Minerva plays in cancer
cells that get inside new tissues, and if it could help us predict whether a cancer is likely to spread.

 initial step of GalNAc addition to serines and threonines are numerous in Drosophila, with several
already known to display conserved substrate specificity in vitro with their vertebrate orthologs
(Mu
¨ller et al., 2005; Schwientek et al., 2002; Ten Hagen et al., 2003). The Drosophila GalNAc-Ts
affect extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion, gut acidification and the formation of the respiratory sys-
tem (Tian and Ten Hagen, 2006; Tran et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2010). In flies the main enzyme
adding Gal to form T antigen is C1GalTA (Mu
¨ller et al., 2005) whose absence causes defects in ven-
tral nerve cord (vnc) condensation during Stage 17, hematopoetic stem cell maintenance, and neuro-
muscular junction formation (Fuwa et al., 2015; Itoh et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2008; Yoshida et al.,
2008). While orthologous to the vertebrate Core1 synthases, the Drosophila C1GALTs differ in not
requiring a specific chaperone (Mu
¨ller et al., 2005). Most interestingly, T antigen is found on embry-
onic macrophages (Yoshida et al., 2008), a cell type which can penetrate into tissues in a manner
akin to metastatic cancer (Ratheesh et al., 2018; Siekhaus et al., 2010). Macrophage invasion of
the germband (Figure 1B, arrow in Figure 1C) occurs between the closely apposed ectoderm and
mesoderm (Ratheesh et al., 2018; Siekhaus et al., 2010) from late Stage 11 through Stage 12. This
invasion occurs as part of the dispersal of macrophages throughout the embryo (Figure 1C) along
other routes that are mostly noninvasive, such as along the inner ventral nerve cord (vnc) (arrowhead
in Figure 1C) (Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein, 1997; Evans et al., 2010). Given these potentially
related but previously unconsolidated observations, we sought to determine the relationship
between the appearance of T antigen and macrophage invasion and to use the genetic power of
Drosophila to find new pathways by which this glycophenotype is regulated.
Results
T antigen is enriched and required in invading macrophages in
Drosophila embryos
To identify glycan structures present on fly embryonic macrophages during invasion we performed a
screen examining FITC-labelled lectins (see Materials and methods for abbreviations). Only two

showing macrophages (red) disseminating from the head mesoderm in Stage 9. By Stage 10, they migrate towards the extended germband, the dorsal
vessel and along the ventral nerve cord (vnc). At late Stage 11 germband invasion (arrow) begins and continues during germband retraction. Arrowhead
highlights migration along the vnc in late Stage 12. (D) Table summarizing a screen of glycosylation-binding lectins for staining on macrophages

 lectins had higher staining on macrophages than on surrounding tissues (labeled enriched): PNA,
which primarily binds to the core1 T O-glycan, and UEA-I, which can recognize Fuca1-2Galb1-
4GlcNAc(Molin et al., 1986; Natchiar et al., 2007) (Figure 1D, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–

(Agrawal et al., 2017; Hung et al., 2014). SBA, WGA, GS-II, GS-I, ConA, MPA and BPA bound at
similar or lower levels on Drosophila macrophages compared to flanking tissues (Figure 1D, Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1C–I). We saw no staining with the sialic acid-recognizing lectin LPA, and
none with DBA and HPA, that both recognize a-GalNAc (Piller et al., 1990) (Figure 1D, Figure 1—
figure supplement 1J–L). Thus PNA and UEA-I display enriched macrophage binding during their
embryonic invasive migration.
To confirm T antigen as the source of the upregulated PNA signal in embryonic macrophages
during invasion and to characterize its temporal and spatial enrichment, we used a monoclonal anti-
body (mAb 3C9) to the T O-glycan structure (Steentoft et al., 2011). Through Stage 10, macro-
phages displayed very little T antigen staining, similar to other tissues (Figure 1E,F). However, at
late Stage 11 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) and early Stage 12, when macrophages start to
invade the extended germband, T antigen staining began to be enriched on macrophages moving
towards and into the germband (Figure 1E–H). Our results are consistent with findings showing T
antigen expression in a macrophage-like pattern in late Stage 12 embryos, and on a subset of mac-
rophages at Stage 16 (Yoshida et al., 2008). We knocked down the core1 synthase C1GalTA
required for the final step of T antigen synthesis (Figure 1A) (Lin et al., 2008; Mu
¨ller et al., 2005)
using RNAi expression only in macrophages and observed strongly reduced staining (Figure 1I, Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1M). We conclude that the antibody staining is the result of T antigen
produced by macrophages themselves.
To determine if these T O-glycans on macrophages are important for facilitating their germband
invasion, we knocked down C1GalTA in macrophages with the RNAi line utilized above as well as
one other and used the P element excision allele C1GalTA[2.1] which removes conserved sequence
motifs required for activity (Lin et al., 2008). We visualized macrophages through specific expression
of fluorescent markers and observed a 25 and a 33% decrease in their number in the germband for
the RNAis (Figure 1J,K), and a 44% decrease in the C1GalTA[2.1] mutant (Figure 1L). When we
counted the number of macrophages sitting on the yolk next to the germband in the strongest RNAi
we observed an increase (Figure 1—figure supplement 1N) that we also observed in the C1GalT
mutant (Figure 1—figure supplement 1O). The sum of the macrophages in the yolk and germband
is the same in the control, RNAi knockdown (control 136.5 ± 6.4, RNAi 142.3 ± 6.6, p=0.7) and
mutant (control 138.5 ± 4.9, mutant, 142.3 ± 7.4, p=0.87) arguing that macrophages in which
C1GalTA levels are reduced cannot enter the germband but are retained on the yolk. We observed
no effect on the migration of macrophages on the vnc, a route that does not require tissue invasion
(Figure 1—figure supplement 1P) (Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein, 1997; Evans et al., 2010).
18% of T antigen in the embryo has been found to be further modified, predominantly by
glucuronic acid (GlcA) (Aoki et al., 2008). Of the three GlcA transferases found in Drosophila only
GlcAT-P is robustly capable of adding GlcA onto the T O-glycan structure in cells (Breloy et al.,
2016; Itoh et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2003). To examine if the specific defect in germband invasion
that we observed by blocking the formation of T antigen is due to the need for a further elaboration
by GlcA, we utilized a lethal MI{MIC} transposon insertion mutant in the GlcAT-P gene. We observed
no change in the numbers of macrophages within the germband in the GlcAT-PMI05251 mutant
(Figure 1M) and a 20% increase in the number of macrophages on the yolk (Figure 1—figure sup-
plement 1Q). Therefore, our results strongly suggest that the T antigen we observe being upregu-
lated in macrophages as they move towards and into the germband is itself needed for efficient
tissue invasion.
An atypical MFS member acts in macrophages to increase T antigen
levels
We sought to determine which proteins could temporally regulate the increase in the appearance of
T O-glycans in invading macrophages. We first considered proteins required for synthesizing the
core1 structure, namely the T synthase, C1GalTA, and the UDP-Gal sugar transporter, Ugalt
(Aumiller and Jarvis, 2002) (Figure 1A). However, q-PCR analysis of FACS sorted macrophages
from Stage 9–10, Stage 12, and Stage 13–17 show that though both are enriched in macrophages,

 neither is transcriptionally upregulated before or during Stage 12 (Figure 2A,B). We therefore exam-
ined the Bloomington Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) in situ database looking for predicted
sugar binding proteins expressed in macrophages with similar timing to the observed T antigen
increase (Tomancak et al., 2007; Tomancak et al., 2002). We identified CG8602, a predicted mem-
ber of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS), a protein group defined by shared structural features,
whose members are known to transport a diverse set of molecules across membranes (Yan, 2015).
CG8602 contains regions of homology to known sugar responsive proteins and predicted sugar or
neurotransmitter transporters (Figure 2C) and in a phylogenetic analysis is on a branch neighboring
the SLC29 group shown to be involved in nucleoside transport (Baldwin et al., 2004; Perland et al.,
2017). BDGP in situ hybridizations (Tomancak et al., 2007; Tomancak et al., 2002) (http://insitu.

nally deposited, with expression throughout the embryo through Stage 4 after which its levels
decrease, with weak ubiquitous expression continuing through Stage 9–10. This is followed by
strong enrichment in macrophages from Stage 11–12, with apparently equivalent levels of expres-
sion in macrophages entering the germband as in those migrating along other routes such as the
ventral nerve cord. We confirmed this by q-PCR analysis of FACS sorted macrophages, which
detected seven-fold higher levels of CG8602 RNA in macrophages than in the rest of the embryo by
Stage 9–10 and 12-fold by Stage 12 (Figure 2D). These data show that RNA expression of CG8602,
an MFS protein with homology to sugar transporters, increases in macrophages preceding and dur-
ing the period of invasion.
To determine if CG8602 could affect T antigen levels, we examined a viable P-element insertion
mutant in the 5’UTR, CG8602EP3102 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). This insertion displays
strongly reduced CG8602 expression in FACS-sorted macrophages to 15% of wild type levels, as
assessed by q-PCR (Figure 2E). We also created an excision allele, D33, removing the 5’UTR flanking
the P-element, the start methionine, and 914 bp of the ORF (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A).
This is a lethal allele, and the line carrying it over a balancer is very weak; exceedingly few embryos
are laid and the embryos homozygous for the mutation do not develop past Stage 12. Therefore,
we did not continue experiments with this allele, and instead utilized the insertion mutant. This
CG8602EP3102 P-element mutant displays decreased T antigen staining on macrophages moving
toward and entering the germband (Figure 2F) in Stage 11 through late Stage 12. q-PCR analysis on

 FACS sorted macrophages show that the reduction in T antigen levels in the mutant is not caused
by changes in the RNA levels of the T synthase C1GalTA or the Ugalt Gal and GalNAc transporter
(Aumiller and Jarvis, 2002; Segawa et al., 2002) (Figure 2G). These results argue that CG8602 is
required for enriched T antigen levels on macrophages.
To assess if CG8602 could directly regulate T antigen addition, we examined if it is found in the
Golgi where O-glycosylation is initiated. We first utilized the macrophage-like S2R+ cell line, trans-
fecting a FLAG::HA or 3xmCherry labeled form of CG8602 under the control of srpHemo or the cop-
per inducible MT promoter. We detected significant colocalization with markers for the cis-Golgi
marker GMAP, the Trans Golgi Network marker Golgin 245 and the endosome markers Rab7,
Rab11 and Hrs (Riedel et al., 2016) (Figure 2H, Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–G). We detected
no colocalization with markers for the nucleus, ER, peroxisomes, mitochondria or lysosomes
(Figure 2H, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,H–J). We confirmed the presence of CG8602 in the
Golgi and endosomes in macrophages from late Stage 11 embryos through colocalization with Gol-
gin 84 and Hrs, using cells extracted from positions in the head adjacent to the germband
(Figure 2I). We conclude that the T antigen enrichment on macrophages migrating towards and into
the germband requires a previously uncharacterized atypical MFS with homology to sugar binding
proteins that is localized predominantly to the Golgi and endosomes.
The MFS, Minerva, is required in macrophages for dissemination and
germband invasion
We examined if CG8602 affects macrophage invasive migration. The CG8602EP3102 mutant dis-
played a 35% reduction in macrophages within the germband at early Stage 12 compared to the
control (Figure 3A–B,D, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). The same decrease is observed when
the mutant is placed over the deficiency Df(3L)BSC117 that removes the gene entirely (Figure 3D),
arguing that CG8602EP3102 is a genetic null for macrophage germband invasion. The P element
transposon insertion itself causes the migration defect because its precise excision restored the num-
ber of macrophages in the germband to wild type levels (Figure 3D). Expression of the CG8602
gene in macrophages can rescue the CG8602EP3102 P element mutant (Figure 3C–D, Figure 3—fig-
ure supplement 1A), and RNAi knockdown of CG8602 in macrophages can recapitulate the mutant
phenotype (Figure 3E, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). Our data thus argue that CG8602 is
required in macrophages themselves for germband invasion.
Decreased numbers of macrophages in the extended germband could be caused by specific
problems entering this region, or by general migratory defects or a decreased total number of mac-
rophages. To examine the migratory step that precedes germband entry, we counted the number of
macrophages sitting on the yolk next to the germband in fixed embryos in the CG8602EP3102
mutant. We observed a 30% decrease compared to the control (Figure 3F), suggesting a defect in
early dissemination. Entry into the germband by macrophages occurs between the closely apposed
DE-Cadherin expressing ectoderm and the mesoderm and is accompanied by deformation of the
ectodermal cells (Ratheesh et al., 2018). We tested if reductions in DE-Cadherin could ameliorate
the germband phenotype. Indeed, combining the CG8602EP3102 mutation with shgP34 which reduces
DE-Cadherin expression (Pacquelet and Rørth, 2005; Tepass et al., 1996) produced a partial res-
cue (Figure 3G), consistent with CG8602 playing a role in germband entry as well as in an earlier
migratory step. There was no significant difference in the number of macrophages migrating along
the vnc in late Stage 12 compared to the control in fixed embryos (Figure 3H) from the
CG8602EP3102 mutant or from a knockdown in macrophages of CG8602 by RNAi (Figure 3—figure
supplement 1C), arguing against a general migratory defect. There was also no significant differ-
ence in the total number of macrophages in either case (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–E). From
analyzing the CG8602 mutant phenotype in fixed embryos we conclude that CG8602 does not affect
later vnc migration but is important for the early steps of dissemination and germband invasion.
To examine the effect of CG8602 on macrophage speed and dynamics, we performed live imag-
ing of macrophages labeled with the nuclear marker srpHemo-H2A::3xmCherry in control and
CG8602EP3102 mutant embryos (Figure 3—video 1 and 2). We first imaged macrophages migrating
from their initial position in the delaminated mesoderm up to the germband and detected a 33%
decrease in speed (2.46 ± 0.07 mm/min in the control, 1.66 ± 0.08 mm/min in the CG8602EP3102
mutant, p=0.002) (Figure 3I,J) and no significant decrease in persistence (0.43 ± 0.02 in the control,
0.40 ± 0.01 in the mutant, p=0.22) (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F). We then examined the initial

 migration of macrophages into the germband at late Stage 11. We observed a range of phenotypes
in the six movies we made of the mutant, with macrophages pausing at the germband edge from
twice to six times as long as in the control before invading into the tissue (Figure 3K shows average
time for entry, control = 22.00 ± 1.53 min, CG8602EP3102 mutant = 102.0 ± 20.35 min). As we
observed no change in the timing of the initiation of germband retraction (269.6 ± 9 min in control
and 267.1 ± 3 min in mutant, p=0.75) but did observe a decreased speed of its completion in the
mutant (107 ± 12 min from start to end of retraction in control and 133 ± 6 min for mutant p=0.05),
we only analyzed macrophages within the germband before its retraction begins. We observed a
43% reduction in macrophage speed within the germband (2.72 ± 0.32 mm/min in the control and
1.55 ± 0.04 mm/min in the mutant, p=0.02) (Figure 3L,M). To assess this phenotype’s specificity for
invasion, we used live imaging of macrophage migration along the inner vnc that occurs during the
same time period as germband entry; we observed no significant change in speed (2.41 ± 0.06 mm/
min in the control and 2.23 ± 0.01 mm/min in the mutant, p=0.11) or directionality (0.43 ± 0.03 in the
control and 0.43 ± 0.02 in the mutant, p=0.9742) (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G, Figure 3—
video 3). We conclude from the sum of our experiments in fixed and live embryos that CG8602 is
important for the initial disseminatory migration out of the head and for invasive migration into and
within the germband, but does not alter general migration. We name the gene minerva (mrva), for
the Roman goddess who was initially trapped in the head of her father, Jupiter, after he swallowed
her pregnant mother who had turned herself into a fly.

(n = 37) and mrva3102 mutant/Df(3L)BSC117 that removes the gene (n = 23) shows that the mutant significantly decreases migration into the extended
germband (p<0.0001 for control vs mutant, p=-0002 for control vs Df cross). This defect can be partially rescued by expression in macrophages of
srpHemo >mrva::FLAG::HA (n = 18, p=0.222 for control vs rescue, p=0.036 for mutant vs rescue) and completely rescued by precise excision (mrvaD32)

 Minerva is not required for border cell invasion or germ cell migration
To assess if Minerva only affects macrophage invasion or also other types of tissue penetration in
Drosophila, we examined the migration of germ cells and border cells. Germ cells move in an Integ-
rin-independent fashion through gaps in the midgut created by ingressing formerly epithelial cells
(Devenport and Brown, 2004; Seifert and Lehmann, 2012). We found no defect in germ cell
migration when examining control and mrva3102 mutant embryos stained with the Vasa Ab (Fig-
ure 3—figure supplement 1H–I). Border cells are born in the epithelia surrounding the ovary and
then delaminate to move invasively between the nurse cells towards the oocyte (Montell, 2003),
guided by the same receptor that macrophages use during their embryonic dispersal, PVR
(Duchek et al., 2001). They migrate as a tumbling collective, using invadopodia and Cadherin-based
adhesion to progress (Cai et al., 2014; Niewiadomska et al., 1999). mrva is expressed in dissected
control ovaries and the mrva3102 mutant reduces the levels of mrva RNA in the ovary by 70%, similar
to the reduction observed in macrophages (Figure 3—figure supplement 1J). We identified border
cells by staining with DAPI to detect their clustered nuclei. We observed no significant change in
border cell migration towards the oocyte in the mrva3102 mutant compared to the control (Figure 3—
figure supplement 1K–L). These results support the conclusion that Mrva is not generally required
for all migratory cells that move confined through tissues during development, but specifically for
the invasion of macrophages, which is an Integrin-dependent process (Siekhaus et al., 2010).
Minerva affects a small fraction of the Drosophila embryonic
O-glycoproteome
We set out to determine if Minerva induces T glycoforms on particular proteins. We first conducted
a Western Blot with a mAb to T antigen on whole embryo extracts. We used the whole embryo
because we were unable to obtain enough protein from FACS sorted macrophages or to isolate
CRISPR-induced full knockouts of minerva in the S2R+ macrophage like cell line. We observed that
several bands detected with the anti-T mAb were absent or reduced in the minerva mutant
(Figure 4A), indicating an effect on the T antigen modification of a subset of proteins.
We wished to obtain a more comprehensive view of the proteins affected by Minerva. Since there
is little information about Drosophila O-glycoproteins and O-glycosites (Schwientek et al., 2007;
Aoki and Tiemeyer, 2010), we used lectin-enriched O-glycoproteomics to identify proteins display-
ing T and Tn glycoforms in Stage 11/12 embryos from wild type and mrva3102 mutants (Figure 4—
figure supplement 1A). We labeled tryptic digests of embryonic protein extracts from control or
mutant embryos with stable dimethyl groups carrying medium (C2H2D4) or light (C2H6) isotopes
respectively to allow each genotype to be identified in mixed samples (Boersema et al., 2009;
Schjoldager et al., 2012; Schjoldager et al., 2015). The pooled extracts were passed over a Jacalin
column to enrich for T and Tn O-glycopeptides; the eluate was analyzed by mass spectrometry to
identify and quantify T and Tn modified glycopeptides in the wild type and the mutant sample
through a comparison of the ratio of the light and medium isotope labeling channels for each glyco-
peptide (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–C for example spectra).
In the wild type we identified T and Tn glycopeptides at 936 glycosites derived from 270 proteins
(Supplementary file 1 and Figure 4B). 62% of the identified O-glycoproteins and 77% of identified
glycosites contained only Tn O-glycans. 33% of the identified O-glycoproteins and 23% of glycosites
displayed a mixture of T or Tn O-glycans, and 5% of identified O-glycoproteins and 4% of glycosites
had solely T O-glycans (Figure 4C). In agreement with previous studies (Steentoft et al., 2013),
only one glycosite was found in most of the identified O-glycoproteins (44%) (Figure 4D). In 20% we
found two sites, and some glycoproteins had up to 27 glycosites. The identified O-glycosites were
mainly on threonine residues, (78.5%) with some on serines (21.2%) and very few on tyrosines (0.3%)
(Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). Metabolism, cuticle development, and receptors were the most
common functional assignments for the glycoproteins (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E).
We sought to assess the changes in glycosylation in the mrva mutant. A majority of the quantifi-
able Tn and T O-glycoproteome was unaltered between the wild type and the mrva3102 mutant, with
only 63 proteins (23%) showing more than a three-fold change and 18 (6%) a ten-fold shift
(Figure 4F). We observed both increases and decreases in the levels of T and Tn modification on
proteins in the mutant (Figure 4F–G, Supplementary file 1 and 2), but a greater number of proteins
showed decreased rather than increased T antigen levels. 67% of the vertebrate orthologs of

 Drosophila proteins displaying shifts in this O-glycosylation have previously been linked to cancer
(Figure 4H, Supplementary file 2). These proteins were affected at specific sites, with 40% of glyco-
sites on these proteins changed more than three fold and only 14% more than ten fold. The glyco-
site shifts in T antigen occurred either without significant alterations in Tn (33% of glycosites had
only decreased T antigen, 17% of glycosites had only increased T antigen) or with changes in T anti-
gen occurring in the same direction as the changes in Tn (22% of glycosites both Tn and T antigen
increased, 22% of glycosites both Tn and T decreased) (Supplementary file 2). Only 1% of glyco-
sites displayed decreased T antigen with a significant increase in Tn. Interestingly, a higher propor-
tion of the glycoproteins with altered O-glycosylation in the mrva3102 mutant had multiple glycosites
than the general glycoproteome (Figure 4D) (p value=0.005 for ten-fold changes). We conclude that
Minerva affects O-glycosylation occupancy on a small subset of O-glycoproteins, many of whose ver-
tebrate orthologs have been linked to cancer, with both T and Tn O-glycopeptides being affected.
Minerva raises T antigen levels on proteins required for invasion
Given that blocking Tn to T conversion through the knockdown of the C1GalTA enzyme resulted in a
germband invasion defect, we examined the known functions of the 18 proteins with lower T antigen
in the absence of Minerva to distinguish which processes Minerva could influence to facilitate inva-
sion (Figure 4H). We excluded two proteins involved in eggshell and cuticle production. To spot
proteins whose reduced T antigen-containing glycopeptides are caused directly by alterations in gly-
cosylation rather than indirectly by decreased protein expression in the mrva mutant, we checked if
glycosylation at other identified glycosites was unchanged or increased. We identified ten such pro-
teins, several of which were in pathways that had been previously linked to invasion in vertebrates.
Qsox1, a predicted sulfhydryl oxidase required for the secretion and thus potential folding of EGF
repeats (Tien et al., 2008) showed the strongest alterations of any protein, with a 50-fold decrease
in T antigen levels in the mrva mutant (Figure 4I). The mammalian ortholog QSOX1 has been shown
to affect disulfide bond formation, is overexpressed in some cancers, promotes Matrigel invasion,
and can serve as a negative prognostic indicator in human cancer patients (Chakravarthi et al.,
2007; Katchman et al., 2011; Lake and Faigel, 2014). Dtg, with a 13-fold reduction in T antigen
(Hodar et al., 2014), and Put with a five-fold reduction (Letsou et al., 1995) respond to signaling by
the BMP-like ligand, Dpp. Dpp signaling directs histoblast invasion in the fly (Ninov et al., 2010).

 2002; Li et al., 2003). Notch and BMP promote invasion and metastasis in mice (Bach et al., 2018;
Garcia and Kandel, 2012; Owens et al., 2015; Pickup et al., 2015; Sahlgren et al., 2008;
Sonoshita et al., 2011). We conclude that Mrva is required to increase T O-glycans on a subset of
the glycosites of selected glycoproteins involved in protein folding, glycosylation and signaling in
pathways frequently linked to promoting cancer metastasis. Its strongest effect is on a predicted
sulfhydryl oxidase, the Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian cancer protein, QSOX1.
We wished to determine how Qsox1 might affect Drosophila macrophage germband invasion.
Embryos from the KG04615 P element insertion in the 5’UTR of the qsox1 gene displayed 42% fewer
macrophages in the germband compared to the control (Figure 5A,B) with an increase in macro-
phages remaining on the yolk (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). We observed a small decrease in
migration along the vnc (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B) and no change in total macrophage
numbers in these embryos (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). These migration phenotypes were
also observed in embryos in which RNAi line v108288 knocked down qsox1 only in macrophages
(Figure
5C,
Figure
5—figure
supplement
1D–E).
We
then
conducted
live
imaging
(Figure 5D, Figure 5—video 1) (compare to control shown in Figure 3—video 1) to examine how
the qsox1KG04615 mutant affected the dynamics of macrophage migration. During the movement of
macrophages labeled with the nuclear marker srpHemo-H2A::3xmCherry from their initial position
up to the germband we detected an 18% decrease in speed (Figure 5E) (2.46 ± 0.07 mm/min in the
control, 2.02 ± 0.03 mm/min in the qsox1KG046152 mutant, p=0.006, n = 3) and no significant decrease
in persistence (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F) (0.43 ± 0.02 in the control, 0.39 ± 0.01 in the
mutant, p=0.13). Macrophages in the qsox1 mutant were delayed twice as long at the germband
edge before entering (Figure 5F) (time to entry 22.00 ± 1.53 min in the control and 49.67 ± 9.33 min
in the qsox1KG046152 mutant, n = 3). Once in, they moved within the germband with a 17% slower
speed, a reduction that was not statistically significant (Figure 5G) (2.72 ± 0.32 mm/min in the con-
trol, 2.27 ± 0.20 mm/min in the qsox1KG046152 mutant, p=0.30, n = 3). We conclude that Qsox1 aids
the disseminatory migration of macrophages but is most strongly required for their initial invasion
into the germband tissues.
We wished to examine how Qsox1 could be exerting this effect on macrophage tissue entry. Ver-
tebrate QSOX1 has been shown to localize to the Golgi and act as a sulfhydryl oxidase, catalyzing
disulfide bond formation and protein folding (Alon et al., 2012; Chakravarthi et al., 2007;
Heckler et al., 2008; Hoober et al., 1996). The Drosophila protein has been shown to be required
for the secretion of multimerized EGF domains and was hypothesized to act redundantly with ER oxi-
doreductin-like-1 to form disulfide bonds (Tien et al., 2008). We found that an HA-tagged form of
Qsox1 transfected into the Drosophila macrophage like cell line, S2R+, colocalizes little with markers
for the ER, and considerably with those for Golgi and endosomes (Figure 5H, Figure 5—figure sup-
plement
1G–I).
We
also
observed
significant
colocalization
with
3xmCherry-tagged
Mrva
(Figure 5H, Figure 5—figure supplement 1J). Vertebrate QSOX1 can be cleaved from its trans-
membrane domain to allow secretion (Rudolf et al., 2013), and has been shown in vitro to be
required extracellularly for the incorporation of laminin produced by fibroblasts into the extracellular
matrix (ECM), thereby supporting efficient cancer cell migration (Ilani et al., 2013). Drosophila
Qsox1 also has a transmembrane domain, yet we detected an HA-tagged form in the media after
transfection into S2R+ cells (Figure 5I), indicating that it can be secreted. To examine if Drosophila
Qsox1 might also affect Laminin, we stained mrva3102 and qsox1KG046152 mutant embryos with an
antibody against Laminin A (LanA) (Figure 5—figure supplement 1K). In both mutants we observed
increased amounts of LanA inside and somewhat higher levels adjacent to the macrophages, but no
significant alteration at the cell edges compared to the control (Figure 5J, Figure 5—figure supple-
ment 1L–N). We conclude that Drosophila Qsox1 can be secreted but is also found in the Golgi and
endosomes like Mrva, and that both proteins affect LanA, a component of the ECM.
Conservation of Minerva’s function in macrophage invasion and T
antigen modification by its mammalian ortholog MFSD1
To determine if our studies could ultimately be relevant for mammalian biology and therefore also
cancer research, we searched for a mammalian ortholog. MFSD1 from mus musculus shows strong
sequence similarity with Mrva, with 50% of amino acids displaying identity and 68% conservation
(Figure 6A, Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). A transfected C-terminally GFP-tagged form (Fig-
ure 6—figure supplement 1B) showed localization to the secretory pathway, colocalizing with the

 Golgi marker GRASP65 in murine MC-38 colon carcinoma, 4T1 breast cancer cells and LLC1.1 lung
cancer (Figure 6B–C, Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–E) and with Golgi and endosomal markers
in B16-BL6 melanoma cells (Figure 6C, Figure 6—figure supplement 1F). mmMFSD1 expression in
macrophages in mrva3102 mutant embryos can completely rescue the germband invasion defect
(Figure 6D–E). This macrophage-specific expression of MFSD1 also resulted in higher levels of T
antigen on macrophages when compared to those in mrva3102 mutants (Figure 6F–G). Thus MFSD1
not only displays localization in the Golgi apparatus in multiple types of mammalian cancer but can
also rescue O-glycosylation and migration defects when expressed in Drosophila, arguing that the
functions Mrva carries out to promote invasion into the germband are conserved up to mammals.
Discussion
O-glycosylation is one of the most common posttranslational modifications, yet the intrinsic technical
challenges involved in identifying O-glycosites and altered O-glycosylation on a proteome-wide level
has hampered the discovery of biological functions (Levery et al., 2015). Here we provide two
important new advances for the field. First, we identify a key regulator of this O-glycosylation,
Minerva, with an unexpected role for a member of the major facilitator superfamily. Our demonstra-
tion that this conserved protein affects invasion and the appearance of the cancer-associated core1
T glycoform on a set of proteins connected to invasion provides a new perspective on T glycoform
regulation and may have implications for cancer. Second, we define the GalNAc-type O-glycopro-
teome of Drosophila embryos. As O-glycosites cannot as yet be reliably predicted, our proteomic
characterization in a highly genetically accessible organism will permit future studies on how glyco-
sylation affects cell behavior; we highlight T and Tn O-glycosylated receptors in Supplementary file
3 to further this goal.
Modifications of the O-glycoproteome by an MFS family member
Our identification of a MFS family member as a regulator of O-glycosylation is surprising. MFS family
members can serve as transporters and shuttle a wide variety of substrates (Quistgaard et al.,
2016; Reddy et al., 2012). Minerva displays homology to sugar transporters and is localized to the
Golgi and endosomes. Minerva could thus affect O-glycosylation in the Golgi through substrate
availability. However, the lower and higher levels of glycosylation in the mrva3102 mutant we observe
are hard to reconcile with this hypothesis. Given that the changes in T antigen on individual

 glycosites in the mrva mutant are found either with no significant change in Tn or with a change in
the same direction (Supplementary file 1 and 2), regulation appears to occur at the initial GalNAc
addition on the protein subset as well as on further T antigen elaboration. 95% of the proteins with
10-fold altered glycosylation in the mrva mutant had multiple O-glycosylation sugar modifications
compared to 56% of the general O-glycoproteome. Greatly enhanced glycosylation of protein
sequences containing an existing glycan modification is observed for some GalNAc-Ts due to a lec-
tin domain (Hassan et al., 2000; Kubota et al., 2006; Revoredo et al., 2016) and Minerva could
theoretically affect such a GalNAc-T in Drosophila. Alternatively, Minerva, while in the ‘outward
open’ conformation identified for MFS structures (Quistgaard et al., 2016), may itself have a lectin-
like interaction with Tn and T glycoforms that have already been added on a loop of particular pro-
teins. Minerva’s binding could open up the target protein’s conformation to increase or block access
to other potential glycosites and thus affect the final glycosylation state on select glycoproteins.
The changes we see in O-glycosylation are also likely due to a combination of Minerva’s direct
and indirect effects. O-GalNAc modification of vertebrate Notch can affect Notch signaling during
development (Boskovski et al., 2013); the Drosophila ortholog of the responsible GalNAc transfer-
ase is also essential for embryogenesis (Bennett et al., 2010; Schwientek et al., 2002). A GalNAcT
in Xenopus can glycosylate a peptide corresponding to the ActR IIB receptor and inhibit Activin and
BMP type signaling (Herr et al., 2008; Voglmeir et al., 2015). Thus the changed glycosylation we
observe
on
components
of
the
Notch
and
Dpp
pathways
could
alter
transcription
(Hamaratoglu et al., 2014; Ntziachristos et al., 2014), shifting protein levels and thereby changing
the ratio of some glycopeptides in the mrva mutant relative to the wild type. Proteins in which glyco-
sylation at other sites is unchanged or changed in the opposite direction are those most likely to be
directly affected by Minerva. Such proteins include ones involved in protein folding and O-glycan
addition and removal (Figure 4H) (Tien et al., 2008). If changes in the glycosylation of these pro-
teins alters their specificity or activity, some of the shifts we observe in our glycoproteomic analysis
could be indirect in a different way; an initial effect of Minerva on the glycosylation of regulators of
protein folding and glycosylation could change how these primary Minerva targets affect the glyco-
sylation of a second wave of proteins.

leads to increases in T antigen levels on a subset of proteins that aid invasion, including Qsox1 which regulates protein folding through disulfide bond
formation and isomerization. We propose that increased T antigen on Qsox1 facilitates its sulfhydryl oxidase activity that aids the formation of a robust
crosslinked ECM which macrophages utilize during tissue entry. Significance was assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test with Conover post test analysis in E,F).

 An invasion program regulated by Minerva
The truncated immature core1 T and Tn O-glycans are not usually present in normal human tissues
but exposure of these uncapped glycans has been found on the majority of cancers and serves as a
negative indicator of patient outcome (Fu et al., 2016; Springer, 1984). Increases in Tn antigen due
to a shift in GalNAcT localization to the ER promote invasion and metastasis (Gill et al., 2013). An
antibody against T antigen has decreased the metastatic spread of cancer cells in mice
(Heimburg et al., 2006). Here we further strengthen the case for a causative relationship between T
antigen modification and the invasive migration that underlies metastasis. The transient appearance
of T antigen in human fetuses (Barr et al., 1989) and the conserved function of Minerva lead us to
propose that the change in O-glycosylation in cancer represents the reactivation of an ancient devel-
opmental program for invasion. Our embryonic glycoproteome analysis identifies 106 T antigen
modified proteins, a very large set to investigate. However, the absence of Mrva causes invasion
defects and deficits in T antigen modification on only 10–20 proteins; these include components
involved in protein folding, glycosylation modification, and the signaling pathways triggered by
Notch and the BMP family member, Dpp.
Our working model is that the defect in germband tissue invasion seen in the mrva mutant is
caused by the absence of T antigen on this group of proteins that act coordinately (Figure 6H). 56%
of these have vertebrate orthologs, and 55% of those have already been linked to cancer and metas-
tasis. The vertebrate ortholog of Qsox1, the protein with the largest changes in T antigen in the
mrva mutant, can enhance cancer cell invasion in in vitro assays and higher levels of the protein have
been associated with poor patient outcomes (Katchman et al., 2013; Katchman et al., 2011). We
find that the strongest effect of Drosophila Qsox1 on macrophage migration is to reduce the time
by two fold that macrophages take sitting at the germband edge before they successfully begin to
invade into the germband tissues. We also observe in qsox1 and mrva mutants that LanA levels are
higher within the macrophages and somewhat elevated near but not at the macrophage cell edges.
This could be due to some combination of the following shifts in cellular processes: an increase in
LanA production, a decrease in its degradation, a slowing of its secretion or a speeding of its diffu-
sion. We base our model on the functions that have been previously defined for the Qsox1 sulfhydryl
oxidase family, in integrating laminin into the ECM (Ilani et al., 2013) and aiding secretion of EGF
domains (Tien et al., 2008) which are found in Drosophila Laminins. If Qsox1 is needed for the effi-
cient secretion and integration of LanA into the ECM, its absence could result in a less robustly
cross-linked matrix. ECM crosslinking has been shown to enhance Integrin signaling, focal adhesion
formation, and invasion of mammalian tumor cells (Levental et al., 2009). In its absence Drosophila
macrophages which utilize Integrin during invasion (Siekhaus et al., 2010) and whose invasive migra-
tion is accompanied by deformation of the flanking tissue (Ratheesh et al., 2018), could be unable
to generate sufficient traction forces to enter. Indeed, mutating another subunit of the Drosophila
Laminin trimer, LanB1, reduces both normal LanA deposition and germband invasion by macro-
phages (Matsubayashi et al., 2017; Sa
´nchez-Sa
´nchez et al., 2017). A determination of the effect of
Minerva’s regulation awaits a characterization of Qsox1 mutated such that it is incapable of being
modified by T antigen on the Mrva-dependent sites. Nonetheless, the similarity of the changes in
LanA we observe in the mrva3102 and qsox1KG046152 mutant supports the conclusion that Mrva
dependent T-antigen modification of Qsox1 is necessary for its activity on some substrates. Given
that mrva3102 mutants take even longer than qsox1KG04615 to enter germband tissue and display
much stronger defects thereafter, we propose that T antigen modifications on other proteins are
also crucial for tissue entry, and underlie the defect in invasive migration within the germband.
Minerva’s vertebrate ortholog, MFSD1, can rescue macrophage migration defects and restores
higher T antigen levels. Tagged versions of Minerva’s vertebrate ortholog, MFSD1, detected the
protein in lysosomes in HeLa and rat liver cells (Chapel et al., 2013; Palmieri et al., 2011). In four
metastasizing mouse tumor cell lines we find MFSD1 mainly in the Golgi, where O-glycosylation is
known to occur (Bennett et al., 2012). We do not yet know if invasion and metastasis is altered by
the absence of MFSD1 but will be testing this in future work. Akin to how kinases add phospho-
groups to affect a set of proteins and orchestrate a particular cellular response, we propose that
Minerva in Drosophila macrophages and its vertebrate ortholog MFSD1 in cancer trigger changes in
O-glycosylation that coordinately modulate, activate and inhibit a protein group to affect cellular dis-
semination and tissue invasion.

Fly work
Flies were raised on food bought from IMBA (Vienna, Austria) which contained the standard recipe
of agar, cornmeal, and molasses with the addition of 1.5% Nipagin. Adults were placed in cages in a
Percival DR36VL incubator maintained at 29˚C and 65% humidity; embryos were collected on stan-
dard plates prepared in house from apple juice, sugar, agar and Nipagin supplemented with yeast
from Lesaffre (Marcq, France) on the plate surface. Embryo collections for fixation (7 hr collection) as
well as live imaging (4.5 hr collection) were conducted at 29˚C.

Embryo fixation and immunohistochemistry
Embryos were collected on apple juice plates from between 6 and 8.5 hr at 29˚C. Embryos were
incubated in 50% Chlorox (DanClorix) for 5 min and washed. Embryos were fixed with 17% formalde-
hyde/heptane for 20 min followed by methanol or ethanol devitellinization except for T antigen anal-
ysis, when embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/heptane. Fixed embryos were blocked in
BBT (0.1M PBS + 0,1% TritonX-100 +0,1% BSA) for 2 hr at RT. Antibodies were used at the following
dilutions: a-T antigen (Steentoft et al., 2011) 1:5, a-GFP (Aves Labs Inc., Tigard, Oregon) 1:500; a-

 LanA (Kumagai et al., 1997) (a gift from Stefan Baumgartner) 1:500; a-Vasa (Aruna et al., 2009)
(DSHB, deposited by A. Sprading/D. Williams) 1:25; and incubated overnight at 4˚C (GFP) or room
temperature (T antigen, LanA). Afterwards, embryos were washed in BBT for 2 hr, incubated with
secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) at RT for 2 hr, and
washed again for 2 hr. Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA) was then added. After
overnight incubation in Vectashield at 4˚C, embryos were mounted on a slide and imaged with a
Zeiss Inverted LSM700 Confocal Microscope using a Plan-Apochromat 20X/0.8 Air Objective or a
Plan-Apochromat 63X/1.4 Oil Objective.
Ovary dissection and immunostaining
3–5 day old females were fed with yeast for 2 days at 25˚C. For ovary dissection, females were anes-
thetized using the FlyNap anesthetic kit (Carolina, Burlington, NC, USA) and further transferred to
ice cold PBS in which ovaries were extracted with pre-cleaned forceps. Individual ovaries were fixed
in 4% Paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature (RT) for 20 min with agitation. Three wash steps
with PBS at RT for 10 min were performed and individual ovaries were incubated in PBS supple-
mented with 0.1% of Triton X-100 (PBT) for 10 min at RT to allow permeabilization of the tissue.
Ovaries were incubated in phalloidin-A488 (Thermo Fisher) diluted in PBT (1:300) overnight at 4˚C.
After being washed with PBT and PBS, ovaries were mounted in Vectashield + DAPI (LifeTechnolo-
gies, Carlsbad, USA).
Fixed ovary image analysis for border cell migration
Ovaries were imaged as a Z-series (1 mm apart) with a Plan-Apochromat 20X/0.8 Air Objective on a
Zeiss LSM700 inverted microscope. Images were acquired from stage 10 oocytes and maximum-
intensity projections were created using ImageJ (NHI, USA). Border cells were identified by the clus-
tered nuclei and their enriched actin staining. Border cell migration was quantified in the DAPI
images as the percentage observed relative to the expected migration to the edge of the oocyte for
these cells in stage 10 oocytes. Measurements were performed using ImageJ software (NIH, USA).
Lectin staining
Embryos were fixed with 10% formaldehyde/heptane and devitellinized with Ethanol. Blocking was
conducted in BBT for 2 hr at room temperature. A FITC-labeled lectin kit #2 (EY laboratories, San
Mateo, CA, USA) was utilized (table below summarizes abbreviations of used lectins). Each lectin
was diluted to 1:25 and incubated with fixed embryos overnight at room temperature (RT). Embryos
were washed in BBT for 2 hr at RT and Vectashield was added. After overnight incubation at 4˚C,
embryos were mounted on a slide and imaged with a Zeiss Inverted LSM700 Confocal Microscope
using a Plan-Apochromat 63X/1.4 Oil Objective. Macrophages in late Stage 11 embryos were
imaged at germband entry and evaluated by eye for enriched staining on macrophages compared
to other tissues.

Embryos were bleached in 50% Chlorox in water for 5 min at RT. Stage late 11/early 12 embryos
were lined up and then glued to 50 mm Dish No. 0 Coverslip, 14 mm Glass Diameter, Uncoated dish
(Zeiss, Germany). Cells from the germband margin were extracted using a ES Blastocyte Injection
Pipet (spiked, 20 mm inner diameter, 55 mm length; BioMedical Instruments, Germany). Extracted
cells were placed in Schneider’s medium (Gibco, Dublin, Ireland) supplemented with 20% FBS
(Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA).

 Immunohistochemistry of extracted macrophages
Extracted macrophages were collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature.
The cell pellet was resuspended in a small volume of Phospho-buffered saline (PBS) and smeared on
a cover slip. The cell suspension was left to dry before cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in
0.1M Phosphate Buffer for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed 3 times in 0.1M PBS and
permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X 100 in PBS. Cells were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in 20%
Fetal Bovine Serum +0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer:
anti-HA (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) 1:50, anti-Golgin 84, 1:25, anti-Calnexin 99a 1:25, anti-Hrs.8.2
1:25 or anti-Rab7 1:25 all from DSHB (Riedel et al., 2016), and incubated for 1 hr at room tempera-
ture. Cells were then washed 5 times in blocking buffer. Secondary antibodies were diluted in block-
ing buffer: anti-rat 633 1:300, anti-mouse 488 1:300 (both from ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham,
Massachusetts, USA). Secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells
were washed 5 times in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 and mounted in VectaShield + DAPI (LifeTechnolo-
gies, Carlsbad, USA) utilized at 1:75.
S2 cell work
S2R+ cells (a gift from Frederico Mauri of the Knoblich laboratory at IMBA, Vienna) were grown in
Schneider’s medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and transfected with PTS1-GFP (a
gift from Dr. McNew) and/or the srpHemo-CG8602::3xmCherry construct using Effectene Tranfec-
tion Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Transfected S2R
+ cells were grown on Poly-L-Lysine coated coverslips (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachu-
setts, USA) in complete Schneider’s medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich,
Saint Louis, Missouri, USA) and 1% Pen/Strep (Gibco) to a confluency of 60%. To visualize lysosomes,
cells were incubated with Lysotracker 75 nM Green DND-26 (Invitrogen) in complete Schneider’s
medium for 30 min at 25˚C. Cells were washed in complete Schneider’s medium 3 times before
imaging on an inverted LSM-700 (Zeiss). To visualize mitochondria, mitotracker Green FM (Invitro-
gen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was diluted in prewarmed Schneider’s medium supplemented with 1%
Pen/Strep to a concentration of 250 nM. Cells were incubated in the Mitotracker solution for 45 min
at 25˚C. Cells were then washed 3 times in complete Schneider’s medium before imaging.
To visualize Golgi, ER, early and late endosomes as well as the nucleus, S2R+ cells were trans-
fected
with
MT-CG8602::FLAG::HA
(DGRC:
FMO06045)
or
MT-Qsox1::FLAG::HA
(DGRC:
FMO06379) with Effectene Tranfection Reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. 24
hr after transfection gene expression was induced by addition of 1 mM Cu2SO4 (Sigma) and cells
were incubated for an additional 24 hr. Cells were then fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma) in 0.1M PB for 20
min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 15 min and blocked
for 2 hr in 20% FBS (Sigma), 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature.
Cells were then stained with anti-HA antibody 1:50 (Roche) and either anti-Cnx99a (1:5), anti-Hrs
8.2 (1:5), anti-Golgin 84 (1:5), anti-Rab7 (1:5), anti- GMAP (1:50) or anti- Golgin 245 (1:50) (all anti-
bodies from DSHB) (Riedel et al., 2016). Cells were washed in 20% FBS (Sigma), 0.25% Triton X-100
in PBS 5 times and then incubated with anti-rat Alexa Fluor 633 1:50 and either anti-mouse Alexa
Fluor 488 or anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 1:100 (Thermo Fisher) for 2 hr at room temperature. Cells
were washed again 5 times and then mounted in Vectashield Mounting Medium +DAPI (Vector Lab-
oratories) and imaged with Zeiss LSM 700 or 800 confocal microscopes. Quantitation of colocaliza-
tion was performed as indicated below.
The cell line was routinely tested for Mycoplasm infection and found to be negative.
DNA isolation from single flies
Single male flies were frozen for at least 3 hr before grinding them in 100 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM
EDTA, 100 mM NaCL and 0.5% SDS. Lysates were incubated at 65˚C for 30 min. Then 5M KAc and
6M LiCl were added at a ratio of 1:2.5 and lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min. Lysates were
centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000xg, supernatant was isolated and mixed with Isopropanol. Lysates
were centrifuged again for 15 min at 20.000xg, supernatant was discarded and the DNA pellet was
washed in 70% EtOH and subsequently dissolved in ddH20.

 FACS sorting
Embryos were collected for 1 hr and aged for an additional 5 hr, all at 29˚C. Embryos collected from
w- flies were processed in parallel and served as a negative control. Embryos were dissociated as
described previously (Gyoergy et al., 2018). The cells were sorted using a FACS Aria III (BD) flow
cytometer. Emission filters were 600LP, 610/20 and 502 LP, 510/50. Data were analyzed with FlowJo
software (Tree Star). The cells from the dissociated negative control w- embryos were sorted to set a
baseline plot.
qPCR
RNA was isolated from approximately 50,000 mCherry positive or mCherry negative FACS sorted
macrophages using RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer’s pro-
tocol. RNA was also isolated from 50 to 100 mg of ovaries (about 15–20 pairs of ovaries extracted as
indicated above). Ovaries were homogenized with a pellet homogenizer (VWR, Radnor, USA) and
plastic pestles (VWR, Radnor, USA) in 1 ml of Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)
and centrifuged at 12,000xg for 5 min at 4˚C. Further steps were according to the manufacturers
protocol. The resulting RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using Sensiscript RT Kit (macrophages) or
Omniscript (ovaries) (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and oligo dT primers. A Takyon qPCR Kit (Eurogen-
tec, Liege, Belgium) was used to mix qPCR reactions based on the provided protocol. qPCR was run
on a LightCycler 480 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and data were analyzed in the LightCycler 480 Soft-
ware and Prism (GraphPad Software). Data are represented as relative expression to a housekeeping
gene (2-Dct) or fold change in expression (2-DDct). Primer sequences utilized for flies were obtained
from the FlyPrimerBank (http://www.flyrnai.org/FlyPrimerBank). Minerva/CG8602: Fw pr TGTGC

Protein preps from embryos for western blots
Embryos were collected for 7 hr at 29˚C, bleached and hand-picked for the correct stage. 50–200
embryos were smashed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0,5% Sodiumdeoxychalat, 0,1% SDS, 50 mM
Tris, pH 8) with Protease inhibitor (Complete Mini, EDTA free, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using a pel-
let homogenizer (VWR, Radnor, USA) and plastic pestles (VWR, Radnor, USA) and incubated on ice
for 30 min. Afterwards, samples were centrifuged at 4˚C, 16,000 g for 30 min and the supernatant
was collected and used for experiments. The protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce
BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Western blots
30 mg of protein samples were loaded on a 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gel (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, USA) and run at 100V for 80 min in 1x running buffer (25 mM Tris Base, 190 mM gly-
cine and 0.1%SDS) followed by transfer onto Amersham Protran Premium 0.45 mm NC (GE Health-
care Lifescience, Little Chalfont, UK) or Amersham Hybond Low Fluorescence 0.2 mm PVDF (GE
Healthcare Lifescience, Little Chalfont, UK) membrane using a wet transfer protocol with 25 mM Tris
Base, 190 mM Glycine +20% MeOH at either 100 Volts for 60 min or 200mA for 90 min at Mini
Trans-Blot Cell Module (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). Membranes were blocked in PBS-T (0.1% Triton
X-100 in PBS) containing 2% BSA or Pierce Clear Milk Blocking Buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 1
hr at RT. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4˚C at the following concentrations: a-T
antigen (Copenhagen) 1:10, a-profilin (Verheyen and Cooley, 1994), DSHB) 1:50, anti-GFP (clone
2B6, Ogris lab, MFPL), anti-GAPDH (ab181603, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Afterwards, blots were
washed 3x for 5 min in blocking solution and incubated with Goat anti Mouse IgG (H/L):HRP (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, USA) or goat-anti-rabbit IgG (H + L)-HRP (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) at 1:5 000–10,000
for 1–2 hr at room temperature. Blots were washed 2 � 5 min in blocking solution and 1 � 5 min
with PBS-T. Blots were developed using SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Chemiluminescent signal was detected using the Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare Lifescience)
or VersaDoc (Bio-Rad). Images were processed with ImageJ.

 Western blot analysis of S2R+ supernatant
S2R+ cells were transfected as described previously with srpGal4 UAS-Qsox1::FLAG::HA. 2 days
post-transfection, medium was removed and cells were washed with PBS. Afterwards, serum-free S2
medium was added and incubated for approximately 40 hr. Afterwards, supernatant was collected
and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 10K Centrifugal Filter Device (Merck, Kenilworth, New Jer-
sey, United States) to gain 80 ml of concentrated supernatant. 20 ml of supernatant was loaded on
gel and analyzed by anti-HA (1:200, Roche). Images were processed with ImageJ.
Time-lapse imaging, tracking, speed, persistence and germband entry
analysis
Embryos were dechorionated in 50% bleach for 5 min, washed with water, and mounted in halocar-
bon oil 27 (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA) between a coverslip and an oxygen permeable
membrane (YSI). The anterior dorsolateral region of the embryo was imaged on an inverted multi-
photon microscope (TrimScope II, LaVision) equipped with a W Plan-Apochromat 40X/1.4 oil immer-
sion objective (Olympus). mCherry was imaged at 1100 nm excitation wavelengths, using a Ti-
Sapphire femtosecond laser system (Coherent Chameleon Ultra) combined with optical parametric
oscillator technology (Coherent Chameleon Compact OPO). Excitation intensity profiles were
adjusted to tissue penetration depth and Z-sectioning for imaging was set at 1 mm for tracking and
segmentation respectively. For long-term imaging, movies were acquired for 132–277 min with a
frame rate of 40 s. All embryos were imaged with a temperature control unit set to 28.5˚C.
Images acquired from multiphoton microscopy were initially processed with InSpector software
(LaVision Bio Tec) to compile channels from the imaging data, and the exported files were further
processed using Imaris software (Bitplane) to visualize the recorded channels in 3D. Macrophage
speed and persistence were calculated by using embryos in which the macrophage nuclei were
labeled with srpHemo-H2A::3XmCherry (Gyoergy et al., 2018). The movie from each imaged
embryo was rotated and aligned along the AP axis for tracking analysis. Increasing the gain allowed
determination of germband position from the autofluorescence of the yolk. Movies for vnc analysis
were analyzed for 2 hr from the time point that cells started to dive into the channels to reach the
outer vnc. Macrophage nuclei were extracted using the spot detection function and nuclei positions
in xyz-dimensions were determined for each time point and used for further quantitative analysis.
Cell speeds and directionalities were calculated in Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachu-
setts, USA) from single cell positions in 3D for each time frame measured in Imaris (Bitplane). Instan-
taneous velocities from single cell trajectories were averaged to obtain a mean instantaneous
velocity value over the course of measurement. To calculate directionality values, single cell trajecto-
ries were split into segments of equal length (10 frames) and calculated via a sliding window as the
ratio of the distance between the macrophage start-to-end location over the entire summed dis-
tance covered by the macrophage between successive frames in a segment. Calculated directionality
values were averaged over all segments in a single trajectory and all trajectories were averaged to
obtain a mean directionality value for the duration of measurement, with 0 being the lowest and one
the maximum directionality. To estimate the time for entry into the germband, we increased the
gain to visualize the germband position from the autofluorescence of the yolk. We assessed the time
point when the first macrophage nucleus reached the edge of the germband (taken as T0) and the
time point when the first cell nucleus was just within the germband (taken as T1). T1-T0 was defined
as the time for macrophage entry.
Fixed embryo image analysis for T antigen levels
Embryos were imaged with Plan-Apochromat 63X/1.4 Oil Objective on a Zeiss LSM700 inverted. 10
mm stacks (0.5 mm intervals) were taken for properly staged and oriented embryos, starting 10 mm
deep in the tissue. These images were converted into Z-stacks in Fiji. ROIs were drawn around mac-
rophages (signal), copied to tissue close by without macrophages (background) and the average
intensity in the green channel of each ROI was measured. For each pair of ROIs background was sub-
tracted from signal individually. The average signal from control ROIs from one imaging day and
staining was calculated and all data points from control, mutant and rescue from the same set was
divided by this value. This way we introduced an artificial value called Arbitrary Unit (AU) that makes
it possible to compare all the data with each other, even if they come from different imaging days

 when the imaging laser may have a different strength or from different sets of staining. Analysis was
done on anonymized samples.
Macrophage cell counting
Transmitted light images of the embryos were used to measure the position of the germband to
determine the stages for analysis. The extent of germband retraction away from the anterior along
with the presence of segmentation was used to classify embryos. Embryos with germband retraction
of between 29–31% were assigned to late Stage 11. Those with 29–41% retraction (early Stage 12)
were analyzed for the number of macrophages that had entered the germband and those with 50–
75% retraction (late Stage 12) for the number along the ventral nerve cord (vnc), and in the whole
embryo. Macrophages were visualized using confocal microscopy with a Z-resolution of 3 mm and
the number of macrophages within the germband or the segments of vnc was calculated in individ-
ual slices (and then aggregated) using the Cell Counter plugin in FIJI.
To check that this staging allows embryos from the control and mrva3102 mutant to be from the
same time during development, embryos were collected for 30 min and then imaged for a further
10 hr using a Nikon-Eclipse Wide field microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 20X/0.5 DIC water
Immersion Objective. Bright field images were taken every 5 min, and the timing of the start of the
movies was aligned based on when cellularization occurred. We found no significant difference in
when germband retraction begins (269.6 ± 9 min in control and 267.1 ± 3 min in mrva3102, p=0.75)
or in when the germband retracts to 41% (300 ± 9 min for control, 311 ± 5 min in mrva3102, p=0.23),
or in when the germband retraction is complete (386.5 ± 10 min for control, 401.6 ± 8 min for
mrva3102, p=0.75). n = 10 embryos for control and 25 embryos for mrva3102.
Cloning
Standard molecular biology methods were used and all constructs were sequenced by Eurofins
before injection into flies. Restriction enzymes BSiWI, and AscI were obtained from New England
Biolabs, Ipswich, Massasuchetts, USA (Frankfurt, Germany). PCR amplifications were performed with
GoTaq G2 DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, USA) using a peqSTAR 2X PCR machine from PEQ-
LAB, (Erlangen, Germany). All Infusion cloning was conducted using an Infusion HD Cloning kit
obtained from Clontech’s European distributor (see above); relevant oligos were chosen using the
Infusion primer Tool at the Clontech website.
Construction of srpHemo-minerva
A 1467 bp fragment containing the Minerva (CG8602) ORF was amplified from the UAS-CG8602:
FLAG:HA construct (DGRC) using primers Fw GAAGCTTCTGCAAGGATGGCGCGCGAGGACGAG-
GAAC, Rv CGGTGCCTAGGCGCGCTATTCAAAGTTCTGATAATTCTCG. The fragment was cloned
into the srpHemo plasmid (a gift from Katja Bru
¨ ckner, (Bruckner et al., 2004)) after its linearization
with AscI, using an Infusion HD cloning kit.
Construction of srpHemo-MFSD1
A 1765 bp fragment containing the MFSD1 ORF was amplified from cDNA prepared from dendritic
cells (a gift from M. Sixt’s lab) with Fw primer TAGAAGCTTCTGCAACTTTGCTTCCTGCTCCGTTC,
Rv primer ATGTGCCTAGGCGCGAAGGAAAGGCTTCATCCGCA). The fragment was cloned into
the srpHemo plasmid (a gift from Katja Bru
¨ ckner, (Bruckner et al., 2004) using an Infusion HD clon-
ing kit (Clontech) after its linearization with AscI (NEB).
Construction of srpHemo-mrva::3xmCherry
Minerva (CG8602) was amplified from a DNA prep from Oregon R flies (Fw primer: AGAGAAGC
TTCGTACGCGACAACCCTGCTCTACAGAG;
Rv
primer
CGACCTGCAGCGTACGACCCGATCC
TTCAAAGTTCTG). The vector, PCasper4 containing a 3xmCherry construct under the control of the
srpHemo promoter (Gyoergy et al., 2018), was digested with BsiWI according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The vector and insert were homologously recombined using the In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit.

 Generation of pInducer20-MFSD1-eGFP constructs
For C-terminal tagging MFSD1 was PCR amplified from cDNA prepared from dendritic cells (a gift
from M. Sixt lab) (Fw primer:GATCTCGAGATGGAGGACGAGGATG; Rv primer: CGACCGGTAAC
TCTGGATGAGAGAGC) and digested with XhoI and AgeI (both New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Mas-
sasuchetts, USA). This MFSD1 fragment was cloned into XhoI/AgeI digested peGFP-N1 (Addgene,
Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA). C-terminally eGFP tagged MFSD1 was further PCR amplified (Fw
primer:
GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTAATGGAGGACGAGGAT;
Rv
primer:
GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTATTACTTGTACAGCTC). This fragment was cloned
using Gateway BP Clonase II Enzyme mix and Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme Mix (ThermoFisher Sci-
entific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) via donor vector pDonR211 into the final Doxycyclin inducible
expression vector pInducer20 (Meerbrey et al., 2011) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
pInducer20-MFSD1-eGFP was amplified in stbl3 bacteria (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massa-
chusetts, USA).
Precise excision
mrva3102 flies which contain the 3102 P element insert in the 5’ region of CG8602 were crossed to a
line expressing transposase (BL-1429: pn1; ry503Dr1P[D 2–3]). To allow excision of the P Element,
males from the F1 generation containing both the P element and the transposase, were crossed to
virgins with the genotype Sp/Cyo; PrDr/TM3Ser (gift from Lehmann lab). In the F2 generation white
eyed males were picked and singly crossed to Sp/Cyo; PrDr/TM3Ser virgins.
LanA quantification
Images were taken with a Z-resolution of 0.5 mm from the head of late stage 12 embryos using a
Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope and a 40x/1.4 Oil DIC objective. A 4 mm long line was drawn
over a macrophage with the middle of the line located approximately at the edge of the cell.
mCherry and LanA (488) intensities were measured using the Multichannel Plot Profile Plugin in Fiji.
Three lines were drawn on each cell to catch the variability of secretion. Only cells standing alone or
in small groups that had at least some small visible amount of extracellular LanA were analyzed.
From each embryo, 20 cells were analyzed. Images were anonymized before quantification.
Mammalian cell culture
MC-38 colon carcinoma cells, 4T1 breast carcinoma (ATCC, CRL-2539), Lewis Lung carcinoma LLC1
(ATCC, CRL-1642) and B16-BL6 melanoma (NCI-DTP; B16BL-6) (all gifts from the Borsig lab) were
kept in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA), Non-essen-
tial Amino Acids, and Na-Pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). All cells
were kept in a humidified incubator at 37˚C with 5% CO2. Cells were infected with lentiviral particles
containing pInducer20-MFSD1-eGFP. Expression of MFSD1-eGFP was induced with 20 ng/ml (for
MC-38) and 100 ng/ml (for 4T1, LLC, B16-BL6) of Doxycycline for 24 hr prior subsequent analysis.
Cell lines were routinely tested for Mycoplasm infection and found to be negative. The identity of
the cell lines was confirmed by STR analysis by the cell bank from which they were obtained.
Mammalian cell lysis
Cells were lysed in alysis buffer (25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) supple-
mented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for 20 min on ice,
followed by centrifugation at 14,000x g, 4˚C for 5 min. The protein lysates were stored at �80˚C.
Protein concentration was determined with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).
Mammalian cell immunofluorescence
Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 15 min at room-tempera-
ture. Cells were washed three times with PBS followed by blocking and permeabilization with 1%
BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA)/0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hr. Antibodies were
diluted in blocking/permeabilization buffer and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature. Primary
antibodies used were: anti-GFP (clone 5G4, Ogris lab, MFPL), anti-GRASP65 (Thermo Fisher, PA3-
910), anti-Rab5 (Cell Signaling Technology, #C8B1), anti-Rab7 (Cell Signaling Technology, #D95F2)

 and anti-LAMP1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, #ab24170). Cells were washed three times with PBS-
Tween20 (0.05%) for 5 min each, followed by secondary antibody incubation in blocking/permeabili-
zation buffer for 1 hr at room-temperature. Secondary antibodies used were: goat anti-mouse IgG
(H + L) Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher A11001), goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) Alexa Fluor 555
(Thermo Fisher, A21428), Cells were counterstained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher) for 10 min in PBS.
Cells were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher #P36930). Images were
acquired using a Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.4 Oil DIC objective M27 on a Zeiss LSM880 confocal micro-
scope. Pictures were processed with ImageJ.
Quantification of secretory pathway marker colocalization with Mrva,
MFSD1 and Qsox1
Colocalization analysis was performed by ImageJ’s (NIH) Coloc two plugin and determined with the
pixel intensity spatial correlation analysis (Pearson’s correlation coefficient).
Embryonic protein prep for glycoproteomics
150 mg fly embryos were homogenized in 2 ml 0.1% RapiGest, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate using
a dounce homogenizer. The lysed material was left on ice for 40 min with occasional vortexing fol-
lowed by probe sonication (5 s sonication, 5 s pause, 6 cycles at 60% amplitude). The lysate was
cleared by centrifugation (1,000 � g for 10 min). The cleared lysate was heated at 80˚C, 10 min fol-
lowed by reduction with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 60˚C, 30 min and alkylation with 10 mM iodoa-
cetamide at room temperature (RT) for 30 min before overnight (ON) digestion at 37˚C with 25 mg
trypsin (Roche). The tryptic digests were labeled with dimethyl stable isotopes as described
(Boersema et al., 2009). The digests were acidified with 12 mL trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 37˚C, 20
min and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 g, 10 min. The cleared acidified digests were loaded
onto equilibrated SepPak C18 cartridges (Waters) followed by 3 � CV 0.1% TFA wash. Digests were
labeled on the column by adding 5 mL 30 mM NaBH3CN and 0.2% formaldehyde (COH2) in 50 mM
sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 (Light, mrva3102), or 30 mM NaBH3CN and 0.2% deuterated formal-
dehyde (COD2) in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 (Medium, control). Columns were washed
using 3 CV 0.1% FA and eluted with 0.5 mL 50% MeOH in 0.1% FA. The eluates were mixed in a 1:1
ratio, concentrated by evaporation, and resuspended in Jacalin loading buffer (175 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.4) Glycopeptides were separated from non-glycosylated peptides by Lectin Weak Affinity Chroma-
tography (LWAC) using a 2.8 m column packed in-house with Jacalin-conjugated agarose beads.
The column was washed with 10 CVs Jacalin loading buffer (100 mL/min) before elution with Jacalin
elution buffer (175 mM Tris- HCl, pH 7.4, 0.8M galactose) 4 CVs, 1 mL fractions. The glycopeptide-
containing fractions were purified by in-house packed Stage tips (Empore disk-C18, 3M).
Quantitative O-glycoproteomic strategy
The glycopeptide quantification based on M/L isotope labeled doublet ratios was evaluated to esti-
mate a meaningful cut-off ratio for substantial changes (Schjoldager et al., 2015). The labeled gly-
copeptides produced doublets with varying ratios of the isotopic ions as well as a significant number
of single precursor ions without evidence of ion pairs. Labeled samples from control srpHemo-
3xmCherry embryos and mrva3102 srpHemo-3xmCherry mutant embryos were mixed 1:1 and sub-
jected to LWAC glycopeptide enrichment. The distribution of labeled peptides from the LWAC
flow-through showed that the quantitated peptide M/L ratios were normally distributed with 99.7%
falling within ±0.55 (Log10). We selected doublets with less/more than ±0.55(Log10) value as candi-
dates for isoform-specific O-glycosylation events.
Mass spectrometry
EASY-nLC 1000 UHPLC (Thermo Scientific) interfaced via nanoSpray Flex ion source to an -Orbitrap
Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) was used for the glycoproteomic study. A precursor
MS1 scan (m/z 350–1,700) of intact peptides was acquired in the Orbitrap at a nominal resolution
setting of 120,000. The five most abundant multiply charged precursor ions in the MS1 spectrum at
a minimum MS1 signal threshold of 50,000 were triggered for sequential Orbitrap HCD-MS2 and
ETD-MS2 (m/z of 100–2,000). MS2 spectra were acquired at a resolution of 50,000. Activation times
were 30 and 200 ms for HCD and ETD fragmentation, respectively; isolation width was four mass

 units, and one microscan was collected for each spectrum. Automatic gain control targets were
1,000,000 ions for Orbitrap MS1 and 100,000 for MS2 scans. Supplemental activation (20%) of the
charge-reduced species was used in the ETD analysis to improve fragmentation. Dynamic exclusion
for 60 s was used to prevent repeated analysis of the same components. Polysiloxane ions at m/z
445.12003 were used as a lock mass in all runs. The mass spectrometry glycoproteomics data have
been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (Vizcaı
´no et al., 2014) via the PRIDE partner
repository with the dataset identifier PXD011045.
Mass spectrometry data analysis
Data processing was performed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software (Thermo Scientific) using
Sequest HT Node as previously described (Schjoldager et al., 2015).
Briefly, all spectra were initially searched with full cleavage specificity, filtered according to the
confidence level (medium, low and unassigned) and further searched with the semi-specific enzy-
matic cleavage. In all cases the precursor mass tolerance was set to six ppm and fragment ion mass
tolerance to 20 mmu. Carbamidomethylation on cysteine residues was used as a fixed modification.
Methionine oxidation as well as HexNAc and HexHexNAc attachment to serine, threonine and tyro-
sine were used as variable modifications for MS2 data. All spectra were searched against a
concatenated forward/reverse Drosophila melanogaster-specific database (UniProt, March 2018,
containing 39034 entries with 3494 canonical reviewed entries) using a target false discovery rate
(FDR) of 1%. FDR was calculated using target decoy PSM validator node. The resulting list was fil-
tered to include only peptides with glycosylation as a modification. Glycopeptide M/L ratios were
determined using dimethyl 2plex method as previously described (Schjoldager et al., 2015)
Statistics and repeatability
Statistical tests as well as the number of embryos/cells assessed are listed in the Figure legends. All
statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism and significance was determined using a
95% confidence interval. Data points from individual experiments/embryos were pooled to estimate
mean and standard error of the mean. Sample size refers to biological replicates. No statistical
method was used to predetermine sample size and the experiments were not randomized. For major
questions, data were collected and analyzed masked. Normality was evaluated by D’Agostino and
Pearson or Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test was used to calculate
the significance in differences between two groups and One-Way Anova followed by Tukey post-
test or Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Conover or Dunn’s post-test for multiple comparisons.
All measurements were performed in 3–38 embryos and at least 37 oocytes. Representative
images shown in Figure 1E–G,I, Figure 2F,I, Figure 3A–C, Figure 5A, Figure 6B,D and G and Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 1B-J, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,H,K, Figure 5—figure supple-
ment 1G, K were from separate experiments repeated 3 to 6 times. The stainings underlying
Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-M, Figures 2Hand Figure 6-figure supplement 1C-F are from sepa-
rate experiments that were repeated at least twice. Stills shown in Figure 3I,L and Figure 5D are
representative images from two-photon movies, which were repeated at least 3 times.
