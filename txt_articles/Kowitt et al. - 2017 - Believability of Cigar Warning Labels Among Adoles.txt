Abstract
Purpose—Despite high rates of cigar use among youth, little information exists about how cigar 
warnings are received by youth. We examined believability of different cigar warning messages 
with different sources among adolescents in a national phone survey.
Methods—Adolescents (age 13-17) in the US (N = 1,125; total response rate, 66%) were 
randomized to receive one of three health messages (“cigar smoking can cause cancers of the 
mouth and throat, even if you do not inhale”, “cigar smoking can cause lung cancer and heart 
disease”, “cigars are not a safe alternative to cigarettes”) and one of four warning sources (FDA, 
Surgeon General, CDC, no source). Believability was assessed with “how believable is this 
warning” and responses were dichotomized for “not at all or somewhat” vs. “very”.
Results—Weighted logistic regression results indicated that most youth found the cigar warnings 
very believable (60.5%). Messages about mouth and throat cancer (regardless of inhalation) and 
the safety of cigars in comparison to cigarettes were rated as significantly less believable than 
messages about lung cancer and heart disease related to cigars. There were no significant 
differences by source or other demographics. However, youth susceptible to using cigarettes were 
less likely to report the cigar warnings to be very believable.
Conclusions—The messages of cigar warning labels are not viewed as equally believable 
among adolescents. Future studies should examine how youth process messages about health 
effects of cigars and the impact of different cigar warnings on youth experimentation with and use 
of cigars.

 Keywords
cigars; tobacco prevention and control; warning labels; adolescents; smoking
Cigars are one of the most widely used tobacco products among adolescents in the United 
States (1). In the 2014 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), a nationally representative 
survey of adolescents, the prevalence of current cigar use was 8.2% among high school 
students, which closely mirrored that of cigarettes (9.2%) (1). Cigar use is especially 
concerning among African Americans, among whom cigars are the most commonly used 
tobacco product (1). Moreover, dual use of cigars and cigarettes is one of the most popular 
two-product combinations among youth and young adults (2), which is worrisome given that 
there is evidence suggesting that youth who use both cigars and cigarettes are more likely to 
use both products more frequently (3). While risks to health from using cigars are related to 
frequency and extent of inhalation, even without inhalation, cigar users are at increased risk 
of oral, pharyngeal, laryngeal, and esophageal cancers (4, 5). Despite these negative effects 
on health, studies have shown that some youth report cigars to be less harmful than 
cigarettes (6, 7).
Before 2016, most cigars sold in the U.S. carried a warning message as a result of 
settlements in 2000 between the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the seven largest 
U.S. Cigar manufacturers (8). Effective August 2016 with new regulations from the FDA, all 
cigars will also carry two additional warning statements, in addition to four of the already 
existing warning statements from the Federal Trade Commission (9}. The warnings are as 
follows:
1.
Warning: Cigar smoking can cause cancers of the mouth and throat, even if you 
do not inhale.
2.
Warning: Cigar smoking can cause lung cancer and heart disease.
3.
Warning: Cigars are not a safe alternative to cigarettes.
4.
Warning: Tobacco smoke increases the risk of lung cancer and heart disease, 
even in nonsmokers.
5.
Warning: This product contains nicotine derived from tobacco. Nicotine is an 
addictive chemical.
6.
Warning: Cigar use while pregnant can harm you and your baby.
The first four warning statements were created to counter false beliefs that cigars do not 
carry health risks regardless of inhalation; that cigars are safer than cigarettes; and that cigar 
smoke does not affect non-smokers (8). The fifth cigar warning statement regarding nicotine, 
an addictive chemical, has been required for inclusion on all FDA covered tobacco products, 
including cigars (8). This warning is intended to help reduce consumers' beliefs that certain 
tobacco products are safe for use and that quitting tobacco products is easy (8). The final 
cigar warning statement is new and reflects the dangers of tobacco smoke during pregnancy 
(9).

 Previous research has shown that tobacco control messages, including warnings, that 
produce negative emotions or that highlight the negative aesthetic effects of smoking may be 
associated with believability of the messages, recall of health risks, and cessation behavior, 
especially among youth (10). Moreover, recent meta-analyses of warning experiments (11) 
and observational studies (12) have demonstrated a greater impact of pictorial vs. text-only 
warnings on various outcomes, including warning believability. However, no research to date 
has examined the believability of any specific warning labels for cigars among youth, which 
we investigate in this study.
Methods
Sampling
Data utilized in this research come from a national phone survey administered by the Center 
for Regulatory Research on Tobacco Communication (CRRTC) between November, 2014 
and June, 2015. The survey included questions on tobacco regulatory constructs. Three 
independent and non-overlapping frames were used for sampling, ensuring coverage to 
approximately 98% of U.S. households. The weighted sample is nationally-representative of 
13-17 year olds living in the U.S., with cell or landline access, who could expect to obtain 
consent from a guardian for a tobacco use phone survey. Both parent/guardian consent and 
adolescent assent were required for all adolescent participants. The sample resulted in 1,125 
interviews and a weighted response rate of 66%, which is comparable to the 2014 NYTS 
response rate of 73% (1). Participation was voluntary and anonymous. All procedures were 
approved by the UNC Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board (IRB # 13-2779).
Experimental data
Using a 4×3 experimental design, participants were told “imagine seeing this cigar warning” 
and then randomly assigned to receive one of twelve conditions. These included three of the 
six proposed cigar health messages that focused exclusively on cigars and were available at 
the time of this experiment: cigar smoking can cause lung cancer and heart disease, cigar 
smoking can cause cancers of the mouth and throat, even if you do not inhale, and cigars are 
not a safe alternative to cigarettes. Warnings began with one of four randomly assigned 
sources: FDA Warning, Surgeon General Warning, Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) Warning, or Warning (no source). This experiment was preceded by 
questions assessing awareness of the CDC and FDA (but not the Surgeon General) and recall 
of tobacco prevention campaigns. To control for previous exposure to the source of the 
warnings and previous health messages about tobacco, these variables were included as 
covariates, described below.
Believability was assessed with “how believable is this warning?” with responses for “very”, 
“somewhat”, or “not at all”. We used this item since previous studies have demonstrated the 
importance of believability in assessing how warning labels are processed by adolescents 
(13, 14) and demonstrating warning label impact (15, 16). For instance, in an experimental 
study examining affective and cognitive mediators of cigarette warning label impact, Emery 
et al. demonstrated that believability of warning label text was associated with decreased 
desire to smoke, increased feelings toward quitting, and heightened risk perceptions of

 cigarettes (17). We used cognitive interviewing to determine if adolescents understood the 
measure; no problems were reported.
Measures
Survey questions included demographic characteristics (i.e., age, sex, race, and ethnicity). 
Additional covariates used in our study included self-reported health status, awareness of the 
FDA and CDC, susceptibility to cigarette use, any tobacco use, and mean exposure to 
tobacco prevention campaigns.
Self-reported health status—Self-reported health status was measured with the item: 
“Would you say that in general your health is…”. Responses were dichotomized into 
“excellent or very good” or “good or fair”.
Awareness of the CDC and FDA—Awareness of the CDC and FDA were measured 
with two questions: “Have you ever heard of the CDC or the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention?” and “Have you ever heard of the FDA or the Food and Drug 
Administration?”. Responses included: “yes”, “no”, and “don't know / not sure / maybe”. 
Missing responses were excluded from analyses.
Susceptibility to cigarette use—Since susceptibility to cigarettes has been shown to 
predict adolescents at risk for future smoking (18), we included it as a covariate in this study. 
Two validated susceptibility items were used from Pierce et al.'s original four-item measure 
of adolescent smoking susceptibility (18). Using two of the four validated items has 
successfully identified adolescents susceptible to smoking cigarettes (19). The two questions 
we used were asked of all youth who had not used cigarettes in the past 30 days (regardless 
if they had ever tried a cigarette before). The questions were: “do you think you will smoke a 
cigarette in the next year?” and “if one of your best friends were to offer you a cigarette, 
would you smoke it?”. For both items, response options included: “definitely yes”, 
“probably yes”, “definitely not”, and “probably not”. If a participant chose anything but 
“definitely no” in response to any of the two questions, then he or she was classified as 
susceptible to cigarette smoking. Adolescents who reported using cigarettes in the past 30 
days were considered to be susceptible (since they already use cigarettes) and were not 
asked the two questions, in line with Pierce et al.'s classification of susceptibility (18). Our 
study therefore labeled adolescents as susceptible to cigarette use if they a) were classified 
as susceptible according to Pierce et al.'s items or b) reported using cigarettes in the past 30 
days.
Any current tobacco use—Participants were classified as any current tobacco product 
users if in the past 30 days they had used an e-cigarette or other vaping device; a little cigar 
or cigarillo; tobacco in a hookah; a cigarette; or any other tobacco product, such as chewing 
tobacco, dip, snus, premium cigars or any other product.
Mean exposure to tobacco prevention campaigns—Mean exposure to tobacco 
prevention campaigns was measured with 5 items that asked participants about specific FDA 
and CDC sponsored national tobacco prevention advertisements occurring at the time of the

 survey (e.g., have you ever seen or heard an anti-smoking ad where a young man pulls his 
tooth out with pliers?). All 5 items about specific anti-cigarette smoking advertisements 
included response options for “yes”, “no”, “don't know / not sure / maybe”. For these 
analyses, “don't know / not sure /maybe” were coded as “no”. All 5 items were summed to 
create an overall index score, ranging from 0-5, with higher scores indicating more exposure 
to tobacco prevention campaigns.
Data analysis
Analyses for this study were conducted with SAS version 9.3 to account for the complex 
survey design and sampling weights (20). Descriptive analyses and cross-tabulations were 
used to generate weighted percentages and confidence intervals of independent and 
dependent variables. Collinearity among the the demographic characteristics and other 
covariates was low, with variance inflation factor values less than 2 for all predictors.
Since there were three ordered response options to the outcome variable (i.e., very, 
somewhat, not at all believable), we initially conducted an ordinal logistic regression 
analysis to assess predictors associated with warning believability. However, since the 
proportional odds assumption was violated (X2 = 45.50, DF = 25, p=0.007) and few 
respondents chose the option “not at all believable” (n=70, 6.3%) (21), we conducted 
analyses utilizing a multivariable logistic regression model, comparing adolescents who 
reported the warnings to be very believable with adolescents who reported the warnings to 
be somewhat or not at all believable. We entered all predictors simultaneously into the 
multivariate logistic regression model to identify variables significantly associated with 
believability of the warnings.
We also conducted two sets of additional analyses. First, to determine if messages with any 
source (i.e., Surgeon General, FDA, CDC) were more believable than messages with no 
source, we conducted a separate multivariable logistic regression model with the four-level 
source condition dichotomized as any source vs. no source. Additionally, we examined an 
interaction between susceptibility status and message warning and stratified results from the 
multivariable logistic regression model by susceptibility status to determine if youth 
categorized as susceptible to using cigarettes found different messages to be very believable. 
Results from the logistic regression models include weighted percentages, adjusted odds 
ratios (AOR) and confidence intervals (CI). For all analyses, statistical significance was set 
at p < 0.05.
Results
A total of 1,125 adolescents (ages 13-17) completed the survey (66% response rate). Only 
individuals with complete data across all relevant variables were included in analyses. In our 
final logistic regression model, 64 observations (approximately 5.2% of the sample) were 
deleted because of missing responses to one or more of the variables used.
Descriptive statistics

 (48.7%); majority White (73.1%) and non-Hispanic (90.2%). Most adolescents reported 
being in excellent or very good health (80%), and a majority reported awareness of the CDC 
(57.7%) and FDA (83.7%). 7.5% of adolescents reported current use of any tobacco product 
and 16.9% were determined to be susceptible to smoking cigarettes. Out of a possible range 
of 0 to 5, mean exposure to tobacco prevention campaigns was 3.1, which means that on 
average, youth reported seeing 3 of the 5 national tobacco prevention advertisements 
assessed.
Weighted logistic regression results
Table 2 includes the weighted logistic regression results. A majority of adolescents reported 
the warning labels to be very believable (n=695, 60.5%), with fewer adolescents reporting 
the warning labels to be somewhat believable (n=359, 33.2%) or not at all believable (n=70, 
6.3%). More adolescents reported the message, “cigar smoking can cause lung cancer and 
heart disease” to be very believable (76.7%), compared to the message, “cigar smoking can 
cause cancers of the mouth and throat, even if you do not inhale” (53.4%), and the message, 
“cigars are not a safe alternative to cigarettes” (49.8%). Weighted logistic regression results 
confirmed that adolescents were significantly less likely to report the last two messages to be 
very believable compared to the first (AOR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.51 and AOR: 0.34; 95% 
CI: 0.24, 0.48, respectively). The source for the warning was not statistically significantly 
related to believability of the warning labels. When source was collapsed into categories for 
any source (i.e., CDC, Surgeon General, and FDA), vs. no source, no statistically significant 
effects on believability occurred (AOR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.44; results not shown).
The cigar warnings were widely believable for different adolescent sub-populations. Overall, 
there was little effect of demographic or additional covariates altering cigar warning 
believability. Specifically, race, ethnicity, age, sex, awareness of the FDA and CDC, health 
status and current any tobacco use were not significantly associated with believability of the 
cigar warnings. However, adolescents susceptible to using cigarettes were significantly less 
likely to report the messages to be very believable compared to adolescents not susceptible 
to using cigarettes (AOR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.86).
When we further analyzed the interaction between susceptibility status and message warning 
type (p=0.01), we found several differences between susceptible youth and non-susceptible 
youth. Compared to non-susceptible youth, significantly fewer susceptible youth reported 
the messages, “cigar smoking can cause lung cancer and heart disease” (AOR: 0.31, 95% CI: 
0.16, 0.63; results not shown) and “cigar smoking can cause cancers of the mouth and throat, 
even if you do not inhale” (AOR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.83; results not shown) to be very 
believable. Moreover, similar proportions of susceptible and non-susceptible youth reported 
the message, “cigars are not a safe alternative to cigarettes” to be very believable (55.7% vs. 
48.7%) and the difference in odds of susceptible or non-susceptible youth reporting this 
message to be very believable was not significant (AOR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.62, 2.17; results 
not shown).
In a separate set of analyses, we also stratified results by susceptibility status (Table 3). 
These results further confirmed differences in message believability between non-
susceptible youth and susceptible youth. Specifically, for susceptible youth, message type

 was not significantly associated with message believability and similar proportions of 
susceptible adolescents reported the three messages to be very believable.
Discussion
In this study, we found slightly more than 60% of adolescents in a U.S. national survey 
reported three different cigar warnings to be very believable. Messages emphasizing lung 
cancer and heart disease as risks caused by cigars were reported to be the most believable, 
compared to messages about mouth and throat cancer (regardless of inhalation) and the 
safety of cigars in comparison to cigarettes. There was no effect by source and little to no 
effect of demographic variables, indicating widespread believability of these messages, 
particularly among non-susceptible youth. Adolescents susceptible to using cigarettes, 
however, were less likely to report the warnings to be very believable.
This is the first study examining believability of warning labels for cigars among youth. All 
three of the cigar warnings we examined will be implemented in 2016 (9). We found one 
message “cigar smoking can cause lung cancer and heart disease” to be substantially more 
believable than the other two messages regarding mouth and throat cancer regardless of 
inhalation and the safety of cigars in comparison to cigarettes. There are several reasons why 
the latter two messages may be perceived as less believable. First, previous research has 
shown that some youth and young adults perceive cigars to be less harmful than cigarettes 
because of beliefs that they can modify cigars to make them safer (6), they can choose not to 
inhale, or they can decide to not inhale as much (22). Moreover, it is likely that only 
providing information on cigar warning that counters these misconceptions may not be 
enough to change how youth view these messages. In other words, more targeted messages 
or campaigns explaining the links between mouth and throat cancer (regardless of 
inhalation) and why cigars are not a safe alternative to cigarettes may be needed (17).
Mean exposure to the tobacco prevention campaigns was not significantly associated with 
believability of the cigar warnings. Since all of the tobacco prevention advertisements were 
about cigarettes, it is possible that with more targeted campaigns for cigars, believability of 
cigar warning labels could increase. Maryland was one of the first states to implement a 
campaign addressing youth cigar use through billboards, transit media, radio / print ads, and 
social media (23). While Maryland's “cigar trap” campaign has not been evaluated, it is 
possible that such a campaign could positively influence believability of cigar warning 
labels. If proven effective, similar campaigns could be considered for dissemination across 
the U.S.
Previous research has found warning label believability to be lower among adolescents who 
currently use cigarettes (14). In our study, we found that while current tobacco users of any 
product were not less likely to report the messages as less believable, youth susceptible to 
using cigarettes were less likely to report warnings as very believable. However, for one 
message specifically, “cigars are not a safe alternative to cigarettes”, similar proportions of 
susceptible and non-susceptible youth reported the message to be very believable. There is 
some evidence that adolescents may be susceptible to smoking because of their strong 
receptivity to pro-tobacco media (24, 25). This could explain why they would be less likely 
Kowitt et al.

 to believe the warnings in this current study. However, other reasons could also explain why 
youth susceptible to using cigarettes reported the warning labels to be less believable, 
including family, peer, school, community, and policy level influences. New research is 
needed on how cigar warnings can maximally reach and affect susceptible adolescents.
Few studies have investigated the impact of source credibility (i.e., the perceived credibility 
or competence of the organization delivering the message) in tobacco communication 
campaigns (26). Previous research suggests that messages with a credible source are more 
likely to be positively received and reported as believable than messages without a credible 
source (27, 28). Our study found limited evidence to suggest that source affects believability 
of cigar warning labels among youth. It is possible that telling adolescents the source of the 
warning would produce different results than having adolescents see the source of the 
warning as in logo-form or text. Moreover, it is unclear if source would significantly affect 
believability if a credible source was compared to a non-credible source (e.g., tobacco 
industry) rather than the absence of a source, as was done in this study. More formal testing 
in tobacco communication campaigns regarding the effects of source credibility on 
knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of warnings is warranted.
Lastly, findings from this study have implications for international settings as well as the 
U.S. For instance, in countries, such as Australia, where cigar warning labels include text 
warnings along with pictorial graphic warnings (29, 30), believability of warning labels 
would likely be enhanced, since pictorial warning labels are significantly more likely to 
engage consumers and increase information processing (10). Increased international 
research on how to improve cigar warning label effectiveness on adolescents is needed, 
particularly with regards to how cigar warning message and images interact to influence 
warning label believability and effectiveness.
Limitations
Several limitations are noted. First, as this was a phone survey, adolescents' reports of 
believability of the warning labels were based on hearing rather than seeing the warning 
labels. It is possible that believability would be enhanced when warning labels are seen 
rather than heard since previous research has found written presentations of messages to be 
more effective than audio only-presentation of the same information (31). Second, it is likely 
that some of the participants may have had prior exposure to cigar warning labels, and it is 
unclear what impact this could have had on believability. Lastly, there was no measure to 
assess awareness of the Surgeon General (as there was for FDA and CDC), and we were 
unable to assess additional covariates of interest, such as parent smoking status, peer 
smoking status, and opinions about the harms of cigars. Despite these limitations, our study 
relied on experimental data from a large, national sample of adolescents, 13-17 years old 
living in the U.S., and it is the first data on cigar warning perceptions among adolescents.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrated that several cigar warning labels are very believable, and that 
believability relates to adolescent susceptibility to cigarette use. Public health interventions 
and campaigns that target cigars may be useful in increasing believability of cigar warning

 labels, dispelling common myths about the safety of cigars, and decreasing frequency and 
duration of cigar use among youth. Future research should examine how believability of text 
and text combined with pictorial cigar warning labels may be associated with tobacco-
related outcomes, such as experimentation and quit intentions.

 Implications and Contributions
This study empirically examines the believability of FDA proposed cigar warning labels 
among adolescents. Results show that while many adolescents find cigar warnings very 
believable, some messages are more believable than others and that youth susceptible to 
using tobacco report messages as less believable.
