Abstract
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand gated ion channels that mediate fast chemical 
neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction and play diverse signaling roles in the central 
nervous system. The nicotinic receptor has been a model system for cell surface receptors, and 
specifically for ligand-gated ion channels, for well over a century1,2. In addition to the receptors’ 
prominent roles in the development of the fields of pharmacology and neurobiology, nicotinic 
receptors are important therapeutic targets for neuromuscular disease, addiction, epilepsy, and for 
neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery2–4. The overall architecture of the receptor 
was described in landmark studies of the nicotinic receptor isolated from the electric organ of 
Torpedo marmorata5. Structures of a soluble ligand binding domain have provided atomic-scale 
insights into receptor-ligand interactions6, while high-resolution structures of other members of 
the pentameric receptor superfamily provide touchstones for an emerging allosteric gating 
mechanism7. All available high-resolution structures are of homopentameric receptors. However, 
the vast majority of pentameric receptors (called Cys-loop receptors in eukaryotes) present 
physiologically are heteromeric. Here we present the X-ray crystallographic structure of the 
human α4β2 nicotinic receptor, the most abundant nicotinic subtype in the brain. This structure 
provides insights into the architectural principles governing ligand recognition, heteromer 
assembly, ion permeation and desensitization in this prototypical receptor class.
The α4β2 receptor is known to assemble in two functional subunit stoichiometries, 3α:2β 
and 2α:3β. The latter stoichiometry has an ~100-fold higher affinity for both acetylcholine 
and nicotine, lower single channel conductance and calcium permeability, and its expression 
is selectively upregulated by nicotine8–10. We used a small-scale fluorescence-based 
approach to optimize conditions for protein expression and purification that would yield the 
2α:3β form11. Growth of well-diffracting crystals required deleting most of the intracellular 
domain between transmembrane spans M3 and M4 in both subunits (Extended Data Figs. 1–
2). This crystallized receptor construct, referred to here as α4β2, retains function

 comparable to full-length protein, as discussed below. The best-diffracting crystals were 
obtained by co-crystallization with nicotine and a cholesterol analog, and allowed for 
collection of a complete dataset to 3.9 Å resolution (see Methods and Extended Data Table 
1).
The structure of the α4β2 receptor was solved by molecular replacement (see Methods). 
Subunit identities were initially assigned based on features in electron density maps from the 
vicinity of the neurotransmitter binding pocket (Extended Data Figs. 3a, b). To further 
interrogate subunit identity, we co-crystallized the receptor with 5-Iodo-A-85380, a potent 
agonist that, like acetylcholine and nicotine, is expected to bind only at α-β interfaces12. 
From a low-resolution isomorphous dataset we observed iodine anomalous signal in only the 
two assigned α-β interfaces (Extended Data Fig. 3c). After finalizing subunit assignment, 
electron density maps were of sufficient quality to build and refine nearly all of the 
extracellular and transmembrane domains, as well as a portion of the intracellular domain 
(Extended Data Figs. 1 and 3).
The α4β2 receptor resembles a cylinder formed from 5 subunits in a pseudo-symmetric 
arrangement about the channel axis. The crystal structure reveals a subunit ordering of α-β-
β-α-β around the pentameric ring (Figs. 1a, b), consistent with functional studies of 
concatameric receptors13. The α4 and β2 subunits share 59% amino acid sequence identity 
and adopt similar backbone conformations (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Figs. 4a, b). Each 
subunit comprises a large extracellular domain with an amino-terminal α-helix and 10 β-
strands that wrap inward to form a sandwich. The C-terminal bundle comprises 3 
transmembrane α-helices (M1–M3), an amphipathic or intracellular MX helix, and a final 
transmembrane α-helix (M4). The overall architecture is similar to that found in the other 
Cys-loop receptor family members of known structure (Extended Data Fig 4c and Extended 
Data Table 2)7. The MX helix, about which comparatively little structural information is 
available, closely resembles the conformation observed in the 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R) 
structure (Extended Data Fig. 4c)14. The Cys-loop receptor superfamily takes its name from 
a conserved disulfide bond linking the β6 and β7 strands in the extracellular domain. A 
second disulfide bond is formed between adjacent cysteines at the tip of Loop C in the α4 
subunits (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b and 5g–i), a feature that defines nicotinic receptor α 
subunits and is absent in all other Cys-loop receptors15. Electron density was observed for 
nicotine at the two α-β interfaces in the extracellular domain and for a single N-
acetylglucosamine residue linked to a conserved asparagine in the Cys-loop of each subunit 
(Extended Data Figs. 3f, g). The interior surface of the receptor begins at a large 
extracellular vestibule that narrows into a funnel-shaped transmembrane channel defined by 
the pore-lining M2 α-helices; mutations in this region are linked to autosomal dominant 
nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (Extended Data Fig. 1)4. A strong electron density peak in 
the pore was modeled speculatively as a combination of Na+ ion and water in an 
arrangement similar to that seen in a prokaryotic pentameric receptor, GLIC16 (see Methods 
and Extended Data Figs. 3h, i). The channel is in a desensitized, non-conducting 
conformation most similar to that observed in the GABAAR structure17, however the overall 
receptor conformation is distinct.

 Nicotine activity in the brain, including its reinforcing properties that lead to addiction, is 
mediated principally by α4β2 receptors18,19. To validate the receptor constructs used in 
crystallization, we quantified the binding affinities of a panel of ligands for the purified 
receptor (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2d). Among the three classes of subunit interfaces, 
we observed electron density for nicotine only at the α-β interfaces (Fig. 2b). The ligand 
was positioned based on the strong omit electron density (6.8–8.0 σ, Extended Data Figs. 3f, 
g) and comparison with the high resolution structure of the acetylcholine binding protein 
(AChBP) in complex with nicotine (Extended Data Fig. 6)6. We first analyzed interactions 
of nicotine with the receptor and then compared the positions of corresponding residues at 
non α-β interfaces to understand principles of binding selectivity.
Nicotine binds in the classical neurotransmitter site at the α-β interface, almost fully buried 
from solvent. The α4 subunit forms the (+) side of the binding pocket and the β2 subunit 
forms the (−) side (Figs. 2b, c). Three loops from each side of the interface contribute to 
binding of orthosteric ligands, A, B and C from the (+) side, and D, E and F from the (−) 
side. Residues from loops A–E form a tightly-packed aromatic box surrounding nicotine, 
with the floor formed by Y100 on Loop A and W57 on the β2 strand in Loop D. The back 
walls are defined by W156 in Loop B and L121 on the β6 strand in Loop E. The front wall 
of the pocket is formed by Loop C, which packs tightly onto the ligand, contributing 
interactions from the vicinal cysteines and from Y197 and Y204. The hydrophobic top of the 
pocket is formed by V111 and F119 in Loop E. In addition to the aromatic and hydrophobic 
interactions with these side chains, nicotine is poised to form a hydrogen bond between its 
electropositive pyrrolidine nitrogen and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of W156. The 
pyrrolidine nitrogen is also well-oriented to form a cation-π interaction with the indole ring 
of W156, a recurring ligand-receptor interaction in the superfamily, though not always to 
this tryptophan20. Residues in Loop F do not contribute directly to nicotine binding, however 
D170 on Loop F likely stabilizes loop C via a hydrogen bond to the backbone nitrogen of 
C199 (Extended Data Figs. 5, 6).
To date all high resolution structural information for Cys-loop receptors has come from 
homopentameric assemblies, leaving many questions unanswered regarding architecture of 
the non-canonical interfaces. The α4β2 crystal structure reveals a surprising reorganization 
of the conserved aromatic residues in the β-β and β-α interfaces that precludes nicotine 
binding. The source of the reorganization appears to be the identity of the residue that 
precedes the Loop B tryptophan by two positions. In the α4 subunit, this residue is a glycine 
(G154); in β2, it is an arginine (R149). When the β2 subunit contributes to the (+) side of the 
interface (Figs. 2d, e), this R149 orients longitudinally into the base of the binding pocket. 
The second tyrosine on Loop C is not present in the β2 subunit, which allows Y196 to 
change its rotameric position, orienting toward the membrane. A second tyrosine, Y95 in 
Loop A, rotates away from the membrane. The result of the switch in conformations of these 
two tyrosines is that the positively charged guanidinium group of R149 is sandwiched 
between their two aromatic rings, in a sense satisfying the electron-rich π system as the 
pyrrolidine nitrogen of nicotine does in the α-β interfaces. A consequence of the 
reorganization around the arginine is that W151 in Loop B must move; its side chain rotates 
out of the binding pocket completely. The conformations of these residues on the (+) side 
are similar between the β-β and β-α interfaces; the differences between them arise from the

 (−) side of the interface, where three hydrophobic groups on the (−) side of the β2 subunit 
are replaced by polar side chains on the (−) side of the α4 subunit (Fig. 2e). This difference 
in chemical environment may affect nicotine binding to α4-α4 interfaces in the 3α:2β 
stoichiometry21. The polar environment on the (−) face of the α4 subunit may be less 
favorable for nicotine binding in the orientation we observe at the α-β interfaces, wherein 
the pyridine ring packs against the hydrophobic (−) face of the β subunit. By comparison, 
the homopentameric α7 nicotinic receptor preserves two of the three hydrophobic residues 
in Loop E (Extended Data Fig. 6a) and maintains nicotine binding, albeit with lower affinity.
After prolonged exposure to agonist, nicotinic receptors desensitize, adopting a high-affinity 
and agonist-bound, non-conducting conformation7. We performed patch clamp 
electrophysiology experiments comparing responses of full-length and crystallized α4β2 
receptor constructs to acetylcholine and found them to behave similarly (Fig. 3a). We next 
measured responses to 1 mM nicotine, as was used throughout purification and for 
crystallization, and observed that the receptor desensitized profoundly within a few 
milliseconds. This functional result predicts that we would observe a desensitized, non-
conducting conformation in the structure. The receptor structure reveals the transmembrane 
channel tapering to a constriction point at the interface with the cytosol (Fig. 3b). The 
narrowest point in the pore is defined by glutamate side chains at the −1′ position of the M2 
α-helices, which give rise to a constriction of 3.8 Å in diameter (Figs. 3b, c). The consensus 
on minimum pore diameter among cation-selective Cys-loop receptors is in the range of ~6–
8 Å22,23, consistent with the permeant ion being at least partially hydrated. The α4β2 
receptor is a non-selective cation channel, being permeable to Na+, K+ and Ca2+. Na+ is the 
smallest, with an ionic diameter of 1.90 Å. Adding a single equatorial water molecule (2.8 Å 
diameter) would put the diameter of the permeant species above the observed constriction 
size. We compared the α4β2 receptor pore conformation to those from recent structures that 
likely represent the three principal receptor states: resting-closed (glycine receptor + 
strychnine24; GlyR-closed), activated-open (glycine receptor + glycine24; GlyR-open) and 
desensitized-closed (GABAAR17) (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 7). The pore 
conformation of the α4β2 receptor most closely resembles the desensitized GABAAR, 
where the gate is at the cytosolic end of the pore. Functional studies also suggest that the 
desensitization gate is located at the cytosolic side of the pore25. Thus, structural and 
functional analyses are consistent with the α4β2 receptor structure representing a 
desensitized, non-conducting state.
To probe mechanisms of ion selectivity, we analyzed the electrostatic properties of the 
permeation pathway of the α4β2 receptor (Fig. 3d). The surface of the extracellular 
vestibule is strongly electronegative, which likely serves to increase the local concentration 
of cations near the channel mouth. The electrostatic potential becomes more neutral at the 
extracellular end of the pore, where the 20′ glutamate side chains from the two α4 subunits 
are offset by the 20′ lysine side chains from the three β2 subunits. This 20′ position is the 
only site in the pore where the α4 and β2 subunits contribute opposing charges to the 
electrostatic surface, and thus is where alternate subunit stoichiometries would be expected 
to most strongly influence permeation properties. Indeed, the higher Ca2+ permeability of 
the 3α:2β stoichiometry of this receptor has been shown to result from the swap of lysine to 
glutamate at the 20′ position in that assembly9. Approaching the constriction point in the

 pore, the surface becomes strongly electronegative, dominated by the five glutamate side 
chains that form the selectivity filter at the base of the pore. The side chains are folded 
toward the pore axis with their carboxylates likely stabilized through hydrogen bonding with 
the −2′ backbone carbonyl oxygens from adjacent subunits.
To move beyond the local conformation observed in the pore, and to place the α4β2 receptor 
structure in the context of the resting-activated-desensitized gating cycle, we next compared 
the overall conformation of the α4β2 receptor to the reference structures for distinct 
conformations. Structures of GluCl26 and the glycine receptor24, each in multiple 
conformations, suggest that within an individual subunit, the extracellular (ECD) and 
transmembrane subdomains (TMD) behave in large part as rigid bodies during state 
transitions. Thus we initially compared the extracellular and transmembrane subdomains of 
an α4 subunit with the analogous subdomains from the open and desensitized structures 
described in the previous section (Extended Data Figs. 8a–c). We found that the Cα 
backbones from these subdomains superimpose well (Cα r.m.s.d 1.6–2.8 Å), with 
noteworthy differences in loops at the extracellular-transmembrane interface thought to be 
involved in signal transduction. These loops include the β1-β2, M2–M3 and Cys-loops from 
the (+) subunit and the β8-β9 loop and the β10-M1 helix junction in the (−) subunit. To 
understand how the reorganization of these interfacial loops relates to global conformational 
changes, we superimposed whole receptors based on alignment of their pentameric 
transmembrane domains, and examined corresponding differences in the extracellular 
domains. We were surprised to find that while the GABAAR pore is tightly closed, more so 
even than α4β2 (Fig. 3c), the conformation of the GABAAR extracellular domain much 
more closely resembles the open GlyR structure than the α4β2 receptor structure (Extended 
Data Figs. 8d, e).
Examination of the interactions between the extracellular and transmembrane domains 
further illustrates the differences between the open and the two desensitized conformations 
(Figs. 4a–d). At the ECD-TMD interface, local loop conformations are similar between the 
GlyR-open and the GABAAR structures (Fig. 4b). Comparison of α4β2 with both the GlyR-
open (Fig. 4c) and the GABAAR (Fig. 4d) structures reveals concerted displacements in 
α4β2 of the β1-β2, M2–M3 and Cys-loops on the (+) subunit and the β8-β9 loop and the 
β10-M1 helix on the (−) subunit. These displacements are maximal at the Cys-loop, with 
differences between reference Cα atoms of 6.5 Å for α4β2 vs. GABAAR and 7.4 Å for 
α4β2 vs. GlyR-open. Analysis of the conformational differences at the subunit level 
between α4β2 and GlyR-open that generate these displacements suggests a 15° rotation 
around an axis passing through the Cys-loop (Extended Data Fig. 8f). This rotation results in 
closure of the ion channel and necessitates reorganization of the ECD-TMD interface. In 
contrast, analysis of the conformational differences between α4β2 and GABAAR suggests a 
13° tilting of the ECD (Extended Data Fig. 8g). As a result, from α4β2 to the GABAAR, the 
pore remains similarly closed, but the ECD-TMD interface is different. In both cases, the 
resulting displacement of the Cys-loop at the pivot point coincides with a major alteration in 
the conformation of the M1 helix of α4β2 relative to GlyR-open and to GABAAR (Figs. 4e–
g).

 Our structural analysis suggests that the α4β2 and GABAAR structures represent distinct 
desensitized states. Kinetically-distinct desensitized states are well described for both 
GABAA and nicotinic receptors27,28. The electrophysiology data for nicotine at the α4β2 
receptor, and other studies of nicotine at the rat α4β2 receptor29, are consistent with a 
desensitized receptor; those presented with the GABAAR structure are potentially consistent 
with an intermediate or transitional state stabilized by the novel agonist benzamidine. We 
speculate that the extensive conformational rearrangements observed in the α4β2 receptor 
ECD-TMD interface further stabilize the receptor and thereby contribute to the increased 
affinity for agonist in the desensitized state7. This progression of quaternary rearrangements 
is illustrated in Figure 5. These interpretations are tentative as both of these structures were 
determined in the presence of detergent, removed from the native membrane environment 
known to be important for pentameric receptor function30. Additional Cys-loop receptor 
structures in desensitized states, and of nicotinic receptors in additional states, will help 
elucidate the detailed structural changes underlying desensitization.
Here we describe the X-ray structure of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the 
heteropentameric α4β2 receptor. This structure of a heteromeric Cys-loop receptor sheds 
light on the architecture of the neurotransmitter site with bound nicotine and illustrates why 
the two other classes of binding sites are unable to bind classical nicotinic agonists. The 
receptor is locked in a non-conducting, desensitized conformation by the agonist nicotine. 
The α4β2 receptor conformation is strikingly distinct from prior structural information on a 
desensitized GABAA receptor, and thereby provides an important addition toward mapping 
the structural basis of allosteric gating in Cys-loop receptors.
Methods
Protein expression and purification
The human α4 and β2 nicotinic receptor genes were provided by Dr. Jon Lindstrom at the 
University of Pennsylvania. For the purposes of small-scale biochemical screening, a 
synthesized EGFP gene was spliced into the M3–M4 loop of each subunit and the genes 
were subcloned into the pEZT bacmam expression vector11. The EGFP fusion to one subunit 
was co-transfected into GnTI- HEK cells (ATCC CRL-3022) with a panel of deletion 
constructs for the partner subunit; a large number of constructs were screened in this manner 
for expression and pentameric monodispersity by Fluorescence-detection Size Exclusion 
Chromatography (FSEC)31. The final expression constructs for crystallization included the 
native signal peptides and residues 1–338 and 556–601 in the α4 subunit and residues 1–330 
and 417–477 in the β2 subunit (residue numbering here is for the wild-type mature, signal-
peptide-cleaved protein sequence). Deletion of the M3–M4 loop has been shown to not 
affect function in other Cys-loop receptor family members32. To promote crystallization a 
Glu-Arg linker was inserted in the MX-M4 junction, between Phe559-Ser560 in the α4 
subunit and between Gln420-Ser421 in the β2 subunit. For purification purposes a Strep-tag 
was inserted at the C-terminus of the β2 subunit preceded by a Ser-Ala linker. Previously 
identified expression conditions resulted in a homogenous receptor subunit stoichiometry of 
two α4 and three β2 subunits11. For large-scale expression, 1.6 L of suspension GnTI- cells 
were transduced with multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of 0.25:0.5 for the α4 and β2

 subunits, respectively. Nicotine (Sigma-Aldrich) and sodium butyrate (Sigma-Aldrich) were 
added at the time of transduction to 0.1 mM and 3 mM, respectively. At the time of 
transduction, suspension cells were moved to 30 °C and 8% CO2. After 72 hours, cells were 
collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl (TBS 
buffer), 1 mM nicotine and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich), and 
disrupted using an Avestin Emulsiflex. Lysed cells were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 
10,000 g; supernatants containing membranes were centrifuged 2 hours at 186,000 g. 
Membrane pellets were mechanically homogenized and solubilized for 1 hour at 4 °C, in a 
solution containing TBS, 40 mM n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM; Anatrace), 1 mM 
nicotine and 0.2 mM cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS; Anatrace). Solubilized membranes 
were centrifuged for 40 minutes at 186,000 g then passed over high capacity Strep-Tactin 
(IBA) affinity resin. The resin was washed with Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) 
buffer containing TBS, 1 mM DDM, 1 mM nicotine, 0.2 mM CHS and 1 mM TCEP 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and eluted in the same buffer containing 5 mM desthiobiotin 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Peak elution fractions were concentrated and digested with 
Endoglycosidase H overnight in a 1:8 w:w ratio at 4 °C. This material was then injected over 
a Superose 6 10/300 GL column equilibrated in SEC buffer wherein DDM was replaced 
with 2 mM n-undecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (Anatrace). Peak fractions were assayed by 
FSEC, monitoring tryptophan fluorescence, before pooling and concentrating for 
crystallization.
Crystallization, X-ray Data Collection and Structure Solution
Purified α4β2 was concentrated to 1.5–2.5 mg/mL in SEC buffer and crystallized by 
hanging drop vapor diffusion. The best-diffracting crystals of the nicotine-bound receptor 
were obtained after mixing protein with reservoir solution containing 0.05 M ADA pH 6.8, 
12.5% PEG 1500 and 10% PEG 1000 in a 1:1 ratio and incubating over sealed wells 
containing 0.5 mL reservoir, at 14 °C. The crystals were cryoprotected with additional PEG 
1000, PEG 1500 and ethylene glycol before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Crystals of the 
5-Iodo-A-85380 (IA)33-bound receptor were obtained using the same approach, however the 
protein was purified in the absence of ligand, with IA added after SEC to a concentration of 
0.5 mM. The best diffracting crystals of the IA complex were obtained at 14 °C using a 
reservoir solution of 0.05 M ADA pH 6.5 and 24% PEG 400; crystals were cryoprotected 
with additional PEG 400 before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected 
at the 24-ID-C beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL). Both datasets were 
collected from single crystals. The dataset from the IA complex was collected at low energy 
(7300 eV) to maximize anomalous signal from iodine in the ligand.
Diffraction datasets were integrated and scaled using HKL200034. The “Auto Corrections” 
option was used to assess anisotropic signal to noise, determine the resolution to use in 
refinement, and perform ellipsoidal truncation of the data as well as anisotropic B factor 
sharpening. The data from the nicotine complex were highly anisotropic, extending to ~3.6 
Å in the best direction and ~4.5 Å in the worst. Electron density maps using the auto-
corrected data contain far more features than the unmodified data and thus were used for all 
of the manual model building. However, truncated data from “auto corrections” suffer from 
low completeness in the high resolution shells. We thus used the UCLA diffraction

 anisotropy server35 to perform more conservative truncation and sharpening of the data; the 
deposited model underwent a final round of refinement against this truncated dataset to 
generate the statistics shown in Extended Data Table 1. The deposited structure factors 
include both sets of these truncated, sharpened data.
The structure of the nicotine-bound α4β2 receptor was solved by molecular replacement 
using a pentameric homology model based on the desensitized GABAA β3 receptor 
structure (PDB: 4COF)17, with models of the acetylcholine receptor α4 and β2 subunits 
generated using Swissmodel36. A panel of homology models was made comprising different 
orderings of subunits around the pentameric ring; the best molecular replacement search 
model had an ordering of α-β-β-α-β. Distinct electron density features, mainly in Loop C, 
provided the first convincing clues into subunit identity. Swapping positions of α4 and β2 
subunits in the pentamer, followed by monitoring of R factors after refinement, supported 
the subunit assignment, however we sought additional validation. The potent agonist IA is 
expected to bind only in the canonical neurotransmitter site found at α-β interfaces. We 
exploited anomalous signal in a low resolution dataset of the α4β2-IA complex to 
independently validate subunit assignment. After rigid body refinement of the nicotine-
bound model in this IA-complex dataset, strong anomalous difference peaks were observed: 
one in each of the two binding pockets that we had assigned as α4-β2 interfaces (4.5σ and 
5.8σ) and similarly strong peaks near Cys-loop disulfides where four sulfur atoms are in 
close proximity. No anomalous difference signal was observed at the corresponding position 
in the β-α or β-β interfaces. Once the subunit arrangement was confirmed, iterative cycles of 
manual rebuilding in Coot37, jelly body refinement in Refmac38 and further restrained 
refinement in Phenix39 were performed. The Fitmunk server40 was used to identify 
improved side chain rotamers. Torsion-angle non-crystallographic symmetry restraints (α4 
subunits and β2 subunits as separate groups), group B factors (one per residue) and TLS 
parameters (two groups per subunit) were used in refinement with Phenix.
The ECDs and TMDs were modeled with a high degree of confidence, with electron density 
visible for most side chains, one GlcNAc residue per subunit and two molecules of nicotine. 
One exception to the overall well-ordered ECD is the distal end of Loop C in the β2 
subunits, which exhibited weak electron density in two of the three β subunits, and thus its 
modeling is tentative. A pancake-shaped difference electron density peak midway along the 
ion channel was modeled as a sodium ion coordinated by water molecules mediating H-
bonds to the proximal threonine side chains. The sodium ion and water assignments are 
speculative; they were based on NaCl being the only salt present in purification and 
crystallization, the channel being selective for cations, B factors after refinement, and a 
similar arrangement of sodium and water in the high resolution structure of the bacterial pH-
gated cation channel GLIC16. The register matches that of the AChBPs in the extracellular 
domain and the 5-HT3R, GABAAR, GlyR and GluCl structures in the transmembrane 
domain. Comparisons were also made with the Torpedo ACh receptor structure and were 
found to be different in register throughout much of the TMD, as previously 
described17,41–43. There was no observable electron density for 7 residues in the N-terminus 
of the α4 subunit, 11 and 15 residues linking the MX helix (following M3) to the M4 helix 
of the α4 and β2 subunits and 5 and 30 residues from the C-termini of the α4 and β2 
subunits. While there was clear electron density for the MX helix, the observable density

 between M3 and M4 was disordered relative to the rest of the receptor leading to some 
ambiguity in modeling, in particular in the linker between the M3 helix and the MX helix. In 
the final refined model the MX helix register matches that observed in the 5-HT3R 
structure14. The five glutamate residues that define the pore constriction were not all well 
resolved. We modeled all five side chains in the same rotameric conformation based on 
convincing electron density for a subset. In the open state these glutamates are likely highly 
dynamic with heterogeneous conformations affecting conductance44.
Sequence alignments were made using PROMALS3D45. Ligand-receptor interactions were 
analyzed with areaimol in the CCP4 suite46,47 and the CaPTURE program48. Structural 
superpositions were made using Superpose49 in the CCP4 suite. Subunit interfaces were 
analyzed using the PDBe-PISA server50. Pore diameters were calculated using HOLE51. 
Structural figures were made with PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC) including the APBS 
electrostatics plugin52. Crystallographic software packages were compiled by SBGrid53. 
Domain movements were analyzed using DynDom, http://fizz.cmp.uea.ac.uk/dyndom/.
Radioligand Binding
Experiments to measure binding of [3H]-epibatidine (PerkinElmer, 32.46 Ci/mmol) to the 
α4β2 receptor, as well as competition with other ligands, were performed with protein 
purified as for crystallization but in the absence of ligands. The concentration of binding 
sites was kept at 0.1 nM after a preliminary experiment to determine optimal receptor 
concentration. In addition to the protein, the binding assay conditions included 20 mM Tris 
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DDM, and 1 mg/mL streptavidin-YiSi scintillation proximity 
assay beads (SPA; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Non-specific signal was determined in the 
presence of 100 μM [1H]-nicotine; all data shown are from background-subtracted 
measurements. For competition assays [3H]-epibatidine concentration was fixed at 1 nM. All 
data were analyzed using Prism 6 software (GraphPad) with variable Hill slope. Ki values 
were calculated based on the experimentally determined Kd of 96 pM for [3H]-epibatidine.
Electrophysiology
To test the α4β2 receptor channel function, adherent GnTI- HEK cells were transfected with 
0.5 μg of plasmid DNA for each subunit and 0.2 μg of a GFP expression plasmid using 
Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The GFP expression plasmid was included 
to identify the cells for recording. After incubating for 72 hours at 30°C and 5% CO2 the 
cells were patched using the whole-cell configuration and clamped at a membrane potential 
of −90 mV. The recordings were made with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, low-pass filtered at 
5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using the Digidata 1440A and pClamp 10 software 
(Molecular Devices). Borosilicate glass pipettes (King Precision Glass, Inc) were pulled and 
polished to 2–4 MΩ resistance. The bath solution contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 4 
CaCl2, 4 MgCl2, 10 Hepes pH 7.3 and 10 glucose. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 
150 CsF, 10 NaCl, 10 EGTA, 20 Hepes pH 7.3. The acetylcholine chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) 
and nicotine solutions were prepared in bath solution. Solution exchange was achieved using 
a gravity driven RSC-200 rapid solution changer (Bio-Logic).

representative pentameric ligand gated ion channel structures (magenta) on the chain A α4

inserted leucine residue found in the M2–M3 loops of α4 and β2 subunits relative to other 
receptors shown here (this loop was unmodeled in the 5-HT3R structure, however that 
protein has the same loop length as α4 and β2). The most similar subunit structure overall to 
α4 is GLIC, which has been thought to represent an open state, however studies on its 
desensitization properties58–60 and comparison to the α4β2 receptor structure here and in 
Extended Data Fig. 8 suggest it may rather represent a desensitized conformation. 
Conversely, the Torpedo nicotinic receptor structure, while clearly adopting the same overall 
fold, aligns less well structurally with α4 than does GLIC. This difference may relate to the 
Torpedo receptor being in a closed-resting state; notable differences in the backbone 
conformation of the Torpedo M2–M3 and Cys-loops (inset) compared to all other structures 
are less straightforward to interpret.

only the residues likely to be involved in forming H-bonds and electrostatic interactions are 
shown. These potential interactions are shown as dashed lines (2.4–3.9 Å). The subunit 
interfaces are predominantly stabilized through van der Waals interactions, with interspersed 
hot spots of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions of known functional 
importance. The N-terminal helix of the receptor is important in pentameric assembly and 
mutations in this region of other pentameric receptors results in disease17. Loop C is 
essential for orthosteric ligand binding, the M2–M3 loop is critical for allosteric signal 
transduction7, and residues at the apex of M1 and at the intracellular base of the pore are 
known to affect desensitization25,61.

 Extended Data Table 2
Surface areas buried at subunit interfaces. a,Buried area at subunit interfaces in the α4β2 
receptor and other pentameric receptors. The 5-HT3R structure contains an extra section of 
the intracellular domain (Extended Data Fig. 4c), which accounts for its larger subunit 
interface area. Glycine receptor structures include two from cryo-EM studies (3JAE and 
3JAD in the open and resting states, respectively)24 and one from X-ray crystallography in 
the resting state (5CFB)56. b, Surface areas buried by only Loop C. We analyzed inter-
subunit interactions in the α4β2 receptor to investigate mechanisms underlying heteromeric 
receptor assembly. The crystal structure of the receptor reveals three classes of subunit 
interfaces: α-β, β-β and β-α. All three interface types in the receptor are comparable in 
terms of surface area buried to the most tightly packed Cys-loop receptor structures. Of the 
three interface classes in the α4β2 receptor, the α-β interface is the most extensive; the 
majority of this difference is provided by Loop C, which is significantly longer in the α 
subunit and forms extensive contacts with the neighboring β subunit (Extended Data Fig. 
5g–i). Among the pentameric receptors of known structure, the α4β2 nicotinic receptor is 
closest in sequence and function to the Torpedo nicotinic receptor5. We compared backbone 
conformations and inter-subunit interactions between these two structures (Extended Data 
Figs. 4c). We found that the α4β2 receptor conformation is more similar to other eukaryotic 
receptors and the bacterial receptor GLIC than to the Torpedo receptor. We additionally 
observed that subunit interfaces are much more loosely packed in the Torpedo receptor 
structure. Due to these differences and to a previously-described register inconsistency in its 
transmembrane domain17,24,41–43 we limited our further structural comparisons with the 
Torpedo nicotinic receptor.
