Objectives. To examine sex and racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of 9
substance-use disorders (SUDs)—alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogen or PCP, opiate,
amphetamine, inhalant, sedative, and unspecified drug— in youths during the 12 years
after detention.
Methods. We used data from the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a prospective longi-
tudinal study of 1829 youths randomly sampled from detention in Chicago, Illinois, starting
in 1995 and reinterviewed up to 9 times in the community or correctional facilities through
2011. Independent interviewers assessed SUDs with Diagnostic Interview Schedule for
Children 2.3 (baseline) and Diagnostic Interview Schedule version IV (follow-ups).
Results. By median age 28 years, 91.3% of males and 78.5% of females had ever had
anSUD. Atmostfollow-ups,maleshadgreateroddsofalcohol-andmarijuana-usedisorders.
Drug-use disorders were most prevalent among non-Hispanic Whites, followed by His-
panics,thenAfricanAmericans(e.g.,comparedwithAfricanAmericans,non-HispanicWhites
had 32.1 times the odds of cocaine-use disorder [95% confidence interval= 13.8, 74.7]).
Conclusions. After detention, SUDs differed markedly by sex, race/ethnicity, and
substance abused, and, contrary to stereotypes, did not disproportionately affect
African Americans. Services to treat substance abuse—during incarceration and
after release—would reach many people in need, and address health disparities in
a highly vulnerable population. (Am J Public Health. 2016;106:872–880. doi:

he Department of Justice estimates that,
among males born in 2001, 1 in 3 African
Americans and 1 in 6 Hispanics will be in-
carcerated at some point during their lifetime,
compared with 1 in 17 non-Hispanic Whites.1
Racial/ethnic minorities are disproportion-
atelyincarcerated,especiallyfordrugcrimes.2–4
More than 2.4 million youths and adults are
currently incarcerated in the United States.5–7
Every year, there are nearly 1.4 million arrests
of juveniles; more than 250000 cases result in
detention.8 Substance abuse is a significant
problem among youths in the juvenile justice
system.9,10 More than 90% report having
used illicit drugs.11 Irrespective of sex or race/
ethnicity, substance-use disorders (SUDs) are
the most common psychiatric disorders among
delinquent youths: 49% to 76%12,13 of males
and 34% to 77%12–14 of females have an SUD.
After detention, SUDs present a continu-
ing challenge for the community mental
health system. Most stays in detention are
brief (median, 15 days),15 and when detained
youths return to their communities, a sub-
stantial proportion may need treatment of
SUDs as they age.16 Delinquent youths face
challenges attaining adult social roles,17 such
as establishing stable careers18 and families19;
continued substance abuse further compro-
mises their futures.
Despite its importance, few longitudinal
studies of delinquent youths have examined
the prevalence of substance abuse during
young adulthood. We searched the literature
for prospective longitudinal studies of youths
in the juvenile justice system conducted since
1990 that met the following criteria: (1) fol-
lowed youths during young adulthood (‡ 21
years) and (2) measured alcohol or drug use or
disorder. Only 3 studies met these criteria
(summary table available from authors).16,20–22
These studies found that substance abuse
remained prevalent as youths aged.
Although these previous investigations
provide important information, they have
limitations. Ramchand et al. examined only
symptoms of dependence, not diagnoses.20
Diagnoses provide a more systematic, con-
sensually understood, and clinically mean-
ingful description of the frequency, severity,
and recency of symptoms.23–26 Moreover,
this study oversampled offenders referred for
substance abuse treatment, thus biasing the
sample.20 Chitsabesan et al. sampled fewer
than 100 participants and had nearly 50%
attrition; this study was conducted in the
United Kingdom, limiting generalizability to

 the United States.22 Teplin et al. examined
youths only up to a median age of 20
years.16,21 Most important, all 3 studies
combined drugs with dramatically different
etiologies and consequences—for instance,
marijuana (now legal in some states27–33) and
“hard drugs” (e.g., cocaine, hallucinogens or
PCP [phencyclidine], opiates). This approach
obfuscates important differences: substances
vary widely in their immediate and long-term
effects on brain chemistry,34–38 effects on
health (such as risk for HIV, fatal overdose,
drug-induced psychosis, myocardial infarc-
tion, liver disease, neurotoxic effects, and
pancreatitis),39–43 and social consequences
(e.g., unemployment44 and risk for adolescent
pregnancy45).
We addressed the limits of previous in-
vestigations. To our knowledge, this is the
first comprehensive epidemiological study of
SUDs in delinquent youths during young
adulthood (up to median age 28 years). We
used data from the Northwestern Juvenile
Project to assess 9 SUDs: alcohol, marijuana,
cocaine, hallucinogen or PCP, opiate, am-
phetamine, inhalant, sedative, and unspeci-
fied drug. Focusing on sex and racial/ethnic
differences, we used multiple follow-up in-
terviews to examine (1) lifetime prevalence of
SUDs and (2) changes in the past-year
prevalence of SUDs during the 12 years
after youths leave detention. The sample is
large (n = 1829), includes males (n = 1172)
and females (n = 657), and is racially/
ethnically diverse.
This study is timely, providing data needed
to address health disparities. Hispanics are
especially important to study because they are
now the largest ethnic minority in the United
States, constituting 16.3% of the pop-
ulation.46 Together, African Americans and
Hispanics constitute more than one third of
young adults in the general population47 but
approximately two thirds of persons in-
carcerated in juvenile7 and adult facilities.48
METHODS
The most relevant information is sum-
marized here. Additional detail is in the
“eMethods,” available as a supplement to the

Sample and Procedures
We recruited a stratified random sample of
1829 youths at intake to the Cook County
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center in
Chicago, Illinois, between November 20,
1995, and June 14, 1998, who were awaiting
the adjudication or disposition of their case.
The Cook County Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center is used for pretrial deten-
tion and for offenders sentenced for less than
30 days. To ensure adequate representation of
key subgroups, we stratified our sample by
sex, race/ethnicity (African American, non-
Hispanic White, Hispanic, other), age (10 to
13 years or ‡ 14 years), and legal status
(processed in juvenile or adult court). The
sample included 1172 males and 657 females;
1005 African Americans, 296 non-Hispanic
Whites, 524 Hispanics, and 4 other race/
ethnicity; mean age, 14.9 years (Table A,
available as a supplement to the online version
of this article at http://www.ajph.org). Face-
to-face structured interviews were conducted
at the detention center in a private area, most
within 2 days of intake.
We conducted follow-up interviews (1) at
3, 4.5, 6, 8, and 12 years after baseline for the
entire sample; (2) at 3.5 and 4 years after
baseline for a random subsample of 997
participants (600 males and 397 females); and
(3) at 10 and 11 years after baseline for the last
800 participants enrolled at baseline (460
males and 340 females). Participants were
interviewed whether they lived in the
community or in correctional facilities. In-
terviews were conducted through 2011.
Participants signed either an assent form
(if they were aged < 18 years) or a consent
form (if they were aged ‡ 18 years). The
Northwestern University institutional review
board and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention institutional review board
approved all study procedures and waived
parental consent for persons younger than
18 years, consistent with federal regulations
regarding research with minimal risk.23
Measures
Baseline. We administered the Diagnostic
Interview Schedule for Children, version 2.3
(DISC 2.3),51,52 based on the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised
Third Edition (DSM-III-R), the most recent
version available at the time. The DISC 2.3
generates diagnoses for alcohol-, marijuana-,
and “other” illicit drug–use disorders (e.g.,
“hard drugs” such as cocaine, opiates, hallu-
cinogens or PCP) for the past 6 months. We
derived diagnoses for specific “other” illicit
drug use–disorders the same way the DISC 2.3
scores alcohol- and marijuana-use disorders.
Follow-up interviews. For follow-up in-
terviews, we administered the Diagnostic
Interview Schedule, version IV (DIS-IV)53,54
because the DISC was not sufficiently
comprehensive to cover the substance use
behaviors of aging delinquent youths.
The DIS-IV assesses SUDs in the year before
the interview for alcohol, marijuana, and
the following specific “other” illicit drugs:
amphetamines, sedatives, cocaine, opiates, hal-
lucinogens or PCP, inhalants, and unspecified
drugs. As in our earlier work,16 we checked
that changes in prevalence over time were not
attributable to changes in measurement. To
facilitate comparison with other large-scale
epidemiological studies of SUDs,55–58 we
report both lifetime and past-year prevalence.
Statistical Analysis
We conducted all analyses with com-
mercial software (Stata version 12; Stata Corp
LP, College Station, TX) with its survey
routines. To generate prevalence estimates
and inferential statistics that reflect Cook
County Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center’s population, we assigned each par-
ticipant a sampling weight augmented with
a nonresponse adjustment to account for
missing data.59 We used Taylor series line-
arization to estimate standard errors.60,61
Because some participants were inter-
viewed more often than others, we summa-
rize prevalence at 6 time points for the entire
sample: baseline (time 0) and time 1 through
time 5, corresponding to approximately 3, 5,
6, 8, and 12 years after baseline. Table A
summarizes sample demographics and re-
tention, and shows that 83% of participants
had a time-5 interview. Race/ethnicity
(African American, Hispanic, non-Hispanic
White, other) was self-identified.
We used logistic regression to examine
sex and racial/ethnic differences in lifetime
prevalence 12 years after baseline.
Changes in prevalence over time. We used all
available interviews, with an average of 7
interviews per person (range = 1–10

 interviews per person). We used generalized
estimating equations62 to fit marginal models
examining (1) differences in the prevalence of
SUDs by sex and race/ethnicity over time and
(2) changes in the prevalence of disorders over
time. Unless otherwise noted, odds ratios
contrast sex and race/ethnicity over time.
All generalized estimating equation
models included covariates for sex, race/
ethnicity (African American, Hispanic, or
non-Hispanic White), aging (time since
baseline), age at baseline (10–18 years), and
legal status at detention. We excluded the 4
participants who identified as “other” race/
ethnicity. We modeled time since baseline
with restricted cubic splines. When main
effects were significant, we estimated models
with the corresponding interaction terms. We
included only statistically significant in-
teraction terms in final models. For models
with significant interactions between sex and
aging, we report model-based odds ratios for
sex differences at 3, 5, 8, and 12 years after
baseline. There were no significant in-
teractions between sex and race/ethnicity; for
the interested reader, however, we provide
prevalence estimates for specific subgroups in
the tables available as supplements to the
online version of this article at http://www.
ajph.org. Because incarceration may restrict
access to substances, all models included
covariates for time incarcerated before each
interview. We estimated all generalized es-
timating equation models with sampling
weights to account for study design.
Missing data. Although attrition was
modest (Table A), and we augmented sam-
pling weights with nonresponse adjustments,
we used multiple imputation by chained
equations63–65 to examine the sensitivity of
our findings to unplanned missing data. We
imputed data under the assumption that
participants who dropped out had up to twice
the odds of disorder compared with partici-
pants whoremained in the study.66,67 Because
there were no substantive differences in
findings (tables available from authors), we
present results with the original data.
RESULTS
Twelve years after baseline (median
age = 28 years), more than 90% of males and
nearly 80% of females had a lifetime SUD
(Table 1). Compared with females, males had
higher lifetime prevalence of any SUD and its
subcategories alcohol-use disorder, any
drug-use disorder, and marijuana-use disor-
der. By contrast, females had higher lifetime
prevalenceofcocaine-,opiate-,amphetamine-,
and sedative-use disorder. Lifetime preva-
lence of “other” illicit drug–use disorder and
its subcategories—cocaine, opiate, amphet-
amine, and hallucinogen or PCP (males only)
—were significantly higher among non-
Hispanic Whites, followed by Hispanics, then
African Americans (Tables B and C, available
as supplements to the online version of this
article at http://www.ajph.org). Among fe-
males, minorities had lower lifetime preva-
lence of alcohol-use disorder. Sex and racial/
ethnic differences remained even when we
excluded participants who had been in-
carcerated during the entire follow-up period
(tables available from authors).

plements to the online version of this article at

lence estimates for all disorders. We describe
findings by type of disorder.
Any SUD, Alcohol-Use Disorder, and
Any Drug-Use Disorder
Although prevalence decreased, 12 years
after baseline nearly 1 in 5 participants had an
SUD and more than 1 in 10 had a drug-use
disorder. The rate of decrease depended on sex
(TableI,availableas a supplement totheonline
version of this article at http://www.ajph.org).
Sex differences. There were no significant
sex differences at baseline. After baseline,
however,maleshadhigherprevalenceofSUDs
than females (Figure A). For example, 5 years
after baseline, males had 2.34 times the odds of
alcohol-use disorder compared with females
(95% CI=1.76, 3.13). Sex differences were
largest in the first half of the follow-up period.
Racial/ethnic differences. Throughout the
follow-up period, non-Hispanic Whites were
significantly more likely than minorities to

alcohol-use disorder and any drug–use dis-
order (Table I). For example, 8 years after
baseline, nearly half of non-Hispanic Whites
had any SUD compared with about a quarter
of African Americans and nearly a third of
Hispanics (Table E). Moreover, Hispanics had
significantly higher prevalence of any SUD
and its subcategory, any drug–use disorder,
compared with African Americans.
Marijuana-Use Disorder
Prevalence of marijuana-use disorder de-
creased over time, but the rate of decrease
depended on sex (Figure E and Table I).
Sex differences. There were no significant
sex differences at baseline or 12 years later. In
the interim, however, males had significantly
higher prevalence than females. For example,
5 years after baseline, prevalence was 22.1%
among males and 13.5% among females
(adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.51; 95%
CI = 1.93, 3.26).
Racial/ethnic differences. Non-Hispanic
Whites had greater odds of marijuana-use
disorder compared with African Americans.
“Other” Illicit Drug–Use Disorder
“Other” illicit drug–use disorder includes
“harddrugs,”suchascocaine-,hallucinogenor
PCP-, opiate-, amphetamine-, sedative-, and
unspecified drug–use disorder. Overall, prev-
alence did not decrease over time, and there
were no significant sex differences (Table J,
available as a supplement to the online version
of this article at http://www.ajph.org).
Racial/ethnic differences. African Americans
had the lowest prevalence of “other” illicit
drug–use disorder, followed by Hispanics,
then non-Hispanic Whites (Tables E through
G). For example, 5 years after baseline,
prevalence was 1.7% (African Americans),
7.1% (Hispanics), and 20.0% (non-Hispanic
Whites). At this time point, non-Hispanic
Whites had more than 19 times and Hispanics
had more than 8 times the odds of “other”
illicit drug–use disorder compared with
African Americans (Table J). However, preva-
lence increased over time among African
Americans (e.g., 8 years after baseline, 2.6%;
AOR=1.16 per year; 95% CI=1.14, 1.28).
Subcategories of “Other” Illicit

more than 30 times the odds of cocaine-use

the odds of cocaine-use disorder, and more
than 7 times the odds of hallucinogen or

compared with African Americans.
Substance-Use Disorders Among
Participants in the Community
Because substance use is restricted in jails
and prisons, we examined SUDs only among
participants who had lived in the community
the entire year before their 12-year interview.
This subgroup consisted of 434 males and 480
females. The racial/ethnic distributionwas 499
African Americans, 239 Hispanics, 174 non-
HispanicWhites,and2“other”race/ethnicity.
Tables L, M, and N (available as supple-
ments to the online version of this article at
http://www.ajph.org) show prevalence es-
timates and demographic differences at time 5
(12 years after baseline) for all SUDs. Prev-
alence estimates and demographic differences
for the subgroup were substantially similar to
those for the overall sample.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study of
delinquent youths to document that SUDs
during young adulthood differ markedly by
sex, race/ethnicity, and substance abused.
Drug-use disorders such as cocaine, halluci-
nogen or PCP, opiate, amphetamine, and
sedatives were rare among African Americans,
but prevalent among non-Hispanic Whites.
Marijuana-use disorder was the most prevalent
SUD during most of young adulthood, and
more common among males than females.
However, 12 years after baseline, alcohol-use
disorder surpassed marijuana-use disorder.
Prevalence of SUDs dropped from about
50% at baseline (median age = 15 years) to
nearly 20% 12 years later (median age = 28
years) among males and females. Similar to
other delinquent behaviors, prevalence
among females declined more rapidly than
among males. This difference may be because
delinquent females are more likely than de-
linquent males to receive services,68 which
may hasten recovery. Moreover, males are

drug-use disorders such as cocaine and hal-
lucinogen or PCP was lowest among African
Americans, followed by Hispanics, then
non-Hispanic Whites. For example, non-
Hispanic Whites had more than 30 times the
odds of having cocaine-use disorder than
African Americans. These racial/ethnic dif-
ferences persisted even after we controlled for
the additional time that African Americans
spend in correctional facilities, where access to
substances is restricted. Our findings add to
the growing debate about how the “War on
Drugs” has disproportionately affected Afri-
can American youths and young adults.73–75
Recent investigations have found that al-
though African American adolescents are no
more likely than non-Hispanic Whites to use
or sell drugs, they are more likely be arrested
on drug-related charges.76,77
Lifetime SUDs were the rule, not the
exception. By median age 28 years, more than
90% of males and nearly 80% of females had 1
or more SUDs—rates substantially higher
than in the general population—irrespective
of sex or race/ethnicity. (Comparative ana-
lyses of estimates obtained from the National
Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Re-
lated Conditions [NESARC], for those aged
25–30 years, are available from the authors.)
The magnitude of difference, however, is
notable. For example, two thirds of African
American females had lifetime marijuana-use
disorder compared with less than 10% of those
in the NESARC; more than 85% of non-
HispanicWhitemaleshadlifetimemarijuana-use
disorder compared with less than one fifth
in the NESARC. A quarter of Hispanic fe-
males had ever had a hallucinogen or PCP–
use disorder compared with about 2% in the
general population.
Limitations
Our sample included participants from
only 1 jurisdiction and may not be
generalizable to other parts of the country.
We had too few participants of “other” race/
ethnicity to generalize to racial/ethnic groups
such as Asian American or Native American.
Findings do not take into account mental
health or substance abuse services. Although
recent studies find few differences in results
between DSM-IV and DSM-V criteria,78,79
prevalence estimates might have been
somewhat different had we used DSM-V. We
did not examine comorbid psychiatric dis-
orders, or the age at onset of SUD relative to
comorbid disorders. Despite these limitations,
our findings have implications for future re-
search and public health policy.
Directions for Future Research
First, investigate incarcerated persons
after release. Incarcerated populations have
among the highest lifetime prevalence of
SUDs.12,80,81 Yet nearly all large-scale epi-
demiological studies of SUDs exclude
them.16,82 Ironically, we know least about the
people who are at the greatest risk for the
consequences of SUDs. Studies of US pop-
ulations are especially needed because it has
the highest incarceration rate in the world83:
707 inmates per 100 000 residents, compared
with 118 in Canada, 148 in England and
Wales, and 470 in Russia.
Second, examine how patterns of in-
carceration affect substance abuse. Drug abuse
and involvement in the drug economy often
lead to arrest and incarceration. Incarceration
may also exacerbate risk factors for substance
abuse—for example, increasing depression,84
interrupting education,85 disrupting intimate
relationships,86,87 and increasing deviant peer
associations.88,89 Yet, to our knowledge, no
large-scale study has examined how patterns
of incarceration—number and duration of
incarcerations, age when incarcerated, and
experiences during parole and probation—
affect the development, persistence, de-
sistance, and recurrence of SUDs. Prospective
studies are essential to address these public
health concerns.
Implications for Public Policy
First, address—as a health disparity—the
disproportionate incarceration of African
Americans for drug offenses. Drug abuse
appears to have greater consequences for
racial/ethnic minorities, especially African
Americans, than for non-Hispanic Whites.
Poor people, who are disproportionately
racial/ethnic minorities, may be less able to
afford treatment and, if arrested, less able to
obtain effective legal counsel than persons of
greater means. Specialized drug courts have
the potential to divert persons to treatment,
avoiding incarceration and associated
consequences.90–92
Second, improve the breadth and quality
of preventive interventions, services during
correctional stays, and care after prisoners are
released. To date, insufficient services have
been available to treat substance abuse. For
example, about half of youths in detention93
and nearly 80%94 of adults in prison do not
receive needed treatment of drug abuse.94–96
Although prisoners continue to be ineligible
for Medicaid while serving time,97 the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act97 ex-
pands services after release: it mandates equal
coverage for SUD treatment, including it as
an “essential health benefit,”97 which must be
provided by Medicaid and the insurance
exchanges. Parity increases treatment pro-
vision for SUDs.98 Moreover, of people re-
leased from jails, 25% to 30% could enroll in
Medicaid in states that expanded Medicaid,
and about 20% could enroll in a marketplace
insurance plan.99
Despite these improvements, service
provision will continue to challenge the field
for several reasons:
1. Prisoners are dependent on services
provided by their facility.99 Evidence-
based treatment of mental disorders and
substance abuse is critical. Yet, availability
and quality of services vary.99
2. Substance use disorders are often comorbid
with other psychiatric disorders, particu-
larly among youths in the juvenile justice
system.21,49 Accurate diagnosis of comor-
bid conditions requires systematic assess-
ment of both mental health and substance
use problems.100,101 Traditional treatments
are less effective for persons with
comorbid disorders. Integrated treatment
approaches are preferable, but not widely
available.102
3. After release, residents of states that have
not expanded Medicaid (19 states as of
January 2016103) will have fewer resources
available to them as federal funding de-
clines for safety net services.104,105 Nearly

 80% of funding for SUD treatment comes
from public sources, of which Medicaid
accounts for approximately one fourth.106
4. Even in states that expanded Medicaid,
specialty outpatient services (where most
SUD treatment takes place) that accept
Medicaid are unavailable in 40% of
counties105; inpatient programs that have
more than 16 beds are not covered.107
Substance abuse is among the most serious
healthproblemsintheUnitedStates.Illicitdrug
use and excessive alcohol consumption cost
$193 billion108 and $223.5 billion per year,109
respectively, which includes costs associated
with disruptions in work, increased health
problems,andcrime. Services to treat substance
abuse—duringincarcerationandafterrelease—
would reach a sizeable proportion of people in
need,94 and address health disparities in a highly
vulnerable population.
