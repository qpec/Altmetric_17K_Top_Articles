Abstract
Background: smoking is the single most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. The evidence on independent asso-
ciations between smoking in later life and incident frailty is scarce.
Objectives: to examine the effect of current smoking in older people on the risk of developing frailty, controlling for
important confounders.
Methods: we used data of 2,542 community-dwelling older people aged ≥60 years in England. Participants were classified
as current smokers or non-smokers. Frailty was defined using modified Fried criteria. Multivariable logistic regression mod-
els were used to examine risk of 4-year incident frailty in current smokers compared with non-smokers, adjusted for demo-
graphic, socioeconomic and health variables.
Results: of 2,542 participants, 261 and 2,281 were current smokers and non-smokers, respectively. The current smokers were sig-
nificantly frailer, younger, with lower BMI, less educated, less wealthy and lonelier compared with non-smokers at baseline. In mul-
tivariable logistic regression models adjusting for age and gender, current smokers were twice as likely to develop frailty compared
with non-smokers (odds ratio (OR) = 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.39–3.39, P = 0.001). The association is attenuated
largely by controlling for socioeconomic status. Smoking remains significantly associated with incident frailty in fully adjusted mod-
els including age, gender, socioeconomic status, alcohol use, cognitive function and loneliness (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.02–2.51,
P = 0.04). The relationship is however attenuated when taking account of non-response bias through multiple imputation.
Conclusions: current smokers compared with non-smokers were significantly more likely to develop frailty over 4 years
among community-dwelling older people. Given that smoking is a modifiable lifestyle factor, smoking cessation may poten-
tially prevent or delay developing frailty, even in old age.
Keywords: frailty, smoking, community-dwelling older people, older people
Introduction
When national surveys on smoking started in the UK in
1974, 41% of women and 51% of men were smokers [1].
The overall prevalence of smoking has been declining since
then, down to 17% for women and 20% for men in 2014 [1].
Tobacco smoking is the single most preventable cause of
morbidity and mortality in the UK [2]. National Health
Service (NHS) spent £5.2 billion (approximately $7.5 billion)
in treating smoking-related health conditions in 2005/06 [3].
Smoking also increases the risk of developing a number
of other diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), coronary heart disease, stroke and periph-
eral vascular disease [4], all of which can potentially have
negative effects on the physical, psychological and social
health of smokers. Disability itself limits autonomy, increases
the risk of dependence, reduces quality of life and contributes
to mortality [5].
Frailty is considered a precursor to, but a distinct state
from, disability [6]. Frailty has been described as a condition
associated with decreased physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to adverse health outcomes with exposure to a
stressor [7]. The outcomes include falls [8], fractures [9],

 disability [10], hospitalisation [11] and institutionalisation [12].
Frailty has also been shown to be linked to worse psychological
or cognitive outcomes, such as poor quality of life [13] and
dementia [14]. Due to the potential for reversibility of
frailty [15], identifying potentially modifiable risk factors of
frailty may help to develop strategies to prevent or slow
progression of adverse health outcomes associated with
both frailty and smoking. As maintaining independence is a
key priority for older people, demonstrating links with
smoking and frailty might provide additional motivation
for older smokers to quit. A previous systematic review
showed that only a few studies have examined longitudinal
associations between smoking and risk of incident frailty [16].
Although most of these studies demonstrated that smokers
were more likely to develop frailty, they provided effect mea-
sures that were unadjusted or adjusted for a limited number
of confounders [16]. Therefore, the independent association
of smoking with incident frailty has not been convincingly
established. We thus aimed to examine the association of
smoking with the risk of developing frailty, controlling for
important confounding variables and using data from a
nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older
men and women living in England.
Methods
Study setting and population
The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) is a
multi-centre longitudinal panel study of a nationally repre-
sentative sample of community-dwelling men and women
aged 50 years and older in England and its detail has been
published elsewhere [17]. The initial participants (n =
11,391) at wave 1 in 2002 were recruited from households
that participated in the Health Survey for England (HSE).
The panel has been followed up with every 2 years. Ethical
approval for all of the ELSA waves was obtained from the
National Research and Ethics Committee and informed
consent was obtained from all participants.
The current study used data of participants who were
aged 60 years or older at wave 2 (baseline), since the gait
speed was not measured for those aged less than 60 years,
and who also participated at wave 4 (follow-up). Of 6,183
men and women aged 60 years or older who were inter-
viewed at wave 2, those who missed any data regarding
smoking status at wave 2 (n = 3) and frailty components at
wave 2 (n = 1,688) were excluded. Those who were frail at
wave 2 (n = 575) were also excluded in order to examine
the risk of incident frailty. Among 3,918 participants left,
1,376 could not participate at the follow-up wave due to ill
health (n = 44), death (n = 139), refusal (n = 547), being
unable to contact (n = 132) or other reasons (n = 514). The
final analytic sample for this study was 2,542 participants.
Predictor variable—smoking
Participants were classified as ‘current smoker’ or ‘non-smoker’
based on answers to the question ‘Do you smoke cigarettes at
all nowadays?’ during the interview at wave 2. To examine
effects of smoking cessation on frailty, the non-smokers were
divided, based on data of when they quit smoking available
from wave 3 (2 years after wave 2), into two groups: past smo-
kers and never smoker. The past smokers were further divided
into another two groups: those who quit within the last 10
years and those who quit more than 10 years ago [18].
Outcome variable—incident frailty
Frailty was defined using the frailty phenotype criteria that
Fried et al. [6] described in the Cardiovascular Health Study
(CHS). In CHS, frailty is defined using a combination of
five physical frailty components: (i) unintentional weight
loss, (ii) self-reported exhaustion, (iii) weakness, (iv) slow
walking speed and (v) low physical activity. Frailty is classi-
fied as having three or more of the five criteria. An individ-
ual who meets one or two criteria is classified as prefrail,
and an individual with no criterion is classified as robust.

criteria components, covariates and statistical analysis.
Results
Table 1 and Supplementary data, Appendix 2, are available
at Age and Ageing online. present the baseline characteristics
of the final analytic sample of 2,542 participants according
to smoking status as well as 1,376 who were excluded at
follow-up according to reasons for lost follow-up. Among
the analytic sample at baseline, 2,281 participants were non-
smokers (1,168 never smokers and 1,113 past smokers) and
261 were current smokers. Current smokers were signifi-
cantly frailer, younger, with lower BMI, less educated, less
wealthy and lonelier compared with non-smokers. There
were no significant differences in gender, alcohol use and
cognitive function between these two groups.
In the univariate logistic regression models, various fac-
tors were significantly associated with a higher risk of inci-
dent frailty over 4 years. Current smoking was associated
with an approximately 50% increased risk of developing
frailty (odds ratio (OR) = 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI)
= 1.06–2.29, P = 0.02). Other factors associated with an
increased risk of incident frailty were belonging to the older
age group, being a female, having a higher BMI, consuming
alcohol less frequently, having completed a lower level of
education, having a lower level of wealth, having a lower cog-
nitive function and having more loneliness (Table 2).
Table 3 shows the results of the multivariable logistic
regression models. In Model 1 adjusting for age and gender,
current smokers were twice as likely to develop frailty at the
time of follow-up compared with non-smokers (OR = 2.07,
95% CI = 1.34–3.19, P = 0.001). Further adjusting for alco-
hol use did not change the odds ratio drastically (OR = 2.17,
95% CI = 1.39–3.39, P = 0.001). Although adding education
and wealth for adjustment in Model 3 decreased the odds
ratio, current smoking remained a significant predictor of

 incident frailty (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.05–2.52, P = 0.03).
In Model 4, cognitive function and loneliness were further
adjusted for, which made little change in the association (OR =
1.60, 95% CI = 1.02–2.51, P = 0.04). We repeated the final
model (Model 4) with multiple imputation by chained equations,
and this attenuated the association (OR = 1.48, 95% CI =
0.97–2.28, P = 0.07).
When COPD was added to the Model 4, current smoking
was no longer a significant predictor of incident frailty and the
OR decreased by 14.4% (OR = 1.37, P = 0.19). In this mod-
el, COPD was strongly associated with incident frailty (OR =
2.58, 95% CI = 1.59–4.20, P < 0.001). These findings suggest
that current smokers are more likely to develop frailty due to
COPD, rather than smoking itself. Adding CVD or cancers to
Model 4 made little changes in the results, which suggest that
CVD and cancers are not a modulator in the associations
between current smoking and development of frailty.
In supplementary analyses, incident frailty risk for current
and past smokers compared with never smokers was calcu-
lated. Compared with never smokers, current smokers were
significantly more likely to develop frailty in Models 1 and 2,
which became non-significant in Models 3 and 4. There was
no significant association between past smoking and incident
frailty in any models. (Supplementary data, Appendix 3, are
available at Age and Ageing online.) Among 1,113 past smo-
kers, 157 quit smoking within the last 10 years and 956 quit
smoking for more than 10 years ago. Incident frailty risks of
these two groups were not significantly different to that of
non-smokers in all models (Supplementary data, Appendix 4,
are available at Age and Ageing online.).
DISCUSSION
This prospective panel study of 2,542 British community-
dwelling men and women aged 60 years or older who were
free of frailty at baseline showed that current older smokers
were 60% more likely to develop frailty than non-smokers
over 4 years, controlling for a wide range of potential con-
founders including age, gender, alcohol use, education,
wealth, cognitive function and loneliness.

 Our findings are consistent with the limited previous
longitudinal research, which has shown in the majority of
studies that smoking worsened subsequent frailty status
[19–23], except for one study [15] .
Mechanisms by which current smokers are more likely
to develop frailty are unknown, but may be multifactorial
given that tobacco smoke is a mixture of numerous kinds of
toxic chemicals and compounds and can affect every organ in
the body. Smoking has been shown to be associated with
various physical and mental illnesses [4], any of which can
contribute to the development of frailty. These health risks
can be reduced substantially by smoking cessation, according
mostly to findings from studies among middle aged adults [24].
Although scarce, the evidence supports that one is never
too old to quit smoking and older smokers can still benefit
from quitting [25]. One study showed that the risks of
myocardial infarction and stroke were reduced by 40%
within 5 years of smoking cessation in German older peo-
ple aged 50 and over [26]. Smoking cessation can poten-
tially be an effective strategy to prevent or delay developing
frailty among older smokers. This possible benefit of smok-
ing cessation is supported by our findings that past smokers
did not have higher risk of incident frailty than never smo-
kers. Evidence suggests that older people may be less moti-
vated by preventing disease such as heart attacks than
younger people [27]. However it is their priority to remain
independent, able to look after themselves and engaged
socially [28]. Therefore, knowledge that continued smoking
in later life may increase the risk of frailty, which itself is
strongly associated with increased dependency and increased
risk of moving into care home settings, may provide add-
itional motivation to encourage older smokers to quit.
In the multivariable logistic regression models, the odds
ratio of developing frailty in current smokers compared with
non-smokers decreased from 2.17 to 1.62 (−25.3%) when fur-
ther adjusted for education and wealth, which suggests that
the association between smoking and incident frailty can par-
tially be explained by socioeconomic status. Lower socio-
economic status has been shown to be associated with a
higher prevalence of smoking [3] and a higher level and faster
progression of frailty [29]. Socioeconomically disadvantaged
smokers typically are found to have developed their smoking
habit earlier in their lives, and are likely to be more nicotine
dependent, to have less social support for smoking cessation
and to be less likely to succeed in smoking cessation
attempts [30]. In order to reduce the smoking-related health
inequalities, smoking cessation measures should be effective on
these hard-core smokers with low socioeconomic status [30].
In our supplementary analysis using multiple imputation of
covariates the relationship of smoking with frailty was attenu-
ated further and becomes non-significant.
COPD, CVD and cancers were separately added to the
final multivariable logistic regression model to see if these
smoking-related diseases fully explained the association
between current smoking and incident frailty, or if there
appeared to be a further independent effect of smoking on
frailty. Only COPD changed the results significantly and cur-
rent smoking no longer predicted incident frailty in that mod-
el, which suggests that the association appears to be
explained by COPD. Finally our supplementary analysis sug-
gests that the harmful effects of smoking on frailty are largely
restricted to those who were smoking at baseline. Those who
had more recently quit (within the last 10 years) showed no
increased risk of frailty compared to never-smokers.
There are some limitations and strengths of this study.

 wave, only current smokers and non-smokers were defined.
We had to retrieve data from a later wave to create past and
never smoker groups. We had no information on the extent of
smoking exposure (quantity of cigarettes consumed or length
of exposure) and we were therefore unable to explore a ‘dose–
response’ relationship. It should be noted that the information
on smoking status was self-reported and potentially subject to
response bias. Second, our sample was restricted to those who
had completed measurements of frailty status (e.g. gait speed,
handgrip strength) in nurse interviews at two time points in
ELSA. Those who were excluded due to missing data at
follow-up were significantly frailer and more likely to be cur-
rent smokers compared with those who were included, which
suggests that those excluded were missing data that were not
random. Therefore, this exclusion is likely to attenuate an asso-
ciation between smoking status and incident frailty. Whilst we
attempted to account for attrition bias by using non-response
weights, this differential loss to follow-up may have underesti-
mated the associations between frailty and smoking. Third, the
ELSA cohort only includes the English population and may
not be generalisable to other populations. Fourth, as in other
studies, components of CHS criteria were slightly modified
according to availability of ELSA data, which may have
affected the findings [31]. Fifth, we used only two time points
4 years apart to assess incident frailty risk according to smok-
ing. Given that COPD may be an important mediator in the
association between smoking and frailty, over many years, a
study with a longer follow-up period and multiple data collec-
tion time points would be justified.
The major strengths of this analysis are a large sample
size, a prospective study design and the use of a wide range
of potential confounders for adjustment.
In conclusion, current smokers compared with non-
smokers were significantly more likely to develop frailty
over 4 years among British community-dwelling older peo-
ple. This result is in line with findings of a recent systematic
review [16]. Given that smoking is a modifiable lifestyle fac-
tor, smoking cessation may potentially prevent or delay
developing frailty, even in old age.
Key points
• The evidence on association between smoking in later life
and incident frailty is scarce.
• Community-dwelling men and women aged 60 or older
were followed up for incident frailty over 4 years.
• Current smokers compared with non-smokers were sig-
nificantly more likely to develop frailty.
• Given that smoking is a modifiable lifestyle factor, smoking
cessation may potentially prevent or delay developing frailty.

Abstract
Background: delirium is a medical emergency affecting approximately 30% of hospitalised older patients. Recent work
examining UK undergraduate medical curricula highlighted inconsistencies in the delivery of teaching on delirium. The aim
of this project was to develop consensus agreement on a delirium curriculum for medical undergraduates.
