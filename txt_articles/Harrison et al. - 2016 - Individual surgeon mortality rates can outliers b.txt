ABSTRACT
Objectives: There is controversy on the proposed
benefits of publishing mortality rates for individual
surgeons. In some procedures, analysis at the level of
an individual surgeon may lack statistical power. The
aim was to determine the likelihood that variation in
surgeon performance will be detected using published
outcome data.
Design: A national analysis surgeon-level mortality
rates to calculate the level of power for the reported
mortality rate across multiple surgical procedures.
Setting: The UK from 2010 to 2014.
Participants: Surgeons who performed colon cancer
resection, oesophagectomy or gastrectomy, elective
aortic aneurysm repair, hip replacement, bariatric
surgery or thyroidectomy.
Outcomes: The likelihood of detecting an individual
with a 30-day, 90-day or in-patient mortality rate of up
to 5 times the national mean or median (as available).
This was represented using a novel heat-map
approach.
Results: Overall mortality rates for the procedures
ranged from 0.07% to 4.5% and mean/median
surgeon volume was between 23 and 75 cases. The
national median case volume for colorectal (n=55) and
upper gastrointestinal (n=23) cancer resections
provides around 20% power to detect a mortality rate
of 3 times the national median, while, for hip
replacement, this is a rate 5 times the national average.
At the mortality rates reported for thyroid (0.08%) and
bariatric (0.07%) procedures, it is unlikely a surgeon
would perform a sufficient number of procedures in
his/her entire career to stand a good chance of
detecting a mortality rate 5 times the national average.
Conclusions: At present, surgeons with increased
mortality rates are unlikely to be detected. Performance
within an expected mortality rate range cannot be
considered reliable evidence of acceptable
performance. Alternative approaches should focus on
commonly occurring meaningful outcome measures,
with infrequent events analysed predominately at the
hospital level.
INTRODUCTION
Ensuring the highest quality of care from
individuals working in health services is a
priority worldwide. A desire to identify and
learn from best practice is accompanied by a
requirement to detect performance that falls
below expectation. There has been debate
within a number of countries and surgical
specialties on the pros and cons of making
public the results of individual surgeons,1
with a particular focus on mortality rates.
In June 2013, the National Health Service
in England published for the first time mor-
tality rates for individual surgeons. It was
described as a major breakthrough in trans-
parency that could help drive up standards.2
Concerns were raised including whether sur-
geons performed particular procedures fre-
quently enough to enable those with an
excess mortality to be reliably identified. A
study at the time used hospital episode statis-
tics to estimate individual surgeon volume
and
concluded
that
public
reporting
of
surgeon outcomes could lead to false com-
placency among the public and surgical com-
munity.3 Furthermore, controversy exists at
least in cardiac surgery on the extent to
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This national analysis of individual surgeon mor-
tality
rates
identified
that
surgeons
with
increased mortality rates are unlikely to be
detected.
▪ Stratification of procedures by risk-identified sur-
geons undertaking operations with low mortality
risks would be unlikely to perform enough pro-
cedures
in
their
lifetime
to
detect
poor
performance.
▪ Alternative measures of outcomes such as func-
tional health status or patient satisfaction may be
more suitable, detect poor performance earlier
and have greater power to detect outlying sur-
geons or units.
▪ Future research and policymakers should con-
sider implementing alternative measures along-
side mortality rates that are reported at the
surgeon and unit level.

 which the operating surgeon can modify the risk of
death for an individual patient.4
Despite concerns about the use of mortality as a
marker of individual surgeon performance,5 it continues
to be used.6 Acceptable performance exists within an
expected range, which can be defined indifferent ways.7
It is common to compare an individual surgeon’s per-
formance with that of population and consider a mortal-
ity rate of >2 SDs from national mean/median to
indicate divergent practice. This definition shows that
there is an expected false-positive rate of 5%. For
example, a surgeon with a mortality rate equal to that of
the national mean or median has a 2.5% chance of
falling above the 95% control limit for acceptable per-
formance by sampling error alone.
The chances of detecting a surgeon with a mortality
rate that is actually worse than the national average is a
question of statistical power. As caseload increases, so
does the power to detect divergent practice. In this
context, the statistical power can be considered the like-
lihood of detecting an individual surgeon with a mortal-
ity rate in excess of the national average: a power of
100% would detect every surgeon with a mortality rate
in excess of the national mean/median, while 50%
power would detect half of these surgeons.
The aim of this study was to examine the available
mortality data for individual surgeons and to determine
the likelihood that variation in surgeon performance
will be detected.
METHODS
Data
National mean or median mortality rates, together with
case volume data for the UK surgeons, were retrieved
for six procedures on 1 June 2015.8 The mean or the
median mortality rate was used as reported in the data.
The primary outcome of 30-day, 90-day or in-patient
mortality was used as available. The following proce-
dures
were
included
and
outcomes
were
available
follows: colon cancer resection (90-day mortality), upper
gastrointestinal (GI) cancer resection (30-day and 90-day
mortality), elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair
(30-day mortality), hip replacement surgery (90-day mor-
tality), bariatric surgery (in-hospital mortality) and thyr-
oidectomy (in-hospital mortality). The available data
covered procedures that were performed from 2010 to
2014.
Analysis
Mortality and procedural case volume data reported for
surgeons were characterised. Data across all available
years (2010–2014) were aggregated for each procedure
and mapped using a heat-map approach. This heat-map
was used to show the likelihood of detecting an individ-
ual surgeon with a mortality rate of two, three, four and
five times the national mean/median, that is, the pro-
portion above an exact 95% binomial control limit
determined using the Wilson method.9 The mean/
median case volume and range for surgeons reported in
national data are superimposed on to the plots. The pro-
portion of individuals above the 95% control limit was
represented in blue, with darker colour indicating a
higher proportion. In other words, the colour represents
the statistical power of detecting a mortality rate 2–5
times the average. The black vertical lines represent the
mean or median average mortality rate (dependent on
the measure reported in the accessed data). The red verti-
cal lines represent the minimum and maximum number
of cases performed for the given data set, with the x-axis
indicating the number of procedures per surgeon.
Data were analysed using R V.3.2.1 (R Foundation for
Statistical
Computing,
Austria)
using
the
packages
‘binom’ and ‘ggplot2’.
RESULTS
Reported data
There was variation in the outcome measures reported
across outcome data. For upper GI cancer resection,
30-day and 90-day mortality were reported. Whereas, for
other procedures, only 30-day, 90-day or in-patient mor-
tality were published. Different measures of central ten-
dency were reported for case volume and mortality rate,
with some audits reporting the mean average and others
reporting the median.
Mortality rates and procedure volume
The higher risk procedures included upper GI cancer
resection, colorectal cancer resection and elective aortic
aneurysm repair (mortality rate 2.2–4.5%, table 1).
Lower risk procedures were bariatric surgery, thyroidect-
omy and hip replacement (mortality rate 0.07–0.4%,
table 1). The national average surgeon volume for the
six procedures was between 23 and 75 cases.
Higher risk procedures
In published outcomes for colorectal cancer resection,
the median number of procedures submitted by individ-
ual surgeons for the 3-year period analysed was 55
(range 3–237; figure 1). With a median national 90-day
mortality rate of 3.0%, the national median of 55 cases
provides around 20% power to detect a mortality rate
three times the national median. Put another way, for
this 3-year period, around 20 out of 100 individuals with
an actual mortality rate of 9% would appear above a
95% control limit. The case volume per surgeon over
3-years would have to be over 200 procedures to have
90% power of detecting a surgeon with a 90-day mortal-
ity rate three times the national median.
Similar findings were seen for upper GI cancer resec-
tion, where the median number of procedures submitted
by individual surgeons over a 2-year period was 23 (range
10–81) (figure 1). With a median national 30-day mortality
rate of 2.4%, the cases submitted provided <20% power to
detect a surgeon with a mortality rate four times the

The heat-map shows the likelihood of detecting an individual surgeon with a mortality rate in excess of the national mean/median
(ie, the proportion above an exact 95% control limit (Wilson method) on a funnel plot). The rate of the mortality measure above
the national mean/median on the y-axis is plotted against case volume on the x-axis. The mean or median case volume (black
line) and range (red lines) of surgeons reported in these national data are also shown. For example, with colonic resection, the
national median caseload of 55 provides only around 20% power to detect a mortality rate three times the national median. Two
hundred cases provide >90% power. Owing to the discrete nature of these data, as expected, the gradient from left to right is not
always smooth.

 national median. Likewise, a 90-day mortality rate three
times the national median can only be detected with a
power of <20%. A 2-year case volume of 300 cases would
be required to have 80% power to detect a 90-day mortality
rate two times higher than the national median.
Lower risk procedures
For hip replacement, bariatric procedures and thyroidect-
omy, at the national mean or median case volumes submit-
ted (48–75 cases per surgeon, range 1–529) fewer than 20
of 100 individuals with an actual mortality rate five times
the national average would be detected. For hip replace-
ment, an annual case volume in excess of 500 cases would
be required to have 80% power to detect an individual
with a mortality rate five times the national average
(0.4%). For thyroidectomy and bariatric procedures, the
reported national mortality rates are even lower (0.07%
and 0.08%). At these rates, it is unlikely that a surgeon
would perform a sufficient number of procedures in his/
her entire career to stand a good chance of detecting a
mortality rate five times the national average.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study of which we are aware to analyse
the utility of national individual surgeon mortality rates.
On the basis of these rates and published case volumes,
surgeons with mortality rates in excess of that expected
are highly unlikely to be detected. Performance within
an expected mortality rate range cannot therefore be
considered a reliable evidence of acceptable perform-
ance. Robust interpretation of performance data for
individual surgeons clearly has important implications
for patient care. In the UK, the National Clinical Audit
Advisory Group has produced guidance on the detec-
tion and management of performance outliers identi-
fied through national clinical audit.7 When a healthcare
provider is detected as a potential performance outlier,
an escalating confirmatory process is embarked on
which may quickly result in the suspension of a service
or individual. This analysis demonstrates that, for these
common procedures, mortality rates are not a robust
method for detecting divergent practice. It is not surpris-
ing that the performance of all but one surgeon across
all six procedures was found to be acceptable.
This study has several limitations that must be consid-
ered. Data reporting standards for individual surgeon
mortality rates varied across different specialties, with
some presenting the median and some the mean
average. Further variability in the outcome measures
reported (30-day, 90-day or in-patient mortality) made it
difficult to use a uniform approach across all data sets.

 In future, surgeon-level surgical mortality should be stan-
dardised to consider 90-day outcomes as a sensitive
measure of mortality. We addressed this by analysing
each procedure individually and ensuring the relevant
measures of central tendency were clearly specified for
each procedure. A further strength of this study is the
national population of surgeons included, thus reducing
the risk of selection or attrition bias from unobserved
outcomes.
The recent push for the publication of individual
surgeon outcomes underpins a specific public interest
in safer surgery. Surgeons broadly support greater
transparency in the publication of outcome data, but
these data should be meaningful and accompanied by
appropriate
presentation
and
interpretation.
An
example of the difficulties in delivering this is the
recent publication of complication rates for 17 000 US
surgeons.10 ProPublica, an independent, non-profit
investigative journalism organisation, used Medicare
data to perform the largest public analysis of surgeon-
level complications rates. Although initiatives of this
type may be welcomed, the analysis and presentation
of the data has been criticised and described as mis-
leading.11 In particular, the number of cases available
per surgeon is low and the power of any analysis at the
individual level limited. Concerns have previously been
raised about using mortality in this manner,5 and as
has been shown in the current analysis, when case
volumes are low and outcomes are infrequent, it is not
possible to perform a meaningful analysis at the indi-
vidual surgeon level.
One obvious solution to better estimate individual out-
comes is to increase the case volume considered. Case
ascertainment in an national audit is important but not
always well defined. Average case volumes analysed in
the present study are lower than the predicted by
hospital episode statistics. It has long been debated
the extent to which minimum volume standards should
be set for surgeons performing a given procedure.
Volume–outcome relationships are well described for
many procedures and while efforts have been made to
concentrate specialist surgical expertise, policymakers
have stopped short at enforcing volume targets. Three
leading
hospital
systems
in
the
USA—Dartmouth-
Hitchcock Medical Center, Johns Hopkins Medicine and
the University of Michigan—have recently sought to
introduce minimum volume standards for 10 surgical
procedures.12 Yet even the minimum numbers suggested
here would be insufficient to make mortality rates a
useful marker of individual outcome, for example, pan-
creas resection, 5 per year; hip replacement, 25 per year.
In future, the measurement of mortality may become an
increasingly
poor
means
of
discriminating
surgeon
performance if postoperative death rates continue a
downward trend.13 14
Our analysis would strongly suggest an alternative ap-
proach, focus measurement on commonly occurring mean-
ingful outcomes, analyse infrequent events predominately
at the hospital level and use prospective continuous
methods rather than retrospective snapshots. The more
frequently an outcome measure occurs, the greater its
utility in differentiating better care. An outcome is only
meaningful if it directly measures or acts as a surrogate
for factors explicitly relevant to a patient. Specific
patient-centred outcomes—such as patient satisfaction,
functional
health
status
or
other
measures
of
health-related quality of life—are ideal yet far from
routine; we are not aware of any comprehensive system
reporting at the level of the individual surgeon. The
appropriateness of more traditional measure depends
on
the
balance
between
baseline
risk
and
case
volume.15 Measures of structure (eg, volume), process
(eg, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, antibiotic
prophylaxis or nutritional support) or direct outcomes
(eg, well-defined complication rates or readmission
rates) can be useful when deployed for the appropriate
procedure.
When
measuring
these
wide-ranging
outcomes,
caution must be exercised when performing an analysis
at the level of an individual practitioner. It is the per-
formance of the healthcare system as a whole that is
likely to affect, for instance, overall patient satisfaction
rather than that only of the surgeon. Undoubtedly, for
less frequently performed surgical procedures, analysis
at the level of the hospital will be more meaningful—it
has even been suggested that for procedures of low risk
or caseload, efforts would be better targeted on the
measurement of other procedures.15
Future research and policymakers should focus on
implementing measures that can detect deterioration in
performance in a sensitive manner, to enable early
detection and accurate discrimination
between sur-
geons, units or hospitals. If the performance of a hos-
pital begins to deviate over time, an early in-depth
review may identify modifiable causes. It may be difficult
to identify a poorly performing individual if he/she is
compensated for by colleagues, but this may be better
addressed by regular internal appraisal and multisource
feedback. Assessing performance retrospectively may
lead
to
delays
in
identifying
divergent
practice.
Continuous monitoring of outcomes from consecutive
cases has instinctive appeal and practical advantages.
Graphical measures such as the variable life-adjusted
display (VLAD) (or expected-observed cumulative sum
(CuSum) plot) were established to display differences
between observed and expected mortality in cardiac
surgery.16 This continuous approach is, however, at the
expense of more frequent reviews of surgeons perform-
ing in the expected range, but such reflective practice
should be encouraged and become a more common
part of everyday practice. It may be instructive to con-
sider how often surgeons performing well should expect
to trigger a false positive. For surgeons performing
below expectation, these early alerts will potentially
improve patient safety when attention or reskilling may
lead to improvement.17
