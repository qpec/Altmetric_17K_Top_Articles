Introduction
Therapeutic blockade of programmed death–ligand 1 (PD-L1, 
B7-H1) or programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) with mAbs leads to 
durable tumor control in a minority of patients across many cancer 
histologies (1, 2). Clinical response to PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade 
has been associated with increased PD-L1 expression in the tumor 
tissues, the presence of tumor-infiltrating T cells, and tumor muta-
tional load (1–9). There remains a lack of mechanistic, prognostic, 
and predictive biomarkers that adequately identify which patients 
will most benefit from the PD-L1 and PD-1 axis blockade. To dis-
sect the molecular and cellular mechanisms that account for the 
clinical efficacy of PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade (1, 2), we used mice 
with varying immune repertoires, including Rag1tm1Mom (Rag1–/–), 
NOD.SCID γc–deficient (NSG), PD-L1 genetically deficient (PD-
L1–/–), and PD-1 genetically deficient (PD-1–/–) mice for studying 
PD-L1 and PD-1 signaling blockade in MC38, ID8, B16-F10, and 
LLC tumor models. Tumor transplantation into Rag1–/–, NSG, 
PD-L1–/–, and PD-1–/– mice abrogated the therapeutic efficacy of 
anti–PD-L1 or anti–PD-1 mAb treatment. Moreover, we demon-
strate the importance of PD-L1 expression on antigen presenting 
cells (APCs), particularly dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages 
in the tumor microenvironment and draining lymph nodes, in 
PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade efficacy in multiple tumor-bearing 
mouse models and patients with melanoma and ovarian cancer. 
Thus, the host immune system is indispensable for PD-L1 and 
PD-1 blockade therapy, and the host DCs and macrophages, rather 
than cancer cell–intrinsic PD-L1, may mechanistically account for 
potential therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 signaling blockade.
Results
Host immunity determines anti–PD-L1–induced tumor immunity. To 
determine whether host immunity plays a role in the efficacy of 
anti–PD-L1 therapy, we inoculated MC38 colon cancer, ID8 ovari-
an cancer, B16-F10 melanoma, and LLC lung cancer cells into WT 
(Figure 1, A–F), NSG (Figure 1, G–I), and Rag1–/– mice (Figure 1, 
J–L) and treated these mice with anti–PD-L1 mAb. PD-L1 block-
ade reduced tumor volume in WT mice bearing MC38, ID8, and 
B16-F10 (Figure 1, A–C) and improved mouse survival (Figure 1, 
D–F). Interestingly, WT mice bearing different tumors variably 
responded to anti–PD-L1 mAb treatment. The therapeutic efficacy 
was gradually less in the order of MC38, ID8, and B16-F10 (Figure 
1, A–C), whereas anti–PD-L1 had no effect on LLC tumor in WT 
mice (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available 
online with this article; https:/
/doi.org/10.1172/JCI96113DS1). 
As expected, the antitumor effect of anti–PD-L1 was abolished in 
NSG mice (Figure 1, G–I). As innate and adaptive immunity is defi-
cient in NSG mice and innate immune cells remain functional in 
Rag1–/– mice, we examined the effect of anti–PD-L1 in Rag1–/– mice 
Programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1, B7-H1) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway blockade is a promising 
therapy for treating cancer. However, the mechanistic contribution of host and tumor PD-L1 and PD-1 signaling to the 
therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade remains elusive. Here, we evaluated 3 tumor-bearing mouse models 
that differ in their sensitivity to PD-L1 blockade and demonstrated a loss of therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 blockade in 
immunodeficient mice and in PD-L1– and PD-1–deficient mice. In contrast, neither knockout nor overexpression of PD-L1 
in tumor cells had an effect on PD-L1 blockade efficacy. Human and murine studies showed high levels of functional PD-L1 
expression in dendritic cells and macrophages in the tumor microenvironments and draining lymph nodes. Additionally, 
expression of PD-L1 on dendritic cells and macrophages in ovarian cancer and melanoma patients correlated with the efficacy 
of treatment with either anti–PD-1 alone or in combination with anti–CTLA-4. Thus, PD-L1–expressing dendritic cells and 
macrophages may mechanistically shape and therapeutically predict clinical efficacy of PD-L1/PD-1 blockade.

pensable for the therapeutic efficacy of anti–PD-L1 treatment 
(Figure 1), we next examined the role of host PD-L1 and PD-1 in 
anti–PD-L1–induced tumor immunity. To this end, we treated 
MC38-, ID8-, and B16-F10–bearing PD-L1–/– and PD-1–/– mice 
with anti–PD-L1 mAb. We found that the therapeutic effect 
of anti–PD-L1 mAb was abolished in PD-L1–/– (Figure 2, A–C) 
and PD-1–/– mice (Figure 2, D–F). Similar experiments were 
performed with anti–PD-1 treatment. Anti–PD-1 treatment 
reduced MC38 tumor growth in WT mice (Figure 2G), but not 
(Figure 1, J–L). Again, anti–PD-L1 treatment had no antitumor 
effect in Rag1–/– mice (Figure 1, J–L). Similarly to what occurred 
in WT mice, anti–PD-L1 had no effect on LLC tumor in NSG and 
Rag1–/– mice (Supplemental Figure 1, B and C). The data indicate 
that the therapeutic efficacy of anti–PD-L1 treatment requires an 
intact adaptive immune system and suggest that the magnitude of 
the effect varies between tumor histologies.

reduced ID8 tumor growth in PD-L1–/– and PD-1–/– mice (Sup-
plemental Figure 2B). Thus, host PD-L1 and PD-1 and the host

anti–PD-L1 treatment also increased IFN-γ+ and TNF-α+ T cells in 
ID8 TDLNs (Figure 3, F and G) and ID8 tumor ascites (Figure 3, 
H–J). Anti–PD-L1 treatment had no antitumor effect in PD-L1–/– 
(Figure 2, A–C) and PD-1–/– (Figure 2, D–F) mice. Consistent with 
this, anti–PD-L1 therapy did not affect T cell effector cytokine 
expression in MC38 TDLNs (Supplemental Figure 3, A and B), 
MC38 tumor tissues (Supplemental Figure 3, C–E), and ID8 tumor 
ascites (Supplemental Figure 3, F and G) in tumor-bearing PD-L1–/– 
and PD-1–/– mice. In addition, we observed spontaneous tumor 
regression in PD-L1–/– and PD-1–/– mice bearing MC38 (Figure 2, A 
and D), not ID8 (Figure 2, B and E), and B16-F10 (Figure 2, C and 
F). In line with this, there were comparable levels of tumor T cell 
infiltration in ID8 and B16-F10 tumor–bearing PD-L1–/– mice and 
WT mice, whereas higher levels of tumor T cell infiltration and 
cytokine production were found in MC38-bearing PD-L1–/– mice 
compared with WT mice (Supplemental Figure 3, H–K). Thus, in 
addition to differential tumor cell immunogenicity among MC38, 
ID8, and B16-F10, T cell activation status in PD-L1–/– mice may 
potentially explain why MC38 could spontaneously regress in 
PD-L1–/– mice. Nonetheless, the data indicate that the therapeutic 
efficacy of anti–PD-L1 treatment is associated with potent T cell 
immunity in tumor and TDLNs and depends on intact host PD-L1– 
and PD-1–signaling pathways.
APCs express high levels of functional PD-L1. After we demon-
strated the importance of host PD-L1 in anti–PD-L1–mediated anti-
tumor immunity (Figure 2), we next analyzed PD-L1 expression 
and function in host immune cell subsets in vivo in tumor-bear-
ing mice. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that 20%–40% 
CD45+ immune cells expressed PD-L1 in MC38 tumor tissues and 
We next examined the potential involvement of tumor cell 
PD-L1 in anti–PD-L1 therapy. PD-L1–deficient (PD-L1–/–) MC38, 
ID8, and B16-F10 tumor cells were made using the Crisp-Cas9 
system. WT, but not PD-L1–/– MC38, ID8, and B16-F10 cells effi-
ciently expressed PD-L1 in response to IFN-γ (Supplemental Fig-
ure 2, C–E). WT and PD-L1–/– tumor cells exhibited similar growth 
kinetics in NSG and Rag1–/– mice (Supplemental Figure 2, F–I). 
We next inoculated these cells into WT mice and treated these 
mice with anti–PD-L1 mAb. Anti–PD-L1 treatment reduced tumor 
growth in mice bearing PD-L1–/– MC38 (Figure 2J), ID8 (Figure 
2K), and B16-F10 (Figure 2L) tumor cells and increased mouse 
survival (Figure 2, M–O). Notably, we detected no PD-L1 expres-
sion in PD-L1–/– MC38 cells in vivo (Supplemental Figure 2J). Fur-
thermore, we ectopically expressed PD-L1 in MC38 (Supplemen-
tal Figure 2K), inoculated these tumor cells into PD-L1–/– mice, and 
treated these mice with anti–PD-L1 mAb. Anti–PD-L1 treatment 
had no effect on tumor growth in mice bearing ectopic PD-L1–
expressing MC38 (Supplemental Figure 2L). Thus, host but not 
tumor PD-L1 expression is indispensable for the therapeutic effi-
cacy of anti–PD-L1 treatment.
Anti–PD-L1 treatment activates T cells in tumor and draining 
lymph nodes. Given that anti–PD-L1 treatment induced an antitu-
mor effect in vivo in tumor-bearing WT mice, we studied T cell 
tumor immunity in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN) and the 
tumor microenvironment in mice treated with anti–PD-L1 thera-
py. We found that in MC38-bearing WT mice, anti–PD-L1 therapy 
induced potent IFN-γ+ and IL-2+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in TDLNs 
(Figure 3, A and B) and increased IFN-γ+ and TNF-α+ T cells in 
MC38 tumor tissues (Figure 3, C–E). In line with the MC38 model,

ID8 tumor ascites (Supplemental Figure 4A). We further divided 
CD45+ immune cells into macrophages, myeloid-derived suppres-
sor cells (MDSCs), DCs, and CD45+CD90+ lymphocytes (Sup-
plemental Figure 4B). We found high levels of PD-L1 expression 
on MC38 and ID8 tumor–associated macrophages, MDSCs, and 
DCs, but not on CD45+CD90+ lymphocytes (Supplemental Figure 
4C and Figure 4A). DCs expressed the highest levels of PD-L1 in 
MC38 and ID8 tumor tissues (Supplemental Figure 4C and Figure 
4A). As a negative control, no immune cells expressed PD-L1 in 
MC38-bearing PD-L1–/– mice (Supplemental Figure 4C). High lev-
els of PD-L1 expression were also found in macrophages, MDSCs, 
and DCs in TDLNs in MC38 and ID8 tumor–bearing mice, but 
not in healthy mice (Figure 4B). Notably, although the antitumor 
effect of anti–PD-L1 therapy depends on host PD-L1 (Figure 2), 
PD-L1 expression was detected in MC38, ID8, B16-F10, and LLC 
tumor cells in vivo in WT and PD-L1–/– mice (Supplemental Figure 
4D). Thus, tumor-associated APCs are the major PD-L1+ immune 
cells and are the major immune targets of anti–PD-L1 therapy.
To further solidify the role of host PD-L1 and PD-1 in PD-L1 
blockade–mediated T cell immunity, we activated total WT, 
PD-L1–/–, and PD-1–/– splenocytes in the presence of anti–PD-L1. 
PD-L1 blockade increased T cell IFN-γ (Figure 4, C and D) and 
TNF-α (Figure 4E) expression in WT T cells, but not in PD-L1–/– or 
PD-1–/– T cells (Figure 4, C–E). As DCs expressed the highest lev-
els of PD-L1 in tumor-bearing mice, we activated WT and PD-1–/– 
T cells with sorted WT and PD-L1–/– DCs from MC38 tumor–bear-
ing mice in the presence of anti–PD-L1. Anti–PD-L1 enhanced T 
cell effector cytokine expression in WT DC and WT T cell culture, 
but not in PD-L1–/– DC and/or PD-1–/– T cell culture (Figure 4F). To 
define the role of PD-L1 on APCs in vivo, we transferred PD-L1+/+ 
and PD-L1–/– DCs and macrophages into MC38 or ID8 tumor–
bearing PD-L1–/– mice and treated these mice with anti–PD-L1 
mAb. We detected the transferred APCs in the tumor microen-
vironments (Supplemental Figure 4E). Transfusion of PD-L1+/+ 
DCs and macrophages, but not PD-L1–/– DCs and macrophages, 
enabled antitumor effects of anti–PD-L1 therapy, as shown by 
reduced tumor growth (Figure 4, G–I), and increased effector 
cytokine–expressing T cells (Figure 4J) in PD-L1–/– mice bearing 
MC38 and ID8 models. Furthermore, when we directly compared 
tumor growth in PD-L1–/– mice with or without PD-L1–proficient 
(WT) DC transfusion, we observed that transfer of WT DCs 
caused an increase in tumor growth and that anti–PD-L1 therapy 
abolished this effect (Supplemental Figure 4F). The data provide 
additional support for an immunosuppressive role of PD-L1–pro-
ficient APCs. Next, we tested the role of human APC and tumor 
cell PD-L1 in T cell activation in vitro. We activated and cultured 
human peripheral blood T cells with DCs, macrophages, and radi-
ated ovarian cancer cells in the presence of antihuman PD-L1. As 
expected, DCs and macrophages, but not tumor cells, efficiently 
activated T cells, as shown by high levels of T cell IL-2 expression. 
Anti–PD-L1 treatment enhanced T cell IL-2 production induced 
by DCs and macrophages, but not by tumor cells (Figure 4, K and 
L). Thus, the data suggest that anti–PD-L1 may target APCs to 
enhance antitumor immunity.
PD-L1+ APCs correlate with clinical efficacy of PD-L1 and PD-1 
blockade. To determine the relevance to clinical care, we examined 
a cohort of locally advanced and metastatic melanoma patients 
treated with PD-1 and CTLA4 checkpoint blockade (Supplemen-
tal Table 1). Using multicolor immunofluorescence staining, the 
distribution of PD-L1 expression in tumor and nontumor cells on 
pretreatment melanoma biopsies was determined. Three patterns 
of expression emerged: (a) 4% of patients had no expression of 
PD-L1 on tumor or nontumor cells; (b) 73% of patients had PD-L1 
expression restricted to nontumor cells; and (c) 23% of patients had 
PD-L1 expression on both tumor and nontumor cells (Figure 5A and 
Supplemental Figure 5A). We quantified PD-L1 expression levels 
and obtained a positive correlation between the nontumor PD-L1 
expression score and complete clinical responses to dual immune 
checkpoint therapy (Figure 5B). Phenotypic analysis showed that 
DCs and macrophages were the major PD-L1+ nontumor cells (Fig-
ure 5, C and D). The percentage of PD-L1+ DCs and PD-L1+ mac-
rophages positively correlated with complete clinical responses to 
treatment (Figure 5, C and D). We analyzed melanoma metastatic 
lymph nodes and again found that APCs (DCs and macrophages) 
were the major PD-L1+ cells. PD-L1+ APCs colocalized with PD-1+ 
T cells in lymph nodes (Figure 5E). We conducted similar studies 
in ovarian cancer patients treated with PD-1 blockade (Supple-
mental Table 2). Interestingly, ovarian cancer cells demonstrated 
detectable PD-L1 in 35% of patients we examined (Supplemental 
Table 2 and Supplemental Figure 5B). PD-L1+ DCs, macrophages, 
and tumor cells were observed in the ovarian cancer microenviron-
ment (Figure 6, A and B). We again quantified PD-L1 expression 
levels and found a positive correlation between nontumor PD-L1 
expression score and general clinical responses to PD-1 blockade 
(Figure 6C). Furthermore, the percentages of PD-L1+ DCs and 
PD-L1+ macrophages positively correlated with general clinical 
responses to PD-1 blockade in ovarian cancer patients (Figure 6D). 
However, ovarian cancer patients have relatively unsatisfactory 
clinical response to PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade (UMIN000005714) 
(10). We were not able to further statistically evaluate the relation-
ship between PD-L1+ APCs and complete clinical responses due to 
insufficient cases of ovarian cancer patients with complete clinical 
response (Supplemental Table 2). Together, these data suggest that 
PD-L1+ APCs may correlate with clinical efficacy of PD-1 blockade 
in melanoma and ovarian cancer patients.
Discussion
In this work, we have elucidated insight into the cellular media-
tors involved in the PD-L1 and PD-1 signaling pathway. First, we 
stress the essential role of host adaptive immunity in mediating 
the effects of PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade. Preclinical and clinical 
correlative studies have demonstrated that PD-L1 and PD-1 path-
way blockade is associated with B7 costimulation (11) and efficient 
T cell infiltration into tumor (12–15). However, this pathway block-
ade may also directly target tumor cells and the therapeutic effi-
cacy may not solely depend on the host immune system (16). As 
the antitumor effect of anti–PD-L1 is abolished in Rag1–/– and NSG 
mice bearing multiple tumors, we conclude that the host adaptive 
immune system is essential for PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade–mediat-
ed antitumor immunity.
Second, this research highlights that antitumor effects of Abs to 
PD-L1 and PD-1 are mutually dependent on host PD-1 and PD-L1. 
Both PD-1 and PD-L1 have other binding partners, and thus PD-L1 
and PD-1 blockade may not be biologically and clinically identical

sion, whereas anti–PD-L1 mAb remains therapeutically effective 
in mice bearing PD-L1–/– tumors and PD-L1+/+ APC transfer enables 
the therapeutic effect of anti–PD-L1 mAb in PD-L1–/– mice. In line 
with early cancer patient studies (26–29), PD-L1 is expressed on 
APCs in TDLNs and the tumor microenvironment and PD-L1+/+ 
APCs inhibit T cell activation in a PD-L1– and PD-1–depen-
dent manner. Notably, we have observed spontaneous tumor 
regression and reduced tumor growth in PD-L1–/– and PD-1–/– 
mice bearing MC38 and ID8 tumors, respectively. This phenome-
non is associated with enhanced T cell activation in PD-L1–/– and 
PD-1–/– mice as compared with WT mice. In addition, differential 
tumor cell numbers and tumor immunogenicity may potentially 
be involved in determining different levels of tumor outcomes in 
the MC38-bearing mouse model (30, 31). Thus far, clinical studies 
with the PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade have not rigorously examined 
or specifically quantified PD-L1 expression on APC subsets ver-
sus tumor cells in TDLNs and tumor tissues in cancer patients (2). 
Our data suggest that PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade not only targets 
the T cell effector phase in the tumor microenvironment, but also 
(17, 18). Despite this, Abs against PD-1 and PD-L1 appear to have 
comparable clinical efficacy and toxicity (2). As our preclinical data 
showed that PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade efficacies are abolished in 
both PD-1–/– and PD-L1–/– mice, the PD-1 and PD-L1 axis may be the 
major therapeutic signaling target in cancer patients.
Finally, these studies suggest an essential role of the host PD-L1 
and PD-1 pathway in PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade therapy. Many 
correlative studies have linked tumor tissue PD-L1 expression 
(including PD-L1 expression in all types of cells) with improved 
response rate to PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade in patients with cancers 
(19–24). However, whether tumor cell–intrinsic PD-L1 expression 
or the host PD-L1 and PD-1 signaling accounts for this effect has 
been unclear. Furthermore, cancer patients with PD-L1–negative 
tumors can respond to PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade (2, 21, 22, 25). 
Across multiple cancer types, responses to anti–PD-L1 therapy are 
frequent in patients with high PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrat-
ing immune cells in the course of tumor regression (14, 15, 23). We 
show that PD-L1 blockade fails to induce antitumor immunity in 
PD-L1–/– mice bearing tumor cells with high tumor PD-L1 expres-

flank of male mice. Tumor diameters were measured using calipers. 
Tumor volume was calculated. For the ID8 tumor model, lucifer-
ase-expressing ID8 cells were injected into the peritoneal cavity of 
female mice. Tumor progression was monitored 2 to 3 times per week 
using the Xenogen IVIS Spectrum In Vivo Bioluminescence Imaging 
System (PerkinElmer). Tumor load was calculated based on the total 
flux (photons per second [p/s]). Anti–PD-L1, IgG1 isotype Ab, anti–
PD-1, or IgG2a isotype Ab (MedImmune) were given intraperitoneally 
at a dose of 100 μg per mouse on day 3 after tumor cell inoculation, 
then every 3 days for the duration of the experiment.
Ex vivo and in vitro mouse and human studies. Tumor-bearing mice 
were treated with anti–PD-L1, anti–PD-1, and isotype control. Sin-
gle-cell suspensions were prepared from fresh TDLNs and tumor tis-
sues from these treated mice. Ex vivo T cell effector cytokines were 
determined by intracellular staining and analyzed by flow cytometry 
analysis. In some cases, WT, PD-1–/–, or PD-L1–/– splenocytes (106/ml) 
were activated with anti-CD3 (8 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (4 μg/ml) in the 
presence of anti–PD-L1 (10 μg/ml) or isotype control (10 μg/ml) for 5 
days. The cells were subject to surface marker and intracellular cytokine 
staining and analyzed by flow cytometry analysis. Similar experiments 
were conducted with isolated and sorted CD11c+ DCs and CD3+ T cells.
Human DCs and macrophages were generated from peripheral 
blood monocytes with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF and 5 ng/ml IL-4 (R&D Sys-
tems) and 10 ng/ml M-CSF, respectively (40). Human peripheral blood 
T cells were stimulated for 5 days with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the 
presence of IFN-γ–activated DCs, macrophages, or fixed primary ovar-
ian cancer cells (41, 42). Antihuman PD-L1 and isotype controls were 
added at the beginning of culture (26). The cells were subject to sur-
face-marker and intracellular cytokine staining and analyzed by flow 
cytometry analysis.
CRISPR gene targeting. Gene targeting by CRISPR/Cas9 was 
accomplished by transfection of Cas9 plasmid pSpCas9(BB)-Puro 
(Addgene, catalog 62988) with the guide sequence and with the puro-
mycin selection marker. Successful PD-L1 targeting was determined 
by sequencing the cell clones and flow cytometry screening of clones 
treated with and without 10 ng/ml IFN-γ (PeproTech) for PD-L1 expres-
sion. Multiple PD-L1–deficient clones were pooled. Cell clones trans-
fected with Cas9 plasmid carrying scramble guide sequence were also 
pooled as controls. Guide RNA sequences for targeting of PD-L1 were 
as follows: 5′-GTATGGCAGCAACGTCACGA-3′; 5′-GGCTCCAAAG-
GACTTGTACG-3′; 5′-GACTTGTACGTGGTGGAGTA-3′. Guide RNA 
sequence for scramble targeting was 5′-GCACTACCAGAGCTAACT-
CA-3′ (Origene Technologies).
Flow cytometry analysis. Single-cell suspensions were prepared 
from fresh mouse tumor tissues or TDLNs. Cells were stained with 
specific Abs against mouse CD45 (30-F11), CD90 (53-2.1), CD4 
(RM4-5), CD8 (53-6.7), CD11c (HL3), CD11b (M1/70), and Gr-1 (RB6-
8C5) to define CD45+CD90+CD8+ or CD4+ T cells, CD45+CD90– 
Gr-1–CD11b+/–CD11cbright 
DCs, 
CD45+CD90–Gr-1–CD11b+CD11c+/– 
macrophages, and CD45+C D90–Gr-1+CD11b+CD11c+/– MDSCs. T cell 
cytokine expression was determined by intracellular staining, and Abs 
against mouse IL-2 (JES6-5H4), IFN-γ (XMG1.2), and TNF-α (MP6-
XT22) were used. All flow samples were acquired through LSR II (BD), 
and data were analyzed with DIVA software (BD Biosciences).
Western blot. Cells or tissue samples were lysed. Total protein 
was separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane 
by electroblotting. PD-L1 proteins were determined by using ECL 
uncovers a role in the T cell–priming phase in TDLNs. Further, APC 
expression of PD-L1 offers an explanation for why patients with 
PD-L1–negative tumors can respond to PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade 
therapy (32). However, ectopic PD-L1 expression in P815 tumor 
cells is reported to be linked with increased tumor load in mouse 
models (33, 34). We do not exclude a protumor role of high levels 
of tumor PD-L1 in vivo in mice. Given the potential critical effect 
of IFN-γ signaling in PD-L1 stimulation and therapeutic resistance 
(35), it is possible that the expression levels of PD-L1 in APCs and 
tumor cells may be synchronously regulated by IFN signaling and 
positively correlate in the same tumor microenvironment. There-
fore, tumor PD-L1 expression would indirectly function as a bio-
marker for therapeutic responses to PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade 
for some cancer patients. Furthermore, we have found that (a) in 
the absence of host PD-L1, PD-L1 blockade remains ineffective 
in mice bearing tumor cells with enforced PD-L1 expression, (b) 
anti–PD-L1 treatment has no effect on human T cell activation in 
the presence of PD-L1+ human tumor cells, and (c) PD-L1+ APCs 
positively correlate with clinical responses in melanoma and ovar-
ian cancer patients treated with PD-1 blockade. Nonetheless, giv-
en that we have studied limited numbers of cancer patients who 
received the PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade therapy, the role of PD-L1 
expression in tumor cells versus host immune cells deserves fur-
ther mechanistic and therapeutic investigations in cancer patients.
In summary, our data suggest that PD-L1+ APCs may mecha-
nistically shape and therapeutically predict efficacy of PD-L1 and 
PD-1 blockade. Thus, it may be important to quantify APC PD-L1 
in tumor tissues and TDLNs to predict and improve patient selec-
tion for PD-L1 and PD-1 blockade therapy.
Methods
Patients with melanoma and ovarian cancer. Twenty-six patients diag-
nosed with melanoma (8 locally advanced and 18 metastatic) received 
simultaneous treatment of the anti–PD-1 Ab (Nivolumab) and the 
anti–CTLA-4 Ab (Ipilimumab) at the University of Michigan Hospital. 
Twenty-three tumor samples were collected before treatment, 2 during 
treatment, and 1 after treatment. Seventeen patients diagnosed with 
ovarian carcinomas (12 cases of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, 
3 cases of endometrioid ovarian carcinomas, 2 cases of ovarian clear-
cell carcinoma) received the anti–PD-1 Ab (nivolumab) at the Kyoto 
University Hospital (UMIN000005714) (10). Ovarian tumor sam-
ples were collected before treatment. Clinical response patterns were 
defined based on RECIST criteria (http:/
/www.irrecist.com/recist/). 
Consecutive 6-μm–thick tissue sections were cut and placed on charged 
poly-l-lysine–coated slides for immunohistochemistry analyses.
Mouse cancer cell lines. Mouse melanoma cell line B16-F10 and 
lung cancer cell line LLC were purchased from ATCC. Mouse colon 
cancer cell line MC38 (36) and ovarian cancer cell line ID8 (37) were 
previously reported. All cell lines were regularly examined for myco-
plasma contamination.
In vivo mouse models. Six- to eight-week-old NSG, Rag1tm1Mom 
(Rag1–/–), and WT C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Jackson Lab-
oratory. PD-L1–/– mice were originally from Lieping Chen (Yale Univer-
sity, New Haven, Connecticut, USA) (38). PD-1–/– mice were originally 
from Tasuku Honjo (Kyoto University) (39). All mice were maintained 
under pathogen-free conditions. For MC38, B16-F10, and LLC tumor 
models, 106 tumor cells were subcutaneously injected on the right

were scanned and quantified in each individual immune cell subset in 
the entire tissue section. The following Abs were used: PD-L1 (E1L3N, 
Cell Signaling Technology), CD11c (EP1347Y, Abcam), CD68 (KP1, 
Dako), CD163 (10D6, Abcam), PAN-melanoma Ab (HMB45/DT101/
BC199/T311, ab733, Abcam), and pan keratin (AE1/AE3, Dako).
Statistics. Wilcoxon rank-sum test, 2 tailed t test, and χ2 tests were 
used to compare 2 independent groups. Survival functions were estimat-
ed by Kaplan-Meier methods and compared using the log-rank test. All 
analyses were done using SAS 9.3 software or GraphPad Prism. P < 0.05 
was considered significant. Sample size was determined on the basis of 
animal experimental trials and in consideration of previous publications 
on similar experiments to allow for confident statistical analyses. Unless 
noted, samples were independent biological replicates.
Study approval. All human tissues in this study were obtained with 
the approval of IRBs and patients’ consent or were archival tissue col-
lected for routine diagnostic purposes and used under IRB-approved 
waivers of consent. Patients and healthy individuals were recruited 
through the University of Michigan Hospital or Kyoto University Hos-
pital. Informed consent was obtained from all patients and healthy 
individuals prior to sample collection. All animal experiments were 
performed according to protocols approved by the Institute of Univer-
sity of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA).

PD-L1 overexpression. MC38 cells were transfected with len-
tivirus encoding PD-L1 (MR203953L2, Origene Technologies) or 
scrambled control. After transfection, the transfected cells were 
selected for over 2 weeks, tested for PD-L1 expression, and cultured 
for the in vivo experiments.
Adoptive transfer experiments. We initially performed adoptive 
transfer experiments with bone marrow–derived DCs and macro-
phages. Bone marrow from the hind legs of WT or PD-L1–/– mice was 
obtained, and erythrocytes were lysed with Red Blood Cell Lysis 
Buffer (Sigma Aldrich). DCs and macrophages were generated from 
bone marrow cells with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF and 5 ng/ml IL-4 (R&D 
Systems) and 10 ng/ml M-CSF, respectively (40). Before adoptive 
transfer experiment, cells were stimulated with 1 ng/ml IFN-γ for 
16 hours. Macrophages or DCs (5 × 106) were intravenously injected 
into PD-L1–/– mice on day –1, and MC38 cells (3 × 106) were subcuta-
neously injected into the mice on day 0. An additional macrophage 
or DC intratumor injection was performed on day 7. In addition, we 
performed adoptive transfer experiments with ID8 tumor–associat-
ed residential APCs. To this end, ID8 tumor cells were injected into 
peritoneal cavities in WT and PD-L1–/– mice. On day 15, we collected 
peritoneal cells from ID8 tumor–bearing mice. CD11c+ and CD11b+ 
cells were isolated with specific beads and sorted as APCs. APCs 
 
(4 × 106) were adoptively transferred into individual ID8 tumor–bear-
ing PD-L1–/– mice. Tumor progression was monitored. For tracking 
these cells, APCs were collected from CD45.1 mice and were subse-
quently transferred into ID8 tumor–bearing CD45.2 mice.
Immunofluorescence staining and analysis. Staining for mouse CD3 
(SP7, Abcam) was performed on frozen tumor sections. Alexa Fluor 
488–conjugated anti-rabbit secondary Abs (Life Technologies) were 
used. Staining with isotype Ab was used as a negative control. T cells 
were counted manually at 10–20 high-power fields under a fluores-
cence microscope (Leica). Immunofluorescence staining on human 
paraffin cancer tissue sections was performed with OPAL-4–plex 
reagents, scanned, and imaged at ×10–40 on the Mantra Automated 
Quantitative Pathology Imaging System, and analyzed using Inform 
software (Perkin-Elmer) for the PD-L1 expression score in the entire 
tissue sections. The score ranking was assessed by the combination of 
PD-L1 expression intensity and the percentage of PD-L1+ cells within 
a specific cell type: 0 for no PD-L1 labeling (or 0%); 1 for single pos-
itivity or weak intensity; 2 for 10% positivity or medium intensity; 3 
for 20%–40% positivity or medium intensity; and 4 for greater than 
40% positivity or strong intensity. The percentages of PD-L1+ APCs
