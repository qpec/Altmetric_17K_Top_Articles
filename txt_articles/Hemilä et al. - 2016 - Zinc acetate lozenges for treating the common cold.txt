AIMS
The aim of this study was to determine whether the allergy status and other characteristics of common cold patients modify the
effects of zinc acetate lozenges.
METHODS
We had available individual patient data for three randomized placebo-controlled trials in which zinc acetate lozenges were ad-
ministered to common cold patients. We used both one stage and two stage meta-analysis to estimate the effects of zinc lozenges.
RESULTS
The total number of common cold patients was 199, the majority being females. Eighty percent of them fell into the age range
20–50 years. One third of the patients had allergies. The one stage meta-analysis gave an overall estimate of 2.73 days (95% CI
1.8, 3.3 days) shorter colds by zinc acetate lozenge usage. The two stage meta-analysis gave an estimate of 2.94 days (95% CI 2.1,
3.8 days) reduction in common cold duration. These estimates are to be compared with the 7 day average duration of colds in the
three trials. The effect of zinc lozenges was not modified by allergy status, smoking, baseline severity of the common cold, age,
gender or ethnic group.
CONCLUSION
Since the effects of zinc acetate lozenges were consistent between the compared subgroups, the overall estimates for effect
seemed applicable over a wide range of common cold patients. While the optimal composition of zinc lozenges and the best
frequency of their administration should be further investigated, given the current evidence of efficacy, common cold patients
may be encouraged to try zinc lozenges for treating their colds.

 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• Randomized trials have shown that zinc acetate lozenges shorten the duration of common cold episodes.
• One study found that the effect of zinc acetate lozenges was greater for patients with allergies.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• The effect of zinc acetate lozenges is not modified by allergy, smoking, baseline common cold severity, age, gender or
ethnic group.
• The mean effect of 3 day reduction in common cold duration with zinc acetate lozenges is clinically relevant and appears
widely applicable.
Introduction
Interest in zinc lozenges for treating the common cold arose
when the cold symptoms of a 3-year-old girl with leukemia
disappeared soon after she dissolved a therapeutic zinc tablet
in her mouth instead of swallowing it as instructed [1].
The benefit seemed to be obtained from slowly dissolving
the tablet in her mouth, which suggested that zinc might
have local effects in the pharyngeal region. This observation
led the girl’s father to conduct the first randomized placebo-
controlled
trial
on
the
effects
of
zinc
lozenges
on
common cold patients. In that study, zinc gluconate lozenges
shortened the duration of colds significantly [1].
Since then, a series of trials on zinc lozenges has been car-
ried out but the results were variable [2–5]. The daily dosage
of elemental zinc in the trials had a seven-fold variation,
which explains much of the inconsistency in the study
findings [2]. The composition of the lozenges also differed.
Some of them contained substances that bound zinc tightly,
preventing the release of free zinc ions. The composition
differences also explain divergent results [3–6].
A previous meta-analysis indicated that five low dose tri-
als of zinc lozenges (<75 mg day–1 zinc) uniformly produced
no effect on the duration of colds. However, three high dose
(>75 mg day–1) zinc acetate trials produced a 42% reduction
in the duration of colds on average and five high dose zinc
gluconate trials found a 20% reduction in cold duration on
average [2]. Since acetate binds zinc ions less strongly than
gluconate, zinc acetate has been proposed as the best salt for
lozenges [4, 5]. Although dissolving lozenges in the oro-
pharyngeal region leads to the highest zinc levels in that an-
atomical region, a recent meta-analysis found no evidence
that zinc acetate lozenges have less effect on nasal symptoms
compared with cold symptoms that originate in lower ana-
tomical regions [7]. Other systematic reviews on zinc and
the common cold have been published [8–10], but some of
them had methodological problems [11–13] and a Cochrane
review was recently withdrawn [14].
Petrus et al. [15] reported that common cold patients who
had positive skin testing for allergies were more responsive to
the zinc acetate lozenges than those who were negative for
allergies, but that association has not been analyzed in later
studies. The effect of zinc lozenges might also be modified
by smoking which influences the respiratory system and by
the severity of the common cold which reflects different
levels of pathologic changes caused by the respiratory viruses.
The goal of the present individual patient data (IPD) meta-
analysis was to determine whether the efficacy of high dose
zinc acetate lozenges varies by the allergy status, smoking,
baseline
common
cold
severity
or
by
demographic
characteristics.
Methods
Selection of the trials
This meta-analysis was restricted to placebo-controlled trials
on zinc acetate lozenges for patients with naturally acquired
common cold infections, in which the elemental zinc dosage
was >75 mg day–1. We restricted the selection to high dose
trials, since previous analyses demonstrated the lack of effect
of low doses of zinc, <75 mg day–1 [2, 4, 5, 10]. Previous
searches of the literature [2, 5, 8–10] identified three trials
that met our selection criteria [15–17]. These three trials are
shown in Table 1 and further characteristics are shown in
Supporting information File S1. No additional zinc acetate
lozenge trials were found by searching PubMed and Scopus
using the free search terms ‘zinc’ and ‘lozenge*’ (June 16
2016). The three datasets for this IPD meta-analysis were
made available with the cooperation and collaboration of
the authors of the three trials and the lead author. We did
not use a protocol for this meta-analysis.
Outcome
The outcome in this meta-analysis was the duration of colds.
Petrus et al. [15] reported both the mean duration of common
cold symptoms and the duration of the longest cold symp-
tom. We used the latter as the outcome for this analysis, since
it is consistent with the outcome definition in the two studies
by Prasad et al. [16, 17].
Statistical methods
In checking of the IPD for the three studies, we confirmed
that the effects of zinc lozenges in the IPD data were consis-
tent with the published effects [15–17].
Pooling of the IPD was done by the one stage and two
stage approaches. One stage meta-analysis indicates that the
pooled effect estimates are calculated directly from the IPD.
Two stage meta-analysis indicates that the effect estimates
of the individual studies are first calculated from the IPD.
Thereafter, those study level estimates are pooled by standard
meta-analysis methods. In some cases, the one stage meta-
analysis has greater statistical power and sometimes the two
approaches led to different conclusions [18].

 We used the lmer procedure of the lme4 statistical pack-
age of R [19] for the one stage meta-analysis. In the mixed
models constructed with lmer, we used the study as the ran-
dom variable for the zinc effect and also as an independent
explanatory variable. The interaction between the zinc loz-
enge effect and each subgroup variable was calculated by first
adding the zinc effect and the subgroup variable to the basic
model and thereafter adding their interaction term. The in-
teraction between zinc and the subgroup variable was added
as a random variable. The P value for the interaction was cal-
culated by using the likelihood ratio test.
In the two stage pooling, we first used the lm procedure
[19] to calculate the mean effects and the zinc subgroup inter-
actions separately in the three trials. Thereafter we pooled
those effects by the metagen procedure of the meta package
using the inverse variance and random effects options [19].
The P value for the interaction was calculated from the
z-value of the pooled interaction effect. We used the χ2 test
and the I2 statistic to assess statistical heterogeneity among
the three trials in the two stage approach. A value of I2 greater
than about 70% indicates a high level of heterogeneity [20].
We used the difference in the duration of colds in days as
the main measure of the zinc effect. However, since the distri-
butions of viruses differ over time and the operational out-
come definitions vary between trials, variation between
studies is to be expected. Since relative effect adjusts for vari-
ation in the common cold duration in the placebo groups, we
also calculated the overall effect of zinc in the percentage
scale so that the duration of each placebo group was normal-
ized to 100%. Thereby the difference between the zinc group
and the placebo group directly gives the effect of zinc loz-
enges in percentages.
Our calculations are described in detail in Supporting
information File S2. Two-tailed P values are used.

 the age range between 20 and 50 years. The majority was
White, 23% were African Americans and 10% were of other
ethnic origin. In the Petrus et al. study, all common cold pa-
tients were skin tested with 20 different allergy extracts includ-
ing grasses, trees, and cat and dog dander and 46% of the
patients tested positive for allergies [15] (see details in
Supporting information File S1). In their two trials, Prasad
et al. asked about allergies with a questionnaire and 12% [16]
and 20% [17] reported having allergies. Petrus et al. did not re-
cord information about smoking, whereas in the two studies
by Prasad et al., a quarter of participants were smokers. All
three
studies
were
randomized,
double-blind,
placebo-
controlled trials and there were few drop-outs. Further de-
tails of the methodology of the three trials are described in
Supporting information File S1.
Petrus et al. instructed patients to dissolve in their mouth
one lozenge every 1.5 h while awake on the first day and then
one lozenge every 2 h on the following days. Lozenges dis-
solved in about 15 min [15]. Prasad et al. instructed patients
to dissolve one lozenge in their mouth every 2 to 3 h while
awake. Their lozenges dissolved in about 0.5 h [5, 16, 17].
Elemental zinc dose varied between 80 and 92 mg day–1 in
the three studies (Supporting information File S1).
Table 2 shows the estimated effect of zinc acetate lozenges
over all participants. The one stage meta-analysis gives an es-
timate of a 2.73 day reduction in common cold duration and
the two stage meta-analysis gives an estimate of 2.94 days.
These estimates are to be compared with the 7 day average du-
ration of colds in the three trials (Table 2). The small difference
between the two pooled estimates is explained by the substan-
tially greater zinc effect and smaller SDs in the two small stud-
ies by Prasad et al. (n = 48 and n = 50) [16, 17], compared with
the smaller effect and larger SD in the larger study by Petrus
et al. (n = 101) [15] (see Table 2). The two stage method gives
a greater effect estimate for zinc lozenges since the total
weight of the two studies by Prasad is 75%, although the num-
ber of participants is essentially equal with the Petrus et al.
study [15], see Forest plot in Supporting information File S2.
The effectiveness of zinc acetate lozenges on the duration
of colds on the relative scale is also shown in Table 2. One stage
IPD meta-analysis gave an estimate of 36% average reduction
in common cold duration and the two stage pooling gave an
estimate of 40% average reduction in the duration of colds.
Table 3 shows the one stage subgroup analyses of the zinc
lozenge effects. It shows the difference in the zinc lozenge ef-
fect between the complementary subgroups. The effect of zinc
acetate lozenges was not modified by allergy, smoking, base-
line severity of the cold, age, gender or ethnic group. Age
was analyzed as a continuous variable and no interaction with
zinc effect was seen for that variable either. The two stage
approach gave similar results (see Supporting information
File S2). In the two stage subgroup analysis, there was no
heterogeneity in the interaction between the zinc effect
and subgroups between the three trials.
Discussion
The effect of zinc acetate lozenges on the common cold was
not modified by allergy, smoking, baseline severity of the
common cold, age, gender or ethnic group (Table 3). Our
IPD meta-analysis does not support the earlier indication that
zinc lozenges might be more effective for participants who
have allergies [15].
Since no subgroup differences were found in the effect of
zinc acetate lozenges, the overall estimates calculated in
Table 2 are the most useful estimates for common cold partic-
ipants comparable with the patients included in these three
trials. Thus, given an average common cold duration of ap-
proximately 1 week (Table 2), zinc acetate lozenges may
shorten common cold duration by an average of 3 days over
various population groups.
A previous meta-analysis of the same three trials calcu-
lated that zinc acetate lozenges shortened the duration of
colds on average by 42% [2]. That calculation was based on
fixed effect pooling of the reported study level estimates.
The current one stage and two stage IPD meta-analyses gave
similar overall estimates, though the current study calculated
random effects models.
Our meta-analysis was restricted to three studies with zinc
acetate lozenges. Since there is evidence that acetate binds
zinc ions less strongly than gluconate, zinc acetate has been
proposed as a more suitable salt for lozenges than zinc gluco-
nate [4, 5]. Nevertheless, three studies with high doses of zinc
as zinc gluconate also reported a statistically significant 21%

 to 48% reduction in the duration of colds [1, 21, 22] (see
meta-analysis in [2]. The data of those old zinc gluconate
studies were no longer available and we restricted our sub-
group analysis to the three zinc acetate trials for which we
had the IPD available.
Farr & Gwaltney [23] speculated that the apparent benefit
of zinc gluconate lozenges reported by Eby et al. [1] might
have been explained by the bad taste of the lozenges.
However, none of the three zinc acetate lozenge trials
included in our meta-analysis showed that bad taste was a
problem. There was no substantial difference between the
zinc and placebo groups in the occurrence of adverse effects
and only a few dropouts occurred [15–17]. In the most recent
trial [17], a few patients identified the type of lozenge that
they were administered, but when the analysis was restricted
to those who remained blinded at the end of the trial, the
efficacy of zinc lozenges was comparable with the efficacy
for all participants.
Zinc doses of 100 to 150 mg day–1 have been administered
to certain patient groups for months with few adverse effects
[2, 24–27]. Thus, it is unlikely that a zinc dose of some
80 mg day–1 for 1 to 2 weeks, starting soon after the first com-
mon cold symptoms, might cause long term adverse effects. If
a patient considers that the taste of the zinc lozenge is bad, he
or she can discontinue using the lozenges, whereas other
common cold patients may continue its use. Although the
evidence is strong that properly formulated zinc lozenges
can shorten the duration of colds, it appears that the majority
of zinc lozenges on the market have either doses of zinc
which are too low or contain substances that bind zinc, such
as citric acid [5]. Therefore, the findings of this analysis
should not be directly generalized to the wide variety of zinc
lozenge formulations on the market.
In conclusion, our IPD meta-analysis found that the effect
of zinc acetate lozenges on the duration of the common cold
is not modified by allergy, smoking, baseline common cold
severity, age, gender or ethnic group. The calculated 3 day
and 36% estimates for the reduction of common cold dura-
tion are substantial effects and worth utilizing by common
cold patients. The optimal composition of zinc lozenges and
the best frequency of their administration should be further
investigated. Nevertheless, given the current evidence of effi-
cacy and the low rate of adverse effects, common cold pa-
tients may be encouraged to try zinc acetate lozenges for
treating their colds.
