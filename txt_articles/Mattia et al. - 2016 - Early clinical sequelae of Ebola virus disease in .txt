 to describe the prevalence, nature, and predictors of three key EVD sequelae (ocular, auditory, and 
articular) in this cohort of EVD survivors.
Methods—We reviewed available clinical and laboratory records of consecutive patients assessed 
in the clinic between March 7 and April 24, 2015. We used univariate and multiple logistic 
regression to examine clinical and laboratory features of acute EVD with the following outcomes 
in convalescence: new ocular symptoms, uveitis, auditory symptoms and arthralgias.
Findings—Among 277 survivors (59% female), median age was 29 years (IQR 20–36) and 
median time from discharge from an EVD treatment facility to first survivor clinic visit was 121 
days (82–151). Clinical sequelae were common, including arthralgias (n=210, 76%), new ocular 
symptoms (n=167, 60%), uveitis (n=50, 18%), and auditory symptoms (n=67, 24%). Higher Ebola 
viral load at acute EVD presentation (as shown by lower cycle thresholds on real-time RT-PCR 
testing) was independently associated with uveitis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3·33, 95% CI 1·87–
5·91, for every five-point decrease in cycle threshold) and with new ocular symptoms or ocular 
diagnoses (aOR 3·04, 95% CI 1·87–4·94).
Interpretation—Clinical sequelae during early EVD convalescence are common and sometimes 
sight threatening. These findings underscore the need for early clinical follow-up of EVD 
survivors and urgent provision of ocular care as part of health systems strengthening in EVD-
affected West African countries.
Funding—Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
INTRODUCTION
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in west Africa is the largest in history. As of 
November, 2015, over 28 500 EVD cases have been reported with an estimated 15 000 
survivors.1 Community-led survivor networks have alerted health-care providers to a variety 
of convalescent symptoms, including vision and hearing loss and arthralgia.2–4
Understanding of the nature, timing, and prevalence of EVD sequelae remains limited.5−13 
Disabling sequelae, including ocular, auditory, and arthritic symptoms, have been described 
in small studies from previous outbreaks.7,9–11,13 In the current outbreak, one qualitative 
study of 100 survivors in Sierra Leone reported blurred or partial loss of vision in 
convalescence but did not quantify these sequelae.2 Surveys of 105 survivors in Guinea14 
and of 81 survivors in Sierra Leone15 noted frequent musculoskeletal pain14,15 and visual 
problems;15 neither study included a clinical examination of survey participants. No studies 
from the west African outbreak have examined possible relations between features of acute 
EVD and the frequency or severity of clinical sequelae. Therefore, we did a cross-sectional 
study to describe the prevalence, nature, and predictors of three key EVD sequelae (ocular, 
auditory, and articular) in a large cohort of survivors of EVD in Port Loko district, Sierra 
Leone.

 METHODS
Study Setting
By Nov 12, 2015, 1485 EVD cases were reported from the rural district of Port Loko 
(population 572 369), with 661 survivors according to the Sierra Leone Association for 
Ebola Survivors registry.16 Before Nov 30, 2014, some patients were referred for care in 
Ebola treatment units (ETUs) outside the district, since ETU scale-up was still underway in 
Port Loko. After Nov 29, 2014, 90% of patients with EVD in Port Loko received care at one 
of three ETUs (Maforki, Mathaska, and Lunsar) in the district. The Port Loko EVD Survivor 
Care Clinic was established on March 7, 2015, at the Baptist Eye Hospital Lunsar as a 
clinical partnership between Partners in Health (PIH), the PIH-supported EVD Survivor 
Network, GOAL Global, International Medical Corps, and Christian Blind Mission under 
the oversight of the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) District Health 
Management Team, with technical support from WHO.
Patient population
Survivors of EVD were identified via the MoHS-WHO registry of patients residing in Port 
Loko District, regardless of where originally treated. All were laboratory confirmed to have 
EVD through real-time RT-PCR testing on serum and discharged from ETUs after clinical 
improvement and a negative convalescent real-time RT-PCR. The registry was cross checked 
against the Sierra Leone Association for Ebola Survivors registry to generate a complete list 
(appendix). The EVD Survivor Network led community sensitisation regarding the 
establishment of the clinic. Survivors were systematically contacted by mobile phone by the 
clinic coordinator according to village of residence. Bus pick-ups were scheduled for each 
village and patients were assessed in the clinic irrespective of symptoms. We started with 
villages with resident survivors discharged in the remote past, until all villages were 
covered. As of Nov 12, 2015, the clinic had assessed 603 survivors of EVD residing in Port 
Loko at least once.
Data Collection
We extracted demographic and clinical data from patient charts (appendix) on the first 277 
consecutive survivors of EVD assessed in the survivor clinic between March 7, 2015, and 
April 24, 2015. Eight patients were self-referred with ocular symptoms, but all would 
nevertheless have been identified through the village selections over the study period. Each 
patient received a clinical assessment and an eye examination, including visual acuity and 
slit-lamp examination. Patients with ocular symptoms, decreased visual acuity, or 
abnormalities on slit-lamp examination also received dilated fundoscopic assessment. 
Clinical data were entered into an electronic database and linked to two other datasets using 
the EVD laboratory number, and cross-checked with a unique patient identifier, sex, date of 
acute EVD testing, and patient residence or age. The additional datasets included: EVD 
surveillance data, which provided symptoms on presentation; and real-time RT-PCR and 
cycle threshold (an inversely correlated marker of viral load) results on the subset of patients 
who were diagnosed or cared for in a Port Loko ETU. The real-time RT-PCR assay used for 
testing changed after Feb 1, 2015 (appendix). After linkage, anonymised data were used for

 analyses. The study was approved by the Sierra Leone MoHS and Ethics and Scientific 
Review Committee.
Data Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to report features of acute EVD and clinical symptoms at the 
first convalescent visit. We used χ2 or Fisher’s exact test for categorical data and the t test or 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous data to assess the relation between demographics 
(age, sex), cycle threshold at EVD diagnosis, duration of acute illness (days from symptom 
onset to the first negative real-time RT-PCR during acute EVD), self-reported symptoms of 
acute EVD, and the absence or presence of each of four key sequelae present at the first 
convalescent visit: uveitis diagnosed on slit-lamp and dilated fundoscopic examination; new 
ocular symptom or diagnosis (including uveitis or conjunctivitis); new auditory symptoms 
(tinnitus, subjective hearing loss, aural fullness); and new arthralgias or diagnosis of 
arthritis. Symptoms were considered new if onset was either while in the ETU or after 
discharge. We explored all self-reported symptoms of acute EVD in the univariate analyses, 
excluding individual responses listed as missing or could not recall.
We used multiple logistic regression to delineate predictors of EVD sequelae. To preserve 
model parsimony, independent variables were chosen a priori to show severity of acute EVD 
(duration of acute illness and cycle threshold value at diagnosis17) and acute clinical features 
based on previously established links to post-infectious immunological sequelae (presence 
of red eyes [for ocular outcomes only], presence of diarrhoea18). The model was adjusted for 
age and sex.
We did a sensitivity analysis to determine if time period of cycle threshold value 
measurement (before or after real-time RT-PCR assay changed on Feb 1, 2015) affected the 
final models as an interaction effect. Analyses were done using SAS software, version 9.3 
(SAS Institute).
Role of Funding Source
The research was funded in part by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. The funder 
had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The study leads (JGM, MJV) and corresponding author (SM) had full access to 
all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
RESULTS
Demographic and clinical features during acute EVD in the 277 survivors included in the 
study are presented in table 1. Just over half (n=163, 59%) were female, and the median age 
was 29 years (IQR 20–36). Median time from ETU discharge to first clinic visit was 121 
days (IQR 82–151).
Symptoms and diagnoses at first convalescent clinic visit are presented in table 2. 210 (76%) 
patients reported arthralgias (joint pain or ache without swelling or evidence of an effusion

 on examination), predominantly of an oligoarthralgia pattern (one to four joints), with most 
(n=180, 86%) reporting bilateral joint involvement. One patient also had tenosynovitis.
Patients reported tinnitus (n=56, 20%), aural fullness (n=23, 8%), and subjective hearing 
loss (n=17, 6%), and 167 patients (60%) reported at least one ocular symptom. The self-
reported median time from ETU discharge to onset of symptoms varied according to 
symptom: articular (1 week [IQR 0–4·3]; n=156), auditory (2 weeks [0–8·6]; n=51), and 
ocular (2 weeks [0–8·6]; n=119) symptoms. Symptoms began while in the ETU in 52 (25%) 
of 210 patients with auditory symptoms, 18 (27%) of 67 patients with articular symptoms, 
and 33 (20%) of 167 patients with ocular symptoms.
Based on slit-lamp and dilated fundoscopic examination, 50 (18%) patients were diagnosed 
with uveitis involving 68 eyes (46% anterior, 26% posterior, 3% intermediate uveitis, and 
25% panuveitis). Uveitis was predominantly unilateral (64% of cases). Five (10%) patients 
with uveitis also had early cataracts, and their median age was 29 years (IQR 18–40) years 
compared with 45 years (38–52·5) in the 16 patients with cataracts but without uveitis, 
although we did not have statistical power to assess for differences. Patients with uveitis 
developed ocular symptoms a median of 3 weeks (IQR 0·4–8·6; range 0–17·2) after ETU 
discharge. Each ocular symptom, compared with its absence, was associated with uveitis 
(appendix). The presence of blurry vision, light sensitivity, or itchy eye was 88·0% sensitive 
and 50·7% specific for underlying uveitis. Conjunctivitis was present in 31 (11%) of 277 
patients.
Table 3 shows the univariate analyses of differences in demographic, clinical, and laboratory 
features during acute EVD and sequelae reported at the first convalescent visit. Other than 
arthralgia, which was more common in older persons, sequelae occurred with similar 
frequencies in both sexes and across age groups. On additional exploratory analysis, ocular 
symptoms during acute EVD were associated with subsequent ocular symptoms, but not 
specifically with uveitis. Acute symptoms such as gingival bleeding, red eyes, and blurry 
vision were more commonly reported among those with subsequent auditory or articular 
sequelae. A history of fever during acute EVD was associated with uveitis and with ocular 
symptoms in convalescence. Lower cycle threshold values at acute EVD presentation were 
significantly associated with uveitis in convalescence (median 22·4 [IQR 19·5–26·1] for 
those with uveitis versus 26·8 [23·5–29·0] for those without, p<0·0001) but not with 
arthralgias or auditory symptoms.
Data on cycle threshold value and duration of acute EVD were available for a subset of 190 
patients who were either diagnosed or treated in ETUs in Port Loko. The demographic and 
clinical features of patients with and without laboratory data are shown in the appendix. 
Patients with missing laboratory data were not significantly different in age, sex, or 
symptoms during acute EVD.
Table 4 shows the independent predictors of clinical sequelae on multivariable analyses. 
After adjusting for age, sex, and duration of acute illness, a lower cycle threshold value at 
acute presentation was independently associated with uveitis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 
3·33, 95% CI 1·87–5·91, for every five-point decrease in cycle threshold) and with new onset

 ocular symptoms or diagnoses overall (aOR 3·04, 95% CI 1·87–4·94). Neither diarrhoea nor 
red eyes during acute EVD were associated with uveitis. Nor was diarrhoea during acute 
EVD associated with arthralgias or auditory sequelae. The association between cycle 
threshold value and EVD sequelae was not significantly affected by time period (before or 
after Feb 1, 2015).
DISCUSSION
We found that 50 (18%) patients who survived acute EVD developed uveitis, with ocular 
symptoms developing as early as during the ETU stay or as late as 17 weeks after discharge. 
Ebola viral load at the time of EVD diagnosis, which has also been associated with 
increased mortality in past studies, was the key independent predictor of ocular symptoms 
and specifically uveitis.17,19,20
Our findings generate important hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of EVD sequelae. 
Ebola virus is rapidly cleared from most body fluids after resolution of acute disease,21–23 
but might persist in immunologically privileged sanctuary sites.10,21 For example, viable 
Ebola virus was isolated from the aqueous humour at high concentrations (cycle threshold of 
18·7) in a patient who developed severe sight-threatening uveitis 9 weeks after surviving 
acute EVD with high viraemia.24 The findings from this case and our findings from Sierra 
Leone support the hypothesis that virus persistence and replication in ocular chambers might 
play a part in the pathogenesis of uveitis in survivors of EVD.24 Furthermore, the fact that 
the patient was critically ill during his acute infection is consistent with the hypothesis that 
severe disease, which generally correlates with level of viraemia,17 might lead to virus 
persistence and long-term complications. The same survivor had prolonged persistence of 
virus in the semen (Crozier I, unpublished) and shedding of virus in semen has been 
reported up to 9 months after acute illness in survivors in Sierra Leone.25 Determination of 
the early predictors of persistence in semen and its relation to ocular complications would be 
of interest as a potentially less invasive marker of intraocular persistence.
Persistent immune activation, rather than direct viral cytopathic effect, has been postulated 
to lead to some post-EVD sequelae, although the processes are not necessarily mutually 
exclusive;26 immune activation might be driven by persistent virus replication or delayed 
antigen clearance in immune-privileged tissues. In our study, there was no association 
between the level of viraemia at acute EVD presentation and convalescent arthralgias or 
auditory symptoms, a finding which suggests a potentially different mechanism of non-
ocular disease post-EVD. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the lack of 
apparent association relates to how outcomes were measured (eg, in this study lack of 
audiometry) or defined (any joint involvement rather than specific distribution of joints), or 
to potential differences in levels of viraemia required to penetrate into various sites. IgG 
antibody titres were significantly higher in 29 survivors of EVD with arthralgias than in 
those without after the 1995 outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo, a finding 
consistent with persistent immune activation as the pathogenic mechanism.11 Unfortunately, 
we were not able to do antibody testing on our patients to assess relations between antibody 
titre and sequelae.

 The prevalence of arthralgias in our series is similar to that noted in a survey of survivors of 
EVD in Guinea (87%) a median of 103 days into convalescence,14 but was higher than that 
reported in survivors of EVD at 21 months after the aforementioned Kikwit outbreak 
(48%)11 and up to 29 months after the 2007 Bundibugyo outbreak (25%), perhaps 
suggesting attenuation over time.13
Systematic clinical care for survivors of EVD was absent during the early part of the current 
outbreak due to the overwhelming need to care for those with acute disease. Furthermore, in 
Sierra Leone, there are just two ophthalmologists and eight mid-level ophthalmological care-
providers in the National Eye Health Program.
Systematic and universal access to ocular care for survivors of EVD is further restricted by 
lack of equipment (especially slit-lamps) and ocular medications, and by mobility of 
clinicians and patients. Addressing these barriers holds the potential to provide early 
diagnoses and treatment to survivors of EVD while strengthening eye care service delivery 
during health system reconstruction in west Africa. Our findings also signal the need for 
operational research into the feasibility and safety of syndromic treatment, including the use 
of topical steroids and cycloplegic agents, for survivors of EVD with clinical presentations 
consistent with uveitis, especially when slit-lamp examination is not possible.
A recent survey of 105 survivors of EVD in Guinea reported no ocular symptoms or hearing 
loss.14 The discrepancy with our results might be explained by the fact that the Guinea study 
only reported vision loss (noted in seven [3%] of our study participants) and that patients 
were not asked about tinnitus or aural fullness.14 In a survey of 81 survivors of EVD in 
Kenema, Sierra Leone, up to at least 4 months after resolution of acute disease, 42% 
reported visual problems.15 The variability in prevalence of sequelae reinforces the need for 
systematic and harmonised clinical assessments (including physical and ocular examination) 
and data collection and analyses across west Africa.
Although various case reports and surveys have been published,14,15,24,27,28 the data 
reported here comprise the largest systematic study of survivors of EVD from the 2014–15 
outbreak. Furthermore, unlike studies from previous clinical cohorts, the clinical data are 
drawn from a more representative sample of survivors, with all but eight (3%) of the 
participants (who self-presented with ocular complaints) drawn from systematic inclusion of 
villages and assessed irrespective of symptoms. Furthermore, protocol-defined clinical 
charting and documentation provided structured data. Because all patients underwent a slit-
lamp examination and, when indicated, a dilated fundoscopic examination, the prevalence of 
uveitis noted is a reliable estimate, with minimal selection and measurement bias. However, 
since our data are derived from baseline clinic visits done at a range of periods after the 
onset of disease, the frequencies of the symptoms recorded might not reflect those that 
would be noted if clinic visits were scheduled at uniform times after recovery from acute 
EVD.
There are important limitations to this study. First, its cross-sectional nature prohibits 
measurement of the true incidence of EVD sequelae. Second, we did not have a comparison 
group of patients not infected with Ebola virus, and thus cannot infer the relative risk of the

 sequelae against background rates from other aetiologies of arthralgias, auditory, or ocular 
symptoms endemic to west Africa. Third, the clinic was not equipped for audiometry to 
objectively assess hearing. Fourth, symptoms during acute EVD were drawn from 
surveillance data (collected at the time of acute infection) and via symptom recall during 
convalescence, which might have resulted in recall bias. The proportion of patients with 
fever and diarrhoea during acute EVD noted in our study is similar to the proportion 
reporting fever (84–89%) and diarrhoea (51–62%) in other smaller clinical cohorts of acute 
EVD.29–31 However, red eyes and severe symptoms such as bleeding (including gingival 
bleeding) were more common compared with data collected at the time of acute EVD 
diagnosis in other studies.29–31 The higher frequency of certain symptoms might also reflect 
new symptoms developing during acute illness but that were not present at the time of 
diagnosis. Fifth, the denominator of EVD survivors in the district might vary with inter-
district migration, or willingness of survivors to disclose their current district of residence to 
the survivor network. Finally, laboratory data were missing for a subset of patients, although 
the primary outcomes (specifically uveitis) and other patient characteristics were similar to 
those for whom laboratory data were available.
Further research is needed to understand the pathogenesis of various EVD sequelae and to 
optimise treatment. The largest EVD outbreak in history has logically led to the largest 
number of survivors of EVD in history. These findings emphasise the importance of ongoing 
clinical follow-up and care of all patients, starting at discharge from an ETU, and underscore 
the urgent need for the greater provision of ocular care as part of the strengthening of health 
systems in west Africa.
RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
Evidence before this study
A MEDLINE search on the prevalence of post-Ebola virus disease (EVD) clinical sequelae 
using search terms “Ebola” and “survivor OR sequelae OR convalescen*” yielded 227 
unique citations published by Nov 12, 2015. There were no language restrictions. Excluding 
case reports, commentaries, and expert reviews, nine studies (case series, cohorts, and cross-
sectional surveys) provided clinical information post-Ebola sequelae, including three from 
the current west Africa outbreak. Only six studies quantify the prevalence of clinical 
sequelae, of which four explored early clinical sequelae in 240 survivors of Ebola within 3–4 
months of convalescence. To date, measurement of clinical sequelae was based on a clinical 
examination in only 57 patients (from two studies of previous outbreaks), and only four 
patients in these studies received a complete ophthalmological examination (visual acuity, 
slit-lamp, dilated fundoscopy). The largest (n=105) published study of early EVD clinical 
sequelae was based on self-reported symptoms without a clinical examination, with 
restricted questions on ocular and auditory symptoms that were self-reported in none of the 
105 survivors of EVD. None of the studies examined the predictors of developing early or 
late EVD clinical sequelae.

 Added value of this study
This study’s systematic clinical examination of EVD sequelae includes the largest 
representative sample of west African survivors of EVD from the 2014–15 outbreak. Unlike 
studies from previous clinical cohorts, the clinical and laboratory data were drawn from a 
more representative sample, with detailed and protocol-defined clinical charting and clinical 
examination, and provide information on the timing of sequelae. All patients underwent a 
slit-lamp examination, and as indicated, a dilated fundoscopic examination, such that the 
prevalence of uveitis is a reliable estimate with minimal selection and measurement bias. 
This study is also the first to examine the clinical and laboratory predictors of EVD clinical 
sequelae in convalescence.
Implications of the available evidence
These findings signal an immediate need to systematically provide early clinical follow-up 
for all survivors of EVD with particular attention paid to the potential for ocular 
complications. Further research is needed to understand the pathologies underlying the 
various EVD sequelae.
