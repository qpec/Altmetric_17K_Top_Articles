 Appropriate Antibiotic Use for Acute Respiratory Tract Infection in
Adults: Advice for High-Value Care From the American College of
Physicians and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Aaron M. Harris, MD, MPH; Lauri A. Hicks, DO; and Amir Qaseem, MD, PhD, MHA, for the High Value Care Task Force of the
American College of Physicians and for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention*
Background: Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is the most
common reason for antibiotic prescription in adults. Antibiotics
are often inappropriately prescribed for patients with ARTI. This
article presents best practices for antibiotic use in healthy adults
(those without chronic lung disease or immunocompromising
conditions) presenting with ARTI.
Methods: A narrative literature review of evidence about appro-
priate antibiotic use for ARTI in adults was conducted. The most
recent clinical guidelines from professional societies were com-
plemented by meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and random-
ized clinical trials. To identify evidence-based articles, the
Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were
searched through September 2015 using the following Medical
Subject Headings terms: “acute bronchitis,” “respiratory tract in-
fection,” “pharyngitis,” “rhinosinusitis,” and “the common cold.”
High-Value Care Advice 1: Clinicians should not perform test-
ing or initiate antibiotic therapy in patients with bronchitis unless
pneumonia is suspected.
High-Value Care Advice 2: Clinicians should test patients with
symptoms suggestive of group A streptococcal pharyngitis (for
example,
persistent
fevers,
anterior
cervical
adenitis,
and
tonsillopharyngeal exudates or other appropriate combination of
symptoms) by rapid antigen detection test and/or culture for
group A Streptococcus. Clinicians should treat patients with anti-
biotics only if they have confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis.
High-Value Care Advice 3: Clinicians should reserve antibiotic
treatment for acute rhinosinusitis for patients with persistent
symptoms for more than 10 days, onset of severe symptoms or
signs of high fever (>39 °C) and purulent nasal discharge or facial
pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive days, or onset of worsening
symptoms following a typical viral illness that lasted 5 days that
was initially improving (double sickening).
High-Value Care Advice 4: Clinicians should not prescribe
antibiotics for patients with the common cold.

A
cute respiratory tract infection (ARTI), which in-
cludes acute uncomplicated bronchitis, pharyngi-
tis, rhinosinusitis, and the common cold, is the most
common reason for acute outpatient physician office
visits and antibiotic prescription in adults. Antibiotics
are prescribed at more than 100 million adult ambula-
tory care visits annually, and 41% of these prescriptions
are for respiratory conditions (1). Inappropriate anti-
biotic use for ARTI is an important contributor to anti-
biotic resistance, an urgent public health threat (2). In
the United States, at least 2 million antibiotic-resistant
illnesses and 23 000 deaths occur each year, at a cost
to the U.S. economy of at least $30 billion (2). Increased
community use of antibiotics is highly correlated with
emerging antibiotic-resistant infections. In places with
greater prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics, spe-
cifically extended-spectrum cephalosporins and macro-
lides, rates of multidrug-resistant pneumococcal dis-
ease are higher (3).
Antibiotics are also responsible for the largest
number of medication-related adverse events, impli-
cated in 1 of every 5 visits to emergency departments
for adverse drug reactions (4). Adverse events range in
severity from mild (for example, diarrhea and rash) to
life-threatening (for example, Stevens–Johnson syn-
drome, anaphylaxis, or sudden cardiac death). Al-
though data on adverse events after inappropriate an-
tibiotic use are not available, an estimated 5% to 25%
of patients who use antibiotics have adverse events,
and about 1 in 1000 has a serious adverse event (2).
Clostridium
difficile
diarrhea,
which
can
be
life-
threatening and is usually a result of antibiotic treat-
ment, causes nearly 500 000 infections and 29 300
deaths in the United States each year, leading to an
estimated $1 billion in extra medical costs (5).

 In 2009, direct antibiotic prescription costs totaled
$10.7 billion; 62% of these costs ($6.5 billion) were at-
tributed to antibiotic prescribing in the community set-
ting, followed by $3.6 billion in hospitals and $527 mil-
lion in nursing homes and long-term care facilities (6).
An estimated 50% of antibiotic prescriptions may be
unnecessary or inappropriate in the outpatient setting
(7) (Unpublished data. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention), which equates to more than $3 billion in
excess costs. Over the past decade, antibiotic prescrip-
tions have decreased by 18% among persons aged 5
years or older in the United States; however, prescrip-
tions for broad-spectrum antibiotics (fluoroquinolones
and macrolides) have increased by at least 4-fold (8).
Reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in the
ambulatory setting is a public health priority.
This article by the American College of Physicians
(ACP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion presents available evidence on the appropriate
prescribing of antibiotics for adult patients with ARTI.
The high-value care advice is intended to amplify rather
than replace messages from recent clinical guidelines
on appropriate antibiotic prescribing (9–19) and serves
as an update of the 2001 Principles of Appropriate An-
tibiotic Use for Treatment of Acute Respiratory Tract In-
fections in Adults (9) and a complement to the pediatric
principles published in 2013 (20). The target audience
for this article is all clinicians providing care to adults
seeking ambulatory care for ARTI.
METHODS
We conducted a narrative review of evidence
about appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of pa-
tients with ARTI syndromes, including acute uncompli-
cated bronchitis, pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, and the
common cold. We included current clinical guidelines
from leading professional societies, such as the Infec-
tious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). Clinical
guideline recommendations were augmented with
evidence-based meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and
randomized clinical trials. To identify these evidence-
based articles, we conducted literature searches in the
Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE
through September 2015. We included only English-
language articles and used the following Medical Sub-
ject Headings terms: “acute bronchitis,” “respiratory
tract infection,” “pharyngitis,” “rhinosinusitis,” and “the
common cold”. The focus of the article was limited to
healthy adults without chronic lung disease (such as
cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease) or immunocompromising condi-
tions (congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies, HIV
infection, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome,
leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, generalized
cancer, multiple myeloma, iatrogenic immunosuppres-
sion, or a history of solid organ transplantation). We
present our findings for 4 ARTI syndromes and present
a framework for antibiotic prescribing strategies for
each (Table).
This article was reviewed and approved by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by the
ACP High Value Care Task Force, whose members are
physicians trained in internal medicine and its subspe-
cialties and which includes experts in evidence synthe-
sis. The Task Force developed the high-value care ad-
vice statements, which are summarized in the Figure,
based on the narrative review of the literature. At each
conference call, all members of the High Value Care
Task Force declared all financial and nonfinancial
interests.
ACUTE UNCOMPLICATED BRONCHITIS
Acute uncomplicated bronchitis is defined as a self-
limited inflammation of the large airways (bronchi) with
a cough lasting up to 6 weeks. The cough may or may
not be productive (24) and is often accompanied by
mild
constitutional
symptoms.
Acute
bronchitis
is
among the most common adult outpatient diagnoses,
with about 100 million (10%) ambulatory care visits in
the United States per year (8), more than 70% of which
result in a prescription for antibiotics (25, 26). Acute
bronchitis leads to more inappropriate antibiotic pre-
scribing than any other ARTI syndrome in adults (8).
Determining the Likelihood of a Bacterial
Infection
More than 90% of otherwise healthy patients pre-
senting to their outpatient providers with an acute
cough have a syndrome caused by a virus (Table) (10,
21, 22). Nonviral pathogens, such as Mycoplasma
pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, are oc-
casionally identified in patients with acute bronchitis
(10), and Bordetella pertussis may be considered in sit-
uations where transmission in the community has been
reported. However, determining whether a patient has
a viral or nonviral cause can be difficult. The presence
of purulent sputum or a change in its color (for exam-
ple, green or yellow) does not signify bacterial infec-
tion; purulence is due to the presence of inflammatory
cells or sloughed mucosal epithelial cells. Acute bron-
chitis must be distinguished from pneumonia. For
healthy immunocompetent adults younger than 70
years, pneumonia is unlikely in the absence of all of the
following clinical criteria: tachycardia (heart rate >100
beats/min), tachypnea (respiratory rate >24 breaths/
min), fever (oral temperature >38 °C), and abnormal
findings on a chest examination (rales, egophony, or
tactile fremitus) (10, 27).
Appropriate Management Strategies
The most recent clinical guidelines for manage-
ment of acute uncomplicated bronchitis recommended
against routine antibiotic treatment in the absence of
pneumonia (11). A systematic review of 15 randomized,
controlled trials found limited evidence to support the
use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis and a trend to-
ward increased adverse events in patients treated with
antibiotics (28). A randomized, placebo-controlled trial
(not included in the Cochrane review) comparing
ibuprofen, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, and placebo

 showed no significant differences in the number of
days to cough resolution (24). Although macrolides
(azithromycin) are frequently prescribed for patients
with a cough, one study showed that patients with
acute bronchitis treated with a macrolide had signifi-
cantly more adverse events than those receiving pla-
cebo (29).
Patients may benefit from symptomatic relief with
cough suppressants (dextromethorphan or codeine),
expectorants (guaifenesin), first-generation antihista-
mines (diphenhydramine), decongestants (phenyleph-
rine), and �-agonists (albuterol), although data to sup-
port specific therapies are limited. �-Agonists have not
been shown to benefit patients without asthma or
chronic obstructive lung disease (30), and symptomatic
therapy has not been shown to shorten the duration of
illness (30, 31). Over-the-counter symptomatic relief
has a low incidence of minor adverse effects, including
nausea, vomiting, headache, and drowsiness (32). Pro-
viders and patients must weigh the benefits and poten-
tial for adverse effects when considering symptomatic
therapy.
High-Value Care Advice 1
Clinicians should not perform testing or initiate
antibiotic therapy in patients with bronchitis unless
pneumonia is suspected.
PHARYNGITIS
Pharyngitis is usually a benign, self-limited illness
characterized by a sore throat that is worse with swal-
lowing, with or without associated constitutional symp-
toms. It is a common outpatient condition, with about
12 million visits representing 1% to 2% of all ambula-
tory care visits in the United States annually (33). Al-
though antibiotics are usually unnecessary, they are
prescribed at most visits for pharyngitis (34).
Determining the Likelihood of a Bacterial
Infection
Most pharyngitis cases have a viral origin; common
causes include rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, her-
pes simplex virus, parainfluenza, enterovirus, Epstein–
Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and influenza (35). Patients
with a sore throat and associated symptoms, including
cough, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis, hoarseness, di-
arrhea, or oropharyngeal lesions (ulcers or vesicles),
are more likely to have a viral illness and should not
have further testing. Providers must rule out group A
Streptococcus, the predominant bacterial pathogen,
and exclude more serious infections (13). Patients with
symptoms suggesting a bacterial cause should be
tested for group A Streptococcus with a rapid antigen
detection test, throat culture, or both. Suspicious symp-
toms include persistent fever, rigors, night sweats, ten-
der lymph nodes, tonsillopharyngeal exudates, scarla-
tiniform rash, palatal petechiae, and swollen tonsils.
Clinical scoring criteria have been developed to
help determine the likelihood of a bacterial cause. The
most widely used are the modified Centor criteria,
which include fever by history, tonsillar exudates, ten-
der anterior cervical adenopathy, and absence of
cough (36). Because the Centor criteria have a low pos-
itive predictive value for determining the presence of
group A streptococcal infection, the IDSA suggests that
they can be used to identify patients who have a low
probability of group A streptococcal pharyngitis and
do not warrant further testing (13). Patients who meet
fewer than 3 Centor criteria do not need to be tested.
Those who present with unusually severe signs and
symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing, drooling, neck
tenderness, or swelling, should be evaluated for rare
throat
infections
(such
as
peritonsillar
abscess,
parapharyngeal abscess, epiglottitis, or Lemierre syn-
drome).
Recent
data
suggest
that
Fusobacterium
necrophorum is implicated in approximately 10% to
20% of endemic pharyngitis cases in adolescents (37,

 38). It has also been implicated as a cause of Lemierre
syndrome (39), which is a rare and life-threatening con-
dition. The role of F necrophorum in pharyngitis and
subsequent development of Lemierre syndrome war-
rant further study. Routine testing for F necrophorum is
not recommended, but clinicians should remain vigi-
lant and suspect Lemierre syndrome in adolescent and
young adult patients with severe pharyngitis. Urgent di-
agnosis and treatment of Lemierre syndrome is neces-
sary to preclude complications and death. Other rare
bacterial causes are listed in the Table. No rapid diag-
nostic tests for other bacterial causes of pharyngitis ex-
ist, and the risks and benefits associated with antibiotic
treatment are unclear.
Appropriate Management Strategies
The 2012 IDSA clinical guidelines recommend an-
tibiotic therapy only for patients with a positive strepto-
coccal test result (13). Patients with confirmed acute
group A streptococcal pharyngitis should be treated
for a duration likely to eradicate group A Streptococcus
from the pharynx (usually 10 days) with an appropriate
narrow-spectrum
antibiotic.
Specific
regimens
are
listed in the Table.
Even though most pharyngitis cases are caused by
viruses, more than 60% of adults presenting with a sore
throat receive an antibiotic prescription (34). For pa-
tients diagnosed with group A streptococcal infection,

Disease/Condition
Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI)
Target Audience
Primary care providers, emergency medicine providers
Target Patient Population
Healthy adults
Intervention
Reduction in antibiotic prescriptions
Evidence That Using Antibiotics in Patients
With ARTI Does Not Improve Outcomes
Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that antibiotics are ineffective for most ARTIs. There is no 
   benefit for patients with the common cold or acute uncomplicated bronchitis and limited benefit for 
   patients diagnosed with bacterial rhinosinusitis.
   
Harms of Using Antibiotics
Annual direct costs are $6.5 billion and annual indirect costs are >$30 billion in the United States.
Antibiotics are responsible for 1 of every 5 emergency department visits for drug-related complications.
Complications occur in 5% to 25% of patients who use antibiotics.
Antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile is the most common serious complication,
   responsible for 29 300 deaths in the United States per year.
Approaches to Overcome Barriers to  
Evidence-Based Practice
Multidimensional approaches involving active clinician education work best to reduce antibiotic 
   prescriptions, including physician and patient education, physician audit and feedback, delayed 
   antibiotic prescriptions, health information technology, and financial or regulatory incentives.
Talking Points for Clinicians When Discussing
the Use of Antibiotics in Patients With ARTI
The average adult has 2 to 3 episodes of ARTI per year.
Symptoms usually resolve in 1 to 2 weeks, but cough can last up to 6 weeks.
Symptomatic treatment tailored to patient preferences may provide relief. 
Antibiotics do not cure most ARTIs or reduce time to resolution of symptoms.
Antibiotics cause many serious adverse effects and should be reserved for patients with confirmed 
   group A streptococcal pharyngitis. 
High-Value Care Advice
High-Value Care Advice 1: Clinicians should not perform testing or initiate antibiotic therapy in 
   patients with bronchitis unless pneumonia is suspected.
High-Value Care Advice 2: Clinicians should test patients with symptoms suggestive of group A
   streptococcal pharyngitis (for example, persistent fevers, anterior cervical adenitis, and 
   tonsillopharyngeal exudates or other appropriate combination of symptoms) by rapid antigen 
   detection test and/or culture for group A Streptococcus. Clinicians should treat patients with 
   antibiotics only if they have confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis.
High-Value Care Advice 3: Clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis for 
   patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days, onset of severe symptoms or signs of 
   high fever (>39 °C) and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive 
   days, or onset of worsening symptoms following a typical viral illness that lasted 5 days that 
   was initially improving (double sickening).
High-Value Care Advice 4: Clinicians should not prescribe antibiotics for patients with the common
   cold.

 antibiotics shorten the duration of sore throat by 1 to 2
days, but the benefit is modest and the number
needed to treat to reduce symptoms is 6 after 3 days of
treatment and 21 after 1 week of treatment (40). Evi-
dence suggests that antibiotics may prevent complica-
tions from group A streptococcal infection, including
acute rheumatic fever (which is more common in chil-
dren and adolescents than adults), peritonsillar ab-
scess, and further spread of group A Streptococcus in
outbreaks (40). However, little evidence supports the
prevention of acute glomerulonephritis (40). Antibiotics
are not recommended for chronic group A Streptococ-
cus carriers because they are unlikely to spread infec-
tion to close contacts and are at little or no risk for
complications. Tonsillectomy solely to reduce the fre-
quency of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in adults is
not recommended (13).
Adult patients with sore throat should be offered
analgesic therapy, such as aspirin, acetaminophen,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and throat loz-
enges, which can help reduce pain. Salt water, viscous
lidocaine, and other mixtures are often used in clinical
practice for topical pain relief, but there are few data
examining these approaches. Patients can be assured
that the typical course of a sore throat is less than 1
week and that antibiotics are usually not needed be-
cause they do little to alleviate symptoms and may have
adverse effects (12, 13, 40).
High-Value Care Advice 2
Clinicians should test patients with symptoms sug-
gestive of group A streptococcal pharyngitis (for exam-
ple, persistent fevers, anterior cervical adenitis, and
tonsillopharyngeal exudates or other appropriate com-
bination of symptoms) by rapid antigen detection test
and/or culture for group A Streptococcus. Clinicians
should treat patients with antibiotics only if they have
confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis.
ACUTE RHINOSINUSITIS
Acute rhinosinusitis is usually a self-limited illness
resulting from a viral infection, allergy, or irritant that
causes inflammation of the mucosal tissue in the nasal
and paranasal sinus cavity. Clinical symptoms include
nasal congestion and obstruction, purulent nasal dis-
charge, maxillary tooth pain, facial pain or pressure, fe-
ver, fatigue, cough, hyposmia or anosmia, ear pressure
or fullness, headache, and halitosis. Symptom duration
ranges from 1 to 33 days, with most episodes resolving
within a week (41). More than 4.3 million adults are
diagnosed with sinusitis annually, and more than 80%
of ambulatory care visits result in an antibiotic prescrip-
tion, most commonly a macrolide (42). Most antibiotic
prescriptions for this condition are unnecessary (43).
Determining the Likelihood of a Bacterial
Infection
Acute rhinosinusitis is usually caused by a viral
pathogen. Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is con-
sidered to be a secondary infection resulting from ob-
struction of the sinus ostia that leads to impaired mu-
cosal clearance as a result of a viral upper respiratory
tract infection (URI). Fewer than 2% of viral URIs Al-
thoughare complicated by ABRS (14). The gold stan-
dard for diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis is sinus punc-
ture with aspiration of purulent secretions, although it is
rarely performed. Common bacteria isolated from sinus
puncture are listed in the Table. Radiographic imaging
has no role in ascertaining a bacterial cause (14, 44).
radiologic findings, such as mucous membrane thick-
ening or sinus fluid or opacity, have a sensitivity of 90%
in detecting a bacterial cause, the specificity is only
61% (44). Imaging is not helpful in guiding treatment
because viral and bacterial causes have similar radio-
logic features, and it would increase costs by at least
4-fold (44).
Because ABRS lacks a simple and accurate diag-
nostic test, clinical guidelines recommend using clinical
signs and symptoms to differentiate bacterial from viral
causes (15). A bacterial cause is more likely when symp-
toms persist for more than 10 days without clinical im-
provement, symptoms are severe (fever >39 °C, puru-
lent nasal discharge, or facial pain lasting for >3
consecutive days), or symptoms worsen after an initial
period of improvement (double sickening) for more
than 3 days. In addition, a patient with new-onset fever,
headache, or increased nasal discharge after a typical
viral URI that was initially improving is suspicious for a
bacterial cause.
Appropriate Management Strategies
The 2012 IDSA clinical practice guidelines recom-
mend empirical antibiotics as soon as a clinical diagno-
sis of ABRS is established on the basis of clinical criteria
(15). Amoxicillin–clavulanate is the preferred agent,
and doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone may
be used as an alternative in patients with ABRS. The
American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck
Surgery emphasizes watchful waiting (without antibiotic
therapy) as initial management for all patients with un-
complicated ABRS, regardless of severity (16). Some
professional societies, including the American Acad-
emy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the Ameri-
can Academy of Family Physicians, recommend amoxi-
cillin as the preferred agent (17, 18). Although the IDSA
recommendation is based on concern for antibiotic re-
sistance, specifically ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus
influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, no direct evidence
suggests that amoxicillin–clavulanate is superior. Ad-
junctive therapy, such as intranasal saline irrigation or
intranasal corticosteroids, has been shown to alleviate
symptoms and potentially decrease antibiotic use (15).
Patients who are seriously ill, who deteriorate clinically
despite antibiotic therapy, or who have recurrent epi-
sodes should be referred to a specialist (for example,
an otolaryngologist, infectious disease specialist, or al-
lergist) (15).
Acute uncomplicated rhinosinusitis is a self-limited
infection that usually resolves without antibiotics, even
in patients with a bacterial cause. Most patients diag-
nosed with acute rhinosinusitis have more adverse ef-
fects than benefits from antibiotics (45). A meta-analysis

 of adults with acute rhinosinusitis showed that the num-
ber needed to treat was 18 for 1 patient to be cured
rapidly, but the number needed to harm from adverse
effects from antibiotics was 8 (45).
Most patients with acute rhinosinusitis should be
managed with supportive care (16); analgesics may be
offered for pain, and antipyretics may be offered for
fever. Additional therapies that may provide symptom-
atic relief include systemic or topical decongestants,
saline nasal irrigation, mucolytics, intranasal corticoste-
roids, and antihistamines tailored to the patient'
s
symptoms.
High-Value Care Advice 3
Clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for
acute rhinosinusitis for patients with persistent symp-
toms for more than 10 days, onset of severe symptoms
or signs of high fever (>39 °C) and purulent nasal dis-
charge or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive
days, or onset of worsening symptoms following a typi-
cal viral illness that lasted 5 days that was initially im-
proving (double sickening).
COMMON COLD (NONSPECIFIC UPPER
RESPIRATORY INFECTION)
The common cold, a benign, self-limited illness, is
the most common acute illness in the United States
(19). It is a mild upper respiratory viral illness that may
include some or all of the following symptoms: sneez-
ing, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, low-grade fever,
headache, and malaise. The symptoms are dependent
on the host'
s inflammatory response to the particular
viral infection (23). Complications of the common cold
include acute bacterial sinusitis, asthma exacerbation,
and otitis media; antibiotics play no role in preventing
these complications (19, 46). There are about 37 million
(3%) ambulatory care visits each year for the common
cold, and roughly 30% result in an antibiotic prescrip-
tion (47).
Causes
Multiple viruses have been associated with the
common cold (Table). These viruses demonstrate sea-
sonality and are spread through various routes of trans-
mission: direct hand contact, contact with a contami-
nated environmental surface, or airborne droplets after
an infected person sneezes or coughs (48). The most
efficient means of transmission is direct hand contact;
thus, the best method to reduce spread is appropriate
handwashing.
Appropriate Management Strategies
Clinical guidelines state that symptomatic therapy
is the appropriate management strategy for the com-
mon cold and that antibiotics should not be prescribed
because they are not effective and lead to significantly
increased risk for adverse effects (9, 19, 49). Patients
seeking medical advice for the common cold should be
advised that symptoms can last up to 2 weeks and
should be advised to follow up with the clinician if
symptoms worsen or exceed the expected time of re-
covery (9, 19, 49). They should also be apprised of the
risks and benefits of symptomatic therapy and should
be assured that antibiotics are not needed and may
have adverse effects.
Symptomatic therapy is recommended for man-
agement of common cold symptoms. Although antihis-
tamines have more adverse effects than benefits when
used alone, 1 out of 4 patients treated with combina-
tion
antihistamine–analgesic–decongestant
products
has significant symptom relief (50). Other symptomatic
treatments that may offer relief include inhaled ipratro-
pium bromide, inhaled cromolyn sodium, antitussives,
and analgesics. Zinc supplements have been shown to
reduce the duration of common cold symptoms in
healthy persons if administered less than 24 hours after
symptom
onset;
however,
their
potential
benefits
should be weighed against adverse reactions, such as
nausea and bad taste (51, 52). No evidence supports
the use of vitamins and herbal remedies, such as vita-
min C or echinacea (53, 54).
High-Value Care Advice 4
Clinicians should not prescribe antibiotics for pa-
tients with the common cold.
DOES PRACTICE FOLLOW THE EVIDENCE?
Antibiotic prescribing for ARTI has decreased since
the 1990s according to the National Ambulatory Med-
ical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey, but the greatest reductions have
been seen for ambulatory care visits for children (8, 55).
This may be a result of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention'
s “Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics
Work” campaign and program, as well as efforts by
state and local health departments to promote appro-
priate antibiotic use, especially among parents and
providers who care for children (56–58). Furthermore,
introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
for children has led to decreases in pneumococcal dis-
ease burden in both children and adults (59). Despite
improvements, antibiotics are often prescribed for
adults
when
they
are
not
indicated,
and
broad-
spectrum agents are prescribed at 61% of visits that
lead to an antibiotic prescription even though a
narrow-spectrum agent is usually preferred (1).
HOW CAN CLINICIANS PROMOTE APPROPRIATE
ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIPTION?
Over the past 2 decades, many interventions have
been shown to decrease inappropriate antibiotic use
by targeting physicians, patients, or both, including
education, physician audit and feedback, delayed pre-
scribing strategies, financial incentives, and health in-
formation technologies. Concern over patient satisfac-
tion scores may limit the success of these interventions
given that patient pressure plays a role in antibiotic
overprescribing (60). However, patient satisfaction de-
pends more on the patient-centered quality of the en-
counter, such as the provider spending enough time

 with the patient to explain the patient'
s illness, than on
the receipt of an antibiotic prescription (61).
To increase patient satisfaction and decrease anti-
biotic prescriptions for ARTI, we offer the following
evidence-based strategies. Clinicians can promote ap-
propriate antibiotic use by labeling acute bronchitis as
a “chest cold” or “viral upper respiratory infection” (62)
and providing patient information sheets about appro-
priate antibiotic use and alternatives to antibiotics for
managing symptoms (www.cdc.gov/getsmart) (63). A
recent study showed an 85% decrease in antibiotic pre-
scribing for ARTI and increased satisfaction ratings
when providers gave advice on symptomatic therapy
and explained why antibiotics were not needed for
ARTI (64). A symptomatic prescription pad can be used
to
provide
recommendations
for
management
of
symptoms, allowing patients to walk away with a plan of
action
(Supplement,
available
at
www.annals.org).
When it is unclear whether an antibiotic is needed, de-
layed or postdated antibiotic prescriptions (also known
as the wait-and-see approach) offer the possibility of
future antibiotic treatment if the condition does not im-
prove. This approach has also been shown to increase
patient satisfaction and decrease antibiotic use (65).
Reducing
antibiotic
prescriptions
on
a
large
scale will require a multidimensional approach. A
community-level, randomized trial in Massachusetts
showed that implementing a multichannel intervention
that includes targeting physician behavior, small-group
education, disseminating educational materials to the
community, and providing provider prescribing feed-
back in various settings further decreases antibiotic
prescription rates (66). A systematic review of 39 stud-
ies showed that multifaceted interventions that com-
bine physician, patient, and public education in various
settings are most effective (67). In addition to educa-
tion, examples of provider-level interventions that have
been shown to be effective include audit and feedback
and clinical decision support (68, 69). Although it is ev-
eryone'
s responsibility to use antibiotics appropriately,
providers have the power to control prescriptions. Re-
ducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing will im-
prove quality of care, decrease health care costs, and
preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics.
