The experience of burnout has been the focus of much research during the past few decades. Measures have been developed, as have various
theoretical models, and research studies from many countries have contributed to a better understanding of the causes and consequences of
this occupationally-specific dysphoria. The majority of this work has focused on human service occupations, and particularly health care.
Research on the burnout experience for psychiatrists mirrors much of the broader literature, in terms of both sources and outcomes of burn-
out. But it has also identified some of the unique stressors that mental health professionals face when they are dealing with especially difficult
or violent clients. Current issues of particular relevance for psychiatry include the links between burnout and mental illness, the attempts to
redefine burnout as simply exhaustion, and the relative dearth of evaluative research on potential interventions to treat and/or prevent burn-
out. Given that the treatment goal for burnout is usually to enable people to return to their job, and to be successful in their work, psychiatry
could make an important contribution by identifying the treatment strategies that would be most effective in achieving that goal.

For many years, burnout has been recognized as an occupa-
tional hazard for various people-oriented professions, such as
human services, education, and health care. The therapeutic
or service relationships that such providers develop with recip-
ients require an ongoing and intense level of personal, emo-
tional contact. Although such relationships can be rewarding
and engaging, they can also be quite stressful.
Within such occupations, the prevailing norms are to be self-
less and put others’ needs first; to work long hours and do what-
ever it takes to help a client or patient or student; to go the extra
mile and to give one’s all. Moreover, the organizational environ-
ments for these jobs are shaped by various social, political, and
economic factors (such as funding cutbacks or policy restrictions)
that result in work settings that are high in demands and low in
resources. Recently, as other occupations have become more
oriented to “high-touch” customer service, the phenomenon of
burnout has become relevant for these jobs as well1.
DEFINING BURNOUT
Burnout is a psychological syndrome emerging as a pro-
longed response to chronic interpersonal stressors on the job.
The three key dimensions of this response are an overwhelm-
ing exhaustion, feelings of cynicism and detachment from the
job, and a sense of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplish-
ment. The significance of this three-dimensional model is that
it clearly places the individual stress experience within a social
context and involves the person’s conception of both self and
others.
The initial research on burnout was exploratory and relied pri-
marily on qualitative techniques. Because the earliest researchers
came from social and clinical psychology, they gravitated toward
relevant ideas from these fields. The social perspective utilized
concepts involving interpersonal relations, i.e. how people per-
ceive and respond to others; these included detached concern,
dehumanization in self-defense, and attribution processes. It
also brought in concepts of motivation and emotion (and espe-
cially coping with emotional arousal). The clinical perspective
also dealt with motivation and emotion, but framed these
more in terms of psychological disorders, such as depression.
Subsequent researchers came from industrial-organizational
psychology, and this perspective emphasized work attitudes
and behaviors. It was also at this point that burnout was con-
ceptualized as a form of job stress, but the primary focus was
on the organizational context and less on the physical charac-
teristics of the experienced stress.
What emerged from this descriptive work were the three
dimensions of the burnout experience. The exhaustion dimen-
sion was also described as wearing out, loss of energy, deple-
tion, debilitation, and fatigue. The cynicism dimension was
originally called depersonalization (given the nature of human
services occupations), but was also described as negative or
inappropriate attitudes towards clients, irritability, loss of ide-
alism, and withdrawal. The inefficacy dimension was original-
ly called reduced personal accomplishment, and was also
described as reduced productivity or capability, low morale,
and an inability to cope.
Assessment of burnout
As the characteristics of burnout became more clearly iden-
tified, the next step was to develop measures that could assess
them. Various measures were proposed, based on different
assumptions about burnout, and many of them relied on the

 face validity of the measurement items or statements. The first
burnout measure that was based on a comprehensive program
of psychometric research was the Maslach Burnout Inventory
(MBI)2,3. The MBI was specifically designed to assess the three
dimensions of the burnout experience which had emerged
from the earlier qualitative research. It has been considered
the standard tool for research in this field, and has been trans-
lated and validated in many languages4. In contrast, other ini-
tial measures of burnout focused only on the dimension of
exhaustion5,6.
This distinction between measures that assess several dimen-
sions of burnout, and those that assess the sole dimension of
exhaustion, continues to the present day, and reflects differ-
ent conceptualizations of burnout. For example, the Bergen
Burnout Inventory (BBI)7 assesses three dimensions of burn-
out: exhaustion at work, cynicism toward the meaning of
work, and sense of inadequacy at work. The Oldenburg Burn-
out Inventory (OLBI)8 assesses the two dimensions of ex-
haustion and disengagement from work. Other burnout
measures focus on exhaustion alone, although they differen-
tiate between various aspects of exhaustion. For example, the
Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM)9 distinguishes
between physical fatigue, emotional exhaustion, and cogni-
tive weariness; and the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory
(CBI)10 makes a distinction between physical and psycho-
logical exhaustion.
There have been other changes and modifications of burn-
out measures over the years. Because the initial concern about
burnout emerged from caregiving occupations, such as health
care and human services, the measures developed in the 1980s
tended to reflect the experience of those professions. Later,
however, other occupational groups became interested in the
occurrence of burnout, but had some difficulties in adapting
the existing measures to their work situation. For the MBI, the
solution was the development of a General Survey that could
be used within any occupation (MBI-GS)11. Not only were
various items revised to be more “occupation-neutral”, but the
dimension of depersonalization (which was more specific to
human services) was broadened to refer to a negative detach-
ment from work and was renamed cynicism, and the dimension
of personal accomplishment was broadened and renamed
professional efficacy. More recent burnout measures utilized
more occupation-neutral wording from the outset.
However, some measures also added some new dimensions
to the concept of burnout. For example, the Spanish Burnout
Inventory consists of four dimensions: enthusiasm towards
the job, psychological exhaustion, indolence, and guilt12.
Meanwhile, some researchers were concerned that the more
neutral wording meant a loss of the specific interpersonal
issues for human service workers, so they developed a new
measure of interpersonal strain13. It remains an open question
whether these additional elements are essential components
of burnout per se, or whether they assess experiences or condi-
tions that often accompany the experience of burnout.
Engagement
An important development, at the beginning of the 21st
century, has been that researchers have tried to broaden their
understanding of burnout by extending their attention to its
positive antithesis. This positive state has been identified as
“engagement”. Although there is general agreement that
engagement with work represents a productive and fulfilling
state within the occupational domain, there are differences in
its definition.
For some burnout researchers, engagement is considered to
be the opposite of burnout and is defined in terms of the same
three dimensions as burnout, but the positive end of those
dimensions rather than the negative. From this perspective,
engagement consists of a state of high energy, strong involve-
ment, and a sense of efficacy14. By implication, engagement is
assessed by the opposite pattern of scores on the three MBI
dimensions.
However, a different approach has defined work engage-
ment as a persistent, positive affective-motivational state of
fulfillment that is characterized by the three components of
vigor, dedication, and absorption. In this view, work engage-
ment is an independent and distinct concept, which is not the
opposite of burnout (although it is negatively related to it). A
new measure, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES)15,
was developed to assess this positive state, and extensive
research has been carried out in the last decade16.
The relationship between burnout and engagement contin-
ues to be debated, however, and a recent approach has been
to use dialectical theory to synthesize conflicting views on the
two constructs, and to develop an alternate model17.
Conceptual models
There have been various conceptual models about the devel-
opment of burnout and its subsequent impact. At first, the
focus was on the relationship between the three dimensions of
burnout, which was often described in sequential stages.
Exhaustion was assumed to develop first, in response to high
demands and overload, and then this would precipitate detach-
ment and negative reactions to people and the job (depersonal-
ization or cynicism). If this continued, then the next stage
would be feelings of inadequacy and failure (reduced personal
accomplishment or professional inefficacy).
More recently, burnout models have been based on theories
about job stress, and the notion of imbalances leading to
strain. The first such model was the transactional one, which
served as the conceptual bridge between sequential stages and
imbalances18. Its three stages are: a) job stressors (an imbal-
ance between work demands and individual resources), b)
individual strain (an emotional response of exhaustion and
anxiety), and c) defensive coping (changes in attitudes and
behavior, such as greater cynicism).
104

 Subsequently, two developmental models of the demands-
resources imbalance have emerged: the Job Demands-Resources
(JD-R) model and the Conservation of Resources (COR) model.
The JD-R model focuses on the notion that burnout arises
when individuals experience incessant job demands and have
inadequate resources available to address and to reduce those
demands19. The COR model follows a basic motivational theory
assuming that burnout arises as a result of persistent threats to
available resources20. When individuals perceive that the re-
sources they value are threatened, they strive to maintain those
resources. The loss of resources or even the impending loss of
resources may aggravate burnout. Both the JD-R and the COR
theory of burnout development have received confirmation in
research studies.
A different variation of an imbalance model of burnout is the
Areas of Worklife (AW) model, which frames job stressors in
terms of person-job imbalances, or mismatches, but identifies
six key areas in which these imbalances take place: workload,
control, reward, community, fairness, and values. Mismatches in
these areas affect an individual’s level of experienced burnout,
which in turn determines various outcomes, such as job perfor-
mance, social behaviors, and personal wellbeing. The greater is
the mismatch between the person and the job, the greater the
likelihood of burnout; conversely, the greater the match, the
greater the likelihood of engagement. Initial empirical support
for the AW model has been provided by both cross-sectional
and longitudinal studies21.
CAUSES AND OUTCOMES
Most models of burnout make explicit the causal theorizing
that has always been implicit in burnout research: certain factors
(both situational and individual) cause people to experience
burnout, and once burnout occurs, it causes certain outcomes
(both situational and individual). However, these causal assump-
tions have rarely been tested directly. Most research on burnout
has involved cross-sectional designs or studies using statistical
causal models. This correlational database has provided support
for many of the hypothesized links between burnout and its
sources and effects, but it is unable to address the presumed cau-
sality of those linkages. The recent increase in longitudinal stud-
ies is beginning to provide a better opportunity to test sequential
hypotheses, but stronger causal inferences will also require
appropriate methodological designs (and these are often difficult
to implement in applied settings). One other critical constraint is
that many of the variables have been assessed by self-report
measures (rather than other indices of behavior or health).
Over two decades of research on burnout have identified a
plethora of organizational risk factors across many occupations
in various countries22,23. Six key domains have been identified,
as mentioned earlier: workload, control, reward, community,
fairness, and values. The first two areas are reflected in the
Demand-Control model of job stress24.
Work overload contributes to burnout by depleting the
capacity of people to meet the demands of the job. When this
kind of overload is a chronic job condition, there is little
opportunity to rest, recover, and restore balance. A sustainable
and manageable workload, in contrast, provides opportunities
to use and refine existing skills as well as to become effective
in new areas of activity.
A clear link has been found between a lack of control and
burnout. On the contrary, when employees have the perceived
capacity to influence decisions that affect their work, to exer-
cise professional autonomy, and to gain access to the resour-
ces necessary to do an effective job, they are more likely to
experience job engagement.
The area of reward refers to the power of reinforcements to
shape behavior. Insufficient recognition and reward (whether
financial, institutional, or social) increases people’s vulnerabil-
ity to burnout, because it devalues both the work and the
workers, and is closely associated with feelings of inefficacy. In
contrast, consistency in the reward dimension between the
person and the job means that there are both material rewards
and opportunities for intrinsic satisfaction.
The area of community has to do with the ongoing relation-
ships that employees have with other people on the job. When
these relationships are characterized by a lack of support and
trust, and by unresolved conflict, then there is a greater risk of
burnout. On the contrary, when these job-related relationships
are working well, there is a great deal of social support,
employees have effective means of working out disagree-
ments, and they are more likely to experience job engagement.
The area of fairness emerges from the literature on equity
and social justice. Fairness is the extent to which decisions at
work are perceived as being fair and equitable. People use the
quality of the procedures, and their own treatment during
the decision-making process, as an index of their place in the
community. Cynicism, anger and hostility are likely to arise
when people feel they are not being treated with the appropri-
ate respect.
Finally, the area of values picks up the cognitive-emotional
power of job goals and expectations. Values are the ideals and
motivations that originally attracted people to their job, and
thus they are the motivating connection between the worker
and the workplace, which goes beyond the utilitarian exchange
of time for money or advancement. When there is a values
conflict on the job, and thus a gap between individual and
organizational values, employees will find themselves making
a trade-off between work they want to do and work they have
to do, and this can lead to greater burnout.
In terms of outcomes, burnout has been frequently associat-
ed with various forms of negative reactions and job withdrawal,
including job dissatisfaction, low organizational commitment,
absenteeism, intention to leave the job, and turnover23. For
example, cynicism has been found to be the pivotal aspect of
burnout to predict turnover25, and burnout mediates the rela-
tionship between being bullied in the workplace and the inten-
tion to quit the job26. On the other hand, for people who stay
World Psychiatry 15:2 - June 2016
105
 on the job, burnout leads to lower productivity and impaired
quality of work. As burnout diminishes opportunities for posi-
tive experiences at work, it is associated with decreased job
satisfaction and a reduced commitment to the job or the
organization.
People who are experiencing burnout can have a negative
impact on their colleagues, both by causing greater personal
conflict and by disrupting job tasks. Thus, burnout can be
“contagious” and perpetuate itself through social interactions
on the job27,28. The critical importance of social relationships
for burnout is underscored by studies that show that burnout
increases in work environments characterized by interperson-
al aggression29,30. Such findings suggest that burnout should
be considered as a characteristic of workgroups rather than
simply an individual syndrome.
Burnout has a complex pattern of relationships with health,
in that poor health contributes to burnout and burnout con-
tributes to poor health31. Of the three burnout dimensions,
exhaustion is the closest to an orthodox stress variable, and
therefore is more predictive of stress-related health outcomes
than the other two dimensions. Exhaustion is typically corre-
lated with such stress symptoms as headaches, chronic fatigue,
gastrointestinal disorders, muscle tension, hypertension, cold/
flu episodes, and sleep disturbances. These physiological cor-
relates mirror those found with other indices of prolonged
stress. Parallel findings have been found for the link between
burnout and substance abuse32.
A ten-year longitudinal study of industrial workers found
burnout to predict subsequent hospital admissions for cardio-
vascular problems33. Other research found that a one-unit
increase in burnout score was related to a 1.4 unit increase in
risk for hospital admission for mental health problems, as well
as a one-unit increase in risk for hospital admissions for car-
diovascular problems31. Other studies have provided a more
detailed examination of the link between burnout and cardio-
vascular disease, noting the role of high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein and fibrinogen concentrations in the link34.
BURNOUT IN PSYCHIATRY
To a large extent, the research literature on burnout in psy-
chiatry echoes those previous themes. Workplace variables
have been found to be more stressful for psychiatrists than
other factors, and thus may be more likely to perpetuate burn-
out35. These variables include too much work, long working
hours, chronic staff shortages, an aggressive administrative
environment, and lack of support from management. Poor
relationships with management and supervisors have also
been identified as related to burnout among psychiatry resi-
dents36. However, research has found mixed results with
regard to the role of job satisfaction in burnout, with some
studies reporting no relationship37,38, and other studies report-
ing that job satisfaction did play a role39,40.
The rate of burnout among those employed in the health
care field tends to be reported in the moderate to high levels,
and it is generally believed that the burnout risk in health care
is higher than in the general working population. Reported
burnout rates for psychiatrists are quite similar to this overall
trend41-43. Some studies have raised the possibility that psy-
chiatrists show an even more negative risk profile for burnout
than do other health care employees36,43,44. For example, one
study found that 89% of psychiatrists had either thought about
or experienced a clear threat of severe burnout45.
There are other critical risk factors that may be more unique
to the field of psychiatry. Chief among these is the working
relationship that psychiatrists, and other mental health profes-
sionals, have with clients who are experiencing psychological
trauma. The challenging demands posed by these and other
difficult clients can lead to greater stress and frustration
among psychiatrists, which in turn can fuel the exhaustion,
cynicism, and inefficacy of burnout. This process has also
been described in terms such as compassion fatigue, second-
ary traumatic stress, and vicarious traumatization46-48. The
burnout experience can become especially overwhelming
when the psychiatrist becomes the target of anger, hatred, and
even violence, as a result of negative transference49. Violent
incidents with patients can be emotionally draining and diffi-
cult to manage, and can lead health providers to psychologi-
cally distance themselves from their work. The occurrence of
violence can also make providers feel that they lack control
over their job, and thus challenge their sense of professional
efficacy.
Higher levels of burnout are correlated with more negative
feelings about patients50 and a poorer quality of patient care51.
This link between burnout and poor care is supported by re-
search on how burnout is manifested in psychiatrists, by changes
in appearance (e.g., look of fatigue), behavior (e.g., becoming
avoidant, making less eye contact), and mood (e.g., becoming
more irritable and agitated, communicating poorly). In addi-
tion, perfectionist and obsessive traits may perpetuate burnout,
particularly when the workload is heavy or stressful52.
Working with demanding patients and working with pa-
tients’ families have been found to be closely associated
with psychiatrists’ levels of exhaustion and depersonaliza-
tion35. These relationships reflect psychiatrists’ frustrations
with the limits of their craft. Contact with patients’ families
intensified these feelings, especially when family members
expressed unrealistic expectations for treatment. Psychia-
trists are emotionally drained by their inability to meet the
strenuous demands they put upon themselves, and the
demands inherent in their interactions with patients and
patients’ families. In contrast, diminished personal accom-
plishment reflects problematic relationships with superiors
and colleagues, rather than demands from patients. Colleagues
provide the most relevant source of information regarding one’s
sense of efficacy in professional life. When those relationships
are strained, it is difficult to find meaningful confirmation of
one’s job performance.
106

 Research on burnout has always recognized a central role
for social relationships in the development and resolution of
the syndrome. Initially, the research focus was primarily on
the therapeutic relationship between the provider and the ser-
vice recipient. Over time, studies have confirmed that relation-
ships with colleagues and supervisors are equally, if not more,
relevant to the potential for providers to experience burnout.
For example, recent research on attachment styles found that
attachment anxiety was accompanied by more frequent inci-
vility from colleagues, and was associated with more exhaus-
tion and cynicism. Attachment avoidance was linked to fewer
instances of positive social encounters at work, and was asso-
ciated with a greater sense of inefficacy53. In sum, negative
social interactions seem to drain energy and distance people
from their job, and the absence of positive social encounters is
discouraging.
CURRENT ISSUES
There are many interesting questions about burnout and
engagement which are being studied in many countries
around the world. A few inter-related themes should be of par-
ticular significance for the profession of psychiatry. First is the
question of the relationship between burnout and mental ill-
ness. Second is the question of the value of simplifying the
multi-dimensional construct of burnout to the single dimen-
sion of exhaustion. And third is the question of how best to
ameliorate burnout in terms of treatment and prevention.
Burnout and mental illness
When the construct of burnout was first proposed in the
1970s, there were arguments that it was not a distinctly differ-
ent phenomenon, but rather a new label for an already known
state – i.e., “old wine in a new bottle”. However, there were a
lot of differing opinions about what the “already known state”
actually was. These included job dissatisfaction, anomie, job
stress, anxiety, anger, depression, or some combination of
them54-56. For example, one psychoanalytic perspective ar-
gued that burnout was not distinguishable from either job
stress or depression, but represented a failure to achieve nar-
cissistic satisfaction in the pursuit of ideals57. As a result of
these critiques, subsequent research often focused on testing
the discriminant validity of burnout by assessing whether it
could be distinguished from these other phenomena. The
results of many studies have established that burnout is
indeed a distinct construct23.
Much of this prior discussion has focused on depression,
thus raising the question of whether burnout is a precipitating
factor for depression, and thus is a predictor for it, or whether
burnout is the same thing as depression, and thus is itself a
mental illness. Research has demonstrated that the two con-
structs are indeed distinct: burnout is job-related and situa-
tion-specific, as opposed to depression, which is more general
and context-free.
However, a recent article has renewed debate on the dis-
tinction between burnout and depression by claiming that at
high levels the two states are indistinguishable58. This position
is in contrast to the view that burnout is an occupationally-
specific dysphoria that is distinct from depression as a broadly
based mental illness22. But close examination of the new
research article reveals problems with its argument.
A necessary condition to examine the distinction between
burnout and depression is a set of measures that provide a
complete and accurate operationalization of each construct,
and the new study fell short of this criterion. Specifically, the
nine-item depression measure (Patient Health Questionnaire,
PHQ-959) used in this study includes five items that refer
explicitly to fatigue (lack of interest, trouble sleeping, trouble
concentrating, moving slowly, and feeling tired). The other
four items include one referring to loss of appetite and three
referring to negative thoughts (suicidal thoughts, feeling de-
pressed, negative self-evaluation). The measure produces a
single factor score; clearly that factor is heavily weighted
towards fatigue (Cronbach alpha of .88). It may be argued that
these nine items fail to capture the full complexity of clinical
depression. In any case, the depression construct operational-
ized in this measure is one dominated by fatigue, accompa-
nied by negative thoughts. To measure burnout, the study
used the SMBM9, which is a one-factor fatigue scale with items
referring explicitly to trouble concentrating, feeling tired, and
thinking in a slow, unfocused, and unclear manner. Although
conceptualized as representing three distinct factors of cogni-
tive, physical, and emotional fatigue, the measure consistently
reduces to a single factor of fatigue (Cronbach alpha of .96).
Given the overlap in the explicit reference of the two measures
to fatigue in the majority of their items, it is not surprising that
the two scales are correlated highly (r5.77)58.
The high correspondence of burnout and depression in this
new study reflects a large level of concept redundancy between
the SMBM and PHQ-9. The two instruments primarily measure
exhaustion, leading to a strong correspondence between them,
especially at high levels of exhaustion. The correlation was
especially high in this study; earlier research that used these
identical measures reported correlations at three different times
as .51, .53, and .5460. These results are consistent with other
research that finds that burnout and depression are inter-
related conditions.
Research using the MBI departs further from depression
measures in its three-component definition of the syndrome as
exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy. Some studies that have
used the MBI and different measures of depression have found
the following range of correlations. The Profile of Mood States
(POMS) depression scale correlated with the MBI - Human
Services Survey (MBI-HSS) exhaustion (r5.33), depersonaliza-
tion (r5.30), and personal accomplishment (r52.14)61. The
Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) depression subscale
World Psychiatry 15:2 - June 2016
107
 correlated with the MBI-GS exhaustion (r5.37), cynicism
(r5.47), and efficacy (r52.21)62. The Beck negative emotions
and attitudes subscale correlated with the MBI-GS exhaustion
(r5.46) and cynicism (r5.28), and the Beck performance diffi-
culties and somatic complaints subscale correlated with MBI-
GS exhaustion (r5.61) and cynicism (r5.36)63.
The wide range of correlations between burnout and depres-
sion argues for a complex relationship between the two con-
structs. Clearly, they are linked to each other. For example, one
study found that 90% of the respondents with severe burnout
(i.e., daily occurrence of burnout symptoms) reported a physi-
cal or mental disease, with musculoskeletal pain and depres-
sion as the most common problems64. A longitudinal study
found that increases in burnout predicted increases in subse-
quent prescriptions of antidepressant medication65.
A new understanding of this linkage comes from a recent
longitudinal study in Finland, which found a reciprocal rela-
tionship between burnout and depression, with each predict-
ing subsequent developments in the other. It was noteworthy
that burnout fully mediated the relationship of workplace
strains with depression: when problems at work contribute to
depression, experiencing burnout is a step in the process66.
These studies confirm that burnout and depression are not
independent. Each state has implications for the other. How-
ever, that relationship is far from saying that burnout and
depression are the same mental illness.
Single or multiple dimensions
Although the original construct acknowledged exhaustion
as a key aspect of burnout, it argued that exhaustion is not the
whole story. Indeed, if burnout were solely exhaustion, then
the word “burnout” would be unnecessary, as it would not be
providing any added value. “Exhaustion” would suffice. To
rename “exhaustion” as “burnout” would definitely be inviting
the criticism of “putting old wine in new bottles”.
And yet, that simplification of burnout to exhaustion has
been taking place not only among researchers, but also among
practitioners. The driving force seems to be the goal of estab-
lishing a clinical diagnosis for burnout, so that health profession-
als can then receive reimbursement for treating individuals
suffering from that condition.
This shift to defining and diagnosing burnout as an individ-
ual disorder or disability has been taking place in Northern
Europe, primarily in Sweden and the Netherlands. There,
burnout has been likened to neurasthenia or other syndromes
with a quality of chronic fatigue. Sweden began using work-
related neurasthenia as a burnout diagnosis in 1997; soon, that
was within the five most frequent diagnoses67. Researchers
developed a similar diagnosis in the Netherlands, using clini-
cally validated cut-off scores on the MBI68.
To provide more precise diagnostic direction, Sweden in
2005 revised the ICD-10 burnout diagnosis (Z73.0) as a diffi-
culty in life management characterized by “vital exhaustion”.
The signs of vital exhaustion include two weeks of daily experi-
ences of low energy, with difficulties in concentration, irritabil-
ity, emotional instability, dizziness, and sleep difficulties.
Additionally, these symptoms must interfere with the patients’
capacity to perform their work responsibilities.
In the Netherlands, the term overspannenheid or “overstrain”
is used to indicate burnout. This diagnostic approach estimates
burnout prevalence at 3-7% across various occupations, with
psychotherapists at 4%69. In terms of MBI scores, Dutch
researchers recommended that a burnout diagnosis should be
connected with very negative scores on exhaustion accompa-
nied by negative scores on one of the other two subscales (cyni-
cism and inefficacy)70,71.
The use of burnout as a medical diagnosis implies one-
dimensionality, and it is clear that exhaustion has emerged as
that single dimension. Moreover, since 1997, the Dutch census
bureau has been assessing “burnout” among the working pop-
ulation by using an index of work-related exhaustion (that is
based on the MBI) in its annual national survey. As a conse-
quence, public discourse about burnout in the Netherlands is
increasingly limited to exhaustion alone. The risk is that a
focus on just exhaustion (and its connection to work overload)
will miss the distinct quality of burnout as reflecting a crisis of
meaning or values. The exhaustion dimension captures the
problem of lacking sufficient energy to make a useful and
enduring contribution at work. But it is the cynicism dimen-
sion that captures the difficulty in dealing with other people
and activities in the work world. Furthermore, efficacy cap-
tures the core self-evaluation people make regarding the value
of their work and the quality of their contribution. To ignore
these core aspects of the burnout experience would truly be a
“mis-diagnosis” that could have important ramifications for
both policy and practice.
It is interesting that North American jurisdictions have been
reluctant to recognize burnout as a clinical diagnosis, partially
due to concerns about a flood of requests for disability cover-
age. The lack of an official diagnosis of burnout limits access
to treatment, disability coverage, and workplace accommoda-
tions. Alternatively, disability applications have referred to
depression, neurasthenia, or chronic fatigue. An unfortunate
consequence is that inaccurate diagnoses may reduce possi-
bilities for successful recovery and return to work.
New research has begun to focus on an innovative use of
the three burnout dimensions, which allows for multiple dis-
tinct patterns along the burnout-engagement continuum. In
addition to the two standard endpoint patterns of Burnout
(high on all three dimensions) and Engagement (low on all
three dimensions), this approach can identify people who are
only experiencing one of the dimensions, rather than all of
them72. A particularly relevant comparison is between people
with the complete Burnout profile and those with only high
exhaustion (the Overextended profile). The research findings
show that these two patterns are decidedly different in terms
of their workplace experience, so it is clear that exhaustion
alone is not a proxy for burnout. Instead, the profile that

World Psychiatry 15:2 - June 2016
 comes closer to the negative endpoint of Burnout is the
cynicism-only one (Disengaged profile), which suggests that
the experience of cynicism may be more of a core part of burn-
out than exhaustion. Cynicism is more clearly linked to the job
environment, in terms of the poor quality of social relation-
ships at work and the lack of critical resources, and that will
lead to reduced job satisfaction and poor job performance73.
Treatment and prevention
The personal and organizational costs of burnout have led
to proposals for various intervention strategies. Some try to
treat burnout after it has occurred, while others focus on how
to prevent burnout by promoting engagement. Intervention
may occur on the level of the individual, workgroup, or an
entire organization. In general, the primary emphasis has
been on individual strategies, rather than social or organiza-
tional ones, despite the research evidence for the primary role
of situational factors.
Many of these individual strategies have been adapted from
other work done on stress, coping, and health. The most com-
mon recommendations have included: a) changing work pat-
terns (e.g., working less, taking more breaks, avoiding overtime
work, balancing work with the rest of one’s life); b) developing
coping skills (e.g., cognitive restructuring, conflict resolution,
time management); c) obtaining social support (both from
colleagues and family); d) utilizing relaxation strategies; e) pro-
moting good health and fitness; and f) developing a better self-
understanding (via various self-analytic techniques, counseling,
or therapy)74.
Initiatives to moderate workload demands complemented
by improvements in recovery strategies through better sleep,
exercise, and nutrition have direct relevance to the exhaustion
component of burnout. Cynicism, in contrast, pertains more
directly to a sense of community or to the congruence of per-
sonal and workplace values. For example, an intervention that
improved workplace civility among health care providers
showed that cynicism declined as a function of improved civil-
ity75, and that this change was sustained at a one-year follow-
up assessment76. A sense of efficacy, in contrast, could be
more responsive to improvements in the forms of recognition
from colleagues and leaders within an organization or the pro-
fession. An alternative proposal has been that people can
make various changes in how they do their job (a process
known as “job crafting”), and that such job alterations could
lead to less burnout77.
Unfortunately, there is very little research that has evaluat-
ed the efficacy of any of these approaches in reducing the risk
of burnout. Especially rare are studies modeled even loosely
on randomized control trials. More common are studies with
a single intervention group of volunteer participants for
whom there are rarely follow-up assessments after treatment
has ended78. It is not yet clear whether burnout is generally
susceptible to a range of strategies or whether it is crucial to
fit the strategy to the specific context of a workplace to be effec-
tive.
The same basic points can be made about studies examin-
ing interventions specific to psychiatrists. There have been
several recommendations about possible interventions, but no
thorough research on whether these ideas are viable solutions.
One fairly common recommendation emphasizes the impor-
tance of various forms of support, such as peer support
groups, formal support via regular feedback and performance
evaluation, or the use of a community-based approach in the
work environment. Interestingly, medical students and resi-
dents have also identified support as a critical factor, including
support from faculty, peers, outside personal relationships,
and counseling services79.
Another suggestion involves having psychiatrists evaluate
their workload frequently, to ensure they are not putting them-
selves at additional risk for burnout. A related recommenda-
tion is that psychiatrists should develop a more versatile
lifestyle, in which they diversify their work (e.g., take on a part-
time teaching job, do some writing, or extend one’s practice to
other types of clients) and/or engage in activities outside of
work (such as hobbies and other personal interests).
Mental health professionals who have worked in the areas
of trauma and palliative care have made additional recom-
mendations on how to deal with burnout80,81. Notably, one
approach emphasizes the need to take care of oneself – and
not only in terms of personal health and physical fitness, but
also in terms of psychological wellbeing. Professionals who
deal with trauma survivors are encouraged to work through
their own personal traumatic experiences in order to prevent
becoming “wounded healers” or secondarily traumatized ther-
apists. Professionals working in hospice and palliative medi-
cine are encouraged to focus on spirituality and human
nature, via prayer, meditation, or religious services. Other
methods for self-care include taking regular breaks from work,
advocating for better social recognition of the difficult work
that is being accomplished, and focusing on the positive
aspects of life, both at work and home, so that one is not over-
whelmed by adversity and misery.
Although various studies have provided excellent ideas to
explore as interventions, the logistics of funding, designing,
implementing, and evaluating these ideas remain the primary
obstacles to better knowledge about the best solutions for
burnout. For example, a Swedish group contrasted two thera-
peutic modalities for people who had been on long-term leave
from work with a diagnosis of “work-related depression”. They
found that both cognitive group therapy and focused psycho-
dynamic group therapy were effective in facilitating their
return to work, but found no difference in effectiveness
between the two approaches82. This study raises two impor-
tant issues for further research. First, to what extent does
“work-related depression” map upon clinical depression, in
contrast to mapping upon burnout? Second, what are the
common qualities of the two therapeutic modalities that could
serve as mechanisms in treatment efficacy?

 CONCLUSIONS
Research to date indicates that the three aspects of burnout
do present challenges for psychiatrists. Many of the issues for
psychiatrists are similar to those facing other professionals
providing human services to people in need of help. But addi-
tionally, psychiatric work entails close contact with people in
emotional distress, and in some cases the potential for threats
from some of these patients. Both of these stressors make
demands on psychiatrists’ energy, their capacity for involve-
ment with others, and their sense of professional efficacy.
An issue of special significance to psychiatry is the align-
ment and differentiation of burnout and depression. The con-
cept of workplace depression as a basis for workers’ disability
coverage in some European countries raises important issues
for practitioners, which have extensive implications for em-
ployees, employers, and insurance providers. Research and
conceptual development that includes multidisciplinary par-
ticipation is needed for definitive progress.
Psychiatry is in a strong position to contribute to the growth
of knowledge regarding burnout. The question of burnout’s sta-
tus as a basis for disability claims requires precise and objective
assessment. Further, psychiatric-based treatments may be rele-
vant to burnout, especially regarding return to work for people
experiencing severe burnout. Finally, effective research on pre-
venting and alleviating aspects of burnout among psychiatrists
requires giving the issue a high priority within the profession.
