Background: Estimates of risk for radiation-induced breast can-
cer from mammography screening have not considered varia-
tion in dose exposure or diagnostic work-up after abnormal
screening results.
Objective: To estimate distributions of radiation-induced breast
cancer incidence and mortality from digital mammography
screening while considering exposure from screening and diag-
nostic mammography and dose variation among women.
Design: 2 simulation-modeling approaches.
Setting: U.S. population.
Patients: Women aged 40 to 74 years.
Intervention: Annual or biennial digital mammography screen-
ing from age 40, 45, or 50 years until age 74 years.
Measurements: Lifetime breast cancer deaths averted (bene-
fits) and radiation-induced breast cancer incidence and mortality
(harms) per 100 000 women screened.
Results: Annual screening of 100 000 women aged 40 to 74
years was projected to induce 125 breast cancer cases (95% CI,
88 to 178) leading to 16 deaths (CI, 11 to 23), relative to 968
breast cancer deaths averted by early detection from screening.
Women exposed at the 95th percentile were projected to de-
velop 246 cases of radiation-induced breast cancer leading to 32
deaths per 100 000 women. Women with large breasts requiring
extra views for complete examination (8% of population) were
projected to have greater radiation-induced breast cancer risk
(266 cancer cases and 35 deaths per 100 000 women) than
other women (113 cancer cases and 15 deaths per 100 000
women). Biennial screening starting at age 50 years reduced risk
for radiation-induced cancer 5-fold.
Limitation: Life-years lost from radiation-induced breast cancer
could not be estimated.
Conclusion: Radiation-induced breast cancer incidence and
mortality from digital mammography screening are affected by
dose variability from screening, resultant diagnostic work-up, ini-
tiation age, and screening frequency. Women with large breasts
may have a greater risk for radiation-induced breast cancer.

E
xposure to ionizing radiation from repeated mam-
mography examinations may increase breast cancer
risk (1, 2). Radiation-induced breast cancer incidence
and mortality associated with recommended screening
strategies are suggested to be low relative to breast
cancer deaths prevented (3–5). However, prior pro-
jected population risks were based on exposure from
screening only and assumed only 4 standard views per
screening examination at the mean radiation dose.
Evaluations of screening programs should consider
full episodes of care, including diagnostic work-up
prompted by an abnormal screening result (6). False-
positive recalls, breast biopsies, and short-interval
follow-up examinations are relatively common in the
United States and add radiation exposure from diag-
nostic mammography (7). Some subgroups of women,
such as obese women and those with dense breasts,
are more likely to have additional evaluations (7–9),
which may increase their risk for radiation-induced
cancer.
When risk for radiation-induced breast cancer is
being evaluated, it may also be important to consider
variation in radiation dose from a single examination.
Examinations vary in the number of views performed
and dose per view; therefore, some women receive
more than the mean dose. The American College of
Radiology Imaging Network DMIST (Digital Mammo-
graphic Imaging Screening Trial) found an average ra-
diation dose of 1.86 mGy to the breast from a single
digital mammography screening view (10), but dose
per view varied from 0.15 to 13.4 mGy (Supplement,
available
at
www.annals.org),
and
21%
of
digital
screening examinations used more than 4 views (10).
Radiation dose is strongly correlated with compressed
breast thickness; thus, women with large breasts tend
to receive greater doses per view and may require
more than 4 views for complete examination (10, 11).
Women with breast augmentation receive implant-
displacement views in addition to standard screening
views, which doubles their radiation dose (12). Women

 may have repeated views because of movement arti-
facts or improper breast positioning.
We estimated the distribution of cumulative radia-
tion dose and associated breast cancer risk from full
screening episodes to identify subgroups of women
who may have a greater risk for radiation-induced can-
cer because they have factors contributing to greater
doses
per
examination
or
frequent
false-positive
screening results that lead to additional radiation expo-
sure
from
subsequent
diagnostic
work-up.
Using
population-based data from the Breast Cancer Surveil-
lance Consortium (BCSC) (13), we estimated the prob-
ability of a false-positive screening result followed by
additional imaging evaluation, short-interval follow-up,
or biopsy. We used data from the BCSC, DMIST, and
other sources in 2 simulation models to estimate radia-
tion exposure and radiation-induced breast cancer in-
cidence and mortality associated with 8 potential
screening strategies with different starting ages (40, 45,
or 50 years) and screening intervals (annual, biennial,
or a hybrid strategy).
METHODS
Screening Strategies
We used 2 complementary stochastic modeling
approaches to evaluate the following 8 strategies for
screening with digital mammography: annual screen-
ing from age 40 to 74, 45 to 74, or 50 to 74 years;
biennial screening from age 40 to 74, 45 to 74, or 50 to
74 years; or a hybrid strategy of annual screening from
age 40 to 49 or 45 to 49 years followed by biennial
screening from age 50 to 74 years.
We included the hybrid strategies because more
frequent screening has been advocated for younger
and premenopausal women due to their greater prev-
alence of dense breasts and more aggressive tumors,
resulting in a greater risk for interval cancer, than older
women (14–17). Outcomes were breast cancer deaths
averted (benefits) and radiation-induced breast cancer
incidence and mortality (harms) associated with a life-
time
of
mammography
screening
relative
to
no
screening.
Simulation-Modeling Approaches
Figure 1 summarizes our approach. We used 2
complementary stochastic modeling approaches to
simulate mammography events associated with radia-
tion exposure and outcomes for a population adherent
with each of the 8 screening strategies. The first
approach
used
the
Microsimulation
of
Screening
Analysis–Fatal Diameter (MISCAN-Fadia) model (18),
which is a detailed natural history model of breast can-
cer. This approach provided estimates of breast cancer
incidence and mortality with and without screening to
contextualize estimates of radiation-induced breast
cancer cases. Although MISCAN-Fadia models the av-
erage effects of screening on a population level, it does
not model correlation among repeated mammography
results in individual women or the specific types of
work-up after an abnormal screening result; thus, it
cannot be used to estimate the distribution of cumula-
tive radiation exposure from both screening mammog-
raphy and subsequent diagnostic work-up among
women. Therefore, we developed a new simulation
model that provides woman-level exposure histories
that were not available from the MISCAN-Fadia model.
This new model captures exposure heterogeneity by
simulating
mammography
results
and
subsequent
work-up in each woman and allowing for variability in
radiation exposure and breast size.
MISCAN-Fadia Model
The MISCAN-Fadia model simulates individual life
histories of women with and without breast cancer in
the presence and absence of screening from birth to
death from breast cancer or other causes. The model
has been described in detail elsewhere (18), informa-
tion about the model can be found online (http://cisnet
.cancer.gov), and inputs and assumptions are de-
scribed in our report for the draft U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force recommendations (19). In brief, on
the basis of BCSC data on sensitivity of digital mam-
mography screening, cancer detection rates, and can-
cer stage at detection, we estimated thresholds at
which tumors become screen-detectable. Screening
sensitivity and specificity depended on age, breast
density, and screening interval. Breast cancer risk de-
pended on age and breast density. The effect of
screening on breast cancer natural history was as-
sessed by modeling continuous tumor growth, in which
tumors detected before they reached their fatal diam-
eter were cured and those detected past their fatal
EDITORS' NOTES
Context
Repeated digital mammography examinations expose
women to ionizing radiation that can increase breast
cancer risk.
Contribution
This modeling study found that annual mammography
screening of 100 000 women aged 40 to 74 years might
induce 125 breast cancer cases and 16 deaths but avert
968 breast cancer deaths because of early detection.
Factors associated with increased risk for radiation-
induced cancer included large breasts requiring extra
views, higher-than-average doses per view, beginning
screening at younger ages, and annual screening.
Caution
The model had several assumptions.
Implication
Biennial mammography screening starting at age 50
years and use of the fewest number of views possible
would decrease risk for radiation-induced breast cancer.

 diameter led to breast cancer death. We assumed that
all women received the mean dose per screening ex-
amination and, if recalled, the mean dose associated
with diagnostic work-up after a false-positive screening
result, both of which were estimated from the radiation
exposure model. We also projected breast cancer inci-
dence and mortality with and without screening.
Radiation Exposure Simulation Model
Full details, including approach, data sources, and
assumptions, are available in the Supplement. In brief,
for each of the 8 screening strategies, we simulated
woman-level factors and screening-related events for
100 000 women.
Woman-Level Factors. Each woman was assigned a
compressed breast thickness from the DMIST distribu-
tion (Appendix Table 1, available at www.annals.org).
Women with a compressed breast thickness of 7.5 cm
or greater (8% of DMIST population) were assumed to
have large breasts that required extra views for com-
plete examination. On the basis of distributions seen in
the BCSC, each woman was assigned a baseline Breast
Imaging Reporting and Data System (12) density at the
start of screening, which could potentially decrease by
1 category at ages 50 and 65 years (20) (Appendix
Table 2, available at www.annals.org).
Evaluation of a Positive Screening Result. For each
screening strategy, we simulated events after a positive
screening result that did not lead to a diagnosis of
breast cancer (Figure 2) to focus on risk for first breast
cancer induced by radiation. We modeled the proba-
bility of each event by using data from digital mam-
mography done at BCSC facilities from 2003 to 2011
on women aged 40 to 74 years without a history of
breast cancer or cancer diagnosed within 1 year after
the examination. At each screening, a woman's proba-
bility of recall for additional imaging was based on age,
breast density, screening interval, prior screening re-
sults, and a woman-specific random effect. If recalled,
the probability of referral to biopsy, short-interval
follow-up, or return to routine screening was based on
age, breast density, and screening interval.
Radiation Dose. For each screening and diagnostic
event, we sampled the number of screening mammog-
raphy views from the DMIST distribution (Appendix Ta-
ble 3, available at www.annals.org) and number of
views for diagnostic work-up on the basis of expert
opinion, conditional on compressed breast thickness
(Appendix Table 4, available at www.annals.org). We

Estimates of the number of screening examinations and false-positive results from the MISCAN-Fadia model were combined with the mean
radiation dose from the radiation exposure model to estimate mean incidence of radiation-induced breast cancer. Estimates of the probability
distribution of cumulative radiation dose at each age among women from the radiation exposure model were used to estimate the probability
distribution of radiation-induced breast cancer incidence. Radiation-induced breast cancer incidence was combined with breast cancer survival
estimates from the MISCAN-Fadia model to estimate radiation-induced breast cancer mortality. BCSC = Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium;

 assumed different distributions of views for women
with and without large breasts. We randomly sampled
the radiation dose per view on the basis of the DMIST
distribution conditional on the woman's compressed
breast thickness (Appendix Figure, available at www
.annals.org). For each age, we calculated total breast-
level dose by multiplying half the number of views of
both breasts by the dose per view. We report the mean
and the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles (to quan-
tify exposure leading to increased risk for radiation-
induced breast cancer) for the number of mammogra-
phy views and associated dose from each screening
examination and all follow-up mammograms within 1
year of a screening examination (Appendix Table 5,
available at www.annals.org).
Radiation-Induced Breast Cancer Incidence
and Mortality
We estimated radiation-induced breast cancer inci-
dence by using the excess absolute risk model from
pooled analysis of 4 cohorts by Preston and colleagues
(1), the preferred model for estimating radiation-
induced breast cancer incidence (2, 21). Details are
provided in the Supplement. Women in these cohorts
received cumulative radiation doses of 20 mGy or
greater. This level of cumulative radiation exposure is
reached after 2 to 4 years of mammography screening
and diagnostic work-up (Appendix Table 5). This
model assumes that excess risk for radiation-induced
breast cancer increases linearly with increasing radia-
tion dose within the exposure ranges from mammogra-
phy. In addition, risk decreases with increasing age at
exposure, especially after age 50 years (a surrogate for
menopause), and increases with age; the highest inci-
dence of radiation-induced breast cancer occurs late in
life. We modeled the latency period for developing
radiation-induced breast cancer by using a logistic
function that phases in increased breast cancer risk be-
tween 4 and 11 years after exposure (21). We estimated
radiation-induced breast cancer mortality by multiply-
ing radiation-induced breast cancer incidence by the
age-specific
case–fatality
rates
of
non–radiation-
induced breast cancer derived from MISCAN-Fadia and
assuming 100% adherence to screening and available
treatment. We assumed that breast cancer induced by
radiation is screen-detected at the same rate as nonin-
duced cancer. We approximated CIs by reestimating
risk for radiation-induced breast cancer by using the
upper and lower 95% CIs for the risk coefficient, �, be-
cause this uncertainty dominates the uncertainty in es-
timated risk (2, 21).
The MISCAN-Fadia model was programmed in
Delphi (Borland). All other analyses were done in R,
version 3.1.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing),
and SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Role of the Funding Source
This study was funded by the Agency for Health-
care Research and Quality under a contract to support
the work of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and
by the National Cancer Institute. Investigators worked
with Task Force members and Agency staff to develop
the scope, analytic framework, and key questions. The
funding source had no role in model input selection,
data synthesis, or data analysis. Agency staff provided
project oversight and reviewed the report to ensure
that the analysis met methodological standards. The

RESULTS
Radiation Exposure
Most radiation exposure from screening and sub-
sequent diagnostic work-up was due to the screening
examination (Appendix Table 5). Diagnostic work-up
accounted for only 10% of the mean annual radiation
dose but 24% of the dose for women with exposure at
the 95th percentile. On average, women with large
breasts were exposed to 2.3 times more radiation than
those with small or average-sized breasts.
Radiation-Induced Breast Cancer Incidence and
Breast Cancer Death
Risk estimates corresponding to mean exposures
were similar for the 2 modeling approaches (Table 1);
therefore, we focus on results from the radiation expo-
sure model. We projected that annual screening and
diagnostic work-up of 100 000 women aged 40 to 74
years (35 screening examinations per woman) would
induce an average of 125 breast cancer cases (95% CI,
88 to 178), resulting in 16 deaths (CI, 11 to 23) (Table
1). Risk projections varied widely, with 100 000 women
exposed at the 5th percentile projected to develop 64
radiation-induced cancer cases (CI, 44 to 90), resulting
in 8 deaths (CI, 6 to 12), and 100 000 women exposed
at the 95th percentile projected to develop 246

 radiation-induced cases of cancer (CI, 171 to 349), re-
sulting in 32 deaths (CI, 22 to 45). Women with large
breasts requiring extra views for complete examination
had more than twice as many cases of radiation-
induced breast cancer (mean, 266 cases [CI, 186 to
380]) and breast cancer deaths (mean, 35 deaths [CI,
24 to 50]) than women with small or average-sized
breasts (113 breast cancer cases [CI, 79 to 161] and 15
breast cancer deaths [CI, 10 to 21]) (Table 2).
Starting screening at age 50 years and following a
biennial strategy (13 screening examinations) greatly
reduced risk for radiation-induced breast cancer and
breast cancer death (Table 1). Compared with annual
screening from age 40 to 74 years, biennial screening
from age 50 to 74 years was projected to cause approx-
imately one fifth of the radiation-induced breast cancer
cases (mean, 125 cases [CI, 88 to 178] vs. 27 cases [CI,
19 to 38] per 100 000 women, respectively, and 266
cases [CI, 186 to 380] vs. 57 cases [CI, 40 to 82] per
100 000 women with large breasts) (Table 2).
Breast Cancer Deaths Averted per Radiation-
Induced Case of Breast Cancer
From the MISCAN-Fadia model, we projected that
16 947 breast cancer cases would be diagnosed from
age 40 years through death per 100 000 women
screened annually from age 40 to 74 years (data not
shown). The number of breast cancer deaths averted
ranged from 627 per 100 000 women screened bienni-
ally from age 50 to 74 years to 968 per 100 000 women
screened annually from age 40 to 74 years (Table 3).
For biennial screening from age 50 to 74 years, we pro-
jected a mean of 23 breast cancer deaths averted for
each radiation-induced case of breast cancer (CI, 16 to
33) (5th percentile, 48; 95th percentile, 11) and 140
breast
cancer
deaths
averted
for
each
radiation-
induced breast cancer death (CI, 98 to 199) (5th per-
centile, 289; 95th percentile, 68). For annual screening
from age 40 to 74 years, these ratios were lower, at 8
breast cancer deaths averted per radiation-induced
case of breast cancer (CI, 5 to 11) (5th percentile, 15;
95th percentile, 4) and 59 breast cancer deaths averted
per radiation-induced breast cancer death among all
women (CI, 42 to 85) (5th percentile, 117; 95th percen-
tile, 30). For annual screening from age 40 to 74 years
of women with large breasts, ratios were even lower, at
4 breast cancer deaths averted per radiation-induced
case of breast cancer (CI, 3 to 5) and 28 per radiation-
induced breast cancer death (CI, 20 to 40).
DISCUSSION
We improved previous estimates of the potential
harms from radiation exposure of screening strategies
for breast cancer by using methods that more fully rep-
resent the experience of women who have routine
digital screening mammography. Our models included

 rated variation in dose at each screening and diagnos-
tic examination. In addition to the mean, we reported
the 5th and 95th percentiles of the population distribu-
tion to highlight that some women have risk that is sub-
stantially lower or higher than average because of vari-
ation in radiation exposure. Most of the increased risk
was due to screening examinations with more than 4
views and higher-than-average doses per view. We
used DMIST data to model the number of views per
screening examination and to incorporate the in-
creased radiation dose per view for thicker com-
pressed breasts. However, even for a given com-
pressed
breast
thickness,
some
women
received
greater doses than others, which was probably due to
greater breast density that required more radiation for
penetration. Because women with large breasts may re-
quire more views per examination and tend to receive
a greater dose per view, breast size was an important
factor in determining radiation exposure and associ-
ated risk. Another reason for greater radiation expo-
sure is false-positive results; additional imaging per-
formed to work up false-positive results accounted for
one fourth of the radiation dose received by women at
the 95th percentile compared with only one tenth of
the radiation dose received by women at the mean.
Relative to a projected 16 947 breast cancer cases
diagnosed per 100 000 women aged 40 years or older
with annual screening, we estimate that the number of
breast cancer cases induced by screening is probably
very small, even for women with the greatest radiation
exposures. However, relative to the number of breast
cancer
deaths
averted
with
screening,
radiation-
induced breast cancer incidence is not trivial. Most con-
cerning are numbers projected for annual screening
and screening before age 50 years of women with
large breasts requiring extra views for complete exam-
ination, who have more than twice the risk for radiation-
induced breast cancer as women with small or average-
sized breasts. Although we did not model this explicitly,
women with breast augmentation should also have
twice the risk for radiation-induced breast cancer be-
cause they receive implant-displacement views in addi-
tion to standard screening views, resulting in a mini-
mum of 8 views per examination compared with the
standard 4 views (12).
The benefit–harm ratio in terms of breast cancer
deaths averted per radiation-induced case of breast
cancer could be improved by initiating screening at
age 50 years instead of 40 years, thereby reducing risk
for radiation-induced breast cancer by 60%, or by using
biennial screening, which would cut the risk in half
compared with annual screening. Doing both (screen-
ing biennially from age 50 to 74 years) would reduce
the risk almost 5-fold compared with annual screening
from age 40 to 74 years. Several steps should be taken
to further improve the benefit–harm ratio. Current ef-
forts to reduce the radiation dose per view should con-
tinue. Radiology staff should strive to minimize the

 number of additional views performed and to reduce
false-positive rates, which are much higher in the
United States than many other countries, suggesting
room for improvement (22–25). Radiation doses from
diagnostic mammography could be avoided for certain
screen-detected masses amenable to ultrasonography
work-up alone. In addition, facilities should ensure that
large breasts are imaged using larger detector sizes
to minimize the need for extra views for complete
examination.
Hendrick (3) also estimated incidence and mortality
of radiation-induced breast cancer using DMIST data
but used the mean dose for 4 views without accounting
for
additional
radiation
exposure
from
additional
screening views received by 21% of women or from
diagnostic follow-up imaging. He projected that annual
screening of 100 000 women from age 40 to 80 years
with an examination-level dose of 3.7 mGy would in-
duce 72 breast cancer cases leading to 20 deaths. For
women screened annually from age 40 to 74 years, we
estimated fewer breast cancer deaths (16 deaths per
100 000
women),
despite
more
radiation-induced
breast cancer cases (125 cases per 100 000 women),
because we optimistically assumed 100% adherence to
the screening regimen and use of available treatments.
In particular, we assumed that 10% to 19% of women
diagnosed with breast cancer between ages 40 and 74
years would die of the disease (depending on the
screening scenario) compared with recent estimates of
more than 23% (26). Thus, we may have underesti-
mated the number of radiation-induced breast cancer
deaths. Yaffe and Mainprize (4) projected that screen-
ing 100 000 women annually from age 40 to 55 years
and biennially thereafter to age 74 years with a dose of
3.7 mGy would induce 86 breast cancer cases and 11
deaths. In comparison, we projected that screening
100 000 women annually from age 40 to 49 years and
biennially thereafter to age 74 years would induce 89
breast cancer cases and 15 deaths. Our estimates are
probably greater because we accounted for some
screening examinations having more than 4 views and
for radiation exposure from diagnostic work-up.
Doses from current digital mammography systems
may be lower than doses from older DMIST units. Nev-
ertheless, DMIST doses may still be conservative be-
cause, similar to most prior studies, dose estimates as-
sumed breast compositions of 50% glandular tissue,
which probably underestimates doses by 8% to 18%
(27, 28). Although Mammography Quality Standards
Act inspections suggest that doses for a digital mam-
mography view decreased 2.5% between 2007 and
2009 (29), these doses were measured with phantoms
simulating breasts with a compressed breast thickness
at the 30th percentile in DMIST. Radiation dose is
highly correlated with compressed breast thickness,
which may increase over time with increasing popula-
tion body mass index (30).
The use of digital breast tomosynthesis for screen-
ing is increasing in the United States (31). Doses from
breast tomosynthesis vary by strategy; however, the

 3-dimensional acquisition generally uses a radiation
dose similar to or slightly greater than standard digital
mammography (28, 32, 33). Most U.S. practices offer-
ing screening tomosynthesis combine it with digital
mammography, which at least doubles doses and the
risk for radiation-induced breast cancer. Software ap-
proved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to
generate synthetic 2-dimensional views from tomosyn-
thesis acquisitions will probably eliminate the need for
standard digital mammography views and their associ-
ated radiation exposure (34); however, the rate at
which this software will diffuse into clinical practice is
unknown. Estimating radiation-induced cancer risks as-
sociated with tomosynthesis screening is further com-
plicated by the expectation that this method will de-
crease recall rates and potentially eliminate the need
for diagnostic mammography to work up some imag-
ing findings (35–41).
Our study had several limitations. We had inade-
quate information on the percentage of women requir-
ing more than 4 views for complete breast examination.
In DMIST, 21% of women required more than 4 screen-
ing views (10), although most received only 1 or 2 extra
views, probably because of patient movement or poor
positioning. On the basis of the observed distribution
of compressed breast thickness and number of views,
we assumed that 8% of women received extra views
because they had large breasts. Of note, the early-
generation mammography systems used in DMIST had
smaller image detectors (10). Most modern units have
larger detectors; therefore, the percentage of women
requiring extra views because of large breast size is
probably less than 8%.
We could not calculate life-years lost due to
radiation-induced breast cancer, which may occur later
in life than deaths prevented from screening. Because
of lack of data, we did not model the association be-
tween breast size and the probability of a false-positive
result; thus, we may have underestimated exposure
from additional work-up in women with large breasts
because obese women may be 20% more likely than
normal-weight women to have false-positive results (9).
We also assumed that the number of breast cancer
deaths averted with screening did not vary by breast
size; however, screening may prevent more deaths
among postmenopausal obese women (who tend to
have large breasts) because they have a greater risk for
advanced disease (42). In addition, we did not model
the association between breast density and radiation
dose per view because of lack of representative data.
Probabilities for events after screening mammography
were based on point estimates from models that used
the best available data and did not account for uncer-
tainty due to model misspecification or inherent vari-
ability in parameter estimates. We could not estimate
95% CIs for deaths averted with screening because of
the computational complexity of the MISCAN-Fadia
model and because many input parameters of the
model (such as tumor growth rate) are unobservable
and therefore have unknown distributions. We also
made several simplifying assumptions (Supplement).
In conclusion, population projections of radiation-
induced breast cancer incidence and mortality from
mammography screening are affected by variability in
doses from screening and resultant diagnostic exami-
nations, age at screening initiation, and screening fre-
quency. Our study suggests that women with large
breasts or breast augmentation receive greater radia-
tion doses and may have a greater risk for radiation-
induced breast cancer and breast cancer death. Radi-
ology practices should strive to ensure that large
breasts are imaged with large detectors with the fewest
number of views possible.
