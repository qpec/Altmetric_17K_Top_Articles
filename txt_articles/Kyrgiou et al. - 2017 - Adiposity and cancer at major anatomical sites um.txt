ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To evaluate the strength and validity of the evidence 
for the association between adiposity and risk of 
developing or dying from cancer.
Design
Umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-
analyses.
Data sOurCes
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews, and manual screening of retrieved 
references.
eligibility Criteria
Systematic reviews or meta-analyses of observational 
studies that evaluated the association between 
indices of adiposity and risk of developing or dying 
from cancer.
Data synthesis
Primary analysis focused on cohort studies exploring 
associations for continuous measures of adiposity. 
The evidence was graded into strong, highly 
suggestive, suggestive, or weak after applying criteria 
that included the statistical significance of the random 
effects summary estimate and of the largest study in a 
meta-analysis, the number of cancer cases, 
heterogeneity between studies, 95% prediction 
intervals, small study effects, excess significance bias, 
and sensitivity analysis with credibility ceilings.
results
204 meta-analyses investigated associations between 
seven indices of adiposity and developing or dying 
from 36 primary cancers and their subtypes. Of the 95 
meta-analyses that included cohort studies and used a 
continuous scale to measure adiposity, only 12 (13%) 
associations for nine cancers were supported by 
strong evidence. An increase in body mass index was 
associated with a higher risk of developing 
oesophageal adenocarcinoma; colon and rectal cancer 
in men; biliary tract system and pancreatic cancer; 
endometrial cancer in premenopausal women; kidney 
cancer; and multiple myeloma. Weight gain and waist 
to hip circumference ratio were associated with higher 
risks of postmenopausal breast cancer in women who 
have never used hormone replacement therapy and 
endometrial cancer, respectively. The increase in the 
risk of developing cancer for every 5 kg/m2 increase in 
body mass index ranged from 9% (relative risk 1.09, 
95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.13) for rectal cancer 
among men to 56% (1.56, 1.34 to 1.81) for biliary tract 
system cancer. The risk of postmenopausal breast 
cancer among women who have never used HRT 
increased by 11% for each 5 kg of weight gain in 
adulthood (1.11, 1.09 to 1.13), and the risk of 
endometrial cancer increased by 21% for each 0.1 
increase in waist to hip ratio (1.21, 1.13 to 1.29). Five 
additional associations were supported by strong 
evidence when categorical measures of adiposity were 
included: weight gain with colorectal cancer; body 
mass index with gallbladder, gastric cardia, and 
ovarian cancer; and multiple myeloma mortality.
COnClusiOns
Although the association of adiposity with cancer risk 
has been extensively studied, associations for only 
11 cancers (oesophageal adenocarcinoma, multiple 
myeloma, and cancers of the gastric cardia, colon, 
rectum, biliary tract system, pancreas, breast, 
endometrium, ovary, and kidney) were supported by 
strong evidence. Other associations could be genuine, 
but substantial uncertainty remains. Obesity is 
becoming one of the biggest problems in public 
health; evidence on the strength of the associated 
risks may allow finer selection of those at higher risk of 
cancer, who could be targeted for personalised 
prevention strategies.
Introduction
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, with an 
estimated 12.7 million new cases and 7
.6 million deaths 
from cancer annually.1  Excess body weight is associ-
ated with an increased risk of developing and dying 
from many diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, 
and cardiovascular disease.2  Obesity has become a 
major public health challenge3 ; its prevalence world-
wide has more than doubled among women and tripled 
among men in the past four decades.4  The number of 
overweight and obese people has risen from approxi-
mately 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013.5
Several meta-analyses support the link between obe-
sity and cancer, but substantial heterogeneity exists

between studies.6  The reported associations may be 
causal, but they may also be flawed, as inherent study 
biases such as residual confounding and selective 
reporting of positive results may exaggerate the effect of 
obesity on cancer.7-10  A recent umbrella review found 
that, despite strong claims of a statistically significant 
association between type 2 diabetes and several can-
cers, only a fraction (14%) of the 27 studied associations 
were supported by robust evidence, without any poten-
tial bias.11
To summarise and evaluate the existing evidence and 
appraise its quality, we performed an umbrella review 
of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that investi-
gated the association between adiposity indices and 
risk of developing or dying from cancer. Umbrella 
reviews systematically appraise the evidence on an 
entire topic across many meta-analyses of multiple 
putative risk factors on multiple outcomes.11-18
Methods
literature search
We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Data-
base of Systematic Reviews from inception to May 2015 
for systematic reviews or meta-analyses that investi-
gated the association between adiposity indices and 
risk of developing or dying from any cancer using a 
predefined search algorithm (see the supplementary 
file for details of the algorithm). Adiposity indices were 
body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumfer-
ence, waist to hip ratio, weight, weight gain, and 
weight loss from bariatric surgery. We hand searched 
the references of the retrieved systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses and the proceedings of relevant confer-
ences for articles missed by the electronic search and 
unpublished data.
inclusion and exclusion criteria
We included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of 
observational epidemiological studies in humans that 
assessed continuous or categorical measures of adipos-
ity. We excluded studies in which physical activity, 
height, or prenatal factors (such as birth weight or 
maternal obesity during pregnancy) were the exposures 
of interest and those in which cancer incidence or mor-
tality were not the outcomes of interest. We excluded 
meta-analyses of prognostic studies that investigated 
cancer survival or other outcomes among patients with 
cancer and meta-analyses that did not include compre-
hensive data from individual studies—such as relative 
risks, 95% confidence intervals, number of cases and 
controls, or total population. When we found more than 
one meta-analysis on the same association between 
exposure and outcome, we included the one with the 
largest number of primary studies to avoid duplication. 
We subsequently examined whether the summary esti-
mates showed concordance between the included and 
duplicate meta-analyses.
Data extraction
We extracted the name of the first author, year of 
 
publication, outcome, and exposure from each eligible 
systematic review or meta-analysis. From each individ-
ual study in a meta-analysis, we extracted the first 
author, year of publication, epidemiological design, 
number of cases and controls in case-control studies or 
total population in cohort studies, maximally adjusted 
relative risk (odds ratio in case-control studies and haz-
ard ratio or standardised incidence or mortality ratio in 
cohort studies) and 95% confidence intervals. Two 
investigators (IK, MK) independently searched the liter-
ature, assessed the eligibility of the retrieved papers, 
and extracted the data. Disagreements were resolved by 
discussion with a third investigator (KT).
Data analysis
Estimation of summary effect—For each exposure and 
outcome pair, we calculated the summary effect and the 
95% confidence interval using fixed and random effects 
methods.19
Assessment of heterogeneity—The heterogeneity 
between studies was assessed with Cochran’s Q test20 
and the I2 statistic.21  Substantial inconsistency could 
reflect either genuine heterogeneity between studies or 
bias. To assess the uncertainty around heterogeneity 
estimates, we calculated 95% confidence intervals.22
Estimation of prediction intervals—To further account 
for heterogeneity between studies we calculated 95% 
prediction intervals for the summary random effect esti-
mates, which represent the range in which the effect 
estimates of future studies will lie.23
Assessment of small study effects—We examined 
whether smaller studies gave higher risk estimates than 
larger studies, which is an indication of publication 
bias, true heterogeneity, or chance.11 24 Indication of 
small study effects was based on the Egger’s regression 
asymmetry test (P≤0.10) and whether the random 
effects summary estimate was larger than the point esti-
mate of the largest study in the meta-analysis.
Evaluation of excess significance—We assessed excess 
significance bias by evaluating whether the observed 
number of studies with nominally statistically signifi-
cant results (“positive” studies, P<0.05) in the pub-
lished literature was different from the expected 
number of studies with statistically significant results.25 
The expected number of statistically significant studies 
in each meta-analysis was calculated from the sum of 
the statistical power estimates for each component 
study using an algorithm from a non-central t distribu-
tion.26 
27  The power estimates of each component study 
depend on the plausible effect size for the tested associ-
ation, which was assumed to be the effect of the largest 
study (that is, the smallest standard error) in each 
meta-analysis.28  Sensitivity analyses were conducted 
using the summary fixed and random effects estimates 
as alternative plausible effect sizes. Excess significance 
for individual meta-analyses was determined at 
P≤0.10.25
Credibility ceilings—We used credibility ceilings, a 
sensitivity analysis tool, to account for potential 
 
methodological limitations of observational studies 
that might lead to spurious precision of combined effect 
estimates.29 The main assumption of this method is that

every observational study has a probability c (credibil-
ity ceiling) that the true effect size is in a different direc-
tion from the one suggested by the point estimate. The 
pooled effect size and the heterogeneity between stud-
ies were re-estimated using a wide range of credibility 
ceiling values.29

grading the evidence
The associations between measures of adiposity and 
cancer were categorised into strong, highly suggestive, 
suggestive, or weak depending on the strength and 
validity of the evidence.13 
15 
18 A strong association was 
claimed when the P value of the random effects 
meta-analysis was smaller than 10−6, a threshold that 
might substantially reduce false positive findings31-33 if 
the meta-analysis has more than 1000 cancer cases, the 
largest study in the meta-analysis is nominally statisti-
cally significant (P<0.05), the I2 statistic of heterogene-
ity between studies is smaller than 50%, the 95% 
prediction intervals excludes the null value, small 
study effects or excess significance bias are not indi-
cated, and the association survives a credibility ceiling 
of at least 10%.
The association was considered highly suggestive if 
P<10−6, the meta-analysis had more than 1000 cases, 
and the largest study in the meta-analysis was nomi-
nally statistically significant. The criteria for suggestive 
were: random effects P<10−3 and the meta-analysis had 
more than 1000 cases. All other associations with a 
nominally statistically significant P value for the ran-
dom effects meta-analysis were deemed to provide 
weak evidence.
The primary analysis in this umbrella review focused 
on cohort studies using continuous measures of adipos-
ity, which was considered a more valid and stan-
dardised way of presenting and synthesising individual 
study estimates than using categorical measures. Sensi-
tivity analyses were conducted using case-control 
 
studies and categorical measures. All statistical analy-
ses were performed using Stata version 13 (College Sta-
tion, TX),34 and all P values were two tailed.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up on results. The results will be dissem-
inated to the general public through public 
presentations and the authors’ involvement in different 
charities.
Results
Characteristics of the meta-analyses
Overall, 49 eligible papers were identified that included 
a total of 204 meta-analyses. These meta-analyses sum-
marised 2179 individual study estimates from 507 
unique cohort or case-control studies (fig 1 ).35-83 Of the 
507 unique studies, 371 (73.2%) had a cohort design, 134 
(26.4%) were case-control studies, and two (0.4%) were 
cross sectional studies. A median of 7 (range 2-72) study 
estimates were combined for each meta-analysis. The 
median number of cases and population or controls in 
each meta-analysis was 5645 and 1 766 389, respectively. 
A total of 177 meta-analyses had at least 1000 cancer 
cases.
The 204 meta-analyses included associations 
between seven indices of adiposity (body mass index, 
waist circumference, hip circumference, waist to hip 
ratio, weight, weight gain, and weight loss through bar-
iatric surgery) and the incidence (n=196) or mortality 
(n=8) from cancer at 36 anatomical sites and by sub-
types. A total of 194 meta-analyses included cohort 
studies (see supplementary tables 1 and 2). Of these, 
95 used a continuous scale to measure adiposity (for 
example, body mass index in adults or at around age 20 
per 5 kg/m2, waist circumference per 10 cm, hip circum-
ference per 10 cm, waist to hip ratio per 0.1, weight per 
5 kg, and weight gain per 1 kg or 5 kg). These 95 
meta-analyses studied 28 different cancer sites or sub-
types and included 818 individual study estimates, with 
body mass index in adults being investigated most fre-
quently (n=57 meta-analyses).
We identified more than one published meta-analysis 
with the same exposure and outcome pair for 11 can-
cers. All duplicate meta-analyses showed agreement on 
the direction, magnitude, and statistical significance of 
the summary associations (see supplementary table 3).
summary effect size
When we used a threshold of P<0.05, the summary fixed 
effects estimates were significant in 76 of the 95 
meta-analyses (80%) and the summary random effects 
were significant in 72 (76%) (see supplementary table 1 
and supplementary figures 1-28). At a stricter threshold of 
P<0.001, 66 (69%) and 59 (62%) meta-analyses produced 
significant summary results using the fixed and random 
effects models, respectively. At P<10−6, 54 (57%) and 35 
(37%) meta-analyses were significant, respectively.
Of those 35 meta-analyses, 31 found an increased risk 
of cancer with higher adiposity for oesophageal adeno-
carcinoma, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the

colon, rectum, liver, biliary tract system (cancers of 
gallbladder, extrahepatic bile duct, and ampulla of 
Vater), pancreas, postmenopausal breast, endome-
trium, and kidney. Four of the 35 meta-analyses indi-
cated an inverse association for oesophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma and lung cancer. The magnitude of the 
observed summary random effect estimates ranged 
from 0.57 to 1.90; 61% of the estimates lay between 0.80 
and 1.20 (fig 2). In meta-analyses with small variances a 
trend of summary effects towards 1.00 was observed. 
The largest study of each meta-analysis showed a nom-
inally statistically significant association in 65 
meta-analyses (68%), and the relative risks of the larg-
est studies were more conservative (closer to null) than 
the summary random effects in 53 (56%) meta-analyses.
The summary estimates were similar between men 
and women for eight of 11 cancers (oesophageal adeno-
carcinoma, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 
multiple myeloma, leukaemia, and gastric, lung, kid-
ney, and thyroid cancers). However, the incidence of 
colon and rectal cancer was higher per 5 kg/m2 increase 
of body mass index in men (relative risk 1.30, 95% 
 
confidence interval 1.25 to 1.35) and 1.09 (1.06 to 1.13), 
respectively) than in women (1.12 (1.06 to 1.17) and 1.02 
(0.99 to 1.05), respectively). This was also true for other 
adiposity indices. Moreover, body mass index was asso-
ciated with an increased risk of melanoma in men (rel-
ative risk per 5 kg/m2 1.17
, 1.05 to 1.30) but not in women 
(0.96, 0.93 to 1.00).
heterogeneity between studies
Τhe Q test was significant at P≤0.10 in 42 of 95 meta-anal-
yses (44%) (see supplementary table 2). Twenty 
meta-analyses (21%) showed considerable heterogene-
ity (I2=50-75%) and 15 meta-analyses (16%) showed sub-
stantial heterogeneity (I2 >75%) for some adiposity 
indices and several cancers (oesophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma; colon, liver, lung, endometrial, prostate, 
and thyroid cancers; melanoma; and leukaemia). We 
further assessed the uncertainty of the summary effects 
by calculating 95% prediction intervals; the null value 
was excluded in only 27 associations.
small study effects
Thirteen meta-analyses had evidence indicating small 
study effects, but only seven included 10 or more 
 
studies and therefore had enough statistical power for 
the Egger’s test to adequately identify presence of small 
study effects (colon, liver, lung, ovarian, and advanced 
prostate cancer; see supplementary table 2). Supple-
mentary figures 1 to 28 show the funnel plots for each 
cancer site.
excess significance
Nineteen meta-analyses had evidence of excess signifi-
cance bias for some adiposity indices using the largest 
study estimate as the plausible effect size (colon, rectal, 
liver, pancreatic, endometrial, ovarian, prostate, 
advanced prostate, and kidney cancer; supplementary 
table 2). Using summary fixed or random effects esti-
mates as plausible effect sizes gave similar results.
Credibility ceilings
A credibility ceiling of 0% corresponds to the random 
effects model calculation. Of the 95 meta-analyses, 72 
(76%) retained nominal statistical significance (P<0.05) 
with a credibility ceiling of 5%. Fifty (53%), 33 (35%), 
and 19 (20%) meta-analyses remained statistically 
 
significant with ceilings of 10%, 15%, and 20%, respec-
tively. Heterogeneity between studies gradually 
decreased with increasing ceilings. With a ceiling of 
10%, no meta-analyses of cohort studies with continu-
ous exposure gave an I2 estimate larger than 50% (sup-
plementary table 4).
grading the evidence
We explored whether the reported associations between 
adiposity and developing or dying from cancer were 
supported by strong, highly suggestive, suggestive, or 
weak evidence (table 1). We found that 77% of the 95 
meta-analyses presented at least weak evidence (P<0.05 
for the summary random effects). Supplementary table 
5 shows these associations in cohort studies using con-
tinuous measures of adiposity (also see supplementary 
table 6 for associations using categorical measures of 
adiposity in cohort studies and supplementary table 7 
for all associations regardless of study type or exposure 
metric).
Only 13% of meta-analyses (12 of 95) were supported 
by strong evidence. They summarised data on body 
mass index (n=10), waist to hip ratio (n=1), and weight 
gain (n=1). An increase in body mass index was associ-
ated with a higher risk of developing oesophageal ade-
nocarcinoma; colon and rectal cancer in men; biliary 
tract system and pancreatic cancer; endometrial cancer 
in premenopausal women; kidney cancer; and multiple 
myeloma. Weight gain and waist to hip circumference 
ratio were associated with higher risks of postmeno-
pausal breast cancer in women who have never used 
hormone replacement therapy and endometrial cancer, 
respectively. The increase in the risk of developing can-
cer for every 5 kg/m2 increase in body mass index 
ranged from 9% (relative risk 1.09, 95% confidence 
interval 1.06 to 1.13) for colorectal cancer among men to 
56% (1.56, 1.34 to 1.81) for biliary tract system cancer.

women who have never used HRT increased by 11% for

each 5 kg of weight gain (1.11, 1.09 to1.13), and the risk of 
endometrial cancer increased by 21% for each 0.1 
increase in waist to hip ratio (1.21, 1.13 to 1.29).
Seventeen meta-analyses (18%) were supported by 
highly suggestive evidence, and they found positive 
associations for colon (with body mass index and waist 
circumference), liver (with body mass index), post-
menopausal breast (with body mass index), total endo-
metrial (with body mass index in adults and at around 
age 20, waist circumference, weight, and weight gain), 
postmenopausal, type I and type II endometrial (with 
body mass index), and kidney cancer (with body mass 
index). Inverse associations were found for body mass 
index in adults with oesophageal squamous cell carci-
noma (overall and in women) and lung cancer (overall 
and in men). Twenty four meta-analyses (25%) were 
supported by suggestive evidence for an association, 
and 19 meta-analyses (20%) were supported by weak 
evidence.
The evidence was graded similarly in the 194 
meta-analyses of cohort studies that assessed continu-
ous and categorical measures of adiposity (supplemen-
tary table 6). Five additional associations were 
supported by strong evidence: weight gain with inci-
dence of colorectal cancer, body mass index with inci-
dence of gallbladder, gastric cardia, and ovarian 
cancers, and mortality from multiple myeloma. When 
both cohort and case-control studies were assessed for 
continuous and categorical measures of adiposity (sup-
plementary table 7), two additional associations were 
supported by strong evidence: body mass index and 
risk of melanoma and meningioma, both of which were 
judged as weak associations when only cohort studies 
were evaluated. The strong evidence for an association 
between body mass index and incidence of biliary tract 
system cancerwas downgraded to suggestive evidence 
when both case-control and cohort studies were evalu-
ated.
discussion
We reviewed 204 meta-analyses to evaluate the current 
evidence for associations between seven adiposity indi-
ces and the risk of developing or dying from 36 primary 
cancers and their subtypes. Twelve associations, stem-
ming from cohort studies using continuous measures of 
adiposity, were supported by strong evidence, inferred 
by strongly statistically significant results and no sug-
gestion of bias. These associations were primarily 
between body mass index and malignancies of diges-
tive organs (oesophageal adenocarcinoma and cancers 
of the colorectum (in men only), biliary tract system, 
and pancreas), hormone related cancers (such as post-
menopausal breast in women who have never used 
HRT), premenopausal and overall endometrial cancer, 
kidney cancer, and multiple myeloma. Five additional 
associations were supported by strong evidence when 
categorical measures of adiposity were used: weight 
gain with risk of colorectal cancer risk and body mass 
index with risk of gallbladder, gastric cardia, and ovar-
ian cancer, and mortality from multiple myeloma.
The effect of obesity on the incidence and mortality of 
cancer is well recognised6 62 84  and was evident in our 
umbrella review, with approximately 77% of the 
included meta-analyses reporting a nominally statisti-
cally significant summary random effects estimate. 
Although the reported associations are plausibly

accurate and potentially causal, the risk of reporting, 
selection, and other inherent biases may overestimate 
the suggested associations, as shown in other recently 
published umbrella reviews in cancer epidemiol-
ogy.11 
13 
27 The extent to which the literature is affected by 
such biases is difficult to prove definitively. We used sta-
tistical tests and sensitivity analyses to look for evi-
dence of bias. When lower P value thresholds (P<10−6) 
were used, the proportion of significant associations 
decreased to 37%. Large heterogeneity (I2 ≥50%) was 
observed in 37% of the meta-analyses. When we calcu-
lated the 95% prediction intervals, which further 
account for heterogeneity, we found that the null value 
was excluded in only about one third of the associa-
tions. Moreover, some meta-analyses had evidence of 
small study effects or excess significance bias. Most 
meta-analyses (53%) preserved their statistical signifi-
cance with a 10% credibility ceiling, but only one in five 
preserved significance at a ceiling of 20%, indicating 
that many associations between adiposity and cancer 
remain uncertain.
Comparison with other studies
Our grading of the evidence largely agrees with system-
atic analyses of the literature performed by the World 
Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).6 
84 
85  The WCRF 
currently lists seven cancers for which the evidence 
supports a convincing causal relationship with obesity 
(oesophageal adenocarcinoma and cancers of the pan-
creas, 
colorectum, 
postmenopausal 
breast, 
 
endometrium, kidney, and liver). We also found strong 
evidence that obesity increases the risk of these can-
cers, except for liver cancer, for which the evidence was 
considered highly suggestive because of small study 
effects, excess significance bias, and substantial hetero-
geneity between studies. The association between obe-
sity and five more malignancies (gallbladder, stomach 
cardia, ovarian, advanced prostate, and premeno-
pausal breast cancer) was graded as probably causal by 
WCRF and received lower evidence grades in our main 
analysis using only continuous measures of adiposity. 
IARC found sufficient evidence to support the associa-
tion between excess body fat and 13 of 24 cancer sites 
(oesophagus (adenocarcinoma), gastric cardia, colorec-
tum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, postmenopausal 
breast, endometrium, ovary, kidney, meningioma, thy-
roid, and multiple myeloma).84 Our results are similar to 
those of the IARC report for most cancers, except for 
gastric cardia, liver, ovarian, meningioma and thyroid 
cancers. These cancers received lower than strong evi-
dence grades in our main analysis, owing to small num-
bers of cancer cases, very large heterogeneity between 
studies, or evidence of small study effects and excess 
significance bias. However, the associations between 
adiposity and risk of gastric cardia and ovarian cancer 
were judged to be supported with strong evidence when 
we evaluated categorical measures of adiposity. Simi-
larly, evidence for an association between adiposity 
and risk of meningioma was considered strong when 
case-control studies were included in the evaluation.
Several methods exist for rating evidence, but they 
are inconsistent and allow some degree of arbitrari-
ness.86  The WCRF and IARC used expert groups and 
criteria similar to Bradford Hill criteria to assess the 
association between obesity and risk of 17 and 24 pri-
mary cancers, respectively, whereas we assessed the 
robustness of the evidence using sensitivity analyses 
and statistical tests to evaluate 36 primary cancers and 
their subtypes, defined by anatomical location, histol-
ogy, and receptor status. We also explored associations 
by potential effect modifiers (eg, sex, menopausal sta-
tus, smoking status, and use of HRT). Our criteria for 
grading evidence should not be considered causal crite-
ria, especially when used individually, but we think 
that they are useful for identifying biases when used 
together.12
Most of the associations between adiposity indices 
and endometrial cancer were supported by strong or 
highly suggestive evidence. In particular, the associa-
tion between waist to hip ratio and risk of total endome-
trial cancer was supported by strong evidence, 
indicating that central obesity, which is linked to hyper-
insulinaemia and type 2 diabetes, has a major role in 
the development of this disease. Strong evidence also 
supported the association between body mass index 
and premenopausal endometrial cancer. We found the 
associations between body mass index in adults or at 
around age 20, waist circumference, weight, and weight 
gain and total endometrial cancer, and between body 
mass index and postmenopausal type I and II endome-
trial cancer to be highly suggestive owing to substantial 
heterogeneity between studies and potential for excess 
significance bias. These results were in agreement with 
the WCRF and IARC, which did not provide separate rat-
ings for menopausal status or histological subtype of 
disease.84 
87  The difference in evidence ratings between 
premenopausal and postmenopausal endometrial can-
cer is probably related to heterogeneity caused by use of 
HRT among postmenopausal women.88  We found that 
the associations between body mass index or weight 
gain and postmenopausal endometrial cancer were sta-
tistically significantly stronger in never users compared 
with ever users of HRT, but the relevant meta-analyses 
included only 2-6 studies and had fewer than 1000 can-
cer cases, so the evidence was deemed weak. The WCRF 
found that the associations between waist circumfer-
ence or waist to hip ratio and total endometrial cancer 
were probably causal,87 which largely agreed with our 
findings.
We found strong evidence to support the association 
between weight gain in adulthood and postmenopausal 
breast cancer among women who have never used HRT, 
yielding an 11% higher risk per 5 kg of weight gain. We 
found highly suggestive evidence to support the posi-
tive association of body mass index with postmeno-
pausal breast cancer, irrespective of HRT. Weight gain 
may be a better metric than body mass index for mea-
suring the dynamic nature of adiposity during adult-
hood, when obesity becomes central and has more 
metabolic effects.49  Another reason for the lower grad-
ing of the evidence for body mass index was the large

heterogeneity between studies,62  which could at least 
partially be explained by a potential interaction with 
HRT use. Some cohort studies have found a positive 
association between body mass index and postmeno-
pausal breast cancer only among women who have 
never used HRT,89 
90  but we did not capture this poten-
tial interaction because published meta-analyses have 
not performed this subgroup analysis.62 
78  The evidence 
for an association between adiposity indices and pre-
menopausal breast cancer was weaker and only 
reached suggestive evidence for an inverse association 
with body mass index in a meta-analysis of 20 cohort 
studies. These results largely agree with the WCRF and 
IARC findings of a convincing causal positive associa-
tion between adiposity and postmenopausal breast 
cancer84 
91  and a probable causal inverse association for 
premenopausal disease.91  Two recent Mendelian ran-
domisation studies found that a higher body mass 
index in adults was associated with a lower risk of post-
menopausal breast cancer, contradicting the epidemio-
logical evidence.92 
93  This may be due to the genetic risk 
score for body mass index in adults being a stronger 
determinant of early compared with later life body mass 
index; epidemiological studies have found inverse 
associations between body mass index in childhood 
and both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast 
cancer.94 
95  The positive association between body mass 
index in adults and postmenopausal breast cancer 
found in epidemiological studies may be driven by 
weight gain in adulthood. We found strong evidence to 
support the association between weight gain in adults 
and postmenopausal breast cancer, but weight gain is 
probably linked to environmental factors that are not 
captured by genetic risk factors.96  Moreover, some evi-
dence exists that these associations may differ accord-
ing to oestrogen and progesterone receptor status of the 
tumour (supplementary tables 6 and 7),68 97 but large 
investigations in this area are lacking.
The association between body mass index and colon 
cancer was supported by strong evidence in men and 
suggestive evidence in women. Twenty four cohorts 
investigated the association in men, totalling a 30% 
higher risk of colon cancer for each 5 kg/m2 increase in 
body mass index. The risk was 12% higher for each 5 kg/
m2 increase in body mass index among women in a 
meta-analysis of 20 cohorts that showed substantial 
heterogeneity and evidence of small study effects and 
excess significance bias. The association between body 
mass index and rectal cancer in men was supported by 
strong evidence, but with a summary relative risk con-
siderably smaller than for colon cancer (1.09 v 1.30). We 
found no association between body mass index and rec-
tal cancer in women. The evidence for most of the other 
adiposity indices was suggestive, as few studies have 
investigated these associations. The insulin signalling 
pathway is a possible mechanism underlying the asso-
ciation between obesity and colorectal cancer in men.98 
 
The increased concentrations of circulating insulin 
induced by adiposity are higher among men than 
women,99  and men are more prone to abdominal fat-
ness than women.100  Furthermore, endogenous and 
exogenous oestrogens have been associated with pro-
tective effects against colorectal cancer among women, 
which might explain why the association of adiposity 
with colorectal cancer is stronger in men than in 
women.101 102  Two Mendelian randomisation studies 
found statistically significant positive associations 
between adult body mass index and colorectal cancer 
but did not perform analyses by sex.92 
103
We found that higher body mass index was associ-
ated with an increased risk of oesophageal adenocarci-
noma, and this was supported by strong evidence. We 
found an inverse association for oesophageal squa-
mous cell carcinoma, which was supported by highly 
suggestive evidence due to considerable heterogeneity 
between studies. Similar summary associations were 
found by the WCRF and IARC, which concluded that 
adiposity convincingly increased the risk of oesopha-
geal adenocarcinoma.84 
104  A Mendelian randomisation 
study supports this association.105  Oesophageal squa-
mous cell carcinoma has stronger associations with 
smoking and alcohol consumption than oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma,106  but we were unable to capture the 
potential residual confounding or effect modification of 
smoking and alcohol in the associations between adi-
posity and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
because the published meta-analysis did not report 
these subgroup analyses.62
We found an inverse association between body mass 
index and lung cancer that was supported by highly sug-
gestive evidence but had substantial heterogeneity 
between studies and evidence of small study effects. 
When we investigated this association by smoking sta-
tus, we found an inverse association between body mass 
index and lung cancer among smokers, which was sup-
ported by suggestive evidence. We found a non-signifi-
cant association among non-smokers. These results may 
be due to residual confounding, reverse causation, or 
effect modification by smoking, which led the WCRF and 
IARC to grade this evidence as inadequate.84 107  Two 
recent Mendelian randomisation studies found that 
body mass index was statistically significantly associ-
ated with an increased risk of squamous and small cell 
lung cancer but had a borderline significant inverse 
association with lung adenocarcinoma.92 
108  One of the 
Mendelian randomisation studies found a statistically 
significant inverse association between body mass index 
and total lung cancer among never smokers and a null 
association in ever smokers,108 which contradicts the 
epidemiological evidence. However, these analyses 
were underpowered. Future large prospective studies 
should evaluate associations according to smoking sta-
tus among different disease subtypes.
Furthermore, we found that the associations between 
body mass index and multiple myeloma and cancers of 
the biliary tract system, pancreas, and kidney were sup-
ported by strong evidence. The WCRF and IARC ratings 
were similar, except the WCRF did not study multiple 
myeloma.84 
85 The associations for less common malig-
nancies are supported by limited data and show substan-
tial heterogeneity between studies; we need prospective 
studies to better characterise these associations.

limitations of this study
Our review relied on previously published meta-analy-
ses and the literature searches performed by the 
authors of those meta-analyses. Some studies may have 
been missed, although this is unlikely to have influ-
enced our findings because our assessment of duplicate 
meta-analyses on the same exposure-outcome associa-
tions gave similar summary results. Some of the 
meta-analyses that used continuous measures of adi-
posity were published as long ago as 2008, which may 
mean that we didn’t include the most recent evidence. 
However, we found that the evidence grading for 
recently published meta-analyses investigating the 
association of categorical terms of body mass index 
with the same cancers was similar.
We evaluated all study specific results that were 
reported in the meta-analyses (for example, primary 
cancers, cancer subtypes, sex, menopausal status, 
smoking status, and HRT use), but we may have missed 
other subanalyses that were not reported with sufficient 
study specific data. Assessing the quality of the primary 
studies included in the meta-analyses was beyond the 
scope of this umbrella review. Finally, the statistical 
tests we used to assess bias do not prove its definitive 
presence or its exact source. However, our estimates are 
likely to be conservative, as a negative test does not 
exclude the potential for bias. Moreover, our evidence 
grading was not sensitive to the use of 95% prediction 
intervals, excess significance tests, or credibility ceil-
ings, because when we consecutively removed these 
criteria from the quality of evidence algorithm, the 
resulting inference remained the same.
Conclusion
The association between obesity and risk of developing 
or dying from cancer has been extensively studied. We 
found strong evidence to support the positive associa-
tion between obesity and 11 of the 36 cancer sites and 
subtypes that we examined, predominantly comprising 
cancers of the digestive organs and hormone related 
malignancies in women. Substantial uncertainty 
remains for the other cancers. To draw firmer conclu-
sions we need prospective studies and large consor-
tiums with better assessment of the changing nature of 
body fatness and with comprehensive standardised 
reporting of analyses. As obesity becomes one of the 
greatest public health problems worldwide, evidence of 
the strength of the associations between obesity and 
cancer may allow finer selection of people at high risk, 
who could be selected for personalised primary and 
secondary prevention strategies.
