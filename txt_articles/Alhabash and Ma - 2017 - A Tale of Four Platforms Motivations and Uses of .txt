Introduction
Social media are generally defined as “Internet-based, disen-
trained, and persistent channels of masspersonal communi-
cation facilitating perceptions of interactions among users, 
deriving value primarily from user-generated content” (Carr 
& Hayes, 2015, p. 49). In other words, social media can be 
any form of computer-mediated communication where indi-
viduals not only set up profiles to present who they but also 
generate content of their own, see, and interact with content 
of their friends or other users online (Carr & Hayes, 2015). 
Social networking sites (SNSs), a subdomain of social media, 
have been defined as
a networked communication platform in which participants 1) 
have uniquely identifiable profiles that consist of user-supplied 
content, content provided by other users, and/or system-provided 
data; 2) can publicly articulate connections that can be viewed 
and traversed by others; and 3) can consume, produce, and/or 
interact with streams of user-generated content provided by their 
connections on the site. (Ellison & boyd, 2013, p. 157)
SNSs generally entail the creation and maintenance of online 
relationships, both personal and professional, via various 
platforms (Schauer, 2015).
Nearly, two-thirds of all American adults and three-quar-
ters of Internet users report using one or more SNSs (Perrin, 
2015). While young adults (aged 18–29 years) have the high-
est social media adoption rates (90%), other age groups—for 
example, teenagers and older adults—are also exhibiting 
exponential growth in social media adoption rates (Perrin, 
2015). Across different social media platforms, the numbers 
of users are exceeding hundreds of millions and in some 
cases (i.e., Facebook) exceed the number of citizens in the 
world’s largest country. While Twitter was widely popular a 
few years ago, newer social media such as Instagram and 
Snapchat are rising in popularity. Facebook remains popular 
among young adults, yet it is being abandoned by teens 
migrating to Instagram and Snapchat (Duncan, 2016; Lang, 
2015; Matthews, 2014).

A Tale of Four Platforms: Motivations and 
Uses of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, 
and Snapchat Among College Students?
Saleem Alhabash and Mengyan Ma
Abstract
The current research explores differences between Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat in terms of intensity of 
use, time spent daily on the platform, and use motivations. The study applies the uses and gratifications (U&G) approach to 
contrast the four platforms. A cross-sectional survey of college students (N 
= 
396) asked participants to indicate the intensity 
of using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat as well as nine different use motivations. Findings show that participants 
spent the most time daily on Instagram, followed by Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter, respectively. They also indicated the 
highest use intensity for Snapchat and Instagram (nearly equally), followed by Facebook and Twitter, respectively. With 
regard to use motivations, Snapchat takes the lead in five of the nine motivations. Findings are discussed in relation to the 
U&G approach and uniqueness of different social media and social networking sites (SNSs).

Social Media + Society
The changing nature of social media makes for an inter-
esting comparative analysis of the leading platforms. This 
study explores differences in uses and gratifications (U&G) 
among Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat,1 and, in 
doing so, aims to better understand the uniqueness of each 
platform. This study applies the U&G approach across plat-
forms to predict use intensity from a set of nine use motiva-
tions. Before providing the study’s theoretical framework, 
the next section introduces each of the platforms examined in 
this study.
Literature Review
From the World’s Largest Country to the Fastest-
Growing Movement
Facebook. Facebook is the most popular SNS. Per the com-
pany’s website, “Facebook’s mission is to give people the 
power to share and make the world more open and con-
nected” (Facebook, 2016). Facebook allows people to con-
nect with friends, family members, and acquaintances and 
gives people the opportunity to post and share content such 
as photos and status updates (Stec, 2015). Founded in 2004, 
the platform has over a billion active daily users and over 
1.65 billion monthly active users, with a majority of users 
accessing it via mobile devices (Facebook, 2016). About 
three quarters of Internet users report having a Facebook 
account, and 7 in 10 users report accessing the site daily, 
highlighting the habitual and ritualized nature of Facebook 
use (Duggan, 2015b). The majority of young adults (18–
29 years old) report using Facebook (87%), yet this age 
group experienced a 5% drop in usage rates from 2013 to 
2015, however, there was no significant change in Facebook 
usage rates among Internet adult users (Duggan, 2015a; 
Duggan, Ellison, Lampe, Lenhart, & Madden, 2015).
Twitter. Founded in 2006, Twitter has been categorized as a 
microblogging site, where users interact in “real time” using 
140 character tweets to their followers. Users can converse 
using mentions, replies, and hashtags (Stec, 2015). Despite 
reports indicating declining popularity and importance of 
Twitter amid diminishing investment (Fiegerman, 2016; 
Tsukayama, 2016), Duggan (2015b) reports no major 
changes in the percentage of Internet adult users who have 
active Twitter accounts. One-third of online young adults 
between the ages of 18 and 29 years reported using Twitter 
in 2013, compared to 37% who used it in 2014 and 32% in 
2015 (Duggan, 2015a; Duggan et al., 2015). Over the past 
few years, data about the number of Twitter users have faced 
critique over credibility, as Twitter overestimates the num-
ber of users by including accounts that have not been active 
for long periods of time (Bennett, 2011). Nonetheless, 
recently Twitter released that it has 320 million active users 
with 1 billion unique monthly visits to sites from embedded 
tweets (Twitter, 2016).
Instagram. Instagram is a photo-sharing mobile application 
that allows users to take pictures, apply filters to them, and 
share them on the platform itself, as well as other platforms 
like Facebook and Twitter (Stec, 2015). Per the company’s 
website, Instagram has over 400 million active monthly 
users who shared over 40 billion pictures, with an average of 
3.5 billion daily likes for >80 million photos shared daily on 
the site (Instagram, 2016). More than half of young adults 
(18–29 years old) report using Instagram, thus making them 
the largest group of Instagram users (Duggan, 2015a; Dug-
gan et al., 2015).
Snapchat. Snapchat is a social media mobile application that 
lets users send and receive time-sensitive photos and videos, 
which expire upon viewing (Stec, 2015). The number of Snap-
chat users has grown significantly in recent years because of 
its recordability and modality affordances. The recordability 
affordance allows users to post photos, videos, and text mes-
sages that disappear after 24 hours. Regarding Snapchat’s 
modality affordance feature, users communicate with others 
through photographs and video clips (up to 10 s long), while 
also adding filters to their photos and videos (Waddell, 2016). 
Specific to Snapchat—which has also been recently adopted 
by Instagram—is the ability for individuals to select the audi-
ence viewing their content. Users can post their photo or video 
snaps to their own stories, public stories, or privately send 
them to other users (much like direct messaging on Facebook 
and Twitter). Recent estimates show that there are over 100 
million Snapchat users worldwide (Piwek & Joinson, 2016). 
With roughly a quarter of young adults (18–29 years old) using 
Snapchat, this platform was rated as the third-most popular 
social media platform after Facebook and Instagram (Duggan, 
2013; Utz, Muscanell, & Khalid, 2015).
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat are the four 
leading social media platforms. Per Lenhart (2015), young 
adults or millennials are the heaviest social media adopters 
and users. They are born and have grown up with pervasive 
information communication technologies (ICTs) and do not 
know life without them; something that has become a defin-
ing common characteristic of this generational group (Cotten, 
McCullough, & Adams, 2011; Palfrey & Gasser, 2008). 
Millennials use social media for a variety of reasons, includ-
ing communication with friends and family members, infor-
mation seeking, and social relationship maintenance, among 
others (Ito et al., 2008; Ling, 2008; Palfrey & Gasser, 2008). 
This study explores differences in the U&G of the four lead-
ing social media platforms. The following section provides 
an overview of the U&G approach as a theoretical frame-
work for our study.
U&G: A Theoretical Framework
The U&G approach has evolved in parallel to growing diver-
sity and pervasiveness of ICTs. The emergence of social 
media and SNSs extended the U&G approach to include a 
 Alhabash and Ma 
3
larger set of motivations and different forms of identifying 
usage behaviors. Before we discuss the evolution of U&G 
per the emergence of social media, we briefly review U&G’s 
basic assumptions.
U&G has five major assumptions related to the nature of 
media and their users: (a) audience members are active and 
goal-oriented consumers of media; (b) people gratify cer-
tain needs when using media; (c) as media satisfy needs, 
they become sources of competition to other need-satisfy-
ing sources; (d) media users are aware of their interests and 
motives and have certain expectations of media that help 
them with media selection and need gratification; and (e) 
media users are the ones capable of judging the quality of 
media (Katz, 1959; Katz, Blumler, & Gurevitch, 1973). 
Considering that media gratify basic human needs (e.g., 
social, psychological, and physiological), the study of 
U&G takes into consideration users’ psychosocial individ-
ual differences, media use motivations (e.g., information, 
entertainment, surveillance, personal relationship, identity, 
and diversion, among others), and media use effects or con-
sequences to form an understanding of how and why people 
use media (Katz, Blumler, & Gurevitch, 1973; Papacharissi, 
2008; Rosengren, 1974).
U&G is both one of the most-often used and criticized 
theoretical frameworks. There are four major areas of cri-
tique: (a) conceptual ambiguity of motivations, needs, and 
uses; (b) lack of a uniform way of measuring media use and 
heavy reliance on self-reports; (c) problematic assumption 
related to awareness of needs by users and being too indi-
vidualistic while disregarding other contextual and cultural 
influences; and (d) limited explanatory power (Rayburn, 
1996). Despite these limitations, the concept of understand-
ing why people use media is an essential empirical question 
that continues to change with media development. While 
enhancing the framework’s relevance, continued growth and 
diversification of ICTs brings the challenge of diminishing 
consistency across media types as well as the emergence of a 
new set of motivations and uses in light to expand the U&G 
framework (Ruggiero, 2000). The ICT boom has also led to 
the reconciliation of some U&G assumptions, such as the 
assumption about the active nature of media audiences, given 
that ICT affordances facilitate individualistic and active 
information seeking and selection (Anderson & Meyer, 
1975; Chen, 2015; Dicken-Garcia, 1998; Morris & Ogan, 
1996; Newhagen & Rafaeli, 1996; Rayburn, 1996; Ruggiero, 
2000; Swanson, 1979).
The diversity of options offered by the Internet creates a 
challenge for U&G scholars. In abstract terms, the Internet 
has a set of unifying characteristics (e.g., demassification, 
interactivity, asynchronicity, hypertextuality, packet switch-
ing, and multimedia; Ruggiero, 2000). However, one can no 
longer regard the Internet as a single homogeneous channel 
that conveys uniform messages. Social media offer numer-
ous opportunities distinguishable from those offered by other 
Internet services and traditional media in functionality and 
structure that manifest themselves on system and user levels. 
This study takes this approach to shed light on cross-plat-
form differences in social media U&G.
U&G: The Unique Case of Social Media
The distinctive affordances of SNSs not only redefine exist-
ing U&G that have been previously documented with tradi-
tional forms of media but also the changing nature of using 
SNSs changes the gratifications sought and obtained from 
SNSs and reshuffles their order of importance in comparison 
with traditional media, as well as in a way that reflects the 
specific features of each platform. The following section 
reviews past studies that used the U&G theoretical frame-
work to examine different SNSs.
Mäntymäki and Islam (2016) suggest that the use of SNSs 
has both positive and negative influences. Using the U&G 
approach, Mäntymäki and Islam (2016) placed social 
enhancement and interpersonal connectivity as positive grat-
ifications, while exhibitionism and voyeurism as negative 
gratifications for SNS use. Exhibitionism, interpersonal con-
nectivity, and voyeurism, respectively, were the strongest 
predictor of SNS use and so was the number of SNS friends 
(Mäntymäki & Islam, 2016). Mäntymäki and Islam (2014) 
found that content consumption and content production on 
SNSs are associated with different motivations: voyeurism 
and exhibitionism, respectively.
Seidman (2013) suggests that use of SNSs can help users 
build, communicate, and interact with other people as a way 
to maintain social relationships. In regard to positive behav-
iors, such as self-promotion, Belk (2013) found that self-
disclosure (Hollenbaugh & Ferris, 2014) could be gratified 
through social media use. However, Marwick (2012) sug-
gests that following users on social media without the aim of 
maintaining or developing relationships can be a form of 
social surveillance or voyeurism as depicted by Mäntymäki 
and Islam (2014, 2016).
People use social media to obtain information about 
others (Lampe, Ellison, & Steinfield, 2006). The informa-
tion gained helps them maintain interpersonal relation-
ships, as depicted by Seidman (2013), thus helping them 
fulfill their need to belong (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). 
Others use social media to meet like-minded individuals as 
well as to receive companionship and social support 
(Wellman & Gulia, 1999). However, Jung and Sundar 
(2016) found that senior citizens over 60 years old used 
social media, specifically Facebook, for social bonding, 
social bridging, curiosity, and as a vehicle for responding 
to family member requests. Joinson (2008) identified 
seven motivations for Facebook use among college stu-
dents: social connection, shared identities, photographs, 
content, social investigation, social network surfing, 
 
and status updates. Additionally, the author found that 
entertainment-related content motivated younger users to 
spend more time on Facebook.

Social Media + Society
Whiting and Williams (2013) identified 10 motivations 
for using social media: social interaction, information seek-
ing, passing time, entertainment, relaxation, communicatory 
utility, convenience utility, expression of opinion, informa-
tion sharing, and surveillance or knowledge about others. 
Comparing Facebook and Snapchat, Stanley (2015) found 
that undergraduates more frequently use Snapchat than 
Facebook and expressed motivations to increase networking 
when joining Facebook as opposed to peer pressure and con-
tent appeal that drive Snapchat use. Stanley (2015) also 
found a gender difference in U&G of Facebook and Snapchat. 
Females were found to join Facebook and Snapchat in order 
to monitor life of families and friends, whereas males join 
Facebook to network and meet new people.
The earlier stages of investigating the U&G of social 
media platforms, mostly in relation to Facebook use, have 
centered on the social value of social media as it relates to 
interacting and connecting with friends. For example, ear-
lier studies on Facebook showed that connecting and stay-
ing in touch with friends, family, and acquaintances; 
maintaining social ties; and keeping up with old friends, 
among other socially relevant motivations were the pri-
mary motives for using a platform like Facebook (Quan-
Haase & Young, 2010; Raacke & Bonds-Raacke, 2008). 
However, over the past 12 years, the nature of Facebook, as 
well as other social media platforms, evolved in such a 
way where other motivations are advancing in salience. 
Entertainment, medium appeal, and self-documentation 
have become more prevalent and predictive of usage pat-
terns among Facebook users (Alhabash, Chiang, & Huang, 
2014; Alhabash, Park, Kononova, Chiang, & Wise, 2012; 
Karlis, 2013).
The nature of Twitter, with its limited 140-character 
tweets, redefined the types of motivations and gratifications 
that users seek. Liu, Cheung, and Lee (2010) found that 
information sharing and social interaction were most predic-
tive of expressed intentions to continue using Twitter. 
Similarly, Johnson and Yang (2009) found that information 
sharing motivations were moderately correlated with time 
spent on the site weekly and frequency of visits per week. 
Park (2013) found that among opinion leaders on Twitter, 
their motivations of information seeking, mobilization, and 
public expression predicted their use of Twitter within a 
political context.
Research on both Instagram and Snapchat is still in its 
infancy due to the recent increase in adoption rates. Sheldon 
and Bryant (2016) found that Instagram users place less 
emphasis on connecting with other people and more on per-
sonal identity and self-promotion, in addition to other 
motives, including surveillance and knowledge gathering 
about others, documentation of life events and general cool-
ness, which includes self-promotion and displaying creativ-
ity such as photography skills. This particular study found 
that surveillance was the strongest motivation for Instagram 
usage.
With regard to Snapchat, Waddell (2016) indicated that 
Snapchat’s recordability affordance feature provides gratifi-
cation of maintaining privacy while the modality affordance 
feature offers users better opportunities for self-expression 
than text-based communication technologies. The photo-
graphs were also found to afford users capacity to establish 
and maintain connections with family members, friends, or 
significant others regardless of the geographical distance. 
Utz et al. (2015) found that participants were more inclined 
to send humorous snaps (photos or videos) as well as selfies 
(photos or videos of themselves). In comparing the motiva-
tions to use Snapchat and Facebook, Utz et al. (2015) found 
that distraction or procrastination was the highest motivation 
to use Snapchat, while maintaining social connection was the 
highest for Facebook. Finally, Utz et al. (2015) found that 
Snapchat use is associated with higher feelings of jealousy 
compared to Facebook. Piwek and Joinson (2016) found that 
Snapchat users primarily use it to communicate with close 
friends and family members, thus highlighting the impor-
tance of private communication. Additionally, a few studies 
highlighted the differentiating factors about Snapchat use 
 
in that it affords more personal and private communication 
with close friends and family with lower emphasis on self-
presentation and impression management (Bayer, Ellison, 
Schoenbeck, & Falk, 2015; Piwek & Joinson, 2016; 
Vaterlaus, Barnett, Roche, & Young, 2016).
Past literature points to a number of observations about 
the overall view of the U&G of social media platforms. First, 
past research suggests that affordances and functionality of 
each platform yield a unique set of motivations and gratifica-
tions sought and obtained through platform use. Second, as 
sociotechnical systems evolve and strive for continued rein-
vigoration by updating their design and functionality, moti-
vations and usage patterns also change. Third, while each 
platform has unique features and motivations for using it, 
there could be common and complimentary motivations 
across platforms.
Considering the limited number of studies that compare 
U&G across different social media platforms (Stanley, 2015), 
this study aims to explore cross-platform differences in use 
intensity, time spent daily on the platform, and use motiva-
tions. Past research has operationalized Facebook use with 
the Facebook intensity scale (e.g., Ellison, Steinfield, & 
Lampe, 2007), which includes a set of affective and cogni-
tive attitudinal measures of Facebook use as well as refer-
ence to the number of Facebook friends and time spent on the 
platform. In this study, we define Facebook intensity in 
exclusion of the number of Facebook friends and time spent 
daily on it and focused on defining intensity as it related to 
the evaluative component of Facebook use (cognitive and 
affective). We asked the following questions:
RQ1. What are the differences, if any, in use intensity, 
time spent daily, and motivations to use Facebook, 
Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat?
 Alhabash and Ma

RQ2. How do motivations to use Facebook, Twitter, 
Instagram, and Snapchat and time spent daily on the plat-
form predict the intensity of platform use?
Method
Sample
To answer the study’s research questions, we conducted a 
cross-sectional survey of college students (N = 396), recruited 
through a student subject pool at Michigan State University. 
Participants were recruited online and completed the survey 
anonymously via Qualtrics.com and received course or extra 
credit for participation. A total of 33 participants were 
excluded for failing quality control check questions, thus 
reducing the sample size to 363 participants. A larger propor-
tion of the sample identified as female (64.6%), with a mean 
age of about 22 years (SD = 2.98 years), and mostly White 
(79.3%). With regard to having active accounts on the four 
social media platforms, 97.2% reported having an account 
on Facebook, 79.1% on Twitter, 87.1% on Instagram, and 
84.3% on Snapchat. For cross-platform analyses, we only 
used participants who indicated they had active accounts on 
all four platforms, which reduced the sample size to 240 for 
certain statistical analyses.
Operational Measures
All scale items used in this study were measured using a 
seven-point Likert-type scale anchored by “Strongly 
Disagree” to “Strongly Agree.” A detailed list of all items is 
provided in Appendix. To measure the intensity of using 
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat, we used six 
items adapted from Ellison et al.’s (2007). We also asked par-
ticipants to indicate the amount of time they spent daily on 
each of the platforms using two drop-down menus: one for 
hours per day and another for minutes per day that were com-
bined into overall minutes per day. As for motivations to use 
each platform, we used Liu et al.’s (2010) list of motivations. 
In total, we asked participants to express their agreement/
disagreement with statements pertaining to the following 
motivations for information sharing (three items), self-docu-
mentation (three items), social interaction (three items), 
entertainment (two items), passing time (three items), self-
expression (two items), medium appeal (one item), and con-
venience (two items). Additionally, we asked participants to 
indicate the number of friends/followers they have on the 
platform. Specific to Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat, we 
also asked participants to indicate the number of users that 
the participants follow on the platforms. For all questions 
related to the number of friends or followers, participants 
were instructed to enter the number using an open-ended 
question. Averaged variables were created for multi-item 
construct following satisfactory factor and reliability analy-
sis results (see Appendix). Additionally, we included demo-
graphic control variables, where we asked participants to 
indicate their sex (male vs. female), age by indicating their 
birth year, ethnic background (multiple choice question: 
Asian, Black/African American, Native American/Alaska 
Native, and White), and class standing (freshman, sopho-
more, junior, senior, MA student, PhD student, and other).
Results
Cross-Platform Differences
Research question 1 inquired about the differences between 
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat in terms of use 
intensity, time spent daily, and motivations to use each plat-
form. To answer this research question, data for each mea-
sure of interest (time spent, use intensity, and nine 
motivations) were submitted to a four (platform)-repeated 
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results are sum-
marized in Table 1.
Results show that participants spent the greatest amount of 
time on Instagram (M = 108.73, SD = 101.55), followed by 
Snapchat (M = 107.15, SD = 106.47), Facebook (M = 106.35, 
SD = 94.65), and Twitter (M = 88.92, SD = 104.14), respectively, 
F(3, 223) = 3.37, p < .05, ηp

 (see Figure 1). Pairwise 
comparisons showed that the difference between Twitter and 
Instagram was significant (p < .05) and that between Twitter 
and Snapchat approached significance (p = .057), while the 
other pairwise differences were not significant.
As for the intensity to use each platform, participants 
expressed the highest intensity to use Snapchat (M = 5.07, 
SD = 1.44), followed by Instagram (M = 5.06, SD = 1.56), 
Facebook (M = 4.49, SD = 1.41) and Twitter (M = 4.22, 
SD = 1.83), respectively, F(3, 237) = 24.43, p < .001, ηp

(see Figure 2). Pairwise comparisons showed that all cross-
platform differences were significant (p < .05) except for the 
difference between Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and 
Snapchat.
Results showed that all motivations, except for informa-
tion sharing, were significantly different across the four 
social media platforms. Results are summarized in Table 1 
and Figure 3; thus, we will limit this report to highlighting 
trends and similarities across motivations. A trend in the 
prevalence of use motivations related to self-documentation, 
social interaction, entertainment, passing time, and conve-
nience emerged across the four platforms. Snapchat takes the 
lead in these five motivations, followed by Instagram, 
Facebook, and Twitter, respectively. With regard to self-
expression motivations, we see that Instagram slightly leads, 
followed by Snapchat, Twitter, then Facebook, respectively. 
Snapchat takes the lead for medium appeal, followed by 
Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, respectively.
Predicting Use Intensity Across Platforms
Research question 2 deals with exploring the ways in which 
the nine motivations to use each of the four platforms and 
time spent on the site predict the intensity of using Facebook, 
 6 
Social Media + Society
Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. To answer this question, 
we ran comparable ordinary least squares (OLS) hierarchical 
regression models. All four regression models include plat-
form use intensity as a criterion variable, the demographic 
variables (age, sex, ethnicity, and class standing) as predic-
tors in the first block, and the eight motivations, as well as 
time spent on the platform daily, the number of friends/fol-
lowers and the number of users they follow (applicable to all 
except Facebook), as predictors in the second block. The risk 
for multicollinearity was assessed for each model and was 
deemed acceptable. Tolerance scores ranged from .17 to .92, 
and the variance inflation factor (VIF) ranged between 1.14 
and 5.49. There were only two predictors in the Twitter 
model with a VIF score exceeding 5; however, we chose to 
keep the predictors in that model for the sake of comparabil-
ity across platforms.
As summarized in Table 2, results showed that demo-
graphic variables explained between 4% and 13% of the 
variance in intensity to use each of the platforms. Females 
reported greater intensity to use Facebook and Instagram 
than males, while males reported higher intensity to use 
Twitter. Participants also indicated greater intensity to use 
Twitter and Snapchat if they were in lower class standing 
(e.g., freshmen and sophomore). Finally, ethnic background 
only predicted Twitter and Instagram intensity. However, 
except for gender’s maintained prediction of the intensity to 
use 
Twitter 
(males > females) 
and 
Instagram 
(females > males), 
all of the demographic variables become nonsignificant with 
the introduction of the U&G variables.
The second block of predictors (U&G variables) added 
between 51% and 61% of the variance explained in the inten-
sity to use each of the four platforms, thus amounting to a 
total variance explained range of 58%–66%. Across the four 
platforms, entertainment was consistently the strongest pre-
dictor of use intensity. The intensity to use Facebook was 
significantly predicted by entertainment, time spent daily on 
the platform, self-documentation, and convenience (margin-
ally), respectively. Entertainment, time spent daily, conve-
nience, and gender, respectively, significantly predicted the 
intensity to use Twitter. Instagram use intensity was signifi-
cantly predicted by entertainment, self-documentation, the 
number of users followed, self-expression, gender, time 
spent daily, and passing time, respectively. Finally, entertain-
ment, convenience, the number of friends, self-expression, 
and time spent daily, respectively, were significant predictors 
of the intensity to use Snapchat.

Discussion
This study explored social media U&G across four different 
popular platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and 
Snapchat using a sample of college students. Following is a 
summary of the study’s main findings.
Our study showed that participants spent the greatest 
amount of time on Instagram and Snapchat, then Facebook 
and Twitter. The increasing popularity of Instagram and 
Snapchat has also been shown in other studies (see Stanley, 
2015). This was also mirrored in the findings related to use 
intensity, where participants rated their intensity of using 
Instagram and Snapchat higher than that of Facebook and 
Twitter. In other words, participants indicated a greater inten-
sity of use—or more accurately more favorable affective and 
cognitive attitudes toward—Instagram and Snapchat than 
Facebook and Twitter.
With regard to the motivations to use each platform, par-
ticipants reported using all four platforms equally to share 
information. Across the four platforms, the two-highest rated 
motivations were for entertainment and convenience. As 
noted by prior studies (e.g., Alhabash et al., 2014), there are 
changing values attached to using social media that move 
beyond the hypothesized value of socialization and social 
networking. Our findings showed little to no association 
between network size (i.e., the number of friends/followers) 
and the intensity to use each platform. Alhabash et al. (2014) 
pointed that over the past few years, the average number of 
friends and followers on SNSs such as Facebook has been 
exponentially increasing. This increase in network size 
makes it impossible to primarily use platforms like Facebook 
or Instagram to connect and socialize simply because the 
user has a large number of friends that makes it hard to main-
tain relationships with all of them. This is why, we argue, 
Figure 3. Mean differences in motivations to use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat.

Social Media + Society
passive use motivations, such as entertainment and conve-
nience, take precedence over social interaction.
The four platforms deviate from similarity when inspect-
ing the other use motivations. For example, following conve-
nience and entertainment, participants reported they use 
Facebook for passing time, medium appeal, information shar-
ing, self-expression, social interaction, and self-documenta-
tion motivations, respectively. As for Twitter, motivations 
other than entertainment and convenience include medium 
appeal, passing time, self-expression, information sharing, 
social interaction, and self-documentation, respectively. It is 
worth noting that for both Facebook and Twitter, information 
sharing was the sixth-highest motivation, compared to the 
least rated motivation for Snapchat and Instagram.
Convenience, medium appeal, passing time, self-expres-
sion, self-documentation, social interaction, and information 
sharing, respectively, were the motivations to use Instagram. 
As for Snapchat, we see that after entertainment and conve-
nience, medium appeal, passing time, self-expression, self-
documentation, social interaction, and information sharing 
followed, respectively (see Figure 4).
The regression results also point to intriguing contrasts 
across the four platforms. Before looking how use motiva-
tions predict intensity of use, it is important to look at the 
relationship between the time participants spent daily using 
the platform and the intensity of use, which was a significant 
predictor for all platforms. However, we see that the contri-
bution of usage time to the intensity of use is greater for

Facebook and Twitter than it is for Instagram and Snapchat. 
It is the plausible that the nature and progression of 
Facebook and Twitter lend themselves to greater time 
engagement than Instagram and Snapchat. Another plau-
sible explanation is that Facebook and Twitter have been 
in use for a longer period of time than Instagram and 
Snapchat. For our sample, participants reported that, on 
average, they have been using Facebook for 6.65 years 
(SD = 1.77 years), followed by Twitter (M = 4.20 years, 
SD = 1.60 years), Instagram (M = 3.50 years, SD = 1.27 years), 
and Snapchat (M = 2.85 years, SD = 1.23 years), F(3, 221) =

. What this suggests is that partici-
pants had a longer period to time to ritualize their use of each 
of these platforms, and therefore, their attitudes toward the 
medium (use intensity) is positively related to how time they 
spend daily on the medium.
As found in previous studies (e.g., Alhabash et al., 2014), 
our findings showed that the strongest predictor of use inten-
sity was the motivation to use the platform for entertainment 
purposes. Our findings also suggest a few contrasts across 
the different platforms. Facebook use intensity is also driven 
by self-documentation, convenience, and self-expression. 
Twitter use intensity is also driven by convenience motiva-
tions. Instagram use intensity is also predicted by self-docu-
mentation and passing time. Finally, the intensity of using 
Snapchat is predicted further by convenience and self-
expression. Snapchat and Instagram were the only platforms 
in which network size (number of followers and the number 
of users followed, respectively) mattered in terms of use 
intensity, plausibly due to the nature of interactions on it and 
its novelty, therefore placing greater emphasis on the size of 
the audience of friends compared to other platforms.
Implications
This study is one of few that compared the U&G of four 
leading social media and SNS platforms among college stu-
dents. The most apparent theoretical implication for this 
study is the similarities and dissimilarities across the four 
different platforms in relation to usage patterns and motiva-
tions. The distinctiveness of each platform is certainly 
reflected in several ways in relation to time spent daily on the 
platforms, to the different motivations, and how the motiva-
tions predict use intensity.
The second implication deals with the robustness of the 
U&G approach in predicting use-related evaluations and 
behaviors from motivations. Despite critiques of the U&G 
approach, the regression models reported here predict more 
than half of the variance in use intensity across the four plat-
forms. However, it is worth mentioning that per the U&G 
approach, we followed a general and plausibly standardized 
approach to measuring uses and motivations; therefore, future 
research should attempt at understanding the uniqueness of 
the general motivational expressions per each platform. For 
example, does using Facebook for self-documentation is sim-
ilar to that motivation on Snapchat where messages disappear 
after a certain period of time?
Third, it is important to note the differences between what 
we could term as “old” and “new” social media platforms. 
Our findings showed that fewer motivations predicted the 
intensity to use Facebook and Twitter (e.g., entertainment for 
both and self-documentation for Facebook), while more 
motivations come into play in predicting the intensity to use 
Instagram and Snapchat. This suggests that as social media 
platforms age, the motivations—and to a certain extent, the 
gratifications sought and obtained from them—become har-
monious, whereas newer platforms have room for a more 
diverse set of motivations and gratifications sought and 
obtained. In a different light, Instagram and Snapchat are 
perceived as more specialized media than Facebook and 
Twitter, which could potentially influence the diversity of 
motivations sought and obtained from their use.
Fourth, our findings showed that network size had little to 
no influence on the intensity of using the different social 
media platforms. With the exception of Snapchat and 
Instagram, the number of friends and followers and those 
participants followed did not predict the intensity of use. 
This can also be understood within the lens of the “old” ver-
sus “new” platforms presented in the previous paragraph. 
Longevity of use could impact how salient the size of one’s 
network is, yet new platform use may leave more room for 
the influence of one’s network size.

Social Media + Society
Our findings also provide professional communicators—
be them advertisers, marketers, PR practitioners, or health 
communicators—with a deeper understanding of the com-
plexities and intricacies of dealing with social media audi-
ences. Understanding user motivations, from a theoretical 
perspective, should inform professional communicators as 
they design campaigns on social media. The high emphasis 
on entertainment by our participants should lead these pro-
fessional communicators to designing campaigns that adhere 
to and gratify these motivations for engagement and continu-
ity purposes.
Limitations and Future Research
Our study used a college-student sample, with a majority of 
female and White participants. Despite the fact that young 
adults are the heaviest adopters and users of social media and 
social networking platforms, our results cannot be general-
ized to the entire population of social media users. Future 
studies should replicate our survey with individuals from 
diverse demographic groups.
We took a standardized approach in asking participants 
about their motivations and uses of the different platforms. 
This brings up a number of limitations. First, there could be 
a test–retest effect on the way participants responded to all 
the questions pertaining to each of the platforms. Second, by 
taking a standardized approach, we limited the unraveling of 
unique features and trends related to each of the four plat-
forms. Future research should take a hybrid approach that 
asks standardized questions across different platforms, 
yet allows for unique features to be included in the study 
design. This study explored cross-platform differences in 
uses and gratification of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and 
Snapchat. Our findings showed that newer platforms—
Snapchat and Instagram—are taking the lead in usage and 
motivations for use in several aspects.
Specific to our question about the time spent on each of 
the platforms, we see that participants used the four plat-
forms for a total of about 506 minutes per day. This number 
contradicts industry reports that estimate the amount of time 
spent daily on social media is closer to 120 min (2 hr; Mander, 
2016). It is noteworthy that the averages reported here are 
specific to a college-student sample and are in line with pre-
vious research (e.g., Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2010; 
Junco, 2013); thus, differences with a general population 
sample are inevitable. There are a number of potential threats 
to the validity of our measure of time spent on each platform. 
First, we did not account for simultaneous use of platforms 
(i.e., multitasking). Second, we asked participants to indicate 
the number of hours and minutes spent on each platform, 
which could have been misunderstood by some participants. 
However, we inspected the data for outliers and removed 
cases that appeared out of the ordinary (e.g., spending 23 hr/
day on Facebook). Finally, the nature of asking users to self-
report the time spent on any medium is problematic as it 
relies on retrospection. Junco (2013) showed that there is a 
large discrepancy between self-reported time spent on 
Facebook and actual behavioral data extracted through com-
puter software. The differences were stark: participants 
reported spending 149 min daily on Facebook, while the 
behavioral data showed they spent 26 min/day on average. 
However, the overestimation was consistent across different 
activities, whereas the proportion of time spent on each 
activity matched between the self-report and behavioral data. 
Therefore, while our measure is not without error, we still 
believe that it reflects the relative importance participants 
placed on each platform, and their idea of how involved they 
are with that particular platform.

Note
1. 
Snapchat might not fully adhere to the Ellison and boyd (2013) 
definition of a social network site (SNS). Snapchat users set 
up their profiles and contribute their user-generated content to 
their own stories and other types of stories as well as receive 
content from others (users and system). Additionally, users 
have the ability to interact with other users’ content. However, 
Snapchat does not satisfy the definition’s emphasis on public 
viewership of one’s profile. Nonetheless, the interactive nature 
of Snapchat provides more support for it being an SNS rather 
than not.
