After 800,000 years of making simple Oldowan tools, early humans began manufacturing 
27 
Acheulian handaxes around 1.75 million years ago (Ma). This advance is thought to reflect an 
28 
evolutionary change in hominin cognition and language abilities. We used a neuroarchaeology 
29 
approach to explore this hypothesis, recording brain activity via functional near-infrared 
30 
spectroscopy (fNIRS) as modern human participants learned to make Oldowan and Acheulian 
31 
stone tools in either a verbal or nonverbal training context. Here we show that Acheulian tool 
32 
production requires the integration of visual, auditory, and sensorimotor information in the 
33 
middle and superior temporal cortex, the guidance of visual working memory (VWM) 
34 
representations in the ventral precentral gyrus (PrG), and higher-order action planning via the 
35 
supplementary motor area (SMA), activating a brain network that is also involved in modern 
36 
piano playing. The right analogue to Broca’s area–which has linked tool manufacture and 
37 
language in prior work1,2–was only engaged with verbal training. Acheulian toolmaking, 
38 
therefore, may have more evolutionary ties to playing Mozart than quoting Shakespeare. 
39 
The human brain has increased in absolute and relative size in the last 2-3 million years, 
40 
particularly the prefrontal and temporal cortices3. This increase in brain size undoubtedly 
41 
coincided with the evolution of the distinctive features of modern human cognition4. 
42 
Understanding the link between brain evolution and cognition remains a key scientific challenge 
43 
because it is impossible to observe the functional brain activity of extinct human species to know 
44 
how their brains operated. An innovative approach to this challenge is offered by the field of 
45 
neuroarchaeology. Here, the idea is to use neuroscience methods and theories to investigate the 
46 
evolution of the brain and cognition by capitalizing on the remnants of past material culture from 
47 
the archaeological record5.  
48 
  
3 
Around 1.75 Ma, there was a revolutionary innovation in stone tool technology. Early 
49 
Homo began to incorporate the bifacial, shaped core tools (handaxes and cleavers) of the Acheulian 
50 
industry into their pre-existing repertoire of simple Oldowan flake and pebble tools (Fig. 1d). The 
51 
addition of these multipurpose tools to the hominin toolkit allowed for the exploitation of a wider 
52 
variety of energy-dense food items through functions such as butchery, woodworking, and 
53 
digging6,7,8. The differences in technological complexity between these two tool types could be 
54 
indicative of a shift in cognition and language abilities from a more ape-like to a human-like state. 
55 
What changes in brain and cognition might have led to this advance?  
56 
Evidence suggests that the earliest members of the genus Homo display a trend toward a 
57 
human-like organization of the brain9. Given this, the functional brain activity of modern humans 
58 
as they reproduce the stone toolmaking behaviours of extinct hominins can shed light on the 
59 
functional brain activity of these first hominin toolmakers. This is, of course, an inexact science. 
60 
For instance, we cannot know to what extent the cognitive operations of modern humans resemble 
61 
those of early humans, nor can we pinpoint the effect of modern culture and formal education on 
62 
the cognitive operations of modern humans during toolmaking tasks. We can assume, however, 
63 
that extinct hominins producing the same tool types and using the same operational sequence as 
64 
modern humans likely possessed at least the minimum cognitive operations that modern humans 
65 
use to complete the task.10 Thus, the functional brain activity of modern humans can tentatively be 
66 
used to infer the functional brain activity of earlier human species. Here, we examine functional 
67 
brain activity as modern humans learned to make Early Stone Age (Oldowan and Acheulian) tools 
68 
to shed light on the brain networks and cognitive skills that were needed to complete these tasks 
69 
(Fig. 1a-c).

Acheulian stone tool manufacture is hypothesized to require more cognitive control and 
72 
working memory than Oldowan tool manufacture11. This is because shaping a stone into a handaxe 
73 
and maintaining a sharp edge along the entire piece (see Fig. 1d) requires the toolmaker to proceed 
74 
through a series of complex action sequences that have an ambiguous goal hierarchy12,13. 
75 
Nevertheless, activation of working memory neural circuits has been purportedly absent during 
76 
replicative Oldowan and Acheulian tool production experiments1,14 (but see Supplementary Fig. 1 
77 
and Supplementary Discussion). This may reflect the challenges of using neuroimaging techniques 
78 
like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to capture real-time brain activity during the 
79 
act of making stone tools. For example, two fMRI studies attempted to simulate tool production 
80 
by having participants observe videos of the toolmaking process11,15, rather than actually knapping. 
81 
These studies might have underestimated the role of working memory circuits because participants 
82 
did not have to hold complex action sequences actively in mind during the imaging task. 
83 
Researchers have also hypothesized that a special co-evolutionary relationship exists 
84 
between toolmaking and language because the earliest stage of stone toolmaking skill transmission 
85 
appears to improve with verbal instructions16. Also, studies using positron emission tomography 
86 
(PET), fMRI, and functional transcranial Doppler ultrasonography revealed that both behaviours 
87 
activate overlapping brain regions and present similar cerebral blood flow lateralization 
88 
signatures1,14,15,17. This suggests that language may have piggy-backed on the motor and 
89 
hierarchical processing functions sub-served by the ventral precentral and inferior frontal gyrus 
90 
(IFG), brain areas critically involved in Acheulian tool manufacture2. Because the learning context 
91 
was not carefully controlled in these neuroimaging studies, however, this overlap could be the 
92 
product of learning to knap by receiving verbal instructions from an interactive teacher. It is 
93 
possible, for instance, that participants in these studies relied upon internal speech, recalled 
94 
  
5 
verbally delivered instructions, or enlisted specific language-based behavioural strategies because 
95 
they learned with language instruction18. This may not mimic the learning context that existed 
96 
during the Pleistocene when hominins likely did not possess modern language or the cognitive 
97 
elements required for interactive teaching.   
98 
In the present study, we tested these hypotheses, examining the brain networks that underlie 
99 
Early Stone Age toolmaking by firstly, using image-based fNIRS, a cutting-edge neuroimaging 
100 
technique that measures changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin (oxy-Hb, deoxy-
101 
Hb) in the cortex. This approach produces reconstructed images of localized functional brain 
102 
activity that can be directly compared to fMRI results19,20. Because fNIRS is less influenced by 
103 
motion artefacts than fMRI, it was possible to use fNIRS to measure real-time, localized cortical 
104 
activity as people made Oldowan and Acheulian tools. We predicted that fNIRS would detect a 
105 
relative increase in the activation of brain areas involved in cognitive control and working memory 
106 
during Acheulian tool production when contrasted with Oldowan tool production.  
107 
Secondly, we carefully controlled the learning context. We taught 31 participants to make 
108 
both types of tools across seven learning sessions (Fig. 1e). During individual training sessions, 
109 
fifteen of the participants learned to knap stone via verbal instruction by watching videos of a 
110 
skilled knapper’s actions as he demonstrated and explained how to knap (his face was not visible); 
111 
sixteen of the participants learned to knap via nonverbal instruction using the same instructional 
112 
videos, but with the sound turned off. Brain activity was measured while participants completed a 
113 
motor baseline task that involved striking two rocks together without attempting to make flakes, 
114 
as well as during an Oldowan task and an Acheulian task. We predicted that the two learning 
115 
groups would show different neural activation patterns, with selectively greater activation in 
116 
language-specific brain areas, including the right IFG, in the verbal instruction condition.  
117 
  
6 
A two-way analysis of variance with Task (Oldowan, Acheulian) and Group (verbal, 
118 
nonverbal) as factors (see Supplementary Discussion) replicated the Acheulian-biased activation 
119 
in the left ventral PrG from previous PET research1 (Fig. 2a). This area forms part of the VWM 
120 
network19 (see overlap between dark green and red in Fig. 2a). Working memory is not a uniquely 
121 
human feature, but modern humans have been argued to possess an “enhanced working memory” 
122 
that did not evolve until the late Pleistocene – much later than the onset of Acheulian tool 
123 
manufacture21. Our findings suggest that even stone tool industries as ancient as the early 
124 
Acheulian required working memory. 
125 
The analysis also revealed novel areas of activation associated with Acheulian toolmaking, 
126 
including middle and superior temporal areas (Fig. 2b-c), as well as the SMA (Fig. 2d). The 
127 
temporal areas are involved in complex sound processing, auditory short-term memory, and the 
128 
integration of visual, auditory, and sensorimotor information in relation to tool use22,23,24. The 
129 
SMA forms the cognitive control centre of a medial premotor system whose function is to plan 
130 
complex action sequences, especially those requiring bimanual coordination25. The superior 
131 
temporal gyrus (STG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and SMA are connected via white fibre 
132 
tracts that coalesce at the insular cortex26, which plays a critical role in guiding behaviour via 
133 
attentional modulation27. While blood oxygenation concentrations in the insular cortex are too 
134 
deep to record with fNIRS, this area has been implicated in stone tool production in previous 
135 
work15.  
136 
Acheulian toolmaking depends on the execution of a skilled striking platform setup to plan 
137 
the direction, shape, and size of a series of flakes that will effectively thin and shape the piece28,29. 
138 
The activation of bilateral temporal areas during the Acheulian task may signify that participants 
139 
were holding in mind the varying sounds of impact to judge whether a platform was successfully 
140 
  
7 
prepared for removal of a flake. The ability to plan and execute a flexible sequence of actions to 
141 
make a handaxe could be accomplished by integrating the working memory component of left 
142 
ventral PrG with the complex motor planning of SMA and the auditory feedback and multimodal 
143 
processing of STG and MTG via the insular circuit. Interestingly, this cognitive network is nearly 
144 
identical to one that is active when trained pianists play the piano30, consistent with our proposal 
145 
that this network is critical for audiomotor integration. The relatively weak Oldowan activation in 
146 
this network is also informative. In the Oldowan task, each strike is an independent event that 
147 
attempts to create a flake with a sharp edge; there is little need to actively hold in mind a long 
148 
chain of actions to meet the overarching goal of the task. 
149 
The ANOVA revealed four clusters where the instruction context had an effect on 
150 
cortical activation during the toolmaking tasks (Supplementary Table 2). Post-hoc tests identified 
151 
two areas where the Acheulian task significantly varied by group. A large cluster that includes 
152 
the right temporal pole and pars orbitalis was activated in the nonverbal group and suppressed in 
153 
the verbal group (Mann-Whitney U = 55.0; p = 0.009; Fig. 2e). The right temporal pole is a 
154 
multimodal association cortex involved with semantic processing31 and has strong connections to 
155 
pars orbitalis and the insula32. The right orbital portion of the prefrontal cortex is known to be 
156 
involved in decision-making and reward-related feedback33. This may indicate that the nonverbal 
157 
group relied more extensively on auditory and visuospatial feedback while planning actions 
158 
related to handaxe production. Post-experiment interviews support this claim. Only participants 
159 
in the nonverbal group emphasized sound and tactile sensation as important to their thought 
160 
process while knapping. Their descriptions also mentioned visuo-spatial imagery more often than 
161 
descriptions produced by the verbal group.  
162 
  
8 
The second cluster, pars triangularis of the right IFG, had significantly higher activation 
163 
in the verbal group than the nonverbal group during the Acheulian task (Mann-Whitney U = 
164 
198.0; p = 0.001; Fig. 2f). This right hemisphere analogue to Broca’s area participates in 
165 
language functions, such as syntactic and sentence processing, especially in relation to context34, 
166 
as well as some non-language functions, such as response inhibition35. This suggests that 
167 
participants who received verbal instruction may have engaged in inner speech during the 
168 
Acheulian task, which is supported by post-experiment interviews (Supplementary Fig. 2). 
169 
Critically, this cluster overlapped with the IFG cluster from previous work that led to the 
170 
conclusion that language may have co-opted the neural circuits involved in toolmaking1 (see 
171 
yellow region in Fig. 2f). If language evolved by co-opting the motor areas of the brain that were 
172 
used first for Early Stone Age tool manufacture, then we should observe activation of the right 
173 
IFG in both groups as a result of the complex knapping task. Because this area shows elevated 
174 
activation only among the verbal group participants, this suggests that language instruction in the 
175 
modern learning context is responsible for right IFG activation in this and previous studies. 
176 
Caution is urged, therefore, when interpreting results of neuroarchaeological studies that do not 
177 
control for spoken language in the learning context. 
178 
[Insert Figs. 2-3] 
179 
Unique cortical areas recruited during the Oldowan task include the hand representation 
180 
portions of the primary sensorimotor cortex in both hemispheres (Fig. 3a-b). This suggests the 
181 
involvement of a lateral premotor system, which is dependent on external visual input to recognize 
182 
and assign significance to external objects25. This is unsurprising, as the only goal of the Oldowan 
183 
task is to visually identify ideal platforms and remove flakes until the core is exhausted. An 
184 
evaluation of the video footage captured during the experiment and participant responses during 
185 
  
9 
an exit interview reveal that the absence of activation in these hand areas during the Acheulian 
186 
task might have resulted from participants using the leg rather than the hand as a support for the 
187 
core. Participants also took their time to evaluate progress more often during the Acheulian task 
188 
than during the Oldowan task, which could have resulted in less activation in the hand motor areas. 
189 
The Oldowan task also appears to come under increased cognitive control when it has been 
190 
learned in the absence of verbal instruction (Fig. 3c). For example, it is only in the nonverbal group 
191 
that the left MFG, or frontal eye field, is activated (Mann-Whitney U = 33.0; p < 0.001). This area–
192 
also activated in the study by Stout et al.1 (see yellow cluster in Fig. 3c)–forms part of the dorsal 
193 
visual attention network36. The recruitment of this network only in the nonverbal condition 
194 
suggests that learning to produce simple flakes without language requires increased attention to 
195 
visuospatial demands. When learned verbally, Oldowan tool production elicits activity in the left 
196 
dorsal PrG (Fig. 3d), an area that also is activated when passively reading action words related to 
197 
the arm37.  
198 
Considered together, our findings suggest that Oldowan tool manufacture relies on the 
199 
coordination of visual attention and motor control to successfully remove simple flakes. It would 
200 
not be surprising to find that a homologous cognitive network is active in wild chimpanzees when 
201 
they skilfully crack nuts with stone tools38, or even in capuchin monkeys when they strike two 
202 
stones together, which can sometimes lead to unintentional flakes similar to those made by early 
203 
hominins39. In sum, results of this experiment point to cognitive abilities that were more ape-like 
204 
than human-like among hominin toolmakers prior to 1.8 Ma. 
205 
 Acheulian tool manufacture, in addition, requires the integration of higher-order motor 
206 
planning, working memory, and auditory feedback mechanisms to attend to information from 
207 
multiple modalities as the toolmaker coordinates the different goals required by this more complex 
208 
  
10 
task. We propose that, like the processing of an auditory speech stream, Acheulian knapping 
209 
requires the knapper to discriminate between knapping sounds and to assign meaning to those 
210 
sounds based on how they relate to the hierarchy of goals involved in making a handaxe (e.g., how 
211 
does this strike and its associated sound get me closer to setting up an ideal platform to remove a 
212 
flake that will be long and thin enough to remove this nearby convexity; how does this strike and 
213 
its associated sound relate to the overall shape of the handaxe that I am trying to achieve). Thus, 
214 
the knapping of Acheulian tools may have played a role in fine-tuning this function in the STG, 
215 
perhaps facilitating the evolution of neural connections involved in speech perception. 
216 
Interestingly, the Acheulian technocomplex coincides in timing with the evolution of a derived 
217 
middle ear anatomy in Homo that was more attuned to human speech frequencies40,41. Together, 
218 
fossil and neuroarchaeological evidence now reveal that a major shift in hominin auditory 
219 
processing occurred after Homo diverged from Australopithecus and Paranthropus and before the 
220 
appearance of H. heidelbergensis.  
221 
The adoption of the Acheulian toolkit by early Homo also coincides in time with a more 
222 
unpredictable environment, an increase in brain and body size, and a more diverse diet that relied 
223 
upon tool-assisted hunting and foraging of large game animals and tough, fibrous plant products42. 
224 
As reliable food items became scarcer in this unpredictable environment, those individuals who 
225 
were capable of holding in mind multiple modes of information to guide and coordinate their motor 
226 
behaviours likely experienced higher reproductive success because of their enhanced ability to 
227 
produce complex tools. We speculate that this ability allowed these individuals and their offspring 
228 
greater access to a diverse set of food resources. 
229 
Our findings do not neatly overlap with prior claims of a technological origin for language. 
230 
There is more support for a working memory hypothesis, as VWM plays an active role in the 
231 
  
11 
network identified here that today allows modern humans to perform such behaviours as skilfully 
232 
playing a musical instrument. Our data suggest that this cognitive network was probably necessary 
233 
for early Homo to make Acheulian handaxes and might also have been important for other learned, 
234 
complex behaviours. Additionally, a larger working memory capacity may have led to more 
235 
complex imitative abilities, as Arbib has suggested43. We propose that selection for this integrated, 
236 
multimodal network around 1.8 Ma in response to an unpredictable environment marked a turning 
237 
point in the evolution of the hominin brain, leading to the expansion of prefrontal and temporal 
238 
cortices3, a more complex cognitive toolkit, and the evolution of a new species of Homo.  
239 
 
240 
Methods 
241 
Experimental Design, Participants, and Procedure 
242 
An a priori power analysis was performed for sample size determination based on data 
243 
from a pilot study, comparing verbal with nonverbal instruction. Beta values from fifteen 20-s 
244 
intervals of knapping were extracted from a channel that overlies anterior Broca’s area. The 
245 
effect size (Cohen’s d = 1.13) was considered to be large using Cohen’s criteria44. With an alpha 
246 
= 0.05 and power = 0.80, the projected sample size needed with this effect size is approximately 
247 
14 subjects per group45.  
248 
Participants were recruited for the study via posted flyers that advertised for individuals 
249 
interested in learning to make stone tools. Any persons interested in participating in the study 
250 
received an online questionnaire that determined their eligibility to participate. They were 
251 
screened for knapping experience, handedness, neurological, psychiatric, and physical handicaps, 
252 
and drug use. Only individuals with no prior experience making stone tools were asked to 
253 
participate. Because of evidence for abnormal language lateralization in left-handed and 
254 
  
12 
ambidextrous individuals46, the Benton Neuropsychology Clinic Handedness test was 
255 
administered during the screening process to determine the laterality quotient of potential 
256 
subjects47. Only subjects who fell within the range of +75 - +100 points, or extreme right-
257 
handedness, were included in the experiment.  
258 
After positively demonstrating right-hand dominance and consenting to participate, 
259 
subjects were asked about their psychiatric and neurologic history. Persons who had experienced 
260 
traumatic brain injury (including stroke, anoxia and hypoxia, brain tumour, infections of the 
261 
brain, etc.), loss of consciousness, a history of seizures, or severe learning disability were not 
262 
included. Individuals with serious psychiatric disorders, such as autism, were excluded from the 
263 
study. Additionally, the Drug Abuse Screen Test (DAST-10) was included to quantify the degree 
264 
of drug abuse problems of potential subjects48. Individuals with a recent history of drug abuse 
265 
show impairments in cognitive tasks49. Only persons who received a score of 2 or lower were 
266 
permitted to participate. The study was approved by the IRB and Human Subjects Office at the 
267 
University of Iowa (IRB ID #: 201304789), and all subjects signed an informed consent 
268 
document prior to participating. 
269 
Participants were divided into two groups based on their performance during a manual 
270 
dexterity test so that dexterity levels were equally distributed across groups. One group received 
271 
verbal instruction while learning how to knap stone (N = 15; 8 females, 7 males), and the other 
272 
group received nonverbal instruction only (N = 16; 8 females, 8 males). Manual dexterity was 
273 
measured using the Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test (MMDT). This test assesses the manual 
274 
dexterity required to place sixty round pegs with the dominant hand in specific places on a 
275 
board50. While it is often used by physical and occupational therapists to determine baseline 
276 
progress data from an injured patient, the MMDT has also proven to be a reliable and valid 
277 
  
13 
method for obtaining measures of manual dexterity in healthy adults50,51. For the final sample of 
278 
included participants, the nonverbal group averaged 182.4 ± 17.5 s to place all sixty pegs in the 
279 
holes on the board in three iterations, while the verbal group averaged 182.7 ± 16.9 s. There was 
280 
no significant difference in dexterity between the two groups based on this assignment (t = 0.06, 
281 
p = 0.95). Males, who averaged 181.4 ± 14.2 s, and females, who averaged 183.6 ± 19.5 s, also 
282 
did not significantly differ from each other in their dexterity scores (t = -0.34, p = 0.74). 
283 
After screening and group assignment, participants attended their first practice session. 
284 
One participant dropped out of the study halfway through this first session. Four additional 
285 
participants were withdrawn after their first neuroimaging session because they had dark or thick 
286 
hair that interfered with our ability to obtain high-quality NIRS signals. Finally, two subjects 
287 
withdrew from the study before the final neuroimaging session for personal reasons. The final 
288 
sample had 31 participants (nonverbal = 16, verbal = 15; 16 females, 15 males; age 24.0 ± 8.1 
289 
years [mean ± SD]) who completed the entirety of the experiment.  
290 
The participants individually attended seven 60-min knapping practice sessions, during 
291 
which they learned how to knap stone tools by watching instructional videos. We chose video 
292 
instruction rather than in-person instruction to ensure that every subject received the exact same 
293 
instructions at the same rate and also to control for interactive teaching, as there is currently not 
294 
enough evidence to confirm that early Homo was capable of interactive teaching. The videos 
295 
featured an expert knapper with over 12 years of experience. His face was not visible in the 
296 
frame, though his hands, lap, and torso were visible. This prevented the nonverbal group from 
297 
picking up on any verbal cues that were communicated by the face. Both groups watched the 
298 
same instruction videos; however, the nonverbal group watched a silent version. Each practice 
299 
session proceeded in the following order: 1) a 10-min instruction video; 2) 20 min of practice; 3) 
300 
  
14 
the same 10-min instruction video; and 4) 20 min more to practice. Subjects were not able to 
301 
manipulate the video in any way, for example, by pausing it. All the debitage created while 
302 
knapping fell on a large tarpaulin mat. After the participants completed a core or core tool and 
303 
were ready to move on to another rock, the core/core tool and its corresponding debitage were 
304 
collected, bagged, and labelled with the rock number and other pertinent information for further 
305 
analysis. 
306 
Each practice session introduced a new goal for them to meet, or reviewed and refined 
307 
skills already introduced. The skills and tool types learned during practice sessions 1 and 2 were 
308 
comparable to the skills and tool types of Oldowan simple tool production. This is a quick and 
309 
expedient method of obtaining a sharp flake to use as a tool52. They learned how to recognize 
310 
ideal striking angles on the raw material and tried to create flakes. They continued to practice 
311 
making expedient flakes during the second practice session. The second video taught them how 
312 
to recognize the best raw material for flaking. Subjects learned which materials fracture easily by 
313 
trial and error. This also was communicated verbally to the verbal group. Practice sessions 3-7 
314 
introduced and reviewed skills involved in the production of the early Acheulian technocomplex, 
315 
which involves a more efficient removal of flakes and the intentional shaping of a large cutting 
316 
tool53. The third practice session video featured alternate flaking around a square edge as the 
317 
main goal for this session, which is an important skill for making bifaces. The instruction video 
318 
for the fourth practice session introduced core bifaces, and the instructor in the video 
319 
demonstrated biface manufacture at a very slow rate. In the fifth practice session, the video 
320 
began to focus more on primary thinning of a piece to remove large convexities. The sixth 
321 
instruction video presented information on how to shape and refine a biface by trimming. 
322 
Finally, the subjects were presented with an instruction video during the seventh practice session 
323 
  
15 
that focused on the entire process of bifacial reduction so that they could continue to practice the 
324 
skills they learned from prior sessions. 
325 
For all practice and neuroimaging sessions, subjects were required to wear safety 
326 
goggles, leather work gloves, and lap pads. They were also given the choice to wear a facemask 
327 
to block out small particles of airborne silicates. 
328 
In addition to the training sessions, participants attended three 90-min neuroimaging 
329 
sessions after the first, fourth, and seventh training sessions, during which they were video 
330 
recorded and brain activity was observed using the TechEn CW6 system. They sat in a small 
331 
room surrounded by black curtains. The experiment program was designed with EPrime 
332 
software. The presentation of stimuli was synchronized with the CW6 system. Set-up involved 
333 
measuring the participant’s head to ensure the proper cap size, and measuring 10-20 landmarks 
334 
to ensure proper cap placement on the head. Hair was cleared at each optode site. The 10-20 
335 
landmarks and positions of the sources and detectors on the head were then digitized. 
336 
Each imaging session consisted of 1) a motor baseline task made up of 9 40-s blocks of 
337 
activity segregated by 20-s rest periods to observe activation of motor-related brain areas while 
338 
striking rocks together without the added element of actual knapping; 2) an Oldowan toolmaking 
339 
task that was segregated into five 1-min blocks of activity with 15-s resting periods in between 
340 
each block; and 3) an Acheulian toolmaking task segregated into fifteen 1-min blocks, separated 
341 
by 15-s rest periods. The order of the tasks was not randomized during each imaging session nor 
342 
was the length of resting periods; thus, there is some possibility that habituation effects impacted 
343 
our results. These limitations should be addressed in future studies. 
344 
To eliminate the possibility of linguistic contamination, the experiment was designed so 
345 
that all instructions were given via silent video with timing of events indicated by different tones, 
346 
  
16 
and subjects were instructed to not talk during the experiment. Subjects were told at the 
347 
beginning of the experiment to perform the same activity that they viewed in the instruction 
348 
videos, which preceded each new task or event. Instructions also included training on the 
349 
meanings of different tones they would hear throughout the session that would signal whether to 
350 
stop or start an action. Only data from the final neuroimaging session are included here because 
351 
this was the first point when more than 90% of the surveyed participants were able to identify the 
352 
different goals of the Oldowan and Acheulian tasks. 
353 
At each practice and neuroimaging session, subjects were presented with three or four 
354 
local, granitic rocks of varying sizes that were naturally rounded for use as hammer stones. A 
355 
goal of the training was to introduce the subjects to different qualities, shapes, and types of rock 
356 
to fracture so that they would learn to select the blank of highest quality and the most workable 
357 
edges from the three choices that they were always provided. Thus, a variety of unheated cherts 
358 
from the Midwestern United States, Texas, and California were obtained from collectors in 
359 
Missouri and Texas, though most of the material was Burlington chert, a fine- to medium-
360 
grained stone that is easy to flake54. Prior to being made available for the subjects to knap, each 
361 
stone was assigned a unique, identifying label, weighed on a digital scale, and assigned a 
362 
measurement of volume by the water displacement method. Spalls and cobbles ranged between 
363 
69.6 and 3000.0 g in mass (mean = 676.8 g) and had a volume between 20 and 1200 cm3 (mean 
364 
= 284.3 cm3). Generally, smaller pre-made spalls of chert with edges of very acute angles were 
365 
provided in the first two practice sessions. By the third and fourth practice sessions, the 
366 
participants could choose from medium-sized spalls without cortex that had edges with more 
367 
difficult angles, as well as rounded cobbles with cortex but with one or more flakes already 
368 
removed to help them get started. A mix of small- to medium-sized spalls and cobbles were 
369 
  
17 
available to choose from for the Oldowan task during the neuroimaging sessions. Larger, more 
370 
challenging pieces, many with square edges, were provided for the fifth, sixth, and seventh 
371 
practice sessions and the Acheulian task during the neuroimaging sessions.  
372 
 
373 
Behavioural Data Acquisition and Processing 
374 
A key issue when comparing different groups in neuroimaging studies that measure 
375 
changes over learning is that participants might learn at different rates depending upon their 
376 
group assignment. To examine this possibility, digital callipers were used to take measurements 
377 
on cores and flake debris from both knapping tasks during the final neuroimaging session to 
378 
determine whether one of the learning groups produced stone tools with greater skill than the 
379 
other group (see Supplementary Discussion). All core and debitage pieces were collected after 
380 
the completion of each finished core during the neuroimaging session. Any debitage that passed 
381 
through a ¼” screen was discarded. The remaining pieces were labelled and measured. Each 
382 
piece was weighed to the nearest tenth of a gram and allocated to a metric size category 
383 
continuum as defined by the smallest of a series of nested squares on centimetre graph paper into 
384 
which the piece would completely fit (i.e., 1 cm2, 2 cm2, 3 cm2.., etc.). The maximum thickness 
385 
was recorded for each piece. All non-core debitage was coded as a flake (either complete, 
386 
proximal, or distal) or nonflake debitage shatter55. Any flakes with an intact striking platform 
387 
underwent measurements for the maximum platform width and thickness.  
388 
These measurements were applied to a total of 5,757 debitage pieces that correspond to 
389 
72 cores, which were reduced by 30 of the participants in the study*. Relative knapping skill as 
390 
determined by the debitage was measured using the following variables. The first set of variables 
391 
                                               
 
* Debitage output from the final neuroimaging session for one participant was not available for analysis. 
  
18 
measured correspond to flake and platform shape. Platform shape, determined by the ratio of 
392 
maximum platform width to platform thickness, is a common method used to measure knapping 
393 
skill18,28,56, as platform shape contributes to the size and shape of the overall flake. The ratio of 
394 
flake size to flake mass was also included to determine flake shape differences between the 
395 
groups18,56. A larger ratio in both cases signifies a flake that is both relatively thin and elongated, 
396 
which demonstrates the knapper’s ability to remove desired flake tools in the case of the 
397 
Oldowan task and long, thinning flakes for shaping the core tool in the case of the Acheulian 
398 
task. We calculated the relative platform area ([platform width*platform thickness]/flake size) 
399 
with the expectation that knappers of a higher skill level would produce smaller, thinner 
400 
platforms relative to the size of the rest of the flake28.  
401 
The second set of variables measured correspond to the efficient use of raw material, as 
402 
inefficient use of raw material is indicative of low skill level57. We examined the proportion of 
403 
intended flakes to unintended shatter fragments, both on low quality and high quality 
404 
material18,56, with the expectation that the assemblages of relatively more skilled knappers would 
405 
include a higher percentage of flakes than the assemblages of less skilled knappers, 
406 
demonstrating better control of the material. We also examined the proportion of whole flakes to 
407 
flake fragments. Previous experimental research demonstrated that the assemblages of skilled 
408 
knappers included more flake fragments than the assemblages of less skilled knappers, perhaps a 
409 
result of skilled knappers striking the core at a higher velocity56. A clear sign of knapping skill in 
410 
the case of the Oldowan task is the level of reduction of the cobble into usable flakes56. We 
411 
measured this by determining the proportion of the original cobble’s mass into flake, shatter, and 
412 
unexploited core mass, with the expectation that the more skilled knappers would have a larger 
413 
percentage of flake mass and a smaller percentage of unexploited core mass. Finally, we 
414 
  
19 
examined the relative number of missed strikes on cores and debitage (total number of missed 
415 
strikes/original cobble mass), which can be observed as incipient cones of percussion, micro-
416 
flake scars or battered edges, and hammer stone marks18. While it is impossible to get an exact 
417 
count of missed strikes by looking at the lithics alone, if one group were to have a higher number 
418 
of missed strikes than the other, this would be indicative of less skill, signifying less manual 
419 
control.  
420 
Forty-nine core tools (attempted bifaces) from the Acheulian task were analysed. Along 
421 
with the measures described above, core tools were determined to be bifaces by the presence of 
422 
two opposing faces and at least one bifacial edge. A bifacial edge is defined as any sharp edge 
423 
that has been created by removing flakes near the same location that run across opposite planes 
424 
of the stone. This would require the knapper to strike off one flake and then flip the piece over 
425 
and use the newly created angle to remove a second flake, a technique known as alternate 
426 
flaking. The proportion of successful bifaces was determined by dividing each group’s total 
427 
number of successful bifaces by the group’s total number of attempted bifaces. The maximum 
428 
breadth and thickness of each successful biface were recorded with digital callipers. The ratio of 
429 
biface breadth to thickness is informative about the level of biface refinement, such that a refined 
430 
handaxe should have a larger breadth relative to thickness, which would present as a larger 
431 
ratio28.  
432 
At the conclusion of the experiment, participants were asked questions related to their 
433 
experience in the experiment, and their answers were recorded. Specifically, they were asked 
434 
what they thought the goals were for the knapping tasks and whether or not they believed they 
435 
achieved these goals. They were asked to explain how the two knapping tasks differed from each 
436 
other, at what point in the experiment they understood there were differences between the two 
437 
  
20 
knapping tasks, and whether or not they used different strategies to achieve the different goals of 
438 
the two tasks. They explained what they were generally thinking about while knapping, whether 
439 
or not these thoughts included language. Finally, they were asked for their opinion on whether 
440 
language would be beneficial for learning to knap. Some of their answers have been summarized 
441 
in Supplementary Fig. 2. 
442 
 
443 
Designing the fNIRS Cap to Record from Target Regions of Interest (ROIs) 
444 
 
Prior to the study, we identified a set of ROIs reported in three stone knapping studies 
445 
that involve either PET or fMRI1,14,15. To further investigate the supposed involvement of the 
446 
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) during the transition to bifacial flaking, we also included 
447 
coordinates from Table 2 in Badre and Wagner58, which averages the coordinates for the vlPFC 
448 
reported in six other studies. Similarly, to test for the involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal 
449 
cortex (dlPFC) during Early Stone Age tool manufacture, coordinates for dlPFC activation were 
450 
compiled from Pessoa and colleagues59,60. 
451 
 
Next, we used methods described in Wijeakumar et al.19 to design a custom optode 
452 
geometry to record from these ROIs. This involved digitizing candidate source and detector 
453 
locations on an EasyCAP (Brain Products GmBH, Germany) using a Polhemus Patriot™ Motion 
454 
Tracking System (Colchester, VT) and projecting these positions onto an adult atlas available in 
455 
AtlasViewer GUI in the HOMER2 software package 
456 
(www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/PMI/resources/Homer2)61. Final adjustments to the optode 
457 
geometry were made after performing Monte Carlo simulations to create a sensitivity distribution 
458 
for each source-detector pair (i.e., the sensitivity of each source-detector pair to detecting 
459 
changes in absorption of NIR light) and visually inspecting whether these sensitivity volumes 
460 
  
21 
overlapped with the target ROIs. The end result was an optode geometry that recorded from all 
461 
ROIs, including regions along the central sulcus, lateral prefrontal, superior temporal, and 
462 
inferior parietal cortex.  
463 
 
464 
Image Acquisition and Processing 
465 
fNIRS data were acquired at 25 Hz with a TechEn CW6 system with wavelengths of 690 
466 
nm and 830 nm. Light was delivered to a customized cap via fibre optic cables. The probe 
467 
geometry had 12 sources and 24 detectors, creating 36 channels with a source-detector separation 
468 
of 3 cm and two short source-detector channels with a separation of 1 cm (see Fig. 1c for optode 
469 
coverage). HOMER2 software was employed to demean and convert the data into optical density 
470 
(OD) units. A targeted principal component analysis (tPCA) was applied to data from the three 
471 
tasks mentioned above to eliminate noise and motion artifacts62. We used a general linear model 
472 
(GLM) to obtain beta values (β) for oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb measures in every channel for all 
473 
conditions in every task for each subject. Signals from the short source-detector channels were 
474 
regressed from the rest of the channels to account for effects from superficial layers of the head.  
475 
The image reconstruction process is summarized briefly here (see Wijeakumar et al. for a 
476 
more extensive explanation of this process19,20). Head 10-20 landmarks from the session that had 
477 
the best symmetry were chosen as the reference for each subject. The landmarks from the other 
478 
two sessions were transformed (linear) to fit this reference set of landmarks. The transformation 
479 
matrices were applied to the corresponding source and detector positions. AtlasViewerGUI 
480 
(available within HOMER2) was used to project the points onto an adult atlas using a relaxation 
481 
algorithm. The projected geometry was used to run Monte Carlo simulations based upon a GPU-
482 
dependent Monte Carlo algorithm63 for each session and subject. This resulted in sensitivity 
483 
  
22 
profiles (100 million photons) for each channel of the probe geometry for each session and 
484 
subject. Head volumes and sensitivity profiles of channels were converted to NIFTII images. 
485 
Subject-specific head volumes were skull-stripped and transformed to the head volume in the 
486 
native atlas space using an affine transform (BRAINSFit in Slicer 3D). The transformation 
487 
matrix obtained was applied to the sensitivity profiles to move them to the transformed head 
488 
volume space (BRAINSResample in Slicer3D). Sensitivity profiles for all channels were 
489 
thresholded to include voxels with an OD of greater than 0.000119. These profiles were summed 
490 
to create a session and subject-specific mask, and then these masks were summed across all 
491 
sessions and subjects. Those shared voxels were used to create an intersection mask across 
492 
participants.  
493 
The beta coefficients obtained for each channel, condition (within each task), and subject 
494 
for oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb were combined with the forward model results obtained from the 
495 
Monte Carlo simulations to create voxel-based changes in oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb concentration 
496 
using image-reconstruction methods described by Wijeakumar et al20. Briefly, the image 
497 
reconstruction problem can be formulated as the following generic equation:  
498 
 
499 
𝑌 = 𝐿   . 𝑋

Δ𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑥𝑦 − 𝐻𝑏>/0  
505 
 
506 
Inverting L to solve for X results in an ill-conditioned and under-determined solution that 
507 
might be subject to rounding errors. An alternative is to use Tikhonov regularization64. In this 
508 
case, the above ‘system’ can be replaced by a regularized ‘system’. The solution is given by the 
509 
Gauss-Markov equation, 
510 
 
511 
                                                                                                                              𝑋 = (𝐿B   𝐿 +    𝜆.

512 
 
513 
where λ is a regularization parameter that determines the amount of regularization and I is the 
514 
identity operator. 
515 
The solution to (2) can be found by minimizing the cost function65, 
516 
 
517 
                                                                                             𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 min 𝑋 = 𝐿. 𝑋 − 𝑌 - +   𝜆   . |𝑋 −   𝑋/|-                                                                        (3) 
518 
 
519 
where the size of the regularized solution is measured by the norm λ . |X – X0|2. X0 is an a priori 
520 
estimate of X, which is set to zero when no priori information is available. Here X is determined 
521 
for each chromophore and condition separately. Once Equation (3) is solved, there is now a 
522 
voxel-wise estimate of the concentration data. Thus, the best estimate of the channel-wise 
523 
concentration data for each condition (from the GLM) has been combined with information from 
524 
the photon migration results to create an estimate of the voxel-wise concentration data for each 
525 
chromophore, for each condition, and for each subject.  
 
526 
  
24 
 
The resultant beta maps were intersected with the Intersection mask to restrict analyses to 
527 
the voxels that were common to all sessions and subjects. Consequently, beta maps were 
528 
obtained for each condition (within each task) and subject for oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb 
529 
concentration levels. 
530 
 
531 
Statistical Analysis 
532 
The hemodynamic responses of the verbal and nonverbal groups and the Oldowan and 
533 
Acheulian tasks were compared using two-way ANOVA tests for both the oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb 
534 
signals, conducted with the 3dMVM function in AFNI (Analysis of Functional Images)66. 
535 
Resultant functional images of main effects and interactions were corrected for family-wise 
536 
errors using the 3dClustSim function (corrected at alpha = 0.05, corresponding to a cluster size 
537 
threshold of > 27 voxels). We analysed the highest-order effect in each spatially unique cluster; 
538 
thus, main effect areas that overlapped with areas where an interaction occurred between Group 
539 
and Task were interpreted based on the interaction effect.  
540 
Using the coordinates for the centre of mass of activation for each effect, we extracted the 
541 
β values in these areas for the Oldowan and Acheulian tasks and the verbal and nonverbal 
542 
groups. In cases of a significant interaction, the averaged β values of Task and Group were 
543 
compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann-Whitney test, respectively. We also 
544 
compared β values from the knapping conditions to the motor baseline conditions using the 
545 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test to identify significant clusters that were unique to stone knapping and 
546 
not simply general motor regions. Only those significant clusters where post-hoc tests 
547 
determined knapping activation to be significantly higher than motor baseline activation were 
548 
included in the final results discussed in the main text. Because the motor baseline task did not 
549 
  
25 
control for auditory stimulation while clicking rocks together, temporal cortex clusters were 
550 
included in the final results, even if the signal in these regions was not significantly higher than 
551 
the motor baseline signal.  
552 
To test for differences in knapping skill between the verbal and nonverbal groups, 
553 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney U, and Student’s two-sided T-tests were employed for 
554 
each variable related to the debitage and bifaces, with results considered significant at p < 0.05.

Supplementary Discussion 
Behavioural Results 
Every participant was successful at removing flakes from a cobble by the final 
neuroimaging session. The statistical analysis of the debitage-related variables did not reveal a 
clear pattern of higher skill among one group over the other (Supplementary Table 1). Both groups 
produced a similar proportion of flakes to shatter on both low quality and high quality material, 
though the verbal group made significantly more whole flakes relative to flake fragments. The 
verbal group, on average, produced more flake mass than the nonverbal group, though this 
difference was not significant. Otherwise, both groups reduced a similar amount of shatter mass 
from the original cobble during the Oldowan task, leaving a similar amount of material unexploited 
on the core. The verbal group had fewer missed strikes than the nonverbal group, which could 
signify increased skill, but this difference was not significant. Some significant differences 
between the groups occurred among the measures of flake shape. The flakes produced by the 
nonverbal group had a shape that was significantly thinner and longer than those produced by the 
verbal group, which replicates the results of a previous study that looked at differences in knapping 
skill between verbally- and nonverbally-instructed novices in an interactive teaching 
environment18. The flakes made by the nonverbal group also had significantly smaller platforms 
relative to flake size than the verbal group, though platform shape on its own did not significantly 
differ between groups.  
There is no evidence from the statistical analysis of the core tools that one group excelled 
over the other (Supplementary Table 1). Both groups had an almost identical proportion of 
successful bifaces (verbal = 0.652, nonverbal = 0.650). The verbal group’s bifaces had a larger 
average breadth to thickness ratio than the nonverbal group, but this difference was not significant. 
These results imply that the two groups reached similar levels of skill, and any differences in 
localized neural activation reflect the type of tool constructed (Oldowan, Acheulian) and the 
training context (verbal, nonverbal).

Preliminary Meta-Analysis 
Previous neuroarchaeological research suggests that stone knapping behaviours do not 
require working memory involvement but do overlap with language-processing areas1,14,15,17. This 
interpretation was based mainly on the lack of activation in the dlPFC, which is considered to be 
an important component of the working memory system. This claim may have been premature, 
however, as working memory is a distributed neural system with multiple integrated, cortical 
regions. Indeed, a recent ALE meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies focused on stone knapping 
reveals that working memory plays an essential role in stone knapping, especially during 
Acheulian tool replication67. By plotting the coordinates of eight significant clusters from a recent 
neuroarchaeological study1 in the same space as the coordinates from a visual working memory 
(VWM) meta-analysis19 and a language-processing meta-analysis that includes phonological, 
lexico-semantic, and sentence processing neuroimaging studies34, we also found that stone 
knapping functional activation not only overlaps with language centres but also overlaps with the 
VWM network, a fact that has been overlooked in previous studies (Supplementary Fig. 1). 
 
Neuroimaging Results 
fNIRS is unique in that it simultaneously measures the changes in concentration of both 
oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb. Here we present the results for both chromophores. Supplementary Table 
2 shows the list of all significant ANOVA results related to the oxy-Hb signal. The results 
reported in the main text (highlighted in grey in Supplementary Table 2) reflect active clusters 
with the highest-order effect (an Interaction effect in the case of overlap between a Main Effect 
and an Interaction; a Main Effect otherwise) that were also significantly higher than the motor 
baseline task. Effects that were not significantly greater than motor baseline but lie within the 
temporal cortex were also included because we did not control for sound production in the motor 
  
4 
baseline task. In total, we focused on six clusters that showed a significant effect of Task and 
four clusters where Oldowan and Acheulian toolmaking were modulated by the linguistic context 
of training. Note that all of the Group main effects were subsumed by an overlapping Task x 
Group interaction. 
Supplementary Table 3 shows the list of all significant ANOVA results related to 
concentrations of deoxy-Hb. The ANOVA revealed multiple clusters showing a significant main 
effect of Group and Task, as well as significant Group x Task interactions. Ten of these 
significant clusters overlapped spatially with significant oxy-Hb clusters. In nine of these 
clusters, there was an inverse relationship between deoxy-Hb and oxy-Hb (highlighted in grey in 
Supplementary Table 3). Oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb signals tend to be negatively correlated with 
each other68. Critically, six of these nine clusters overlapped with the oxy-Hb results reported in 
the main text, including the right temporal pole, left STG, right PoG, left MFG, and two areas in 
the left PrG (Supplementary Fig. 3). These deoxy-Hb results lend further support to the 
conclusions reached in the main text.

Supplementary Figures 
 
Supplementary Figure 1. Areas of functional overlap between a prior study of Early Stone Age 
knapping1 (red), language-processing34 (light green), and/or VWM19 (purple), including (a) right 
IFG (pars triangularis), (b) bilateral ventral PrG, (c) left inferior parietal lobule, and (d) bilateral 
dorsal PrG. Overlap between spheres is represented by turquois, mauve, and yellow colours. This 
figure demonstrates that stone knapping overlaps with the VWM network to an even greater 
extent than it overlaps with language centres.

Supplementary Figure 2. Post-experiment interview subject responses by group (nonverbal = 
red; n = 14, verbal = blue; n = 14) to the question, “Did you think with language while 
knapping?” Subjects’ responses were coded as one of three categories. A completely negative 
response to the question was coded as ‘Spatial Thinking.’ Responses that indicated minimal 
involvement of inner speech while thinking about the task were coded as ‘Spatial Thinking with 
Some Words,’ and participants who emphasized inner speech as their main mode of thinking or 
mentioned recalling entire phrases from the instruction videos were coded as ‘Inner Speech.’ 
Error bars represent standard error.
