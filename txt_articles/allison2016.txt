ABSTRACT
ALLISON, M. K., J. H. BAGLOLE, B. J. MARTIN, M. J. MACINNIS, B. J. GURD, and M. J. GIBALA. Brief Intense Stair Climbing
Improves Cardiorespiratory Fitness. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 49, No. 2, pp. 298–307, 2017. Purpose: Sprint interval training (SIT)
is a time-efficient strategy to improve cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF); however, most protocols have been studied in laboratory settings
and require specialized equipment. We investigated the efficacy of brief intense stair climbing as a practical model of SIT to improve
CRF. Methods: Two separate studies, each consisting of an acute and chronic phase, were conducted in a total of 31 sedentary
women (age = 24 T 10 yr, body mass index = 23 T 4 kgImj2). Results: The acute phase of study 1 established that the mean HR,
blood [lactate], and RPE were similar when participants (n = 8) performed an SIT protocol that involved 3 � 20-s ‘‘all-out’’ efforts of
either continuously ascending stairs or cycling. The chronic phase demonstrated that CRF, as determined by peak oxygen uptake
(V
˙ O2peak), increased by 12% or ~1 MET (8.27 T 1.05 to 9.25 T 1.01 METs, P = 0.002) when participants (n = 12) performed the 3 �
20-s stair climbing protocol 3 dIwkj1 for 6 wk. The acute phase of study 2 established that HR and RPE were similar when
participants (n = 11) performed three different stair climbing protocols: the 3 � 20-s continuous ascent model used in study 1 and two
3 � 60-s models of ascending and descending either one or two flights of stairs (P 9 0.05). The chronic phase demonstrated that
V
˙ O2peak increased by 7% (8.91 T 1.30 to 9.51 T 1.52 METs, P = 0.01) when the same group of participants performed the one-flight
3 � 60-s protocol 3 dIwkj1 for 6 wk. The Cederholm index determined from an oral glucose tolerance test was 57 T 17 and 64 T
21 mgILj2Immolj1ImUj1Iminj1 before and after training, respectively (P = 0.056). Conclusion: Brief, intense stair climbing is a
practical, time-efficient strategy to improve CRF in previously untrained women. Key Words: SPRINT INTERVAL TRAINING,

L
ow cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is a strong pre-
dictor of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mor-
tality (21). Unfit individuals have twice the risk of
death from all causes as their fit counterparts, regardless of
body mass index (BMI) or body composition (2,22). Epide-
miological evidence has also established that a 1 MET higher
CRF is associated with 15% and 13% reductions in risk of
cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, respectively (21).
Public health guidelines generally prescribe 150 min of weekly
moderate-intensity physical activity to achieve health benefits
(12). Although this prescription is evidence based (12), it may
be insufficient to enhance CRF in a substantial portion of the
population (33). Some agencies advocate 75 min of vigorous
activity as an alternative to 150 min of moderate activity (12).
This recommendation is based mainly on the similar energy
expenditure for the two prescriptions, as opposed to a specific
effect of exercise intensity per se (12). Nonetheless, it has
been established that high-intensity exercise confers larger
improvements in CRF than moderate-intensity exercise when
matched for total work (6,17).
Sprint interval training (SIT), which involves brief inter-
mittent bursts of very intense exercise separated by recovery
periods, is also efficacious for improving CRF (16,34,39,40).
As little as two or three 20-s ‘‘all-out’’ sprints, within a 10-min
time commitment, can improve CRF by ~1 MET when per-
formed three times per week for 6 wk (14,15,28,29). One
study has also recently shown that 12 wk of training in this

 manner improved CRF and insulin sensitivity to the same
extent as a moderate-intensity continuous exercise protocol
that involved a fivefold greater exercise volume and time
commitment (14). Collectively, these studies (14,15,28,29)
are noteworthy given that accelerometer data suggest e15%
of North American adults meet current physical activity
guidelines (9,36), with perceived ‘‘lack of time’’ commonly
cited as a barrier that negatively correlates with physical
activity participation (35).
Access to physical activity facilities is another strong
correlate of physical activity participation (35). The majority
of research demonstrating the efficacy of SIT has been
conducted in a laboratory setting using specialized equip-
ment, such as cycle ergometers, which are inaccessible to many
individuals. By contrast, stair climbing is a readily accessible
form of exercise that offers the potential for SIT to be per-
formed outside the laboratory. Although it has been established
that vigorous stair climbing for 30–160 minIwkj1 for 8–12 wk
can improve CRF (3,4,20,24), whether smaller doses of stair
climbing performed according to an SIT protocol improves
CRF remains unknown.
The present work explored the potential for brief, intense
stair climbing to improve CRF and other indices of car-
diometabolic health. Two separate but related studies were
conducted, each involving an acute and chronic phase. The
acute phases assessed physiological and perceptual re-
sponses to various SIT protocols using randomized cross-
over designs. The chronic phases examined the effect of
two distinct 6-wk training interventions: the first study
involved repeated 20-s bouts of continuously ascending
stairs, and the second study involved repeated 60-s bouts
of ascending and descending stairs. We tested two main hy-
potheses: 1) an acute bout of stair climbing would elicit phys-
iological and perceptual responses similar to a modified
Wingate-based cycling protocol, and 2) 6 wk of stair climbing
would improve CRF, similar to what has been demonstrated
for cycling-based SIT.
METHODS
Subjects
Three separate groups of sedentary but otherwise healthy
women were recruited (total n = 31). The acute and chronic
phases of study 1 were completed at different institutions with
separate groups of women, whereas a third group partici-
pated in the acute and chronic phases of study 2 (Table 1).
Participants were considered sedentary but healthy based
on a self-report of e1 h of structured physical activity per
week using the International Physical Activity Question-
naire and the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire
(PAR-Q). Physical activity levels were confirmed for the
chronic phases by a peak oxygen uptake (V
˙ O2peak) G70th
percentile (1). The experimental procedures and associated
risks were explained to all subjects before their participation,
and all subjects provided written informed consent. The acute
phase of study 1 was conducted at Queen"s University and ap-
proved by Queen"s University Health Sciences Research Ethics
Board. The remaining phases were completed at McMaster
University and approved by the Hamilton Integrated Re-
search Ethics Board.
Experimental Design
Overview. Two separate studies were conducted, both of
which involved an acute exercise comparison and a subse-
quent 6-wk training intervention. In study 1 (group 1), we
initially compared the acute physiological and perceptual
responses to an SIT protocol using two different exercise
modes. The protocol involved 3 � 20-s ‘‘all-out’’ efforts of
either cycling or stair climbing, given that the cycling model
was previously shown to enhance CRF when participants
trained 3 dIwkj1 for 6 wk (15). After confirming that the
acute physiological and perceptual responses were similar,
we subsequently recruited a separate group of participants
(group 2) to assess indices of cardiometabolic health before
and after 6 wk of training with the 3 � 20-s stair climbing
protocol. In study 2 (group 3), we initially compared the
acute physiological and perceptual responses to three dif-
ferent stair-climbing protocols: the 3 � 20-s protocol used
in study 1 and two other protocols that involved 3 � 60-s of
vigorously climbing up and down either one flight (3 � 60-s
1F protocol) or two flights (3 � 60-s 2F protocol) of stairs.
The rationale was that the latter two protocols might be easily
adapted to a typical home or dwelling with one or two stories,
whereas the 3 � 20-s protocol necessitated a building with
3–4 stories and an ‘‘all-out’’ pace. Upon determining that the
acute physiological and perceptual responses to the three pro-
tocols were similar, and that participants preferred the 3 �
60-s 1F protocol, we assessed indices of cardiometabolic
health before and after 6 wk of training with the 3 � 60-s 1F
protocol in the same group of participants.
Study 1: acute phase. A randomized crossover design
was implemented to compare acute responses to the stair
climbing and cycling protocols. Each involved a 2-min
warm-up, 3 � 20-s ‘‘all-out’’ efforts interspersed with 2 min
of recovery, and a 3-min cooldown. The two trials were sepa-
rated by Q24 h. The 20-s stair climbing efforts were per-
formed as a continuous ascent in a local stairwell (120 stairs,
stair height = 0.135 m). Participants were instructed to ‘‘Climb
the stairs as quickly and safely as possible, taking one step
at a time.’’ The warm-up included walking on flat ground at
a brisk pace, whereas the recovery periods and cooldown
included walking down the stairs and on flat ground at a

 self-selected pace. The 20-s cycling efforts were performed
on a stationary cycle ergometer (Monark Ergomedic 874E
Vansbro, Sweden) as previously described (15) and con-
stituted a modified Wingate test using a resistance equiva-
lent to 5% of body weight. The warm-up, recovery periods,
and cooldown involved light cycling against no load (15).
HR was monitored continuously throughout each session,
whereas finger prick blood lactate concentration and RPE
were measured before the first and immediately after each
subsequent 20-s bout.
Study 1: chronic phase. Participants reported to the
laboratory on three separate occasions over ~14 d for base-
line testing and familiarization. During the initial visit, par-
ticipants completed a continuous incremental V
˙ O2peak test
after refraining from food and beverages for ~2 h. At least
4 d later, participants reported to the laboratory after a stan-
dardized dinner and 10-h overnight fast for body composi-
tion analysis and to provide a resting blood sample for
assessment of fasting insulin sensitivity. Body composition
was analyzed using air displacement plethysmography (BOD
POD; Life Measurement, Inc., Concord, CA). After 1–2 d,
participants returned for seated resting blood pressure (BP)
measures and to complete the modified Canadian Aerobic
Fitness Test (mCAFT). On the same day, participants prac-
ticed the 3 � 20-s stair climbing protocol and were given the
same instructions as those from the acute phase. Participants
then trained 3 dIwkj1 for 6 wk in a local stairwell (99 stairs;
stair height = 0.195 m). Warm-up was modified to include a
moderately paced climb up and down two flights (i.e., one
story or 18 stairs) at a self-selected pace before the brisk walk
to ensure an adequate warm-up. During each session, HR was
monitored continuously, RPE was recorded before warm-up
and after each 20-s bout, and the number of stairs climbed
and the vertical work output were recorded for each 20-s
bout. All training sessions were supervised. Approximately
72 h after the final training session, body composition and
fasting insulin sensitivity were assessed. A V
˙ O2peak test and
the mCAFT were administered at least 4 and 6 d after the
final training session, respectively. Resting BP was mea-
sured before the mCAFT test. All procedures were identical
with those used during baseline testing.
Study 2: acute phase. The acute phase of study 2 was
completed after baseline testing but before training. The im-
mediate exercise responses of two different modified pro-
tocols were compared with the 3 � 20-s protocol from study 1
using a William"s square (i.e., complete counterbalanced) de-
sign. All participants reported to the laboratory on four sepa-
rate occasions during the course of ~10 d. The first visit
included an exercise familiarization session, during which
participants were introduced to the RPE scale and each of the
three stair-climbing protocols using standardized instructions.
Participants practiced climbing at an ‘‘all-out’’ and vigorous
pace. During each of the following three visits, participants
completed either the 3 � 20-s ‘‘all-out’’ protocol from study 1
or one of the two modified 3 � 60-s vigorous protocols in a
local stairwell (61 stairs; stair height = 0.205 m). The 3 � 60-s
1F and 2F protocols involved ascending and descending one
flight of 10 stairs and two flights with a total of 18 stairs,
respectively. The bouts were extended to 60 s to ensure par-
ticipants spent at least 20 s ascending stairs, aligning with
the 3 � 20-s protocol. Instructions for the 3 � 20-s protocol
were the same as those used in study 1, but for the 3 � 60-s
protocols, participants were instructed to ‘‘Climb up and
down the stairs one step at a time for 1 min, ascending vig-
orously and descending as desired. Vigorous means relatively
intense, but not all-out.’’ The warm-up, recovery, and cool-
down periods were the same as the 3 � 20-s protocol in the
chronic phase of study 1; however, the recovery periods were
shortened to 1 min instead of 2 min. Finger prick samples for
blood lactate determination were obtained before warm-up
after a seated 5-min rest and immediately after the final 20-s
or 60-s bout (no difference in timing between protocols,
P = 0.12). Continuous HR, RPE, stairs climbed, and vertical
work output were measured for each protocol (as reported in
the chronic phase of study 1). Each session was separated by
48–72 h and completed at roughly the same time of day. After
completing the acute phase of study 2, participants were asked
to rank all three protocols in their order of preference, and the
most preferred modified protocol (i.e., 3 � 60-s 1F or 2F) was
used for the chronic phase.
Study 2: chronic phase. Because of the nature of re-
cruitment and study design, participants completed two sepa-
rate pretraining V
˙ O2peak tests to account for possible learning
effects and enhance validity. The first V
˙ O2peak test was com-
pleted as a screening measure 6–8 wk before the baseline
measures, during which the second V
˙ O2peak test was com-
pleted to account for possible changes between the screening
and the baseline measures. All baseline measures were com-
pleted within ~1 wk before the acute phase to avoid possible
exercise or training effects as the chronic phase began im-
mediately after the acute phase. After a standardized dinner
and a 10-h overnight fast, participants reported to the labo-
ratory for body composition analysis (as reported in study 1)
and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Participants returned
1–2 d later after another overnight fast for seated resting BP
measures, along with the second V
˙ O2peak test. Participants
trained 3 dIwkj1 for 6 wk using the 3 � 60-s 1F protocol in
the same stairwell as the acute phase, with continuous HR,
RPE, number of stairs climbed, and vertical work output
recorded for each session (as reported in the chronic phase
of study 1). Approximately 72 h after the last training session,
participants returned to the laboratory for body composi-
tion analysis and an OGTT. Participants returned ~24 h
later for resting BP measurements, as well as a final V
˙ O2peak
test. All procedures were identical and completed at the same
time of day (T0–3 h) as the baseline measures. In attempt to
control for menstrual cycle, baseline and posttraining mea-
sures were scheduled approximately two full cycles apart
(~8 wk, accounting for individuals" cycle duration); however,
the variability within participants" cycles and the time sensi-
tivity of posttraining measures prevented control within T5 d
for most participants.

 Measurements
V
˙O2peak test. Participants performed an incremental test
to exhaustion on an electronically braked cycle ergometer
(Lode Excalibur Sport V 2.0, The Netherlands) to directly
measure V
˙ O2peak and peak power output (PPO) as previously
described (14,15). After a 1-min warm-up at 50 W, power
output increased by 1 W every 2 s until the pedal cadence fell
less than 50 rpm. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide
production were analyzed with a metabolic cart (Moxus; AEI
Technologies, Pittsburgh, PA), and the greatest 30-s average
was recorded as V
˙ O2peak. Tests were considered valid if two
or more of the following criteria were met: a plateau in V
˙ O2
despite increasing intensity, RER 9 1.1, HR within 10 beats
of age-predicted maximum, and/or volitional exhaustion.
mCAFT. The mCAFT was used as a practical method to
estimate V
˙ O2peak, as might be encountered in a clinical or
training setting. According to standardized procedures (7),
participants completed one or more 3-min stages of stepping
using a set of two steps (0.203 m). The frequency of stepping
was predetermined (based on age and gender) and increased
as the test progressed. The test ended when participants
achieved or exceeded 85% of their age-predicted maximum
HR at the end of a 3-min stage.
Resting BP. BP was measured in triplicate while seated
using an automatic oscillometric device in study 1 and study 2
(Contec 08A, Qinhaungdo, China, and Omeron BP765CAN,
Kyoto, Japan, respectively), according to the standardized
technique recommended by the Canadian Hypertension Edu-
cation Program (10). Briefly, participants sat quietly in a room
free from any distractions or interruptions for 10 min before
three measurements that were separated by ~1 min. BP was
determined from an average of the latter two measurements.
Blood sampling. Participants consumed a standardized
meal the evening before an overnight fast. In study 1, a
fasting sample was obtained from an antecubital vein via
venipuncture. For study 2, a standard seven-sample OGTT
was performed (8). An indwelling catheter was inserted into
an antecubital vein, and a fasting blood sample was obtained
before ingestion of a 75-g glucose drink (NERLTM TrutolTM;
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA), followed by
blood samples collected at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min
postingestion. Plasma and serum were separated by centrifu-
gation (10 min at 1500g) and stored at j80-C for subsequent
analysis. Plasma samples were sent to the Core Laboratory
(Hamilton Research Laboratory Medicine Program) for glu-
cose analysis in study 1, and plasma glucose was determined
using the glucose oxidase method with a glucose analyzer (YSI
Stat 2300, Yellow Springs, OH) in study 2. Insulin was mea-
sured by ELISA (ALPCO Immunoassays, Salem, NH). The
area under the curve (AUC) for glucose and insulin was cal-
culated using the trapezoidal rule, and insulin sensitivity was
calculated using the homeostatic (ISI-HOMA) (26) and the
Cederholm models (ISI-Cederholm) (8).
Exercise and training measures. HR was monitored
continuously throughout every session (PolarTeam System;
Polar Electro OY, Kempele, Finland). Participants reported
their RPE using the Borg category ratio scale (0–10) in the
acute phase of study 1 and the 6–20 scale (5) for all subse-
quent phases. The RPE scale was altered from the 1–10 scale
to the 6–20 scale after analysis of the first phase in attempt to
align RPE and HR responses more accurately (5). Blood lac-
tate concentration was measured using regular finger prick
methods with portable lactate analyzers (Lactate Plus; Nova
Biomedical Corporation, Cheshire, UK). For stair climbing, the
number of stairs climbed and the vertical work output (work
[kJ] = body mass [kg] � 9.81 [mIsj2] � height [m]/1000)
were calculated for each session. For cycling, the mechanical
work output was calculated according to the manufacturer.
Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as mean T SD. For the acute phase
of study 1, n = 8 for all measures except for HR (n = 6)
because of technical difficulties. For the chronic phase of
study 1, n = 12 for all measures. For the acute phase of study
2, n = 11 for all measures except peak HR (n = 9) and work
output (n = 10) because of technical difficulties. For the
chronic phase of study 2, n = 11 for all measures except for
resting BP (n = 10), owing to participant unavailability at the
requisite testing time. A two-way repeated-measures
ANOVA was used to test for differences in work output,
peak HR, blood lactate concentration, and RPE in the acute
phases of study 1 (3 � 2 time by mode for work output and
peak HR; 4 � 2 time by mode for blood lactate and RPE)
and study 2 (3 � 3 time by protocol for work output and
peak HR; 2 � 3 time by protocol for blood lactate; 4 � 3
time by protocol for RPE). A one-way repeated-measures
ANOVA was used to test for differences in mean HR be-
tween protocols in the acute phase of study 2, as well as
mean HR, RPE, and total stairs climbed across weeks in the
chronic phase of studies 1 and 2. The Greenhouse–Geisser
correction was used when data did not meet the assumption
of sphericity, and post hoc analyses were completed using
Bonferroni correction. A paired t-test was used to compare
the mean HR in the acute phase of study 1, as well as all pre-
and posttraining measurements in the chronic phases.
Spearman"s rho was used to test for associations between
direct and estimated (i.e., mCAFT) V
˙ O2peak values, given
that the data were not normally distributed. The exercise
training measures reported for the chronic phases (i.e., stairs
climbed, RPE, and HR) are presented as averages from all
training sessions, unless otherwise stated. The level of sig-
nificance for all analyses was set at P e 0.05.
RESULTS
Study 1
Acute phase. Mean HR was similar between the stair
climbing and cycling protocols (P = 0.40; Fig. 1A). Peak HR,
blood lactate, and RPE values increased with each subse-
quent bout (P G 0.01; Table 2). There was an interaction
between mode and time for RPE (P = 0.002) and peak HR

 (P = 0.04), such that stair climbing elicited a lower RPE
before bout 1 (P G 0.01), and a higher peak HR was after
bouts 1 and 2 (P G 0.05). The increase in lactate with each
bout was not different between mode (P = 0.40). Vertical work
output was greater during stair climbing compared with cycling
(main effect for mode, P = 0.01; Table 2).
Chronic phase. Participants completed 99% of all train-
ing sessions without incident, with one participant com-
pleting only 16/18 sessions. Participants climbed 58 T 4 stairs
(11.4 T 0.8 m) during each 20-s bout. There was a main effect
of time across weeks for total stairs climbed each session
(P G 0.001), such that participants improved by 7% from
weeks 1 to 6 (168 T 14 to 180 T 11 stairs per session, P = 0.001).
There was also a main effect of time for average RPE (P =
0.02), which significantly increased from 13.6 T 1.4 in week 1
to 14.4 T 1.6 in week 3 (i.e., ‘‘somewhat hard–hard’’ for both,
P = 0.005), with no further increase thereafter (P Q 0.08).
Participants fatigued by 14% T 4% from the first to the last
10 s within bouts and by 7% T 4% from bouts 1 to 3. When
averaged across the 20-s bouts, HR was 82% T 4%, 88% T
3%, and 90% T 3% of maximum for bouts 1–3, respectively.
The mean HR for the entire 10 min session was 81% T 4% of
max HR, with no effect of time across weeks (P = 0.65).
V
˙ O2peak measured directly increased by 12% after train-
ing (1.80 T 0.25 to 2.02 T 0.27 LIminj1, P G 0.001; Fig. 2A),
and this was associated with an 8% increase in PPO
(P G 0.001, Table 3). V
˙ O2peak estimated from the mCAFT
increased by 4% (P = 0.007; Table 3), and there was a 5%
attenuation in the HR response to the first stage of the
mCAFT after training (152 T 17 to 147 T 21 bpm, P = 0.01).
There were no correlations between direct and estimated
V
˙ O2peak (calculated from the mCAFT) for pretraining
(r = 0.51, P = 0.09), posttraining (r = 0.13, P = 0.68), and
change in V
˙ O2peak (r = 0.35, P = 0.26). There were no
training-induced changes in resting systolic BP (P = 0.82),
diastolic BP (P = 0.97), mean arterial BP (P = 0.86), BMI
(P = 0.39), body mass (P = 0.35), fat-free mass (P = 0.09),
fat mass (P = 0.70), % body fat (P = 0.42), fasting glucose
concentration (P = 0.15), fasting insulin concentration
(P = 0.31), or HOMA-IS (P = 0.52; Table 3).
Study 2
Acute phase. Mean HR was similar between all three
stair climbing protocols (P = 0.20; Fig. 1B). Peak HR, lac-
tate, and RPE values increased with each subsequent bout
(P G 0.01; Table 2). There was a significant interaction

that participants improved by 11% from week 1 to week 6
(232 T 26 to 257 T 30 stairs, P G 0.001). The average RPE
elicited for each session was 14.3 T 1.2 (i.e., ‘‘somewhat

bouts 1 to 3. When averaged across the 60-s bouts, HR was
81% T 6%, 89% T 4%, and 93% T 3% of maximum for

DISCUSSION
The major novel finding of the present work is that brief,
intense stair climbing is a time-efficient strategy to increase
CRF. V
˙ O2peak increased by ~1 MET after 6 wk of training
using the protocol used in study 1, which involved 3 � 20-s
bouts of continuously ascending stairs interspersed with
2 min of recovery. The 12% improvement in V
˙ O2peak for
6 wk was strikingly similar to the improvement reported
by Gillen et al. (15), who used the same protocol, but used
a cycle ergometer to train participants. The protocol used
in study 2, which involved 3 � 60-s bouts of ascending
and descending one flight of stairs, interspersed with 60 s
of recovery, improved V
˙ O2peak by 8%. These data dem-
onstrate that stair climbing is an efficacious model of SIT
for improving CRF, making it a practical alternative to
cycling-based SIT.
Previous studies have reported that ascending stairs for
30–70 min each week for 8 wk can improve CRF (3,4,20,24).
The total time spent ascending and descending stairs in the
present study was much lower amounting to e9 minIwkj1,
with only ~3 min of ascending stairs each week. When the
time required to complete warm-up and cooldown is included,
the total time commitment amounts to 30 minIwkj1. Because
of the influence of perceived ‘‘lack of time’’ and lack of access
to specialized facilities on physical activity participation (35),
it is important to identify time-efficient exercise protocols
that do not require special equipment. Before the present
work, few studies have assessed the efficacy of SIT out-
side a laboratory setting (25) and without the use of spe-
cialized exercise equipment (25,27). Given that SIT has
been established as a time-efficient strategy for improving
CRF (16,34,39,40), the intent of the present work was to
assess the efficacy of SIT when adapted to stair climbing
because it is an accessible form of exercise that could be
easily adopted into daily routine.
Similar Acute Responses to Stair Climbing and
Cycling-Based SIT
The acute exercise data from study 1 of the present inves-
tigation suggests that stair climbing and cycling-based SIT
elicit a similar metabolic stress. By contrast, Oldenburg et al.
(31) reported that the accumulation of blood lactate during
stair climbing was less than that during cycling; however,
they matched power output for the two modes of exercise.
Given that the HR and V
˙ O2 were similar between stair
climbing and cycling (31), the higher blood lactate con-
centration during cycling was likely a result of recruiting a
greater proportion of the leg musculature (i.e., more type II
fibers and a greater reliance on anaerobic metabolism) as
cycling relies on less total muscle mass to generate the same
power as stair climbing. The similar lactate concentrations
reported in study 1 of the present investigation align with
Oldenburg et al. (31) because participants generated more
power output during stair climbing as compared with cycling.
The higher power output generated during stair climbing
was associated with a generally higher peak HR; how-
ever, there were no differences in perceived exertion across
modes. Together, these data suggest that when cycling-based
SIT protocols are transferred to stair climbing, they still elicit
similar, if not greater, acute physiological responses.
Six Weeks of Stair Climbing Improves CRF
by 1 MET
Low CRF has greater consequences than hypertension,
smoking, obesity, and hyperlipidemia in terms of risk for
adverse health outcomes (19). Although athletes have long
used interval training to improve fitness (18), there has been
a renewed interest in SIT due, in part, to the health benefits
that can be achieved with low volumes of exercise. Gist et al.
(16) concluded that despite the reduced volume of work, SIT,
and traditional endurance training are equally effective for
improving V
˙ O2peak, citing a collective improvement of 8%
(~3.6 mLIkgj1Iminj1) within 2–6 wk of training. We found
that 6 wk of brief and intermittent bouts of ‘‘all-out’’ stair
climbing increased relative V
˙ O2peak by 12% or ~1 MET (i.e.,
3.5 mLIkgj1Iminj1). Dose–response analyses suggest that a
1-MET higher V
˙ O2peak is comparable with having a 7-cm
lower waist circumference, a 5-mm Hg lower systolic BP,
or a 1-mM lower fasting plasma glucose in terms of risk for
all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (21).
The improvements in CRF in the present work are similar
to previous stair climbing studies using higher-volume and
lower intensity protocols (3,20,24); however, to our knowl-
edge, only two studies have directly measured aerobic capacity
(3,24), the gold standard in fitness assessment. Of these two
studies, Boreham et al. (3) evaluated a lower-volume pro-
tocol and reported that sedentary women improved their
relative V
˙ O2peak by 17% (4.5 mLIkgj1Iminj1) after 8 wk of
training; however, in addition to a longer training period, peak
training volume was ~825 mIwkj1 at a rate of ~15 mIminj1,
versus 100–150 mIwkj1 at a rate of 34–37 mIminj1 in the
present investigation. This ~7-fold difference in total work
per week and only ~2-fold difference in climbing speed
supports the idea that intensity has a greater effect than
total work (i.e., training volume) for improving aerobic
capacity (13,14).
Given the applied nature and goals of this investiga-
tion, the mCAFT was used as a more practical and real-
istic assessment of CRF that may be encountered in the
field. We found that the mCAFT overestimated V
˙ O2peak, the
improvements detected by the mCAFT were much smaller
compared with the direct V
˙ O2peak test, and correlations be-
tween mCAFT and direct V
˙ O2peak values were poor.

 Although a previous study concluded that the mCAFT was
valid for the general population, it demonstrated low spec-
ificity for participants with poor fitness (38), which agrees
with the overestimated values in our study (~20%). Modifying
the mCAFT might improve its accuracy for individuals with
poor fitness; however, further research with a larger sample
size is necessary.
Other Health-Related Markers
The stair climbing protocols did not improve measures of
insulin sensitivity based on fasting blood samples. Glucose
and insulin concentrations measured during OGTT tests
were also unchanged; however, the increase in OGTT-
derived insulin sensitivity approached significance (P = 0.056).
The lack of improvement in the fasting measures is in
contrast to the results of Gillen et al. (15) but align with
Metcalfe et al. (28,29). The discrepancies could be due in
part to subject characteristics, as the women were over-
weight in Gillen et al. (15) compared with the women in
Metcalfe et al. (28,29) and the present study. It was also
previously reported that OGTT-derived insulin sensitivity
(28,29), and indices of glycemic control based on contin-
uous glucose monitoring (15) were unchanged in women
after cycling-based SIT. Menstrual cycle phase may also
influence insulin sensitivity. When plasma estradiol levels
were increased by ~200%, insulin action was increased by
20% in postmenopausal women when compared with a con-
trol trial (37); however, this may not apply to premenopausal
women. Although we attempted to control for menstrual cycle
in study 2, the variability of menstrual cycles and logistical
issues of time-sensitive measures prevented such control for
most of the women.
Body composition was unchanged after 6 wk of training
with the 3 � 20-s ‘‘all-out’’ protocol; however, there were
small but significant increases in fat-free mass, total body
mass, and BMI after 6 wk of training with the 3 � 60-s 1F
protocol. The reason for the discrepancy is unclear, but the
lack of change in body mass and BMI with the 3 � 20-s
protocol is consistent with previous research (15,28,29) that
used similar cycling-based protocols. We found no changes
in BP for either the 3 � 20-s or 3 � 60-s 1F protocols, which
contrasts with the results by Gillen et al. (15). This may be
due to the fact that the participants in the current study were
younger and not overweight. Given that both groups in the
current study presented with healthy BP measures at base-
line (10), the potential to further decrease values with just
6 wk of training is likely minimized.
Protocol Modifications
The aim of study 2 was to improve the practicality of
the 3 � 20-s ‘‘all-out’’ protocol so that it could be com-
pleted at a submaximal pace in a house or small building,
while still eliciting a similar improvement in CRF. The 20-s
bouts of continuously ascending as fast as safely possible
(~60 stairs or ~3 stories) were adjusted to 60 s of vigorously
climbing up and down one or two flights (10–18 stairs or
~1 story). The 3 � 20-s and 3 � 60-s protocols elicited a
similar RPE, peak HR after each bout, and mean HR for
the entire 10-min sessions, potentially owing to the de-
creased climbing pace but increased exercise duration. Inter-
estingly, most participants preferred the 3 � 20-s protocol
over the 3 � 60-s protocols, and most of the participants
chose the 3 � 60-s 1F protocol over the 2F. Many partic-
ipants reported that they were required to turn too many
corners during the 2F protocol, which sometimes led to
feelings of instability.
Stair Climbing Is a Practical Model of SIT
Stair climbing is likely to be an effective form of exercise
given that public health physical activity initiatives are ef-
fective when they are lifestyle based (11), and the total stairs
climbed each week independently predicts risk of cardio-
vascular disease and all-cause mortality (23). Stair climbing
is also likely to be more practical than cycling and running-
based SIT protocols for the general population because it
can be completed outdoors and indoors in private and public
settings with no associated costs. Opdenacker et al. (32)
demonstrated that lifestyle-based physical activity interven-
tions (i.e., integrated into daily routine and home-based pro-
grams supported by telephone calls) are just as efficacious but
more effective than structured physical activity interventions
(i.e., supervised in a fitness facility) such that maintenance of
CRF was better 2 yr after intervention. Stair climbing-based
SIT is also practical because climbing stairs is an important
but neglected skill that is necessary for maintaining mobility
and independence throughout the life span (30). Furthermore,
the stair climbing protocols used in this investigation are based
on individuals" perceived exertion and therefore can elicit an
appropriate stimulus for many different fitness levels. Subjects
in the present study completed training sessions without any
incident, suggesting that brief and intermittent bouts of stair
climbing are a tolerable and appropriate form of exercise for
sedentary adults.
CONCLUSION
In summary, we report that a 10-min exercise protocol
involving a total of 1–3 min of intermittent stair climbing
improved CRF when performed 3 dIwkj1 for 6 wk. The
investigation demonstrates that stair climbing represents a
model of low-volume SIT that is efficacious when performed
outside a laboratory setting. We recognize that training was
not completed in free-living conditions, and therefore future
studies should assess the retention and effectiveness of home
or work-based SIT using stair climbing with larger sample
sizes. The conclusions that can be made from our data are 1)
the acute physiological and perceptual responses to ‘‘all-out’’
stair climbing and cycling SIT are similar; 2) brief and inter-
mittent bursts of stair climbing can markedly improve CRF in

 6 wk, similarly to cycling-based protocols; and 3) despite the
low volume of exercise, an all-out pace was not necessary to
improve CRF. With a minimal weekly time-commitment of
30 min, brief and intermittent bouts of intense stair climbing
are a plausible alternative to cycling-based SIT.
