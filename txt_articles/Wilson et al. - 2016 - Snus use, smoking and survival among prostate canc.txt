Smoking is associated with prostate cancer mortality. The Scandinavian smokeless tobacco product snus is a source of nico-
tine but not the combustion products of smoke and has not been studied with respect to prostate cancer survival. The study
is nested among 9,582 men with incident prostate cancer within a prospective cohort of 336,381 Swedish construction work-
ers. Information on tobacco use was collected at study entry between 1971 and 1992, and categorized into (i) never users of
any tobacco, (ii) exclusive snus: ever users of snus only, (iii) exclusive smokers: ever smokers (cigarette, cigar and/or pipe)
only and (iv) ever users of both snus and smoking. Hazard ratios for prostate cancer-specific and total mortality for smoking
and snus use based on Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, calendar period at diagnosis and body mass index
at baseline. During 36 years of follow-up, 4,758 patients died—2,489 due to prostate cancer. Compared to never users of
tobacco, exclusive smokers were at increased risk of prostate cancer mortality (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.05–1.27) and total mortali-
ty (HR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.09–1.26). Exclusive snus users also had increased risks for prostate cancer mortality (HR 1.24, 95%
CI: 1.03–1.49) and total mortality (HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.04–1.37). Among men diagnosed with nonmetastatic disease, the HR
for prostate cancer death among exclusive snus users was 3.17 (95% CI: 1.66–6.06). The study is limited by a single assess-
ment of tobacco use prior to diagnosis. Snus use was associated with increased risks of prostate cancer and total mortality
among prostate cancer patients. This suggests that tobacco-related components such as nicotine or tobacco-specific carcino-
gens may promote cancer progression independent of tobacco’s combustion products.
The medical community and the general public generally accept
that cigarette smoking is a major determinant of mortality. Per-
haps less appreciated, a pooled analysis of nearly one million
people found that 17% of this excess mortality was due to
causes of death not typically associated with smoking, including
prostate cancer.1 The 2014 Surgeon General’s report found cur-
rent or recent smoking was associated with an increased risk of
advanced-stage prostate cancer and death from prostate cancer,
although not associated with overall incidence of the disease.2–7
Because the specific compounds in cigarettes that most strongly
influence prostate cancer outcomes have not been identified, it
is not clear the extent to which other tobacco products, some of
which are increasing in popularity, also pose risks.
Snus, a moist smokeless tobacco product common in Scan-
dinavia, is of interest in the study of the biological effects of
tobacco, as users are exposed to high levels of nicotine and oth-
er compounds over long periods of time, but without exposure
to tobacco combustion products known to influence cancer
risk and outcomes.8,9 The potential effect of snus on cancer
progression is also of policy interest, as snus is generally sug-
gested as a risk-reducing alternative to smoking by authorities
including the World Health Organization.10–13 In fact, tobacco
companies have introduced and promoted the use of snus out-
side of Sweden as a healthier alternative to smoking over the
past decade and have sold it in the United States since 2006.
No study to date has investigated whether snus use is, in
fact, a less detrimental alternative to smoking among men
with prostate cancer. We used data from a cohort of male
Swedish construction workers to study the associations of
both smoking and snus use with prostate cancer mortality
among 9,582 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between
1971 and 2007.

 annual preventive health check-ups to all construction work-
ers in the industry between 1969 and 1992. A total of
343,811 male workers had at least one visit between 1971
and 1992. Each visit included detailed questions about tobac-
co use.
The nationwide Swedish Cancer Register, established in 1958
and 96–98% complete,14 was used to identify incident cases of
prostate cancer to form the study population for this analysis.
Men with previous history of any cancer at study entry were
excluded. We included 9,582 workers with a diagnosis of pros-
tate cancer after the time of the first study visit and between
1971 and 2007. Mortality and cause of death through 2007, the
most recent date for which mortality data was available, were
ascertained through linkage to the nationwide Swedish Death
Register, which has been shown to have high reliability for
cause-of-death among prostate cancer patients.15–17 Follow-up
for mortality in Sweden is essentially complete.
Information on tumor characteristics for men with newly
diagnosed prostate cancer was available from the National
Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden, which has been
nation-wide since 1998 with a capture rate of 98% compared
to the Swedish Cancer Register. Thus tumor characteristics
were available for 5,346 men (56% of total). In this subset of
cases, we defined risk categories using a modified version of
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Practice Guide-
lines in Oncology, Version.1.2010, based on stage, Gleason
score and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis.18
Low risk was defined as clinical stage T1 or T2, Gleason score
2–6 and PSA <10 ng/ml. Intermediate risk was stage T1-T2,
Gleason score 7 and/or PSA 10 to <20 ng/ml. High risk local-
ized disease was stage T3-T4 and/or Gleason 8–10, and/or
PSA 20-<50 ng/ml. Regionally metastatic disease was defined
as N1 and/or PSA 50 to <100 ng/ml and M0/MX. Distant
metastases was defined as M1 and/or PSA >5100 ng/ml.
Assessment of tobacco use
Between 1971 and 1975, participating workers filled out a
200-item questionnaire with detailed questions about smok-
ing and snus use. Collection of information on tobacco use
was not done in 1976–1977 but resumed in 1978 with a
questionnaire completed by the examining nurse. All data
were compiled in a central computerized register. The num-
ber of total visits per person ranged from 1 to 13. However,
we limited our analysis to exposure information collected in
the first visit because the number and timing of visits may be
linked with mortality. Based on the first visit, never, past and
current tobacco use was obtained and past and current users
were combined. Therefore, men were classified as (i) never
users of any tobacco, (ii) ever users of snus only (“exclusive
snus”), (iii) ever smokers only: cigarette, cigar and/or pipe
(“exclusive smoking”) and (iv) ever users of both snus and
smoking (either concurrently or sequentially).
Statistical analysis
Each worker contributed person-time from the date of pros-
tate cancer diagnosis to the date of death, emigration, or end
of study, December 31, 2007, whichever came first. The asso-
ciation between tobacco use and either prostate cancer-
specific or total mortality was studied using Cox proportional
hazards models with time since cancer diagnosis as the
underlying time scale. Models were stratified by age at diag-
nosis (<60 years, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74, 751 years) and time
period of diagnosis (1971–1984, 1985–1994, 1995–2007) and
were adjusted for body mass index (BMI) at baseline (contin-
uous) and time between baseline examination and cancer
diagnosis (continuous). In the subset of patients with clinical
data, additional models were adjusted for stage, grade and
PSA at diagnosis. We also studied the association between
tobacco use and death among men diagnosed with nonmeta-
static disease, i.e., excluding those with evidence of regionally
spread disease and distant metastases, under the hypothesis
that lifestyle factors may play a greater role in survival
among men with less advanced disease at diagnosis.
SAS statistical software (release 9.2) was used for the anal-
ysis. The study was approved by the Stockholm Regional
Ethics Vetting Board.
Results
We identified 9,582 new cases of prostate cancer among
workers with at least one clinic visit prior to diagnosis. Mean
age at diagnosis was 70.2 years. During the study period
4,758 (50%) men died. Of those, 52% (n 5 2,489) died of
prostate cancer. The mean time from study entry/baseline
examination to prostate cancer diagnosis was 20.6 years
(range: 1 week–33.2 years), and the mean follow-up time
after diagnosis was 4.5 years. 869 cases (9%) were diagnosed
between 1972 and 1984, 2,674 (28%) between 1985 and 1994
and 6,039 (63%) from 1995 to 2004. Among the 5,346 cases
included in The National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR)
of Sweden, the median PSA at diagnosis was 15.0 ng/ml, and
What’s new?
Snus, a smokeless tobacco product, is often promoted as a safe alternative to cigarettes as it lacks the combustion products
of smoking that are generally associated with cancer risk. Here the authors show that snus use is independently associated
with risks of overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality that are comparable to cigarette smoking. These findings may lead
to a re-evaluation of the public health impact of smokeless tobacco products as they suggest that nicotine or possibly other
tobacco ingredients play a role in the progression of prostate cancer.

 20% had Gleason 8–10 disease. 20% of cases were diagnosed
with distant metastases and another 10% with regionally
spread disease.
Table 1 describes the study population according to tobac-
co use at study entry. Never users accounted for 29% of the
population, while 5% were exclusive snus users, 50% were
exclusive smokers (cigarettes, pipe and/or cigars) and 16%
both used snus and smoked. Mean age at diagnosis was
slightly higher among exclusive snus users and slightly lower
among users of both. Mean BMI at study entry was slightly
higher among exclusive snus users than in other groups.
Mean duration of snus use at baseline among exclusive snus
users was 24.3 years and 15.2 years among users of both.
Mean duration of smoking was 24.7 years among exclusive
smokers and 23.0 years among users of both. The frequency
of Gleason score 8–10 at diagnosis was similar across groups.
PSA at diagnosis was 15.0 ng/mL among never users, 16.0
ng/mL among exclusive smokers, 16.0 ng/mL among exclu-
sive snus users and 13.6 ng/mL among users of both. Users
of both snus and smoking were slightly more likely to be in
lower risk groups at diagnosis, while distribution of risk
groups was similar in the other three groups.
Compared to never users, men in all three groups of
tobacco use were at increased risk of overall mortality (Table
2; HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.04–1.37 for exclusive snus; HR 1.17,
95% CI: 1.09–1.26 for exclusive smoking; HR 1.17, 95% CI:
1.06–1.28 for both). Exclusive snus users and exclusive smok-
ers were at increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortali-
ty, with a hazard ratio of 1.24 (95% CI: 1.03–1.49) for
exclusive snus users and 1.15, (95% CI: 1.05–1.27) for

 exclusive smokers. Users of both were at nonsignificantly
increased risk of prostate cancer death (HR 1.08, 95% CI:
0.95–1.23).
When the analysis was restricted to men with available
tumor characteristics, results were largely similar, though
some associations were no longer statistically significant, like-
ly due to smaller numbers of events (Table 2).
In the subgroup of men diagnosed with nonmetastatic dis-
ease, men in all three groups of tobacco use were at increased
risk of total mortality, with somewhat greater hazard ratios
than observed for the total patient cohort (Table 2). The
association between tobacco use and prostate cancer-specific
death was also more pronounced. Exclusive snus users had a
hazard ratio of 3.17, 95% CI: 1.66–6.06, exclusive smokers
had a hazard ratio of 1.33, 95% CI: 0.85–2.08, and users of
both had a hazard ratio of 1.93, 95% CI: 1.11–3.35.
Discussion
Data from this large cohort study provides further support
that tobacco use increases the risk of total mortality as well
as prostate cancer-specific mortality among men newly diag-
nosed with prostate cancer.2–4 For the first time, we also
show an excess risk of overall and cancer-specific mortality
among snus users, a noteworthy observation as snus is
generally considered and has been promoted, as a healthier
and less carcinogenic alternative to smoking.10–13 Indeed,
among men who never smoked, snus use was positively asso-
ciated with overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality.
A previous study in this cohort19 among all cancer cases
found an excess risk of cancer specific death among exclusive
snus users, exclusive smokers and combined users (snus and
smoking), with a 24% increased risk among exclusive snus
users. A study in Uppsala county, Sweden among men with-
out cancer at baseline found an increased risk of all-cause
mortality for those who reported any snus use and a sugges-
tion of an increased risk of cancer mortality for exclusive
snus use (HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.96–1.69).20
There are many hypothesized mechanisms behind the
association between snus use and prostate cancer progression,
although the exact mechanism is unclear. While snus users
are not exposed to the combustion products of tobacco, they
are exposed to nicotine and to multiple carcinogens present
in smokeless tobacco, such as tobacco-specific nitrosamines
(TSNAs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile
aldehydes and N-nitrosamino acids (NNAs), which have
been shown to form DNA adducts.21–25 Furthermore, they
also contain aldehydes and metals, which have been associat-
ed with inflammation and increased cell proliferation.25

 Snus users have blood levels of nicotine metabolites
similar to those seen in cigarette smokers.26 Experimental
evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies suggests that nico-
tine, while not carcinogenic, may promote cancer progression
at concentrations relevant to tobacco use.27 Nicotine binds to
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), which are present
in various nonneuronal tissues.28 A broad range of laboratory
findings show that nicotine promotes cell proliferation and
angiogenesis through its effects on nAChR in breast and lung
cancer cell lines and in animal models of breast and colon
cancer.7,27,29–35
Nicotine and nAChR expression has not been studied in
prostate cancer models. However, a variety of signaling cas-
cades downstream of nAChR play important roles in prostate
cancer, including the c-Src, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK and
HIF-1alpha.36–41 These effects of nicotine could explain, in
part, the association of smoking and snus with prostate can-
cer progression, but lack of association with cancer incidence.
Beyond nicotine, snus users are exposed to multiple
tobacco-derived carcinogens. The TSNA content of snus is
comparable to cigarette smoke.9,42–44 TSNAs, including 4-
(methylnitrosamino)21–(3-pyridyl)21-butanone (NNK) and
N0-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), are carcinogenic compounds
formed during the processing of tobacco and have been
shown to cause lung, nasal and esophageal tumors in various
rodent models and to induce DNA adducts.22,45 In addition,
these compounds, like their precursor nicotine, bind to
nAChR to promote tumor progression through multiple
pathways.46,47
While our results are suggestive, particularly in light of
previous cell line studies, animal models and epidemiologi-
cal studies, it is important to note several important limita-
tions of this work. First, we have only a single assessment of
tobacco use, recorded an average of 20 years before cancer
diagnosis. This leaves room for substantial misclassification
of tobacco use closer to and after the cancer diagnosis. It is
likely that some users in all three tobacco use categories
quit after the examination or after their diagnosis, given
general trends over time. Such measurement error would
result in an underestimation of the true effect of snus use
and smoking on mortality. In addition, if smokers were
more likely to quit than snus users, due to the perception
that snus is less harmful, then the extent of the underesti-
mation might be greater for smoking groups than for the
exclusive snus group. The lack of detailed smoking history
prevents us from evaluating a dose-response relationship or
examining whether quitting is eventually associated with
lower prostate cancer mortality, which is an important pub-
lic health question. However, despite these limitations of the
data, this unique cohort adds to our understanding of
tobacco and prostate cancer survival.
Our study is also limited by the lack of covariate data,
such as leisure-time physical activity. However, because few
lifestyle factors have been strongly related to prostate cancer
mortality, the lack of lifestyle information is less likely to
substantially influence the results than for other causes of
mortality. We did adjust for BMI at study entry, as exclusive
snus users had slightly higher mean BMI at this point; how-
ever, we lack information on BMI at later time points, which
may be important given evidence that obesity plays a role in
prostate cancer progression.48 Unfortunately, we did not have
information on the use of PSA screening among the men in
this study, preventing us from ruling out differences in
screening according to tobacco use at study entry. However,
median PSA at diagnosis was similar between tobacco use
groups, and the associations remained when we adjusted for
stage and grade, and when we restricted the analysis to
patients in lower risk categories at diagnosis. With that said,
the number of prostate cancer deaths among exclusive snus
users is low when restricted to lower-risk categories.
In addition to adding to our understanding of the biology
of prostate cancer, our findings have important implications
for public health policy. Snus has been marketed as a less
harmful alternative to smoking,10–13,49,50 and is sometimes pro-
moted as a smoking cessation aid, despite several studies find-
ing
no
benefit.51
Indeed,
the
US
Food
and
Drug
Administration (FDA) received and rejected an application
from Swedish manufacturers seeking approval to modify lan-
guage on snus warning labeling to state: “No tobacco product
is safe but this product presents substantially lower risks to
health than cigarettes.”52 However, the content of TSNAs and
other carcinogens in snus is quite variable and is not labeled
or routinely monitored.24 Other smokeless tobacco products
are also increasing in popularity. Particularly, e-cigarettes are
increasingly common, with recent surveys reporting 12.6% of
adults ever tried an e-cigarette and e-cigarette use tripling
among adolescents in just one year.53–58 In addition, a recent
survey of high school students found those who had ever used
e-cigarettes were more likely to report use of combustible
tobacco products.59 E-cigarettes are marketed as safer than cig-
arette smoking, with companies claiming they are healthier,
cheaper and cleaner than cigarettes.60,61 However, the concen-
tration of nicotine in e-cigarette liquid varies widely across
and even within products,62 and some e-cigarettes also contain
TSNAs and other toxicants.63
Conclusions
We found that a history of both smoking and snus use was
associated with increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mor-
tality and total mortality among men with prostate cancer in
a large cohort in Sweden. Our results suggest that nicotine or
other carcinogens in smokeless tobacco products may pro-
mote cancer progression independent of the combustion
products of tobacco smoke and may have implications for
the regulation of smokeless tobacco products.
