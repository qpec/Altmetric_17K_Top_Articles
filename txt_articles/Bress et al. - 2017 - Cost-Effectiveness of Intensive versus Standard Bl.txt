Abstract
BACKGROUND—In the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), adults at high 
risk for cardiovascular disease who received intensive systolic blood-pressure control (target, <120 
mm Hg) had significantly lower rates of death and cardiovascular disease events than did those 
who received standard control (target, <140 mm Hg). On the basis of these data, we wanted to 
determine the lifetime health benefits and health care costs associated with intensive control versus 
standard control.
METHODS—We used a microsimulation model to apply SPRINT treatment effects and health 
care costs from national sources to a hypothetical cohort of SPRINT-eligible adults. The model 
projected lifetime costs of treatment and monitoring in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular 
disease events and subsequent treatment costs, treatment-related risks of serious adverse events 
and subsequent costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for intensive control versus 
standard control of systolic blood pressure.
RESULTS—We determined that the mean number of QALYs would be 0.27 higher among 
patients who received intensive control than among those who received standard control and 
would cost approximately $47,000 more per QALY gained if there were a reduction in adherence 
and treatment effects after 5 years; the cost would be approximately $28,000 more per QALY 
gained if the treatment effects persisted for the remaining lifetime of the patient. Most simulation 
results indicated that intensive treatment would be cost-effective (51 to 79% below the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY and 76 to 93% below the threshold of 
$100,000 per QALY), regardless of whether treatment effects were reduced after 5 years or 
persisted for the remaining lifetime.
CONCLUSIONS—In this simulation study, intensive systolic blood-pressure control prevented 
cardiovascular disease events and prolonged life and did so at levels below common willingness-
to-pay thresholds per QALY, regardless of whether benefits were reduced after 5 years or persisted

 for the patient’s remaining lifetime. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and 
others; SPRINT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01206062.)
THE MOST EFFECTIVE BLOOD-PRESSURE goals for treatment with antihypertensive 
medications are uncertain. Treating hypertension to standard systolic blood-pressure goals is 
cost-saving or cost-effective among patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease in the 
United States.1 However, until recently, evidence from randomized trials did not clearly 
support intensive control of systolic blood pressure.2–4
The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) showed significant reductions in 
the rates of death and cardiovascular disease events with intensive systolic blood-pressure 
control (intensive control; target, <120 mm Hg) versus standard control (target, <140 mm 
Hg) among adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease who had no history of diabetes, 
stroke, or heart failure.5,6 Intensive control may prevent cardiovascular disease events in 
high-risk patients and reduce health care costs, as compared with standard control, but these 
benefits must be weighed against the increased risk of serious adverse events and higher 
implementation costs (e.g., additional office visits, laboratory tests, and medications). The 
purpose of this SPRINT cost-effectiveness study was to estimate lifetime health gains and 
averted health care costs with intensive control after considering increased treatment costs 
and the risks of treatment-related serious adverse events.
METHODS
MICROSIMULATION MODEL
We developed a microsimulation model to estimate costs, clinical outcomes, and quality-
adjusted life-years (QALYs) of systolic blood-pressure control in SPRINT-eligible adults 
(Fig. 1; and Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org). The model compared the lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness of 
intensive control with that of standard control with the use of 6-month cycles. We accounted 
for health gained and lost to society due to intensive control and for payers’ direct health 
care costs; patients’ indirect costs were not included.
We used SPRINT results to estimate the risk of death from all causes and from 
cardiovascular causes, cardiovascular disease events, and serious adverse events in 10,000 
hypothetical patients who shared the same baseline characteristics, inclusion criteria, and 
number of intervention medications with SPRINT participants (Table 1, and Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).6 Cardiovascular disease events included acute myocardial 
infarction, acute coronary syndrome not resulting in myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart 
failure. Serious adverse events of interest were hypotension, syncope, bradycardia, 
electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury.6
PROBABILITY OF CLINICAL EVENTS
For the first 5 years of the simulation, we assumed that patients had adhered to medications 
as observed in SPRINT and were at risk for treatment-related serious adverse events, first 
fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular disease events, and death from causes other than 
cardiovascular disease as reported for their assigned study groups. For survivors of incident

 cardiovascular disease events in the base case, we used risk equations of the American 
College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC–AHA) Pooled Cohorts7 
to determine the risk of repeated cardiovascular disease events. We varied these estimates in 
scenario analyses. Other probabilities were derived from national sources and published 
literature (Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
During the initial 5-year period, our estimates of risks and benefits of intensive control 
versus standard control reflected the medication adherence of the SPRINT participants. 
After the initial 5-year period, we used four post-trial persistence-of-treatment-effect 
scenarios to simulate the degree to which the effects of intensive control would persist for 
patients’ remaining lifetimes. The four scenarios used different assumptions about the 
prevalence and duration of treatment adherence. In all four scenarios, we estimated the risks 
of a first cardiovascular disease event or serious adverse event in the subgroup of patients 
who were assumed to maintain treatment adherence similar to that of SPRINT participants 
on the basis of observed SPRINT estimates for their assigned study group. In this model, 
patients who did not adhere to their medication regimen reverted to their baseline, pretrial 
systolic blood pressure, and we used the Pooled Cohort risk equations to estimate the risk of 
a cardiovascular disease event on the basis of the systolic blood pressure and other 
characteristics.7 In all the patients, we based the competing risk of death from causes other 
than cardiovascular disease on the life tables of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention.8
In the first scenario (base case), we simulated the possibility that medication adherence and 
therefore treatment effects would be gradually reduced after the first 5 years in the two study 
groups until 15 years after baseline, after which all the patients would no longer adhere to 
their assigned treatment (Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The probability 
of treatment adherence after the initial 5 years was stratified according to the number of 
antihypertensive medications (i.e., lower adherence was associated with an increased 
number of medications).10–12 In the second scenario (worst case), patients stopped adhering 
to their medication regimen immediately after the initial 5-year period. In the third scenario 
(15-year best case), patients adhered to their medication regimen and had treatment effects 
(including those after a cardiovascular disease event) that persisted for 15 years, after which 
all the patients immediately did not adhere to the medication regimen. Finally, in the fourth 
scenario (lifetime best case), patients had age-stratified SPRINT in-trial adherence and 
treatment effects that persisted over their remaining lifetime.
COSTS
We calculated the total direct medical costs over the remaining lifetime of the patients. 
These costs included those associated with the intervention (i.e., medications, office visits, 
and laboratory monitoring), with acute and chronic cardiovascular disease events, with acute 
serious adverse events, and with background health care for the treatment of 
noncardiovascular diseases (Tables S1 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Medication 
costs were calculated with the use of a weighted average cost of generic formulary 
medications used in SPRINT, the distribution of prescribed medication classes in SPRINT, 
and wholesale acquisition costs.6,13 We derived the costs of office visits and laboratory

 monitoring from the schedules for physician and laboratory fees from the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services.14,15 Other costs were calculated from common sources 
and were stratified according to age and separated by cost type.16–18 All cost inputs were 
inflated to 2017 U.S. dollars.19 Future costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually.
UTILITY VALUES OF HEALTH STATES
Utility values, an overall assessment of well-being on a scale of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health 
without disability), reflect the severity of disability in health states. We derived utility values 
that were specific for patients’ long-term health state from the results on the EuroQol Group 
5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D) from the Medical Expenditure Panel 
Survey for the base case and EQ-5D results directly measured in SPRINT in a scenario 
analysis.20 Disutility and costs were applied for acute cardiovascular disease events and 
acute kidney injury for 4 weeks and for other serious adverse events for 2 weeks.1,21,22 After 
the occurrence of cardiovascular disease events, disutility penalties and costs were applied 
for long-term sequelae.
MODEL VALIDATION
We validated the model quantitatively (i.e., comparing model predictions with the event rates 
that were observed in SPRINT) and by visual inspection (i.e., comparing cumulative 
incidence curves between SPRINT observations and model predictions). We compared the 
predicted and observed cumulative incidence of and hazard ratios for the primary outcome 
of a first fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular disease event at the median follow-up (3.3 years) in 
SPRINT. For longer-term validation, we visually compared model predictions with the 
cumulative incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in the Framingham 
Heart Study cohorts.23
SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
We varied each input value in the model over a plausible range in one-way sensitivity 
analyses to examine the effect of uncertainty regarding individual values on the results. 
Scenario analyses examined the effect of various assumptions with respect to medication 
adherence (including self-reported adherence, as measured in SPRINT with the use of an 
eight-item Morisky adherence scale24,25), a restricted time horizon, the risk of death from 
causes other than cardiovascular disease, the number of office and laboratory visits, the risk 
of serious adverse events, the costs of antihypertensive medication and background health 
care, a substitution of the characteristics of SPRINT-eligible adults in the general U.S. 
population,26 alternative utility estimates, and pill-taking disutility (i.e., the overall health 
state [utility value] of daily pill-taking) (Tables S3 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
To reassess cost-effectiveness in case the Pooled Cohort risk equations underestimated the 
risk of repeated cardiovascular disease events, we included a scenario that substituted a 
higher average risk of such events as predicted by the Framingham Recurrent Coronary 
Heart Disease calculator.27 To assess whether the Pooled Cohort risk equations 
overestimated the risk of incident cardiovascular disease, we adjusted the predicted risk to 
reflect the lower average risk of cardiovascular disease of more contemporary cohorts.28 In 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the model was run 1000 times, each taking random draws 
from prespecified uncertainty distributions of all inputs.

 STUDY OVERSIGHT
The authors wrote the manuscript and attest to the completeness and accuracy of the data 
and analysis. The manuscript was reviewed and approved by the SPRINT steering 
committee and publications subcommittee. In this study, since we were performing 
secondary analyses of deidentified data, we sought no approval from institutional review 
boards. The institutional review board at each trial site and an independent data and safety 
monitoring board reviewed, approved, and monitored the conduct of SPRINT while the 
original trial was being performed.
RESULTS
MODEL VALIDATION
The microsimulation model accurately reproduced the risks and cumulative incidence curves 
for the primary outcome, components of the primary outcome, and serious adverse events in 
SPRINT during the 5-year trial period (Table S6 and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Base-case simulated incidence rates for the SPRINT primary outcome at 3.3 
years were 17.3 events per 1000 person-years in the intensive-control group and 22.2 events 
per 1000 person-years in the standard-control group, as compared with 16.5 and 21.9 events 
per 1000 person-years, respectively, in the actual trial. The predicted hazard ratio for the 
primary outcome in the simulation was 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 0.87), as 
compared with the observed hazard ratio of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.89). Long-term 
validation of the microsimulation model is shown in Figure S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
MAIN ANALYSIS
In the base-case scenario, in which adherence and treatment effects are reduced after 5 years, 
the model predicted that intensive control would prevent 170 incident primary outcome 
events and 190 deaths from cardiovascular disease over the remaining lifetime of 10,000 
patients, as compared with standard treatment (Fig. 2A, and Table S7 and Figs. S5, S6, and 
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the best-case scenario, 929 primary outcome events 
and 464 deaths from cardiovascular disease would be prevented. Background health care 
costs were the largest component of lifetime health care costs (Fig. 2B, and Table S8 and 
Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The higher costs that were associated with 
increased survival, treatment for hypertension, and serious adverse events with intensive 
control were offset by decreased costs for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
In the base case, intensive control cost approximately $47,000 more per QALY gained than 
standard control (Table 2). In 1000 probabilistic simulations, there was a 54% probability 
that intensive control was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per 
QALY and a 79% probability at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curves are provided in Figure 3, and cost-effectiveness scatter plots are shown 
in Figure S9 in the Supplementary Appendix. Health gains and cost-effectiveness were 
sensitive to whether the benefits of intensive control extended past the 5-year trial period. In 
the best-case scenario in which adherence and treatment effects persisted over the patient’s 
lifetime, intensive control cost approximately $28,000 per QALY gained; the probability that

 intensive control was cost-effective increased to 79% at $50,000 per QALY and to 93% at 
$100,000 per QALY.
All post-trial persistence-of-treatment-effect scenarios had similar incremental cost-
effectiveness ratios (ICERs) at the end of the in-trial period. The cost-effectiveness of 
intensive control was maximized at approximately 20 years in the lifetime best-case scenario 
and at 10 years in the other persistence-of-treatment-effect scenarios (Fig. S10 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The estimate of the cost-effectiveness of intensive control was 
similar to the overall estimate in most subgroups that were examined. The exceptions were 
seen in patients who were 75 years of age or older, who had a more favorable ICER 
($26,000 per QALY gained); and in women and patients with previous cardiovascular 
disease, who had less favorable ICERs ($77,000 and $72,000 per QALY gained, 
respectively) (Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).
ONE-WAY SENSITIVITY AND SCENARIO ANALYSES
The uncertainty ranges of individual variables had a small-to-moderate effect on cost-
effectiveness (ICER range, $31,000 to $69,000 per QALY) (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The model was most sensitive to the hazard ratio for cardiovascular disease 
events with intensive control, the risk of cardiovascular disease events with standard control, 
the risk of end-stage renal disease after chronic kidney disease, the hazard ratio for death 
from causes other than cardiovascular disease with intensive control during the first 5 years, 
and the risk of chronic kidney disease with standard control. Each of these factors 
potentially increased the ICER above $50,000 per QALY (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Values that were associated with renal outcomes accounted for 4 of the 10 inputs 
to which the results were most sensitive. Variation in other values had little effect and 
resulted in ICERs that differed from the base-case ICER by less than $10,000 per QALY. 
There was a small-to-moderate difference between the results of 36 separate scenario 
analyses and the base-case estimate (ICERs of $37,000 to $76,000 per QALY). Conservative 
values for “real world” medication adherence resulted in ICERs ranging from $38,000 to 
$50,000 per QALY. When the base-case model was populated with a cohort representing the 
characteristics of SPRINT-eligible U.S. adults in the general population, the ICER was 
$46,000 per QALY (Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
DISCUSSION
We found that intensive systolic blood-pressure control among adults at high risk for 
cardiovascular disease was cost-effective and below common U.S. willingness-to-pay 
thresholds in most simulations (51 to 79% below $50,000 per QALY29,30 and 76 to 93% 
below $100,000 per QALY), regardless of whether the benefits were reduced after 5 years or 
persisted for the remaining lifetime of the patient. Intensive control entailed more frequent 
office visits, laboratory tests, and greater medication use than did standard control, and such 
factors were costly early on. However, these costs were balanced by health gains from 
prevented cardiovascular disease events and deaths. The predicted cost-effectiveness was 
maximized after approximately 10 to 20 years of treatment. Since our analysis time horizon 
extended beyond the SPRINT observation period to evaluate the potential value of lifetime

 intensive control, we accounted for a plausible range of possible treatment effects during the 
post-trial period, medication adherence, and risks of serious adverse events in the assessment 
of cost-effectiveness.
In two previous cost-effectiveness analyses, the investigators projected that intensive control 
of blood pressure would be cost-effective among U.S. adults at high risk for cardiovascular 
disease.31,32 Moise and colleagues estimated more favorable ICERs for intensive control 
than for standard control among U.S. adults at high cardiovascular risk, but they did not 
define a high risk of cardiovascular disease strictly according to SPRINT eligibility criteria; 
in addition, they simulated only a 10-year time horizon and did not account for the costs of 
treating noncardiovascular diseases in their cost-effectiveness calculations.31 Richman et al. 
used a lifetime horizon, with their main cost-effectiveness estimate of approximately 
$24,000 per QALY gained, which was presumably based on lifetime persistence of the 
benefits of intensive control as defined in SPRINT.32 Our base case assumed a reduction in 
treatment effects over time on the basis of standard practice for cost-effectiveness analysis of 
clinical trials. If we assume similar conditions to those in the analysis by Richman et al. 
(apart from allowing for repeated cardiovascular disease events), our model showed an ICER 
of approximately $37,000 per QALY gained. As opposed to the Richman et al. approach, in 
which the participants reverted to the standard-control group after a first cardiovascular 
disease event, we kept participants in their assigned treatment group after a first event, a 
method that was consistent with the SPRINT intention-to-treat design. When Richman et al. 
restricted the benefits that were reported in SPRINT to the median follow-up period in 
SPRINT (3.3 years), intensive control resulted in an ICER of approximately $35,000, a 
finding that was consistent with our results when we restricted benefits to 5 years (with an 
ICER of approximately $41,000 per QALY gained) (Fig. S10 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Approximately 17 million U.S. adults meet SPRINT eligibility criteria and stand to benefit 
from intensive control of systolic blood pressure.26,33 Recent hypertension guidelines from 
Canada and Australia incorporated evidence from SPRINT and recommended the 
consideration of intensive control in selected patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular 
disease, with close follow-up for serious adverse events.34,35 An ACC–AHA statement 
recommended that clinical-practice guidelines integrate cost-effectiveness assessments such 
as ours.29 Our study contributes to the formulation of hypertension guidelines by showing 
the potential lifetime benefits and cost-effectiveness of intensive control of systolic blood 
pressure incremental to standard control among high-risk patients. Our results suggest that 
the maximized cost-effectiveness of intensive control depends on extending treatment 
beyond 5 years. Research is needed on ways to implement and sustain protocols for 
intensive control for patients who are most likely to benefit.
This analysis was based on effectiveness, the risk of serious adverse events, medication 
adherence, and quality-of-life data gathered in SPRINT and adhered to standards for cost-
effectiveness analyses (Tables S11 and S12 in the Supplementary Appendix).36,37 There 
were several limitations. Our simulations represent a range of hypothetical treatment effects 
projected beyond the SPRINT trial period, since long-term data on treatment effects of 
intensive control versus standard control beyond the end of the trial are not available.

 Methods of blood-pressure measurement in most current clinical practices differ from the 
automated blood-pressure approach used in SPRINT. This issue did not come into play in 
our analysis, since the effects of intensive control were modeled as relative risks of outcomes 
and not as changes in systolic blood pressure. The benefits that were observed in SPRINT 
are consistent with aggregate evidence supporting benefits of intensive control among 
patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease.38–40 However, because SPRINT excluded 
patients with a history of diabetes, stroke, or heart failure, our results should be extended 
only with caution to such patients.2,3
Although there was no significant difference in the rate of combined serious adverse events 
between the intensive-control group and the standard-control group in SPRINT, we 
conservatively modeled the risk of specific outcomes that were classified as serious adverse 
events or as resulting in an emergency department visit. Nonetheless, the risks of serious 
adverse events that were observed in SPRINT may not represent such risks that would be 
expected if patients who are treated in the community underwent intensive control. We 
estimated that the underlying risks of serious adverse events in the two study groups would 
need to be 2.75 times the risks observed in SPRINT or that the risks of serious adverse 
events in the intensive-control group would need to be 1.64 times the risk in the standard-
control group to push the ICER for intensive control above $50,000 per QALY (Figs. S12 
and S13 in the Supplementary Appendix). When we assumed that there was no between-
group difference in the risk of combined serious adverse events (i.e., the overall result in 
SPRINT), the ICER was even lower ($34,000 per QALY for the base case) (Fig. S13 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
In conclusion, in this simulation study, we found that intensive control of systolic blood 
pressure prevented cardiovascular disease events and prolonged life and did so at a cost that 
was below common willingness-to-pay thresholds, regardless of whether the benefits were 
reduced after 5 years or persisted for the remaining lifetime of the patient.

 Figure 1. Structure of the SPRINT Simulation Model
Shown is the microsimulation model used to estimate costs, clinical outcomes, and quality-
adjusted life-years of intensive control of systolic blood pressure in adults who were eligible 
to participate in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). (A complete list 
of the eligibility criteria for participation in SPRINT is provided in the Methods section in 
the Supplementary Appendix.) Panel A shows the two interventions — intensive control and 
standard control of systolic blood pressure — and health states of the patients, and Panel B 
shows the three categories of subsequent clinical events: cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
events, serious adverse events, and death from causes other than cardiovascular disease. The 
blue square indicates the decision node, the point at which a treatment strategy is chosen; the 
purple encircled letter “M” indicates the Markov node, with branches indicating the health 
states in transition every 6 months; the green circle indicates the chance node, after which 
there is a probability of the occurrence of each event; and the red triangle indicates the 
terminal node, the end of a pathway within a 6-month cycle. ACS denotes acute coronary 
syndrome, and MI myocardial infarction.

 Figure 2. Incidence Rate Ratios for the Primary Outcome and Incremental Direct Medical Costs 
for Intensive versus Standard Control, According to Four Scenarios for Medication Adherence 
and Treatment Effect
Panel A shows incidence rate ratios for the SPRINT primary outcome (the first occurrence 
of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome not resulting in myocardial infarction, 
stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes) for intensive control versus 
standard control of systolic blood pressure during the simulation over different time periods. 
The results are shown according to the four post-trial persistence-of-treatment-effect 
scenarios: base case (i.e., reduced adherence to the medication regimen and treatment effects 
after 5 years until total nonadherence and no treatment effects at 15 years), worst case (i.e., 
nonadherence and no treatment effects after 5 years), best case until 15 years (i.e., in-trial 
adherence and persistence of treatment effects for 15 years), and lifetime best case (i.e., 
lifetime in-trial adherence and persistence of treatment effects). Although the assumptions 
and input were identical for all four scenarios for the first 5 years of the simulation, there 
were small differences in the incidence rate ratios for cardiovascular disease events for the 
period from 0 to 5 years that reflect the role of chance in the microsimulation approach. The 
I bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Panel B shows the range of mean cumulative 
incremental direct medical costs of intensive control versus standard control of systolic 
blood pressure, according to the expenditure — including costs associated with serious 
adverse events, treatment, background health care for the treatment of noncardiovascular

 Figure 3. Probability of Cost-Effectiveness of Intensive versus Standard Blood-Pressure Control
Shown is the probability of the cost-effectiveness of intensive control of systolic blood 
pressure, as compared with standard control, according to a range of willingness-to-pay 
thresholds (the cost in dollars per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). The curves represent 
the four post-trial persistence-of-treatment-effect scenarios. The curves were generated from 
the results of the probabilistic analysis in which the model was run 1000 times with the use 
of random draws for all model measurements to capture joint uncertainty in the model 
results.

*Shown are the results of probabilistic analyses running the model 1000 times with the use of randomly selected values for input measurements from predefined distributions. The uncertainty intervals (UIs) show the 2.5 to 97.5 percentiles for the incremental differences in costs 
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The uncertainty of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which was calculated as the cost per QALY gained, is shown by the probability that intensive control is cost-effective at the specified willingness-to-pay thresholds. Costs 
are direct medical costs. The four post-trial scenarios for medication adherence and treatment effects are as follows: base case (reduced adherence and treatment effects after 5 years until nonadherence and no treatment effects at 15 years), worst case (nonadherence and no 
treatment effects after 5 years), best case until 15 years (in-trial adherence and persistence of treatment effects for 15 years), and lifetime best case (lifetime in-trial adherence and treatment effects).
