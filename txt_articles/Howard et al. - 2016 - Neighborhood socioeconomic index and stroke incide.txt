Neighborhood socioeconomic index and
stroke incidence in a national cohort of
blacks and whites
ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess the relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics and
incident stroke in a national cohort of black and white participants.
Methods: The study comprised black (n 5 10,274, 41%) and white (n 5 14,601) stroke-free
participants, aged 45 and older, enrolled in 2003–2007 in Reasons for Geographic and Racial
Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), a national population-based cohort. A neighborhood socioeco-
nomic score (nSES) was constructed using 6 neighborhood variables. Incident stroke was defined
as first occurrence of stroke over an average 7.5 (SD 3.0) years of follow-up. Proportional haz-
ards models were used to estimate associations between nSES score and incident stroke,
adjusted for demographics (age, race, sex, region), individual socioeconomic status (SES) (edu-
cation, household income), and other risk factors for stroke.
Results: After adjustment for demographics, compared to the highest nSES quartile, stroke inci-
dence increased with each decreasing nSES quartile. The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval)
ranged from 1.28 (1.05–1.56) in quartile 3 to 1.38 (1.13–1.68) in quartile 2 to 1.56 (1.26–1.92)
in quartile 1 (p , 0.0001 for linear trend). After adjustment for individual SES, the trend remained
marginally significant (p 5 0.085). Although there was no evidence of a differential effect by race
or sex, adjustment for stroke risk factors attenuated the association between nSES and stroke in
both black and white participants, with greater attenuation in black participants.
Conclusions: Risk of incident stroke increased with decreasing nSES but the effect of nSES is
attenuated through individual SES and stroke risk factors. The effect of neighborhood socioeco-
nomic characteristics that contribute to increased stroke risk is similar in black and white
participants. Neurology® 2016;87:2340–2347

Social and economic characteristics of neighborhoods have been identified as important factors
in health, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, and mortality.1–8 The literature is generally
consistent in showing that those living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods have
poorer health. However, many studies were cross-sectional, limiting interpretability.9 Recently,
studies exploring long-term implications of neighborhood exposures on health outcomes have
been reported.10–12
While much attention has focused on the impact of individual socioeconomic status (SES) on
risk of stroke,11,13 there is limited research on the relationship between neighborhood socioeco-
nomic characteristics (nSES) and stroke risk. Most nSES studies have been restricted to stroke
mortality or have not accounted for individual-level SES or modifiable stroke risk factors.6,11,13–16

 Further, most studies in the United States
have not been national, using data from only
a few communities.7,15–17
In US studies where nSES has been used as
a proxy for individual SES, living in socioeco-
nomically disadvantaged neighborhoods con-
fers an increased risk of incident stroke in
most7,15,16 but not all studies.1 In few of these
was it possible to determine whether nSES
contributes to stroke risk independent of
individual SES. Furthermore, some studies
reported differential association by sex or race
groups.6,7,15,18,19 Here we examine the rela-
tionship of nSES, individual-level SES, and
stroke risk factors with stroke incidence in
a large, longitudinal US cohort including
black and white participants across different
age, sex, and SES groups living in diverse SES
neighborhoods.
METHODS The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differen-
ces in Stroke (REGARDS) study is a longitudinal, population-
based cohort study designed to identify factors associated with
higher stroke mortality among black participants and residents
of the stroke belt region, the 8 southern states of North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi,
Alabama, Louisiana, and Arkansas.20,21 Additionally, within the
stroke belt, a buckle region along the coastal plains of North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia has been identified with
even higher stroke mortality.22 By design, black participants and
residents of the stroke belt were oversampled with enrollment of
30,239 community-dwelling individuals, age 45 years and older,
between 2003 and 2007. Twenty-one percent of the sample was
from the stroke buckle, 35% from the rest of the stroke belt, and
the remaining 44% from the other 40 contiguous states.
Residents were sampled from 1,833 counties, approximately
60% of the counties in the continental United States. A map
showing the distribution of participants’ state of residence at
time
of
enrollment
has
been
previously
published.23
A
commercially available list was used to identify individuals who
were contacted by mail, followed by telephone. Through
a
computer-assisted
telephone
interview
(CATI),
trained
interviewers
obtained
demographic
information,
medical
history, and lifestyle factors, including a selection of risk
factors. Between 3 to 4 weeks after the CATI, a brief physical
examination was conducted including height and weight, blood
pressure measurements, blood and urine samples, and an ECG.
Follow-up is by CATI every 6 months for suspected stroke (or
proxy-reported in case of participants unable to respond).
Additional methodologic details are provided elsewhere.21,23
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and participant
consents. Consent was obtained initially by telephone and later in
writing during the in-person evaluation. The study methods were
approved by the institutional review boards of participating
institutions.
Primary exposure: nSES. Participants were linked to neigh-
borhood of residence by home address at baseline. Addresses were
geocoded using SAS/GIS batch geocoding, described in detail
elsewhere.24 Only results where geocoding could match an
address to a longitude/latitude with 80% or higher probability
were included. A subset of results was validated against a commer-
cially available program and found high agreement between the
algorithms. The geocoded addresses were linked to the appropri-
ate residential census block in the 2000 US census. Given their
small spatial and population size, census block groups can be used
as a proxy for neighborhood, and their characteristics have been
shown to be robust predictors of health.25,26 A summary nSES
index variable was created based on previously published meth-
ods, including 6 variables representing wealth/income, education,
and occupation: (1) log of median household income, (2) log of
median value of owner-occupied housing units, (3) proportion of
households receiving interest, dividend, or net rental income, (4)
proportion of adults aged $25 years with a high school diploma, (5)
proportion of adults aged $25 years with college degree, and (6)
proportion of people employed in executive, managerial, or
professional occupations.3,25 The summary nSES score, constructed
by summing Z scores for these variables, ranged from 211.8 to 29.0,
with increasing values indicating higher nSES. Quartile 4 represents
the highest nSES (most advantaged neighborhoods) and quartile 1
the lowest.
Covariates. Individual-level SES factors, defined by annual
household income and education, were used as covariates in addi-
tion to risk factors in the Framingham Stroke Risk Score (FSRS),
i.e., age, sex, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive med-
ications, smoking, history of heart disease, diabetes, left ventricu-
lar hypertrophy (LVH), and atrial fibrillation. Age, race, sex, use
of antihypertensive therapy, smoking (current vs not), annual
household income (below $20,000/year, $20,000–$34,000/year,
$35,000–$74,000/year, $75,000/year or above, refused), and
education level (, high school, high school graduate, some col-
lege, $ college graduate) were classified according to self-report.
After the participant was seated for 5 minutes, 2 blood pressure
measurements were taken by a trained technician using a standard
protocol and averaged. Heart disease history was defined as self-
reported myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass
surgery, coronary angioplasty or stenting, or ECG evidence of
MI. Diabetes was defined as fasting glucose level $126 mL/dL
(or if participant was nonfasting, $200 mL/dL), or self-reported
medication use for glucose control. LVH was determined by
centrally read ECG. Atrial fibrillation was based on self-
reported history of physician diagnosis or ECG.
Stroke outcome. Methods of determination of incident stroke
have previously been reported.23 During follow-up, participants
or a proxy were queried for possible stroke, transient ischemic
attack (TIA), death, hospitalization, or emergency department
visit. Report of death, potential stroke, TIA, brain aneurysm,
brain hemorrhage, stroke symptoms, or unknown reason for
hospitalization generated a request for retrieval of medical
records. Initial review of records was conducted by a senior
stroke nurse to exclude obvious nonstroke; then records of
participants with suspected stroke were centrally adjudicated by
physicians.
Death

used the WHO definition.27 “Clinical strokes” were events not

or

agreed the event was likely a stroke but insufficient information
was available to meet other classifications. This analysis included
WHO-defined, clinical, and probable stroke. Because risk factors
such as hypertension play a dominant role in both ischemic and

 hemorrhagic stroke, adjustment for risk factors would be likely to
play a similar role, and as such, our outcome included both
subtypes. Reported events as of October 2015 were included.
Statistical analyses. Demographics, nSES variables, nSES
score, and risk factors were described as mean (SD) and n (%)
as appropriate, by nSES quartile. Cox proportional hazards anal-
ysis was used to examine hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI) for incident stroke associated with quartiles of
nSES score, with the 4th quartile used as the reference. The pro-
portional hazards assumption was assessed and no major concerns
arose. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, and region (demo-
graphic model), further adjusted for individual-level SES
(education and household income), and then for components
of the FSRS. Because many census blocks (over 50%) include
a small number of participants, hierarchical analysis was not
feasible or appropriate. Adjusted models included an age by
race interaction because of the documented higher stroke
incidence for black than white participants at younger ages.23
Sensitivity analysis restricted to ischemic stroke was performed.
Tests for interaction were conducted between (1) race and nSES,
(2) race and sex, and (3) race, sex, and nSES. Evidence of
interaction was determined by an a priori a level of 0.10. A
priori, we hypothesized a differential effect in black and white
participants as found in the US Cardiovascular Health Study
(CHS),7 but the interaction was not significant (p 5 0.94);
however, for comparison purposes, race-stratified analyses were
conducted. Also, because previous studies of stroke and nSES
provided evidence for differential associations by sex,6,15,18,19 we
conducted a 3-way interaction test among race, sex, and nSES; it
was not significant (p 5 0.54).
RESULTS The analysis cohort comprised 24,875
participants (10,274, 41% black), excluding those
with no follow-up (2%), self-reported stroke at
baseline (6%), and missing geocoded address (9%).
Those in more SES advantaged neighborhoods were
older, more likely to be men, less likely to be black,
less likely to live in the stroke belt/buckle, more
likely to have higher individual SES, and less likely
to have stroke risk factors (table 1).
During a mean follow-up of 7.5 years (SD 3.0),
929 first-ever strokes occurred, 49% in women, and
43% in black participants. In the unadjusted model,
compared to the highest nSES quartile, stroke inci-
dence increased with each decreasing nSES quartile
(table 2). The HR (95% CI) ranged from 1.27
(1.05–1.54) in quartile 3 to 1.38 (1.14–1.68) in
quartile 2 to 1.60 (1.33–1.93) in quartile 1. There
was a linear trend for increasing stroke risk with
decreasing nSES (p , 0.0001). The HRs changed
only slightly and the association remained after
adjustment for demographics and the age 3 race
interaction. Adjustment for individual SES substan-
tially attenuated (z50%) the association of nSES
with stroke risk, e.g., reducing the HR for the lowest
nSES quartile from 1.56 (1.26–1.92) to 1.25 (0.99–
1.56); however, the trend for increasing stroke risk
with decreasing nSES remained marginal (p 5
0.085). The HR ranged from 1.15 (0.94–1.40) in
quartile 3 to 1.16 (0.95–1.44) in quartile 2 to 1.25
(0.99–1.56) in quartile 1. There was additional atten-
uation of the HRs after adjustment for stroke risk
factors, reducing the HR for the lowest nSES quartile
to 1.13 (0.89–1.42), and the test for linear trend
became nonsignificant (p 5 0.45). Results restricted
to only ischemic stroke were similar (table e-1 at
Neurology.org).
Results for black and white participants did not
differ, with a monotonic increase in risk with lower
nSES in both groups (table 3). However, for white
participants, there was a greater risk of stroke in all 3
of the lower quartiles of nSES, while for black par-
ticipants there was a higher stroke risk only in the
lowest nSES quartile. This pattern remained after
adjustment for demographic factors. As the com-
bined group showed, the associations were substan-
tially attenuated after adjustment in the individual
SES model, with further attenuation in the risk fac-
tor model. The adjustment for individual SES and
risk factors had a greater impact in black than white
participants.
DISCUSSION In this longitudinal study of black
and white participants living across the United
States, we found that residents in neighborhoods
with lower socioeconomic characteristics had a high-
er risk of stroke compared to residents in neighbor-
hoods with higher socioeconomic characteristics,
with an increase in stroke risk with each lower quar-
tile of nSES. This higher stroke risk remained after
adjustment for age, race, sex, and an age-by-race
interaction.
Although
the
association
between
nSES and incident stroke was no longer significant
after further adjustment for individual SES, the
trend was marginally significant. The association
was further weakened by adjustment for stroke risk
factors. This indicates that the worse cardiovascular
risk factor profile of residents in lower nSES
neighborhoods may be in the pathway of the
association of nSES with stroke risk.
This is consistent with evidence showing that fac-
tors associated with living in more disadvantaged
neighborhoods contribute to stroke risk. However,
it is difficult to separate the influence of individual
SES from nSES. Individual risk factors are often in-
tertwined with neighborhood environment. Neigh-
borhood residence may contribute to development
of stroke risk through built environment, access to
care, exposure to stressors such as racial discrimina-
tion, high level of unemployment or underemploy-
ment, available choices for schooling, availability of
fresh produce, and social norms influencing dietary
patterns and other health behaviors and lifestyle
choices. Residents living in areas of low nSES have
been shown to have higher levels of unhealthy behav-
iors such as smoking and physical inactivity and

 higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors such as
diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.28–32 Thus, these
findings support ongoing calls for community devel-
opment policies, urban planning, and zoning and
transportation policies that address neighborhood
socioeconomic contexts to improve residential envi-
ronments in order to positively impact the health of
the community members.10,12
Previous epidemiologic studies of incident stroke
have provided evidence for an inverse association
between nSES and risk of stroke in a manner similar
to our results.7,14–16,33 Our study extends these
findings by providing data from a national US sample
with greater heterogeneity of neighborhoods, the abil-
ity to assess the independent impact of nSES after
adjustment for individual SES (and traditional stroke
risk factors), and with a sufficient sample size of black
and white participants to assess a potential racial dif-
ference in the impact of nSES. The study most com-
parable to REGARDS in methodology is the CHS,
a prospective cohort study of adults 65 and older (785
black and 3,834 white) living in 4 US communities.7
In CHS, for white participants, there was a trend for
ischemic stroke risk to be higher for residents of lower

 nSES, and this trend was marginally significant after
adjustment for demographic factors and individual
SES (p 5 0.069).7 In contrast, for black participants,
there was a trend for ischemic stroke risk to be lower
for residents of lower nSES, and this trend was also
marginally significant after full adjustment (p 5
0.08).7 While CHS did not report a p value for inter-
action between nSES and race, one would presume
that it would have been significant since the reported
race-specific associations were marginally significant
and in different directions. Hence, the interpretation
of the CHS findings is that nSES has a differential
effect for black and white participants. Our findings
stand in stark contrast to this, where, for all models
considered for both black and white participants, the
stroke risk was higher in lower nSES neighborhoods,
and the magnitude of association was generally similar
(pinteraction . 0.9). There are 2 important similarities.
First, with the significant association between nSES
and stroke risk attenuated to a level of marginal sta-
tistical significance, the consistent message suggests
that nSES contributes to stroke risk beyond individ-
ual SES. Second, for CHS white participants, and for
both white and black participants in REGARDS, fur-
ther adjustment for biological risk factors substan-
tially attenuated the association of nSES and stroke
risk, supporting speculation that these worse biolog-
ical risk factor profiles in lower SES neighborhoods
are in the pathway to higher stroke risk. There are
a number of differences between the 2 studies: RE-
GARDS included younger ages, a larger number and
more diverse neighborhoods (potentially for black
participants, who could be from more homogeneous
SES neighborhoods), and a larger sample size of
black participants. In the United States, compared
to white persons, black persons tend to live in neigh-
borhoods of lower SES.8,34 In addition, we observed
a nominally larger mediation of the association
between nSES and stroke risk in black than white
participants, suggesting that the correlation between
nSES and stroke risk factors is larger in black than
white participants.
Our findings support the consistent pattern of
greater stroke incidence in persons from socioeco-
nomically poor areas observed in other studies (table
e-2)35,36; however, few studies also included measures
of individual SES7,14,15,18 or prestroke risk fac-
tors.6,14,18 In some studies, there was evidence sugges-
tive of a differential effect for men and women,
although not always in the same direction.6,15,18,19,37
We found no evidence of a differential effect of nSES
on stroke risk by sex.
There are many strengths to this study. First, it in-
cludes individuals of low, middle, upper-middle, and
high individual SES, both white and black partici-
pants across 1,833 urban and rural counties in the
United States. Other major strengths include a large
sample size of both black and white participants,
a wide range of neighborhoods, risk factors measured
prior to stroke, and physician-adjudicated incident
strokes. There are also some limitations. Those who
agreed to participate in REGARDS may not be repre-
sentative of the general population, potentially reduc-
ing generalizability. By design, our study only
included black and white participants, so the diversity
of racial/ethnic groups in the United States is not rep-
resented. Data on individual measures of SES are lim-
ited, with some recommended measures such as past
socioeconomic experiences not available. A few ad-
dresses could not be geocoded. We only used baseline
residence and did not include information on how
long the individual lived there or whether he or she
moved during the follow-up period but fewer than
10% changed address during follow-up. Current res-
idence also may not include the time period most rel-
evant to development of stroke risk. Because risk
factors were assessed only once and could have
changed over the 7-year follow-up, the possibility of
residual confounding exists. Finally, individuals resid-
ing in a neighborhood may not all share the same
socioeconomic characteristics.
In this national study of black and white partici-
pants across the United States, the risk of incident
stroke increased with decreasing neighborhood
socioeconomic characteristics. This association ap-
peared to be explained by individual SES and risk
factors for stroke. The attenuation by individual-
level SES implies that it may be difficult to separate
the effects of individual SES from neighborhoods
where those with lower individual SES live. The fur-
ther attenuation after adjustment for stroke risk fac-
tors suggests these may be in the causal pathway, i.e.,
lower SES (either nSES or individual) may lead to
a worse stroke risk profile, which in turn leads to
an increased risk of stroke. Additional research
should include other race/ethnic groups and investi-
gate potential differential effects by sex and race/eth-
nic groups, including risk factors for stroke that may
be more prevalent in subgroups within disadvan-
taged neighborhoods.
