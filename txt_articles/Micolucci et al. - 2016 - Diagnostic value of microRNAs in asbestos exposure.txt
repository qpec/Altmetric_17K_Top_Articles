ABSTRACT
Background: Asbestos is a harmful and exceptionally persistent natural material. 
Malignant mesothelioma (MM), an asbestos-related disease, is an insidious, lethal 
cancer that is poorly responsive to current treatments. Minimally invasive, specific, 
and sensitive biomarkers providing early and effective diagnosis in high-risk patients 
are urgently needed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are endogenous, non-coding, small 
RNAs with established diagnostic value in cancer and pollution exposure. A systematic 
review and a qualitative meta-analysis were conducted to identify high-confidence 
miRNAs that can serve as biomarkers of asbestos exposure and MM.
Methods: The major biomedical databases were systematically searched for 
miRNA expression signatures related to asbestos exposure and MM. The qualitative 
meta-analysis applied a novel vote-counting method that takes into account multiple 
parameters. The most significant miRNAs thus identified were then subjected to 
functional and bioinformatic analysis to assess their biomarker potential.
Results: A pool of deregulated circulating and tissue miRNAs with biomarker 
potential for MM was identified and designated as “mesomiRs” (MM-associated 
miRNAs). Comparison of data from asbestos-exposed and MM subjects found that 
the most promising candidates for a multimarker signature were circulating miR-
126-3p, miR-103a-3p, and miR-625-3p in combination with mesothelin. The most 
consistently described tissue miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-126-3p, miR-143-3p, miR-
145-5p, miR-192-5p, miR-193a-3p, miR-200b-3p, miR-203a-3p, and miR-652-3p, 
were also found to provide a diagnostic signature and should be further investigated 
as possible therapeutic targets.
Conclusion: The qualitative meta-analysis and functional investigation confirmed 
the early diagnostic value of two miRNA signatures for MM. Large-scale, standardized 
validation studies are needed to assess their clinical relevance, so as to move from 
the workbench to the clinic.

INTRODUCTION
“Asbestos” is a generic term for a group of natural 
crystalline silicates that have been classified by the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as 
“carcinogenic to humans (Group 1)” [1].
These minerals were inexpensive and have been 
used in extraordinary amounts for decades in a variety 
of small- and large-scale industrial applications all 
over the world [2, 3]. Occupational exposure has long 
been considered the form involving the highest risk of 
developing asbestos-related diseases (ARDs). Their slow 
and insidious onset and progression involve that the 
ban on asbestos production and use and the adoption of 
asbestos abatement programs over recent decades have 
not yet eliminated the risk of developing ARDs [3, 4]. 
In addition, because there is no safe level of exposure, 
even merely living near plants using asbestos involves 
a high risk [3, 5, 6]. Repair, renovation, and demolition 
of asbestos-containing buildings also pose a threat 
through soil contamination, environmental pollution, and 
bystander exposure [6, 7]. Asbestos workers themselves 
can contaminate their homes and cars, exposing family 
members and housemates [3]. Airborne fibers and leisure 
activities such as running, horseback riding, and use 
of all-terrain vehicles that stir polluted soil are further 
sources [5, 7]. Although current regulations regard 
only six commercial mineral fibers (actinolite, amosite, 
anthophyllite, chrysotile, crocidolite, and tremolite) [8], 
several other mineral fibers found in the environment, such 
as erionite (zeolite group), whose carcinogenic activity 
is even greater than that of chrysotile and crocidolite 
asbestos, are also involved in ARD development [8, 9].
Asbestos exposure entails inhalation of mineral 
fibers and their accumulation in the lungs, where they 
cause a variety of adverse effects that include production 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS), chromosome damage, 
disturbance of mitosis, gene mutations, alteration 
of growth factor signaling, defects in the apoptotic 
machinery, deregulation of methylation status, chronic 
inflammation, phagocytosis, and aberrant microRNA 
(miRNA, miR) expression [7, 10]. In the lung parenchyma, 
asbestos can cause non-malignant inflammatory diseases 
such as permanent fibrosis (asbestosis) and accumulation 
of asbestos bodies, which are composed of fibers coated 
with iron-containing protein [10, 11]. Fibers engulfed 
in the parenchyma can cause pleural plaques, i.e. 
asymptomatic focal thickenings that are the hallmark of 
asbestos exposure [12], and abnormal fluid collections, 
while fibers trapped between the pleural layers and 
the wall of the chest cavity induce oxidative stress and 
chronic inflammation, thus promoting carcinogenesis [10]. 
Moreover, very recent evidence indicates that asbestos 
causes the release of High Mobility Group Box Protein-1 
(HMGB1), which drives the chronic inflammatory process 
that leads to fibrosis and carcinogenesis [13]. Neoplastic 
degeneration includes pleural mesothelioma, peritoneal 
mesothelioma and, albeit rare, mesothelioma of other 
mesothelial surfaces and bronchogenic carcinoma [10, 11, 
14, 15]. A cumulative exposure of 25 fibers/year has been 
estimated to double the risk of lung cancer [16]. However, 
it is difficult to determine the level of asbestos exposure 
in these terms. Current surveillance programs consider 
both estimated cumulative asbestos exposure (using job-
specific questionnaire forms) and radiographic detection 
of pleural plaques and/or asbestosis [11, 17, 18].
Malignant mesothelioma: etiopathogenesis and 
clinical features
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive, 
lethal cancer arising from the mesothelial cells of pleural 
(80-90%), peritoneal (10-15%), and pericardial cavities 
(< 5%) [19]. Its long latency (≥ 30-60 years) [20] and 
non-specific symptoms often involve late diagnosis and 
poor survival [21]. MM is among the few cancers that 
have been causally related to asbestos, erionite [8, 9], 
ionizing radiation [7], and Simian Virus 40 (SV40), a 
DNA monkey virus that appears to be a co-carcinogen 
with asbestos exposure [22-26]. MM has been relatively 
uncommon until the second half of the 20th century [20, 
27]. Its incidence then began to rise in many industrialized 
countries [28] and is expected to peak between 2015 and 
2025 [21, 29]. However, given the intense and widespread 
use of asbestos worldwide, the health risk related to 
exposure may be underestimated [29-31]. Globally, one 
MM case every four/five is believed to go unreported [32]. 
A recent assessment has attributed about 25% of all MM 
cases to occupational exposure, 25% to familial exposure, 
and 50% to environmental exposure [5]. Occupationally 
exposed patients of a median age of 74 years are more 
likely to be men, whereas the case distribution at younger 
median ages (< 40 years) is similar for both genders, and 
is probably related to environmental exposure [33, 34]. 
In the latter subjects, MM, uveal melanoma and other 
cancers have also been related to genetic predisposing 
factors such as germline mutations in the gene encoding 
BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) [35, 36]. Moreover, 
a growing body of evidence has been relating MM to 
urban development in rural areas in Cappadocia, North 
Dakota, Nevada, and New Caledonia after asbestos and 
erionite fiber contamination [9, 37].
The definitive diagnosis of pleural malignancy 
requires invasion and relies on pleural biopsy, 
pathology, and immunohistochemistry [27, 38]. The 
differential diagnosis from benign proliferations and 
other malignancies is highly complex [38, 39], as is 
histological characterization into epithelioid (50-60% of 
cases), sarcomatoid (10-20%), biphasic (25-35%), and 
other, less common subtypes [40, 41]. MM management 
is controversial and there is currently no cure for it.

Only palliative therapies are available. Morbidity and 
mortality can be reduced by multimodal therapeutic 
protocols that involve pleurectomy/decortication and 
extrapleural pneumonectomy, ideally followed by 
treatment with antifolate pemetrexed and cisplatin, 
or adjuvant radiotherapy, which are available at some 
specialized centers [42]. The success and feasibility 
of such approaches depend on tumor stage and patient 
performance status and co-morbidity; however, long-
term survival is rare and quality of life poor. Advanced 
stage, poor differentiation, co-morbidities, advanced age, 
failure to undergo surgical resection, and male gender are 
associated with a poorer prognosis [21, 42].
The identification of specific, easy-to-analyze 
biomarkers would greatly help minimally invasive 
diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of response to 
therapy. Early, accurate diagnosis is critical and would 
enable patient-tailored care and management. The search 
for proteins that may serve as MM biomarkers has 
been ongoing for more than 20 years [43]. Two highly 
specific proteins, osteopontin and soluble mesothelin-
related protein, have been found to lack sensitivity when 
used individually [44-46], but could be harnessed in 
multimarker diagnostic panels [47]. According to recent 
findings miRNAs, a class of short, non-coding RNAs, 
are differentially expressed during the development 
and progression of several diseases including tumors, 
suggesting a role for them as clinical cancer biomarkers 
[28, 48]. However, the search for miRNAs with diagnostic/
prognostic relevance for MM has so far been inconclusive.
Nature and value of miRNAs in clinical practice
MiRNAs interact with target mRNAs in a sequence-
specific manner and provide an additional level of post-
transcriptional modulation. They play important roles in 
several physiological and pathological processes such as 
cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and metabolism, 
angiogenesis, stress response, tissue remodeling, disease 
and malignancy [49-54].
High-quality miRNAs are found in tissue, cells, and 
body fluids, making them practical, non-invasive markers 
[55, 57]. It has been established that unique miRNA 
expression profiles are associated with different cancer 
types [58, 59], and that about 50% of known human 
miRNA genes are found in genome areas associated with 
cancer susceptibility [60-62]. Some miRNA signatures 
have successfully been applied in lung cancer screening, 
diagnosis, and follow-up [63], and miRNA combinations 
may also be sensitive to the effects of pollution [64].
Specific carriers ensure stability of cell-free 
miRNAs. Extracellular vesicles (EV), e.g. exosomes 
and microvesicles, are actively secreted by malignant 
cells into surrounding body fluids and may play a role 
as “communication shuttles” [65, 66]. The finding that 
cell-free miRNAs are also associated with Argonaute 
(Ago) proteins and are mostly EV-free has suggested that 
extracellular Ago2-miRNA complexes may be residuals 
of dead cells [67]. The hypothesis has also been advanced 
that cells could release a functional miRNA-induced 
silencing complex into the circulation [68]. In addition, 
functional targeting abilities have also been demonstrated 
for high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) that transport 
endogenous miRNAs to recipient cells [69]. Such carriers 
are a unique source of specific miRNA biomarkers.
In this study, data on deregulated miRNAs reported 
in specimens from asbestos-exposed and MM subjects 
were systematically reviewed, and a qualitative meta-
analysis was conducted to assess their diagnostic potential 
and find evidence-based diagnostic miRNA signatures for 
asbestos exposure and MM.
RESULTS: OVERVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND 
SUMMARY OF MAIN RESULTS
MiRNAs related to MM: state of the art
The variety of techniques and approaches adopted 
in the 39 selected studies makes it difficult to classify 
them and summarize their findings concisely. However, 
study design enabled their subdivision into 19 papers 
largely addressing miRNA profiling, 11 performing 
single-miRNA expression analysis, and 9 evaluating 
miRNA activity by functional assays. As noted below 
(5.1, Literature search and screening), the latter articles 
were considered only for their qualitative contribution. 
Moreover, only 6 of the 39 studies investigated miRNA-
induced epigenetic modifications, and another explored 
miRNA deregulation in asbestos-related lung cancers, 
including adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, 
small cell lung cancer and large cell lung cancer [70]. 
Since studies of peritoneal and pericardial mesothelioma 
are not available, in the present review all MM-associated 
miRNAs refer to pleural mesothelioma.
MiRNA profiling studies
Since a multitude of miRNAs function in networks 
to modulate gene expression pathways, we considered 
expression profiling as the most effective high-throughput 
screening approach to analyze hundreds of miRNAs 
simultaneously.
• 
MiRNA profiling in MM tissues. Guled and 
colleagues were the first to document the 
deregulation of a multitude of miRNAs in 
MM samples both compared with normal 
tissue (pericardium from healthy subjects) 
and among the epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and 
biphasic subtypes [71]. Further studies seeking 
to distinguish MM from other cancers first 
identified 7 MM-specific miRNAs, including 
 Oncotarget
58609
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141 and miR-429, 
as useful tools for differential diagnosis from 
adenocarcinoma, but not among different 
histological types [72]. Differential expression 
of miR-193-3p, miR-192 and miR-200c has 
subsequently been demonstrated in MM tissue 
compared with carcinomas [73], whereas 
miR-29c* (miR-29c-5p according to the 
upgraded nomenclature) has been proposed 
as a prognostic biomarker [74]. Combined 
analysis of miRNA expression patterns and 
functional assays has highlighted that miR-1 is 
down-regulated in MM compared with normal 
mesothelium, and that its forced expression can 
inhibit cell proliferation and apoptosis [75]. By 
a similar approach, miR-145 loss has been seen 
to distinguish MM from normal mesothelial 
tissue [76]. Andersen’s group has identified 
four miRNAs as diagnostic classifiers capable 
of differentiating MM from non-cancer samples 
with high overall accuracy, and demonstrated 
that chemotherapy reduces their differential 
expression [77]. The two most recent studies 
in the field have disclosed that 19 miRNAs are 
differentially expressed in MM, chronic pleural 
inflammation and mesothelial hyperplasia 
compared with non-cancer/non-inflammatory 
tissue [78], and that the expression of 6 
miRNAs enabled predicting survival in MM 
patients [79]. Eleven significantly up-regulated 
miRNAs have been identified in MM compared 
with benign asbestos-related pleural effusion 
[80].
• 
Thirteen novel asbestos-related miRNAs 
and inversely correlated target genes have 
been identified by an integrative analysis of 
miRNA, mRNAs and copy number alterations 
of chromosomal regions in tissue samples 
from lung cancer patients with high asbestos 
exposure and without exposure [70].
• 
MiRNA profiling in MM cells. Use of MM 
cell lines allows to address the problem of 
collecting suitable numbers of MM tissue 
samples. The results of the first two studies, 
exploring the in vitro expression profiles of 
MM cell lines compared with mesothelial cells 
[81, 82], were questioned by a paper reporting 
the opposite behavior of some miRNAs in MM 
tissue [83]. Ivanov and co-workers suggested 
that miR-31 could serve as a prognostic factor 
because its loss in vitro had a pro-tumorigenic 
effect on MM cell lines [84]. The first studies 
shifting the search for deregulated miRNAs 
from tissues to the circulation were conducted 
by Santarelli et al. [85] and Tomasetti et al. 
[86]. Whereas the former work examined tissue 
profiling and validated the clinical significance 
of miR-126 in sera from MM patients, the latter 
paper suggested that circulating miR-126 is a 
sensitive disease marker that should however 
be used in combination with other biomarkers, 
such as mesothelin, to increase specificity [86].
• 
Profiling of circulating miRNAs in MM patients. 
Circulating miRNAs are promising candidates 
for the development of non-invasive techniques 
for early cancer detection/diagnosis. A new 
approach, based on the evidence that tumors 
generate a characteristic miRNA fingerprint 
in the cellular fraction of peripheral blood 
[87], has shown that miR-103 levels were able 
to discriminate MM patients from asbestos-
exposed subjects and healthy controls [88]. 
Combining miR-103 (miR-103a-3p according 
to the upgraded nomenclature) with mesothelin 
has improved diagnostic performance [89]. 
The first miRNA profiling study in plasma/
serum was reported by Kirschner et al., who 
demonstrated that miR-625-3p levels showed 
fairly high specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity 
in 
differentiating 
MM 
from 
asbestosis 
patients [90]. Finally, the most recent study 
has identified two different serum miRNA 
signatures correlating respectively with MM 
histological subtype and clinical outcome [91].
Single-miRNA expression and functional analyses
Several investigations have addressed individual 
miRNAs. Fassina and colleagues studied the modulation 
of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and found that 
miR-205 downregulation correlates with the mesenchymal 
phenotype and with a more aggressive disease [92]. A 
study of MM cell lines examining the overexpression 
of the EZH2 gene, which encodes core components of 
polycomb repressor complex-2 (PRC-2), involved in the 
pathogenesis of different cancers, found low expression 
of its mRNA regulators, miR-101 and miR-26 [93]. 
Analysis of the combined expression of miR-15 and 
miR-16 documented their significant downregulation 
and tumor-suppressing function in MM compared with 
normal mesothelium; moreover, their forced expression 
appeared to be related to inhibition of proliferation [94]. 
It has also been reported that miR-23a and miR-27a 
modulation in MM induce silencing of ZIC1, a potential 
tumor suppressor gene involved in apoptosis [95]. The 
PVT1 locus is another oncogene acting as a non-coding 
RNA through different, alternatively spliced isoforms. Its 
frequent copy number gain in MM cell lines, combined 
with miR-1204 depletion at the same locus, promotes 
overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes and the malignant 
phenotype [96]. Significant miR-31 downregulation has 
been reported in MM macro-dissected tissue vs. reactive 
mesothelial proliferations, whereas miR-31 upregulation is 
 Oncotarget
58610
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
significantly associated with a worse prognosis in patients 
with sarcomatoid MM [97]. Down-regulated miR-223 
expression has been reported to modulate STMN1, which 
has an important role in microtubule dynamics; both are 
involved in the JNK signaling pathway [98]. Comparison 
of miR-192, miR-193a-3p, and miR-200 family expression 
in normal pleura and MM specimens has highlighted a 
significant reduction in miR-192 and miR-193a-3p in MM 
tissue. Finally, restoration of miR-193a-3p levels has been 
reported to inhibit MM cell growth and xenograft tumors 
in vivo [99].
MiRNAs and epigenetic modifications
Similar to protein-coding genes, miRNA-encoding 
genes are also affected by epigenetic changes. DNA 
methylation status is commonly altered in tumor cells, 
and significant mesothelioma modulation has been 
associated with exposure to carcinogens like tobacco, 
nickel, and asbestos [100]. An aberrant methylation status 
and silencing of miR-34b and miR-34c has also been 
described in MM specimens [101]. Extensive functional 
investigation of miR-34b/c activity has suggested that 
downregulation of miR-34 family members induces 
proliferation and invasion of human mesothelial cells, 
thus playing an important role in carcinogenesis [102]. 
Preclinical evaluation of adenovirus-mediated miR-
34b/c gene therapy has shown promise in the treatment 
of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) [103]. The 
therapeutic approach based on miR-34 family members 
promotes radiation-induced apoptosis [104] also in 
epithelial MM cells [105]. A digital real-time methylation-
specific PCR assay, developed by Muraoka’s group to 
quantify miR-34b/c methylation in serum-circulating 
DNA, suggests the association of this family with MPM; 
the approach could be the basis for a new detection system 
[106].
Functional studies without expression analyses
Studies that do not provide miRNA quantification 
may nonetheless have potential translational importance, 
and were included in the present review, to provide a more 
exhaustive picture. Treatment of MM cell lines with the 
chemotherapeutic agent ranpirnase (Onconase(R)) induced 
miR-17* upregulation and miR-30c downregulation; this 
indicates that these miRNAs have anti-tumor activity, 
as also confirmed by downregulation of NF-kB and 
downstream targets [107, 108]. Let-7 family expression 
appears to be induced by activation of EphrinA1, the 
ligand of Ephrin type-A receptor, which suppresses 
MM cell growth by targeting the RAS proto-oncogene 
[109]. A recent paper has confirmed the hypothesis that 
miR-126 affects mitochondrial energy metabolism, and 
that its upregulation via oxidative stress induces MM 
tumor suppression [110]. Finally, assessment of miRNA 
expression profiles in a panel of drug-sensitive and 
drug-resistant MM cell lines, to explore new therapeutic 
options, has recently suggested a correlation between the 
miR-379/411 cluster and drug resistance. MiR-379 and 
miR-411 have been seen to promote invasion and drug 
resistance by direct targeting of IL-18 in MPM cell lines 
[111].
Role of SV40 miRNAs in MM
The first demonstration of a connection between 
human MM and SV40 was the discovery of SV40-
like DNA sequences in MM specimens, though not in 
matching lung samples, from individuals contaminated 
exclusively by asbestos [112]. Asbestos and SV40 can act 
independently or as cofactors in tumor development [24, 
112]. Similarly, expression of the SV40 large-T antigen 
has been demonstrated in mesothelioma, but not in 
surrounding lung parenchyma [112]. SV40 large-T antigen 
complexes with p53 and leads to activation of insulin-like 
growth factor-I promoter and eventually to stimulation of 
malignant mesothelial cell growth [113-115].
SV40 encodes a long antisense RNA, the miR-S1 
stem-loop, which leads to production of two miRNAs, 
sv40-miR-S1-5p and sv40-miR-S1-3p. In late infection 
stages, these miRNAs target and cleave early viral 
mRNA, reducing the expression of SV40-T antigens 
Figure 1: Alignment of sv40-miR-S1-3p to human miR-1266-3p. Search parameters: Sequence ID: MIMAT0003345 (sv40-miR-

100; word size: 4; match score: +5; mismatch penalty: 4.

without reducing the production of infectious virus [116]. 
Cells infected with wild-type SV40 virus, unlike those 
infected with a mutant SV40 virus lacking miRNAs, are 
less sensitive to lysis by cytotoxic T cells, and because 
they exploit the miRNA pathway [117]. Polyomavirus 
strains with severely attenuated miRNA expression arise 
infrequently in vivo, and loss of viral miRNAs can occur 
in conditions of immune suppression [118]. Significantly, 
such autoregulation of gene expression is conserved in 
several polyomaviruses, and it is conceivable that viral 
miRNAs may target multiple host genes besides own 
transcripts. This would be even likelier if viral miRNAs 
had similar sequences to host miRNAs. We examined 
this possibility by comparing SV40-encoded miRNAs 
to the entire database of human miRNAs using sequence 
alignment. Surprisingly, sv40-miR-S1-3p showed a high 
level of similarity to human miR-1266-3p, as shown in 
Figure 1. Deregulation of mir-1266 gene family miRNAs 
has been related to recurrence and metastasis in patients 
with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer [119], gastric 
cancer growth and invasion [120], and psoriasis vulgaris 
[121].
A RT-PCR study of SV40-encoded miRNAs in 
MM tissue specimens failed to detect viral miRNAs 
[122]. The authors reported that SV40 miRNAs do not 
contribute to MM tumorigenesis; however, the patients’ 
unknown SV40 virus infection status does not allow to 
draw this conclusion. Indeed, the presence and expression 
of SV40 in MM [123] and the absence of SV40-like DNA 
sequences in patients not exposed to the virus [124] have 
been reported by several groups. SV40 may actually 
contribute to the development of those MM forms that 
are not due to asbestos exposure, and facilitate asbestos-
mediated carcinogenicity [125].
Identification of miRNA signatures in MM and 
asbestos exposure
This brief overview documents that a multitude of 
miRNAs are differentially expressed in specimens from 
MM, asbestos-exposed, and healthy subjects.
Whereas identifying signatures with clinical 
relevance requires experimental validation, individual 
asbestos-related and MM-related miRNAs are likely to 
be consistently reported in different papers. A logical 
approach to distinguishing relevant from spurious 
miRNAs is therefore to focus on those described more 
frequently. Accordingly, the traditional vote-counting 
method (see under 5.3. Vote-counting methods) was 
applied to all the miRNAs that have been reported to be 
deregulated in the 30 studies selected by our literature 
search. We found that the most frequently reported 
miRNAs had been described in 5 and 4 papers, and listed 
them in Table 1; all the 213 identified including the others, 
which had been reported in 3, 2, or 1 study, are listed in 
Supplementary Table 1. In the two tables, up- and down-
regulated miRNAs are marked by arrows pointing up and

down, whereas deregulated miRNAs, i.e. those for which 
no consistent direction has been described, those found to 
be deregulated in different MM histotypes, and those for 
which the relevant paper provided insufficient data, are 
accompanied by a horizontal arrow. MiRNAs could not be 
ranked by the number of samples in which they had been 
found or by average fold changes, because most papers did 
not provide this information.
In most cases, miRNAs from the same sample 
type shared the same direction of deregulation; notably, 
miR-101-3p, miR-15b-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-192, and 
miR-195-5p were consistently found to be down-
regulated in all sample types. Other miRNAs exhibited an 
inconsistent expression, possibly in relation to different 
types of assays, storage methods, or biopsy collection; for 
example, laser capture micro-dissected (LCM) tissue may 
show a different miRNA deregulation profile compared 
with a conventional biopsy, due to less interference from 
surrounding normal tissue. Moreover, although some 
works have examined the potential of some miRNAs to 
differentiate among MM histotypes and to distinguish MM 
from lung carcinoma, data were insufficient for statistical

analysis.
The traditional vote-counting approach highlighted 
huge expression discrepancies that failed to identify 
miRNA signatures that could distinguish specimens from 
MM or asbestos-exposed subjects from those of control 
individuals. The high variability among studies may be a 
contributing factor, since the MM samples included fresh/
frozen biopsy tissue; formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
(FFPE) tissue; LCM tissue; macro-dissected tissue; tissue 
collected after treatment; plasma, serum, and blood cell 
fraction, and cell lines. Control samples also differed 
widely and included FFPE biopsies of healthy pleura, 
patient-matched non-neoplastic pleura, pericardium, lung, 
healthy lung tissue from asbestos-exposed subjects, tissue 
from a range of cancers, non-neoplastic proliferations, 
plasma/serum from healthy or exposed subjects, blood 
cell fraction of healthy/exposed subjects, immortalized 
cell lines, and normal human mesothelial cell cultures. 
Moreover, some studies comparing MM histotypes did 
not include a control group of normal samples. MiRNA 
quantification approaches also differed widely and 
included real-time quantitative PCR, qRT-PCR array, 
microarray, in situ hybridization-based assays, and 
variants thereof. Different platforms, statistics, qRT-PCR 
normalization methods, validation approaches, sample 
sizes, and other differences further hampered comparisons 
and reproducibility of miRNAs among studies. In addition, 
different criteria may have been applied in the different 
studies to evaluate exposed and non-exposed patients, 
leading to contrasting results. For instance, the widely 
different quality of data provided by functional evidence 
and patient reports of asbestos exposure clearly result 
in formation of groups that are not strictly comparable. 
Altogether, these variables are the cause of the numerous 
inconsistencies (Supplementary Table 2). 
The suspicion that some of the deregulated miRNAs 
identified by the traditional vote count might be false 
positives prompted us to try to identify those having 
a key role in MM pathogenesis and asbestos-related 
malignancies.
Finding MM-associated miRNAs
To identify a miRNA signature for early diagnosis, 
the background noise was reduced by including only 
qRT-PCR-validated miRNAs obtained by comparison 
categories (a) MM tissue vs. normal or non-cancer tissue, 
and (c) MM blood samples vs. normal blood samples. 
A qualitative meta-analysis was conducted to 
improve the results of the traditional vote-count, miRNA 
values were then calculated, and a box-whisker plot 
was used to represent quartile subdivision and miRNA 
distribution in tissues and blood samples (Figure 2). The 
miRNAs found in Max and Q3 were considered the most 
useful in distinguishing MM from healthy or asbestos-
exposed subjects.
The method identified 9 miRNAs, i.e. miR-145-
5p, miR-126-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-192-5p, miR-193a-3p, 
miR-200b-3p, miR-203-3p, miR-143-3p and miR-652-
3p, as the most significant miRNAs in tissue (Figure 2). 
All 9 are down-regulated in MM compared with healthy 
subjects (Table 2); their downregulation in MM tissue was 
confirmed by more than one qRT-PCR series, as detailed 
in Supplementary Methods. Moreover, miR-145, miR-
126, and miR-16-5p are reported in two different papers, 
and miR-192, miR-193a-3p, miR-200b, and miR-203 
are included in the most numerous pool of MM samples 
(>100) analyzed to date (Table 2). A signature including 
these 9 miRNAs could thus have clinical relevance for 
MM.
Despite the small number of studies investigating 
circulating miRNAs, the large number of samples 
analyzed and of qRT-PCRs performed involved that 
several circulating miRNAs were found in Max and Q3 
(Figure 2). In Max, miR-126-3p was described in two 
consecutive studies of MPM plasma and serum [85, 86], 
whereas miR-103a-3p was identified in the blood cellular 
fraction from MPM patients [88, 89]. Moreover, miR-625-
3p upregulation was confirmed in multiple-step analysis of 
plasma and serum with low-level hemolysis [90].
The most significant tissue and circulating miRNAs 
identified here could have clinical relevance and could be 
specifically involved in the pathogenetic process triggered 
by asbestos exposure.
Assessment of the diagnostic potential of tissue and 
circulating MM miRNAs
Since miRNAs are abnormally expressed in several 
cancers and pathophysiological conditions, it is useful to 
establish whether promising miRNAs are MM-specific 
or are also found in other conditions. The 41 qRT-PCR-
validated miRNAs, consisting of 26 miRNAs validated in 
tissues, 9 in blood and 6 miRNAs in both kind of samples 
(Table 2), were thus compared with those most frequently 
reported as biomarkers in other cancers and in subjects 
exposed to environmental pollution.
First, we compared the MM tissue miRNAs to those 
reported by Nymark et al. in the sole miRNA profiling 
study retrieved by our search, which compared lung cancer 
and corresponding normal tissue from subjects with a 
history of high asbestos exposure vs. non-exposed patients 
and control (non-neoplastic) lung tissue specimens [70]. 
The authors found 13 novel miRNAs and divided them 
into 3 sets: “lung cancer miRNAs”, “asbestos-related 
lung cancer miRNAs”, and “early carcinogenesis-related 
miRNAs”. Their comparison with our MM tissue miRNAs 
(Venn diagram in Figure 3) highlighted some common 
miRNAs. However, based on the direction of deregulation, 
there were only 3 miRNAs shared by “lung cancer 
miRNAs” and “asbestos-related lung cancer” (miR-202 
and miR-605, down-regulated, and miR-96, up-regulated); 
 Oncotarget
58616
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
3 down-regulated miRNAs shared by “MM miRNAs” and 
“early carcinogenesis-related miRNAs” (miR-15b, miR-
195 and miR-223); and down-regulated miR-145 in “MM 
miRNAs” and “lung cancer-related miRNAs”.
The same MM miRNAs were then compared with 
those most frequently described in lung cancer tissue 
[126-128] and in tissues from other cancers including 
glioblastoma, head and neck, breast, liver, gastric, 
pancreatic, cervical, ovarian, prostatic, colorectal (CRC), 
and bladder cancer [128]. The Venn diagram reported in 
Figure 4 shows consistent downregulation of miR-126, 
miR-145, and miR-195, thus confirming their involvement 
in the cancer phenotype also based on their detection at 
other sites besides lung: miR-126, gastric and prostate 
cancer; miR-145, breast and bladder cancer; and miR-
195, bladder cancer. Moreover, miR-143 and miR-32 are 
down-regulated both in lung cancer and MM. MiRNAs 
shared by MM and other cancers include the following 
down-regulated miRNAs: miR-31 (gastric, prostate, 
bladder, head and neck cancer, CRC); miR-34b (breast 
cancer), miR-193a-3p (CRC), miR-200b (ovarian cancer), 
and miR-203 (pancreatic, cervical and prostate cancer). 
MiR-221 (gastric, cervical, and prostate cancer and 
glioblastoma) is the sole shared up-regulated miRNA. 
Since several other candidate biomarkers were shared by 
lung and other cancers and showed the same trend, they 
are all likely to play a role in the molecular pathways that 
are disrupted in cancer. Moreover, given the different 
sites of the malignancies, the cross-check suggested a 
biomarker role for most of them (Figure 4).
Secondly, to establish the diagnostic potential 
and specificity of the circulating miRNAs, these were 
checked against i) the circulating miRNA biomarkers most 
frequently reported in a variety of conditions, including a 
pool of different cancers that are particularly enriched in 
lung cancer miRNAs [127-129], and ii) the deregulated 
miRNAs associated with personal or environmental 
exposure to noxious stimuli including cigarette smoking, 
chemicals, and polluted air [64]. The results of this 
comparison, reported in Figure 5, demonstrate that 
relatively few miRNAs can be considered as common 
biomarkers of MM, pollution, and cancer. Based on the 
direction of deregulation, only miR-126 and miR-223 
are shared by all sets. MiR-126 has been described as 
a diagnostic marker in non-small cell lung carcinoma 
(NSCLC) [127] and, interestingly, it is down-regulated 
in leukocytes exposed to particulate matter, black carbon, 
organic carbon, and sulfate ions (SO4
2-) [64]. Low miR-223 
levels are found in subjects exposed to tobacco smoke and 
in those with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [64], sepsis 
[129], prostate cancer, and leukemia [128]. MiR-103 and 
miR-191 are down-regulated common miRNAs in MM 
and in serum from NSCLC patients vs. healthy smokers, 
whereas miR-20a is down-regulated in plasma from lung 
cancer surgery patients vs. healthy controls [127]. MiR-
25 is up-regulated in breast, liver, bladder [128], and 
lung cancer [129]; miR-29a in CRC, ovarian [128,129], 
breast cancer [128], and NSCLC [127], and miR-92a in 
CRC, ovarian, prostate, and liver cancer [128,129]. MiR-
26b is up-regulated in MM and in a miRNA pool related 
to pollution exposure, and shows expression changes in 
cord blood due to arsenic exposure [64]. Several miRNAs 
were seen to be shared by pollution exposure and cancer 
patients, but considering that many cancers are related 
to pollution the finding is not unexpected. Finally, to test 
whether our pool of circulating MM miRNAs are tumor-
specific or commonly detected in the circulation, the MM 
miRNAs were checked against the circulating miRNAs 
described most frequently in healthy individuals [129]. 
The diagram in Figure 6 documents that 9/15 circulating 
MM miRNAs are commonly found in healthy individuals, 
but are deregulated in MM, whereas 6/15 include up-
regulated miR-625-3p and 5 other miRNAs that are found 
exclusively in the MM set.
Functional and statistical evaluation of the most 
significant circulating MM miRNAs
To identify the most significant circulating 
MM miRNAs with the strongest diagnostic potential 
and function, we queried the miRandola database, a 
comprehensive, manually curated classification of 
extracellular circulating miRNAs [130, 131], where 
cell-free miRNAs are divided into four carrier-based 
categories: miRNA-Ago2, miRNA-exosome, miRNA-
HDL, and when the specific carrier is unknown, miRNA-
circulating [130, 131]. Moreover, the miRNAexpress tool 
in miRandola provides a systematic comparison of the 
expression profiles of cellular and extracellular miRNAs 
[130, 131] and allows identification of the miRNAs that 
are specifically expressed in tissue/cells, those unique 
to the circulation, and those shared by cells and the 
circulation. The MiRandola and miRNAexpress outputs 
for miR-103a-3p, miR-126-3p, miR-29c-5p, miR-92a-
3p, and miR-625-3p are reported in Table 3, where the 
sample types investigated, the carrier identified, any 
validated targets, the biomarker value in other diseases, 
and miRNAexpress data are reported for each miRNA.
Since accuracy estimates were reported for miR-
103a-3p, miR-126-3p, and miR-625-3p from the original 
studies, forest plots for sensitivities (Figure 7A) and 
specificities (Figure 7B) were drawn to obtain a general 
overview of the accuracy estimates for the three miRNAs, 
mesothelin and their combination. As we found significant 
heterogeneity between studies, the random effects 
model was applied. The SROC curve for the biomarkers 
investigated was shown in Figure 7C. The pooled area 
under curve (AUC) of SROC was 0.8563, suggesting 
promising accuracy for circulating miRNA in diagnosing 
MM.
Table 4 also shows the pooled results for diagnostic

accuracy in different subgroups. Similar results are 
observed in the diagnosis of MM using different reference 
groups (healthy subjects or asbestos exposed subjects). 
However, subgroup analysis based on the combination of 
miRNA and mesothelin (i.e. miR-103a-3p and mesothelin 
in Table 4) suggested that a multiple-biomarkers assay 
showed superior diagnostic properties than assay based 
on mesothelin alone or single miRNAs for MM detection 
in both general population and asbestos exposed subjects.

occupational and/or environmental asbestos exposure 
would have huge implications, especially considering 
that MM diagnosis is invasive and that there is still no 
effective cure. However, despite intense research efforts 
under way in several laboratories, finding consistency is 
hampered by differences in miRNA profiling methods 
and in the technological approaches adopted. As a result, 
the identification of minimally invasive, inexpensive 
diagnostic/prognostic tests for MM is still elusive. Given 
that, profiling studies provide a myriad miRNAs, many of 
which may have no clinical relevance, a meta-analysis of 
miRNA datasets would yield important findings [75].
To our knowledge a meta-analysis of miRNAs 
related to asbestos exposure and MM has never been 
performed, despite the value of secondary data analysis 
in highlighting high-quality evidence and in providing 
guidance when experimental studies disagree. Data 
extrapolation is a crucial phase of systematic research, and 
including comparable numerical values is a precondition 
for a meta-analysis. The paucity of online-available raw 
datasets on MM miRNA expression made it impossible 
to apply a broad statistical approach to the data provided 
by the literature search. Only a few of the 39 papers 
retrieved by our search were based on extensive profiling

cancers. A. Venn diagram comparing tissue MM miRNAs and three pools of miRNAs identified by Nymark et al. [70]: 13 novel “lung

and even fewer provided raw datasets. To address this key 
limitation, we felt that the most rational and transparent 
approach would be apply a vote-counting strategy. Yet, 
after the traditional vote-counting approach yielded 
a highly heterogeneous pool of 214 miRNAs (due to 
the broad diversity of asbestos-related malignancies, 
analytical methods, and study designs), it became apparent 
that handling such a vast dataset would require a more 
refined approach. However, its overview provided two 
important pieces of information: i) that most MM miRNAs 
were down-regulated compared with the respective control 
groups (Supplementary Table 1); and ii) that miRNA 
expression in blood samples and biopsies showed a certain 
consistency, whereas expression in cell lines largely 
differed from tissue data (Table 1 and Supplementary 
Table 1). This suggests that the use of cell line data should 
be confined to functional assays. Numerous miRNAs were 
found to be deregulated in more than one study. Even

though some did not show a clear trend (Table 1), they 
are nonetheless likely to be involved in the disruption of 
key ARD and MM pathways. It will be the task of future 
functional studies to clarify their role and influence.
To pare down the 213-strong pool and exclude 
spurious miRNAs, only high-confidence miRNAs 
validated by qRT-PCR were retained and subjected to 
further analysis. This reduced the candidate pool to a 
dataset of 41 MM-related miRNAs (Table 2) that could 
then be used as starting points to discover upstream and 
downstream molecules involved in MM pathogenesis. 
Next, to enable more accurate data assessment, a 
qualitative meta-analysis of the miRNA pool was 
conducted by applying an ad hoc devised vote-counting 
strategy. This approach is based on a scoring method 
that took into account the direction of deregulation and 
four selected features: i) the number of qRT-PCR assays 
conducted to assess each miRNA; ii) the total number 
of MM samples, iii) the total number of normal samples 
used; and iv) the number of studies reporting each miRNA

as deregulated. The circulating and tissue miRNAs thus 
identified therefore had a highly probable biomarker 
value and deserve further investigation as “mesomiRs” 
(mesothelioma-associated miRNAs).
Tissue MM miRNA signature
Examination of the 41-miRNA dataset clearly 
demonstrated a general trend toward downregulation 
of tissue miRNAs (Table 2), confirming the hypothesis 
that the miRNAs showing significant underexpression 
in cancer tissue may have a tumor suppressing function, 
whereas those that are up-regulated may be tumor 
promoters (oncomiRs) [132, 133]. The hypothesis is 
also supported by reports of the identification of several 
tumor-suppressing miRNAs and oncomiRs through their 
modulation of gene expression [134-136]. Moreover, since 
MM is characterized by chromosome instability (i.e. 1p36,

9p21, 3p, 4q, 6q, 14q32, 17p13, and 22q12 deletions), and 
instability has been related to underexpression of tumor 
suppressor genes [100, 137, 138], the miRNAs targeting 
them are also conceivably candidate biomarkers for MM. 
In contrast, chromosome gains have been reported at 1q, 
5p15, 7p12, 8q24 and 17q [137, 138]. Several significant 
miRNAs identified in our study map to the above loci 
or to fragile genomic regions (Table 2), and might be 
down- or up-regulated due to accumulation of acquired 
chromosomal losses or gains and other copy number 
changes.
The downregulation of miR-145-5p, miR-143-
3p, miR-126-3p, miR-652-3p, and miR-16-5p, and 
the upregulation of miR-625-3p, highlighted by the 
qualitative meta-analysis, agree with the chromosomal 
instability and epigenetic modifications described in MM. 
MiR-145 showed the highest score (Figure 2), and its 
downregulation in MM and other lung cancers could be 
explained by its role in carcinogenesis. The miR-145 and 
the miR-143 family are clustered miRNAs involved in p53 
downstream regulation [77]. Both map to the 5q32 locus, 
which is prone to hypermethylation in mesothelioma and 
mesothelioma cell lines [76]. The hypermethylation of this 
locus probably accounts for their low expression found in 
MM samples.
MiR-126-3p, miR-625-3p, and miR-16-5p map 
respectively to loci 9q34.3, 14q23.3, and 13q14.2, which 
are prone to deletion and copy number changes [139-141]. 
Downregulation of the miR-15 family has been described 
in other solid tumors like lung, colon, ovary, and prostate, 
and the gene locus has been shown to be deleted in more 
than half of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs) 
[60, 77]; in the latter, the miR-15a/16-1 cluster targets 
the oncogene BCL2 and functions as a tumor suppressor 
[142]. MiR-126-3p tends to be affected in any disease 
causing micro- or macro-vascular damage, inflammation,

and aging [52, 53, 143]. The most recent findings suggest 
a role for it in regulating the amino acid transporter LAT1 
in MM cells [77]. A key role for it in controlling oxidative 
stress in MM has also been proposed, and would be in line 
with the suppression of miR-126-3p seen in MM patients 
[110]. Further work is needed to elucidate the biological 
roles of miR-625-3p and miR-652-3p in carcinogenesis.
Besides 
chromosome 
instability, 
miRNA 
downregulation could also be explained by two key 
features of MM tumors: the hypoxic phenotype and the 
high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
[144]. In the cytoplasm, precursor miRNAs are cleaved by 
the ribonuclease Dicer to their mature length and are then 
loaded on Ago2 proteins; formation of the RISC complex 
leads to achievement of their functional form. In hypoxic 
conditions EGFR is internalized into intracellular vesicles, 
where it phosphorylates cytoplasmic Ago2, reducing 
precursor binding to Dicer, hence the number of mature 
miRNAs [144].
Moreover, analysis of the miRNAs found in Q2 
disclosed interesting links with those in Max and Q3. 
Downregulation of miR-15a-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-
195-5p has been reported by a study of more than 50 MM 
samples; significantly, all these miRNAs belong to the 
same gene family or to clustered miRNAs, such as miR-16-
5p. Since only one study has described miRNA behavior 
in asbestos-related lung cancers [70], it is impossible to 
draw any conclusions, but the finding that miR-15b and 
miR-195 are related to early carcinogenesis in asbestos-
exposed subjects (Figure 3) adds to the relevance of the 
miR-15 family. Interestingly, the phase I MesomiR I 
trial has found considerable metabolic and radiological 
response in a MPM patient using a novel targeted miRNA-
based treatment based on delivery vehicles packaged with 
miR-16-based mimics (denominated TargomiRs) [145]. 
Though preliminary, these preclinical data are promising 
and confirm that miRNA mimics and anti-miRs may be 
able to restore gene networks.
Methylation-induced silencing has been shown by 
various functional studies to induce downregulation of 
clustered miR-34b and miR-34c [103-106, 146]. Several 
other validated miRNAs belong to clusters or to the same 
family, i.e. most of mir-1, mir-17, mir-25, mir-26, mir-
29 family members, and share similar expression trends. 
These findings confirm the involvement of all these 
miRNAs in the cancer phenotype and their key role in 
derailed pathways.
Assessment of the diagnostic potential of the most 
significant tissue miRNAs (Figure 4) disclosed that the 
“MM”, “lung cancer” and “other cancers” sets share only 
3 miRNAs. Few other candidate MM biomarkers are 
shared by “lung cancer” or “other cancers”, but the strong 
disparity at the sites of onset of the relevant malignancies 
makes them discriminating for MM.
The qualitative meta-analysis, conducted with 
a specially devised vote-counting method, identified 
miRNAs with close relevance to asbestos-related 
carcinogenesis. It has recently been suggested that a 
four-miRNA classifier (miR-126-3p, miR-143-3p, miR-
145-5p, miR-652-3p) can be applied to differentiate MM 
from non-neoplastic tissue samples with sensitivity and 
specificity [77]. It is reasonable to hypothesize that its 
performance could be improved by adding the five tissue 
miRNAs identified by our qualitative meta-analysis - miR-
16-5p, miR-192-5p, miR-193a-3p, miR-200b-3p, and 
miR-203a-3p - thus giving rise to an MM-miR signature. 
Analysis of all nine miRNAs might provide more accurate 
diagnostic information, and conceivably even divide 
patients based on relative miRNA expression and rate of 
cancer progression. The hypothesis that multiple miRNAs 
might be more accurate is supported by the polyclonal 
nature of MM and other ARDs, since the carcinogenic 
effect of mineral fibers involves that multiple cells 
undergo malignant transformation, and each clone may 
develop and expand its own distinctive set of molecular 
alterations [147].
Circulating miRNAs as biomarkers in MM and 
asbestos-exposed patients
Circulating miRNAs are ideal biomarkers since they 
are non-invasive, stable, they vary little in the general 
population, and are not expensive to analyze.
The five circulating miRNAs found by our 
qualitative meta-analysis include four detected in plasma/
serum - miR-126-3p, miR-29c-5p, miR-92a-3p and 
miR-625-3p - and one - miR-103a-3p - detected in the 
cellular fraction of peripheral blood (Figure 2). Numerous 
circulating miRNAs showing clinically significant 
properties have also been detected in patients with 
several different conditions and in individuals exposed to 
environmental pollutants. To test the diagnostic potential 
and specificity of miR-126-3p, miR-29c-5p, miR-
92a-3p, miR-625-3p, and miR-103a-3p, we compared 
three circulating miRNA sets -“MM-related miRNAs”, 
“cancer-related miRNAs”, and “miRNAs related to 
pollution exposure” (Figure 5) - and found that miR-126 
downregulation is shared by all three sets. Even though its 
downregulation has been reported in NSCLC compared 
with healthy smokers/healthy controls [127], miR-126 is 
significantly more down-regulated in MM than in NSCLC 
patients/healthy controls, and can also stratify MM 
patients by length of survival [86].
In the “pollution exposure” set, miR-126 
downregulation has been detected in leukocytes as an 
effect of particulate matter, black carbon, organic carbon, 
and SO4
2- [64]; the latter ions are found in the atmosphere 
as aerosols produced by fossil fuel and biomass 
combustion. A similar trend of downregulation is induced 
by mineral fibers and particulate matter containing 
asbestos.
 Oncotarget

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
Down-regulated miR-103 is shared by “MM-related 
miRNAs” and “cancer-related miRNAs”, but the different 
type of specimens analyzed (respectively cellular fraction 
of peripheral blood and serum) makes it unique to MM 
(Figure 5).
Although experimental data suggest that miRNAs 
released into body fluids do not necessarily reflect their 
abundance in the cell of origin [130], we also tested 
whether our pool of circulating MM miRNAs are tumor-
specific or else they are miRNAs commonly detected in 
the circulation. We thus compared the fifteen circulating 
MM miRNAs with those commonly found in healthy 
individuals. The Venn diagram in Figure 6 shows that 
nine commonly detected miRNAs are instead down-
regulated in MM, and include miR-103 and miR-126 
(the latter showing the same trend also in tissue). In 
contrast, six miRNAs, including up-regulated miR-625-
3p and miR-29c-5p, are specific of the MM set. MiR-
29c-5p has prognostic value, since higher expression is 
associated with a favorable prognosis in MM patients [74], 
reinforcing its value as a candidate MM biomarker.
Interestingly, some miRNAs that are deregulated 
in tissue from MM as well as from asbestos-exposed 
individuals, i.e. miR-15b, miR-16, miR-192, miR-26a, and 
miR-32, belong to the group of physiological circulating 
miRNAs, but they have never been analyzed in plasma/
serum from MM patients. In contrast, low miR-16 has 
been detected in the cellular fraction of peripheral blood 
from asbestos-exposed individuals (Supplementary Table 
1) [88].
Since convincing evidence has highlighted that 
Ago proteins, HDL, and exosomes transport and deliver 
miRNAs to recipient cells having different regulatory 
requirements, we also investigated the specific carriers 
of circulating MM miRNAs, hypothesizing that vesicle-, 
Ago2-, and HDL-associated miRNAs may originate from 
cells reflecting cell type-specific expression and release 
mechanisms. A MiRandola interrogation demonstrated that 
in plasma and serum miR-126-3p is mainly associated with 
exosomes (Table 3). Tumor-derived exosomes function as 
shuttles in the cross-talk between tumor microenvironment 
and distant cell targets. OncomiRs are actively secreted 
by cancer cells and promote tumor formation and 
progression by acting on extracellular matrix remodeling, 
inducing angiogenesis, and regulating stromal cells 
and stem cell niches [66, 148]. MiR-126-3p has tumor-
suppressing functions [149], and its loss promotes tumor 
cell formation, migration, and invasion, and prevents anti-
tumor immune response. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 
1 (VCAM1) is a validated target of miR-126-3p (Table 3). 
VCAM1 is important in cell-cell recognition, it appears to 
function in leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion and signal 
transduction, and may play a pathophysiological role 
both in the immune response and in leukocyte migration 
to the sites of inflammation. Response reprogramming 
involves active transfer of exosomal miRNAs between 
immune cells [150]. Notably, the findings that miR-
126-3p tends to be up-regulated in other cancers (Table 
3) and that exosome-derived miRNAs share the miRNA 
profile of their tissue of origin [151] confirm its potential 
biomarker value in MM. Vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) is another specific target of miR-126-
3p [152]. Its upregulation plays a critical role in tumor 
progression [153] and inversely proportional levels of 
VEGF-miR-126-3p are found in blood from MPM patients 
[85]. Given its tumor-suppressing functions, miR-126-3p 
is also a potential therapeutic target in MM. Moreover, 
re-expression of miR-126 reduced tumor cell migration 
and invasion in colon cancer [154], and both mature forms 
of mir-126 hindered metastasis progression by reducing 
inflammatory monocyte and mesenchymal stem cell 
recruitment to the site of the primary tumors [155].
After a study of ovarian cancer specimens [87] 
suggested that all neoplasms may generate a unique 
miRNA fingerprint in the peripheral blood cell fraction, 
a similar investigation of samples from MM patients 
proposed a biomarker role for miR-103a-3p [88, 89]. Since 
our search retrieved no further studies using this approach, 
the available data are insufficient to judge whether miRNA 
fingerprints in the peripheral blood cell fraction reflect a 
cancer-specific or a blood cell-based phenomenon. The 
miRNA profile of the peripheral blood cell fraction is 
likely largely conditioned by endogenous miRNAs of 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Moreover 
T, B, and dendritic immune cells have been shown to 
have a different exosomal miRNA cargo compared with 
their parent cells, due to exosomal cross-talk between 
regulatory RNAs and recipient cells during immune 
synapsis [156]. In this context, low levels of specific 
miRNAs or the genetic alteration of key components in 
miRNA processing can compromise the immune response 
and lead to tumor formation [156]. Examination of the 
characteristics of miR-103a-3p in the miRandola database 
showed that miR-103a-3p is associated with Ago2 proteins 
and exosomes in T cells and dendritic cell samples (Table 
3). Inhalation of asbestos fibers has been found to impair 
immune response and tumor immunity by affecting 
immunocompetent cells [157]. In particular, asbestos 
exposure suppresses human naïve CD8+ lymphocyte 
differentiation into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), 
which recognize and kill non-self target cells [158]. 
Analysis of the number and characteristics of PBMCs 
has demonstrated that their total number is lower in MM 
and asbestos-exposed patients than in healthy individuals, 
and that CD8+ lymphocytes suffer from functional 
impairment both in MM and in asbestos-exposed patients 
[159]. Whereas MM is associated with diminished 
tumor immunity, exposed patients retain an effective 
immune function [159]. These findings are in line with 
the downregulation of miR-103a-3p described in MM 
patients. Our miRandola analysis identified some validated 
targets that reinforce these findings (Table 3): i) inducible

does not consider miR-103a-3p as a potential biomarker 
in other diseases; it would be interesting to know whether 
it has a similar behavior in PBMCs and the whole cell 
fraction of peripheral blood, because according to 
previous evidence miR-10b expression in PBMCs can 
discriminate NSCLC patients from healthy subjects with 
high sensitivity and specificity [160]; iv) miR-625-3p is 
carried by HDL and exosomes, and has biomarker value 
in serum from NSCL patients when it is significantly 
down-regulated compared with healthy individuals [161]; 
v) high miR-625-3p levels have been reported in plasma/
serum from MM patients, and miRNAexpress analysis has 
identified it as circulation-specific, whereas miR-126-3p 
and miR-103a-3p are also commonly found in cells; this 
has also been confirmed by a study addressing the impact 
of cellular miRNAs on circulating miRNA biomarkers 
[162]. Although the function and targets of miR-625-3p 
are still unclear, our data identify it as a potentially MM-
specific miRNA; vi), miR-29c-5p is up-regulated both 
in cells and the circulation; according to the miRandola 
database it is predominantly associated with cells; this 
agrees with the finding that it has prognostic potential in 
MM tissue [74], since its level can segregate patients by 
histotype, and higher expression correlates with a more 
favorable prognosis; however its expression in plasma/
serum is less significant [90]; finally vii) miR-92a-3p 
is up-regulated in cells and the circulation; high levels 
have been reported in gastric cancer, CRC, and hepatitis 
C infection, where it has been found to have biomarker 
potential. It is therefore non-specific for MM and asbestos 
exposure and is less significant as a potential MM 
biomarker (Table 3).
MiR-126-3p, miR-103a-3p, miR-29c-5p, miR-92a-
3p, and miR-625-3p are likely released by cancer cells 
via different pathways to serve different functions. The 
hypothesis is supported by the report that they showed 
marked differences in some serum fractions from the same 
individual and between healthy individuals and cancer 
patients [163]. This suggests that miRNA stratification 
in ultracentrifuged samples may reflect their different 
shuttles, and stresses the need for assessing miRNA levels 
in the context of their carriers when trying to discover 
diagnostic biomarkers of cancer.
An MM multimarker signature and future 
prospects
MiR-126-3p, miR-103a-3p, and miR-625-3p have 
provided some interesting results in distinguishing MM 
from healthy or asbestos-exposed patients, whereas 
the diagnostic ability of miR-29c-5p and miR-92a-3p 
requires further evaluation. MiR-126-3p and miR-103a-
3p have demonstrated a sensitivity of 73-80% and 83-
89%, respectively, but their relatively low specificity 
(60-74% and 63-71%, respectively) prevents their clinical 
application as standalone biomarkers [85, 88, 89]. In 
contrast, miR-625-3p has shown a specificity of 78-
90% and a sensitivity of 70-73% (Figure 7A-7B) [90]. 
Several proteins have been proposed as MM biomarkers 
over the past few years. Mesothelin is currently the most 
widely used, thanks to its high specificity (ca. 89%) and 
despite its low sensitivity (58%) [164]. According to 
recent evidence, HMGB1 serum levels and the relative 
levels of its different isoforms (hyper-acetylated and non-
acetylated HMGB1) can distinguish MM patients from 
asbestos-exposed individuals and unexposed controls with 
100% sensitivity and specificity, outperforming existing 
biomarkers (mesothelin, fibulin-3, and osteopontin), 
whereas HMGB1 combined with fibulin-3 improves 
differential diagnosis [13]. Notably, harnessing markers 
from different molecular classes has been shown to 
provide high diagnostic performances in MM. 
To our knowledge, a parallel analysis of miRNAs 
and HMGB1 has never been performed, but combined 
analysis of mesothelin and either miR-126-3p or miR-
103a-3p has improved the specificity and sensitivity of 
each marker alone in distinguishing asbestos-exposed 
from MM patients (Figure 7A-7B-7C) [85, 89]. This 
finding, and the report that a combination of circulating 
miRNAs rather than a single miRNA biomarker increased 
early diagnostic performance [165], suggest that an MM-
multimarker signature including miR-126-3p, miR-103a-
3p, miR-625-3p, and mesothelin would maximize the 
effectiveness of asbestos-exposed patient monitoring for 
early detection of the switch to carcinogenesis. Pooled 
results for diagnostic accuracy of the combination miR-
103a-3p and mesothelin revealed the highest value of 
sensitivity 90% (0.82-0.96), specificity 82.7% (0.74-0.89) 
and DOR 46.65 (18.94-114.9) (Table 4).
Moreover, it would be useful to assess the feasibility 
of using different fractions of whole blood in monitoring 
high-risk patients. In fact, the plasma/serum levels of 
circulating miRNAs may be masked by other miRNAs 
released by hematopoietic cells [162], and differences in 
blood cell counts, sample hemolysis, and cargo discarded 
after cell death are all causes of variations in miRNA 
levels [166, 167]. The problem could be addressed by a 
standard protocol. Simultaneous analysis of miR-103a-3p 
in the cellular fraction and of miR-126-3p, miR-625-3p, 
and mesothelin in plasma/serum from the same sample 
 Oncotarget

in conjunction with blood cell counts and assessment 
of hemolysis might provide such a protocol [166, 167]. 
Assessment of its results would provide solid evidence 
about the value of this approach in early diagnosis, 
and possibly stratification based on pathophysiological 
condition and cancer risk.
CONCLUSIONS
It is believed that the morbidity and mortality 
caused by asbestos exposure will peak in the next decade 
[168]. Minimally invasive monitoring approaches are 
thus urgently needed, both to extend patient lifespan 
and to preserve their quality of life. All published data 
confirm the key importance of miRNAs in MM diagnosis, 
prognosis and treatment, highlighting the need for more 
specific circulating biomarkers of asbestos exposure. The 
method illustrated above is a useful approach to identify 
consistent miRNAs that can be used as MM biomarkers 
when raw data are not available. A recent assessment of 
the value of vote-counting methods has disclosed that the 
number of supporting studies combined with the size of 
the sample tested by RT-qPCR provides sound biomarker 
ranking [169]. The process adopted in our qualitative 
meta-analysis has yielded a reliable list of mesomiRs 
candidates. Large-scale, standardized validation is required 
to establish whether the tissue miRNA meta-signature 
(miR-16-5p, miR-126-3p, miR-143-3p, miR-145-5p, miR-
192-5p, miR-193a-3p, miR-200b-3p, miR-203a-3p, and 
miR-652-3p) and the MM multimarker panel (miR-126-
3p, miR-103a-3p, miR-625-3p, and mesothelin) proposed 
herein are capable of delivering accurate diagnoses and 
identifying high-risk patients (Figure 8). Furthermore, 
formation of exposed and non-exposed groups requires 
accurate assessment of exposure. Computed tomography 
and chest x-rays remain the more sensitive approaches 
to evaluate objective clinical parameters of exposure 
[11, 12, 170]. In the absence of detectable physiological 
changes, exposure intensity should be determined using ad 
hoc questionnaires [171, 172]. Besides their potential as 
clinically relevant biomarkers, the mesomiRs identified are 
a panel of consistently deregulated and highly significant 
molecules that should thoroughly be investigated to assess 
their involvement in the onset and progression of disease 
triggered by mineral fiber exposure. Here, we provide a 
framework and rationale for similar future investigations. 
A greater understanding of the cellular origin of circulating 
miRNAs will pave the way for the use of this exciting new 
class of analytes as cancer biomarkers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature search and screening
The PubMed, GEODataSet [173, 174] and EMBL-
EBI ArrayExpress [175] databases were searched using 
the terms “microRNA”, “mesothelioma”, “asbestos”, 
“asbestosis” and all conceivable combinations of their 
synonyms (last accessed on 29 September 2015). Pre-
established inclusion and exclusion criteria, listed in Table 
5, were applied to screen query outputs.
As shown in the PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 9), 
the search retrieved 80 papers and 39 datasets. Application 
of inclusion/exclusion criteria left 39 articles reporting 
miRNA deregulation in MM. Nine of these papers were 
based essentially on functional assays and were reviewed 
for the sake of completeness; the other 30 studies were 
subjected to a qualitative meta-analysis. The assessment 
of potential biases in the review process is reported in 
Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Table 3 and 
Supplementary Table 4.
Data extraction and ranking
The full text, supplementary material, author, 
year of publication, study design, number of specimens 
investigated, tumor content and histology, methodological 
approach, GEO accession number, and relevant findings 
were extracted from each paper and are listed in 
Supplementary Table 2. The studies described 4 categories 
of comparisons: (a) MM tissue vs. normal or non-cancer 
tissue; (b) MM tissue vs. other cancer tissues; (c) MM 
blood samples vs. normal blood samples; and (d) MM cell 
lines vs. normal cell lines. The 213 miRNAs reported to be 
deregulated in specimens from MM and asbestos-exposed 
subjects compared with control samples were divided 
based on their trend of deregulation, and are reported 
in Supplementary Table 1. The miRNAs that had been 
validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were 
extracted, whereas all the other miRNAs were discarded. 
To narrow down the sample further, data that had been 
obtained by comparing miRNAs found in MM and other 
cancer types (b), data from cell lines (d); data obtained 
from comparison of different MM histotypes; and data 
from studies that did not report clear trend information 
for the miRNAs were excluded. This left only the 41 
qRT-PCR-validated miRNAs that had been obtained by 
comparing (a) MM tissue vs. normal or non-cancer tissue 
and (c) MM blood samples vs. normal blood samples. 
These miRNAs are reported in Table 2 with their unique 
identifier (ID) and accession number, as available. Names 
were standardized according to the latest miRBase release 
(miRBase v21, June 2014 available at http://www.mirbase.
org/) [176-180]. Any ambiguity regarding miRNA identity 
was solved using miRBase Tracker [181]. For each 
miRNA, gene family, clustered miRNAs, and cytogenetic 
locations are also reported.

Vote-counting methods
Data were analyzed by a two-step approach. In the 
first step, a traditional vote-counting method was applied 
to the dataset of all deregulated miRNAs (Supplementary 
Table 1) to extract the miRNAs that had been reported 
most frequently in the largest number of studies and 
comparison categories (a, b, c, d; see under 5.2. Data 
extraction and ranking).
In the second step, a more stringent, specially 
devised vote-counting strategy was applied to the 41 
miRNAs that had been validated by qRT-PCR (Table 2). 
Detailed information about this strategy is reported in 
Supplementary Methods. Results are reported as a box-
whisker plot, where each dot represents a miRNA (Figure 
2). The miRNAs belonging to groups Q3 and Max were 
considered as the most significant. Quartile ranking and 
box-whisker plot were obtained using Microsoft Excel and 
Plotly (https://plot.ly/).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of the most significant circulating 
miRNAs was undertaken utilizing Meta-DiSc 1.4 software 
[182]. The bivariate meta-analysis model was employed 
to summarize the sensitivity, specificity, and generate 
the bivariate summary receiver operator characteristic 
(SROC) curve with their corresponding 95% CIs among 
the studies using circulating miRNAs as biomarker for 
MM diagnosis. Due to high heterogeneity of the dataset, 
data pooling of sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds 
ratio (DOR), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and negative 
likelihood ratio (NLR) was performed in omogeneous 
subgroups defined a priori [182, 183]. Cochran’s Q test 
and inconsistency index (I2) test were employed to trace 
potential sources of study heterogeneity. P < 0.01 for 
Cochran’s Q test, or I2 > 50%, all indicated an existence 
of significant heterogeneity [184]. When significant 
heterogeneity existed for sensitivity and specificity, the 
random effect model was employed.
Bioinformatic 
analysis 
and 
functional 
investigation
The 41 miRNAs that had been validated by qRT-
PCR (Table 2) were cross-checked with the miRNAs 
previously described as biomarkers and/or potential 
biomarkers in multiple pathophysiological conditions and 
in individuals exposed to environmental pollution using 
jvenn, an interactive Venn diagram viewer [185]. Since 
most reports use the earlier nomenclature, the earlier 
miRNA identifiers were used in this comparison, whereas 
the newer identifiers were used where multiple names 
might raise confusion.
As a further confirmation of their role and diagnostic 
potential, the tissue and circulating miRNAs identified 
by the meta-analysis were then checked against the 
miRandola database, a comprehensive manually curated 
classification of different extracellular circulating non-
coding RNAs [130, 131]. Sequence alignment of SV40-
encoded miRNas vs. human miRNAs was performed using 
the BLASTN search algorithm in miRBase (http://www.
mirbase.org/).
