Rifapentine (RPT) is a rifamycin antimycobacterial and, as part of a combination therapy, is indicated for the treatment of pul-
monary tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although the results from a number of studies indicate that
rifapentine has the potential to shorten treatment duration and enhance completion rates compared to other rifamycin agents
utilized in antituberculosis drug regimens (i.e., regimens 1 to 4), its optimal dose and exposure in humans are unknown. To help
inform such an optimization, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to predict time course, tis-
sue-specific concentrations of RPT and its active metabolite, 25-desacetyl rifapentine (dRPT), in humans after specified adminis-
tration schedules for RPT. Starting with the development and verification of a PBPK model for rats, the model was extrapolated
and then tested using human pharmacokinetic data. Testing and verification of the models included comparisons of predictions
to experimental data in several rat tissues and time course RPT and dRPT plasma concentrations in humans from several single-
and repeated-dosing studies. Finally, the model was used to predict RPT concentrations in the lung during the intensive and con-
tinuation phases of a current recommended TB treatment regimen. Based on these results, it is anticipated that the PBPK model
developed in this study will be useful in evaluating dosing regimens for RPT and for characterizing tissue-level doses that could
be predictors of problems related to efficacy or safety.
R
ifapentine (RPT) is a rifamycin-class antibiotic indicated for
the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) caused by My-
cobacterium tuberculosis and in the treatment of latent TB infec-
tion in patients at high risk of progression to TB disease. RPT has
a longer half-life, increased affinity to serum protein binding (1),
and a lower MIC against M. tuberculosis than rifampin, which is
currently used as part of several first-line TB treatment regimens
(2, 3). Moreover, the primary metabolite for RPT, 25-desacetyl
rifapentine (dRPT), has also been found to be active against M.
tuberculosis, although at markedly lower MICs (1, 3, 4). Because of
these characteristics, RPT has been the subject of a number of
clinical pharmacology studies aimed at evaluating pharmacoki-
netics and developing effective therapies (5–15). Although data
from these investigations are valuable in their own right, mathe-
matical modeling offers a way to complement these studies, syn-
thesize their disparate data, and provide the clinician an additional
tool to characterize and predict the absorption, distribution, me-
tabolism, and excretion (ADME) of RPT under dosing conditions
of interest.
One of the very few such mathematical models was developed
by Savic et al. (16), who used a classical compartmental modeling
approach to assess human population pharmacokinetics of both
RPT and dRPT. This model described the absorption, metabo-
lism, and clearance of these two species and accurately predicted
their time course plasma concentrations in healthy volunteers.
Unfortunately, compartmental concentrations in this model were
not directly relatable to those in actual tissues of interest (e.g., the
lung and liver) because the effects of plasma protein binding and
blood-tissue partitioning of the parent drug and metabolite were
not included. Moreover, because the study utilized data from
healthy subjects, the effects of the disease on pharmacokinetic
outcomes could not be characterized.
A finer-grained approach that specifically includes relevant
physiological and biochemical effects and processes and facilitates
examination of organ or tissue-level pharmacokinetics is physio-
logically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. Regrettably,
few PBPK models have been developed for anti-TB drugs, let
alone RPT. Using targeted experimental data in mice, Reisfeld et
al. (17) developed a PBPK model to describe the biodistribution of
the second-line TB agent capreomycin, and because capreomycin
is nephrotoxic (18), PBPK modeling allowed for tissue-specific
concentration predictions at both the site of action for the antibi-
otic effect, the lung, and the site of potential toxicity, the kidney.
Subsequently, Lyons et al. (19) used a rich set of literature data to
create a PBPK model to describe the disposition of rifampin,
which, as noted earlier, is a first-line agent in current therapies for
TB. Although the above models are useful in simulating and com-
paring the disposition of anti-TB drugs in tissues of interest, they
were developed using data from rodents and currently have lim-
ited applicability to humans.
To begin to address this gap, the principal aims of this study
were to (i) develop a PBPK model to predict the ADME for rifap-
entine and its active metabolite in humans, (ii) test the model
against available human study data, and (iii) make tissue-specific
predictions of concentrations of RPT and dRPT in the lung and
compare those to the MIC. The latter aim is particularly relevant
because current dosing recommendations for anti-TB drugs are

 guided by knowledge of the unbound concentration of the agent
in the plasma and by comparing this free fraction to the known
MIC against M. tuberculosis (13). Because this plasma concentra-
tion may not accurately reflect that in the lung, the recommended
dose may not provide the desired level of antibiotic effect.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Approach. To achieve the study aims, two PBPK models were developed,
parameterized, and tested: one specific to the rat (R-PBPK) and another
for humans (H-PBPK). The models shared the same compartmental
structure and set of governing equations, with differences only in the
parameter values, principally related to physiology and metabolism. Start-
ing with development of the R-PBPK, tissue-specific pharmacokinetic
data were used to compute key drug-tissue properties (e.g., partition co-
efficients) that were later utilized in the H-PBPK. Ultimately, both the
R-PBPK and the H-PBPK were parameterized and verified using relevant
sets of training and test data. Further details are given below.
Experimental data. Pharmacokinetic data for RPT in rats were ob-
tained from the work of Assandri et al. (20), which provided (i) drug
concentrations in the plasma under multiple dosing conditions, (ii) con-
centrations obtained from homogenates of several relevant tissues after
oral dosing, and (iii) the fraction of drug bound to plasma proteins over
time. For development of the human model, a comprehensive review of
the literature was conducted to identify pharmacokinetic studies where
RPT was administered to adults as either a single dose or via repeated
doses. Emphasis was placed on studies in which concentrations of both
parent RPT and its metabolite dRPT were quantified because these coin-
cident data could be used in the estimation of relevant metabolism and
dRPT-specific parameters. As shown in Table 3, these data were divided
into two parts: a “training” set used to determine unknown model param-
eters and a “validation” set, used to test and verify the model predictions.
PBPK models. The common PBPK model structure is shown in Fig. 1.
The model comprises a set of compartments for RPT, identical to those
used previously for rifampin (19), integrated with a simpler structure for
the metabolite, dRPT, which consisted of only the lung and a “lumped”
peripheral compartment. The compartmental species mass balance equa-
tions are similar to those used in this prior study (see the Appendix) with
the exception of the description of oral absorption fraction for the parent
compound and the explicit quantitation of the metabolite concentration
over time described below.
Consistent with the experimental results from Assandri et al. (20), oral
absorption was specified to be dose dependent. In particular, the follow-
ing form was used to describe the oral fraction absorbed, Fa:
Fa �
Fa,k
D � Fa,k
(1)
where D is the oral dose and Fa,k represents a constant to be fitted from the
data.
Because the metabolite dRPT is active against M. tuberculosis and its
level has been measured in several studies in humans, the present model
included equations to explicitly track its rate of formation and distribu-
tion over time. The deacetylation reaction to transform RPT to dRPT in

where v is the rate of RPT deacetylation and VM, Km, and KI represent the

strate inhibition constant for RPT deacetylation, respectively. Although
its mechanism of action is currently unknown, in vitro studies have dem-
onstrated the activity of dRPT against M. tuberculosis (4), and because this
species may exhibit similar antibiotic effects in vivo, its disposition may be
of interest when characterizing anti-TB therapies involving RPT. Interest-
ingly, although the levels of dRPT are quantifiable in humans after RPT
administration (6–11, 13–15), similar studies in rats have shown that this
chemical is undetectable in the plasma (20). Consistent with this obser-
vation, the metabolic transformation of RPT to dRPT was not included in
the R-PBPK. Lastly, rather than using in vitro results for RPT and dRPT
protein binding, unbound fractions for this PBPK model were calculated
using results from M. tuberculosis-infected patients after RPT dosing (22).
Parameter estimation. Parameters in the governing PBPK model
equations were taken from the literature or were estimated using the pro-
cedures described below.
Physiological parameters. Physiological compartment volumes and
blood flow rates for human and rat were obtained from a report by Brown
et al. (23). Compartment volumes were scaled linearly with body weight,
blood flow rates were scaled with body weight to the 0.75 power (24), and
thecoefficientsofvariationforeachorganvolumeandthearterialbloodflow
rate were set at 0.2 and 0.3, respectively (19, 25). The resulting physiological
parameters for each compartment are summarized in Table 1.
Partition coefficients. With data for the free concentration of RPT in
the plasma (20), mean values for the tissue-blood partition coefficient,
PT:blood, were determined using the following equation:
PT:blood �
1
BP�
Ctissue
RPT
Cplasma,f
RPT �
(3)
where BP is the blood-plasma partition coefficient, and Ctissue
RPT
and
Cplasma,f
RPT
are the measured tissue and free plasma concentrations of RPT,
respectively. Tissue-plasma partition coefficients were computed for all
model compartments based on time course tissue concentration data (20)
using points during the elimination phase at which equilibrium had been
reached in drug concentration between the tissue and the venous blood.
Other model parameters. To include the effects of data uncertainty
and interstudy variability on model outputs, unknown parameters were
estimated within a Bayesian hierarchical context (26–28). Within this
context, parameters were estimated by first computing partition coeffi-
cients and other relevant parameters for the R-PBPK and then using these
parameter distributions as “priors” in the estimation of the human-spe-
cific parameters.
Simulationmethodologyandcomputingplatform.Oncetheparam-
eter distributions had been computed, a Monte Carlo approach was used
to generate a large family of simulation results that would account for
interstudy variability and data uncertainty. These results were then aggre-
gated and processed to yield mean and 95% prediction intervals for phar-
macokinetic outcomes of interest.
Data from the literature were digitized using DigitizeIt v.1.5.8 (29).
Simulations of the PBPK governing equations, including the Bayesian
Markov chain Monte Carlo, and resulting model evaluation were con-
ducted in MCSim v5.4 (30). Processing, analysis, and visualization of data
were carried out using scripts written in Python v2.7.2 (31) utilizing the
numpy (32), scipy (33), and matplotlib (34) packages. All computations
were performed on a compute cluster running the 64-bit CentOS Linux
operating system on 6-GB-linked Dell 2950 servers, each containing two
quad-core 2.5 GHz Xeon processors and 64 GB of RAM.
RESULTS
Model parameter values. Using the procedures and data detailed
above, distributions for unknown model parameters were esti-
mated. The resulting parameters (posterior distributions) for
both rat- and human-specific models are listed in Table 2.
Testing and verification of the rat-specific model (R-PBPK).
Using the computed parameters for the R-PBPK, simulations
were conducted and compared to in vivo time course concentra-
tion values from a literature study (20) that detailed plasma and
tissue pharmacokinetics after a single 10-mg/kg oral dose in the
rat. This comparison is illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows experi-
mental data (points) and predicted mean (solid line) and 95%
prediction intervals (dashed lines) for the PBPK model.
Testing and verification of the human-specific model (H-
PBPK) for single-dose scenarios. Throughout the studies, train-
ing set data were used for parameter estimation (model calibra-
tion), while verification data were used for model evaluation (27).
Using the set of parameters listed in Tables 1 and 3, simulations
were run for 600-, 900-, and 1,200-mg single oral doses of RPT and
compared to the corresponding dose training and verification
data referenced in Table 3. Figure 3 shows the results of these
comparisons for both RPT and dRPT in the plasma over multiple
studies. The range of the experimental doses shown in this figure
match those in a standard treatment regimen for TB treatment (1,

 35). These comparisons show that the experimental data fall
within the 95% prediction intervals, indicating that the model can
accurately predict the pharmacokinetics of the drug and account
for the variance in this measure across the population sampled.
As an additional verification, pharmacokinetic measures for
RPT (e.g., maximum concentration, area under the curve, and
half-life) were computed from the model and compared to those
from the literature. In particular, Table 4 shows the predicted
values from simulations of time course plasma concentrations and
those in a report by Langdon et al. (11), which were based on
experimental data that were not used in the model parameteriza-
tion.
Testing and verification of the human-specific model (H-
PBPK) for repeated dosing scenarios. Relevant to standard treat-
ments regimens for M. tuberculosis infection (36, 37), model sim-
ulations were conducted for three repeated dosing scenarios for
which well-controlled experimental data were available: regimen
A consisted of a 600-mg dose every day starting 3 days after an
initial 600-mg dose (9), regimen B consisted of a 900-mg dose
every 2 days (15), and regimen C consisted of a 600-mg dose every
3 days (9). Both the experimental data and corresponding simu-
lation results are displayed in Fig. 4.

 Prediction of lung concentrations using the human-specific
model. Along with the predicted plasma concentrations shown in
Fig. 4, simulations yielded the levels of RPT and dRPT in the lung
over time. As an illustration of potential antibiotic effect, Fig. 5
shows the predicted levels of RPT, dRPT, and total rifamycin over
time in the lung for the three RPT oral dosing scenarios described
above.
There are a number of current and anticipated guidelines for
the treatment of both active TB disease and latent TB infection
involving rifapentine as part of a combination therapy (3, 38–41).

 Across these regimens, doses of RPT range from 600 to 1,200 mg
with administration frequencies extending from daily to once
weekly. To determine the pharmacokinetics and potential antibi-
otic effect of RPT and dRPT across these regimens, the model was
used to predict lung concentrations of these species in a simulated
population resulting from various doses of RPT at three adminis-
tration frequencies: once weekly, twice weekly, and daily. The sim-
ulated population in these cases was the group of (virtual) indi-
viduals whose pharmacokinetics were predicted by Monte Carlo
sampling across the estimated physiological and biochemical pa-
rameter distributions determined using the Bayesian procedure
described earlier. Figure 6 depicts a cumulative distribution func-
tion of the dose response that indicates the probability that RPT or
dRPT concentrations in the lungs are above their respective MICs,
which were 0.063 mg/liter for RPT and 0.25 mg/liter for dRPT (4).
DISCUSSION
Methodology. The PBPK models detailed herein utilized a system
of biologically based physiological and biochemical descriptions
and species mass balance equations to make tissue-specific phar-
macokinetic predictions for RPT and its metabolite, dRPT, in rel-
evant tissue compartments for both rats and humans. The values
of unknown parameters in the model system were estimated
within a hierarchical Bayesian framework to incorporate data un-
certainties and interstudy variability, and Monte Carlo simula-
tions were conducted using these distributions to quantify their
effect on pharmacokinetic predictions.
Testing and verification. Model predictions were generally in
good agreement with data from the literature. As shown in Fig. 2,
the experimental data corresponding to plasma and tissue (lung,
kidney, and spleen) concentrations were within the 95% predic-
tion intervals for the rat-specific PBPK model, demonstrating its
ability to reasonably predict tissue-level RPT pharmacokinetics in
this species. For the human-specific PBPK model, single-dose data
from multiple studies for both RPT and dRPT concentrations
were in reasonable concordance with results from simulations
(Fig. 3). The relatively poorer agreement between predictions and
data for dRPT is likely related to variability in metabolism between
subjects, differences in analytical quantitation methods between
studies, and/or an inadequate specification for RPT metabolism in
the model. For repeated oral dosing, model predictions for RPT
concentrations compare well with experimental data for all three
dosing scenarios (Fig. 4). Finally, as shown in Table 4, there was
reasonable to very good agreement between pharmacokinetic
measures, such as Cmax and area under the concentration-time
curve (AUC0–�), computed from simulations and experimental
data.
Model predictions. A principal benefit of the PBPK approach
is the ability to estimate internal doses that are generally not avail-
able in human subjects or patients. Figure 5 shows the predicted
levels of RPT, dRPT, and total rifamycin over time in the lung for
three repeated oral dosing scenarios for RPT. It should be noted
that dRPT does not bind to plasma protein as readily as RPT. This
decrease in fractional protein binding increases the bioavailability
of dRPT and results in a higher predicted concentration of metab-
olite within the lungs. It is also notable that for all three dosing
regimens, the predicted minimum concentrations for both RPT
and dRPT in the lung are significantly above their in vitro MICs for
M. tuberculosis of 0.063 and 0.25 �g/ml, respectively (4). Finally,
the total rifamycin concentration is presented in this figure as an
indication that there may be additional bactericidal effect owing to
the presence of dRPT; however, because the mechanism of action
of dRPT is not currently known, the overall pharmacodynamic
effect cannot be assumed to be additive.

three repeated oral regimens described in Fig. 4, showing concentrations of

 Finally, the model was used to assess the potential efficacy of
regimens spanning current recommended anti-TB therapies that
include RPT (35, 38–41). This assessment was conducted by com-
puting lung tissue concentrations and comparing those to the
MIC for M. tuberculosis. These results are depicted in Fig. 6, which
shows the probability of the minimum steady-state drug concen-
tration in the lungs exceeding the MIC for M. tuberculosis for three
distinct administration frequencies. For illustration, this figure
also contains an example probability threshold of 0.98 from which
a minimum protective dose (MPD) can be found. Using this prob-
ability threshold, the MPD was seen to be 26 mg for once-daily
dosing, 225 mg for the twice-weekly regimen, and 910 mg for the
once-weekly administration (see Fig. 6). Based on these estimates,
anti-TB regimens that include daily administration of 1,200 mg of
RPT (39) for active TB disease exceed the predicted MPD, whereas
those that reduce this dose and frequency for the treatment of
latent TB infection to 750 mg once weekly (40) fall below the
predicted MPD. It is important to note that these results do not
include the antimicrobial effects of other anti-TB drugs given as
part of the regimen; however, depending on the margin of safety,
they could suggest possible adjustments to the dosing schedule.
Novel features and advantages of the present model. Unlike
previous PBPK models for anti-TB drugs (17, 19), the present
model was developed to make predictions of pharmacokinetics in
humans. To quantify and illustrate uncertainty in simulation out-
puts, model development and testing included a Bayesian ap-
proach to parameter estimation and Monte Carlo simulations.
These features allowed the verified model to be used to assess a
current treatment regimen by comparing lung-specific predic-
tions of antibiotic concentrations with the MIC for M. tuberculo-
sis. In addition, because administration of certain rifamycins (in-
cluding rifapentine) has resulted in signs of drug-induced liver
injury (42), liver-specific predictions of drug levels could help
inform treatments that minimize the potential for hepatotoxicity.
Like most PBPK models, the one described here allowed predic-
tion of species concentrations in tissues and/or organs of interest
and provided a systematic way to extrapolate across doses and
between species. With these features, the model has the potential
to aid in dose optimization and in the determination of how phar-
macokinetic endpoints depend on alterations to anatomical,
physiological, and biochemical parameters.
Limitations and deficiencies of the present model. The pres-
ent H-PBPK approach currently suffers from several limita-
tions and deficiencies: (i) it is not immediately applicable to the
analysis of combination drug therapies; (ii) the pharmacoki-
netic predictions, while expected to be valid and useful for a
population or subpopulation, may contain too much uncer-
tainty for individualized applications like personalized medi-
cine; (iii) parameters for the R-PBPK were estimated using
relatively few data points, and inaccuracies in some of these
parameters were propagated to the human-specific model; and
(iv) the specification used for RPT metabolism is biologically
plausible but, owing to a lack of data, has not been adequately
verified.
Future directions. Using the present model as a foundation,
efforts are under way to add additional anti-TB agents (e.g., iso-
niazid or bedaquiline) to simulate combination therapies and
quantify pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Other en-
hancements include integration of pharmacodynamic descrip-
tions that include M. tuberculosis growth and drug-induced killing
kinetics (43, 44) and descriptions of RPT-induced hepatotoxicity
(5, 42).
APPENDIX
The following are the governing equations for the PBPK model,
which mathematically specify the species mass balances and rele-
vant biological phenomena in each compartment. In these equa-
tions, a superscript “i” corresponds to either parent RPT or the

 dRPT metabolite. Although RPT disposition is described in all of
the discrete tissue compartments, dRPT is modeled within only
two compartments: lung and peripheral. Individual tissue blood
flow rates, QT, were computed using total cardiac flow as QT �
QC � QTC and QC � QCC � BW 0.75. QTC values for the percent-
ages of cardiac flow to each tissue are given in Table 1. Finally, the
drug concentration entering tissues in the arterial blood is the free
concentration of drug, CA,f

are calculated using the concentrations within the tissue compart-
