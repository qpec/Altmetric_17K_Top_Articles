Recent reports suggest that acute intoxications by synthetic 
cannabinoids are increasing in the United States (1,2). Synthetic 
cannabinoids, which were research compounds in the 1980s, 
are now produced overseas; the first shipment recognized to 
contain synthetic cannabinoids was seized at a U.S. border in 
2008 (3). Fifteen synthetic cannabinoids are Schedule I con-
trolled substances (3), but enforcement is hampered by the con-
tinual introduction of new chemical compounds (1,3). Studies 
of synthetic cannabinoids indicate higher cannabinoid recep-
tor binding affinities, effects two to 100 times more potent 
than Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (the principal psychoactive 
constituent of cannabis), noncannabinoid receptor binding, 
and genotoxicity (4,5). Acute synthetic cannabinoid exposure 
reportedly causes a range of mild to severe neuropsychiatric, 
cardiovascular, renal, and other effects (4,6,7); chronic use 
might lead to psychosis (6,8). During 2010–2015, physicians 
in the Toxicology Investigators Consortium (ToxIC) treated 
456 patients for synthetic cannabinoid intoxications; 277 of 
the 456 patients reported synthetic cannabinoids as the sole 
toxicologic agent. Among these 277 patients, the most com-
mon clinical signs of intoxication were neurologic (agitation, 
central nervous system depression/coma, and delirium/toxic 
psychosis). Relative to all cases logged by 50 different sites in 
the ToxIC Case Registry, there was a statistically significant 
association between reporting year and the annual proportion 
of synthetic cannabinoid cases. In 2015, reported cases of 
synthetic cannabinoid intoxication increased at several ToxIC 
sites, corroborating reported upward trends in the numbers 
of such cases (1,2) and underscoring the need for prevention.
In 2010, the American College of Medical Toxicology estab-
lished the ToxIC Case Registry as a toxicology surveillance and 
research tool. Participating sites agree to record basic data on 
patients evaluated at local hospitals and clinics in cases where 
consultation by a medical toxicologist is requested; reported 
cases therefore represent severe or potentially severe toxici-
ties. As of November 2015, there were active sites in 41 U.S. 
cities, with a few cities, such as Boston and New York City, 
having multiple sites. The registry is overseen by the Western 
Institutional Review Board and site-specific institutional 
review boards.
Temporal trends in the ToxIC synthetic cannabinoid case 
entries were investigated. Mixed logistic regression was used to 
evaluate the association between year and annual percentage 
of synthetic cannabinoid cases (among total cases, any agent), 
by site. The lme4 package in R (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to fit the model, 
accounting for intrasite and intragroup (e.g., participants in 
ToxIC’s designer drug subregistry) correlation. To evaluate 
model fit, a deviance test was conducted, comparing the full 
model to a reduced model without the year variable. Sensitivity 
analyses were also conducted by dropping one site at a time 
and refitting the model.
During January 1, 2010–November 30, 2015, a total of 
42,138 cases of toxic exposure were logged by 101 participat-
ing hospitals and clinics (Figure 1). Among these, 456 cases 
(at 50 ToxIC sites) involved synthetic cannabinoids, either 
as the sole toxicologic agent (n = 277) or as a component 
of a multiagent exposure (n = 179). Although most sites 
reported <20 synthetic cannabinoid cases, large sites in 
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, New York City, Phoenix, Arizona, 
and Rochester, New York each recorded ≥30 synthetic canna-
binoid intoxication cases. In contrast, during the same period, 
only 13 cases were logged by ToxIC involving nonsynthetic 
cannabinoids (i.e., cannabis) as the sole toxicological agent; 
among these, the majority (n = 11) were children (aged 
2–6 years) or teenagers (age 13–18 years).
Among all 456 synthetic cannabinoid intoxication cases, 
322 (70.6%) occurred in persons aged 19–65 years and 
125 (27.4%) occurred in persons aged 13–18 years; 379 
(83.1%) patients were male. The most common street 
names of synthetic cannabinoids reported by patients or 
accompanying friends and family members were K2 and 
Spice. In 415 (91.0%) cases, the patient had clinical signs 
or symptoms of intoxication; specific toxicologic treat-
ments were administered to 267 (58.6%) patients, whereas 
the rest received standard supportive care and monitoring 
before being discharged. No specific synthetic cannabinoid 
antidotes exist.
Among the 277 (61%) patients who reported synthetic can-
nabinoids as the sole toxicologic exposure, the system most 
commonly affected was the central nervous system (Table), 
manifested by agitation, central nervous system depression/
coma, and delirium/toxic psychosis, with seizures and halluci-
nations reported less frequently. Information on death during 
hospitalization was available for 246 (54%) patients. Among 
these, three (1.2%) deaths were recorded. The first occurred in

a male aged 17 years, who suffered a cardiac arrest after report-
edly taking a single “hit” of K2/Spice; the second occurred 
in an adult male with respiratory depression, agitation, and 
delirium/toxic psychosis after allegedly taking a synthetic 
cannabinoid and oxycodone; and the third occurred in an 
adult male with similar signs, who developed acute kidney 
injury after reportedly taking a synthetic cannabinoid, a 
synthetic cathinone (commonly known as bath salts), and 
the psychedelic drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).
During 2010–2015, the annual percentage of synthetic 
cannabinoid cases among sites increased in all four U.S. 
Census regions; during 2014–2015, the annual percentage 
increased in all regions except the South (Figure 2). The 
largest overall increases during these periods took place in 
the Northeast, primarily driven by increases at the New York 
City sites. Less distinct but discernable increases occurred 
at sites in several other cities nationwide, and a decrease 
occurred at the Rochester, New York, site; heterogeneous 
patterns occurred elsewhere (not shown). In the mixed 
regression analysis, the deviance test indicated that includ-
ing year in the model provided a significantly (p<0.05) 
better fit, evidence of a statistically significant temporal 
trend. In the sensitivity analyses, including the year variable 
improved model fit in a statistically significant manner, in 
each iteration (i.e., when the model was refit after dropping 
one site at a time).

Discussion
The ToxIC data complement data from health agencies, poi-
son centers, and other sources to produce a more detailed pic-
ture of the acute public health impacts of synthetic cannabinoid 
use in the United States. Although some potential for report 
overlap exists, cases in the ToxIC Registry are not routinely 
reported to poison centers. The significant increase in synthetic 
cannabinoid poisonings identified through this consortium 
reflects recent trends, which include a Drug Enforcement 
Agency report of 22 synthetic cannabinoid clusters (including 
two deaths) and 25 additional episodes (including 18 deaths) in 
25 states during August 2011–April 2015 (1), as well as a 330% 
increase in synthetic cannabinoid–related calls to U.S. poison 
centers during the first 4 months of 2015 (2). The observed 
increases might result from increased synthetic cannabinoid 
use; the appearance of more toxic and potent synthetic can-
nabinoid compounds or multisynthetic cannabinoid formu-
lations; increased recognition of synthetic cannabinoids as a 
cause of acute poisoning; increased familiarity among medical 
personnel with the clinical signs and symptoms of synthetic 
cannabinoids; or a combination of these factors (6,7).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, although ToxIC is a unique tool, it is clinically 
based, not population-based, and thus is not geographically 
representative of the United States or the cities where partici-
pating sites are located. The consortium includes most U.S. 
medical toxicology clinical services, but large areas of the 
country that do not have direct access to medical toxicolo-
gists are underrepresented. Second, although the consortium 
strives to report all cases treated by medical toxicologists at 
participating sites, reporting might be affected by several fac-
tors, including clinical caseload, personnel changes, and refer-
ral patterns. Nonetheless, the consortium’s use of normalized 
statistics (the proportion of all consultations that were related 
to synthetic cannabinoids) and a mixed regression approach, 
which accounts for intrasite variability, improves confidence 
that the observed temporal increases are real. Third, synthetic 
cannabinoid case identification was based on patient history 
and clinical presentation; analytical confirmation is not avail-
able for most synthetic cannabinoid cases in the registry. The 
development of analytical tests that reliably detect synthetic 
cannabinoids and their metabolites in biologic samples is 
hindered by the production of new chemical compounds 
for which no analytical standards exist, difficulties in finding 
unique synthetic cannabinoid biomarkers, and other challenges 
(2,9,10); thus, analytical tests are not routinely used by every 
ToxIC physician. Instead, these physicians rely on patient 
self-reports or reports of accompanying family members or 
friends. Because of this, reports of drugs taken might be inac-
curate, leading to misattribution of certain clinical signs and 
symptoms to synthetic cannabinoids. Fourth, as is common in 
drug abuse/misuse cases (8), approximately half of the ToxIC 
synthetic cannabinoid cases involved multiagent exposures, 
including synthetic cannabinoids in combination with other 
illicit or prescription drugs or alcohol. Consequently, other 
agents, or the combination of psychoactive substances, might 
have been responsible for the effects observed. A small German 
study, with analytical confirmation of the synthetic cannabi-
noids and other drugs in patient samples, reported that clinical 
signs in patients with concurrent drug exposures were similar 
to those who were exposed only to synthetic cannabinoids 
(7). Finally, patients occasionally declined to divulge details 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Acute intoxications by synthetic cannabinoids appear to be 
increasing in the United States. Synthetic cannabinoids are two 
to 100 times more potent than Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the 
active ingredient in cannabis; acute exposure is associated with 
a range of mild to severe neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, renal, 
and other effects.
What is added by this report?
During 2010–2015, among 456 cases of synthetic cannabinoid 
intoxication among patients treated by U.S. medical toxicolo-
gists, 277 (61%) had reports of synthetic cannabinoids as the 
sole toxicologic agent. Three deaths were recorded, one with 
synthetic cannabinoids given as the sole agent and two with 
multiple agent exposures. Synthetic cannabinoid poisonings 
increased in all U.S. Census regions.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The increase in acute synthetic cannabinoid poisonings 
underscores the importance of targeted prevention interven-
tions and the need for education about the potentially life-
threatening consequences of synthetic cannabinoid use.

of their exposure. For example, among 37,984 total cases 
recorded at ToxIC’s U.S. sites during January 1, 2010–June 30, 
2015, a total of 3,153 (8.3%) were missing agent information 
or recorded as unknown agent. Some of these cases possibly 
involved synthetic cannabinoids but were not recorded as such.
The increase in acute synthetic cannabinoid poisonings 
observed in ToxIC underscores the need for targeted preven-
tion interventions. Educating the public on the potentially 
life-threatening consequences of synthetic cannabinoid use 
is important for countering the observed upward trend in 
synthetic cannabinoid poisonings.
