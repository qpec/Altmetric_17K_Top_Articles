Abstract
Introduction
Heart disease and cancer are the first and second leading causes of
death in the United States. Age-standardized death rates (risk)
have declined since the 1960s for heart disease and for cancer
since the 1990s, whereas the overall number of heart disease
deaths declined and cancer deaths increased. We analyzed mortal-
ity data to evaluate and project the effect of risk reduction, popula-
tion growth, and aging on the number of heart disease and cancer
deaths to the year 2020.
Methods
We used mortality data, population estimates, and population pro-
jections to estimate and predict heart disease and cancer deaths
from 1969 through 2020 and to apportion changes in deaths result-
ing from population risk, growth, and aging.
Results
We predicted that from 1969 through 2020, the number of heart
disease deaths would decrease 21.3% among men (–73.9% risk,
17.9% growth, 34.7% aging) and 13.4% among women (–73.3%
risk, 17.1% growth, 42.8% aging) while the number of cancer
deaths would increase 91.1% among men (–33.5% risk, 45.6%
growth, 79.0% aging) and 101.1% among women (–23.8% risk,
48.8% growth, 76.0% aging). We predicted that cancer would be-
come the leading cause of death around 2016, although sex-specif-
ic crossover years varied.
Conclusion
Risk of death declined more steeply for heart disease than cancer,
offset the increase in heart disease deaths, and partially offset the
increase in cancer deaths resulting from demographic changes
over the past 4 decades. If current trends continue, cancer will be-
come the leading cause of death by 2020.
Introduction
For most of the last century, the leading cause of death in the
United States, as measured by actual deaths, was heart disease,
followed by cancer (1). Cancer overtook heart disease to become
the leading cause of death in 1 state (Alaska) in 1993, 2 states in
2000, 8 states in 2005, and 23 states in 2010, although the trend
slowed or stopped in recent years (2,3).
The age-standardized death rate approximates the population’s
risk of dying from a given cause and is used to compare risk of
death between populations or within a population over time. De-
clining death rates indicate that the overall risk to the population
of dying from heart disease or cancer decreased. However, age-
standardized death rates do not convey the full extent of the bur-
den of these diseases, because they effectively remove the influ-
ence of demographic changes related to population growth and
changing age structure. Although the age-standardized death rate
for heart disease began to decline in the late 1960s and for all can-
cers combined some 20 years later, the overall number of heart
disease deaths declined and the number of cancer deaths increased
(1,4).
The number of deaths is a function of the population risk of being
diagnosed and dying from that cause and the size and age struc-
ture of the population. The risk of death from heart disease and

 cancer generally increases with age, and over the past several dec-
ades the US population increased, particularly in the age group 65
years or older (5). These demographic changes are forecast to con-
tinue into this century as the cohort born after World War II, with
increased longevity than earlier cohorts, enters the age groups
most at risk of dying from heart disease and cancer.
The objective of this study was to use mortality data, current pop-
ulation estimates, and population projections to predict age-stand-
ardized death rates and death counts for heart disease and cancer
from 1969, around the peak of heart disease death rates (risk),
through 2020 and to apportion changes in deaths resulting from
population risk reduction, population growth, and population
aging (ie, shift in age distribution toward older ages and increased
longevity).
Methods
Source of data
We obtained mortality data from 1969 through 2014 from the Na-
tional Vital Statistics System (6).The underlying cause of death
was assigned according to the International Classification of Dis-
ease (ICD) in use at the time of death, converted to ICD-10 (Inter-
national Classification of Disease, Revision 10), and recoded to
ensure comparability over time (7). For these analyses, we defined
heart disease as rheumatic heart disease (I00–I09), hypertensive
heart disease (I11), hypertensive heart and kidney disease (I13),
acute myocardial infarction (I21–I22), other ischemic or coronary
heart disease (I20, I23–I25), atrial fibrillation (I48), other ar-
rhythmias (I47, I49), heart failure (I50), and other heart disease
(I26–I146, I51); we defined cancer as malignant neoplasms (ICD-
10: C00–97).
Bridged single-race population estimates based on the 2010 US
Census were available through the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) Program (8). We obtained data on popu-
lation projections of the resident population by race, age, and sex
from 2015 through 2020 from the US Census Bureau’s Popula-
tion Projections Program (9). Population estimates and projec-
tions were used as the denominators in rate calculations.
Trends in death rates, 1969–2014
We performed statistical analyses using SEER Stat software, ver-
sion 8.3.2 (Surveillance Research Program [http://seer.cancer.gov/
seerstat/]), calculating averaged, annual age-standardized death
rates per 100,000 population and standardized to the 2000 popula-
tion, by sex and race (all, white, black). We estimated trends in
death rates from 1969 through 2014 using joinpoint regression
(Joinpoint Trend Analysis Software, version 4.2.0.1, http://surveil-
lance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/),  where  a  maximum  of  5  joined
straight-line segments were fit on a logarithmic scale to the trends
in annual death rates. We described the resulting trends by the
slope of each line segment as the annual percentage change
(APC), using t tests (2-sided, P < .05) to assess whether the APCs
were significantly different from zero. We used the terms increase
or decrease to describe significant trends and stable to describe
nonsignificant trends.
Methods for projecting cancer death rates and counts are de-
scribed in detail elsewhere (10). Briefly, to project age-standard-
ized death rates and counts for 2015 through 2020, we used Nord-
pred software (11,12), which uses an age-period–cohort regres-
sion model with data aggregated into six 5-year calendar periods
(1985–1989, 1990–1994, 1995–1999, 2000–2004, 2005–2009,
2010–2014) and 15 age groups (15–19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34,
35–39, 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74, 75–79,
80–84, ≥85 y). Separate models were constructed for heart disease
causes of death and for leading cancer causes of death, by sex for
all races combined. We based projections for all heart disease
deaths and all cancer deaths on summed estimates among the indi-
vidual disease categories. We obtained predicted death counts and
age-standardized death rates by applying estimated age-specific
death rates to the population projections for 2015 through 2020.
Methods to apportion the relative contribution to changes in the
total number of new heart disease or cancer deaths each year that
can be attributed to changes in population risk (including changes
in diagnosis and treatment practices) and demographic changes re-
lated to population size and age structure are described elsewhere
(10). Briefly, we generated 3 sets of data for each death year from
1969 through 2020. Baseline was defined as the number of deaths
from heart disease or cancer that occurred in 1969 for men and
women separately. We generated one set of data for the total num-
ber of cancer deaths that would have occurred each year if the
population size and age structure remained the same as it was in
1969; this set reflects the effect of changes in population risk and
is similar to the age-standardized death rate. A second set of data
was generated for the total number of deaths that would have oc-
curred if the age structure had remained the same as it was in
1969; this set reflects the effect of changes in risk and population
growth. A third set of data was generated for the observed number
of deaths that actually occurred and thus reflects the combined im-
pact of changes in population risk, growth, and aging. The yearly
difference between each set of death counts denotes the relative
contribution to the overall change in the number of deaths since
1969 attributed to population risk, growth, and aging. A decline in
risk results in negative death counts, because fewer deaths are at-
tributed to risk compared with 1969, the baseline year.

 Results
The percentage change in death rates for heart disease declined
among men (68.4%) and women (67.6%) (Table 1). By race and
sex, the percentage decline was 68.8% among white men, 67.6%
among white women, 59.4% among black men, and 63.8% among
black women. The APCs for heart disease death rates for all races
combined declined from 1969 through 2014 for men and women.
By race and sex, the APC was stable in white men from 2010
through 2014 and from 2011 through 2014 for black men and wo-
men.  The  APC  continued  to  decrease  among  white  women
through 2014.
From 1969 through 2014, the overall cancer death rates declined
among men (21.9%) and women (15.6%). By race and sex, the
percentage change declined by 20.9% among white men, 14.5%
among white women, 19.3% among black men, and 11.0% among
black women. The APCs for cancer death rates increased between
1969 and 1990–1992 in men and women of both racial groups be-
fore declining in all groups beginning in the early 1990s through
2014.
In 1969, the risk of heart disease death (measured by the ASDR)
was 2.8 times higher than the risk of cancer death among white
men and 2.2 times higher among black males. In 2014, the risk of
heart disease death was 1.1 times higher than the risk of cancer
death among black men and lower (0.9) among white women. In
2009, the cancer death rate surpassed that for heart disease among
white women while actual deaths remained higher.
Table 2 and Figure 1 show the contributions to the changes in the
total observed (1969–2014) and predicted (2015–2020) number of
heart disease and cancer deaths by sex and year attributed to
changes in population risk, growth, and aging by sex from the
baseline (1969) through 2020. Compared with 1969, the number
of heart disease deaths in 2020 is predicted to decrease by 21.3%
among men (–73.9% risk, 17.9% growth, 34.7% aging) and 13.4%
among women (–73.3% risk, 17.1% growth, 42.8% aging). Can-
cer deaths are predicted to increase by 91.1% among men (–33.5%
risk, 45.6% growth, 79.0% aging) and 101.1% among women
(–23.8% risk, 48.8% growth, 76.0% aging). In 2017, more cancer
deaths are predicted than heart disease deaths in men (321,107 vs
319,793). In 2015, similar numbers of cancers deaths (281,683) as
heart disease deaths (281,675) are predicted for women.

deaths among men. The number of heart disease deaths attributed to risk
declined while the number of heart disease deaths resulting from population
growth and aging increased. Observed heart disease deaths declined from
1969 through 2014 and are predicted to increase through 2020, primarily
because of an aging population. B. Number of cancer deaths among men. The
number of cancer deaths attributed to risk increased from 1969 through
2000  and  declined  from  2000  forward.  The  number  of  cancer  deaths
resulting from population growth and aging increased. Observed cancer
deaths increased from 1969 through 2014 and are predicted to continue to
increase through 2020, primarily because of an aging population. C. Number
of heart disease deaths among women. The number of heart disease deaths
attributed to risk declined while the number of heart disease deaths resulting
from population growth and aging increased. Observed heart disease deaths
increased from 1969 through 1995, primarily because of an aging population.
Observed heart disease deaths are predicted to continue to decrease through
2020, primarily because of continued risk reduction. D. Number of cancer
deaths among women. The number of cancer deaths attributed to risk
increased from 1969 through 2000 and declined from 2000 forward. The
number  of  cancer  deaths  resulting  from  population  growth  and  aging
increased. Observed cancer deaths increased from 1969 through 2015 and
are predicted to continue to increase through 2020, primarily because of an
aging population.

 Figure  2  shows  the  observed  (1969–2014)  and  predicted
(2015–2020) number of deaths and death rates for heart disease
and cancer by year for all races and both sexes combined. From
2015 to 2020, we predict the number of heart disease deaths over-
all to stabilize and cancer deaths to increase and surpass heart dis-
ease deaths. For 2016, we predict more deaths from cancer than
from heart disease (591,426 vs 587,329). In 2020, we predict a
total of 627,620 cancer deaths vs 572,415 heart disease deaths.

Discussion
Our projections indicate that cancer will soon become the leading
cause of death in the United States if trends in risk of death from
cancer and heart disease and population growth and aging contin-
ue. In 1969, there were more than twice as many heart disease
deaths as cancer deaths. The decline in heart disease rates (risk)
began earlier and was steeper than the decline in risk of death from
cancer, which occurred approximately 20 years later. The mag-
nitude of heart disease risk reduction has offset the increase in
heart disease deaths from population growth and aging, while the
decline in risk of cancer deaths only partially offset the increase in
cancer deaths resulting from demographic changes related to pop-
ulation growth and aging. These findings are similar among black
and white Americans.
Several factors contributed to the decline in heart disease risk. In
1964, the first Surgeon General’s report on smoking and health
(13) linked smoking and lung cancer, and a later report linked
smoking with the risk of heart attack and stroke, noting that
smokers had about twice the risk of dying from heart disease than
lifetime nonsmokers (14). Among smokers, the reduction in ex-
cess risk of death from heart disease occurs soon after cessation
and is reduced by about half after only one year of smoking ab-
stinence (15). After 15 years of cessation, the risk of death is
slightly elevated, but similar to those who never smoked, support-
ing the hypothesis that the inflammatory component of cardiovas-
cular disease is reversible. Although the declining risk of dying
from heart disease has paralleled the decline in smoking preval-
ence, treatment of cardiovascular disease risk factors has also im-
proved. Cohorts who were aged 50 to 60 years in the 1970s had a
43% lower 10-year cumulative mortality than similar cohorts who
reached that age in the 1950s, with significant reductions in cardi-
ovascular disease risk factors such as lower serum cholesterol
levels, lower systolic blood pressure, and better overall blood pres-
sure control (16). From 1980 to 2000, approximately half of the
decline in heart disease death was attributed to improved treat-
ment after acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina, second-
ary prevention post-myocardial infarction, treatment of heart fail-
ure, and revascularization for chronic angina. The remaining de-
cline was attributed to further reductions in the major risk factors
— total cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, and smoking —
and increased physical activity (17). Further reduction in the risk
of heart disease deaths may have been tempered by increases in
body mass index and the prevalence of diabetes (18).
The overall risk of death from heart disease declined in both black
and white Americans and, based on our model, is predicted to con-
tinue to decline through 2020. Since 1969, the reduction in risk
among men has more than offset the increase in heart disease
deaths caused by population growth and aging. This reduction in
risk has resulted in an overall decline in the observed number of
heart disease deaths. However, we predict that the number of heart
disease deaths will stabilize or increase slightly in men from 2015
to 2020 as further risk reduction is no longer able to offset the in-
crease in heart disease deaths caused by demographic trends, par-
ticularly trends in population aging. A reduction in the number of
heart disease deaths among women began more recently and is
predicted to continue through 2020.
The overall risk of dying from cancer increased throughout much
of the latter part of the last century and is consistent with an in-
crease in the incidence of 4 leading cancers: cancers of the lung
and bronchus, colon and rectum, prostate, and female breast (8).
Collectively, these cancers accounted for almost 50% of all can-
cer deaths in the United States. The cancer death rate began to de-
cline in the early 1990s and was largely driven by a decline in
deaths from cancers of the lung and prostate in men, breast cancer
in women, and a continued decline in colorectal cancer deaths in
both men and women that began in the mid-1980s. Lung cancer
death rates in women began to decline in the early 2000s, approx-
imately a decade after the decline began in men.

 The decline in lung cancer death rates in both men and women
parallels a reduction in tobacco use in each group, offset by a
latency period of several decades (19). Death rates from other to-
bacco-related cancers have declined as well, likely the result of re-
duced smoking prevalence as subsequent Surgeon General reports
found convincing evidence for a direct causal relationship (20).
Access to quality health care, including early diagnosis through
screening, timely follow-up, and evidence-based treatments, is be-
lieved to have resulted in increased survival accompanied by re-
duced mortality from colorectal cancer and, to a lesser extent, fe-
male breast cancer and prostate cancer (21).
The risk of dying from cancer increased among men and women
throughout the early 1990s before declining, with further risk re-
duction predicted through 2020. The increase in the risk of death
from cancer from 1969 to the early 1990s exacerbated the in-
crease in cancer deaths caused by demographic changes in popula-
tion growth and aging, resulting in an overall increase in the ob-
served number of cancer deaths. As the risk of cancer deaths
began to decline, the number of deaths continued to increase, al-
though at a slower rate. Underlying these trends in deaths is the
predicted number of incident cases of cancer, which is expected to
increase by more than 20% from 2010 through 2020, whereas the
overall risk of being diagnosed with cancer is predicted to remain
stable (22).
The risk of dying from heart disease and cancer generally in-
creases with age and, as a result, the numbers of heart disease and
cancer deaths increase with the growth and aging of the US popu-
lation. These demographic influences are likely to continue, be-
cause the US population is expected to increase by 10% from 2010
to 2020, with the proportion of the population 65 years of age or
older increasing from 13% to 16% (5). The reduction in risk of
death from cancer started later than the reduction in risk of death
from heart disease and has not been as rapid. Our models estim-
ated that the number of deaths from cancer would surpass the
number of deaths from heart disease around 2016, because heart
disease deaths were predicted to stabilize or increase slightly in
men, and cancer deaths were predicted to continue to increase.
Heart disease deaths actually increased in 2013 and again in 2014,
somewhat earlier than predicted.
These results are subject to several limitations. This study used
methods based on age–period–cohort models that identify trends
in younger birth cohorts and extrapolate these trends to future
older cohorts (12). Studies have validated these methods by using
long-term cancer incidence data but not heart disease or cancer
death data. These predictions are based on trends in risk during the
past 10 to 30 years; trends in recent years may differ from long-
term trends. As such, predictions of heart disease and cancer
deaths may be overestimates, because the risk components in these
models do not account for potential recent advances in primary
prevention and treatment or national initiatives, such as CDC’s
Screen for Life: National Colorectal Cancer Action Campaign (ht-
tp://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/sfl/) or the Million Hearts
project (http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/). At the same time, our pre-
dictions may be underestimates because the risk component may
not fully account for the potential effect of increased prevalence of
obesity and diabetes on risk for cardiovascular disease or for can-
cers such as pancreatic cancer, which is increasing and now is the
fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States
(23).
The population projections used in these predictions are them-
selves forecasts of the population size and age composition based
on assumptions on future births, deaths, and migration. Further-
more, overall life expectancy in the United States is improving
even as disparities by race and socioeconomic factors are increas-
ing (24); these trends are likely to affect population projections.
Possible misclassification of underlying cause of death may con-
tribute to imprecision in our estimates.
To counter the anticipated growth in the number of heart disease
and cancer deaths, increase the health span of an aging population,
and reduce the incidence of heart disease and cancer, a greater em-
phasis on primary prevention and improved treatment is needed.
CDC estimates that each year approximately 91,000 premature
deaths from heart disease and 84,000 premature deaths from can-
cer are potentially preventable (25). Heart disease and cancer share
numerous related risk factors, including tobacco use, obesity, and
physical inactivity. Further reductions in deaths might yet be
achievable if Healthy People 2020 objectives related to risk
factors, early diagnosis, and access to health care are met (26).
