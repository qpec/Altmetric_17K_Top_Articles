evidence of lipid histotrophy in lamnoid shark reproduction

ABSTRACT
The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) exhibits viviparous
and oophagous reproduction. A 4950 mm total length (TL) gravid
female accidentally caught by fishermen in the Okinawa Prefecture,
Southern Japan carried six embryos (543-624 mm TL, three in each
uterus). Both uteri contained copious amounts of yellowish viscous
uterine fluid (over 79.2 litres in the left uterus), nutrient eggs and
broken egg cases. The embryos had yolk stomachs that had ruptured,
the mean volume of which was approximately 197.9 ml. Embryos had
about 20 rows of potentially functional teeth in the upper and lower
jaws. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive substances were observed
on the surface and in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells, and large,
secretory, OsO4-oxidized lipid droplets of various sizes were
distributed on the surface of the villous string epithelium on the
uterine wall. Histological examination of the uterine wall showed it to
consist of villi, similar to the trophonemata of Dasyatidae rays,
suggesting that the large amount of fluid found in the uterus of the
white shark was likely required for embryo nutrition. We conclude that:
(1) the lipid-rich fluid is secreted from the uterine epithelium only in
early gestation before the onset of oophagy, (2) the embryos probably
use the abundant uterine fluid and encased nutrient eggs for nutrition
at this stage of their development, and (3) the uterine fluid is the major
source of embryonic nutrition before oophagy onset. This is the first
record of the lipid histotrophy of reproduction among all shark species.

INTRODUCTION
Matrotrophy is common in Chondrichthyes and several modes
of embryonic nourishment have been documented, such as
histotrophy (either lipid or mucoid), oophagy (adelphophagy), and
placentotrophy (Hamlett et al., 2005). In lamniform sharks, oophagy
is one of the primary modes of embryonic nutrition (Wourms, 1977);
indeed, it is a defining characteristic of the group although there are a
few species whose reproductive modes have yet to be observed.
Within the lamnoids, Carcharias taurus, Lamna nasus, and Isurus
oxyrinchus are relatively well-studied, providing reproductive
reference models against which to contrast other lamniform
sharks. Gilmore (1993) suggested that the embryos of C. taurus
pass through at least six nutritive phases during gestation, including:
yolk-sac yolk, uterine fluid, egg capsules containing other embryos,
and egg cases containing unfertilized ova. The reproduction of the
great white shark C. carcharias (hereafter referred to as ‘white
shark’) was evaluated recently (Castro, 2011) based on several
gravid specimens caught in Japan, New Zealand, and some
unpublished photographs of embryos uploaded on web-pages. A
gravid female recorded from Toyo-cho, Japan (Uchida et al., 1996)
contained ten young that measured 135-151 cm, and another from
New Zealand (Francis, 1996) contained seven young measuring
143.0 and 144.9 cm TL (only two of them were measured). These
embryos did not exhibit any signs of a swollen external yolk stomach
and appeared to be near-term. To our knowledge, there are several
records of early to mid-term embryos that have been examined and
measured by biologists (Christiansen et al., 2014), but little is known
about white shark matrotrophy in the early gestation period between
the end of yolk-dependency and the onset of oophagy.
Histological examination of the mature uterus is essential to
evaluate the type of matrotrophy. Recent studies suggest many
lecithotrophic sharks have secretory tissues associated with their
uterine walls, implying that maternal nourishment likely occurs in
these species (Hamlett et al., 2005; Cotton et al., 2015). These forms
are classified as ‘mucoid histotrophy’ (Conrath and Musick, 2012)
when mucus-secreting cells are evident in the uterus; ‘embryotrophy’
(Castro et al., 2016) when there is lipid-free but energy-rich uterine
fluid evident, or ‘lipid histotrophy’ when trophonemata produce
copious amounts of yellowish, milky secretions (currently known
only in batoids). No histological or histochemical examination has
ever been conducted on a white shark uterus throughout its gestation
period because the white shark is listed as ‘Vulnerable’ on the IUCN
Red List (http://www.iucnredlist.org, 2016), therefore, there have
been very few opportunities to observe pregnant females or to study
the histology of the uterus.
Present research examined a gravid female specimen which was
incidentally and legally caught by the fishery off Yomitan Village,
Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, on 13 February 2014. The white shark is
a species with no commercial value in this area, and the landed
specimens were donated for scientific research by the Yomitan
Fishery Cooperative. This specimen has provided the scientific
community with an opportunity to significantly further our
knowledge of white shark reproduction. The specimen contained
rare embryos at a relatively early stage of gestation in both uteri, with
a large amount of yellowish, milky uterine fluid. We describe the
morphological features of these embryos and the microstructures of
the uterine wall of the mother, below.
RESULTS
Characteristics of embryos in uterus
Table 1 shows the size and proportional measurements of the embryos.
The total lengths, weights and external features suggested that most of
the embryos were at the same developmental stage, though a 543 mm
TL embryo (Fig. 1A) was somewhat smaller than the others. The body
was entirely a pale whitish colour, without pigmentation or colour

 pattern. The trunk region behind cloaca was very narrow, while all
paired and unpaired fins were small. The caudal fin was not lunate
shaped, and its lower lobe was undeveloped. About 20 rows of
‘embryonic teeth’ (sensu Gilmore, 1993) were present on both upper
and lower jaws (Fig. 1B); they were triangular and ∼2 mm in crown
height, and these teeth were half-erect and probably functional. Such
embryonic teeth have been examined and documented in other
lamniform genera, such as Isurus, Carcharias, and Lamna, and are
believed to be used for puncturing the capsule of nutritive eggs
(Gilmore, 1993; Francis and Stevens, 2000; Shimada, 2002).
Pharyngeal arches were expanded laterally, and the pharyngeal
cavity was greatly opened (Fig. 1A). The stomach was distended but
ruptured at the postero-ventral portion, probably filled with uterine
fluid or yolk substances; its average approximate volumewas estimated
to be 197.9 ml (s.d.=59.9 ml). The external yolk-sac had already
disappeared from the ventral surface of the body, but small rudiments
of the internal yolk sac were evident in the body cavity which was
connected to the intestine by the ductus vitello-intestinalis. The spiral
intestine at posterior portion (Fig. 1B,C) has a hard obstruction with a
fine-grained crystalline material which was easily dissolved by acetic
acid, which may prevent the embryos excreting into the uterus.
Uterine environment
Each uterus was filled with viscoid, yellowish fluid (Figs S3 and S4)
similar to the ‘uterine milk’ of the manta rays. The precise volume of
the uterine fluid could not be measured because some fluid had been
lost. The measured volume of the residual fluid was 79.2 litres (from
the left uterus). The left and right uteri contained three embryos
each, and at least 60 and 65 egg cases (Fig. 2, Fig. S4) containing
small nutrient eggs were present in both left and right uterus. There
was also evidence of several broken egg cases. The mean diameter
of the naked nutrient eggs was 7.4 mm, and sometimes found in the
uterine fluid, but their origins (egg case or stomach of embryos)
were not determined.
A precise analysis of the uterine fluid was not carried out in the
present study because of the possibility of contamination of the fluid
by embryonic stomach contents, external substances and blood from
the mother. However, considering the total volumes of the nutrient
eggs and the embryonic stomachs, these contaminations were
obviously not the major contents of the uterine fluid.
Histology and histochemistry
Uterus
Observations detailed below are based on the left uterus. A streak of
butter-like substance was found on the surface of the central part of
the uterus (Fig. 3A). Several large ridges that were white in colour
(3.4–7.7 mm in width and 9.3 mm in depth) were observed near the
entrance of uterus, merging with the oviducts.
Observation of the right uterus revealed that the epithelium was
abundantly covered with thin lamellar complexes (3.3–4.8 mm in
length; Fig. 3B,C). Epithelial cells of the lamellae consisted of two or
three layers of cytoplasm-rich cuboidal cells with large, round nuclei.
Some epithelial cells facing the lumen showed large vacuoles in their
cytoplasm. The central part of the lamellae consisted of fibroblasts and
a network of capillaries (Fig. 3E). PAS-positive substances were
observed on the surface and cytoplasm of the epithelial cells of the
lamellae but not in their large vacuoles and fluid (Fig. 3E). The thick
outer wall of the uterus was mainly composed of developed smooth
muscle tissues and collagen (Fig. 3D). Many large blackish lipid
droplets of different sizes seen in the cytoplasm of some epithelial
cells of villous strings (Fig. 4A,B) were oxidized by OsO4. This

 suggested that many of the vacuoles observed in the epithelial cells
were also lipid droplets. Several thick blood vessels were observed in
the tissues. Two types of PAS-positive substances were observed in
the uterine fluid: PAS-positive granules probably originated from
broken nutrient yolk-sac yolk, whereas the PAS-positive fluid was
probably secreted from the uterine epithelium.
Ovary
Only the right ovary was developed and functional, showing a
remarkable development of the epigonal organ (Fig. 5A); however,
the left ovary was difficult to identify due to its underdevelopment
and was covered with a white tissue. Although numerous oval-shaped
yolk-containing oocytes (4.5–5.5 mm at the longest diameter) together
with small oocytes (less than 1 mm in the longest diameter) were
found in the right ovary (Fig. 5B), no well-developed oocytes were
longer than 6 mm. Histological observations showed several yolk-
containing oocytes, post-ovulatory follicles, and young oocytes before
yolk formation within the same ovarian tissue (Fig. 5C). The follicular
layers enclosing the yolk-containing oocytes showed hypertrophy or
incorporation of the yolk granules into their cytoplasm, indicating
oocyte degeneration (Fig. 5D). The yolk granules within the cytoplasm
of yolk-containing oocytes were strongly PAS-stained (Fig. 5D).
Stomach and intestinal contents of embryos
Histological observation suggested that the epithelial cells of the
embryonic stomach do not have a secretory function, instead, the
stomach appears to function as storage of nutrients. Embryonic
stomach contents contain lipid droplets secreted as vacuoles from
the uterine epithelium (Fig. 6A), but no evidence of lipid droplets
was found in the spiral intestine of the embryos (Fig. 6B). Numerous
PAS-positive digested granules regarded as digests of granules were
observed in the spiral intestine.
Comparative material
The uteri of the comparative material (OCF-P03062, 5050 mm TL)
carried four embryos with full-yolk stomachs in the left uterus only,
and contained copious amounts of clear uterine fluid with low
viscosity. Histological observations on the left uterus showed that
epithelium was composed of a single layer of cells with large and
round nuclei (Fig. 7A,B). Many capillary vessels were localized on
the inner side of the epithelial cell layer (Fig. 7A,B). PAS-positive
reaction was detected only on the outer surface of epithelial cells
(Fig. 7A). A semi-thin section of the uterus fixed by OsO4 revealed
that cytoplasm of epithelial cells contained no blackish droplet,
which suggested that the uterus secreted no lipid droplet (Fig. 7B).
DISCUSSION
Our morphological and histological examination of early oophagus-
stage embryos suggests that a lipid-histotrophic phase likely
precedes the oophagus phase. The presence of histotrophic
nutrition in lamniform shark reproduction was firstly hypothesized
by Gilmore (1983, 1993), based on the study of Carcharias taurus.
Gilmore (1993) suggested that C. taurus had at least six phases of
embryonic nutrition, and that the fluid secretion from the uterine
epithelium was activated around hatching to provide oxygen and
nutrition to the embryos in uterus. These conclusions were based on
the presence of a highly vascularized uterine epithelium, particularly
at the isthmus; however, they did not show any direct histochemical
evidence of histotrophy. Gilmore (1983) also documented that
numerous trophonemata are present in the uterine wall of Isurus
oxyrinchus and mentioned that the structure was undoubtedly a
major source of respiratory oxygen for the lamnoid sharks.
Our study provides the first direct evidence of uterine secretion of
lipid-rich uterine fluid often dubbed ‘uterine milk’ in lamniform
sharks. This study indicates that the amount of the uterine fluid was
remarkably large,measuring79.2 litresfrom the leftuteruscontaining
three embryos, and we assume that the fluid is secreted from the
uterine epithelium of numerous villi or lamellae. Precise detection of
each component of the fluid has not yet been completed, but

 histochemical staining suggests that the uterine epithelium of villous
strings are implicated in the secretion of lipid droplets and at least two
types of PAS-positive granular and fluid substances. The lipid
secretions in the white shark were highly active and resembled those
from the trophonemata of pregnant manta rays (Soma et al., 2013).
It is likely that thewhite sharkembryos inthe stage examined inthis
study consume not only uterine milk but also nutrient eggs. Embryos
have functional teeth and 50-70 encased nutrient eggs, and some
broken capsules, were found in both left and right uteri. These
observations indicate that the embryos may consume some nutrient
egg capsules at this stage, but the total numbers of capsules were
insufficiently largeto exclusivelyaccountfor the nourishment ofthree
embryos. Hamlett (W.C. Hamlett, PhD thesis, Clemson University,
1983) predicted the level of consumption of egg capsules in C. taurus
as 1000-1700 during a single pregnancy; if this assumption is applied
for present research the egg capsules found in each uterus are much
less than the requirements for three embryos. The still developing
oocytes (4.5–5.5 mm diameter) and several post-ovulatory follicles
(over 6 mm diameter) found in the ovaries indicated a very early stage
of yolk supply. These observations suggest that uterine fluid is the
major source of nutrition for white shark embryos in early gestation,
and that the nutrient egg is the subsequent source in white shark
development. It is likely that the importance of the lipid secretion
decreases through gestation because ‘uterine milk’ has not been
observed in the uterus in late gestation period (Uchida et al., 1996).
Our observation on the comparative materials in late gestation phase
also showed that the uterus contained clear liquid with low viscosity.
In addition, the structure of the uterine epithelium in late gestation was
completely different from that in early gestation, and no lipid droplet
was seen in the uterine epithelium (Fig. 7A,B). Moreover, the highly
vascularized uterine lamellae further increased the contact area to
provide oxygen into the uterine fluid. These facts indicate that the
uterine epithelium transforms its structure and functions with progress
of pregnancy. Likewise, Jensen et al. (2002) observed many pregnant
females of Lamna nasus in the late gestation period and described the
presence of clear intrauterine fluid surrounding the embryos
consuming yolk-sac yolk, suggesting that the sharks with oophagus
reproduction probably change the composition of uterine fluid over
the course of gestation.
This study suggests that white shark reproduction is complex.
Embryos probably rely on a changing source of nutrition over the
course of their development. The embryos depend on at least three

 major sources of nutrition, yolk-sac yolk (lecithotrophy) in the
initial phase, uterine milk (lipid histotrophy) in the second phase
and nutrient eggs (oophagy) in the third phase.
Although present data were obtained from the limited number of
specimens, our data are highly suggestive about the strategies that
white sharks employ to nourish their embryos to ‘extra-large’ size in
the gestation. The combination of maternal input with lipid-rich
uterine milkand nutrientyolk may increase the maximum size of full-
term embryos in utero; however, questions remain regarding whether
the other lamniform sharks nourish their embryos in the same way.

four embryos (1028–1072 mm TL) in the left uterus, 5050 mm TL, 1476 kg
BW, incidentally caught by coastal set-net off Yomitan, Okinawa
Prefecture, 1 February 2016. Specimens with catalog numbers have been
preserved and kept in the Okinawa Churashima Foundation (OCF). The
maternal specimen was dissected and only the head region and skin were
retained; tissues were taken for genetic analysis.
Methods
The individual (OCF-P 20140213-1) was caught as by-catch of a set-net off
Yomitan Village, Okinawa Prefecture on 13 February 2014, and samples
were collected from the specimen within 24 h.
Proportional measurements of both the mother and embryos were taken as
listed in Table 1. Total volume of uterine fluid was measured after dissection,
though a considerable amount of the fluid was lost when the specimen was
transported in a sling by crane before observation. Embryos were preserved
in a 10% formalin solution and two weeks later stored in 80% ethanol
solution. Though the expanded stomach of the white shark embryo was
originally filled with liquid, the liquid had depleted by the time the embryos
were taken from the uterus. Thus, we estimated the approximate volume of
the liquid, assuming that the expanded stomach is a simple spheroid shape
with its long axis parallel to the body. The equation we used was
V ¼
1
6p C2D;
where V (ml) is liquid volume, C (cm) is circumference around the stomach
at the middle half of the stomach, and D (cm) is the antero-posterior depth of
the stomach. Circumferences were acquired using a measuring tape; antero-
posterior depths were acquired using hand caliper.
For the histological and histochemical observations, tissue samples
(approximately 1×1×4 cm) were collected from various parts of the right
ovary and left uterus. After overnight fixation with Bouin’s solution, these
were dehydrated in a series of ethanol concentrations, xylene, and finally
mounted in paraffin. The tissues were sectioned into 7-µm-thick sections.
Sections for standard histology were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
For the detection of aldehyde and mucosubstances sections were stained
with the microscopy Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining kit (Merck,
Germany, Cat. No. 1016460001) according to the standard protocol. The
epithelial tissues from some parts of the uterus were fixed with Karnovsky’s
solution (Karnovsky, 1965). After the fixation, tissues were also post-fixed
with 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) cacodylate buffer. After dehydration,
they were embedded in the epoxy resin. One-µm sections were stained with
toluidine blue solution to detect lipid secretions in the tissues.
