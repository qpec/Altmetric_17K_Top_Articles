Abstract
Background
High amounts of time spent sitting can increase cardiovascular disease risk and are deleteri-
ously associated cardio-metabolic risk biomarkers. Though evidence suggests that accruing
sitting time in prolonged periods may convey additional risk, verification using high-quality
measures is needed. We examined this issue in adults from the Australian Diabetes, Obe-
sity and Lifestyle Study, using accurate measures of sitting accumulation.
Methods
In 2011/12, 739 adults aged 36 to 89 years (mean±SD 58±10 years) wore activPAL3™
monitors (which provide accurate objective measures of sitting); 678 provided �4 valid days
of monitor data and complete cardio-metabolic biomarker and confounder data. Multivari-
able linear regression models examined associations of sitting time, sitting time accrued in
�30 minute bouts (prolonged sitting time), and three measures of sitting accumulation pat-
terns with cardio-metabolic risk markers: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference,
blood pressure, high- and low- density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides,
glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-load glucose
(PLG). Interactions tests examined whether associations of sitting time with biomarkers var-
ied by usual sitting bout duration.

 Results
Adjusted for potential confounders, greater amounts of sitting time and prolonged sitting
time were significantly (p<0.05) deleteriously associated with BMI, waist circumference,
HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. Total sitting time was also significantly associated with
higher PLG. Sitting accumulation patterns of frequently interrupted sitting (compared to pat-
terns with relatively more prolonged sitting) were significantly beneficially associated with
BMI, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, PLG, and with FPG. Effect sizes
were typically larger for accumulation patterns than for sitting time. Significant interactions
(p<0.05) showed that associations of sitting time with HDL, triglycerides and PLG became
more deleterious the longer at a time sitting was usually accumulated.
Conclusions
Adding to previous evidence reliant on low-quality measures, our study showed that accu-
mulating sitting in patterns where sitting was most frequently interrupted had significant ben-
eficial associations with several cardio-metabolic biomarkers and that sitting for prolonged
periods at a time may exacerbate some of the effects of sitting time. The findings support
sedentary behavior guidelines that promote reducing and regularly interrupting sitting.
Introduction
Diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (CVD), on a global scale, account for more than
one in four deaths annually [1]. In addition to lack of physical activity, sedentary behaviors—
defined as time spent sitting or reclining while awake with low energy expenditure [2]—have
emerged as a new risk factor [3–5]. Moreover, time spent sedentary has also been shown to be
detrimentally associated with key biomarkers pertinent to both type 2 diabetes mellitus and
CVD, notably excess adiposity and disordered lipid and glucose metabolism [6,7].
Australian and UK sedentary behavior guidelines [8,9] incorporate messages specifically
targeting the reduction of prolonged sitting—that is, sitting for prolonged periods at a time.
Reducing prolonged sitting time may yield benefits by reducing the total time spent sedentary
and increasing activity, and may convey further benefits that are specific to reducing this type
of sedentary behavior. Experimental studies have shown that by comparison with sitting that
has been interrupted with small amounts of activity, sitting continuously for prolonged periods
has acute detrimental effects on blood pressure and lipid metabolism [10–12] and on post-
prandial glucose control [13,14], with some effects persisting for up to 24 hours [10,15–18].
The observed beneficial effects could be attributed to breaking up sitting into shorter periods
and/or to the small amounts of additional activity. Cross-sectional studies have observed statis-
tically significant, detrimental associations of prolonged sitting time (variously defined) with
waist circumference [19–21], BMI [19–21], HDL-cholesterol [20,21], triglycerides [20], and
diastolic blood pressure [22]. Likewise, this may reflect benefits of sitting less and/or specifi-
cally avoiding sitting for long periods at a time. Contrary to results from experimental studies,
cross-sectional studies have typically not observed significant associations between prolonged
sitting and biomarkers of glucose control [19,21,22].
More rigorous evaluation of the effects of sedentary accumulation patterns is needed to bet-
ter inform whether sedentary behavior guidelines [23] should be placing emphasis on pro-
longed sitting time and regularly interrupting sitting. Sedentary accumulation patterns refer to

 the degree to which sedentary time is accumulated in long, uninterrupted periods versus
shorter, interrupted periods. Variously defined, sedentary accumulation patterns have shown
cross-sectional associations with cardio-metabolic risk biomarkers, including BMI, waist cir-
cumference, insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides [6,17]. Many associations have persisted after
statistical adjustment for the amount of time spent sedentary [7,20,22,24–26], suggesting that
not all of the effects of prolonged sedentary accumulation patterns are produced by a greater
amount of sedentary time they likely entail. When examined separately as time spent in long
and short sedentary bouts, the effects of sedentary time have typically appeared larger for time
spent in long bouts [19,21]. However, verification with valid measures is needed, as nearly all
of the evidence regarding sedentary accumulation patterns has been derived using low-validity
measures [27,28].
Using data from an activity monitor with good validity for measuring both sedentary
behavior and sedentary accumulation patterns [27,29,30], we examined sedentary accumula-
tion patterns in relation to cardio-metabolic biomarkers in a population-based study of Aus-
tralian adults aged 35 years and over (n = 678). Specifically, we tested associations of sitting
time, prolonged sitting time and sitting accumulation patterns with cardio-metabolic bio-
markers. We also tested whether sitting time has associations with cardio-metabolic biomark-
ers that vary depending on how long at a time the sitting time was usually accumulated.
Methods
Sample and design
The Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle study (AusDiab) is a national, population-
based cohort study established to understand the distribution and determinants of diabetes
and other cardiovascular risk factors. Details of the original sampling methods and response
rates are presented elsewhere [31]. Briefly, in 1999–2000, 11,247 adults aged �25 years com-
pleted questionnaires and underwent biomedical assessments. Participants were followed up
in 2004–2005 [32] and again in 2011–2012 [33], with 4,562 adults (all now aged >35 years)
attending one of the 46 testing centers across Australia in the 2011–2012 follow-up. Partici-
pants were ineligible for the 2011–2012 follow up if they requested not to be contacted, were
deceased, moved overseas, or if they were severely/terminally ill and/or moved into a nursing
facility classified for high care. A sub-sample of 1,014 participants attending the 2011–2012
onsite assessment were invited to join an ancillary study described in detail elsewhere [34]
where participants were asked to wear activity monitors, including the activPAL3™, for seven
consecutive days (beginning the next day). A total of 782 adults (77%) agreed to participate.
Pregnant and/or non-ambulatory participants were not eligible for the ancillary study. All par-
ticipants provided informed written consent. Protocols for the study were approved by the
Alfred Health Human Ethics Committee (project no. 39/11).
Measures
Cardio-metabolic outcomes.
Upon arrival to the testing center, a fasting blood sample
was drawn from each participant by venipuncture. Serum triglycerides, high-density lipopro-
tein (HDL) and total cholesterol were assayed by enzymatic methods. Low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol was estimated using the Freidewald equation [35]. Glycated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography method (Bio-Rad Vari-
ance Hemoglobin Testing System; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Participants underwent a 75
g oral glucose tolerance test unless it was contraindicated (e.g., pregnancy, taking medication
for diabetes). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-load glucose (PLG) were deter-
mined by the hexokinase method using a Seimens Advia 2400 (Siemens AG, Munich,

 Germany). All blood specimens were analyzed at a central laboratory operated by Healhscope
Pathology in Clayton, Victoria. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were each calculated as
the mean of the first two (of three) readings from an automated sphygmomanometer (Dina-
map DP 101-NIBP; GE Medical Systems, Freiburg, Germany) after � 5 minutes rest. Body
mass index (BMI; kg/m2) was calculated from height and weight, measured to the nearest 0.5
cm and 0.1 kg (respectively) with participants removing shoes and excess clothing. Waist cir-
cumference was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm by tape measure between the lowest point on
the ribs and the iliac crest on a horizontal plane, using the mean of two measures (or three
measures, when the first two differed by � 2 cm).
Minimum differences of interest (MDI) for the cardio-metabolic biomarkers, selected in
discussion with a clinician to reflect clinically meaningful differences, were: 5% BMI (i.e., 1.36
kg/m2); 2 cm waist circumference; 5% HDL- and LDL-cholesterol (i.e., 0.08 and 0.15 mmol/L,
respectively); 10% triglycerides (i.e., 0.11 mmol/L); 5 mmHg systolic blood pressure; 3 mmHg
diastolic blood pressure; and 10% FPG, PLG and HbA1c (i.e., 0.54, 0.56, and 0.57 mmol/mol,
respectively) [34].
Potential confounders.
Socio-demographic, behavioral, and health-related characteristics
measured by interviewer-administered questionnaire are described elsewhere [31] and listed
in S1 Table. Overall energy intake (MJ/day), fiber intake (g/day), alcohol consumption (g/day),
sodium intake (mg/day), and percentage of energy intake derived from fat and saturated fat
were measured using the 80-item Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies v2 [36].
Sedentary time and sedentary accumulation patterns.
Being sedentary a certain number
of times (bout frequency), each for a certain period (bout duration), adds up to the total vol-
ume of sedentary time [37] and, collectively, bout frequency and bout duration constitute sed-
entary accumulation patterns. There is no universally accepted indicator of sedentary
accumulation. Most studies have examined “breaks” in sedentary time, which is a measure of
how often people sit (when not accounting for sitting time) or of how often a certain amount
of sedentary time is interrupted with activity (when accounting for the amount of sitting
time). We examined three indicators of sedentary accumulation: transitioning from a seated to
upright posture (sit-stand transitions, a similar concept to “breaks”), usual bout duration (also
known as w50 or x50), and alpha [38]. Usual bout duration and alpha are theoretically sound
measures of sedentary accumulation based on the distribution of sedentary bout duration
[37,38] that each have slightly different measurement properties [37]. Usual bout duration is
the midpoint of the cumulative distribution of sedentary bout durations (S1 Fig) [37,38]. Half
of all sedentary time is accumulated in bouts longer than the usual bout duration. Alpha is a
unitless measure that characterizes the frequency distribution of sedentary bout durations (S1
Fig) [38]. Lower values of alpha indicate sedentary time has been accumulated in relatively
more long bouts and relatively fewer short bouts.
All of the activity measures were collected using the thigh-worn activPAL3™ monitor,
which has high accuracy for measuring time spent sitting, standing, stepping and sitting accu-
mulation patterns [27,29,39]. Rather than using the term sedentary, as this monitor specifically
measures sitting, we refer to our results in terms of sitting time, prolonged sitting time (here,
time spent sitting continuously for �30 minutes) and sitting accumulation patterns. The pro-
tocols and data processing procedures are described previously [34]. Briefly, participants were
asked to wear the monitor 24 hours per day, and record sleep and monitor removals in a diary.
Data were downloaded and initially processed using activPAL software version 6.4.1 (PAL
Technologies Limited, Glasgow, UK) using default settings. Time spent sleeping, monitor
non-wear, and invalid days (wear for <80% of waking hours and waking wear time <10 hours
when diary data on sleep were missing) were removed using the diary and monitor data. Totals
each day, averaged across valid days, were obtained for the number of sit-stand transitions and

 time spent: sitting; sitting in �30 min bouts; standing; stepping; and, stepping at � 3 METs
(i.e., moderate to vigorous physical activity; MVPA). The residuals method [40,41] was used to
correct sitting time, prolonged sitting time, and MVPA for waking wear time, and to correct
sit-stand transitions for sitting time. The accumulation measures were calculated as outlined
elsewhere [38,42] (and detailed in S1 Fig).
Statistical analyses
Out of the initial monitor subsample (n = 782), only participants who wore the monitor
(n = 741) for at least four valid days (n = 720) who were not pregnant (n = 718) and provided
data on covariates and outcomes (n = 678, and n = 639 for PLG) were included. All statistical
analyses were performed using Stata 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) using line-
arized variance estimation to account for the survey design of AusDiab3. Significance was set
at p<0.05 (two-tailed).
Multivariable linear regression was used to model the associations with each cardio-meta-
bolic outcome of the prolonged sitting time and sitting accumulation patterns, adjusting for
age, gender, and potential confounders. Results for sitting time have been reported previously
[34] and are included here to place the effect sizes observed for prolonged sitting time and sit-
ting accumulation patterns in context. Log transformation was used to improve the normality
of BMI, triglycerides, HbA1c, glucose, and PLG. The sitting-related exposures were all exam-
ined as quintiles, with the first quintile (Q1; the referent category) always denoting the most
time spent sitting or most prolonged (i.e., least interrupted) sitting accumulation pattern (see
S2 Table). From the linear regression models, we report on pairwise comparisons of marginal
means with all covariates set to their mean values, overall p-values, and p-for-trend. Potential
confounders (S1 Table) were determined for each outcome using backwards elimination
(p<0.20 for retention). Detrimental effects on biomarkers may occur through sitting displac-
ing MVPA and via increases in body weight. Though MVPA and BMI could be confounders
and/or causal intermediates, they were treated as the latter and therefore not adjusted as poten-
tial confounders in the main analyses [43]. MVPA-adjusted results are in S5 and S6 Tables to
allow comparison to results of prior research and assess how sensitive conclusions were to the
choice to adjust or not adjust. Age and gender interactions were explored in all models with a
strict level of significance of p<0.001 because of the large number of tests performed.
Models do not adjust for sitting time as a confounder [44] because increasing the volume of
sitting is one of the ways in which sitting for long periods may impact biomarkers. Instead, we
tested whether the associations with the biomarker outcomes of sitting time (h/day, mean-cen-
tered) varied by usual bout duration (minutes, mean-centered) using interaction terms. Inter-
actions meeting a generous threshold of p<0.1 were reported. To better describe the
magnitude of any interaction detected, we report what the effects each hour per day of sitting
time were when accumulated in “very long” and “very short” bouts. The mean value of Q1 and
Q5 were used to represent “very long” and “very short” bouts.
Results
The analytic sample included 678 adults (n = 639 for analyses of PLG) with a mean age (± SD)
of 57.8±9.8 years, after excluding participants who were pregnant or had any missing data
(Table 1). Additional participant characteristics are described in Table 1 and S3 Table.
Fig 1 depicts participants’ sitting accumulation patterns (bout frequency and bout duration)
in relation to total sitting volume. The longer at a time that participants usually accumulated
their sitting, typically the fewer the number of sitting bouts. An increase in either bout fre-
quency or bout duration appeared to be non-linearly related to accruing a greater amount of

 sitting time. Sitting times of 6 to <10 h/day were seen over a diverse range and combination of
sitting bout frequencies and durations. Notably, sitting times of 10 h/day or more almost
exclusively occurred with above-average usual bout duration. Sitting times of < 6 h/day almost
exclusively occurred when participants had both fewer and shorter bouts than average.

 Associations with cardio-metabolic biomarkers
Table 2 shows the associations of daily sitting time, prolonged sitting time, and sitting accumula-
tion patterns with measures of adiposity and lipid measures. BMI and waist circumference
decreased significantly across increasing quintiles of each of the measures. Mean differences
(95% CI) between the top and bottom quintiles (Q5 versus Q1) were often of a sizeable magni-
tude (i.e., equivalent to the MDI or greater), ranging from -1.34 (-2.55, -0.13) to -3.54 (-4.90,
-2.18) kg/m2 for BMI and -3.48 (-6.69, -0.27) to -10.54 (-13.93, -7.16) cm for waist circumfer-
ence. The observed differences were largest by alpha and smallest by sitting time. Only sitting
time, prolonged sitting time, and alpha showed significant associations with HDL-cholesterol

 and triglycerides. These observed differences were also sizeable, ranging 0.14–0.15 mmol/L
(HDL-cholesterol) and 0.20–0.29 mmol/L triglycerides. Associations of the other sitting accumu-
lation measures with HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were also beneficial in direction, but
weaker and non-significant. No significant associations were observed with LDL cholesterol.
Table 3 shows the results for blood pressure and glucose. All associations with blood pres-
sure and HbA1c were small (i.e., less than the MDI) and not statistically significant. Only
alpha showed a statistically significant association with FPG; a small difference favoring pat-
terns with more interrupted sitting (-0.20, 95% CI: -0.36, -0.04 mmol/L for Q5 versus Q1) was
observed. Significantly lower PLG was observed with less sitting time (-0.50, 95% CI: -0.85,
-0.14 mmol/L for Q5 versus Q1) and higher alpha (-0.64, 95% CI: -1.00, -0.29 mmol/L for Q5
versus Q1).
None of the associations reported in Tables 2 and 3 differed by age or gender at p<0.001 (S4
Table). Mostly, the associations reported in Tables 2 and 3 were only partially attenuated by sta-
tistical adjustment for MVPA (S5 and S6 Tables). Complete loss of significance was observed
only for associations of usual bout duration with adiposity, and of sitting time with PLG.
Effect modification by usual bout duration
Usual sitting bout duration significantly modified associations of sitting time with HDL-cho-
lesterol (p = 0.005), triglycerides (p = 0.032), and PLG (p = 0.042) (S7 Table). In all instances,
sitting time showed associations with biomarkers that were more strongly detrimental the lon-
ger at a time that sitting time was usually accumulated (Fig 2). For example, at an average
usual bout duration (26.2 minutes), each hour per day spent sitting was associated with 0.04
(95% CI: 0.03, 0.06) mmol/L lower HDL cholesterol (Fig 2). By contrast, this lowering of HDL
cholesterol with each hour per day spent sitting was 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.04) mmol/L with sit-
ting time usually accumulated in very short bouts and 0.07 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.09) mmol/L with
sitting time usually accumulated in very long bouts (Fig 2).
Discussion
This study evaluated sedentary accumulation in relation to cardio-metabolic biomarkers in a
large, general population sample of adults. To our knowledge, this study is among the first to

 examine this topic with accurate measures of sitting accumulation [37,38]. Many of the previ-
ous findings concerning sedentary accumulation that had been established with low-validity
measures were corroborated. Although sitting many times per day and accumulating sitting
time in long bouts were both relevant in terms of how much sitting time adults ultimately
accrued, additional time spent sitting did not appear to be the only relevant correlate of pro-
longed accumulation patterns.
The only other study of which the authors are aware that has tested associations of patterns
with adult cardiometabolic biomarker outcomes using high-quality measures of sitting pat-
terns was the Maastricht Study [45]. Adjusting only for confounders, not competing time uses,
the authors found that sitting patterns (measured as breaks, number of �30 min sitting bouts
and average sitting bout duration) had statistically significant associations with both metabolic
syndrome and glucose metabolism status (normal, impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose
tolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus). Effects typically indicated the healthiest participants had
the most interrupted sedentary patterns though associations were not significant with all of the
pattern measures. A meta-analysis of associations between adiposity and sedentary accumula-
tion patterns concluded that there is “some certainty” that more interrupted patterns (specifi-
cally, more breaks in sedentary time) are significantly associated with lower BMI and, with less
certainty, smaller waist circumference [17]. These same associations were present using our
three indicators of sitting accumulation patterns. Previously, a review had concluded there was
“some evidence” that sedentary accumulation patterns are associated with triglycerides and
there was “inconclusive evidence” of an association with HDL-cholesterol [6]. Our findings
were in favor of an association with both cardio-metabolic biomarkers. Consistent with prior
studies [21,22], we did not observe significant associations of sitting accumulation patterns
with LDL cholesterol. The null results for HbA1c were consistent with the typically null results
in the extant literature [19,21] and our null results for blood pressure did not conflict with
prior results, which are mixed [19,22,24,46]. Despite the potential biases in previous findings,
our findings with high-quality measures did not contradict any of the previous conclusions
regarding these biomarkers.
The greatest dissimilarity between our findings and the extant literature based on observa-
tional studies was for glucose metabolism. In most—but not all [22,24]—previous cross-sec-
tional research, significant associations of sedentary accumulation patterns with FPG and PLG
have not been observed [6]. Notably, our findings were dependent on the accumulation mea-
sure employed; both these associations were detected only with alpha. Similarly, in the Maas-
tricht study, associations with glucose metabolism were not significant for “breaks” as a
measure but were significant for average bout duration and number of prolonged bouts [45].
It is possible that different indicators of accumulation patterns may have different capabilities
to detect true effects, and different susceptibilities to unmeasured confounders. Alternatively,
our findings could be an aberration or the result of multiple hypothesis testing.
Though the adjustment or non-adjustment for MVPA is a contentious issue on both epide-
miologic and statistical grounds [43,47], it did not appear to strongly affect what conclusions
were drawn in our study concerning sedentary accumulation patterns. Adjustment for MVPA
(not a procedure we advocate in general) led to only partial attenuation of results—seldom to
complete loss of statistical significance. The limited degree of attenuation also suggests that the
beneficial associations with cardio-metabolic biomarkers that we observed for our sitting-
related exposures are likely to involve mechanisms other than those induced by, or operating
through, additional MVPA. By contrast, causation more generally, particularly as concerns
adiposity, remains unresolved and is important to establish in further research with longitudi-
nal and/or experimental designs. Many of our findings could be explained by heavier body-
weight inducing individuals to transition between postures less frequently.

 The present study provides some evidence to support prolonged sitting as a specific target
of sedentary reduction messages. Waist circumference, BMI, HDL cholesterol and triglycer-
ides were significantly associated with sitting time and prolonged sitting time. PLG was further
significantly associated with total sitting time. Although effect sizes for these outcomes were
similar when examining sitting and prolonged sitting, rather than suggesting all types of sitting
are the same, this likely reflects the problems in examining only one subtype of sitting in isola-
tion. Comparing participants according to their sitting accumulation patterns consistently
showed greater differences between the top and bottom quintiles than either sitting or pro-
longed sitting time, especially by the alpha measure. Crucially, the longer at a time participants
accumulated their sitting, the stronger the effects of each hour per day of sitting time on several
biomarkers (HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and PLG). This is consistent with the previous
research that has aimed to examine or compare short and long sedentary bouts [19,21], but
has been limited by the reliance on low-quality measures and other analytic issues, including
the somewhat arbitrary divisions between short and long bouts. Though generally supportive
that being sedentary for longer periods at a time may magnify the health risks of sedentary
time, more research is needed to develop specific recommendations, such as how long is too
long to be sitting without taking a break.
Measurement quality of the exposure variables was a key study strength. The exposure vari-
ables were measured over a requested 7-days, which is sufficient to produce reliable measures
of total sedentary time over a 3-year period [48]. That said, to date, no studies have assessed the
degree to which measures from a 7-day sedentary accumulation pattern measurement protocol
reflect longer-term patterns of behavior and our results should be interpreted in consideration
of this potential limitation. Future studies should consider longer measurement protocols. Key
limitations were the cross-sectional design, which makes results subject to reverse-causality bias
(e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and/or BMI could cause prolonged patterns of sitting
accumulation), and the sample size, which was not chosen a priori and sometimes provided
insufficient precision as indicated by the 95% confidence intervals of some associations that
were not statistically significant containing effects of a magnitude � MDIs. The sample, though
covering a broad cross-section of Australian adults, was not population representative, with
loss to follow-up prior to this third wave of data collection, and some biases in the subsampling
and subsample participation, [34] with potential consequences both to internal and external
validity. Residual confounding may exist from unmeasured variables and variables measured
with error (e.g., educational status was not current as at 2011/12). Many hypotheses were tested,
and some results could be spurious. Of all the findings, the most caution is warranted concern-
ing glucose—the literature has mixed findings and our results varied depending on the measure
and statistical adjustment choices. In general, the internal consistency within this study in the
direction of the associations and the similarity between our findings and those of other studies
suggest that most of our findings are sound.
This study adds important, robust evidence to a growing body of research supporting that
in addition to high volumes of time spent sitting, the manner in which sitting time is accumu-
lated has relevance for key areas of cardiovascular and metabolic health—lipid metabolism,
glucose metabolism, and adiposity. Evidence concerning causation for long-term effects, such
as from longitudinal and/or long-term intervention studies, is needed.
