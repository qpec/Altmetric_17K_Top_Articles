Gut dysbiosis during inflammatory bowel disease involves alterations in the gut microbiota associated with inflamma-
tion of the host gut. We used a combination of shotgun metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics to analyze fecal
samples from pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease and found an association between disease severity, gut dysbiosis,
and bacterial production of free amino acids. Nitrogen flux studies using 15N in mice showed that activity of bacterial
urease, an enzyme that releases ammonia by hydrolysis of host urea, led to the transfer of murine host-derived nitro-
gen to the gut microbiota where it was used for amino acid synthesis. Inoculation of a conventional murine host (pre-
treated with antibiotics and polyethylene glycol) with commensal Escherichia coli engineered to express urease led to
dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, resulting in a predominance of Proteobacteria species. This was associated with a
worsening of immune-mediated colitis in these animals. A potential role for altered urease expression and nitrogen
flux in the development of gut dysbiosis suggests that bacterial urease may be a potential therapeutic target for in-
flammatory bowel diseases.
INTRODUCTION
The gut hosts a dense microbial community that responds to envi-
ronmental stressors such as diet (1, 2), antibiotic use (3), inflammation
of the intestinal tract (4–6), and infection of the host with enteric
pathogens. The term “dysbiosis” refers to the alteration of microbiota
composition when it is associated with a host disease state. When
characterized in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs),
such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, the dysbiotic microbiota
often shows a decrease in richness and an increase in taxa belonging to
the Proteobacteria phylum. This is typically associated with an increase
in facultative anaerobes such as Enterobacteriaceae and a decrease in
Firmicutes, particularly of the Clostridium clade (7). By studying the gut
microbiota in pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease, we have recently
shown that multiple factors such as diet, antibiotic use, and intestinal
inflammation each independently contribute to the development of
gut dysbiosis (5, 6, 8, 9).
Although intestinal inflammation may contribute to dysbiosis, chron-
ic alteration of the gut microbiota may also play a role in perpetuating
inflammation (8–10). The Proteobacteria phylum is enriched in intestinal
pathogens, and several have been shown to cause intestinal inflammation
in animal models of IBD (11–13). Reduced abundance of Firmicutes,
principally Clostridia, may reduce the production of short-chain fatty
acids (SCFAs) that are known to augment regulatory T cells that support
immune tolerance in the intestinal mucosa (14, 15). These observations
have led to a growing interest in reversing the dysbiotic microbiota and
augmenting the production of microbial metabolites such as SCFAs as a
therapeutic modality. Potentially supporting this idea, a randomized
controlled trial demonstrated the potential of fecal microbiota transplan-
tation in patients with ulcerative colitis (16).
The biological mechanisms responsible for the development of
dysbiosis remain incompletely characterized. The outgrowth of faculta-
tive anaerobic organisms has led some to hypothesize that dysbiosis
results from an alteration in redox potential in the gut associated with
intestinal inflammation (17). An alternative hypothesis is that inflam-
mation may result in host production of small molecules such as nitrate,
which serve as electron acceptors that facilitate anaerobic respiration
(18). Evidence that nitrogen metabolism may play a role in the devel-
opment of dysbiosis in IBD comes from the Pediatric Longitudinal
Study of Elemental Diet and Stool Microbiome Composition (PLEASE)
study (5). Here, gene pathway analysis of shotgun metagenomic se-
quencing data revealed an association of Crohn’s disease with sulfur
relay systems and nitrogen metabolism. Both of these pathways are
involved in nitrogen utilization by bacteria, particularly in Proteo-
bacteria (19), a prominent phylogenetic signature of a dysbiotic gut mi-
crobiota (4).
To investigate the possible role of nitrogen metabolism in the devel-
opment of dysbiosis, we performed an untargeted metabolomic analysis
of fecal samples obtained from participants in the PLEASE study. The
results showed that fecal amino acids were associated with Crohn’s dis-
ease andpositively correlatedwithincreasingdiseaseactivity. Fecalamino
acids and their derivatives were also positively associated with taxa in the
Proteobacteria phylum, such as Escherichia, Klebsiella, Haemophilus,
and Proteus, all of which have been associated with gut microbiota

 dysbiosis in patients with IBD (7, 20, 21). These bacterial lineages also
induce intestinal inflammation in animal models of IBD (11, 12, 22).
Ammonia, a product of urea hydrolysis produced by bacterial urease
in the mammalian intestinal tract, is a major source of nitrogen for
bacteria. To track nitrogen metabolism by the gut microbiota, we used
15N-labeled urea to trace nitrogen incorporation into amino acids by
bacteria in a mouse model and then focused on the role of urease en-
zymatic activity. Using our recently described method for altering the
gut microbiota in previously colonized mouse hosts (23), we show that
inoculation of a single aerotolerant bacterial species, Escherichia coli,
into conventional mice pretreated with antibiotics and polyethylene gly-
col(PEG)alteredthe gut microbiotaina mannerdependenton thepres-
ence or absence of a bacterial urease gene. The presence of urease led to a
dysbiotic microbiota with enhanced abundance of Proteobacteria taxa
and a reciprocal decrease in Firmicutes (namely, Clostridia); in contrast,
inoculation of mice with urease-negative (Ure−) E. coli did not lead to
dysbiosis. Finally, we demonstrated the functional consequences of the
dysbiotic microbiota engineered through inoculation of a urease-positive
(Ure+)E.colistrainbyshowingexacerbationofdiseaseinaTcelladoptive
transfermouse modelof colitis(24).The abilityto engineerthe mouse gut
microbiota into either a dysbiotic or a more normal configuration by the
inoculation of a single aerotolerant taxon with or without urease enzy-
matic activity provides a proof of concept that a single defined bacterial
strain can reconfigure the gut microbiota.
RESULTS
The presence of amino acids in fecal microbiota from
patients with Crohn’s disease positively correlates with
disease activity
Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we previously reported the
characterization of the fecal microbiome of 90 pediatric patients with
Crohn’s disease receiving either anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or
dietary therapy and compared these data to those from 26 healthy con-
trol children (5). An analysis of gene pathways using Random Forest
showed that sulfur relay systems, nitrogen metabolism, and several
biosynthetic pathways for amino acids were enriched in the Crohn’s
disease fecal samples (5). Here, we performed an untargeted fecal
metabolomic analysis on these samples using liquid chromatography–
mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and identified 341 known small molecules.
Nearly all of the molecules that fell into the category “Amino acids and
their derivatives” were statistically significantly associated with Crohn’s
disease [false discovery rate (FDR)–adjusted P < 0.05] (Fig. 1A). This
was confirmed using quantitative high-performance LC (HPLC)
(fig. S1A). Dietary intake of protein was explored as a possible explana-
tion for the association between fecal amino acids and Crohn’s disease,
but there was no significant difference based on 24-hour dietary recalls
performed at study entry (P = 0.79; fig. S1B).

(Fig. 1B and fig. S1C). It was not possible to determine the contributions
of the host versus the gut microbiota to the quantities of fecal amino
acids and their derivatives measured. However, the reduction in the
positive correlation between fecal calprotectin and the quantities of fecal
amino acids and their derivatives associated with antibiotic treatment of
the pediatric patients (fig. S1, C and D) suggested that the presence of
increased fecal amino acids in pediatric Crohn’s disease patients was, in
part, due to the gut microbiota.

 the gut microbiota, defined by gut bacterial composition and gene types,
that we previously labeled as “cluster 2” (Fig. 1B) (5). Further evaluation
demonstrated that concentrations of fecal amino acids and their deriva-
tives from pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease positively correlated
with the abundance of Proteobacteria (Fig. 2). Bacteria of this phylum
are associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis in IBD (7, 20, 21) and have
been shown to exacerbate colitis in animal models of immunologically
mediated intestinal inflammation (11, 12, 22). These findings are con-
sistent with our previously reported observations of positive associations
between dysbiosis in Crohn’s disease and enrichment of bacterial genes
for nitrogen metabolism and amino acid synthesis (5).
Bacterial urease promotes the flux of nitrogen into amino
acids synthesized by the murine gut microbiota
The gut microbiota plays an essential role in nitrogen flux. Bacterial ure-
ase hydrolyzes host-derived urea in the colon into ammonia that is sub-
sequently absorbed by the host or used by the microbiota as a nitrogen
source. To investigate the role of bacterial urease in microbial amino
acid synthesis, we administered isotopically labeled [15N2]urea via oral
gavage to three groups of mice: (i) healthy control mice colonized with a
conventional murine gut microbiota, (ii) mice treated with antibiotics
(ABX) and PEG to deplete their endogenous gut microbiota (23), and
(iii) mice treated with ABX/PEG and then inoculated with altered
Schaedler flora (ASF), a defined consortium of eight murine commensal
bacteria with minimal urease gene content (23). 16S rRNA gene-tagged
sequencing of fecal pellets from mice in group 3 confirmed effective
engraftment, as previously described (Fig. 3A) (23). We then collected
fecal pellets and used liquid/gas chromatography–MS to measure atom
percent excess of 15N in fecal amino acids. Given that bacterial urease is
necessary for the hydrolysis of [15N2]urea into 15NH3 and that lysine
does not undergo transamination via host utilization of 15NH3, the de-
tection of [15N]lysine in the mouse feces could be attributed solely to
synthesis by bacteria (25). Relative to control mice colonized with
conventional microbiota, ASF-inoculated mice showed significant-
ly lower quantities of fecal [15N]lysine (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). These
quantities were comparable to the reduction observed in the feces
of ABX/PEG-treated mice and thus demonstrate the importance
of urease in the flux of nitrogen for amino acid synthesis by the gut
microbiota.
Reduction of gut bacterial load promotes the establishment
of a new steady state in colonized mice
Wehave previouslyshownthat thecombineduseof antibioticsand PEG
reduces the endogenous bacterial load in the murine gut (23) and that
this reduction is required for engraftment of a defined bacterial consor-
tium. To determine the effects of different host preparations on the gut
microbiota, we administered PEG, antibiotics, or a combination of
antibiotics and PEG (ABX/PEG) to three different groups of mice.
Treatment with antibiotics in the presence or absence of PEG led to
alterations in mouse gut microbiota composition, as measured by un-
weighted UniFrac (26) distances (Fig. 4A); PEG alone was not suf-
ficient to induce these alterations.
For this reason, the difference in the composition of the mouse gut
microbiota at day 30 after antibiotics versus ABX/PEG treatment was
unlikely to be a result of PEG treatment. Rather, the reduction in mi-
crobiota biomass by antibiotic treatment could have allowed the devel-
opment of a different community state that was dependent on cage
effects. Cage effects, where mice housed in the same cage share a similar
gut microbiota due to mixing by coprophagia, constitute a large source
of variance in murine studies (17, 27, 28). To distinguish between these
two mechanisms, we analyzed the composition of the mouse gut micro-
biota in three additional cages where mice were treated with ABX/PEG.
Although the composition of the microbiota after 1 month was signif-
icantly different from the baseline in each cage, there were significant
differences at 1 month between the three cages (fig. S2). These results
suggest that our gut-cleansing protocol resulted in a permissive en-
vironment, leading to the development of a new community state
determined by cage environment. This implies that inoculation of the
mouse host with specific organisms after ABX/PEG treatment may pro-
vide a method for engineering a new community state in a consistent
fashion.
Although antibiotics have been shown to alter the composition of
the human gut microbiota, their effect on reducing bacterial load has
not been fully quantified (3). Treatment of five adult human subjects
with three antibiotics (rifaximin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and
metronidazole) over 3 days showed no effect on bacterial load as quan-
tified by 16S rRNA gene copy number in stool samples (Fig. 4B). There
was a surprisingly small effect on the composition of the human gut mi-
crobiota,withthe dominant effectbeing intersubject variability (Fig.4C).
However, using a similar protocol in our human subjects as used in our
mouse studies, that is,two antibiotics(vancomycinandneomycin)taken

Downloaded from 
 for 3 days, with PEG taken on the second day, we observed a marked
reduction in both culturable bacteria and 16S rRNA gene copy number
of about4to 5logsafter72hours(P<0.01)(Fig.4D)(23).The difference
between a 5-log decrease in culturable bacteria and a 2-log decrease in
16S rRNA gene copy number at 48 hours likely represented residual
DNA in the gut lumen from nonviable bacteria that were cleared from
the gut with the PEG purge by day 4. These results suggest that a specific
ABX/PEG protocol may be needed to prepare the human gut for inoc-
ulation and engineering of the gut microbiota.
Bacterial urease alters the composition of an engineered gut
microbiota in colonized mice
We hypothesized that the bacterial enzyme urease may influence the
gut microbiota after ABX/PEG treatment. As noted above, the dys-
biotic gut microbiome in pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease was
associated with expression of genes involved in bacterial nitrogen
metabolism (5). In addition, we observed a positive correlation be-
tween the severity of Crohn’s disease in these patients, fecal amino
acid concentrations, and bacterial taxa associated with dysbiosis
(Figs. 1 and 2, and fig. S1). This led us to hypothesize a role for ure-
ase enzymatic activity in shaping the dysbiotic microbiota, given its
importance in bacterial nitrogen flux, ammonia production, and the
subsequent incorporation of ammonia into bacterial amino acids
(Fig. 3).
We have previously shown that aerotolerant organisms such as
Enterobacteriaceae are the first to colonize the gut after cleansing
(28), a possible consequence of oxygen diffusion into the intestinal
luminal environment (17). We hypothesized that inoculation of the
mouse gut microbiota, after gut cleansing, with E. coli engineered to
express urease could facilitate alterations in the gut microbiota
composition. To test this hypothesis, we engineered a derivative of
the murine commensal E. coli MP1 (29) with the urease operon from
Proteus mirabilis inserted in the chromosome. We used an inducible
urease gene cluster that had previously been shown to be functional
in E. coli (30) and verified urease activity with Christensen’s urea
agar plates (Fig. 5A). Both the wild-type MP1 murine E. coli strain,
which was Ure−, and the engineered Ure+ strain were consecutively
inoculated into mice for 5 days after the depletion of the native gut

 microbiota with ABX/PEG. This gut-cleansing protocol resulted in
successful colonization of the inoculated mice with both Ure− and
Ure+ E. coli MP1 strains for at least 3 months at numbers about
1000-fold greater than those achieved with a different colonization
protocol previously reported in the literature (Fig. 5, B and C) (29).
Successful engraftment of E. coli MP1 resulted in changes in mouse
gut microbiota composition that were dependent on the presence of
urease but independent of caging. We carried out five interventions:
ABX/PEG, ABX/PEG followed by inoculation with the feces of conven-
tionally housed mice, ABX/PEG followed by inoculation with Ure−
MP1, ABX/PEG followed by inoculation with Ure+ MP1, and ABX/
PEG followed by inoculation with a 1:1 mixture of Ure− and Ure+
MP1. Although all of the groups had similar gut microbiota composi-
tions at baseline, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a pronounced
difference among the five groups at day 29 after inoculation (Fig. 5D).
All groups diverged from the ABX/PEG-treated group. Mice inoculated
with conventional murine feces showed a similar gut composition to
the donor, whereas mice that received either Ure+ MP1 or a mixture of
Ure+ and Ure− MP1 showed a gut composition different from those
animals that received Ure− MP1 (Fig. 5D). Using a Mann-Whitney
test, the greatest distance among all pairwise comparisons before
(day 0) and after (day 29) gavage was between cages that had undergone
different treatments (Fig. 5E), indicating that these effects were
independent of caging. Testing for differences between groups using
the permutational multivariate analysis of variance test (fig. S3) revealed
that a number of groups were different at baseline (fig. S3), although
with a small effect size (R2 < 0.15). However, the differences between
groups increased markedly on day 29, all of which were statistically sig-
nificant (P < 0.05). The Ure+ MP1– and Ure+/Ure− MP1–inoculated
mice were most similar among the groups and had the smallest effect
size between them. They were very different from the mice inoculated
with conventional murine feces (R2 > 0.4), the ABX/PEG group (R2 >
0.3), and the Ure− MP1 group (R2 > 0.25), all with large effect sizes.
These data suggest that E. coli can function as a keystone species that
allows for the establishment of a stable microbiome (31) when inocu-
lated into a properly prepared host and that the presence of the urease
gene influences the composition of the new gut microbiota.

 and fig. S4. The Ure− MP1–inoculated gut microbial community had
higher proportions of taxa belonging to the Firmicutes phylum, including
order Clostridiales, genus Ruminococcus, genus Dorea, genus Oscillospira,
genus Peptostreptococcus, and family Clostridiaceae (fig. S4). Taxa
within each of these clades have been associated with health of the host.
In contrast, the Ure+ MP1–inoculated microbial community had higher
proportions of Proteobacteria that were associated with dysbiosis, in-
cluding family Enterobacteriaceae and family Sphingomonadaceae
(fig. S4). Thus, inserting a single operon encoding bacterial urease in
E. coli MP1 appeared to be sufficient to cause a shift in the inoculated
mouse gut microbiota composition to a dysbiotic state.
To investigate the functional effects of the dysbiotic gut microbiota
engineered by bacterial urease, we examined the effect of inoculation
with either Ure− or Ure+ MP1 on the development of colitis in a T cell
adoptive transfer model of murine colitis (24). Thirty days after Rag−/−
mice were inoculated with the two different MP1 strains, adoptive
transfer of CD45Rbhigh naïve T cells was performed. Initial CFUs for
both strains approximated numbers observed in wild-type mice
(Fig. 6A) but then dropped transiently with a recovery to baseline by
day 44. About 1 month after T cell transfer, mice that were inoculated
with Ure+ MP1 began to lose weight. By day 44 after transfer, these
mice exhibited a 20% loss in weight, triggering euthanasia (Fig. 6B).
Consistent with a greater loss of weight in the Ure+ MP1–inoculated
mice, colonic and cecal weights were increased, and colonic length
was decreased relative to the colons of mice inoculated with Ure−
MP1 (Fig. 6C). Together with a higher clinical colitis disease activity
index (Fig. 6C) (32, 33), these results indicate that inoculation of mice
with Ure+ MP1 led to an exacerbation of colitis. This was confirmed by
histological evidence of more pronounced chronic inflammation in the
colons of mice inoculated with Ure+ MP1 compared to Ure− MP1
(Fig. 6D). The Ure+ MP1–inoculated mice also exhibited an increase in
Enterobacteriaceae and a decrease in Clostridiaceae (fig. S5, A and B).
Consistent with our finding that fecal amino acid quantities were
higher in Crohn’s disease patients with a dysbiotic microbiota (Fig. 1B),
the quantity of fecal amino acids was higher in mice inoculated with
Ure+ MP1 with colitiscompared to those receiving Ure−MP1 (fig. S5C).
These results implicate the dysbiotic microbiota established by inocula-
tion with a commensal E. coli engineered to express a bacterial urease in
the pathogenesis of colitis in a chronic immunologically mediated mu-
rine model of IBD.

 DISCUSSION
If gut microbiota dysbiosis is in the causal pathway of a disease, then
correction of the dysbiosis is a potential therapeutic strategy. Here, we
provide evidence that urease-mediated nitrogen flux into the gut micro-
biota may play an important role in the development of the dysbiotic
microbiota in IBD. We also show that inoculating a properly prepared
murine host with a single aerotolerant commensal bacterial strain ex-
pressing urease caused worsening colitis in an immune-mediated
mouse model.
Gene pathway analysis supports the notion that the gut microbiota
responds to gut environmental stressors principally through the mod-
ification of metabolism. Given that Proteobacteria are increased in
Crohn’s disease and that these bacteria are enriched for genes that pro-
mote utilization of nitrogen, we anticipated that the microbiome in pa-
tients with Crohn’s disease would demonstrate increased abundance of
gene pathways associated with nitrogen metabolism. This was con-
firmed in our gene pathway analysis in which there was increased
representation of gene pathways associated with IBD and dysbiosis
in pediatric Crohn’s disease patients. These included sulfur relay
systems, nitrogen metabolism, and biosynthetic pathways for several
amino acids, all of which are involved in bacterial nitrogen utilization.
For example, the sulfur relay system provides sulfur via L-cysteine
desulfurase for biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactor, as well as other
biomolecules such as thiamin, iron-sulfur clusters, and thionucleosides.
Specifically, we show that various genes encoding enzymes involved in
the synthesis of molybdenum cofactor, which is responsible for catalyzing
redox reactions in the bacterial metabolism of nitrogen, sulfur, and
carbon compounds (34), are associated with both Crohn’s disease and
taxa belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum. In addition, molybdenum
cofactor may also play a role in various nitrate reduction pathways
associated with nitrogen respiration in the setting of intestinal inflam-
mation (18). Whereas the shifts in both bacterial community structure
and gene expression may be linked to a variety of factors, the predom-
inance of the sulfur relay system in the gut microbiome of patients with
Crohn’s disease emphasizes the possible importance of nitrogen metab-
olism in the development of the dysbiotic gut microbiota.
The notion that bacterial nitrogen metabolism plays a role in the
development of dysbiosis is supported by the strong positive correlation
between Proteobacteria taxa found in the dysbiotic microbiota of pa-
tients with IBD (5) and our fecal metabolomic profiling showing a
strong association between dysbiosisand quantitiesof fecal amino acids.
However, one potential limitation of this study is that the metagenomic
data focused on bacteria and not the contribution of fungal microbiome
members (which also encode ureases) to nitrogen cycling in dysbiosis
associated with Crohn’s disease. Nitrogen metabolism pathways have
been extensively characterized in E. coli (35) where the preferred nitro-
gen source is ammonia (36). To provide mechanistic evidence sup-
porting the metagenomic and metabolomic associations between
nitrogen metabolism and fecal amino acid quantities with the dysbiotic
microbiota in Crohn’s disease, we examined the role of urease in bac-
terial nitrogen flux and amino acid synthesis. Urease activity in the gut
microbiota is particularly important for nitrogen flux between the host
and its gut microbiota (37). The catabolism of dietary protein by the
host results in the formation of urea, a nitrogenous waste product that
is excreted through the urine or delivered into the colon, where hydrol-
ysis by bacterial urease results in the production of carbon dioxide and
ammonia. Using [15N2]urea as an isotopic tracer, we provide direct ev-
idence for the importance of bacterial urease and its production of am-
monia for bacterial amino acid synthesis. The quantification of 15N
enrichment specifically in lysine, an amino acid that cannot undergo
mammalian transamination, established that bacteria are responsible
for nitrogen flux from urea into ammonia, resulting in the incorpora-
tion of 15N into amino acids synthesized by bacteria. Having established
the importance of urease in bacterial nitrogen flux and amino acid syn-
thesis in vivo in a mouse model, we then sought to assess the effect of
urease on the composition of the gut microbiota in a mouse host. We
have recently shown that it is possible to engineer the gut microbiota of
conventionally housed mice using ASF, a defined bacterial consortium
of eight organisms (23). Required preparation included administration
of two orally delivered nonabsorbable antibiotics, vancomycin and ne-
omycin, together with a gut-purging agent, PEG. Here, we extend these
findings by showing that antibiotics are critical for reshaping the
composition of the murine gut microbiota because PEG had little effect
on its own. Moreover, in humans, the choice of antibiotics is important
because a combination of three antibiotics administered without PEG
had little impact on bacterial load and microbiota composition, whereas
use of vancomycin, neomycin, and PEG resulted in a 5-log reduction in
bacterial load. Finally, in mice, the composition of the resultant gut mi-
crobiota after gut cleansing was variable and dependent on cage effects.
We inoculated the E. coli MP1 strain, engineered to express urease or
not, into mice after gut cleansing with ABX/PEG. We found that long-
term engraftment of the inoculated bacterial strain was possible,
independent of urease activity. Inoculation with Ure+ E. coli, but not
Ure− E. coli, was sufficient to engineer the murine gut microbiota into
a dysbiotic state characterized by increased proportions of Proteobac-
teria and reduced Firmicutes. A 1:1 mixture of Ure− and Ure+ E. coli also
led to the development of a dysbiotic microbiota, showing dominance
of the Ure+ phenotype. These results demonstrated that the compo-
sition of the gut microbiota can be engineered by altering expression
of a single enzyme in one bacterial lineage when inoculated into a prop-
erly prepared murine host, supporting the importance of nitrogen flux
and metabolism in the development of the dysbiotic gut microbiota.
The worsening of disease in a chronic immune-mediated murine
model of colitis by inoculation with Ure+ MP1 relative to the Ure− strain
provides functional evidence for the relevance of the dysbiosis induced
by urease. Our results may explain why the transfer of specific Entero-
bacteriaceae, namely, Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. mirabilis (both
known to express urease) (38), correlates with the development of colitis
in another chronic T cell–mediated model of colitis (11). Fecal micro-
biota transplantation has been used with mixed results in Crohn’s dis-
ease and ulcerative colitis, a related IBD with similar dysbiosis to that
seen in patients with Crohn’s disease (16, 39–44). Some studies have
identified differential effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation
depending on the donor. It is possible that the inconsistent effectiveness
of fecal microbiota transplantation could be related to inconsistent re-
duction in urease activity because about 15 to 30% of urea produced by
humans is hydrolyzed by microbial ureases (45, 46).
There are limitations to our study. Although there was a clear cor-
relation between fecal amino acids and the dysbiotic gut microbiota
in both IBD and a murine colitis model, it was not possible to de-
termine the degree to which this was due to host versus microbial
biology because it was not technically possible to distinguish between
fecal amino acids derived from the host versus the gut microbiota. In
addition, our mouse models did not provide information about the
mechanism by which bacterial urease induced dysbiosis. However, our
human and murine data do reveal a role for bacterial nitrogen flux
via urease activity in the development of dysbiosis and the patho-
genesis of IBD. These observations will inform gut microbiota–based

 strategies for the treatment of human diseases. It appears to be impor-
tant to reduce microbial load to enhance the engraftment of engi-
neered bacterial consortia. Not all antibiotics influence the bacterial
load and composition in the human gut, but vancomycin and neomy-
cin together with PEG reduced both culturable bacteria and 16S rRNA
gene copy number in humans and mice (23). In addition, human com-
mensal organisms that are available as probiotics might have greater
utility in the treatment of disease when used in combination with a
gut-cleansing protocol. For example, E. coli Nissle, which has been
shown to have modest beneficial effects in ulcerative colitis and lacks
urease activity (47), might be more effective when inoculated into pa-
tients in which bacterial load has been sufficiently diminished. Such a
strategy might enable currently used probiotics, which have minimal
effects on the composition of the human gut microbiota, to confer
more benefits on patients with disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The results reported in this manuscript were generated from a two-part
study where the primary aim was to determine the biological mecha-
nism by which fecal amino acids are correlated with the dysbiotic gut
microbiota in IBD. The first component involved the analysis of
biospecimens collected in a human subject study named PLEASE,
where correlations between fecal amino acids and the dysbiotic gut
microbiota were demonstrated using a combination of metabolomics
and shotgun metagenomic sequencing (5). Details of the PLEASE hu-
man subject prospective study have been previously reported (48). In
brief, enrolled in the PLEASE study were children under the age of
22 with active disease defined as having a Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Ac-
tivity Index score of greater than 10, who were initiating therapy with
PEN, EEN, or anti–TNF-a therapy. Patients had stool samples collected
for determining fecal calprotectin concentration and microbiome char-
acterization at baseline and 1, 4, and 8 weeks after initiation of the treat-
ment. Metabolomic and gene pathway analyses were performed on
baseline stool samples from subjects with Crohn’s disease compared
to healthy controls. In addition, two interventional human subject
studies were performed to determine the effect of various antibiotics
and a PEG gut purge on fecal bacterial biomass using anaerobic culture
and 16S rRNA gene copy number PCR. All human subject studies were
performed with Institutional Review Board (IRB)–approved protocols
that included informed consent.
The second component of this study was designed to determine the
mechanism by which fecal amino acids correlated with dysbiosis in
IBD. Using a combination of heavy isotope nitrogen flux studies, bac-
terial culture experiments, and mouse models, we show that bacterial
urease can lead to the development of dysbiosis that exacerbates
the course of murine experimental colitis. We used in vivo heavy iso-
tope assays using 15N-labeled urea to determine the effect of bacterial
urease on bacterial nitrogen flux, where 15N was incorporated into
bacterial amino acids in a urease-dependent fashion. We then engi-
neered a strain of commensal mouse E. coli to express urease. When
this Ure+ E. coli strain was inoculated into mice that were pretreated
with ABX/PEG, resulting in stable engraftment, it led to the devel-
opment of a dysbiotic gut microbiota with an increase in Proteobac-
teria and a decrease in Clostridia spp. Last, when this Ure+ E. coli strain
was inoculated into Rag−/− mice in which colitis was induced via T cell
transfer, we observed an exacerbation of disease with an increase in
fecal amino acids, providing functional evidence for the relevance of
the dysbiosis induced by bacterial nitrogen flux via a urease-dependent
mechanism.
Animal studies
All animal experiments were performed according to Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee–approved protocols. Mice were
prepared for inoculation by oral delivery of antibiotics in the drinking
water (1 g of aspartame, 0.1 g vancomycin, and 0.2 g of neomycin in
200-ml sterile water) for 72 hours with the addition of PEG 10% (w/v)
for the last 12 hours. For the MP1 experiments, the mice were then in-
oculated daily with the desired E. coli strains by oral gavage for 5 days.
For the T cell adoptive transfer model of colitis, the mice were inocu-
lated with the desired E. coli strains by oral gavage then underwent in-
duction of colitis detailed below at day 30 after gavage. Freshly sorted
CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells from 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were
transferred intraperitoneally into 8-week-old Rag1KO (Rag−/−) mice
on a C57BL/6 background on day 0 per established protocols (24).
15N flux experiments were performed on conventionally housed mice
that had received fecal microbial transplant using ASF (with low urease
activity), as previously described (23). These mice were compared to
mice that were continuously treated with antibiotics (vancomycin and
neomycin) and to control mice. All groups were gavaged with 50 mg of
[15N2]urea per mouse daily for 7 days. 15N enrichment in amino acids
was determined by liquid/gas chromatography–MS and HPLC (49, 50).
Human studies
All studies were performed using IRB-approved protocols. Fecal samples
used for metabolomic studies were collected from pediatric patients
with Crohn’s disease as part of our PLEASE study (5) and from healthy
controls. Fecal samples used to determine the effect of antibiotics on the
bacterial load of the human gut microbiota were obtained from two
independent studies. The AFTER (Impact of Antibiotics on Fecal Bac-
terial Concentration) study was a single-arm clinical trial examining the
composition of the stool microbiome from healthy adult volunteers ex-
posed to 3 days of oral antibiotics [rifaximin (550 mg, orally twice daily)
plus metronidazole (500 mg, orally twice daily) plus trimethoprim/sul-
famethoxazole (160 to 800 mg, orally twice daily)]. In the FARMM (Food
and Resulting Microbial Metabolites) inpatient study, fecal samples were
collected from healthy adult volunteers before, during, and immediately
after a bowel-cleansing protocol consisting of vancomycin (500 mg, every
6 hours) and neomycin (1000 mg, every 6 hours) daily for 3 days with a
PEGpurge(4liters)onday2.AnaerobiccultureconditionsforCFUdeter-
mination of bacterial load were performed as previously described (51).
DNA extraction, 16S rRNA amplification, sequencing,
and analysis
Total DNA was extracted from mouse fecal pellet and bacterial gavage
samples using the MO BIO PowerSoil-htp kit. The first and second
hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene (V1 and V2) were ampli-
fied using Golay-barcoded 27F and 338R primers (52–54). 16S rRNA
amplicons were sequenced using 2 × 250–base pair paired-end reads
on the Illumina MiSeq platform (53, 54). The sequenced 16S rRNA reads
were analyzed using the QIIME software package (55) and the R
programming language.
Metabolomic analyses of fecal samples
Stool samples were homogenized using a bead mill (TissueLyser II,
QIAGEN), and the aqueous homogenates were aliquoted for metabolite
profiling analyses. Four separate LC–tandem MS methods were used to

 measure polar metabolites and lipids in each sample. Methods 1, 2, and
3 were conducted using two LC-MS systems composed of Nexera X2
UHPLC systems (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments) and Q Exactive
Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap MSs (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and
method 4 was conducted using a Nexera X2 UHPLC (Shimadzu
Scientific Instruments) coupled to an Exactive Plus Orbitrap MS (Thermo
Fisher Scientific).
Statistical analysis
Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for two group comparisons, and
Spearman rank correlation was used to assess the association between
two quantitative variables such as taxon abundance and metabolite. To
account for sample heterogeneity between normal and disease samples,
linearregressionanalyseswere appliedtoassessthestatisticalsignificance,
including a disease indicator as a covariate. Linear regression analysis was
also applied to associate the amino acid abundance and fecal calprotectin
measurements adjusting for antibiotic use. Log transformation was ap-
plied to both taxon and metabolite abundances. Finally, FDR was applied
to control for multiple comparisons. Two-tailed Student’s t tests were
used for comparisons of fecal amino acids, atom percent excess, mouse
weights, and clinical end points of colitis.
