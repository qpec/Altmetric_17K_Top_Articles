Abstract Lifestyle choices influence 20–40 % of adult peak
bone mass. Therefore, optimization of lifestyle factors known
to influence peak bone mass and strength is an important
strategy aimed at reducing risk of osteoporosis or low bone
mass later in life. The National Osteoporosis Foundation has
issued this scientific statement to provide evidence-based
guidance and a national implementation strategy for the pur-
pose of helping individuals achieve maximal peak bone mass
early in life. In this scientific statement, we (1) report the
results of an evidence-based review of the literature since
2000 on factors that influence achieving the full genetic po-
tential for skeletal mass; (2) recommend lifestyle choices that
promote maximal bone health throughout the lifespan; (3)
outline a research agenda to address current gaps; and (4)
identify implementation strategies. We conducted a systematic
review of the role of individual nutrients, food patterns, spe-
cial issues, contraceptives, and physical activity on bone mass
and strength development in youth. An evidence grading sys-
tem was applied to describe the strength of available evidence
on these individual modifiable lifestyle factors that may (or
may not) influence the development of peak bone mass
(Table 1). A summary of the grades for each of these factors
is given below. We describe the underpinning biology of these
relationships as well as other factors for which a systematic

Considering the evidence-based literature review, we rec-
ommend lifestyle choices that promote maximal bone health
from childhood through young to late adolescence and outline
a research agenda to address current gaps in knowledge. The
best evidence (grade A) is available for positive effects of
calcium intake and physical activity, especially during the late
childhood and peripubertal years—a critical period for bone
accretion. Good evidence is also available for a role of vitamin
D and dairy consumption and a detriment of DMPA injec-
tions. However, more rigorous trial data on many other life-
style choices are needed and this need is outlined in our re-
search agenda. Implementation strategies for lifestyle modifi-
cations to promote development of peak bone mass and
strength within one’s genetic potential require a multisectored
(i.e., family, schools, healthcare systems) approach.

Introduction
Bone accretion
During growth and development, skeletal growth proceeds
through the coordinated action of bone deposition and resorp-
tion to allow bones to expand (periosteal apposition of cortical
bone) and lengthen (endochondral ossification) into their adult
form [2]. This process of bone modeling begins during fetal
growth and continues until epiphyseal fusion, usually by the
end of the second decade of life [1]. Bone modeling is sensi-
tive to mechanical loading, emphasizing the importance of
physical activity throughout growth [2]. Some skeletal char-
acteristics, such as cortical density and structural strength,
determined by bone dimensions and thickness, continue to
increase after epiphyseal fusion and into the third decade of
life. Quantitatively, the amount of bone mineral acquired from
1282

 birth to adulthood follows distinct age- and sex-specific pat-
terns (Fig. 1). Bone mass is acquired relatively slowly
throughout childhood. With the onset of puberty and the ado-
lescent growth spurt in height, bone mineral accretion is rapid,
reaching a peak shortly after peak height gain (Fig. 2). For
total body bone mineral, the peak bone mineral accretion rate
occurs at 12.5±0.90 years in girls and 14.1±0.95 years in
boys of European ancestry [3]. During the 4 years surrounding
the peak in bone accretion, 39 % of total body bone mineral is
acquired; by 4 years following the peak, 95 % of adult bone
mass has been achieved [4]. Within a population, the distribu-
tion of bone mass becomes more variable, in part due to dif-
ferences in height and other skeletal dimensions as adult size
is attained, the timing and magnitude of peak bone mineral
accrual, the cessation of bone accretion, and lifestyle factors.
This period of rapid accretion may be a time of both opportu-
nity and vulnerability for optimizing peak bone mass.
Changes in the structure (size and shape) and compo-
sition (amount of cartilage, cortical, and trabecular bone)
of bone also occur with progression through puberty and
thereby influence bone strength (Fig. 3). Cortical bone is
the compact bone that forms the outer shell protecting
bone marrow and trabecular bone. Trabecular bone is
composed of rods and plates in a sponge-like structure,
adding to the structural strength of bone. Cortical and
trabecular bone differ in their responsiveness to disease
effects, medications, muscle-loading and impact-loading
physical activity, and hormonal changes. The relative im-
portance of cortical versus trabecular bone in optimizing
peak bone mass and strength and in minimizing fracture
risk has not been firmly established in either childhood or
adulthood. Distinct increases in trabecular bone of the
spine and long bones occur between sexual maturity
stages 3 and 4 [5–7]. The density of cortical bone is
lower among children and adolescents than among adults,
and it may even go through a transient period of increased
porosity, particularly for boys [7, 8]. The density of corti-
cal bone increases more rapidly as epiphyseal fusion oc-
curs and continues into the third decade of life [9]. Both
the inner and outer dimensions of long bones increase as
growth proceeds, providing greater structural strength. The
accumulation of bone mineral and changes in density and
structural strength of bone may also continue into the third
decade of life, depending on the bone compartment and
skeletal site under consideration (Fig. 1).

 Definition of peak bone mass
Peak bone mass is generally thought of as the amount of bone
gained by the time a stable skeletal state has been attained
during young adulthood. The concept of peak bone mass more
broadly captures peak bone strength, which is characterized
by mass, density, microarchitecture, microrepair mechanisms,
and the geometric properties that provide structural strength.
There are several nuances to this concept that deserve rec-
ognition. The concept of peak bone mass is different when
applied to an individual as opposed to a population. For an
individual, peak bone mass may refer to the maximum amount
of bone accrued during young adulthood. Alternatively, the
concept of peak bone mass may refer to an individual’s max-
imal or genetic potential for bone strength (i.e., bone mineral
content (BMC), areal bone mineral density (aBMD), or other
measures of bone strength). At the population level, peak bone
mass is attained when age-related changes in a bone outcome
are no longer positive and have attained a plateau or maximum
value [10].
Importance of peak bone mass
Fracture
Optimizing bone accrual during growth may be of greatest
significance in preventing current or future fractures, as mea-
sures of bone mass, density, and structural strength are asso-
ciated with fracture in children and adults [11–13]. The fre-
quency of fractures is higher among children compared to

 young and middle-aged adults [14], reflecting the vulnerabil-
ity of the growing skeleton prior to peak bone mass. Among
healthy children, as many as one half of boys and one third of
girls will sustain a fracture by age 18 years, with one fifth
sustaining two or more fractures [15, 16]. Children who sus-
tain a fracture before age 4 years are especially vulnerable to a
subsequent fracture [17]. Thirty to 50 % of childhood fractures
involve the forearm [14, 15, 18–20] and result from falls to an
outstretched arm. There is a positive relationship between
fracture frequency and level of physical activity due to the
increased risk of falls during physical activity [21]. Thus, al-
though physical activity is critical for bone modeling, children
with higher levels of physical activity are more likely to have
fractures [3, 22–28].
There is a developmental period during the rapid growth of
late childhood and early adolescence when the skeleton is
particularly vulnerable to fracture (Fig. 4) [29]. Recently,
high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography
(HRpQCT) has been used to explain the microarchitectural
basis for the observation of increased fracture frequency
among young adolescents [7]. The combination of thinner
cortical bone, lower total volumetric bone mineral density
(vBMD), and increased cortical porosity, particularly in boys,
suggests that linear bone growth outpaces bone mineraliza-
tion, resulting in transient bone fragility.
Understanding factors that affect bone strength early in life
is important because low bone strength is associated with
fracture risk in later life, independent of fall incidence and
physical activity [30]. Childhood bone mass is predictive of
fracture risk during childhood, with an 89 % increase in frac-
ture risk per SD decrease in size-adjusted bone mass [31].
Moreover, among children who experience similar forearm
injuries, those with greater bone density have been shown to
be less likely to fracture [32]. Preterm children have low bone
mass during late childhood [33], and birth weight is related to
bone mass in later adult life (age ≥60 years) [34].
Recent work using HRpQCTsuggests that microarchitectural
changes underlie increased bone fragility in children who sustain
a distal forearm fracture following mild trauma compared to
nonfracture controls [35]. Differences such as cortical thinning
are seen at both the distal radius and distal tibia in children
presenting with a forearm fracture in which the degree of trauma
is mild (e.g., fall from standing height), but not in those where
the trauma is moderate (e.g., fall while riding a bicycle). Further
analysis, including microfinite element analysis of HRpQCT
data, showed that the mild trauma distal forearm fracture cases
had reduced bone strength (i.e., failure load) compared to chil-
dren without a fracture history. Moderate trauma is sufficient to
break healthy bones that are not otherwise inherently at increased
risk of fracture. Clark et al. [21] have shown that, irrespective of
bone mass, fracture risk rises as the amount of vigorous activity
increases. Additional studies have shown that a forearm fracture
in a child is associated with lower areal and vBMD, cortical area,
and bone strength using peripheral quantitative computed to-
mography (pQCT) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) [11]. Cohort studies in the USA and South Africa show
that boys and girls of European descent have a greater fracture
risk than children of African descent [36, 37], a finding that
parallels patterns of osteoporosis and hip fracture in elderly
adults [38, 39].
In childhood and adolescence, stress fractures exhibit a
different pattern from typical long bone fractures. The lifetime
prevalence of stress fracture among the general population is
below 4 % [40], and stress fractures are more common among
women than among men [41]. In studies of military popula-
tions, where stress fractures are most common, the rate ratio

 may be 10:1 [42–47], with up to 20 % of female recruits in
basic training reported to have sustained a stress fracture
[44–48] (note: military studies include young adults aged
≥18 years). Risk factors for stress fractures among recruits
include low quantitative ultrasound values, smoking, history
of being sedentary [49], and volume of training [40, 44, 50].
White race and a reported family history of osteoporosis or
osteopenia may also represent significant risk factors [51, 52].
Tracking
Tracking refers to the stability of a trait over time. The degree
to which indicators of bone strength track from childhood to
peak bone mass and beyond is of paramount importance to
optimizing peak bone mass for lifelong skeletal health. If bone
Bstatus^ (i.e., bone mass, density, or structural strength relative
to one’s peers of the same age and sex) at any given time point
were not associated with its future status, then concerns would
only be relevant to prevention of childhood fractures, not os-
teoporosis later in life. In fact, numerous prospective studies
have demonstrated that measures of bone density track quite
strongly from childhood through adolescence, with tracking
correlations ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 depending on the skeletal
site, trait, and duration of follow-up, with most estimates fall-
ing in the range of 0.6 to 0.7 [32, 53–57]. Tracking correla-
tions decline during adolescence and then rebound, a phenom-
enon that is likely due to variability in the timing of puberty
and peak bone accrual. Adjustment for height status largely
eliminates this transient decline in tracking [32, 57]. One study
of children aged 8–16 years (n=183) examined the factors
associated with tracking deviation. Positive deviation (i.e.,
improvement in spine and hip aBMD tertile) was associated
with having been breast-fed, gains in lean mass, aerobic fit-
ness, and sports participation. Gains in adiposity were associ-
ated with negative deviations in tracking [55]. These findings
provide strong evidence that bone status during childhood,
when peak bone mass is accumulated, is indicative of bone
status in young adulthood. However, the fact that tracking
correlations are far from unity suggests that lifestyle factors
can alter bone status in both positive and negative directions.
Timing of peak bone mass
If the magnitude of peak bone mass attained in young adult-
hood is an important predictor of osteoporosis later in life,
then the timing of peak bone mass is also important because
it defines the lifecycle phase during which peak bone mass can
be optimized. Regardless of whether one is referring to peak
bone mass of an individual or a population, the timing of peak
bone mass varies by skeletal site. Estimates based on longitu-
dinal studies are preferred over cross-sectional population
studies for identifying the timing of peak bone mass because
they capture the process of bone accretion. For example, using
longitudinal observations and the plateau method, the
Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study identified the ages
of peak bone mass for women; for lumbar spine aBMD, it was
between the ages of 33 and 40 years, whereas ages of peak
bone mass for total hip BMD were between 16 and 19 years
[10].
Estimates of the timing of peak bone mass further depend
on the parameters of bone (i.e., mass, density, geometry,
microarchitecture) under consideration. Using quantitative
computed tomography (QCT), Riggs et al. [9] showed that
women aged 20–29 years (n=15) were losing trabecular bone
at a rate of 1–1.75 % per year at the distal radius and lumbar
spine, but they were gaining cortical bone at a rate of 0.25 %
per year in the tibia. By contrast, men (n=8) in this age range
did not exhibit significant changes in these outcomes [9].
Cross-sectional data on >1000 men, aged 18.0–20.9 years,
in the Gothenburg Osteoporosis and Obesity Determinants
Study suggest that aBMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck,
and total body did not increase with age, but positive age-
related associations were observed for aBMD of the radius,
cortical, and trabecular vBMD, and cortical thickness of the
radius and tibia as measured by DXA and pQCT [58]. The
positive association with cortical thickness was attributed to a
smaller medullary diameter, and not to periosteal expansion.
Because the timing of peak bone mass and strength varies
by skeletal site and bone compartment, it is important to es-
tablish and retain behaviors that contribute to skeletal health,
including region-specific changes (e.g., hip, spine). Moreover,
until the lifelong importance of peak bone mass is fully un-
derstood [52], it is prudent to assume that these behaviors are
needed to sustain skeletal health through the life cycle.
Methods for measuring peak bone mass
Insights into the development of peak bone mass are based on
studies using DXA and QCT. These measurement techniques
characterize different aspects of bone strength; DXA primarily
measures bone mass (or bone mineral content [BMC]) and
aBMD, which are integrated measures of cortical and trabec-
ular bone.QCT can provide distinct measures of cortical and
trabecular vBMD, bone geometry (e.g., periosteal and endos-
teal circumference and structural strength) and, in some cases,
microarchitecture.
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
The vast majority of studies on peak bone mass have utilized
DXA, a low-dose x-ray technology that measures the attenu-
ation of x-ray beams as they pass through tissues of varying
density. DXA is a two-dimensional imaging technique that
uses a planar image to estimate bone area. This technology
is ideal for use in children because it is rapid, safe, widely
available, and precise, with effective dose ranges from 0.03
1286
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
 to 15.2 μSV [59]. Because of the smaller bone size and lower
density of bones in growing children, special software has
been developed by the major DXA manufacturers to measure
aBMD and BMC in children. DXA does not measure vBMD
but instead provides what is referred to as aBMD. Since DXA
does not capture the depth of bone, it systematically underes-
timates vBMD in children with poor growth. For this reason,
adjusting DXA measures of BMC and aBMD for stature is
recommended [60, 61]. This adjustment serves to distinguish
between gains in BMC or aBMD that are independent of gains
in stature. In addition, cortical and trabecular bone are
superimposed in the DXA image, thus providing a composite
estimate of the mass and density of these two bone
compartments.
Lack of agreement exists regarding whether BMC or
aBMD should be the outcome of interest in bone accretion
studies in children. BMC is determined, in large part, by bone
size because it reflects the mineral content of one region or the
entire skeleton; aBMD only partly adjusts for bone size and a
size-related artifact remains [61]. Using spine QCT measures
as a reference method, Wren and colleagues have shown that
DXA BMC was a better measure to use in children (ages 6–
17 years), particularly in prepubertal children, than aBMD
[62]. We agree with those who argue that, to account for size
in studies of children, it is best to use BMC adjusted for bone
area [63, 64], height-for-age Z-score [61], lean mass [65, 66],
or other combinations of anthropometric variables [64, 67, 68]
or to use calculated bone mineral apparent density [69], be-
cause these provide a more accurate reflection of a child’s
bone health.
DXA measures have also been used to estimate structural
strength of the proximal femur using the hip structural analysis
(HSA) algorithm [70]. HSA estimates subperiosteal width,
cross-sectional area (CSA), and section modulus in the narrow
neck, intertrochanteric region, and shaft of the proximal fe-
mur. These outcomes are associated with treatment effects in
adults as well as disease and exercise effects in children and
adolescents [71–73].
Peripheral quantitative computed tomography
DXA only partly describes bone strength, which is the broader
concern for understanding peak bone mass. Other modalities
are used to more directly measure vBMD, microarchitecture,
and geometry. Many of these characteristics can easily be
measured in children with relatively low radiation exposure
(0.59–1.09 mSv) [74]. QCT and pQCT are three-dimensional
techniques that also use attenuation of x-ray beams to con-
struct bone images. Cortical and trabecular bone compart-
ments vary in density, and the differential attenuation of x-
ray beams in the three-dimensional reconstruction allows for
separate determination of trabecular and cortical vBMD, as
well as numerous other measures of bone geometry (e.g., total
bone area, periosteal and endosteal circumference) and struc-
tural strength in compression, bending, and torsion (e.g., sec-
tion modulus, strain–strength index). Full-sized computed to-
mography (CT) scanners are used to measure the spine and
other sites, and dedicated pQCT scanners measure the radius,
tibia, or distal femur. Newer HRpQCT scanners achieve suf-
ficient resolution for building microstructural finite element
models of whole bone failure load, a surrogate measure of
bone’s resistance to fracture, as well as cortical porosity, and
trabecular plate and rod microstructure [74].
Mechanical loading
Physical activity comprises any body movement produced by
muscle contraction resulting in energy expenditure above a
resting level [75]. Exercise is a more restrictive concept and
is defined by planned, organized, and repetitive physical ac-
tivity aimed at maintaining or enhancing one or more compo-
nents of physical fitness or a specific health outcome, such as
bone strength [68]. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
reviewed in this scientific statement used targeted exercise as
an intervention to improve bone strength, whereas most of the
longitudinal studies measured physical activity, including ac-
tive transportation and activities of everyday life [76].
Physical activity has long been regarded as behavior likely
to influence bone health [77, 78]. Epidemiological and clinical
trial research dating back more than two decades confirms the
positive impact of regular physical activity on bone [3, 27,
78–81]. However, we are only beginning to quantify the spe-
cific dimensions, dose, and timing of physical activity needed
for maximal bone strength. What is known, primarily from
animal studies, is that increased mechanical loads placed on
bone through both impact and muscle forces cause deforma-
tion (strains) of whole bone [82, 83]. These strains activate
mechanosensitive cells (i.e., osteocytes), embedded within the
bone, which signal molecules to activate osteoblasts and oste-
oclasts. The signaling begins the process of bone adaptation to
changes in physical activity, as well as other mechanical loads
(e.g., an increase in body weight). To initiate an osteogenic
response, bone must be subjected to a strain magnitude that
surpasses a threshold determined by the habitual strain range
in the predominant loading direction. The threshold varies
between individuals (and also bone sites) according to physi-
cal activity habits and other factors (e.g., maturity status).
Thus, children and adolescents may respond differently to
similar mechanical loading conditions. Inactive children may
respond to low-impact loading and improve bone mass or
structure, while more active children will need a higher me-
chanical load to promote a skeletal response [84].
The skeleton needs to be strong for load bearing and light
for mobility. A manner of minimizing the amount of bone
mass needed in a cross-section without decreasing strength
is to modify the distribution of bone mass and therefore

1287
 changing bone structure. Throughout life, but mainly during
growth, periosteal apposition increases the diameter of long
bones and endocortical resorption enlarges the marrow cavity.
Cortical thickness is determined by the net changes occurring
at the periosteal and endosteal surface of bone. However, even
without an increase in cortical thickness, the displacement of
the cortex increases bending strength because resistance to
bending is proportional to the fourth power of the distance
from the neutral axis. In addition to the independent effect of
physical activity on mass and density, increased mechanical
loading via physical activity may influence structural changes
in bone to increase strength in response to the new loading
condition [25, 73, 85].
Bone is most responsive to physical activities that are dy-
namic, moderate to high in load magnitude, short in load du-
ration, odd or nonrepetitive in load direction, and applied
quickly [84]. The load magnitude is produced by impact with
the ground (e.g., tumbling or jumping), impact with an object
(racquet sports), or muscle power moves such as the lift phase
in jumping and vaulting. On the other hand, due to desensiti-
zation of the osteocytes, static loads and repetitive low-
magnitude loads are not osteogenic [86–88]. Although phys-
ical activity is a modifiable factor that contributes to peak bone
mass and strength, our understanding of how to quantify the
dimensions of physical activity that are osteogenic (including
frequency, intensity, time, and type) is incomplete.
Body composition
It is widely recognized that lean body mass is among the
strongest correlates of bone mass, density, and structural
strength during childhood [89–92]. During adolescence, the
peak in total body lean mass accretion occurs just prior to peak
bone mineral accretion [2, 93], although at specific sites, peak
increases in lean mass and bone strength may be coordinated
[94]. In the latter phase of the adolescent growth spurt, fol-
lowing the peak, continued gains in lean mass are strong pre-
dictors of increases in BMC [95].
A major challenge in understanding the relationship be-
tween lean mass and bone is that both lean mass and bone
mass have a strong heritable component. A study of young
adult twins (aged 23–31 years) found that additive genetic
factors accounted for 87 % of the variation in total body
BMD, 81 % of the variation in lean mass, and 69–88 % of
the covariance between lean mass and BMD depending on the
skeletal site. Population differences also provide evidence of
genetic determinants of lean and bone mass. Cardel et al. [96]
compared groups of African or European ancestry (n=301,
aged 7–12 years) using ancestry informative DNA markers
and found that a greater amount of African admixture was
associated with greater lean mass and BMC after adjusting
for socioeconomic status, sex, age, height, race/ethnicity, and
pubertal status.
The effect of fat mass on bone mineral accretion and attain-
ment of peak bone mass is far more controversial. Generally,
greater body weight increases the effects of weight-bearing
activity on bone. As children grow and increase in weight,
both lean and fat mass increase. To reduce the likelihood of
confounding from the bone loading effects of lean mass, it is
important to first account for the effect of lean mass on bone in
order to determine the effects of fat mass.
The source of adipose tissue may be important in consid-
ering the effects of body composition on bone outcomes.
Visceral adipose tissue has different metabolic effects com-
pared to subcutaneous fat, and it may be deleterious to bone
by reducing bone quality. Adipose infiltrations of muscle and
bone marrow associated with excess adiposity also have ad-
verse effects on bone. Muscle density measured by pQCT is
lower when the fat content within muscle is increased.
Nonmodifiable factors
Genetics
An estimated 60–80 % of the variability in bone mass and
osteoporosis risk is explained by heritable factors. aBMD is
lower among daughters of women with osteoporosis [97] and
in men and women with first-degree relatives who have oste-
oporosis [98]. The familial resemblance of BMC is expressed
prior to puberty [99, 100]. Genome-wide association studies
have identified more than 70 loci associated with adult bone
density or fractures [101, 102]. However, only a few such
studies have been conducted in children [1, 103–106]. Twin
studies also suggest that genetic predisposition determines up
to 80 % of peak bone mass; the remaining 20 % is modulated
by environmental factors and sex hormone levels during pu-
berty [107].
Population ancestry
In North America, ethnic differences in vBMD and aBMD
have been reported in children [5, 108, 109]. Among individ-
uals aged 9–25 years, aBMD was consistently greater at all
sites for African Americans compared to other groups, where-
as Caucasians had greater values than Asians and Hispanics.
In studies comparing children of Asian, European, and
Hispanic ancestry, group differences in BMC were attribut-
able to differences in bone size [110–112]. Ethnic differences
in the rate of BMD gain have also been observed [109].
Differences between Caucasians, Asians, and Hispanics are
smaller than between blacks and other groups; thus, pediatric
reference ranges for BMC and aBMD are presented for
African Americans and non-African Americans, and the
International Society for Clinical Densitometry recommends
using race-specific reference ranges in childhood because they
reflect genetic potential for bone accretion [60, 111]. Studies
1288
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
 using QCT provide insights into the population ancestry dif-
ferences in DXA measures by describing cortical bone dimen-
sions and trabecular density [5, 113–115]. As noted earlier,
trabecular density increases during puberty. The magnitude
of the pubertal increase in trabecular density is greater in
African-American individuals than in Caucasians, and
African-American children have greater total femoral bone
in cross-sectional analyses [5, 6, 115].
Sex
Among children and adolescents, males have greater BMC
and aBMD than females. These differences become more pro-
nounced with the onset and progression through puberty or at
the ages that correspond to these maturational changes [108,
109, 116–118]. The exact age at which these differences
emerge is unclear. Earlier studies of infants (aged ≤12 months)
did not find sex differences in total body BMD [119, 120] or
spine BMC and aBMD [121, 122]; however, males (aged 1–
18 months) had greater total body BMC than females [123]. A
recent study of infants and toddlers aged 1–36 months con-
firmed the absence of sex differences in aBMD in very young
children but found greater BMC in males than in females. Sex
differences in the body size of infants and toddlers may ac-
count for BMC differences and the absence of aBMD differ-
ences. By about 5 years of age, girls have lower values for
spine and hip aBMD than boys, a finding that persists when
adjusted for age, height, and weight [124].
Studies of bone strength by pQCT reveal a more complex
pattern of sex differences. In a study of 665 healthy individ-
uals aged 5–35 years, cortical BMC, periosteal circumference,
and section modulus were lower in the 38 % site of the tibia
for females compared with males across all stages of puberty.
However, cortical vBMD was greater and endosteal circum-
ference was lower in peripubertal and postpubertal females
compared to males. These differences were not attributable
to differences in muscle mass or bone size [115]. In a 20-
month longitudinal study of 128 children across puberty, boys
exhibited a 10 % greater increase in total area and cortical area
compared to girls, but the increase in the size of the marrow
cavity was significantly less for girls than for boys [125].
Further evaluation showed that sex differences in bone
strength are primarily due to the 4–6 % greater bone area in
boys, which is evident in prepubertal children [126].
HRpQCT studies of the radius show that girls have higher
cortical vBMD in midpuberty and postpuberty (9.4 and
7.4 %, respectively) and lower cortical porosity than boys
(−118 and −56 %, respectively) [127].
Maturation
Advancement through puberty is associated with increases in
BMC and aBMD, as well as cortical and trabecular vBMD.
Moreover, several studies suggest that the timing of matura-
tion may affect peak bone mass, particularly in girls. For ex-
ample, Gilsanz et al. [128] showed that earlier age of pubertal
onset was associated with greater DXA BMC and aBMD at
skeletal maturity in both boys and girls, independent of pre-
pubertal BMC and aBMD values and duration of puberty.
Chevalley et al. [129] found that girls who attained menarche
earlier had higher aBMD at multiple skeletal sites prior to,
during, and after puberty. A Canadian longitudinal study
(depicted in Fig. 2) found that girls who mature early had 3–
4 % more total body BMC at age 20 years than girls who
matured at an average age. However, maturational effects
were only observed at the total body and not at other sites;
no maturational timing effects were observed in males [130].
The absence of a maturation timing effect on aBMD and BMC
of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total body was con-
firmed in a study of Swedish military recruits in which young
men were followed until age 24 years. However, as with girls,
later puberty in boys was associated with lower radius aBMD
(−4.2 %, by DXA), as well as lower cortical (−0.7 %) and
trabecular vBMD (−4.8 %, by pQCT) [131]. The long-term
consequences of the effect of pubertal timing on peak bone
mass remain to be determined.
Modifiable factors
Diet and physical activity are the primary modifiable factors
associated with bone health, although other lifestyle and en-
vironmental factors may also be at play. Here, we review these
factors and their contribution to peak bone mass.
Although we separately address the contribution of physi-
cal activity to peak bone mass and strength, we address nutri-
ent interactions with physical activity and their effects on bone
in the respective nutrient discussions. Several narrative and
meta-analysis review articles were recently published that also
address the strength of the evidence for physical activity and
bone development [132–137].
Scientific statement aims
In this scientific statement, we (1) report the results of an
evidence-based review of the literature since 2000 on factors
that influence achieving the full genetic potential for skeletal
mass, (2) recommend lifestyle choices that promote maximal
bone health throughout the lifespan, (3) outline a research
agenda to address current gaps, and (4) identify implementa-
tion strategies.
Methods
We performed a comprehensive PubMed (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) search of the scientific literature for
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
1289
 articles published from January 2000 through December
2014. For all search terms, the following search strategy was
used: ((((search term[Title/Abstract]) AND bone[Title/
Abstract]) AND child*[Title/Abstract]) AND
adolescen*[Title/Abstract]) NOT review[Publication Type].
Language, date, and species filters were then applied to the
list of search results to eliminate articles not in English,
articles published outside the 2000–2014 window, and
animal studies. Searches for some of the topics required less
restrictive searching in order to yield viable results, such as
removal of the terms Bchild*^ and/or Badolescen*,^ or by
expanding searches to scan terms found in BAll Fields^ rather
than just BTitle/Abstract.^ MeSH terms were also utilized in
some instances. Studies that contained subjects aged ≤21 years
were included, except in the alcohol and smoking literature, in
which studies that contained subjects aged ≤22 years were
accepted due to lack of data in younger populations.
Figure 5 represents the flow diagram of the systematic review
for peak bone mass that includes search topics and the number
of search returns.
To further narrow the search results for the broader topics
(e.g., calcium, vitamin D, physical activity), we assigned au-
thors to subcommittees based on their expertise and these
subcommittees then reviewed the resultant abstracts. We ex-
cluded any articles that were not describing RCTs or observa-
tional studies, any studies that did not examine bone out-
comes, and any interventions that were <6 months in duration.
Studies and drug trials addressing disease states, with the ex-
ceptions of eating disorders and obesity, were likewise exclud-
ed. The articles that remained after the applications of these
criteria were then rated based on the extent of scientific evi-
dence as outlined in Table 1. This evidence grading system
has previously been utilized by prominent organizations such
as American Society for Nutrition [138] and the American
Diabetes Association [139] and is recommended by other ex-
perts [140]. The assigned grade reflects the strength of avail-
able evidence on individual modifiable lifestyle factors that
may (or may not) influence the development of peak bone
mass. We assigned evidence grades after we achieved consen-
sus among the writing group.
Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13
summarize the articles that were chosen for inclusion in the
current review, and these include additional articles located
via review articles, meta-analyses, and expert knowledge of
the literature.

Fat (Table 2) The search for fat identified no RCTs, 1 pro-
spective study, and 1 cross-sectional study published since
2000, encompassing 163 individuals (Table 2). Data from
the prospective study demonstrated that changes in aBMD
of the spine in males between ages 16 and 22 years were
positively associated with serum levels of arachidonic acid
and all omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA [141]. The
cross-sectional study by Eriksson et al. [142] showed positive
correlations between total body BMC and serum nervonic
acid and arachidonic acid as well as negative associations with
α-linolenic acid.
Our evidence grade for fat was based on findings from one
prospective study with methodological limitations and one
cross-sectional study.
Grade: Level of evidence D was assigned for evidence
for the benefit of fat on bone.

• Data presented above are from multivariate regression models showing independent associations of
both long-term protein intake (as uN) and PRAL as explanatory variables with forearm bone
variables. Data are adjusted for age, sex, pubertal stage, forearm muscle area, forearm length, and
urinary calcium.
• Data show that 1 Z-score variation in uN leads to an average 7.2 % increase in BMC and a 4.7 %
increase in cortical area as well as SSI. A 1 Z-score uN corresponds to 0.28-g protein intake/kg
body wt, implying that an additional 1-g protein intake/kg body wt may lead to an average
increase of 26 % in BMC and 17 % in cortical area and SSI. A 1-g protein intake/kg body wt is
associated with an average increase of 1.8-mm periosteal circumference.

• The data above are unadjusted.
• In the multiple linear regression analysis including height, weight, sex, energy intake, and
bone-related nutrients in the model, dietary protein was not significantly associated with bone
area or BMC.
After backward elimination, in which height, weight, and sex were forced to stay in the model,
dietary protein was positively associated with bone area (P < 0.05).
• Inclusion of pubertal stages in the analyses did not alter the bone area or BMC outcomes.

• Data presented above are ß coefficients for within-pair differences in protein versus
(1) within-pair differences in BMC and bone dimensions, (2) within-pair differences in size-
adjusted BMC and bone dimensions, and (3) when all within-pair differences in protein, calcium,
exercise duration, and size are included in the regression equation.
• A 1-g difference in protein intake was associated with a 0.8-g (0.4 %) difference in arm BMC
(P < 0.05). These relationships were present in peripubertal and postpubertal pairs but not in
prepubertal pairs. Exercise during growth appears to have greater skeletal benefits than variations
in protein or calcium intakes, with the site-specific effects evident in more mature twins.

• Data presented above are for the intent-to-treat analysis.
• In the compliance-based analysis only in the entire sample, vitamin D supplementation vs placebo increased femoral BMC augmentation
by 14.3 % with 200-IU doses and by 17.2 % with 400-IU doses (P = 0.012)
• In the compliance-based analysis only in the entire sample, a dose–response effect was observed at the lumbar spine with the 400-IU
(P = 0.039), but not the 200-IU dose.
• In a subanalysis based on puberty (n = 111) and using a compliance-based analysis only, adjusted for Tanner stage, increase in bone area,
and weight gain, there was a dose-dependent and significant difference in the lumbar spine BMC augmentation at midpuberty
(P = 0.01), but not at early puberty.

• Data are presented above as R2 and the linear mixed models regressed BMC on age, IGF-I, 25(OH)D, season, and
race, and interactions among these variables and show that IGF-I was more strongly associated with BMC accrual than
25(OH)D at all sites
• The rate of BMC accrual was negatively associated with 25(OH)D. When IGF-I and 25(OH)D were included in the same regression
equation, 25(OH)D did not have a significant predictive effect on BMC accrual above and beyond that of
IGF-I.

 Protein (Table 3) The search for protein identified 1 RCT, 5
prospective studies, and 6 cross-sectional studies published
since 2000, encompassing 2255 individuals (Table 3). In the
one RCT, there was no effect of supplementing 42 g protein
over 6 months on changes in tibia trabecular or cortical bone
measures at the 4 or 20 % sites, respectively, measured from
the distal tibia metaphysis, or on changes in total body BMC
[143]. Alexy et al. [144] demonstrated in a cohort of German
children that protein intakes over 4 years were positively as-
sociated with, and were predictors of, forearm periosteal cir-
cumference, cortical area, BMC, and stress–strain index (SSI).
The investigators also showed that long-term dietary potential
renal acid load (PRAL) was negatively associated with fore-
arm BMC and cortical area. PRAL is increased by sulfur ami-
no acid content of the diet and is decreased by alkaline salts as
occurs in plant foods. In the same cohort studied over 4 years,
Remer et al. [145] reported that urinary nitrogen (uN) was
positively associated with forearm periosteal circumference,
cortical area, BMC, and SSI, and urinary PRAL was negative-
ly associated with forearm BMC and cortical area. Protein
intakes in males and females between the ages of 2 months
and 8 years were positively associated with total body BMC
[146]. Using a mixed-longitudinal design, protein intakes
were shown to positively predict total body BMC net gain in
males and females between ages 8 and 21 years [147].
Moreover, protein intakes in periadolescent females were pos-
itively associated with total body BMC and total body BMC
net gains, but only in those with calcium intakes >1000 mg/
day. Over a period of 5 years, protein intakes in children with
low calcium intakes were negatively associated with distal and
proximal forearm BMC and total body BMC [148].
Hoppe et al. [149] reported that protein intakes among
Danish children were positively related to total body bone
area, but not BMC, when adjusted for height, weight, and
sex. Differences in arm BMC between twins were partially
explained by protein intakes, such that a 1-g difference in
protein intake resulted in a 0.4 % difference in arm BMC
[150]. Chevalley et al. [151] reported that protein intakes in
prepubertal males were positively related to BMC of the radial
metaphysis, total radius, femoral neck, femoral diaphysis, and
the lumbar spine when controlling for physical activity and
calcium intakes. Absolute or adjusted (for body weight, years
after menarche, and vertebral area) protein intake from milk,
but not from other foods, was positively associated with lum-
bar spine BMC [152]. In a group of healthy and malnourished
Indian children aged 2–3 years, protein intake was positively
related to total body BMC and bone area [153]. However,
energy-adjusted protein intakes were not significantly associ-
ated with forearm geometrical measures in another group of
children [154].
Our evidence grade for protein was based on findings from
four prospective studies indicating positive findings and one
null RCT.
Grade: Level of evidence C was assigned for the benefit
of protein on bone.
Micronutrients
Calcium (Tables 4 and 5) The search for calcium identified
16 RCTs published since 2000, encompassing 3077 individ-
uals (Table 4). In addition, five studies that used both calcium
and physical activity interventions were evaluated for main
and interaction effects [81, 155–158]. Four observational
studies published since 2000, encompassing 2383 individuals,
looked at calcium and physical activity interactions on bone
(Table 5). When categorized according to the type of calcium
intervention, nine studies included supplementation with pills/
chews, four used calcium-fortified foods, two used dairy
foods, and one used a combination of dairy and pills. Most
of the studies included primarily white subjects. A variety of
skeletal variables were used as study outcomes. Most studies
evaluated the effects of calcium intake on DXA outcomes,
including BMC, aBMD, and bone area of the total body, lum-
bar spine, total hip, femoral neck, intertrochanteric and tro-
chanteric areas of the hip, and distal and ultradistal areas of
the forearm. Very few studies reported all possible DXA out-
comes, and specific outcomes varied among studies. Three
RCTs assessed bone mass and structure using pQCT.
All but one [159] of the nine RCTs using supplement pills
found a small, but consistent, positive effect on aBMD and/or
BMC accrual as measured by DXA. The benefit to the sup-
plemented group compared to the placebo group ranged from
0.57 to 5.80 %. None of the studies found a significant effect
at all (i.e., hip, spine, and radius) of the usual DXA skeletal
sites, and the specific sites that benefited varied among the
studies. Only three of the RCTs with DXA reported adjusting
for body size [160–162], which is important because longitu-
dinal growth confounds interpretation of changes in aBMD
and BMC. The difference in height-adjusted BMC accrual
between supplemented and placebo groups in these four stud-
ies ranged from 0.80 to 4.60 %.
One of the best-designed studies was a single-blind co-twin
study of girls aged 8–13 years given calcium carbonate
1200 mg/day or placebo for 24 months [161]. Baseline calci-
um intake was 786 mg/day (calcium) and 772 mg/day (con-
trol; not significant), values considerably lower than the rec-
ommended dietary allowance (RDA) (1000 mg/day for ages
4–8 years and 1300 mg/day for ages 9–18 years). Of 64 twin
pairs enrolled, 24 pairs completed the study. Compliance with
supplementation was 76 % for both groups (calcium and pla-
cebo). At the end of study, the calcium group had gained
3.69 % more total body BMC (adjusted for age, height, and
weight) than the control group. There were no significant dif-
ferences in change in BMD at the total hip, spine, or femoral
neck. In post hoc analyses, significant differences in gain were

 seen in total body BMC (2.47 %), hip BMD (1.64 %), and
spine BMD (1.64 %) in the calcium group after 12 months of
supplementation. Confidence in the findings at 24 months is
lessened due to the high rate of attrition (63 %). Another
confounder is that the girls studied were peripubertal and thus
varied in their estrogen status. At baseline, all subjects were
premenarchal, whereas by the end of the study, 13 of the 48
subjects were postmenarchal (five concordant and three dis-
cordant pairs.)
Dibba et al. [160] tested the effects of calcium carbonate
1000 mg/day on radius BMC and BMD accrual in a 12-month
RCT of prepubertal Gambian children who had low baseline
calcium intake (342 mg/day). Supplementation resulted in a
higher size-adjusted BMC in the midshaft radius (4.6±0.9 %;
P<0.0001) and in the distal radius (5.5±2.7 %; P=0.042).
This study showed a greater difference in gain between groups
than the study by Cameron et al. [161], which supports the
premise that children more deficient in a nutrient are likely to
have greater benefit from supplementation. Prentice et al.
[162] conducted a 13-month RCT of calcium carbonate
1000 mg/day in older adolescent males in Great Britain.
Baseline and study calcium intakes were high, even in the
placebo group, which was meeting the RDA. Nonetheless,
calcium supplementation resulted in an approximately 1 %
greater increase in total hip BMC after adjustment for bone
area, weight, and height. The calcium intervention also result-
ed in greater height.
Three RCTs evaluated the effect of both calcium and vita-
min D supplement pills on gain in tibial trabecular vBMD as
measured by pQCT measurement on the distal tibia. Moyer-
Mileur et al. [163] found a significant difference in gain at the
10 % skeletal measurement site on the distal tibia, whereas
Greene and Naughton [164] found a significant 5.2 % differ-
ence in gain at the 4 % distal tibia site. Both the 10 and 4 %
tibia sites represent primarily trabecular bone. Cheng et al.
[159] found no effects. Only Greene and Naughton [164] re-
ported adjusting for body size (limb length). However, the
vitamin D doses (200 and 400 IU/day) were below the RDA
of 600 IU/day, which raises doubt as to whether vitamin D
status was optimized in these subjects.
Of the four RCTs using calcium fortification of food or
beverages [165–168], all but one [166] found a significant
supplement effect on skeletal gain, which ranged from 3.2 to
19.0 %. In the study showing no effect [166], the average
dietary calcium intake of the placebo group was 1395 mg/
day, which was above the threshold and likely accounts for
the lack of effect of a calcium supplement.
Two RCTs were identified that supplemented with dairy
foods. One study [169] found that 1000 mg of dairy resulted
in a 1.5 % greater gain in spine BMD compared to controls. In
the study by Du et al. [170], 10-year-old girls were random-
ized to one of three groups: group 1 consumed 330 mL/day of
ultra-heat-treated (UHT) milk fortified with a calcium salt
containing 560-mg calcium, group 2 consumed 330 mL/day
of UHT and 200–320 μg of vitamin D, and a control group
followed their usual diet. The calcium salt also contained
phosphorus and protein, both of which affect bone. Baseline
calcium intake was about one third of the RDA among the
three groups. After 24 months, groups 1 and 2 gained signif-
icantly greater size-adjusted total body BMC than the con-
trols, and group 2 with vitamin D supplementation gained
more than group 1 (P=0.006). Cheng et al. [159] supplement-
ed with both pills and cheese, and the authors found an effect
with cheese only.
Three of the four RCTs of calcium and exercise combined
[81, 155, 157] found that the combined intervention had a
significantly greater effect on bone accrual as assessed by
DXA than either exercise or calcium alone. Specker and
Binkley [81] also found an interaction effect on cortical thick-
ness and area as measured by pQCT.
Only four observational studies of calcium intake and bone
accrual were found [171–174]. Three found no association
between calcium intake and accrual, whereas one prospective
study [172] found a significant association between calcium
intake and spine BMC adjusted for height change only in
nonblack girls.
Our evidence grade for calcium was based on positive
findings from 90 % of the RCTs using supplement pills, which
found a small, biologically, and statistically significant posi-
tive effect on aBMD and/or BMC accrual. The bone accrual in
the supplemented group compared to the placebo group was
largest in children who had the lowest intakes at baseline. This
supports the premise of a threshold nutrient such as calcium
(i.e., if usual intake of calcium exceeds requirements, then it is
unlikely that any benefit of the intervention will be detected).
Thus, on the basis of this review, we conclude that dietary
intake guidelines for calcium are not being met by all children
and adolescents.
Grade: Level of evidence A was assigned for the benefit
of calcium on bone.
Vitamin D (Table 6) The search for vitamin D identified nine
publications from 8 RCTs, 1 prospective study, and 3 cross-
sectional studies published since 2000, encompassing 2962
individuals (Table 6). Four of the eight RCTs provide evi-
dence for a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation
on bone accrual. El-Hajj Fuleihan et al. [175] found that
Lebanese children receiving weekly doses of 14,000 IU vita-
min D3 over 1 year had improved hip BMC and bone area
(using conventional DXA) and narrow neck outer diameter
and buckling ratio (using the HSA program) [176].
Furthermore, trochanter BMC improved in premenarchal,
but not postmenarchal, females [175]. There were no signifi-
cant effects of supplementation observed in boys. Viljakainen
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
1349
 et al. [177] showed that Finnish females assigned to placebo or
200 or 400 IU vitamin D3 over 1 year exhibited no differences
in BMC gains at the lumbar spine or femur. A compliance-
based analysis was conducted, which included only those sub-
jects with >80 % compliance. After adjusting for bone area,
weight gain, and changes in maturation, greater increases in
lumbar spine BMC were observed with 400 IU vitamin D3
and in femur BMC with either 200 or 400 IU D3 [177]. The
increase in lumbar spine BMC in this study was identified in
perimenarchal, but not premenarchal, females. Du et al. [170]
demonstrated that the addition of 200–320 IU of vitamin D3 to
calcium-fortified milk significantly increased size-adjusted to-
tal body BMC over 2 years compared to controls. When ana-
lyzing the data by menarchal status, the significant increase in
size-adjusted total body BMC was observed only in females
that had experienced menarche versus premenarche.
Khadilkar et al. [178] found that supplementing vitamin D-
deficient girls (girls with mean baseline serum 25(OH)D con-
centrations 20–25 nmol/L) with quarterly doses of 300,000 IU
vitamin D2 along with daily supplementation of 250 mg ele-
mental calcium over 1 year improved adjusted total body
BMC and bone area more compared with girls who were
supplemented with calcium alone. These positive findings
were observed in the compliance-based analyses only and in
females within 2 years of starting their menstrual cycle,
adjusting for multiple factors including fat-free mass.
Four of the eight RCTs showed no effect of vitamin D
supplementation on bone. Ward et al. [179] reported that quar-
terly supplementation with 150,000 IU vitamin D2 versus pla-
cebo in vitamin D-deficient adolescent females did not im-
prove DXA- and pQCT-derived bone outcomes over 1 year,
including measures of tibia and radius trabecular or cortical
bone. Molgaard et al. [173] reported that supplementation
with 200 or 400 IU vitamin D in 10- to 11-year-old females
over 1 year had no effect on changes in total body or lumbar
spine BMC or in bone area. Similarly, supplementation with
either 400 or 800 IU to vitamin D-deficient females over 1 year
had no effect on unadjusted total body BMC gains compared
to placebo [180]. Finally, supplements containing 200 IU with
1000-mg calcium had no effect on total body, lumbar spine,
femoral neck, or total femur BMC gains over 2 years com-
pared to placebo, calcium alone (1000 mg), or a cheese-
supplemented group [159].
A prospective study in prepubertal girls conducted over a
5-year period found that as serum 25(OH)D concentrations
declined with age, there were significant increases in BMC
at multiple skeletal sites [181]. This study showed that serum
25(OH)D did not have a predictive effect on BMC accrual
above and beyond that of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I
[181]. In a cross-sectional study of females aged 10–12 years,
those with deficient serum 25(OH)D ≤25 nmol/L had lower
cortical vBMD at the distal radius than those with values
≥26 nmol/L, and they also had lower cortical vBMD at the
tibial shaft compared to subjects with values between 26 and
40 nmol/L [182]. Moreover, Foo et al. [183] found that 15-
year-old Chinese females with vitamin D deficiency (i.e.,
<25 nmol/L) had lower size-adjusted total body and forearm
BMC than females with sufficient values (>50 nmol/L). In a
study of 9-year-old Korean children, serum 25(OH)D was
positively associated with total body BMC after adjusting
for multiple variables, which included physical activity and
calcium intake [184].
The evidence grade for vitamin D was based on the point
that four of eight RCTs showed improvements in BMC accru-
al. Furthermore, one of the positive RCTs was well designed,
used an intent-to-treat analysis, was adequately powered, and
employed a wide range of supplement doses. The evidence
grade B reflects the lack of generalizability across the RCTs,
which included primarily female subjects with little diversity
in population ancestry.
Grade: Level of evidence B was assigned for the benefit
of vitamin D on bone.
Micronutrients other than calcium and vitamin D
(Table 7) The search for other micronutrients identified 1
RCT, 2 prospective studies, and 6 cross-sectional studies pub-
lished since 2000, encompassing 2192 individuals (Table 7).
Only one RCT was identified and that was for magnesium
[185]. Magnesium supplementation at 300 mg/day for 1 year
was significantly associated with a ~3 % increase in overall
hip measures of BMC and a borderline significant increase in
lumbar spine BMC among white girls. In prospective studies,
fluoride was not related to BMC in adjusted models
[186–188]. Cross-sectional studies report that a positive asso-
ciation of vitamin C intake and BMC was observed only in
boys [189], and positive associations of vitamin C and zinc
intakes with bone size and strength were observed in fourth-
grade, but not sixth-grade, girls [190]. By contrast, negative
associations between high intakes of sodium and phosphorus
and total body BMC and bone area in white boys and girls
were observed [149]. Iron intake was negatively associated
with femoral cortical area [190].
Cross-sectional studies also showed advantages of a bio-
marker of vitamin K status only in white females [191]. In
their study of 245 healthy girls in the USA aged 3–16 years,
Kalkwarf et al. [192] reported that better vitamin K status
(assessed by plasma phylloquinone and serum percentage of
undercarboxylated osteocalcin [%ucOC]) was associated with
decreased bone turnover, but it was not associated with base-
line BMC. Serum %ucOC was not associated with changes in
BMC of the hip, total body, or total body minus the head, but it
was surprisingly associated with positive changes in lumbar
spine BMC [192]. In contrast with this study, a more recent
association study of 223 healthy peripubertal Danish girls
1350
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
 found that better vitamin K status was associated with in-
creased total body and lumbar spine BMC, but not with bone
turnover [191].
Our evidence grade for other micronutrients was based on
one RCT of magnesium supplementation, two prospective
studies of fluoride intake, two cross-sectional studies
assessing vitamin C and vitamin K intake, and one cross-
sectional study assessing intakes of zinc, iron sodium, and
phosphorus.
Grade: Level of evidence D was assigned for the benefit
of micronutrients other than calcium and vitamin D on
bone.
Food patterns (Table 8)
The search for food patterns identified 5 RCTs and 12 obser-
vational studies published since 2000, encompassing 6282
individuals (Table 8).
Dairy
Three 2-year RCTs showed increased gains in some bone sites
with dairy food consumption [159, 169, 170]. The study by
Cheng et al. [159] found an increase with cheese consumption
in bone quality assessed by tibia cortical thickness using
pQCT in addition to total body BMD, but only in those par-
ticipants who were at least 50 % compliant. The advantage of
trochanter BMC in the study with dairy supplementation dis-
appeared 1 year after cessation [169]. These RCTs were not
generalizable because they were conducted only in presum-
ably white girls, except for the study by Du et al. [170] con-
ducted in Asians.
Fiber
One RCT was found and the authors reported a benefit of
prebiotic fibers on total body BMC gains in boys and girls
over 1 year [193]. One cross-sectional study [194] showed
dietary patterns that favored higher bone mass and lower fat
mass including higher amounts of dark-green and deep-
yellow vegetables and lower amounts of fried foods.
Fruits and vegetables
The five cross-sectional studies identified consistently found
some type of benefit to bone with increased and/or high intake
of fruits and vegetables [189, 195–198].
Detriment of cola and caffeinated beverages
We identified six studies that examined the effects of carbon-
ated beverages or caffeine-containing beverages and bone ac-
crual during childhood and peak bone mass. Several cross-
sectional studies have shown inverse associations between
cola or carbonated beverages and bone outcomes in children
or young adults. In a population-based, case–control study of
children who had experienced upper limb fractures, Ma and
Jones [199] found that wrist and forearm fractures were sig-
nificantly associated with cola drink consumption (odds ratio
(OR), 1.39 per unit; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 1.01,
1.91), but not after adjustment for sedentary activities (e.g.,
television, computer, and video watching). Wyshak [200]
found that carbonated beverage consumption was associated
with a history of fracture (OR, 3.14; 95 % CI, 1.45, 6.78). The
association was strongest for girls reporting higher levels of
physical activity (OR, 7.00; 95 % CI, 2.00, 24.45). Similarly,
Manias et al. [201] evaluated children with a first-time fracture
(n = 50), those who had recurrent fractures (n = 50), and a
fracture-free group (n=50). The recurrent fracture group had
lower levels of milk intake and physical activity and higher
BMI and carbonated beverage intake than controls; those with
one or more fractures had significantly lower total body and
lumbar spine BMC and aBMD. A 4-year prospective study of
228 children showed that carbonated beverage consumption
increased as milk intake declined, and carbonated beverage
intake was negatively associated with strength of the radius
(polar SSI) even after adjusting for milk intake [202].
Lower aBMD has been found in children with higher car-
bonated beverage intakes [194, 201]. McGartland et al. [194]
found a significant inverse relationship between total carbon-
ated beverage intake and heel (but not forearm) BMD among
girls after adjusting for age, height, weight, pubertal status,
social status, alcohol intake, smoking habits, physical activity,
liquid milk consumption, and calcium obtained from sources
other than liquid milk. These findings suggest that aBMD in
girls may be more sensitive to the effects of carbonated bev-
erages compared with boys. McGartland et al. [194] also ob-
served a significant inverse association between carbonated
beverage intake and milk intake in both boys and girls.
Remarkably few studies have considered the potential ef-
fects of caffeinated beverages on peak bone mass. Caffeine
consumption is of concern because it is associated with in-
creased urinary excretion of calcium [203]. In a cross-
sectional study of young white women, aged 19–26 years
(n=177), Conlisk and Galuska [204] examined the associa-
tion of caffeine consumption and femoral neck BMD.
Caffeine intake was estimated by self-reported consumption
of coffee, decaffeinated coffee, tea, colas, chocolate products,
and select medications. After adjustment for potential con-
founders (height, BMI, age at menarche, calcium intake, pro-
tein consumption, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use),
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
1351
 caffeine consumption was not significantly associated with
aBMD. These findings do not provide support for negative
effects of caffeine intake in this age range.
Fruits and vegetables
To our knowledge, there are no long-term prospective studies
of vegetarian children with bone outcomes. Few studies have
examined the influences of vegetarian dietary patterns on
bone, but there is some evidence in adults that adhering to
vegan diets is associated with lower bone mass [205] and
fractures [206]. It has been hypothesized that following a diet
composed primarily of fruits and vegetables would provide a
nutrient profile, specifically higher potassium and plant-based
proteins, which would favorably influence acid–base balance
and bone mass [207]. Alternatively, following a vegetarian
diet may exclude certain food groups that contain essential
bone-related nutrients such as calcium [208], although a re-
cent large US study using National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) data found no differences
in calcium intakes between strict vegetarians and nonvegetar-
ians [209]. In an editorial, Lanham-New [210] takes the posi-
tion that vegetarianism is not a serious risk factor for osteopo-
rosis. She recognizes that the study of vegetarian dietary pat-
terns and bone is complex because specific patterns of vege-
tarian diets include or exclude bone-related nutrients and life-
style factors, serum hormone concentrations, and dietary as-
sessment methods could confound the findings.
Our evidence grade for food patterns was based on 3 RCTs
showing a positive benefit of dairy consumption to bone ac-
crual, 1 RCT using mixed chain length fermentable fibers, and
12 observational studies, respectively.
Grade: Level of evidence B was assigned for the benefit
of dairy consumption on bone. Level of evidence C was
assigned for the benefit of certain types of fiber and fruit
and vegetable intake on bone, as well as for a detrimental
effect of cola and caffeinated beverages on bone.
Infant nutrition (Table 9)
The search for infant nutrition identified 1 RCT and 10 obser-
vational studies published since 2000, encompassing 2715
individuals (Table 9). In the identified RCT, Koo et al. [211]
found a positive effect of infant formula enriched with palm
olein on bone mineral accretion in healthy term infants com-
pared to the control formula. Of the ten observational studies
identified in the search, three compared the effects of duration
of breastfeeding [212–214], three assessed later bone out-
comes in breast-fed versus formula-fed infants [215–217],
two assessed later bone outcomes of breast-fed infants only
[218, 219], and two compared breast-fed versus formula-fed
versus enriched formula-fed infants [220, 221].
Formula-fed infants had better BMC and BMD in the first
6 months of life compared to breast-fed infants in two of the
observational studies [215, 216]; however, breastfeeding was
shown to be advantageous in two observational studies
assessing later bone outcomes in 8-year-old children [217,
219] and 16-year-old adolescents [218]. Mixed results were
obtained for studies testing the duration of breastfeeding in
infants who were exclusively breast-fed [212–214]. The addi-
tion of palm olein and sn-2 palmitate to infant formula was not
shown to be beneficial on later total body BMC outcomes in
4.5- and 10-year-old children [220, 221]. This is contrary to
the RCT by Koo et al. [211].
Our evidence grade for infant nutrition was based on the
lack of RCTs, inconsistent length of follow-up observational
studies, and lack of consistent results across studies.
Grade: Level of evidence D was assigned for the benefit
of duration of breastfeeding on bone. Level of evidence D
was assigned for the benefit of breastfeeding versus for-
mula feeding on bone. Level of evidence D was assigned
for the benefit of enriched formula feeding on bone.
Adolescent special issues
Detriment of DMPA injections and oral contraceptives
(Table 10) The search for contraception identified no RCTs,
8 observational studies, and no cross-sectional studies since
2000, encompassing 1815 individuals (Table 10). Six studies
reported null effects of oral contraceptives (OCs) versus a con-
trol on bone [222–227] and two studies reported suppression of
bone mineral accrual and bone mass acquisition in adolescents
[228, 229]. Injections of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate
(DMPA) showed a consistent detrimental effect to bone in three
studies [225, 226, 230], while one study found null effects
[227]. An additional study suggested that the change in body
weight due to DMPA injection may override the potential det-
rimental effect to bone [222].
Grade: Level of evidence B was assigned for the detri-
ment of DMPA injections on bone. Level of evidence D
was assigned for the detriment of OCs on bone.
Detriment of alcohol (Table 11) The search for alcohol iden-
tified no RCTs, 3 prospective studies, and 5 cross-sectional
studies published since 2000, encompassing 3352 individuals
(Table 11). Four studies used peripheral DXA measurements
only. There was large variability among studies in the amount
of alcohol consumed by study participants and the classifica-
tion of alcohol intake from ever tried to number of drinks per
1352
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
 day. Overall, the reported alcohol consumption by adolescents
studied was relatively low. In some studies, adolescents who
consumed alcohol were more likely to smoke [231–235], ne-
cessitating statistical adjustment for smoking to investigate the
independent effects of alcohol intake on bone. The majority of
studies found no association between alcohol intake and bone
outcomes [232, 233, 235–237]. Among studies reporting a
statistically significant association, the direction of the associ-
ation was inconsistent. Some reported that alcohol intake was
associated with lower bone density [231], whereas others re-
ported that alcohol intake was associated with higher bone
density [234, 238].
Our evidence grade for alcohol consumption was based on
insufficient data to support a hypothesis, owing to no RCTs,
low alcohol exposure, and multiple methodological differ-
ences among the few studies performed.
Grade: Level of evidence D was assigned for the detri-
ment of alcohol on bone.
Detriment of smoking (Table 12) The search for smoking
identified no RCTs, 6 prospective studies, and 7 cross-
sectional studies published since 2000, encompassing 13,
955 individuals (Table 12). Six of the studies used peripheral
DXA, and two studies examined stress fractures as the bone
outcome. There was large variability among studies with re-
spect to extent of smoking in the study participants, both in
terms of the proportion who had ever smoked as well as fre-
quency of smoking (e.g., cigarettes per day). Smoking expo-
sure was lowest in young adolescents and increased with age
up to young adulthood. Classification of smoking exposure
for statistical analyses was also variable across studies (e.g., 1
puff in lifetime versus daily smoking). Some studies reported
that adolescents who smoked were more likely than their non-
smoking peers to engage in behaviors that also could nega-
tively impact bone health, namely lower physical activity
levels [238, 239], lower dietary calcium intake [239], and
greater alcohol use [231–235], making statistical adjustment
for these behaviors critical to enable the interpretation of study
findings.
Results from studies examining the association between
bone density and smoking during adolescence are mixed.
Some find significant deficits in bone mass or aBMD at one
or more skeletal sites, ranging from −1.8 (not available for all
studies) to −6.5 % [232–234, 239, 240], whereas others found
no difference in bone according to smoking exposure [231,
235–237]. In the prospective study of adolescent females
(aged 13–19 years) by Dorn et al. [233], the effect of smoking
on bone accrual became more pronounced as girls got older.
Compelling data demonstrating the deleterious effects of
smoking on bone come from studies of military recruits.
Among male military recruits (aged 18–22 years), Lorentzon
et al. [239] found that smoking ≥1 cigarette/day (average
9/day) for an average of 4 years was associated with lower
aBMD ranging from −1.8 to 5.0 % depending on the skeletal
site. Cortical thickness measured by pQCT was −2.9 to
−4.0 % lower in smokers owing to greater endosteal circum-
ference. Eleftheriou et al. [238] found that aBMD at the hip
was −4.7 % lower among current smokers compared to never
smokers. By contrast, the authors found that ex-smokers had a
smaller (−4.3 to −5.0 %) periosteal circumference measured
by MRI compared to never smokers, but there were no differ-
ences in bone dimensions between current smokers and never
smokers. In a study of female military recruits, Lappe et al.
[42] found that a history of smoking was associated with an
increased risk (OR, 1.34; 95 % CI, 1.05, 1.71) of stress frac-
ture during 8 weeks of basic training. However, years of ex-
ercise, which was associated with a reduced risk of stress
fracture, was not accounted for in these analyses and effects
of smoking may have been overestimated. In a second study
of female military recruits, history of smoking was similarly
associated (OR, 1.32; 95 % CI, 0.99, 1.75) with risk of stress
fracture even when accounting for fitness (running speed) and
years of prior exercise [241].
Our evidence grade for smoking was based on multiple
well-designed cross-sectional studies.
Grade: Level of evidence C was assigned for the detri-
ment of smoking on bone.
Physical activity and exercise
Effect on bone mass and density (Table 13) The search for
the effects of physical activity on BMC identified 36 RCTs
and 20 observational studies published since 2000,
encompassing 9942 individuals (Table 13). Eighty-three per-
cent (n=30) of the RCT studies reported statistically signifi-
cant (P<0.05), and many were likely clinically significant
(~3 % difference), differences between exercise and control
groups at the completion of the intervention. With one excep-
tion [242], interventions finding no statistically significant
difference between exercise and control groups used similar
exercise volume, type, and length as those studies reporting
significant effects. Most of the exercise intervention studies of
prepubertal, early pubertal, and midpubertal children found
increases (~1–6 % difference over 6 months) in the bone min-
eral of the total body, hip, or lumbar spine. The type of inter-
ventions varied but typically ranged from 7 to 24 months in
duration, 2–5 sessions per week, 10–60 min per session, and
they included sports, games, dance, or high-impact exercises
(jumping, hopping). Fewer studies existed for late-pubertal
and postpubertal adolescents, and the effects were less dramat-
ic (0.3–1.9 % difference over 6 months), despite a similar
intervention dose compared to interventions that focused on
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
1353
 younger participants [156, 243]. For example, within the same
intervention, one study found skeletal effects in premenarchal
but not in postmenarchal females [244].
We reviewed 20 prospective longitudinal studies, with
90 % of these studies (n=18) reporting statistical differences
in bone mass or density between the most physically active
children and adolescents in their cohorts and those who were
less active. The range in percent difference was wide, although
studies that examined youth engaged in organized sports con-
sistently reported greater differences than other study popula-
tions. Two studies [54, 245] reported no differences in mass or
density between the most active and less active participants.
However, these studies used specific self-report measures of
physical activity known to have considerable measurement
error [246, 247]. By contrast, when using an objective mea-
sure of physical activity, the Iowa Bone Development Study
demonstrated 10–16 % greater hip BMC and 8 % greater hip
aBMD in participants who accumulated the greatest amount
of activity from childhood through adolescence (12-year fol-
low-up) [248]. One of the most important of the prospective
observational studies, the University of Saskatchewan
Paediatric Bone Mineral Accrual Study [3], used a mixed-
longitudinal design to evaluate relationships between self-
reported general level of physical activity and BMC in a group
of healthy Canadian adolescents. The investigators reported
that children and adolescents who were physically active at
ages 8–15 years had 8–10 % more hip BMC as young adults
(aged 23–30 years) compared to less active peers (after con-
trolling for their adult physical activity levels and baseline
bone outcomes). This study suggested the possibility of
long-term sustained benefits of childhood physical activity
on adult BMC [22]. In conclusion, long-term prospective ob-
servational studies of heterogeneous cohorts of youth have
examined self-selected, everyday physical activity levels and
BMC, aBMD, or vBMD. These studies have convincingly
and repeatedly shown that participation in high levels of phys-
ical activity is associated with greater bone mass accrual com-
pared to less active peers.
Our evidence grade for physical activity and exercise on
bone mass and density was based on consistent evidence from
many RCTs and observational studies.
Grade: Level of evidence A was assigned for the benefit
of physical activity and exercise on bone mass and
density.
Effect on bone structural outcomes (Table 14)
The search for the effects of physical activity on bone
structure/geometry identified 17 RCTs and 8 observational
studies published since 2000, encompassing 4722 individuals
(Table 14). Slightly more than one third (n=6) reported sta-
tistically significant effects of exercise on bone structural
outcomes. However, of the 11 studies that reported no statis-
tical differences between exercisers and controls, six reports
were from the same study (the Malmö Pediatric Osteoporosis
Prevention Study). This study was designed to evaluate
whether increasing time in physical activity in a cohort could
be used as a population-based prevention strategy to improve
bone outcomes. Prepubertal children were randomized by
schools into a 5-day/week, 40-min/day physical education
curriculum or a 1- to 2-day/week, 60-min/week curriculum.
The content of the physical education curricula did not differ
and specific osteogenic exercise was not prescribed. By con-
trast, in a 1-year RCT in young children (aged 3–5 years)
randomized at the individual level, Specker and Binkley [81]
used research staff to deliver (presumably) osteogenic exercise
(gross motor skills such as hopping, jumping, and skipping)
and reported that gross motor skill exercise increased perios-
teal and endosteal circumferences at the 20 % site of the distal
tibia compared to fine motor skill exercise. The effect of gross
motor exercise (2 % difference) persisted 1 year after follow-
up; however, the intervention group was also more physically
active at least 6 months after the intervention (raising the pos-
sibility that the sustained effect was due to continued high
levels of physical activity) [249]. Using a 7-month, 3-day/
week, ~12-min/day jumping protocol, researchers with the
University of British Columbia Centre for Hip Health and
Mobility [73] reported structural changes at the hip in early
pubertal girls (but not prepubertal girls) compared to controls
who stretched. The difference in section modulus, a measure
of the strength of bone during bending, was 4 %. A similar
University of British Columbia project by Macdonald et al.
[250] used a 16-month, 5-day/wk, ~15-min/day jumping pro-
tocol and compared this intervention to usual physical educa-
tion (which the intervention participants also received). A sig-
nificant difference of 3 % greater tibia midshaft tibia cross-
sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) in boys was reported.
Changes in CSMI suggest a change in cross-sectional geom-
etry due to increased periosteal apposition in one of the planes.
However, other structural differences were not statistically
significant in the study by Macdonald et al. [250].
We identified eight prospective observational studies that
examined associations between physical activity and whole
bone structure. All studies (100 %) found statistically signifi-
cant, and likely clinically significant, differences between the
most active and less active cohort members. The University of
Saskatchewan Pediatric Bone Mineral Accrual Study found
an 8–12 % greater CSA and section modulus of the proximal
femur in young adults who were active as adolescents (com-
pared to peers who were less active as adolescents) [251]. In
the same cohort, Duckham et al. [252] reported 13 % greater
polar SSI and 10 % total bone CSA of the tibia in young adults
who were active as adolescents compared to less active peers
during adolescence. In females, differences of 10 % greater
cortical CSA and 12 % cortical content of the tibia were found.

 CSA and section modulus of the femoral neck as well as
measures of tibial compressive and torsional strength have
also been associated with physical activity in the Iowa Bone
Development Study cohort. On average, the investigators re-
ported a 14 % difference in various measures between cohort
members who were most active during a 12-year follow-up
compared to those who were less active [248].
Our evidence grade for physical activity and exercise on
bone structure was based on semi-consistent evidence from
many RCTs and observational studies.
Grade: Level of evidence B was assigned for the benefit
of physical activity and exercise on bone structure.
Discussion
In this scientific statement, we updated a former effort pub-
lished in 2000 to summarize the lifestyle choices that influ-
ence development of peak bone mass [1]. Unlike the earlier
report, our review used a systematic approach to search pre-
dictors of bone mass from publications since 2000. We also
considered our knowledge of physiological functions and bi-
ology of growth for areas for which a systematic review was
not possible. Bone is a living tissue and as such requires all
essential nutrients for growth and maintenance. The bony
mineral tissue is composed of hydroxyapatite, a calcium-
phosphate compound, with magnesium and trace amounts of
other minerals. The connective tissue is composed primarily
of the protein, collagen. The role of many micronutrients in
bone is to assist in connective tissue synthesis and maturation.
Iron, zinc, magnesium, copper, manganese, and vitamin K are
cofactors in enzymes responsible for bone metabolism, colla-
gen synthesis, and cross-linking. Vitamin D is metabolized to
a steroid-like hormone that increases calcium absorption
through a saturable, facilitated diffusion pathway.
Mechanical loading from physical activity is essential to stim-
ulate bone modeling to provide the stimulus necessary to de-
velop a strong skeleton to support growth and development. In
children and adolescents, the important focus is on bone ac-
crual, with careful monitoring of growth parameters.
Unfortunately, in contrast with adults, children and adoles-
cents have not been the focus of research in many studies
relating lifestyle factors to bone density or quality.
Grade A evidence
Both physical activity and calcium intake had strong and
abundant evidence to be assigned a grade A level of evidence.
This level of evidence is not often attained and merits priority
action for public health efforts. Regrettably, calcium intake
and physical activity are not achieved in recommended levels
by our youth. A large difference in the nature of the evidence
between physical activity and calcium intake is apparent. The
evidence for physical activity and bone mass and geometry is
a global approach, whereas the evidence for calcium intake
and bone mass is a reductionist approach. The research avail-
able for physical activity does not examine the effects of spe-
cific types of exercise and few studies examine the dose load-
ing effects of any one type of exercise. Therefore, we conclude
that physical activity is important for growing bone, but we do
not fully understand the characteristics of physical activity that
impact bone such as mode, frequency, intensity, and duration.
On the other hand, studies of the effects of diet on bone usu-
ally look at a single nutrient effect; there is much less evidence
for the effects of diet quality as a whole. There is opportunity
for researchers in both fields to consider the approaches of the
other field.
Macronutrients
Fat
There was significant interest in dietary fat and bone metabo-
lism in the decade preceding the 2000 review by Heaney et al.
[1] that centered around ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids and bio-
markers of inflammation, primarily in animal models. Since
2000, the work has continued to examine the long-chain ω-3
fatty acids, DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid. The majority of
studies have been conducted in adults, and the findings are
equivocal with respect to improvements in bone mass [253].
Only one RCT was identified in children, but it was not in-
cluded in this review due to the short 16-week duration of the
intervention [254]. Prospective studies and RCTs in children
and adolescents are lacking, and it is premature at this time to
draw conclusions regarding the influences of dietary fat on
bone during growth.
Protein
During pubertal growth, BMC accrual is markedly influenced
by increasing IGF-I [181], and IGF-I is impacted by energy
and protein intakes. We considered studies addressing both
dietary protein intakes as well as PRAL. Prior to the 2000
review on peak bone mass by Heaney et al. [1], the interest
in dietary protein and bone centered on calcium/protein ratios
and calcium retention in adults, although the findings of sev-
eral protein and bone cross-sectional studies in adults were
mixed. Other dietary factors are also of interest including the
effect of specific dietary proteins with higher sulfur-
containing amino acids, which increase PRAL and may lead
to lower bone quality. Much of what is known regarding die-
tary protein and bone quality emanates from adult studies,
with limited work in children and adolescents. One short
(6 months) RCT in adolescents [143] showed no benefits to
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
1363
 material or geometrical properties of bone and was not gener-
alizable because it included only late adolescents and young
adults aged 18–25 years. The majority of prospective
[144–147] and cross-sectional [149–151, 153] studies support
a positive relationship between protein intake and bone. The
Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally
Designed (DONALD) Study [144, 145] demonstrated that
protein intake was positively, and PRAL was negatively, as-
sociated with the geometrical properties of the forearm in a
stepwise multiple regression model. Using biomarker data
from that same cohort, long-term protein intake estimated by
uN excretion and urinary PRAL were positively and negative-
ly associated with forearm cortical BMC and area, respective-
ly, when adjusting for age, sex, pubertal stage, forearm muscle
area, forearm length, and urinary calcium. To further support a
positive effect of dietary protein on bone growth, protein in-
take over approximately 8 years explained total body BMC
net gain in the University of Saskatchewan Pediatric Bone
Mineral Accrual Study [147]. In a multivariate regression
model, long-term protein intake (over 2 years) positively pre-
dicted total body BMC. Collectively, the prospective studies
lend support for a positive effect of protein on bone in growing
children.
Only one prospective study showed negative relationships
between dietary protein and bone [148]. The authors sug-
gested that the negative relationships might have been due to
low calcium intakes among the children. Consistent with this
notion, Vatanparast et al. [147] reported that the positive effect
of dietary protein on bone mass is most evident in those con-
suming adequate calcium (>1000 mg/day). Higher dietary
protein accompanied by low calcium intakes (i.e., lower
calcium/protein ratio) could lead to increased urinary calcium
excretion [255] and lower bone mass; however, RCTs are
needed to prove this assumption.
Micronutrients
Calcium
Storage of calcium in bone serves as a functional reserve to
offset dietary shortages of calcium and is tapped when needed
to maintain homeostasis. More than 99 % of the body’s calci-
um is in the skeleton as a consistent proportion of bone min-
eral. The calcium reserve is very large relative to the cellular
and extracellular metabolic pools of calcium; thus, dietary
insufficiency rarely impairs calcium-dependent biochemical
functions. However, long-term deficiency depletes the reserve
and subsequently decreases bone mass and bone strength.
Because the human skeleton contains only about 2–3 % of
the total adult body calcium at birth, the dietary requirements
for calcium during the first 20–30 years of life are determined
primarily by skeletal growth. Extreme calcium deficiency dur-
ing growth can cause rickets [256, 257]. However, even
moderate deficiency has deleterious effects on the skeleton,
both short term and long term.
Balance studies are useful to show the effect of a nutrient in
an otherwise controlled environment because the diet is strictly
controlled. These studies have shown that calcium is a thresh-
old nutrient, implying that calcium retention increases with
calcium intake until a plateau is reached. Balance studies, rather
than bone density or other skeletal measures, have been used to
demonstrate this phenomenon because finding the threshold
requires a range of intakes, which bracket the threshold intake.
This is possible in balance studies that are sufficiently short to
manage controlled diets until steady state is achieved. During
peak bone mass accrual, there are racial and sex differences in
the plateau calcium intake and the peak maximal retention in
adolescents. Black girls have a higher maximal retention than
white girls, and Chinese-American girls have the lowest max-
imal retention rates [258–260]. The intake at which the plateau
occurs is not different between white and black girls, but it is
lower in Chinese-American girls (1300 versus 970 mg/day).
White boys have higher peak calcium retention rates than white
girls, but the intake at which the plateau occurs is not different
[261]. Chinese-American boys had both higher maximal calci-
um retention rates and intakes for maximal retention (1100 mg/
day) than Chinese-American girls [260]. By contrast, Mexican-
American boys and girls do not have different rates of calcium
retention, and rates are similar to non-Hispanic white boys but
are higher than for non-Hispanic white girls [262]. The intake
for maximal retention for white adolescents has been
established as the RDA for calcium for adolescents [263].
The recommended intakes for Chinese-American, and perhaps
other Asian, adolescent girls could be lowered because maxi-
mal bone calcium accretion is achieved at lower calcium in-
takes than whites. However, actual calcium intakes for most
Asian adolescent populations are considerably below this lower
threshold intake [264]. Few balance studies have been conduct-
ed in children other than adolescents.
Numerous studies have been conducted to determine the
amount/types of dietary calcium needed for development of
maximal bone mass and strength and the ages/stages of devel-
opment at which calcium intake might be more critical.
Furthermore, efforts have been made to elucidate the relation-
ship between calcium intake and physical activity in maximiz-
ing skeletal development.
Heaney [265] recently proposed guidelines for systematic
reviews of clinical studies of nutrient effects. He proposed that
all studies included in a systematic review of nutrient intake
should have baseline nutrient status as an entry criterion and
should start with subjects at similar baseline nutrient status
values. Baseline nutrient status should be suboptimal, espe-
cially in the case of a threshold nutrient such as calcium. If
subjects are calcium replete, an intervention to increase calci-
um intake will usually produce a null effect. Heaney also
proposed that for inclusion, all studies should use similar
1364
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
 doses of the nutrient intervention and that co-nutrient status
should be optimized to ensure that the test nutrient is the only
nutrient-related factor in the response. However, in reality, few
studies meet all of Heaney’s proposed guidelines. The calcium
doses of studies found for this review ranged from 500 to
1200 mg/day. Only three studies supplemented with vitamin
D, which is an important co-nutrient for bone health.
Importantly, all reported baseline calcium intakes were below
the Institute of Medicine (IOM)—recommended levels, rang-
ing from 181 to 1199 mg/day. Thus, in studies of children and
adolescents whose average calcium intake is deficient, 90 %
of the RCTs detected a statistically and biologically significant
effect on bone accrual.
In our review of applicable RCTs, we found that designs of
calcium supplement studies are inconsistent with regard to
baseline calcium intake, supplement dose, optimization of vi-
tamin D, outcome variables (skeletal site, BMD versus BMC
versus area), and adjustment for confounders. Nonetheless,
we find that calcium supplementation, whether with pills, for-
tified foods, or dairy, consistently increases gain in skeletal
mass and density measures in children and adolescents, usu-
ally between 1.0 and 5.0 %. The skeletal sites showing a
calcium effect were widely varied among the studies. Some
studies did not adjust for body size, which confounds the
outcomes because growing children will all have increases
in BMC and BMD due to elongation of the skeleton. In addi-
tion, there is some evidence that calcium supplementation also
increases gain in height [162].
Vitamin D
Prior to the peak bone mass review published in 2000 [1], no
vitamin D RCTs in children or adolescents had been pub-
lished. Eight RCTs have been conducted since then using
vitamin D doses ranging from the equivalent of 200–
2000 IU/day, and these RCTs have primarily targeted female
subjects between the ages of 10 and 17 years [159, 170, 173,
175–178, 180]. Two publications [175, 176] originated from
the same Lebanese RCT, the only RCT to include males. Four
RCTs conducted in Lebanon, Finland, China, and the United
Kingdom provide moderate evidence to support vitamin D
supplementation effects on childhood and adolescent bone
mineral accrual. Using an intent-to-treat analysis, supplemen-
tation was shown to improve hip BMC [175] and geometrical
properties of the femoral neck [176] in females, but not males.
In subgroup analyses, the vitamin D effect was more pro-
nounced in prepubertal or early pubertal versus postpubertal
girls, as well as in those with lower versus higher baseline
25(OH)D. Two RCTs that provided evidence demonstrating
improvements in BMC gains after vitamin D supplementation
only did so when analyzing results using a compliance-based
analysis [177, 178]. Findings by Du et al. [170] and Khadilkar
et al. [178] support the beneficial effects of vitamin D
supplementation on total body BMC gains; however, unlike
the other single-nutrient studies, vitamin D was combined
with calcium. The remaining four RCTs [159, 173, 178,
180] did not show significant changes in BMC measures with
supplementation, likely due to the use of small sample sizes or
low vitamin D intervention doses, in some cases combined
with baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations above a thresh-
old for demonstrating an effect.
Comparing the findings from the RCTs is complicated
because of the different methodologies used to assess se-
rum 25(OH)D, including radioimmunoassay (Diasorin), en-
zyme immunoassay (Immunodiagnostic Systems), and
high-performance liquid chromatography. More confidence
in the findings is generated because all laboratories partic-
ipated in the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment
Scheme (DEQAS) and met the standards. Moreover, vari-
ous statistical approaches were employed among RCTs.
The RCT that presented the most compelling evidence
for a vitamin D effect on bone accrual presented intent-
to-treat, unadjusted data [175]. In another study, positive
findings were found only when taking into consideration
compliance and statistically adjusting for changes in bone
area, weight, and maturation [177]. The other RCTs ad-
justed for one or a combination of other potential con-
founders, including baseline bone values, bone area, age,
maturation, height, weight, fat-free soft tissue, calcium in-
takes, sunlight exposure, and physical activity.
It is important to note that mean baseline serum 25(OH)D
concentrations for all RCTs in our review were between 18
and 48 nmol/L, which are lower than the 50-nmol/L cutoff
used to define vitamin D sufficiency [245]. Using changes in
BMC as the primary outcome, even in study samples with
deficient-to-low serum 25(OH)D, supplementation did not
consistently promote gains. In a systematic review by
Winzenberg et al. [266], the authors concluded that vitamin
D supplementation is more likely to augment hip, forearm and
lumbar spine aBMD in children with low serum 25(OH)D
concentrations. To our knowledge, no RCTs with bone out-
comes have been conducted in children and adolescents with
serum 25(OH)D concentrations ≥50 nmol/L [263].
The osteogenic effects of calcitriol are attributed to its
role in serum calcium homeostasis, partially through regu-
lation of intestinal calcium absorption [267]. Calcium ab-
sorption was not assessed in the four RCTs in this review.
One dose–response RCT in children entering the early
stages of puberty with a mean baseline serum 25(OH)D
of 70 nmol/L showed no effects of supplementation on
fractional calcium absorption using vitamin D doses rang-
ing from 400 to 4000 IU over 12 weeks [268]. These
results are compatible with the aforementioned systematic
review [266], which stated that the beneficial effects of
vitamin D on bone may be less likely to occur in children
with sufficient serum 25(OH)D.

 Although we ranked the evidence for a positive effect of
vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral accrual in chil-
dren and adolescents as moderate, several unanswered ques-
tions remain. Only one study was conducted in males, and it is
therefore premature to make conclusions regarding sexual di-
morphism with respect to vitamin D supplementation and
bone. Moreover, subgroup analyses were conducted in several
studies in an attempt to identify critical times during childhood
and adolescence during which supplementation may be most
effective on bone. The results reported for premenarche, the
early stages of puberty, or the postmenarche years, however,
were inconsistent. These equivocal findings deserve further
investigation.
Micronutrients other than calcium and vitamin D
Few trials of any type have been conducted on micronutrients
other than calcium and vitamin D relevant to bone health to
guide recommendations. The studies on other micronutrients
included in this review were not generalizable or were limited
in sample size or other aspects of study design. Magnesium,
phosphorus, vitamin K, vitamin C, zinc, and other nutrients
play important structural and functional roles for bone. Only
magnesium was tested in an RCT, but this benefit to BMC was
only evaluated in a small group of white girls and only at one
level of supplementation. Results of the two studies that found
sex differences [189, 190] may be explained by the study
group being in a period of active bone modeling. Boys expe-
rience peak bone mass accrual later than girls [3]. The benefits
of vitamin C in the study by Prynne et al. [189] were not
observed in girls of the same age, likely because the girls were
more sexually mature. Benefits to younger girls were apparent
in the study by Laudermilk et al. [190]. In cross-sectional
analyses, inverse relations were observed between phosphorus
and sodium intake and total body BMC and size-adjusted
bone area [149]. Although phosphorus is an important com-
ponent of bone mineral, it may be a marker for cola intake (see
below under food patterns) or protein intake. The observed
negative effect of sodium on bone mass and area may be
explained by the negative effect of high dietary sodium in-
takes on calcium balance through greater urinary calcium ex-
cretion demonstrated in adolescent girls [269]. In that study,
the negative effect of dietary sodium was more pronounced in
white girls than in black girls. Calcium, magnesium, and po-
tassium retention were all greater in black adolescent girls
than in white adolescent girls [185, 269–271].
Vitamin K is a cofactor of vitamin K-dependent gamma-
carboxylase, an enzyme required for the activation (gamma-
carboxylation) of osteocalcin, a protein involved in bone for-
mation and mineralization. Undercarboxylation of
osteocalcin, a marker of vitamin K deficiency, was inversely
associated with BMC [191]. Kalkwarf et al. [192] were the
first to investigate the effects of vitamin K on bone mass and
bone turnover in young girls and found little benefit to bone,
except in the spine. It should be reemphasized that the girls in
this study were aged 3–16 years, representing a broad span in
terms of skeletal maturity. Even though experimental data
suggest a stimulatory effect of vitamin K on bone formation
[272], the relationship between vitamin K nutritional status
and development of peak bone mass and strength in humans
remains unclear.
Fluoride promotes osteoblast proliferation, increases
aBMD in adults, and has been used as a therapeutic option
for patients with osteoporosis [273]. The two prospective
studies in children and adolescents [186, 274] suggest a pos-
sible osteogenic benefit of living in a specific location with
higher fluoride concentrations in the water. Two US prospec-
tive reports from Iowa [187, 188], however, showed that life-
time fluoride intakes were not associated with BMC in 11- and
15-year-old adolescents. The public health benefits of water
fluoridation for dental caries prevention in children are well
documented, but the available limited evidence is insufficient
to draw conclusions regarding fluoride and bone during
growth.
Many of these micronutrients (i.e., calcium, vitamin D,
potassium, and for some subgroups, magnesium and vitamins
C and A) are shortfall nutrients compared to recommended
intakes as determined by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee [275].
Food patterns
The evidence since 2000 builds on earlier evidence, with ad-
ditional RCTs showing a benefit to bone owing to the inclu-
sion of dairy products in the diet. Dairy products contain col-
loidal calcium phosphate protein complexes in the form of
casein micelles that have the minerals and nutrients needed
for bone growth. Cross-sectional studies show a positive as-
sociation between fruit and vegetable intake and higher bone
mass. The explanation for the benefit of fruit and vegetable
intake to bone is not clear. The benefit may be because of the
nutrients that they provide, such as potassium, magnesium,
and vitamin C [189, 276]; bioactive ingredients from specific
fruits and vegetables, such as flavonoids [277]; or their alka-
line ash-forming properties [189]. Studies in children on any
of these hypotheses are limited. In a 4-year prospective study
in German children aged 6–18 years, urinary net acid excre-
tion, a good indicator of total body net endogenous acid load,
was unrelated to bone measures [145].
Carbonated beverage and cola consumption was associated
with reduced BMC, aBMD, or bone strength and higher frac-
ture in several cross-sectional studies shown in Table 8, espe-
cially in girls. The negative effect of cola beverages and caf-
feine may be directly related to increased urinary calcium with
caffeine or to excess phosphorus intake. To explore the poten-
tial mechanism by which carbonated beverages result in lower
1366
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
 bone accretion and fracture, Kristensen et al. [278] examined
biomarkers of bone turnover in a controlled crossover inter-
vention study with 11 men (aged 22–29 years). The authors
compared 10 days on a low-calcium diet with cola versus milk
added to the diet. The high cola intake was associated with
increased bone turnover compared to the period of high milk
intake. Alternatively, the negative effect of carbonated bever-
age consumption on bone may be explained by associated
factors including low milk intake, reduced physical activity,
and higher BMI [201]. The effect of diet on bone turnover in
the study by Kristensen et al. [278] could be due to calcium in
milk, rather than the cola, given that dietary calcium reduces
bone resorption in adolescent girls [279]. Milk displacement
by soft drinks is associated with reduced intakes of calcium
and other nutrients found in milk. Regardless of the mecha-
nism, the evidence suggests that cola consumption while on a
low-calcium diet can have adverse effects on bone accretion
and retention.
Bioactive food components may influence human gut mi-
crobial diversity, which in turn may offer a positive impact on
skeletal health. The role of the gut microbiome in regulating
bone mass was recently demonstrated using a germ-free
mouse model [280]. Flavonoids, found ubiquitously in nature
in many plant-derived foods, may also have the potential to
positively affect bone health. Although our search did not
identify any RCTs that assessed the effect of any flavonoid
subclass (or polyphenols in general) in children or adoles-
cents, several animal and/or in vitro analyses have shown a
biological plausibility for these compounds to affect bone
turnover and markers of bone health [277]. Because of their
structural similarity to estrogen, soy isoflavones are currently
the main class of flavonoids studied for their role in bone
health.
Total dietary fiber does not appear to be related to bone
accrual, but fibers that are fermentable to short-chain fatty
acids in the lower gut by the gut microbiome are associated
with increased calcium absorption [281–283]. In the only in-
tervention study of sufficient duration to examine effects on
BMC accrual, a combination of short- and long-chained fruc-
tooligosaccharides showed a significant benefit [193].
Infant nutrition
Breastfeeding during the first year of life has long been sug-
gested to be optimal for infant nutrition; however, the avail-
able scientific literature is conflicting in terms of bone and
fracture outcomes. Formula feeding may have the potential
to increase short-term BMC and BMD outcomes [215, 216],
possibly due to higher amounts of nutrients such as calcium
and vitamin D in most infant formulas compared with breast
milk (to note, infant formula contents likely vary between and
within observational studies). An older landmark RCT [284]
supports this hypothesis and reported that during the first
6 months of life, bone accretion is less in infants fed human
or low-mineral formula but is greater in the second 6 months
of life. Data from observational studies remain inconsistent
since 2000. Additional studies addressing the impact of the
duration of breastfeeding on peak bone mass development are
also needed because current observational data have shown
inconsistent results [212–214, 251]. It is important to note
potential confounding bias because mothers who breastfeed
have been shown to adopt other positive health behaviors for
their children that could influence the development of peak
bone mass. It is important to note that the American Academy
of Pediatrics has recommended that infants who are breast-fed
and children and adolescents who consume less than 1 L of
vitamin D-fortified milk per day will likely need supplemen-
tation to reach 400 IU of vitamin D per day [285].
Data from the RCT assessing the effects of infant formula
enriched with palm olein showed positive effects in relation to
total body BMC at 3 and 6 months [211]. However, observa-
tional studies of children aged 4.5 and 10 years who consumed
infant formula with either added palm olein or sn-2 palmitate
during their infancy showed no significant differences in total
body BMC [220, 221]. Overall, the data suggest that enrich-
ment of infant formula with palm olein may be beneficial
during the first 6 months of life.
Adolescent special issues
Detriment of DMPA injections and oral contraceptives
Data are conflicting regarding the effect of combined OCs on
bone density among adolescent girls. OC pill use by healthy,
white, teenage females did not affect acquisition of peak bone
mass in one study [223]. However, studies that have examined
the effect of low-dose estrogen OCs suggest otherwise. Some
data suggest that long-term treatment with an oral monophasic
contraceptive formulation (ethinylestradiol 20 μg +
desogestrel 0.150 mg) raises concerns about suboptimal
achievement of peak bone mass [286], especially when initi-
ated during the teenage years. The skeletal effects of com-
bined OCs are of greater concern in adolescents compared to
their use in adult women [287, 288]. Initiation of combined
OCs within the first 3 years after menarche is of particular
concern [288]. OCs suppress endogenous estradiol production
by suppressing the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis.
There is growing consensus that OCs containing 20 μg of
ethinylestradiol interfere with acquisition of peak BMD, al-
though some studies have had inherent limitations including
smoking status, small sample size, poor accounting for con-
founders, and so forth [289].
Contraception via injections of DMPA is associated with
skeletal deficit at the spine and hip when used before peak
bone mass. DMPA acts on the skeleton mainly through estro-
gen deficiency [230]. Pharmacological doses of DMPA may
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
1367
 also possess selective glucocorticoid activity and can alter the
expression of glucocorticoid receptor-regulated genes.
However, weight gain on DMPA may mitigate loss of BMD
among adolescent users [222]. In addition, bone loss in female
adolescents receiving DMPA for contraception is partly or
fully reversible following discontinuation of DMPA, with
faster recovery at the spine than at the hip [290]. DMPA is
still used commonly in adolescents, but with caution given the
potential skeletal implications.
Detriment of alcohol
Alcohol abuse is associated with lower aBMD and increased
risk of fracture among adults. However, the association be-
tween low to moderate alcohol intake and bone density in
adults is inconsistent, with low to moderate intakes associated
with higher aBMD than that of abstainers in some studies
[291]. Likewise, there is little evidence that alcohol intake at
levels currently reported in studies among adolescents to date
has any effect on attainment of peak bone mass. An important
limitation of published studies is the ability to identify the
effects of consuming large daily amounts alcohol (>3 serv-
ings/day) on bone due to its low reported prevalence in these
studies.
There has been large variability among studies in the
amount of alcohol consumed by study participants and the
classification of alcohol intake from ever tried to number of
drinks per day. Overall, the reported alcohol consumption by
adolescents studied was relatively low. In some studies, ado-
lescents who consumed alcohol were more likely to smoke
[231–235], necessitating statistical adjustment for smoking
to investigate the independent effects of alcohol intake on
bone.
Binge drinking is an important consideration for adoles-
cents, because about 90 % of the alcohol consumed by ado-
lescents aged <21 years in the USA is in the form of binge
drinking [292]. We did not identify any studies that examined
the association between binge drinking on bone health in
adolescents.
Detriment of smoking
Despite abundant evidence that smoking has many deleterious
health effects, cigarette smoking continues to be common
among adolescents and adults. In 2011, 18.1 % of high school
students in the USA smoked ≥1 cigarettes in the last 30 days
and 19.0 % of adults were current smokers [293].
The strength of evidence regarding the association between
smoking and bone in adolescence has been limited by meth-
odological challenges in quantifying smoke exposure and the
need to disentangle the effects of smoking from other lifestyle
factors such as physical activity, dietary calcium intake, and
alcohol consumption. Differences in results across studies
arise, in part, due to challenges in characterizing exposure
and the low prevalence of regular smoking, limiting statistical
power. Despite methodological challenges, results of the stud-
ies reviewed herein support the contention that smoking in
adolescents may reduce peak bone mass. The large studies
of young adult military recruits provide additional evidence
that a history of smoking has deleterious effects on bone. Even
if the effect of smoking during adolescence on bone mass is
small, it may become important if the deleterious effects of
smoking on aBMD compound over time. Adolescents who
smoke often continue smoking in adulthood, possibly increas-
ing their risk of osteoporosis and fracture later in life.
If the associations between active and passive smoke ex-
posure and aBMD are causally related, curtailment of active
and passive smoke exposure to children of all ages will likely
facilitate maximal attainment of peak bone mass [294].
Physical activity and exercise
We judged the evidence of a positive effect of physical activity
on mass and density as strong (Level A). The evidence is less
clear in support of a positive effect of physical activity on
structure; therefore, we judged the evidence to be moderate
at this time (Level B). Similar bone structure RCT designs
have resulted in positive effects [28, 81, 250, 295, 296], no
effects [25, 244, 297–303], and different effects based on gen-
der or maturity status [73]. However, despite the inconsis-
tencies in RCT results, the evidence provided by well-
designed RCTs [81] and prospective cohort studies [252] sup-
ports a positive effect on structure, including those using ob-
jective measures of physical activity [248]. Unlike RCTs with
mass and density outcomes, the multitude of structural mea-
sures, sites for measurement (distal, proximal), and inconsis-
tencies in adjustment for bone size present a unique challenge
in evaluating the quality of studies examining and interpreting
exercise effects on structure. A design limitation in most of the
reviewed RCT studies (mass, density, and structure) was an
inability to adequately assess the following: the physical ac-
tivity levels of controls, the degree of effort in the exercisers,
and the activity levels of the exercisers during periods of non-
intervention. In short, issues of compliance were common
threats to internal validity. In addition, physical activity inter-
ventions, in general, are susceptible to compensation effects
(i.e., the intervention group does less physical activity outside
of the intervention session to maintain a Bnormal^ activity
routine) [304].
There is a need to more precisely deliver the exercise dose
and to understand the levels of physical activity in control and
intervention groups. Laboratory-based work indicates an os-
teogenic effect at or above mechanical loads of 4.2 g-force
[305], whereas RCTs suggest an osteogenic effect at or above
3.5 g-force [24, 306]. RCTs also suggest 3 days/week with
100 loads per session and approximately 7 months of
1368
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
 intervention are needed to detect change [24, 306, 307]. Due
to the overlap in time and frequency in interventions that show
change and those that do not, specific recommendations for
these exercise dimensions (time and frequency) are equivocal
[25, 73, 295, 301, 302]. At present, 100 loads per session and
3 days/week are reasonable time and frequency dimensions
based on successful RCTs [24, 73, 306].
Almost all of the physical activity-related RCTs included in
our review used jumping as the primary exercise type. This is a
sound decision because jumping is the gross motor skill that
mechanically loads the clinically important site of the hip via
muscle loading during takeoff and via impact loading during
landing. Animal and human studies have shown that jumping
imposes a greater anabolic stimulus on bone than running or
walking [306, 308], and the latter are activities commonly pre-
scribed for metabolic health and obesity prevention. The
known differences in types of physical activities for different
targeted health outcomes suggest a need to promote physical
activities that incorporate multiple motor skills (e.g., soccer,
tumbling, tennis) or promote diverse physical activity patterns.
In addition to the RCTs and prospective longitudinal studies
that we reviewed and graded, other types of research support
physical activity as a causal factor for healthy bone mass, den-
sity, and structure [309]. Many of the mechanisms and path-
ways have been elucidated in laboratory studies [82, 308, 310]
and the theoretical underpinning of why physical activity is
expected to influence mass, density, and structure is clearly
described in Frost’s mechanostat model [77, 78], which is well
respected in the greater scientific community [311–313].
Research gaps
We have identified many questions that will drive a future
research agenda (Table 15). Trials should be designed to obtain
at least B-level evidence. The following areas merit further
investigation: differing effects of interventions depending on
the life stage of growth; gene–environment interactions and
how they may impact the development of peak bone mass;
the need to identify and utilize biomarkers of exposure and
effects; and the interaction of bone with other tissues through-
out the body. It is important to recognize that the pediatric
skeleton with open epiphyses differs from that of a fully grown
adult who has reached his or her peak bone mass, and therefore,
meaningful clinical targets and response to interventions will
also differ. In addition, longitudinal studies are needed to doc-
ument the relationship between growth and measures of bone
fragility and fractures and to identify lifestyle interventions that
may prevent fractures during this period of susceptibility.
Statistical guidelines
Analysis and interpretation of data from studies examining the
effects of nutrition, dietary components, and physical activity
on bone mass and/or strength requires thoughtful consider-
ation (Table 16). Foremost is the baseline of the dietary or
physical activity exposure in the study population. This is
particularly important for threshold nutrients or dietary com-
ponents that do not have a linear association with bone mea-
sures across a broad range of intakes. Animal studies also
indicate that the effects of physical activity are likely to satu-
rate [310]. In randomized trials, it is important to select par-
ticipants who are likely to benefit from additional intake and/
or exercise. For example, if usual intake of calcium exceeds
requirements, then it is unlikely that any benefit of the inter-
vention will be detected. The duration of the intervention is
critical to consider in the design of intervention trials and

 should be appropriate for the bone measure under study.
Changes in calcium balance may be measureable within
3 weeks, whereas measureable changes in bone mass or
strength due to a dietary and/or exercise intervention may
not be evident for 6–12 months.
Subject characteristics, including age, sex, race, matura-
tional stage, and skeletal or body size, should also be consid-
ered in the design and analysis of studies examining the asso-
ciation between nutrition or physical activity and bone out-
comes because they are strongly associated with bone mea-
sures during growth. Statistical adjustment for these charac-
teristics can dramatically reduce residual variability in regres-
sion models and improve statistical power to identify associ-
ations among dietary intake, physical activity, and bone. In
addition, statistical adjustment may compensate for imbal-
ances in these variables across ranges (observational studies)
or among intervention groups (randomized trials). Several ap-
proaches have been used to account for skeletal size, the most
common being height or bone area. Several chronic medical
conditions (e.g., anorexia nervosa, cystic fibrosis, etc.)
[314–318] and medications (e.g., glucocorticoids, anticonvul-
sants) [72, 319] are known to affect bone accrual during
growth, and these should be accounted for in the study design
or statistical analyses. Finally, prospective studies, both ran-
domized trials and observation studies, should consider ad-
justment for baseline bone values and exposures to minimize
the statistical phenomenon of regression toward the mean.
Implementation
Dietary intakes and physical activity levels of most US youth
during the development of peak bone mass do not support
maximal bone mass accretion for genetic potential. This in-
creases risk for fracture both during childhood and later in life.
Adherence to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)/US
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Dietary
Guidelines for Americans and HHS Physical Activity
Guidelines for Americans is an important and positive step
toward ensuring healthy bone growth and/or maintenance
throughout the lifecycle.
Diet
The recommended intakes of food groups and nutrients rele-
vant to bone, their bone-related functions, and intake status are
given in Tables 17 and 18. Shortfall food groups include dairy,
fruits, and vegetables (Table 17). Consequently, intakes of
nutrients provided by these food groups often do not meet
national recommendations (Table 18). Dairy products provide
most of the calcium and vitamin D in the diet as well as high-
quality protein and significant amounts of magnesium, potas-
sium, and other essential nutrients. Yet, approximately 66 %
of boys and 83 % of girls during the time of peak height
velocity do not meet the recommended intakes of milk
[320]. Low intakes of fruits and vegetables can lead to insuf-
ficient intakes of vitamins A, C, E, and K and potassium.
Potassium has only recently been associated with bone health
[276]. Additional research is needed to confirm why higher
fruit and vegetable intakes seem to contribute to pediatric bone
health among cross-sectional studies. At present, continuing
to advocate for children and adolescents to obtain recom-
mended intakes of fruits and vegetables as described by the
Dietary Guidelines for Americans has no downside, and may
offer a potential benefit toward development of peak bone
mass.
Recommended intakes of vitamin D are particularly diffi-
cult to achieve without fortified foods or supplements.
Enriched and fortified foods provide almost 60 % of dietary
vitamin D and 30 % of vitamin A as well as substantial
amounts of B vitamins and iron [321]. Fortified foods provide
most of the vitamin D in the US diet [263, 275]. Most US milk
is fortified with 100 IU of vitamin D per cup [263]. Breakfast
cereals often contain added vitamin D, as do some brands of
orange juice, yogurt, margarine, and soy beverages. The USA
requires infant formula to contain a minimum of 40 IU and a
maximum of 100 IU of vitamin D per 100 kcal (21 CFR
107.100). Low-income, overweight/obese, and minority pop-
ulations of children in the USA have been shown to have
lower intakes of both vitamin D and calcium [209].
Very few foods naturally have vitamin D. Fatty fish (e.g.,
salmon, tuna, and mackerel) and fish liver oils are the best
sources, whereas beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks contribute
small amounts [263]. Some mushrooms naturally provide vi-
tamin D, and mushrooms and yeast are available with en-
hanced levels of vitamin D from being exposed to ultraviolet
light [322–324] but are scarce on the market.
There is recent growing interest in the possibility that in-
take of 25(OH)D, the metabolized form of vitamin D that is
also present in animal foods such as meat, poultry, and eggs,
may be contributing to vitamin D status in humans [325].

 Amounts of 25(OH)D in foods currently are not included in
the USDA food tables. Studies that have reported discrepan-
cies between estimated vitamin D intakes and serum levels of
25(OH)D are driving the interest in determination of
25(OH)D in foods.
Physical activity
Regular physical activity in youth promotes healthier bones
throughout childhood and adolescence. As part of the feder-
ally recommended ≥60 min of daily physical activity, children
and adolescents should include bone-strengthening physical
activity at least 3 days of the week. Bone-strengthening activ-
ities are those that are dynamic, moderate to high in load
magnitude, short in load duration, odd or nonrepetitive in load
direction, and applied quickly [84, 326].
Although complete data are lacking, the IOM estimates that
only about one half of youth meet the current HHS Physical
Activity Guidelines for Americans’ recommendation for
≥60 min of daily moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical ac-
tivity. The number of youth meeting this recommendation
decreases with age [327] and precipitously declines in early
adolescence, a time when bone appears most responsive to
physical activity. Throughout childhood and adolescence,
girls are less active than boys and are clearly missing oppor-
tunities to optimize bone health. The US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that as many as one
third of youth report no physical activity in the preceding
5 days [328]. Regrettably, participation in bone-
strengthening physical activities is not measured in the CDC
Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. Daily opportuni-
ties for incidental physical activity have declined for both
children and adolescents as a result of factors such as in-
creased reliance on nonactive transportation, automation of
activities for daily living, and greater opportunities for seden-
tary behavior. Disparities in opportunities for physical activity
exist across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic profiles [327].
Taking action
A multilayered approach must be applied to achieving the
recommendations of the Dietary and Physical Activity
Guidelines for Americans.
Families
Adults must model and participate in healthy behaviors and
engage with family members during mealtime and exercise.
Government resources such as MyPlate and the Youth
Physical Activity Guidelines Toolkit are informative resources
for parents.
Schools
Schools must continue to improve and implement optimal
nutrition standards through programs such as the National
School Lunch Program and the National School Breakfast
Program. Specific strategies for creating an optimal

a RDA is the average daily dietary intake level that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97–98 %) healthy individuals in a group. It is calculated from the EAR, which is the average
daily nutrient intake level estimated to meet the requirements of half of the healthy individuals in a group. If sufficient scientific evidence is not available to establish an EAR, and thus calculate an RDA, an
AI is usually developed. EARs have not been established for vitamin K, potassium, manganese, or other nutrients not yet evaluated via the DRI process

 environment for inclusive physical education, extracurricular
physical activities, and active classrooms are provided in the
USA, most recently by the 2012 Physical Activity Guidelines
for American’s Midcourse Report: Strategies to Increase
Physical Activity Among Youth [329] and the recent IOM re-
port Educating the Student Body: Taking Physical Activity and
Physical Education to School [327]. Early knowledge of nu-
trition and physical activity through consumer sciences and
physical education courses should be mandatory in every K–
12 school. Recess should be mandatory for every K–5 school.
Healthcare system
All allied healthcare providers should be required to be profi-
cient in both counseling for nutrition and physical activity
through their required curriculum and continuing education.
Scientific groups such as the National Osteoporosis
Foundation, the American Society for Nutrition, the
Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the American College
of Sports Medicine, and the Society for Health and Physical
Educators among others should provide tool kits and educa-
tional materials with consistent messaging on nutrition and
physical activity for bone health to allied healthcare providers.
Federal, state, and local policy
Government support for healthy growth and development
should reach beyond obesity to antecedents of chronic disease,
including osteoporosis. Subsidizing foods for bone health
through programs such as Head Start, the National School
Breakfast Program, the National School Lunch Program, the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children helps to ensure that all children meet their nutrition
requirements. Examples of how physical activity requirements
are supported include the Federal Safe Routes to Schools
Program and the Let’s Move program, as well as public–private
sector collaborations such as the NFL Play 60 Challenge and
the Partnership for a Healthier America. Through zoning, in-
centives, and innovative cooperative agreements with busi-
nesses, local governments can help to ensure access to fresh
food as well as parks and youth recreation opportunities.
Expanding successful federal, state, and local nutrition and
physical activity programs as well as facilitating innovative
collaboration between the public and private sectors are critical
to creating a society in which bone health matters.
Conclusions
There is a critical need for more research focusing on bone
health in youth. Future research should consider sex, popula-
tion ancestry, and maturation. When possible, standardizing
outcome measures would facilitate the pooling of data for
evidence-based reviews.
The best evidence is available for positive effects of calci-
um intake and physical activity, especially during the late
childhood and peripubertal years—a critical period for bone
accretion. Good evidence is also available for a role of vitamin
D and dairy consumption. However, more work is needed on
physical activity dose response and the potential interaction
between physical activity and diet quality. Weaker but physi-
ologically plausible evidence is available and emerging for the
effects of macronutrients and other micronutrients on bone
among youth. It is important to address the factors most
strongly linked to developing peak bone mass and strength
from the current evidence through multilayered public health
strategies. It is equally important to develop a research agenda
to better understand other lifestyle factors that are less clearly
understood for the purpose of building strong and healthy
bones. Meanwhile, meeting federal guidelines for intakes of
nutrients and physical activity while cautioning against harm-
ful behaviors is a priority strategy.
Glossary
Terminology
Acronym Definition
Areal bone
mineral density
aBMD
DXA calculates BMD using area.
This is not an accurate
measurement of the true bone
mineral density, which is mass
divided by volume. It is a
reasonable estimate of BMC.
Bone mineral
content
BMC
DXA measures the BMC of the spine,
hip, wrist, femur, or any other
selected part of the skeleton. It does
this by focusing an x-ray on a body
site and measuring the proportion
of light rays that pass through the
tissue as opposed to being blocked
by minerals in the bone. Using
computer software, it then divides
that number by the surface area of
the bone being measured to create
BMD.
Bone mineral
density
BMD
BMD refers to the amount of mineral
matter per square centimeter of
bone. BMD is used as a predictor of
osteoporosis and fracture risk.
Computed
tomography
CT
CT is an imaging procedure that uses
special x-ray equipment to create a
series of detailed pictures, or scans,
of areas inside the body. It is also
called computerized tomography
and computerized axial tomogra-
phy (CAT) scanning.
Cross-sectional
moment of inertia
CSMI
CSMI is a measure of the distribution
of material around a given axis. It is
used to calculate bending stress.
Dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry
DXA
DXA is a means of measuring BMD.
It is the most widely used and most
1374
Osteoporos Int (2016) 27:1281–1386
 thoroughly studied bone density
measurement technology. Two x-
ray beams with different energy
levels are aimed at the patient’s
bones. When soft tissue absorption
is subtracted out, the BMD can be
determined from the absorption of
each beam by bone.
Hip structural analysis
HSA
HSA measures not only the BMD of
the hip bone but also structural
geometry of cross-sections travers-
ing the proximal femur at specific
locations. The bone mass image is
used directly from the DXA scan,
where pixel values are expressed in
areal mass (g/cm2). The method
employs the principle that a line of
pixel values across the bone axis
corresponds to a cut plane travers-
ing the bone at that location and
contains some of the information
about the cross-section.
Percentage of
undercarboxylated
osteocalcin
%ucOC
%ucOC is a measure of vitamin K
status. Osteocalcin is a vitamin K-
dependent protein produced by the
bone. The ratio of
undercarboxylated to carboxylated
or total osteocalcin has been
regarded as a marker of inadequate
vitamin K status.
Peripheral quantitative
computed
tomography
pQCT
pQCT is a type of quantitative CT
used for making measurements of
the BMD in a peripheral part of the
body, such as the forearms or legs,
as opposed to CT that measures
BMD at the hip and spine. pQCT is
useful for measuring bone strength.
Potential renal acid load PRAL
PRAL is a measure of the acidic or basic
effects that a food has on the body.
Quantitative computed
tomography
QCT
QCT measures BMD using a standard
CT scanner with a calibration
standard to convert Hounsfield
units (HU) of the CT image to
BMD values. QCT scans are pri-
marily used to evaluate BMD at the
lumbar spine and hip.
Stress–strain index
SSI
The SSI of a bone is a surrogate
measure of bone strength
determined from a cross-sectional
scan by QCT or pQCT. The SSI is
used to compare the structural
parameters determined by analysis
of QCT/pQCT cross-sectional
scans to the results of a three-point
bending test.
Volumetric bone
mineral density
vBMD
In addition to aBMD using DXA, a
projected posteroanterior lateral
vertebral scan is added to measure
vertebral width, height, and depth
to estimate vBMD. This permits
direct measurement of bone depth,
rather than estimation of projected
posteroanterior dimensions.
