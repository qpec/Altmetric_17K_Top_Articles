Abstract
The development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
pathogenesis remains unclear, but emerging evidence supports a
crucial role for inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue
(iBALT) in disease progression. Mechanisms underlying iBALT
generation, particularly during chronic CS exposure, remain to be
defined. Oxysterol metabolism of cholesterol is crucial to immune
cell localization in secondary lymphoid tissue. Here, we demon-
strate that oxysterols also critically regulate iBALT generation and
the immune pathogenesis of COPD. In both COPD patients and
cigarette smoke (CS)-exposed mice, we identified significantly
upregulated CH25H and CYP7B1 expression in airway epithelial
cells, regulating CS-induced B-cell migration and iBALT formation.
Mice deficient in CH25H or the oxysterol receptor EBI2 exhibited
decreased iBALT and subsequent CS-induced emphysema. Further,
inhibition of the oxysterol pathway using clotrimazole resolved
iBALT formation and attenuated CS-induced emphysema in vivo
therapeutically. Collectively, our studies are the first to mechanis-
tically interrogate oxysterol-dependent iBALT formation in the
pathogenesis of COPD, and identify a novel therapeutic target for
the treatment of COPD and potentially other diseases driven by
the generation of tertiary lymphoid organs.

Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause
of chronic mortality and morbidity worldwide with limited thera-
peutic options, characterized by progressive and largely irreversible
airflow limitation resulting from long-term exposure to toxic gases
and particles, in particular cigarette smoke (CS; Berndt et al, 2012;
Vogelmeier et al, 2017). This induces chronic bronchitis, small
airway remodeling, and emphysema (loss of septal tissue; Tuder &
Petrache, 2012). Growing evidence supports a crucial role for indu-
cible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in the develop-
ment of COPD (Hogg et al, 2004; Gosman et al, 2006; van der
Strate et al, 2006; Polverino et al, 2015; Faner et al, 2016). Further-
more, we and others have recently shown that an absence of

either
through
the
use
of
B
cell-deficient
mice
or
administration of anti-CXCL13 antibody or BAFF-receptor fusion
protein, prevented CS-induced emphysema in animal models of
COPD (Bracke et al, 2013; John-Schuster et al, 2014; Seys et al,
2015).
Inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue is a tertiary
lymphoid organ that develops in the lungs during infection,
autoimmunity,
or
chronic
inflammation
(Rangel-Moreno
et al,
2011;
Hwang
et al,
2016).
Interestingly,
iBALT
is
located
predominantly alongside the bronchial epithelium (Gregson et al,
1979). It is organized into regions of B-cell follicles surrounded
by T-cell zones reminiscent of conventional secondary lymphoid
organs
(Randall,
2010).
Follicular
dendritic
cells
and
high
endothelial venules are located in the B- and T-cell zones,
respectively
(Moyron-Quiroz
et al,
2004;
Rangel-Moreno
et al,
2007). A protective role for iBALT has been described due to
their ability to fight viral infection (Moyron-Quiroz et al, 2004;
Chiu
&
Openshaw,
2015),
and
however,
they
can
have
a
detrimental
impact
on
the
outcome
of
chronic
inflammatory
conditions such as COPD (Hwang et al, 2016). Their causative
role against COPD development and the mechanism underlying
iBALT positioning upon the bronchus, however, remains to be
defined.
The oxysterol metabolism of cholesterol has recently emerged
as a central pathway that regulates the structure and function of
secondary lymphoid tissue (Hannedouche et al, 2011; Liu et al,
2011; Gatto et al, 2013; Li et al, 2016). The sequential action of
two enzymes cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) and 25-hydroxy-
cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) synthesizes 7a,25-dihy-
droxycholesterol (7a,25-OHC) from cholesterol, the main ligand of
Epstein–Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2; also known as GPR183;
Hannedouche et al, 2011; Liu et al, 2011). EBI2 is a G protein-
coupled receptor expressed on lymphocytes and dendritic cells
(DCs), which plays a key role in their positioning within secondary
lymphoid tissue. EBI2 on B cells (Gatto et al, 2009; Pereira et al,
2009) and 7a,25-OHC generated by lymphoid stromal cells (Yi
et al, 2012) guides activated B-cell movement during humoral
responses.
In this study, we hypothesize that oxysterols are critically
involved in the immune pathogenesis of COPD by guiding B-cell
positioning within iBALT structures. We demonstrate, in both
COPD patients and CS-exposed mice, upregulated CH25H and
CYP7B1 expression in airway epithelial cells. Moreover, mice defi-
cient in CH25H or EBI2 exhibited decreased iBALT formation and
subsequent CS-induced emphysema. Further, activated B cells
through BCR cross-linking failed to migrate toward CS-stimulated
airways ex vivo following genetic or pharmacological inhibition of
the oxysterol pathway, establishing a role for oxysterol metabolism
in
guiding
iBALT
generation
to
the
airways
during
COPD
immunopathogenesis. Finally, inhibition of the oxysterol pathway,
using the CYP7B1 inhibitor clotrimazole, resolved B cell-driven
iBALT formation and attenuated CS-induced emphysema in vivo in
a therapeutic approach. Collectively, our studies are the first to
mechanistically interrogate oxysterol-dependent iBALT formation
in the pathogenesis of COPD, and identify a novel therapeutic
target for the treatment of COPD in particular, as well as other
chronic diseases driven by the generation of tertiary lymphoid
organs.
Results
Oxysterol metabolism increases in airway epithelial cells of COPD
patients and mouse
Airway epithelial cells secrete a plethora of immune mediators
(Benam et al, 2016), yet immunological factors that orchestrate
iBALT positioning remain to be defined. We analyzed transcrip-
tomics data from publically available datasets of small airway
epithelial cells from COPD patients (Tilley et al, 2011) combined
with our data derived from chronic CS-exposed mice lungs (John-
Schuster et al, 2014), revealing a conserved interspecies signature
for the expression of key genes related to the Gene Ontology terms
(Wang et al, 2013) of “Inflammatory Response”, “Macrophage Acti-
vation”, and “Leukocyte Migration” (Fig EV1A). Gene expression
patterns were also similar within the Gene Ontology term “Meta-
bolic Process”, and in particular, CH25H and CYP7B1 were upregu-
lated following both CS exposure in mice and in COPD patients
(Fig 1A). Similarly, RNAseq analysis of lung homogenates from an
independent COPD patient cohort confirmed higher CH25H expres-
sion in the lungs of COPD patients compared to non-smoking
control individuals (Fig 1B), supporting a previous study (Sugiura
et al, 2012). To demonstrate an association with emphysema, lung
core samples from a third independent cohort composed of emphy-
sematous and non-emphysematous tissue from the same COPD
patients were analyzed (Fig 1C). mRNA expression of CH25H and
the pro-inflammatory chemokine CXCL8 were significantly upregu-
lated in emphysematous regions rather than non-emphysematous
regions of COPD patient lungs, while in contrast to recent findings
(Faner et al, 2016), CXCL13 expression did not differ (Fig 1D).
Staining of airway sections revealed that CH25H was localized to
the airway epithelial cells in both human and mice (Fig 1E),
suggesting that the initiating lesion in both patients and mice follow-
ing chronic CS exposure emanates from the airways. CH25H mRNA
expression was elevated in isolated airway epithelial cells from
COPD patients compared to healthy smoking controls (fourth inde-
pendent cohort; Fig 1F), as well as in isolated mouse airways after
CS exposure, and remained elevated for at least 16 weeks (Fig 1G).
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from mice exposed to
6 months chronic CS revealed a higher concentration of 25-hydroxy-
cholesterol as assessed by liquid chromatography–high-resolution
mass spectrometry (Fig 1H).
To address the mechanism underlying the regional upregulation
of CH25H predominantly localized to the airways in COPD patients
and in particular that associated with emphysematous tissue, we
first undertook gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; Mootha et al,
2003; Subramanian et al, 2005) on the publically available tran-
scriptomics dataset of small airway epithelial cells from COPD
patients described above (Tilley et al, 2011). CH25H upregulation is
driven by TLR4 Myd88-independent signaling (Diczfalusy et al,
2009), and indeed, GSEA revealed a strong enrichment of both total
TLR- and TLR4-dependent signaling in small airway epithelial cells
taken from the lungs of COPD patients compared to smoking
controls (Fig EV1B). Supporting a recent observation that TLR4
expression is increased in the airways of COPD patients (Haw et al,
2017). Furthermore, staining of airway sections revealed a strong
increase in TLR4 expression localized to the airways of emphysema-
tous COPD patients rather than non-emphysematous or healthy

 control airways (Fig EV1C). Additionally, treating human bronchial
epithelial cell lines with the TLR4 agonist LPS induced expression of
CH25H similar to that observed with cigarette smoke (Fig EV1D and
E). Interestingly, the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a alone was
also able to induce enhanced CH25H expression in airway epithelial
cells, suggesting that the pro-inflammatory environment in addition

 to direct effects of CS exposure upon the airway epithelial cells is
capable of enhancing CH25H expression. These translational results
lead us to hypothesize that CS-activated CH25H signaling in the
airway epithelium may confer iBALT formation.
Diminished oxysterol pathways impaired iBALT formation and
attenuated cigarette smoke-induced COPD
To determine the role of CH25H in iBALT formation in vivo, we
exposed CH25H-deficient mice to CS for 4 and 6 months to induce
emphysema development (John-Schuster et al, 2014; Cloonan et al,
2016; Baarsma et al, 2017). Importantly, the lungs of these mice
showed no general metabolic differences, even after CS exposure,
compared to the wild-type animals (Fig EV2A). Wild-type mice
developed clear evidence of emphysema accompanied by iBALT
formation from 4 months onwards (Fig 2A–C), that specifically
associated with the airways further with vessels and septal tissue
(Fig 2D), whereas in Ch25h�/� mice formation of iBALT and the
hallmarks of emphysema failed to develop (Fig 2A–D). Flow cyto-
metric analysis of whole lung cells showed that both T and B cells
were activated after CS exposure similarly in both Ch25h�/� and
wild-type mice (Fig 2E), suggesting that CH25H is important for
cellular positioning within the iBALT and not recruitment and
activation of T and B cells to the lung. In support, cellular recruit-
ment into the BAL as well as mRNA expression of Cxcl13, Cxcl9,
Ccl19, Ccl21, Cxcl1, and Mcp1 was equivalently increased in both
wild-type and Ch25h�/� mice following CS exposure (Fig EV2B
and C).
We have previously shown that B cell-deficient mice do not
generate iBALT and that this prevented CS-induced emphysema by
impairing the activation of macrophages and MMP12 upregulation
(John-Schuster et al, 2014). To address the mechanisms underlying
the protection against emphysema in Ch25h�/� mice, flow cytomet-
ric analysis was undertaken on the lavaged lungs to address the
recruitment of macrophages into the lung tissue following CS expo-
sure. In contrast to the BAL, total F4/80+ macrophages and CD11c-
CD11b+ recruited macrophages were significantly reduced in the
lungs of Ch25h�/� mice compared to wild-type animals following
chronic CS exposure (Fig EV2D–F). In support, immunohistochemi-
cally stained galectin-3-positive macrophages (Fig EV2G), mRNA
expression of Adgre1 the gene for F4/80 (Fig EV2H), and the
Mmp12:Timp1 ratio (Fig EV2I) were significantly reduced in the
lungs of Ch25h�/� mice compared to wild type, following exposure
to CS. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis revealed reduced
Ly6g-positive
neutrophils
in
the
lungs
of
Ch25h�/�
mice
compared to wild-type animals following chronic CS exposure
(Fig EV2J–K).
To confirm the importance of local oxysterol production in
iBALT generation and COPD pathogenesis, we next exposed mice
lacking EBI2, the receptor for 7a,25-OHC, to chronic cigarette smoke
for 4 months. Similar to Ch25h�/� mice, these Ebi2�/� animals also
failed to generate iBALT or any features of emphysema (Fig 3A–C).
Leukocyte recruitment to the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid following
CS exposure was similar in both wild-type and Ebi2�/� mice
(Fig EV3A), with cytokine and chemokine expression profiles simi-
lar to that observed for Ch25h�/� and wild-type mice (Fig EV3B).
Flow cytometric analysis of whole lung cells revealed that both T
and B cells were recruited to the lungs of Ebi2�/� mice in similar
numbers to wild-type animals following CS exposure (Fig 3D and
E), but interestingly less B cells were activated in the Ebi2�/� mice
(Fig 3D), suggesting a further role for EBI2 beyond B-cell position-
ing (Benned-Jensen et al, 2011). To address this, splenic B cells
were isolated from Ebi2�/� and wild-type mice and activated ex vivo
by IgM cross-linking. Similar to the in vivo situation flow cytometric
analysis revealed reduced activation of Ebi2�/� B cells as demon-
strated by less upregulation of the surface activation marker CD69
(Fig EV3C), which was accompanied by reduced MHC II expression
(Fig EV3D). CD69 expression in B cells is regulated by Egr1
(Richards et al, 2001; Vazquez et al, 2009), a primary response gene
rapidly induced in B cells following BCR cross-linking (Seyfert et al,
1989; McMahon & Monroe, 1995). Interestingly, Ebi2�/� B cells 6 h
post-BCR cross-linking upregulated Egr1 less than wild-type B cells
(Fig EV3E), proposing that the impaired activation of Ebi2�/� B
cells may stem from an inability to fully induce expression of the
early response gene Egr1. Future work should determine further the
role of Ebi2 in Egr1 transcriptional regulation.
To exclude a role for 25-hydroxycholesterol in emphysema devel-
opment beyond iBALT formation, we examined B cell-deficient mice
(lMT) that are resistant to CS-induced iBALT formation and emphy-
sema (John-Schuster et al, 2014). Consistent with wild type, these
animals demonstrated increased expression of Ch25h and Cyp7b1
(Fig EV4A and B) in their lungs with CH25H expression localizing
to the airway epithelial cells (Fig EV4C) following acute and chronic
CS exposure. Collectively, these data demonstrated that oxysterol-
induced signaling pathways guide iBALT generation during CS-
induced COPD.

 CH25H deficiency does not protect against
iBALT-independent emphysema
Previous data demonstrate that professional APCs can express
CH25H under inflammatory conditions (Park & Scott, 2010; Liu
et al, 2013). These findings led us to interrogate whether differential
cytokine secretion by resident alveolar or bone marrow-recruited
macrophages (BMDM) deficient in CH25H were involved in emphy-
sema development. Isolated alveolar macrophages significantly
increased expression of Ch25h under both polarizing conditions
(Fig EV5A),
while
BMDM
from
wild-type
mice
significantly
increased expression of Ch25h only under M1-polarizing conditions
(Fig EV5B). Importantly, both alveolar and bone marrow macro-
phages from wild-type and Ch25h�/� mice induced strong expres-
sion of Tnfa and Il1b under M1-polarizing conditions as well as Irf4
and Fizz1 as key transcription factors regulating M2 polarization
(Satoh et al, 2010) after culturing with IL-4 (Fig EV5A and B). To
extend these findings, we cultured bone marrow-derived DCs
isolated from wild-type and Ch25h�/� mice with LPS and found
similarly increased expression of Il12a, Tnfa, and Nos2 from both
mice (Fig EV5C). In combination, this suggests that impaired cyto-
kine secretion by professional APCs is not a contributing factor in
CH25H-deficient mice. Furthermore, recent evidence revealed that
depletion of alveolar macrophages ameliorated elastase-induced

 emphysema (Ueno et al, 2015), an iBALT-independent emphysema
mouse model (Dau et al, 2015; Sarker et al, 2015). Therefore, we
utilized this model to demonstrate that loss of CH25H in macro-
phages did not impact upon emphysema development. Both wild-
type and Ch25h�/� mice developed a severe emphysema following
elastase treatment, with no evidence of iBALT formation in either
mice (Fig EV5D–H). These data further demonstrate that CH25H-
deficient macrophages are not protective against elastase-induced
emphysema, implying the role of CH25H in iBALT-mediated COPD
pathogenesis.
Oxysterols guide B-cell migration to the airways
7a,25-OHC guides B-cell positioning in secondary lymphoid tissue
(Yi et al, 2012). To address the role of airway-specific CH25H in
guiding B cells, we used microdissected airway trees (Yildirim et al,
2008) stimulated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) ex vivo, which
demonstrated increased expression of Ch25h and Cyp7b1 in airways
from wild-type mice, whereas Ch25h�/� mice did not express Ch25h
and failed to increase the expression of Cyp7b1 (Fig 4A). Isolated
airways from both mice showed no differences in Cxcl13 expression
(Fig 4A). To further corroborate these findings, we utilized a novel
ex vivo assay in which IgM cross-linked activated splenic B cells
were tested for their ability to migrate toward the CSE-stimulated
airway trees (Fig 4B). mRNA analysis of IgM cross-linked B cells
revealed no change in the expression levels of the 7a,25-OHC recep-
tor Ebi2 (Hannedouche et al, 2011; Liu et al, 2011) and the CXCL13
receptor Cxcr5 (Gunn et al, 1998; Legler et al, 1998; Fig 4C). Consis-
tent with increased Ch25h and Cyp7b1, we observed a strong
increase in the number of activated B cells migrating toward wild-
type CSE-activated airways (Fig 4D).
To demonstrate that increased expression of CH25H- and
CYP7B1-mediated oxysterol 7a,25-OHC guided B-cell migration, we
cultured dissected wild-type airways in the presence of clotrimazole,
a CYP7B1 inhibitor (Liu et al, 2011; Fig 4E). As expected, this treat-
ment did not affect Ch25h levels, but was sufficient to reduce
Cyp7b1 mRNA expression (Fig 4F) and significantly impaired the
ability of activated B cells to migrate toward CSE-treated airways
(Fig 4G). These data suggested that 7a,25-OHC is guiding B-cell
movement toward the airways. These results strongly indicate that
the CS-induced airway epithelial oxysterols are capable of driving B-
cell migration, which contribute to iBALT generation on the airways
in experimental COPD.
Oxysterol inhibitor as a novel therapeutic target for COPD
As there are currently no clinical regimes to reverse the progression of
emphysema (Vogelmeier et al, 2017), we evaluated whether inhibit-
ing the generation of 7a,25-OHC could alleviate established experi-
mental COPD when clotrimazole was administrated as a therapeutic
dosing strategy (Fig 5A). Wild-type mice with pulmonary inflamma-
tion following two months chronic CS exposure (comparable with
human COPD GOLD stages 0–1) were treated with clotrimazole
during months two to four, leading to significantly reduced iBALT
formation (Fig 5B and D) and lack of emphysema development
(Fig 5C). At the cellular level, we observed reduced macrophage and
lymphocyte cell numbers in BAL fluid of these clotrimazole-treated
CS-exposed mice (Fig 5E). Importantly, wild-type mice exposed to CS
for 4 months (comparable with human COPD GOLD stages 1–2),
presenting clear signs of iBALT formation and COPD (Fig 2A–D and
5B–D), then treated with clotrimazole, showed attenuated iBALT and
emphysema (Fig 5F–H). There was also reduced macrophage cell
numbers in the BAL fluid of late clotrimazole-treated CS-exposed mice
(Fig 5I). Taken together, these data suggest that inhibiting the genera-
tion of 7a,25-OHC with clotrimazole not only prevents iBALT forma-
tion, but is able to disrupt established iBALT and attenuate
experimental CS-induced COPD.
Discussion
This study reveals a role for oxysterol metabolism in guiding iBALT
generation to the airways during COPD pathogenesis. Mice deficient
in CH25H, an enzyme crucial for the metabolism of cholesterol
toward the oxysterol 7a,25-OHC, or EBI2, the main receptor of
7a,25-OHC, did not generate iBALT in their lungs following expo-
sure to chronic CS and were protected against the development of
COPD. We also demonstrated that COPD patients and CS-exposed
mice significantly upregulated CH25H and CYP7B1 expression in
airway epithelial cells, and this was sufficient to promote B-cell

 Our data suggest that B cells are organized into iBALT structures
upon the bronchus because of local secretion of 7a,25-OHC by the
airway epithelial cells, akin to 7a,25-OHC generated by lymphoid stro-
mal cells guiding activated B-cell movement during humoral responses
(Yi et al, 2012). We do not exclude the possibility that T-cell migration
is also disrupted, especially since EBI2 is expressed by CD4 T cells and
activated T-cell positioning in the outer T zone of lymphoid follicles is
directed by 7a,25-OHC (Li et al, 2016). However, we recently demon-
strated that B cell-deficient mice were protected from CS-induced
COPD despite normal function of CD4 T cells (John-Schuster et al,
2014). Notably, lymphocytes are recruited to the lung equivalently in
wild-type mice and in mice where the oxysterol axis had been
disturbed (Ch25h�/� and Ebi2�/� mice). Levels of Cxcl13, Cxcl9,
Ccl19, and Ccl21 were increased in these mice following CS exposure
equivalent to their wild-type counterparts, supporting our hypothesis.
The pro-inflammatory oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC)
has also been demonstrated in the airways of COPD patients (Kikuchi
et al, 2012) and recently described to be involved in splenic DC posi-
tioning and homeostasis (Lu et al, 2017). 27-OHC is synthesized by
CYP7B1-driven metabolism of 27-hydroxycholesterol (Lu et al, 2017),
and its synthesis will therefore be blocked by clotrimazole treatment.
27-OHC is, however, a poor chemokine for B cells (Liu et al, 2011),
and as iBALT failed to form in Ch25h�/� mice following chronic CS
exposure, this would suggest that 7a,25-OHC is the major EBI2 ligand
for iBALT generation. It has also been reported that 27-OHC is able to
accelerate senescence of both fibroblasts and airway epithelial cells
(Hashimoto et al, 2016) and that 25-hydroxycholesterol may promote
fibroblast-mediated tissue remodeling through NF-jB signaling (Ichi-
kawa et al, 2013), suggesting that impairing oxysterol metabolism
may have additional direct effects on lung tissue regeneration.
However, we show here that Ch25h�/� mice are not protected against
iBALT-independent emphysema development and that B cell-deficient
mice upregulate oxysterol synthesizing enzymes after chronic CS
exposure similar to their wild-type counterparts, yet are still protected
against COPD development (John-Schuster et al, 2014).
Inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue size and number
correlates with the severity of COPD in patients (Hogg et al, 2004;
Polverino et al, 2015), suggesting a therapeutic opportunity, especially
considering current therapeutic regimes against COPD do not reverse
the progression of emphysema (Tanaka et al, 2013; Vogelmeier et al,
2017). We clearly show that mice treated with the CYP7B1 inhibitor
clotrimazole, resolved iBALT formation, and attenuated CS-induced
emphysema in vivo. Based on our findings, we speculate that disrup-
tion of iBALT generation through the targeting of oxysterols, rather
than complete B-cell depletion, particularly as a recent rituximab trial
in COPD patients failed because of increased risk of infectious compli-
cations (Brusselle et al, 2009), opens new therapeutic strategies on a
broader
perspective for
other
diseases
associated with tertiary
lymphoid organs beyond COPD, such as pulmonary hypertension,
cancer, transplant rejection, and autoimmunity (Pitzalis et al, 2014).
Materials and Methods
Transcriptomic data analysis
Microarray data were obtained from data series held at the NCBI
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (Barrett et al, 2013).
Mouse whole lung data of filtered air versus chronic CS-exposed
animals were obtained from accession GSE52509 (John-Schuster
et al, 2014), and human data comparing gene expression in the
small airway epithelial cells of COPD patients with healthy non-
smoking controls from accession GSE11784 (Tilley et al, 2011). Data
were analyzed using the GEO web tool GEO2R (Barrett et al, 2013)
with default settings, whose back end uses Bioconductor (Gentle-
man et al, 2004) R packages to transform and analyze the data, to
generate the log2 transformed expression values for each gene rela-
tive to filtered air or healthy controls. Gene Ontology pathway anal-
ysis was undertaken on GEO2R gene expression data with a
P < 0.05 using the web-based gene set analysis toolkit WebGestalt
(Wang et al, 2013). A heat map of selected genes (log2 transformed
expression values, with a P < 0.05, as calculated by GEO2R) taken
from the Gene Ontology pathway analysis was generated by Genesis
software (Sturn et al, 2002; Release 1.7.7, Institute for Genomics
and Bioinformatics, Graz University of Technology).
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software from the Broad
Institute
(http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp;
Mootha
et al, 2003; Subramanian et al, 2005) was used to determine the
enrichment of Reactome gene lists obtained from the GSEA-Mole-
cular Signatures Database for total TLR- and TLR4-specific signaling.
Data from the series matrix file comparing gene expression in the
small airway epithelial cells of COPD patients with healthy smoking
controls (accession GSE11784) were downloaded from the NCBI
GEO database.
Human lung tissue
Lung core samples of emphysematous and healthy regions from the
same explanted lungs of COPD patients undergoing lung transplan-
tation were provided by Dr. Stijn Verleden (University of Leuven,
Belgium) following ethical approval of the University of Leuven
Institutional Review Board (ML6385). All participants provided writ-
ten consent and experiments conformed to the principles set out in
the Declaration of Helsinki. Patient demographics are highlighted in
Table 1. Immediately following transplant, lungs were air-inflated at
Table 1.

 10 cm H2O pressure and fixed using constant pressure in the fumes
of liquid nitrogen. Afterward lungs were sliced using a band saw
and sampled using a core bore. Upon receipt, lung cores were
portioned for fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by paraffin
embedding and total RNA isolation (peqGOLD Total RNA Kit,
Peqlab).
Primary bronchial epithelial cell culture
Primary bronchial epithelial cell cultures were obtained from
smokers with and without COPD, who had lobectomy or pneu-
monectomy for lung cancer or other reasons at Gaziantep Univer-
sity Hospital (Turkey), using an explant cell culture technique
(Devalia et al, 1990; Bayram et al, 1998). The demographic charac-
teristics of patients are given in Table 2. The study was approved
by The Ethics Committee of Gaziantep University, informed writ-
ten consents were taken from study volunteers, and experiments
conformed to the principles set out in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Total cellular RNA was isolated using commercially available kits
(QIAcube, Qiagen).
RNAseq analysis
Total RNA of human lung derived from COPD explants or healthy
donor controls was sequenced using the Illumina system (HiSeq
2000) by the company GATC Biotech.AG (Konstanz, Germany).
Raw data analysis was performed by Genomatix Software GmbH.
Expression values were calculated as RPKM (Reads per kilobase
million per mapped reads) for all loci available from reads uniquely
aligned to the human genome. In this study, we only present the
expression of CH25H.
Mice
B6.129S6-Ch25htm1Rus/J (Ch25h�/�) mice were obtained from The
Jackson Laboratory and B6N(Cg)-Gpr183tm1.1(KOMP)Vlcg/J (Ebi2�/�)
from the KOMP Repository, University of California Davis. Age-
matched female C57BL/6J mice and B cell-deficient B6.129S2-Igh-
6tm1Cgn (lMT) mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories.
Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at a
constant temperature and humidity with a 12-hour light cycle and
allowed food and water ad libitum. All animal experiments were
performed according to strict governmental and international guide-
lines and were approved by the local government for the administra-
tive region of Upper Bavaria, Germany.
Mouse COPD models and treatment
Eight- to 12-week-old female mice were used in all experiments.
For the CS-induced COPD model, mice were exposed to 100%
mainstream CS (John et al, 2014) at a particle concentration of
500 mg/m3, generated from 3R4F research cigarettes (Filter
removed, Tobacco Research Institute, University of Kentucky),
for 50 min twice/day, 5 days/week for 4 or 6 months. Mice
exposed to filtered air were used as controls. For the elastase-
induced iBALT-independent COPD model, mice were instilled
oropharyngeally with a single application of 80 U/kg body weight
porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE; Sigma-Aldrich) in 80 ll PBS.
Mice treated with 80 ll PBS were included as controls. For
CYP7B1 inhibition, clotrimazole (Sigma-Aldrich) 10 mM in DMSO
was further diluted in corn oil (Mazola, Unilever) and applied
i.p. at a dose of 80 mg/kg body weight 3 times/week for
2 months. Mice were treated after 2 or 4 months of CS exposure
and smoked for a further 2 months in parallel with the clotrima-
zole treatment.
Lung function analysis
Mice were anaesthetized with ketamine–xylazine, tracheostomized,
cannulated, and the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DFCO)
calculated (Fallica et al, 2011). Briefly, 0.8 ml mixed gas (0.5% Ne,
21% O2, 0.5% CO and 78% N2) was instilled into the mice lungs
and withdrawn 2 s later for analysis on a 3000 Micro GC Gas
Analyzer (Infinicon). DFCO was calculated as 1-(CO1/CO0)/(Ne1/
Ne0) where 0 and 1 refer to the gas concentration before and after
instillation, respectively. Respiratory function was analyzed using a
forced pulmonary maneuver system (Vanoirbeek et al, 2010; Buxco
Research Company, Data Sciences International) running FinePointe
Software (version 6, Data Sciences International) and the quasistatic
PV maneuver protocol.
Bronchoalveolar lavage
After lung function analysis, lungs were lavaged with 3 × 500 ll
aliquots of sterile PBS (Gibco, Life Technologies) supplemented with
Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablets (Roche Diagnostics).
Cells were pelleted at 400 g for 20 min and resuspended in 500 ll
RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Life Technologies) for the total cell
count using a Neubauer Chamber. Cytospins of the cell suspension
were then prepared and stained using May-Gru
¨nwald-Giemsa for
differential cell counting (200 cells/sample) using morphological
criteria. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was retained for mass spec-
trometry analysis.
Mouse lung processing
The two right lower lung lobes were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen,
homogenized and total RNA isolated (peqGOLD Total RNA Kit,
Peqlab). The right upper two lobes were dissociated into single-cell
suspensions in PBS supplemented with 0.1% FCS and 2 mM EDTA

Immunohistochemical staining
3-lm sections from human core samples or mouse lung were
deparaffinized, rehydrated, and then treated with 1.8% (v/v)
H2O2 solution (Sigma-Aldrich) to block endogenous peroxidase.
Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed in HIER citrate
buffer (pH 6.0, Zytomed Systems) in a decloaking chamber (Bio-
care Medical). To inhibit non-specific binding of antibodies,
sections were treated with a blocking antibody (Biocare Medical).
Human sections were incubated at 4°C overnight with a rabbit
anti-TLR4 primary antibody (1:50, Cat. No. ab13556, Abcam),
followed by 1 h with an anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody (Biocare Medical). Signals were amplified by adding
chromogen substrate 3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Biocare Medi-
cal). Mouse sections were incubated at 4°C overnight with a rabbit
anti-galectin-3 primary antibody (1:100, Cat. No. sc-20157, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), followed by 1 h with a Rabbit-on-Rodent
AP-Polymer (Biocare Medical). Signals were amplified by adding
chromogen substrate Vulcan fast red (Biocare Medical). All
sections were counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich),
dehydrated, and mounted.

pharm) as described (John-Schuster et al, 2014), by readers
blinded to the study groups. Briefly, for mean chord length (MCL)
measurements, 20 frames were selected randomly across multiple
sections by the software, using the ×20 objective, and superim-
posed by a line grid and points. The intercepts of lines on alveolar
wall (Isepta) and points localized on air space (Pair) were counted
and calculated as MCL = ∑Pair × L(p)/∑Isepta × 0.5, where L(p) is
the line length per point. The volume of inflammation (V) was
quantified in 50 frames, using the ×40 objective, by counting
points hitting inflammatory cell zones (Pinflam). For calculation,
the Pinflam were referenced to intercepts of lines with both airways
and
vessels
(Iairway/vessel):
V = ∑Pinflam × L(p)/∑Iairway/vessel.
Further, airway-, vessel-, or septum-associated inflammation quan-
tification was classified by the location of the inflammation and
was calculated referring to intercept of lines with airway, vessel,
or both, respectively.
Flow cytometry
106 cells from filtered single-cell lung suspensions were blocked
with purified anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Clone: 93, eBioscience)
before incubating for 30 min on ice with antibody cocktails. After
washing and re-suspending in MACS buffer, cells were analyzed on
a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and BD FACS-
Diva software. B-cell and T-cell staining was performed with:
APC-conjugated anti-CD19 (clone: 6D5, Miltenyi Biotec), APC-
Vio770-conjugated
anti-CD3e
(clone:
17A2,

Microdissection of airways
Middle and distal airways from C57BL/6J and Ch25h�/� mice were
isolated and incubated ex vivo as described (Yildirim et al, 2008).
Briefly, after sacrifice by a ketamine–xylazine over dose, the trachea
was cannulated, the lungs removed from the thorax and infused
with 1% low-melting agarose dissolved in 1:1 Ham‘s F12 nutrient
medium (Sigma-Aldrich) and distilled water (Gibco, Life Technolo-
gies). Airways were dissected under a microscope (Zeiss) from the
left lung after the agarose had solidified on ice for 30 min. The
isolated airways were washed and cultured in airway epithelial cell
medium (PromoCell) at 37°C, 5% CO2.
B-cell isolation and migration assay
B cells were purified from the spleens of C57BL/6J mice by negative
selection (B cell Isolation Kit, mouse, Miltenyi Biotec). For the
migration assay, primary mouse airways were isolated 1 day prior
and treated with 10% CSE in airway epithelial cell culture medium
(PromoCell) or culture medium alone for 24 h. To inhibit CYP7B1,
clotrimazole
in
DMSO
was
diluted
with
culture
medium
or
combined with 10% CSE to a final concentration of 1 lM. The
supernatants were transferred as conditioned medium to the lower
well
of
24-well
transwell
plates
(Permeable
Polycarbonate
Membrane Inserts, Corning, Fisher Scientific), for inducing B-cell
migration, while the airway samples were snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen for RNA isolation. Freshly isolated B cells at 2.5 × 106/ml
in 100 ll were activated by unconjugated AffiniPure F(ab’)₂ Frag-
ment Goat anti-mouse IgM, lchain-specific antibody (1.3 lg/ml,
115-006-020, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) for 1 h at 37°C
in 5.0 lm pore-sized transwell inserts (Permeable Polycarbonate
Membrane Inserts, Corning, Fisher Scientific). Transwell inserts
were then placed into the wells of conditioned medium and

 incubated for 3 h at 37°C. Migrated B cells were collected and
counted by Neubauer Chamber and reported as percentage of input.
Cigarette smoke extract preparation
Cigarette smoke extract was generated by bubbling smoke from
three research cigarettes (3R4F, Tobacco Research Institute, Univer-
sity of Kentucky) through 30 ml of airway epithelial cell culture
medium (PromoCell) at a puffing speed equating to one cigarette
every 5 min, in a closed environment with limited air flow. This
solution was taken as 100% CSE.
Isolation and stimulation of professional APCs
Primary alveolar macrophages were isolated from the lungs of
C57BL/6J and Ch25h�/� mice by BAL with 10 washes of 1 ml PBS
(Gibco, Life Technologies). Cells were pelleted at 400 g for 20 min
and resuspended in complete RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 lM b-mercaptoethanol, and
100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (all from Gibco, Life Tech-
nologies). 5 × 104 cells in 1 ml were seeded in 24-well plates and
allowed to adhere for 1 h. Non-adherent cells were removed by
washing twice with PBS. To generate bone marrow-derived macro-
phages (BMDM) and DCs (BMDC), bone marrow was flushed from
femurs and tibias of C57BL/6J and Ch25h�/� mice with RPMI-1640
medium. Cells were disaggregated by passing through a 40-lm mesh
and cultured in complete RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
5% fetal bovine serum, 50 lM b-mercaptoethanol, and 100 U/ml
penicillin and streptomycin at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in
24-well plates. For BMDMs, the medium was supplemented with
20 ng/ml murine recombinant M-CSF (ImmunoTools), and for
BMDCs, the medium was supplemented with 20 ng/ml murine
recombinant GM-CSF (ImmunoTools) and cultured at 37°C, 5%
CO2. Cells were maintained by replacing the medium with fresh
medium on alternate days ensuring removal of non-adherent cells.
On day 6, adherent BMDMs were collected. For BMDCs, on day 7–8
adherent cells were harvested and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml
in 10 ml complete RPMI-1640 medium in 100-mm petri dishes and
cultured for a further 24–48 h. The non-adherent, non-proliferating,
maturing DCs were collected as they were released. Primary alveo-
lar macrophages and BMDMs were polarized toward M1 by cultur-
ing with complete RPMI-1640 medium containing 1 lg/ml LPS
(from Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 ng/ml recom-
binant murine IFNc (ImmunoTools) for 24 h or an M2 phenotype
with 20 ng/ml recombinant murine IL-4 (ImmunoTools) for 24 h.
BMDCs were stimulated with 1 lg/ml LPS for 24 h.
Bronchial epithelial cell lines
The human bronchial epithelial cell lines BEAS-2B (ATCC CRL-
9609) and 16-HBE (Cozens et al, 1994) were maintained in airway
epithelial cell medium (PromoCell) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (all from
Gibco, Life Technologies) at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells were seeded and
grown to confluence over 48 h in 24-well plates before stimulation
with LPS (from E. coli 0111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich), CSE or recombinant
human TNF-a (PeproTech), at the concentrations described in the
figure legends.
Analysis of 25-hydroxycholesterol
Determination of 25-hydroxycholesterol in cell culture supernatant
and BALF was performed based on mass spectrometric methods
previously described for different instrumentation (Honda et al,
2009; Huang et al, 2014). 25-hydroxycholesterol was derivatized,
and the product was analyzed using ultra-high pressure liquid chro-
matography (UHPLC) coupled with high-resolution time-of-flight
mass
spectrometry
(LC-HRTOF-MS).
UHPLC
separation
was
performed on a 1290 Infinity Binary LC-System using an Eclipse
C-18, 1.8 lm, 50 × 2.1 mm I.D. analytical column (both from
Agilent Technologies). Mass spectrometric detection was accom-
plished on a Citius
TM High Resolution multi-reflection time-of-flight
mass spectrometer (LC-HRT, Leco).
Metabolomics analysis
The targeted metabolomics approach was based on LC-ESI-MS/MS
and FIA-ESI-MS/MS measurements by AbsoluteIDQ
TM p180 Kit
(BIOCRATES Life Sciences AG) which has been described in detail
(Zukunft et al, 2013). Frozen lung tissue was homogenized and
extracted as described previously (Conlon et al, 2016; Zukunft et al,
2018). Mass spectrometric analyses were done on an API 4000 triple
quadrupole system (Sciex Deutschland GmbH) equipped with a
1200 Series HPLC (Agilent Technologies) and a HTC PAL auto
sampler (CTC Analytics) controlled by the software Analyst 1.5.1.
Data evaluation for quantification of metabolite concentrations and
quality assessment was performed with the MetIDQ
TM software
The paper explained
Problem
Long-term environmental exposure to toxic gases and particles, in
particular
cigarette
smoke,
can
result
in
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), currently the third leading cause of death
worldwide. It manifests as chronic bronchitis, small airway remodel-
ing, and emphysema, resulting in progressive and largely irreversible
airflow limitation and impaired gaseous exchange. Currently, the only
available therapies aim at symptom management and do not reverse
disease progression. There is strong evidence that advanced stages of
COPD are driven by the generation of inducible bronchus-associated
lymphoid tissue (iBALT). Yet, we do not know how iBALT gets orga-
nized upon the bronchi and if its disruption can reverse COPD
progression.
Results
We have demonstrated that oxysterols, metabolites of cholesterol, are
critically involved in iBALT generation and the immune pathogenesis
of COPD. In both, COPD patients and mouse models of the disease,
we identified upregulated oxysterol enzymes in airway epithelial cells.
Furthermore, mice genetically or pharmacologically deficient in the
oxysterol pathway were protected from cigarette smoke-induced
emphysema and iBALT formation.
Impact
This study provides valuable new insights into the mechanism of
iBALT-driven COPD pathogenesis and highlights the oxysterol pathway
as a potential therapeutic approach for COPD disease progression,
and conceivably, the many other chronic diseases associated with
tertiary lymphoid organ development.
