The accidental untying of a shoelace while walking
often occurs without warning. In this paper, we
discuss the series of events that lead to a shoelace knot
becoming untied. First, the repeated impact of the
shoe on the floor during walking serves to loosen the
knot. Then, the whipping motions of the free ends of
the laces caused by the leg swing produce slipping of
the laces. This leads to eventual runaway untangling
of the knot. As demonstrated using slow-motion
video footage and a series of experiments, the failure
of the knot happens in a matter of seconds, often
without warning, and is catastrophic. The controlled
experiments showed that increasing inertial effects of
the swinging laces leads to increased rate of knot
untying, that the directions of the impact and swing
influence the rate of failure, and that the knot structure
has a profound influence on a knot’s tendency to untie
under cyclic impact loading.
1. Introduction and motivation
While most people have experienced accidental untying
of their shoelaces, little is known and even less is
documented about the physical mechanisms responsible
for this ubiquitous annoyance. A popular 2005 TED
Talk by Terry Moore on strategies for tying shoelaces
to minimize knot failure, while helpful in suggesting
a knot-tying heuristic, does not explain the source of
the failure. Fortunately, some hints towards the nature
of the shoelace failure mechanism can be understood
anecdotally. We observed that a shoelace knot that often
failed very quickly when walking (typically within 50
feet) did not fail when the leg was simply swung back
and forth a similar number of cycles, that is, with
no impact while sitting on a table. However, simply

is approximately 1 s.
stomping the foot on the ground the same number of cycles also did not lead to untying. These
observations suggest that the knot failure involves an interplay between the swing and stance
phases (cf. figure 1) of the walking motion. Stated differently, failure does not occur without both
the impact and swinging experienced during walking or running.
With the goal of observing shoelace knot failure, we examined slow-motion video footage
of a runner on a treadmill (see electronic supplementary material, video S1) whose shoes were
tied with what we call the weak knot (which is based on what is commonly termed the false,
granny or granary knot). The resulting images of the knot failure were striking (figure 1). In
particular, there appeared to be two time scales upon which untying took place: little change
to the knot was observed for many strides until some untying began, after which the speed of
untying was remarkable (often in less than two running strides).1 These observations informed
both our hypothesized failure mechanism and experimental design.
We refer the reader to figure 1 for illustrations of the phases of a walking gate and appendix A
(figure 14a–g) for a comparison of the structures of weak knots and strong knots. Our hypotheses
for the failure of the knot are detailed in §3. We believe the failure is due to a combination of
knot deformation associated with the impact of the shoe during the heel striking phase of the
walking gait and the flapping motion of the shoelaces during the swinging phase of the walking
gait. The deformation of the knot and the relative motion of the shoelace strands are moderated
by the friction between the strands of shoelace in the knot centre to create the slow-fast (or
‘gradually-suddenly’) time scales. To formulate the hypothesis, we discuss scientific work on

knots in §2. After the hypothesis has been presented, we then turn to an experimental validation
of the proposed failure mechanism. The experiments are outlined in §4 and feature a custom-
made impact test facility. Our work also presents some challenges to the computational mechanics
community which we hope will inspire future work.
2. Background
In this paper, we deal primarily with two versions of the common shoelace bow-tie knot. The
primary difference between the versions of this knot has to do with their component parts:
a first trefoil, or lace crossing, tied close to the lacing and a second trefoil tied after the first
(cf. figure 2 for an illustration of these trefoils). The strong version of this knot is based on the
square knot: two trefoil knots of opposite handedness are stacked with the free ends tucked into
the knot centre, thereby creating loops (cf. figure 14h,i in appendix A) for an illustration of the
relationship between the two). The weak version of the knot, as mentioned previously, is based on
what is commonly known as the granny or false knot. In contrast with the strong version, the two
trefoils have the same handedness, causing the knot to twist instead of laying flat when tightened.
These differences are illustrated in appendix A (figure 14a–g) and we encourage the reader to
experiment with their own shoelaces. While the inferior performance of the weak version is well
known in both common knot lore and surgical knot literature [1–4], we have yet to find a proposed
structural characteristic to explain the inferior behaviour. Likewise, we have not found a study
explaining the failure mechanism for a shoelace knot.
Scientific work on knots can be roughly divided into three major categories: mathematical
study of knot topology, rod-based models for physical knots, and experimental investigations of
surgical suture knots. The first category pertains to mathematical knot theory where invariants
for knots are sought and studied (see [5,6] and references therein). The studies in this field allow
one to classify and distinguish types of knots and determine invariants of a particular knot
topology (such as trefoil (or simple) knots, cinquefoil (or double) knots, and figure eight knots)
that cannot be changed without cutting the strands of the knot. In the second category, studies in
the mechanics of physical knots seek to use an elastic rod model to determine the deformation of
the strands of a knot [7,8]. Owing to the interest in simulating and animating strands of hair, ropes
and sutures in computer graphics, progress in this area has been rapid in the past decade (cf. [4,9]).
However, simulating the dynamics of the shoelace knot under conditions experienced during
walking remains a challenging goal. An appreciation for the technical challenges can be gained by
examining recent studies such as [8,10] on the mechanics of rods having tangled self-contacting
strands. Adding to the technical challenges, several temporal scales must be accommodated in
order to examine the failure of a shoelace knot: the short duration of the impact of the shoe with
the ground during the heel strike and the much longer duration of the motion of the free ends
of the lace. Further, several length scales must also be considered: the small zones dominated by
friction and deformation of the shoelaces and the much larger segments of flapping lace.
The challenges of numerically modelling shoelaces led us to focus our efforts on an
experimental examination of knot failure, and it is our hope that such experiments will
inform future modelling work. Our work was aided by the large literature on experimental
characterizations of knot strength and failure in surgical sutures. Unlike knot topology, which
deals with arbitrarily self-tangled curves, the suture knots that are examined are typically simple
combinations of different trefoils [11,12] that are similar to shoelace knots. Testing conducted
in these studies features quasi-static and cyclic tests with no inertial effects [1,13–15]. Such
tests typically lead to physical breaking rather than untying of the knot. Even if untying is
accounted for, it is often secondarily commented on, and the concentration on breaking failures
means that significant non-elastic effects have been experienced by the strands up until failure
[13,16]. Significant plastic deformation is not a part of the average shoelace knot’s untying,
limiting the applicability of these studies to the problem at hand. However, the procedures and
protocols gleaned from the literature on surgical sutures were invaluable to us when designing
our experiment.

3. Hypothesized knot failure mechanism
We developed a hypothesis for knot failure based on the aforementioned high-speed observations
and additional normal-speed observations of knots in both normal operation (i.e. on a shoe,
walking or running) and artificial operation (i.e. swinging a shoe at the edge of a table in order to
isolate inertial effects, or stamping of a foot in place to isolate impulsive effects). Our hypothesis
was further refined by data from the testing of knots mounted on the device described in §4.
The hypothesized mechanism is as follows:
(i) as the leg is swung forward, and then slightly backwards to impact the ground, the loops
and free ends of the shoelaces (figure 3b) are all pulled forward (with respect to the knot
centre) by their inertia. The relative motion causes an opening of the knot—that is, a
widening of the centre space separating the two trefoils. The centre space is where the free
ends were pulled back through the knot to create the loops (cf. figure 14h,i in appendix
A);
(ii) the impact force of the shoe during the striking of the heel is transmitted to the knot by
the tongue of the shoe and the eyelets. As a result, the centre of the knot deforms;
(iii) the opening of the knot, and the concomitant reduction in friction forces, facilitates
relative motion of the free ends with respect to the knot centre. In other words, with the
centre of the knot pulled apart, relative axial motion between the free end and the knot
centre becomes possible, and it is easier for the free end to slide out of the knot centre.
The tension force pulling a free end through the centre is due to the imbalance of the
inertia of the free end (the same inertia that helps to pull the knot apart), the inertia of the
corresponding loop (to which the free end attaches through the knot), and the frictional
forces at the centre of the knot;
(iv) the repeated impacts perturb the knot such that the free end is incrementally pulled
through the knot. This happens slowly at first. But as the knot is repeatedly pulled apart
and more length is fed through the knot centre to the free end, the inertial forces pulling
the free end through the knot are increasingly magnified, while the competing inertia
forces of the loop diminish as the loop size decreases (figure 3c); and
(v) eventually, the free end is sufficiently long that in one or two strides (impact cycles), the
inertial force associated with the free end completely overpowers the loop’s inertial force,

Figure 3. Static representation of hypothesized stages of knot failure. (a) Terminology for various parts of the knot. (b) As
the leg is swung backwards to impact the ground, the inertia of the free ends and loops pull open the centre of the knot. If
the free end and loops are approximately the same length, these forces will be comparable. If the knot centre is tightened,
frictional forces will somewhat ameliorate the inertial force imbalance. (c) Repeated impact causes the centre of the knot to
incrementallyloosenwhichreducesfrictionaleffectsandmagnifiestheeffectsoftheinertialimbalancebetweenthefreeends

the free end, enabling further free-end pull through. (d) Eventually, the inertial effect of the free end is sufficiently large that

in complete failure of the second trefoil. (Online version is colour.)
causing run-away knot failure as the free end pulls completely through the knot centre.
This last event signifies total failure of the second trefoil (figure 3d).
It should be noted that this hypothesized mechanism explains the characteristic speed at which
catastrophic knot failure occurs. We have framed the hypothesis assuming that the inertia of the
free end dominates that of the loop (an assumption that matched the vast majority of observed
failures). The corresponding hypothesis when the opposite situation arises is readily formulated.
In this case, the loop gets larger at the expense of the free end and the failure mechanism is
similar to the case discussed in detail above. However, we believe this is rarely observed because
the loops are necessarily constrained in the orientations they can take, and do not undergo the
same range of motion/acceleration as the free ends (which quite literally ‘whip’ back and forth).
We suspect, but have not been able to prove, that the difference between the weak knot and
the strong knot failure rates lies in the twist of the weak knot. The strong knot can be tightened,
yet remain planar. However, to tighten the weak knot, the structure must twist completely. For
the knot to fail, the deformation of the knot centre noted in (ii) should contribute to the opening
(rather than tightening) of the knot centre, but it has proven elusive to measure the deformation
of the knot centre under a heel strike.

4. Experiments
(a) Preliminary testing: insitu high speed failure observation and force measurement
To inform controlled laboratory experiments and to hone suspected failure hypotheses, initial
knot failure experiments were performed in situ on shoes during running and walking. The first
of these in situ experiments observed knot failure using a high-speed camera (Vision Research
Phantom Miro M110, 1280 × 800 pixels, 900 fps). A volunteer runner was instructed to tie her
shoes using the weak version of the standard shoe knot. The volunteer then ran on a treadmill
(cf. figure 1; electronic supplementary material, video S1) until acute knot failure was observed
(defined as failure of the second trefoil, more commonly understood as loop untying). The
observed failure occurred rapidly and without warning, with footage confirming that full failure
occurred within one to two strides of failure initiation. A single failure mode was observed where
a free shoelace end pulled through the knot, thus reducing it to a single trefoil. The same volunteer
was additionally instructed to tie her shoelaces using the strong version of the standard shoe
knot—with approximately the same initial tightening as the weak knot—and no acute failure
(that is, complete untying) was observed during the testing period.
To better understand the dynamic conditions surrounding failure, we measured the
accelerations acting on the knot during the motions of walking and running. A LORD Microstrain
10g wireless accelerometer was attached to multiple types of shoes directly underneath the centre
of the knot (a location which varied slightly depending on the shoe). Shoes included in the
initial study were typical running shoes, hiking boots, casual sneakers and barefoot shoes. With
a metronome to help her maintain a constant cadence, a volunteer was asked to both walk
and run on a straight, level surface, and the accelerometer’s time history was recorded. This
time history contained measurements resulting from inertial and impact sources.2 The impact
sources produced accelerations which were large and impulsive. For the walking tests, the impact
magnitude (or measured acceleration at the base of the knot trefoils) was typically on the order
of 6–8g. Furthermore, analyses of testing results showed surprisingly similar magnitudes of
acceleration regardless of shoe type (a schematic of the in situ mounting and time history is
presented in appendix B). As we wished to study untying that occurs even in the least extreme
cases (i.e. slow walking on a thick sole, as opposed to the extreme case of running on a thin sole), it
was resolved to focus further testing on impulses corresponding to this regime. This information
was used to calibrate the impact magnitude—chosen to be approximately 7g—for the controlled
testing described in the following section.
(b) Controlled testing: cyclic impact
We fabricated an experimental set-up to isolate the effects of impact magnitude, impact direction,
and free-end inertial force magnitude on knot failure. Illustrated in figure 4, an actuated
pendulum was constructed to generate a primarily unidirectional impact force acting on the
knot centre (see electronic supplementary material, video S2). The pendulum was dropped from
an adjustable height to control the impact magnitude, and the mounting orientation of the
knot determined the effective impulse direction. An example of the time history is shown in
figure 5. The impact surface was tuned to produce minimal off-axis excitation and provide an
impulse profile characterized by a single 7g peak similar to those observed in the accelerometer
data mentioned previously (cf. appendix B). The pendulum was tuned such that mean off-axis
accelerations were, at most, 10% of the mean peak on-axis acceleration values. In most cases, they
were less than 5%.
Except when otherwise noted, the strong knot was used for all tests. A rigorous knot tying
procedure and a template were developed to ensure uniformity of knots between tests. Templates
2The accelerations experienced by the centre of the knot are not necessarily the same as those experienced by the loops or
free ends. The loops and free ends will experience additional accelerations relative to the knot centre which we were unable
to measure directly.

were used to manage knot geometry (size of free ends and loops) and tightening of the knots.
For the latter, knot tightening was standardized by hanging weights from knot loops. Initially, the
knots were tied so that the loops and the free ends were of equal length (8.26 cm). The free-end
length was defined as the distance of the lace end relative to the knot centre and the loop length
was defined as the distance of the middle of the outstretched loop (i.e. half of its arc length/chord
length) relative to the knot centre (cf. appendix A (figure 14j)). All knots studied were tied with
identical store-bought black (unwaxed) dress laces with a cross-sectional diameter of 2 mm. An
attempt was made to characterize the bending stiffness of the laces, but values determined via
an optical and force-based method were on the order of the error of the method (10−6 Nm2).
The exceptionally small value of the bending stiffness led us to conclude that it is of negligible
importance relative to frictional terms.
All experiments measured the rate of knot failure. The length of the free end was measured
at the beginning of the experiment and either after knot failure, if the failure occurred within a
trial timeout of 15 min, or at the end of the trial. This was then divided by the total number of
impact cycles to calculate an average slip rate (average change in the length of the free end per
impact cycle).
In our preliminary testing, we observed that knot failures were almost exclusively ‘pull
through’ in nature, suggesting that the inertia of the free ends dominated that of the loops. To
isolate the effect of free-end inertial force asymmetry on knot failure, masses of various sizes
were added to the free ends to magnify their inertial effect. The values of these masses were
chosen heuristically so that during the transition from the lowest value to the highest value
a corresponding change from limited knot failure to frequent knot failure was observed. End
masses of 1 g, 2 g and 3 g represented 7.4, 14.8 and 22 times the initial mass of the free end and
3.7, 7.4 and 11.1 times the initial mass of the loop, respectively, were added to the free ends of the
shoelaces. The effect of different masses on the average slip rate was measured (figure 6).

The effect of impact direction on failure rate was investigated by mounting the knot on the
pendulum in different orientations. We concentrated on two orientations: a ‘rear impact’ where
the plane in which the two trefoils lie is normal to the impacting direction and a ‘side impact’
where that same plane is parallel to the impacting direction. We can conceptually move from a
‘rear impact’ to a ‘side impact’ by rotating the knot 90◦ about the axis of the gravitational force
(cf. figure 7). Additionally, the failure frequency of the strong knot was compared with the weak
knot. As the weak knot does not orient itself along the same axis as the strong knot, two mounting
orientations of the weak knot were tested (cf. figure 8).
5. Results and discussion
We found two regimes of knot failure: gradual loosening and acute failure. To characterize these
regimes, we define the average slip rate for each test as the average change in length of the free
end per impact cycle (calculated by dividing the net change of the length of the free end during
testing by the total number of impact cycles). Total or acute failure was defined as the complete

unravelling of the second trefoil. Figure 9a shows the average slip rate for the rear impact test,
with 0, 1, 2 and 3 g free-end weights. The labels ‘L’, ‘R’ and ‘Average’ correspond to the change in
length of the left free end, right free end and the average of the two, respectively.
Only tests conducted with 3 g weights experienced acute knot failure, which occurred for
approximately half of the 3 g tests (53% or 8/15 tests). It is clear that tests using 3 g free-
end weights entered a regime of force asymmetry between the loop and free end that caused
significantly more rapid failure. However, we observed that acute failure was runaway in nature:
the majority of the free-end length change (and thus failure) occurred within a relatively short
number of impacts for all tests and amounts of free-end weight. This behaviour is consistent with
observations from high-speed video and is evident when examining the isolated slip rates of the
3 g tests that did not fail (figure 9b). If instances of runaway failure are excluded, the increase
in average slip rate increases approximately linearly with free-end weight (i.e. loop/free end
inertial asymmetry), whereas comparing the average slip rate of all 3 g trials shows a more than
fourfold increase in slip rate that is heavily weighted by runaway failure tests. The rear impact
tests showed a significant bias towards the failure of the left lace which was probably due to the
initial knot structure.
Figure 10a shows the average free-end slip rate for the side impact test, with 0, 1 and
2 g free-end weights. Only tests conducted with 2 g weights experienced full knot failure. As
with the rear impact tests, side impact tests exhibited runaway failure. Therefore, figure 10b
compares the average slip rates for the different free-end weights, excluding the 2 g tests that
experienced full runaway failure. Unlike the rear impact tests, the side impact slip rates for non-
failed knots did not monotonically increase with increasing free-end weight (increasing inertial
force asymmetry). The reason for this behaviour is not fully understood and requires further
investigation. Interestingly, biasing of failure between the left-free end and right-free end was not
observed in the side impact tests as it was in the rear impact tests.
Figures 11 and 12 show comparisons of the average free-end slip rates of side- and rear-
impacted knots with differing free-end weights. In both the side and rear impacts, an inertial
mass threshold was observed where total failure begins to occur within the allotted test time of
15 min. While no significant difference was seen between the rear and side impact slip rates for
different weights, it should be noted that knots impacted from the side experienced total failure
at lower amounts of the free-end weights than the laces subjected to a rear impact (40% of side-
impacted knots failed with 2 g free-end weights, while no rear-impacted knots failed with 2 g

free-end weights). While this does suggest some dependence of the failure on direction of impact,
more experimentation is necessary to characterize this effect.
As expected, the weak knot failed much faster than the strong knot. It is commonly known in
surgical knot practice and general knot lore that the disparity of load-carrying capabilities of the
weak knot compared with the strong knot are significant. Figure 13 compares average free-end
slip rate for both the strong and the weak knot with added 3 g free-end weights, impacted from
the rear. The weak knot experienced a 100% failure rate in both mounting configurations and at
much higher slip rates than the strong knot. Differences in slip rate between the two weak knot
mounting orientations did not show significant differences.

6. Conclusion
High-speed video observation of in situ shoelace knot showed failure to be a sudden and
catastrophic phenomenon. Observations point to a failure driven by the complex interplay
between impact-induced deformation of the centre of the knot, dynamic swinging of the walking
motion, and the inertial forces of the laces and free ends of the knot. Preliminary experimental
results showed that runaway failure and loosening can be linked to a mismatch between the
inertial forces of the loop and the free ends that is decreasingly mediated by friction as the knot

centre is loosened under cyclic impact. The increasing mismatch leads to an increase in slip
rate and causes an accelerating failure. Our results also confirmed that the weak knot fails at
higher slip rates and frequency than the strong knot. Further testing is necessary to more fully
understand the effect of impact orientation on the weak knot versus the strong knot.
It was also shown that knot failure was runaway in nature, with the majority of the change in
length associated with complete knot failure occurring in just a few impact cycles. The direction of
the impact has an effect on failure rate, with side impacts on the strong knot entering a regime of
full failure at a lower threshold of inertial asymmetry (within the allotted testing time of 15 min)
than the rear-impacted knots. This is suspected to have implications for differences of failure rate
between shoe types observed anecdotally, as the location and orientation of the knot on the shoe
leads to a different direction of the resultant impact force.
Our work on the failure of the shoelace knot is far from exhaustive. For one, the influence
of the shoelace material and surface finish was not investigated. In addition, the metric used
to understand knot slip rate in our work (measurements of free-end length before and after set
testing time or failure) is insufficient to elucidate finer details of knot failure progression from
gradual loosening to a regime of fast failure. To do so, future tests should fail each knot, measuring
free-end lengths at set intervals during testing. Such measurements will better distinguish the
two regimes of knot failure we have identified (one regime where the inertial imbalance between
free ends and loops is relatively stable, the other where the imbalance rapidly leads to runaway
knot untying). We expect that such measurements and further testing will also lead to better
understanding of the mechanical factors that cause the inferiority of the weak knot compared
with the strong knot.
