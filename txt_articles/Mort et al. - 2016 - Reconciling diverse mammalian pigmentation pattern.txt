Bands of colour extending laterally from the dorsal to ventral trunk are a common feature of
mouse chimeras. These stripes were originally taken as evidence of the directed dorsoventral
migration of melanoblasts (the embryonic precursors of melanocytes) as they colonize the
developing skin. Depigmented ‘belly spots’ in mice with mutations in the receptor tyrosine
kinase Kit are thought to represent a failure of this colonization, either due to impaired
migration or proliferation. Tracing of single melanoblast clones, however, has revealed a
diffuse distribution with high levels of axial mixing—hard to reconcile with directed migration.
Here we construct an agent-based stochastic model calibrated by experimental measure-
ments to investigate the formation of diffuse clones, chimeric stripes and belly spots.
Our observations indicate that melanoblast colonization likely proceeds through a process of
undirected migration, proliferation and tissue expansion, and that reduced proliferation is the
cause of the belly spots in Kit mutants.

elanoblasts, the embryonic precursors of the pigment
producing melanocytes of skin and hair, colonize the
developing epidermis during development. Mice het-
erozygous for mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit
present with a depigmented ventral belly spot long thought to
represent
a
failure
of
either
melanoblast
proliferation
or
migration1. Melanoblasts are specified at embryonic day 9 (E9)
in the pre-migratory neural crest2 by downregulation of the
transcription factors Foxd3 and Sox2 and upregulation of the
master transcription factor Mitf3,4. At E10.5 melanoblasts
delaminate from the neural crest, upregulate the melanoblast-
specific genes Pmel and Dct5,6, and accumulate in a region known
as the migration staging area (MSA)1,7,8. Melanoblast survival in
the skin is dependent on signalling between Kit (expressed in
melanoblasts) and its ligand Kitl (expressed by dermal fibroblasts
and keratinocytes), however initial delamination does not require
Kit signalling1,9. At E10.5 melanoblasts begin to leave the MSA in
a Kitl- and endothelin 3 (Edn3)-dependent manner and embark
on a dorsolateral migratory pathway in the dermis between
the developing somites and the ectoderm1,7,8,10. At E12.5
melanoblasts
move
from
the
dermis
to
the
epidermis,
upregulate E-cadherin, lose their dependence on Edn3 and
continue to migrate and proliferate11–13. A dermal population
also persists whose size remains constant (and so proportionally
decreases in relation to the epidermal population)14. Epidermal
colonization
is
complete
by
around
E15.5,
after
which
melanoblasts downregulate E-cadherin and begin to localize to
the developing hair follicles11,15,16. Luciani et al.14 measured
melanoblast doubling times in the dermis and epidermis,
and used a mathematical model to estimate the number of
melanoblast progenitors specified in the pre-migratory neural
crest14.
Dorsolateral migration was first demonstrated by the capacity
of grafted mouse skin to produce melanin in chick coelom17,18.
Later, this early work was confirmed in chimeric mice generated
by the aggregation of albino and pigmented cleavage-stage
embryos19. In this work, Mintz described a ‘standard pattern’
of 17 successive bands/stripes extending dorsoventrally. Although
the
interpretation
of
the
number
of
stripes
was
later
criticized20,21, the acceptance of the stripes as representing
directed dorsolateral migration remained. However, using a
Dct::laacZ
transgene
to
label
individual
lacZ
revertant
melanoblast clones, Wilkie et al.22 observed a surprising degree
of mixing at the axial level. The patterns observed were hard to
reconcile with directed migration and suggested that different cell
dispersal mechanisms may act in the head and trunk22.
Experimental measurements and mathematical modelling have
formed the basis of a number of studies on neural crest
colonization. The failure to colonize the embryonic intestine by
neural crest precursors in Hirschsprung’s disease has been
extensively studied23–27, as has the behaviour of chick cranial
neural crest populations28. Both continuous partial differential
equation population-level models23 and discrete lattice-based
individual-level
models29
have
been
employed
to
model
Hirschsprung’s disease. Zhang et al.29 demonstrated, using a
lattice-based
model,
that
colonization
of
the
intestine
is
more sensitive to changes in proliferation rate than in cell
migration23,29.
Stochastic
effects,
proposed
to
underlie
incomplete penetrance in some neurocristopathies30, have also
been investigated using individual-level modelling approaches.
In the present study we use experimental observations to
parameterize an agent-based stochastic model that allows us to
explore colonization of the trunk epidermis by migrating
melanoblasts.
We
conclude
that
a
simple
mechanism
of
undirected migration, proliferation and tissue expansion can
reconcile the patterns described above. Furthermore, Kit mutant
melanoblasts migrate normally but have a proliferation defect
that results in a depigmented ventral belly spot.
Results
Dermal and epidermal melanoblast migration is undirected.
To better understand the behaviour of melanoblasts during their
colonization of the developing embryo, and to understand how
this behaviour may result in the patterns described above
(Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), we performed ex vivo live imaging of
whole mouse embryos at E11.5 and E12.5 and of mouse
embryonic skin at E14.5 (refs 31,32). At E14.5 we used a Tyr::Cre
transgene expressing Cre-recombinase under the control of the
tyrosinase promoter with R26R-EYFP to label melanoblasts with
EYFP. At earlier stages, where Tyr::Cre activity in other neural
crest lineages made imaging of melanoblasts difficult, we used a
Pmel::CreERT2
knock-in
line
combined
with
R26R-EYFP
(Methods).
In
all
time-lapse
sequences
between
E11.5
(Supplementary Movies 1 and 2) and E15.5 melanoblasts
migrated constantly, only pausing when they briefly pass through
M-phase (Supplementary Movie 3). They are polarized and move
along their longest axis (or Feret’s diameter—see Fig. 1a and
Supplementary Movie 4). The Feret’s angle is therefore a good
proxy for the direction of instantaneous migration. The dis-
tribution of these angles in our time-lapse sequences is uniform,
consistent with completely random melanoblast orientation and
undirected migration. To confirm that this was not an artefact of
the ex vivo system we stained Dct::lacZ embryos expressing
b-galactosidase in the melanoblast lineage6 and observed the
same random distribution of melanoblast angles at time points
between E11.5 and E15.5 (Supplementary Table 1). There is thus
no directionality associated with melanoblast migration in
developing dermis at E11.5–E12.5 or epidermis at E13.5–E15.5.
We therefore assume this is also the case at E10.5 when cell
numbers are too low to perform a rigorous analysis.
Melanoblast dispersal is not mediated by repulsion. Time-lapse
sequences were sampled from E14.5 embryos in the mid-trunk
region at a range of dorsoventral positions resulting in a range of
melanoblast densities. To investigate whether any mechanism of
mutual repulsion between adjacent melanoblasts influenced their
position, we tested whether the spacing of melanoblasts con-
formed to complete spatial randomness (CSR)33. There was no
association between melanoblast density and the P value of a
Berman’s test comparing each pattern with CSR, and 99.5% of
examples did not deviate from CSR (Fig. 1b). We reasoned that
there should still be an effect over very short distances due to
exclusion at the scale of single cells and so examined the pair-
correlation function (PCF)34–36, a summary statistic that provides
a measure of spatial patterning on different scales (Methods).
This showed a non-random spatial segregation of melanoblasts
below around 28 mm (Fig. 1c), consistent with volume exclusion
at the scale of an individual cell. Above this distance the spacing
of cells conformed to CSR. The melanoblast distribution at E14.5
(before hair follicle localization) is therefore spatially random,
and repulsion between melanoblasts does not contribute to their
dispersal.
Melanoblast migration/proliferation are density dependent.
We examined the population spread of melanoblasts in our E14.5
time-lapse sequences and calculated its mean squared displace-
ment (MSD). We found MSD to be directly proportional to time,
indicating
that
diffusion
is
an
appropriate
mathematical
description of melanoblast migration and consequently that
the melanoblast population is not migrating with a preferred
direction (Fig. 1d,e). Similar results were observed at E13.5 and

 E15.5. Owing to the small number of melanoblasts at E11.5 we
were not able to perform a diffusion analysis but their behaviour
appeared qualitatively similar to E14.5 melanoblasts (compare
Supplementary Movies 1 and 2 with Supplementary Movie 3).
Diffusive motion is characterized by its diffusion coefficient (D),
which is proportional to the gradient of the plot in Fig. 1e.

E14.5 skin. The Feret’s diameter of each cell body is indicated in cyan. The path of a single migrating cell is indicated in red. Melanoblasts migrate along
their Feret’s diameter—the longest distance between any two points along a given boundary. The distribution of the Feret’s angles in the time-lapse
sequences invariably conformed to a uniform distribution (Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test P40.05 in all cases, n ¼ 414 independent tests) implying that
melanoblast migration is undirected. (b) An analysis of the spacing of melanoblasts in the time-lapse sequences at E14.5. A range of cell densities was
observed at the start of each time-lapse (t ¼ 0) between 242 and 780 cells per mm2 (mean±95% CI ¼ 448.52±57.46 cells per mm2, n ¼ 20).
Independent spatial patterns were generated by sampling each time-lapse at 40-min intervals. Each spatial pattern (n ¼ 414 patterns) representing the x, y
position of the centre of mass of each cell was tested for complete spatial randomness (CSR) using a Berman’s test for a point process model. In the
majority of examples the pattern conforms to CSR (n ¼ 412 out of 414 independent tests). The 0.05 significance line is indicated in red, the Berman’s
P value is plotted against the cell density at t ¼ 0. (c) Average PCF for melanoblast spatial organization at E14.5 for data in b. The red line indicates
complete spatial randomness at all distances. Melanoblast spacing conforms to CSR at distances over B28 mm. (d) All tracks of a time-lapse sequence
plotted from a zero origin showing a homogeneous population spread. (e) Plot of the MSD of the tracks panel 1d against time. A straight line through the
origin (red) can be fitted to the data (black) indicating that the population is diffusing. The slope of the line is used to derive the diffusion coefficient (D).

 The length and width of the embryonic trunk increase linearly
between E10.5 and E15.5 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2),
this is accompanied by B6-fold increase in the number of
melanoblasts between E10.5 and E11.5 (as identified by Dct::lacZ
staining, Fig. 2b,c) and an increase in the mean melanoblast
density in the mid-trunk region from B200 to B700 cells per
mm2 between E12.5 and E15.5 (Fig. 2d). We examined the
relationship between cell density and D and found a strong
negative correlation (Fig. 2e); melanoblasts diffuse faster when
they are less densely packed. We also examined melanoblast
proliferation by measuring the frequency and length of mitotic
events (Supplementary Movie 5). The mean melanoblast M-phase
length (Tm) was independent of cell density, but the proportion of
mitotic cells (Pmc) was strongly negatively correlated with density
and the cell cycle time (Tc ¼ Tm/Pmc)37–39 was consequently
strongly positively correlated with increasing density (Fig. 2f and
Supplementary Fig. 1d,e).
Stochastic modelling of melanoblast colonization. We hypo-
thesized that undirected melanoblast movement and prolifera-
tion, in tandem with tissue growth (Fig. 2a and Supplementary
Table 2) are sufficient for melanoblast colonization and that this
simple mechanism can explain the patterns observed in chimeras,

 individually labelled clones and Kit mutants. We used our
observations to parameterize a stochastic model of melanoblast
colonization of the trunk (Methods). Our modelling framework
only considers the growth of the trunk region and its colonization
by the migrating melanoblast population. The domain is limited
axially to the region between and not including the limb buds and
encompasses the complete dorsoventral length (Fig. 2a and
Methods). We assume that no new melanoblasts are specified
after
E10.5
and
therefore
that
the
growing
melanoblast
population is produced solely by the proliferation of this founder
population. Melanoblasts migrate first within the developing
dermis between E10.5 and E12.5, and subsequently within the
epidermis and dermis between E12.5 and E15.5. We collectively
refer to the dermal and epidermal layers that can support
melanoblast survival as the dorsoventral integument (DVI;
Methods, Supplementary Fig. 2) and assume that melanoblast
behaviour in these compartments is equivalent. We describe
above through analysis of cell orientations in Dct::lacZ embryos
and time-lapse experiments that there is no directed migration
in either compartment. In our simulations we employed an
agent-based, discrete-space random-walk model on a growing
two-dimensional lattice employing volume exclusion, whereby at
most one agent (melanoblast) occupies each square lattice site,
and melanoblasts cannot migrate or proliferate into occupied
sites40. The stochastic events are simulated using the Gillespie
algorithm (Methods)41.
Using the parameters generated from our experimental
observations (Methods and Supplementary Table 3) our model
was able to replicate the relationships between cell density, the
diffusion coefficient and cell cycle time described above (red lines
in Fig. 2e,f). It predicts colonization of the growing domain. That
is, the averaged cell density in the model at all stages of
embryonic development closely fits our experimental data
(Fig. 3a). Examples of domain colonization are provided in
Supplementary Movie 6 and Supplementary Fig. 4a.
Chimeric and mosaic patterns formed by a common mechanism.
To explore the relationship between mixing, tissue growth and
proliferation we simulated rare melanoblast clones (by mimicking
in silico the experiments of Wilkie et al.22; Methods, Fig. 3e–f),
and chimeric patterns (two coloured and multi coloured; Fig. 3b–c
and Methods). Our analysis of simulation data suggests that the
prominence of stripe-like patterns (an emergent property of the
model—Figs 3b,c and 5; column a–g) is influenced by the number
of clonal subtypes at the start of a simulation and the degree to
which they are mixed. We find that stripes are most apparent
when we initialize with only two clonal subtypes where a single,
low frequency corresponding to the two-striped pattern is clearly
identifiable in the discrete fast Fourier transform (DFFT) of the
clonal signal (Fig. 4c and Methods). This corresponds to most
experimental patterns in mice consisting of only two colours
(Fig. 3d, Methods and Fig. 4). Our analysis suggests these stripes
are composed of multiple subclones of like genotype, formed by
the stochastic coalescence of like clones and that, contrary to
received wisdom, stripe formation does not proceed through the
directed migration of coherent or descendent clones42 but rather
stripes form from a favourable arrangement of like clones in the
initial conditions that are elongated dorsoventrally by the bias in
growth in that direction (Supplementary Table 2). Increasing the
number of differently labelled clonal populations removes the
stripe-like pattern in the chimeras (Figs 4d and 5). For example,
compare the panels in Figs 3c and 5a–h, showing two-colour and
multicolour depictions of single simulations. The dominant
patches of colour in the first panel (Fig. 3c, top; and Fig. 5a–g)
are composed of multiple subclones in the second (Fig. 3c,
bottom; and Fig. 5b–h). Clones originating from what was
previously the same labelled subpopulation (but not progeny of
the same initial cell) now appear distinct from each other.
If subpopulations are not well segregated initially then the
formation of dorsoventral stripes is also less likely. Examples of
well-segregated and poorly segregated initial subpopulations and
the resulting patterns are shown in Fig. 4e,f, respectively. When
rare melanoblast clones (Fig. 3e,f) are simulated (Methods) and
plotted individually, they appear qualitatively similar to the
patterns previously described in Dct::laacZ embryos22, and are
therefore reconciled with stripe formation in our model.
Stochastic evolution of dominant lineages in the model. Using
our discrete model we observed a weak selection bias towards a
small number of dominant lineages. Typically the two most
dominant lineages (of the 21 initially specified) in a given
simulation accounted for around 25% of the total number of
melanoblasts at the end of the simulation (Supplementary
Fig. 3b). To explore this effect further we initialized our
discrete model with the movement and proliferation parameters
employed in this study but with the same initial agent distribution
and
domain
size
described
by
Cheeseman
et
al.26,27—a
two-dimensional square lattice of size Lx(t) ¼ 50 by Ly(t) ¼ 50
in which the 10 left-most columns are fully occupied. Using these
conditions we observed a strong selection bias towards a small
proportion of clonal subtypes. On average, two agents from the
original 500 contributed over 25% of the final agent density
(Supplementary Fig. 3c,d). This suggests that selection bias is
heavily influenced by the initial conditions. The relatively sparsely
packed distribution of melanoblasts at E10.5 would likely result in
a weaker selection bias than in the developing intestine where
pre-enteric neural crest cells are more numerous and tightly
packed in the foregut before they embark on their colonization43.
Belly spots arise from reduced proliferation in Kit mutants.
Belly-spot formation has long been proposed a product of either
altered proliferation or migration or both. To compare these
effects in the model we performed a parameter sweep comparing
the extent of colonization at different values of D and Tc. This
revealed that our stochastic model is markedly more sensitive to
changes in proliferation rate than in the diffusion coefficient
(Fig. 6a). Nf1 is a GTPase-activating protein that negatively
regulates Ras activity downstream of Kit signalling. Ablation of
Nf1 results in constitutive Ras activity and increased prolifera-
tion44. To investigate the role of Kit signalling in melanoblast
colonization we performed live-imaging experiments at E14.5,
labelling melanoblasts on a KitW-v/ þ background45 or ablating
Nf1 (Methods) to generate melanoblast-specific Nf1 � / �
or
Nf1 þ / � genotypes. We found a lower density of melanoblasts
in the E14.5 trunk of KitW-v/ þ mice whilst the density was
increased in Nf1 � / � mice implying a reduction and an increase
in melanoblast proliferation, respectively (Fig. 6b). However
contrary to expectations we observed a significantly higher rate of
diffusion in KitW-v/ þ mutants. Diffusion was reduced in Nf1 � / �
animals, but the change was not significant (Fig. 6c). A plot of
density against D (Fig. 6d) indicates that for their given densities
KitW-v/ þ and Nf1 � / � melanoblasts behave in a similar manner
to wild type (the negative association with density observed in
wild type is preserved when the data are combined; Fig. 6d)
suggesting that the change in diffusion rates are a consequence of
changes in cell density.
Plotting Tc against density for KitW-v/ þ, Nf1 þ / � and Nf1 � / �
mutants and wild type we find that for a given density KitW-v/ þ
melanoblasts proliferate more slowly than would be expected
and Nf1 � / � more quickly (negating the positive wild-type

 association with density when the data are combined; Fig. 6e).
We calculated a corrected cell cycle time (as Tc/density multiplied
by 200 cells per mm2) this revealed a longer cell cycle time in
KitW-v/ þ melanoblasts (Supplementary Fig. 1g), and is the likely
causal factor in belly-spot formation. We used our model to test
this conclusion with the assumption that as melanoblasts are
specified from the neural crest in a Kit-/Kitl-independent
manner1 there would be equal numbers in wild-type and
KitW-v/ þ
melanoblasts in the MSA at E10.5. Accordingly,
increasing cell cycle time in the model results in the failure of
melanoblasts to fully populate the domain and produces a white
belly spot that mimics that seen in vivo (Fig. 6f, Supplementary
Fig. 4 and Supplementary Movie 7). As the cell cycle time is
increased, belly spots are increasingly observed, followed, at

 longer times, by dorsal spots along with larger belly spots. This is
consistent with existing mutant phenotypes, small spots are
usually confined to the belly, whilst larger belly spots are often
accompanied by dorsal spotting, such as in mutants of Rac1
(ref. 46) or Magoh47. Furthermore, despite there being no change
in cell motility on the Nf1 � / � background, loss of Nf1 rescues
the belly spot in KitW-v/ þ individuals (Fig. 7a–d).
Discussion
In summary we show experimentally that migrating melanoblasts
do not have preferred directionality, but rather diffuse and
proliferate throughout the developing skin in a density-dependent
manner.
Furthermore,
repulsive
events
between
adjacent
melanoblasts do not seem to contribute to their dispersal, and
the well-characterized ‘follow my leader’ behaviour observed in
cranial neural crest populations28 was not observed. The spatial
distribution of melanoblasts appears random above a distance of
B28 mm. Consistent with this, occasional polygonal regions of
exclusion are observed (Supplementary Movie 4), reflecting
the underlying packing of the epidermal keratinocytes. We
demonstrate experimentally that melanoblasts carrying the KitW-v
mutation do not migrate more slowly, but instead diffuse in a
density-dependent manner similar to wild-type melanoblasts. The
mutant cells, however, proliferate more slowly than expected, and
our modelling suggests that this is the likely cause of the white
belly spot. Many mutations result in white belly spots48, often in
genes that would not be expected to affect cell motility such
as the translation initiation factor Eif3c (ref. 49), the ribosomal
protein S7 (ref. 50) and the chromatin-modifying enzyme Mysm1
(ref. 51). We suggest that in many cases the white spotting is due
to defects in melanoblast proliferation rather than motility.
Using stochastic individual-level modelling we have examined
the importance of density-dependent diffusion and proliferation
for colonization of the DVI and conclude that colonization is
most sensitive to changes in proliferation. This is in agreement
with Zhang et al.29 who explored the interaction between neural
crest migration and proliferation using an on-lattice model for
the colonization of the gut by enteric ganglia progenitors29.
One weakness of our model is that it assumes that melanoblast
behaviour is equivalent in the relatively sparsely packed three-
dimensional dermal environment between E10.5 and E12.5,
and in the more tightly packed two-dimensional epidermal
environment between E12.5 and E15.5. Experimentally, we
demonstrate that this is qualitatively the case but there will
certainly be minor differences. The on-lattice approach we use is
more appropriate for the latter of these scenarios. However, to
represent these two environments separately would require a
computationally intensive hybrid model and a number of new

 and potentially inaccessible parameters, which would complicate
the model and hamper the investigation of the patterning
questions we chose to address. Our model assumes that all
melanoblasts
arise
by
proliferation
of
the
differentiated
melanoblasts present at E10.5. This may not be the case as
further cells fated to be melanoblasts may differentiate after
E10.5. Another source of melanoblasts may be from Schwann cell
precursors (SCPs) emanating from the dorsal ramus from E12.5
onwards as has been proposed by Adameyko et al.52. However, as
the lineage tracing approach that identified these cells has been
questioned53,54 and we have no access to the key parameters of
their possible behaviour, incorporating Schwann cell precursor-
derived melanoblasts into the present model is not feasible.
Cheeseman et al.26,27 investigated the dominance of sub-
lineages in a lattice-based discrete model. They found that in
many cases the progeny of two cells (of the 500 they initialized)
could contribute in the order of 25% of the cells in the final
population. This effect was mediated by a process of sequential
isolation of individual lineages deprived of space to proliferate
into26,27. This stochastic drift in clone size has been demonstrated
experimentally and explored mathematically in the mouse
intestine55–57. Selection of dominant lineages is relatively weak
in our simulations of melanoblast domain colonization owing to
the more diffuse initial conditions. More cells are able to establish
a significant lineage because they have the required space to
proliferate initially and consequently fewer lineages become
spatially isolated. This implies that the stripes seen in our model
are predominantly formed by the coalescence of multiple like-
coloured subclones, and not by the presence of dominant
lineages. Furthermore, in our model, the domain grows in both
the dorsoventral and axial directions, whereas in Cheeseman
et al.26,27 domain growth is only in the dorsoventral direction or
is absent. The two-dimensional growth in our model further
reduces the role of dominant lineages since cells, which may
previously have been isolated, can gain space into which they may
proliferate through domain growth events. Our modelling shows
that the generation of rare clones22 and chimeric patterns19
can proceed through a common mechanism employing tissue
expansion and density-dependent movement and proliferation.
Further experimental clonal analyses, using stochastic labelling
methods such as brainbow/confetti57,58, are required to explore
whether our predictions of the behaviour of melanoblast
subclones are accurate.
In conclusion, belly-spot formation, chimeric patterns and
diffuse clonal patterns are all explained by a simple model
incorporating random melanoblast migration with proliferation,
in conjunction with domain growth, during the course of
colonization. Importantly, colonization and the observed pheno-
types are produced without the need for more complex cell–cell
interactions
or
extracellular
signals
and
this
has
broader
implications for cell behaviour in other NCSC lineages and their
associated neurocristopathies.

KitW-v/ þ individuals or between Tyr::CreBTg/Tg; Kit þ / þ and R26YFPRTg/Tg;

and R26YFPRTg/Tg; Nf1flox/flox individuals were used on a mixed genetic
background. E14.5 Tyr::CreB þ ve; Nf1flox/flox individuals were viable and
morphologically indistinguishable from their litter mates. To image melanoblast
behaviour in whole embryos at E11.5 we examined the progeny of a cross between
PmelCreERT2 /CreERT2; R26R-YFPTg/Tg individuals on a mixed background.
The pregnant mothers were given 8 mg of 4-hydroxytamoxifen per 40 g body
weight gavage or injectionat E10.5. To investigate melanoblast numbers in
fixed tissues Dct::lacZTg/Tg and Dct::lacZTg/ þ embryos were used resulting from
crosses between combinations of Dct::lacZTg/ þ, Dct::lacZTg/Tg and Dct::lacZ þ / þ
parents on CD1 background. Embryos used for optical projection tomography
were F1 hybrids from a cross between the mouse strains C57Bl6 and CBA
(obtained from Charles River Laboratories, UK).
Embryonic skin culture and imaging of whole embryos. Embryonic skin culture
was performed as described in Mort et al.31. Briefly, up to six cultures were imaged
in parallel per experiment. Skin was sampled from the flank of E13.5, 14.5 and 15.5
mouse embryos. The dorsoventral position varied but was never taken at the
ventral extreme. The skin samples were mounted on a clip filled with 1% w/v
agarose (in PBS) and secured with suture thread. The clip was then inserted into a
custom designed six-well chamber so that the skin was sandwiched against a
lummox gas-permeable membrane (Greiner). The wells were filled with DMEM
(no phenol red) supplemented with 1 � Glutamax (Gibco), 1% v/v penicillin/
streptomycin and 10% v/v fetal calf serum. Whole E11.5 embryos were embedded
in 1% w/v agarose (in PBS) in a large custom-made imaging clip so that the dorsal
region of the flank was just protruding above the surface of the agarose. The clip
was then inserted into a custom designed six-well chamber so that the protruding
region of the embryo was pressed against a lummox gas-permeable membrane
(Greiner). The wells were filled with DMEM (no phenol red) supplemented
with 1 � Glutamax (Gibco), 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin and 10% v/v fetal
calf serum.
X-Gal staining of embryos. X-Gal staining of Dct::lacZ embryos was performed as
previously described6. Briefly, embryos were fixed in 4% w/v paraformaldehyde for
varying times depending on developmental stage. They were then permeabilized in
detergent wash solution (2 mM MgCl2, 0.05% w/v BSA, 0.1% w/v sodium
deoxycholate and 0.02% v/v Igepal in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer; pH 7.3)
before being stained overnight in X-Gal stain solution (5 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mM
K4Fe(CN)6, and 0.085% w/v NaCl with 0.1% w/v X-gal in detergent wash).
Embryos were then subjected to further washes in detergent wash solution and
then PBS before being post-fixed in 4% w/v paraformaldehyde (in PBS).
Image acquisition. Time-lapse sequences of migrating melanoblasts in embryonic
skin culture and whole embryos were captured on a Nikon A1R inverted confocal
microscope using a � 20 objective, images were captured at 2-min (for skin) or
5-min (for embryos) intervals over the course of the experiment. A stage top
environmental chamber was used providing 5% CO2 in air and maintaining a
constant temperature of 37 �C. Images of X–Gal-stained Dct::lacZ embryos were
captured on a Nikon macroscope using a ring light for illumination and a � 2
Nikon objective with � 2 optical zoom.
Optical projection tomography. Optical projection tomography (OPT) was
performed on Bouin’s fixed mouse embryos at 1-day stages between E10.5 and
E15.5. Samples were mounted in 1% low-melting-point agarose, dehydrated in
methanol and then cleared overnight in BABB (1 part benzene alcohol:2 parts
benzene benzoate). Samples were scanned using a Bioptonics OPT Scanner 3001
(Bioptonics, Edinburgh, UK) using a variety of fluorescent wavelengths to visualize
tissue autofluorescence (excitation 425/60 nm/emission 480 nm and excitation
480/40 nm/emission 510 nm). Resultant scans were then reconstructed using
proprietary software (nRecon/Skyscan, Belgium).
Image analysis and cell tracking. All image analysis tasks were performed using
custom written macros for the Fiji distribution of ImageJ62. All morphological and
tracking procedures were carried out on segmented images using standard ImageJ
routines. To automatically track melanoblasts in the time-lapse sequences a
modified version of the wrMTrck plugin (http://www.phage.dk/plugins/wrmtrck.
html) was used on segmented TIFF stacks, the script used relied on Gabriel
Landini’s morphology collection (http://www.mecourse.com/landinig/software/
software.html). The tracking and morphology data generated by the procedure
were recorded in a text file and used for the downstream analyses. The MSD of the
melanoblast population was calculated from this data using the time ensemble
averaging approach63, in a custom macro written for Fiji. Feret’s angles from
time-lapse sequences (E14.5) were calculated from the shape of the cell body
after image segmentation. The angle of migration in X–Gal-stained samples
(E11.5, 12.5, 13.5 and 15.5) was measured manually by drawing a line along the
longest axis of each cell in ImageJ. To calculate cell densities for stages E10.5 and
E11.5 (Fig. 3a) the total number of cells was divided by the area of the trunk
calculated from our OPT data. For all other stages the mid-domain density was
measured.
To analyse the cell cycle, only the first 4 h of each time-lapse was considered
to minimize laser exposure. The mean M-phase length (Tm) per time-lapse
was calculated from the length of five mitotic events. The mean proportion
of cells morphologically in M-phase (Pmc) per time-lapse was calculated from
five frames spaced 60 min apart over the first 4 h of each time-lapse. The cell
cycle time (Tc) for a given time-lapse was then calculated as Tc ¼ Tm/Pmc
(refs 37–39).
The PCF is a summary statistic that provides a quantitative measure of spatial
patterning. The function is derived by normalizing the counts of the distances
between pairs of agents34–36. It is therefore able to capture patterning and the
length scale of individual objects. We applied the PCF with non-periodic pairwise
distance counting to multiple microscopy images of melanoblasts in the developing
epidermis at E14.5 using a custom Matlab script. To avoid issues associated with
the image boundary (where cells had been lost due to image processing) we used

 only a 256 � 256 mm central portion of each image (we find similar results for
alternative window sizes if the central portion is positioned sufficiently far away
from the boundary).
Measurement of domain expansion. To measure the expansion of the
dorsoventral and axial domains of the trunk, OPT models were analysed using
ImageJ/Fiji. Two measurements of the trunk circumference were made at the levels
of the fore- and hindlimbs and averaged. For E10.5 where the umbilical hernia
encompasses most of the axial width of the domain the region comprising the
peritoneal membrane was excluded from the measurement as there is no dermal
tissue at this level for melanoblasts to colonize. The dorsoventral length was
defined as half the mean trunk circumference. Axial width was defined as the
length between the hind- and forelimb junctions incorporating the curve of the
domain at early stages (E10.5–E12.5).
Statistics. All statistical tests were performed using the ‘R’ statistics package,
an open-source software package based on the ‘S’ programming language
(http://www.R-project.org). The Berman’s64 test for a point process model was
performed using the additional ‘spatstat’ package (http://www.spatstat.org/).
All correlations were explored by examining the Pearson’s product-moment
correlation coefficient. Comparisons between multiple groups were undertaken
using a one-way analysis of variance. Subsequent pairwise comparisons were
performed using a Tukey’s honest significant difference test, which is corrected
for multiple testing.
Model framework. In our modelling framework we consider only the growth of
the trunk region of the developing embryo between and not including the limb
buds and its colonization by the migrating melanoblast population (Fig. 2a). We
assume that melanoblast behaviour in the dermis (between E10.5 and E12.5) and
the epidermis (between E12.5 and E15.5) is equivalent. The dermal and epidermal
layers that can support melanoblast survival are collectively referred to as the DVI.
We use an agent-based discrete random-walk model with volume exclusion on a
two-dimensional square lattice of length Lx(t) by Ly(t) to model the DVI Lx(t)
represents the dorsoventral length of the domain at time t and Ly(t) the axial length
at time t. The lattice spacing is denoted D and time evolves continuously. Each
agent (melanoblast) is assigned to a lattice site, from which it can move or place
progeny into an adjacent site. Attempted agent movement or proliferation events
occur with rate Pm or Pp per unit time, respectively. That is, Pmdt is the probability
of a given agent attempting to move in the next infinitesimally small time interval
dt with events simulated as such using the Gillespie algorithm. If an agent attempts
to move or proliferate into a site that is already occupied, the event is aborted.
Modelling tissue expansion. To model domain growth we employ a stochastic
‘pushing’ growth mechanism as described in Binder et al.65. The insertion of new
lattice sites into the domain occurs with rates Pga and Pgd per unit time, for growth
in the axial and dorsoventral direction, respectively. When a ‘growth event’ occurs
in the dorsoventral direction (horizontal direction in Supplementary Fig. 2a), for
each row of the lattice one new site is added in a column, which is selected
uniformly at random. To accommodate the new sites, in each row, the sites to the
right of the added site are shifted a distance D rightwards carrying their contents
with them (that is, cells move with their sites). Likewise, for axial growth (in the
vertical direction in Supplementary Fig. 2b) one new site is added to each column
in a row, which is selected uniformly at random and the appropriate sites are
shifted upwards. Growth is linear in both the dorsoventral and axial directions as
evidenced by experimental data (Supplementary Table 2).
Implementation of model. Movement, proliferation and growth events are
modelled as exponentially distributed ‘reaction events’ in a Markov chain.
Specifically we use the ‘Gillespie’ Monte Carlo simulation algorithm to simulate
realizations of our model system. Each realization represents 5 days of real
time from E10.5 to E15.5. We implement zero-flux boundary conditions
on all boundaries in our discrete model. This represents the assumption that
melanoblast efflux is balanced by melanoblast influx at the boundaries of the
domain.
Modelling parameters from experimental data. Lattice spacing. The lattice
spacing is chosen as D ¼ 38 mm. This implies that a single agent excludes a volume
of 1,444 mm2, which is a realistic estimate for the size of a melanoblast. A com-
pletely colonized model domain (that is, every site in the computational domain is
occupied by an agent) has a density of B692 cells per mm2. Our experiments have
established that the mean (±95% confidence interval (CI)) density of a ‘colonized’
domain at E15.5 is 701.21±137.70 cells per mm2 (main text, Fig. 2d).
Domain size and growth rates. Linear isotropic domain growth for the axial
and dorsoventral domains was defined from morphological analysis of
optical projection tomographs at embryonic stages between E10.5 and E15.5
(Supplementary Table 2). We initialize the domain as a rectangle of length
1,178 mm in the dorsoventral direction and 1,634 mm in the axial direction
(corresponding to 31 lattice sites by 43 lattice sites, respectively). Although the
domain grows stochastically, we employ constant growth rates Pga¼ 0.00526min � 1
and Pgd ¼ 0.0246 min � 1 in the axial and dorsoventral directions, respectively, such
that the mean-field growth in each direction is linear and matches with the
experimentally measured linear domain growth relationship.
Initial number and position of cells. We defined the number of progenitor
melanoblasts by counting the melanoblasts in the trunk of Dct::lacZ embryos at
E10.5; a mean (±95% CI) of 20.32±5.95 melanoblasts (Fig. 2c). In our Dct::lacZ
embryos we noted an under-representation of melanoblasts in the centre of the
trunk region, although not always clear at E10.5 this was most striking at E11.5
(Supplementary Fig. 1c). We therefore weighted our initial distribution in a similar
manner, initializing 21 agents such that on average one-third are between
sites 12 and 32 of the axial axis, and the remaining two-thirds are evenly
distributed between sites 1 and 11, and 33 and 43 corresponding to a slight
under-representation in the middle of the axial axis. These agents are distributed
so that 95% are between sites 8 and 17 of the dorsoventral axis. All agents are
distributed between sites 8 and 19 of the dorsoventral axis.
Diffusion rate. As described in the main text we determined experimentally a
density-dependent relationship between melanoblast diffusion and local density
(main text, Fig. 2e). To determine the same relationship in our model we track
agents moving on a 646 � 646-mm domain (corresponding to 17 � 17 sites) with
periodic boundary conditions. This domain size corresponds, approximately, to the
field of view of the microscope used to collect the experimental data on melanoblast
movement. At t ¼ 0 in the simulation, a number of agents (from 1 to 289,
representing all possible non-zero agent densities) are initialized with positions
chosen uniformly at random throughout the domain. These agents are allowed to
move (but not to proliferate, so as to keep the density constant) as described above
for a simulation duration equivalent to 400 min of real time. This process is
repeated 100 times for each agent density to guarantee enough data for an accurate
representation of the MSD of the population. In each simulation the resulting agent
tracks (excluding, for those agents that crossed a boundary, the portion of their
tracks after their first boundary crossing event, since the tracks of these agents
would be lost in our experimental system) are used to characterize the MSD as
described in the main text. To determine the movement rate Pm, we compare the
relationship between density and effective diffusion coefficient for the experimental
data to those for the model for a range of different values of Pm. We chose the value
of Pm that gives the best fit (smallest least squares error, l2 norm). This value Pm is
given in Supplementary Table 3.
Proliferation rate. We defined the maximum proliferation rate by counting the
number of melanoblasts in the trunk of Dct::lacZ E10.5 and E11.5 embryos. We
found a mean (±95% CI) of 20.32±5.95 melanoblasts increasing to 151.09±27.95
melanoblasts in the first 24 h (Fig. 2c). To estimate a maximum doubling time for
this period we used the mean cell number at E10.5 (–95% CI ¼ 14 cells) and the
mean cell number at E11.5 ( þ 95% CI ¼ 179 cells) implying a mean dermal
doubling time of 6.6 h. We therefore chose a maximum possible population
doubling time in the model of 7 h.
Simulation of rare clonal patterns. To investigate rare clones, at a time point
chosen uniformly at random during the simulation, we chose one of the agents,
from amongst all the agents that populate the domain at that time, with equal
probability. This agent is marked and all the agent’s progeny inherit the same mark.
At the end of the simulation all marked agents are plotted in a different colour to
the non-marked agents resulting in a diffuse rare clonal pattern as seen in
Supplementary Fig. 3a and in Fig. 3f.
Identification of stripe-like patterns in the model. To investigate chimeric
stripe-like patterns in our discrete model we initialized our simulations with two
distinctly labelled agent subpopulations and tracked the positions of their progeny
over time (Fig. 4a). When the simulation was complete, we assigned the value þ 1
(associated with light grey cells) to one of the agent types and � 1 (associated with
black cells) to the other (while empty lattice sites are assigned the value 0). We then
averaged the values associated with the lattice sites on each row. This provides a
measure of the proportion of each agent colour in each row, which we call the
‘clonal signal’ (Fig. 4b). We repeat this process for each of the possible divisions of
the 21 initial cells into two non-overlapping subsets, which we call a ‘clonal ratio’.
For instance to investigate the patterning of a single clone we label one clone with
þ 1s and remaining 20 clones with � 1s. In this way we can investigate the pattern
formed by a single clone amongst 21 differently labelled clones. Similarly, to
investigate the pattern formed by B11 distinctly labelled clones we label two of the
randomly selected clones with 1s and 19 with � 1s. To investigate the effect of
having only two different clonal labels, we label approximately half (10 or 11) of the
randomly selected clones with 1s and the other half with � 1s.
To identify the presence of stripe-like patterns in our simulations we apply the
DFFT to our intensity profiles. We repeat this process 100 times and generate an
average DFFT for each different initial clonal ratio (Fig. 4c). For simulations
without stripe-like patterns (that is, when the agents from different subpopulations
are well mixed) no dominant frequency is clearly identifiable. However, in the case
where different agent subpopulations are not well mixed and have formed
dorsoventral stripes, a single, low frequency is identifiable that relates directly to
the periodicity of the stripes in the simulation. A dominant frequency
(corresponding to the maximum value of the averaged DFFT) can be identified
for each initial clonal ratio. We call this dominant frequency the ‘stripe intensity’
(Fig. 3d). This method allows us to systematically identify the presence
of stripes.
