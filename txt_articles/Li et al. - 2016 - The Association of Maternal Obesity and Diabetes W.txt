abstract
BACKGROUND: Obesity and diabetes are highly prevalent among pregnant women in the 
United States. No study has examined the independent and combined effects of maternal 
prepregnancy obesity and maternal diabetes on the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
in parallel with other developmental disorders (DDs).
METHODS: This study is based on 2734 children (including 102 ASD cases), a subset of the 
Boston Birth Cohort who completed at least 1 postnatal study visit at Boston Medical Center 
between 1998 and 2014. Child ASD and other DDs were based on physician diagnoses as 
documented in electronic medical records. Risks of ASD and other DDs were compared 
among 6 groups defined by maternal prepregnancy obesity and diabetes status by using 
Cox proportional hazard regression controlling for potential confounders.
RESULTS: When examined individually, maternal prepregnancy obesity and pregestational 
diabetes (PGDM) were each associated with risk of ASD. When examined in combination, 
only mothers with obesity and PGDM (hazard ratio 3.91, 95% confidence interval 1.76–
8.68) and those with obesity and gestational diabetes (hazard ratio 3.04, 95% confidence 
interval 1.21–7.63) had a significantly increased risk of offspring ASD. Intellectual 
disabilities (IDs), but not other DDs, showed a similar pattern of increased risk associated 
with combined obesity and PGDM. This pattern of risk was mostly accounted for by cases 
with co-occurring ASD and ID.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal prepregnancy obesity and maternal diabetes in combination were 
associated with increased risk for ASD and ID. ASD with ID may be etiologically distinct 
from ASD without ID.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Maternal 
diabetes has been associated with increased risk 
of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children; 
the association between maternal prepregnancy 
obesity and ASD has been inconsistent. No study has 
examined the combined effects of the 2 conditions.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The combination of 
maternal obesity and diabetes was associated 
with greater risk of ASD than either obesity or 
diabetes alone, in particular when ASD co-occurred 
with intellectual disability. ASD with and without 
intellectual disability may be etiologically distinct.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
is a neurodevelopmental disorder 
characterized by severe deficits in 
socialization, communication, and 
repetitive or unusual behaviors, 
affecting 1 in 68 US children.1,2 
Since the 1960s, prevalence rates 
of ASD have increased dramatically, 
which cannot be entirely explained 
by changes in diagnostic practices.3 
During a similar time frame, obesity 
and diabetes rose to epidemic levels 
in the United States. Currently 
among women of reproductive age, 
more than a third are obese,4 ∼9% 
have prepregnancy diabetes, and an 
additional 2% to 10% will develop 
gestational diabetes (GDM) during 
pregnancy.5 Emerging evidence 
links maternal prenatal diabetes 
with the risk of ASD in children.6 
Research on the connection 
between maternal obesity and 
the risk of ASD has produced 
inconsistent results.7–10 Although 
obesity and diabetes are highly 
comorbid,11 rarely have studies 
attempted to disentangle their 
independent and combined effects 
on ASD. In addition, although ASD 
frequently co-occurs with other 
developmental disorders (DDs) 
and may have shared etiology 
with some DDs,12 few of the 
aforementioned studies included 
other DDs as alternative outcomes.
In this study, we used a prospective 
birth cohort to (1) examine the 
independent and combined 
associations of maternal obesity 
and diabetes with ASD in 
children controlling for potential 
confounders; and (2) contrast them 
with the effects on intellectual 
disability (ID), attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and 
other DDs in children. In addition, 
we also explored potential etiologic 
heterogeneity of ASD relative to 
ID by distinguishing ASD with and 
without ID, as well as ID without 
ASD. The cohort is a low-income US 
urban minority population, where 
burdens of maternal obesity and 
diabetes are especially high.
METHODS
Participants and Data Collection 
Procedures
This study included 2734 mother-
child pairs, a subset of the Boston 
Birth Cohort (BBC) recruited 
at birth at the Boston Medical 
Center (BMC) from 1998 to 2014 
who had at least 1 postnatal 
follow-up. Initially designed as a 
molecular epidemiologic study on 
determinants of low birth weight 
and preterm birth,13 mothers who 
delivered a singleton live birth 
were eligible, and for every preterm 
(<37 weeks) and/or low birth 
weight (<2500 g) birth, 2 term (≥37 
weeks) and normal birth weight 
(>2500 g) infants and mothers 
were enrolled. The exclusion 
criteria included multiple-gestation 
pregnancies, pregnancies resulting 
from in vitro fertilization, deliveries 
resulting from maternal trauma, 
and newborns with major birth 
defects.
We approached the mothers 24 to 
72 hours postpartum. After gaining 
informed consent, we conducted 
a face-to-face interview with the 
mother by using a standardized 
questionnaire. We reviewed maternal 
and infant medical records by using a 
standardized abstraction form.
Children who continued to seek 
postnatal care at BMC were followed. 
We obtained all child electronic 
medical records (EMRs), which 
contained physician primary 
and secondary diagnoses in the 
International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision for each 
postnatal visit since 2003. The 
median length of postnatal follow-up 
is 6.0 years (interquartile range 3.6–
9.0). The study was approved by the 
institutional review board of Johns 
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public 
Health and Boston University Medical 
Center.
Defi
 nition of Maternal Obesity, 
Maternal Diabetes, and Other 
Covariates
Maternal prepregnancy weight and 
height were reported in maternal 
postpartum interview, and were 
used to calculate BMI. Overweight 
and obesity status were defined 
separately for mothers older than 
and younger than 20 years.14 
Underweight mothers constituted a 
very small proportion of our sample, 
and did not demonstrate differences 
in offspring ASD risk compared with 
those of normal weight, thus were 
combined with those of normal 
BMI. For a subset of mothers (n 
= 738), height and weight during 
preconception or within 6 weeks 
of gestation were also available in 
their prenatal EMR. There was a 
high correlation between maternal 
self-report and EMR recorded BMI 
(Pearson r = 0.91).
Pregestational diabetes (PGDM) 
and GDM were identified based on 
maternal medical records. Mothers 
ever diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 
(250.00–250.93) constituted the 
PGDM cases; those ever diagnosed 
with diabetes mellitus complicating 
pregnancy (648.00 and 648.03) 
but never diagnosed with diabetes 
mellitus constituted the GDM cases. 
The joint status of maternal obesity 
status (obese versus nonobese) and 
diabetes status (no diabetes, GDM, 
and PGDM) defined 6 nonoverlapping 
groups: no diabetes or obesity, GDM 
without obesity, PGDM without 
obesity, obesity without diabetes, 
obesity with GDM, and obesity with 
PGDM.
Maternal demographics and health 
behaviors were based on maternal 
postpartum interview. Preeclampsia, 
chronic hypertension, and mode

of delivery were defined by using 
maternal medical review. Birth 
outcomes were defined by using 
infant medical record review: 
gestational age was classified as 
full term (≥37 weeks), late preterm 
(≥34 weeks and <37 weeks), and 
early preterm (<34 weeks); birth 
weight was classified as non-low 
birth weight (≥2500 g), low birth 
weight (1500–2499 g), and very low 
birth weight (≤1499 g); gestational 
age–specific birth weight percentile 
defined small for gestational age 
(<10th percentile for the gestational 
age), appropriate for gestational age 
(between 10th and 90th percentile 
for the gestational age), and large for 
gestational age (>90th percentile for 
the gestational age).
Identifi
 cation of Children With ASD, 
ID, ADHD, and Other DD
Based on EMRs, children ever 
diagnosed with autism (299.00), 
Asperger syndrome (299.80), 
and/or pervasive developmental 
disorder not otherwise specified 
(299.90) constituted the ASD 
cases. More than 80% (84 of 102) 
of ASD cases were diagnosed by 
relevant specialists (developmental 
behavioral pediatrics, pediatric 
psychology assessment clinic, 
developmental assessment 
clinic, pediatric neurology, and 
child psychology), the rest were 
diagnosed by pediatric clinical (10 
children), pediatric comprehensive 
care (3 children), and other 
departments (eg, pediatric 
gastroenterologist, family medicine, 
5 children). The median age when 
they were most recently diagnosed 
was 67 months (maximum 166 
months, minimum 12 months). 
Children ever diagnosed with 
developmental delay not elsewhere 
classified (315.8), tuberous 
sclerosis with developmental 
delay (316 and 759.5), intellectual 
disability (317, 318.0–318.2, and 
319), and/or Down syndrome 
(758.0) constituted the ID cases. 
Children ever diagnosed with 
ADHD (314.0–314.9) constituted 
the ADHD cases. Children ever 
diagnosed with language delay, 
coordination disorders, or 
learning disorders (315.0–315.5) 
constituted the other DD cases. 
The classification of DDs is similar 
to Levy et al.12 Children who did 
not belong to any of the DD groups 
constituted the typically developing 
(TD) group. As there is no evidence 
that 1 type of DD is secondary to 
another type, we allowed subjects 
to be classified into multiple DD 
groups; as a result, the sum of all 
DD groups and TD group exceeded 
100%.
Statistical Analysis
Rates of DDs were compared among 
exposure groups by using Cox 
proportional hazard regressions to 
account for the variability in length 
of postnatal follow-up. We defined 
time origin as the birth of the child, 
and time of entry as the child’s 
first postnatal visit recorded in the 
EMR. Time of event is when a case 
is diagnosed, and time of censoring 
for those never diagnosed with 
any DD is the last visit recorded 
on EMR. We first regressed each 
covariate on ASD status adjusting 
for demographic variables (year 
of birth, maternal age, gender of 
the child, and maternal parity) to 
identify covariates meaningfully 
associated with ASD (defined as 
P ≤ .1). Then, we examined the 
association between risk of ASD 
and (1) maternal BMI, (2) maternal 
diabetes, and (3) the joint status 
of maternal BMI and diabetes, 
adjusting for the demographic 
variables and the covariates 
identified previously. The same 
regression models were repeated 
by using ID, ADHD, and other DD as 
outcomes, respectively.
To explore potential etiologic 
heterogeneity, we cross-classified 
ASD and ID cases into ASD without 
ID, co-occurring ASD and ID, and 
ID without ASD, and repeated the 
aforementioned model in (3) on 
these outcomes.
To evaluate the sensitivity of our 
results relative to the definition 
of ASD, we repeated our analyses 
restricting ASD cases to those with 
at least 2 instances of diagnosis, and 
ever diagnosed by the specialists.
RESULTS
Of the 2734 children, we identified 
102 (3.7%) ASD cases, 137 (5.0%) 
ID cases, 301 (11.0%) ADHD cases, 
and 864 (31.6%) other DD cases 
(groups are not mutually exclusive); 
1748 (63.9%) children did not 
receive any of the DD diagnoses, 
thus were identified as TD. Most 
ASD cases (92.2%) received 
another DD diagnosis, of which 
the most common is other DD; 
substantial proportions of ID cases 
(88.3%), ADHD cases (69.1%), 
and other DD cases (35.8%) also 
received another DD diagnosis. 
The characteristics of each 
developmental condition group are 
shown in Table 1. Compared with 
TD children, children with ASD 
were more likely to be boys, to be 
born early preterm, and of very 
low birth weight; their mothers 
were more likely to be older, to be 
obese prepregnancy, and to have 
PGDM or GDM. Children with ID 
had similar maternal and child 
characteristics as children with 
ASD, in addition to being more 
likely to be of the mothers’ third or 
higher-order birth, to be small for 
gestational age, and to be delivered 
via cesarean. Children with ADHD 
were more likely to be boys, to 
be born early preterm, of very 
low birth weight, and by cesarean 
delivery. Their mothers were more 
likely to have lower educational 
achievement; to be black; to be 
widowed, divorced, or separated 
from husband; to be obese; and

to have used alcohol during 
pregnancy. Children with other DD 
had the similar child characteristics 
as children with ADHD; their 
mothers were more likely to be 
black, obese prepregnancy, and 
to have used alcohol during the 
pregnancy.
Adjusting for demographic variables, 
the risk of ASD was meaningfully 
associated (defined as P ≤ 0.1) with 
early preterm birth, very low birth 
weight, maternal obesity, PGDM, 
and smoking during pregnancy, 
respectively (see Supplemental 
Table 4). Very low birth weight was 
not considered an independent 
confounder, as it was not associated 
with risk of ASD after controlling for 
preterm birth status.
Table 2 shows the relationship 
between maternal obesity/
diabetes and the risk of DDs after 
adjusting for potential confounders. 
Irrespective of whether they had 
diabetes, mothers who were obese 
had an almost twofold risk of 
having a child with ASD compared 
with normal weight or underweight 
mothers (95% confidence interval 
[CI] 1.20–3.07). Regardless of 
obesity status, mothers with 
PGDM had more than a twofold 
risk of having a child with ASD 
relative to those without diabetes 
(95% CI 1.14–4.42). However, the 
association for GDM did not reach 
significance (hazard ratio [HR] 
1.86, 95% CI 0.92–3.76). Evaluated 
jointly, obesity without diabetes 
and also diabetes without obesity 
were each associated with slightly 
increased risk (P > .05) of ASD in 
children compared with the group 
with neither condition, whereas the 
combination of obesity and GDM 
(HR 3.04, 95% CI 1.21–7.63) or 
obesity and PGDM (HR 3.91, 95% 
CI 1.76–8.68) were associated with 
substantially higher risk of ASD 
in children (see Fig 1). Risk of ID 
relative to maternal obesity and 
diabetes shared similar patterns

(obesity: HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.09–
2.45; PGDM: HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.25–
4.09) or jointly (obesity without 
diabetes: HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.00–

95% CI 1.00–5.36; obesity with 
PGDM: HR 3.63, 95% CI 1.73–7.61). 
Risk for ADHD and other DD were 
slightly elevated and several were 
significant relative to maternal 
obesity and diabetes.
As shown in Table 3, compared 
with the group with neither 
condition, obesity without diabetes 
was associated with a slightly 
increased risk of ASD without ID 
(HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.06–3.97) in 
children. Obesity with GDM (HR 
6.53, 95% CI 2.45–17.38) and 
obesity with PGDM (HR 9.73, 95% 
CI 4.07–23.27) were associated 
with a large increased risk of 
co-occurring ASD and ID.
Sensitivity analyses using more 
stringent criteria to identify ASD cases 
are shown in Supplemental Tables 5 and 
6. The results were not substantively 
different from the main analyses.
DISCUSSION
This is a prospective birth cohort 
study: the first of its kind to examine 
the independent and combined 
association of maternal obesity 
and diabetes with the risk of ASD 
in children. We demonstrated that 
prepregnancy obesity and PGDM 
each were associated with a slightly 
increased risk of ASD, but the 
associations were most pronounced 
when mothers had both conditions. 
This pattern of risk was observed for 
children with ID, but not ADHD and 
other DDs. Furthermore, our results 
suggested that the association of 
maternal obesity and diabetes with 
ASD and ID may be entirely due to 
those cases with co-occurring ASD 
and ID.
In line with a recent meta-analysis, 
our study confirms a slightly 
increased ASD risk associated 
with maternal diabetes.6 However, 
whether and how the effects 
of GDM and PGDM differ is still 
debatable. Although the 2 studies 
differentiating PGDM and GDM in 
the meta-analysis both reported 
larger odds ratios (ORs) for PGDM 
than GDM,15,16 Xiang et al17 found 
that only GDM diagnosed before 
26 weeks, but not GDM diagnosed

after 26 weeks or PGDM, was 
significantly associated with risk 
for ASD. If the effect of early GDM 
is due to untreated hyperglycemia 
during early critical brain 
developmental windows, as Xiang 
et al17 suspected, it is possible 
that women with PGDM in our 
sample did not have well-controlled 
blood glucose levels, contributing 
to the increased risk of ASD in 
children.
Our study also supports a slightly 
increased risk of ASD associated 
with maternal obesity. Among 
the few studies on this topic, the 
population-based case-control 
study by Krakowiak et al7 reported 
a significant OR (1.7), similar to 
ours. A clinical cohort study of 62 
very preterm children by Reynolds 
et al9 reported a large increased 
OR (9.9) for a positive Modified 
Checklist for Autism in Toddlers 
screen, a proxy for ASD risk.18 
Another population-based cohort 
study by Moss et al8 found no direct 
effect; however, the prepregnancy 
BMI was reported 9 months after 
delivery, and autism was defined 
by parental report of diagnosis, 
where misclassification due to 
recalling/reporting errors may 
have biased the finding toward the 
null. A population-based cohort 
study by Surén et al10 found an 
increased OR (2.1) associated with 
maternal obesity that disappeared 
after adjusting for paternal obesity. 
Although potential confounding 
from paternal obesity was not 
testable in our study, the strong 
and consistent association between 
the co-occurring maternal obesity/
diabetes and ASD/ID suggest 
contrary to a simple confounding 
artifact.
We found that only the combination 
of obesity and diabetes was 
associated with significant risk of 
ASD, whereas each condition without 
the other was not. Although the 
sample size is too small to formally 
test for effect modification, our 
study suggests potential synergistic 
effects between maternal obesity 
and diabetes, and that omission of 
1 condition may result in biased 
estimates for the effect of the 
other. So far, very few studies have 
considered the 2 conditions in 
combination. Xiang et al17 focused on 
maternal diabetes and reported no 
confounding from maternal obesity, 
but this was tested only among a 
subcohort that was followed 0 to 3 
years, when most of their ASD cases 
were not yet diagnosed. Krakowiak 
et al7 considered maternal obesity, 
diabetes, and hypertension within 1 
group (metabolic syndrome), but no 
confounding or effect modification 
was tested.
Growing evidence suggests that 
ASD may be related to immunologic 
and metabolic disturbances 
associated with maternal obesity 
and diabetes. Obesity increases 
circulating proinflammatory 
cytokines in pregnant women.19,20 
In rat models, maternal peripheral 
inflammation resulted from high-
fat diet and obesity and can lead 
to offspring brain inflammation.21 
Maternal diabetes also induces 
proinflammatory environments 
in intrauterine tissues.22 Both 
intrauterine inflammation and 
fetal brain inflammation are 
implicated in the development 
of ASD.23–25 Diabetes also can 
lead to hyperglycemia. Maternal 
hyperglycemia triggers fetal 
hyperinsulinemia and increased 
oxygen consumption, inducing 
chronic intrauterine fetal tissue 
hypoxia.26 Maternal hyperglycemia 
is also associated with an increased 
production of free radicals and 
oxidative stress.27,28 Hypoxia29 and 
oxidative stress30 are also implicated 
as risk factors for ASD. Cooccurring 
obesity and diabetes may be 
“multiple hits” to the developing 
fetal brain, conferring an even 
higher risk of ASD in the offspring 
than a single condition. Future 
studies of a larger size are needed to 
formally test potential interactions 
between maternal obesity and 
diabetes.
In our study, maternal obesity and 
diabetes were associated with 
elevated risk of ID similar to that of 
ASD, whereas they were not clearly 
associated with risks of other DD and 
ADHD. The similarity between ASD 
and ID was mainly driven by cases 
with co-occurring ASD and ID. This 
suggests that co-occurring ASD and ID 
maybe an etiologically distinct group 
from the other 2 groups. In support of 
this hypothesis, we found that most 
Down syndrome ID cases, a condition 
clearly resulting from chromosomal 
rather than environmental causes, did 
not have co-occurring ASD (12 out of 
14). Given the small sample size, this 
result needs to be confirmed in larger 
studies.
Our study has several limitations. 
First, ASD and DD were identified 
if they ever received such a 
diagnosis. This approach is subject 
to misclassification error, as 
conditions may be underdiagnosed 
or misdiagnosed as other conditions, 
and the diagnosis can be tentative. 
However, we expect this error to 
bias our estimate toward the null. 
In addition, in the main analyses, 
restricting ASD to only those 
diagnosed at least twice and ever 
diagnosed by the specialist did 
not alter our results. Second, this 
report analyzed a subset of the 
BBC children who continued to 
receive pediatric care at the BMC. 
Concern for selection bias may 
be somewhat ameliorated, as the 
baseline characteristics between 
our study sample and the remaining 
BBC sample are comparable. As 
well, associations between well-
established risk factors such as 
maternal age, gender of the child, 
and preterm birth with ASD were 
replicated in our study sample. Third, 
postnatal visits before 2003 were

not captured in the EMR. However, 
our analyses took account of “late 
entry” into follow-up in the survival 
analysis; as ASD cases and non-ASD 
cases did not differ in late-entry 
status, therefore this was not likely 
to result in bias. Fourth, although 
we adjusted for well-recognized 
ASD risk factors, potential residual 
confounding, such as genetic 
susceptibility and other unknown 
risk factors, may still exist. Finally, 
caution is needed in generalizing our 
findings to other populations with 
different social, demographic, and 
clinical characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that children 
whose mothers had a combination 
of obesity and diabetes during 
pregnancy may have an elevated risk 
of developing ASD and ID.
