Abstract
Globally, nearly 2 billion people are infected with the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii1. 
This persistent infection can cause severe disease in immunocompromised people and is 
epidemiologically linked to major mental illnesses2 and cognitive impairment3. There are 
currently no options for curing this infection. The lack of effective therapeutics is due partly to a 
poor understanding of essential pathways that maintain this long-term infection. Although it is 
known that Toxoplasma replicates slowly within intracellular cysts demarcated with a cyst wall, 
precisely how it sustains itself and remodels organelles in this niche is unknown. Here we identify 
a key role for proteolysis within the parasite lysosomal organelle (the vacuolar compartment or 
VAC) in turnover of autophagosomes and persistence during neural infection. We found that 
disrupting a VAC-localized cysteine protease compromised VAC digestive function and markedly 
reduced chronic infection. Death of parasites lacking the VAC protease was preceded by

 accumulation of undigested autophagosomes in the parasite cytoplasm. These findings suggest an 
unanticipated function for parasite lysosomal degradation in chronic infection and identify an 
intrinsic role for autophagy in the T. gondii parasite and its close relatives. This work also 
identifies a key element of Toxoplasma persistence and suggests that VAC proteolysis is a 
prospective target for pharmacologic development.
The Toxoplasma lysosomal VAC contains two papain family cysteine proteases termed 
cathepsin protease L (CPL; toxodb accession number TGME49_321530) and cathepsin 
protease B (CPB; TGME49_249670)4–6. Upregulated expression of CPL and CPB in 
chronically infected mice7 suggests an active role for VAC proteolysis in Toxoplasma 
persistence. To test this prospect, we focused on CPL because maturation of CPB is 
dependent on its activity6, thus ablating CPL effectively impairs both proteases. Genetic 
ablation of CPL in Prugniaud (P) strain parasites, which express cytosolic GFP during 
chronic infection8, was confirmed by PCR, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting 
(Supplementary Figs 1–3). Consistent with findings in a different strain background9, PΔcpl 
acute stage parasites (tachyzoites) presented a dilated VAC suggestive of organellar 
dysfunction, a phenotype that was rescued by genetic complementation (Fig. 1a, b). 
Although CPL deficient parasites appeared to differentiate normally to chronic stage 
bradyzoites within cultured intracellular cysts (Fig. 1c), after differentiation they 
progressively lost stage specific expression of GFP (Fig. 1d,e) and viability (Fig. 1f). Re-
expression of active CPL restored cyst viability, whereas cysts expressing a catalytically 
inactive CPL (Fig. 1f) or treated with a CPL inhibitor (LHVS9; Fig. 1g and Supplementary 
Fig. 4) died. Taken together, these findings suggest a key role for VAC proteolytic activity 
for maintaining viability of cultured Toxoplasma cysts.
Next we sought to define the contribution of VAC proteolysis to infection in mice, which are 
a convenient model and an important natural host for T. gondii. Consistent with earlier 
work10, survival of PΔcpl infected mice was higher than WT-infected mice, indicating a role 
for CPL in acute virulence (Fig. 2a). Nevertheless, mice infected with 106 WT or PΔcpl 
showed a similar pattern of parasite burden in the first 8 days of infection (Fig. 2b)10, 
comparable kinetics of parasite entry into the brain (Fig. 2c) and lungs (Supplementary Fig. 
5), and similar cytokine profiles (Supplementary Fig. 5). Notably, mice infected with 
PruΔcpl had substantially fewer cysts despite comparable kinetics of acute infection (Fig. 2a, 
Supplementary Fig. 6). Further, although mice infected with the highest dose (107) of PΔcpl 
yielded cysts, these cysts contained markedly enlarged and misshapen bradyzoites (Fig. 2d).
To independently validate these findings we ablated CPL in the highly cystogenic ME49 
strain (MΔcpl; Supplementary Fig. 7). Mice infected with MΔcpl produced ~100-fold and 
~200-fold fewer cysts than WT infected mice at 5 weeks and 16 weeks post-infection, 
respectively. This deficit was partially rescued by re-expressing CPL during the chronic 
stage, but not when the protease was re-expressed in only the acute stage (Fig. 2e). 
Overexpression of CPL under the BAG1 chronic stage specific promoter might have 
contributed to incomplete rescue (Supplementary Fig. 7). Finally, WT parasites and strains 
re-expressing CPL in the chronic stage showed normal brain cyst morphology, whereas the 
CPL knockout parasite cysts or those with re-expression of CPL only in the acute stage were

 abnormally granulated and phase dark (Fig. 2f). Collectively these findings are consistent 
with a vital role for CPL in persistent neural infection of a mammalian host.
To identify a potential basis for loss of viability we examined cultured cysts by microscopy 
and noticed that bradyzoites genetically (PΔcpl) or chemically (LHVS) deficient in CPL 
activity showed large, dark cytoplasmic inclusions that were absent from WT or 
complemented parasites (Fig. 3a,b). Stage specific CPL re-expression during the persistent 
stage, but not the acute stage, eliminated the inclusions. These findings suggest the aberrant 
structures result from lack of CPL expression during the persistent stage, and are not a 
legacy of CPL deficiency during acute stage infection.
We reasoned that the dark inclusions were due to accumulation of undigested material 
within the VAC, and that some of the material could be derived from autophagy. Autophagy 
is a process whereby cytoplasmic contents including organelles are membrane encapsulated 
and degraded within lysosomes11. Toxoplasma and related apicomplexans including malaria 
parasites express a limited repertoire of autophagy (ATG) proteins12. These parasites also 
unconventionally require certain ATG proteins for maintenance of the apicoplast13, 14, a 
remnant non-photosynthetic chloroplast. Autophagosome-like structures have been observed 
under nutrient limiting conditions15, 16, but the extent to which the parasite encounters such 
conditions during infection remains unknown. To define the relationship between the 
intracellular inclusions and autophagosomes, we ectopically expressed a copy of 
Toxoplasma Atg8 fused to the fluorescent protein tdTomato in bradyzoites. WT cysts 
showed tdTomato-Atg8 fluorescent puncta, suggestive of baseline autophagy during normal 
parasite encystation (Fig. 3b). However, ablation of CPL or treatment with LHVS 
augmented tdTomato-Atg8 fluorescence (Fig. 3b), which corresponded to the dark 
inclusions but not the apicoplast (Supplementary Fig. 8). Mutation of the lipidation site on 
Atg8 (Atg8G124A) in PΔcpl parasites caused diffuse cytosolic fluorescence, indicating that 
the inclusions are decorated with lipid anchored, active form of Atg8 (Fig. 3c). This finding 
was confirmed by western blotting for Atg8, which showed accumulation of the lipidated 
Atg8-phosphatidyl serine (Atg8-PE) form in PΔcpl and Pru-LHVS bradyzoites, suggesting 
an arrest of autophagic flux (Fig. 3d). Taken together, these imply that autophagosomes 
develop in WT cysts, but become much more pronounced in the absence of CPL activity. 
Cysts treated with LHVS developed autophagosomes containing CPL, indicating a defect in 
degradation of autophaged material (Fig. 3e). In some cases CPL occupied a rim around the 
autophagosome, suggesting recent fusion of the autophagosome and VAC (Fig. 3e). 
Transmission electron microscopy revealed electron dense inclusions in LHVS treated Pru 
bradyzoites that appeared to contain undigested material including putative organellar 
remnants (Fig. 3f).
Similar to Pru strain, autophagosome accumulation in ME49 bradyzoites was strictly 
dependent on the absence of CPL expression (Supplementary Fig. 9). ME49 CPL deficient 
bradyzoites also displayed remnants of organelles including ER within autophagosomes 
(Fig. 4a), which showed a time dependent increase in size following differentiation (Fig. 4b). 
WT ME49 bradyzoites presented similar VAC intraluminal structures that were more 
prominent in day 7 bradyzoites, suggesting active turnover of autophagic structures after 
differentiation. Whereas WT ME49 cysts appeared healthy on both day 4 and day 7, some

 day 7 MΔcpl cysts contained degenerate bradyzoites with compromised integrity 
(Supplementary Fig. 10), consistent with a critical function for CPL in bradyzoite viability.
In summary, we show that VAC proteolytic function is required for Toxoplasma persistence 
in culture and in infected mice. We also find that blocking CPL activity causes accumulation 
of material including organellar remnants in the VAC prior to cyst death, indicating a key 
role for turnover of autophagosomes during Toxoplasma persistence. Whereas previous 
studies of autophagy in T. gondii depended upon induction via drug treatment or starvation 
conditions15, 16, our work suggests an intrinsic role for autophagy in bradyzoites without 
specific treatment. Autophagy following encystation could be required to renew organelles 
for the chronic stage or it might reflect a stringent response if the cyst wall physically limits 
resource acquisition from the host. Although the cyst wall is permeable to LHVS, this 
inhibitor does not cross the blood brain barrier17. Priority will be given to identifying CNS 
penetrant inhibitors of CPL to potentially abate Toxoplasma persistence.
METHODS
Host cells and parasite cultures
Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were not specifically authenticated, but the cultures were 
derived from low pass cryostocs (ATCC CRL-1634) every 3 months and maintained in 
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum 
(D10 media). T. gondii strains PruΔku80, ME49 and their mutants were propagated in vitro 
by serial passage on monolayers of HFF18. In vitro tachyzoite-to-bradyzoite conversion was 
induced by exposing parasite cultures to pH 8.2, as described previously19. Morpholine 
urea-leucyl-homophenyl-vinyl sulfone phenyl (LHVS) treatment of parasites was performed 
by daily replacement of media containing 1 μM LHVS diluted from a 1 mM stock in 
DMSO. HFF cells and parasite strains were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination.
Generation of transgenic T. gondii strains
PruΔku80LUC (herein termed Pru) and PruΔku80LUCΔcpl (herein PΔcpl) strains used to 
generate additional transformants in this study are based on PruΔku808 and have been 
described previously10. CPL complement strains PΔcpl:c/CPL and PΔcpl:c/CPL* 
(catalytically inactive C31A mutant) where generated using vectors described in Dou et al.6 
modified by replacing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) cDNA with that 
encoding bleomycin resistance (BLE). To target the complementation plasmids to the Ku80 
locus by single cross-over homologous recombination, we cloned into BamHI and SacI 
restriction sites 3′ to BLE a 1664 bp PCR fragment encompassing the nucleotide sequence 
2753961-2752298 of ME49 chromosome XI (primers ku80 Fw1/ku80 Rv1). These vectors 
were linearized with NdeI in the middle of the Ku80 fragment and integrated in the PruΔcpl 
strain, as shown Supplementary Fig. 1b. Stage specific complement strains PΔcpl:s/CPL and 
PΔcpl:b/CPL were created by replacing the CPL promoter in the CPL complement vector 
with that of SAG1 (sequence from -1185 to -1) or BAG1 (sequence from -1232 to -1) for 
expression exclusively in tachyzoites or bradyzoites, respectively20. SAG1/CPL and 
BAG1/CPL vectors were linearized with XbaI or BclI, respectively for non-disruptive single

 crossover integration into the SAG1 or BAG1 locus of PruΔcpl, as shown in Supplementary 
Fig. 1c, d.
ME49Δcpl (herein MΔcpl) was created using a CRISPR/Cas9 double cut strategy described 
by Long et al.21 whereby the first gRNA sequence (gRNA1) was targeted close to the CPL 
initiation codon and the second gRNA (gRNA2) near the stop codon, as shown in 
Supplementary Fig. 7a. Co-transfection ME49 with this sgRNA CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid (40 
μg) and a PCR amplicon consisting of BLE flanked by CPL-homology arms (~3000 bp) (10 
μg) successfully resulted in cpl deletion. MΔcpl:c/CPL, MΔcpl:s/CPL and MΔcpl:b/CPL 
complement strains were generated by random integration of the same vectors used for the 
Pru strains except that BLE was replaced with a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) cDNA 
conferring resistance to pyrimethamine.
Pru strains expressing tdTomato-ATG8 or a tdTomato-ATG8G124A lipidation mutant were 
generated by modifying the pTub-tdTomato-TgATG8-CAT plasmid described in Leveque et 
al.13 via replacement of CAT with BLE and cloning in a larger tubulin promoter fragment 
encompassing -2730 to -1 relative to the tubulin start codon. Plasmids were linearized with 
NarI at -1318 for single crossover integration into the tubulin locus. The tdTomato-ATG8 
expression cassette was also introduced into ME49 and MΔcpl strains by random integration 
and chloramphenicol selection.
T. gondii transfections were performed as described previously in Lunghi et al.22. Correct 
integration was identified by PCR analysis of single clones using Phire tissue direct PCR 
Master kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence
Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were performed as described previously23, 24. For 
immunoblotting, mouse α-CPL9 and rabbit α-actin25 antibodies were diluted 1:5000 and 
1:10000, respectively. For immunofluorescence, rabbit α-CPL and mouse α-CPB6 were 
diluted 1:500 and 1:250, respectively. Autophagosomes were stained using a cytoID® 
Autophagy Detection Kit 2.0 (ENZO) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Analysis of VAC size
Syringe released tachyzoites were allowed to invade HFF cells for 2 h at 37°C followed 
washing with PBS. Newly invaded parasites were again syringe released and affixed to 
slides coated with Cell-Tak™ (Corning), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained with 
mouse α-CPB to identify the VAC. Images were acquired by focusing on the VAC signal in 
the maximum number of parasites within a field of view and captured on a Zeiss Axiovert 
Observer Z1 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a 100X and an AxioCAM 
MRm camera and processed using Zeiss Axiovision 4.3 software. For Pru, PΔcpl, PΔcpl:c/
CPL, and PΔcpl:c/CPL strains VAC size was measured with Zeiss Axiovision 4.3 software 
by defining the area of α-CPB immunofluorescence. VAC measurements were only 
performed on VACs that were within focus. Equal parameters for the capture and 
enumeration of images were consistently applied to all samples. We cannot rule out that 
fixation differentially affected VAC size for the different strains assessed in the study.

 Bradyzoite conversion, viability, and analysis of dark inclusions
Bradyzoite conversion was assessed by counting vacuoles. Vacuoles displaying more than 
50% of parasites stained by the rabbit ααBAG1 antibodies were considered positive. HFF 
monolayers grown onto coverslips were infected with mechanically extruded tachyzoites for 
16 h and then the media were replaced with the alkaline media to induce bradyzoite 
conversion. At least 200 parasite vacuoles were counted in two independent experiments for 
each time point.
Loss of bradyzoite viability was measured by counting GFP positive versus GFP negative 
cysts at different time points of conversion. Samples were blinded. Infected HFF monolayers 
were cultivated in alkaline media for 1, 2 or 3 weeks and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 
for 20 min and at least 100 cysts were assessed for GFP positivity under fluorescence 
microscope.
Viability of bradyzoites was assessed by combining plaque assay and qPCR analysis of 
genome number. In vitro cysts were generated by maintaining infected HFF in alkaline 
media in six-well plates. After selected times, infected monolayers were washed 3 times 
with HBSS and cysts contained in one well were mechanically extruded from the HFFs by 
syringing several times through 26G needles. Released cysts were centrifuged at 1500g for 
10 min at RT and resuspended in 500 μl of HBSS. Then, 500 μl of pre-warmed 2X pepsin 
solution (0.026% Pepsin in 170 mM NaCl and 60 mM HCl, final concentration) was added 
and the sample was incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Reactions were stopped by adding 94 mM 
Na2CO3, removing the supernatant after centrifugation at 1500g for 10 min at RT and 
resuspending pepsin treated parasites in 1 ml of DMEM without serum. After calculating 
number of parasites per ml, 100 or 500 parasites per well were added to six-well plates 
containing confluent monolayers of HFFs in D10 media. Parasites were grown undisturbed 
for 12 days and plaque assays were performed by ethanol fixation for 2 min, staining with 
0.2% crystal violet for 5 min and followed by several washes with double-distilled H2O. 
Images of the wells were scanned, and plaque number and size were analyzed with ImageJ. 
Seven hundreds μl of the initial 1 ml of pepsin treated parasites were used for gDNA 
purification using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was eluted in a 
final volume of 100 μl and 8 μl was analyzed by qPCR using the tubulin primers TUB2.RT.F 
and TUB2.RT.R to determine the number of parasite genomes per μl. qPCR analyses were 
performed using Brilliant II SYBR green QPCR Master Mix (Agilent) and the Stratagene 
Mx3000PQ-PCR machine.
To quantify dark inclusions in bradyzoites, images of in vitro differentiated cysts were taken 
using a Zeiss Axio inverted microscope equipped with an Axiocam MRM CCD camera 
using a 100X oil objective. ImageJ was used to identify cysts by Max Entropy thresholding 
on the GFP channel followed by selection of objects between 130–1900 square microns. 
Particles (puncta) under the GFP mask were further analyzed by automatic local 
thresholding on the phase image using the Phansalkar method with the following 
parameters: radius = 5 μm; k-value = 0.5; r-value = 0.5. Dark inclusions (puncta) were 
measured from the resulting binary mask by particle analysis according to the following: 
size = 0.18–2.00 μm; circularity = 0.50–1.00. These parameters were chosen based on

 accuracy in a head-to-head comparison against manual counting. A total of 10,013 puncta 
were analyzed from 668 cysts.
Assessment of Atg8 lipidation
Parasites grown in HFF cells were converted to bradyzoites in alkaline medium for 5 days 
and treated with 1 μM LHVS in conversion medium for an additional 2 days. Bradyzoites 
were isolated by scraping and syringing infected monolayers several times through a 26G 
needle and subsequent pepsin treatment for 30 min at 37°C to release bradyzoites and 
selectively kill tachyzoites. Parasite pellets were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and 
lysates corresponding to 3×106 parasites per lane were separated in 15% SDS-PAGE gels 
containing 6 M urea, transferred to PVDF membranes and incubated with affinity purified 
rabbit α-TgATG8 (diluted 1:500; kindly provided by William Sullivan Jr). Blots were then 
incubated with an anti-rabbit HRP antibody and immunoreactive bands were visualized with 
the West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and exposure to film. Blots 
were then stripped and reprobed with rabbit α-BAG1 (1:5000)26 as a loading control and to 
assess bradyzoite conversion.
Electron microscopy of in vitro cysts
HFF monolayers grown in six-well plates were infected with 5×104 tachyzoites in D10 
media. After 16 h D10 media were replaced with alkaline media (pH 8.2) to induce 
bradyzoite conversion. In vitro cysts were processed for electron microscopy (EM) analysis 
either 4- or 7-days post bradyzoite conversion. EM Preparation of samples was carried out 
by washing the infected monolayers with cold PBS 3 times followed by fixation with 2.5% 
glutaraldehyde (EMS, catalog number 16210) in 0.1 M sodium buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 hour at 
RT. After fixation, infected cells were gently scraped to detach large sheets, centrifuged at 
3000 rpm for 10 min and washed 3 times with 0.1 M cacodylate (pH 7.4) buffer and stored 
in the same buffer at 4°C until processed for EM as described27 before examination with a 
Philips CM120 Electron Microscope (Eindhoven, the Netherlands) under 80-kV. 
Quantitative morphometric analysis of VAC from 25 to 32 representative electron 
micrographs from each group (ME49, MΔcpl and MΔcpl:CPL) we performed at low 
magnification to ensure the entire parasite fit into the field of view and could be analyzed as 
described28 by using the standard formula for randomly orientated cell and structures.
Competition assay with LHVS
Brains containing ME49 cysts were harvested from infected mice and homogenized in 1 ml 
of 1X PBS by sequential syringing through 19G and 23G. Homogenized brain material were 
then incubated for 30 min with either 200 nM BODIPY-LHVS (BO-LHVS) alone or a 1:1 or 
1:10 mixture of BO-LHVS and LHVS. After three washes with 1X PBS, brain material was 
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with rabbit anti-TgCPL antibodies at a 1:200 
dilution followed by Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies. Stained brain 
material was then allowed to adhere on slides coated with Cell-tak adhesive (Corning). 
Images were captured with a Zeiss Axiovert Observer Z1 inverted fluorescence microscope 
and an AxioCAM MRm camera and processed using Zeiss Axiovision 4.3 software.

 Mouse studies
Seven-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River) were randomly assigned to groups 
and infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 105, 106 or 107 tachyzoites of WT or transgenic 
PruΔku80 strains (type II genotype). Group sizes and number of experiments are as follows: 
Pru 105, 25 mice total, 4 experiments; Pru 106, 20 mice total, 3 experiments; Pru 107, 5 mice 
total, 1 experiment; PΔcpl 105, 10 mice total, 1 experiment; PΔcpl 106, 5 mice/group, 1 
experiment; PΔcpl 107, 20 mice total, 3 experiments. Mice were humanely euthanized 4 
weeks post-infection. Assessing statistical differences in cyst burden between mice infected 
with Pru and PruΔcpl was complicated by the absence of cyst data from the mice that did not 
survive the infection. Since mice that die from the infection often have higher burden and 
they become moribund and must be euthanized before the 4 weeks when cysts are counted, 
enumeration of cysts from those that survive probably underestimates differences. 
Accordingly, statistically analysis was provided. WT or genetically manipulated ME49 
strains were injected with 500 tachyzoites i.p. in 7-week-old female CBA/J mice (Jackson 
Laboratory). Data were pooled from two experiments with 13 mice per group in experiment 
1 and 7 mice per group in experiment 2. Mice infected with ME49 strains were euthanized 
humanely at 5 or 16 weeks post infection. The mouse brains were placed in 1 ml sterile PBS 
and individually minced with scissors, vortexed, and homogenized by three or four passages 
through a 22-G needle and syringe. Two 100 μl brain samples (200 μl total) from mice 
infected with PruΔku80 strains were placed on a glass microscope slide and then mounted 
on a coverslip. Cysts were enumerated without knowledge of the sample’s treatment group 
under an inverted fluorescence phase-contrast microscope by exploiting fluorescence 
emitted by GFP expressed under the control of the bradyzoite specific LDH2 promoter3. 
Three 10-μl samples (30 μl total) of brain homogenates from mice infected with ME49 
strains were instead analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy to enumerate cysts. Sample 
sizes were chosen based on previous studies. Mice were randomly assigned to groups and 
samples were blinded for enumeration of cysts. Animal studies described herein adhere to a 
protocol was approved by the Committee on the Use and Care of Animals of the University 
of Michigan.
Bioluminescence imaging
Seven-week old female albino C57B/6 mice (4 per strain, based on investigator experience) 
were IP injected with 106 Pru or 4×106 PruΔcpl parasites, which constituted equal 
inoculation of infectious parasites based on plaque assays. Bioluminescence was assessed as 
described10. Briefly, images were taken at 1 at 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 days post-infection using a 
Xenogen IVIS200 system 10 min after IP injected with 200 μl of 40 mg/ml D-luciferin in 
PBS. Mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane during imaging. The intensities of 
bioluminescence signals were quantified using LiveImage software coupled with the 
Xenogen IVIS200. All 4 mice in both groups were alive for imaging on day 6 and 3 mice in 
both groups were imaged on day 7. One Pru infected mouse and with 3 PΔcpl infected mice 
were imaged on day 8 when the experiment was terminated.

 Quantitative PCR
Brains of infected and uninfected control mice were dissected, weighed, and immediately 
stored at -20°C. Tissue was later thawed, and 25 mg of tissue per sample was homogenized 
with a pestle in 1X PBS and then passaging 4-5 times through a 22-gauge needle. Genomic 
DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit. To create a standard 
curve, known numbers of cultured tachyzoites were spiked into 25 mg of homogenized brain 
tissue from age matched uninfected mice at concentrations of 10−1, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 
and 105 tachyzoites per mg of brain tissue. Fifty nanograms of DNA from each sample were 
used to run quantitative real-time PCR using primers against a Toxoplasma specific 529 bp 
repeat element29 (Tox-9 Forward, 5′ AGGAGAGATATCAGGACTGTAG, Tox-11 Reverse 
5′ GCGTCGTCTCGTCTAGATCG). Treated and control sample CT values were compared 
against the standard curve to extrapolate the number of Toxoplasma genomes per brain. All 
samples were run in biological and technical triplicate. Samples with a CT value at or above 
40 were considered to have undetectable amplification, and were set to zero Toxoplasma 
genomes/brain.
Cytokine analysis
Seven-week-old female C57B/6 mice injected with 106 Pru or 4×106 PruΔcpl parasites were 
euthanized by CO2 fixation at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, and 21 days post-infection. Uninfected 
controls were euthanized at 1, 6, 14, and 21 DPI to be used as baseline controls. Blood was 
collected by cardiac puncture and serum separated by centrifugation. Levels of cytokines 
(IFNγ, IL-10, and TNFα) were assessed by capture ELISA. Data was analyzed and graphed 
in GraphPad Prism 6.

 Figure 2. VAC proteolytic function is required for Toxoplasma persistence in infected mice
a, Burden of brain cysts in Pru and PruΔcpl infected C57BL/6 mice. Mice were infected 
with the indicated inoculum for 4 weeks, humanely euthanized and cysts were enumerated 
microscopically in brain homogenates. Each data point indicates cyst burden in one mouse. 
Data are mean ± SEM of data pooled from: Pru 105, 4 experiments; Pru 106, 3 experiments; 
Pru 107, 1 experiment; PΔcpl 105, 1 experiment; PΔcpl 106, 1 experiment; PΔcpl 107, 3 
experiments. All of the mice in the Pru 107 group succumbed to the infection during the 
acute stage, as indicated by a cross. The number of mice that survived 4 weeks is indicated 
along with the total number of mice in each group. b, Parasite burden throughout the body of 
infected mice. C57BL/6 mice (4 per group) were infected intraperitoneally with 106 
tachyzoites. Total body parasite burden was determined by bioluminescence imaging and 
measurement of light flux (photons/second) from parasites expressing firefly luciferase. 
Data are mean ± SEM from one experiment. c, Mice were infected as in panel b and parasite 
burden in the brain was measured by qPCR. Data are mean ± SEM from one experiment. A 
cross indicates that Pru infected mice succumbed to the infection prior to imaging on day 10.

 Figure 4. CPL deficient bradyzoites develop undigested autophagosomes containing organellar 
remnants
a, Electron microscopy of intracellular ME49, MΔcpl and MΔcpl:CPL comparing the 
morphology of VAC (arrowheads) at day 4 showing electron density for this compartment in 
MΔcpl bradyzoites. High magnification views at day 7 reveal cytosolic material (asterisks) 
resembling piecemeal of the cytoplasm (ME49) and ER (MΔcpl), suggestive of autophagy 
activities occurring in the VAC with delayed degradation in the mutant reflected by electron 
dense luminal content. Scale bars, 500 nm. b. Volume fraction of VAC from representative 
electron micrographs of parasitophorous vacuoles (PV) from each group (29 and 25 PV for 
ME49 at d4 and d7, respectively; 30 and 32 PV of MΔcpl at d4 and d7, respectively; and 25 
PV for MΔcpl:CPL at d4) showing significant increase of this compartment in parasites 
lacking CPL compared to control strains. Volume fraction equals the area of the organelle 
divided by the area of the cell multiplied by 100. Bars indicate mean ± SD. *p<0.005
