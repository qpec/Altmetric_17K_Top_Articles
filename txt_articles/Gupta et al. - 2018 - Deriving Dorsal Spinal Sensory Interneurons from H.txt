SUMMARY
Cellular replacement therapies for neurological conditions use human embryonic stem cell (hESC)- or induced pluripotent stem cell
(hiPSC)-derived neurons to replace damaged or diseased populations of neurons. For the spinal cord, significant progress has been
made generating the in-vitro-derived motor neurons required to restore coordinated movement. However, there is as yet no protocol
to generate in-vitro-derived sensory interneurons (INs), which permit perception of the environment. Here, we report on the develop-
ment of a directed differentiation protocol to derive sensory INs for both hESCs and hiPSCs. Two developmentally relevant factors,
retinoic acid in combination with bone morphogenetic protein 4, can be used to generate three classes of sensory INs: the proprio-
ceptive dI1s, the dI2s, and mechanosensory dI3s. Critical to this protocol is the competence state of the neural progenitors, which
changes over time. This protocol will facilitate developing cellular replacement therapies to reestablish sensory connections in injured
patients.
INTRODUCTION
The somatosensory system mediates the perception of
touch
(mechanosensation),
pain
(nociception),
heat
(thermosensation), and the position of the body in space
(proprioception). These modalities enable us to perceive
and react to the environment; they are thus essential for
both well-being and survival. Somatosensory information
is received peripherally, and then decoded centrally by
interneurons (INs) in the dorsal spinal cord (Butler and
Bronner, 2015), which relay sensory information to
higher-order centers in the brain, including motor sys-
tems in the brainstem and cerebellum (Bermingham
et al., 2001), as well as to motor output from the spinal
cord.
Distinct
classes
of
sensory
INs
arise
during
embryonic development: they are classified as dorsal
interneuron (dI)1 to dI6s. These neurons have different
functional modalities, and arise via distinct develop-
mental programs in different positions in the spinal
cord (Lai et al., 2016). For example, the dI1s mediate pro-
prioception (Yuengert et al., 2015). They are born from
the dorsally located ATOH1+ (Math1) neural progenitors
(Helms and Johnson, 1998), and migrate to deeper posi-
tion in laminae V-VII of the adult spinal cord upon matu-
ration (Lai et al., 2016). Similarly, the dI2s and dI3s are
derived from the NGN1+ and ASC1+ (Mash1) progenitors,
respectively (Helms et al., 2005), and settle in distinct
layers of the mature spinal cord. The dI3s mediate
touch-activated motor behaviors (Bui et al., 2013), while
the functions of the dI2s are currently unknown.
Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) can affect both sensory and
motor systems and are debilitating emotionally and physi-
cally. SCIs are estimated to affect over 1 million people
in the US, reducing their quality of life and costing
�$40 billion annually in health care (Armour et al.,
2016). SCIs were considered intractable until pluripotent
stem cells emerged as a remarkable reagent for understand-
ing disease mechanisms, serving as a platform for drug
screening, and providing a source of tissue for cellular
replacement therapies. Important milestones toward treat-
ing SCIs have been the establishment of protocols to derive
spinal motor neurons (MNs) from mouse (m) and human
(h) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Li et al., 2005; Wichterle
et al., 2002) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
(Dimos et al., 2008; Karumbayaram et al., 2009). Stem
cell-derived MNs have provided an important window
into understanding of the pathology of motor diseases,
such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Sances et al., 2016)
and spinal muscular atrophy (Ebert et al., 2009), as well
permitting cellular replacement in injury models (Harper
et al., 2004; Thomsen et al., 2014). While these advances
raise the possibility of repairing motor functions in SCI
patients, relatively little attention has been given to the re-
covery of sensory circuits that enable the patient to inter-
pret their sensory environment and modulate motor
output. In particular, no directed differentiation protocol

 currently exists to generate sensory spinal INs from human
pluripotent stem cells, the critical first step toward recov-
ering somatosensation in SCI patients.
Toward this goal, we have developed a directed differ-
entiation protocol that generates three key populations
of dorsal sensory INs: the dI1s, dI2s, and dI3s. This
protocol co-opts the developmental mechanisms that
first establish these neurons in the embryonic dorsal
spinal cord. The spinal cord is derived from the posterior
neuroectoderm as a result of both posteriorizing signals,
such as retinoic acid (RA) (Diez del Corral et al., 2003;
Molotkova et al., 2005), and regional identity cues,
provided by the HOX genes (Forlani et al., 2003). The
dorsal-most spinal cord is patterned most notably by
the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, secreted
by the roof plate (RP) at the dorsal midline (Andrews
et al., 2017; Hazen et al., 2012; Le Dreau and Marti,
2013; Liem et al., 1997; Yamauchi et al., 2008). RP-
derived BMPs direct dorsal spinal progenitors toward
three populations of dorsal sensory INs; the LHX2+ dI1s
(Liem et al., 1997), LHX1/5+ PAX2- dI2s (Caspary and
Anderson,
2003), and Isl1/2+ TXL3+ dI3s (Tsuchida
et al., 1994). These neuronal populations fail to develop
in mice lacking key type I BMP receptors (Wine-Lee
et al., 2004) or if the RP is ablated in vivo (Lee et al., 2000).
This
developmental
paradigm
suggested
that
the
combinatorial action of RA and BMP4 will caudalize
and dorsalize hESC-derived neural progenitors toward
dorsal sensory INs, in a manner analogous to the proto-
cols for generating stem cell-derived spinal MNs. How-
ever, dorsal sensory INs develop over a different timeline
than MNs (Andrews et al., 2017; Le Dreau and Marti,
2012) and it has remained unresolved whether hESC-
derived spinal progenitors are equally competent to give
rise to MNs and INs. We thus first characterized cell fate
transitions during the early stages of hESC neuralization
to determine the optimal time point to add BMP4. We
thereby demonstrated that BMP4 directs hESCs toward
dI1 and dI3 fates within a temporally restricted window
that is different than that for spinal MNs. Unexpectedly,
dI2s are observed in the RA control conditions and are
suppressed after BMP4 addition. We further show that
hESC-derived sensory INs express mature axonal markers
of the spinal cord, suggesting they functionally mirror
their endogenous counterparts. Finally, we established
that this protocol directs human iPSCs to differentiate
into dI1 and dI3s with comparable efficiency with hESCs.
Thus, these two types of pluripotent stem cells can follow
a similar developmental program to generate sensory INs.
Taken together, this study paves the way for further
understanding of the diseases of somatosensory system
and designing cellular replacement therapies to regain
somatosensation in SCI patients.
RESULTS
Characterizing the Timeline by which hESCs Lose
Pluripotency and Enter the Neurogenic Lineage
We sought to generate in-vitro-derived dorsal spinal sensory
INs by modifying the protocol used to generate spinal MNs
(Wichterle and Peljto, 2008). In brief, this protocol directs
hESCs toward MN fates in three steps: hESCs are first
culturedinaneuraldifferentiationmedium(SaNDmedium)
(Sareenetal.,2013),todirectthemtowarda neurogenicline-
age. Second, hESCs are caudalized by the addition of RA (Fig-
ure 1A). Third, they are ventralized by the addition of a sonic
hedgehog signaling agonist, such as purmorphamine, to
specify spinal MN identity. We hypothesized that adding
BMP4 protein,instead ofpurmorphamine, to thecaudalized
hESCs would generate BMP-dependent dorsal sensory INs,
given the role of the BMPs directing dorsal spinal fate
(Andrews et al., 2017; Liem et al., 1997). However, dorsal
sensory INs develop along a different timeline from ventral
MNsin vivo (Andrews et al., 2017; Le DreauandMarti, 2012).
Thus, we first assessed the timing by which hESCs enter the
neurogenicandspinalprogenitorprogram,todeterminethe
optimal day on which to add growth factors.
We assessed when hESCs lose pluripotency and enter
the neurogenic program by examining the expression
Figure 1. Timeline for the Onset of the Neurogenic Program in hESCs
(A) Timeline and methodological details of the differentiation protocol to derive dorsal spinal sensory INs from hESCs.
(B–G) hESCs were collected for IHC and RT-qPCR analyses at day 0, 2 (B and E), 4 (C and F), and 6 (D and G) using antibodies against
NANOG (red), PAX6 (green, B–D) SOX1 (green, E–G), SOX2 (blue, B–D), and DAPI (blue, E–G).
(H) hESCs rapidly exit the pluripotent state. The number of NANOG+ cells (p < 0.0001) and levels of NANOG transcript (O, p < 0.0001) decline
by day 2 (B0) and are undetectable by day 4 (C0 and D0).
(I and J) Concomitantly hESCs enter a neurogenic state: SOX2 transcript and SOX2 protein levels remain constant (I), while SOX1
mRNA (J, p < 0.005) and SOX1 protein (J, p < 0.0001) are induced by day 2. SOX1 expression starts to decline at day 4 (J), with the number
of SOX1+ cells decreasing at day 6. By day 6, the remaining SOX1+ cells are found clustered together (G). PAX6 starts to be expressed at day 4
(p < 0.01) (C%–D% and K).
Two biological replicates were performed, with at least five fields of cells quantified for every IHC condition. The number of cells is expressed
as a percentage of the total number of DAPI+ cells. Probability of similarity **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.0005. Scale bar, 100 mm.

 levels and distribution of NANOG, SOX2, PAX6, and
SOX1 during the first 6 days of two-dimensional culture
in SaND medium. NANOG is present specifically in undif-
ferentiated precursors (Mitsui et al., 2003), SOX2 labels
both pluripotent and neuroectodermal cells (Bylund
et al., 2003; Ellis et al., 2004; Graham et al., 2003), while
PAX6 and SOX1 are pan neuroectodermal markers (Pevny
et al., 1998; Walther and Gruss, 1991). The number of
NANOG+ cells (Figures 1B0–1D0 and 1H) and NANOG
mRNA levels (Figure 1H) decline rapidly by day 2 of the
protocol and are undetectable by day 4, suggesting hESCs
rapidly exit the pluripotent state (Figure 1A). In contrast,
the number of SOX2+ cells (Figures 1B00–1D00 and 1I) and
level of SOX2 transcript (Figure 1I) remained stable during
this 6-day period, indicating that hESCs start to upregulate
the neurogenic program by day 2. This hypothesis was
supported by the observation that PAX6 RNA
and
PAX6 protein are induced by day 4 and increase by day 6
(Figures 1B%–1D% and 1J). Similarly, SOX1 expression
initiated in hESCs by day 2 (Figures 1E–1G and 1K). How-
ever, SOX1 expression subsequently declines, with the
numbers of SOX1+ cells peaking at day 4, and an �5-fold
decrease in SOX1 mRNA by day 6 (Figure 1K). Together,
this analysis suggests that culturing hESCs in SaND
medium permits them to initiate neurogenesis. However,
this state is not sustained past day 6, suggesting that RA,
a pro-neuralization factor (Engberg et al., 2010; Tonge
and Andrews, 2010), should be added to the cultures at
this time point.
RA Directs hESCs toward Spinal Progenitors with
Mixed Identities
We next assessed the effect of adding RA at day 6 on neuro-
epithelial fates in the hESC cultures. hESCs were permitted
to form embryoid bodies (EBs) in SaND medium supple-
mented with 1 mM RA. The levels of both SOX1 and PAX6
mRNAs markedly increase, reaching a plateau by day 10
(i.e., after 4 days of RA exposure) (Figures 2B–2D). SOX2
mRNA and SOX2 protein levels also modestly increase
until day 12 but decline thereafter, suggesting an erosion
of the progenitor state (Figure 2E). The decline in SOX2
levels correlates with the onset of neuronal differentiation.
Tuj1, an antibody that labels neural processes (Menezes
and Luskin, 1994), starts to decorate human EBs (hEBs) at
day 10 and becomes robust by day 14 (Figure 2I), suggest-
ing that progenitors have begun to differentiate into
post-mitotic neurons.
We also determined the time frame over which RA in-
duces hEBs toward spinal progenitor fates by analyzing
HOX, PAX3, and OLIG2 expression. The HOX profile in-
dicates axial level (Philippidou and Dasen, 2013), PAX3
is broadly present in dorsal spinal progenitors (Mansouri
and Gruss, 1998), and OLIG2 marks the MN progenitor
(pMN) domain (Novitch et al., 2001). A 2-day exposure
to RA (day 8) was sufficient to induce HOXA5, with
robust numbers of HOXA5+ cells observed by day 10
(Figure 2G). There were markedly more modest levels of
HOXA9 and HOXA11, with no expression of either
HOXD11 or HOXA13 (Figures S1D and S1E), demon-
strating that the hEBs have generally adopted a rostral
cervical spinal identity. However, the EBs contain both
dorsal and ventral spinal progenitors: PAX3 mRNA and
PAX3 protein are present at high levels by day 8 (Fig-
ure 2F), while OLIG2 expression starts at day 10, but is
not robust until day 16, when many OLIG2+ cells are
also observed (Figure 2H). Thus, there are two phases of
RA action: an early phase (day 6–10) where RA induces
dorsal
spinal
progenitors,
and
a
later
phase
(after
day 12), when prolonged exposure to RA results in
ventral spinal progenitors and the onset of neuronal
differentiation.
BMP4 Induces hEBs toward Dorsal Sensory IN Fates
within a Specific Temporal Window
We next determined the consequence of adding BMP4 in
addition to RA to the hEB cultures. Previous studies
(Andrews et al., 2017; Chizhikov and Millen, 2004;
Le Dreau and Marti, 2013) have shown that BMP4 is suffi-
cient to direct ectopic Lhx2+ dI1, Lhx1/5+ Pax2- dI2 and
Isl1+ Tlx3+ dI3 cells in embryonic chicken spinal cords.
We verified that these markers of dorsal IN identity are
evolutionarily conserved in primates, by assessing the
distribution of Lhx2 and Isl1 in day 28 Rhesus macaque
embryos, a stage equivalent to embryonic (E) stage 11.5
Figure 2. Retinoic Acid Induces Dorsal Spinal Fate in the hESCs
(A) At day 6, the neuralized hESCs were dissociated and allowed to form EBs in SaND medium, supplemented with 1 mM RA. Samples were
taken at day 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 for IHC and RT-qPCR analysis to characterize the early effects of RA on EB identity.
(B–E) RA promotes neural identity: SOX1 (B and C) and PAX6 (B and D) expression increases markedly by day 12. SOX2 starts to decline by
day 12, suggesting the onset of neuronal differentiation (E).
(F–H) RA rapidly caudalizes EBs, resulting in a HOXA5+ spinal identity from day 10 (G). EBs also show mixed identities, RA promotes both
PAX3+ dorsal fates by day 8 (F) and OLIG2+ ventral fates by day 14 (H).
(I) Longer RA incubation induces neural differentiation, marked by Tuj1 expression in EBs (compare quantification on day 10 and day 12,
p < 0.009).
Two biological replicates were performed. Scale bar, 100 mm.

 mouse (Clark et al., 2017). Strikingly, the distribution of
Lhx2 and Isl1 were similar in primates and rodents (Figures
3B, 3C, 4A, and 4B).
We hypothesized that the addition of BMP4 to hEBs
exposed to a short period of RA (i.e., from day 6 to 10 before
either ventralization or neuronal differentiation) would be
the condition most likely to induce dorsal sensory INs.
BMP4 (10 ng/mL) was added to the RA-treated hEBs at
day 6, 8, 10, and 17 (Figure 3A). The hEBs were cultured
until day 36 and then analyzed for the distribution and
level of SOX2, pHISTONEH3, LHX2, LHX1/5, ISL1, and
PAX2. The EBs are still differentiating at day 36, with
1%–2% of the cells in mitosis (Figures S2A0–S2D0 and S2J),
and up to �50% of the cells in the EBs continuing to
express SOX2 (Figures S2A–S2D and S2I).
Consistent with our hypothesis, the addition of BMP4
on any day during the RA-early phase (i.e., BMP4-D6,
BMP4-D8, and BMP4-D10) resulted in an up to 3-fold in-
crease in the expression of LHX2 and a >2-fold increase in
the number of LHX2+ Tuj1+ dI1s (Figures 3E, 3F, 3H, and
3I, see Figures S3A–S3C for biological replicates) compared
with RA control (Figures 3D, 3H, and 3I). Measuring the
number of LHX2+/DAPI+ nuclei within EBs suggested an
average dI1 differentiation efficiency of �20% (Figure 3I,
summarized in Table S3). In contrast, there was no signifi-
cant increase in either LHX2 expression or the number of
LHX2+ Tuj1+ cells, when BMP4 was added during the RA-
late phase (i.e., BMP4-D17) (Figures 3G, 3H, and 3I).
Similarly, the addition of BMP4 to hEBs during the
RA-early phase led to 3-fold increased ISL1 expression and
up to 3-fold more ISL1+ Tuj1+ cells (Figures 4D, 4E, 4G,
and 4H, see Figures S3D–S3F for biological replicates)
compared with RA control (Figures 4C, 4G, and 4H). These
ISL1+ cells could be co-labeled with TLX3, which marks a
subset of dI3s (Muller et al., 2005) (Figures S4B, S4C, and
S4E–S4G), but not with HB9, a marker of spinal MNs (Arber
et al., 1999) (Figures S4D and S4H), verifying their identity
as dorsal dI3s. The average dI3 differentiation efficiency
is �15% (Figure 4H, Table S3). There was again no signifi-
cant increase in either ISL1 expression or the number of
ISL1+ Tuj1+ cells, when BMP4 was added during the RA-late
phase (Figures 4F, 4G, and 4H).
Surprisingly, we did not find a condition where the addi-
tion of RA + BMP4 was able to induce dI2s, as was observed
in chicken embryos in vivo (Andrews et al., 2017). Rather
we found that LHX1/5+ PAX2� dI2s are present in the RA
condition (Figures S2E and S2K–S2N), with an average
dI2 differentiation efficiency of �15% (Figure S2K and
Table S3). In contrast, BMP4 appears to suppress the dI2
fate: after the addition of RA + BMP4 there is a 10-fold
decrease in LHX1 or LHX5 expression and at least a 5-fold
decrease in the number of LHX1/5+ PAX2� cells (Figures
S2F, S2G, and S2K–S2N).
Taken together, these data suggest that neural progenitors
are most competent to generate BMP4-derived dorsal sen-
sory INs after a brief exposure to RA. Supporting this model,
we find that ATOH1 and ASCL1 expression is increased in
hEBs after early BMP4 addition (Figures 5D and 5E).
ATOH1 (also known as Math1) and ASCL1 (also known as
Mash1) expression defines the progenitor state for the
dI1s (i.e., the dorsal progenitor [dP] 1 domain) (Figure 5B
(Helms and Johnson, 1998)) and dI3s (i.e., dP3) (Figure 5C,
Helms et al., 2005), respectively. This competence window
has closed by 11 days (day 17) of RA treatment.
Differentiated hEBs Exhibit Mature Axonal Markers of
the Dorsal Spinal Cord
We next started to assess whether our directed differenti-
ation protocol generates dorsal INs with the relevant
functional characteristics, by analyzing day 36 hEBs for
the presence of ROBO3 and DCC. DCC (Keino-Masu
et al., 1996) and ROBO3 (Sabatier et al., 2004) are
transmembrane receptors required for the guidance of
spinal commissural axons. The presence of ROBO3 and
DCC in the spinal cord is evolutionarily conserved
between rodents and primates; however, there may be
Figure 3. BMP4 Directs hESCs toward Proprioceptive-dI1 Sensory Interneurons
(A) BMP4 was added to neuralized EBs at day 6 (BMP4-D6), 8 (BMP4-D8), 10 (BMP4-D10), or 17 (BMP4-D17). EBs were collected at day 36
for IHC and RT-qPCR analyses to characterize the effects of BMP4 on dorsal neural identity.
(B and C) Transverse sections of E11.5 mouse lumbar (B) and day 28 monkey thoracic (C) embryonic spinal cord labeled with antibodies
against b-III tubulin (red, Tuj1) and Lhx2 (green). The Lhx2+ Tuj1+proprioceptive dI1s originate in the dorsal-most spinal cord (B, box, B0).
(D–I) The addition of BMP4 at day 6 (E), 8 or 10 (F) resulted in elevated LHX2 expression (H) and significantly increased production of
LHX2+ Tuj+ dI1s (E00, F00, and I) compared with RA controls (D00 and I; probability similar to RA control: p = 0.25, BMP4-D6; p < 0.043,
BMP4-D8; p < 0.016, BMP4-D10); �20% of the BMP4-treated cells are LHX2+ (I). However, this effect is lost if BMP4 is added at day 17
(G, H, and I; probability similar to RA control, p = 0.20). There is no significance difference in LHX2 expression levels or numbers of LHX2+
Tuj+ dI1s among the BMP4-D6, BMP4-D8, and BMP4-D10 conditions (L, p = 0.77, BMP4-D6 versus BMP4-D8 versus BMP4-D10, one-way
ANOVA). Note that in the RA condition, not all LHX2+ cells are Tuj1+ (arrows, D00). The region in the white dashed box in (D)–(G) is shown at
higher magnification in (D0)–(G0) and (D00)–(G00).
Probability of similarity *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.0005. Six biological replicates were performed, with 20–25 EBs quantified. The number of cells
was normalized to the area of the EB and then scaled according to a unit area (10,000 mm2). Scale bar, 100 mm.

 species-specific differences. While both Dcc and Robo3 are
present broadly in axons crossing the ventral commissure
in E11.5 mouse embryos (Figures 6A and 6C), Dcc and
Robo3 have sparser distribution in day 28 monkey spinal
cords. Dcc is generally present on axons in the dorsal
spinal cord (arrows, Figure 6B0), while Robo3 is present
on the soma of neurons in the intermediate spinal cord
(arrows, Figure 6D0) as well as pioneering commissural
axons in the ventral spinal cord.
Both DCC and ROBO3 are present in RA control and
RA + BMP4-treated EBs by day 36. However, the DCC+
ROBO3low
expression
profile
in
the
BMP4-D6
and
BMP4-D10 hEBs (Figures 6F0, 6G0, 6J0, and 6K0) was
distinct from the DCC+ ROBO3high profile (Figures 6E0,
6H0, 6I0, and 6L0) observed in the RA control and BMP4-
D17 condition. These profiles are consistent with the
BMP4-D6 and BMP4-D10 conditions primarily inducing
the dorsal-most dI1 spinal identity, while the RA and
BMP4-D17 condition results in more intermediate dorsal
identities. Thus, these hESC-derived dorsal INs have the
expected complement of guidance receptors, consistent
with the hypothesis that they are maturing into func-
tional dorsal sensory neurons.
BMP4 Can Direct Human iPSCs toward dI1s and dI3s
Fates
Finally, we assessed whether our protocol can be used to
direct patient-derived iPSCs toward the dI1 and dI3 fates.
BMP4 was added to iPSCs at day 10, and EBs collected at
day 36. As observed for hESCs, we found a 4-fold increase
in LHX2 expression (Figure 7C) and a 2-fold increase in
the number of LHX2+ Tuj1+ dI1s (Figures 7B0 and 7D) in
the BMP4-D10 treated hEBs compared with RA control
(Figure 7A0). We also observed a 2.5-fold increase in ISL1
expression (Figure 7G) and a 2-fold increase in the num-
ber of ISL1+ Tuj1+ dI3s (Figures 7F0 and 7H) in the
BMP4-D10-treated hEBs compared with RA control (Fig-
ure 7E0). Side-by-side differentiation procedures suggested
that hESCs and iPSCs generated dI1 and dI3 sensory INs
to comparable extents (Figures 7C, 7D, 7G, and 7H).
Thus, this protocol is capable of deriving patient-specific
sensory IN populations.
DISCUSSION
Human PSC technologies can generate the unlimited sup-
ply of cells needed to facilitate both cellular replacement
therapies, and an understanding of the molecular details
underlying human diseases. To date, significant progress
has been made deriving spinal MNs from hESCs and iPSCs
that would permit the recovery of coordinated movement
(Harper et al., 2004; Miles et al., 2004; Wichterle et al.,
2002). However, to regain full function, a second critical
class of neurons is needed: the dorsal sensory INs that
integrate and relay somatosensory information from the
periphery to the brain. Here, we report on the development
of a robust protocol that permits the derivation of spinal
sensory INs from hESCs and hiPSCs by the sequential addi-
tion of RA ± BMP4.
Establishing the Timeline over which hESCs Are
Neuralized and Become Differentially Competent
We used the well-defined spinal MN-directed differentia-
tion protocol as our starting point in our studies, hypothe-
sizing that these hESC-derived neural progenitors are
competent to become multiple post-mitotic neuronal iden-
tities. We first characterized hESCs as they acquire neural
and spinal identity. The onset of hESC neuroectodermal
identity is marked by a rapid decline in pluripotency and
the upregulation of SOX1 and then PAX6 (Figure 1). This
temporal order is similar to that observed during mouse
neuroectodermal development (Pevny et al., 1998; Suter
et al., 2009), suggesting that we have recapitulated a devel-
opment program conserved between rodents and humans.
Previous hESC neuralization protocols have reported an
inverted temporal order of SOX1 and PAX6 expression as
hESCs neuralize (Gerrard et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2010).

(A and B) Transverse sections of E11.5 mouse lumbar (A) and day 28 Rhesus macaque thoracic (B) embryonic spinal cord labeled with
antibodies against b-III tubulin (red, Tuj1) and Isl1 (green). The Isl1+ Tuj1+ mechanosensory dI3 cells are present in the intermediate
spinal cord (A, box, A0).
(C–H) Addition of BMP4 at day 6 (D), 8 or 10 (E) resulted in elevated ISL1 expression (G) and significantly increased production of ISL1+
Tuj+ dI3s (arrowheads, D00, E00, quantified in H) compared with RA controls (C00 and H; probability similar to RA control: p < 0.004, BMP4-D6;
p < 0.0001, BMP4-D8; p < 0.0008, BMP4-D10); �15% of the BMP4-treated cells are ISL1+ (H). However, this effect is lost when BMP4 is
added at day 17 (F00, G, and H, probability similar to RA control, p > 0.09). There is no significant difference in ISL1 levels or numbers of
ISL1+ Tuj+ dI3s in the BMP4-D6, BMP4-D8 and BMP4-D10 conditions (L, BMP4-D6 versus BMP4-D8 versus BMP4-D10, p > 0.37, one-way
ANOVA). Note that not all ISL1+ cells are Tuj1+ (dotted lines, D00, and E00). The region in the white dashed box in (C)–(F) is shown in higher
magnification in (C0)–(F0) and (C00)–(F00).

 This discrepancy may arise from the way in which neuroec-
todermal identity was achieved: the previous studies
used noggin to facilitate neuralization by blocking BMP
signaling, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to
maintain the proliferation capacity of the neural progeni-
tors. However, we neuralized hESCs using the B27/N2
supplements present in SaND medium, which may result
in hESCs initiating neurogenesis in a manner closer to
the endogenous process.
We found that RA should be added at day 6 to maintain a
stable SOX1+ PAX6+ neurectodermal identity. By day 12,
these cells had a HOX profile most consistent with a
HOXA5+ cervical spinal identity (Figure 2G), with a small
component from the HOXA9+ thoracic level (Figure S1).
There is little to no HOXD11 or HOXA13 expression
(Figures S1D and S1E), suggesting that the cells do not
have a lower lumbar-sacral identity. The HOX profile
may depend on the concentration and duration of RA
exposure, as well as the presence of other caudalizing
factors. Studies using a combination of RA and FGF2 have
generated spinal neurons with a more posterior HOX
gene profile (Li et al., 2005).
The Competence State of hESC-Derived Spinal
Progenitors Changes over Time
We assessed whether hESC-derived spinal progenitors are
simultaneously competent to give rise to either MNs or
INs, or whether the competence state changes over
time. We found that that the addition of RA induces
PAX3+ dorsal progenitors by day 8, while OLIG2+ ventral
progenitors arise later, by day 14. Consistent with the
hypothesis that progenitor competence state changes
over time, early RA-treated spinal progenitors are most
competent to give rise to dI1 and dI3s in response to
BMP4. This competence for dorsalization is lost by day
17, the day at which purmorphamine is typically added
to hESC-derived spinal progenitors to direct them toward
MN fates (Sareen et al., 2013). The molecular basis for
these different competence states remains unresolved.
Longer RA incubation may alter the transcriptome of
the hESCs-derived spinal progenitors, rendering them
unresponsive to BMP4.
Unexpectedly, we were unable to derive BMP4-depen-
dent dI2s; these cells were only observed in the RA
condition. In the developing spinal cord, BMP signaling
is both necessary and sufficient to specify the dI2 fate
(Andrews et al., 2017; Wine-Lee et al., 2004). However,
our recent experiments have suggested that dorsal pro-
genitors are not equivalently competent to respond to
BMP4 (Andrews et al., 2017). We have found that BMP4
is both a patterning and differentiation signal for dI1/
dI3s, able to specify dP1/dP3 progenitors and then reiter-
atively direct them to form dI1s and dI3s. In contrast,
BMP4 is specifically a differentiation cue for dI2s: it directs
Ngn2+
progenitors
to
differentiate
into
dI2s.
Taken
together, our studies suggest adding BMP4 to hESCs
directs them first toward a dP1/dP3 progenitor state; the
Figure 5. BMP4 Directs hESCs toward Dorsal Neural Progenitor
Identities
(A) To assess the acquisition of dorsal progenitor identity, EBs were
cultured for 12 days, with BMP4 added at day 6.
(B and C) In the mouse spinal cord (indicated by yellow dotted
lines, B and C), the dP1 and dP3-5 domains express Atoh1
(arrowheads, B) and Ascl1 (arrowheads, C), respectively, in the
E11.5 mouse embryo. The dP1 cells give rise to Lhx2+ dI1s while
Isl1+ dI3s emerge from the dP3-5 population.
(D and E) BMP4 addition increases ATOH1 levels by >2-fold
(D, probability of similarity with RA control, p < 0.038) and ASCL1
levels by >5-fold (E, p < 0.024).
Four biological replicates were performed. Scale bar, 100 mm.

 continued presence of BMP4 then acts as pro-dI1/dI3
signal. The dP2 progenitor state is suppressed, thereby
generating no BMP4-dependent dI2s. In contrast, adding
RA to hESCs appears to generate multiple dorsal progeni-
tor populations, which in turn results in mixed dorsal IN
identities, including some dI1s, the more robust produc-
tion of dI2s, as well as more intermediate dorsal INs,
such as dI4s (Table S3).
Future studies will identify the mechanism by which
BMP4 produces both dI1s and dI3s. Does BMP4 induce a
common dP1/dI3 progenitor state? Or do fluctuations in
BMP signaling specify distinct dP1 and dP3 populations?

lumbar (A and C) and day 28 monkey
thoracic (B and D) spinal cord labeled with
antibodies against Tuj1 (red), Dcc (green, A
and B), Robo3 (green, C and D) and DAPI
(blue). Dcc and Robo3 are broadly present
on mouse commissural (A0 and C0) axons. In
contrast, Robo3 is present in a sparser
population of monkey commissural axons
arising from neurons in the intermediate
spinal cord (arrowheads, D0). Dcc decorates
the axons of dorsally derived commissural
neurons (arrowheads, B0).
(E–H) Day 36 EBs treated with RA, RA +
BMP4-D6, RA + BMP4-D10 and RA + BMP4-
D17, were labeled with antibodies against
Tuj1 (red), DCC (green, E–H) and ROBO3
(green, I–L). Numerous DCC+ Tuj1+ and
ROBO3+ Tuj1+ axons were present in the
control and experimental EBs. The ROBO3
and DCC stainings are more extensive in the
RA control (E0 and I0) and BMP4-D17 EBs
(H0 and L0), compared with BMP4-D6 (F0 and
J0) and BMP4-D10 (G0 and K0) EBs, consis-
tent with these conditions generating cells
with distinct dorsal identities.

 We will also investigate how to deploy BMP signaling to
improve the efficiency by which spinal progenitors are
directed to become dI2s.
hESC-Derived Sensory INs May Functionally Mirror
Their Endogenous Counterparts
The addition of BMP4 to the hESCs cultures led to �35% of
the cells in an hEB becoming dI1s and dI3s (Table S3). To
start to address whether these neurons functionally
resemble their endogenous counterparts, we assessed
whether the hESC-derived human sensory INs express
DCC and ROBO3, the guidance receptors required for
growth of commissural axons toward the ventral midline
(Sabatier et al., 2004; Varadarajan et al., 2017). DCC is
present in hEBs at high levels as predicted from the distri-
bution of Dcc in both mouse and monkey. However, the
number of ROBO3+ neurons was lower than we anticipated
in the BMP4-directed hEBs compared with the RA control.
Mouse Robo3 is present at high levels on commissural neu-
rons and their axons throughout the dorsal and intermedi-
ate spinal cord (Sabatier et al., 2004; Varadarajan and
Butler, 2017; Varadarajan et al., 2017). However, monkey
Robo3 is primarily present on intermediate spinal neurons,
and that the pioneering commissural axons appear to stem
from this intermediate population (Figure 6D0). Thus, there
may be species-specific differences in the complement of
axonal guidance receptors present on dorsal neurons, and
the timing by which sensory circuitry is established. The
functional implications of this finding require further
studies; however, one possibility is that DCC+ ROBO3low
is the correct complement of axonal receptors for primate
dI1 neurons. An alternative hypothesis is that the presence
of BMP4 inhibits the maturation process of the spinal INs
thereby reducing the ROBO3 levels.
Figure 7. BMP4 Also Directs iPSCs toward
a dI1s and dI3 Identity
(A–H) Day 36 EBs, derived from iPSCs
treated with RA and RA + BMP4-D10, were
either processed for RT-qPCR or labeled with
antibodies against Tuj1 (red), LHX2 (green,
A and B), ISL1 (green, E and F), and DAPI
(blue).
(A–D) The BMP4-D10 condition resulted in a
significant increase in LHX2 mRNA and
number of LHX2+ Tuj1+ dI1s in both hESC-
derived EBs (C, probability similarity with
RA control p < 0.023; D, p < 0.0001) and
iPSC-derived EBs (C, p < 0.0096; B0 and D,
p < 0.0001) compared with RA control
(arrow, A0 and D).
(E–H) The BMP4-D10 condition also re-
sulted in a significant increase in ISL1
expression in hESCs-EBs (G, p < 0.016) and
iPSC-EBs (G, p < 0.04) and the number of
ISL1+ Tuj1+ dI3s (hESCs-EBs: H, p < 0.0005;
iPSC-EBs: F0 and H, p < 0.0022), compared
with RA control (E0, G, and H).

 In future studies, we will assess how closely the transcrip-
tomic and electrophysiological profiles of hESC-derived
sensory INs mirror neurons in vivo. Complicating this
analysis, these properties have not yet been well defined
for the endogenous sensory INs.
Clinical Implications of These Studies
For this protocol to be clinically relevant, it must also be
applicable to patient-derived iPSCs. Previous studies have
shown that differences in the epigenetic landscape can
result in iPSC lines having varied differentiation effi-
ciencies compared with hESCs (Hu et al., 2010). However,
we found no noticeable difference between an iPSC and
hESC line with respect to their ability to generate dI1s
and dI3s. Thus, our protocol is robust and can be used to
derive patient-specific sensory INs.
The present study completes the first step toward
functionally re-building damaged spinal cords, by re-
establishing the sensory connections that would allow
an injured patient to perceive external stimuli. In-vitro-
derived sensory INs can be used in drug testing platforms
targeting diseased sensory INs as well as investigating the
feasibility of using them in cellular replacement thera-
pies. The ability to generate spinal INs in vitro will also
accelerate studies examining the basis of debilitating
spinal dysfunctions, such as congenital pain insensitivity
and hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies
(Nagasako et al., 2003).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Human ESC and iPSC Culture and Differentiation
H9 hESCs and iPSCs were obtained from the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) stem cell core and iPSC core at
Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, respectively. Cells
were maintained on Geltrex (Thermo Fisher Scientific)-coated
plates in mTeSR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies) at 37�C
and in 5% CO2 humidified incubators. Neural differentiation
was initiated in two-dimensional culture by replacing mTeSR1
with SaND medium (IMDM + 2% B27-VitA + 1% N2 supplement;
Thermo Fisher Scientific) (Sareen et al., 2013) for 6 days. After
6 days, hESCs or iPSCs were treated with Accutase (STEMCELL
Technologies) for 2 min at 37�C, scraped off the plate using a
glass pipette (Fisher Scientific) and collected by centrifugation
at 1000 rpm in SaND medium. The cell pellet was resuspended
in SaND medium + 1 mM all-trans RA (Sigma-Aldrich) + ROCK in-
hibitors (BioPioneer; SM-008), and the cells were permitted to
form EBs in low-attachment 24-well plates (Corning). To induce
dorsal IN differentiation (Figure 1A), 10 ng/mL BMP4 recombi-
nant protein (Invitrogen, catalog no. PHC9534) was added at
different time points between day 6 and day 17 (Figure 3A). At
day 17, EBs were transferred to neural differentiation medium
(NBDM) (Sareen et al., 2013) supplemented with 1 mM RA+
10 ng/mL BMP4 for a further 8 days. To facilitate neuronal
maturation, EBs were grown in neural maturation medium,
consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s mediumyF12 and
supplemented with B27 (2%), RA (1 mM), BMP4 (10 ng/mL),
dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mM), ascorbic acid (200 ng/mL) until
day 36 (Sareen et al., 2013). Control EBs were grown in 1 mM
RA up until day 36.
Immunohistochemistry
Cells
Adherent hESC cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NC9658705) for 10 min at room
temperature, and then washed with 13 PBS. EBs were fixed with
4% PFA for 30 min on ice, washed with 13 PBS, cryopreserved in
a 30% sucrose solution, and thin sectioned to yield 12 mm sections.
All cells were blocked (1% heat-inactivated horse serum + 0.1%
Triton X-100 + 0.01% NaAz) for 1 hr and incubated with primary
antibodies (see Table S1) overnight at 4�C. Species-appropriate
cyanine 3, cyanine 5, and fluorescein-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used at
room temperature for 2 hr.
Tissue Sections
Mouse tissue was processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC) as
previously described (Varadarajan et al., 2017). Embryonic day
28 Rhesus macaque spinal cord was obtained through timed
matings following Animal Care and Use Committee Approval
(Clark et al., 2017). Embryos were fixed in 4% PFA, embedded in
paraffin blocks, then cut to obtain 5-mm-thick transverse sections.
For IHC staining, sections were deparaffinized and then rehydrated
through a xylen/ethanol gradient. Sections were processed for
immunohistochemistry as previously described (Clark et al.,
2017). An antigen retrieval step using Tris-EDTA (10 mM Tris
base, 1 mM EDTA solution, 0.05% Tween 20 [pH 9.0]) buffer at
95�C for 40 min was necessary. For nuclei staining, cells or sections
were incubated with DAPI (1:1,000) in 13 PBS for 5 min and
washed two times in 13 PBS. The sections were mounted in
ProLong Gold mounting media (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Imaging and Quantification
Images of adherent hESC cultures and EB sections were collected on
an LSM800 confocal microscope using Carl Zeiss Zen Blue and pro-
cessed using Adobe Photoshop CS6 software. The number of cells in
adherent cultures were counted using the NIH ImageJ particle
module, after modulating the intensity threshold in 8-bit images
to capture the fluorescent cells. For the hESC counts (Figure 1)
and differentiation efficiencies (Table S3), the number of cells is
expressed as a percentage of the total number of DAPI+ cells. For
the EB cell counts (Figures 3, 4, and 7), the number of cells is divided
by the area of the EB and then scaled according to a unit area
(10,000 mm2). Data points were pooled from multiple experiments.
Statistics
We performed each experiment 2–6 independent times (biological
replicate), with 2–3 technical replicates (qPCR or IHC) for each
biological replicate. Statistical analyses were performed using
either a two-tailed Student’s t test, if the data fit a normal distribu-
tion (Anderson-Darling test), or a Mann-Whitney test, if it did not.
All data are represented as means ± SEM.

 RNA Isolation and RT-qPCR Analysis
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy purification kit (QIAGEN,
catalog no. 74104). cDNA was synthesized using Superscript IV
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). RT-qPCR was always performed in
triplicate using SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche) on a Roche
RT-qPCR
machine
using
gene-specific
primers
(Table
S2).
Sequences for primer pairs for HoxA11 (primer ID-84105266c2)
and HoxA13 (primer ID-171906561c1) were obtained from
PrimerBank-MGH-PGA (Spandidos et al., 2008, 2010; Wang
and Seed, 2003). The Ct values for each gene were calculated
by averaging two runs for each condition. Expression of the
target gene was normalized with the expression of glyceralde-
hyde-3-phosphaste dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and fold change
was calculated using the 2�DDCt method. We observed the
same trends in all experiments, (i.e., the effect of RA versus
RA + BMP4 in different biological replicates was always reproduc-
ible). However, the magnitude of the fold change in gene
expression could vary markedly between biological replicates
(Figure S3). Thus, each RT-PCR graph is taken from one of the
biological replicates, and does not include statistics as required
by the journal.
Ethical Statement
All hESC procedures were approved by the Embryonic Stem
Cell Research Oversight committee at University of California,
Los Angeles (UCLA). Monkey and mouse spinal cord tissue were
obtained following approval from the UCLA Animal Care and
Use Committee.
