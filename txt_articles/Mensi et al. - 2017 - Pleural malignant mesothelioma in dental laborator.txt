Asbestos was used in dentistry as a binder in periodontal dressings and as lining material for
casting rings and crucible. However, until now, only one case of malignant mesothelioma with
occupational exposure to asbestos in dental practice has been reported. We present 4 pleural
mesotheliomas out of 5344 cases identified in Lombardy, Italy, in 2000-2014. Three men had
been working as dental laboratory technicians, with asbestos exposure for 10, 34, and 4 years,
and one woman had been helping her husband for 30 years in manufacturing dental prostheses.
The men described the use ofasbestos as alining material for casting rings,while the woman was
not able to confirm this use. We confirm the association of malignant mesothelioma with dental
technician work. Dental technicians suffering from mesothelioma should be questioned about
past occupational asbestos exposure.

| INTRODUCTION
Exposure to asbestos fibers is a risk factor in the development of
malignant mesothelioma (MM), a cancer arising from the serous
membranes of the pleura and, less frequently, of the peritoneal and
pericardial cavities and from the tunica vaginalis testis. Prognosis is
severe, and median survival for the pleural form is around 9 months
since diagnosis in population-based studies.1 Many western countries
are currently suffering a MM epidemic, considering the extensive use
of asbestos between the 1950s and the 1980s in several applications
and the long latency period (around 40 years on average) since the
beginning of exposure.
Due to the past use of asbestos-made lining material for casting
rings since approximately 1930 or as a binder in periodontal dressing
since 1967, dental technicians and dentists were potentially exposed
to asbestos.2–9 To our knowledge, only a few cases of pneumoconio-
sis, small opacities, or pleural plaques have been reported10–13 and
only one case of pleural MM with documented occupational exposure
to asbestos14 has been reported in the literature.
The aim of the manuscript is to describe cases of pleural MM in
dental laboratory technicians identified by the Lombardy Mesotheli-
oma Registry (RML), North-West Italy, in 2000-2014.

| METHODS
2.1 | The lombardy mesothelioma registry
Since the asbestos ban in 1992 Italy has been one of the most active
countries in prevention and control of asbestos-related diseases. A
dedicated system of epidemiological surveillance was implemented
through the National Mesothelioma Register (ReNaM), active since
1993 (by force of law since 2002) with the remit of estimating MM
incidence, investigating occurrences of asbestos exposure, identifying

 any possible underrated or unknown source of asbestos contamination
and promoting research.15 Being part of the ReNaM structure of
Regional Operating Centers (CORs), the RML, established in 2000,
collects all MM cases diagnosed in people living in Lombardy (one of the
most populated and industrialized regions in Italy, currently almost 10
millioninhabitants),evenifadmitted tohospitals outside Lombardy.16,17
The information concerning occupational and extra-occupational
history
is
collected
through
administration
of
a
standardized
questionnaire by trained interviewers to the patient or to his/her
next-of-kin. Detailed information on lifetime occupational history
(industry, occupation, work environment characteristics) and lifestyle
habits are collected, including information on cohabitants (father,
mother, spouse, other) with whom the patients have been living,
especially whether the cohabitant used to bring dirty working clothes
at home to be brushed or washed. Moreover, information about
domestic and leisure-time activities involving exposure through
asbestos-containing objects and environmental exposures during
lifetime residential history, presence of asbestos cement tiles or water-
tanks, of industrial plants nearby (ie, asbestos cement, petro-chemical,
railroad, or shipbuilding industries) is elicited. A panel of experts
classifies lifetime asbestos exposure as occupational, familial (ie,
related to the cohabitant), leisure-time (ie, related to activities
regarding the house), or environmental.18
For the purpose of this paper, we extracted from MM cases
diagnosed in the period 2000-2014 records of patients who had been
working in a dental laboratory and described their clinical and
occupational history.

| RESULTS
Four patients were found out of 5344 incident MM cases. All pleural
MM were histologically diagnosed (Table 1).
3.1 | Patient 1
The first patient was a 72-year-old man, evaluated for dyspnea in
May 2004. Chest X-ray revealed a right pleural effusion with
pulmonary atelectasis due to a mass obstructing the lower lobe
bronchus. After thoracentesis he underwent videothoracoscopy:
multiple lung, pleural, and diaphragmatic nodules of neoplastic
appearance were present. Histological and immunohistochemical
analysis provided the diagnosis of epithelial MM. Extensive surgical
treatment was performed by pleuropneumonectomy, excision of the
pericardium and of the right hemidiaphragm infiltration, removing the
peritoneal apex too. Pericardial and right hemidiaphragm reconstruc-
tion was performed. The patient underwent chemoradiotherapy. He
died 8.0 months after diagnosis.
3.1.1 | Occupational exposure
From 1953 to 1963 (from 21 to 31 years old) he worked as a dental
technician. His activity consisted in preheating one or two cylinders in
a dedicated oven for the subsequent metal wax model casting: placing
a positive tooth reproduction of wax in the cylinder and then in
another small oven heated by means of a platinum electric resistance.
Until 1957 the worker used cylinders with inner lining in refractory
material and insulated with asbestos; he made five or six castings every
week. For 6-8 years he had also been using asbestos gloves (never
replaced) when putting the cylinders inside the preheating oven and
then into the casting oven. The subject never used to do maintenance
and cleaning of the furnace. He used compressed air to clean products.
From 1964 to 1988 he worked as freelance dental technician using
closed-cycle casting machines.
3.1.2 | Non-occupational exposure
No other sources of asbestos exposure were identified.
3.1.3 | Analysis of asbestos bodies and fibers
Lung samples (from one lobe) were available to be analyzed. Asbestos
body and asbestos fiber burden were measured (number per grams of
dry weight of lung tissue [gdw]). Lung tissue was digested with
hypochlorite and analyzed with optical microscopy at 500 magnifica-
tion; asbestos fibers (length >1 μm) were counted by means of a
Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with X-ray fluorescence
microanalyses at 12 000 amplification. The asbestos body burden was
22 000/gdw (95% confidence interval (CI): 16,000-30,000, detection
limit 400/gdw). The asbestos fiber burden was below the detection
limit of 380,000/gdw.
3.2 | Patient 2
The second patient was a 61-year-old woman. The onset of the
symptoms was in June 2004, with left chest pain and pneumothorax.
After chest drainage, a CT-scan showed effusion and thickening of the
middle-lower right pleura. The patient underwent partial left pleural
excision aimed at histological sampling. Histological examination of
the left parietal and visceral pleura and of lower lobe lung parenchyma
showed a biphasic malignant mesothelioma. The patient underwent a
second operation with histological re-samples showing infiltrative
epithelial MM and then chemotherapy. She survived 4.3 years.
3.2.1 | Occupational exposure
From 1959 to 1961 (from 16 to 18 years old) she worked as a clerk in a
lawyer’s office. From 1961 to 1991 she worked as a housewife, but she
used to help her husband in the production of prostheses in his dental
laboratory. From 2001 to 2004 she worked as a clerk.
3.2.2 | Non-occupational exposure
The patient reported that at the end of the 1980s she helped her
husband in building a sound barrier at the boiler room, in order to
insulate a power unit: she held an asbestos-cement slab while her
husband drilled holes in it. She had been living from 1946 to 1964 with
her father—a dental technician working in his own laboratory.
3.3 | Patient 3
A 79-year-old man in 2013 was re-evaluated for transitional papillary
carcinoma of the bladder, first diagnosed in 2008. After being

 evaluated by positron emission tomography for recurrent right pleural
effusion, the patient underwent videothoracoscopy. Diffuse whitish
pleural thickening was observed and the lower right lung lobe visceral
pleura, the diaphragmatic pleura, and the anterior and posterior
mediastinal pleura were reported as flaking layers of fibrinous and
cerebriform tissue. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis
provided the diagnosis of epithelioid MM. Nine months later a CT-scan
reported vast pleural thickening and peritoneal carcinosis. He survived
11.3 months.
3.3.1 | Occupational exposure
From 1952 to 1956 (from 18 to 22 years old) he worked as a dental
technician. His activity consisted in the production of crowns, dental
bridges and prostheses in a dental laboratory. An electric oven for the
metal wax model casting was present. From 1957 to 1959 he was
inspector of radio-set valves, and from 1959 to 1999 employee in the
public administration.
3.3.2 | Non-occupational exposure
No definite asbestos exposures (he did some domestic electrical work)
were reported.
3.4 | Patient 4
A 70-year-old man was diagnosed in 2013 with hilar fibrosis in a
hospital admission for traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and
underwent resection of prostatic carcinoma, follow-up being regular.
In the following year he was evaluated for acute respiratory distress: a
CT-scan showed effusion of the right hemithorax without contrast
enhancement of the pleura. As the pleural liquid cytology revealed
hyperplastic atypical mesothelial cells suspect of mesothelioma, in
2014 he underwent videothoracoscopy. Ubiquitous pleural thickening
with multiple subtle nodules were sampled for histological and
immunohistochemical analysis, which revealed an epithelioid MM. He
died after 1.5 years.
3.4.1 | Occupational exposure
From 1960 to 1964 (from 16 to 20 years old) he attended a dental
technician laboratory school in Milan. He was a freelance dental
technician from 1965 to 1999, and stated that asbestos was cut from
large rolls kept in the laboratories and used for lining rings in wax
model casting prosthesis formation. He had been repeating the
process twice a week for 10 years.
3.4.2 | Non-occupational exposure
No other asbestos exposures were reported.

| DISCUSSION
We described four cases of pleural malignant mesothelioma associ-
ated with dental technician work who came to the attention of the
RML. They had all been exposed or possibly exposed to asbestos while
working as (or helping) dental laboratory technicians. For each subject
the diagnosis was confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry.
The first case described asbestos exposure during production of
prostheses based on wax model casting. Until 1957 he used casting rings
lined with asbestos and also stated that asbestos gloves were used for
6-8 years to insert the cylinders into the oven, and that compressed air
was used airto clean products. The fourth case reported cutting asbestos
from rolls kept in the laboratories for lining rings in wax model casting.
Choudat19 and Radi et al12 described the process of prosthesis
formation, based on wax model casting: a positive reproduction of the
tooth is made in wax; this pattern is placed in a cylinder, which is filled
with refractory material. The wax is eliminated by heating, leaving an
empty mould chamber. Molten alloy is injected into the mould which is
then broken and the prosthesis is polished with a sandblaster and hand
finishing tools. It is known from ReNaM Guidelines that asbestos had
been used, albeit in small quantities, by Italian dental technicians in the
lost wax model casting.18 In the second case we could only document
indirect exposure to asbestos while helping her husband for 30 years in
dental prosthesis manufacturing.
It is well documented that asbestos has been used in dentistry
since approximately 1930 when it was introduced as a lining material
for casting rings.2 Paper and powder containing asbestos fibers were
used, respectively, in the production of metal prostheses and as a
binder in periodontal dressing until the middle of 70’s.14 The above
mentioned procedures for prosthesis formation were the main
production method and therefore they could apply also to the third
patient, even if he reported a less detailed history. Since 1976 the
Council on Dental Therapeutics14 reported a hazard of exposure to
airborne fibers from asbestos used as binder and to line casting rings or
crucibles for casting machines, the fibers being readily released into
the air from periodontal dressing powders and from large rolls of
asbestos kept in the laboratories.
A simulation of fibers dispersion in the USA showed low
concentrations (0.005-0.092 fibers/mL; 0.001-0.006 fibers/mL-time
weighted average [TWA]) of chrysotile fibers.20 Another simulation
study in Greece found a concentration of 0.008 fibers/cm3 (chrysotile
only) during a 4-h sampling period in a dental laboratory where pleural
plaques had been found in three dentists who used to manipulate wet
asbestos tape during casting operations.13 A recent study found
asbestos (unspecified type) concentrations of 0.0104-0.0159 fibers/
mL in dental laboratories in South Korea.21 To our knowledge, there
are no data on asbestos concentrations in dental laboratories in Italy.
Thehazardfromairborneasbestosduringvariousperiodontalsurgical
procedures has been highlighted since 1976: zinc-oxide periodontal
dressings consisted of a mixture of a liquid and a powder containing
asbestos fibers as a binding agent.5 Asbestos fibers were indeed used in
gingivectomy packs.3 Use of a resin containing asbestos between 1967
and 1968 at the Royal Dental Hospital, London was reported.8
Despite the documented use of asbestos in dentistry, only one case
of MM arising in workers exposed to asbestos fibers during dental
practice had been documented.14 Another case of MM in a dentist was
reported in an obituary but asbestos exposure was not investigated.22

 expensive asbestos type not commonly used in dental application—
were found in lung tissue. In the United States only white asbestos
(chrysotile) has been used in dentistry.20 Raw materials were similar in
the US and UK. Although biopersistence of amphibole fibers is greater
than that of chrysotile fibers,23 clearance of long chrysotile fibers is slow
or insignificant; therefore a “clearance effect”14 does not seem to be an
adequate explanation.Also the source of exposure in thecase described
by Reid et al.14 remains unclear because that subject may have inhaled
blue asbestos used in British gas masks during World War II.20
Pleural plaques and pneumoconiosis secondary to manipulating
asbestos tapes during casting operations have been reported.10,13,24
Dental laboratory technicians often start to work early (at the age
of about 18 years), are often self-employed, and work alone or in small
laboratories. Moreover, these workplaces have usually inadequate
methods of dust control and self-employed subjects often work more
than 8 h per day, with no information about occupational risks.19,24
Since asbestos was banned in 1992, the possibility that asbestos
containing materials are today present in dental laboratories in Italy is
remote. Asbestos exposure is currently a possibility in countries where
asbestos is still used or was banned only recently.21
Asbestos bodies and asbestos fibers in lung tissue have been used
for many years as useful markers of cumulative dose and in
documenting past exposure to amphiboles.25 These markers are less
useful in the case of chrysotile exposure, because of the low
biopersistence of this type of asbestos.26 In the first patient the
asbestos body burden (22,000/gdw) was significantly higher than the
limit of 1,000/gdw recommended by the Helsinki Consensus
Document, indicating past asbestos exposure with high probabil-
ity.27,28 Conversely, fiber concentration was below the laboratory
detection limit. This result could be explained by the fact that the
patient had probably been using chrysotile and that lung fiber analysis
was performed 47 years after last asbestos exposure. On the other
hand, asbestos bodies are largely produced by long amphibole fibers,
while production from chrysotile is negligible.29,30 Hence, we can
hypothesize that chrysotile materials used by the patient were
contaminated by amphibole asbestos. None of the patients described
in this paper was aware of the asbestos type used.
Finally, it should be recognized that for patient 1, only one lung
lobe was available for asbestos body and asbestos fiber burden.
Hence, analysis performance was probably suboptimal. To improve
sensitivity the recommended procedure is to pool lung samples from
all lobes of both lungs.31
In conclusion, we have documented two MM cases related to
dental technician work with definite asbestos exposure and two with
possible occupational asbestos exposure. For all of them we filed
claims for compensation to the Italian Workers’ Compensation
Authority (INAIL). Only the first patient was compensated because
the other subjects, being self-employed or not formally employed (the
woman), were not covered by work insurance. Availability of a registry
focused on MM has provided a fundamental aid in discovering
unrecognized or overlooked (due to the long latency of the disease)
sources of asbestos exposure. Dental technicians suffering from
mesothelioma should be questioned about past occupational asbestos
exposure.
