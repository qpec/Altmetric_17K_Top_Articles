Abstract
Objective—The authors sought to clarify the relationship between marriage and risk for alcohol 
use disorder.
Method—The association between marital status and risk for first registration for alcohol use 
disorder in medical, criminal, and pharmacy registries was assessed in a population-based Swedish 
cohort (N=3,220, 628) using longitudinal time-dependent survival and co-relative designs.
Results—First marriage was associated with a substantial decline in risk for onset of alcohol use 
disorder in men (hazard ratio=0.41, 95% CI=0.40–0.42) and women (hazard ratio=0.27, 95% 
CI=0.26–0.28). This association was slightly stronger when the spouse had no lifetime alcohol use 
disorder, while marriage to a spouse with lifetime alcohol use disorder increased risk for 
subsequent alcohol use disorder registration in both men (hazard ratio=1.29, 95% CI=1.16–1.43) 
and women(hazard ratio=1.18, 95% CI=1.06–1.30). In both sexes, the protective effect of marriage 
was significantly stronger in those with than those without a family history of alcohol use disorder. 
In both men and women, the associations between marriage and risk for alcohol use disorder in 
cousins, half siblings, full siblings, and monozygotic twins discordant for marital status were as 
strong as that seen in the general population.
Conclusions—First marriage to a spouse with no lifetime alcohol use disorder is associated with 
a large reduction in risk for alcohol use disorder. This association cannot be explained by standard 
covariates or, as indicated by co-relative analyses, familial genetic or shared environmental 
confounders. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the psychological and social 
aspects of marriage, and in particular health-monitoring spousal interactions, strongly protect 
against the development of alcohol use disorder. The protective effects of marriage on risk for 
alcohol use disorder are increased in those at high familial risk for alcoholism.

 Marital status is strongly associated with alcohol consumption, problem drinking, and, in 
particular, risk for alcohol use disorder (1–6). For example, in a general population survey of 
Swedish young adults, the frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption among married 
individuals were 41% and 51% lower, respectively, than among single individuals (7). In an 
epidemiological study of Stockholm County, a diagnosis of alcoholism was 2.1 times as 
common in single compared with cohabiting adults (8). Understanding the causal processes 
underlying this robust association could provide important insights into the etiology of 
alcohol use disorder and elucidate potential avenues for prevention. However, this is a 
challenging problem. The etiology of the association between marriage and alcohol use 
disorder is likely to be complex and reflect 1) the impact of confounding variables that 
influence both marital rates and disorder risk, 2) selection effects (i.e., the impact of heavy 
drinking on marital status), and 3) direct causal effects of marital status on risk for alcohol 
use disorder (9).
Confounding factors such as social class, family history of alcohol use disorder, and 
externalizing personality traits could have an impact on both the risk for problematic 
drinking and alcohol use disorder (10–12) and the probability of getting and staying married 
(13–19). The possible importance of selection is suggested by evidence in some (14, 20) but 
not all studies (21–23) that heavy drinking in young adulthood can delay marriage. Direct 
causal effects of marriage on risk for alcohol use disorder could arise as a result of the 
incompatibility between alcohol use disorder and the social and psychological obligations 
associated with marriage (9), and/or direct spousal interactions in which spouses monitor 
and try to control each other’s drinking (24). Longitudinal and quasi-experimental studies 
have provided converging support that marriage may indeed be causally related to reductions 
in alcohol use (4, 25–27). The protective effects of marriage are likely to depend, in part, on 
characteristics of the individual, as problem drinkers show the greatest decreases in drinking 
after marriage (28). Individuals at high risk for alcohol use disorder may be especially 
sensitive to the protective effects of marriage. Spousal characteristics likely also have an 
impact on the effects of marriage (29). Marriage to a spouse with alcohol problems may be 
associated with an increased risk for alcohol use disorder (30). Whether these effects differ 
for men and women is not confidently known, given the small and sometimes 
unrepresentative samples historically used in this area of research (31).
In this study, using time-dependent survival models and co-relative designs applied to a large 
population-based Swedish cohort (N=3,220,628), we sought to clarify the nature of the 
relationship between first marriage and subsequent risk for first registration for alcohol use 
disorder. We had six aims:
1.
To clarify in the general population the prospective association between 
marital status and risk for alcohol use disorder.
2.
To determine the degree to which this association can be explained by 
parental education, family history, and early history of criminal behavior 
or drug abuse.
3.
To clarify the differential impact on risk of being married to a spouse who, 
during their lifetime, will or will not develop alcohol use disorder.

To evaluate whether individuals at increased familial risk of alcohol use 
disorder are more sensitive to the protective effects of marriage.
5.
To determine, using co-relative designs, the degree to which the 
association between marital status and alcohol use disorder can be 
explained by familial confounding factors.

To determine the degree to which the answers to the above questions differ

METHOD
Sample
We linked nationwide Swedish registers via the unique 10-digit identification number 
assigned at birth or immigration to all Swedish residents. The identification number was 
replaced by a serial number to ensure anonymity.
The following sources were used to create a data set for analysis: the Total Population 
Register, containing year of birth, sex, and annual data on place of residence; the Swedish 
National Census; the Swedish Mortality Register, containing dates of death; the 
Multigeneration register, linking children born after 1932 to their parents; the Swedish 
Hospital Discharge Register, containing data on hospitalizations from 1964 to 2010; the 
Outpatient Care register, containing information from all outpatient clinics between 2001 
and 2010; the Prescribed Drug register, containing data on all prescriptions in Sweden 
picked up by patients from 2005 to 2010; the Primary Health Care Register, containing data 
on outpatient diagnoses from 2001 to 2007 for 1 million patients from Stockholm and parts 
of southern Sweden; the Swedish Crime Register, which contains complete national data an 
all convictions in lower courts from 1973 to 2011; the Swedish Suspicion Register, which 
includes complete national data on individuals strongly suspected of crime from 1998 to 
2011; and the Swedish Twin Register (32).
The analysis was based on individuals born between 1960 and 1990. For the co-relative 
analysis, we identified relative pairs from the Multigeneration register born within 3 years of 
each other.
Measures
Cohabiting couples are not registered but can be identified in the Swedish registers if 
married or living together with common children. For the period before 1990, this 
information is provided in 5-year increments, and after 1990 it is provided yearly. In all of 
our analyses, we defined categorized as “married” any member of a couple who are 
officially married and cohabiting or are cohabiting with a common biological child.
Alcohol use disorder was identified in three ways. The first was medical diagnosis from the 
medical registers: ICD-8 codes 571.0, 291, 303, and 980; ICD-9 codes V79B, 305A, 357F, 
571A–571D, 425F, 535D, 291, 303, and 980; and ICD-10 codes E244, G312, G621, G721, 
I426, K292, K700–K709, K852, K860, O354, T510–T519, and F101–F109. The second was 
registration in the prescription registry for well-recognized drugs to treat alcohol use

 disorder using the ATC Classification System codes N07BB01, N07BB03, andN07BB04. 
The third was registration in the suspicion and conviction registers for at least two records of 
drunk driving (suspicion code 3005, law1951:649 [paragraph 4 and 4A]) or drunk in charge 
of a maritime vessel (suspicion code 3201, law 1994–1009 [chapter 20, paragraph 4 and 5]).
Early-onset deviant behavior was defined as criminal behavior or drug abuse before age 18. 
As a dichotomous measure of familial risk we assessed whether the individual had one or 
more parents, full and half siblings, or cousins with an alcohol use disorder registration.
Statistical Methods
We used Cox proportional hazard methods to estimate the risk of onset of alcohol use 
disorder as a function of marital status, which was included in the model as a time-
dependent covariate. The outcome variable was time to onset of alcohol use disorder after 
age 18, and we censored at death, end of marriage, migration, or end of follow-up (2011), 
whichever came first. Subjects with an onset of alcohol use disorder prior to age 18 were 
also censored; they are uninformative in our analyses because marriage prior to age 18 is 
illegal in Sweden. We adjusted for year of birth and parental education. To account for early 
deviant behavior, we included registration of criminal behavior or drug abuse through age 
18. We investigated whether lifetime registration for alcohol use disorder in the spouse 
affected the association with marital status, and, finally, we explored whether a higher 
genetic risk modified the marital impact. To test for gender differences, we constructed a 
joint model including both sexes and allowing all covariates to differ by gender by including 
the relevant interactions in the model.
In the next step, we used a co-relative design utilizing same-sex cousin, half-sibling, full-
sibling, and monozygotic twin pairs. We identified unique combinations of pairs and used 
conditional Cox regression, where each pair is treated as a stratum, meaning the effect of the 
covariates are estimated within each pair, thereby controlling for confounding factors shared 
within that pair. Neither of the members of the pair was registered for alcohol use disorder or 
was married before age 18. Marital status is included as a time-dependent covariate; either 
one member of the pair met our criteria for marriage over the follow-up period and one did 
not, or they were married at different ages.
RESULTS
Our total sample consisted of over 3.2 million individuals, of whom 72,252 met our criteria 
for alcohol use disorder, with an average age at first registration of ~27 years (Table 1). The 
prevalence of the disorder was 3.3% in men and 1.1% in women, and slightly less than half 
of the affected individuals had one or more relatives similarly affected. Thirty-four percent 
of the men and 12% of the women with alcohol use disorder had early-onset deviant 
behavior.
Findings in Men
In our Cox proportional hazard model, marital status was associated with a hazard ratio for 
first registration for alcohol use disorder of 0.41 (95% CI=0.40–0.42) (Table 2, model 1). 
The hazard ratio did not change with the addition in model 2 of birth year, parental

 education, early-onset externalizing syndromes, or positive family history, the latter three of 
which were all strongly associated with disease risk. Model 3 added lifetime registration for 
alcohol use disorder in the spouse, which in model3awasshownto strongly increase risk for 
subsequent alcohol use disorder registration (hazard ratio=3.37). In model 3b, we 
reparameterized the model to calculate the hazard ratios for subsequent registration for 
marriage to a spouse without and a spouse with a lifetime registration for alcohol use 
disorder, which were estimated at 0.38 and 1.29, respectively. That is, for men, marriage to a 
wife with no history of registration for alcohol use disorder was associated with a substantial 
reduction in risk for alcohol use disorder, while marriage to a wife with a history of 
registration for alcohol use disorder increased risk beyond that observed in single men. 
Finally, in model 4, we added to model 3a the interaction between familial risk and marital 
status. This interaction was significant (hazard ratio=0.89, p<0.001) and indicated that 
individuals with a positive family history of alcoholism had increased sensitivity to the 
protective effects of marriage on risk for alcohol use disorder.
Findings in Women
The inverse association between marriage and risk for alcohol use disorder was stronger in 
women than in men, with a hazard ratio of 0.27 (95% CI=0.26–0.28) (Table 3, model 1). The 
hazard ratio increased slightly with the addition in model 2 of birth year, parental education, 
early-onset externalizing behaviors, and family history. In model 3a, we see that a history of 
registration for alcohol use disorder in the spouse was more strongly related to risk for 
alcohol use disorder in women (hazard ratio=4.71) than in men. In model 3b, we can see that 
in women, marriage to a spouse without and a spouse with history of registration for alcohol 
use disorder is associated with, respectively, a substantially reduced (hazard ratio=0.25) and 
a modestly increased risk for alcohol use disorder (hazard ratio=1.18) compared with the 
nonmarried state. In model 4, we see that the reduction in risk for alcohol use disorder 
associated with marriage was stronger in those with a positive family history compared with 
those with a negative family history (hazard ratio=0.88, p=0.01).
When we modeled the effect of marital status jointly in both sexes, the inverse association 
between marriage and alcohol use disorder was significantly stronger in women than in men 
(p<0.001), and the association between risk for alcohol use disorder and history of 
registration for alcohol use disorder in the spouse was stronger for women than for men 
(p<0.001).
Co-Relative Analyses
As detailed in Tables S1 and S2 in the data supplement that accompanies the online edition 
of this article, we identified, in men and in women respectively, the following number of 
unique same-sex sibling pairs discordant for both the occurrence of or age at marriage and 
the occurrence of or age at first registration for alcohol use disorder: cousins, 21,849 and 
6,599; half siblings, 1,519 and 487; full siblings, 7,250 and 2,388; and monozygotic twins, 
100 and 26. As seen in Table 4, within-pair analyses demonstrated no evidence in either men 
or women for an attenuation of the association between marital status and alcohol use 
disorder with increased sharing of genetic and environmental background. Although known 
imprecisely, the association seen with risk for alcohol use disorder in monozygotic twin

 pairs discordant for marital status was slightly stronger than that seen in the general 
population; for men the hazard ratio was 0.31 (95% CI=0.11–0.85) and for women 0.18 
(95% CI=0.04–0.82). Perhaps more importantly, in our large sample of discordant full 
siblings, the observed associations were very similar to those seen in the population, where 
for men the hazard ratio is 0.36 (95% CI=0.33–0.39) and women 0.25 (95% CI=0.21–0.30).
DISCUSSION
We sought in this study of the Swedish general population to clarify the nature and causes of 
the association between marital status and risk for onset of alcohol use disorder. We posed 
six major aims for our analyses, which we address in turn.
First, congruent with past studies examining alcohol intake and problem drinking (1–4), we 
found, in a prospective design, an association between marital status and risk for onset of 
alcohol use disorder. The association was strong, with married men and women having, 
respectively, a 60% and 71%lower risk for onset of alcohol use disorder compared with 
individuals who remained single. This mirrors recent epidemiological findings from the 
National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III, in which individuals 
who were never married had a substantially higher risk for alcohol use disorder in the past 
year (odds ratio=1.6) compared with those who were married (10). It is also consistent with 
prior evidence that young adults who remain single have a higher incidence of symptoms of 
alcohol use disorder (risk ratio=2.1) compared with those who stay or become married (33); 
that being married is associated with reduced risk for the onset of alcohol use disorder (34); 
and that getting married is associated with reductions in heavy drinking (2, 4). Our findings 
are also congruent with evidence that marriage reduces risk for other externalizing 
behaviors, including crime and drug abuse (19, 35).
Second, one obvious explanation for this association is that the exposure and outcome are 
both predicted by key confounding variables. We considered three: socioeconomic status, 
early criminal behavior or drug abuse, and a family history of alcohol use disorder. There is 
evidence in some studies that antisocial individuals are less likely to be or become married 
(19, 36, 37); however, other studies have found no association between some forms of 
antisocial behavior and marital status (38) and an increased likelihood of early marriage 
among those with antisocial personality disorder (39). When good measures of these three 
constructs were added to the statistical model, no attenuation was seen in the relationship 
between marital status and alcohol use disorder. These confounding variables could not 
explain any appreciable proportion of this association.
Third, how much would the protective effect of marriage on risk for alcohol use disorder in 
an individual depend on the history of alcohol use disorder in his or her spouse? Our initial 
analyses focused on a lifetime registration for alcohol use disorder in the spouse, and we 
found strong effects. While marriage to a spouse without lifetime registration for alcohol use 
disorder was strongly protective, marriage to an affected spouse significantly increased the 
risk for future alcohol use disorder. These findings go beyond previous studies showing that 
spouses tend to be concordant for alcohol use disorder (40) and are consistent with a 
substantial literature documenting partner influence (29) and convergence for alcohol use

 (41) as well as the heightened risk for developing alcohol problems when one’s spouse has 
an alcohol problem (30). We also conducted follow-up analyses examining marriage to 
women who had a registration for alcohol use disorder prior to marriage; the effect on future 
risk for alcohol use disorder in their husbands was modestly weaker than that seen for our 
broader definition of any lifetime disorder (hazard ratio=2.13, 95% CI=1.73–2.63). These 
results provide insight into the nature of the protective effect of marriage on risk for alcohol 
use disorder. If social role expectations were the critical component of marriage that reduced 
such risk, then marriage to an alcohol-abusing spouse should remain protective. That it is not 
in our data suggests that direct spousal interaction is more critical. This would be consistent 
with the position articulated by Umberson that “marriage may be beneficial to health 
because many spouses monitor and attempt to control their spouse’s health behaviors” (24, 
p. 907).
Fourth, previous studies of gene-environment interaction in alcohol intake or problems have 
focused on reduced social control or increased psychosocial adversity (42, 43). Here we 
asked a different question—whether individuals at high familial risk for alcohol use disorder 
had a different sensitivity to the protective effects of marriage than those without such risk. 
As expected, we found a substantial main effect of those with a positive family history 
having a stronger risk for alcohol use disorder. More interestingly, we found robust evidence 
that the protective effects of marriage were stronger in those with a family history compared 
to those without. This effect is consistent with recent findings that severe problem drinkers 
show the greatest decrease in drinking after the transition to marriage (28). Those at highest 
risk for alcohol problems appear to be the most likely to benefit from the protective effects 
of marriage.
Fifth, the most important question in the large literature on the association of marital status 
and drinking behavior and alcohol use disorder is the degree to which the association is 
likely causal. In our study, in which we show that marital status predicts subsequent onset of 
alcohol use disorder, we have two plausible and non–mutually exclusive causal hypotheses: 
1) some set of confounding factors act inversely on the probability of marriage and directly 
on the risk for alcohol use disorder or 2) marriage reduces the risk of disorder. Our initial 
analyses with covariates provided evidence against the first hypothesis, but it is difficult to 
be confident that we identified all the relevant confounding variables. Therefore, we 
proceeded to co-relative analyses in which we compared the association between marital 
status and risk for first onset alcohol use disorder in the general population and among 
informative pairs of monozygotic twins, full and half siblings, and first cousins discordant 
for marital status. The advantage of a co-relative design is that it controls for any 
confounding risk factors that are themselves familial—which constitutes the large majority 
of human behavioral traits (44). If the association between marital status and alcohol use 
disorder resulted from such confounding factors, we would expect that it would be modestly 
weaker in distant relationships and then become further weakened among more closely 
related relative pairs who share more of their genetic and environmental background. In 
particular, the expectation would be that among informative monozygotic twin pairs, who 
share all of their genetic and rearing environment, the association would be substantially 
attenuated compared with that observed in the general population. This is not the trend 
observed in our data. Rather, we see no weakening of the association between marital status 
Kendler et al.

 and alcohol use disorder as we move from the general population to cousins, half siblings, 
full siblings, and, finally, monozygotic twins discordant for marital status. These results 
provide support for the second hypothesis—that marriage is causally related to a reduction 
in risk for alcohol use disorder. This conclusion is consistent with recent smaller quasi-
causal studies of young adult twin and sibling pairs that found that marriage predicted lower 
alcohol use after controlling for genetic and familial environmental confounders (25, 26).
Lastly, because of its large population-based sample, this study was well powered to explore 
whether the association of marital status and risk for alcohol use disorder differed between 
the sexes. Previous studies have typically found a greater “marriage benefit” with respect to 
health for men than for women (24, 45). However, our results were inconsistent with these 
expectations. This may be attributable to the fact that there are more male problem drinkers 
for women with this predisposition to partner with than vice versa (46, 47). By contrast, the 
impact of a family history and the interaction between a family history and marital status on 
risk for alcohol use disorder were similar in men and women. Historically, sex differences 
for interactions have not been systematically examined (48), in part because of concerns 
about statistical power and type II error. Although it has been suggested that men may be 
more sensitive to relationship factors than women (49),we do not find evidence of that here.
These results should be interpreted in the context of two potentially important 
methodological limitations. First, we identified subjects with alcohol use disorder from 
medical, legal, and pharmacy records. While this method does not require respondent 
cooperation or accurate recall and reporting, it could produce both false negative and false 
positive diagnoses. Given that the population prevalence of alcohol use disorder in this 
sample is much lower than estimates from epidemiologic surveys (10, 50), including one 
from neighboring Norway (which estimated lifetime prevalence for alcohol use disorder at 
13.2% and 5.2% in men and women, respectively) (51), false negative diagnoses are surely 
much more common than false positive ones. Compared with those identified in 
epidemiologic surveys, the cases of alcohol use disorder that we studied are likely to be 
more severe and to be associated with more prominent alcohol-related social and medical 
consequences. The best available validation for our definition of illness is the high rates of 
concordance for registration observed across our different ascertainment methods (52).
Second, in our definition of marriage we combined couples who were officially married and 
those cohabiting with common children. To confirm our findings with a “narrower” 
definition, we repeated our main analyses including only couples who were legally married. 
Using our standard covariates (model 2), the protective effect of marriage so defined on the 
risk for alcohol use disorder changed only slightly and was modestly stronger in men 
(hazard ratio=0.34, 95% CI=0.33–0.36) and slightly weaker in women (hazard ratio=0.32, 
95% CI=0.30–0.35).
In summary, first marriage to a spouse with no history of registration for alcohol use 
disorder is associated with a large reduction in risk for alcohol use disorder. This association 
does not arise as a result of confounding assessed either through the use of standard 
covariates or by co-relative analyses including marriage-discordant siblings and 
monozygotic twins. The protective effects of marriage on risk for alcohol use disorder are

 likely to arise largely from direct spousal interactions, and they are stronger in individuals 
who have an elevated familial risk for alcoholism. While causal effects are difficult to prove 
in observational data, and we cannot rule out the impact of hidden biases, these results are 
consistent with the hypothesis that the psychological and social aspects of marriage strongly 
protect against the development of alcohol use disorder.

aModels 3a and 3b are reparameterizations of one another with an identical model fit and explanatory power. Model 3a demonstrates the impact of marriage to a spouse with no history of registration for 
alcohol use disorder and then shows the additional risk involved if that spouse has a history of alcohol use disorder (increasing risk ~3.4-fold). Model 3b reparameterizes this to allow us to compare directly 
the risk association with marriage to aspouse without versus aspouse with a history of registration for alcohol use disorder (hazard ratios of 0.38 versus 1.29).
