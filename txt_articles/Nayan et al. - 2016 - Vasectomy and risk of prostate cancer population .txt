ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To determine the association between vasectomy and 
prostate cancer, adjusting for measures of health 
seeking behaviour.
Design
Population based matched cohort study.
setting
Multiple validated healthcare databases in Ontario, 
Canada, 1994-2012.
PartiCiPants
326 607 men aged 20 to 65 who had undergone 
vasectomy were identified through physician billing 
codes and matched 1:1 on age (within two years), year 
of cohort entry, comorbidity score, and geographical 
region to men who did not undergo a vasectomy.
Main OutCOMes Measures
The primary outcome was incident prostate cancer. 
Secondary outcomes were prostate cancer related 
grade, stage, and mortality.
results
3462 incident cases of prostate cancer were identified 
after a median follow-up of 10.9 years: 1843 (53.2%) in 
the vasectomy group and 1619 (46.8%) in the non-
vasectomy group. In unadjusted analysis, vasectomy 
was associated with a slightly increased risk of incident 
prostate cancer (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% confidence 
interval 1.05 to 1.20). After adjustment for measures of 
health seeking behaviour, however, no association 
remained (adjusted hazard ratio 1.02, 95% confidence 
interval 0.95 to 1.09). Moreover, no association was 
found between vasectomy and high grade prostate 
cancer (adjusted odds ratio 1.05, 95% confidence 
interval 0.67 to 1.66), advanced stage prostate cancer 
(adjusted odds ratio 1.04, 0.81 to 1.34), or mortality 
(adjusted hazard ratio 1.06, 0.60 to 1.85).
COnClusiOn
The findings do not support an independent 
association between vasectomy and prostate cancer.
Introduction
Vasectomy is a minor outpatient procedure with few 
short term complications.1 
2  It is effective in most men 
and one of the most reliable and cost effective long term 
methods of contraception.3 4  An estimated 33 million 
women worldwide rely on their partner’s vasectomy for 
contraception.5
Several studies have explored the possible associa-
tion between vasectomy and prostate cancer, with con-
flicting results.6-30  Potential biological mechanisms 
supporting an association between vasectomy and inci-
dent prostate cancer include increases in androgen lev-
els, which are hypothesised to increase the risk of 
prostate cancer,31  and impaired secretory function of 
the prostate, which might prolong exposure of the pros-
tate to carcinogenic factors.11  Although some studies 
have shown an increase in serum dihydrotestosterone 
and testosterone after vasectomy,32-34  others have found 
no statistically significant change in androgen 
 
levels.35 36  Similarly, findings on the association 
between frequency of ejaculation and risk of prostate 
cancer are conflicting .37 
38 Thus the possible biological 
relation, if any, between vasectomy and prostate cancer 
remains unclear.
Many of the studies that found an association 
between vasectomy and prostate cancer were limited by 
sample size and the potential for selection, recall, and 
detection biases. Given the frequency of vasectomy, 
even a small increased risk of prostate cancer would 
constitute a major public health problem. We examined 
the association between vasectomy and prostate cancer 
in a large population based cohort, adjusting for health 
seeking behaviours that might have biased other stud-
ies examining this association.
Methods
setting and data sources
We conducted a population based matched cohort study 
of residents in Ontario, Canada. With a population of 
about 14 million in 2016,39  Ontario is Canada’s most 
populous province, and residents have universal access 
to physician services and hospital care. We used the 
Ontario health insurance plan database to identify phy-
sician claims for vasectomy. The Ontario Cancer Regis-
try40  was used to identify patients with incident prostate

In this large population based study using validated healthcare databases, vasectomy 
does not seem to be independently associated with risk of prostate cancer

cancer (international classification of diseases, ninth 
and 10th revisions (ICD-9: 185 and ICD-10: C61, respec-
tively), characteristics of their tumour, and date and 
cause of death, where applicable. It is a validated, pop-
ulation based tumour registry maintained by Cancer 
Care Ontario and is estimated to be more than 95% com-
plete.40 
41  We obtained data on admissions to hospitals 
from the Canadian Institute for health information dis-
charge abstract database,42  national ambulatory care 
reporting system, and same day surgery database, 
which contain detailed clinical information on admis-
sions to hospitals and emergency departments and out-
patient surgical procedures in Ontario. We obtained 
basic personal data from the registered persons data-
base, a registry of all Ontario residents eligible for health 
insurance. These databases were linked in an anony-
mous fashion using encrypted health card numbers, 
and are routinely used to study the long term conse-
quences of medical care.43-45  Details of the databases 
used and their validity have been described elsewhere.46
study participants
We identified all men aged 20 to 65 who underwent a 
vasectomy between 1 April 1994 and 31 December 2012. 
We excluded those with a diagnosis of prostate cancer 
before vasectomy, those who underwent a vasovasos-
tomy (vasectomy reversal) at any time before the cen-
soring date, and those who underwent other procedures 
on the same day that were inconsistent with receipt of a 
vasectomy for the purpose of contraception—for exam-
ple, vasectomy performed on the same day as prostatec-
tomy or vesiculectomy (removal of seminal vesicles). 
The date of vasectomy served as the index date.
For each man who underwent vasectomy, we selected 
one man who did not, matching on age (within two 
years), comorbidity score (defined using the Johns Hop-
kins adjusted clinical groups case mix system),47  geo-
graphical area (defined by the first three digits of the 
postal code), and index date. The Johns Hopkins 
adjusted clinical case mix system was designed to pre-
dict healthcare use and considers the duration, sever-
ity, and intensity of service use related to both inpatient 
and outpatient claims, details of which have been pro-
vided elsewhere.48  To assign a score to each patient for 
this study, we used data from Ontario health insurance 
plan, the Canadian Institute for Health Information, 
and the national ambulatory care reporting system. We 
randomly assigned an index date within one year of the 
vasectomy date of the corresponding matched partici-
pant to account for temporal changes in prostate cancer 
screening and diagnosis over time. Because men not 
undergoing a vasectomy might be infertile, and infertil-
ity might be related to risk of prostate cancer,49 we also 
excluded those with a diagnosis of infertility from the 
cohort of non-vasectomised men.
Outcome assessment
The primary outcome was incident prostate cancer, 
defined as the first recorded date of prostate cancer diag-
nosis in the Ontario Cancer Registry. Secondary outcomes 
included prostate cancer related grade, stage, and mortal-
ity. We categorised prostate cancer grade as low (Gleason 
score 2-6), intermediate (Gleason score 7), or high (Glea-
son score 8-10), and prostate cancer stage as either local-
ised (stage T1-2) or advanced (stage T3+, N+, or M+).
We followed participants until their date of last con-
tact with health services, death, or the end of the study 
period, whichever occurred first. For the analysis of 
mortality, we followed patients until 31 December 2012, 
the last date for which cancer specific mortality data 
were available. For all other outcomes, we followed 
patients until 31 March 2014.
Covariates
To deal with the possibility of healthy user bias, we 
obtained data on the number of admissions to hospitals 
and the number of visits to general practitioners, spe-
cialists, urologists, and emergency departments. For 
each of these, we identified the number of interactions 
in the year preceding the index date and between the 
index date and end of follow-up. To account for survival 
bias, whereby those who survive longer are likely to 
have a higher number of interactions with healthcare 
services, we standardised interactions with healthcare 
services to duration of follow-up by dividing the num-
ber of interactions by follow-up time.
To adjust for potential detection bias, we obtained data 
on the number of colonoscopies, faecal occult blood tests, 
and cholesterol tests. We chose these tests as they are 
insured under the universal healthcare system in Ontario 
and therefore the data were available within the data-
bases used for this study, whereas testing for prostate spe-
cific antigen is not. We assumed that patients undergoing 
these prevention tests would also be likely to undergo 
testing for prostate specific antigen. Indeed, the associa-
tion between prostate and colorectal cancer screening 
has been shown among men in Alberta, another province 
in Canada with universal healthcare.50 We similarly 
divided these tests into subcategories according to 
whether they occurred before or after the index date.
We also collected data on socioeconomic status to 
control for potential confounding, as such status relates 
to receipt of both vasectomy and cancer screening.51 52 
 
Finally, an association between sexually transmitted 
infections and risk of prostate cancer has been 
reported53; although results of testing for sexually trans-
mitted infections are not available in administrative 
data, we also evaluated the number of these tests per-
formed during the study period.
statistical analysis
For each outcome we evaluated the standardised differ-
ence according to vasectomy or non-vasectomy group. 
We adjusted models based on covariates that were con-
sidered to be meaningfully different between the groups 
(standardised difference >0.10). As the numbers of 
prostate cancer specific deaths were limited, a decision 
was made a priori to evaluate differences between 
groups on age at diagnosis of prostate cancer, rural sta-
tus, fifth of income, and comorbidity score only.
We obtained cumulative probability estimates for inci-
dent prostate cancer using the Kaplan-Meier method. To

estimate the association between vasectomy and risk of 
incident prostate cancer and mortality, we conducted 
time-to-event analyses using population averaged Cox 
proportional hazard regression. For prostate cancer 
grade and stage, we used logistic regression models.
We performed a tracer analysis by examining the out-
come of incident non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, in a fash-
ion identical to the analysis of incident prostate cancer. 
As there is no reason to anticipate an association 
between vasectomy and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, we 
reasoned that a positive association in this analysis 
would suggest that any observed association between 
vasectomy and risk of prostate cancer might reflect 
residual confounding.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 
(version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). We considered a 
two sided P value of 0.05 to be statistically significant.
sensitivity analysis
To further evaluate the potential for confounding on the 
association between vasectomy and risk of prostate 
cancer, we performed three additional analyses in 
which we included only income fifth, interactions with 
health services before index date, or interactions with 
health services after index date. The last two models 
only included variables found to be meaningfully differ-
ent between the groups (standardised  
difference >0.10).
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. No plans have been made 
to disseminate the results of the research to study 
 
participants; however, results will be disseminated to 
the relevant patient community.
Results
Over the 18 year study period, 395 836 men underwent 
vasectomy. Of these, 326 607 (82.5%) were matched to 
an equal number of men who did not undergo vasec-
tomy. Unmatched cases tended to be younger and have 
higher comorbidity scores than matched cases. Table 1 
shows the characteristics of the cohort. The median fol-
low-up was 10.9 years (interquartile range 6.3-15.4).

1619 (46.8%) in the non-vasectomy group. Figure 1 
shows the cumulative probability of incident prostate 
cancer, stratified by vasectomy status. In the  
unadjusted 
analysis, vasectomy was associated with a modest but 
statistically significant increased risk of incident pros-
tate cancer (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 
1.05 to 1.20). Variables found to be meaningfully differ-
ent between the groups and included in the multivari-
able model were income fifth; visits to specialists, 
urologists, and emergency departments in the year 
before the index date; and visits to general practitioners 
between the index date and end of follow-up. After 
adjustment for these variables, the association between 
vasectomy and incident prostate cancer was no longer 
discernible (table 2, adjusted hazard ratio 1.02, 95% 
confidence interval 0.95 to 1.09).
Sensitivity analyses were conducted excluding men 
aged less than 50 and less than 60 at their last fol-
low-up. No association was found between vasectomy 
and incident prostate cancer after restricting analyses 
to men with follow-up at least to age 50 (adjusted 
 
hazard ratio 1.06, 0.98 to 1.15) or at least to age 60

Prostate cancer grade and stage
Cancer grade was available for 1364 (39.4%) men with a 
diagnosis of prostate cancer: low grade in 540 (39.6%), 
intermediate in 704 (51.6%), and high in 120 (8.8%) (see 
supplementary table S1). Compared with low grade 
prostate cancer, vasectomy was not associated with an 
increased risk of intermediate or high grade cancer in 
any analyses (table 3).
Cancer stage was available for 1790 (51.7%) men with 
a diagnosis of prostate cancer: the cancer was localised 
in 1408 (78.7%) and advanced at the time of diagnosis in 
382 (21.3%) (see supplementary table S2). Vasectomy 
was not associated with advanced stage at diagnosis in 
any analyses (table 3).
Prostate cancer specific mortality
Overall, 50 patients died from prostate cancer (see sup-
plementary table S3). Vasectomy was not associated 
with prostate cancer specific mortality (table 3).
incident non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
In the tracer analysis, we identified 1100 cases of incident 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma: 533 (48.4%) in the vasectomy 
group and 567 (51.6%) in the non-vasectomy group. 
Vasectomy was not statistically significantly associated 
with incident non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (table 3).
sensitivity analysis
The association between vasectomy and risk of prostate 
cancer was no longer evident when including interac-
tions with health services before index date (see supple-
mentary table S4).
discussion
In this population based study spanning nearly 20 years, 
we observed no statistically significant association 
between vasectomy and prostate cancer related risk, 
grade, stage, or mortality. Our findings have important 
implications for patients, clinicians, guidelines, policy 
makers, and family planning support groups.
Previous studies of the association between vasec-
tomy and prostate cancer have produced conflicting 
results.6 
7  Most of these studies included fewer than 100 
men with prostate cancer among those undergoing 
vasectomy and had limited follow-up. Furthermore, 
concerns have been raised about bias, unmeasured 
confounding, and chance in relation to the small 
increased risk found by others.25 
54  Recently published 
meta-analyses of these studies found that vasectomy 
was not associated with risk of prostate cancer,6 
7  and 
guidelines from the American Urological Association in 
2012 recommended that clinicians do not need to rou-
tinely discuss prostate cancer during preoperative 
counselling of men considering vasectomy.55
A large prospective cohort study published in 2014, 
however, found that history of vasectomy was  
associated 
with a 10% increased risk of prostate cancer overall and 
a roughly 20% increased risk of high grade and lethal 
disease.30  This study received much media attention,56 
 
might have caused anxiety among men who were plan-
ning or had already undergone a vasectomy, and even 
prompted a formal response from the American Urolog-
ical Association.57  The study relied on data from the 
Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and the history of 
vasectomy was obtained through questionnaires and 
might therefore have been prone to selection and recall 
bias. Additional concerns raised by the American Uro-
logical Association included inconsistencies with previ-
ous reports on the same cohort of men, and residual 
confounding.57  After considering all the evidence to 
date, the association reaffirmed its 2012 guideline rec-
ommendations against routine discussion of prostate 
cancer during preoperative counselling of men consid-

evidence and support these recommendations.
Inappropriately decreasing the use of vasectomy as a 
form of contraception because of concerns related to pros-
tate cancer would be a disservice to both men and women.

costs about one third of those for tubal ligation.58  Further-
more, compared with vasectomy, tubal ligation is 20 
times more likely to have associated major complications, 
such as haemorrhage, infection, ectopic pregnancy, and 
injury to adjacent organs.58  Although procedure related 
mortality is rare, tubal ligation is about 12 times more 
likely to be associated with death compared with vasec-
tomy.58 These differences are particularly important in 
developing countries, where risks associated with sterili-
sation procedures might be even greater.
strengths and limitations of this study
Our study has several strengths. Firstly, we used a popu-
lation based approach and therefore included men of all 
ethnicities, socioeconomic status, and with comorbidi-
ties, thereby minimising selection bias. Furthermore, 
because healthcare is publically administered in Ontario, 
all patients had universal access to healthcare services 
and cancer related screening. Secondly, we relied on vali-
dated, comprehensive databases,40-42  whereas most stud-
ies on this topic have relied on interviews and 
questionnaires. Thirdly, we were able to minimise detec-
tion bias by controlling for various kinds of interactions 
with healthcare services throughout the study period. 
Indeed, our sensitivity analysis suggests that the unad-
justed analysis showing a positive association between 
vasectomy and risk of prostate cancer might have been 
driven by interactions with health services in the year 
before the index date. This suggests that those undergo-
ing a vasectomy are more likely to undergo screening for 
prostate cancer before undergoing the procedure itself, as 
has been shown previously.26 Accordingly, this baseline 
screening might have led to risk adjusted monitoring of 
patients in the vasectomy group, resulting in increased 
detection of prostate  
cancer. Finally, the results of our pre-
specified tracer analysis evaluating incident non-Hod-
gkin’s lymphoma, a cancer unrelated to the urinary tract 
or androgen levels and where no association with vasec-
tomy would be expected, further support our findings.
Some limitations of our study merit emphasis. Firstly, 
although administrative data provide the advantage of 
studying large populations, these databases are not 
designed for clinical research, and some degree of out-
come misclassification is likely. The databases used in 
this study, however, have been independently validated 
for cancer related outcomes.40 41 Secondly, we were 
unable to account for possible differences in testing for 
prostate specific antigen between groups; our results, 
however, suggest that the use of surrogate cancer 
screening tests might have accounted for this, as shown 
by the strong associations between colorectal cancer 
screening tests and incident prostate cancer. Thirdly, 
data on prostate cancer grade and stage were incom-
plete. Fourthly, certain risk factors for prostate cancer, 
such as family history, ethnicity, dietary factors, use of 
5-α reductase inhibitors, and ejaculatory frequency 
cannot be obtained through administrative data. 
 
However, there is no reason to anticipate that these 
would be differentially distributed across groups. 
Finally, longer follow-up would have permitted ascer-
tainment of more cases of prostate cancer. This limita-
tion applies to both the vasectomy group and the 
non-vasectomy group and we attempted to mitigate this 
limitation by performing sensitivity analyses of those 
with follow-up at least to age 50 and 60, and found sim-
ilar associations to those of our primary analysis. 
Despite these limitations, our study is the largest to date 
to evaluate the association between vasectomy and 
prostate cancer and found no statistically significant 
association between vasectomy and prostate cancer 
related risk, grade, stage, or mortality.
Conclusion
The findings of this study show that vasectomy does not 
seem to be independently associated with prostate 
 
cancer. These results support the use of vasectomy as a 
safe method of contraception in men.
