Summary
Background Huntington’s disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene, HTT. Age at onset has 
been used as a quantitative phenotype in genetic analysis looking for Huntington’s disease modifiers, but is hard to 
define and not always available. Therefore, we aimed to generate a novel measure of disease progression and to 
identify genetic markers associated with this progression measure.
Methods We generated a progression score on the basis of principal component analysis of prospectively acquired 
longitudinal changes in motor, cognitive, and imaging measures in the 218 indivduals in the TRACK-HD cohort of 
Huntington’s disease gene mutation carriers (data collected 2008–11). We generated a parallel progression score 
using data from 1773 previously genotyped participants from the European Huntington’s Disease Network REGISTRY 
study of Huntington’s disease mutation carriers (data collected 2003–13). We did a genome-wide association analyses 
in terms of progression for 216 TRACK-HD participants and 1773 REGISTRY participants, then a meta-analysis of 
these results was undertaken. 
Findings Longitudinal motor, cognitive, and imaging scores were correlated with each other in TRACK-HD 
participants, justifying use of a single, cross-domain measure of disease progression in both studies. The TRACK-HD 
and REGISTRY progression measures were correlated with each other (r=0·674), and with age at onset (TRACK-HD, 
r=0·315; REGISTRY, r=0·234). The meta-analysis of progression in TRACK-HD and REGISTRY gave a genome-wide 
significant signal (p=1·12 × 10–¹⁰) on chromosome 5 spanning three genes: MSH3, DHFR, and MTRNR2L2. The 
genes in this locus were associated with progression in TRACK-HD (MSH3 p=2·94 × 10–⁸, DHFR p=8·37 × 10–⁷, 
MTRNR2L2 p=2·15 × 10–⁹) and to a lesser extent in REGISTRY (MSH3 p=9·36 × 10–⁴, DHFR p=8·45 × 10–⁴, MTRNR2L2 
p=1·20 × 10–³). The lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TRACK-HD (rs557874766) was genome-wide 
significant in the meta-analysis (p=1·58 × 10–⁸), and encodes an aminoacid change (Pro67Ala) in MSH3. In TRACK-
HD, each copy of the minor allele at this SNP was associated with a 0·4 units per year (95% CI 0·16–0·66) reduction 
in the rate of change of the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Motor Score, and a reduction 
of 0·12 units per year (95% CI 0·06–0·18) in the rate of change of UHDRS Total Functional Capacity score. These 
associations remained significant after adjusting for age of onset.
Interpretation The multidomain progression measure in TRACK-HD was associated with a functional variant that 
was genome-wide significant in our meta-analysis. The association in only 216 participants implies that the 
progression measure is a sensitive reflection of disease burden, that the effect size at this locus is large, or both. 
Knockout of Msh3 reduces somatic expansion in Huntington’s disease mouse models, suggesting this mechanism as 
an area for future therapeutic investigation.

Introduction
Huntington’s disease is an autosomal dominant fatal 
neurodegenerative condition caused by a CAG repeat 
expansion in huntingtin gene, HTT.1 It is a movement, 
cognitive, and psychiatric disorder, but symptoms, age of 
disease onset, and disease progression vary.2 Age of onset 
reflects the trajectory of disease pathology up to the point 
of motor onset.1,3 However, the transition from premanifest 
to manifest Huntington’s disease is gradual,4,5 making 
clinical definition challenging. Furthermore, psychiatric 
and cognitive changes might not be concurrent with motor 
onset.6 Despite this imprecision in defining onset, the 
inverse correlation of HTT CAG repeat length and age at 
motor onset accounts for 50–70% of the observed variance 
in onset.7 Part of the remaining difference in age of onset 
was also recently shown to be genetically encoded, and 
genes of the DNA damage response were identified as 
being likely to modify onset of Huntington’s disease.8
The need for clinical trials close to disease onset has 
motivated a number of observational studies.5,9,10 These 
new data provide the opportunity to investigate the 
association between onset and progression and whether

they are influenced by the same biology, and permit the 
study of individuals before clinical onset. TRACK-HD5,6 
was a prospective, observational, biomarker study that 
represents the most deeply phenotyped cohort of people 
with premanifest and symptomatic Huntington’s disease, 
with annual visits involving motor, cognitive, psychiatric 
and imaging assessments. We used TRACK-HD data5,6 to 
generate a novel unified Huntington’s disease progression 
measure for use in a genetic association analysis. We 
developed a similar measure in participants from the 
REGISTRY study9 to replicate our findings. We used these 
disease progression measures as quantitative variables in 
genome-wide association analyses of the TRACK-HD and 
REGISTRY data, and aimed to replicate this finding in a 
meta-analysis.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this genome-wide association study, we examined 
prospective data from TRACK-HD to develop a measure 
of disease progression reflecting correlated progression 
on brain imaging, motor, and cognitive symptom 
domains. We used this disease progression measure as a 
quantitative variable in a genome-wide association study 
to identify associated genetic loci, and aimed to replicate 
this finding by generating a parallel progression measure 
in the less intensively phenotyped REGISTRY study.
TRACK-HD5,6 was a prospective, observational study 
collecting deep phenotypic data, including imaging, 
quantitative motor, and cognitive assessments, from 
adults with early Huntington’s disease, premanifest 
Huntington’s disease gene carriers, and controls 
(figure 1). It provides annually collected multivariate data 
for 3 years (2008–11), with 243 participants at baseline.6 
Demographic details of these individuals are in the 
appendix.
REGISTRY9 was a multisite, prospective, observational 
study, which collected phenotypic data  (2003–13) for 
more than 13 000 participants, mostly Huntington’s 
disease gene carriers with manifest disease (figure 1). 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Huntington’s disease is caused by a tract of 36 or more CAG 
repeats in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene, HTT. Genetic modifiers 
of age at motor onset have been identified that highlight 
pathways which, if modulated in people, might delay 
Huntington’s disease onset. Onset of disease is preceded by a 
long prodromal phase accompanied by substantial brain cell 
death; age at motor onset is difficult to assess accurately and is 
not available in disease-free at-risk individuals. We searched 
PubMed, for English language articles published until 
Oct 31, 2016, with the search terms “Huntington* disease” AND 
“genetic modifier” AND “onset”, which identified 13 studies. We 
then searched for “Huntington* disease” AND “genetic modifier” 
AND “progression”, which identified one review article. Among 
the 13 studies of genetic modification of Huntington’s disease 
onset, most were small candidate gene studies; these were 
superseded by the one large study of genome-wide genetic 
modifiers of Huntington’s disease, which identified 
three genome-wide significant loci, one on chromosome 8 and 
two on chromosome 15, these are thought likely to be associated 
with RRM2B and FAN1, respectively. This study also implicated 
DNA handling in Huntington’s disease modification.
Added value of this study
We examined the prospective data from TRACK-HD and 
developed a measure of disease progression that reflected 
correlated progression in the brain imaging, motor, and 
cognitive symptom domains. We used the disease progression 
measure as a quantitative variable in a genome-wide association 
study and detected a locus on chromosome 5 containing 
three significant genes, MTRNR2L2, MSH3, and DHFR. The index 
variant encodes an aminoacid change in MSH3. We replicated 
this finding by generating a parallel progression measure in the 
less intensively phenotyped REGISTRY study and detected a 
similar signal on chromosome 5 that is probably attributable to 
the same variants. A meta-analysis of the two studies 
strengthened the associations. The progression measures and 
age of onset were correlated, but this was not responsible for 
the genetic association with disease progression. We also 
detected a signal on chromosome 15 in the REGISTRY study at 
the locus previously associated with age of onset. 
Implications of all the available evidence
The progression measures used in this study can be generated in 
asymptomatic and symptomatic participants using a subset of 
the clinically relevant parameters gathered in TRACK-HD. We 
used these measures to identify genetic modifiers of disease 
progression in Huntington’s disease. We identified a signal in 
only 216 participants, which was replicated in a larger sample 
and strengthened in the meta-analysis, reducing the chance of it 
being a false positive.  This finding argues for the power of 
improving phenotypic measures in genetic studies and implies 
that this locus has a large effect on disease progression. The 
index associated genetic variant in TRACK-HD encodes a 
Pro67Ala change in MSH3, which implicates MSH3 as the 
associated gene on chromosome 5. Altering levels of Msh3 in 
Huntington’s disease mouse models reduces somatic instability 
and crossing Msh3 null mice with Huntington’s disease mouse 
models prevents somatic instability of the HTT CAG repeat and 
reduces pathological phenotypes. Polymorphisms in MSH3 have 
been linked to somatic instability in patients with myotonic 
dystrophy type 1. MSH3 is a non-essential neuronally expressed 
member of the DNA mismatch repair pathway and these data 
reinforce its candidacy as a therapeutic target in Huntington’s 
disease and potentially in other neurodegenerative expanded 
repeat disorders.

The study aimed for annual assessments (every 
9–15 months), although in practice assessment dates 
were variable. The core data included age, CAG repeat 
length, Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale 
(UHDRS) total motor score (TMS), and total functional 
capacity (TFC); some patients had further assessments, 
such as a cognitive battery.9 We included 1835 adult 
participants from REGISTRY in this study on the basis 
of available genotype data.8 We obtained TMS, symbol 
digit modality, verbal fluency, Stroop colour reading, 
word reading and interference measures, functional 
assessment score, and TFC.
All experiments were done in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the University 
College London (UCL)/UCL Hospitals Joint Research 
Ethics Committee; ethical approval for the REGISTRY 
analysis is outlined by the Genetic Modifiers of 
Huntington’s Disease (GeM-HD) Consortium.8 Peripheral 
blood samples were donated by genetically confirmed 
Huntington’s disease gene carriers, and all participants 
provided informed written consent before study entry. 
Procedures
For both studies, we derived atypical severity scores 
with a combination of principal component analysis 
(PCA) and regression of the predictable effects of the 
primary gene HTT CAG repeat length. Details differed, 
however, owing to differences in nature of the 
two datasets. In TRACK-HD, 24 variables were used to 
stratify the cohort in terms of disease progression 
(appendix). These variables were divided a priori into 
three broad domains: brain volume measures, cognitive 
variables, and quantitative motor variables. For each 
variable, the input for analysis was the participant’s 
random longitudinal slope from a mixed effects 
regression model with correlated random intercepts 
and slopes for each participant. This model regressed 
the observed values on a clinical probability of onset 
statistic derived from CAG repeat length and age, and 
its interaction with follow-up length. The participants’ 
random slope estimates thus provided a measure of 
atypical longitudinal change not predicted by age and 
CAG repeat length. We then used PCA of the random 
slopes to study the dimensionality of the longitudinal 
changes corrected for age and CAG repeat length. 
Further detail about the methods, including control for 
potential demographic confounders, is in the appendix 
and figure 1.
For REGISTRY, by contrast with TRACK-HD, follow-
up length and frequency were variable and missing

data were substantial, making longitudinal progression 
analysis problematic. We therefore examined cross-
sectional status at last visit, using a single unified 
motor-cognitive dimension of severity. We did multiple 
imputation to fill in missing data, derived PCA severity 
scores and regressed off the predictive effect of age, 
CAG length, and sex on the PCA severity scores derived 
from these data to obtain the measure of atypical 
severity at the last visit. This gave a single point severity 
score based on how advanced a participant was 
compared with expect 
ations based on their CAG repeat 
length and age. 1773 participants had adequate 
phenotypic data to score; further detail is in the 
appendix and figure 1.
Statistical and genetic analysis
We did data analyses using SAS/STAT version 14.0 and 
14.1, mainly via the MIXED, FACTOR, and GML 
procedures. We occasionally used a log or inverse 
transform of a measure, with the goal to improve 
approximate normality of the distribution and avoid 
inappropriate influence of extreme scores.
We genotyped 218 TRACK-HD study participants with 
complete serial phenotype data on Illumina Omni2.5v1.1 
arrays, and we did quality control measures as described 
in the appendix. We carried out imputation using the 
1000 Genomes phase 3 data as a reference (appendix). 
This 
yielded 
9·65 
million 
biallelic 
markers 
of 
216 individuals. We obtained genotypes for the 
REGISTRY participants from the GeM-HD Consortium 
(for details of their genotyping, quality control, curation, 
and imputation see reference 8).
We did association analyses with the mixed linear 
model (MLM) functions in Genome-wide Complex 
Trait Analysis (GCTA) version 1.26.11 We did conditional 
analyses using the COJO procedure in GCTA. Because 
of the relatively small sample sizes, we restricted 
analyses to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) 
with minor allele frequency of more than 1%. We did a 
meta-analysis of the TRACK-HD and REGISTRY 
associations using METAL.12 To test whether the 
association signals in TRACK-HD and REGISTRY 
could have arisen from the same causal SNPs, and 
whether these also influenced expression, we did 
colocalisation analysis using GWAS-pw version 0.21.13 
We calculated gene-wide p values using Multiobjective 
Analyzer for Genetic Marker Acquisition (MAGMA) 
version 1.05, a powerful alternative to SNP-based 
analyses, which aggregates the association signal inside 
genes while taking linkage disequilibrium between 
SNPs into account,14 using a window of 35 kb upstream 
and 10 kb downstream of genes.15 Such an analysis can 
increase power over single SNP analysis when there are 
multiple causal SNPs in a gene, or when the causal 
SNP is not typed and its signal is partially captured by 
multiple typed SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with it. 
To maximise comparability with the GeM-HD genome-
wide association study (GWAS), our primary pathway 
analyses used Setscreen,16 which sums the log p values 
of all SNPs in a pathway, also correcting for linkage 
disequilibrium between SNPs.
All methods and analyses are described in more detail 
in the appendix.
Role of the funding source
The funders of this study and of the TRACK-HD and 
REGISTRY studies had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding authors had full access to 
all the data in the study and had final responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
In the analysis of variables from TRACK-HD, we did 
individual principal compenent analyses of each domain 
and found that the first principal component scores were 
highly correlated between the domains (p<0·0001 in all 
cases, appendix). We observed no phenotypic subtypes of 
symptom clusters in motor, cognitive, or imaging 
domains; rather, longitudinal change in TRACK-HD not 
predictable by CAG repeat length and age was distributed 
on a correlated continuum (figure 2). We therefore 
repeated PCA of the measures combined across all 
domains. The first principal component of this combined 
analysis accounted for 23·4% of the joint variance, and 
was at least moderately correlated (r>0·4) with most of 
the variables that contributed heavily to each domain-
specific first principal component (appendix). The first 
psychiatric principal component had notably lower 
correlations with motor and cognitive domains and 
clinical probability of onset than the inter-correlations 
seen among these three measures, so was excluded from 
our progression measures.
The cross-domain first principal component was used 
as a unified Huntington’s disease progression measure 
in the TRACK-HD cohort (figures 1, 2). To confirm that 
our progression measure correlated with commonly 
recognised measures of Huntington’s disease severity 
not included in the progression analysis, we examined 
the 
residual 
change 
relationships 
between 
the 
progression score and UHDRS TMS change and TFC 
change after controlling for the clinical probability of 
onset statistic. We found a correlation of r=0·448 
(p<0·0001) for the residual motor slope and r=–0·421 
(p<0·0001) for the residual TFC slope. One unit increase 
in unified Huntington’s disease progression measure 
corresponded to an increase of 0·71 units per year 
(95% CI 0·34–1·08) in the rate of change of TMS, and 
an increase of approximately 0·2 units per year 
(0·12–0·30) in the rate of change of TFC. The 15 fastest 
progressing participants in TRACK-HD showed a mean 
annual rate of decline in the UHDRS TMS of 2·52 more 
points per year than predicted by age and CAG length 
(SD 2·47, SEM 0·64); the 15 slowest progressing

5
participants had a mean annual TMS decline of 
0·45 points less per year than would be expected 
(SD 1·85, SEM 0·48).
Participants in the early stages of Huntington’s disease 
had significantly faster progression on the unified 
Huntington’s disease progression measure than did 
those still in the premanifest phase (p<0·0001). Among 
the 96 participants who had experienced onset, the age of 
onset as defined by a rater showed the expected 
association with predicted age of onset based on CAG 
length (appendix), and earlier than predicted age of onset 
was correlated with faster progression on our unified 
Huntington’s disease progression measure (r=0·315; 
p=0·002).
The 
unified 
Huntington’s 
disease 
progression 
measure developed in TRACK-HD could not be 
transferred directly to REGISTRY participants, for 
whom more limited data were available. Individual 
clinical measures in REGISTRY showed correlations 
across the motor, cognitive, and functional domains, 
consistent with our finding in TRACK-HD (appendix). 
The first principal component accounted for 75·6% of 
the variance in severity; no other principal components 
explained any substantial amount of the common 
variance within the measures used (appendix). 
Therefore this first principal component was chosen as 
a measure of severity in the REGISTRY cohort (figure 2). 
Higher values of this measure mean greater severity 
than expected at a given time; we infer that this is the 
result of faster progression (figure 2), and we used this 
measure as the unified REGISTRY progression 
measure. This progression measure and earlier than 
predicted age of onset were modestly correlated 
(r=0·234; p<0·0001; appendix). Atypically, rapidly or 
slowly progressing participants tended to become more 
atypical over time: given that correlation between time 
since disease onset and REGISTRY progression 
(r=–0·307; p<0·0001) was greater than that between age 
of onset and REGISTRY progression.
In TRACK-HD, the last-visit severity scores had a 
correlation of r=0·674 with the previously calculated 
longitudinal unified progression measure, indicating 
that our progression measures for TRACK-HD and 
REGISTRY reflected strongly, although not perfectly, 
related elements of clinical phenotype. Further support 
for this conclusion was given by the correlation of 
r=0·631 between the TRACK-HD and REGISTRY 
progression measures in the 14 participants present in 
both studies.
A genome-wide association analysis using the unified 
TRACK-HD progression measure as a quantitative trait 
yielded a significantly associated locus on chromosome 5 
spanning DHFR, MSH3, and MTRNR2L2. The index 
SNP rs557874766 is a coding missense variant in 
MSH3 (p=5·8 × 10–⁸; allele frequency G=0·2179/1091 
[1000 Genomes]; figure 3 and appendix). Analyses 
conditioning on this SNP failed to show evidence for a 
second independent signal in this region in TRACK-HD 
(appendix). The genes in this locus were the only ones to 
reach the commonly accepted genome-wide significance 
criterion (p<2·5 × 10–⁸)17 for gene-wide tests in the

significance, although there was evidence of association 
(at DHFR (p=8·45 × 10–), MSH3 (p=9·36 × 10–), and 
MTRNR2L2 (p=1·20 × 10–).
The meta-analysis of TRACK-HD and REGISTRY 
strengthened the signal of both individual SNPs in this 
region, encompassing the first three exons of MSH3 
along with DHFR and MTRNR2L2 (figure 4, appendix), 
and also gene-wide associations over MSH3, DHFR, and 
MTRNR2L2 in the MAGMA analysis. The most 
significant SNP in the meta-analysis was rs1232027, 
which was genome-wide significant (p=1·12 × 10–¹⁰); the 
p value of rs557874766 is 1·58 × 10–⁸. No other regions 
attained genome-wide significance. rs557874766 was 
nominally significant in REGISTRY (p=0·010), with a 
direction of effect consistent with that in TRACK-HD. 
Analyses conditional on rs1232027 largely removed the 
association in this region (appendix), suggesting that 
there is only one signal. Conditioning on rs557874766 
had a similar effect (appendix), so this SNP remains a 
plausible causal variant.
As suggested by the meta-analysis, colocalisation 
analyses between TRACK-HD and REGISTRY showed 
that this locus was probably influenced by the same 
SNPs in both studies (posterior probability 74·33%), 
although conditioning REGISTRY on rs55787466 did 
not remove the association signal entirely (appendix). 
Colocalisation analyses with the GTeX (Genotype-Tissue 
Expression) expression data21 showed strong evidence 
(posterior probability 96–99%) that SNPs influencing 
progression in TRACK-HD were also expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for DHFR in brain and 
peripheral tissues (appendix). Conversely, there was 
strong evidence (posterior probability 98%) that 
progression SNPs in REGISTRY were eQTLs for MSH3 
in blood and fibroblasts (appendix). Despite the lack of 
(or low) colocalisation between the TRACK-HD GWAS

and MSH3 expression signals, several of the most 
significant GWAS SNPs were associated with reduced 
MSH3 expression and slower progression (appendix). 
Thus, the signal on chromosome 5 could be due to the 
coding change in MSH3, or to expression changes in 
MSH3, DHFR, or both, and both effects might operate 
in disease.
The second most significant association region in 
REGISTRY (appendix) tags a locus on chromosome 15 
that has been previously associated with age of onset for 
Huntington’s disease.8 Five genes were highlighted, two of 
which reached the commonly accepted genome-wide 
significance criterion for gene-wide tests in the MAGMA 
analysis (MTMR10 p=2·51 × 10–⁷; FAN1 p=2·35 × 10–⁶). 
Notably, MLH1 on chromosome 3 contains SNPs 
approaching genome-wide significant associations with 
age of onset (p=2·2 × 10–⁷) in GeM-HD,8 and also shows 
association in the REGISTRY progression gene-wide 
analysis (p=3·97 × 10–⁴).
Both progression measures were correlated with age 
of onset. Thus, to test whether there is genetic 
association with progression independent of age of 
onset, we repeated the REGISTRY progression GWAS 
conditioning for the age of onset measure previously 
associated with this locus in GeM-HD in the 
1314 individuals for whom we had measures of both 
progression and age of onset. Both MTMR10 
(p=1·33 × 10–⁵) and FAN1 (p=1·68 × 10–⁴) remained 
significant. Furthermore, the most significant SNP 
(rs10611148, p=2·84 × 10–⁷) was still significant after 
conditioning on age of onset (p=2·40 × 10–⁵). Notably, 
the gene-wide associations at the MSH3 locus in the 
TRACK-HD sample also remained significant after 
correcting for age of onset, as did the association with 
rs557874766 (p=6·30 × 10–⁶). A similar pattern was 
observed at the MSH3 locus in the meta-analysis. Thus, 
the associations reported here are mainly due to disease 
progression, rather than age of onset.
Gene set analysis of the 14 pathways highlighted by 
the GeM-HD study,8 showed that the four biological 
pathways which are most significantly associated with 
disease progression in the TRACK-HD progression 
GWAS were associated with DNA mismatch repair, and 
all these pathways also showed significant enrichment 
of signal in the REGISTRY progression analysis. This 
enrichment was strengthened in the meta-analysis 
(table). Notably, the top two pathways in TRACK-HD 
were also significant in the MAGMA competitive gene-
set analysis (GO: 32300, p=0·010; KEGG: 3430, 
p=0·00697). 
MSH3 
(p=2·94 × 10–⁸) 
and 
POLD2 
(p=7·21 × 10–⁴) show association in TRACK-HD, with 
MSH3 (p=9·52 × 10–⁴) and MLH1 (p=3·97 × 10–⁴) showing 
association in REGISTRY (appendix). These findings 
are supported by analysis of DNA damage response 
pathways derived from Pearl and colleagues22 (figure 4, 
appendix), in which two mismatch repair pathways 
were significantly associated with the unified TRACK-
HD progression measure after correction for multiple 
testing 
of 
pathways. 
Again, 
the 
meta-analysis 
strengthens the enrichment (figure 4, appendix). Genes 
from the two significant pathways in TRACK-HD are 
shown in the appendix, with the significant genes being 
very similar to those from the GeM-HD pathways 
(appendix). A complete list of genes in the Pearl and 
colleagues22 pathways is given in the additional data on 
our institutional website.

Discussion
The evidence from our study suggests that MSH3 
is probably a modifier of disease progression in 
Huntington’s disease. We did an unbiased genetic screen 
using a novel disease progression measure in the 
TRACK-HD study, and identified a significant locus on 
chromosome 5, which encompasses three genes: 
MTRNR2L2, MSH3, and DHFR. This locus replicated in 
an independent group of participants from the European 
Huntington’s disease REGISTRY study using a parallel 
disease progression measure, and was genome-wide 
significant in a meta-analysis of the two studies. The lead 
SNP in TRACK-HD, rs557874766, is a coding variant in 
MSH3; it is classed of moderate impact, making it 
genome-wide significant given its annotation.23 This SNP 
became clearly genome-wide significant at the more 
widely used threshold of p=5 × 10–⁸ in our meta-analysis 
of TRACK-HD and REGISTRY. Furthermore, eQTL 
analyses showed association of lower MSH3 expression 
with slower disease progression in our analyses.
Genetic modifiers of disease in people highlight 
pathways for therapeutic development; any pathway 
containing 
genetic 
variation 
that 
ameliorates 
or 
exacerbates disease forms a prevalidated relevant target. 
However, although the classic case-control design in 
complex disease has yielded multiple genetic associations 
highlighting relevant biology for novel treatment design,24 
studies of potential genetic modifiers in genetically 
simple Mendelian diseases have been difficult. Such 
diseases are rare and show gene and locus heterogeneity, 
thus finding genuine modifying associations in such a 
noisy background is inherently difficult. However, 
variants that modify disease in the context of a Mendelian 
causative gene might not be under negative selection 
pressure in the general population. Modifiers have been 
identified in specific genetic subtypes of disease25 and in 
relatively large samples with consistent clinical data.8,26
One way to increase the power of genetic studies is to 
obtain a more accurate measure of phenotype. Prospective 
multivariate longitudinal measures such as those collected 
in TRACK-HD are ideal.27 Our analysis of Huntington’s 
disease progression showed that motor, cognitive, and 
brain imaging variables typically progress in parallel, and 
that patterns of loss are not sufficiently distinct to be 
considered subphenotypes for genetic analysis. Because 
psychiatric symptoms showed a different trajectory, we 
developed a single progression measure excluding the 
psychiatric data (figure 2). Age of onset was correlated 
with the unified progression measure but did not explain 
the genetic associations observed with progression. Thus, 
progression seems to be measuring a different aspect of 
disease to age of onset, or a similar aspect of disease, but 
with greater precision. The data available in REGISTRY 
are less comprehensive than in TRACK-HD; therefore we 
used a different approach by comparing cross-sectional 
severity at the most recent visit with that expected based 
on age and CAG repeat length. The unified progression 
measures in TRACK-HD and REGISTRY are correlated 
and again, the genetic associations in REGISTRY are not 
completely driven by age of onset, showing the usefulness 
of retrospective composite progression scores in genetic 
analysis. Prognostic indices for motor onset have been 
developed,28 and the development of progression scores 
for prospective use, for example to stratify patients by 
predicted rate of progression to empower drug trials, 
warrants further attention.
Our study has limitations. TRACK-HD has the same 
standardised detailed phenotypic information on nearly 
all participants, but in only 243 participants carrying the 
Huntington’s disease gene mutations. The REGISTRY 
study is much larger but the phenotypic data are less 
complete (appendix), often not collected at regular 
intervals and not on everyone in the study, and the data 
were collected in multiple centres, which will inevitably 
lead to variation. Nevertheless, the progression measures 
show the expected association with change in TMS and 
TFC in both TRACK-HD and REGISTRY, indicating 
their clinical relevance. However, future development of 
the progression statistic and confirmation of the genetic 
association in participants from ongoing large studies 
such as ENROLL,29 with data collected more systematically 
than in REGISTRY but in less detail than TRACK-HD, 
would be ideal.
The locus we identified by use of the unified TRACK-
HD progression measure included three genes, but 
MSH3 is the best candidate. First, the lead SNP is a 
coding variant in exon 1 of MSH3, MSH3 Pro67Ala, with 
the potential to affect function.30 Clinically, each copy of 
the minor allele (G) at this SNP corresponds to a decrease 
of about 0·4 units per year (95% CI 0·16–0·66) in the rate 
of change of TMS, and a reduction of about 0·12 units 
per year (95% CI 0·06–0·18) in the rate of change of TFC 
(appendix). Second, MSH3 has been extensively 
implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease in 
both mouse and in-vitro studies, although this is the 
first human study to link MSH3 to Huntington’s disease. 
MSH3 is a neuronally expressed member of a family of 
DNA mismatch repair proteins;31 it forms a heteromeric 
complex with MSH2 to form MutSβ, which recognises 
insertion-deletion loops of up to 13 nucleotides (figure 4).32 
There is, however, a high level of interconnectedness 
between pathways involved in the DNA damage response, 
and MutSβ is implicated in other processes.19 Changes in 
CAG repeat size occur in terminally differentiated 
neurons in several Huntington’s disease mouse models 
and in human patient striatum, the brain area most 
affected in Huntington’s disease, and, notably, somatic 
expansion of the CAG repeat in the brain of patients with 
Huntington’s disease predicts onset.33 Msh3 is required 
both for somatic expansion of HTT CAG repeats and for 
enhancing an early disease phenotype in mouse 
striatum,34 Msh3 expression level is associated with repeat 
instability in mouse brain (whereas Dhfr is not),32 and 
expansion of CAG and CTG repeats is prevented by

msh3Δ in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.35 This is a plausible 
mechanism through which variation in MSH3 could 
operate in Huntington’s disease (figure 4). In patients 
with myotonic dystrophy type 1, somatic instability of the 
CTG repeat (CAG on the non-coding strand), is associated 
with age of onset and an MSH3 variant was recently 
associated with somatic instability in blood DNA of 
patients.36 Variants in DNA repair pathways, including 
those in MSH3, contribute to age of onset modification in 
multiple CAG repeat expansion diseases,37 implicating 
the CAG repeat itself as the source of modification.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to use a measure 
of progression to look for modifiers of a neurodegenerative 
Mendelian disorder. We detected association with a 
coding variant on chromosome 5, reaching genome-wide 
significance given its annotation24 in just 216 participants, 
which was replicated in a larger independent sample and 
strengthened on meta-analysis. This indicates that our 
progression measure developed in TRACK-HD is an 
excellent 
reflection 
of 
disease 
pathophysiological 
progression, or that this is a locus with a large effect size, 
or, most likely, both. Although there are three genes at the 
locus, the most significant variant gives a coding change 
in MSH3, which together with the previous biological 
evidence makes it the most likely candidate. Somatic 
expansion of the CAG repeat through alterations in 
MSH3 is a plausible mechanism for pathogenesis in 
Huntington’s disease, which can be followed up in 
functional experiments in Huntington’s disease models. 
These data provide additional support for the therapeutic 
targeting of HTT and the stability of its CAG repeat. Loss 
of, or variation in, mismatch repair complexes can cause 
malignancy and thus they are not regarded as ideal drug 
targets, but MSH3 is not essential because it can tolerate 
loss-of-function variation38 and could provide a therapeutic 
target in Huntington’s disease. We note that if MSH3 
does operate to alter repeat expansion it might also be a 
drug target in other repeat expansion disorders.
