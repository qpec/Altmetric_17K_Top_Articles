Abstract
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) underlies higher cognitive processes1 that are modulated by nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activation by cholinergic inputs2. PFC spontaneous default 
activity3 is altered in neuropsychiatric disorders4, including schizophrenia5—a disorder that can be 
accompanied by heavy smoking6. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human CHRNA5 gene, encoding the α5 nAChR 
subunit, that increase the risks for both smoking and schizophrenia7,8. Mice with altered nAChR 
gene function exhibit PFC-dependent behavioral deficits9–11, but it is unknown how the 
corresponding human polymorphisms alter the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying 
behavior. Here we show that mice expressing a human α5SNP exhibit neurocognitive behavioral 
deficits in social interaction and sensorimotor gating tasks. Two-photon calcium imaging in awake 
mouse models showed that nicotine can differentially influence PFC pyramidal cell activity by

 nAChR modulation of layer II/III hierarchical inhibitory circuits. In α5-SNP-expressing and α5-
knockout mice, lower activity of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) interneurons resulted in 
an increased somatostatin (SOM) interneuron inhibitory drive over layer II/III pyramidal neurons. 
The decreased activity observed in α5-SNP-expressing mice resembles the hypofrontality 
observed in patients with psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and addiction5,12. Chronic 
nicotine administration reversed this hypofrontality, suggesting that administration of nicotine may 
represent a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of schizophrenia, and a physiological basis for 
the tendency of patients with schizophrenia to self-medicate by smoking13.
Impairment of cognitive processes that are critically reliant on the PFC is a signature of 
schizophrenia5 and is associated with low activity of the default mode network3. However, 
the cellular and circuit deficits underlying ‘hypofrontality’ remain unexplored. Because 
acetylcholine (ACh) release results in strong modulation of cortical activity via 
nAChRs14–16, it is not surprising that human nAChR gene variants are strongly linked to 
mental disorders with cognitive deficits17. Genetic variants within the CHRNA3–CHRNA5–
CHRNB4 nAChR gene cluster contribute to the risk of habitual smoking7. Among the series 
of polymorphisms composing this human haplotype, the rs16969968 SNP leads to the 
substitution of aspartic acid at residue 398 by asparagine (D398N) in the human α5 
subunit18. Both in vitro and ex vivo studies indicate that this SNP results in partial loss of 
function of α5-containing nAChRs18,19. In humans, this SNP is associated with reduced 
resting-state functional connectivity, and circuits involving the PFC are altered12.
Recently, the same genetic locus was associated with schizophrenia in a major GWAS8, but 
it is not yet clear whether this SNP is responsible for the hypofrontality observed in 
individuals with schizophrenia, which would directly implicate altered nicotinic signaling in 
this pathophysiology of schizophrenia. One obstacle preventing further mechanistic 
dissection of schizophrenia is the absence of animal models. Because genetic deletion of the 
α5 nicotinic subunit in mice leads to PFC-linked behavioral deficits, altered cholinergic 
excitation and aberrant neuronal morphology in the PFC20, we developed a mouse line 
expressing the human α5 variant to investigate the impact of this variant on behaviors 
associated with schizophrenia and to determine the neuronal and circuitry mechanisms 
underlying cognitive deficits.
Research on social cognition suggests that social interaction deficits, similar to emotional 
dysfunctions, represent characteristic markers of psychiatric disorders21. Because impaired 
social ability is a common feature of schizophrenia21, we used the three-chamber social 
test22 to determine whether α5-SNP-expressing (α5SNP) mice exhibit impairments in social 
interaction. The results indicated that α5SNP mice have deficits in sociability. Wild-type 
(WT) mice exhibited a clear preference for a novel social partner, spending 69.6 ± 2.9% of 
their time engaged in social interaction, while α5SNP littermates showed no preference 
between the social partner and an inanimate object (44.1 ± 5.3%) (Fig. 1a). The differences 
in social interaction cannot be attributed to the effects of differing genotypes on activity or 
general exploratory behavior because the WT and α5SNP mice did not differ in locomotor 
activity or combined time in the social and inanimate object interaction areas (Fig. 1a and 
Supplementary Discussion).

 Deficiencies in the prepulse inhibition (PPI) task are a measure of impaired sensorimotor 
gating and are observed in several human neuropsychiatric disorders23. The PPI task 
measures the ability of an animal to inhibit its startle in response to an acoustic tone (pulse) 
when the tone is preceded by a lower-intensity stimulus (prepulse). Examination of PPI has 
been particularly important in studying the neurobiology of schizophrenia because deficits in 
cognitive information gating are a clinically important feature of the disorder23. There is a 
high degree of similarity between measures of PPI in rodent models and humans, which is in 
accordance with the use of PPI as a cross-species measure of sensorimotor gating23. We 
found that α5SNP mice exhibited decreased PPI across a range of prepulse intensities (4, 8, 
12 and 20 dB above background noise) relative to their WT littermates (Fig. 1b and 
Supplementary Discussion), suggesting that sensorimotor gating is disrupted by the α5 
variant.
To determine the circuit mechanisms underlying the cognitive deficits attributed to 
dysfunction of α5-containing nAChRs and the human SNP, we assessed resting-state 
network activity using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in the prelimbic cortex (PrLC) of 
the PFC in awake mice either lacking the α5 subunit (α5KO mice) or with knock-in of the 
α5 SNP (α5SNP mice) in comparison to WT mice. Neurons were transduced with an adeno-
associated viral vector (AAV) expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator 
GCaMP6f in order to monitor Ca2+ transients as a proxy for action potential firing (Fig. 1c 
and Supplementary Fig. 1). Because we estimate that 80% of the labeled neurons in layers 
II/III are pyramidal neurons (Supplementary Fig. 2), we consider that such experiments 
primarily indicate the activity of the pyramidal neuron population. Interestingly, we found 
that the median frequency and duration of Ca2+ transients were lower in both strains of 
transgenic mice than in WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 3). Spontaneous Ca2+ transients were 
deconvolved with a putative unitary (action potential–evoked) fluorescence response in order 
to estimate neuronal firing rates (Supplementary Figs. 4–6 and Supplementary Table 1). We 
found significantly lower layer II/III neuronal activity in the PrLC of α5KO (8.2 ± 0.5 
spikes/min) and α5SNP (20.3 ± 0.6 spikes/min) mice when compared to WT mice (27.5 
± 0.9 spikes/min; Fig. 1d–f). Thus, loss of function of α5-containing nAChRs causes a 
decrease in layer II/III microcircuit activity, which parallels the decrease in hypofrontality 
that is a defining feature of schizophrenia in humans5.
The α5 subunit is present only in VIP interneurons in layers II/III24, which exert inhibitory 
control of SOM and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the PFC25. Since layer II/III 
pyramidal neurons do not express nAChRs, we hypothesized that loss of function of the α5 
subunit would result in disinhibition of PV and SOM interneurons and, thus, reduced 
pyramidal cell activity (Fig. 1g). Because dendritic-targeting SOM interneurons express 
different nicotinic receptor subtypes, namely α7- and β2-containing nicotinic receptors15,26, 
from perisomatic-targeting PV cells15,27, which exclusively express α7-containing nAChRs, 
we compared PFC activity across transgenic mice with specific deletions of nAChR subunits 
differentially expressed in PV and SOM interneurons. We observed a strong increase in the 
median spike frequency of GCaMP6f-expressing pyramidal neurons in both KO lines, with 
the β2KO line exhibiting the highest frequencies (85 ± 1.1 spikes/min) in comparison to the 
α7KO line (45.9 ± 1.8 spikes/min) and WT mice (27.5 ± 0.9 spikes/min; Fig. 1h–j). Thus,

 the absence of either α7 or β2 subunits in layers II/III increases pyramidal neuron activity; 
this is most likely because of a decrease in the cholinergic drive of interneurons directly 
inhibiting pyramidal neurons.
Because α5 subunits are expressed in cortical layers that were outside of our imaging field 
in layers II/III15, we selectively re-expressed the WT α5 subunit in the PFC layer II/III 
interneurons of α5KO-GADCre mice by using a conditional lentiviral vector (Fig. 2a,b). We 
observed full restoration of pyramidal neuron activity to control levels after re-expression of 
the WT α5 subunit, whereas, when the α5 subunit encoding the human SNP was re-
expressed in α5KO-GADCre mice, pyramidal cell activity was only partially restored, to 
levels between those of control mice and α5KO-GADCre mice (Fig. 2c). Since PV 
interneurons do not express the requisite β2 subunit to form a functional α5-containing 
nAChR, these results may be due to the expression of the α5 subunit in either VIP or SOM 
interneurons. Because the activity in pyramidal neurons is restored, re-expression of α5 in 
VIP interneurons likely represents the dominant effect on the circuit behavior. These data 
indicate that the hypofrontality in α5KO and α5SNP mice can be attributed exclusively to 
an effect on layer II/III GABAergic interneurons.
In addition, because β2 subunits are also expressed in other cortical layers15, we monitored 
pyramidal cell activity in β2KO mice after re-expression of the β2 subunit. WT β2 subunit 
was re-expressed along with tdTomato as a reporter by targeted injection of a β2-IRES2-
tdTomato bicistronic lentiviral vector into layers II/III of the PrLC of β2KO mice (Fig. 2d 
and Supplementary Fig. 7). In the PrLC, only the interneurons in layers II/III express 
nAChR α subunits, and therefore the lentivirus-mediated expression resulted in functional 
nAChRs containing β2 subunits exclusively in interneurons28. We found that the neuronal 
activity of β2KO mice was elevated when compared with that in WT mice, and the re-
expression of WT β2 led to a normalization of activity (Fig. 2e,f and Supplementary Fig. 8). 
These results are consistent with layer II/III re-expression of β2 in SOM and VIP 
interneurons. When considered together, these manipulations demonstrate the critical role of 
layer II/III interneurons in controlling pyramidal neuron activity within the same layer.
Our results thus far suggest that the decrease in VIP activity in α5KO and α5SNP mice 
could result from a dishinhibition of pyramidal cells. To directly examine the influence of 
nicotinic signaling in each interneuron type, we examined the spiking activity of VIP, PV 
and SOM interneurons under conditions of α5 knockdown. We injected VIP-Cre, PV-Cre, or 
SOM-Cre with a Cre-dependent AAV vector to direct expression of GCaMP6f to each of 
these layer II/III interneuron populations. To specifically reduce expression of the α5 
subunit in vivo, we used CRISPR-associated Cas9 endonuclease technology29. We injected 
the mice described above with a lentiviral vector expressing Cas9 and guide RNA (gRNA) 
targeting the Chrna5 gene (LV-CRISPR-α5) in layers II/III of the PFC (Fig. 3a,b). Choice of 
the gRNA sequence and analysis of potential off-target activity by next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) are described in the Supplementary Methods (Off target analysis using 
next generation sequencing). The rate of insertions/deletions was quantified to be 15.5% 
(Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Using the lentiviral vector in 
vivo, we found a strong reduction in the median spike frequency of VIP interneurons in VIP-
Cre mice injected with LV-CRISPR-α5 lentivirus (3.49 ± 0.66 spikes/min) when compared

 to control mice injected with a control non-targeting CRISPR lentiviral vector (21.5 ± 2.17 
spikes/min; Fig. 3c–f and Supplementary Fig. 10). We then examined how reduction of the 
α5 subunit in VIP interneurons could affect the spontaneous activity of PV and SOM 
interneurons, using PV-Cre or SOM-Cre mice together with AAV vectors for Cre-dependent 
expression of GCaMP6f. We did not observe any significant difference in PV-Cre mice 
injected with the LV-CRISPR-α5 lentivirus (6.07 ± 0.60 spikes/min) when compared to 
control mice (5.62 ± 0.45 spikes/min; Fig. 3g–j), which is consistent with weak innervation 
of PV interneurons by VIP interneurons25,30. In contrast, targeted injection of α5-targeting 
lentivirus into layers II/III resulted in an increase in SOM interneuron spontaneous activity 
(21.63 ± 0.67 spikes/min) when compared to control mice (5.57 ± 1.31 spikes/min; Fig. 3k–
n), whereas pyramidal cell activity was reduced (Fig. 3o–r). Our data show that there is a 
central role for the α5 subunit in controlling VIP-mediated disinhibition via SOM 
interneuron inhibition of pyramidal neurons in layers II/III (Fig. 3s).
On the basis of evidence that the nicotine levels obtained from smoking can improve 
cognitive abilities31 and can mitigate certain schizophrenic symptoms6,32, we administered 
nicotine to WT and α5SNP mice by mini-pump infusion and examined alterations in layer 
II/III neuronal firing before and after infusion (Fig. 4a). The dose of nicotine was selected to 
maintain a plasma concentration analogous to that observed in smokers33. Pyramidal neuron 
activity significantly increased after 2 d of nicotine administration in WT mice and remained 
elevated after 2 weeks (Fig. 4b–e and Supplementary Fig. 11). Also, we found that nicotine 
treatment 1–2 weeks in duration increased pyramidal neuron activity in α5SNP mice to the 
levels of WT baseline activity (Fig. 4b–e). An explanation for these data is that chronic 
nicotine exposure desensitizes the β2-containing nAChRs expressed by interneurons. β2-
dependent, but not α7-dependent, nAChR currents in the interneurons of PFC layers II/III 
were completely desensitized after exposure to the concentrations of nicotine obtained from 
smoking in slice preparations15. To test this in vivo, we administered the same dose of 
nicotine in SOM-Cre mice injected with AAV encoding Cre-dependent GCaMP6f 
expression and observed a significant reduction in SOM interneuron activity when compared 
to that in control mice (Fig. 4f–h). These results suggest that the normalization of neuronal 
firing in α5-deficient mice by nicotine administration is mediated by dominant nicotine-
evoked desensitization of the β2-containing receptors on SOM interneurons. As a result, 
SOM inhibition of pyramidal cells is reduced. Together these data support the conclusion 
that layer II/III PFC activity is controlled by different nAChR subunits expressed specifically 
on different classes of interneurons. These experimental results argue strongly that nicotine, 
or nicotinic agonists, could normalize PFC activity and thus reduce some of the cognitive 
deficits found in humans with neuropsychiatric disorders.
In summary, we show that endogenous ACh distinctly recruits specific interneuron types 
within an interneuron hierarchy that controls pyramidal neurons in layers II/III of the PrLC, 
through differential expression of nAChR subunits. We also provide the first experimental 
evidence, to our knowledge, that the α5 human polymorphism, which predisposes to 
nicotine addiction, provokes a decrease in neuronal activity in rodents that mirrors the 
hypofrontality observed in patients with psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and 
addiction5. Further, we demonstrate that chronic nicotine treatment of mice carrying the α5 
SNP restores their neuronal activity deficits, and these findings together provide the basis for

 examining new pharmacotherapeutic strategies. Positive allosteric modulators of defined 
nAChR subunits, like the polymorphic α5 subunit, are strong candidates34. Finally, our 
results support the hypothesis that individuals with polymorphic CHRNA5 smoke to self-
medicate in order to ameliorate at least some symptoms of cortical dysfunction.
METHODS
Subjects
Male α7−/− (α7KO)35, β2−/− (β2KO)36, α5−/− (α5KO)37 and WT C57BL/6J mice used in 
this study were maintained at Charles River Laboratories, and experiments were performed 
at 3 months of age. The experiments described in the present work were conducted in 
accordance with the guidelines on the ethical use of animals from the European Community 
Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC) and in accordance with institutional 
animal welfare guidelines and were approved by Animalerie Centrale, Médecine du Travail 
and the Ethics Committee CETEA of Institut Pasteur, protocol numbers 2013-0056, 
2013-0104 and 2015-0007.
Mice engineered to harbor the α5 D398N variant (α5SNP mice) were obtained via 
homologous recombination. They were generated by the Ingenious Targeting Laboratory 
using C57BL/6 embryonic stem cells and genomic constructs derived from a C57BL/6 BAC 
library. The targeting construct was mutated to convert an aspartic acid codon (GAT) to an 
asparagine codon (AAT) at amino acid position 397 of the mouse α5 subunit gene (Chrna5). 
The amino acid position 397 in mice is equivalent to position 398 in human CHRNA5. The 
neomycin selection cassette of the targeting construct was removed by breeding α5SNP 
mice to a C57BL/6J strain expressing a Zp3-cre transgene (C57BL/6-TgN(ZP3-Cre)93Knw, 
Jackson Laboratories). Removal of the neomycin cassette was verified by PCR.
GAD67-Cre mice were published previously38,39. To generate GAD67-Cre/tdTomato mice, 
GAD67-Cre mice were crossed with a ChAT-Cre/tdTomato line40. GAD67-Cre mice were 
bred onto a homozygous α5KO background to obtain α5KO-GADCre mice.
To generate VIP-Cre/tdTomato mice, homozygous VIP-IRES-Cre (VIPtm1(cre)Zjh, Jackson 
Laboratory) mice were crossed with homozygous Ai9 mice (B6.Cg-
Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J, Jackson Laboratory) as previously described41. 
PV-Cre (008069, Jackson Laboratory) and SOM-Cre (013044, Jackson Laboratory) mice 
were bred onto a C57BL/6J background.
All experiments were performed using male mice.
Social interaction tests
Eight- to 12-week-old male WT and α5SNP littermates were tested for social behavior using 
a three-chamber social approach paradigm42. Experimental mice were habituated for 1 h in 
separate, clean holding cages and then were introduced into a three-chamber arena with only 
empty object-containment cages (circular metallic cages, Stoelting Neuroscience) for a 10-
min acclimation phase in two 5-min sessions in a 3- to 4-h period (habituation periods I and 
II). The following day, the mice were placed in the center chamber (without access to the left

 and right social test areas) and were allowed to explore the center area for 5 min (open field 
period). After this exploration period, the barriers to the adjacent chambers were removed, 
allowing mice to explore the left and right arenas, which contained a social partner (i.e., 
unfamiliar C57BL/6J male mouse) in one chamber and an inanimate object (plastic toy) in 
the other chamber. Experimental mice were given 10 min to explore both chambers and were 
measured for approach behavior as interaction time (i.e., sniffing, approach) with targets in 
each chamber (within 2 cm, excluding non-nose contact or exploration). Sessions were video 
recorded, and object exploration time and total distance moved were analyzed using the 
Noldus tracking system. A social preference index was calculated as the percentage of time 
spent investigating the social target (unfamiliar C57BL/6J male mouse) out of the total 
exploration time for both objects. The analysis was conducted with investigators blinded to 
the genotypes of subjects. Arenas and their contents were thoroughly cleaned between 
testing sessions. Multiple mice from different home cages were used as social targets to 
prevent potential odorant confounds from target home cages.
Prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex
Male WT and α5SNP littermates ranging in age from 60–75 d were used for the study. The 
PPI apparatus (SR-Lab, San Diego Instruments) consists of a sound-attenuating chamber 
and a vented Plexiglas animal enclosure (4 cm in diameter) that rests on a 20 × 13 cm 
Plexiglas frame. Background (70 dB), prepulse (74, 78, 82 and 90 dB) and pulse (120 dB) 
bursts were generated through a computer using SR-Lab software (San Diego Instruments) 
and presented through a speaker mounted (13 cm) above the animal enclosure. The 
magnitude of the startle response was measured by a piezoelectric accelerometer mounted 
below the Plexiglas animal enclosure.
Each session was initiated with a 5-min acclimation period followed by initiation of the test 
session with five pulse-only trials (white noise, 120 dB/40 ms); each session also concluded 
with five identical pulse-only trials. Both the pre- and post-pulse trials were excluded from 
analysis. The remaining trials consisted of pseudorandomized presentation within ten trial 
blocks of a blank (no-stimulus) trial, a pulse-only trial and four different types of prepulse + 
pulse trials (20 ms at 74, 78, 82 or 90 dB followed by a pulse (120 dB) 100 ms after the 
prepulse). PPI was calculated using the means of ten trials for each type of stimulus: percent 
PPI = (pulse-only score − (prepulse + pulse score))/pulse-only score × 100.
Stereotaxic injections and chronic cranial windows
Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (10% in PBS; Imalgen 1000, Rhone Mérieux) and 
xylazine (2% in PBS; Rompun, Bayer), 10 ml/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.), and placed into a 
stereotaxic frame. Mice were kept on a thermal blanket, and their eyes were protected with 
artificial tear ointment. The scalp was washed with three alternating swabs of 70% ethanol 
and betadine. Surgical tools were sterilized using a hot glass-bead sterilizer. The skull was 
exposed, and 1% xylocaine was applied to the periosteum. A chronic cranial window was 
prepared as previously described43 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Briefly, the skull was gently 
thinned using a dental drill around the region of interest, and the thinned bone was removed 
using forceps, leaving the dura intact. For recordings of pyramidal neurons, 200 nl of AAV 
virus (2.2 × 1013 genome copies (GC)/ml; AAV1.syn.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40, University of

 Pennsylvania Vector Core) was injected bilaterally at the following coordinates—PrL: AP, 
+2.8 mm from the bregma; L, ±0.5 mm; DV, −0.3 to −0.1 mm from the skull—using a 
Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific) at the slow infusion setting. For recordings of 
interneurons in the Cre lines, 200 nl of AAV virus (2.1 × 1013 GC/ml; 
AAV1.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40, University of Pennsylvania Vector Core) was 
injected bilaterally at the same coordinates as described above. The glass pipette was left in 
situ for an additional 5 min, before being slowly withdrawn from the brain. The optical 
window was covered with a circular coverglass (5 mm in diameter) and was sealed to the 
skull with dental cement (Coffret SUPERBOND complet, Phymep). A sterile small stainless 
steel bar with a screw hole was embedded into the acrylic over the cerebellum to head-fix 
the mouse for imaging sessions, and all exposed skull was covered with dental cement.
Lentiviral expression vectors and stereotaxic procedure
The lentiviral expression vectors were derived from the pHR’ expression vectors first 
described by Naldini et al.44 with several subsequent modifications. In the lentivirus used in 
this study, expression of mCherry cDNA is under the control of the mouse phosphoglycerate 
kinase (PGK) promoter. Further details can be found in ref. 45. Briefly, to create the pLV-
PGK-mCherry-WPRE vector, a two-step strategy was used. First, mCherry cDNA was 
amplified from the pRSET plasmid (a kind gift of the laboratory of S. Tajbakhsh, Stem Cells 
and Development lab, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France), using the following primers—forward, 
5′-GTACTCGAGCCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGC-3′; reverse, 5′-
GCTGACGCGGCCGCTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-3′—and the T/A cloning 
strategy was used to introduce mCherry cDNA into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). 
Next, we took advantage of the XhoI site in the multiple-cloning region of the vector to 
replace the fragment encoding eGFP in the preexisting pTRIP-PGK-eGFP lentiviral vector45 
with mCherry cDNA between the XhoI and BsrGI sites. This viral vector was used as a 
control injection for the β2 rescue experiments.
To create the pLV-dsmPGK-β2-IRES-tdTomato-WPRE vector, we used a previously 
described PTP-β2-IRES-GFP-WPRE vector45 and replaced the full IRES-GFP sequence 
with IRES-tdTomato available from Clotech (pLVX-IRES-tdTomato) by using the Gateway 
system. Lentivectors were diluted in PBS before stereotaxic injection to achieve a dose 
corresponding to 250 ng of p24 protein in 2 μl.
Production of the conditional lentivectors was performed as previously described34. Briefly, 
viral particles were generated by cotransfection of HEK-293T cells with the vector plasmid, 
a packaging plasmid and an envelope plasmid using the calcium phosphate protocol. At 2 d 
after transfection, viral particles were collected in the supernatant, treated with DNase I and 
MgCl2, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, concentrated by ultracentrifugation and resuspended 
in a small volume of PBS. Viral stocks were stored in small aliquots at −80 °C before use. 
Viral titers were estimated by quantification of the p24 capsid protein using the HIV-1 p24 
antigen immunoassay (ZeptoMetrix) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Lentivectors were diluted in PBS before stereotaxic injection to achieve a dose 
corresponding to 150 ng of p24 protein in 2 μl for re-expression of the α5 subunit. As 
controls, we used vectors carrying only eGFP under the same promoter and we injected the

 same volumes. The lentiviral vectors were injected bilaterally into the PrLC at the following 
coordinates—PrL: AP, +2.8 mm from the bregma; L, ±0.5 mm; DV, −0.25 to −0.1 mm from 
the skull—using a Nanoject II (Drummond Scientific) at the slow infusion setting.
CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease RNA-guided genome editing
We used CRISPR-associated Cas9 endonuclease technology for inactivation of the α5 
subunit (Sigma-Aldrich). Three different gRNAs were designed by Sigma-Aldrich using an 
algorithm based on Bowtie sequence analysis software. gRNAs targeting a site in the first 
two-thirds of the coding sequence with at least 3 bp of mismatch with any other location in 
the host genome were proposed for testing by genomic cleavage detection assay (CEL-1 
endonuclease). Assessment of the CRISPR/Cas9 on-target and off-target effects is described 
in the Supplementary Methods (Off target analysis using next generation sequencing) and 
Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. After screening of three target sites in the Chrna5 gene, the 
following target site was chosen: TGTCACTCAGGTGTTCCACAGG. The lentiviral vector 
uses a one-plasmid system consisting of an EF1-α-driven Cas9 gene and a U6-driven gRNA, 
with both puromycin and GFP coexpressed with Cas9. 2.5 μg of U6-gRNA was nucleofected 
with 5 μg of Cas9 plasmid. In vitro validation was performed in mouse N2a cells (Sigma-
Aldrich), where the targeting efficiency was established to be 13.2% by enzymatic assay. 
N2a cells tested negative for mycoplasma. Insertions and deletions were detected at the 
gRNA target via mismatch assay (CEL-1 endonuclease) using the following primers: 
forward, 5′-GATTATTGATAACATTGAGTTTC-3′; reverse, 5′-
CTCTAGTGGCTAACTCACAC-3′. As a control, we used a lentiviral plasmid vector that 
includes a gRNA sequence that does not target known human, mouse or rat genes 
(CRISPR12-1EA, Sigma-Aldrich). Viral particles were generated by cotransfection of 
HEK-293T cells with the vector plasmid, as described above. For the α5-Cas9 lentiviral 
vector, 49 ng of p24 protein in 1 μl was locally injected in layers II/III of the PFC, whereas 
the control virus was diluted in PBS before stereotaxic injection to achieve a dose 
corresponding to 50 ng of p24 protein in 1 μl. In addition, 100 nl of 
AAV1.CAG.tdTomato.WPRE.SV40 (1.52 × 1013 GC/ml; University of Pennsylvania Vector 
Core) was added to the solution to allow localization of the cells transduced with LV-
CRISPR virus.
Mouse handling for awake imaging
Mice were habituated to the imaging environment by handling and training for 4 d, as 
described previously46,47. Briefly, the animals were habituated to the following conditions 
sequentially: (1) gentle handling, (2) free exploration of a 50-ml open-ended support tube 
(for the mouse to rest in during imaging), (3) incremental periods of mild head fixation in 
which the mouse’s head was briefly secured to the head post (5 s to 15 s) and (4) extended 
periods of head fixation on the mouse stage while the mouse rested in the support tube (5 
min to 60 min).
Immunofluorescence
At the end of the final two-photon imaging session, immunofluorescence was performed in 
order to verify the injection site. Fixation was carried out by transcardiac perfusion of 
anesthetized mice using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and the brains were removed and

 post-fixed by immersion in PFA for 2 d at 4 °C. The brains were then immersed in 30% 
sucrose in PBS overnight for cryoprotection at 4 °C. Serial 40-μm coronal sections were cut 
with a sliding microtome (Leica Microsystems), transferred to PBS, mounted on slides and 
coverslipped with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Microscopy was 
carried out with a Zeiss epifluorescent microscope.
To determine expression patterns in β2KO-GADCre mice injected with β2-IRES2-tdTomato 
and in α5KO-GADCre mice injected with PDGF-floxed-mCherry-α5 WT/SNP-IRES2-
eGFPP-WPRE, we anesthetized and perfused the mice as described above. Serial 40-μm 
coronal sections were cut with a sliding microtome, collected and washed in PBS treated 
with 0.2% Tween-20 (PBS-T), immersed in 10% normal horse serum blocking solution, and 
incubated overnight with primary antibodies against GFP (1:2,000; Abcam, ab38689) and 
RFP (1:2,000; Molecular Probes, R10367) followed by incubation with secondary antibodies 
conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (green; 1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 
715-545-150) and Alexa Fluor 568 (red; 1:500; Abcam, ab175470). The sections were 
mounted on slides and coverslipped with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI. 
Microscopy was carried out with a Zeiss LSM-700 confocal microscope (Supplementary 
Fig. 7). For all antibodies, validation is provided at the manufacturer’s website.
Surgical implantation of mini-pumps
Mice were anesthetized with a xylazine and ketamine combination (15% xylazine/2.5% 
ketamine/82.5% PBS). Osmotic mini-pumps (model 2004, ALZET DURECT) were 
implanted subcutaneously at the nape of the neck as previously described48. Nicotine or 
saline was delivered at a constant rate (2.4 mg per kg body weight per day for nicotine).
In vivo two-photon imaging
In vivo imaging was performed with an Ultima IV two-photon laser-scanning microscope 
system (Bruker), using a 16x, 0.8 N.A. water immersion objective (Nikon) with the 
femtosecond laser (MaiTai DeepSee, Spectra Physics) tuned to 950 nm for imaging of cells 
expressing GCaMP6f and to 1020 nm for imaging of cells expressing tdTomato. Time-series 
movies of neuronal populations expressing GCaMP6f were acquired at the frame rate of 
6.926 Hz (182 × 182 μm field of view; 0.71 μm/pixel). The duration of each focal plane 
movie was 216.564 s (1,500 frames) to track spontaneous neuronal activity. For interneuron 
recordings, time-series movies of interneuronal populations expressing GCaMP6f were 
acquired at the frame rate of 30.33 Hz (405 × 405 μm field of view; 0.79 μm/pixel). The 
duration of each focal plane movie was 164.897 s (5,000 frames).
Randomization and blinding
The mice from all experimental groups, both baseline and nicotine treated, were imaged in a 
random order. Experiments were performed with blinding for the β2 re-expressing mice and 
for recordings of the VIP-Cre and PV-Cre baseline and SOM-Cre nicotine-treated mice but 
not for the rest of the experiments. Analysis was performed with blinding for the social 
interaction test data, the activities of the α5KO, α5SNP and β2 re-expressing mice, and 
recordings of the baseline PV-Cre and SOM-Cre mice and SOM-Cre nicotine-treated mice, 
but not for the rest of the experiments.

 Two-photon data analysis
Image analysis was performed offline with ImageJ software. The time series were corrected 
using Image Stabilizer (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kangli/code/Image_Stabilizer.html). 
Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually selected in FIJI, and detection of Ca2+ transients 
of individual neurons was performed automatically by using a custom-written toolbox in 
MATLAB (Mathworks). For details on the analysis method, see the Supplementary Methods 
(Two-photon data analysis).
Statistical analysis
Two-photon data—Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance combined with multiple-
comparison testing was applied on the aggregated activity (transients/min and spikes/min) of 
the neurons in all mouse groups in order to study the statistical similarities between them. 
For each mouse category, we used interpolation in order to account for the different number 
of neurons recorded in the different animals. In this way, our statistical analysis assigned the 
same weight to each neuronal population recorded in the different mice of a given category. 
Levene’s test was used to compare the variances of the neural distributions that were similar 
between groups that were statistically compared. We used Welch’s F-test ANOVA as a 
complementary test for heteroscedasticity. This test gave similar results as the Kruskal–
Wallis test with the same level of significance. We used the multiple-comparisons Tukey–
Kramer test in order to determine which pairs of mean ranks were significantly different. 
Animals were not excluded from the analysis. The number of mice needed for our study was 
determined by preliminary experiments in anesthetized mice and pilot experiments in awake 
mice. Box plots, histograms and empirical cumulative distribution functions (Kaplan–Meier 
estimate) were used to compare the different distributions of neural activity between the 
mouse types. For each box, the central mark is the median, the edges of the box are the 25th 
and 75th percentiles, and the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered 
outliers. The ends of the whiskers represent the lowest data value still within 1.5 times the 
IQR (interquartile range) of the lower quartile and the highest data value still within 1.5 
times the IQR of the upper quartile. On the empirical cumulative distribution plots, 95% 
lower and upper confidence bounds were computed with Greenwood’s formula.
Behavioral data—Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (GraphPad) software. 
Social interaction task differences were assessed using unpaired Student’s t test. Because the 
variance between genotypes for the social index and interaction time measures were not 
equal, unpaired Student’s t test with Welch’s correction was used. Two-way repeated-
measures ANOVA with Sidak post hoc test was used for the PPI data analysis. All data other 
than the aforementioned social interaction tests met the assumptions of the chosen statistical 
test: normality and equal variances.
