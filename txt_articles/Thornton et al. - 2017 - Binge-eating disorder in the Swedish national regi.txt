ABSTRACT
Objective:
To
evaluate
associations
between binge-eating disorder (BED) and
somatic illnesses and determine whether
medical comorbidities are more common
in individuals who present with BED and
comorbid obesity.
Method: Cases (n5 850) were individu-
als with a BED diagnosis in the Swedish
eating disorders quality registers. Ten
community controls were matched to
each case on sex, and year, month, and
county of birth. Associations of BED status
with neurologic, immune, respiratory,
gastrointestinal,
skin,
musculoskeletal,
genitourinary, circulatory, and endocrine
system diseases were evaluated using
conditional logistic regression models. We
further examined these associations by
adjusting for lifetime psychiatric comor-
bidity. Amongst individuals with BED, we
explored whether comorbid obesity was
associated with risk of somatic disorders.
Results: BED was associated with most
classes of diseases evaluated; strongest
associations were with diabetes [odds
ratio (95% confidence interval)5 5.7 (3.8;
8.7)] and circulatory systems [1.9 (1.3;
2.7)], likely indexing components of met-
abolic syndrome. Amongst individuals
with BED, those with comorbid obesity
were more likely to have a lifetime histo-
ry of respiratory [1.5 (1.1; 2.1)] and gastro-
intestinal [2.6 (1.7; 4.1)] diseases than
those
without
comorbid
obesity.
Increased risk of some somatic disease
classes in individuals with BED was not
simply due to obesity or other lifetime
psychiatric comorbidity.
Discussion: The association of BED with
many somatic illnesses highlights the
morbidity
experienced
by
individuals
with BED. Clinicians treating patients
with BED should be vigilant for medical
comorbidities. Nonpsychiatric providers
may be the first clinical contact for those
with BED underscoring the importance of
screening in primary care. V

Introduction
Binge-eating disorder (BED), included in the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
5th Edition (DSM-51), has a reported lifetime prev-
alence of 0.1–3.6%, and a point prevalence of 0.1–
5.6%.2–6 The ratio of lifetime BED in women to
men is about 1.3–3 to 1.3,5 BED has been reported to
be associated with increased risk for a range of medi-
cal comorbidities, some of which may be indepen-
dent of overweight and obesity. For example, BED
and binge-eating behaviors have been associated

 with increased risk of hypertension,4,7 type II diabe-
tes,4,8–10 autoimmune disease,11 and gastrointestinal
disorders.4,12–14 Pain syndromes (e.g., headaches,
neck and back pain, arthritis4,15; limb and joint
pain13; and fibromyalgia12) have also been reported
to commonly co-occur in individuals with BED.
Results of the aforementioned studies have been
somewhat inconsistent (see Refs. 12,16,17) and
have been limited by single site clinical sampling, a
focus on the presence of binge-eating behavior
rather than threshold BED, or an inability to com-
pare the somatic comorbidities in individuals with
BED with and without comorbid obesity.14,15,18,19
Moreover, other research has suggested an associa-
tion between obesity and dermatological, respira-
tory,
immune
conditions20
and
metabolic
syndrome. Immune problems also increase vulner-
ability to infectious diseases.21 Additional evidence
is required to clarify whether BED is associated
with these conditions and whether any of the
observed associations are partly or fully accounted
for by the presence of obesity.
Determining the extent to which BED is associated
with adverse health outcomes is critical for estimat-
ing the burden of disease and for service planning.
Register-based studies that capture all activity in a
nation’s health care system allow for a complete eval-
uation of patterns of comorbidity in BED. Using the
Swedish national population registers, the primary
aim of the present study was to evaluate the lifetime
associations between BED and illnesses of the neuro-
logic, infectious/parasitic, immune, respiratory, gas-
trointestinal, skin, musculoskeletal, genitourinary,
circulatory, endocrine systems, congenital malforma-
tions, and external causes of morbidity (i.e., injury). A
secondary aim was to compare the prevalence of the
observed somatic comorbidities in individuals with
BED with and without comorbid obesity. We hypoth-
esized that there would be positive lifetime associa-
tions
between
BED
and
gastrointestinal,4,12–14
musculoskeletal,4 circulatory,4,7 and endocrine disor-
ders,4,8–10 but the other tests of association were
exploratory.
Method
Procedure
Data were extracted from Swedish population registers
in 2009. Unique personal identification numbers assigned
to all Swedish residents enables linkage across the popu-
lation registers. For this analysis, we linked (a) the eating
disorders national quality registers, National Quality Reg-
ister for Eating Disorders Treatment (Riks€
at)22 and Step-
wise,23 which began entering patient information in 1999
and 2005, respectively; (b) the National Patient Register
(NPR24), covering all Swedish public and private hospital
inpatient admissions from 1973 onwards and outpatient
specialist
care
from
2001
onwards;
(c)
the
Multi-
Generation Register,25 to determine biological and adop-
tive relationships for all individuals living in Sweden since
1933; (d) the Migration Register,26 containing information
on emigration from or immigration to Sweden; and (e)
the Cause of Death Register,27 listing date and primary
and contributing cause(s) of deaths since 1958. Details
about the Swedish population registers can be found in
D’Onofrio et al.28 Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was cal-
culated from height and weight in Riks€
at (or Stepwise)
assessed at the index date during presentation to an eat-
ing disorder service, and was only available for cases.
Defining the Sample
Cases were defined as any individual with a lifetime his-
tory of a BED diagnosis in the eating disorders registers
Riks€
at22 or Stepwise23 at any point in which an evaluation
occurred (i.e., initial or 1-year follow-up visit, years 1999–
2009). Inclusion criteria for Riks€
at and Stepwise are: (a)
medical or self-referral to a participating treatment unit,
(b) a diagnosed eating disorder, and (c) intent to treat the
patient. In cases where the clinical unit decided not to
treat the patient (most often because the patient was
determined not to have an eating disorder), no enrolment
in Riks€
at or Stepwise is made. In 2009, most specialized
eating disorder units (�90%) and many general psychiat-
ric units in Sweden reported to Riks€
at and or Stepwise.
In 2009, Riks€
at, an Internet-based register, included
eating disorders-specific information on �8,600 patients.
Follow-up assessments are annual for the duration of
treatment. DSM-IV29 eating disorder diagnoses (i.e., AN,
BN, BED, and EDNOS) are given at each assessment
point by a clinician. BED is a unique diagnosis; it is not
subsumed under EDNOS.
Most registrants in Stepwise are in Riks€
at, but Stepwise
contains more detailed clinical information on presenta-
tion, course, outcome, and related psychopathology.
Using both registers allowed us to ascertain all registered
cases. Once intent to treat is established, which typically
occurs within 1 week for inpatients or three visits for out-
patients, diagnosis is made by specially trained clinicians
(most of whom attend a special 2-day training in using
the Stepwise method battery) using a semi-structured
interview (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis
I Disorders, SCID-I30 before 2008, or Structured Eating
Disorder Interview, SEDI31 since 2008) based on DSM-IV-
TR criteria.32
The Multi-Generation Register allowed us to identify 10
controls for each identified case. We matched controls to
cases based on sex and year, month, and county of birth. If
a case was born outside of Sweden, controls were matched
BED AND SOMATIC ILLNESS

59
 on immigration status and time of migration (controls
could not immigrate later than their respective cases),
regardless of origin, in addition to sex and year and month
of birth. Controls had to be alive and resident in Sweden
for an equivalent period of time: from birth or immigration
until the time of diagnosis of their index case. Controls
were required not to have received a BED diagnosis in
Riks€
at or Stepwise at any time, but they could have had
another eating disorder (which was detected in 1.0% of
controls).
Inclusion in the Swedish population registers does not
require informed consent. However, the rules governing
the Swedish quality registers require that information
about the register be provided to the patient and that the
patient has the possibility to opt out of participation. For
the Stepwise register, research participation is elective via
an opt out procedure (about 3% decline participation33).
The University of North Carolina Biomedical Institutional
Review Board (IRB) and the Regional Ethics Committee
of Karolinska Institutet both approved this study.
Somatic Diagnoses
Diagnostic information for somatic illnesses for all
cases and controls were obtained from the NPR (years
1973 and onward; see Table 1 for the list of diseases and
conditions and their diagnostic codes). Individuals listed
in the NPR with diagnoses for these disorders based on
WHO International Classification of Diseases, Eighth
Revision (ICD-8: years 1969–198634; diagnoses from ICD-
8 were rare and used only for the oldest cases and con-
trols), WHO International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision (ICD-9: years 1987–199635) or WHO Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-
10: years 1997-present36) as a principal diagnosis at any
time (i.e., lifetime history) were scored as positive for
that disorder.
Psychiatric Comorbidity
Psychiatric comorbidity was coded as the presence
versus absence of any lifetime psychiatric disorder or
suicide-related/intentional self-harm injury and was
used as a covariate. Comorbidity was obtained from the
NPR and was based on the ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD-10
classifications.

psychiatric
disorders
included:
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder,

Analysis
Conditional logistic regression models were applied
to assess the association of BED status (case/control)
with each comorbid somatic illness. Because individu-
als could be diagnosed with other eating disorders at
other times, sensitivity analyses evaluating the associ-
ation between BED status and the somatic illnesses
were conducted excluding cases (and their respective
controls) who had an additional eating disorder diag-
nosis (other than BED) in Riks€
at or Stepwise or who
had a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nerv-
osa in the NPR. These sensitivity analyses evaluated
the association of BED and somatic disorders free
from confounding of other eating disorders diagnosed
at other times. To further investigate any comorbid
associations
between
BED
and
somatic
disorders,
models
were
rerun
including
lifetime
psychiatric
comorbidity (defined as a lifetime history of any of
the psychiatric illnesses) as a covariate. Given reported
associations between obesity and many of the somatic
illnesses
included,
we
explored
whether
obesity
(BMI � 30 kg/m2) was associated with increased risk
of the target somatic disorders in individuals with
BED with logistic regressions. In these analyses, we
controlled for sex, and for county (with adjacent
counties grouped into four regions based on geogra-
phy, and immigrant status treated as one county) and
year of birth (with years of birth grouped as before
1965, 66–75, 76–85, after 1986).
All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.437
and all tests were two-tailed. Although we conducted
multiple tests, we sought to minimize the probability of
making a Type II error in this observational study,38
thus we did not perform familywise error rate correc-
tion for exploratory analyses (only for hypothesis-
based analyses and we used the false discovery rate
method39). Note that based on the fixed sample size for
the conditional logistic regression, the odds ratio (OR)
detectable with statistical inference, calculated using
Lachin’s method,40 ranged from 1.22 (most prevalent)
to 1.59 (least prevalent medical conditions), indicating
that there may be inadequate power to detect some
associations.
Results
The overall sample included 9,350 individuals (95%
female). At the time of diagnosis of the index case,
the average age of the overall sample was 29
(SD 5 9.6) years and 96% were adults (aged 181
years). Thirty percent of adults were cohabiting
(married/de facto) or living with children, 28%
were living with their parents, 37% lived alone, and
5% reported other living arrangements. Eight per-
cent were immigrants.
The case sample, described in Welch et al.41
comprised 850 individuals (39 males, 811 females)
with BED. Cases were diagnosed between 14 and
72 years of age. Men were significantly older
(mode 5 22 years for women and 25 years for men)
and had significantly higher BMI values at the time
of evaluation than women. Significantly more men
were immigrants.
Table 2 presents the results of the conditional
logistic
regressions
evaluating
the
associations
between BED and each somatic disorder in the full
sample. BED was significantly associated with all
classes of disease evaluated except genitourinary
system disorders and congenital malformations.
Immune system disorders could not be evaluated
due to their rarity. The strongest associations were
with endocrine (diabetes mellitus and other disor-
ders) and circulatory system diseases. Sensitivity
analyses excluding individuals with BED who also
had lifetime diagnoses of other eating disorders
(i.e., AN or BN) yielded similar findings: the stron-
gest associations were with endocrine and circula-
tory system diseases and no association was found
for the genitourinary system.
To further investigate the comorbid associations
between BED and somatic disorders, we adjusted
for any lifetime psychiatric comorbidity, which was
present in 47% of cases compared with 11% of con-
trols (p < 0.001). The associations between BED
and respiratory, skin, musculoskeletal, circulatory,
and endocrine problems all remained statistically
significant but reduced slightly (Table 2). The asso-
ciations between BED and neurological, infec-
tious/parasitic,
and
gastrointestinal
disorders
reduced in magnitude and became statistically
nonsignificant, suggesting limited unique variance
accounted for by BED.
Table 3 presents the results of logistic regression
analyses comparing individuals with BED with
(n 5 361) and without (n 5 489) comorbid obesity.
Individuals with BED with comorbid obesity were
more likely to have a lifetime history of respiratory,
gastrointestinal, and skin disorders than individu-
als with BED without comorbid obesity. Sensitivity
analyses excluding individuals with BED who also
had lifetime diagnoses of other eating disorders
(i.e., AN or BN) yielded similar findings: the

 association
with
gastrointestinal
disorders
remained significant; however, skin and subcuta-
neous tissue disorders were no longer significant.
Discussion
Research on the co-occurrence of BED with somat-
ic illnesses may help us conceptualize biological
bases for disease, potentially generate novel direc-
tions for therapeutic intervention, and inform our
understanding of morbidity. This first national reg-
ister study revealed elevated risk across a range of
somatic illnesses in individuals with lifetime BED.
Our observations are consistent with previous
studies of gastrointestinal,4,12–14 musculoskeletal,4
circulatory,4,7 and endocrine,4,8–10 disorders but
extend the literature by documenting additional
increased risk for neurologic, infectious, respirato-
ry, and skin diseases. Of the latter series, skin
and respiratory conditions were uniquely associat-
ed
with
BED,
whereas
the
remainder
was
dependent on the presence of lifetime psychiatric
comorbidity.
The strongest associations with BED and somatic
comorbidities were with endocrine (diabetes melli-
tus and other disorders) and circulatory system dis-
eases, which were not fully accounted for by
obesity. This pattern may reflect components of
the
“metabolic
syndrome”
which
comprises
abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, ele-
vated blood pressure, insulin resistance with or
without glucose intolerance, and proinflammatory
and prothrombotic states. Our findings converge
with longitudinal research suggesting that BED
confers risk for metabolic syndrome beyond that
conferred by obesity alone.16 Even among children,
binge eating predicts subsequent development of
metabolic syndrome, which is partly explained by
the excess weight gain associated with children’s
binge eating.42 Preventing or successfully treating
binge eating may have important clinical implica-
tions for mitigating the development of metabolic
syndrome.

 We confirm and extend observed associations
between BED and a broad range of somatic illness
categories. Future research should explore more
granular diagnoses to further elucidate the exact
nature and timing of comorbid somatic illnesses. It
was beyond the scope of this study to assess associ-
ations between specific somatic illnesses and BED,
rather categories for somatic illness according to
ICD were used which are broad and inclusive. A
second future research direction is to explore the
temporality of the associations between BED and
these somatic illnesses using prospective evalua-
tions of disease onset in longitudinal cohorts,
which could also help clarify whether associations
are
causal
or
reflect
underlying
shared
vulnerabilities.
Parsing out the role of obesity and somatic
comorbidity is another important step to under-
standing the biological basis of BED. Within the
sample of individuals with BED, we found that the
presence of obesity was associated with increased
risk for respiratory, gastrointestinal, and skin disor-
ders, but not other classes of illness. This observa-
tion
reinforces
that
increased
risk
for
some
diseases in individuals with BED, including compo-
nents of metabolic syndrome, is not simply due to
the effects of obesity.
These results must be interpreted within the
context of the study limitations. First, only indi-
viduals who received a BED diagnosis and had
diagnostic information in the eating disorders
quality registers (years 1999–2009) were included.
Individuals who do not present for treatment may
have different patterns of somatic comorbidity.
Furthermore, spuriously high rates of comorbidi-
ty may occur among clinically ascertained indi-
viduals because one comorbidity may be detected
via treatment contact for the other or the burden
of two comorbid disorders may increase the prob-
ability of treatment-seeking.43 Second, �95% of
the sample were women, thus, results may not be
generalizable to men because the prevalence of
comorbidities may differ across sexes. Our sam-
ple was a young adult sample, hence results are
specific to this age group; the magnitude of the
associations between BED and somatic illnesses
might be affected by age-related factors (e.g.,
duration and persistence of BED) and length of
surveillance. Third, controls were not screened
for eating disorders, which may have biased asso-
ciations
between
BED
and
somatic
illnesses
downward. Fourth, small cell sizes for some disor-
ders resulted in greater imprecision in estimates
or inability to apply the analytic model. Fifth,
information on BMI (obesity) was not available
for controls. Thus, the effects of obesity on the
associations between BED and somatic illnesses
could not be clarified further. Sixth, care must be
taken in interpreting the findings: some somatic
problems emerge prior to BED. For this study,
controls were required to be unaffected individu-
als in the cohort who were still alive and under
surveillance at the time of diagnosis of the case.
Suppose that individuals who do not develop BED
(or would not go on to develop BED if they sur-
vived until adulthood) are more likely to develop
certain severe somatic problems (that result in
death) in childhood/adolescence. These individu-
als would not be eligible for inclusion in analyses,
potentially leading to bias in the form of stronger
associations between somatic problems and BED
in the results. Finally, the time between symptom
onset and treatment seeking varies across disor-
ders. Thus, results related to medical comorbid-
ities must be interpreted with caution.
These
limitations
are
balanced
by
several
strengths. First, because registers were used, the
sample is large and based on the total population
of Sweden. Second, BED diagnoses were made by
clinicians using a structured clinical interview.
These diagnoses captured subthreshold informa-
tion and were entered in the eating disorders

 quality registers, allowing us to separate BED from
other
presentations
covered
by
the
historical
EDNOS diagnosis. Third, somatic illness diagnoses
were made by clinicians and were not based on
self-report; this increases diagnostic validity and
limits recall bias.
Our results demonstrate that BED is associated
with a broad range of somatic illnesses. These
results
have
important
implications
for
both
mental-health care providers and nonpsychiatric
health
care
providers.
For
mental-health
care
providers, our results underscore the importance
of
recognizing
and
referring
appropriately
for
somatic complaints. For non-psychiatric, general
medical care providers, our results encourage the
routine screening for binge eating or excessive
overeating in patients presenting for medical care
or weight loss. Given the wide range of observed
comorbidities, our results support screening for
binge eating in primary care. Improving detection
of BED in primary care settings could lead to
prompt referral, reduce duration of exposure to
the illness, and reduce lifetime psychiatric and
somatic illness burden.
