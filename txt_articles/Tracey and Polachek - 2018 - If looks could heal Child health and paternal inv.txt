If Looks Could Heal:
Child Health and Paternal Investment*
Data from the first two waves of the Fragile Family and Child Wellbeing study indicate 
that infants who look like their father at birth are healthier one year later. The reason is 
such father-child resemblance induces a father to spend more time engaged in positive 
parenting. An extra day (per month) of time-investment by a typical visiting father enhances 
child health by just over 10% of a standard deviation. This estimate is not biased by the 
effect of child health on father-involvement or omitted maternal ability, thereby eliminating 
endogeneity biases that plague existing studies. The result has implications regarding the 
role of a father’s time in enhancing child health, especially in fragile families.

Introduction
Income inequality in the US increased substantially since the 1990’s.
Many dispute the
underlying causes, but few can disagree that single-parent households tend to fall at the
bottom of the distribution. Further, children in these households are at a disadvantage,
which likely affects them throughout their lives.
On December 10, 2014, the White House held a summit on Early Education.
The key
recommendation emphatically endorsed investing in early childhood development (includ-
ing health). According to one speaker, “[t]he way parents interact with their children, the
amount of time they spend with them and the resources they have . . . greatly affect their
children’s potential for leading flourishing lives” (Heckman, 2014).
Time inputs of both
parents appear to be even more important than money investments in producing quality
children (Del Boca et al., 2014).
In this regard, the prevalence of children currently liv-
ing in low-income single mother homes is of concern. In 2016, 17.2 million (nearly 25%)
children under age 18 were living only with a mother and 40% of those lived below the
poverty line (U.S. Census Bureau, 2016). These children are more likely to be food insecure
(Nord et al., 2005), and have less access to parental investment especially from absentee
fathers (Jones & Mosher, 2013). But, as will be explained, the impact of nonresident father-
involvement on child health has not been adequately studied. In this paper, we consider
whether early investments by nonresident fathers improve child health. Determining this is
important given that child health is strongly linked to future education, adult health and
eventual labor market success (Case et al., 2005; Currie, 2009; Campbell et al., 2014).
The ‘parent-child family’ model of Jacobson (2000) explains that parents allocate material
and time inputs to the production of child health, in addition to their own health, in order
to maximize the family’s utility.
Bolin et al. (2002) extend the model to consider, inter
alia, the effects of family policies on child health when parents are divorced. Their model
implies that greater nonresident father contact (via joint custody) or child support would
raise the amount of child health. Frequent contact likely provides more parental time to su-
pervise children, manage harmful exposures, gather information and attend to their health
needs, and share parenting tasks. Nonresident fathers might also be attentive and careful in
child interaction to prevent health problems and thereby secure future visiting opportunities
(Nepomnyaschy & Donnelly, 2015). Child support may increase the mother’s ability to pur-
chase more or better health inputs, and also increase father visitation (Del Boca & Ribero,
2001). An alternative perspective is a visiting father might stir up conflict or put strain on a
mother’s economic resources. This in turn affects parenting practices and maternal depres-
sion (Slade, 2013), which makes children more susceptible to health problems or emotional
distress.
A growing empirical literature finds that children in single-mother families have lower health
than children in two-parent families (e.g. Angel & Worobey, 1988; Bramlett & Blumberg,
2007; Harknett, 2009). However, studies regarding the impact of nonresident fathers’ involve-
ment are scarce and provide mixed conclusions. Menning & Stewart (2008) find nonresident
father contact is related to a greater risk of adolescent obesity. Yet, somewhat contradictory,
other studies find that frequent visitation is related to fewer food acquisition problems in
2
 households with 0-17 year old children (Garasky & Stewart, 2007) and healthier adolescent
eating habits (Stewart & Menning, 2009).
For kindergarten children, Hofferth & Pinzon
(2011) find no effect of nonresidential fathers’ child support payments and contact on child
health after parental separation. At the same time, Baughman (2014) shows child support
lowers the odds of poor health for children 2-15 years old. When children are 1-5 years
old, Nepomnyaschy & Donnelly (2015) find nonresident father engagement insignificantly
affects injury risk (similar to Hofferth & Pinzon, 2011); however, their cooperative parenting
behavior lowers such risk.
Simply controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors limits these studies’ facility to
control for several possible sources of endogeneity bias. First, poor child health may either de-
ter or induce nonresident father involvement rather than the reverse in which father involve-
ment augments child health. For example, Reichman et al. (2004) find child health may lead
to marital dissolution, and hence lower father involvement. Also, Hofferth & Pinzon (2011)
find child health problems lower financial support. Ignoring such reverse causation creates
an ambiguous estimation bias. Second, a protective, self-reliant and competent mother may
discourage (‘gatekeep’) father engagement in child-rearing activities (Allen & Hawkins, 1999;
Gaertner et al., 2007); or a mother’s time in child care may be a substitute for a father’s time
(Pailhe & Solaz, 2008). Such maternal factors if ignored can cause a downward bias. Third,
a mother who views herself as the sole contributor to her child’s health may more likely
understate a father’s participation while a mother who merely wishes the father participated
more might overstate it. So, mother-reported paternal investment may be measured with
error, which can create a downward bias. The overall bias is ambiguous, making it difficult
for existing studies to ascertain the causal impact of nonresident fathers on child health.
We introduce a unique approach, with roots in evolutionary sociobiology, to infer the causal
impact of nonresident father-involvement on child health. To do so, we make use of an a
priori unexpected observation in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing data. We find
infants born out of wedlock who look like their father at birth (as assessed by both parents
in separate and private interviews)1 have better overall health one-year later, but not at
birth. Further, we determine the underlying mechanism for better child health one year
after birth in response to father-child resemblance is father involvement, in particular the
amount of time a father invests in his purported child. We find the average nonresident father
spends about 2.5 days (per month) longer in parenting activities when the child resembles
him. Consistent with several studies from evolutionary sociobiology (e.g. Platek et al., 2002,
2003, 2004; Volk & Quinsey, 2002, 2007), father-child resemblance encourages paternal time-
investment, perhaps because doubtful males respond to paternity uncertainty.
There is
little or no evidence to support other potential mechanisms such as a father’s economic
provision, his involvement in shared parenting, or maternal parenting. These results support
using father-child resemblance as an instrument for the time a father invests in the child to
establish a causal link between father’s time investment and child health. The validity of the
father-child resemblance variable is supported by conducting placebo checks under conditions
where such a variable is irrelevant to paternal investment. We find fathers’ time-investment
1Alvergne et al. (2010) show that actual resemblance to the father is consistent when both parents report
father-child facial similarity in private. Still, we consider other definitions of father-child resemblance.

 significantly improves child health in single-mother families. Based on a linear combination
of five child health indicators, each extra day of time-investment increases child health by
over 0.1 standard deviations. It also decreases the probability a child will have reportedly
‘poor’ health by 2 percentage points. Thus, promoting nonresident father time-investment
could be a key strategy to reduce child health disparities and thereby secure a greater chance
of future educational and career success for children in single-mother families.
The next section presents the literature relating child resemblance to paternal investment.
In section 3, we describe the data and define key variables.
In section 4, we estimate
the impact of father-child resemblance on child health and father investment, deduce the
mechanism through which such resemblance operates, and provide checks for robustness.
Finally, section 5 provides a conclusion.
2
Child resemblance and paternal investment
Evolutionary theory predicts parents will provide preferential care to genetically related
children to advance their genetic success (Hamilton, 1963; Trivers, 1972; Alexander, 1974).
Investments in unrelated children are deemed wasteful since they reduce investment in genet-
ically related offspring. Indeed, stepchildren and adoptees tend to receive less parental invest-
ment and greater mistreatment (e.g. Bertram (1975) for evidence on lions; Daly & Wilson
(1996), Case & Paxson (2001), and Gibson (2009) for evidence on humans). Similar differ-
ential treatment prevails when males suspect infidelity. Evidence based on both animals and
humans indicate that males invest in parental care in response to paternity certainty (birds:
Moller & Birkhead (1993); fish: Neff & Gross (2001); nonhuman primates: Buchan et al
(2003); Langos et al. (2013); humans: Fox & Bruce (2001); Anderson et al. (2007)).
Doubtful males can use a child’s resemblance as a cue of genetic relatedness (Alexander,
1974; Daly & Wilson, 1998; Volk & Quinsey, 2002)2 in lieu of relatively costly paternity
testing.3
This is possible because parent-child resemblance is sufficiently present in chil-
dren for it to be detected from as early as birth (Porter et al., 1984; McLain et al., 2000;
Alvergne et al., 2007; Kaminski et al., 2010). Experiment-based evidence of paternal involve-
ment corroborates this. For example, based on video images of children ages 4 to 72 months,
Volk & Quinsey (2002, 2007) find a man is more prone than a woman to adopt a child looking
like him. Similarly, based on pictures morphed with at least 25% of respondent’s facial traits,
Platek et al. (2002, 2003, 2004) find men (but not women) hypothetically spend more time,
adopt, or provide financial support to toddlers similar to themselves. Moreover, according to
Platek et al. (2004, 2005), neurocognitive processes drive these gender differences. Studies
on actual biological parents also support that men use resemblance as a paternity cue (e.g.
Apicella & Marlowe, 2004; Alvergne et al., 2009). Even fathers convicted of family violence
2Even recent studies on nonhuman primates (e.g Parr et al., 2010; Pfefferle et al, 2014) find evidence that
facial similarities are used to detect kinship.
3Based on the Fragile Family and Child Wellbeing data, we estimate the prevalence of paternity testing is
at most 7% among unmarried families. This estimate comprises the number of cases where paternity was
established through court and the number of cases where DNA results were pending as at 1-year follow-up.
4
 treat children better based on similar facial likeness (Burch & Gallup, 2000). Finally, with
respect to the reliability of reported resemblance, Alvergne et al. (2010) present three key
findings on children as young as 3 months. First, resemblance is consistent when reported in
private by each parent. Second, both parents are more likely to report father-child similarity
when the child actually resembles the father (as determined by external judges). Third,
actual facial likeness predicts paternal investment.
To conclude, many evolutionary sociobiology studies support using father-child resemblance
to explain a putative father’s investment. Because women do not need facial resemblance
cues to decide whether to provide care, we expect baby looks affect child developmental
outcomes only through a father’s investments.4
As we indicated above, when data are
collected in private and separately from each parent, reported resemblance is reliable and
matches actual resemblance.

Data and variable descriptions
We base our empirical analysis on data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing
(FFCW) study. The study follows children born (between 1998 and 2000) to parents in
large U.S. cities. Births to unmarried parents are oversampled to assess living conditions
and wellbeing of children in such families.5 Mothers and putative fathers were separately
interviewed within the first three days of birth and then at four follow-ups.6
Our study
uses data from both parents’ interviews at birth, and then from the mother’s interview at
one-year follow-up. We focus on the first year of birth because that period is crucial for a
nonresident father to create and maintain a bond with a child (Cheadle et al., 2010). We
rely on mothers’ reports because many fathers were lost by 1-year follow-up (about 30% of
all births). This precludes concern of attrition bias due to father non-response.
We focus on unmarried families in which a newborn resides with the mother and the father
lives elsewhere one year later.7 In such fragile families, infidelity and sexual distrust abound
(Hill, 2007); and so, paternal confidence may be relatively low (Anderson et al., 2006). Pa-
ternity may be less of an issue in traditional or cohabiting families, as fathers are already
spending much time there in child investment than in single-mother families. Therefore,
single-mother families are an appropriate setting for this study. Thus, our results should
only be generalized to those at-risk families, which is an important group when considering
policies related to US poverty (Vance, 2016).
4We will verify this by conducting placebo checks to show that father-child resemblance has no significant
effect on child health in a sample of fathers whose involvement is restricted by death or incarceration and in
a sample of two-parent families. We will also show its insignificant effect on maternal parenting channels.
5See Reichman et al. (2001) for more detail information about the design of the FFCW sample.
6Mothers were asked to identify and locate the father by providing his visiting schedules or to pass on
interviewer’s business card to the father (FFCW User Guide).
7We explore the possibility of sample selection issues in section 4.4 and find robust results. We also exclude
cases where the mother reported the father was deceased, unknown, incarcerated at 1-year follow-up, has
never seen the child, or is mandated (through a child support agreement) to visit the child. We later employ
some of these excluded cases for validity testing.

 3.1
Baby looks measure
The FFCW collects baby looks data only at birth from both parents’ responses to the
question:
“Who does the baby looks like?”
While resemblance may change over time
(Alvergne et al., 2007), assessing resemblance at birth is key because that is when fathers
decide paternity. A total of 715 unmarried and non-cohabiting parents responded to this
question.8 We classify a baby as resembling the father if both parents separately reported in
private that the baby looks either wholly or partially like the father.9 This includes situations
when one parent says the baby looks only like the father and the other indicates the baby
looks like both parents. This classification aligns with Platek et al. (2003) who find men
invest in children with at least 25% of their facial traits. Defining father-child resemblance
to occur when both parents agree is consistent with Alvergne et al. (2010) who find that
both parents are likely to see father-child resemblance when the child actually resembles the
father. Of the 715 parents nearly two-thirds (n = 456) agree on whether the baby looks like
or does not look like the father. This is our estimation sample.10 Of these 456 observations,
56% (n=255) agree the child resembles the father, and 44% (n =201) agree the child does not
resemble the father. Table 1 presents summary statistics for the rest of the variables in the
estimation sample. Note from column (3) that, except in a few cases at the 10% level, the
characteristics of the estimation sample are not significantly different from those in which
parents disagree on resemblance (column 4). In section 4.4, we discuss potential selection
issues from choosing our sample in this way.
3.2
Child health indicators
The FFCW data provide mother-reported (subjective) general child health on a five-point
scale ranging from 1=excellent to 5=poor, a variable used in other studies such as Case et al.
(2002) and Currie & Stabile (2003). Due to the low proportion of children in the poor, fair
and good categories, we reclassify child health status as 0=poor/fair/good, 1=very good and
2=excellent, with a frequency of 14.3%, 23.0% and 62.7%, respectively. We also use data
on four specific health outcomes. These include: whether the child experienced an asthma
episode/attack since birth; number of visits to a health care professional for illness since birth;
number of emergency room visits since birth; and the longest stay in hospital. Asthma, in
8In two cities, this question was not asked because it was added to a later version of the survey during
fielding, so that a further 97 observations are excluded. Generally, these observations are not significantly
different in terms of overall child health, paternal investment and socioeconomic conditions. Missing values
still exist for some of the variables listed in table 1. However, these are found to be missing completely at
random (MCAR) based on Little (1988) MCAR test (χ2 = 565.2, d
f = 589, p = 0.753). Thus, analyses are
conducted assuming no bias due to listwise deletion of missing values.
9In section 4.4, we find similar results for two alternative definitions of father-child resemblance: (1) both
parents agree the child looks wholly like the father, and (2) father reports the child resembles him even
when the mother diasgrees —although in this case measurement errors are more likely to occur.
10Our sample size is the highest attainable from the FFCW database, which is most suited for the purpose
of this study. To our knowledge, it is also the largest sample ever used to analyze father-child resemblance
effects. Moreover, our sample size is comparable to other IV studies such as Leonard (2008) and Van Ours
(2004), and much greater than notable ones like Acemoglu et al. (2001).
6
 particular, is a common and growing childhood chronic health illness that is associated with
high health care utilization such as emergency room visits and hospitalization (Akinbami,
2006). The specific child health measures (besides asthma) are not perfect as they may
reflect both true health quality and access to health care or ability to afford more health
care visits. Despite this, in our sample, all child health measures have statistically significant
(p < 0.01) correlations in the expected direction.
Our main health variable is a composite health index, which summarizes the underlying
commonalities among the above five child health indicators using principal component anal-
ysis.11 This continuous composite health measure is effectively a linear combination of all
the five (mean-centered) health indicators. It is scaled so that effects are reported in stan-
dard deviation units, where higher values indicate better health. We prefer to analyze this
composite measure because it encompasses various dimensions of child health. However, we
present results for each health indicator to check robustness. We also give consideration to
related (behavioral) health outcomes (e.g. child temperament, maternal substance use) in
section 4.4.
Table 1 indicates an average subjective child health of 1.5 and an asthma incidence of ap-
proximately 10%. Also, since birth, there were on average four health care visits for illness,
less than two visits to emergency rooms and no more than a day stay in hospital. As sum-
marized by the composite health index, children resembling their father have significantly
more favorable health conditions, based on a simple test of the difference in means between
columns (1) and (2).
3.3
Paternal investment
A priori we do not know which aspect of father involvement is impacted by father-child
resemblance. As such, we consider three potential dimensions through which nonresident
fathers’ investment can occur: (1) economic provision, (2) direct time-investment, and (3)
shared parental responsibilities. Each is measured based on mothers’ reports.12 Economic
provision is measured in two ways. First, it is measured dichotomously by whether the father
provided non-legally binding (informal) financial support in the past year.13 Second, based
on responses (ranging from ‘1=often’ to ‘4=never’) to six questions measuring how frequently
fathers provide in-kind items (e.g. clothes, toys, medicine, food), we compute the average
(reverse-coded) response for each mother. Table 1 shows that 34% of mothers reported the
father provided financial support and the average in-kind support frequency is 2.3 with a
11A single principal component is extracted using the sample of 715 unmarried and non-cohabiting families
(rather than the estimation sample n=456) to capitalize on the greater variation in the health measures.
Note that we get virtually the same results if we standardize each child health indicator (when the order
of the specific health outcomes are reversed), average them to create an index, and then normalize by the
standard deviation of the index.
12Hernandez & Coley (2007) find that either mother’s or father’s reported reliable measures of father in-
volvement in low-income families.
13We tried the amount of financial support, which we had to impute with the mid-point when a range is
provided. It nevertheless suffers from reporting error as it may have been difficult for mothers to recall
the exact amount. The result is similar to the dichotomous measure.
7
 standard deviation of 0.9. Although the proportion of fathers providing financial support is
not significantly higher for those resembling the child, in-kind support is significantly higher.
Fathers’ direct time-investment is defined as the amount of time a nonresident father spends
in active interaction with the child. We rely on two measures of a father’s time-investment:
(1) the number of days in the last month of father-child contact; and (2) the number of
days in a typical week the father engages in positive parenting. Fathers’ positive parenting
involves performing playful, educational (e.g reading, singing nursery rhymes), and child
care activities (e.g. change diapers, feeding, put child to bed).14 Combining these two sets
of father contact and parenting measures yields a single time-investment index of days per
month in which the father performs positive parenting activities.15 It reflects both frequency
and content of visits. Hereafter, we refer to the unit of the index simply as ‘days per month’.
The index ranges from 0 to 30 days and has a mean and standard deviation of approximately
6 days and 8 days, respectively (table 1). Fathers’ time-investment average nearly 2.5 days
more when the child resembled him.
Fathers’ participation in parenting responsibilities are especially related to father’s sensitivity
during interaction with an infant (Feldman, 2000). Fathers who assumed more maternal
functions (child care and chores) have a more emotionally involved relationship with the
child (Abraham et al., 2014). The extent fathers share parenting responsibilities is measured
based on mothers’ reports of how often fathers help with parenting tasks. The FFCW defines
these tasks to be: looking after the child when the mother needs to do things, running errands
(e.g. pick things up from store), taking the child to places (e.g. daycare or the doctor), and
fixing/maintaining the home. Responses range from ‘1=often’ to ‘4=never’. They are reverse
coded and averaged (for each mother) to a create a variable (ranging from 1 to 4) that is
increasing in frequency of shared tasks performed. Shared tasks frequency averages 2.3 with
a standard deviation of 1.0, and is higher for infants resembling the father (table 1).
3.4
Control variables
Table 1 also presents summary statistics for family demographic and socioeconomic control
variables. Unless otherwise specified, the controls are taken from FFCW baseline (at-birth)
survey and measured in percentages. The variables unavailable at baseline, and therefore
measured at 1-year follow-up, are appended with ‘year 1’.
At the first follow-up, the children are approximately one year old, of which about 55% are
boys. Some children were disabled (4.2%) or of low birth weight (11.4%); and just over
20% of births were covered by private health insurance, which indicates that some parents
had better access to physicians and health care. The unmarried parents in this sample knew
each other for typically 3.9 years before pregnancy (compared to 8 years for marrieds), 58.1%
had a visiting or friendly relationship, and nearly one-fourth had other children together.
14Jones & Mosher (2013) use similar activities for children under 5 years to define father engagement in
parenting over the last month. They are used in other surveys such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
15We obtain this index by dividing the father’s contact days/month (measure 1) by 7 days/week yielding
contact weeks/month, which we then multiply by the average number of days/week engaged in each activity
(measure 2) to generate the index denominated in activity days per month.
8
 Parents were mainly black (nearly 70%); and about 25% of mothers gave birth as a teenager,
whereas only about 15% of fathers were teenagers. Over a third of parents had kids in a
previous relationship at baseline, and some mothers (about 12%) lived with a new partner
when asked at 1-year follow-up. Fathers were more likely to be in very good/excellent health
(70%) and to have at least high school education (62.7%) relative to mothers (63.6% and
57%, respectively). At the time the child was born, about 40% of fathers had an incarceration
history, and just over 75% had a job. Mothers earned on average $242 weekly, when they last
worked prior to birth; and almost one-third of them were homeowners. Nearly half (45.8%)
of the mothers had received welfare prior to birth. At 1-year follow-up, mothers tended to
have strong social support;16 and 62.1% of children were regularly in the care of a non-parent
(mainly mother’s relatives or daycare for typically 40 hours per week).
Importantly, in most cases these sample characteristics do not differ significantly (at the
10% level) by father-child resemblance. An interesting difference, however, with ties to the
literature on son preference (e.g. Dahl & Moretti, 2008), is that boys are more likely reported
as resembling the father. These studies find fathers time allocation is generally higher for
boys than girls. While little support for this exist in fragile families (Lundberg et al., 2007),
we nonetheless control for child gender to identify resemblance effects on father’s involvement.
We also show later in section 4.2 there is little or no evidence that the effects of father child
resemblance differ by child gender.

Empirical results
In this section, we explore how father-child resemblance relates to child health one-year
post-birth. In addition, analysis at and prior to birth serves as a placebo test for instrument
validity. Based on these relationships, we show father-child resemblance represents paternal
investment. Next, we identify the specific paternal investment mechanisms through which
father-child resemblance operates to impact child health. We then measure this impact using
the 2SLS method.
4.1
Father-child resemblance and infant health
Effect of resemblance on health at one-year of age
We first estimate the relationship between at-birth father-child resemblance and child health
one year later, holding constant the controls previously described. Later in section 4.4, we
extend our analysis to other (behavioral) health outcomes. Note that as long as father-child
resemblance is uncorrelated with unobservable factors in child health, our estimate represents
a causal effect. Estimates are reported in column 1 of table 2 for each child health indicator.
The first row shows that the effect of father-child resemblance on the computed composite
16Social support is measured as the average of mother’s responses (yes = 1, no = 0) to whether she could
count on someone to (1) loan her $200, (2) provide her a place to live, and (3) help with emergency child
care, next year. The score ranges from 0 to 1 with higher scores indicating greater access to social support.

 child health index is positive (0.297 standard deviations) and statistically significant. Rows
2 to 6 give results for the FFCW health measures as robustness checks. The 0.283 effect
on latent subjective child health (row 2), expressed as a marginal probability effect, implies
a child resembling the father is 5.4 percentage points (pp) less likely to report low health
(good/fair/poor); 4 pp less likely to report very good health; and 9.4 pp more likely to report
excellent health. Additionally, resembling the father reduces the incidence of child asthma
episodes by 6.7 pp (row 3), decreases child visits to health practitioners for illness by 21.4%
(row 4), cuts child visits to the emergency room by 23.5% (row 5), and decreases a child’s
longest stay in hospital by 54.7% (row 6). The magnitude for hospital stay should be inter-
preted with caution because several large outlier hospital days for children not resembling
the father inflate the health gains for those resembling the father.17
It is possible that the effects of father-child resemblance on child health differ by child gender.
Table 2 reports the estimated effects of father-child resemblance on each child health measure
for boys (column 2) and girls (column 3), in addition to the differential effects (column
4).
Using the composite child health measure (row 1), we find father-child resemblance
significantly increases child health for both boys and girls but there is no differential effect
by gender. Roughly similar results are obtained when examining each child health indicator
separately. The effect of father-child resemblance on subjective child health is greater (and
significant) for boys (row 2), but father-child resemblance has a greater (and significant)
effect for girls when child health is denoted by visits for illness (row 4) and emergency visits
(row 5). The difference in effects appears small for asthma (row 3) and hospital stay (row
6). However, again, the specific health effects do not significantly differ by gender.
Effect of resemblance on health at birth and before: a placebo test
So far, we have taken our resemblance variable as exogenous because it is based on both the
purported father’s and mother’s consistent responses at birth, each obtained independent of
the other. But, it is possible for both parents to respond positively (or negatively) to father-
child resemblance for reasons related to child health one year after birth. For example, a
mother might specify a father resembles the child in order to entice the purported father to
invest in the child, regardless of whether the child is his. Alternatively, resemblance to the
father might be harder to detect for poorly formed babies with lasting health problems. In
these cases, a father’s alleged resemblance would not be exogenous since it would then be
correlated with an unobservable component of child health.
We follow Kuehnle (2014) and perform an instrument placebo-test to determine whether
father-child resemblance is related to child health not one year after the child is born, but
instead at an earlier time during pregnancy or at-birth. At such times, father-child resem-
17Removing the observations with outlier days of hospital stay from the sample reduced the -0.547 coefficient
to -0.060. Doing so, however, had little or no effect on the coefficients for the other health variables,
which are not similarly affected by those observations. In addition, we also checked whether father-child
resemblance affects overnight hospital stays. The effect is 0.1 pp (p = 0.
972). This implies resemblance has
no effect on the incidence of hospitalization. One interpretation is that resemblance affects the intensive
margin in terms of the severity of injury/illness as indicated by a child’s longest stay in hospital.
10
 blance could not have an effect on child health. Thus, one would be suspect if earlier child
health indicators correlate with our resemblance measure. We consider: low birth weight,
prenatal maternal health, prenatal substance use, whether doctor was seen during the first
trimester, and disability.18 Table 3 shows the effect of father-child resemblance on each of
the binary prenatal/at-birth child health variables, holding constant the controls (in table 1)
excluding mother’s health, low birth weight and disability. We find in all cases that the es-
timated resemblance effects are statistically insignificant. These results support instrument
validity and hence the causal effect of father-child resemblance on child health, one-year
post-birth.
An implication of resemblance raising health one-year later, but not at birth
As explained in section 2, evolutionary theory predicts doubtful fathers use father-child
resemblance as a cue of genetic relatedness to decide whether to invest in a child. These
investments may explain why resemblance enhances child health one-year later, but not
at birth. To validate such paternal investment, we now examine the effect of father-child
resemblance on child health in two samples in which father-child resemblance is unlikely to
matter as a paternity cue. Finding no effect of resemblance on child health in these samples
serves as a placebo test to help substantiate father investment as a causal factor.
First, we extract from the FFCW database a sample of nonresident fathers (n = 63) whose
involvement is restricted because they died or were incarcerated.19 We regress the composite
child health index on father-child resemblance and an incarceration dummy, without the
controls listed in table 1 due to the small sample size. The estimated father-child resemblance
effect (0.087 standard deviations, s.e.= 0.279) is small and statistically insignificant compared
to the corresponding estimate in the main sample (when no controls are used) of 0.231
standard deviations (s.e. = 0.095). Second, we extract an FFCW sample of stable two-
parent families (n = 1105).20 In such families, paternal confidence is relatively high and
hence, father-child resemblance is unlikely to matter to a father’s decision to invest. Again,
we find the effect of resemblance on the composite child health index (using the controls in
table 1) is statistically insignificant (0.044 standard deviations, s.e. = 0.056). These two
samples provide indirect evidence that paternal investment is a key link between father-child
resemblance and child health.
18Disability is only reported by the mother at 1-year follow-up (because they were interviewed within the first
three days of birth), so it is possible some disabilities may not have been present at birth. We would have
liked to use other indicators of fetal health such as gestational age and mother’s BMI during pregnancy,
but they were not available.
19The event of death or incarceration is determined at the time of the one-year follow-up interview. So, it is
possible that some fathers were involved for some time prior to the event.
20Two-parent families include a mother, the putative father and their children living in the same household
over the first two waves of the FFCW study.

 4.2
Father-child resemblance and paternal investment mechanisms
The previous findings suggest at-birth father-child resemblance enhances child health be-
cause a father invests more in a child that looks like him. We now explore the probable
avenues through which such investments take place. Later in section 4.4, we also examine
other plausible parenting channels and find little evidence supporting them. The FFCW
data offer four possible ways fathers can invest in their children. We attempt to rule out
some of these avenues to better isolate the underlying investment mechanism through which
father-child resemblance operates. To do so, we regress each of four types of paternal invest-
ment on father-child resemblance and report the results in table 4 (column 1). Even after
controlling for a number of parental and child characteristics (in table 1), we find fathers re-
act positively to father-child resemblance; however, not equally for each type of investment.
A child resembling the father increases the father’s frequency of in-kind support (row 2), his
time-investment (row 3), and his sharing in parental tasks (row 4), but the effect on financial
support (row 1), though positive, is not statistically significant. In-kind support frequency
increases by 0.17 (or about 7% — effect divided by variable’s mean), time-investment in-
creases by 2.5 days per month (or about 40%), and shared responsibility increases by 0.24
(or about 10%) when a child resembles the father. Resemblance better explains a father’s
time-investment (F = 11.
5, partial r2 = 2.
5%), compared to a father’s shared responsibility
(F = 5.
7, partial r2 = 1.
4%) and his in-kind support (F = 3.
5, partial r2 = 0.
9%). These
results are consistent with the nonresident fathers in our sample using resemblance to assess
paternity, and from this deciding whether to devote non-pecuniary investment resources,
especially time, in their reputed child.
It is possible that fathers choose to respond differently to father-child resemblance depending
on child gender. For instance, if fathers already have a son preference (Dahl & Moretti, 2008;
Mammen, 2011), they may prefer to invest more time in boys than girls when there is father-
child resemblance. Table 4 provides the estimated effects of father-child resemblance on each
dimension of paternal investment for boys (column 2) and girls (column 3), as well as the
differential effects (column 4). The estimates suggest that father-child resemblance increases
a father’s in-kind support frequency (albeit insignificantly in row 2) and his time-investment
(row 3) by the same extent for boys and girls. However, father-child resemblance appears to
have a greater (and significant) effect on financial support (row 1) and shared parental tasks
(row 4) for girls. Still, we cannot reject the equality of any coefficients by gender. We find no
compelling evidence that fathers’ investment response to father-child resemblance differ by
gender. These results are consistent with Lundberg et al.’s (2007) finding of little evidence
that child gender matters to father involvement one year after birth in unmarried families.
Given an F-statistic that exceeds 10 for the overall effect of father-child resemblance on
father’s time-investment (against the null that father-child resemblance is irrelevant), we now
use father-child resemblance as an instrumental variable (IV) to determine whether father’s
time-investment augments child health.21 Ascertaining this link alleviates endogeneity issues
21The fact that father-child resemblance explains little variation in shared tasks and financial/in-kind support
does not necessarily invalidate their importance to child health. Father-child resemblance may be only one
of many exogenous sources of variation in these factors that also relate to child health.
12
 plaguing earlier research alluded to in the introduction that attempts to estimate the causal
effect of a nonresident father’s time on child health.
4.3
Measuring the health benefits of father’s time-investment
If at-birth father-child resemblance works through father’s time-investments, then fathers
who invest more (spend more time doing positive parenting) should have healthier children.22
To quantify this possible path to better child health, we specify the production function for
child health in family i (Hi ) as:
Hi = α1Ii + α�
2Xi + �i
(1)
where Ii is at-birth father time-investment, Xi is the vector of demographic/socioeconomic
controls (listed in table 1) with the first element being one, and �i is an error term containing
unobservable health factors. The constant coefficient α1 is a measure of the general impact
of paternal time-investment on child health.23 As discussed in the introduction, standard
estimation can result in biased estimates due to endogeneity. Nevertheless, for comparison,
we present standard estimates of α1 in table 5, column 1.
The first row of column 1 shows the impact of father’s time-investment on the composite child
health index. It is statistically insignificant. The second to sixth rows present the impact
of the father time-investment variable on the separate health measures, again indicating no
statistical significance. These results imply fathers’ time-investments provide little or no child
health benefits, and is consistent with Amato & Gilbreth’s (1999) and Hofferth & Pinzon’s
(2011) findings that contact frequency is unrelated to child health and general wellbeing.
However, these results may be unreliable given the concerns about father investment being
endogenous, namely E[�i|Ii, Xi] �= 0. Hence, we use a two-stage IV approach to quantify the
health impact of father’s time.
To derive causal effects, we utilize father-child resemblance as an instrument for father
time-investment. As explained, the evolutionary sociobiology literature discussed in section
2 motivates the use of father-child resemblance as an IV. Moreover, subsections 4.1 and
4.2 provide results that support both the relevance and validity of using the father-child
resemblance measure. Hence, the first-stage in the IV approach is:
Ii = β1Ri + β�
2Xi + υi
(2)
where Ii and Xi are as already defined, Ri is father-child resemblance, and υi is an error
term. The second-stage is given by equation 1, where now Ii is determined by equation 2.
This approach identifies the causal effect of fathers’ time-investment for those fathers whose
time is affected by child resemblance. In fact, we only identify the effect for those fathers
22We do not present results for financial support, in-kind support and shared parental tasks because in table
4 they have an F-statistic (square of the t-value for the coefficient on father-child resemblance) much lower
than 10, the rule-of-thumb acceptable for a variable to serve as a strong instrument.
23Since we found little evidence for heterogeneous effects of father-child resemblance by child gender (although
partly due to the limited statistical power of the data), we proceed assuming homogeneous effects.
13
 who respond to the presence (absence) of father-child resemblance by raising (lowering) time-
investment —these fathers are the so-called ‘compliers’. To show this, figure 1 provides the
empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDF) for paternal time-investment by whether
father-child resemblance exists, as well as the differences in the CDFs (gray dotted line).
The CDF for no father-child resemblance (thin dashed line) lies above the CDF for father-
child resemblance (thick line). That is, at any given level of time-investment, a father with
no resemblance to his child is likely to invest less than a father resembling his child. Such
evidence supports a key assumption (individual-level monotonicity) for identifying a causal
effect for compliers (Angrist & Imbens, 1995). Since the IV estimate of α1 is a weighted
average, where weights are the fraction of fathers switched by father-child resemblance from
one level of time-investment to another, like Angrist & Imbens (1995) we can examine the
differences in the CDFs (which are proportional to the weights) to infer the characteristics of
the group contributing more to our IV estimate. As such, figure 1 indicates that fathers with
relatively low time-investments contribute more to our IV estimate. Based on the FFCW
baseline data, these fathers are significantly more likely to have employment, children of
another mother, or an incarceration history.
Estimated effects of father time-investment on all child health measures are presented in
column 2 of table 5. Accounting for endogeneity using father-child resemblance as an instru-
ment yields significant effects of time-investment on child health.24 Unlike the zero-effects for
the non-IV case (column 1), we find that an additional activity day (per month) of fathers’
time-investment (induced by father-child resemblance) implies a 0.117 standard deviation
increase in composite child health. In regard to subjective child health, this one extra ac-
tivity day per month raises child health by 0.089 units, which implies a 2.1 pp reduction in
the probability of low health and a 2.8 pp increase in the probability of excellent health (not
reported in table). When we consider more specific health outcomes, as robustness checks,
we also find consistent evidence of health gains: lower probability of asthma episodes (by
2.7 pp), visits to health practitioners for illness (by 5.4%), visits to the emergency room (by
9.1%), and length of hospital stays (by 22.3%). Although we are cautious about interpreting
the effect magnitude for hospital stay because of outlier hospital days that inflate the health
benefits in favor of children resembling their father, we generally find important positive
effects of fathers’ time-investment on child health.
To put the effects on overall child health in context, nearly an extra week per month in
which a visiting father engages in positive parenting activities can provide the same gains
in composite health (0.554) or subjective general health (0.514) as the presence of a social
24The large difference between the non-IV and IV estimates suggest the influence of endogeneity. In fact, the
statistically significant and negative estimated correlation (−0.
614) between the unobservables of health
and father involvement (υi, �i) in the IV ordered probit specification for subjective child health reveals
that omitted variables may be at play. The omitted variable is possibly unobserved maternal ability. That
is, the degree of mothers’ self-reliance or protective (gatekeeping) behavior is negatively related to father
involvement. Attenuation bias due to measurement error in mother-reported father involvement is also
likely to have contributed to the large difference in non-IV and IV estimates. Moreover, since IV only
estimates the effect for the complier population, the presence of population heterogeneity may also explain
the large difference in estimates as well.
14
 father (mother’s new partner).25 This would require the typical visiting father (who performs
activities in about 8 days/mo.) to be involved for up to 15 days/mo., relative to the 20
activity days of the typical social father. In another context, if a typical visiting father
engages with the child all weekends (about 9 days/mo.), the resulting 2.1 pp decline in low
child health would be half the effect of doubling household income (Case et al. (2002) report
-4 pp for children ages 0-3 years).
4.4
Robustness checks
Sample selection
Our sample consists of out of wedlock mothers who remain unmarried one year post-birth
and reside with their child. A potential problem is that this sample selection may be driven
by father-child resemblance if such a paternity cue causes doubtful fathers to cohabit or
marry. Thus, our sample would exclude those fathers who would have been single absent the
paternity cue. To examine this possibility, we augment our sample of mother-only families
to include all other family types. Then, we estimate the effect of father-child resemblance
on fathers’ decision to move-in (i.e. either cohabit or marry). Table 6, column (1), reports
a statistically insignificant effect of 0.4 pp on the probability of moving-in. Further, we
assess the impact of a father resembling the child in mother-only and other family settings
by interacting child-resemblance with family setting status. Columns (2) and (3) report
resemblance effects of 2.185 and 0.246 respectively for mother-only families, but no significant
effects for other family types. Moreover, the ratio of the two estimates (0.246/2.185) for
mother-only families provides a 0.113 IV estimate, about the same as that reported for
composite health in table 5, column (2). Thus, there is no significant evidence that father-
child resemblance affects family composition, but even if so, the results remain qualitatively
the same.
Another potentially complicating selection problem is our sample may over-represent couples
who are more cooperative or less conflictual as manifested by their consistent responses to
whether the child looks like the father. To assess this possibility, we provide four pieces
of evidence. First, we note that the fraction of mother-only families in our sample who
agree on baby looks is 64% which is comparable to the 66% for two-parent families. Second,
we compare our sample of couples who agree on baby looks (column (3) of table 1) to
those who disagree (the excluded cases in column (4) of table 1). Though not foolproof,
if all observed characteristics are similar between the two groups, we suspect they are also
comparable with respect to relationship compatibility. This comparison yields virtually no
significant differences. Particularly relevant are at-birth relationship status (i.e. cohabiting
or visiting/friends) and whether parents already share a child together. However, there is
a marginally significant (p = 0.093) difference in the number of years parents have known
each other prior to pregnancy, albeit only 0.6 years lower for the sample of couples who
25Bzostek (2008) also finds child health benefits of a social father in fragile families. Social fathers may be
able to bond with young children more than older ones, who tend to fare worse in step-father families
(Case & Paxson, 2001).
15
 agree on baby looks.
Third, we augment the estimation sample to include couples who
disagree about baby looks (i.e. n = 715). Then, we include in our regressions a dummy for
whether couples disagree about baby looks and another for whether couples agree on father-
child resemblance, where the omitted category is those couples who agree on no father-child
resemblance. Table 7 confirms that the estimated father-child resemblance effects on time-
investment and composite child health (of 2.756 and 0.291 respectively) are robust to this
particular selectivity issue. Fourth, we use retrospective data collected at birth to create two
scales, relationship conflict and supportiveness.26 Table 8, columns (1) and (2), shows neither
scale is significantly related to whether couples agree on resemblance. Further, controlling
for these scales in columns (3) to (6) does not significantly alter our findings. This means
at-birth relationship quality also does not appear to confound the relationship between child
health and at-birth resemblance.
Alternative versions of the IV
To minimize measurement error, we eliminated families whose purported father reported the
child looks like him but the mother disagreed. However, it is not unreasonable to argue
observations on such families may be relevant if fathers allocate their time based on their
beliefs independent of whether the mother agrees. For robustness, we check whether adding
these observations alters our results. In doing so, we expect OLS estimation will be negatively
biased if the true effect of father-child resemblance on paternal investment and child health is
positive because of potential measurement errors. Column (2) of table 9 provides the results
from a version of the instrument (IV2) that includes fathers’ reported resemblance to the
child when the mother disagrees, while column (1) reproduces the main findings from the
original instrument (IV1). We find smaller resemblance effects on father time-investment
(1.864) and overall child health (0.207), but they remain statistically significant. Moreover,
the IV estimate of 0.108 (i.e. 0.207/1.864) is similar to the main estimate (0.117).
We also included in our original sample couples who report partial resemblance (i.e. child
looks like both parents).
However, doing so might bias our results if those couples are
also more willing to compromise or if they find it harder to detect resemblance, which may
directly relate to child health. We test this possibility by dropping cases where either parent
reports partial, but not full resemblance to the father (IV2). Based on IV2, the estimated
resemblance effects shown in table 9, column (2) are 2.219 for father time-investment and
0.264 for composite child health, with an implied IV effect of 0.119. Since these estimates
compare favorably to those reported for IV1 in column (1), it appears our results are robust
to this possible problem.
26We are cautious about the use of these scales as responses may have been elicited from observing child
resemblance. The relationship conflict scale is constructed from averaging couples’ responses to questions
asking how often they argue about sex, the pregnancy, money, faithfulness etc. The supportiveness scale is
similarly constructed from five questions asking how often the other parent is fair and willing to compromise,
loving and affectionate, encouraging etc.
16
 Other parenting and health outcomes
Earlier we presented evidence that paternal time-investment explains the effect of father-child
resemblance on child health. Here, we check whether such resemblance might be associated
with other parenting outcomes that may in turn affect child health. Table 10 presents these
outcomes as reported by the mother at 1-year follow-up. The first two outcomes relate to di-
mensions of a father’s parenting that involve the use of spanking as well as cooperating with
the mother in parenting (e.g. respects schedules, can be counted on). We find no significant
effect of father-child resemblance in either case. Regarding maternal parenting, if a mother
likes/dislikes the father, her child’s resemblance to him might influence the manner in which
she treats the child. Any such treatment may be reflected in her time-investment, aggravation
in parenting (e.g. feels trapped by duties), and use of spanking. Rows 3-6 report no statisti-
cally significant effects of father-child resemblance on these outcomes, though the coefficient
signs indicate beneficial effects. Additionally, the positive effect on baby’s grandmother mov-
ing in is not significant. Thus, we find no strong support for these parenting outcomes as
the mechanisms through which resemblance affects child health. Overall evidence reaffirms
that father-child resemblance likely operates through fathers’ time-investments.
We have focused on child (physical) health outcomes, but resemblance may plausibly be
related to behavioral health and maternal health outcomes.
For instance, a father’s in-
volvement might disrupt the home environment causing emotional distress or provide an
opportunity for the mother to invest in her own health. Based on rows 7-8, we find no statis-
tically significant evidence linking father-child resemblance to mothers’ self-reported health
and depression, despite the gains implied by the coefficient signs. Similarly, rows 9-11 show
that any resemblance-induced paternal involvement does not appear to assist with mater-
nal substance use and breastfeeding, nor does it significantly affect a child’s temperamental
behavior.
Assessing the exclusion restriction
Our IV estimates rely on father-child resemblance affecting child health only through father’s
time-investment. While the FFCW data provide paternal investment channels and other par-
enting channels, there are potentially unobserved means by which father-child resemblance
may independently impact child health (e.g. the quality of the father-child interaction). To
explore this possibility, we estimate the impact of father-child resemblance on child health
in a small FFCW sample (n = 39) of nonresident fathers whose visitations are restricted by
court order (as part of their child support agreement). Although these fathers are forced
to provide financial support and time, they can still choose to be involved in other ways.
The estimated relationship between father-child resemblance and the composite child health
index in this sample should therefore measure the combined effects of these other causal
pathways. We find, without controls, no significant relationship (−0.
092, s.e. = 0.321). Re-
gardless of this suggestive evidence and others we have presented, we cannot definitively rule
out intermediate channels other than time-investment, though we believe time-investment
to be a key channel.

Conclusion
Early childhood development is an important precursor for future success. Children in single-
parent households are most vulnerable. Parental inputs are potentially crucial. But current
research yields ambiguous results regarding many of these inputs. This study uses father-
child resemblance to show the importance of fathers’ investment in child health. The idea
is that, due to paternity uncertainty, a man assesses genetic relatedness based on whether
the child resembles him and uses this information to direct investment resources to the
child. This prediction is supported in experimental studies based on animal/human families
in evolution-related disciplines, but to date has not been used in economic research. We
employ rich US national data on unmarried families with nonresident fathers taken from
the first two waves of the Fragile Family and Child Wellbeing (FFCW) study. This data is
appropriate since paternity uncertainty is more likely to prevail among fragile families.
We find a child’s health indicators improve when the child looks like the father. We also find
father-child resemblance acts as a paternity cue used by men especially for making time-
investment decisions. IV estimation confirms a statistically significant and positive impact
of fathers’ time-investment on child health. One possible explanation is that frequent father
visits allow for greater parental time for care-giving and supervision, and for information
gathering about child health and economic needs.
This study supports policies for encouraging nonresident fathers to engage in frequent posi-
tive parenting to improve early childhood health. However, because father-child resemblance
is not manipulable, it cannot serve as a policy tool to achieve the desired changes in nonres-
ident father’s time. Nevertheless, since our complier analysis (in section 4.3) suggests that
nonresident fathers with relatively low time-investment are more responsive to father-child
resemblance, appropriate policies can be designed and targeted at increasing their involve-
ment to achieve improvements in child health. As such, greater efforts could be made to
encourage these fathers to frequently engage their children through parenting classes, health
education, and job training to enhance earnings.
It is unclear to what extent our finding that paternal time-investment improves child health
in at-risk families can be generalized. Similar evidence in another family setting is found by
Case & Paxson (2001) who, while concluding maternal primacy in child care, find nonres-
ident fathers’ regular contact protects the health investments of children living with step-
fathers. Nevertheless, the health benefits we find may be due to the specific circumstances
and behavioral traits of parents in at-risk families. Although at the very least our find-
ings can inform policies related to US poverty, it is useful for future research to explore
whether similar child health gains from paternal time-investment can be realized in more
intact families.

Notes: Sample size n=456. The table reports estimated coefficients and standard
errors derived from running separate regressions for different health outcomes and
by whether an IV is used. The coefficients of row 1 indicate the change in the num-
ber of standard deviations of the composite health index due to one-extra activity
day per month of father time-investment. The coefficients in row 2 are interpreted
as the effect on latent child health due to one-extra activity day per month of father
time-investment. The coefficients in row 3 are the marginal change in the proba-
bility of asthma due to an extra activity day per month of father time-investment.
For rows 4-6, the coefficients (× 100) indicate the percentage effect of one-extra
activity day per month of father time-investment on the indicated child health out-
comes. The Poisson method used to estimate the coefficients in rows 4-5 assumes a
multiplicative error. When the outcome variable is length of hospital stay (row 6),
the Poisson method with multiplicative error did not converge to a solution, and
we instead assume the less intuitively appealing additive error. Controls used in
all regressions are the same as those listed in table 1. Robust standard errors in
parentheses. †p < 0.

Notes: FCR is father-child resemblance. Sample size n=1855. Our sample of unmarried
mother-only families is adjusted to include all other family types (at waves 1 and 2). Col-

birth to cohabit or marry at 1-year follow-up). Controls for columns (1) and (2) are those
listed in table 1, except at-birth living status. Estimates in columns (2) and (3) are first-
stage and reduced-form effects, respectively, of father-child resemblance for mother-only
families (‘FCR × Mother-only’ coefficient) and for other family types (FCR coefficient).

Notes: FCR is father-child resemblance. Each column of estimates comes from running a separate regres-

(2) are marginal probability effects. The relationship conflict scale is the average at-birth (reversed-coded)
parental responses (‘1=often’, ‘3=never’) to six questions regarding how often the other parent disagree
about money, spending time, sex, pregnancy, alcohol/drug use, and being faithful. The supportiveness scale
is the average at-birth (reversed-coded) parental responses (‘1=often’, ‘3=never’) to five questions regarding
how often the other parent is fair and willing to compromise, loving and affectionate, critical, abusing, and
encouraging. Controls are those listed in table 1, in addition to the relationship conflict or supportiveness

Notes: The table reports results for three versions of the resemblance instru-
ment. IV1, our main instrument, is constructed from the consistent private
responses of both parents regarding whether a child resembles (wholly or par-
tially) the father (mean of IV2 is 0.56). IV2 modifies IV1 by adding cases
(n=165) where the father believes the child resembles him when the mother
disagrees (mean of IV2 is 0.67). IV3 modifies IV1 by dropping cases (n=59)
where either parent reports partial resemblance to the father (mean of IV3 is
0.49). Each coefficient derives from a separate OLS regression. Row 1 reports
the first-stage effects, and row 2 reports the reduced-form effects. Controls
are the same as those listed in table 1. Robust standard errors in parentheses.

The table report coefficients derived from running separate regres-
sions for various parenting and health outcomes. Coefficients for the probit method are reported
as marginal probability effects. Cooperative parenting averages mothers’ (reverse-coded) responses
(ranging from ‘1=always’ to ‘3=rarely’) to six questions regarding how often, for e.g. father acts
like father she wants for child, can count on father to watch child, father respects schedules/rules
for child etc. Maternal time-investment is defined similarly to paternal time-investment. Aggrava-
tion in parenting averages mothers’ (reverse-coded) responses (ranging from ‘1=strongly disagree’
to ‘3=strongly agree’) to four questions regarding the extent she feels trapped by parental duties,
being a parent harder than thought, child care more work than pleasure, and tired and worn out
from raising family. Child emotionality and shyness averages mothers’ (reverse-coded) responses
(ranging from ‘1=least like’ to ‘3=most like’) to six questions regarding, for e.g., the extent child
is shy, fusses and cries, sociable, upset easily etc. Controls are the same as those listed in table 1.
