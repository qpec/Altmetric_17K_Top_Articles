ABSTRACT
This study investigated the network of genes that are co-expressed with androgen 
receptor (AR) to discover novel AR targets in breast cancer. Bioinformatics analysis 
of two datasets from breast cancer cell lines resulted in the identification of an AR-
gene signature constituted of 98 genes that highly correlated with AR expression. 
Notably, C1orf64 showed the highest positive correlation with AR across the datasets 
with a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.737. In addition, C1orf64 closely correlated 
with AR expression in primary and metastatic breast tumors and C1orf64 expression 
was relatively higher in breast tumors with a lower grade and lobular histology. 
Furthermore, there is a functional interplay between AR and C1orf64 in breast cancer. 
In this process, AR activation directly represses C1orf64 transcription and C1orf64, 
in turn, interacts with AR as a corepressor and negatively regulates the AR-mediated 
induction of prolactin-induced protein (PIP) and AR reporter activity. Moreover, the 
corepressor effect of C1orf64 results in a reduction of AR binding to PIP promoter. The 
other aspect of this interplay involves a cross-talk between AR and estrogen receptor 
(ER) signaling in which C1orf64 silencing intensifies the AR-mediated down-regulation 
of ER target gene, progesterone receptor. Therefore, the repression of C1orf64 by AR 
provides an underlying mechanism for the AR inhibitory effects on ER signaling. To 
elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of C1orf64 function, this study demonstrates 
that C1orf64 is a phosphothreonine protein that interacts with the chaperone protein 
14-3-3. In summary, C1orf64 is a novel AR coregulator and a 14-3-3 binding partner 
in breast cancer.
INTRODUCTION
Recent advancements in the molecular profiling 
and cancer genomics have provided the opportunity for 
a better understanding of breast cancer biology and the 
discovery of novel therapeutic targets in this disease. In 
this process, androgen receptor (AR) has been identified as 
a key molecular marker in breast cancer that is expressed 
in 90% of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and 50% of ER-
negative breast tumors [1–4]. The subtype of ER-negative 
breast cancer that has a high level of AR expression is 
termed “molecular apocrine” and is characterized by a 
steroid-response gene signature that includes AR, FOXA1, 
and prolactin-induced protein (PIP), [5–7]. These findings 
have resulted in a growing interest in the understanding of 
molecular functions and therapeutic implications of AR in 
breast cancer.
Studies conducted by my group and others have 
revealed that AR as a transcription factor has an important 
function in the regulation of key signaling pathways in breast 
cancer [4, 8–12]. This includes a positive feedback loop 
between AR and ErbB2-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
(ERK) signaling in molecular apocrine cells [4, 9, 12]. In 
this feedback loop, AR regulates ERK phosphorylation 
through the transcriptional activation of ErbB2 and, in turn, 
the ERK-CREB1 signaling regulates AR transcription [9]. 
Furthermore, AR acts as a transcriptional activator of PIP, a 
characteristic biomarker in breast cancer, which is required 
for cell cycle progression in both ER-positive and ER-
negative breast cancer cells [8, 11, 13–15]. Moreover, studies

on molecular apocrine cell line MDA-MB-453 demonstrated 
that AR induces the WNT7B-ErbB3 signaling and there is 
a transcriptional interaction between AR and FOXA1 in 
these cells [10, 16]. Importantly, multiple preclinical studies 
have suggested a potential role for AR as a therapeutic target 
in breast cancer and currently this topic is under active 
investigation in clinical trials [4, 6, 12, 17–19]. Despite the 
emerging data on the importance of AR function in breast 
cancer, the available studies have been mostly conducted on 
a limited number of cell line models and broader molecular 
functions of AR in breast cancer including key targets and 
coregulators of this gene have remained largely unknown.
To address these shortcomings, my group has 
recently examined gene expression data from a cohort of 
52 breast cancer cell lines to identify a network of AR 
co-expressed genes [20]. This study has identified an “AR-
gene signature” composed of 35 genes that were highly co-
expressed with AR across the dataset (absolute correlation 
coefficient |CC|> 0.6), [20]. In this process, gene encoding 
factor VII (F7) was identified as a novel AR target gene. 
Importantly, AR activation in breast cancer cells induces 
endogenous factor VII (FVII) activity to convert factor 
X to Xa in conjunction with the tissue factor (TF), [20]. 
This activation of coagulation FVII by AR provides a 
novel mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of 
ectopic FVII expression in cancer cells. In addition, this 
model implicates a potential role for AR signaling in the 
pathobiology of thromboembolic events and regulation of 
FVII/TF signaling in breast cancer [20].
Therefore, the study of AR co-expressed genes 
in large genomic datasets would provide an innovative 
approach to investigate AR molecular functions and 
novel target genes in breast cancer. This approach ensures 
that different molecular subtypes of breast cancer are 
represented in the study and the identified genes are highly 
correlated with AR expression in a large non-biased model 
of this disease. Importantly, the identified AR co-expressed 
genes are likely to include biologically significant AR 
target genes and transcriptional coregulators that are 
present across different subtypes of breast cancer. In the 
current study, this approach has been further explored by 
a combined analysis of two large expression datasets in 
breast cancer to identify an AR-gene signature of highly 
co-expressed genes followed by the transcriptional and 
functional studies of some of the key findings. Notably, this 
study identifies a poorly-understood gene “C1orf64” as both 
a novel target gene and a coregulator of AR in breast cancer 
that interacts with 14-3-3 protein.
RESULTS
A transcriptional signature of AR co-expressed 
genes in two datasets
To identify a gene-signature that highly correlates 
with AR expression in breast cancer, two expression 
microarray datasets were analyzed from studies published 
by Neve et al. (study 1) and Kao et al. (study 2) as 
explained in methods [21, 22]. It is notable that study 1 
and study 2 included 52 and 50 breast cancer cell lines, 
respectively. In addition, a total of 37 cell lines were in 
common and a total of 28 cell lines varied between the two 
cohorts. Initially, a list of highly co-expressed genes with 
AR was identified in each dataset using a cutoff of |CC| of 
≥ 0.6, p< 0.001 and then a combined “AR-gene signature” 
was generated by compiling the subset of AR co-expressed 
genes in both cohorts (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 
1). Furthermore, genes represented on both microarray 
platforms that had a significant correlation with AR 
expression in each of the datasets (p< 0.05) were identified 
(Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1).
The combined AR-gene signature included a total of 
98 genes apart from AR itself (Table 1 and Supplementary 
Table 1). Importantly, C1orf64 showed the highest positive 
correlation with AR expression in this signature with a CC 
value of 0.737 (Table 1). Furthermore, there were only 
three other genes in the AR-signature that had a positive 
CC > 0.7 namely, SIDT1, F7, and PATZ1 (Table 1). It 
is notable that F7, which we have previously identified 
as an AR target gene [20], demonstrated a significant 
correlation with AR expression in both datasets (Table 
1 and Supplementary Table 1). In addition, a total of 52 
genes in the combined AR-signature overlapped between 
the two expression microarray platforms and among these 
a subset of 38 genes showed significant CC values with 
AR expression (p< 0.05) in both cohorts (Table 1 and 
Supplementary Table 1).
Next, functional annotations of the combined AR-
gene signature were assessed using DAVID Bioinformatics 
Resources (Table 2). In this process, fold enrichment (FE) 
and p value for each functional term in GOTERM and 
INTERPRO categories were obtained (Table 2). Notably, 
there were five significant GOTERM functional terms in 
the AR-signature (p< 0.05) and the top two categories 
included “sequence-specific DNA binding” (FE: 3, p= 
0.005) and “transcription factor binding” (FE: 2.9, p= 
0.02), (Table 2). Furthermore, INTERPRO analysis of the 
signature predicted four significant functional terms (p< 
0.05) and the top two categories were identified as “Ras 
small GTPase” (FE: 30, p= 0.004) and “Winged helix 
repressor DNA-binding” (FE: 5.4, p= 0.013), (Table 2). 
Therefore, the combined analysis of two large expression 
microarray datasets reveals an AR- gene signature that is 
significantly enriched for genes involved in DNA binding 
and transcriptional activities. Importantly, C1orf64 is 
identified as the gene with the closest correlation with AR 
expression in the AR-gene signature.
AR regulates the transcription of its  
co-expressed genes
In view of a strong correlation between the 
expression of AR and each of the signature genes, it is 
likely that some of these genes are regulated by AR

activation in breast cancer cells. In this respect, a previous 
study by my group has demonstrated that F7 (CC: 0.716) 
is a direct AR target gene [20]. Therefore, to identify novel 
AR targets, the effect of AR activation was assessed on two 
genes that showed the highest positive correlation with AR 
expression in the signature namely, C1orf64 and SIDT1 
(Table 1). In addition, the effect of AR activation was also 
assessed on the top three genes that significantly correlated 
with AR expression in both datasets namely, RHOH, 
TFAP2B, and SPDEF (Table 1). The transcriptional studies 
were carried out using breast cancer cell lines T-47D 
(ER+/AR+, luminal A subtype) and MFM-223 (ER-/AR+, 
molecular apocrine subtype), [14, 20]. AR activation was 
carried out using dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment 
at 10 nM concentration at three time-points of 6h, 24h, 
and 48h as explained in methods. Next, the effect of DHT

on fold changes in gene expression was measured using 
quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-
PCR) relative to controls and all experiments were carried 
out in six replicates.
Notably, DHT treatment resulted in a marked 
reduction of C1orf64 expression in T-47D cells at all 
three time-points by 5 to 10-fold and also led to a 2-fold 
reduction of C1orf64 expression in MFM-223 cells at the 
24h time-point (p< 0.01, Figure 1A and 1B). Furthermore, 
DHT treatment decreased SIDT1 expression by 2.5-fold 
in T-47D cells after 6h (p< 0.01, Figure 1C); however, it 
did not significantly change the level of this gene in MFM-
223 cells (Figure 1D). In addition, there was a significant 
reduction of RHOH expression following DHT treatment 
in T-47D cells at all three time-points by 1.7 to 3.3-fold 
(p< 0.01, Figure 1E) as well as a 1.7-fold decrease in 
the expression of this gene in MFM-223 cells after 6h 
(p< 0.01, Figure 1F). Moreover, TFAP2B expression 
was significantly reduced by approximately 2.2-fold at 
24h and 48h time-points in T-47D cells and by 1.75-fold 
in MFM-223 cells at 24h (p< 0.01, Figure 2A and 2B). 
Finally, although there was a modest reduction of SPDEF 
expression following DHT treatment in T-47D cells at 24h 
time-point by 1.6-fold, the expression of this gene was 
consistently increased following DHT treatment in MFM-
223 cells at all three time-points by 1.6 to 2.3-fold (p< 
0.01, Figure 2C and 2D).
Next, to assess the effect of AR inhibition on the 
expression levels of C1orf64, SIDT1, RHOH, TFAP2B, 
and SPDEF genes, T-47D and MFM-223 cell lines 
were treated with AR antagonist flutamide at 10 μM 
concentration for 24h and fold changes in gene expression 
were then measured using qRT-PCR relative to the control 
experiments. It is notable that AR inhibition led to a 
significant increase in C1orf64 expression by 1.83-fold in 
MFM-223 cell line (p< 0.01, Figure 2E). However, there 
was no significant change in the expression of other genes 
following flutamide treatment (Figure 2E). Furthermore, 
the effect of AR silencing using an AR-siRNA duplex 
(AR-siRNA) was examined on C1orf64 expression. AR 
silencing efficiencies were assessed using qRT-PCR. 
Notably, AR silencing reduced AR expression by 91% 
and 64% in T-47D and MFM-223 cell lines, respectively 
(Figure 2F). Moreover, AR silencing led to a significant 
increase in C1orf64 expression by 3.25 and 3.92-fold in 
T-47D and MFM-223 lines, respectively (p< 0.01, Figure 
2F). All together, these findings suggest that AR activation 
regulates the transcription of a number of AR co-expressed 
genes and has a profound repressive effect on C1orf64 
expression in breast cancer cells.
C1orf64 and SPDEF are AR target genes
In view of the fact that C1orf64 was markedly 
repressed by AR activation and SPDEF was the only AR-
induced gene in the tested subset, these two genes were 
selected to further examine as possible direct targets of 
AR in breast cancer cells. In this process, first the effect

of DHT treatment at 10 nM for 24h was assessed on the 
protein levels of C1orf64 and SPDEF in T-47D and MFM-
223 cell lines. Western blot analysis was then carried out 
on the extracted lysates from the DHT-treated and control 
samples to examine the protein levels. Western blots were 
performed in three replicates and fold changes in band 
intensity were measured following DHT treatment relative 
to the control samples. Importantly, DHT treatment 
markedly reduced C1orf64 protein levels by 6.7-fold (15% 
of control) and 3.3-fold (30% of control) in T-47D and 
MFM-223 cell lines, respectively (Figure 3A). In addition, 
SPDEF protein level was slightly decreased by 1.25-fold 
in T-47D cells and increased by 1.5-fold in MFM-223 
cells following DHT treatment (Figure 3A). Furthermore, 
immunoblotting for AR demonstrated that there is no 
change in the AR protein levels following DHT treatment 
and the baseline expression of AR is higher in MFM-223 
compared to T-47D cell line (Figure 3A). Therefore, the 
effect of DHT-mediated AR activation on the protein 
levels of C1orf64 and SPDEF is consistent with its effect 
on the transcription of these genes.
To examine whether C1orf64 and SPDEF are AR 
target genes, the 2 kb promoter regions of these genes 
were assessed for predicated AR-binding sites using 
PROMO software as explained in methods. This analysis 
identified two predicated sites for AR binding in -1528 to 
-1520 and -350 to -342 bp regions of C1orf64 promoter 
(Figure 3B). In addition, there were four predicated AR 
binding sites in -1820 to -1812, -802 to -794, -778 to 
-770, and -686 to -678 bp regions of SPDEF promoter 
(Figure 3B). Furthermore, promoter regions of C1orf64 
and SPDEF were examined for open chromatin regions 
that are accessible to transcription. This analysis was 
carried out based on the data from ENCODE project for 
DNase I Hypersensitivity Sites (DHSs) and H3K27ac 
Mark using the UCSC Genome Browser as explained 
in methods. Notably, the 1.8 kb promoter regions of 
both C1orf64 and SPDEF genes contain DHSs and 
H3K27ac Mark in multiple cell types, which indicates the 
accessibility of these promoters for transcriptional activity 
(Supplementary Figure 1).
Next, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 
assays were carried out to investigate direct AR binding 
to C1orf64 and SPDEF promoters. In this process, a 
total of six primer sets were employed for each of the 
C1orf64 and SPDEF 2 kb promoter regions to generate 
amplicons using qRT-PCR (Figure 3C). Both T-47D and 
MFM-223 cell lines were applied for ChIP assays and a 
total of four replicate experiments were carried out for 
each primer set. Following qRT-PCR, fold enrichments 
for ChIP-signal were calculated as described in methods. 
ChIP assays revealed a significant enrichment by 80-
fold (± 45), p< 0.01 for AR binding to the region of 
A5 amplicon (-1648 to -1527 bp) on C1orf64 promoter 
(Figure 3C). Notably, this region overlaps with one 
of the two predicated AR-binding sites based on the 
bioinformatics analysis (Figure 3B). In addition, 
the other regions of C1orf64 did not demonstrate a 
significant enrichment for AR binding (Figure 3C). 
Furthermore, ChIP assays revealed a significant 
enrichment by 15-fold (± 2), p< 0.01 for AR binding to 
the A4 amplicon region (-1196 to -1063 bp) on SPDEF 
promoter; however, there was no significant AR binding 
to the other regions of this promoter (Figure 3D). This 
identified A4 amplicon region is within 300 bp of two 
of the predicated AR-binding sites on SPDEF promoter 
(Figure 3B). Collectively, these findings suggest that 
C1orf64 and SPDEF are direct transcriptional targets of 
AR in breast cancer.
There is a close association between the AR-
signature and AR promoter binding
The AR-gene signature was examined for possible 
AR-binding sites using publically available AR ChIP-
sequencing (ChIP-seq) data in breast cancer cells. 
In this process, a list of AR-signature genes with a 
detectable AR-binding signal in their 5 kb promoter 
regions were identified (Table 3). Next, an average AR 
ChIP-seq signal was calculated across three replicate 
experiments for each promoter binding detected in the 
signature genes. A total of 31 genes in the AR-signature, 
including C1orf64 and SPDEF, had detectable AR 
ChIP-seq signals (Table 3). In addition, F7, which was 
identified as an AR target gene in our previous study 
[20], also showed an AR binding in ChIP-seq analysis 
(Table 3). It is notable that 30 out of 57 positively co-
expressed genes in the AR-signature (53%) had ChIP-
seq detected AR binding (Table 3). In contrast, only one 
negatively co-expressed gene, PIM1, was among this 
subset. Furthermore, SITD1 and RHOH also contained 
a detectable signal in AR ChIP-seq (Table 3).
Next, CC values were calculated between C1orf64 
expression and the other 30 AR-signature genes that 
were identified in the AR ChIP-seq analysis. In this 
subset, a total of 19 genes demonstrated a significant 
CC value with C1orf64, including SPDEF that had a 
CC of 0.734 (p<0.001, Table 3). Furthermore, the co-
expression pattern between the genes in this subset 
and C1orf64 was uniformly in the same direction as 
that observed with AR co-expression (Table 3). These 
findings further confirm that C1orf64 and SPDEF are 
AR target genes in breast cancer and also suggest that 
a positive coexpression with AR can be applied as 
a predictor of AR target genes in combination with a 
detectable binding in AR ChIP-seq. Moreover, the close 
correlation between C1orf64 expression and 63% (19 
out of 30) of the AR-signature genes, which contain a 
ChIP-seq signal, indicates that C1orf64 is co-expressed 
with a large number of AR target genes.

C1orf64 and AR in breast cancer, C1orf64 co-expressed 
genes were assessed in primary and metastatic breast 
tumors. In this respect, two large studies that contained 
both primary and metastatic breast tumor samples were

paired metastatic samples [24]. Co-expression analysis 
in this dataset was carried out to identify genes with the 
highest correlations with C1orf64 expression (Figure 4A). 
Importantly, AR showed one of the top two correlations 
with C1orf64 expression in this cohort with a CC value 
of 0.667 (p≤ 0.0001, Figure 4A). The second dataset 
was obtained from a study conducted by Bos et al. and 
contained a total of 204 breast carcinoma samples with 
brain metastasis [25]. Notably, co-expression analysis of 
this cohort for C1orf64 also revealed that AR has one of 
the highest correlations with C1orf64 expression across 
the dataset with a CC value of 0.573 (p≤ 0.0001, Figure 
4B). Furthermore, SPDEF showed a strong correlation 
with C1orf64 expression in this dataset with a CC of 
0.573 (p≤ 0.0001, Figure 4B). These findings further prove 
that C1orf64 and AR are closely co-expressed across 
various subtypes and clinical stages of breast cancer with 
reproducible findings using different cohorts.
C1orf64 is associated with a lower grade and 
lobular breast tumors
The association of C1orf64 expression with 
clinical and pathological features of breast tumors was 
investigated using datasets available in ONCOMINE as 
described in methods. In this respect, C1orf64 log2 median 
expression values were analyzed to assess a differential 
expression of C1orf64 for histology type, tumor grade, 
ER status, ErbB2 status, triple negative (TN) status, 
and outcome across twenty-two breast cancer datasets. 
Notably, there was a significantly higher expression of 
C1orf64 in grade 1 and 2 tumors compared to grade 3 
cases by 1.5 and 1.3-fold, respectively (p< 0.02, Table 
4). In addition, C1orf64 expression was 2.6-fold higher 
in lobular histology compared to ductal (p= 0.02, Table 
4), and it was also relatively higher in ER-positive and 
non-TN tumors by 2.6 and 1.8-fold, respectively (p< 0.01, 
Table 4). However, there was no significant association 
between C1orf64 expression and ErbB2 status or outcome 
in breast tumors (Table 4). These results suggest that 
C1orf64 is differentially expressed in some of the clinical 
and pathological subtypes of breast cancer.
C1orf64 represses the AR-mediated 
induction of PIP
The fact that AR is widely co-expressed with 
C1orf64 in breast cancer and negatively regulates the 
expression of this gene, raises the question of a possible 
biological significance for such a marked repression of 
C1orf64 by AR in breast cancer cells. In this respect, a 
plausible hypothesis is that C1orf64, in turn, may have 
a negative regulatory effect on AR function in breast 
cancer, which would provide a biological advantage for 
AR to repress C1orf64 expression in order to sustain its 
own transcriptional activity. To investigate this hypothesis, 
the effect of C1orf64 expression on the AR-mediated 
transcriptional activation of PIP was examined in breast 
cancer cell lines T-47D and MFM-223. It is notable that 
PIP is an established transcriptional target of AR and AR 
activation is necessary and sufficient for PIP expression in 
breast cancer cells [8, 11, 14, 15, 26, 27]. Therefore, the 
study of C1orf64 effect on PIP expression provides a valid 
model to examine a possible regulatory effect for C1orf64 
on AR transcriptional activity in breast cancer.
To investigate the effect of C1orf64 on PIP 
transcription, silencing of C1orf64 was carried out using 
two siRNA duplexes (siRNA-D1 and siRNA-D2) and 
transfections with a non-targeting siRNA were used as 
a control (CTL). The efficiency of C1orf64-knockdown 
was then assessed by calculating the fold changes in 
C1orf64 expression using qRT-PCR seventy-two hours 
after siRNA transfections. Notably, C1orf64 expression 
was down-regulated by over 95% using siRNA-D1 
and siRNA-D2 in both T-47D and MFM-223 cell lines 
(Figure 5A). Next, the effect of C1orf64 expression on

the baseline levels of PIP transcription was examined 
following C1orf64-siRNA transfections in T-47D and 
MFM-223 grown in the full media. Importantly, there was 
a 6 to 7-fold increase in PIP expression following C1orf64 
silencing in T-47D cells with both siRNA duplexes (p< 
0.01, Figure 5B). In addition, C1orf64 silencing increased 
PIP expression by approximately 3 to 5-fold in MFM-223 
cell line (p< 0.01, Figure 5B). Moreover, the effect of 
C1orf64 silencing with siRNA-D1 was examined on PIP 
protein level in T-47D cell line, which has a measurable 
level of PIP protein using western blotting on cell lysates 
[14]. Consistent with the mRNA data, C1orf64 silencing 
resulted in a marked increase in PIP protein level by 
over 10-fold (Supplementary Figure 2A). These findings 
indicate that C1orf64 has a profound repressive effect on 
PIP expression.
Furthermore, the effect of C1orf64 on DHT-
mediated induction of PIP expression was investigated 
in T-47D and MFM-223 cell lines. C1orf64-silenced cell 
lines were grown in phenol red-free media supplemented 
with 10% Charcoal/Dextran treated serum for 48h and then 
DHT treatment was carried out at 10 nM concentration 
for 24h. Fold changes in PIP expression were measured 
using qRT-PCR relative to the control experiments. 
In T-47D cells, there was an 11.8-fold increase in PIP 
expression following DHT treatment compared to control 
(p <0.01, Figure 5C). In addition, C1orf64 silencing 
further enhanced the DHT-mediated induction of PIP 
expression compared to control by 16.4-fold and 43-fold 
for siRNA-D1 and siRNA-D2, respectively (p< 0.03 for 
DHT + control (CTL)-siRNA vs. DHT + siRNA-D1 or 
siRNA-D2, Figure 5C). Moreover, in MFM-223 cells, 
DHT treatment induced PIP expression by 2-fold (p< 0.01, 
Figure 5D), and C1orf64 silencing further increased PIP 
expression by 4.5-fold compared to control (p< 0.03 for 
DHT + CTL-siRNA vs. DHT + siRNA-D1 or siRNA-D2, 
Figure 5D). Therefore, C1orf64 expression represses the 
DHT-mediated induction of PIP.
Next, the level of PIP expression was examined 
following C1orf64 silencing in combination with 
enzalutamide treatment. Enzalutamide is an AR inhibitor 
that is used in both research and clinical practice [18]. 
Forty-eight hours after the transfections of T-47D and 
MFM-223 cells with siRNA-D1, enzalutamide treatment 
was carried out at 10 μM concentration for 24h followed 
by RNA extraction and measurement of PIP and C1orf64 
expression using qRT-PCR. Cells transfected with CTL-
siRNA and treated with enzalutamide or solvent only 
were used as control experiments. Next, fold changes in 
gene expression were assessed relative to CTL-siRNA/
solvent-treated group. Consistent with the previous 
experiments, there was over 95% reduction in C1orf64 
expression following siRNA silencing in both cell lines 
(Supplementary Figure 2B). In addition, enzalutamide 
treatment significantly reduced PIP expression in T-47D 
and MFM-223 cells by 50% and 13%, respectively 
(p<0.01, Supplementary Figure 2B). Importantly, C1orf64 
silencing reversed the effect of enzalutamide on PIP 
transcription in siRNA-D1/enzalutamide group and led 
to an increase in PIP expression by 9.95 and 1.34-fold in 
T-47D and MFM-223 cell lines, respectively (p< 0.01, 
Supplementary Figure 2B). These findings suggest that 
C1orf64 expression is required for the enzalutamide-
mediated down-regulation of PIP expression.
Finally, the effect of C1orf64 overexpression on 
PIP transcription was examined using the transfection 
of a C1orf64 expression construct in T-47D and MFM-
223 cell lines. Transfection with an empty plasmid 
was applied for the control experiments. Cell lines 
were grown in the presence of DHT and the effect of 
C1orf64 overexpression was assessed 48h following 
transfections. The overexpression efficiencies were 
evaluated using western blot analysis to measure 
C1orf64 protein levels in C1orf64-overexpressed and 
control cell lines. Notably, there was a marked increase 
in C1orf64 protein levels by approximately 100-fold 
in the overexpressed cells compared to the control 
experiments (Figure 5E). Next, the effect of C1orf64 
overexpression was assessed on PIP expression using 
qRT-PCR. Importantly, PIP expression was moderately 
decreased by 1.43 to 1.67-fold following C1orf64 
overexpression in MFM-223 and T-47D cells (p ≤ 
0.01, Figure 5F). Therefore, the presented data for 
overexpression and silencing experiments suggest 
that C1orf64 has a repressive effect on PIP expression 
and the DHT-mediated induction of PIP in breast cancer 
cells.
C1orf64 silencing intensifies the AR-mediated 
repression of PGR
To further evaluate the function of C1orf64 on 
AR transcriptional activity, the effect of this gene 
was examined in the process of AR-mediated gene 
repression. It is known that AR inhibits endogenous ERα 
transactivation in ER-positive breast cancer [28]. In view 
of this, the effect of AR activation was assessed on the 
expression of an established ER target gene, progesterone 
receptor (PGR), [29, 30]. T-47D cell line was utilized for 
these experiments due to its ER-positive status. Treatments 
were carried out in the following groups: E2 at 10 nM, 
DHT at 10 nM, and E2 (10 nM) + DHT (10 nM). Control 
experiments were performed by adding the respective 
solvent of each compound and PGR expression levels 
were measured 24h after treatments using qRT-PCR. As 
expected, E2 treatment led to a significant increase in PGR 
expression by 3.2-fold (p< 0.01, Figure 6A). Notably, 
DHT significantly reduced PGR expression by 2-fold (p< 
0.01. Figure 6A). Moreover, when combined with E2, 
DHT fully reversed the stimulatory effect of E2 on PGR 
expression and further down-regulated its expression by 
2-fold to a level similar to that observed with the DHT

treatment alone (p< 0.01, Figure 6A). Therefore, AR 
activation represses PGR expression and inhibits the 
stimulatory effect of E2 on this gene.
Furthermore, the effect of C1orf64 silencing on the 
baseline expression of PGR was evaluated. To achieve 
this, C1orf64 was silenced in T-47D cells with siRNA-D1 
and siRNA-D2 and PGR expression was assessed using 
qRT-PCR. There was a significant reduction in PGR 
expression following C1orf64 silencing by 2.8-fold and 
9.1-fold for siRNA-D1 and siRNA-D2, respectively, 
indicating that C1orf64 is necessary for PGR expression 
(p< 0.01, Figure 6B). Next, the combined effects of DHT 
treatment and C1orf64 silencing on PGR expression were 
examined. In this process, T-47D cells were evaluated in 
the following experimental groups: CTL-siRNA, CTL-
siRNA + DHT, siRNA-D1 + DHT, and siRNA-D2 + 
DHT. As previously noted, DHT treatment reduced PGR 
expression by approximately 2-fold (p< 0.01, Figure 6C). 
Importantly, C1orf64 silencing significantly intensified 
the DHT-mediated repression of PGR by 3.85-fold and 
12.5-fold for siRNA-D1 and siRNA-D2, respectively (p< 
0.03 for DHT + CTL-siRNA vs. DHT + siRNA-D1 or 
siRNA-D2, Figure 6C).
To assess whether C1orf64 overexpression can 
reverse the repressive effect of DHT on E2-mediated 
induction of PGR expression, T-47D cells were transfected 
with a C1orf64 expression construct or an empty plasmid. 
In addition, transfected cells were either treated with the 
combination of E2 (10 nM) + DHT (10 nM) or with the 
solvents only. Consistent with the previous experiments, 
E2/DHT treatment reduced PGR expression by 2.2-fold in 
the control vector-transfected group and a similar level of 
decrease in PGR expression was also observed following 
E2/DHT treatment in C1orf64-overexpressed cells (p< 
0.01, Figure 6D). Moreover, C1orf64 overexpression 
did not significantly change the baseline level of PGR 
expression (Figure 6D). These findings indicate that 
although C1orf64 silencing intensifies the DHT-mediated 
repression of PGR, C1orf64 overexpression cannot 
overcome the reduction in PGR transcription resulted from 
AR activation.
C1orf64 overexpression inhibits AR 
reporter activity
Moreover, the effect of C1orf64 expression was 
investigated on AR reporter activity using luciferase 
assays in T-47D and MFM-223 cell lines. In this process, 
co-transfections were carried out in the following four 
experimental groups as explained in methods: 1) Negative 
control for reporter + empty plasmid (Neg-Rep/Vec), 
2) Negative control for reporter + C1orf64 expression 
construct (Neg-Rep/C1orf64), 3) AR reporter + empty 
plasmid (Pos-Rep/Vec), and 4) AR reporter + C1orf64 
expression construct (Pos-Rep/C1orf64). Twenty-four 
hours after co-transfections, all groups underwent a change 
of media that included DHT at 10 nM concentration 
followed by the measurement of reporter activities at the 
48h time-point. Finally, RRR was calculated for each 
experimental group as described in methods. As expected, 
there was a marked induction of AR reporter activity in 
Pos-Rep/Vec groups by 80 (± 2.8) and 7 (±1.8)-fold in 
T-47D and MFM-223 cell lines, respectively (p< 0.01, 
Figure 6E and 6F). Importantly, C1orf64 overexpression 
completely inhibited the AR reporter activities in both cell 
lines as demonstrated by a full reversal of RRR inductions 
observed in Pos-Rep/Vec groups compared to that of Pos-
Rep/C1orf64 experiments (p< 0.01, Figure 6E and 6F). In 
addition, there was a 5-fold decrease in RRR of Pos-Rep/
C1orf64 group compared to that of Neg-Rep/C1orf64 in 
T-47D cells, which collectively amounts to a total of 400-
fold reduction in AR reporter activity following C1orf64 
overexpression in this cell line (p< 0.01, Figure 6E). 
Taken together, these findings indicate that C1orf64 has 
a profound repressive effect on the AR reporter activity.
C1orf64 silencing increases AR binding to the 
PIP promoter
The observation that C1orf64 represses the AR-
mediated induction of PIP, raises the question of a 
possible regulatory function for C1orf64 in AR binding to 
the PIP promoter. This possibility was investigated using 
the transfection of T-47D cells with siRNA-D1 or CTL-
siRNA followed by ChIP assays for PIP promoter. Forty-
eight hours after siRNA transfections, T-47D cells were 
treated with 10 nM of DHT for 24h and ChIP assays were 
performed using AR antibody and four primer sets in the 2 
kb region of PIP promoter. A total of three replicates were 
carried out for each experiment and fold enrichments for 
ChIP-signal were calculated using qRT-PCR as explained 
in methods. Importantly, C1orf64 silencing significantly 
increased the enrichment for AR binding to PIP promoter 
in the regions of A1 (-242 to -95 bp) and A3 (-1533 to 
-1442) by approximately 2-fold (p< 0.03, Figure 7A). 
However, the A2 and A4 regions of PIP promoter did 
not demonstrate a significant change in AR binding after 
C1orf64 silencing (Figure 7A). These data suggest that 
C1orf64 expression has a repressive function on AR 
binding to the PIP promoter.
C1orf64 interacts with AR in breast cancer cells
The repressive function of C1orf64 on AR 
transcriptional activity suggests that C1orf64 acts a 
negative regulator of AR function in breast cancer cells. 
Therefore, to examine whether C1orf64 is a coregulator 
of AR, the protein-protein interaction between endogenous 
C1orf64 and AR was studied in T-47D and MFM-223 cell 
lines using co-IP assays. Following immunoprecipitation 
(IP) assays with an AR antibody, supernatants were 
collected and applied for immunoblot analysis to examine 
 Oncotarget

the pull-down of C1orf64 and AR proteins. Control 
assays were conducted with a non-specific rabbit IgG 
and all experiments were performed in three replicates. 
In addition, 5% of lysates were collected before each IP 
to assess input using AR immunoblotting (Figure 7B). 
Importantly, immunoblot analysis for C1orf64 antibody 
detected a distinct band for C1orf64 protein in the AR-IP 
samples that was present in both T-47D and MFM-223 
cell lines (Figure 7B). It is notable that a C1orf64 band 
was not present in the control-IP experiments (Figure 
7B). Furthermore, immunoblotting with an AR antibody 
confirmed a successful pull-down of AR following IP 
assays in both cell lines and as expected showed a higher 
level of AR in MFM-223 cells compared to T-47D line 
(Figure 7B). These findings indicate that C1orf64 interacts 
with AR in breast cancer cells.
C1orf64 interacts with 14-3-3 protein
To further explore the molecular mechanisms 
of C1orf64 function, the sequence of this protein was 
examined using Scansite software as explained in methods 
to identify motifs that are likely to be phosphorylated by 
specific protein kinases or bind to domains such as SH2

enrichments of ChIP for PIP promoter performed with an AR antibody (AR-Ab) following the transfections of control (CT)-siRNA or 
C1orf64-siRNA (Duplex 1) in T-47D cells. AR binding to each promoter region (A1-A4) was assessed. Amplification of 1% of input 
chromatin was used as the input control and a non-specific antibody served as negative control (dashed-line). *, p< 0.03 is for C1orf64-

was assessed with AR immunoblotting on 5% of lysates collected before each IP. All co-IP experiments were performed in three replicates.

domains, 14-3-3 domains or PDZ domains. This search, 
which was carried out with a high stringency to detect 
the best 0.2% of all sites, identified two motifs within 
C1orf64 sequence. The first motif was 14-3-3 Mode 1, 
which is a phosphoserine/threonine binding group (pST_
bind), and was predicted to interact with C1orf64 at T149 
site with a motif score of 0.3301 in the top 0.154% of 
all sites (Figure 8A and 8B). The predicated gene for 
this motif is YWHAZ (14-3-3 Zeta) that can interact 
with AAPVRSSTWGTVKDS sequence within C1orf64 
protein and the underlined region depicts a consensus 
sequence for 14-3-3 binding. The other predicated motif 
was Casein Kinase 1, an acidophilic serine/threonine 
kinase, which can interact with C1orf64 at T152 site with 
a score of 0.3777 in the top 0.192% of all sites (Figure 8A 
and 8B). Together, these findings suggest that C1orf64 is 
a phosphothreonine protein, which is phosphorylated by 
Casein Kinase 1 and interacts with 14-3-3 in an adjacent 
motif.
It is notable that 14-3-3 is known to interact with 
various steroid receptors and has a regulatory function 
on these proteins [31–33]. Therefore, the predicated 
interaction between C1orf64 and 14-3-3 was further 
investigated using co-IP of endogenous proteins in T-47D 
and MFM-223 cell lines. In this process, following IP 
assays for 14-3-3, supernatants were collected and applied 
for immunoblotting to examine the pull-down of 14-3-3, 
C1orf64, and AR proteins. Control assays were conducted 
with a non-specific rabbit IgG. In addition, 5% of lysates 
were collected before each IP to assess input using 14-3-
3 immunoblotting (Figure 8C). Notably, immunoblotting 
with the 14-3-3 antibody confirmed a successful IP of 
14-3-3 protein (Figure 8C). Furthermore, immunoblot 
analysis using C1orf64 antibody detected a distinct band 
for C1orf64 in the 14-3-3 IP assays that was present in 
both cell lines (Figure 8C). In addition, C1orf64 band 
was absent in the control-IP experiments (Figure 8C). 
However, there was no detectable interaction between 14-
3-3 and AR in these cell lines (Figure 8C). These findings 
indicate that C1orf64 interacts with 14-3-3 in breast cancer 
cells.
DISCUSSION
AR is widely expressed in both ER-positive and 
ER-negative breast tumors [1–3]; however, the molecular 
functions of AR in breast cancer are not well understood. 
Therefore, this study investigated the network of genes 
that are co-expressed with AR in order to discover novel 
AR targets with biological significance in breast cancer. In 
this process, bioinformatics analysis of two large datasets 
from a broad range of breast cancer cell lines resulted 
in the identification of a combined AR-gene signature 
constituted of 98 genes that highly correlated with AR 
expression (Table 1). In addition, approximately 75% of 
the signature genes, which had an overlap between the two 
datasets, significantly correlated with AR expression in 
both cohorts. This indicates a high level of reproducibility 
in signature genes despite the differences between the two 
platforms. For instance, F7 that was previously identified 
as an AR target gene [20], highly correlated with AR 
expression in both datasets. Furthermore, functional 
annotation of the AR-gene signature revealed that it is 
highly enriched for genes related to DNA binding and 
transcription factor binding, suggesting that this signature 
is closely associated with the established molecular 
functions of AR transcriptional network. Therefore, the 
study of AR-signature genes would provide a valuable 
approach to better understand the molecular functions of 
AR in breast cancer.
Notably, C1orf64 showed the closest correlation 
with AR expression across the datasets with a CC of 
0.737 and it also highly correlated with AR expression 
in both primary and metastatic breast tumors with CC 
values of 0.667 and 0.573, respectively (Table 1 and 
Figure 4). There is very limited information about the 
molecular and biochemical functions of C1orf64 with 
only a few published studies available on this gene 
using an alias identifier, ERRF [34–36]. These studies 
showed that C1orf64 is expressed in breast tumors with 
a higher expression level in ER-positive cancers [34], a 
finding that was also confirmed in the current study (Table 
4). In addition, there is some evidence to suggest that 
C1orf64 is involved in the transcriptional activities of 
ER and there is an interaction between ER and C1orf64 
using the transient transfection of cells with tagged 
C1orf64 and ER constructs [35]. Furthermore, a recent 
study has demonstrated that ER activation results in the 
suppression of C1orf64 expression in ER-positive cells; 
however, authors did not observe any evidence for a 
direct ER binding to the promoter of C1orf64 [36]. These 
findings suggest that estrogen-mediated down-regulation 
of C1orf64 may not be a direct effect. Therefore, the 
published data indicate that C1orf64 plays a role in the 
ER transcriptional activities; however, they do not provide 
information about the broader activities of this protein 
such as in ER-negative tumors and the biochemical 
mechanisms of C1orf64 function.
The data presented here show a strong association 
between AR and C1orf64 expression in breast cancer that 
is not limited to ER-positive tumors. In fact, C1orf64 is 
expressed at a slightly higher level in ER-/AR+ MFM-
223 cells compared to ER+/AR+ T-47D line (Figure 3A). 
However, it is also notable that 70% of breast cancers are 
ER-positive and AR is expressed in 90% of this subgroup 
compared to 50% of ER-negative tumors [1–3]. Therefore, 
this differential pattern of AR expression can explain 
a relatively higher expression of C1orf64 observed in 
ER-positive compared to ER-negative tumors and at the 
same time a strong correlation between AR and C1orf64 
expression across all breast cancer subtypes. Furthermore, 
C1orf64 has a relatively higher expression in lower grade

tumors, lobular histology, and non-TN biomarker groups. 
These findings agree with each other since it is known that 
lobular tumors tend to be of a lower grade and ER-positive 
status, although their outcome are generally similar to that 
of ductal tumors [37].
Importantly, there is a functional interplay between 
AR and C1orf64 in breast cancer cells (Figure 9). In 
this process, AR activation directly represses C1orf64 
transcription and C1orf64, in turn, interacts with AR as 
a corepressor and negatively regulates the AR-mediated 
induction of PIP expression (Figure 9). This negative 
regulation is further supported by the fact that C1orf64 has 
a profound repressive effect on the AR reporter activity 
in breast cancer cells (Figure 6E and 6F). In addition, 
the corepressor effect of C1orf64 results in a reduction 
of AR binding to PIP promoter. Furthermore, the other 
aspect of this interplay involves a cross-talk between the 
AR and ER signaling in ER-positive cells. In this respect, 
AR activation has a repressive effect on the ER-mediated 
induction of PGR. In view of the fact that C1orf64 is 
necessary for PGR expression, the repression of C1orf64 
by AR has an inhibitory effect on the positive regulatory 
effect of C1orf64 on ER activity (Figure 9). It is notable 
that C1orf64 is required for the enzalutamide-mediated 
down-regulation of PIP expression. This finding is 
consistent with the recent observations that AR corepressor 
N-CoR1 levels decline with the progression of prostate 
cancer and this process is involved in the development of 
resistance to bicalutamide treatment [38]. Therefore, in a 
similar way, C1orf64 may have a function in mediating the 
activities of AR inhibitors in breast cancer.
This 
study 
suggests 
that 
C1orf64 
is 
a 
phosphothreonine protein that interacts with 14-3-3 
and is phosphorylated by Casein Kinase 1 at a T152 
site adjacent to the 14-3-3 interacting motif (Figure 8). 
Notably, 14-3-3 is a chaperone and scaffolding protein 
that binds serine/threonine-phosphorylated residues 
and regulates key proteins involved in various cellular 
processes such as intracellular signaling and gene 
transcription [33, 39–42]. In view of the fact that 14-3-3 
only interacts with phosphorylated proteins, the presence 
of a Casein Kinase I binding site in an adjacent region 
to that of 14-3-3 motif, would facilitate the interaction 
between C1orf64 and 14-3-3 proteins. In addition, these 
findings suggest that the C-terminal region of C1orf64 is 
involved in key protein interactions. Interestingly, it has 
been shown that 14-3-3 interacts with different steroid 
receptors and mediates both positive and negative 
regulatory effects on these receptors [31–33]. In this 
respect, it has been suggested that 14-3-3 interaction 
with AR promotes the transcriptional activation of PSA 
promoter in prostate cancer cells [40]. Conversely, 14-3-
3 interaction with ERα in breast cancer cells negatively 
affects ER/DNA interaction, ER transactivation activity, 
and ER-dependent cell growth [41]. Moreover, 14-3-3 
interaction with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) enhances 
GR transactivation by binding and removing its 
corepressor RIP140 [42].
However, this study did not show a direct interaction 
between endogenous 14-3-3 and AR in breast cancer 
cells. By and large, most studies for 14-3-3 interaction 
with steroid receptors were conducted either using non-
cell based assays such as yeast two-hybrid screens or 
by the application of tagged overexpression constructs, 
with the exception of ER/14-3-3 interaction that was 
examined on endogenous proteins in MCF-7 cell line 
[31–33]. Therefore, there is limited information about the 
interaction of endogenous 14-3-3 with steroid receptors 
in various tissues. In addition, the interactions between 
endogenous proteins can be transient and tissue specific. 
In view of these points, a plausible mechanism for 
C1orf64 coregulatory effects on AR and ER can involve 
a competition with 14-3-3 binding to these receptors or 
acting as a scaffolding protein in a complex that includes 
14-3-3 and a steroid receptor tethering them together 
(Figure 9).
It is notable that PIP is a key molecular target of 
AR that is widely expressed in luminal A, luminal B, 
and molecular apocrine subtypes of breast cancer and is 
necessary for cell cycle progression in breast cancer cells 
[14]. Therefore, the repressive effect of C1orf64 on PIP 
expression would have an impact on the AR-PIP signaling 
pathway. However, the overall cellular activities of 
C1orf64 are also influenced by the net regulatory functions 
of this protein on other AR and ER-regulated genes such 
as PGR. Importantly, both silencing and overexpression 
experiments demonstrated that C1orf64 has a repressive 
function on PIP expression as well as the DHT-mediated 
induction of PIP (Figure 5). This is a reflection of the 
fact that AR activation is necessary and sufficient for 
PIP expression in breast cancer cells [8]. In comparison, 
although C1orf64 silencing intensifies the DHT-mediated 
repression of PGR, the overexpression of this gene cannot 
reverse the inhibitory effect of DHT on E2-mediated 
PGR activation (Figure 6). These data indicate that AR 
regulation of C1orf64 is not the only mediator of the AR-
ER cross-talk. In fact, the mechanisms for the inhibition of 
ER activity by AR in breast cancer are not fully understood 
and one suggested mechanism is direct AR binding to a 
subset of estrogen response elements that can prevent E2-
mediated activation of ER target genes [28]. Therefore, 
AR repression of C1orf64 provides another mechanism for 
the AR inhibitory effects on ER signaling in breast cancer 
cells (Figure 9).
The presented data suggest that C1orf64 is a novel 
AR coregulaor, which represses the AR transcriptional 
effects on PIP and PGR expression, and inhibits the AR 
reporter activity. Intriguingly, since C1orf64 can regulate 
both AR and ER activities in opposite directions, it may 
be a bifunctional coregulator that acts as a corepressor or 
a coactivator depending on the interacting transcription 
factors and the regulated genes. Notably, a number 
 Oncotarget
57926
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
of bifunctional (two-faced) coregulators have been 
identified so far that include classical coregulators SRC1 
and N-CoR/SMRT as well as other coregulators such 
as RIP140, NSD1 and PELP1, which can function as 
either a coactivator or a corepressor for nuclear receptors 
[43–45]. Therefore, further studies are required to better 
understand the coregulatory functions of C1orf64 on other 
nuclear receptors and in different tissue types. The positive 
correlation of AR and C1orf64 expression in breast cancer 
can be explained by the fact that in order for AR and its 
coregulators to function together, both must be expressed 
in the same cells. The negative interplay between AR and 
C1orf64 suggests a biological basis for this coexpression 
to maintain a balanced AR activity within the cell. In fact, 
a positive correlation between the expression of steroid 
receptors and their corepressors have been previously 
reported. For example, ER-α expression positively 
correlates with the expression of N-CoR and SMRT in 
endometrial cancer and with N-CoR expression in breast 
cancer [46, 47]. Finally, in view of the fact that C1orf64 is 
regulated by both AR and ER, it would be appropriate to 
propose naming this protein, “Steroid Receptor-Regulated 
Protein” or SRRP.
Moreover, in this study SPDEF (Sam-pointed 
domain containing Ets transcription factor) was also 
identified as an AR target gene that is induced by DHT 
in MFM-223 cells. SPDEF belongs to the Ets family of 
transcription factors that is expressed in luminal, apocrine, 
and ErbB2-positive breast tumors and is associated with 
poor prognosis [48]. In addition, SPDEF can drive luminal 
differentiation of basal mammary epithelial cells, regulate 
the survival of luminal tumor cells, and contribute to 
endocrine resistance [49]. It is notable that, as opposed to 
the DHT induction of SPDEF in MFM-223 cells, there was 
a slight reduction in SPDEF expression following DHT 
treatment in T-47D cells. These findings may be related to 
the differences between ER-positive and ER-negative cells 
with respect to the effect of other transcription factors on 
AR regulation of SPDEF expression. In fact, it has been 
shown that in ER-positive cells, GATA3 and FOXA1 
both modulate the ER-mediated regulation of SPDEF 
transcription [49]. Interestingly, C1orf64 shows a strong 
correlation with SPDEF expression in breast cancer at a 
level similar to that observed with AR (Table 3 and Figure 
4). In addition, C1orf64 is closely co-expressed with over 
60% of the AR-signature genes that have a detectable 
Figure 9: A schematic model for the interplay between AR and C1orf64. This model shows a negative interplay between AR 
and C1orf64. In this process, AR activation represses C1orf64 transcription and C1orf64, in turn, acts as a corepressor of AR and negatively 
regulates the AR-mediated induction of PIP expression and AR reporter activity. Chaperone protein 14-3-3 interacts with C1orf64 and has 
a regulatory function in this model. The other aspect of this interplay involves a cross-talk between the AR and ER signaling in which, 
AR activation has a repressive effect on the ER-mediated induction of PGR. In addition, C1orf64 is necessary for PGR expression and its 
repression by AR has an inhibitory effect on the positive regulation of ER activity by C1orf64. Red arrows denote a stimulatory effect and 
black lines indicate a repressive function.

AR binding in ChIP-seq data (Table 3). These findings 
suggest that C1orf64 may broadly take part in the AR 
transcriptional activities in breast cancer and participate 
in a transcriptional network with the other AR-signature 
genes such as SPDEF.
In summary, this study investigated the network 
of genes that are co-expressed with AR in breast cancer 
and identified C1orf64 as a novel AR target gene and 
coregulator in this disease. The presented data demonstrate 
that AR activation directly represses C1orf64 transcription 
in breast cancer cells. In turn, C1orf64 interacts with 
AR as a corepressor and negatively regulates the AR-
mediated effects on PIP and PGR expression, and AR 
reporter activity. Importantly, C1orf64 also interacts 
with the chaperone protein 14-3-3, which can provide 
an underlying mechanism in mediating the molecular 
functions of C1orf64 by modulating the chaperone 
functions of this protein. All together, these data suggest 
an interplay between C1orf64 and AR with significance in 
the biology of breast cancer. Intriguingly, in view of the 
fact that C1orf64 regulates the transcriptional functions 
of both AR and ER, exploring the modulation of C1orf64 
may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for targeting 
the steroid receptor signaling in hormone-sensitive 
malignancies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bioinformatics
Gene expression analysis
Two expression microarray datasets were extracted 
from the studies published by Neve et al. and Kao et 
al. [21, 22]. Both datasets constituted of widely used 
ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cell lines. 
The first study (study 1) was conducted on a cohort of 
52 breast cancer cell lines by Neve et al. and was also 
applied in a previous publication by my group [20, 21]. 
This study included a total of 22,216 gene expression data 
points for each cell line using Affymetrix highdensity 
oligonucleotide array human HG-U133A chip [21]. The 
second dataset (study 2) was extracted from a study 
performed on a cohort of 50 breast cancer cell lines 
using Human Exonic Evidence Based oligonucleotide 
(HEEBO) arrays obtained from the Stanford Functional 
Genomics Facility that contained 36,192 oligonucleotides 
representing 18,141 mapped human genes [22]. It is 
notable that these studies had a total of 37 overlapping 
cell lines and a total of 28 cell lines were varied between 
the two cohorts [21, 22].
The extracted gene expression matrix from each 
study was analysed to identify genes that were highly co-
expressed with AR across each dataset. In this respect, 
Pearson correlation coefficients (CC) between AR 
expression and that of every gene in each dataset were 
calculated. Next, a list of highly co-expressed genes with 
AR was generated in each dataset using a cutoff of |CC| ≥ 
0.6, p< 0.001. For study 1, a list of 35 highly co-expressed 
genes with AR was obtained from the analysis performed 
in my previous publication [20]. Following the analysis of 
study 2, a second list of highly co-expressed genes with 
AR was identified and used to generate a combined “AR-
gene signature” by compiling these two gene sets across 
both cohorts (|CC|≥ 0.6, p< 0.001). In addition, genes that 
were present in both microarray platforms and were also 
significantly co-expressed in both datasets with a p< 0.05 
were identified. Data analysis to obtain CC values was 
performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 23 (Armonk, NY, 
USA).
Furthermore, molecular functions of the combined 
AR-gene signature were assessed using functional 
annotation as described before [20]. To achive this, 
gene symbols of the combined AR-signature were first 
updated to the official symbols provide by Hugo Gene 
Nomenclature Committee [50]. Next, bioinformatics 
analysis of this gene signature was performed to obtain 
Gene Ontology (GO) and protein annotations in two 
categories of GOTERM and INTERPRO using The 
Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated 
Discovery (DAVID) Bioinformatics Resources v6.8 
(National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 
Bethesda, MD, USA), [51, 52]. It is notable that 
GOTERM predicts GO annotation and INTERPRO 
provides functional analysis of proteins by classifying 
them into families [51, 52].
Co-expression analysis in breast tumors
ONCOMINE 4.5 database was used to identify 
genes that highly correlate with C1orf64 expression in 
breast tumors (www.oncomine.org), [23]. In this process, 
co-expression analysis for C1orf64 was carried out in two 
large breast tumor datasets. The first dataset included The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Invasive Breast Carcinoma 
Gene Expression Data performed by the Office of Cancer 
Genomics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of 
Health (https://gdc.cancer.gov/), [24]. This cohort contains 
a total of 593 samples with 532 invasive breast carcinoma 
and 61 paired normal breast tissue. In addition, 3 paired 
metastatic samples were analyzed. In this study, a total of 
20,423 genes were assessed for each sample. The second 
dataset was obtained from a study conducted by Bos et al. 
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center on genes that 
mediate breast cancer metastasis to the brain [25]. This 
cohort consists of 204 metastatic breast carcinoma samples 
and expression profiling was performed using Human 
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Affymetrix Arrays measuring 
19,574 genes [25]. Co-expression analysis to identify 
genes that are highly correlated with C1orf64 expression 
(p≤ 0.0001) was carried out using ONCOMINE and CC 
values and heat maps of C1orf64 co-expressed genes were 
obtained for each dataset.

Analysis of C1orf64 association with clinical and 
pathological features 
First, a differential analysis was carried out using 
ONCOMINE 4.5 for breast cancer datasets with available 
clinical and pathological features (www.oncomine.org), 
[23]. In this process, C1orf64 log2 median expression 
values were obtained for each of the pathological and 
clinical subtypes that were available across twenty-two 
breast cancer datasets. These included data for histology 
type, tumor grade, ER status, ErbB2 status, triple negative 
(TN) status, and outcome. Next, to identify differential 
expression patterns, C1orf64 log2 median values for 
each subtype of the clinical and pathological features 
were compared using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. P 
values were calculated for the following comparisons: 
ductal vs. lobular; grade 1 vs. grade 3; grade 2 vs. grade 
3; ER-negative (Neg) vs. ER-positive (Pos); ErbB2-
neg vs. ErbB2-pos; TN vs. other biomarker status; good 
outcome (good: no recurrence or death in 5 years) vs. poor 
(recurrence or death in 5 years). Finally, fold difference in 
C1orf64 expression was calculated for each significant p 
value.
Promoter analysis 
Identification of predicated AR binding sites in 
the 2 kb region of C1orf64 and SPDEF promoters was 
carried out using PROMO software, which employs 
TRANSFAC version 8.3 [53, 54]. The sequence of each 
2 kb promoter was obtained using Ensembl Genome 
Browser (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html). Binding 
sites were predicted within a dissimilarity margin of 
≤15%. Random Expectation (RE) gives the number of 
expected occurrences of the match in a random sequence 
of the same length as the query sequence according to 
the dissimilarity index. Two models are considered: 
equiprobability for the 4 nucleotides (RE equally) and 
estimating the nucleotide probability as the nucleotide 
frequencies in the query sequence (RE query).
Analysis for open chromatin regions 
Data for DNase I Hypersensitivity Sites (DHSs) are 
from ENCODE project that includes a uniform set of open 
chromatin elements in 125 cell types based on DNase-seq 
data [55, 56]. Data for H3K27ac Mark are generated at the 
Broad Institute and Bernstein lab at Massachusetts General 
Hospital/Harvard Medical School [57, 58]. Clustering of 
results and Track Data Hubs visualization were carried 
out at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC), 
[59–62]. Data analysis for DHS and H3K27ac Mark on 
C1orf64 and SPDEF promoters were performed using the 
UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) and 
(http://www.epigenomebrowser.org/).
Analysis of ChIP-seq data 
AR ChIP-seq data for AR-positive breast cancer 
cell line MDA-MB-453 was accessed using ChIP-
Atlas browser (http://chip-atlas.org/). Three replicate 
experiments for AR ChIP-seq were extracted from a study 
by Malinen et al. [63]. The data from these replicates 
were analyzed to identify the subset of AR-signature 
genes that have a detectable AR-binding site within their 
5 kb promoter regions. For the signature genes with a 
detectable AR-binding, an average of ChIP-seq signal 
was obtained across the replicates. Next, Pearson CC was 
calculated between C1orf64 expression and each gene 
in this identified subset of AR-signature. Datasets from 
breast cancer cell lines were applied to obtain CC values 
and for genes that were not present on the same platform 
as C1orf64, CC values were calculated from TCGA and 
Bos et al. datasets using ONCOMINE (www.oncomine.
org), [21–25].
Protein motif analysis
Scansite software was employed to identify motifs 
within C1orf64 protein that are likely to be phosphorylated 
by specific protein kinases or bind to domains such as 
SH2 domains, 14-3-3 domains or PDZ domains (http://
scansite.mit.edu/), [64, 65]. C1orf64 protein sequence 
was obtained from Ensembl genome browser and motif 
scan was carried out with high stringency (best 0.2% of 
all sites) using C1orf64 sequence. Next, using Scansite 
analysis, site of each motif, sequence score and percentile 
for this score (percentile of score when compared to all 
records used in this search), sequence of each motif, and 
surface accessibility of the predicated site were obtained.
Cell culture
Breast cancer cell lines T-47D (ER-positive/AR-
positive) and MFM-223 (ER-negative/AR-positive) were 
obtained from (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), [14, 
20]. Culture media were obtained from Life Technologies 
(Grand Island, NY, USA). T-47D and MFM-223 cell 
lines were cultured in DMEM/F12 and DMEM media, 
respectively supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS), (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell 
culture treatment with 5α-dihydrotestosterone (Sigma-
Aldrich) was carried out at 10 nM concentration at 6h, 
24h, and 48h time-points for gene expression studies, 
which is the standard DHT concentration used for AR 
activation in breast cancer cell lines [10, 66, 67]. The 
stated time-points for DHT treatment have been previously 
applied for the study of AR-response genes [8, 10, 20, 
68]. Treatment of T-47D cells with estradiol (E2, Sigma-
Aldrich) was performed at 10 nM concentration for 24h. 
DHT and E2 treatments were performed in phenol red-
free media (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% 
Charcoal/Dextran treated serum (Fisher Scientific) and cell 
lines were cultured in the media 48h prior to DHT and E2 
treatments [8, 20]. AR inhibition with flutamide (Sigma-
Aldrich) was carried out at 10 μM concentration for 24h 
in medium containing 10% FBS as described before [9]. 
AR inhibition with enzalutamide was performed at 10 μM 
concentration for 24h in full media as suggested by the 
 Oncotarget
57929
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
supplier (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA). Control 
experiments were carried out using an equal volume of 
solvent for each compound.
Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction
The gene expression levels were assessed using qRT-
PCR with the following Taqman Gene Expression Assays 
(Life Technologies) as instructed by the manufacturer: 
C1orf64 (assay ID: Hs00698851_m1), SIDT1 (assay ID: 
Hs00214475_m1), RHOH (assay ID: Hs01877256_s1), 
TFAP2B (assay ID: Hs01560931_m1), SPDEF (assay ID: 
Hs01026050_m1), PIP (assay ID: Hs01114172_m1), and 
PGR (assay ID: Hs01556702_m1). Housekeeping gene 
RPLP0 (Life Technologies) was applied as control. Fold 
change in gene expression = gene expression in treated 
group/ average gene expression in control group [8, 14, 
20]. Down-regulation of genes are presented in the text as 
a fold reduction relative to controls.
Western blot analysis
Rabbit polyclonal C1orf64 antibody (Novus 
Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) and rabbit polyclonal 
SPDEF antibody (Life Technologies) were applied at 
1:250 dilutions. Rabbit polyclonal AR antibody (Active 
Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and rabbit polyclonal 14-3-
3 (pan) antibody (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) were 
used at 1:1000 and 1:5000 dilutions, respectively. Rabbit 
monoclonal PIP antibody (Novus Biologicals) was applied 
at 1:1000 dilution. Mouse monoclonal α-tubulin antibody 
(Sigma-Aldrich) was applied at 1:2000 dilution to assess 
loading. Protein concentrations were measured using 
the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA) and a total of 20 μg of each cell 
lysate was used for immunoblotting. Immunoblot 
imaging and analysis of band densities were performed 
by a C-DiGit Blot Scanner (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). 
Western blots were performed in three replicates and the 
average fold changes were shown.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
ChIP assays were carried out in T-47D and MFM-
223 cell lines using QuickChIP kit (Novus Biologicals) as 
instructed by the manufacturer [20]. Cell lines were treated 
with 10 nM of DHT for 24h before ChIP assays in phenol 
red-free media supplemented with 10% Charcoal/Dextran 
treated serum. DNA shearing was carried out by sonication 
at 50% output with fifteen pulses of 10 seconds each and 
a 1 minute rest on ice between each pulse using a Model 
120 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific). A total of 5 
μg of ChIP-grade rabbit polyclonal AR antibody (Active 
Motif) was utilized for each ChIP assay. To quantify ChIP 
results, primer sets for each promoter were applied for 
qRT-PCR amplification by SYBR green method (Applied 
Biosystems) as published before [20, 69]. The sequence of 
the 2 kb promoter region for each gene was obtained using 
Ensembl genome browser and primer sets were designed 
using Primer3web version 4.0.0 (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/
primer3/), [70]. In this process, six primer sets with the 
most optimal characteristics were selected to cover each 
2 kb promoter region of C1orf64 and SPDEF for ChIP 
assays.
For C1orf64 promoter the following primer sets 
were applied: Amplicon 1 (A1), (-112 to -11 bp): forward 
(F) primer 1, atcaaagcgatcccctgact and reverse (R) 
primer 1, tgcgggaccagaccttttat; A2 (-496 to -410 bp): 
F2, ttcaccgtgttagccaggat and R2, catgcctgtaatcccagcac; 
A3 (-828 to -762 bp): F3, ggaggtggaggtttcagtga and 
R3, gtttcgctcttcttgcccag; A4 (-1019 to -890 bp): F4, 
tcacacctgtaatcccagca and R4, ccacacccggctaattttgt; A5 
(-1648 to -1527 bp): F5, : agctcacccacgtaatccag and 
R5, ccacgccttaatccccaaag; A6 (-1896 to -1840 bp): 
F6, tcccaggttcaagcgattct and R6, cgcctgtaatcccagctact. 
For SPDEF promoter the following primer sets were 
used: A1 (-167 to -82 bp): F1, ctagctgtcagggcatggat 
and R1, tgcttacctcagaccacagg; A2 (-400 to -315 bp): 
F2, atttccctagttggtgccca and R2, aagtgagcagcagtggagat; 
A3 (-955 to -847 bp): F3, ccccagaatcctcatgctct and 
R3, cacgtacctgctacctccat; A4 (-1196 to -1063 bp): F4, 
ggggattaggagtggtcgag and R4, tgttatcgtcactggcacct; 
A5 (-1704 to -1626 bp): F5, tgggttcaagcgattctcct and 
R5, aaaattagctgggcgtggtg; A6 (-1957 to -1895 bp): F6, 
gaggccgaggtacaaggatt and R6, tctctatgttgcccagggtg. For 
PIP promoter the following primer sets were employed: 
A1 (-242 to -95 bp): F1, aggtcccagccattttgaga and 
R1, ccccactcgtgatctttcct; A2 (-954 to -905 bp): F2, 
acaatgccagtgtcagcaag and R2, cctctccttgggatgatggg; 
A3 (-1533 to -1442 bp): F3, atgccttcaaagagccaagc and 
R3, actgaccaaggcaggcataa; A4 (-1960 to -1876 bp): F4, 
tcacacctgtaatcccagca and R4, catgttggccaagctgatct.
Amplification of 1% of input chromatin prior to 
immunoprecipitation was applied as the input control and 
ChIP assays using a non-specific antibody (rabbit IgG) 
served as a negative control [20]. Fold enrichments for 
ChIP-signal were calculated as described before [20, 71]. 
First the normalized ChIP Ct values were calculated: ΔCt 
(normalized ChIP) = Ct (ChIP) – [Ct (Input) – Log2 (Input Dilution Factor)]. Next, 
the % Input was calculated as: % Input = 2 (-ΔCt [normalized 
ChIP]). Lastly, fold enrichment was calculated: % Input of 
antibody/ % Input of IgG [71].
RNA interference
C1orf64-silencing 
by 
RNA 
interference 
in 
T-47D and MFM-223 cell lines was performed by 
the reverse transfection method using Lipofectamine 
RNAiMAX (Life Technologies), [14, 72]. Two 
sets 
of 
siRNA-duplexes 
(Sigma-Aldrich) 
were 
applied for C1orf64-silencing: siRNA-D1: sense (s), 
GCGCCUGUGAGGUCUUCAA[dT][dT]; 
anti-s, 
UUGAAGACCUCACAGGCGC[dT][dT]; siRNA-D2: 
 Oncotarget
57930
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
s, 
GCCUGUGAGGUCUUCAACU[dT][dT]; 
anti-s, 
AGUUGAAGACCUCACAGGC[dT][dT]. AR-silencing 
in cell lines was carried out using an AR-siRNA duplex 
(Sigma-Aldrich): s, CCAUCUUUCUGAAUGUCCU[dT]
[dT]; anti-s, AGGACAUUCAGAAAGAUGG[dT][dT]. 
Transfections of siRNA Universal Negative Control # 
1 (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as control. The effect of 
siRNA-silencing was assessed seventy-two hours after 
transfections.
C1orf64 overexpression
C1orf64 open reading frame (ORF) clone 
in a pReciever-M02 plasmid was obtained from 
GeneCopoeia (Rockville, MD, USA). Transfection of 
C1orf64 expression construct in T-47D and MFM-223 
cell lines was carried out using TurboFect Transfection 
Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as instructed by the 
manufacturer. An empty pReciever-M02 plasmid was 
applied for the control experiments. The effect of C1orf64 
overexpression was assessed 48h following transfections.
AR reporter assays
T-47D and MFM-223 cell lines were cultured in 
solid opaque (white) 96-well tissue culture plates (Fisher 
Scientific) using phenol red-free media (Life Technologies) 
supplemented with 10% Charcoal/Dextran treated serum 
(Fisher Scientific) and cell lines were approximately 80% 
confluent on the day of transfection. AR Reporter Assay 
Kit (Cignal, Cat. 336841) was obtained from Qiagen 
(Valencia, CA, USA). AR reporter includes a mixture of 
an inducible androgen-responsive reporter construct and 
a constitutively expressing Renilla construct (40:1). This 
reporter encodes the firefly luciferase reporter gene under 
the control of a basal promoter element (TATA box) joined 
to tandem repeats of an Androgen Response Element 
(ARE). Negative control is a mixture of a non-inducible 
firefly reporter construct and a constitutively expressing 
Renilla construct (40:1).
The co-transfections of reporter and expression 
constructs in each cell line were carried out using 
TurboFect Transfection 
Reagent 
(Thermo 
Fisher 
Scientific) as instructed by the manufacturer in the 
following four experimental groups: 1) Negative control 
for reporter + empty pReciever-M02 plasmid (Neg-
Rep/Vec), 2) Negative control for reporter + C1orf64 
expression construct (Neg-Rep/C1orf64), 3) AR reporter 
+ empty pReciever-M02 plasmid (Pos-Rep/Vec), and 4) 
AR reporter + C1orf64 expression construct (Pos-Rep/
C1orf64). Twenty-four hours following co-transfections, 
media were changed to phenol red-free media/10% 
Charcoal/Dextran treated serum containing DHT at 10 nM 
concentration. Forty-eight hours after the transfections, 
reporter activities were assessed using Dual-Glo 
Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) 
as instructed by the manufacturer and measurements were 
carried out in an EnVision Multilabel Reader (Perkin 
Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The relative response ratio 
(RRR) for each reporter activity was measured relative to 
the internal control reporter followed by normalization to 
the respective Neg-Rep group [8, 9]. All reporter assays 
were carried out in four biologic replicates.
Co-immunoprecipitation assay
IP assays for endogenous AR and 14-3-3 were 
carried out using a non-denaturing lysis buffer as 
we previously published [8, 14]. The IP lysis buffer 
constituted of 20 mM Tris Hcl pH 8, 137 nM NaCl, 10% 
glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), and 2mM EDTA [14]. 
For IP experiments, T-47D and MFM-223 cell lines were 
grown to 70% confluence in 10 cm dishes in full media 
and then each dish was lysed in 1 ml of IP lysis buffer 
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors 
(Sigma Aldrich). Following rotatory agitation of samples 
for 30 min at 4°C, lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 xg 
for 20 min and supernatants were collected. Next, lysates 
were each pre-cleared with 100 μl of Protein A-Sepharose 
4B beads (Life Technologies) for 30 min at 4°C followed 
by centrifugation and collection of supernatants for IP 
experiments.
Subsequently, AR-IP was performed using 10 μg of 
rabbit polyclonal AR antibody (Active Motif) and 14-3-3 
IP was carried out using 5 μg of rabbit polyclonal 14-3-
3 (pan) antibody (Millipore). Control experiments were 
conducted with a non-specific rabbit IgG. The lysate-
antibody mixtures were then incubated overnight under 
rotation at 4°C. Next, lysates were mixed with 100 μl 
of beads for 4h under rotatory agitation at 4°C and then 
centrifuged to remove supernatants. Beads were then 
washed three times with ice-cold IP lysis buffer. Following 
the removal of last supernatant, 50 μl of 2x Laemmli 
Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was added 
to each sample. Samples were then boiled at 100°C for 
5 min and centrifuged at 14,000 xg for 10 min. Finally, 
supernatants were collected and applied for immunoblot 
analysis using C1orf64, AR, or 14-3-3 antibodies. In 
addition, for each sample, 5% of lysate was collected 
before IP to assess input by immunoblot analysis. All co-
IP experiments were carried out in three replicates.
Statistical analysis
Biostatistics was carried out using IBM SPSS 
Statistics 23. Unless specified, Student t-test and paired 
sample t-test were applied to calculate the statistical 
significance. For the analysis of association between 
C1orf64 expression and clinical and pathological features, 
p values were calculated using Wilcoxon Signed Rank 
Test. All error bars depict ± 2SEM.
