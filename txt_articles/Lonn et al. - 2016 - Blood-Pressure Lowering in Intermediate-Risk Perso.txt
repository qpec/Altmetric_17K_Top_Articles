BACKGROUND
Antihypertensive therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular events among high-risk 
persons and among those with a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or higher, 
but its role in persons at intermediate risk and with lower blood pressure is unclear.
METHODS
In one comparison from a 2-by-2 factorial trial, we randomly assigned 12,705 par-
ticipants at intermediate risk who did not have cardiovascular disease to receive 
either candesartan at a dose of 16 mg per day plus hydrochlorothiazide at a dose 
of 12.5 mg per day or placebo. The first coprimary outcome was the composite of 
death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; 
the second coprimary outcome additionally included resuscitated cardiac arrest, 
heart failure, and revascularization. The median follow-up was 5.6 years.
RESULTS
The mean blood pressure of the participants at baseline was 138.1/81.9 mm Hg; 
the decrease in blood pressure was 6.0/3.0 mm Hg greater in the active-treatment 
group than in the placebo group. The first coprimary outcome occurred in 260 par-
ticipants (4.1%) in the active-treatment group and in 279 (4.4%) in the placebo 
group (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.10; P 
= 
0.40); the 
second coprimary outcome occurred in 312 participants (4.9%) and 328 partici-
pants (5.2%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.11; P 
= 
0.51). In one 
of the three prespecified hypothesis-based subgroups, participants in the subgroup 
for the upper third of systolic blood pressure (>143.5 mm Hg) who were in the 
active-treatment group had significantly lower rates of the first and second copri-
mary outcomes than those in the placebo group; effects were neutral in the middle 
and lower thirds (P 
= 
0.02 and P 
= 
0.009, respectively, for trend in the two outcomes).
CONCLUSIONS
Therapy with candesartan at a dose of 16 mg per day plus hydrochlorothiazide at 
a dose of 12.5 mg per day was not associated with a lower rate of major cardio-
vascular events than placebo among persons at intermediate risk who did not have 
cardiovascular disease. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and

H
igh blood pressure is the leading 
risk factor for cardiovascular disease 
globally1 and affects more than 1 billion 
adults worldwide.2 Observational studies involv-
ing persons without cardiovascular disease show 
a graded increase in risk at systolic blood-pres-
sure levels above 115 mm Hg.3 It has been sug-
gested that lowering blood pressure at any level 
above this value will reduce the risk of cardiovas-
cular events.4 Antihypertensive therapy has been 
clearly shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascu-
lar disease among people with vascular or renal 
disease, diabetes, or hypertension with end-organ 
damage or, in the absence of these conditions, 
among persons with a systolic blood pressure 
of 160 mm Hg or higher.5-8 However, the role of 
therapy in persons at intermediate risk (defined 
as an annual risk of major cardiovascular events 
of approximately 1%) who do not have vascular 
disease and who have a systolic blood pressure 
of less than 160 mm Hg (who represent the ma-
jority of middle-aged and older persons) remains 
less clear. We evaluated this question in the Heart 
Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE)–3 trial.
Methods
Trial Design
We conducted this double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial at 228 centers in 21 
countries, using a 2-by-2 factorial design. The 
trial evaluated blood-pressure–lowering therapy 
with a fixed-dose combination of an angiotensin-
receptor blocker (ARB) and a thiazide diuretic, 
cholesterol-lowering therapy with a statin, and 
the combination of both interventions in persons 
at intermediate cardiovascular risk (Table S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org).9 The results 
of the cholesterol-lowering analysis and the 
analysis of the combination of blood-pressure 
lowering and cholesterol lowering are reported 
in accompanying articles in the Journal.10,11
The trial was designed by an international 
steering committee of academic investigators 
and sponsored by AstraZeneca and the Canadian 
Institutes of Health Research. AstraZeneca pro-
vided the trial drug, served as a single voting 
member on the 24-member steering committee, 
and had no other role in the trial. The Popula-
tion Health Research Institute, McMaster Uni-
versity, Canada, coordinated data collection and 
monitoring and conducted all statistical analy-
ses independent of the sponsors. Ethical approval 
was obtained at all centers, and all the partici-
pants provided written informed consent. An 
event-adjudication committee whose members 
were unaware of the trial-group assignments re-
viewed primary and secondary outcome events 
and deaths. An independent data and safety 
monitoring board reviewed the accumulating 
data. The authors vouch for the accuracy and 
completeness of the data and all the analyses, as 
well as for the fidelity of this report to the trial 
protocol (available at NEJM.org). The first author 
drafted the manuscript, and all the authors 
made the decision, with approval from the steer-
ing committee, to submit the manuscript for 
publication.
Trial Population
The trial included men 55 years of age or older 
and women 65 years of age or older who had at 
least one of the following cardiovascular risk 
factors: elevated waist-to-hip ratio, history of low 
concentration of high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol, current or recent tobacco use, dysglycemia, 
family history of premature coronary disease, and 
mild renal dysfunction; details of the eligibility 
criteria are provided in Table S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix. We also included women 
60 years of age or older who had at least two 
such risk factors.9 We excluded persons with 
known cardiovascular disease, clear indications or 
contraindications to the trial drugs or angioten-
sin-converting–enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, moderate 
or advanced renal dysfunction, or symptomatic 
hypotension.
Fasting lipid, glucose, and creatinine levels 
and blood pressure were measured before enroll-
ment. However, participants were not selected 
on the basis of history of either hypertension or 
hyperlipidemia, and the trial did not mandate 
strict blood-pressure or lipid levels for entry. Per-
sons with a history of hypertension could be 
enrolled if the blood pressure was adequately 
controlled (in the assessment of the recruiting 
physician) with lifestyle or drugs other than an 
ARB, ACE inhibitor, or thiazides. Recruiting 
physicians were informed about local guidelines 
regarding the prevention of cardiovascular dis-
ease (including guidelines for the management 
of hypertension and dyslipidemia), and they used 
local standards as an additional guide to deter-
mine trial eligibility, on the basis of the uncer-
tainty principle.12

Blood-Pressure Lowering in Intermediate-Risk Persons
Trial Procedures
Eligible participants entered a single-blind run-in 
phase, during which they received both active 
treatments (for blood-pressure lowering and for 
cholesterol lowering) for 4 weeks. Serum creati-
nine, potassium, creatine kinase, and alanine 
aminotransferase (or aspartate aminotransferase) 
levels were measured at 3 weeks. Participants 
who adhered to the regimen (taking ≥80% of the 
tablets) and who did not have an unacceptable 
level of adverse events underwent randomization 
with the use of a central concealed randomiza-
tion procedure, stratified according to center. 
Participants were randomly assigned to the daily 
administration of either a fixed-dose combina-
tion of candesartan at a dose of 16 mg and hydro-
chlorothiazide at a dose of 12.5 mg or placebo; 
participants were also randomly assigned to 
receive either rosuvastatin at a dose of 10 mg or 
placebo.
All the participants received individualized 
structured lifestyle advice, according to identified 
needs. Follow-up visits occurred at 6 weeks and 
6 months after randomization and every 6 months 
thereafter. Adherence to the regimen (as mea-
sured by pill count), safety, and trial outcomes 
were evaluated at each visit. The blood pressure 
was measured at each visit during the first year 
and annually thereafter (average of two measure-
ments after 5 minutes of quiet rest) with the use 
of a standardized protocol (see the Supplemen-
tary Appendix) and an automated measurement 
system (Omron model HEM-711DLXCAN). Fast-
ing blood samples were obtained at baseline 
from all the participants and during follow-up 
from 10 to 20% of the participants (with repre-
sentation across geographic and racial and ethnic 
subgroups), and the samples were shipped for 
central storage and analyses of lipid levels and 
additional markers (see the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Trial Outcomes
The two prespecified coprimary efficacy out-
comes were the composite of death from cardio-
vascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, 
or nonfatal stroke and the composite of these 
events plus resuscitated cardiac arrest, heart fail-
ure, or revascularization. There were two second-
ary outcomes: the composite of events compris-
ing the second coprimary outcome plus angina 
with evidence of ischemia, and for the compari-
son of blood-pressure lowering, fatal or nonfatal 
stroke. The secondary outcomes were modified 
from the original trial protocol and were for-
mally adopted by the steering committee with-
out a protocol amendment on July 15, 2015, be-
fore unblinding on November 3, 2015.
Additional prespecified outcomes were total 
mortality, the components of the coprimary and 
secondary outcomes (stroke was a component of 
the coprimary outcomes and also a distinct sec-
ondary outcome for the comparison of blood-
pressure lowering), new-onset diabetes, cognitive 
function (in participants ≥70 years of age), and 
erectile dysfunction in men. The latter two out-
comes are not reported here. Event definitions 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Renal dysfunction was a tertiary outcome in 
the original trial protocol and was removed be-
cause of limitations of statistical power. The 
main safety outcomes included cancer, myopa-
thy, rhabdomyolysis, and hospitalization. In ad-
dition, we collected data on adverse events lead-
ing to temporary or permanent discontinuation 
of the trial regimens and on suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions. Safety monitoring is 
summarized in the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
With an expected annual event rate of 1% for the 
first coprimary outcome in the dual-placebo 
group (i.e., the group of participants assigned to 
placebo in both the comparison of blood-pres-
sure lowering and the comparison of cholesterol 
lowering), an average duration of follow-up of 
5.5 years, cumulative nonadherence rates of 
23%, drop-in rates of 11% (participants who 
were projected to use open-label ARBs, ACE in-
hibitors, thiazides, or statins), and rates of loss 
to follow-up of less than 1%, we estimated that 
a sample of 12,700 participants would provide 
the trial with 80% power to detect a risk with 
candesartan plus hydrochlorothiazide that was 
at least 22.5% lower than the risk with placebo, 
after the occurrence of at least 500 first and 600 
second coprimary outcomes.9
The main analyses were performed according 
to the intention-to-treat principle. Survival curves 
were computed with the use of the Kaplan–Meier 
procedure. A Cox proportional-hazards model, 
stratified according to the opposite group of the 
factorial design, was used to estimate treatment 
effects and possible interactions and to evaluate 
effects in subgroups. No significant interaction 
between the two factorial treatments was ob-

served. Prespecified hypothesis-based subgroup 
analyses were conducted according to thirds of 
baseline cardiovascular risk, of systolic blood 
pressure, and of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol concentration (with P values for trend), 
with additional confirmatory prespecified sub-
group analyses according to age, sex, diastolic 
blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, additional lipid 
measurements, and race or ethnic group. A post 
hoc recurrent-events analysis was performed with 
the use of proportional-means models to describe 
the effect on the risk of total cardiovascular 
events.13
To preserve an overall type I error rate of 5%, 
the first coprimary outcome was tested at a 
P value of 0.04 and the second at a P value of 
0.02 (considering an 80% overlap between the 
coprimary outcomes). A nominal P value of less 
than 0.05 was used for all other analyses. Fur-
ther details are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Results
Participants, Follow-up, and Medication Use
From April 2007 through November 2010, a total 
of 14,682 participants entered the run-in phase 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Of 
these, 12,705 participants (86.5%) underwent 
randomization; 6356 participants were randomly 
assigned to candesartan plus hydrochlorothia-
zide, and 6349 to placebo. The main reasons 
that participants did not undergo randomization 
were an unwillingness to continue in the trial, 
an adherence to the regimen of less than 80%, 
and side effects, the most common of which 
were abnormal laboratory values and hypotension.
The characteristics at baseline were similar in 
the two trial groups (Table 1). The population 
was racially and ethnically diverse, and the mean 
age of the participants was 65.7 years. A total of 
46.2% of the participants were women, 37.9% 
reported a history of hypertension, and 21.9%

Plus–minus values are means ±SD. There were no significant between‑group differences, except for heart rate (P = 0.03) 
and the use of aspirin (P = 0.02). Definitions for the cardiovascular risk factors are provided in Table S2 in the Supple‑
mentary Appendix. Data on blood pressure were missing for 2 participants in the placebo group, and data on central 
core laboratory measurements of low‑density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration for 649 in the active‑treat‑
ment group and for 658 in the placebo group. Data on age and sex were complete. Data on other characteristics were 
available for 99.7% or more of the trial participants, except that some laboratory variables measured at the central core 
laboratory had rates of missing data similar to that for LDL cholesterol concentration. The body‑mass index is the 
weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. To convert values for cholesterol to millimoles per li‑
ter, multiply by 0.0259. To convert values for triglycerides to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.01129. To convert values 
for glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.05551. To convert values for creatinine to micromoles per liter, multiply 
by 88.4. HDL denotes high‑density lipoprotein.
†  
The measurements were made at the central core laboratory.
‡  
The scale for the INTERHEART Risk Score14 ranges from 0 to 49; low cardiovascular risk corresponds to a score of 9 or 
less, medium risk to a score of 10 to 15, and high risk to a score of 16 or higher.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
were taking antihypertensive agents (other than 
ARBs, ACE inhibitors, or thiazides).
The median follow-up was 5.6 years (inter-
quartile range, 5.2 to 6.2). Vital status was ascer-
tained in 12,587 participants (99.1%) at the end 
of the trial (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Among participants randomly assigned to 
active therapy, 88.2% were taking the assigned 
regimen at 1 year, 83.6% at 3 years, 75.0% at 
5 years, and 76.8% at the end of the trial; the 
corresponding rates in the placebo group were 
87.9%, 83.4%, 74.5%, and 75.7%. Data on open-
label use of ARBs, ACE inhibitors, thiazides, and 
other blood-pressure-lowering drugs are provided 
in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Blood Pressure
At baseline, the mean blood pressure in the 
entire trial population was 138.1/81.9 mm Hg. 
The mean (±SD) systolic blood pressure was 
138.2±14.7 mm Hg in the active-treatment group 
and 137.9±14.8 mm Hg in the placebo group. 
The mean decreases from baseline during the 
trial were 10.0±13.1 mm Hg in the active-treat-
ment group and 4.0±12.9 mm Hg in the placebo 
group (Fig. 1), and the average difference be-
tween the groups was 6.0±13.0 mm Hg.
The mean diastolic blood pressure at baseline 
was 82.0±9.4 mm Hg in the active-treatment 
group and 81.8±9.3 mm Hg in the placebo group. 
The mean decreases from baseline during the 
trial were 5.7±8.2 mm Hg in the active-treat-
ment group and 2.7±7.9 mm Hg in the placebo 
group (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix), 
and the average difference between the groups 
was 3.0±8.0 mm Hg.
Clinical Outcomes
There were no significant differences between 
the active-treatment group and the placebo group 
in the incidence of the first coprimary outcome 
(260 [4.1%] and 279 [4.4%], respectively; hazard 
ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 
1.10; P 
= 
0.40) or the second coprimary outcome 
(312 [4.9%] and 328 [5.2%], respectively; hazard 
ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.11; P 
= 
0.51). There 
were also no significant between-group differ-
ences in the incidence of the secondary outcomes 
and the components of the coprimary outcomes, 
in total mortality, in the incidence of new-onset 
diabetes, or in the post hoc outcome of total 
cardiovascular events (Table 2 and Fig. 2, and 
Figs. S5 and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In one of three prespecified hypothesis-based 
subgroups, there were significant differences in 
the prespecified subgroup analysis according to 
thirds of baseline systolic blood pressure for the 
two coprimary outcomes and the first secondary 
outcome (P 
= 
0.02 for trend for the first copri-
mary outcome, P 
= 
0.009 for trend for the second 
coprimary outcome, and P 
= 
0.005 for trend for 
the first secondary outcome) but not for the 
second secondary outcome of stroke (P 
= 
0.22 
for trend) (Fig. 3, and Fig. S11 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Participants in the sub-
group for the upper third of systolic blood pres-
sure (>143.5 mm Hg; mean, 154.1±8.9 mm Hg) 
who were in the active-treatment group had 
nominally significantly lower rates than those in 
the placebo group with respect to the first co-
primary outcome (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 
0.56 to 0.94), the second coprimary outcome 
(hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.96), and 
the first secondary outcome (hazard ratio, 0.72; 
95% CI, 0.57 to 0.90). There were no significant 
interactions among the other prespecified sub-
groups, including those according to thirds of 
baseline risk, LDL cholesterol concentration, or 
diastolic blood pressure (Figs. S12 and S13 
in the Supplementary Appendix).

Blood-Pressure Lowering in Intermediate-Risk Persons
Safety
There were no differences between the active-
treatment group and the placebo group in the 
rates of cancer, hospitalization for cardiovascu-
lar causes, hospitalization for noncardiovascular 
causes, or death from noncardiovascular causes 
(Tables S6, S7, and S8 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Permanent discontinuation of the trial 
regimen occurred in 1552 participants (24.4%) 
in the active-therapy group and in 1598 (25.2%) in 
the placebo group (P 
= 
0.33) and was more com-
mon in the active-therapy group than in the pla-
cebo group owing to symptomatic hypotension, 
dizziness, or light-headedness (217 participants 
[3.4%] vs. 130 [2.0%], P<0.001) but not owing to 
syncope (7 [0.1%] vs. 4 [0.1%], P 
= 
0.55) or renal 
dysfunction or abnormalities in the serum potas-
sium level (32 [0.5%] vs. 20 [0.3%], P

This outcome was not specified in the trial protocol but was adopted by the steering committee before unblinding.
‡  
Revascularization included coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial revascularization.
§  
Hospitalization for cardiovascular causes was a prespecified safety outcome.
¶  
The analysis of recurrent events of the second coprimary outcome was a post hoc analysis that used a proportional‑means model. The sec‑
ond coprimary outcome is shown because it comprises all events that were included in the first coprimary outcome as well as resuscitated 
cardiac arrest, heart failure, and revascularization.

regimen were similar to those for permanent 
discontinuation (Table S10 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). There were also no significant differ-
ences in the rates of serious unexpected suspected 
adverse reactions (Table S11 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
Discussion
In the HOPE-3 trial, treatment with candesartan 
at a dose of 16 mg per day plus hydrochlorothia-
zide at a dose of 12.5 mg per day over a period of 
5.6 years lowered blood pressure by 6.0/3.0 mm Hg 
from baseline but did not result in a significantly 
lower risk, as compared with placebo, of major 
cardiovascular events in an intermediate-risk 
population without cardiovascular disease and 
with very low rates of diabetes (5.8%) and mild 
renal dysfunction (2.8%). The average blood 
pressure of the participants at baseline was 
138.1/81.9 mm Hg, approximately one third of 
the participants had a history of hypertension, 
and approximately 22% were taking antihyper-
tensive agents. As compared with placebo, active 
treatment was associated with a slightly higher 
risk of symptomatic hypotension, dizziness and 
light-headedness but not syncope, renal dysfunc-
tion, or other adverse events.
The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in 
Diabetes (ACCORD) and Systolic Blood Pressure 
Intervention (SPRINT) trials15,16 are similar to 
the HOPE-3 trial in that they also included par-
ticipants with an average systolic blood pressure 
that was considered to be in the high-normal 
Figure 3. Forest Plots, According to Subgroup of Systolic Blood Pressure for the Coprimary Outcomes.
The difference in blood pressure refers to the average difference of the systolic and diastolic blood pressures between the two groups 
during the trial, with the active‑treatment group having lower mean values. The first coprimary outcome (Panel A) was the composite of 
death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke; the second coprimary outcome (Panel B) was the 
composite of these events plus resuscitated cardiac arrest, heart failure, or revascularization. Measurements of the systolic blood pres‑
sure at baseline were missing for two participants in the placebo group. The size of each square is proportional to the number of events.

range. However, the participants’ risk was 
much higher in these two trials by design (year-
ly event rates in the control group of 2.1% in the 
ACCORD trial and 2.2% in the SPRINT trial vs. 
0.8% for the first coprimary outcome and 0.9% 
for the second coprimary outcome in the HOPE-3 
trial). These trials used complex treat-to-target 
approaches, which resulted in greater lowering 
of blood pressure than was observed in the 
HOPE-3 trial but also in higher rates of adverse 
events.
Given the data from the ACCORD and SPRINT 
trials,15,16 we cannot fully exclude the possibility 
that greater reduction in blood pressure might 
have been more effective in the HOPE-3 trial. 
However, the Blood Pressure Lowering Treat-
ment Trialists’ Collaboration reported an 18% 
lower risk of major cardiovascular events among 
persons at comparable baseline risk (5-year event 
rate in the placebo group, 6.5%) with a reduction in 
blood pressure of 4.6/3.0 mm Hg from baseline but 
with a systolic blood pressure of 155±21 mm Hg 
at baseline.8 Thus, a higher systolic blood pres-
sure at baseline may be decisive in determining 
whether small reductions in blood pressure re-
duce risk.
There were significant trends toward a lower 
risk of events at higher baseline systolic blood 
pressure for the two coprimary outcomes and for 
the first secondary outcome, with risks that were 
nominally significantly lower by 24 to 28% in the 
subgroup for the upper third of systolic blood pres-
sure (>143.5 mm Hg; mean, 154.1±8.9 mm Hg). 
By contrast, no benefit was observed in partici-
pants who had a baseline systolic blood pressure 
of 143.5 mm Hg or less and a suggestion of 
harm for those in the lower-third subgroup 
(≤131.5 mm Hg; mean, 122.2±7.5 mm Hg). The 
pattern for stroke differed, with no heterogene-
ity in the three subgroups that were defined ac-
cording to baseline systolic blood pressure. 
Blood-pressure differences between the trial 
groups were similar across the three subgroups 
of baseline systolic blood pressure. Therefore, 
the observed subgroup findings are not related 
to differences in the magnitude of blood-pres-
sure lowering but rather to a differential effect 
in participants at different baseline blood-pres-
sure levels. Although any subgroup analysis 
should be interpreted with caution, the analysis 
according to thirds of systolic blood pressure 
was hypothesis-driven and prespecified, and the 
benefits were consistent across prespecified out-
comes and appear to be plausible in the context 
of previously reported data.
Our findings contradict the “lower is better” 
hypothesis that has been derived from epidemio-
logic studies,3 and our findings support the con-
cept that a J-curve phenomenon exists for major 
cardiovascular events, other than for stroke, in 
this population. After correction for time-depen-
dent regression dilution by averaging of all blood-
pressure measurements in the placebo group over 
the first year, the mean “usual” systolic blood 
pressure thus calculated was 140.9±11.9 mm Hg in 
the upper-third subgroup and 127.1±11.1 mm Hg 
in the lower-third subgroup. Therefore, our data 
are compatible with the hypothesis that treating 
persons without cardiovascular disease who have 
a systolic blood pressure above approximately 
140 mm Hg appears to be beneficial, but treat-
ment would not be of benefit and may be even 
harmful in persons with lower systolic blood-
pressure levels.
Several meta-analyses have shown similar 
reductions in relative risk across pretreatment 
systolic blood-pressure levels ranging from less 
than 130 mm Hg to more than 180 mm Hg with 
the use of various drugs, among persons with 
diabetes and those without diabetes, and across 
various levels of risk, largely on the basis of 
trials involving patients with vascular or renal 
disease, diabetes, or entry systolic blood-pressure 
levels of more than 150 mm Hg in primary pre-
vention.5-8,17 Other meta-analyses of trials involv-
ing patients with diabetes showed no reduction 
in the risk of major cardiovascular events (except 
possibly stroke) and a potential for harm in per-
sons with a pretreatment systolic blood pressure 
of less than 140 mm Hg.18,19
There are insufficient data to guide decisions 
about blood-pressure levels for the initiation of 
antihypertensive agents in persons at low or 
moderate cardiovascular risk who have mild un-
complicated hypertension.20 In previous trials, 
most participants were already receiving anti-
hypertensive agents before randomization or 
their blood pressure was substantially higher 
than our current definitions of grade 1 hyperten-
sion21-24; previous meta-analyses are also incon-
clusive.25,26 The uncertainty surrounding this 
important question is reflected in recent U.S. 
and European guidelines.27,28

therapy with a fixed-dose combination of an 
ARB and a thiazide, at relatively low doses, in 
persons at intermediate risk who did not have 
cardiovascular disease, among whom very few 
had diabetes or renal dysfunction and only ap-
proximately one fifth were receiving antihyper-
tensive drugs before randomization. Our data 
indicate that in this population overall, there was 
no significant benefit of blood-pressure lower-
ing with the tested treatment. However, in one 
of the three subgroups of participants with un-
complicated mild hypertension, such therapy 
significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular 
events.
