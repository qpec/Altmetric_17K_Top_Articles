Abstract
Introduction
Obesity is a global concern in dogs with an increasing prevalence, and effective weight loss
solutions are required that work in different geographical regions. The main objective was to
conduct an international, multi-centre, weight loss trial to determine the efficacy of a dietary
weight loss intervention in obese pet dogs.
Methods
A 3-month prospective observational cohort study of weight loss in 926 overweight dogs
was conducted at 340 veterinary practices in 27 countries. Commercially available dry or
wet weight loss diets were used, with the initial energy allocation being 250–335 kJ/kg target
body weight0.75/day (60–80 kcal/kg target body weight0.75/day) depending on sex and neu-
ter status. The primary outcome measure was percentage weight loss; the main secondary
outcomes were changes in activity, quality of life, and food-seeking behaviour, which were
subjectively determined from owner descriptions.
Results
At baseline, median (range) age was 74 (12 to 193) months and median body condition
score was 8 (range 7–9). 896 of the 926 dogs (97%) lost weight, with mean weight loss
being 11.4 ±5.84%. Sexually intact dogs lost more weight than neutered dogs (P = 0.001),
whilst female dogs lost more weight than male dogs (P = 0.007), with the difference being
more pronounced in North and South American dogs (median [Q1, Q3]: female: 11.5%
[8.5%, 14.5%]; male: 9.1% [6.3%, 12.1%], P = 0.053) compared with those from Europe
(female: 12.3% [8.9%, 14.9%]; male: 10.9% [8.6%, 15.4%]). Finally, subjective scores for
activity (P<0.001) and quality of life (P<0.001) increased sequentially, whilst scores for food-
seeking behaviour decreased sequentially (P<0.001) during the study.

 Conclusion
This is the largest international multi-centre weight loss study conducted to date in obese
dogs. Most dogs lost a clinically significant amount of weight, although there were notable
differences between dogs of different sex, neuter status and in different geographical
locations.
Introduction
Obesity is the most common medical disease in dogs [1], and is associated with comorbidities
such as orthopaedic disease and diabetes mellitus, as well as causing metabolic derangements
[2,3], altered renal function [4], and respiratory dysfunction [5]. In addition to these adverse
effects on health, quality of life (QOL) is poorer in obese dogs and lifespans can be shortened
[6,7]. Treatment of obesity predominantly involves feeding a purpose-formulated food in
restricted quantities (e.g. dietary energy intake less than maintenance requirements) to invoke
controlled weight loss [8–11], as well as increasing physical activity which can provide addi-
tional benefits [12]. Successful weight loss can lessen the impact of the comorbidities associ-
ated with obesity, for example improving mobility in the face of osteoarthritis [13], improving
insulin sensitivity and reversing other metabolic derangements [2,3], as well as improving
QOL [6].
Many of the first weight loss studies were conducted in research colony dogs, and reported
universal success with rates of weight loss progressing at 1–2% per week [14–16]. Other stud-
ies have demonstrated successful weight loss in pet dogs with naturally-occurring obesity,
although weight loss is slower than in the colony studies (mean <1% per week) [10–12], and
many dogs fail to reach their target weight [11,17]. Whilst the latter studies were more repre-
sentative of weight loss in pet dogs than colony studies, they were limited by the fact they were
conducted at academic institutions, and were arguably less representative of weight loss regi-
mens conducted in primary care practice. Further, most studies have focused on weight loss
metrics such as rate and percentage weight loss. This limitation has been addressed in other
studies that have also gathered data on other outcomes such as mobility using force plate and
accelerometers [13,18,19], metabolic markers [2,3], and quality of life using validated health-
related QOL questionnaires [6,20]. However, overall, most canine studies tend to be small in
scope, often involving a single centre and single locality. Therefore, information is lacking on
how the success of weight loss varies amongst different settings and different geographic
locations.
The primary aim of this study was to conduct a large, international, multi-centre trial to
determine the efficacy of a short-term dietary weight loss intervention in overweight pet dogs
attending primary care veterinary practices. Secondary objectives were to determine factors
associated with success of the weight loss intervention, and to determine the impact of weight
loss on owner perceptions of activity, food-seeking behaviour and QOL.

 statement guidelines (S1 Checklist) [21]. The study was organised by Royal Canin, and the
protocol was first approved by the Royal Canin Ethics Committee (Permit Number: 140317–
22). Owners of all participating animals gave informed consent in writing. As compensation
for participating, owners were not charged for the study visits, and received some or all of the
weight loss diet free of charge; individual practices decided upon the appropriate compensa-
tion to offer their clients.
Eligibility criteria, recruitment, enrolment and exclusion
Veterinary practices from 27 different countries (Table 1), from 3 global regions (Americas,
Asia, and Europe), were invited to participate in the study. The scientific communication man-
ager of the local subsidiary of the petfood supplier made initial contact and explained the
nature of the trial. If the practice was interested in participating, their eligibility was checked.
Practices were eligible if their veterinary staff were confident about discussing obesity and

 weight management with clients, and if a reliable internet connection was available (because of
the requirement to use internet-based software to monitor programmes). All study investiga-
tors at the practice had to be either a qualified veterinarian or veterinary nurse (technician).
The final decisions on practice participation were made between January 2015 and April 2015.
After being approved for the study, participating practices recruited cases within a period of 4
months, with the weight loss programme for each dog lasting 3 months. Therefore, all cases
had completed the study by the end of August 2015.
To make owners aware of the study, posters were displayed prominently in practice waiting
rooms. Owners of overweight dogs were determined to be eligible for the study if they con-
sented to their dog participating, they agreed to bring their dogs back for assessment, and if
they were readily contactable by telephone or email. Dogs were eligible for enrolment if they
were overweight (e.g. body condition score [BCS] of � 7/9, see below) and were adult age, but
otherwise determined to be in good health. Further, female dogs could not be pregnant or lac-
tating at the time of enrolment. Additional eligibility criteria at the time of enrolment included
the dog having no prior history of an adverse reaction to food, not requiring a therapeutic diet
(other than a weight loss diet), and not having a significant concurrent disease (e.g. hypothy-
roidism, systemic disease such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease etc) determined by
owner history, physical examination, and a review of case records. In addition, concurrent
therapy with drugs that might feasibly influence the weight loss process (e.g. glucocorticoid
therapy, anticonvulsants, appetite stimulants, antibacterials, insulin) was not allowed. How-
ever, prophylactic treatments such as vaccination, ecto- and endo-parasiticides were allowed.
Finally, all dogs had to be used to consuming either a commercial dry or wet food exclusively
or a mix of wet and dry food.
After enrolment, all reasons for subsequent exclusion were recorded. Reasons for sus-
pending participation included failure to return for appointments, refusal and food aversion
resulting in non-consumption of the diet, and failure of the owner to comply with the proto-
col. Development of an unrelated illness during the study was also another reason for possible
trial suspension; in such cases, the attending veterinarian assessed the dog and decided
whether the trial should be discontinued, with decisions being based upon the nature and
severity of the illness, the treatment required, welfare of the patient and wishes of the owner.
If dogs that developed an illness could continue, short-term treatments were permissible,
including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antibacterials, but all details were
recorded.
Weight loss diets
The diets used were high protein high fibre weight loss diets (Table 2), and three options were
available, two of which were dry diets (dry food 1, Satiety Weight Management; dry food 2,
Satiety Small Dog; Royal Canin, Aimargues, France), and the third was a wet diet (wet food,
Satiety Wet, Royal Canin, Aimargues, France). All diets were designed to be complete and bal-
anced for all essential nutrients even when fed at an energy intake that would invoke weight
loss (e.g. less than maintenance requirements). However, they varied in their formulation (e.g.
content of moisture, fibre, protein and nitrogen-free extract; Table 2). Dogs were fed either
dry food exclusively, wet food exclusively, or a mix of wet and dry food depending upon the
preferences of both owner and dog. Although either diet could be used in any dog, dry food 2
was specifically designed for feeding to small dogs (i.e. dogs <10 kg). The trial was open label
in that diets were provided in their normal packaging, and no attempt was made to blind own-
ers to their identity.

 Measurements
All dogs were weighed by study investigators at their veterinary practice on electronic scales
designed for the purpose. The make and model of the weigh scales varied depending upon the
practice, but the same set of scales was always used for the same dog during its weight loss pro-
gramme. Body condition was determined at inclusion using a 9-integer unit BCS system,
which was a modification of the original system of Laflamme [22]. This modified system was
developed with reference to an image archive of dogs attending the Royal Canin Weight Man-
agement Clinic, University of Liverpool [23], and comprising a set of 5 size-specific BCS
charts, for small, medium, large, and giant breeds, respectively. The system was subsequently
validated by comparing estimates of BCS with body fat mass measured by dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry as part of a separate study involving a group of thirty dogs of various breeds
assessed at the Small Animal Teaching University of Liverpool, UK and a high positive correla-
tion was observed (Rs = 0.74, P<0.001). Data from this study have been presented as a research
communication at an international congress [24]. To ensure that study investigators were
experienced in assessing body condition using the BCS system, training was provided by the
local scientific communication manager to a single veterinarian professional during enrolment
of the clinic into the study.
Activity and QOL were subjectively assessed by the veterinarian after a discussion with the
owner (Table 3) to determine which activity and QOL descriptions were most accurate for
their dog. The categories were designed to be mutually exclusive, and at least two characteris-
tics from a category were required for it to be selected. Food-seeking behaviour was also deter-
mined subjectively by the investigator after a discussion with the owner. The different types of
food-seeking behaviour (Table 3) were explained to the client and, if present, their relationship
to feeding determined. Once again, to ensure consistency, the same study investigator per-
formed scores in the same dog.

 Weight loss protocol
The study involved an initial 4-month period for case enrolment, followed by a period of
approximately 3-months to enable all dogs to complete the 5-visit study protocol (Table 4).
During this time, dogs attended for 5 visits, an initial assessment and enrolment visit (visit 1)
and 4 follow-up visits (visits 2 to 5).
During visit 1, dogs were assessed clinically using history and physical examination, and
their eligibility was determined (see above). All dogs were weighed, their BCS assessed, and
subjective assessments were made about their activity, QOL, and food-seeking behaviour. A
2-stage method was used to calculate the initial daily food ration for the study. First, an esti-
mate of target body weight (TBW) was determined by dividing the current body weight by a
factor that took into account the estimated percentage of excess weight (assumed to be 10%
per unit of BCS between 5 and 9) [25]. Therefore, the estimated TBW for dogs with BCS 7, 8,
and 9, were calculated by dividing the current body weight by 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4, respectively.
The initial daily energy allocations ranged from 251 to 335 kJ per kg0.75 of TBW (60 to 80 kcal
per kg0.75 of TBW) per day, depending upon sex and neuter status (sexually intact males 251
kJ/kg0.75 TBW [80 kcal /kg0.75 TBW]; neutered males 293 kJ/kg0.75 TBW [70 kcal/kg0.75 TBW];
sexually intact females 293 kJ/kg0.75 TBW [70 kcal/kg0.75 TBW]; neutered females 251 kJ/kg0.75
TBW 60 kcal/kg0.75 TBW). These allocations were adapted from energy intakes known to
induce controlled weight loss in previous studies using the same or similar diets and involving
obese client-owned dogs [9,10]. A previous study, presented as a research communication at
an international congress, has demonstrated that this 2-stage method better predicts starting
energy intake than methods that utilise current body weight (rather than TBW), that base
intake on resting energy requirement, and that do not factor in sex or neuter status [26]. To
ensure accuracy and consistency amongst practices and investigators, all TBW and energy
allocations were calculated using an internet-based computer programme specifically devel-
oped for the trial (VET FOLLOW UP, Royal Canin). Study investigators entered details of sex,
neuter status, current body weight, and BCS, and the programme then automatically calculated
TBW and starting food allocation, as well as converting the starting allocation to a daily ration
(in grams or tins of food), based on the food type selected (e.g. dry or mix of wet and dry
food). For dry food, in all countries apart from the USA, portion size was accurately deter-
mined using electronic gram scales wherever possible. If owners refused to use electronic gram

 scales, a calibrated measuring cup was instead used: here, the cup was individually calibrated
by first weighing a portion of food on gram scales at the practice, and marking portion size on
the cup using an indelible marker pen. For the USA, owners were provided with an 8 US fl oz
cup (237 mL) with marked graduations corresponding to one quarter, one third, one half,
three-quarters and one cup. All food portions were provided in ounces, and a conversion pro-
vided for the corresponding number of cups. The owners were instructed to divide the daily
ration into at least two daily meals, with food given in the morning and evening. All owners
were counselled about not giving extra food (e.g. table scraps and treats), but formal guidelines
were not provided.
The four follow-up visits were scheduled for 2 weeks (visit 2), 4 weeks (visit 3), 8 weeks
(visit 4), and 12 weeks (visit 5). Veterinarians were asked to schedule each visit at these time
points if possible, although some flexibility was allowed if the owner missed an appointment
or if the owner could not attend at the specific times. However, for some of the statistical
analyses, only data from dogs that complied most closely with the visit schedule were used
(see below). At each recheck, body weight was recorded (as the primary outcome measure),
and the subjective assessments of activity, QOL and food-seeking behaviour were completed.
However, whilst veterinary professionals continued to assess BCS during the study, and use it
to help monitor progress, it was not used as a study outcome measure given its relative insen-
sitivity for detecting changes in body composition, (whereby a change of 10–15% body
weight is typically required for a 1-unit change in BCS) [25]. The weight loss programme was
also discussed with the owner to determine if the owner had been compliant with the pro-
gramme, for example whether they had measured food accurately and whether the dog had
obtained additional food (e.g. treats or table scraps fed by the owner or food stolen by the
dog). The same internet-based computer software was also used to assist for monitoring
progress of weight loss. The study investigator entered the body weight at the visit, and the
software automatically calculated the rate of weight loss based upon the percentage of initial
body weight lost per week. The software then suggested adjustments to the feeding plan to
aim for a weekly weight loss of between 1% and 3% per week. For example, if the rate of
weight loss had been <1% per week, a 10% reduction in energy allocation was suggested,
whilst a 10% increase in energy allocation was recommended if weight loss had been faster
than 3% per week. However, the attending veterinary professional could use their judgement
on adjusting the ration, based upon the individual circumstances of the case. Examples of
reasons for overriding the recommended adjustment included evidence of non-compliance
(which could be corrected by owner counselling) and an owner being reluctant to change the
food allocation.
Data handling and statistical analysis
A formal sample size calculation was not performed. Instead, enrolment of practices for the
trial was a pragmatic one, whereby as many dogs as possible were recruited, if they were willing
to participate and met the eligibility criteria. Within each practice, a pragmatic approach was
also taken for recruitment of dogs. In signing up, no targets were set for each practice but,
instead, as many dogs as possible were recruited in the time limit.
The internet-based software (VET FOLLOW UP, Royal Canin) used by study investigators
to determine food allocations, was also used for data recording. Data included age, sex, neuter
status, breed, body weight, BCS, size, and owner-reported behaviour (activity, QOL and food-
seeking). For size, dogs were assigned to one of three categories based upon TBW data (small
<10 kg; medium 10–25 kg; large >25 kg). Continuous data are reported as mean ±SD, median
and interquartile range (IQR), or median and range, as indicated. The restricted maximum

 likelihood (RML) method was applied to linear mixed models to deal with missing data. Age
data were missing for 3 dogs, information on QOL was missing from 1 dog (visit 5), and
information on food-seeking behaviour was missing from 1 dog (visits 1, 2, 3 and 5). Energy
allocation data were not reported for a total of 80 instances in 31 dogs, whilst body weight mea-
surements of 16 dogs were missing (7 at Visit 2, 5 at Visit 3 and 6 at Visit 4). Data were ana-
lysed with SAS v9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and the level of statistical significance
was set at P<0.05, for two-sided analyses. Datasets containing all study data are available in the
supporting information (S1 and S2 Datasets).
Descriptive statistics on outcomes were calculated for the dogs with complete and reliable
weight loss data (926 dogs; S1 Dataset). Comparative statistical analyses then performed on a
subpopulation of 437 dogs that had complied best with the study visit schedule (Table 4, Fig 1,
S2 Dataset). Changes in rate of weight loss were assessed using linear mixed models with visit
number as a fixed effect and dog as a random term. If residuals were not normally distributed,
quantitative variables were rank transformed. Given that several visits were considered, post-
hoc analyses were adjusted with Scheffe

 Stepwise linear regression analyses were then performed to assess the impact of various
fixed effects (age, sex, neuter status, dog size [small {<10 kg} vs. medium {�10 to <25 kg} vs.
large categories {�25kg}], initial BCS, average energy intake during the study, and continent
[Americas vs. Europe]) on percentage body weight loss in the subpopulation of 437 dogs. Con-
tingency tables were used to assess the independence of each factor vis-à-vis all other factors.
Stepwise regressions were set in such a way that each forward selection step could be followed
by a backward elimination step if necessary using the Schwarz Bayesian Information Criterion
(SBC) [27,28]). In this model, if removal of any effect yields a model with a lower SBC statistic
than the current model, then the effect producing the smallest SBC statistic is removed. When
the removal of any effect increases the SBC statistic then, provided that adding some effect
lowers the SBC statistic, the effect producing the model with the lowest SBC is added (SAS
v9.3; SAS Institute Inc.). The cut-off value (P value) to enter or remove a variable at each step
was set at 0.05. Complementary analysis of baseline data was performed on the subpopulation
(n = 437) using either a classic general linear model (GLM) to assess the effect of the most rele-
vant factors identified in the stepwise regression (e.g. continent, sex and neuter status) and
their interactions (e.g. sex�neuter, sex�continent, neuter�continent, and sex�neuter�conti-
nent). For the GLM analysis, residual distributions were checked for normality and were sub-
sequently rank transformed if not normal.
Statistical analyses of subjective scores of activity, QOL and food-seeking behaviour (rank
transformed to be treated as ordinal data) were conducted using linear mixed models with
visit number, initial body condition (BCS 7/9 vs BCS 8-9/9) and their related interaction as
fixed effects, and dog as a random term. Given that several visits were considered, post-hoc
analyses were adjusted with Scheffe
´’s method to avoid alpha-risk inflation.
Results
Details of participating countries, practices, and dogs
A total of 340 veterinary practices from 27 countries participated (Table 1). After initial screen-
ing, 2214 dogs were eligible, but only 1565 of owners consented to their dog participating (Fig
1). Of the participating dogs, 987 (63.1%) completed the full 3 months of weight loss attending
all visits. Of the 578 dogs that did not complete the trial, 474 dogs (82.0%) failed to return for
revisits and were lost to follow up, 40 (6.9%) stopped due to owner non-compliance, 11 (1.9%)
stopped because of a concurrent medical condition, 7 (1.2%) stopped because the dog refused
to eat the food, and 2 (0.2%) owners found the programme too tough to follow. The reasons
why the remaining 44 dogs (7.6%) stopped were not recorded.
After reviewing the records, complete and reliable data for all 5 visits were available for 926
of the 987 dogs, 568 (61%) of which were female (433 neutered) and 358 dogs (39%) were male
(238 neutered). The dogs comprised 82 different breeds, with 297 dogs (32%) being of mixed
or unknown breed (Table 5). The most common pedigree breeds represented were Labrador
Retriever (142, 15%), Golden Retriever (60, 6%), Beagle (37, 4%) Pug (34, 4%), Dachshund
(30, 3%), Chihuahua (24, 3%) and German Shepherd dog (24, 3%). Age data were available for
903 dogs and, within this group, the median age was 74 months (range 12 to 193 months).
Median starting body weight of the dogs was 23.2 kg (range 2.1 to 80.0 kg) and median BCS
was 8 (range 7 to 9).
Weight loss food and dietary energy allocation
Of the 926 study dogs, 750 (81%) were fed dry food exclusively (median weight 25.5 kg, range
2.1–80.0 kg), 170 (18%) were fed a mix of wet and dry food (median weight 16.5 kg, range 2.6–
72.9 kg), and the remaining 6 (1%) were fed wet food exclusively (median weight 40.7 kg,

 range 3.5–54.2 kg). Of the 750 dogs that were fed dry food exclusively, 601 (65% of total) were
given dry diet 1 (median weight 31.8 kg, range 3.5–80.0 kg) and the remaining 149 (16% of
total) were given dry diet 2 (median weight 9.0 kg, range 2.1–25.4 kg). Of the 170 dogs that
were fed a mix of wet and dry food, dry food 1 and dry food 2 were used in 110 dogs (12% of
total, median weight 10.2 kg, range 2.6–41.0 kg) and 60 dogs (6% of total, median weight 30.3
kg, range 4.8–72.9 kg), respectively.
The mean ±SD starting allocation for the study dogs was 276 ±35.6 kJ/kg0.75/day TBW
(66 ±8.5 kcal/kg0.75/day TBW), whilst the mean energy allocation for the whole of the 12 weeks
was 264 ±43.5 kJ/kg0.75/day TBW (63 ±10.2 kcal/kg0.75/day TBW).
Weight loss outcomes
Weight loss was seen in 896/926 dogs (96.8%), whilst 14 (1.5%) maintained a stable weight (i.e.
weight remained ±1% of starting body weight), and 16 (1.7%) gained >1% weight. A total of
896 (96.8%), 814 (87.9%), 543 (58.6%), and 78 (8.4%) dogs lost more than 1%, 5%, 10% and
20% of their starting body weight, respectively. By the end of the study 65/926 dogs (7.0%) had
reached target body weight and were in ideal body condition, as judged by BCS performed by
the attending veterinary professional.
Although the planned schedule for follow up was 4 visits over 12 weeks (visits 2 to 5), there
was considerable deviation from this, with median (IQR) time from starting the programme
(visit 1) being 15 days (14–19 days), 32 days (28–41 days), 61 days (56–70 days), and 91 days
(82–102 days) for visits 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The mean (±SD) initial body weight lost was
3.2 ±3.20% (by visit 2), 5.7 ±3.96% (by visit 3), 8.7 ±4.85% (by visit 4) and 11.4 ±5.85% (by visit

 5). The mean ±SD rate of weight loss for the whole of the study was 0.9 ±0.45% of initial body
weight per week, whilst rates of weight loss for the periods between visits were as follows: visit
1 to 2: 1.3% per week (0.6–1.9% per week); visit 2 to 3: 1.0% per week (IQR: 0.4–1.5% per
week); visit 3 to 4: 0.9% per week (IQR: 0.4–1.2% per week); and visit 4 to 5: 0.8% per week
(IQR: 0.3–1.1% per week). The number of dogs losing weight at >2% per week was 221
(23.9%) between visits 1 and 2, 105 (11.3%) between visits 2–3, 32 (3.4%) between visits 3–4,
and 9 (1.0%) between visits 4–5. Only 6 dogs (0.6%) maintained a rate of weight loss of >2%
per week throughout the whole study. In the 437 dogs (47.2%) that complied closely with the
visit schedule, mean (±SD) rate of weight loss decreased sequentially over the 5 visits (visit 1 to
2: 1.4±1.35% per week; visit 2 to 3: 1.1 ±1.26% per week; visit 3 to 4: 0.9 ±0.84% per week; visit
4 to 5: 0.7 ±0.96% per week; P<0.001).
Factors affecting outcome of weight loss
The 437 dogs (47.2%) that complied closely with the visit schedule were also used to determine
factors influencing the percentage weight loss, the primary outcome of the study. Inclusion of
the terms sex, neuter status and continent decreased the SBC and so were retained for analysis
using GLM; in contrast, the presence of the remaining factors (age, size, initial BCS and aver-
age calorie allocation) had a negative effect on the overall fit of the final model, and so were
not retained. Using GLM, sex (P = 0.007) and neuter status (P = 0.001) were independently
associated with percentage weight loss, with female dogs (median 12.0% weight loss, IQR 8.6–
14.9%) losing more weight than male dogs (median 10.4% weight loss, IQR 7.4–14.1%), and
entire dogs (median 12.9% weight loss, IQR 9.0–16.7%) losing more weight than neutered
dogs (median 10.9% weight loss, IQR 7.9–14.0%, Fig 2). Post-hoc analyses showed that at base-
line, neuter status was homogenously distributed for BCS, sexual status and age levels, whereas
it was heterogeneously distributed for continent and size levels. Although continent was not
significantly associated with percentage weight loss in this model (P = 0.216), the interaction
of sex and continent was (P = 0.030, Fig 3). In this respect, the sex effect on weight loss was
most pronounced on the American continent (female median 11.5%, IQR 8.5–14.5%; male
median 9.1%, IQR 6.3–12.1%, p = 0.053), compared to the European continent (female median
12.3%, IQR 8.9–14.9%; male median 10.9%, IQR 8.6–15.4%, P = 0.957). Post-hoc analyses
of sexual status at baseline revealed that it was homogenously distributed for all other consid-
ered factors. No other interactions (neuter�sex, P = 0.508; neuter�continent, P = 0.154; neu-
ter�sex�continent, P = 0.205) were significant in the final model.
Activity
At the initial visit, 292 (31.5%), 466 (50.3%), and 168 (18.1%) dogs had an owner-reported
activity score of -1, 0 and 1, respectively (Fig 4). There was no difference in activity scores
between dogs with BCS 7/9 and those with BCS 8-9/9, (P = 0.226). Activity increased during
the study (P<0.001), with post-hoc analysis revealing significantly improved activity for visits
2, 3, 4, and 5, compared with baseline (Fig 4), and significant improvement in activity at each
sequential visit.
Quality of life
At the initial visit, 157 (17.0%), 501 (54.1%), and 268 (28.9%) dogs had an owner-reported
QOL score of -1, 0 and 1, respectively, (Fig 5). There was no difference in QOL scores between
dogs with BCS 7/9 and those with BCS 8-9/9 (P = 0.195). Quality of life increased during the
study (P<0.001), with post-hoc analysis revealing significantly improved quality of life for

 visits 3, 4, and 5, compared with baseline (Fig 5). Further, apart from between visits 1 and 2,
QOL improved significantly at each sequential visit.
Food-seeking behaviour
At the initial visit, 215 (23.2%), 298 (32.2%), 233 (25.2%), and 179 (19.4%) dogs had an owner-
reported food-seeking behaviour score of -3, -2, -1, and 0, respectively (Fig 6). There was no
difference in the proportion of dogs in the different food-seeking categories between dogs with
BCS 7/9 and those with BCS 8-9/9 (P = 0.367), but a significant association was identified for
food-seeking behaviour between visit number and neuter status, whereby food intake for intact
dogs was greater than neutered dogs at visit 5 only (P = 0.008). Decreased food-seeking behav-
iour was observed during the study (P<0.001), with post-hoc analysis revealed that food-seek-
ing behaviour improved for visits 2, 3, 4, and 5, compared with baseline (Fig 6). Further, apart
from between visits 3 and 4, food-seeking behaviour improved significantly at each sequential
visit.

 Discussion
We report the largest multi-centre weight loss study conducted to date on overweight pet
dogs. Most dogs enrolled completed all 12 weeks of the trial, and lost an average of 11% of
their body weight. A weight loss rate of 1–2% per week is a frequently suggested target for

 weight loss, based upon experimental studies involving colonies of research dogs [14,15,16].
There was wide variation in the rates of weight loss amongst dogs in this study, which could be
due to a variety of factors, including the method used to estimate starting energy intake. In this
respect, such methods use mathematical equations to estimate the starting energy intake for
weight loss; whilst such estimates correlate strongly on average with the actual energy intakes
that lead to successful weight loss, they can either over- or under-estimate the requirements of
some dogs [26]. Further, the average rate of weight loss was <1% per week, and this occurred
even though adjustments to energy intake were made when weight loss was slower than
expected. Although the computer software recommended a 10% reduction in intake, veteri-
nary professionals could tailor the intake depending on the circumstances of the case. It is pos-
sible that faster rates of weight loss might have been observed had veterinary professionals
been allowed to make larger adjustments in energy intake. That said, the rate of weight loss

 observed in the current study is similar to the rates of weight loss seen in many other studies
assessing weight loss in obese pet dogs where, again, energy intake adjustments were made
according to progress [9,10,11,12]. Further, although a rate of weight loss >1% per week was
not achieved by many study dogs, others fared better with approximately a quarter losing >2%
per week during the early stages. In theory, such rates of weight loss could be concerning, not
least given that some studies have suggested that faster rates of weight loss might increase loss
of lean tissue mass in cats [29]. However, rate of weight loss has not been associated with lean
tissue loss in other work [9], and most dogs did not maintain this rate of loss throughout the
study. Further work would be needed to determine if such a short-term period of rapid weight
loss increases lean tissue loss.
Criticisms of the weight loss studies previously conducted in obese pet dogs include the fact
that they are conducted at single centres, which are often academic institutions. Whilst such

 studies have the advantage of uniformity in recruitment, management, weight loss regimen
and follow-up, single-centre studies are usually small and therefore do not reflect the variabil-
ity of weight loss within typical primary care practices. A strength of the current study is the
fact that it involved many primary care practices from diverse locations and, whilst there were
some differences in outcome, results were overwhelmingly positive. This suggests that the
principles of weight management are appropriate for a range of clinical practices across many
countries.
Three factors were identified that affected the amount of weight lost overall, sex, neuter sta-
tus, and continent. To our knowledge, this is the first time that any such factors have been

 shown to affect outcomes of weight loss. The fact that sexually intact dogs lost more weight
than neutered dogs is not unexpected, since energy requirements for neutered dogs are typi-
cally less [30,31]. That said, we had attempted to take this into account when calculating initial
energy allocation, with neutered dogs being given 10 kcal per kg0.75 less that their sexually
intact counterparts. One explanation for the slower rate of weight loss despite greater energy
restriction might be because neutered dogs displayed greater food seeking behaviour, and this
might have led to worse owner compliance on the programme. The reason why percentage
weight loss was greater in female compared with male dogs is not clear. This might have been
because the starting energy allocation for female dogs was less than for male dogs. Most
intriguing is the effect of geographical location on this sex effect, whereby the difference
between male and female dogs was more marked in the Americas compared with Europe. This
occurred despite the same protocol for weight loss being used (e.g. food, computer software,
monitoring protocol, and rules governing adjustments in food portions). Further work is
required firstly to confirm this study observation, and secondly to determine its cause.
In addition to assessing short-term weight loss outcomes, we assessed owner opinions on
their dog’s behaviour during the weight loss trial. Quality of life was judged subjectively using
an owner questionnaire. The main reason for using this method was that it was simple,
enabling information to be gathered from an owner in a matter of minutes. However, its main
disadvantage was the fact that it had not been previously validated. A previously-validated
questionnaire could instead have been used, for example, the health-related QOL question-
naire that some of the authors have previously used [20]. However, being 19-pages long and
including over 100 questions, it takes considerable time for an owner to complete, and then
requires complex statistical analysis. Not only could this have created issues of compliance
with owners, but the data analysis would have been problematic given the size of the current
study. Despite the limitation of using an unvalidated questionnaire, findings were consistent
with those of other studies assessing health-related QOL with validated methods [6, 20]. In one
of these studies, 3 of 4 aspects of QOL improved significantly with weight loss, including an
improvement in ’vitality’ (mobility-related behaviour) and a decrease in both ’emotional dis-
turbances’ and ’pain-related behaviour’ [6]. In a similar manner, the owners in the current
study reported that their dogs’ QOL improved after weight loss, and these improvements were
observed within the first 2 weeks with further sequential improvements thereafter.
Previous work has revealed mixed results in terms of the effects of weight loss on activity.
Studies using accelerometry have demonstrated decreased activity in obese compared with
lean dogs [18], but have not demonstrated improvements in activity in obese dogs that lose
weight [12, 19]. In contrast, other objective assessments of mobility such as force plate analysis
have demonstrated both differences in gait between lean and obese dogs [32], and improve-
ments in mobility of obese dogs with concurrent osteoarthritis after modest (i.e. just 6%)
weight loss [13]. Further, including physical activity in a weight loss regimen helps preserve
lean tissue mass [12]. Although the method of assessment of activity in the current study was a
subjective one, the improvement in activity observed by owners is equivalent to subjective
owner improvement reported in other studies where objective assessments have also been
used [10,11].
Maintaining owner compliance with weight programmes is a key challenge for veterinary
professionals. This is highlighted by the fact that 37% of enrolled dogs did not complete the
trial, mostly for failure either to comply with the individualised programme or for failure to
return for visits. Furthermore, although only 4 follow-up visits were required, there was
marked variability in the timings of these visits. Whilst this may have influenced the outcomes
of the study, this variability is expected with weight loss programmes in pet dogs. In many
respects, this is a strength of the weight loss protocol, the fact that most dogs had a positive

 outcome in terms of weight loss and behavioural improvements despite such deviations in
study protocol. A further challenge for owners complying with a weight loss programme is the
fact that energy restriction has the potential to cause hunger and this can then lead to an
increase in food-seeking behaviour [9]. Unexpectedly, most owners did not report increased
food-seeking behaviour in the current study and, in fact, a significant decrease in such behav-
iour was noted. This observation might be because a high protein high fibre diet was used
since such diets are known to reduce voluntary food intake compared with other diets [33,34],
as well as improving outcomes of weight loss [10]. However, a genuine effect of diet cannot be
confirmed because no comparator diet was used in the study by way of control. Instead, own-
ers’ opinions about food-seeking behaviour could have been influenced by a ’placebo effect’
since the assessment of food-seeking behaviour was subjective. Owner opinions of food-seek-
ing behaviour might have been biased by what veterinary professionals told them about the
characteristics of the weight loss diet. Further, the trial was short-term and it is possible that
owners would have observed more food-seeking behaviour as time went on, not least given
that further reductions to energy intake would have been expected to maintain weight loss.
This increasing energy restriction might increase the tendency for food-seeking behaviour
over the longer term. Ideally, further studies should be considered to determine how food-
seeking behaviour changes with weight loss.
One limitation of the current study was the fact that it was short term and the dogs were
not followed until they achieved an ideal body condition, with few losing >15% of their start-
ing body weight. This is not surprising since the median duration of a complete weight loss
cycle (e.g. returning dogs to ideal body weight) is 9 months, and some dogs require >12
months to reach target [9]. Therefore, the dogs in the current study might have benefited
more if the study had continued for longer. That said, measurable benefits have been seen in
other studies where dogs lost an equivalent amount of weight; for example, improved mobil-
ity, as determined by force plate analysis, has been observed with just 6% weight loss [13].
The rate of weight loss decreased significantly during the study, which is consistent with
findings observed in other studies [35]. This makes weight loss challenging for the most
obese dogs with the most weight to lose, perhaps accounting for why they are more likely to
fail [17]. However, whilst the short-term nature of the study is a weakness, it nonetheless
highlights the fact the benefits of weight loss occur before target weight is reached. In this
respect, owners reported improvements in both activity and QOL during weight loss even
though few reached their target weight. That said, given the potential for failure with a com-
plete weight loss programme, some have argued that partial weight loss programmes might
be more appropriate for some dogs, and returning a dog to ideal weight might not be neces-
sary [35]. Such strategies have the benefit that they are shorter and more realistic for many
owners. Further, since they tap into the success of the early weight loss period, compliance is
higher [35]. The results of the current study provide some support for this approach, since
owners reported significant improvements in wellbeing even though the weight loss was
only partial.
A second limitation was the fact that the study was uncontrolled and open label, in that
both the veterinary professionals and owners were aware of the identity of the diets used for
the study and might have been influenced, for example, by the packaging. Thus, it neither
proves that the weight loss diet used was superior to other diets, nor that the findings can nec-
essarily be assumed to apply to other weight loss diets. As alluded to above, the possibility of a
placebo effect cannot be discounted either. This is unlikely to be the case for changes that were
objectively measured, such as body weight, but cannot be discounted for more subjective
observations, such as changes in activity, QOL, and food-seeking behaviour. In this respect, a

 recent meta-analysis of placebo interventions in human studies demonstrated that significant
clinical effects of placebo interventions can occur for patient-reported outcomes such as pain
and nausea [36], which are also subjective. Therefore, these results should be interpreted cau-
tiously and, ideally, randomised controlled trials should be considered.
The global nature of this study was a key aspect and enabled differences in geographical
location to be assessed. However, a third study limitation was the fact that no attempt was
made to recruit cases in a systematic fashion to ensure that all regions were appropriately
represented. This limited the study’s ability to compare factors associated with weight loss
amongst all geographical regions. Instead, comparisons were only made between dogs
recruited from the European and American continents. Fourth, there were differences in
how food portions were measured, with some owners using gram scales, others using a cali-
brated measuring cup, and those from the USA using a non-calibrated measuring cup.
Whilst this might have influenced outcomes, the method of measuring portions was unfor-
tunately not recorded. A further study limitation was the fact that no information was gath-
ered from owners about giving extra food such as table scraps and treats. Therefore, we
were not able to explore whether such owner practices varied within the study population
and, most notably, amongst different geographical locations. A final study limitation is the
fact that many dogs were enrolled, but a significant proportion (37%) did not complete the
trial. Whilst this retention rate is consistent with other field weight loss studies [11,17], it
emphasises the challenges that can be faced on a weight loss programme, most notably in
terms of maintaining compliance for the owner. This highlights the need for veterinary pro-
fessionals to pay close attention to maintaining good communication with owners during
the whole of a weight loss period, to keep them motivated and address any problems they
face.
Conclusion
In summary, this is the largest international multi-centre weight loss study conducted to date
in overweight dogs. Most dogs lost weight, but there were notable differences between intact
and neutered dogs, between dogs of different sexes and between dogs in different geographical
locations. While the short-term duration of the study did not permit most dogs to reach their
target weight, owners observed positive behavioural changes including improved activity and
quality of life.
