BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to understand the safety of e-cigarettes with 
adolescents. We sought to identify the presence of chemical toxicants associated with 
e-cigarette use among adolescents.
METHODS: Adolescent e-cigarette users (≥1 use within the past 30 days, ≥10 lifetime 
e-cigarette use episodes) were divided into e-cigarette–only users (no cigarettes in the  
past 30 days, urine 4-[methylnitrosamino]-1-[3-pyridyl]-1-butanol [NNAL] level <1 pg/mL  
of creatinine; n = 67), dual users (use of cigarettes in the past 30 days in addition to 
e-cigarettes, NNAL level >30 pg/mL; n = 16), and never-using controls (N = 20). Saliva was 
collected within 24 hours of the last e-cigarette use for analysis of cotinine and urine for 
analysis of NNAL and levels of 8 volatile organic chemical compounds. Bivariate analyses 
compared e-cigarette–only users with dual users, and regression analyses compared 
e-cigarette–only users with dual users and controls on levels of toxicants.
RESULTS: The participants were 16.4 years old on average. Urine excretion of metabolites of 
benzene, ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylamide was significantly higher 
in dual users versus e-cigarette–only users (all P < .05). Excretion of metabolites of 
acrylonitrile, acrolein, propylene oxide, acrylamide, and crotonaldehyde were significantly 
higher in e-cigarette–only users compared with controls (all P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Although e-cigarette vapor may be less hazardous than tobacco smoke, our 
findings can be used to challenge the idea that e-cigarette vapor is safe, because many of the 
volatile organic compounds we identified are carcinogenic. Messaging to teenagers should 
include warnings about the potential risk from toxic exposure to carcinogenic compounds 
generated by these products.

 Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
are marketed to promote smoking 
cessation or reduced cigarette 
smoking in adults.1 However, social 
influence and marketing strategies 
for these products have clearly had 
an effect on children as well, because 
more teenagers now use e-cigarettes 
than traditional cigarettes.2 In 2016, 
e-cigarette use in the past 30 days 
among 10th-graders was more than 
twice that of cigarette use (11.0% 
vs 4.9%).3 Reasons for the dramatic 
increase in adolescent e-cigarette 
use include peer influence, enticing 
flavors, 
4 and extensive marketing 
presenting e-cigarettes as safer.5, 
 
6 
Common messages found on product 
Web sites are that e-cigarettes do 
not produce the same cancer-causing 
agents as traditional cigarettes.1
Despite advertising claims, there 
is uncertainty about the safety of 
e-cigarettes. By using aerosolized 
nicotine rather than combusting 
tobacco, e-cigarettes do produce 
fewer toxins than smoking 
cigarettes.7 However, e-cigarettes 
contain additives and solvents, 
including propylene glycol and/or 
glycerol, which can form carcinogenic 
compounds when heated.8 
–11 These 
and other toxic chemicals12 may be 
inhaled through the vapor produced. 
Although there is some controversy 
on how use patterns may affect 
exposure, some data from adults 
reveal that these toxicants can be 
detected in the urine of e-cigarette 
users.13, 
 
14 Importantly, these studies 
did not exclude participants with a 
possible exposure to secondhand 
smoke.
To our knowledge, there are no data 
on toxicant exposure in adolescent 
e-cigarette users. However, there is 
great concern because exposure to 
toxicants during adolescence may 
result in greater harm than exposure 
in adulthood, given vulnerability 
to the acute and chronic effects of 
toxicants in general and from their 
cumulative exposure if started 
early.15
Given the rapid uptake of e-cigarettes 
among teenagers, there is an urgent 
need to understand the safety of 
these products in adolescents, 
including how use contributes to 
toxicant exposure. In this study, we 
sought to assess in adolescents the 
presence of certain carcinogenic 
toxicants linked to e-cigarette use 
and examine how specific behavioral 
patterns of use may influence 
exposure to toxicants.
MethODs
Participants and Procedures
As part of an ongoing longitudinal 
study of the effects of e-cigarettes 
on adolescents, adolescent (aged 
13–18 years) e-cigarette users (used 
an e-cigarette product on ≥1 day in 
the past 30 days and had at least 10 
lifetime use episodes) were recruited 
from the San Francisco Bay area by 
using fliers and online advertising. 
The research design and procedures 
were reviewed and approved by the 
University of California Institutional 
Review Board.
To capture nicotine exposure and 
investigate the presence of toxicants, 
participants were instructed to 
schedule their baseline appointments 
in temporal proximity (ie, past 24 
hours) to use of their e-cigarettes. 
Adolescents were never pressured 
or instructed to use e-cigarettes, 
and in the cases in which no use 
occurred, appointments were 
rescheduled. After signing consents, 
participants completed a baseline 
survey including questions about 
demographics and e-cigarette 
use behaviors. Participants then 
provided saliva samples for cotinine 
measurement and urine for the 
measurement of the tobacco-specific 
nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-
1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) 
and levels of metabolites of 8 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 
Participants received $30.
Specimens were also collected from 
20 age-matched control adolescents 
attending pediatric clinics at a 
Bay area public hospital with 
undetectable cotinine and NNAL, 
confirming no e-cigarette or nicotine 
use. These adolescents were part 
of another study on secondhand 
smoke exposure for which urine was 
collected and analyzed for NNAL and 
cotinine.
Measures
Biological
Saliva and urine samples 
were analyzed at the Clinical 
Pharmacology Laboratory at 
the University of California, San 
Francisco. Salivary specimens were 
analyzed for cotinine, the main 
proximate metabolite of nicotine, 
by using liquid chromatography–
tandem mass spectrometry.16, 
 
17 
Urine was analyzed for NNAL, a 
metabolite of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-
1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, a 
tobacco-specific nitrosamine that is 
a potent carcinogen, 
13, 
 
18 by liquid 
chromatography–tandem mass 
spectrometry.18 This was done as 
an adjunct to self-reported tobacco 
smoking and to rule out significant 
secondhand tobacco smoke exposure 
(or exposure from marijuana blunts), 
because NNAL is detectable in urine 
for 6 to 12 weeks after exposure.19 
Urine was analyzed for metabolites 
of a panel of 8 VOCs that are toxic 
environmental or tobacco smoke 
constituents, including benzene 
(phenylmercapturic acid [PMA]), 1, 
3-butadiene (4-hydroxy-2-buten-
1-yl-mercapturic acid), ethylene 
oxide (2-hydroxyethylmercapturic 
acid [HEMA]), acrylonitrile 
(2-cyanoethylmercapturic 
acid [CNEMA]), acrolein 
(3-hydroxypropylmercapturic 
acid [3-HPMA]), propylene oxide 
(2-hydroxypropylmercapturic 
acid [2-HPMA]), acrylamide 
(2-carbamoylethylmercapturic 
acid [AAMA]), and crotonaldehyde 
(3-hydroxy-1-methyl-

Both NNAL and VOC concentrations 
were normalized for creatinine.21
Demographic, E-Cigarette, and Smoking 
Characteristics
Demographic variables included 
race and/or ethnicity, sex, and 
age. Individuals who identified as 
Hispanic were classified as such, 
regardless of race. A measure of 
e-cigarette use was designed for this 
study that included the time of last 
use (used to calculate hours since 
last use), frequency of use (days used 
in the past month), quantity of use 
(average sessions per day on using 
days, calculated by asking how many 
times they used their devices on 
each weekday and weekend day and 
then dividing by 7), usual number of 
puffs per session in 4 categories (1–4, 
5–10, 10–15, or >15), length of each 
session in 4 categories (1–2, 3–5, 
6–10, or >10 minutes), main type of 
e-cigarette used in 4 categories (vape 
pen, modified, Juul, other), whether 
e-cigarettes contained nicotine 
(always, sometimes, unsure, or 
never), and the flavors consumed in 
the past month (fruit, candy, menthol, 
or tobacco; yes or no). Tobacco use 
was assessed by asking if participants 
smoked a cigarette in the past 30 
days (yes or no).
Data analyses
Three categories were developed 
on the basis of the combination of 
reported e-cigarette and cigarette use 
and urine NNAL levels. E-cigarette–
only users had used no traditional 
combustion cigarettes in the past  
30 days and had levels of urine 
NNAL <1 pg/mL of creatinine. We 
used 1 pg per milliliter of creatinine 
to exclude smokers on the basis of 
our data to distinguish adolescents 
who were smokers from those who 
were nonsmokers in San Francisco.22 
Values between 0 and 1 pg/mg 
indicate no recent active smoking 
and either past smoking or light 
secondhand smoke exposure, neither 
of which would be expected to 
substantially increase VOC exposure. 
Dual users reported use of traditional 
cigarettes in the past 30 days in 
addition to e-cigarettes and had to 
have NNAL levels >30 pg/mL  
of creatinine. We chose a cutoff of 
30 pg/mL of creatinine to ensure 
primary exposure to combusted 
tobacco. To ensure no exposure 
to combusted tobacco or nicotine 
from other sources (including 
e-cigarettes), controls had to have 
levels of NNAL and cotinine below 
the limit of quantitation (ie, 0.25 
and 1 ng/mL respectively). We 
excluded from analyses participants 
who did not use an e-cigarette in 
the previous 24 hours because most 
VOCs in smokers, including those 
tested here, decline to baseline 
levels within 24 hours.23 Finally, 
for the purposes of creating well-
differentiated comparison groups, 
we also set an a priori exclusion from 
analyses for those participants who 
had intermediate levels of NNAL (ie, 
1–29 pg/mL of creatinine), because 
the true source of exposure would 
be unclear. Conservative criteria 
for group definitions meant that the 
e-cigarette–only group was clearly 
differentiated from the dual user 
group, and any VOCs found in the 
e-cigarette–only group could be 
clearly attributed to e-cigarette use.
Descriptive statistics were used to 
characterize sociodemographic and 
e-cigarette use, t tests were used for 
continuous variables, and Pearson’s 
χ2 tests were used for categorical 
variables. Because of skew, the 
nonparametric Mann–Whitney 
U test was used to compare the 
distributions on hours since last use 
between e-cigarette–only and dual 
users.
Medians were reported for cotinine, 
NNAL, and all 8 VOCs because of 
non-normal distribution. Regression 
models including planned covariates 
(sex, race and/or ethnicity) 
compared e-cigarette–only users 
(reference group) with dual users 
and controls on log-transformed 
levels of VOCs (8 models). Among 
e-cigarette–only users, Pearson’s r 
was used to calculate associations 
between levels of VOCs and 
e-cigarette use characteristics. For 
any models revealing significant 
differences in levels of VOCs between 
e-cigarette–only users and controls, 
analysis of variance was used to 
examine VOCs by type of product 
used, and t tests were used to 
compare VOCs by the presence or 
absence of flavors used in the past 
month.
Although we tried to eliminate 
exposure to blunts (tobacco mixed 
with marijuana) using NNAL, we 
could not exclude the potential 
contribution of VOC exposure from 
marijuana smoking on the day of the 
study.24 Consequently, we estimated 
and tested regression models of log-
transformed VOC values that were 
significant in the first set of analyses, 
including planned covariates (sex, 
race and/or ethnicity), with the 
additional covariate of self-reported 
frequency of marijuana use.
Results
Three hundred eighty-six adolescents 
were screened, 229 were found 
to be eligible, and 180 agreed to 
participate. After verbally reporting 
use within 24 hours, 29 participants 
admitted on their surveys to not 
using an e-cigarette product in 
the previous 24 hours and thus 
were excluded from analyses. An 
additional 48 adolescents had levels 
of NNAL that might be consistent 
with substantial secondhand 
exposure or occasional cigarette 
smoking (ie, 1–29 pg per milligram 
of creatinine) and, as per our a 
priori criteria described above, were 
excluded from analyses. The final 
sample consisted of 67 e-cigarette–
only users, 16 dual users, and  
20 controls.

 e-cigarette use behaviors
E-cigarette–only users reported 
using their e-cigarettes a mean 
of 12.8 days (SD = 8.9) a month 
compared with 25.5 days (SD = 6.6) 
for dual users (P < .001) (Table 1). 
There was no difference in time 
since the last use of e-cigarettes 
between e-cigarette–only (mean: 
2:02 hours) and dual users (mean: 
1:58 hours; P > .91). Among 
e-cigarette–only users, the level of 
salivary cotinine was significantly 
associated with both the number of 
days using an e-cigarette in the past 
30 days (r = 0.34; P < .01) and the 
mean number of use sessions a day 
(r = 0.75; P < .001).
E-cigarette–only participants who 
reported using nicotine containing 
products “all” or “some” of the time 
had significantly higher levels of 
saliva cotinine compared with those 
who “never” used or were “unsure” 
if there was nicotine in their 
e-cigarettes (31 ng/mL [SD =  
130.8] versus 0.08 ng/mL [SD = 
0.38]; P < .001). E-cigarette–only 
participants who used nicotine in 
their e-cigarettes also reported 
using their e-cigarettes more 
frequently, with an average use 
of 15.1 (SD = 9.2) days per month 
compared with 7.6 (SD = 5.6) days 
(P < .001) and an average of 2.5 
(SD = 4.0) sessions per day on days 
they used versus 0.65 (SD = 0.61) 
sessions (P < .01).
Presence and comparison of VOcs
Urine excretion of metabolites of 
benzene (PMA), ethylene oxide 
(HEMA), acrylonitrile (CNEMA), 
acrolein (3-HPMA), and acrylamide 
(AAMA) was significantly higher 
in dual users versus e-cigarette–
only users and controls (all P < 
.05; see Table 2; Fig 1). Excretion 
of metabolites of 5 VOCs was 
significantly higher in e-cigarette–
only users compared with controls 
(all P < .05): acrylonitrile (341% 
higher than in controls but 327% 
lower than in dual users), acrolein 
(20% higher than in controls but 
11% lower than in dual users), 
propylene oxide (51% higher than 
in controls but 8% lower than in 
dual users; 2-HPMA), acrylamide 
(30% higher than in controls but 
23% lower than in dual users), and 
crotonaldehyde (20% higher than in 
controls but 7% lower than in dual 
users; HMPMA).
We reran the 5 regression models 
used to predict the 5 log-transformed 
VOC values that were significant in 
the first set of analyses, including 
predictors of planned covariates (sex, 
race and/or ethnicity) and contrasts 
between e-cigarette–only users 
and dual users, with the additional 
covariate of self-reported frequency 
of marijuana use. In all models, group

associations between VOcs and 
e-cigarette use
Among e-cigarette–only users, 
levels of the 5 VOCs (ie, CNEMA, 
3-HPMA, 2-HPMA, AAMA, HMPMA) 
that were significantly greater than 
the levels found in controls were 
not associated with time since last 
e-cigarette use (P values ranged 
from .53 to .92). Compared with 
those who never used nicotine in 
their e-cigarettes or were unsure, 
participants who reported using 
nicotine in their e-cigarettes all or 
some of the time had significantly 
higher median levels of urinary 
CNEMA (1.50 vs 0.88 ng/mL 
creatinine; P = .05) and AAMA (71.5 
vs 60.4 ng/mL creatinine, P = .05). 
The average number of sessions 
of e-cigarette use per day was 
associated with increased levels of 
CNEMA (r = 0.36, P = .003). Days 
of use in the past month was not 
associated with any increases in 
urinary VOC levels (P values raged 
from .21 to .72) among e-cigarette–
only users.
There were no differences in levels 
of the 5 significant VOCs that were 
based on that type of product used 
(F test scores ranged from 0.51 
to 2.3; P values ranged from .09 
[for 2-HPMA] to .67). Participants 
who reported using fruit flavors in 
the past month had higher CNEMA 
levels than those who did not (yes: 
mean = 10.4 ng/mL creatinine 
[SD = 21.7]; no: mean 2.1 ng/mL 
creatinine [SD = 3.4]; P = .03). There 
were no differences in VOC levels 
among those who favored candy 
(P values ranged from .33 to .87), 
tobacco (P values ranged from .42 
to .87), or menthol flavors (P values 
ranged from .09 [for 2-HPMA] to .95) 
compared with those who did not.
DIscussIOn
To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first study to report on 
the presence of VOC toxicants in 
adolescent e-cigarette users. Overall 
results reveal significantly greater 
toxicant exposure in adolescent 
e-cigarette users compared with 
their nonusing peers. Adolescent 
e-cigarette–only users had levels of 5 
VOC toxicants detected in their urine 
in quantities up to 3 times greater 
than in matched controls, including 
metabolites of acrylonitrile, acrolein, 
propylene oxide, acrylamide, and 
crotonaldehyde. Levels of toxicant 
exposure in dual users were up to 3 
times higher than in those who used 
only e-cigarettes. Post hoc analyses 
revealed that, among dual users, 
levels of VOCs were not associated 
with NNAL (P values ranged from 
.17 to .81), suggesting that the higher 
VOCs were not only due to exposure 
to traditional cigarettes.
The presence of harmful ingredients 
in e-cigarette vapor has been 
established25; we can now say that 
these chemicals are found in the body 
of human adolescents who use these 
products. A risk analysis of lifelong 
exposure to even low-level VOCs, 
derived using data from secondhand 
tobacco smoke exposure, indicated 
an increased cancer risk, which 
could be applicable to exposure 
in the current study.26 Of course, 
this assumes that the exposures 
will be ongoing, which has not 
yet been established. It is worth 
noting that although e-cigarette–
only users had significantly higher 
exposure to 5 VOCs, controls also 
had detectable levels of these 
chemicals. In fact, human exposure 
to VOCs from environmental sources 
is ubiquitous.27 It is also worth

 noting that levels of VOCs detected 
in e-cigarette–only users were on 
average lower than has been reported 
among adults.13, 
14, 
 
28 For example, 
using a similar methodology, Pulvers 
et al14 reported the following median 
levels among exclusive e-cigarette 
users: CNEMA of 20.3 ng/mg of 
creatinine (versus 1.3 ng/mg in our 
sample), 3-HPMA of 370.3 ng/mg 
(versus 254.3 ng/mg), 2-HPMA of 
38.0 ng/mg (versus 28.8 ng/mg), 
AAMA of 96.5 ng/mg (versus 67.3 
ng/mg), and HMPMA of 251.6 ng/mg  
(versus 148.7 ng/mg). However, 
participants reported more frequent 
use of e-cigarettes in that study (ie, 
24.7 days in the past 30 days and 
an average of 11.8 times per day 
on use days), and exclusive use of 
e-cigarettes was based on self-report 
only, because this was a switching 
study in which NNAL levels would 
not have had time to decline to 
nonexposed levels. Thus, the increase 
in VOCs among adults might be 
reflective of greater exposure to 
e-cigarettes and/or combustion 
products. Moreover, unlike our study, 
none of the authors of these studies 
employed a control group to account 
for baseline levels of environmental 
VOCs.
nicotine
Not surprisingly, e-cigarette–only 
participants who reported using 
nicotine-containing products all or 
some of the time had significantly 
higher levels of cotinine compared 
with those who never used or 
were unsure if there was nicotine 
in their e-cigarettes. To the best 
of our knowledge, this is the first 
study to report cotinine levels in 
adolescent e-cigarette–only users. 
Among e-cigarette–only users, only 
the VOCs CNEMA and AAMA were 
higher in users of nicotine containing 
e-cigarettes. Levels of the 3 other 
significant and likely toxic VOCs were 
just as high in users of nonnicotine 
products as in those using nicotine. 
This is particularly important 
because many teenagers initiate 
e-cigarette use with nicotine-free 
products, 
4 in part because they feel 
that they are safer.29
type of Product
There were no significant differences 
found in levels of toxicants by type of 
product used. Despite a small number 
of subjects using each type of product, 
there was great variability among the 
3 main types of e-cigarette products 
used by our participants. Given the 
results of studies of emissions among 
adult users of e-cigarettes, which 
revealed significant differences by 
brand and type of product, 
25, 
 
30 
– 
32 the 
small numbers of users and variable 
use patterns among products may 
have limited our ability to detect small 
exposure-related differences among 
products.
Flavorings
There are researchers who suggests 
that certain flavorings may generate 
higher levels of toxic chemicals 
than others.32 
– 
35 Among our 
e-cigarette–only participants, the use 
of fruit-flavored products produced 
significantly higher levels of the 
metabolites of acrylonitrile. This is 
of particular interest to adolescent 
e-cigarette use, because 1 of the 
main reasons teenagers report using 
e-cigarettes is the appealing flavors.4 
Moreover, for various reasons, 
including the stigma associated with 
tobacco, some may also feel that the 
fruit-flavored products are safer than 
tobacco-flavored products. In fact, 
fruit flavors were the most popular 
choice among our e-cigarette users 
with roughly 55% of e-cigarette–only 
users and 67% of dual users reporting 
using fruit flavors most often.
In addition to being the first to 
report toxicant levels in the urine 
of adolescent e-cigarette users, we 
used strict criteria based on objective 
biomarkers to avoid secondary 
sources of VOCs by excluding 
participants with any evidence of 
exposure to combustion products 
from tobacco from our e-cigarette–
only group. Another strength of 
this study is the use of age-matched 
controls to account for the underlying 
rate of environmental exposures to 
8 toxicants. We did not specifically 
test for marijuana exposure, a task 
which is fraught with difficulty, given 
the limitations of the testing itself, 
which are due to the long half-life of 
δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.36, 
 
37 Despite 
this, our analyses revealed that it is 
unlikely that the variance in VOCs 
explained by our e-cigarette use group 
was accounted for by marijuana use 
instead of e-cigarette use.
Other limitations of this study 
include the fact that a wide range 
of e-cigarette products were used 
among participants, and thus, it may 
be difficult to pinpoint variability in 
toxicant exposure on the basis of the 
self-reported product used. However, 
this strengthens the external validity 
of the study because it gives a more 
real-world view of the toxicants 
found from the e-cigarette products 
commonly used by adolescents. We 
also only tested 8 likely toxic VOCs, 
but there may be other significant 
toxicants, including formaldehyde, 
which can be produced by 
e-cigarettes and which could pose a 
threat to adolescent users of these 
products; however, formaldehyde 
exposure is difficult to assess in 
vivo.25 Although the focus of this 
study was on e-cigarette–only users, 
we also had a relatively small number 
of confirmed (ie, using NNAL) dual 
users. Lastly, controls were on 
average more likely to be female and 
Hispanic compared with e-cigarette–
only and dual users. However, we do 
not feel that this played a role in our 
VOC findings because the analyses 
accounted for both sex and race and/
or ethnicity. There may be other 
factors that could have influenced 
VOC levels, but given the sample size, 
we limited the number of covariates 
we included in any analysis. Larger 
prospective studies are needed to 
confirm the findings reported here

cOnclusIOns
Although e-cigarette vapor may be 
less dangerous than combustible 
cigarettes, with lower overall 
exposure to VOC toxicants, with our 
findings, we challenge the idea that 
e-cigarette vapor is safe. Many of the 
VOCs we identified among e-cigarette 
users are carcinogenic, including 
propylene oxide, acrylamide, 
acrylonitrile, and crotonaldehyde.13 
With few exceptions, these toxicants 
were present whether the product 
contained nicotine or flavorings. 
Consequently, as with traditional 
cigarettes, messaging to teenagers 
must include warnings about the 
potential risk from toxic exposure to 
carcinogenic compounds generated 
by these products.
