Sepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection, has the highest burden of
death and medical expenses in hospitals worldwide. Leukocyte count and CD64 expression
on neutrophils (nCD64) are known to correlate strongly with improved sensitivity and
specificity of sepsis diagnosis at its onset. A major challenge is the lack of a rapid and
accurate point-of-care (PoC) device that can perform these measurements from a
minute blood sample. Here, we report a PoC microfluidic biochip to enumerate leukocytes
and quantify nCD64 levels from 10 ml of whole blood without any manual processing. Biochip
measurements have shown excellent correlation with the results from flow cytometer.
In clinical studies, we have used PoC biochip to monitor leukocyte counts and nCD64 levels
from patients’ blood at different times of their stay in the hospital. Furthermore, we have
shown the biochip’s utility for improved sepsis diagnosis by combining these measurements
with electronic medical record (EMR).

ntensive care units (ICUs) in the United States receive more
than 5 million patients annually1,2. Of these, severe sepsis
strikes more than 1 million people, or roughly 20% of all
ICU patients, with an overall cost of about $24 billion to the
healthcare system2. An estimated 28–50% of these people die
(280,000–500,000), a number which is greater than the number of
American deaths from prostate cancer, breast cancer and AIDS
combined3. A dominant factor underlying these grim numbers is
the lack of an accurate, rapid sepsis diagnostic methods at the
point of care (PoC)4. The current standard for diagnosis, termed
as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria,
is monitoring increased temperature, respiratory rate, PaCO2
levels in blood and abnormal total WBC count. This is followed
by a 1–3 day bacterial growth culture for the pathogen, followed
by nucleic acid identification. The diagnostic process takes longer
than the disease progression, thus leaving huge diagnostic gaps in
the treatment pathway5. Several promising biomarkers based
on inflammatory response have been reported, most notably
neutrophil cluster of differentiation (CD64)-positive cells, which
is a high-affinity biomarker that binds to immunoglobulin G. It is
normally expressed on monocytes but in cases of inflammation,
CD64 expression is upregulated rapidly on neutrophils6–8.
During infection or inflammation, an increase in the expression
of CD64 on neutrophils is stimulated by inflammatory cytokines.
The intensity of the cytokine stimulus is directly correlated
with the graded increase in the CD64 expression6,7. Many
meta-analysis studies have shown that, particularly when SIRS is
combined together with neutrophils’ CD64 þ cells, the accuracy,
sensitivity and specificity of sepsis diagnosis at early stages of
disease can be dramatically improved8–10. Diagnosing sepsis early
is extremely critical, as several innovative treatment strategies are
now available that can markedly increase chances of survival
if
applied
early
enough
in
the
appropriate
situations,
including antimicrobial therapies, and immune-stimulating and
immunosuppressive
therapies11–13.
The
72-h
survival
rate
decreases by roughly 7.7% every hour such that appropriate
antimicrobial medication is delayed at the onset of infection,
underscoring the need for early diagnosis techniques13.
Currently, haematology analyzers are being used for complete
blood cell counts and flow cytometers for specific leukocyte
counting. Antigen expression-based cell quantification is mainly
performed by a flow cytometer. However, these instruments have
yet to find widespread use in the PoC settings due to several
reasons. First, flow cytometry measurement suffers from a lack of
standardization. Reproducible protocols for sample preparation
including RBC lysis, cell staining, gating strategies and acquisition
protocols have proven difficult to be kept constant for multicentre
clinical studies14. Second, flow cytometry measurement and
haematology tests require both a well-equipped laboratory and
significant technical expertise, which are impossible to maintain
24/7 in ICUs.
Much effort has been placed in creating PoC microfluidic
biochip
solutions
for
clinical
diagnosis.
Towards
specific
leukocyte enumeration, many efforts have used fluorescent
tagging and subsequent image processing to automatically
enumerate
specific
leukocytes
in
microchambers15.
Some
designs relied on the even distribution of cells in a plastic
chamber to produce accurate counts16. Others have used a
microfabricated membrane to filter out erythrocytes and recover
the leukocytes, which were then fluorescently labelled17. Cheng
et al. have investigated CD4 þ T-cell capture by controlling shear
stresses at the chamber walls and enumerating cells using a
cocktail of fluorescently labelled antibodies18,19. They improved
their design by including a monocyte depletion chamber
to reduce the positive bias created at lower CD4 þ
T-cell
concentrations20. The aforementioned optical methods require
the use of lenses and focusing to analyse samples, but this can
increase the cost and decrease the portability of the device. Wang
et al. further simplified the optics by not requiring an external
light source: immobilized cells were labelled with CD3-conjugated
horseradish peroxidase to facilitate a chemiluminescent reaction,
which was amplified and quantified by a photodetector21. An
electrical PoC solution would require only solid-state components
to electrically interrogate a sensing geometry, process sensor
output and provide input from and results to the user. Recent
advancements have used the Coulter principle to electrically
analyse individual cells within a population22. Adams et al.
enumerated low concentrations of circulating tumour cells in
whole blood samples after specifically capturing and releasing
those cells23. Holmes et al. have used impedance analysis at
multiple frequencies as a label-free method to differentiate
between different leukocyte subsets, and were able to further
enhance electrical differentiation by specifically attaching latex
beads to the desired cells24,25. Our group has previously
developed a microfluidic biochip capable of performing blood
cell counts from a drop of whole blood without any manual
processing26. The electrical sensors are designed to count
individual cells using the coulter principle, where the passage of
a cell perturbs the electrical current within an orifice, creating a
distinct impedance pulse26–28. The biochip has shown good
correlations in clinical studies when its cell counts were compared
to the cell counts from haematology analyzers. We have also
developed a microfabricated AC impedance analysis system for
the electrical counting of specific leukocytes; in particular, we
have enumerated CD4 þ and CD8 þ T cells in a microfluidic
biochip by selective lymphocyte capture based on immunoaffinity
and differential lymphocyte counting29,30.
To date, very little work has been done to develop microfluidic
devices to quantify the cell surface antigen expression levels.
Murthy et al. reported tandem, spiral-shaped microfluidic devices
to separate human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human
microvascular endothelial cells based on different expressions of
common antigen CD31 (ref. 31). They were able to achieve high
purity of 80% for human umbilical vein endothelial cells and 97%
for human microvascular endothelial cells, but did not validate
their study with actual blood samples31. More recently, Pappas
et al. have also developed microfluidic chips with a herringbone
structure, and they have shown that the capture ratio of Ramos B
lymphocytes and HuT 78 T lymphocytes matched the expression
ratio of CD71 for the two cell lines after spiking in the blood
samples32. However, to date there have been no reports of
quantifying the expression level of antigens at the point of care on
specific leukocytes like CD64 neutrophils from a minute volume
of whole blood. None of the above-mentioned studies have the
capability to perform PoC analysis from whole blood without the
need for off-chip sample processing to quantify the expression
level of the antigen on the cell’s surface.
In this study, we have used our differential immunoaffinity
capture technology to electrically quantify antigen expression
level on the CD64 þ cells. In particular, we have quantified CD64
expression levels on granulocytes þ monocytes population by
their selective capture in the biochip. We have performed clinical
studies of the biochip at Carle Foundation Hospital, Urbana, IL,
using blood samples collected from the patients who are
SIRS-positive and/or their blood culture is ordered by the
physicians at the time of their admission.

 based on the capture of CD64 þ cells using our differential
cell-counting
immunocapture
technology.
The
overview
of
the experimental assay for the differential expression-based
cell-counting technology is shown in Fig. 1a. The image of the
biochip with individual interconnected modules is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 1. Whole blood (10 ml) is infused into
the biochip at inlet ‘a’ along with lysing buffer at inlet ‘b’, to
preferentially lyse erythrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 2). Formic
acid in the lysing buffer creates the hypotonic extracellular
environment for effective erythrocyte lysis, while saponin in the
lysing buffer further helps to dissociate the erythrocyte debris
clumps. The lysing process is halted by infusing quenching
solution at inlet ‘c’ as the isotonic extracellular environment is
achieved. Cells are electrically counted based on their size using
microfabricated electrodes at the entrance counter. The design of
the electrical counter with top and side views is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 3. The anti-CD64 (clone 10.1) antibody is
initially adsorbed in the cell capture chamber (Immobilization
protocol in Methods section). The CD64 þ cells are captured
based on the CD64 expression level on their surfaces. The
remaining cells are counted once more by the second electrical
counter. The difference in the cell counts linearly correlates
with the CD64 expression level on the cells. Electrodes are fed
with 303 kHz and 5 V signal, as the cells flow through the
counting aperture of 30 mm � 15 mm, and the resulting increase in
the impedance is translated to voltage using a simple bridge
circuit (Supplementary Fig. 4). A voltage pulse is produced with
each passage of the cell through the counting aperture, with pulse
amplitude representing the size of the cell. The cell pulses data are
further digitally filtered to remove any unwanted noise and
baseline drifts (Supplementary Fig. 5). Lymphocytes (6–10 mm)
being smaller in size produce smaller pulses as compared to
granulocytes/monocytes (11–15 mm) (Supplementary Fig. 6). The
resulting histogram of peak pulse voltages is shown in Fig. 1b,
showing lymphocytes and granulocytes þ monocytes as two
distinct populations. The pulse area histogram obtained by
considering pulse amplitude and pulse width is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 7. As can be noted, the lymphocytes
and granulocytes þ monocytes populations are not distinct.
Especially, the lymphocytes’ population is merging with the noise,
which can be attributed to much smaller pulse width of
lymphocytes as compared to that of granulocytes þ monocytes.
We varied the flow rates from 10 to 30 ml min � 1 and measured the
baseline noise (three times of the standard deviation of noise when
no cell is flowing) of the cell-counting system, which increases with
increased flow rates (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Furthermore, we also
measured the pulse width of lymphocytes and granulocytes þ
monocytes population (Supplementary Fig. 8b). The pulse width at
higher flow rates is smaller and also has higher standard deviation,
making corresponding cell populations hard to distinguish in area
histograms. In clinical studies, we measured biochip total leukocyte
count and compared it to control leukocyte count obtained from a
haematology analyser at Carle Foundation Hospital, Urbana. We
found a correlation coefficient R2 ¼ 0.89 for 181 patient blood
samples (Fig. 1c). We also compared the total granulocytes þ
monocytes counts from biochip versus control counts obtained
from a haematology analyzer and found a high correlation
coefficient of (R2 ¼ 0.88) (Fig. 1d).
Clinical validation of nCD64 for sepsis stratification. We also
developed a CD64 expression quantification protocol on a flow
cytometer to be used as control against our biochip (Methods
Section). The stepwise protocol and flow cytometry analysis is
shown in Supplementary Fig. 9. Supplementary Table 1 shows
the dynamic range, average and standard deviation values of
key parameters (leukocytes, lymphocytes and granulocytes þ
monocytes) on our targeted patient population. We have
measured nCD64 expression values for n ¼ 450 patient blood
samples. The CD64 expression histograms for monocytes,

 neutrophils and lymphocytes are shown in Fig. 2a. The
inset histogram represents neutrophil CD64 expression. The
increase
in
nCD64
is
a
result
of
neutrophil
activation
during proinflammatory response from an infection. We also
investigated the increase in the monocyte CD64 (mCD64)
expression comparable to neutrophil CD64 expression. The plot
shown in Fig. 2b represents the ratio of mCD64:nCD64 versus
nCD64. Increase in the monocyte CD64 expression as compared
to nCD64 increases linearly with the increase in mCD64
expression. However, the increase in the nCD64 expression as
compared to mCD64 expression is uncorrelated with the increase
in the nCD64 expression in disease states.
We used the parameters to be measured by the biochip
combined with electronic medical record (EMR) data as input
features into a support vector machine (SVM) model to predict
the onset of sepsis for our patient population (septic ¼ 76 and
non-septic ¼ 368). Supplementary Table 2 shows the patient
characteristics including age, gender, chronic conditions and
common infections with respect to septic and non-septic cohorts
in our patient population. Figure 2c shows receiver operating
curves (ROC) with area under curve (AUC) for predicting sepsis
using a subset of the SIRS criteria parameters (AUC ¼ 0.70), and
all the SIRS criteria parameters plus lactic acid combined with
biochip parameters (AUC ¼ 0.77). The subset of SIRS criteria
parameters chosen (which we refer to as ‘Quick SIRS’) includes
the SIRS parameters whose measurements can be outputted
instantaneously. When the biochip measureable parameters are
combined with the Quick SIRS criteria and lactic acid, the AUC
increases from 0.70 to 0.77. To assess the importance of the
SIRS criteria and biochip parameters, we report the weight
vector coefficients outputted by SVM. The resulting output
coefficients by the model are given in Supplementary Fig. 10.
Granulocytes þ monocytes, white blood cell count, nCD64 and
pulse were determined to be the four most important parameters
in descending order. As three of these can be determined by our
biochip, these results indicate that the biochip enables significant
predictive power as compared to only measuring the Quick SIRS
parameters (AUC ¼ 0.70) in a short timeframe. However, in this
same timeframe, the biochip will allow a clinician to measure
other parameters (nCD64 and blood cell counts) that can
improve the accuracy in diagnosing sepsis (AUC ¼ 0.77). Since
diagnosing sepsis is time-sensitive, a device quickly providing the
measurements of parameters would be very useful.
In a second study, using the data collected on the patients, we
also investigated the role of nCD64 and total leukocyte counts in
septic patients’ prognosis, in particular, predicting their outcome,
that is, recovery versus non-recovery. Figure 2d shows the box
plots for the nCD64 expression value from 316 blood samples
collected from 68 patients at different times of their hospital stay.
All of these patients recovered as also indicated by the increase
and then subsequent decrease in the nCD64 expression value.
Figure 2e shows the box plots for the control nCD64 expression
value from 94 blood samples collected from six patients at
different times of their hospital stay. Unfortunately, these patients
did not recover and lost their lives. Their nCD64 value again
increased from TW5 to TW6. We think that nCD64 can be
an indicative biomarker for the recovery outcome, thereby
emphasizing continuous nCD64 monitoring at different times
throughout the individual patient hospital stay. Supplementary
Figs 11 and 12 show the box plots for total leukocytes’ counts and
normalized ratio of nCD64 to WBC for both recovered and
non-recovered patients. To investigate which time windows have
high predictability for the sepsis prognosis, we developed an
artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the recovery of

Non-specific cell capture in a blocked chamber. We designed
the capture chamber to ensure that the cells experience maximum
time interacting with the pillars, where antibodies are adsorbed
and different-sized cells should experience the same amount of
interaction time in the chamber. Furthermore, cell capture in the
zero-velocity or stagnation regions around the pillars is minimum
(Design details in Methods section). The first step in the
expression-based cell capture investigation is to ensure the
minimal non-specific cell capture in the blocked chambers with
no immobilized antibody. To investigate this, we blocked the
chambers with PBS þ 1% BSA (protocol in Methods section)
and find the cells captured by labelling them with fluorescent
antibodies and counting by flow cytometer. Supplementary
Fig. 16 shows the non-specific capture of cells in a blocked
chamber. In Supplementary Fig. 16a, using a representative high

 nCD64 ¼ 2.43), the non-specific capture of monocytes is minimal
as shown with inset CD64 histograms of monocytes entrance,
that is, before capture (Blue) and exit, that is, after capture (Red).
The red and blue curves show the exit and the entrance
normalized percent monocyte count versus mCD64 expression,
with green bars representing difference of entrance minus exit cell
counts. The slight difference in blue and red curves represents the
minimal capture of o2% cells, with highest CD64 expressing cells
getting non-specifically attached to the pillars. Presence of more
antigens on the cells’ surface will result in increased probability of
cells getting non-specifically captured. Similarly, Supplementary
Fig. 16b shows the non-specific capture of neutrophils of Sample
A in the same blocked chamber. The non-specific capture is
minimalo5%, mainly of highest expressing CD64 cells. We
selected another blood sample ‘B’ with comparably lower CD64
expression values (mCD64 ¼ 3.9, nCD64 ¼ 1.08) and performed
the non-specific cell capture analysis in a blocked chamber.
Supplementary Fig. 16c shows the non-specific capture of
monocytes of Sample B in a blocked chamber. The non-specific
capture is minimal o5%, and of highest expressing CD64 cells.
Similarly, Supplementary Fig. 16d shows the non-specific capture
of neutrophils of Sample B in the same blocked chamber.

is
also
shown
in
Supplementary Fig. 17a,c respectively. For another sample C, with
low nCD64 value of 0.4, the non-specific capture is minimal as
shown in Supplementary Fig. 18a.
We investigated the non-specific cell loss in a blocked chamber
using our electrical differential biochip too. Supplementary
Fig. 19a shows the representative amplitude histogram of the
cell pulses from the entrance counter (green) and exit counter
(red). The recovery of the total leukocytes is 98% representing
only 2% loss of cells in the capture chamber. We also compared
both chamber designs using our biochip as well. We ran blood
samples on the chip using the blocked chamber with n ¼ 35 blood
samples at different flow rates and compared exit versus entrance
total leukocyte counts (Supplementary Fig. 19b). Results show
that the cell recovery is 98% with 2% loss in the chamber with
R2 ¼ 0.99. When the exit versus entrance total granulocyte þ
monocyte counts were compared, we found the recovery of 93%
with 7% loss of cells in chamber with R2 ¼ 0.99 (Supplementary
Fig. 19c). However, the exit versus entrance total lymphocyte
counts
show
the
recovery
of
127%
with
R2 ¼ 0.90
in
Supplementary Fig. 19d. The increase in the exit lymphocyte

CD64 expression-based cell capture in an antibody chamber.
Before investigating the cell capture, we characterized the
chamber to ensure the antibody adsorption in the chamber
around the pillars. Figure 3a shows the antibody adsorption
characterization
of
the
capture
chamber.
PE-conjugated
anti-CD64 antibody is adsorbed in the chamber (antibody
adsorption protocol is given in Methods section) and is imaged
under fluorescence microscope to detect presence of adsorbed
antibody. As a control, a BSA blocked chamber is also imaged
and it shows no fluorescence and PE-conjugated anti-CD64
antibody filled chamber shows high fluorescence. After the
unadsorbed antibody is flushed away using 1 � PBS, the chamber
is imaged again and shows white circular patterns at the
periphery of the pillars showing the adsorbed antibody. Figure 3a
also shows the fluorescence intensity along the A–B line for three
pillars as shown. The peaks intensity represents the white regions
around pillars’ periphery and valleys represent the pillars.
Figure 3b,c shows the CD64 expression-based capture of cells
using a representative high CD64 expressing blood sample ‘A’
with mCD64 ¼ 6.03, nCD64 ¼ 2.43. In Fig. 3b, the capture of
monocytes is maximum as shown by the inset CD64 histograms
of monocytes’ entrance, that is, before capture (Blue) and exit,
that is, after capture (Red). The positive green bars show that the
low CD64 expressing cells are the majority of the exit CD64
monocyte population, while most of the high CD64 monocytes
got captured. Presence of more antigens of the cells’ surface will
result in increased probability of cells getting captured. Similarly,
Fig. 3c shows the CD64 expression-based capture of neutrophils
of sample A in the same antibody chamber. For neutrophil
population, high expressing CD64 cells got captured while low
expressing CD64 did not. We did the same study using the
blood sample ‘B’ with comparably lower CD64 expression
values (mCD64 ¼ 3.9, nCD64 ¼ 1.08). Figure 3d shows the CD64
expression-based capture of monocytes of sample B in the capture
chamber, with inset CD64 histograms representing the maximum
capture of cells. Similarly, CD64 expression-based capture of
neutrophils of sample B is shown in Fig. 3e, with inset CD64
histograms showing less CD64 cell capture owing to the lower
nCD64 value. However, the cells which were captured have high
CD64 expressions. Supplementary Fig. 17b,d shows the selective
capture of CD64 granulocytes þ monocytes as a combined
population from samples A and B, respectively. CD64 expression-
based capture of granulocytes using sample C with nCD64 value
of 0.4 shows the minimal capture in Supplementary Fig. 18b.
Furthermore, we have done the CD64 expression-based cell cap-
ture study using a flow cytometer on 25 patient blood samples
(Supplementary Fig. 20). The detailed experimental protocol
included off-chip blood lysing and quenching, then flowing cells
through blocked and antibody chamber in parallel. The exit cells
from both chambers are labelled with fluorescent antibodies; then
samples are incubated in the dark for 20 min with subsequent flow
through
the
flow
cytometer.
The
cells
are
counted
from
blocked (B) and antibody chambers (A). The cell capture is
defined as (A–B). B � 1, normalized to the blocked chamber
(Supplementary Fig. 20a). The average differential cell capture
(from three replicates) versus nCD64 ratio (n ¼ 25 samples) shows
a linear correlation of nCD64 expression with increase in the cell
capture (Supplementary Fig. 20b). Supplementary Fig. 20c shows
the nCD64 expression value based on cell capture (obtained using
threefold cross-validation with 500 random trials) versus normal-
ized nCD64 ratio. In Supplementary Note 1, we have also pre-
sented a brief theoretical model outlining the direct relationship of
increase in antigen density (expression level) on the cell’s surface
with increased probability of cell capture33–35.
Clinical study of biochip for CD64 expression quantification.
We investigated the CD64 expression-based cell capture in
an antibody-adsorbed chamber using our electrical differential
biochip too. We ran n ¼ 102 blood samples collected from
patients admitted to Carle Hospital, Urbana and counted their
granulocyte þ monocyte counts in entrance and exit counters of
the biochip. The representative amplitude histogram of the cell
pulses from the entrance counter (green) and exit counter (red) is
shown in Fig. 3f. The lymphocytes did not get captured; however,
almost 50% of granulocytes þ monocytes got captured in the
chamber. The chamber is collected after the end of experiment,
and captured cells are labelled with anti-CD64 fluorescent
antibody. After washing away the unadsorbed antibody, the
chamber is imaged under fluorescent microscope. Figure 3g
shows the false-coloured fluorescent image showing the captured
CD64 cells around the pillars. We ran 102 blood samples on our
biochip and compared the percent granulocytes þ monocytes

 capture versus nCD64 expression ratio (Fig. 3h). The plot shows a
linear correlation between them (R2 ¼ 0.87), suggesting an
increase in capture as the CD64 expression is increased.
Bins of 0.25 nCD64 size are created and the percent captured
granulocytes þ monocytes is averaged of all the samples in the
respective bins and plotted against corresponding bin size
(Fig. 3i). The plot shows a high correlation (R2 ¼ 0.96) and linear
increase in percent cell capture with increase in CD64 expression
on neutrophils. The green bars of secondary y axis represent the
number of samples in each bin. In precision study, we run
multiple experiments using the same samples; the results are
shown in Supplementary Fig. 21.
Patients’ stratification and time-course measurements. The
differential capture of granulocytes þ monocytes linearly relates
with the nCD64 expression ratio. To obtain the nCD64 value
from the biochip, we performed threefold cross-validation with
1,000 times random sample selection on the percent granulocytes
þ monocytes capture versus control nCD64 expression values
(data from Fig. 3h). The comparison plot in between nCD64
value obtained from biochip versus flow cytometry shows the
good linear correlation of R2 ¼ 0.87 in Fig. 4a. The Bland–Altman
analysis shows a high correlation with � 0.0002 average differ-
ence of nCD64 value in between biochip and flow cytometer
(control) and 0.49 value as limits of agreement (Fig. 4b). ROC
curves in Fig. 4c show the high predictability accuracy for all the
three CD64 bins used for predicting sepsis diagnosis (Fig. 2h).
AUC for Bins 1, 2 and 3 are 0.98, 0.85 and 0.9, respectively,
showing the high predictability accuracy for all the bins. We also
calculated the prediction accuracy of nCD64 value from biochip,
and we have found that biochip can predict the nCD64 value with
greater than 85% accuracy for the minimum nCD64 bin size of
0.6 (Fig. 4d). This corresponds to ten bins when the entire nCD64
range is divided equally. The box plots show the nCD64
expression value obtained from biochip from 91 blood samples

These patients got recovered as also indicated by the increase and
then decrease in the nCD64 expression value (Fig. 4e). The box
plots showing the total leukocyte counts obtained from biochip
are obtained from the same samples. Total leukocyte counts of
these patients reached a value of B5,000 cells per ml in TW6
comparable to a healthy individual (Fig. 4f). The box plots
showing the normalized ratio of nCD64 to WBC obtained from
biochip are shown in Supplementary Fig. 22. The nCD64 value
and total WBC counts obtained from biochip from all 91 blood
samples are plotted in Fig. 4g against different sample collection
times during the patient stay in the hospital. Total leukocyte
count and nCD64 value of the patients are tracked over time.
Patients recovered; for example, Patient A has very low WBC
count (B1,000 cells per ml) and very high nCD64 value (2.6)
at TW1; however, by TW6 their WBC counts became normal
(B5,000 cells per ml) and nCD64 value reduced to o1 (Fig. 4h).
The biochip is also capable of diagnosing leukocytosis and
neutrophilia from the blood samples of patients. ROC curves
showing high sensitivity and specificity of leukocytosis and
neutrophilia diagnosis from the biochip are shown in Fig. 4i. Cell
threshold values and the sensitivity and specificity values are also
shown in the inset table of Fig. 4i.
Discussion
The increase in the CD64 expression is activated by either
pro-inflammatory cytokines’ interferon gamma (IFN-g) or also
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor that are produced in
response to the pathogen infection or exposure to endotoxin36.
The increase in the CD64 expression on neutrophils in septic
cases is higher and more specific than other inflammations like
autoimmune diseases. Allen et al. showed a twofold increase in
the median CD64 expression in patients with inflammatory
autoimmune disease as compared to control patients37. However,
increase in the CD64 expression in the patients with systemic
infections was almost seven times higher than that in the control
group37. Furthermore, neutrophil CD64 expression may also
increase after major trauma38 and sterile insult after major
surgery39. Neutrophil activation has also been reported to
increase
in
burn
and
trauma
patients
and
many
have
investigated their utility to migrate towards infections40,41.
Similarly, changes in the nCD64 expression have also been
reported in patients with postoperative infections who are
undergoing vascular42, cardiac43 or musculoskeletal surgeries44.
Some other diseases like inflammatory bowel disease45 and
familial Mediterranean fever46 have also reported neutrophil
activation and have shown changes in the expression level of
nCD64.
nCD64 has also been reported to distinguish between bacterial
versus viral infections, with higher changes in expression in
patients with bacterial infections47. Another study has reported
to combine nCD64 and expressions of CD35 biomarkers and
were able to distinguish between bacterial, viral and other
inflammatory diseases48. Furthermore, changes in the expression
level are mostly age independent. There are numerous studies
that have been conducted investigating the utility of nCD64
as biomarker for sepsis detection in neonates and infants.
A meta-analysis8–10 investigating nCD64 utility as a biomarker
has shown the sepsis detection cutoff values of nCD64 to be
independent of neonates, infants and adults. The increase/
decrease in expression can be related to microbe or severity of
infection and not to age or gender.
The pathogenic infection that results in pro-inflammatory
response and activates CD64 expression on neutrophils also
results in activating a few other biomarkers including neutrophil
CD11b cells, mHLA-DR on monocytes and certain specific
lymphocyte populations (CD4 þ and CD25 þ )49–52. Although
just combining CD64 with the current stratification technique,
that is, SIRS þ and suspect or proof of infection, improves the
septic predictability as shown by our current work (Fig. 2) and
also by numerous studies done previously, we believe that when
CD64 is combined with other mentioned biomarkers, we can
further improve the accuracy in diagnosing sepsis. Although this
work has been focussed on quantifying nCD64 expression on
chip, our work can easily be translated to quantify any other
cellular antigen expression levels.
There are a very few studies reported that used nCD64 as a
prognosis tool for septic patients, because of the inherent
difficulty of performing nCD64 quantification assay using a flow
cytometer for the length of the patient’s stay. Furthermore, the
available studies were only able to do nCD64 assay once a day.
For example, Dimoula et al. performed serial CD64 measure-
ments daily on septic patients undergoing different antibiotic
treatments, and they have shown the correlation of decrease in
CD64 expression with the appropriate antibiotic treatment7.
Our microfluidic biochip provided a unique ability to perform the
time
course
and
rapid
blood
cell
counts
and
nCD64
measurements over the length of patients’ stay especially during
the different time windows.
Our improvement in AUC from 0.70 to 0.77 is statistically
significant as indicated by the p value (o0.001) reported in the
Methods section. Much of the previous studies were done in very
restricted settings like ICU, where the patients have already
confirmed bacterial infections, and so on. However, in our study,
we started with a very diversified and heterogeneous patient
population having several different infections, and were able to
see the statistical improvement in prediction of sepsis. However, a
complete random and blinded patient recruitment criteria
without any prior sample stratification would be an ideal
benchmark for the utilization of our biochip in sepsis prediction.
Developing a PoC system for early stratification of sepsis will
have a significant impact on patients and hospitals as delay in
the early diagnosis of sepsis can have multiple drawbacks. For
example, with the suspicion of infection, physicians usually
recommend broad-range antibiotic treatments. Furthermore,
inappropriate use of antibiotics, if sepsis and/or infection is not
diagnosed, is harmful for the patients as it will interfere with the
patient’s normal microbiota, and potentially develop anti-
microbial resistance to drugs40. An early sepsis stratification
system could lead both to improved screening techniques and
more therapeutic options and potentially drastically reduce
lengthy stays in critical care units, priced at 4$20,000 per stay
on average for septic patients in the US53. Furthermore, as the
‘Pay for Performance’ initiative is implemented in hospitals across
the United States, their reimbursement is based on showing
steady improvement over time in critical statistics including
lengths of stay, mortality rates, rates of hospital-acquired
infections and many others. Sepsis has been identified as a
Core Measure because better adherence to standardized sepsis
guidelines has been shown to drastically improve all of these
critical parameters. Therefore, we believe that a more specific and
sensitive method to perform accurate stratification of sepsis will
not only improve patient outcomes but will be a critical part of
the financial survival of hospitals across the United States.
Our CD64 quantification biochip can easily be adapted for
other applications. Changes in the expression level of cellular
antigens play a critical role in pathogenesis and inflammation,
and they can be investigated by clinical studies. The different type
and level of antigen expression is helpful for disease diagnosis and
monitoring its progression, and can be used for phenotypic
cellular measurements. We can easily translate our biochip for
other applications including quantifying the CYP1A1 and

 CYP1B1 expressions in human endothelial cells to understand
their role in pro- or anti-atherogenic endothelial cell functions54.
In meningiomas, increased expression of Ki67 is a predictor
of not only high-grade malignancy but also recurrence in gross-
totally removed benign meningiomas55. Another example is
expression of CD71, the transferrin receptor, in identifying CTCs
activated during tumorigenesis. CD71 is associated with cell
growth regulation and iron uptake and is expressed on low levels
in resting cells, whose expression increased on proliferating
cells56.
CD64 expression is a proinflammatory biomarker at the onset
of infection. Therefore, a quick PoC testing (different settings like
bed-side, or emergency for trauma and/or injured patients) can
have an important clinical impact in evaluating the immune
system of the patients at the onset of their infection. Currently,
available benchtop flow cytometers with reduced complexity, for
example, by companies like CytoBuoy and Cronus Technologies,
as well as by larger companies such as Sysmex and Abbott,
still require traditional flow cytometry sample preparation to be
performed in a microbiology lab before the sample can be
introduced to the device. Any blood diagnostic test process flow
in the hospitals is prolonged, starting with physician placing a
blood test order, phlebotomist coming to the patient room,
drawing blood and sending it to flow lab for later processing. And
during this time, the diagnostic window of opportunity can
potentially be missed. Here, we believe that our PoC system can
have a clinical impact that it will bypass the entire current process
flow and provide the testing with immediate availability of results
within a matter of minutes to the physicians.
Our current CD64 expression quantification experimental
assay takes about 30 min to complete. This time can be greatly
reduced by increasing flow rate and making some geometry
changes in the biochip (Supplementary Table 4). By changing the
geometry (height and width) of the capture chamber, we can
keep the similar shear stress conditions for antigen–antibody
interactions on the pillars surfaces. The detailed description on
flow rate characterization and its effects on sensitivity of the
counter and throughput and the required blood volume are given
in Supplementary Notes 2 and 3.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a robust design of a
biochip for potential stratification of sepsis in patient population
at Carle Hospital. We have shown a point-of-care experimental
assay to quantify CD64 antigen expression and leukocyte count
from whole blood without the need of any manual sample
processing. We have validated our PoC biochip by measuring cell
counts (n ¼ 181) and nCD64 levels (n ¼ 102) from 10 ml of
patients’ blood samples and have shown excellent correlation
with flow cytometer. The targeted patient population is very
diverse with respect to cell counts (dynamic range: 530–38,570
leukocytes per ml) and antigen expression levels, and our biochip
shows excellent measurement accuracy for the entire dynamic
range of these parameters. Furthermore, we have shown the
biochip’s utility for sepsis diagnosis and prognosis by performing
these measurements on patients’ blood samples collected at
different times of their stay at hospital. In future, this biochip can
potentially be used at the patient’s bedside for continuous
monitoring of patient’s immune system in response to different
therapeutic interventions at different stages of the disease.
Methods
Chamber immobilization protocols. Blocked chamber. 1% BSA in 1 � PBS is
used as a blocking solution. Capture chamber is filled with the blocking solution
at the flow rate of 30 ml min � 1 and then it is let to be adsorbed for a minimum
of 30 min.
Antibody chamber. A stock solution of anti-CD64 antibody is made with
0.5 g l � 1 by mixing 500 mg of lyophilized antibody with 1 � PBS and storing it at
4 �C. For each chamber preparation, antibody solution is prepared by diluting the
stock solution with 1 � PBS at a concentration ratio of 0.23, that is, stock solution:
PBS (v/v). Chamber is filled with this solution and let it sit for 30 min, and
procedure is repeated again; this allowed sufficient time for antibody adsorption.
Unadsorbed antibody is then flushed away using 1 � PBS flowed at 10 ml min � 1.
Antibody adsorbed chamber is then filled with blocking solution with a subsequent
wait time of 30 min before using the chamber in the experiment.
Reagents. Lysing solution. The composition of lysing solution is 0.12% Formic
acid (v/v) and 0.05% Saponin (w/v) in DI water.
Quenching solution: The composition of quenching solution is 21.1785% 10 �
PBS (v/v) and 0.57525% sodium carbonate (w/v) in DI water.
Antibodies.
Unconjugated anti-human CD64 antibody (Clone: 10.1, Cat:
MAB1257-100, R&D Systems) and PE anti-human CD64 antibody (Clone: 10.1,
Cat: 305008, BioLegend) are used.
Biochip fabrication protocols. Fluidics layers fabrication: The master mould
(negative) of the fluidics regions of the biochip including lying module, counter
module and capture chamber was created by a standard SU8-photolithography
process using SU8-50 negative photoresist on Si wafer. The heights of the counters
module, lysing/quenching region and capture chamber were 15, 90 and 60 mm,
respectively. The surface of the mould was silanized by 3-mercaptopropyl-
trimethoxysilane. The actual biochip was made out of polydimethylsiloxane, in
which elastomer is mixed with curing agent at the ratio of 10:1 with subsequent
pouring on the master mould. After removing all bubbles using desiccator, it is
cured at 90 �C for 30–60 min. Electrodes’ fabrication: The Pyrex wafer is patterned
using LOR3A and S-1805 photoresists to make a negative pattern of the electrodes.
CD-26 developer is used to develop the wafer. Titanium (25 nm) (adhesion layer)
and 75 nm of platinum (metal layer) are evaporated onto the wafer. Microchem PG
remover is used to remove unwanted metal from the wafer for 20 min at 70 �C
treatment30.
We tested each counter for quality control before using in the experiment. Test
of the counter includes testing for any shorts after applying the conductive epoxy
and also measuring resistance from the electrode to the PCB lines. We have used
o5 Ohms resistance in between the electrode and PCB connecting lines as a
control parameter.
Experimental setup and instrumentation. The input buffers (lysing solution,
quenching solution and 1 � PBS as push buffer for blood) are infused into the
biochip using an Eksigent Nanoflow LC pump. Ten microlitres of blood is metered
in a 0.012 inch inner diameter PTFE tubing and placed into the blood input of the
biochip. Blood, lysing and quenching buffers are infused at 0.518, 6.218 and
3.264 ml min � 1, respectively. Blood: lysing ratio is 1:12 and blood: quenching ratio
is 1:6.3. Total on-chip lysis time is 6.1 s and lysed blood is quenched for 38.24 s.
Zurich Instruments HF2LI lock-in amplifier is used to provide the signal input to
the electrodes (303 kHz, 5Vp-p) to both counters. The output voltage signals from
the electrical counters are fed to the differential preamplifier HF2CA, which in turn
are fed to the HF2LI for further noise removal. The differential signal was obtained
using a built-in module of the lock-in amplifier HF2LI (Supplementary Fig. 4).
DAQ card (PCI-6351, National Instruments) is used to acquire the output signal
from lock-in amplifier and data is stored into the computer at the sampling rate of
250 kHz. Data analysis including pulse detection and cell counting was done using
a customized program written in Matlab. The electrical counter needs to detect the
particles of different sizes flowing through it. The pulse amplitude histogram of the
5.5 and 7 mm beads flowing through the electrical counter is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 23, showing that the counter is sensitive enough to differentiate
between these two bead populations.
Electrical cell-counting analysis. The acquired data from the experiment were
analysed in a customized program written in Matlab. As the cell passes through
the aperture, it generates the voltage pulses, which were samples at 250 kHz.
The cell-counting data are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a before performing
any digital filtering. The low-frequency noise including the baseline drifts were
removed using the high-pass filter with a 20 Hz cutoff frequency. Power line
interference of 60 Hz and its first harmonic (120 Hz) are removed by using two
band stop filters with cutoff frequencies of (58, 62) Hz and (118, 122) Hz,
respectively. The input frequency noise of 303 kHz was removed by using a
low-pass filter with 303 kHz as a cutoff frequency. The data after performing the
digital filtering is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5b. The maximum amplitudes of all
the voltage pulses are obtained by comparing with a threshold level of 0.5 V, which
is approximately 10 � standard deviation of baseline noise. The thresholding in
between lymphocytes and granulocytes þ monocytes is done considering minima
in between two respective populations.
Supplementary Fig. 24 compares the electrical signals obtained as cell, and
possibly micro debris particle (generated due to the lysis of red blood cells) passes
through the electrical counter. The figure shows the representative electrical voltage
signal of a cell passing through the counter and the dotted rectangular region,
which is zoomed-in to show the signal possibly related to the microdebris particles
flowing through the counter channel. Furthermore, pulse width is calculated by

 measuring the number of samples in the dotted region and then multiplying it by
sampling time as shown in Supplementary Fig. 25.
Blood sample acquisition. Clinical studies of the biochip were done at Carle
Hospital, Urbana, IL. Blood samples were obtained from the anonymous patients
who are SIRS-positive and/or their blood culture is ordered by a physician with
suspicion of an infection. The left-over blood samples from patients after
laboratory tests were de-identified by the clinical lab staff and sent to us. Samples
were collected until their discharge from the hospital (recovery or death) at
different possible time intervals through an authorized University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign and Carle Foundation Hospital Institutional Review Board
(IRB) applications (UIUC IRB number 15500 and Carle IRB number 15014). EMR
data not considered protected health information (PHI) for patients who were
discharged or deceased were retrieved by an authorized personnel and made
available to the PI with approved de-identification protocol. According to the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and Carle Foundation Hos-
pital’s IRB guidelines, patients were not informed of the diagnostic results from our
device or from the flow cytometry controls. Blood samples were collected in
vacutainers coated with EDTA and are kept on a rotisserie at room temperature.
Experiments are conducted within 12 h of blood samples’ availability.
CD64 control expression protocol. The stepwise blood-processing protocol is
shown in Supplementary Fig. 9a. Eight microlitres of whole blood is lysed with
96 ml of lysing reagent for 6s. Further 50.4 ml of quenching reagent is mixed
with the lysed blood. Eight microlitres of cocktail of conjugated antibodies
(FITC anti-CD64 and PE anti-CD163 from Trillium Diagnostics kit) is added to
the solution. The sample is incubated for 20 min. Finally, 5 ml of FITC-conjugated
control beads was added to the solution, serving as an internal control.
Supplementary Fig. 9b (left) shows the forward and backscatter plot of a sample
obtained after running the sample on a flow cytometer. There is a clear differ-
entiation between total white blood cells, debris and the control beads. The WBC
and the bead populations were gated and represented by gates R1 and R5,
respectively. Supplementary Fig. 9b (middle) shows the scatter plot of the 575 (PE)
and backscatter channels. The expression of CD163 on the PE channel was used to
differentiate between monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils by their respective
gates. The histogram of the cell populations is obtained on the FITC (530) channel
representing the CD64 fluorescence intensity. Mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) is
obtained for monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils. CD64 FITC-conjugated
beads in the sample serve as an internal control and the MFI of the beads is used to
normalize MFI of the leukocyte subpopulations. Supplementary Fig. 9c (right)
shows the CD64 FITC histogram of monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes on
the 530 channel of the flow cytometer.
Guava EasyCyte Plus flow cytometer was used for all the CD64 control
measurements. Guava was calibrated daily before performing any control assay
using a standardized manufacturer protocol (ensuring that coefficient of variation
of control beads counts and their fluorescence measurements is o5%). A 96-well
plate is used to perform CD64 measurements on multiple samples at once. The
gating on the scatter plots for differentiating cell populations is done by FCS
Express software or using our custom-written Matlab program.
COMSOL simulations for chamber design. Capture chambers were simulated
using COMSOL v5.2. We have developed a multiphysics model using ‘Laminar
flow’ and ‘Particle Tracing for Fluid Flow’ modules in COMSOL. The chamber
structure was meshed using ‘Fine’ category as element size. No slip boundary
condition is selected for the particle interaction with chamber walls. We have
simulated particle sizes of 8 and 13 mm corresponding to the average diameters of
lymphocytes and granulocytes þ monocytes population. Different chamber
designs were simulated with variable staggering ratio of the pillars’ rows com-
parable to their subsequent previous rows. The flow streamlines of the respective
particles were also plotted, which showed variability in the zero-velocity or dead-
zone regions around the pillars attributing towards non-specific entrapment of cells
in the capture chamber. Using ‘release time’ and ‘stop time’ output parameters, we
were also able to calculate the traversal time for the particle to flow through the
simulated chamber for all the individually released particles. This allowed us to find
how many particles got stuck in the dead zones of the chamber and optimize the
chamber design.
Design of a capture chamber. We designed the capture chamber on chip to
ensure that, first, the cells experience maximum time interacting with the pillars,
where antibodies are adsorbed. Second, to minimize cell capture in the zero-
velocity or stagnation regions around the pillars. Third, different sized cells should
experience the same amount of interaction time in the chamber. Therefore, we
simulated different designs of the capture chambers in COMSOL with 8 and 13 mm
diameter particles flowing between the pillars. To enhance the cell–pillar interac-
tion in a uniform way, the subsequent pillars’ rows were staggered at different
ratios as compared to the previous rows. Row shifting was calculated by staggering
ratio � (pillar–pillar) spacing, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 26. In our previous
study of CD4 T-cell capture, we have used the capture chamber with the staggering
ratio of 0.5. However, here the chamber design was improved significantly, as per
the above three criteria which are critical for expression-based cell capture and
accurate cell counting. We simulated the chambers with different staggering ratios
of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.33, 0.35, 0.4 and 0.5 in COMSOL. Supplementary Fig. 27 shows
the COMSOL images of simulated capture chambers with different pillars’ stag-
gering ratios with flow streamlines around the pillars. For a chamber with stag-
gering ratio of 0, if a particle is flown in the middle stream, it may never interact
with a pillar. However, for a chamber with a staggering ratio of 0.33 or 0.5,
streamlines shift their positions in between pillars, thereby making sure a particle
will interact with the pillar more uniformly irrespective of the size. We fabricated
the chambers with pillars’ staggering ratios of 0.142, 0.2, 0.25 and 0.33 and flow
beads through it for the experimental visualization of the beads–pillars interaction.
Supplementary movies 1–4 show the recorded videos of the beads interacting with
the pillars after every 7, 5, 4 and 3 subsequent rows with staggering ratios of 0.142,
0.2, 0.25 and 0.33, respectively. The simulated peak transit time and transit time
difference between 8 and 13 mm diameter particles versus pillar staggering ratio is
shown in Supplementary Fig. 28a. It shows that for 0.33 staggering ratio of pillars,
the 13 mm particles experience the highest transit time, indicating more interactions
with the pillars. Furthermore, we have also compared the number of stagnated
particles at zero-velocity regions in different chamber designs. This is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 28b for both 8 and 13 mm particles. Chamber with the ratio of
0.33 shows highest transit time for the 13 mm particle (corresponding to granu-
locytes þ monocytes); however, the chamber with 0.35 ratio has the minimum
difference between transit time of 13 and 8 mm particles. Between 0.33 and 0.35, we
selected to use 0.33 chamber design as it has 3.5% stagnated particles as compared
to 6% in 0.35 design. We also compared the two chamber designs, with Designs 1
and 2 having pillars’ staggering ratios of 0.5 and 0.33, respectively. Supplementary
Fig. 29a,b shows that the particles (8 mm diameter) flowing through the Design 2
chamber have a transit time profile, indicating more uniform interactions with the
pillars as compared to Design 1 chamber. The Design 2 chamber showed higher
transit time for 13 mm particles as compared to Design 1 chamber, as shown in
Supplementary Fig. 29b. Supplementary Fig. 30a shows the images of simulated
capture chambers with pillars staggering ratio ¼ 0.33 with flow streamlines around
the pillars. The dotted red circles show the potential stagnation (zero-velocity)
regions where the particles are trapped (Left: 13 mm particles, Right 8 mm particles).
Supplementary Fig. 30b shows the image of a blocked capture chamber and cells
stuck at zero-velocity regions around the pillars. Simulated streamlines have been
overlaid on nearby regions for easier visualization of the stagnated region around
the pillars.
Furthermore, Supplementary Fig. 31 shows the box plots representing accuracy
as percent absolute difference in total leukocyte counts from entrance and exit
counters while comparing Designs 1 and 2 chambers using n ¼ 8 blood samples,
respectively. The average percent difference for Designs 1 and 2 chambers is 12.92
and 3.94%, respectively, suggesting that pillars staggering of 0.33 worked best as
compared to those of 0.5, thus also confirming our simulated results.
Study design. Power analysis. We used power analysis to determine the sample
size to get the desired statistics. To get the correlation coefficient, r ¼ 0.9 in
between the nCD64 values from biochip versus control, an alpha level (two-tailed)
of 0.01 and power at 0.9. For r ¼ 0.9, Za ¼ 2.58. However, Zb ¼ 1.28 for the desired
0.9 power level. The following equation is used to calculate the required sample
size, which gives N ¼ 13.

Blinded samples and experiments. According to the IRB protocol, the samples
were taken anonymously, such that the authors had no knowledge of the donor’s
identity, age, gender or ethnicity. De-identified EMR information of the patients
was only made available to the authors after the patients’ discharge from the
hospital through an institutional approved process. Furthermore, assessment of the
outcomes (cell counts and nCD64 values) was blinded as the flow cytometry
control measurement results were available after the biochip experiments were
completed. Data analytic model (SVM), that is employed to predict sepsis in
patients used a tenfold cross-validated SVM algorithm. Model is trained using
9/10ths of the data (known cases) and then tested on the remaining 1/10ths
(blinded cases). The process is then repeated 1,000 times, each time training and
testing on a random permutation of instances.
Statistical analysis. Bland–Altman analysis: It was used to compare the
agreement between the two nCD64 measurement methods (biochip versus flow
cytometer). It a plot of the difference of nCD64 value between two methods versus
the average nCD64 of both methods. It provides a bias value, which is the average
error (nCD64 difference) between both methods. The positive and negative
limits of agreements were calculated as bias value ±1.96 � SD of the difference.
Two-tailed P values were also calculated. For regression analysis, Po0.0001
rejected the null hypothesis, that is, there exists no correlation between biochip and
control cell counts. Statistical analyses (regression and Bland–Altman) were per-
formed by data analysis add-in for Microsoft Excel. Cross-validation: It is com-
monly known as rotation estimation and was used to train the model to obtain the
biochip nCD64 value from percent captured granulocytes þ monocytes. We used

 threefold cross-validation meaning partitioning data into three equal subsets and
performed analysis (linear correlation) on two sets combined (training set) and
validating analysis on the third (testing set). To reduce variability, we have done
1,000 rounds of cross-validation by randomly selecting samples in the three subsets
and averaged the results over all rounds. Box plots: We have used Matlab to plot
box plots in this study. The red-coloured cross-bars represent the outliers, which
are selected if the data points are greater than q3 þ 1.5 � (q3 – q1) or less than
q1–1.5 � (q3 – q1), where q1 and q3 are the 25th and 75th percentiles of the
sample data, respectively. Prediction model: We used SVM as a statistical method
to develop the model for sepsis prediction. We ranked features/groups in the model
according to their weight vector coefficients. ROC curves are generated to deter-
mine whether mean ranks of populations for each ROC curve (each group) sig-
nificantly differ, which was reported by the p value. Furthermore, the variation in
the features sets, for example, age, gender, chronic conditions and infections, can be
seen as percent populations in septic and non-septic groups, as shown in
Supplementary Table 2. The coefficient of variation (CV) for total leukocyte counts
for septic and non-septic groups is 62.88 and 68.81%, respectively. Furthermore,
the CV for nCD64 value for septic and non-septic groups is 46.07 and 56.60%,
respectively.
Artificial neural networks (ANN) analysis. We have used a neural network
toolbox in Matlab and used pattern recognition to develop a model for predicting
the patient recovery outcome at different time windows for SIRS-positive patients.
We have used a two-layer feed-forward network with sigmoid-hidden and softmax
output neurons. We simulated using ten neurons in hidden and one neuron in
output layers. Input to the ANN model was total WBC count and nCD64 value
at their respective time windows, and targets of the model are the patients’
outcomes (recovered or died). The data were divided into 50% training, 25%
validation and 25% testing samples. The network was trained using scaled
conjugate gradient backpropagation method. Network was trained when the
generalization stopped improving also indicated by the increase in cross-entropy
error. This step was performed by the built-in Matlab program. Hinton diagrams
and the table representing the weight and bias values are provided in
Supplementary Fig. 15.
Data analytic model for sepsis diagnosis. To predict the onset of sepsis,
we categorized the data into three feature sets: (1) Quick SIRS, which included
temperature, pulse, respirations and systolic blood pressure, and (2) Quick SIRS
criteria, lactic acid and biochip parameters including nCD64, total leukocytes
counts and its differentials (granulocytes þ monocytes and lymphocytes). An
attending physician labelled our patients as septic or non-septic. To predict the
onset of sepsis, we used a tenfold cross-validated SVM over 1,000 iterations for
each of the three feature sets. We train our model using 9/10ths of the data (known
cases) and then test the model on the remaining 1/10ths (blinded cases). We
then repeat this process 1,000 times, each time training and testing on a random
permutation of instances. We also performed a one-sided paired Wilcoxon test
between the ROC curves generated to determine whether the difference between
the AUC of the ROC curves obtained was statistically significant and whether mean
ranks of populations (each ROC curve) for each feature set differ. The p-values for
the comparison of these two data sets were less than 0.0001.
