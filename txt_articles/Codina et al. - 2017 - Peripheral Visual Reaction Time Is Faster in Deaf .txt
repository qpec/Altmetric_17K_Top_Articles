Following auditory deprivation, the remaining sense of vision has shown selective
enhancement in visual cognition, especially in the area of near peripheral vision. Visual
acuity is poor in the far periphery and may be an area where sound confers the greatest
advantage in hearing persons. Experience with a visuospatial language such as British
Sign Language (BSL) makes additional demands on the visual system. To test the
different and separable effects of deafness and use of a visuo-spatial language on far
peripheral visual processing, we investigated visual reaction times (RTs) and response
accuracy to visual stimuli, between 30◦ and 85◦ along the four cardinal and four
inter-cardinal meridians. We used three luminances of static, briefly illuminated stimuli
in visually normal adults. The cohort tested included profoundly congenitally deaf adults
(N = 17), hearing fluent BSL users (N = 8) and hearing non-signing adults (N = 18). All
participants were tested using a peripheral forced choice paradigm designed previously
to test deaf and hearing children (Codina et al., 2011a). Deaf adults demonstrated
significantly faster RTs to all far peripheral stimuli and exceeded the abilities of both
signing and non-signing hearing adults. Deaf adults were significantly faster than BSL
interpreters, who in turn were significantly faster than hearing non-signing adults. The
differences in RT demonstrated between groups were consistent across all visual field
meridians and were not localized to any one region of the visual field. There were no
differences found between any groups in accuracy of detecting these static stimuli at any
retinal location. Early onset auditory deprivation appears to lead to a response time visual
advantage in far peripheral responses to briefly presented, static LED stimuli, especially
in the right visual field. Fluency in BSL facilitates faster visuo-motor responses in the
peripheral visual field, but to a lesser extent than congenital, profound deafness.

INTRODUCTION
Human peripheral visual perception is affected by sensory, developmental, and environmental
experience. The visual system has inherent plasticity, peripheral vision in particular showing a
high capacity for plasticity and the potential for peripheral visual plasticity has been previously
underestimated (Burnat, 2015). Both the peripheral retina and the magnocellular visual pathway
 Codina et al.
Enhanced Visual Reactivity in Deaf
have emergent, immature topographies that may facilitate high
levels of visual plasticity throughout life. Far peripheral vision
plays a crucial role in monitoring the environment, especially in
the absence of sound.
Several visual changes have been noted in association with
deafness. Bosworth and Dobkins (2002) showed that deaf adults
performed significantly better to peripheral, but not central
visual stimuli. Proksch and Bavelier (2002) used a visual search
paradigm to report that deaf individuals had greater visual
attentional resources in the visual periphery, and less in central
vision. Neville and Lawson (1987a,b) found enhanced attention
to the visual periphery in a motion decision task, coordinated
with event-related potential (ERP) responses from the occipital
cortex of deaf participants to peripheral stimuli. Bavelier et al.
(2001) by means of fMRI, detected greater recruitment of the
motion selective area V5/MT for deaf participants when they
attended peripherally rather than centrally. Fine et al. (2005)
found that fMRI responses to visual stimuli were uniquely
represented in the auditory cortex of deaf participants, and this
effect was not seen in adult participants who were children of
deaf adults (CODAs), signing from birth. Bavelier et al. (2006)
summarized that not all aspects of vision are improved in deaf
individuals—deaf adults showing slower reactions in central
visual cognitive tasks (Proksch and Bavelier, 2002). Bavelier
et al. (2006) argue that selective visual changes occur which
compensate for those aspects of vision that would normally
benefit from the combined auditory and visual inputs. In line
with this, Codina et al. (2011b) found altered retinal ganglion
cell layer distribution to support peripheral vision, and increased
retinal ganglion cell number and structural changes correlated
with increased peripheral vision performance. Deafness therefore
has a differential influence on both the structure and behavior of
the remaining senses such as vision.
It is not only deafness that has been shown to promote
a peripheral visual advantage in humans. Habitual playing of
computer games has been linked with improved localization
of a peripheral target amongst distractors (Green and Bavelier,
2003), and increased visual field (VF) area Buckley et al.
(2010). Memmert et al. (2009) found specific visual attention
improvements between athletes and non-athletes when the
stimuli were most similar to their practiced sport. Muiños
and Ballesteros (2013) reported that karate athletes were faster
at localizing peripheral visual stimuli than non-athletes. They
suggested that the rapidity of response in their athletes may be
due to the suddenly appearing, peripherally attended, opponent
maneuver. Different patterns of visual skills may result in
specifically trained motor responses to peripheral visual stimuli.
There is consensus amongst several authors that the visual
differences found between athletes and non-athletes are not in
the “hardware” of functional visual pathway changes, but in the
“software,” using perception and visual-cognitive processes more
efficiently, employing skill utilizing strategies made effective with
practice (Abernethy et al., 1994; Muiños and Ballesteros, 2013).
Schubert et al. (2015) conducted a detailed investigation on the
training effects of video gaming on visual attention. They found
that video gamers showed increased visual processing speeds in
the lower aspects of the VF. The video gamers did not change
their attention allocation strategy, with high speed processing
demonstrated in all display locations. However, the video gaming
advantage was seen specifically in areas where non-experts
performed less well, with higher speed visual processing and
shorter minimal exposure duration needed to begin perceptual
processing. These higher processing speeds in response to
training might improve the temporal resolution of attention and
allow attention to be moved between focally and peripherally
presented stimuli.
What is particularly interesting about deaf individuals is
that the altered sensory experience of deafness clearly brings
about unique sensory and cognitive changes. However, most deaf
persons are also immersed, to some degree, in a visual spatial
language such as British Sign Language (BSL), which in itself
places altered conceptual and sensory demands on the visual
system, quite different to spoken language (see Bavelier et al.,
2006 for a review).
During
signed
language
conversation,
fluent,
signing
individuals typically focus on the face of the person signing to
them (Siple et al., 1978; Muir and Richardson, 2005; Agrafiotis
et al., 2006). Taking the visuospatial nature of signed language
into account, signed language is therefore likely to stimulate
peripheral vision in a manner extraordinary to spoken language.
Indeed, Swisher et al. (1989) demonstrated that deaf adults
could understand American Sign Language (ASL) signs using
peripheral vision only, between 45◦ and 61◦ eccentric to fixation,
whereas hearing individuals could not identify large words
presented at similar eccentricities. In signed language space is
used both topographically and referentially (MacSweeney et al.,
2008). Signing space extends from the navel to above the head
and “neutral space” is the area in front of the signer’s body at
mid-lower chest level one where most of the BSL signs occur
(British Deaf Association, 1992). The majority of “words” in ASL
are produced below eye level (Teuber et al., 1980); therefore, it
may be that the inferior field of vision is particularly stimulated
by signed language experience.
Familiarization with visuospatial language does not seem
to produce the same enhancements in peripheral vision as
revealed in deaf adults: the visual advantages cited earlier in deaf
individuals have not been found in hearing signing populations
(Neville and Lawson, 1987a,b; Bosworth and Dobkins, 2002;
Proksch and Bavelier, 2002; Fine et al., 2005). However, these
experiments did not test as far in the periphery as we have tested
here. Nevertheless, signing has produced distinct cortical and
visual changes. Cortical adaptations have been observed in both
hearing and deaf signers in response to language perception.
Although a right hemisphere predilection and therefore left
VF advantage is widely accepted in the general population
(Paillard et al., 1981; Paillard and Amblard, 1985; Clarke et al.,
2000), Bosworth and Dobkins (1999, 2002) demonstrated a left
hemisphere lateralization and right VF advantage for motion
processing in signers, whether deaf or hearing. Bavelier et al.
(2001) found early exposure to ASL led to greater reliance on the
left hemisphere motion selective area V5/MT. The left, language
dominant hemisphere may become increasingly activated by
motion processing in deaf and hearing signers, leading to a
right VF advantage for the processing of visual motion (Neville

and Lawson, 1987a; Bosworth and Dobkins, 1999; Bavelier
et al., 2001). Cardin et al. (2013) in an fMRI study of distinct
deaf signers and deaf lip readers showed that cortical regions
adjust to process the different signals—either speech reading or
signed language and that functionally distinct cortical substrates
separate deaf adults who sign from those who speech read.
Given the plasticity of the visual periphery to maximize its
response to the pattern of visual skills required, one might
expect BSL experience itself to influence far peripheral vision
and RTs therein. In a previous paper (Codina et al., 2011a) in
which we reported deaf and hearing children’s peripheral visual
performance development on a far peripheral vision task (30–
85◦), young deaf children (aged 5–8 years) were initially slower
to respond to peripheral stimuli than hearing children, they
performed similarly at ages 9–11 years, and were significantly
faster than controls at ages 12–15 years. To the authors’
knowledge, the RT advantage consistently observed in deaf adults
has not been thoroughly investigated across the far peripheral
field and neither has it been investigated in hearing sign language
users. The aim of the current study was to investigate far
peripheral visual sensitivity and RT in early onset deaf adults
and BSL interpreters, to explore the different and separable
effects of auditory deprivation and experience with a visuospatial
language.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
All participants were emmetropic; the refractive error did
not therefore affect the VF and glasses frames would have
interfered with detection of peripheral stimuli. Inclusion
criteria for all groups were: good visual acuity in either eye
unaided, minimum 0.200 LogMAR units (equivalent to 6/9.5
Snellen acuity, using a standard illuminated ETDRS vision
chart at 4 m), absence of epilepsy, and no known abnormal
ophthalmological history self-reported during the study consent
procedure.
Deaf Group
Seventeen adults (11 males, 6 females, mean age 33.25 years,
range 18–45) with profound binaural hearing loss were recruited
by invitation from Grange Crescent Deaf Club in Sheffield, the
University of Sheffield, personal contacts, word of mouth through
other deaf participants, and from deaf individuals working at
Lower Meadow Primary Academy and Allerton Grange School.
Criteria for entering the study for deaf participants were:
deafness was either present at birth or had onset before the
age of 8 months, and was not due to any systemic or genetic
disorder known to affect vision such as Usher’s syndrome. Eleven
participants reported BSL as their native language and 6 reported
English. Five participants were left handed and 12 right handed.
Nine participants reported being regular action video game
players. Four out of the 17 deaf participants contracted deafness
as a result of in-uterine rubella and were thus screened by full
ophthalmic examination prior to entry into the study to ensure
there were no visual deficits.
Hearing Group
Eighteen participants with no hearing loss and no prior
knowledge of any signed language took part in this study (9
males, 9 females, mean age 30.28 years, range 18–45). These
participants were recruited through colleagues at The University
of Sheffield. Six participants reported themselves as regular action
video game players. One participant was left handed and 17 were
right handed.
BSL Interpreter Group
Eight participants, all trained and qualified full-time BSL
interpreters, registered with ASLI (Association for Sign Language
Interpreters), with a minimum of 6 years’ experience formed this
group (6 females, 2 males, mean age 39.1, range 27–62). Two
participants in this group are CODAs and learned sign language
as their first language. None of the interpreters reported being
action video game players. One participant was left handed and
seven were right handed.
Eye of Testing
Time was a constraint for three participants in the deaf group
and two participants in the BSL group who were teachers in one
of the schools visited, therefore for these participants only the
right eye was tested. For most of the results only the right eye
data is presented in line with the work of other authors (Stevens
and Neville, 2006; Codina et al., 2011a; Bjerre et al., 2014), as VFs
are known to be highly symmetrical in normal subjects (Brenton
et al., 1986) and no differences were found between our right
and left eye data. We do investigate possible lateralization in the
Results section, although the number of participants for which
we have data for both eyes is less than that for which we have the
right eye data [right eye (N = 17), both eyes (N = 14) for the
deaf group, and right eye (N = 8), both eyes (N = 6) for the BSL
group].
Stimuli and Procedure
Informed, written consent was obtained from all participants
prior to testing and the study procedures were approved by The
University of Sheffield Psychology Department Ethics Committee
and complied with the Helsinki Declaration. The methods of
this study have been fully described elsewhere (Codina et al.,
2011a). In brief, this peripheral vision task was to detect static,
briefly illuminated LEDs, presented to the far visual periphery.
As is shown schematically in Figure 1 the VF test incorporated
96 LEDs (Nichia, 1.5 cds), implanted into a uniform gray
hemisphere (0.5 m radius). This hemisphere contained 12 LEDs
along each of the eight meridians that correspond to the four
cardinal and four inter-cardinal directions for the right eye and
left eye VFs (see Figure 1). The LEDs were positioned between
30◦ and 85◦ in 5◦ steps. An adjustable chin and forehead rest
enabled a fixed viewing distance of 1 m and centralization of
the participant’s eye to the central fixation light behind which
was a black and white camera for monitoring fixation. In total
224 LEDs were each very briefly illuminated (for 200 ms) in
front of the participant’s right eye or left at three different light
intensities in a random order. Ninety-six dim stimuli at 83.47
cd/m2, 96 medium stimuli at 91.81 cd/m2, and only 32 bright

stimuli (at 40◦, 55◦, 70◦, and 85◦ only) of 118.94 cd/m2 intensity
were presented in a random order. The brightest stimuli were
easy to locate and therefore only tested at every third eccentricity
to maintain participant interest and check compliance. The
data from these stimuli are not reported here. The test was
calibrated with an oscilloscope prior to each testing session to
ensure uniformity of time period and degree of illumination after
transportation. The participant responded by setting a joystick,
positioned at chest height, to one of eight possible positions. The
joystick was positioned either in front of the right hand or left
hand according to self-reported handedness.
The test was carefully explained to each participant in either
English or BSL in a lit room and the directions and response
directions and instructions for the joystick were both explained
and demonstrated to each participant. Participants were seated
on an adjustable desk chair, facing the LED array test, their chin
and head on rests, aligned and adjusted so that the participant’s
tested eye was centered 0.5 m behind the fixation target. The
other eye was occluded with a patch. All external light sources
were eliminated prior to testing and only low level artificial
illumination mounted on the upper surface of the hemisphere
was provided at a constant level of 1.2 cd/m2 brightness for all test
environments. Specifically written MATLAB (The MathWorks,
Inc.) software with the Data Acquisition Toolbox controlled
both the LEDs and logged the data from the joystick via
National Instruments data acquisition hardware. Participants
first completed a practice trial which consisted of 32 bright
stimuli, where four stimuli were presented on every meridian
all at eccentricities of 40◦, 55◦, 70◦, and 85◦, and on satisfactory
completion of the practice the test was begun. Participants were
asked to move the joystick to the position corresponding to
the meridian of the stimulus LED. Participant fixation during
stimulus presentation was observed by the experimenter through
a small TV screen monitoring the camera at the fixation point;
a stimulus would be repeated later in the sequence if fixation
was not maintained. If the participant responded either with
the exact matching meridian of the LED or adjacent meridians
then this was recorded as a correct response and the RT
recorded. We did also record the exactly correct data, when
the response exactly matched the LED meridian, and this is
only described in the Accuracy data section. Pilot studies had
shown that with such peripheral presentations it is difficult to
localize the exact position of a flashed LED, particularly for young
children. The same procedure was adopted here as we wished
to compare our pediatric data (Codina et al., 2011a) with our
adult data. All other VF tests reported in the literature used
yes/no (detection) responses (Rowe, 2016), and therefore our
discrimination paradigm requiring a response accuracy of ±45◦
was a relatively difficult task.
RESULTS
RT data
No differences were found within any test between our right
and left eye data; we therefore initially present data from the
right eye only, in line with previous authors (Stevens and
Neville, 2006; Bjerre et al., 2014). As not all targets were
correctly localized by participants, their RT data were analyzed
in two separate ANOVAs: by mean meridian RTs averaged
across eccentricity and separately mean eccentricity RTs averaged
across meridians. Only intermediate and dim stimuli results
are presented as the brightest stimuli were used as a control
measure.
Meridian Data Averaged Across Eccentricity
The mean meridian RT data were analyzed by a three factor
mixed measures ANOVA where the factors were group (deaf,
hearing or BSL interpreter), stimulus intensity (intermediate and
dim) and meridian (8 levels). Figure 2 shows the mean RT data
averaged across all stimuli for the right eye for each of the three
groups. There was a significant main effect of group [F(2, 40) =
4.11, p = 0.03]; as can be seen from Figure 2 the mean for the
deaf group (mean 585.31 ms) was less than for the hearing group
(mean 731.77 ms) with the BSL Interpreter group somewhere in

between (mean 627.39 ms). Bonferroni corrected post-hoc t-tests
showed that deaf adults had significantly faster RTs than either
the hearing group (t = 6.22, df = 33, p < 0.001), and the BSL
interpreter group (t = 2.40, df = 24, p = 0.03). BSL interpreters
also showed faster RTs than hearing non-signers (t = 3.29, df =
25, p = 0.003).
There was no significant main effect of stimulus intensity,
or any interaction with the other factors therefore all graphs
show data averaged across the intermediate and dim stimulus
intensities. As can be seen in Figure 3 the mean RTs at each
meridian location for the right eye do show some variation
and the main effect of meridian was significant [F(7, 280) =
17.67, p < 0.001], yet the interaction between meridian and
group was not significant. No other effects or interactions were
significant. Faster RTs are apparent for all three groups in the
inferior temporal VF and the hearing and BSL interpreter groups
appear closest to each other in this region. Bonferroni corrected
post-hoc t-tests between groups for each meridian revealed
significant differences at each meridian between deaf and hearing
groups only and these results are shown in the Table within
Figure 3.
Eccentricity Data Averaged across Meridian
Figure 4 compares mean RTs for eccentricities averaged across
meridians for the three groups as a function of eccentricity.
A three factor mixed measures [group × stimulus intensity
× eccentricity] ANOVA was conducted. There was again, a
significant main effect of group [F(2, 40) = 3.87, p = 0.03].
There was a significant main effect of eccentricity [F(11, 440)
= 2.28, p = 0.01]: increased eccentricity resulted in a slower
RT for all three groups. There was a consistent RT ordering
of deaf < BSL interpreters < hearing across all eccentricities.
There was no interaction between eccentricity and group and
no other interaction with eccentricity was significant. However
Bonferroni corrected post-hoc t-tests showed that deaf adults had
significantly faster RTs than the hearing group at 35◦ (t = 2.56,
df = 33, p = 0.02), 60◦ (t = 3.26, df = 33, p = 0.003) and 70◦
(t = 3.25, df = 33, p = 0.003), though deaf vs. hearing results
were close to significance at most eccentricities.
Native Language
To determine possible influences of the deaf participants’ native
language, it was considered as a fourth factor (Native BSL N =
11 and native English N = 6). The native language factor was not
significant, nor did it affect the levels of significance for any other
factor. This is an interesting finding, as BSL cannot be wholly
responsible for the differences observed in the deaf group. We
also tested for differences between action computer game players
and non-computer game players within the deaf and hearing
groups and found no significant effects or interactions with this
factor. However, none of the computer game players would be
classed as habitual players under Green and Bavelier’s (2003)
criteria.
Right and Left Visual Fields
Although no differences were found between right and left eye
data, right and left visual field data were different. Lateralization
differences have been found before when the right VF (comprised
of right temporal and left nasal VFs) is compared to the left
VF (left temporal and right nasal). Figure 1 illustrates how the
right VF (A,B,C for both eyes) and left VF (A’
,B’
,C’ for both
eyes) are comprised. Figure 5 shows the mean RT data for
each group for this data and a slight left VF RT advantage is
observed in all groups. A one way ANOVA with between subjects
factor of group (bootstrapped) was conducted on right and left
VF data. A significant effect of group was found for the right
VF only [F(2, 35) = 3.641, p = 0.037]. Post-hoc pairwise t-test
comparisons (Bonferroni corrected and bootstrapped) within the
right VF showed that deaf participants (n = 14, M = 589.43,
SE = 32.2) were significantly faster than hearing (n = 18, M
= 706.8, SE = 32.9), (p = 0.036). No other differences between
groups were significant and no significant differences were found
between right and left VFs within any group. Consistent with
other published studies (Papadatou-Pastou and Sáfár, 2016) the
deaf group had an atypically higher proportion of left handed
participants (29% left handed) than the general population,
therefore handedness was considered as a second factor in a
separate ANOVA. Handedness was not significant, nor did it
affect the significance levels of any other factor.
Accuracy
Percentage correct response data were analyzed by a three
factor mixed measures [Group × stimulus intensity × meridian]
ANOVA. The overall effect of group was not significant, see
Figure 6A, which shows that the accuracy is similar for each
group. Meridian had a significant effect as expected, due to nasal
and superior aspects of the VF being obscured by the nose and
brows [F(7, 280) = 79.62, p < 0.001]. Stimulus intensity had a

DISCUSSION
Deaf participants reacted significantly faster to the peripherally
presented stimuli when compared to the hearing group and
BSL interpreter group. This pattern of results was found across
all VF locations and up to the maximum eccentricities tested.
Faster RTs in early onset deaf adults found in this study are
consistent with the faster deaf RTs reported in the literature
(Parasnis and Samar, 1985; Neville and Lawson, 1987a; Loke
and Song, 1991; Stivalet et al., 1998; Bosworth and Dobkins,
2002; Proksch and Bavelier, 2002). Importantly, however, the
current study demonstrates a greater advantage in the far
peripheral VF, in a range of peripheral vision (30–85◦), which
has not previously been investigated. Peripheral visual acuity
is increasingly poor at increasing eccentricities, thereby sound
confers the greatest advantage at this range of eccentricities. At
far peripheral locations our study finds markedly speeded RTs in
deaf participants as well as moderately speeded RTs in full time
BSL interpreters.
The fastest RTs for all groups and the fastest RTs overall were
displayed by the deaf group in inferior and temporal aspects
of the VF. One might expect the greatest advantage for deaf
individuals in these VF areas where the majority of “words” in
signed language would occur (Teuber et al., 1980). However,
the significantly speeded RTs were identifiable in all meridian
locations and could not be localized to any particular region
of the VF. The deaf RT advantage was not significant at all
eccentricities, likely because of the increased standard error in
eccentricity data. The significant differences in all Figure 4 post-
hoc analyses revealed differences only between deaf and hearing
groups and not between BSL and hearing or between BSL and
deaf groups. This deaf advantage at these far eccentricities is
consistent with Swisher et al.’s (1989) finding that deaf adults
could reliably identify ASL signs 45◦ and 61◦ eccentric to fixation
using peripheral vision only and with Buckley et al. (2010) report
of significantly larger VFs in deaf adults, using kinetic stimuli at
a similar range of eccentricities. Buckley and colleagues found
that the areas of most significant increase were the inferior and
temporal aspects of the VF—regions most stimulated by signed
language but also the most expansible aspects of the VF. In deaf
adults the RT advantage results from the combined effects of
auditory deprivation and the cross-modal plasticity evidenced to
this (Fine et al., 2005), as well as immersion into an entirely visual
language. However, our results suggest that visuo-spatial BSL
language immersion alone does not confer the same peripheral
vision RT advantage that auditory deprivation does.
The visuo-cognitive influences of auditory deprivation and
signed language exposure are likely to be distinct, yet segregating
one from the other is difficult. As previously described, 11 of our
deaf group reported BSL as their native language, yet analyses
by native language showed no significant influence of native
language on RT. However, even in the minority of predominantly
aural deaf individuals (for example those married to hearing
persons) cumulative exposure to sign language throughout life
is still significant. Cardin et al. (2013) reported that after plastic
reorganization in deafness, cortical regions adapt to process the
different types of signal—either lip reading or signed language—
and that functionally distinguishable substrates are present at the
cortical level between deaf who sign and deaf who lip read.
Interestingly, Emmorey et al. (2009) found an eye gaze
fixation pattern difference between beginning and native
signers: beginning signers fixated nearer to the signer’s mouth
so to perceive lip mouthings more clearly; whereas fluent
signers fixated nearer to the interlocutor’s eyes. Thus increased
experience with signed language was related to a greater ability
to perceive signed and mouthed information more peripherally.
In our data, the hearing signers were all currently working BSL
interpreters, having been fluent in BSL for a minimum of 6
years. They might have therefore adapted during the course of
their BSL careers to move further away from lower face fixation
as peripheral vision adapts to improve sensitivity to the most
peripheral areas most utilized by signed language and facial
expression.
In a previous paper (Codina et al., 2011b), we reported
that the retinal nerve fiber layer in the eyes of early onset
deaf adults was differentially distributed to support peripheral
vision, particularly temporal aspects of the VF where the left
and right VFs do not overlap and neural resources may be
most influential. Fine et al. (2005) reported that the cross-
modal plasticity within the auditory cortex responding to
signed language was not present in either non-profoundly
deaf individuals nor present in hearing signers. The results
showing that facilitating this level of neural reorganization
requires a dramatically altered sensory experience. That said,

Enhanced Visual Reactivity in Deaf
FIGURE 6 | This Figure shows the mean percentage responses (within 45◦) for the three groups: deaf; hearing; and BSL interpreters for (A) the

it is perhaps only in profoundly deaf adults that increased
neural circuitry to the remaining senses is expected, consistent
with Fine et al. (2005) and Codina et al. (2011b), which
might facilitate the RT decrease identified in the far periphery
in this study. However, electrophysiological (Osorio et al.,
2010) and brain imaging studies (Ballesteros et al., 2013) have
found altered neural correlates in response to simple behavioral
training in conceptual object priming, and this in itself may
be evidence of compensatory neural activity. Our results are
comparable with Buckley et al. (2010) where habitual video game
players showed enhanced areas of peripheral visual sensitivity in
comparison to non-video-game players, which were even larger
in early onset deaf adults. This suggests that enhancement of
peripheral vision may be partially mediated by visual attention,
with additional compensatory improvement due to sensory
deprivation.
Based on our previous research, it is likely that the reduced
RTs identified in deaf adults were slow to develop (Codina et al.,
2011a), and were perhaps facilitated by altered neural substrates
and compensatory neural activity (Codina et al., 2011b). It is
possible that similar neural changes may have occurred in hearing
signers as well, although this has not yet been tested. However, the
visual differences found between hearing signers and non-signers
might be similar to the differences found between athletes and
non-athletes, not so much in the “hardware” of functional visual
pathway changes, but in the “software” efficiency of perceptive
and attentional processes (Abernethy et al., 1994; Muiños and
Ballesteros, 2013).
Recruitment of BSL interpreters was particularly difficult due
to the national shortage of BSL interpreters at the present time
(McAleer, 2006), and as a consequence, the mean age of the BSL
interpreter group is slightly higher than for deaf and hearing
groups. However, simple RT is known to increase with age (Der
and Deary, 2006) and become more variable (Hultsch et al.,
2002). Also of note was that none of the BSL interpreter group
played computer games, as computer game playing has been
shown to improve peripheral vision (Green and Bavelier, 2003;
Buckley et al., 2010). Therefore, to find faster RTs in this slightly
older and non-computer game playing group is a more striking
result.
The RTs we report in our study are larger than those studies
employing standard kinetic perimetry (Grobbel et al., 2016).
Grobel and colleagues, with varying ages of adult participants,
reported RTs of 391—522ms. However, theirs was a motion
detection task, more suited to the peripheral visual pathway and
required the simple press of a button, whereas our experiment
utilized static eccentric stimuli and an 8-alternative forced choice
task and was therefore conceptually more demanding.
All groups showed a slight left VF RT advantage, in line
with the right hemisphere predilection for visual-spatial activity,
widely reported in the literature (Paillard et al., 1981; Paillard
and Amblard, 1985; Clarke et al., 2000) and reported in hearing
non-signers by Bosworth and Dobkins (1999, 2002), Neville
and Lawson (1987b). In a stochastic motion task within 15◦ of
fixation, Bosworth and Dobkins (2002) reported that both deaf
and hearing signers displayed the opposite pattern of results to
hearing non-signers, finding a right VF RT advantage in deaf
and hearing signers. We did not find this right VF advantage in
the far periphery tested in our study. However, the significant
RT reduction in the deaf group’s right VF, in comparison with
hearing controls, and the highly similar right and left VF RTs in
our deaf group may indicate a sensory compensatory mechanism
to advance the typical left RT advantage additionally to the right
VF. Therefore, auditory deprivation rather than BSL exposure
seems to influence the right VF RT. This is interesting in that
lesion and neuroimaging studies have consistently reported that
the neurobiology of signed language is very similar to spoken
language, principally recruiting the left lateralized perisylvian
network no matter which language is involved (MacSweeney
et al., 2008).
In light of the markedly reduced RTs for the deaf group it is
interesting to consider which particular aspects of visuomotor
processing may be enhanced by auditory deprivation and
training. Auditory deprivation may speed peripheral perception
by use of compensatory cortical plasticity and exposure to a
language stimulating the visual periphery may call into play

 Codina et al.
Enhanced Visual Reactivity in Deaf
alternative visual attention allocation strategies which may, in
turn speed the visuomotor response. When considering the
visuomotor nature of this study’s task it is of note that the
deaf group contained a high number of left handed individuals
and this finding is consistent with other studies (Papadatou-
Pastou and Sáfár, 2016). Atypical handedness may contribute
to VF laterality differences, though had no significant effect on
our results. Bavelier et al. (2006) put forward four hypotheses
in relation to deaf neural and attentional adaptations. They
proposed that adaptation may be genetic; that areas V1 and V2
may be more susceptible to intramodal recruitment to visual
attention; that multisensory associative cortical areas might
reorganize to the remaining modalities such as vision; or that
auditory cortex might reorganize to mediate other functions such
as vision. Our results suggest that the most speeded responses,
highlighting the highest visual attention in the far periphery
in deaf adults, supersede the increased visual attention brought
about by practice with a visual-spatial language alone, signifying
different mechanisms of visual compensation.
CONCLUSION
Deaf adults demonstrated significantly faster RTs than both
hearing non-signers and hearing BSL interpreters to a range of far
peripheral briefly presented static stimuli and this advantage was
consistent across all VF locations up to 85◦ eccentric to fixation.
BSL interpreters displayed faster RTs than hearing non-signing
adults across the entire VF. Early onset deafness leads to visual
compensation in the form of much faster peripheral vision RTs
consistent with the cross-modal plasticity benefits to vision of
auditory deprivation and use of a visual spatial language. The deaf
RT advantage is most apparent in the right VF, where hearing
responses are significantly slower. Fluency in BSL without
deafness also leads to rapid responses to peripheral stimuli,
although not to the same degree as deafness. Daily immersion in
a visual-spatial language benefits visual responsiveness to stimuli
in the peripheral VF.
