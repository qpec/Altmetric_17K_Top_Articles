IMPORTANCE Indwelling urethral catheters (ie, Foley catheters) are important in caring for
certain hospitalized patients but can also cause complications in patients.
OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence of infectious and noninfectious patient-reported
complications associated with the indwelling urethral catheter.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective cohort study of consecutive patients with
placement of a new indwelling urethral catheter while hospitalized at 1 of 4 US hospitals in 2
states. The study was conducted from August 26, 2015, to August 18, 2017. Participants were
evaluated at baseline and contacted at 14 days and 30 days after insertion of the catheter
about complications associated with the indwelling urethral catheter and how catheterization
affected their social activities or activities of daily living.
EXPOSURES Indwelling urethral catheter placement during hospitalization. Patients were
enrolled within 3 days of catheter insertion and followed up for 30 days after catheter
placement, whether the catheter remained in or was removed from the patient.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Infectious and noninfectious complications associated with
an indwelling urethral catheter as well as how the catheter affected patient social activities or
activities of daily living.
RESULTS Of 2967 eligible patients, 2227 (75.1%) agreed to participate at 1 of 4 study sites;
2076 total patients were evaluated. Of these, 71.4% were male; mean (SD) age was 60.8
(13.4) years. Most patients (1653 of 2076 [79.6%]) had short-term catheters placed for
surgical procedures. During the 30 days after urethral catheter insertion, 1184 of 2076
patients (57.0%; 95% CI, 54.9%-59.2%) reported at least 1 complication due to the indwelling
urethral catheter. Infectious complications were reported by 219 of 2076 patients (10.5%;
95% CI, 9.3%-12.0%), whereas noninfectious complications (eg, pain or discomfort, blood
in the urine, or sense of urinary urgency) occurred in 1150 patients (55.4%; 95% CI,
53.2%-57.6%) (P < .001). Women were more likely to report an infectious complication
(92 of 594 [15.5%] women vs 127 of 1482 [8.6%] men; P < .001), while men were more likely
to report a noninfectious complication (869 of 1482 [58.6%] men vs 281 of 594 [47.3%]
women; P < .001). Restrictions in activities of daily living (49 of 124 patients [39.5%]) or social
activity (54 of 124 [43.9%]) were commonly reported by the patients who had catheters still
in place; sexual problems were reported by 99 of 2034 patients (4.9%) after their catheter
was removed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Noninfectious complications of urethral catheters affect
a substantial number of patients, underscoring the importance of avoiding urethral
catheterization whenever possible. Given the high incidence of these patient-reported
complications, urethral catheter–associated noninfectious complications should be a focus
of surveillance and prevention efforts.

ndwelling urethral catheters are a mainstay in the care of
hospitalized patients. An estimated 30 million indwelling
urethral (ie, Foley) catheters are sold annually in the United
States,1 and approximately 20% of hospitalized patients have
a urethral catheter at any given time.2,3 While indwelling ure-
thral catheters are important for the care of certain hospital-
ized patients (eg, monitoring hourly urine output in critically
ill patients),4 they are invasive medical devices and, as such,
areapotentialthreattopatientsafety.Themostcommonlyrec-
ognized complication is catheter-associated urinary tract
infection.3,5
Although infectious complications associated with in-
dwellingurethralcathetersarewelldescribed,fewstudieshave
examined the noninfectious complications associated with
their use, and Foley catheters lead to several patient safety
problems.6 For example, a study by Leuck et al7 identified 100
instancesofFoleycatheter–associatedtraumain6513catheter-
days during a period of 16 months. Using administrative data,
Aaronson and colleagues8 found that urethral catheter–
associated complications were linked to an increased length
of stay and an increased risk of urinary tract infection among
surgical patients.8 Finally, Hollingsworth and colleagues9 re-
ported in their systematic review of 37 studies that noninfec-
tious urethral catheter–associated complications were as com-
mon as clinically significant infections.
Several limitations exist with the previous studies. For
example, most were single-site investigations, did not col-
lect data after catheter removal, and often focused on spe-
cific patient populations (eg, men, surgical patients, or
intensive care unit patients),7,10,11 limiting their generaliz-
ability. The data sources used are also problematic, with
studies using urology consultations likely to overestimate
complication rates,10,11 whereas those using diagnosis codes8
are likely to underestimate complication frequency. Finally,
few studies to date have included the perspective of the
patient, even though patients can be a reliable source of
information about adverse events.12 We thus conducted a
prospective study to measure the incidence of all complica-
tions associated with the indwelling urethral catheter and to
capture patient insights about how the use of this device
affects their well-being and safety.
Methods
Study Overview
We conducted a prospective cohort study at 4 US hospitals in
which hospitalized patients with an indwelling urethral cath-
eter were identified and followed up for 30 days after its in-
sertion,evenifthecatheterhadbeenremovedduringthattime.
Data about both infectious and noninfectious catheter–
associated complications during this 30-day period were col-
lected through patient interviews. This process included an in-
personinterviewwiththepatientwithin3daysafterplacement
of the catheter and follow-up assessments after 14 days and
30 days, either in-person or through brief telephone inter-
views. The 4 study sites were the University of Michigan Medi-
cal Center and Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare Sys-
tem, both in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Ben Taub Hospital and
the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, both
in Houston, Texas. The primary objectives were to determine
rates and types of patient-reported infectious and noninfec-
tious complications associated with urethral catheters. Insti-
tutional review board approval was received at each partici-
pating facility. All participants provided written informed
consent.
Data Collection and Inclusion Criteria
Each weekday morning (Monday through Friday) from August
26, 2015, to August 18, 2017, research staff identified patients
onselectedinpatientunitswho,duringtheprevious3days,had
placementofaurethralcatheter.Patienteligibilitycriteriawere
(1) hospitalization in an acute care unit, including medical/
surgical wards, and intensive care and progressive care units;
(2)placementofaurethralcatheterforthefirsttimeduringthis
hospital stay; (3) the urethral catheter had been in place for no
longer than 3 days; (4) patients were at least 18 years of age; and
(5) patients were able to speak either English or Spanish. Exclu-
sion criteria were (1) inability to provide self-consent or partici-
pate in the interview/assessment process (eg, obtundation, se-
vere dementia, or delirium); (2) refusal to provide written
informed consent to participate; or (3) previous participation
in this study. After identifying potentially eligible patients by
usingdatafromtheelectronicmedicalrecordsystem,studystaff
conducted bedside visits to begin the recruitment process. Af-
terconfirmingeligibility,patientswereinvitedtoparticipatere-
gardlessofwhethertheurethralcatheterwasstillinplaceatthe
time of recruitment. Once they were recruited, patient fol-
low-up continued for 30 days from the initial date of catheter
insertion. Participants received a souvenir magnet as a thank-
you gift for their participation.
Information about patient characteristics as well as infec-
tiousandnoninfectiouscomplicationsassociatedwiththeure-
thral catheter were collected directly from patients. After pro-
viding written consent, an initial in-person patient interview
was conducted that included questions about why the ure-
thral catheter was placed. The American Urological Associa-
tion (AUA) Symptom Index was used to identify any urologic
Key Points
Question From a patient’
s perspective, how common are
infectious and noninfectious indwelling urethral
catheter–associated complications?
Findings In this multicenter cohort study of 2076 adults with
an indwelling urethral catheter, 57% of patients reported at least
1 complication because of the catheter, and noninfectious
complications (55%) were 5 times as common as infectious
complications (11%). Women were significantly more likely to
report infectious complications, whereas men reported a
significantly higher frequency of noninfectious complications.
Meaning Noninfectious complications involving urethral
catheters are common; in addition to avoiding urethral
catheterization, patient safety efforts should focus on reducing
the noninfectious harms of urethral catheters.

 symptom in the previous month (ie, precatheterization).13 Fol-
low-up assessments were conducted approximately 14 days
and 30 days after catheter insertion. The follow-up assess-
ments, which asked patients about their symptoms and expe-
riences during the previous 2 weeks, were conducted in per-
son if the patient was still hospitalized. After discharge, a study
team member contacted the patient by telephone. The pa-
tient assessment was designed to elicit the patient’
s perspec-
tives about the catheter and to identify complications, such
as pain, that may not be well documented in the medical rec-
ord. Indeed, patient assessments may be the only way to iden-
tify complications that occur after hospital discharge, particu-
larly complications that do not lead to a medical visit or require
intervention. Questions were primarily closed ended, except

Statistical Analysis
We calculated general descriptive statistics for all variables of
interest, including baseline patient characteristics (number
with percentage or mean [SD]) and outcomes of interest (num-
ber with percentage and 95% CI). The primary outcome was
the percentage of patients experiencing a complication from
a urethral catheter at any time, which was calculated for se-
lect individual complications as well as by group (infectious
vs noninfectious). The frequency of complications at each site
was also assessed. The χ2 test was used to compare complica-
tion percentages by certain demographic and clinical charac-
teristics. These characteristics included age, sex, indication for
catheter placement (perioperative, urinary retention or blad-
der obstruction, or other), AUA symptom index score prior to
catheter use (range, 1-7 [mild]; 8-19 [moderate]; or 20-35
[severe]),13 and catheter duration (≤3 days or >3 days). To test
whetherdifferencesbetweenthesexespersistedafteraccount-
ing for age, AUA symptom index score, reason for placement,
and catheter duration, we used multivariable Poisson regres-
sion with robust SEs.14
All analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS
InstituteInc)orStata,version15(StataCorp).Allstatisticaltests
were 2-sided with α set to .05.
Results
Of 2967 eligible patients at 4 study sites, 2227 (75.1%) agreed
to participate and 2076 patients were evaluated (Figure 1). The
majority of patients (1482 of 2076 [71.4%]) were male; mean
(SD) age was 60.8 (13.4) years. Participants who were missing
a baseline assessment or both follow-up assessments were ex-
cluded (151 of 2227 patients [6.8%]), resulting in 2076 pa-
tients included in this analysis. Patients were recorded in both
the group with a catheter in place and the group with the cath-
eter removed if they had an indwelling catheter at 1 follow-up
evaluation, but not at the other follow-up evaluation.
Table 1 describes the patient demographics. Only 594 pa-
tients (28.6%) were women because the 2 Veterans Affairs
medical centers included in the study provide care for a pre-
dominately male population. Urethral catheters were ini-
tially placed before surgical procedures in 1653 of 2076 par-
ticipants (79.6%). Most catheters were placed for short
durations, with 1578 patients (76.0%) having them removed
within 3 days of insertion. Only 164 patients (7.9%) reported
experiencingpain,discomfort,bleeding,ortraumaduringcath-
eterplacement.Asignificantlylowerpercentageofpatients(33

 whose catheter had been removed prior to enrollment re-
ported experiencing those complications during removal
(Table 1).
During the 30 days after a urethral catheter was inserted,
1184 of 2076 patients (57.0%; 95% CI, 54.9%-59.2%) reported
at least 1 complication because of the indwelling urethral cath-
eter. As shown in Table 2, noninfectious complications were
5 times as prevalent as infectious complications (noninfec-
tious, 55.4%; 95% CI, 53.2%-57.6% vs infectious, 10.5%; 95%
CI, 9.3%-12.0%; P < .001). Women were more likely than men
to report an infectious complication (92 of 594 women [15.5%]
vs 127 of 1482 men [8.6%]; P < .001), whereas men were more
likely than women to report a noninfectious complication (869
of 1482 men [58.6%] vs 281 of 594 women [47.3%]; P < .001)
as depicted in Figure 2.
Table 2 shows the percentage of specific patient-reported
complications during the month after urethral catheter inser-
tion. Both infectious and noninfectious complications were re-
ported more frequently by patients who still had their cath-
eter. For 2034 patients who had had their catheter removed,
the most frequently cited noninfectious complications were
leaking urine (413 of 2034 patients [20.3%]; 95% CI, 18.6%-
22.2%), feeling a sense of urgency or bladder spasms (487
[24.0%]; 95% CI, 22.2%-25.9%), and difficulty with starting or
stopping the urine stream (395 [19.5%]; 95% CI, 17.8%-
21.3%). The most common noninfectious complication cited
by the 124 patients who still had a catheter in place was pain
or discomfort (67 of 124 patients [54.5%]; 95% CI, 45.3%-
63.5%), a sense of urgency or bladder spasms (43 [34.7%]; 95%
CI, 26.4%-43.8%), and blood in the urine (34 [27.4%]; 95% CI,
19.8%-36.2%).Inadditiontoinfectiousandnoninfectiouscom-
plications, many of the 124 patients who still had a catheter
reportedactivitiesofdailylivingrestrictions(49of124[39.5%];
95% CI, 30.9%-48.7%) and social activity restrictions (54 of 124
[43.9%]; 95% CI, 35.0%-53.1%). Of the 124 patients, 16 (12.9%)
with a catheter in place reported mechanical or equipment is-
sues with the catheter or securement device. Sexual prob-
lems were reported by 99 of 2034 patients (4.9%) who had a
catheter that had been removed (95% CI, 4.0%-5.9%).
Select clinical characteristics associated with patient-
reportedinfectiousandnoninfectiouscomplicationsareshown
in Table 3. For example, a higher percentage of patients with
a baseline AUA symptom index score in the severe range re-
portedbothinfectiouscomplications(37of213patients[17.4%];
P < .001) and noninfectious complications (175 of 213 [82.2%];
P < .001) than those with mild or moderate scores (mild score:
infectious, 98 of 1176 [8.3%] and noninfectious, 519 [44.1%];
moderate score: infectious, 79 of 670 [11.8%] and noninfec-
tious, 442 [66.0%]). Longer duration of urethral catheter use
was also associated with more reported infectious and non-
infectious complications. Medical or surgical indication for
catheter placement was not significantly associated with in-
fectious complications. Noninfectious complications, how-
ever, were reported by a higher percentage of patients with a
catheter inserted due to urinary retention or bladder obstruc-
tion. In a multivariable analysis adjusting for demographic and
clinical characteristics (eTable 3 in the Supplement), the sex-
relateddifferenceremainedsignificantonlyforinfectiouscom-
plications (incident rate ratio [IRR] for female patients, 2.11;
95% CI, 1.59-2.79; P < .001). Moderate and severe AUA symp-
tom index scores and urinary catheter duration of more
than 3 days remained significantly associated with both in-
fectious and noninfectious complications (eTable 3 in the
Supplement).
Discussion
This prospective cohort study of urethral catheter–
associated complications conducted at 4 US medical centers
in 2 states has 3 key findings. First, the overall patient-
reported complication rate of indwelling urethral catheter use
was found to be 57.0%, higher than what is commonly re-
ported in the literature.7,9 Second, noninfectious complica-
tions were reported 5 times more often than infectious com-
plications. However, women were almost twice as likely to
report an infectious complication (15.5% vs 8.6%), while men
weremorelikelytoreportanoninfectiouscomplication(58.6%
vs 47.3%). Finally, more than one-third of patients with cath-
eters in place reported restrictions in activities of daily living
(39.5%) and social activity (43.9%). These findings are novel,
relevant to patient safety, and could not have been uncov-
ered without direct follow-up in our study of patients who had
been catheterized.
Other investigators have also evaluated the noninfec-
tious complications of urethral catheters, albeit without the

 direct patient perspective. For example, Leuck et al7 prospec-
tively reviewed the medical records at a single Veterans
Affairs hospital to evaluate both the infectious and traumatic
complications associated with the use of an indwelling ure-
thral catheter. When reports of traumatic episodes associ-
ated with pain or that required intervention were compared
with episodes of symptomatic urinary tract infection (the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention’
s current focus for sur-
veillance and treatment), trauma was significantly more com-
mon than infection (0.9 per 100 catheter-days vs 0.3 per 100
catheter-days; P < .001).7 Using administrative data on surgi-
cal procedures, Aaronson et al8 concluded that catheter-
associated complications were reported rarely but were sig-
nificantly associated with increased length of hospital stay and
catheter-associated urinary tract infection rates. Awad and
colleagues15 conducted a legal database review of the associa-
tion of urethral catheters with medical malpractice from 1965
to 2015 and reported that the most common malpractice claim
was traumatic insertion of a urethral catheter (48% of claims).
These investigators noted that several of the lawsuits in-
volved a spouse who claimed loss of consortium (deprivation
of the benefits of a family relationship because of injuries
caused by the tort). Finally, Davis and colleagues16 followed
up patients at 2 tertiary care hospitals in Ireland for 6 months
and reported an incidence of traumatic urethral catheteriza-

incremental health care costs.
Ourfindingsconfirmtheimportanceofnoninfectiouscom-

received care at 4 different medical centers. We also received
patient-reported accounts about their experience with the use
of the catheter. Many patients complained about the indwell-
ing catheter. For example, one patient reported, “I never want
another Foley catheter. Hurts like hell!” Another reported that
the catheter was “uncomfortable, cumbersome, and difficult
to sleep with.” Many patients noted that the removal process
was very painful: “It felt like it was cutting me coming out.”
Not all patients reported negative personal experiences with
the indwelling catheter. A few patients contacted viewed the
urethral catheter favorably: “It was my first experience with
a catheter; it wasn’
t too bad.”
We prospectively followed up a large cohort to identify
complications that resulted from urethral catheterization and
were described by patients rather than relying on informa-
tion that may be documented in the medical record or may be
available through secondary data sources. This information
providedauniqueandimportantperspectiveonpotentialcom-
plications that may concern patients and may occur outside
the hospital setting. For example, urine leaking from the cath-
eter when the device was in place or from the urethra after it
had been removed was an issue for many patients. As one pa-
tient stated, “I wasn’
t given any instruction on how to handle
a leak”; this incident resulted in his researching information
on the internet. Our study extended understanding of ure-
thralcatheter–associatedcomplicationsbyalsoidentifyinglife-
style issues—such as sexual problems—that are important to
patients. In the words of one patient, “I am mostly dissatis-
fied with my urinary condition because I have not been able
to have sex in a very long time.”
The analysis also identified sex-related differences in re-
ported complications, which makes some sense given the ana-
tomical differences of the genitourinary tracts. Women are at
higherriskforcatheter-associatedurinarytractinfectionsthan
men because they have shorter urethras and closer proximity
of perineal bacterial colonization to the insertion site of the in-
dwelling catheter.17 For male patients, complications poten-
tiallyassociatedwiththepresenceofanenlargedprostategland
(eg, urinary retention) were seen more commonly than the
same complications in women. Although male sex was no lon-
ger an independent risk factor for noninfectious complica-
tionswhenassessedinamultivariablemodelincludingtheAUA
symptom index score, this is likely linked to collinearity with
the AUA symptom index score.
Our findings have clinical implications. We should
launch efforts to reduce the noninfectious complications of
urethral catheters in the same way that we have used collab-
orative efforts to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract
infections in some patient populations.18,19 Attention to the
technical aspects of proper catheter insertion and mainte-
nance as well as increased focus on reducing unnecessary
catheter insertions and unnecessary days of catheterization
duration seem likely to reduce noninfectious and infectious
complications. As Meddings and colleagues20 concluded in a
systematic review of 30 studies, reminders about an indwell-
ing urinary catheter and stop orders should be used to
improve patient safety because these approaches will reduce
both types of catheter complications. The indwelling urethral
catheter has even been referred to as a “1-point restraint,”21
which underscores the importance of limiting the use of
catheters. Strategies for better tracking and surveillance of
noninfectious complications, such as major trauma or bleed-
ing, should also be considered. Incorporating what happens
after the hospital stay may fully capture possible complica-
tions of this invasive procedure.
Limitations
This study should be interpreted in the context of the follow-
ing limitations. We conducted this study in the United States
at 4 sites within 2 states, and we included only patients who
received an indwelling catheter during acute care hospital-

 ization. Thus, the findings may not be generalizable to all
patients who receive a urethral catheter, such as those who
are evaluated in the emergency department for urinary
retention and discharged to home. We might expect worse
outcomes in these patients; they often have difficulty
obtaining timely follow-up care for removal of the catheter.
Also, one of the sites contributed modestly to the overall
number of patients enrolled for reasons primarily related to
a population of younger patients who had a low baseline
need for indwelling urethral catheters. In addition, the infor-
mation was collected directly from the patient. Although
patient-reported complications may not constitute a medi-
cally defined complication because of well-known poor
documentation of urethral catheter complications,22 we
believe that what patients report is important to understand
the full scope of potential problems. Without an approach to
validate their reports, however, inclusion of patient-reported
complications could result in an overestimate of true medi-
cal complications.
Conclusions
We provided important estimates of the burden of complica-
tions due to the use of this device. We also provided a foun-
dation for interventional studies to further ameliorate com-
plications associated with catheter use. Urethral catheters,
which are often used to help safely manage care of the pa-
tient during hospitalization, often lead to the opposite result.
Inlightofthefrequencywithwhichurethralcathetersareused,
we should consider not only infectious complications but also
the noninfectious complications associated with these cath-
eters as key areas of possible harms and thus vital targets for
future prevention efforts.
