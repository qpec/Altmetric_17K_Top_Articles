Abstract
Background: Phase 3 trials supporting dextromethorphan/quinidine (DM/Q) use as a treatment for pseudobulbar
affect (PBA) were conducted in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or multiple sclerosis (MS). The PRISM II
study provides additional DM/Q experience with PBA secondary to dementia, stroke, or traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Methods: Participants in this open-label, multicenter, 90-day trial received DM/Q 20/10 mg twice daily. The primary
outcome was the Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS), assessing change in PBA episode frequency and
severity. The CNS-LS final visit score was compared to baseline (primary analysis) and to the response in a previously
conducted placebo-controlled trial with DM/Q in patients with ALS or MS. Secondary outcomes included change in
PBA episode count and Clinical Global Impression of Change with respect to PBA as rated by a clinician (CGI-C) and by
the patient or caregiver (PGI-C).
Results: The study enrolled 367 participants with PBA secondary to dementia, stroke, or TBI. Mean (standard deviation
[SD]) CNS-LS score improved significantly from 20.4 (4.4) at baseline to 12.8 (5.0) at Day 90/Final Visit (change, −7.7 [6.1]; P
< .001, 95 % CI: −8.4, −7.0). This magnitude of improvement was consistent with DM/Q improvement in the earlier
phase-3, placebo-controlled trial (mean [95 % CI] change from baseline, −8.2 [−9.4, −7.0]) and numerically exceeds the
improvement seen with placebo in that study (−5.7 [−6.8, −4.7]). Reduction in PBA episode count was 72.3 % at Day
90/Final Visit compared with baseline (P < .001). Scores on CGI-C and PGI-C showed that 76.6 and 72.4 % of participants,
respectively, were “much” or ”very much” improved with respect to PBA. The most frequently occurring adverse events
(AEs) were diarrhea (5.4 %), headache (4.1 %), urinary tract infection (2.7 %), and dizziness (2.5 %); 9.8 % had AEs that led to
discontinuation. Serious AEs were reported in 6.3 %; however, none were considered treatment related.
Conclusions: DM/Q was shown to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for PBA secondary to dementia, stroke, or
TBI. The magnitude of PBA improvement was similar to that reported in patients with PBA secondary to ALS or MS, and
the adverse event profile was consistent with the known safety profile of DM/Q.

Background
Affective lability is a commonly described sequela of
multiple neurologic disorders and brain injury. Pseudo-
bulbar affect (PBA) is a type of affect lability character-
ized by sudden, involuntary, and distressing outbursts of
laughing and/or crying that are often exaggerated or dis-
connected from mood state or social context [1–3]. PBA
episodes tend to be stereotypical, can last from seconds
to several minutes, and often occur multiple times per
day. PBA is thought to occur as a result of injury or dis-
ease that disrupts pathways regulating emotional expres-
sion, or affect, including the corticobulbar tracts and
basal ganglia [4, 5]. PBA is diagnosed clinically through a
medical and neurologic evaluation and a careful assess-
ment of symptoms in order to distinguish it from features
of other psychiatric or neurobehavioral conditions such as
depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress dis-
order, dementia-related agitation and other conditions
that can occur separately or comorbidly with PBA in per-
sons with neurologic diseases or brain injuries [2].
PBA episodes can be highly disruptive to everyday life,
causing embarrassment, social isolation and, in some
cases, impacting the ability to work [6]. Prevalence esti-
mates vary by rigor of diagnostic requirements, screen-
ing methodology, and causative neurological disorder;
however a registry sample of 5,290 clinic patients with 1
of 6 neurologic conditions known to be associated with
PBA—Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
amyotrophic
lateral
sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s dis-
ease (PD), stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI)—
found 36.7 % had a Center for Neurologic Study-Lability
Scale (CNS-LS) score ≥13, a score that predicted neur-
ologist diagnosis of PBA in validation studies for 82 % of
patients with ALS and 78 % with MS; 9.3 % of this regis-
try sample had a CNS-LS ≥21 [5]. Other studies report
PBA symptom prevalence between 7 and 39 % among
participants with dementia [5, 7, 8], 5 to 48 % among
those with TBI [7, 9, 10], and 11 to 34 % following stroke
[11–13]. However, in everyday practice, PBA symp-
toms are generally under-recognized due to lack of
routine screening, limited awareness of the condition
and confusion with other neuropsychiatric conditions
[3, 7, 14]. Various drugs have been studied as treat-
ments for PBA, including tricyclic antidepressants and
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors,
though
no
agents in these drug classes have been approved for
this use [15].
Dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sul-
fate in the fixed combination NUEDEXTA® (DM/Q;
commercially available since 2010 from Avanir Pharma-
ceuticals, Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) is currently the
only pharmaceutical agent approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration for the treatment of PBA [16].
DM, the CNS-active component of the medication, is a
weak,
uncompetitive
N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA)
receptor antagonist, a sigma-1 receptor agonist, a sero-
tonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and an
α3β4 neuronal nicotinic receptor antagonist [17–19].
However, the mechanism whereby DM exerts its clinical
effects is not fully elucidated. Normally, DM is rapidly me-
tabolized through the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6)
isoenzyme to dextrorphan, a metabolite that is rapidly glu-
curonidated, limiting its CNS bioavailability when DM is
administered at approved doses. When administered
alone, DM achieves only minimal plasma exposure. Low-
dose quinidine (10 mg) is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome
P450 2D6 that, when combined with DM, substantially in-
creases DM bioavailability and enables greater central ner-
vous system exposure. Well-controlled Phase 3 studies
have shown that the DM/Q combination is efficacious for
the treatment of PBA [20–22], and is significantly more
efficacious than DM alone or Q alone [22].
The DM/Q combination was approved in the United
States for the treatment of PBA, irrespective of the type
of neurologic etiology, as a result of phase 3 trials in par-
ticipants with PBA secondary to ALS or MS [20–22].
Across the phase 3 trials in patients with MS or ALS,
DM/Q was generally safe and well tolerated [20–22]. In
addition, DM/Q was found to be generally well toler-
ated in a long-term, 52-week safety trial that enrolled
participants with PBA associated with a wide range of
underlying neurological conditions [23]. To date, there
have been only limited clinical trial data evaluating
the safety and efficacy of DM/Q for PBA in specific
and well-defined patient populations beyond MS and
ALS.
The purpose of the present study (referred to as the
Pseudobulbar Affect Registry Investigating Symptom
Management II [PRISM II] trial) was to provide data on
the effectiveness of DM/Q for the treatment of PBA sec-
ondary to dementia, stroke, and TBI. This article de-
scribes the findings for outcomes common to the overall
study population. Outcomes in individual neurologic
disease cohorts are reported separately [24–26].

 Methods
Study design
The study measured effectiveness by evaluating efficacy,
safety/tolerability and other patient outcomes when used
under usual conditions in patients with dementia, stroke,
or TBI. Adults with PBA secondary to dementia, stroke,
or TBI and a CNS-LS score ≥13 (scale range, 7 [no
symptoms] to 35 [maximum]) were enrolled in an open-
label, 90-day study of DM/Q 20/10 mg twice daily (once
daily during Week 1). Clinical assessments were per-
formed at baseline, Day 30, and Day 90, with a telephone
contact at Day 60. This study was conducted in the
United States at 74 enrolling sites, from 26Feb2013 to
30Apr2015, according to Good Clinical Practice and the
Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol and study mate-
rials were approved by the institutional review board at
each site and registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov. (iden-
tifier: NCT01799941).
Participants
Participants were eligible for enrollment if they had a
clinical diagnosis of PBA based on published criteria and
a clinical diagnosis of dementia, stroke, or TBI [2]. PBA
diagnostic criteria were (1) involuntary or exaggerated
episodes of emotional expression (i.e., laughing or cry-
ing); (2) development of symptoms that represent a
change from the person's usual emotional reactivity oc-
curring subsequent to a specified brain disorder; (3) epi-
sodes are incongruent with or out of proportion to the
individual's mood state and independent to or in excess
of a provoking stimulus; and (4) symptoms are not bet-
ter accounted for by another disorder, substance abuse,
or medication use. Patients were also required to have a
CNS-LS score ≥13 [27, 28], the same score required for
entry into phase 3 trials of DM/Q for PBA [20–22].
Eligible participants had documented diagnoses of one
of the following: dementia, (including Alzheimer’s, vas-
cular, Lewy body, or frontotemporal dementia; ischemic
or hemorrhagic stroke; or mild, moderate, or severe
non-penetrating TBI. There were no restrictions on
types of allowed concomitant medications with the ex-
ception of those contraindicated by the US Prescribing
Information [16], specifically monoamine oxidase inhibi-
tors (MAOIs), and drugs that both significantly prolong
QT interval and are primarily metabolized by CYP2D6
(e.g., thioridazine). Other medications typically used by
patients with the studied neurologic conditions (includ-
ing those that are metabolized by CYP2D6) were allowed
with the stipulation that medications for management of
dementia, such as memantine or acetylcholinesterase in-
hibitors should be stable for at least 6 weeks and other
neuropsychiatric medications such as anticonvulsants,
antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and sedative/
hypnotics should be stable for at least 2 months prior to
baseline; any medication changes, if deemed necessary,
were recorded. Potential participants were excluded if
they had severe dementia (Mini-Mental State Examin-
ation [MMSE] score <10); stroke within 3 months of
study enrollment; penetrating TBI; severe depressive dis-
order; history or current symptoms of schizophrenia (in-
cluding psychosis), schizoaffective disorder or bipolar
disorder;
substance/alcohol
abuse
in
the
preceding
3 years; systemic disease, neurologic condition or brain
injury that was unstable or rapidly changing within the
3 months prior to enrollment; life expectancy ≤6 months;
contraindication to DM/Q use (including known QT
interval prolongation); DM/Q use during the previous
6 months; or interventional clinical study participation
within the preceding 30 days. Written informed consent
was obtained from all participants or from legally autho-
rized representatives.
Outcome measures
Primary measure
The primary outcome was the change in CNS-LS score
from baseline to Day 90 (or final visit). The CNS-LS was
completed by the patient or the caregiver acting as a pa-
tient proxy at Day 1 (baseline), Day 30 (visit 1), and Day
90 or early withdrawal (final visit). The CNS-LS is a 7-
item (4 laughing items; 3 crying items), self-report rating
scale measure of PBA episode frequency and severity
that was validated in persons with ALS and persons with
MS and is sensitive to change over time and treatment
effects [20–22].
Secondary measures
Secondary measures included PBA episode count for the
7 days preceding each study visit as well as the Clinical
Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) and Patient (or
Caregiver) Global Impression of Change (PGI-C; 7-point
scales ranging from 1 [very much improved] to 7 [very
much worse]) based on overall change in the patient’s
condition with respect to PBA. In addition, a quality-of-
life visual analog scale (QOL-VAS) assessed the degree
to which PBA episodes affected the patient’s overall
quality of life (11-point scale ranging from 0 [“not at
all”] to 10 [“significantly”]) during the past week and a
5-point Likert-type scale rated patient satisfaction with
treatment from 1 [very dissatisfied] to 5 [very satisfied].
The Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE;
11-item assessment of orientation, memory, attention,
and language scored from 0 to 30) was included as a
cognitive assessment [29]. As an additional measure, the
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; a 9-item assess-
ment of depression symptoms with each item rated 0
[not at all] to 3 [nearly every day] based on frequency of
occurrence over the past 2 weeks, for a total possible
score
of
27)
was
included
[30].

 functional measures, namely the Neurobehavioral Func-
tioning Inventory and Stroke Impact Scale were assessed
in the TBI and stroke cohorts, respectively, and will be
reported separately. Caregivers were allowed to complete
all assessments except the MMSE for any patients who
were unable to do so. The timing of assessments is illus-
trated in Fig. 1.
Safety
Safety measures included reporting of adverse events (AEs)
occurring at any time between study enrollment and up to
30 days after the last dose of DM/Q in the study, as well as
vital signs and concomitant medication use.
Statistical analysis
The safety analysis set included all participants who re-
ceived at least 1 dose of DM/Q. The effectiveness ana-
lysis set comprised all participants in the safety set who
also met all study eligibility criteria, and completed at
least 1 post-baseline CNS-LS assessment. The Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 15.1) was
used for coding, categorizing, and reporting AEs.
All data were analyzed descriptively. Changes from
baseline in ratings at Day 30 and 90 were also analyzed
inferentially using one-sample t-tests for rating scale
measures (CNS-LS, QOL-VAS, MMSE, and PHQ-9) and
a mixed-effects Poisson regression model using number
of PBA episodes in the past 7 days as the dependent
variable to estimate change in PBA episode counts. The
mixed-effects Poisson regression model incorporated
age, gender, and time (Day 30 and Day 90) as fixed ef-
fects while allowing for individual differences in baseline
rate (random-subject effects). The percentage change

 episode count from baseline to a given visit is 1 minus
the appropriate time parameter (λ).
There was no imputation method for missing data;
however, if the patient had a Final Visit, that visit was in-
cluded as the Day 90 Visit. If there was no Final Visit,
the Day 30 visit was not carried forward as the subject’s
Final Visit.
The primary analysis tested the null hypothesis that the
mean change in CNS-LS score from baseline to the Day
90/Final Visit was equal to zero; the 95 % confidence
interval (CI) was also reported to enable a descriptive
comparison with the CNS-LS change seen in the pivotal
phase 3 registration trial (STAR trial) that led to the US
approval of DM/Q for PBA [20]. Pearson correlation coef-
ficients were calculated to assess the correlation of CNS-
LS scores with other endpoints at baseline, Day 30, and
Day 90/Final Visit, as well as correlation of change from
baseline in CNS-LS with changes in other measures.
Tests of significance were 2-tailed and carried out at the
α = .05 level of significance; all analyses were completed
using either SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) or
Stata v12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). All patients
with data for the given comparison were included.
A power calculation was based on mean (SD) CNS-LS
change observed from the pivotal phase 3 trial for the
same dose of DM/Q (20/10 mg twice daily): −8.2 (6.1)
points vs. placebo: −5.7 (5.3) points. Based on these re-
sults, it was determined that a sample size of 100 pa-
tients per disease group would provide 80 % power to
detect a CNS-LS mean change of −7.45 points (increase
of 1.75 points over assumed true placebo mean change
of −5.7), or 90 % power to detect a CNS-LS mean
change of −7.7 points (increase of 2.0 points over as-
sumed true placebo mean change of −5.7). An interim

 (regardless of cohort) completed the study, supported
these assumptions of magnitude of the effect and indi-
cated that a sample size of 100 per disease group would
provide sufficient (≥80 %) power to meet the protocol-
specified endpoints. In addition to the results for the en-
tire study population described here, pre-specified ana-
lyses for the three distinct diagnosis groups (Dementia,
Stroke, and TBI cohorts) were conducted separately and
have either been reported in full (Dementia [24]) or have
manuscripts in preparation (Stroke [26] and TBI [25]).
Results
Patients
Of the 394 participants screened, 367 participants with
PBA (134 with dementia, 113 with stroke, and 120 TBI)
were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of DM/Q; 271
(73.8 %) completed the study through Day 90. Partici-
pant disposition is shown in Fig. 2; early discontinuation
from the study occurred most commonly because of
AEs (9.3 %) and withdrawal of consent (5.7 %). Sixty-
nine patients (18.8 %) were excluded from the effective-
ness analysis set because of one or more of the follow-
ing: lack of post-baseline CNS-LS score (n = 41), failure
to meet all study eligibility criteria (n = 23), and/or site
noncompliance (n = 11). A total of 297 patients were in-
cluded for the Day 30 efficacy analysis, while 261 had
evaluable data at Day 90. The baseline demographic and
clinical characteristics of the enrolled cohort (safety ana-
lysis set) are described in Table 1. The mean (SD) pa-
tient age was 59.4 (16.5) years; 17 % lived in a skilled
nursing or assisted living facility, and 45 % had a
caregiver. In addition, the mean (SD) CNS-LS score
at baseline was 20.5 (4.4) and median PBA episode
count for the 7 days prior to baseline was 12 (range:
0, 240). Study participants were receiving a median of
7 [0–27] concomitant medications at baseline; the
majority (70.8 %) were using least one psychiatric
medication, most commonly antidepressants (48.5 %;
Table 1). Nearly three quarters (73.0 %) had concomi-
tant cardiovascular disease at baseline, most com-
monly
hypertension
(57.8
%)
or
hyperlipidemia
(44.4 %), and the majority (88.6 %) had another cen-
tral nervous system disorder, most commonly depres-
sion (57.5 %) and anxiety disorder (42.2 %).
Primary efficacy endpoint
Figure 3 depicts the mean (SD) CNS-LS scores at each
assessment. Compared with the baseline CNS-LS score,
mean (SD) CNS-LS scores at Day 30 (n = 297) and Day
90/Final visit (n = 261) were 15.0 (5.0) and 12.8 (5.0) and
represent a statistically significant improvement from
baseline (mean [SD] change at Day 30 of −5.4 [5.5]; 95 %
CI: −6.1, −4.8; P < .001 and Day 90/Final visit of −7.7 [6.1;
95 % CI: −8.4, −6.9]; P < .001). Improvement at Day 90/
Final Visit was consistent with that reported for the same
dose of DM/Q in the 12-week phase 3 pivotal trial that
enrolled patients with PBA secondary to ALS or MS
(mean [95 % CI] change from baseline, −8.2 [−9.4, −7.0])
and represents an improvement over the placebo group
from that study (−5.7 [−6.8, −4.7]).
Secondary analyses
PBA episode counts over the 7 days prior to study visit
decreased from a median of 12 at baseline to 4 at Day
Fig. 3 Mean (SD) CNS-LS Score at Baseline, Day 30, and Day 90 (Effectiveness Analysis Set). CNS-LS scores range from 7 to 35, with higher scores
indicating increased frequency and severity of PBA episodes. P values are based on the one sample t-test and represent comparison with baseline.

 30 and 2 at Day 90. PBA episode frequency by study visit
is shown in Fig. 4, using the mixed-effects Poisson
model estimates. PBA episodes were reduced overall by
an estimated 57.5 % at Day 30 and 72.3 % at Day 90
compared with baseline (P < .001 for both). Remission of
PBA episodes (defined as no reported episodes in the
week before assessment) was reported by 20.3 % of the
sample at Day 30 and 35.4 % at Day 90.
Global ratings by clinicians and participants/caregivers
indicated the majority believed that during study treatment
there had been substantial overall improvement with re-
spect to PBA (Fig. 5). At Day 90/Final Visit, 76.6 % of pa-
tients were rated by their clinician as “very much
improved” or “much improved” on CGI-C and 72.4 % of
participants (or caregiver proxies) rated themselves as
“very
much
improved”

exaggerated or uncontrollable laughing and/or crying over the previous 7 days (prior to visit) at baseline, Day 30, and Day 90. Estimated percent
change from baseline for PBA episode count was evaluated via a mixed-effects Poisson regression model for the effectiveness analysis

patients reported being “minimally worse” or “much
worse” on PGIC (0.8 %) and 3 were reported to be
“minimally” or “much worse” on CGIC (1.1 %). No
patient was reported as “very much worse” on either
measure.

asked about
satisfaction
with the
treatment, 47.5 % of participants (or caregivers) indi-

fied, 11.5 % neutral, 5.4 % somewhat dissatisfied, and
7.7 % very dissatisfied.
The mean QOL-VAS rating of PBA episode impact
on quality of life, the PHQ-9 depressive symptom
measure, and the MMSE cognitive measure all im-
proved during the study. QOL-VAS scores improved
from a mean (SD) of 5.9 (2.6) at baseline to 2.7 (2.6)
at Day 90/Final Visit (mean [SD] change from base-
line, −3.1 [3.2]; P < .001). PHQ-9 scores improved from
mean (SD) 13.5 (5.9) at baseline (moderate depression) to
7.5 (5.5) at Day 90/Final Visit (mild depression), represent-
ing a mean [SD] change from baseline of −5.6 [6.2] points
(P < .001)); mean (SD) MMSE scores increased from 23.9
(5.9) at baseline to 24.3 (6.0) at Day 90/Final Visit (mean
change from baseline, 0.60 (3.0); P < .01). For the cor-
relation analysis, CNS-LS score reduction from base-
line
to
Day
90
was
significantly
correlated
with
improvements in all secondary outcomes (weekly PBA
episode rate, QOL-VAS, PGI-C, CGI-C, PHQ-9, and
treatment satisfaction; all P < .001) except change in
MMSE (Table 2).
Safety
AEs are summarized in Table 3. Of the 367 participants
who received DM/Q and comprised the safety set, 132
(36.0 %) reported at least 1 AE, including the 55
(15.0 %) who reported at least 1 AE deemed at least
possibly related to DM/Q. The most frequently reported
AEs were diarrhea (5.4 %), headache (4.1 %), urinary tract
infection (2.7 %), and dizziness (2.5 %). Most AEs were of
mild or moderate intensity; severe AEs occurred in 6.0 %
of participants. In total, 36 (9.8 %) participants had
AEs that led to study withdrawal, most commonly for
diarrhea (8 [2.2 %]), dizziness, affective lability, and
agitation (3 [0.8 %] each. Twenty-three (6.3 %) partici-
pants experienced a serious AE; no serious AE was con-
sidered treatment related by the study investigators. Two
deaths occurred during the study (two males ages 91 and
83 years with dementia); both were deemed not related to
study drug after careful review by the investigators and
were reported in the dementia cohort manuscript [24].
Discussion
Earlier placebo-controlled trials performed with DM/Q
included persons with PBA secondary to MS or ALS.
The PRISM II open-label, 90-day trial provides expanded
Fig. 5 90-Day Clinical and Patient Global Impression of Change (Effectiveness Analysis Set). CGI-C is a 7-point investigator-rated scale that assessed
overall treatment response (with respect to PBA) from baseline to Day 90/Final Visit, rated as very much improved, much improved, minimally
improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, or very much worse. PGI-C is a 7-point patient/patient’s caregiver rated scale that assessed
overall treatment response (with respect to PBA) from baseline to Day 90/Final Visit, rated as very much improved, much improved, minimally
improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, or very much worse. CGI-C = Clinical Global Impression of Change; PGI-C = Patient/Caregiver

 safety and efficacy data for DM/Q in a broader patient
population and is the first prospectively conducted, sys-
tematic study to evaluate DM/Q effectiveness for PBA
occurring subsequent to dementia, stroke, or TBI. The
inclusion criteria defined within this trial allowed for a
patient population that more closely resembles “real-life”
clinical circumstances (e.g., participants in this trial were
taking a median of 7 concomitant medications, about
half were on antidepressants and nearly 20 % were in an
assisted living or skilled nursing facility).
Substantial improvement in clinical symptoms of PBA
were seen at both post-baseline assessments with a −7.7
point (SD 6.1) reduction in CNS-LS score and a 72.3 %
reduction in PBA episode frequency at Day 90/Final
visit, both of which represented statistically significant
differences compared with baseline. Improvements were
consistent across the three cohorts including patients
with stroke, dementia and TBI. The mean (12.8) CNS-
LS score at study endpoint was below the minimum
threshold required for study inclusion. Since this study
allowed caregivers to complete assessments for patients
who were unable to do so, the planned statistical ana-
lyses allowed for an evaluation of caregiver-completed
vs. patient-completed outcomes. This was done for the
dementia cohort, and as previously described, caregivers
generally reported greater PBA symptom change than
patients, but between group differences were only statis-
tically significant (P < .001) for the estimated PBA epi-
sode count reduction (57.7 % for patient-reported vs.
77.2 % for caregiver-reported ratings) [24].
Improvement was also observed in all other second-
ary endpoints, including a clinical meaningful reduc-
tion in PHQ-9 scores (minimal clinically important
difference for the PHQ-9 has been estimated to be a
5 point change [31]; mean change observed in this
trial was −5.6). In addition, DM/Q was well tolerated,
with 9.8 % of participants having AEs leading to dis-
continuation; the most frequent AEs were diarrhea
(5.4 %), headache (4.1 %), urinary tract infection
(2.7 %), and dizziness (2.5 %).
Clinical implications
Although the present study was open label, results ap-
pear to be clinically meaningful, consistent across study
cohorts,
and
consistent
with
those
seen
in
well-
controlled, phase 3 trials of DM/Q. The clinical rele-
vance of CNS-LS score reductions from baseline to Day
90/Final Visit is reflected in corresponding reductions in
PBA episodes and improvements on other secondary
measures, including clinician and patient global impres-
sions with respect to PBA and satisfaction with treat-
ment.
CNS-LS
reduction
was
moderately
but
significantly correlated with improvements in all second-
ary outcomes (weekly PBA episode rate, QOL-VAS,
PGI-C, CGI-C, PHQ-9, and treatment satisfaction; all P
< .001) with the exception of the MMSE. While the mea-
sured outcomes are directionally related, the lack of
strong correlation (all Pearson’s coefficients were < .5)
suggests that changes in CNS-LS and other outcomes
are not solely reflective of changes in PBA episode num-
ber and may reflect other aspects of PBA episodes, such
as episode intensity, subjective perception, functioning
related to these episodes, or other factors not readily ap-
parent from these data.
A pre-specified analysis for this trial assessed the 95 %
CI for mean change from baseline in CNS-LS scores in
order to enable descriptive comparisons with the earlier
placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial in patients with PBA
secondary to ALS or MS [20]. Although drug perform-
ance
cannot be
directly
compared across different

 clinical trial populations and settings, PBA symptom im-
provement with DM/Q in the current open-label trial is
consistent with what was observed with DM/Q in the
pivotal Phase 3 trial published by Pioro et al. [20], with a
magnitude of improvement larger than observed for the
group randomized to placebo in that study. These find-
ings are also consistent with two other earlier Phase 3
randomized, controlled trials examining the effect of
DM/Q for PBA in patients with MS or ALS (range, 7.4–
7.7; Fig. 6). CNS-LS reductions were similar across all 3
disease cohorts included in this PRISM II trial (demen-
tia, stroke, and TBI; range, 7.2–8.5; Fig. 6) [24–26].
Taken together, data from PRISM II expand on prior ob-
servations of the utility of DM/Q for PBA in MS and
ALS and provide consistent and clinically meaningful
evidence of DM/Q effectiveness for PBA in patients with
3 additional common, and disparate neurological etiolo-
gies, namely dementia, TBI and stroke.
DM/Q was associated with low incidence of overall
AEs (36 %), treatment-related AEs (15 %), and AEs
leading to withdrawal (9.8 %). Commonly encountered
AEs were consistent with the safety data from con-
trolled studies with DM/Q and information included
in the approved product label; no new safety signals
emerged in this clinical trial, and none of the re-
ported serious AEs (6.3 %) were deemed by investiga-
tors to be treatment related.
Limitations of this study are primarily related to its
open-label design without an active or placebo compara-
tor group. In addition, use of self-reported measures
may
be
susceptible
to
subjective
bias
based
on
observations by patient, caregiver, or investigator. Lastly,
the criteria for the effectiveness analysis population that
required patients to meet all exclusion and inclusion cri-
teria may have introduced bias.
The CNS-LS is validated as a predictive screening
assessment for PBA episode frequency and severity
based on studies in patients with ALS and MS; [21,
22] however, this scale has not been specifically vali-
dated for use in screening in patient populations with
dementia, stroke, and TBI. Even so, changes in CNS-
LS in this study were consistent with improvements
in several other measures of clinical relevance for
PBA (e.g. frequency of PBA episodes), and prior epi-
demiological studies have shown that CNS-LS scores
increase with perceived PBA episode burden [5].
Conclusions
Study findings showed that DM/Q 20/10 mg adminis-
tered twice daily in non-blinded fashion over 12 weeks
to participants with PBA secondary to dementia, stroke,
or TBI was generally well tolerated and was associated
with improvements in CNS-LS scores and reductions in
PBA episodes. These observations are consistent with
those seen in the well-controlled phase 3 trials of DM/Q
conducted in those with PBA secondary to ALS or MS.
Improvement in PBA symptoms was associated with clin-
ically meaningful improvements in CGI-C and PGI-C rat-
ings with respect to PBA. The effectiveness of DM/Q for
PBA secondary to these conditions is consistent with the
proposed pathophysiology of PBA, which suggests symp-
toms arise when there is disruption or damage to brain
