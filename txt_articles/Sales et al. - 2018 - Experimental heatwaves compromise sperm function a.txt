Climate change is affecting biodiversity, but proximate drivers remain poorly understood.
Here, we examine how experimental heatwaves impact on reproduction in an insect system.
Male sensitivity to heat is recognised in endotherms, but ectotherms have received limited
attention, despite comprising most of biodiversity and being more influenced by temperature
variation. Using a flour beetle model system, we find that heatwave conditions (5 to 7 °C
above optimum for 5 days) damaged male, but not female, reproduction. Heatwaves reduce
male fertility and sperm competitiveness, and successive heatwaves almost sterilise males.
Heatwaves reduce sperm production, viability, and migration through the female. Insemi-
nated sperm in female storage are also damaged by heatwaves. Finally, we discover trans-
generational impacts, with reduced reproductive potential and lifespan of offspring when
fathered by males, or sperm, that had experienced heatwaves. This male reproductive
damage under heatwave conditions provides one potential driver behind biodiversity declines
and contractions through global warming.

arth’s climate is changing1, and natural populations are
responding to unnatural temperature changes by shifting
ranges, declining and going extinct2–4. There are hundreds
of studies describing concordant declines, extinctions or range
shifts across a diversity of taxa in terrestrial, marine and fresh-
water ecosystems that can be explained by climate change4–6.
Despite all this, we have “disturbingly limited knowledge”7 on the
proximate causes behind these changes, and systematic experi-
ments on specific vulnerabilities and mechanistic drivers have
been prioritised to enable biodiversity predictions8. Here, we
apply such an experimental approach to understand how climate
change influences a key biological trait for population viability by
investigating the detailed impacts of heatwave conditions on
reproductive function in a model insect system.
With a warmer, more volatile atmosphere, extreme climatic
events such as heatwaves are predicted to become more
common9,10. Heatwaves, commonly defined as conditions when
daily thermal maxima exceed the average local maximum by 5 °C
for more than 5 days11, are predicted to become longer10,12, more
intense13,14, more frequent9,15 and more widespread11. Because
they generate unusually extreme thermal conditions, with often
short and stochastic onsets, heatwaves are likely to be particularly
disruptive for biological function16. Heatwaves have substantial
and recognised impacts on human activity and health17, with the
2003 summer heatwave across Europe being responsible for
70,000 deaths18. However, consequences for biodiversity have
received far less attention, despite increasing recognition of the
significance of Extreme Climatic Events for ecological systems8,19,
and some evidence of the potential for heatwaves to substantially
impact biodiversity20.
Reproductive sensitivity to increases in temperature that
organisms often experience in the natural environment is well
known in mammals, where adaptations that allow testicular
cooling of 2 to 8 °C below core body temperature are essential to
allow normal male fertility21. Even mild increases in the ambient
thermal environment can disrupt male reproductive function in
endotherms: for example, exposing male mice for 24 h to an air
temperature of 32 °C resulted in fertility declines of ~75%22, and a
number of similar studies reveal such sensitivities21,23. By con-
trast with the research on endotherms, however, very limited
attention has been given to ‘cold blooded’ taxa24. This is sur-
prising, because the vast majority of biodiversity is comprised of
ectothermic taxa25, where biological functions are more directly
influenced by changes in the thermal environment26. Reproduc-
tive sensitivity to temperature is known in Drosophila melano-
gaster with most populations becoming non-viable above 30 °C,
the temperature where male reproduction ceases24,27. There is
local adaptation to this male sensitivity, with temperate Droso-
phila populations failing to reproduce at lower thermal thresholds
than tropical strains27, but details of the causes and wider con-
sequences of reproductive compromise in ectothermic taxa
remain a ‘significant but neglected phenomenon’24. Using a series
of experiments with a model insect system, we first measure the
impact of heatwave conditions on reproductive performance of
males and females, then identify specifically how key traits are
impacted, and finally evaluate their wider transgenerational
consequences.
We performed experiments using the red flour beetle Tribo-
lium castaneum, an endopterygote coleopteran with develop-
mental and reproductive physiology representative of most insect
groups, and therefore relevant to a huge number of ectotherms,
many of which are under threat from climate change26,28. T.
castaneum
occupies
tropical
and
warm-temperate
thermal
niches29, where most terrestrial biodiversity exists30. We found
that heatwave conditions (5 to 7 °C above the system’s optimum29
for 5 days) damaged male reproductive potential, whereas females
were largely unaffected. Heatwaves halved male male fertility, and
compromised sperm competitive ability. Successive heatwaves
exacerbated these effects, with a second heatwave inducing almost
complete sterility in males. Inseminated sperm within female
storage were also sensitive to thermal stress, reducing the female’s
subsequent reproductive fitness following a heatwave. Using
in vivo and in vitro assays, we found that heatwaves reduced
sperm number and viability, and compromised their ability to
reach female storage for fertilisation. We also found transge-
nerational impacts of heatwaves: reproductive potential of male
offspring was significantly reduced if they had been fathered by
males or sperm that had previously experienced thermal stress,
and offspring lifespan was shortened if fathers had experienced a
heatwave. We therefore find in a model insect that male repro-
duction and sperm function are widely damaged by heatwave
conditions, providing one explanation for how population via-
bility could be compromised by global warming.
Results and discussion
Heatwave impacts on sex-specific reproductive output. We
found clear evidence that male reproduction was sensitive to
thermal stress. Males exposed to a single heatwave showed a
significant reduction in their subsequent ability to sire offspring,
more than halving reproductive output following a 42 °C heat-
wave, compared with either 35 or 30 °C controls (Fig. 1; Table 1).
By contrast, female reproductive output was unaffected by the
same heatwave conditions (Fig. 1). We therefore reveal the
characteristic male-specific sensitivity of reproductive output to
thermal conditions in our insect model, as recognised in some
endotherm
groups21,23,
and
recently
in
a
few
ectotherm
species24,31–39. We also discovered that heatwave conditions
impaired male reproductive competitiveness, reducing the num-
ber of offspring sired by second-mating males within two-male
sperm competitions from 80 to 30% (Fig. 2b; Table 1). Since
polyandrous mating and post-copulatory sperm competition is
the standard route to fertilisation in the majority of species40,
particularly insects41, these findings reveal a significant impact on
male reproductive fitness within the relevant context of sperm
competition41. Finally, we assessed impacts of additional heat-
waves on male reproductive output, and find no evidence for
short-term acclimation or ‘hardening’ to thermal stress so that
reactions to subsequent heatwaves are better resisted. Instead, the
impact of a second heatwave, 10 days after the first, was additive
or even multiplicative, with males becoming almost completely
sterile following a second 5-day heatwave that is 7 °C above the
35 °C optimum for population productivity in T. castaneum
(Fig. 2c).
Heatwave impacts on mating behaviour and fertility. Having
identified male-specific sensitivity to heatwave conditions in
competitive and non-competitive contexts, we determined which
mechanisms and drivers explained this loss of reproductive per-
formance. Detailed assays of male mating behaviour revealed that
heatwave conditions subsequently increased the latency before a
male’s first successful mating, prolonged the duration of copu-
lation and decreased the frequency of mating (Supplementary
Figure 1; Table 1). However, these males were still able to achieve
an average of five copulations per female per hour through their
1-h observation period (compared with eight matings by
untreated control males, Supplementary Figure 1a). Moreover,
dissections of 36 females paired for 1 h with males that had been
previously exposed to 42 °C heatwaves revealed that every male
had successfully transferred sperm. A single mating in T. casta-
neum is sufficient for females to fertilise ~700 eggs across four
months of oviposition42, so the findings that heatwaved males

 mated an average of five times across only 1 h of observation, and
all successfully transferred sperm, indicate that changes to male
mating behaviour could not explain the 50% reduction in male
reproductive performance following heatwave exposure (Fig. 1).
Instead, we found that the reduction in reproductive output is
primarily explained by male failure to stimulate female fecundity
and fertilise eggs through to hatch: females mated to heatwave-
exposed males reduced the number of eggs they laid by one-third
(Supplementary Figure 2; Table 1), and only 40% of these eggs
successfully hatched, contrasting with normal hatch rates of ~90%
(Fig. 3h; Table 1). Once successfully hatched, offspring develop-
ment through the larval and pupal stages was unaffected by the
heatwave exposure of males (Fig. 3h).
Heatwave impacts on sperm function. Further experimental
assays were conducted (see Methods) to identify the mechanisms
explaining this decline in male fertility, and we found clear and
profound impacts on the production and subsequent function of
spermatozoa. Males exposed to 42 °C heatwaves showed a 75%
reduction in ejaculate sperm number (Fig. 3a). Observationally,
sperm masses dissected from the spermatophores deposited by
heatwave-treated males also contained obvious quantities of
globular detritus, while ejaculates from control males showed no
such detritus and only contained sperm cells (Supplementary
Figure 3). It was not possible to quantify this detritus as it was
bound within the sperm mass, and broke up as the sperm mass
was dispersed for counting, but its appearance and position
within the spermatophore sperm mass was consistent with it
being material from damaged and degraded sperm cells. These
observations were further confirmed by analyses of sperm
viability: in addition to the 75% reduction in sperm number, only
one-third of sperm cells produced by males following heatwave
conditions were alive, whereas more than 80% of sperm cells
produced by control males were viable (Fig. 3c, f, g). Finally, by
tracking the in vivo presence and position of Green Fluorescent
Protein-labelled (GFP) sperm43 within the female reproductive
tract, we confirmed a significant reduction in the transfer and
storage of sperm by heatwave-exposed males into the bursa
copulatrix and spermatheca, both of which are important sites for
short-term
and
long-term
fertilisation
storage
in
T.
castaneum42,43. The amount of GFP-labelled sperm present in
these sites 24 h after mating was reduced by two-thirds when
females had mated with males previously exposed to 42 °C
heatwave conditions (Fig. 3b, d, e), either as a consequence of
lower sperm densities, or due to reduced GFP excitation asso-
ciated with dying sperm.
Although we found that females showed reproductive tolerance
to thermal stress, we also discovered that inseminated sperm were
sensitive to heatwaves, thereby causing a secondary loss of
reproductive fitness. Experimentally mated females containing
mature sperm already transferred to storage in the bursa
copulatrix and/or spermatheca showed 33% declines in repro-
ductive output following heatwave exposure, compared to age-
matched females who were exposed to heatwaves before mating
and sperm storage (Fig. 2a). In almost all internally fertilising
ectotherm animals, representing the majority of eukaryotic
biodiversity25, females store sperm in specialised organs to allow
fertilisation and reproduction to take place independent of the
presence of mating males44. The finding that sperm are sensitive
to heatwave conditions once stored within the female tract
therefore has relevance for reproduction and population viability
across a significant fraction of global biodiversity.
Our combined results demonstrate that male reproductive
performance is specifically sensitive to heatwave conditions
through thermal damage to fertility and sperm competitiveness,
and that these conditions cause reductions in sperm number,
migration to female storage and viability. Although female
reproduction is intrinsically unaffected by exposure to the same
thermal conditions, we identify population vulnerability through
inseminated sperm held in female storage also being specifically
sensitive to heatwave conditions. Although our experiments focus
on temperature, spermatozoa are among the most complex and
diverse eukaryotic cell types45, with functional sensitivities to

 physiological46 and genetic47 stress, so our findings may also be
due to a general spermatozoal susceptibility to stress. In addition,
we exposed adult beetles to temperature increases for 5 days in
order to replicate heatwave conditions, however, recent work has
shown that thermal impacts on reproduction can also occur over
relatively short windows of more acute exposure48,49. Whichever
of these situations apply, our combined findings could shed light
on why populations have declined as a result of increased thermal
or general stress from climate change2–4,6,7,19,20.
Transgenerational impacts of heatwaves. In addition to these
direct effects, we also discover a less noticeable, longer-term
impact of heatwaves: transgenerational damage. Using two-
generation experiments (Methods), we found that the adult life-
span of offspring sired by males that had previously experienced
40 °C heatwaves was reduced significantly compared to the
longevity of offspring sired by controls (Fig. 4a, b; Table 1).
Similarly, we found that the reproductive potential of sons fath-
ered by heatwave-exposed males was reduced when they were
given the opportunity to mate with multiple females (Fig. 4c, d, e,
f). Sons of males that had been exposed to a single heatwave in
the previous generation showed a 25% reduction in mating suc-
cess and subsequent offspring production, compared with con-
trols whose fathers had not experienced heatwave conditions
(Fig. 4c, d). Critically, these same transgenerational effects were
also evident when mature inseminated sperm alone had experi-
enced the same conditions within the female: sons fertilised by
heatwave-exposed spermatozoa in the female tract suffered 25 to
40% reductions in their reproductive output and mating success,
compared with sons from parents where the mother had
experienced the heatwave before mating and sperm storage, or
controls where no heatwaves were experienced (Fig. 4e, f).
Transgenerational fitness damage is known to occur in a range
of species as a consequence of stressors such as irradiation50, toxic
chemicals51, sensory perturbations52 and ageing53. This damage
has
also
been
found
to
compromise
male
reproductive
function54,55. In a recent study exposing field crickets (Gryllus
bimaculatus) to 24 and 28 °C regimes, the warmer treatment
when exposed to adult males was found to reduce ejaculate sperm
number (with the reverse effect seen when 28 °C exposure took
place through the pre-adult stages as well)39. Adult males exposed
to the warmer 28 °C regime also fathered offspring that exhibited
reduced survival (and again the reverse effect was seen with
improved offspring survival if warmer 28 °C exposure occurred
throughout development)39. In this study, we believe we present
the first evidence for significant negative transgenerational effects
as a consequence of heatwave exposure in the parental generation
specifically through thermal impacts on mature, inseminated
spermatozoa stored within the female reproductive tract. Such
damage could occur through physical damage to the paternal
haplotype within the sperm nucleus, possibly as a result of
thermal impacts on DNA fragmentation and mutations56,57.
Oocyte and zygote cell repair mechanisms can reverse sperm
DNA damage through embryogenesis58, but this may not be
possible following our heatwave treatment conditions if the DNA
damage is sufficiently severe. Alternatively, epigenetic alterations
to gene expression following heatwave conditions may arise
through changes to chromatin condensation59,60, methylation61
and/or non-coding RNA transfer62. We urge future research into
(1) the molecular basis of this transgenerational heatwave
damage, (2) whether females have evolved mate choice strategies
to avoid male-derived thermo-sensitive infertility and (3) for the
consequences of our findings of heatwave damage to male
reproductive function to be examined in a broader range of taxa.
Methods
Stock culture maintenance. The red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum is a
tractable research model for studying reproduction29,64,65. We used the outbred
‘Kraków Super Strain’ (KSS) created in 2008 by combining 35–60 individuals from
11 different strains to promote genetic diversity66. Stocks were maintained under
standard conditions (30 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 5% RH and 16L: 8D photoperiod) in ad libi-
tum fodder consisting of organic flour and yeast (9:1 by volume) topped with oats
for traction65. Populations were maintained as non-overlapping generations,
renewed every 35 days by transferring ~300 sexually mature adults to fresh fodder
for 7 days mating and oviposition, then removing adults to allow egg and larval
development. Unless otherwise stated, all individuals used in experiments were
sexed as pupae, kept in single-sex groups of 20 individuals in 5 cm petri dishes to
eclosion and sexual maturity at 12 ± 2 days, then randomly assigned to treatments.
During maturation, one sex was identified with a dot on the dorsal thorax using
correction fluid (Tippex, France). This marking method has no significant effect on

 reproductive output across 20 days of oviposition (marked versus unmarked
females χ2(1,36) = 0.7, P = 0.407; z = −0.8, P = 0.407, n = 19 + 19).
Heatwave conditions. Heatwave treatments exposed individuals for 5 days to
temperatures that exceeded the optimum by 5 °C, corresponding with the common
definition of a heatwave event14. The optimum temperature for population pro-
ductivity in T. castaneum is 35 °C29,67, which our assays confirmed (Fig. 1).
Experimental heatwaves therefore exposed individuals to temperatures of 40 to 42
± 1 °C. These conditions have been recorded in the natural environment across
more than 90 countries68. Heatwave conditions were applied using Octagon 20
incubators (Brinsea Ltd, UK), and the humidity of all treatments was maintained at
60 ± 5% RH. Beetles were exposed to heatwaves in single-sex groups of 20 indi-
viduals in 5 cm petri dishes containing standard fodder and positioned in the
central plane of the incubator. Temperatures did not exceed 1 °C above or below
the treatment set point, checked using a 35–45 °C mercury incubation thermo-
meter (G.H. Zeal Ltd, Zeal House, 8 Deer Park Road, London, SW19 3UU, U.K.)
calibrated to United Kingdom Accredited Service standards (Charnwood Instru-
mentation Services Ltd, 81 Park Road, Coalville, Leicestershire, LE67 3AF, UK).
Following treatments, all individuals experienced 30 ± 1 °C for 24 h, before running
reproductive output assays at 30 ± 1 °C.
Reproductive output: heatwave impacts on adults. Supplementary Figure 4a
presents these experimental protocols. Reproductively mature males and females
were exposed to 5-day thermal treatments at 30 °C (nMales = 79, nFemales = 75), 35 °
C (nM = 33, nF = 34), 38 °C (nM = 48, nF = 43), 39 °C (nM = 43, nF = 35), 40 °C
(nM = 48, nF = 35), or 42 °C (nM = 42, nF = 28). After treatment, and a further 24 h
at 30 °C, they were monogamously paired with untreated mates for 2 days at 30 °C
in 4 ml vials containing 0.5 g flour and yeast topped with oats. Following mating,
males were removed and females isolated in 5 cm petri dishes for oviposition into
7 g flour and yeast with 3 g of oats on the surface for 20 days at 30 °C, using two
separate 10-day blocks to reduce overlapping generations (Supplementary Fig-
ure 4a). After removing the female at day 20, eggs and larvae produced over this
period were left to develop in standard conditions at 30 °C for 35 days until they
emerged to be counted as mature adults. Reproductive output of each breeding pair
was therefore the number of offspring successfully produced over 20 days of
oviposition, which correlates significantly with lifetime output and accounts for
~50% of a female’s total potential reproductive output under similar conditions
across 150 days of oviposition66.
Reproductive output: heatwave impacts on sperm in females. Supplementary
Figure 4b presents these experimental protocols. Impacts on individual sperma-
tozoa were measured by exposing sperm stored within the reproductive tract of
mated females to heatwave conditions, comparing against females which received
the same heatwave treatment but immediately prior to mating and sperm storage
(Supplementary Figure 4b). Thus, females were either mated, then exposed to
heatwaves (n = 62); or exposed to heatwaves, then mated (n = 55). Following either
treatment, females were transferred to 5 cm petri dishes for oviposition across three
separate 5-day blocks under standard conditions, counting the number of offspring
produced after 35 days of development. Five-day blocks were applied so that we
could control for any differential sperm ageing effects that may have occurred
between insemination and the period of reproductive fitness measurement:
reproductive output by females in the ‘sperm + female heated’ treatment was
compared across the first 10 days of oviposition following treatment (and therefore
5 days following the timing of insemination), whereas output in the ‘unmated
female heated’ was compared following oviposition from day 5 to 15 (again, 5 days
following insemination). We also ran comparisons of reproductive output for all
15 days of oviposition. Both comparisons showed significant 26 to 31% declines in
female reproductive output when females had been exposed to heatwave conditions
containing sperm in storage. Results controlling for sperm age and comparing
reproductive output across 10 days of oviposition are in the main document and
Fig. 2a. Comparisons of the total 15 days of reproductive output yielded similar
results with significant declines in reproductive output when sperm had experi-
enced heatwave conditions within female storage (χ2(1,115) = 17.1, P < 0.001;
z = −4.1, P < 0.001).
Reproductive output: heatwave impacts on sperm competition. Supplementary
Figure 5 presents these experimental protocols. To assess impacts within the
relevant context of sperm competition, we measured how heatwave conditions
influenced a male’s subsequent ability to win fertilisations within females that had
previously been mated to untreated, marker males. Males were sexed as pupae, and

 then isolated from eclosion until experimental mating to standardise and prevent
any confounds from uncontrolled same-sex behaviour activity69. Treatment males
were exposed to 5 days at 30 °C (controls) or 42 °C (heatwaves), followed by 24 h at
30 °C. During this 24 h period, control females were mated to ‘Reindeer’ marker
males. The Reindeer (Rd) mutation for clubbed antennae is dominant and main-
tained homozygous in our stock. Offspring sired by Reindeer males will inherit the
clubbed antennae phenotype, whereas offspring sired by the wild type males
develop normal filiform antennae, allowing paternity to be assigned treatment
group males70. After 24 h mating with Rd males, females were then mated with
either control (n = 65) or heatwave-treated (n = 51) males for 24 h, and then
transferred to oviposit individually in 5 cm petri dishes for 7 days. Following
oviposition, offspring were left to develop for 35 days, after which the relative
numbers of wild type and Rd offspring were counted to measure differences in
paternity and relative sperm competitiveness between the heatwave and control
male treatment groups.
Reproductive output: double heatwave impacts. Supplementary Figure 6 pre-
sents these experimental protocols. To measure the impact of additional heatwaves,
adult males were exposed to three treatments: (1) Control: 5 days of exposure to
30 °C (n = 20); (2) Single heatwave: 5 days of heatwave exposure at 42 °C (n = 35);
and (3) Double heatwaves: 5 days of heatwave exposure at 42 °C followed by
10 days at 30 °C followed by a second 5 days of heatwave exposure at 42 °C
(n = 29). Following each treatment, males were maintained for 24 h at 30 °C before
being monogamously paired to untreated adult mature females for 2 days in 4 ml
vials, after which females were transferred individually to 5 cm petri dishes for
20 days of oviposition in standard conditions, across two 10-day blocks. After
20 days, females were removed and all offspring allowed to develop for 35 days so
that offspring production could be counted. To minimise developmental effects
through initial spermatogenesis, all males were reproductively mature (12 ± 2 days
post eclosion) and received their initial 5-day treatments simultaneously, with
males in group 3 experiencing their second heatwave at age 27 ± 2 days post
eclosion. Thus, all males were reproductively mature when exposed to single or
double heatwaves (Supplementary Figure 6).
Heatwave impacts on male mating behaviour. Males sexed as pupae were
individually isolated before their mating behaviour assay to prevent any same-sex
activity and to standardise all individuals prior to each trial64,69. At adult maturity,
males were exposed for 5-day treatments at 30 °C (n = 25), 39 °C (n = 24), 40 °C
(n = 21), 41 °C (n = 24) or 42 °C (n = 14), followed by 24 h at 30 °C (Supple-
mentary Figure 4c). Following treatment, males were paired with untreated control
females at 30 °C in 1 cm2 mating arenas for 1 h, and all mating activity video-
recorded using Sony digital video cameras. Replaying the 1-h film sequence for
each pair, we recorded: (1) the period of latency to first mating, (2) the total
number of matings and (3) the duration of each mating. Matings were defined
when the pair achieved unbroken mounting and copulatory contact for more than
35 s, which is the average minimum time for successful spermatophore transfer in
T. castaneum71.
To assess the probability of subsequent spermatophore transfer in matings by
males previously experiencing heatwave conditions, we ran an additional assay in
which males (n = 36) that had previously received a 5-day 42 °C treatment were
paired monogamously with untreated females for 1 h in 1 cm2 mating arenas, after
which females were frozen at −20 °C, before being dissected to check for successful
sperm transfer.
Impacts on fertility, fecundity and offspring development. Supplementary
Figure 4e presents these experimental protocols. To determine whether the decline
in male reproductive fitness following heatwave exposure was a consequence of (1)
reduced egg hatch (fertility), (2) reduced numbers of eggs produced (fecundity), or
impacts on offspring development through the (3) larval and 4) pupal stages, we
ran breeding assays to measure separate impacts on each (Supplementary Fig-
ure 4e). Males exposed to either 30 °C control or 42 °C heatwave conditions fol-
lowed by 24 h at 30 °C were then paired monogamously with untreated and

 unmated females in 0.5 g flour and yeast topped with oats for 2 days at 30 °C. After
mating, females were transferred to individual 4 ml vials with 0.5 g of pre-sieved
flour and yeast topped with oats for oviposition under standard conditions. Every
2 days (and therefore before egg hatch) through a 10-day oviposition period,
females were transferred to new vials, and eggs in the fodder sieved out using
300 μm mesh (Endecotts Ltd., London, UK). Separated eggs were dispersed on
black tiles using a fine paintbrush and counted under a Zeiss Stemi 2000-C ste-
reomicroscope at ×10 magnification to give a fecundity measurement for control
(n = 59) and heatwave treatments (n = 76). For a random subset of the control
(n = 40) and heatwave (n = 40) treatments, all eggs were returned immediately to
5 cm petri dishes containing 7 g of pre-sieved fodder to allow development. Ten
days later, after which all successfully fertilised eggs would have hatched (egg
development to hatch takes ~4 days under standard conditions in T. castaneum29,
early stage larvae were sieved again from the fodder within each 2-day oviposition
block and counted to provide egg hatch scores, before being returned to fodder.
Twenty days later, pupae were counted in each block to quantify successful larval
development and, at 35 days, when all hatched eggs, larvae and pupae would have
developed to successful eclosion, adult offspring were counted.
Heatwave impacts on ejaculate sperm counts. Mature males were exposed to 5-
day treatments of either 30 °C control (n = 36) or 42 °C heatwave (n = 56)
conditions, then paired with a series of five mature untreated and unmated females
in 1 cm2 mating arenas. Each male was paired with a female for 15 min, before
being transferred to the next female. Access to a series of females allowed us to
measure the rate of successful sperm transfer, and increased the probability that a
male would transfer at least one spermatophore successfully to allow sperm
counting (Supplementary Figure 4d). Immediately following each 15-min mating
period, females were frozen at −20 °C for subsequent dissection and sperm count.
Females were dissected in saline buffer (1% NaCl solution) under a Zeiss Discovery
V.12 stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) under ×20 magnification.
Using fine forceps, the female tract was removed, the bursa copulatrix cut open,
and the tract then separated from any spermatophore which was isolated in 100 µl
of saline buffer on a cavity slide. The spermatophore was then broken apart using
size 0 dissection pins and the sperm mass released and dispersed into the buffer,
before being washed off the slide and into a 10 ml tube using 3 ml of distilled water
expelled from an autopipette. Each solution was then gently mixed before taking
three 20 µl subsamples which were placed on flat glass slides to dry as smears. After
air-drying, the slides were dipped gently into distilled water to remove any
desiccant, and re-dried. Sperm cells (including their component parts, see below)
adhere to the glass and were counted within each smear using dark field phase-
contrast microscopy at ×200 magnification on an Olympus BX41 microscope
(Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan)72. Because many sperm cells had suffered
membrane disruption and separation into their two elongate mitochondrial

 derivatives, possibly due to freeze damage, sperm number in each smear was
determined by counting the total number of mitochondrial derivatives divided by
two, added to the total number of undamaged sperm cells in each smear. The
average sperm count for the three smears was then multiplied by their dilution
factor (×155) to calculate total spermatophore sperm count.
Heatwave impacts on sperm migration in the female tract. Heatwave impacts
on sperm function and distribution following insemination were assayed using
males from a T. castaneum strain modified to incorporate a green fluorescent
protein (GFP) into sperm chromatin43, enabling imaging of sperm distribution
within the semi-transparent female reproductive tract (Fig. 3). Before mating,
mature GFP males were exposed to 5-day treatments of either 30 °C control
(n = 22) or 41 °C heatwave conditions (n = 24), followed by 24 h at 30 °C. Fol-
lowing treatment, GFP males were paired with mature untreated and standard KSS
females for 90 mins. Following insemination, and to allow sperm to exit the
spermatophore completely and reach longer-term storage in the bursa copulatrix
and spermatheca42,43,64, females were snap-frozen 24 h after mating at -80 °C. The
intact reproductive tracts of these females were then removed through micro-
dissection of defrosted specimens under a Zeiss Discovery V.12 stereomicroscope
(Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) in Grace’s insect buffer (Thermo Fisher, Massachu-
setts, USA). Following removal of the complete tract, the ovaries were separated
from the upper tract, and the lower tract then excised from the oviduct’s junction
with the ovipositor, keeping the main tract containing the bursa copulatrix, sper-
matheca and any sperm intact. This tract was then placed in 30 µl of Grace’s buffer
on a slide and sealed under a 20 × 20 mm coverslip with impermeable instant
contact adhesive (EVO-STIK, UK), before imaging using Zeiss Axiocam and
Axiovision hardware and software.
Supplementary Figure 4d and 7 present these protocols. To visualise fluorescing
sperm, brightfield and fluorescence images were acquired through a Zeiss ×10, 0.3
NA Plan-Neofluar objective on an AxioPlan 2ie microscope and captured with an
Axiocam HRm CCD camera and Axiovision 4.8.2 software. Greater resolution of
the smaller spermatheca was achieved through a Zeiss ×20, 0.6 NA Plan-
Apochromat objective. GFP fluorescence, primarily from sperm, was excited
through a 472 ± 15 nm excitation filter, and emitted fluorescence collected through
a 520 ± 17.5 nm emission filter. General autofluorescence (AF) was excited through
a 562 ± 20 nm excitation filter, and the emitted fluorescence collected using a 624 ±
20 nm filter. Exposure times were kept constant between samples. Images (14-bit
greyscale) of the female tract and stored sperm were analysed using a custom-
written macro in Fiji (ImageJ, ver. 1.49k)73 (Supplementary Figure 7). The macro
subtracted background in each channel image using a rolling ball radius of 25
pixels for the smoothing algorithm74. To remove autofluorescence from the GFP-
channel image so that only GFP sperm fluorescence was visible75, the macro
corrected each GFP-channel image as follows: a region of interest (ROI) was
created manually in the AF-channel in an area of the image displaying high
fluorescence but no corresponding fluorescence in the GFP-channel image, the
mean intensity was then measured in this ROI (IntAuto). The typical structure for
this ROI was the chitinous ring at the base of the spermathecal duct
(Supplementary Figure 7c). The same ROI was then applied to the GFP-channel
image and the mean intensity measured (IntGFP). A correction factor (CF) was
determined by dividing IntGFP by IntAuto. The AF-channel image was multiplied by
CF and the resultant corrected AF image subtracted from the GFP-channel image,
leaving only GFP sperm-derived fluorescence for measurement (Supplementary
Figure 7d). The brightfield image was then used to define the ROI to be analysed by
manually drawing around each tract’s perimeter walls (Supplementary Figure 7a,
d). The mean pixel intensity within this ROI was then determined, providing a
measure of the presence and distribution of GFP sperm in each tract.
Heatwave impacts on sperm viability. The impacts of heatwave conditions on
mature sperm viability were measured from spermatophores transferred at mating
to control females following exposures of mature males for 5 days at either 42 or
30 °C, and 24 h at 30 °C for both groups (Supplementary Figure 4d). Because males
exposed to heatwaves can take longer to mate (Supplementary Figure 1), 42 °C
heatwaved males were paired with untreated and unmated females for 210 min
(n = 16) before dissection, and 30 °C control males for 90 mins (n = 10). Females
were dissected immediately after their pairing period, with the protocol following
that for sperm counts, apart from modifications for sperm viability staining and
visualisation. Once spermatophores had been separated from the female bursa
copulatrix, they were held in 30 µl of Grace’s insect buffer (Thermo Fisher, Mas-
sachusetts, USA) on a cavity slide. Having gently dispersed the sperm mass with
size 0 dissection pins, sperm cells were stained with 2 µl of a 15-fold dilution of 2.4
mM propidium iodide and 2 µl of a 10-fold dilution 1 mM SYBER-14 dye from the
LIVE/DEAD Sperm Viability Kit L-7011 (Molecular Probes, Oregon, USA). The
sperm solutions were then sealed within the slide cavity using a 20 × 20 mm cov-
erslip, and incubated for 5 mins at 27 ± 2 °C to allow stain uptake. Following
incubation, image analysis took place using Zeiss Axiocam and Axiovision hard-
ware and software. Sperm heads were imaged in (1) red and (2) green fluorescence
channels, and (3) Differential Interference Contrast (for detecting non-stained
sperm). All sperm observed in the viability assay took up the stain to fluoresce
either red or green (Fig. 3).
Following staining and incubation using the LIVE/DEAD Sperm Viability Kit
L-7011, differential-interference contrast and fluorescence images were acquired
using a Zeiss ×20, 0.6 NA Plan-Apochromat objective on a AxioPlan 2ie
microscope at ×200 magnification. Within 60 min of dissection, six images were
captured at randomly selected locations across each diluted, incubated and stained
sperm sample using a Axiocam HRm CCD camera. Propidium iodide fluorescence
was excited using a 562 ± 20 nm excitation filter, and the emitted fluorescence
collected with a 624 ± 20 nm filter. SYBER-14 fluorescence was excited with a 472
± 15 nm excitation filter, and the emitted fluorescence collected through a 520 ±
17.5 nm emission filter. Using the L-7011 Sperm Viability Kit (Molecular Probes,
Oregon, USA), live sperm with intact membranes take up the by SYBER-14 stain
and their heads fluoresce green, while dead cells take up propidium iodide and
fluoresce red. The proportion of viable sperm in each sample was calculated as the
average (across the six subsamples) total number of live sperm, divided by the
average total number of live sperm plus average total number of dead sperm.
Counts were manual and based on colour dyed heads. Sperm survival has been
previously shown to correlate with the number present76 therefore, sperm count
was included as a random factor in a Generalised Linear Mixed Model77 (see Data
Analysis).
Transgenerational impacts of heatwaves. Supplementary Figure 4f presents
these experimental protocols. Consequences of heatwave conditions for the
reproductive performance and lifespan of adult offspring in the next generation
were measured following thermal exposure to males (sires), females (dams) and
inseminated sperm held in female storage. Two assays were conducted to assess
transgenerational heatwave effects on (1) offspring adult lifespan in both sexes, and
(2) male offspring reproductive performance. Offspring mortality rates and lifespan
were compared between adult offspring groups that had either been sired by males
previously exposed to a 5-day heatwave at 40 °C (n = 28), or by control males
exposed to 5 days at 30 °C (n = 29) (both groups held for 24 h at 30 °C before
mating). Protocols to generate offspring followed those to measure reproductive
fitness, after which adults were isolated individually in 4 ml vials with 0.5 g flour
and yeast topped with oats under standard conditions at 30 °C. Mortalities were
recorded and fodder refreshed every month for up to two years, after which all
adult offspring had died. Lifespan was therefore measured in non-competitive and
non-reproductive conditions, without adult interaction and with ad libitum food,
providing a fair measure of intrinsic mortality in the absence of social, mating and
environmental pressures. For each adult cross (40 °C heatwave n = 28 and 30 °C
control n = 29), four adult offspring were randomly assigned and measured in the
lifespan assay. Previous measures showed that sex ratios within offspring groups
sired by males previous exposed to heatwave conditions did not depart from unity:
average % male across n = 17 offspring groups = 51% (±2.36); Wilcoxon test of
male proportion versus 0.5: V17 = 79; P = 0.59.
In the second transgenerational fitness assay, we measured impacts of
heatwaves in the previous generation on the reproductive performance of F1 male
offspring. Parental adults were either exposed to 42 °C heatwaves for 5 days
followed by 24 h at 30 °C, or as 30 °C controls throughout. These control and
heatwave treatments were exposed to both male and female adults to assess
transgenerational effects upon male offspring reproductive fitness. Male (sire)
effects were measured following exposure to 30 °C control (n = 42) and 42 °C
(n = 48) heatwave conditions. Female (dam) and sperm-in-storage effects (dam +
sperm) were measured following exposure to: (i) 30 °C control conditions in
unmated females (dam alone control, n = 27), (ii) 42 °C heatwave conditions for
unmated females (dam alone heatwave effect, n = 42), and (iii) 42 °C heatwave
conditions for mated females carrying sperm in storage (dam plus sperm heatwave
effect, n = 34). Following treatment, offspring were generated as in the
reproductive output assays (Supplementary Figure 4a), and individual sons isolated
at the pupal stage within those pairs producing offspring for subsequent assay. A
single son was assayed from each of the parental crosses to standardise family
effects. Because male T. castaneum have high reproductive potential65, we
compared between treatment groups using an assay in which reproductive
performance of individual males was measured following opportunities to mate
with a series of 13 control unmated mature females, each provided to the male in
1 cm2 mating arenas for 30 min. After each 30-min access period, females were
removed and exchanged for a new unmated female. Males were therefore tested for
their ability to mate with and fertilise up to 13 females across a 6.5 h mating trial.
Following each 30-min mating opportunity, females were transferred to 5 cm petri
dishes for oviposition into 7 g flour and yeast, and 3 g of surface oats in standard
30 °C conditions across two 10-day blocks, as in the reproductive fitness assay
(Supplementary Figure 4a). After oviposition, eggs were left to develop in standard
conditions for 35 days, after which the total number of adult offspring produced,
and the number of successful matings (evidenced by some offspring production),
were counted. Our two scores of individual male reproductive performance were
therefore: (1) the total number females successfully inseminated across the
sequence of 13, and (2) the total number of offspring sired across the 6.5 h mating
trial.

 Descriptive statistics (mean ± S.E.) were calculated by ‘describeBy{psych}’81.
Exploratory analysis included distribution plotting and conservative non-
parametric testing on ranks prior to fitting generalised linear models (GLMs) with
‘glm{stats}82’. Heatwave treatments were entered into analyses as fixed factors.
Where sampling structure variables (=blocks or experimental repeats) were
present, either group averages were calculated, or generalised linear mixed models
(GLMMs) were fitted83, using ‘glmer{lme4}’84. Cases where individuals died
midway through assays were excluded.
The most appropriate error distribution for each GLM(M) was selected by
examining diagnostic residual plots66,83,85 using ‘Plot{graphics}’86 and ‘mcp.fnc
{LMERConvenienceFunctions}’87. Count response variables, which included all
experiments measuring reproductive fitness, sperm counts, fecundity and number
of mating events, were initially analysed using a Poisson distribution with a log link
function. Model fits were checked and over-dispersion, where the variance exceeds
the mean, was assessed in GLMs using by ‘dispersiontest{AER}’88, and in GLMMs
using an over-dispersion function66. Where over-dispersion was present, usually
due to zero-inflation in the heatwave treatments, corrections were applied by fitting
a different error distribution (producing theta ~1)66. For moderate over-dispersion
(1 < theta < 20), a quasi-Poisson error with a log link function was fitted. For strong
over-dispersion (theta > 20), a negative binomial model with log link was fitted
using ‘glm.nb{MASS}’89 (see Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 for model errors
and link functions). Continuous variables (mating duration and GFP sperm density
distributions) were initially fitted using a Gaussian distribution with an identity
link function, however, both had positively skewed residuals and outliers66. Model
fits were improved for mating duration by using a log link function. Proportion
response variables, which included paternity share in sperm competitions, sperm
viability, and hatching, pupation and eclosion success, were fitted using a binomial
distribution and a logit link function. Response variables were entered as a two
column matrix of success-and-fail using cbind(success, fail){base}66. Where over-
dispersion was present, usually due to zero-inflation in the heatwave treatments, it
was corrected for by fitting a quasi-binomial distribution with a logit link
function66. (See Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 for model errors and link
functions).
After each maximal model was fitted, the statistical significance of the
experimental treatment variables were assessed using Akaike’s Information
Criterion (AIC) comparisons, and log likelihood ratio tests (LLRT) with, and
without, the term of interest83. The most efficient models had significantly lower
AICs90,91. LLRTs were χ2 tests when the response variable was a count or
proportion, and F tests when continuous66. LLRTs were primarily computed with
‘drop1{stats}’;66,78,83 ‘drop1{stats}’ was not compatible with quasi-error
distributions, so was substituted for ‘lrtest{lmtest}’92. Simple post-hoc comparisons
between treatment groups and controls were derived from summary(model)85,93.
Post-hoc pairwise Tukey comparisons were applied using ‘lsmeans{lsmeans}’94. As
a measure of how much variation in the response variable was explained by the
model, pseudo R2 (explained deviance) was calculated for GLMs66. For GLMMs, ‘r.
squaredGLMM{MuMIn}’95 reported the marginal R2 explained by the fixed factors,
and conditional R2 for the fixed and random factors.
