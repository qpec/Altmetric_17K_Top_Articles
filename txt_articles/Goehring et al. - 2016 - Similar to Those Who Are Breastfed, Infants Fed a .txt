Abstract
Background: Evidence suggests that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) provide multiple benefits to infants, including
prebiotic effects, gut maturation, antimicrobial activities, and immune modulation. Clinical intervention studies with HMOs
are required to confirm these benefits in infants.
Objective: Our objective was to investigate the effects of feeding formulas supplemented with the HMO 2#-fucosyllactose
(2#-FL) on biomarkers of immune function in healthy term infants.
Methods: We performed a substudy nested within a randomized, double-blind, controlled growth and tolerance study in
healthy singleton infants (birth weight $2490 g) who were enrolled by 5 d of life and exclusively formula-fed (n = 317) or
breastfed (n = 107) from enrollment to 4 mo of age. Formula-fed infants were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 formulas,
all containing 2.4 g total oligosaccharides/L [control: galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) only; experimental formulas: GOS + 0.2
or 1.0 g 2#-FL/L], and compared with a breastfed reference group. For this substudy, blood samples were drawn from infants
at 6 wk of age (n = 31–42/group). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated for cellular phenotyping and
stimulated ex vivo with phytohemagglutinin for proliferation and cell cycle progression or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
Cytokine concentrations were measured in plasma and in ex vivo–stimulated culture supernatants.
Results: Breastfed infants and infants fed either of the experimental formulas with 2#-FL were not different but had
29–83% lower concentrations of plasma inflammatory cytokines than did infants fed the control formula [interleukin (IL)
receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a)] (P # 0.05). In ex vivo RSV–stimulated
PBMC cultures, breastfed infants were not different than either of the groups fed formula with 2#-FL, but they had lower
concentrations of TNF-a (31%) and interferon g (IFN-g; 54%) (P # 0.05) and tended to have lower IL-1ra (25%) and IL-6
(38%) (unadjusted P # 0.05) and IL-1b (30%) (unadjusted P = 0.06) than did infants fed the control formula.
Conclusions: Our data indicate that infants fed formula supplemented with 2#-FL exhibit lower plasma and ex vivo
inflammatory cytokine profiles, similar to those of a breastfed reference group. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov
as NCT01808105.

Introduction
Breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition for infants. There is
considerable evidence that human milk–fed infants have a lower
rate of infection than those fed infant formula, suggesting that diet
may influence the neonatal immune system (1–4). Preclinical research
indicates that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs)8 enhance gut
maturation; act as prebiotics, antiadhesives, and antimicrobials; and
directly modulate immune responses; thus, they may play an
important role in the protective health effects of breast milk (5, 6).
There are >100 milk oligosaccharides in human milk, and 20 of
them are referred to as major HMOs (7). Mature human milk
contains 5–15 g oligosaccharides/L, representing the third largest
solid component after lactose and lipids, and are present at >100-
fold higher concentrations than are found in bovine milk (8, 9).
Concentrations of HMOs vary among individuals and over the
course of lactation (7, 9–11), the most abundant of which is
2#-fucosyllactose (2#-FL), which ranges from 0.06 to 4.65 g/L
(12). Consumed oligosaccharides remain mostly undigested and

 are found in the feces of breastfed infants at higher concentrations
than in maternal milk. These oligosaccharides are also found at
low concentrations in the infant�s circulation and urine. The
profiles of these plasma, urinary, and fecal HMOs resemble that
of the infant�s mother�s milk (10, 13, 14).
In a current study, lacto-N-fucopentaose II (LNF-II), a major
HMO, was measured as a representative of the total concentrations
of HMOs present in human milk. Higher concentrations of LNF-II
in maternal milk at 2 wk postpartum were associated with fewer
respiratory problems in infants by 6 and 12 wk of age (15). Current
research also suggests that in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
infection, disease severity is positively correlated with viral load and
cytokine profiles in serum, nasal lavage, and in ex vivo–stimulated
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (16–21). These ex vivo
PBMC cultures commonly serve as surrogate models of infection
and have been shown to be affected by dietary intervention (22).
Because 2#-FL is one of the most abundant components in breast
milk and is currently not present in infant formula, we hypothesized
that it could play a key role in breast milk�s protective effects. To
test this hypothesis, we examined healthy term infants fed varying
amounts of 2#-FL compared with a reference group of breastfed
infants at 6 wk postpartum and analyzed in vivo and ex vivo
biomarkers of immune function. We focused our attention on those
data that showed existing differences between the ‘‘gold standard’’
[the breastfed (BF) reference group] and the control formula (CF)
group that were influenced by the addition of 2#-FL to formula.
Methods
Study design
Original clinical trial. This study is part of a larger study, the design and
methods of which have been described previously in detail (23). Briefly, a
randomized, double-blind, controlled growth and tolerance study was
conducted at 28 sites throughout the United States from April 2013 through
January 2014. In brief, healthy infants of singleton birth, with a gestational
age of 37–42 wk and a birth weight $2490 g, who had exclusively either
been fed formula or breastfed since birth, were enrolled by 5 d of life and
exclusively formula-fed (n = 317) or breastfed (n = 107) from enrollment
to 4 mo of age. Included were infants who were judged to be in good
health, as determined from the infant�s medical history and parental
report, from smoke-free homes, and whose parent or legally authorized
representative gave written informed consent.
As part of the original clinical trial, infants were randomly assigned to be
fed 1 of 3 formulas, all containing a total amount of 2.4 g oligosaccharides/L,
according to computer-generated randomization schedules stratified by
site and sex prepared by the sponsor. A nonrandomized BF group was
also enrolled. The CF contained galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) only; the
experimental formulas (EFs) were fortified with varying amounts of 2#-FL
and GOS (CF: 0 g 2#-FL/L + 2.4 g GOS/L; EF1: 0.2 g 2#-FL/L + 2.2 g GOS/L;
EF2: 1 g 2#-FL/L + 1.4 g GOS/L). The composition of the study formulas
is shown in Table 1. We defined ‘‘exclusively fed’’ as infants who received
only their assigned feeding (breast milk or assigned formula) and no
other liquids or solids with the exception of drops or syrups consisting of
vitamins, mineral supplements, or medicines. Infants who received an
alternative feeding on an occasional basis (on less than a total of 5 d)
were also considered ‘‘exclusively fed.’’
Participant selection for the substudy. Of the 424 infants enrolled
in the original clinical trial, all infants whose parent or legally authorized
representative agreed to the optional biological sampling, which included the
collection of urine, stool, and blood from infants and breast-milk samples
from breastfeeding mothers, were included in the substudy (Figure 1). The
following criteria were used to determine whether specimens would be
collected: from enrollment throughout the study period, formula-fed infants
were not to receive >240 mL of an alternate feeding (breast milk or formula
other than their assigned study formula or >2 feedings via breast) per week.
The breastfed infants were not to receive >240 mL of infant formula or
donor milk/wk. For 48 h before the collection of samples, formula-fed
infants were not to consume any feedings other than the assigned study
formula, and breastfed infants were not to consume any formula or donor
milk. If any of these criteria were not met, samples were not collected.
The protocol and all of the study procedures were reviewed and
approved by the Schulman Institutional Review Board, Cincinnati,
Ohio. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01808105.
Concentrations of 2#-FL in plasma, urine, and breast milk have been
previously published (23). Stools were analyzed for concentration of IgA,
microbiota composition, and characterization of biological factors
influential to gastrointestinal health. These data will be presented in a
subsequent publication. Data presented here are for the blood cellular
phenotyping, ex vivo mitogen-stimulated cell cycle, ex vivo RSV–
stimulated cytokines, ex vivo phytohemagglutinin–stimulated cytokines
and plasma cytokines.
Sample collection
At 6 wk of age, 2–3 mL nonfasting venous blood was drawn into sodium
heparin evacuated tubes with no restriction with regard to time since last
feeding. Blood samples were shipped overnight at ambient temperature
from the clinical sites to Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and
were processed within 24 h of collection.
Immunologic assays
Isolation of PBMCs and plasma. Plasma was obtained by standard
centrifugation procedures, dispensed into small plastic vials, and stored
at 280�C until analysis. Blood was reconstituted to original volume
with complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium
[RPMI-1640 supplemented with 5% FBS, L-glutamine (Mediatech), and
antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco Life Technologies)]. PBMCs were isolated
by standard-density gradient centrifugation on Histopaque (Sigma-Aldrich).
Viable cells were enumerated by using a hemacytometer.

 Immunophenotyping. A portion of the PBMCs (0.8 3 106) was
reserved for baseline phenotyping by flow cytometry (BD FACSCanto).
Immunophenotypic analysis was performed by using a panel of
fluorescently labeled mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies to the
following cell surface markers: CD4 (fluorescein isothiocyanate, clone
L200), CD8 (allophycocyanin-H7, clone SK1), CD20 (phycoerythrin
cyanine 7, clone 2H7), and CD56 (phycoerythrin, clone MY31) (BD
Biosciences) to identify cell-specific surface antigens. All antibodies were
used at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer and mixed
with 400,000 PBMCs. PBMCs were initially treated with a 1/20 dilution
of Human FcX (Biolegend, Inc.) to block Fc receptors before the addition
of fluoresceinated antibodies. Incubation proceeded on ice for 20 min
before 1 wash in stain buffer (13 Dulbecco�s PBS containing 3% FBS and
0.1% sodium azide) and fixation with 1% formaldehyde in stain buffer.
Samples were acquired by using the BD FACSCanto and BD
FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems).
Anti-mouse Ig beads were stained individually with each fluoresceinated
antibody to serve as compensation controls (anti-mouse Ig, k; Compbead
Plus, 7.5 mM; BD Biosciences). For the discrimination of CD4+ T cells,
CD8+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, and CD56+ NK cells, $8000 mononuclear
cells were collected (from a target of 40,000 total events), and results are
expressed as a percentage of the total live, mononuclear single cells gated
on the basis of forward- and side-scatter.
Cell culture
PBMCs were resuspended at 5.0 3 106 cells/mL in 0.2 mL 5% FBS/
RPMI-1640 medium. Cytokine secretion and RSV nonstructural protein
1 (NS1) viral load analyses were evaluated by using a modification of
Douville et al. (24). Briefly, cells were incubated in 12- 3 75-mm sterile
polypropylene tubes and stimulated with either RSV strain NM232
(New Mexico Department of Health clinical isolate NM232) at a
multiplicity of infection of 1.0 or media. The virus was allowed to adsorb
for 1 h at 37�C with 5% carbon dioxide before dilution of the cells to
1 3 106/mL and further incubation for 47 additional hours. Superna-
tants were thereafter harvested by centrifugation, treated with a 1%
volume of protease inhibitor cocktail (no. 11-6970498-001; Roche
Diagnostics), and frozen at 280�C until cytokine analyses. One milliliter
of TRIzol Reagent (Ambion/RNA, no. 15596018; Life Technologies)
was added to the remaining cell pellet and frozen at 280�C until RNA
extraction.
For proliferation and cell cycle analysis, cells were resuspended in
complete RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS, seeded into
48-well culture plates (400,000/well), and stimulated in duplicate with
either phytohemagglutinin at a final concentration of 5 mg/mL or left
unstimulated. Cells (200-mL final volume/well) were incubated at 37�C
with 5% carbon dioxide for 48 h. Supernatants were harvested by
centrifugation and frozen at 280�C until cytokine analyses. The 48-h
incubation period was chosen on the basis of previous literature (25–28)
and optimization experiments conducted before the study showing near-
maximal production of most cytokines.
Cytokine secretion assays
Plasma and cell supernatants from PBMC cultures were thawed and
analyzed for cytokines by using a commercially available multiplex kit
(HCYTOMAG-60K-10, custom 10 analyte; EMD Millipore) by using the
manufacturer�s protocol. As provided by the manufacturer, the intra- and

 interassay CVs for the various cytokines were #3.3% and #18.3%,
respectively. The lower limits of detection ranges for the individual
assays are as follows: IFN-a2, 0.67–4.16 pg/mL; IFN-g, 0.46–4.1 pg/mL;
IL-10, 0.02–2.84 pg/mL; IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), 0.05–
3.68 pg/mL; IL-1a, 0.0–2.91 pg/mL; IL-1b, 0.62–3.17 pg/mL;
IL-6, 0.33–4.22 pg/mL; IFN-g–induced protein 10 (IP-10), 0.68–
4.72 pg/mL; regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and
secreted (RANTES), 0.76–3.37 pg/mL; and TNF-a, 0.71–4.08 pg/mL. For
each assay, values below the limit of detection were imputed with the limit
of detection for that assay divided by 2.
Lymphocyte proliferation and cell cycle assay
Bromodeoxyuridine was added to proliferation culture wells set up in
parallel 47-h postincubation; 1 h later, the cells were harvested and stained
with fluoresceinated antibodies to cell surface markers CD4, CD8, CD20,
and CD56 as described above. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and treated
with DNAse to expose bromodeoxyuridine epitopes and stained with
anti–bromodeoxyuridine-allophycocyanin antibody according to kit in-
structions (allophycocyanin-bromodeoxyuridine proliferation kit, no.
557892; BD Pharmingen) at room temperature for 20 min (29). Cells
were washed, and kit-supplied 7-aminoactinomycin D (20 mL) was added
to each cell pellet, followed by 400 mL stain buffer. Cells were acquired on
the BD FACSCanto, as described above, with relevant compensation
controls. CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, and CD56+ NK cells
in sub-G0/G1 (apoptotic), G0/1, S, and G2/M phases after media only or
phytohemagglutinin stimulation were determined and expressed as a
percentage of live singlet cells.
PCR
Total RNA was extracted from PBMCs by using the Direct-zol RNA
miniPrep kit (Zymo Research Corporation), according to the manufac-
turer�s instructions. Total RNA was then quantified via absorbance
at 260 nm, and RNA integrity was checked by using the Agilent
Bioanalyzer. Total RNA was then used as a template to detect an RSV-
specific gene product NS1 to quantify viral load (30) by using TaqMan
One-Step qRT-PCR kits (Applied Biosystems) according to the manu-
facturer�s protocol.
Statistical analyses
This original clinical trial was a prospective, randomized, multicenter,
double-blinded, 4-arm parallel study to compare the growth and
tolerance of healthy term infants fed EFs containing 2#-FL with a CF
and breast milk. A sample size of 64 subjects in each formula feeding
group was calculated for the primary outcome (growth) by using the
software package nQuery Advisor 5.0 (Statistical Solutions Ltd.), as
previously described (23). With an assumed attrition rate of 30%, target
enrollment was ;92 subjects/formula feeding group. Additional subjects
were enrolled to achieve complete laboratory samples from a minimum
of 30 subjects/group. No power analysis was conducted for the substudy.
Families and clinical sites were not blinded to the BF reference group but
were blinded to the formula treatment allocation. Laboratory personnel
and statisticians were blinded to all groups until after all of the analyses
were completed. The statistical plan and complete statistical analysis
were performed before unblinding.
Data are expressed as means 6 SEMs. Statistical analyses for plasma
cytokines, viral load, and baseline characteristics were conducted by
using GraphPad Prism 6.02. SAS version 9.2 was used to perform all
other analyses. For continuous variables, normal distributions of the
data were determined by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Comparisons were made
between the 4 groups of normally distributed data by 1-factor ANOVA
(treatment group and site included in the model). For nonnormally
distributed data, square root or log-transformations (for nonnegative
data) and/or outlier removal were attempted to improve model fit. If
these were unsuccessful, then nonparametric analyses (Kruskal-Wallis
and Wilcoxon�s rank-sum test) were performed. If there was a significant
effect, multiple-comparison tests were performed between each pair of
treatment groups, with corrections for multiple testing. For plasma
cytokines and viral load, pairwise comparisons were performed by using
Fisher�s least significant difference (Holm-Sidak�s or Dunn�s correction).
All other pairwise comparisons of continuous variables were performed
by using least-squares means (step-down Bonferroni adjustment).
Categorical variables were compared between groups by using chi-
square followed by Fisher�s exact tests and adjusted for multiple
comparisons (step-down Bonferroni adjustment). Although multiple-
comparison adjustments were made, unadjusted P values were used to

set at P # 0.05, and trends were set as P # 0.10. All reported P values
were adjusted unless otherwise indicated.
Results
Participant characteristics. There were no significant differ-
ences between feeding groups for age at enrollment, sex, weight,
length, or head circumference at birth. There was a significant
difference between the EF2 and BF groups with respect to race,
with the BF group composed of more infants who were white
and the EF2 group composed of more infants who were black
(Table 2). In the original study, 9 of the total 424 subjects
violated the criteria of ‘‘exclusively fed’’ (1 CF, 3 EF1, 1 EF2, and
4 BF). These numbers did not affect the mean birth weights of
any of the groups.
Inflammatory cytokine profiles. Circulating plasma concen-
trations of inflammatory cytokines IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a
and anti-inflammatory IL-1ra were significantly higher (82%,
72%, 76%, 58%, and 58%, respectively) in the CF group than
in the BF group (P # 0.05) (Figure 2). Both the EF1 and EF2
groups exhibited profiles that were significantly different from
the CF group and not different from the BF group or from each
other. There were no differences in plasma cytokines IFN-a2,
IFN-g, IL-10, IP-10, or RANTES between any of the groups
(Supplemental Table 1).
In ex vivo RSV–induced PBMC culture supernatants, both
TNF-a and IFN-g were significantly higher in the CF group than
in the BF group (31% and 54%, respectively; P # 0.05) (Figure
3). Similar trends were shown with IL-1ra (25%) and IL-6 (38%)
(unadjusted P # 0.05) and IL-b (30%; unadjusted P = 0.06).
Neither of the 2#-FL–supplemented groups differed signifi-
cantly from the BF group or from each other for any of the
cytokines tested. The EF1 group had lower concentrations
than the CF group of IL-1b (71%; P # 0.05) and of TNF-a
(58%) and IL-6 (48%) (unadjusted P # 0.05), but not of IL-1ra
or IFN-g. EF2 did not differ from CF for any of the ex vivo
cytokines. RSV-induced IFN-a2, IL-1a, IL-10, IP-10, and
RANTES did not differ significantly between the dietary groups
(Supplemental Table 1).
No significant differences between the CF and BF groups
were found in cytokine production in supernatants from
phytohemagglutinin-stimulated PBMCs. There was a significant
difference for IP-10 (P # 0.05) between the EF1 and EF2 groups
only (Supplemental Table 1).
Circulating lymphocyte populations. The CF group had
significantly lower percentages of circulating T lymphocytes
than the BF group for total T cell (37.8% compared with
45.8%) and CD8+ (14.4% compared with 18.4%) (P # 0.05;

Discussion
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to investigate whether
feeding 2#-FL in the matrix of infant formula affects the
developing immune system. We looked at plasma cytokine
concentrations, cytokines released by ex vivo stimulation of
PBMCs, and percentages of major lymphocyte subsets within
the PBMC population as biomarkers of immune function.
Cytokines are cell-signaling molecules that regulate both the
innate and adaptive immune responses and guide the differen-
tiation and development of immune cells. Specific in vivo and ex
vivo innate cytokines were found to differ between breastfed
infants and infants fed CF. Cytokines affected by diet were
primarily derived from antigen-presenting cells (i.e., dendritic
cells, monocytes and macrophages). Similar in vivo cytokine
differences between breastfed and formula-fed infants have been
reported among primarily allergy-prone infants through the first
year of life (31). We found that infants fed 2#-FL–fortified
formulas exhibited innate cytokine profiles that were interme-
diate between breastfed and CF infants and more like breastfed
infants. Interestingly, the higher dose of 2#-FL (1 g/L) was not
more effective than the lower dose of 2#-FL (0.2 g/L) in
modulating cytokine profiles relative to breastfed infants.
Nonlinear dose-dependency of immune responses has been
reported among infants fed formulas containing nucleotides (32)
or osteopontin (33), whereby higher concentrations of immune-
regulating ingredients were not more effective than lower doses.
Receptor-mediated signaling systems often exhibit nonlinear
dose-response behaviors, sometimes with ‘‘all or none’’ re-
sponses over a narrow range of concentrations (34). Effective
dose plateaus have been observed with other dietary ingredients,
such as cocoa flavanols (35) and chitosan oligosaccharides (36),
in modulating inflammatory responses. This could be due to
receptor saturation or functional antagonism of signaling path-
ways, among others. Pharmacodynamic studies would be required
to establish the precise 2#-FL interactions involved.
We observed no differences between groups in cytokine
production or cellular proliferation in phytohemagglutinin-
stimulated PBMCs. Albers et al. (37) suggested that some
standard assessments of immune function may saturate the
response, and thus be insensitive to the modest changes due to
nutrition. They suggested that modifying procedures to use
suboptimal stimulation conditions may increase the sensitivity in
order to detect subtle modulatory effects, but caution that such
modifications are not yet sufficiently standardized to allow
comparisons between different laboratories.
There are several possible explanations for our observed
2#-FL–mediated anti-inflammatory effects. Wickramasinghe

 et al. (38) showed that Bifidobacteria grown with HMOs as the
sole carbon source led to reduced expression of inflammatory
genes in colonic epithelial cells. In addition, in models of both
mature and immature intestinal epithelial cells, 2#-FL was
shown to decrease CD14 expression and to increase the relative
amounts of negative regulatory molecules while repressing NF-kB
pathways, thus blocking inflammatory cytokine production
(39). In our study, we previously reported that 2#-FL is present in
the circulation of breastfed infants and infants fed 2#-FL–
fortified formulas, with a similar rate of uptake among groups
(23). Because 2#-FL is known to bind to dendritic cell-specific
intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-
SIGN) (40), a glycan-binding protein expressed on antigen-
presenting cells, it is conceivable that 2#-FL regulates innate
immune responses through interactions with DC-SIGN, thus
dampening inflammatory cytokine production.
With respect to adaptive immunity, we found that 2#-FL
narrowed the differences in proportions of total T lymphocytes
(including helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells) between
breastfed and CF-fed infants. In addition, 2#-FL narrowed the
differences in the percentages of apoptotic cells between BF and
CF groups, in particular with CD8+ T cells and CD8+ T cell
subsets. Apoptosis is a normal physiologic process that is
important in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the
regulation of the immune response. Daigneault et al. (41)
reported that monocytes play a role in the induction of apoptosis
in activated T cells. T cells enhance inflammatory cytokine
production by monocytes through the release of IFN-g. In our
study 2#-FL increased the percentages of activated CD8+ T cells
undergoing apoptosis more like in the breastfed infants. The
removal of activated T cells via apoptosis could serve to
downregulate the inflammatory cytokine expression by both the
T cells and the resulting activated monocytes.
As previously reported (23), the CF group had a significantly
higher percentage of subjects (n = 5) with reported eczema
than did the EF1 and EF2 groups which had none with eczema
(P # 0.05). The role of inflammatory cytokines IL-1a, IL-1b,
TNF-a, and IL-6 in the disruption of the skin barrier and ensuing
dermatitis has been well documented (42, 43). Moro et al. (44)
reported prebiotic oligosaccharides to reduce the incidence of
atopic dermatitis during the first 6 mo of age and speculated
that part of the observed effects could be due to the interac-
tion of prebiotics with carbohydrate receptors on immune
cells. Sprenger et al. (45) found a lower incidence at 2 y of age
(P < 0.05) for IgE-associated eczema in cesarean-delivered
infants who were fed breast milk containing higher amounts of
2#-FL. HMOs have been shown to affect cytokine production
and activation of human cord blood–derived T cells in vitro
(46). Binding of 2#-FL to DC-SIGN and reduced inflammatory
cytokines in vivo may explain, in part, the 2#-FL–associated
reduction in eczema. Further investigation, however, is required
to elucidate the involvement of 2#-FL in reducing the incidence
of eczema.
In our study, we altered the GOS concentrations to achieve
the same total prebiotic amount of 2.4 g/L. We believed this
would be less confounding than adding 2#-FL to a constant
amount of GOS, which could result in a simple ‘‘more is better’’
scenario. Switching out only 0.2 g/L (;8%) of GOS for 2#-FL
resulted in a significant difference from GOS alone, suggesting
that beneficial effects are due to the addition of 2#-FL rather than
the decrease in GOS.
Our study has several limitations. First, although many
differences were significant, the small group sizes limit the
interpretation of the results. Additional power and sample sizes
would have strengthened our understanding of the changes we
observed. Second, we did not determine the secretor status of the
infants. It would be interesting in the future to determine if
secretor status has any effect on the immune modulation
produced by dietary 2#-FL, and it may also provide additional
insight into the mechanism of action. Last, we measured changes
at one time point. Additional time points, including baseline
measurements, may enable the determination of any changes in
the rate of immune development and the effect of duration of
exposure.
In conclusion, feeding a single HMO (2#-FL), in the context
of infant formula, modified innate and adaptive immune profiles
to be more like that of a BF reference group. These findings
indicate that 2#-FL fortification supports aspects of immune
development and regulation similar to that in a BF reference
group of infants. Additional research is needed to fully under-
stand the biological mechanisms underlying these changes.
