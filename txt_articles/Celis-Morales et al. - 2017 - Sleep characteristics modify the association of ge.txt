ABSTRACT
Background: Obesity is a multifactorial condition influenced by
genetics, lifestyle, and environment.
Objective: We investigated whether the association of a validated
genetic profile risk score for obesity (GPRS-obesity) with body
mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) was modified
by sleep characteristics.
Design: This study included cross-sectional data from 119,859
white European adults, aged 37–73 y, participating in the UK Bio-
bank. Interactions of GPRS-obesity and sleep characteristics (sleep
duration, chronotype, day napping, and shift work) with their effects
on BMI and WC were investigated.
Results: b Values are expressed as the change in BMI (in kg/m2)
or WC per 1-SD increase in GPRS-obesity. The GPRS-obesity
was associated with BMI (b: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.60; P = 6.3 3
102207) and WC (1.21 cm; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.28 cm; P = 4.2 3
102289). There were significant interactions of GPRS-obesity
and a variety of sleep characteristics with their relation with
BMI (P-interaction , 0.05). In participants who slept ,7 or
.9 h daily, the effect of GPRS-obesity on BMI was stronger
(b: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.65 and b: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.97,
respectively) than in normal-length sleepers (7–9 h; b: 0.52;
95% CI: 0.49, 0.55). A similar pattern was observed for shift
workers (b: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.77 compared with b: 0.54;
95% CI: 0.51, 0.58 for non–shift workers) and for night-shift
workers (b: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.82 compared with b: 0.55;
95% CI: 0.51, 0.58 for non–night-shift workers), for those taking
naps during the day (b: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.78 compared with
b: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.55 for those who never or rarely had naps),
and for those with a self-reported evening chronotype (b: 0.72; 95%
CI: 0.61, 0.82 compared with b: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.57 for
morning chronotype). Similar findings were obtained by using
WC as the outcome.
Conclusion: This study shows that the association between ge-
netic risk for obesity and phenotypic adiposity measures is exac-
erbated by adverse sleeping characteristics.

INTRODUCTION
Sleep is a fundamental behavior, with growing evidence
suggesting that certain sleep behaviors are strong risk factors for
obesity (1). Previous studies suggest a U-shaped relation between
sleep duration and obesity, whereby both short and long sleep
duration are associated with higher risk of obesity (1, 2). Al-
though less well studied, other sleep characteristics including
chronotype (i.e., being an evening compared with morning
person), daytime napping, and shift work (including night-shift
work) may also be associated with obesity (3–5).
The worldwide obesity epidemic and its consequent effects on
morbidity and mortality are responsible for a large public health
burden (6, 7). The dramatic increase in obesity prevalence over the
past 3 decades has been attributed to changes in lifestyle in response
to an “obesogenic” environment (8). However, obesity is a multi-
factorial condition influenced by lifestyle and environment, as well
as by genetics (8). It has a largely polygenic genetic architecture,
and its heritability is w40–70% (8). However, the fact that obesity
prevalence varies throughout the world and is changing over time-
scales too short to be influenced by changing risk allele frequencies
suggests that there may be gene-environment interactions and that
genetic risk is moderated by lifestyle and environment. The remain-
ing unexplained heritability may be accounted for in part by such

 unappreciated gene-environment interactions (9). Some genetic
factors may operate independently of environment, but others may
confer greater predisposition to weight gain in an obesogenic en-
vironment (10), a hypothesis supported by the results of twin studies
of changes in adiposity in response to environmental influences (11).
Thus far, there is growing evidence regarding the contribution of
genetic factors on different sleep-related characteristics (12). How-
ever, there is limited evidence on genotype-lifestyle interactions in
the area of obesity and circadian biology. No studies have yet in-
vestigated whether overall genetic predisposition to obesity, as
measured by using genetic profile risk scores for obesity (GPRS-
obesity),9 interacts with sleep characteristics such as sleep duration,
chronotype, day napping, and shift work to influence adiposity. In
the current study, we therefore investigated whether the associations
between a comprehensive and validated GPRS-obesity (13) and
adiposity outcomes were modulated by sleep-related characteristics
in the UK Biobank cohort, a large population sample.
METHODS
Study design
Between April 2007 and December 2010, UK Biobank recruited
502,549 participants (5.5% response rate), aged 37–73 y from the
general population (14). Participants attended 1 of 22 assessment
centers across England, Wales, and Scotland (15) where they
completed a touch-screen questionnaire (including self-reported
sleep duration, chronotype, day napping, shift work, and night-shift
work), had physical measurements taken, and provided biological
samples, as described in detail elsewhere (15). Of these partici-
pants, 119,859 had genotype data available for the GPRS-obesity
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) used in this study after
exclusion, detailed below, because of quality control, relatedness,
mismatching of reported gender and genetically estimated sex, and
nonwhite ethnicity. The number of participants with data on sleep
characteristics (and genotype data) was as follows: sleep duration,
498,463 (115,139); chronotype, 444,331 (37,016); day napping,
500,784 (115,646); shift work, 286,522 (65,491).
The outcome measures considered were BMI (in kg/m2) and
waist circumference (WC). The independent predictor variable
of interest was a genetic profile risk score for BMI (GPRS-
obesity). Sleep duration, chronotype, day napping, shift work,
and night-shift work were treated as potential moderators.
Ethics
UK Biobank received ethical approval from the North West Multi-
center Research Ethics Committee (reference: 11/NW/03820). All
participants gave written, informed consent before enrollment in the
study, which was conducted in accordance with the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Procedures
At baseline assessment, sleep, sociodemographic, and lifestyle
variables were collected from all participants by using a self-
completed, touch-screen questionnaire. Self-reported sleep
duration was obtained by using the following question: “About how
many hours sleep do you get in every 24 hours?” Sleep duration
was used to derive sleep categories including short sleepers
(,7 h/d), normal sleepers (between 7 and 9 h/d), and long sleepers
(.9 h/d). Chronotype was self-reported and collected by using the
following question: “Do you consider yourself to be 1) definitely a
‘morning’ person, 2) more morning than evening, 3) more evening
than morning, or 4) definitely an ‘evening’ person.” We restricted
our analyses to individuals in categories 1 and 4 for robust phe-
notyping for chronotype, in line with previous analyses of the UK
Biobank cohort (16). Daytime napping was self-reported, and
participants were asked, “Do you have a nap during the day?” with
the responses being 1) never or rarely, 2) sometimes, or 3) usually.
Shift work and night-shift work variables were also self-reported
and collected by using the questions “Does your work involve
shift work?” and “Does your work involve night shifts?” with
responses of 1) never or rarely, 2) sometimes, 3) usually, or 4)
always; for this study we recoded answers into 2 categories for
both shift-related variables “never or rarely” and “yes,” the latter
of which includes “sometimes,” “usually,” and “always.”
Self-reported physical activity was recorded by using a self-
completed questionnaire based on the International Physical
Activity Questionnaire short form (17). Physically active in-
dividuals were defined as those who met the recommendation of
$600 metabolic equivalent–min/wk of moderate or vigorous
physical activity (17). Total time spent in sedentary behavior
(hours per week) was estimated as the sum of self-reported time
spent driving, using a computer, and watching television.
Dietary information was collected via a self-reported dietary
frequency questionnaire (Oxford WebQ) (18). Area-based socio-
economic status was defined from postcode of residence by using the
Townsend score (19). Age was calculated from dates of birth and
baseline assessment. Medical history [physician diagnosis of de-
pression, longstanding illness, diabetes, cardiovascular disease
(CVD), and cancer] was collected from the self-completed baseline
questionnaire. Height and body weight were measured by trained
nurses during the initial assessment center visit. BMI was calculated
from weight divided by height squared, and the WHO criteria (20)
were used to classify BMI into categories: underweight, ,18.5;
normal weight, 18.5–24.9; overweight, 25.0–29.9; and obese,
$30.0. Further details of these measurements can be found in the
UK Biobank online protocol (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).
Genetic data analysis
For this study, we used the first genetic data release (June
2015), which included approximately one-third of the UK
Biobank participants (n = 152,770). Aiming to maximize ho-
mogeneity and GPRS-obesity applicability, we restricted the
sample to those who reported being of white United Kingdom
ancestry and for whom BMI phenotype data were available.
Approximately 67% of this sample was genotyped by using the
Affymetrix UK Biobank Axiom array, and the remaining 33%
was genotyped by using the Affymetrix UK BiLEVE Axiom array.
The 2 arrays share .95% marker content. Further information on
the genotyping process is available on the UK Biobank website
(http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/scientists-3/genetic-data), which in-
cludes detailed technical documentation (http://www.ukbiobank.

 (item 22001 derived from genotype analysis and self-reported
sex), ethnicity (non-white Europeans were removed from the
analysis based on self-reported ethnicity), and quality-control
failure in the UK BiLEVE study (item 22050: UK BiLEVE
Affymetrix quality control for samples and item 22051: UK
BiLEVE genotype quality control for samples). This left
119,859 participants of whom 119,679 had BMI data available.
GPRS-obesity was derived from a set of 93 SNPs that was in
turn derived from the 97 genome-wide significant BMI-associated
SNPs reported by Locke and colleagues (13) (Supplemental
Table 1). Ninety-five of these 97 SNPs were genotyped in the
UK Biobank cohort (the 2 missing SNPs were rs2033529 and
rs12016871), and 2 further SNPs (rs9925964 and rs17001654)
were excluded on the basis of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium (P , 1 3 1026) as assessed with PLINK (21);
there were no proxy SNPs (r . 0.8) within the UK Biobank
dataset. We constructed an externally-weighted GPRS-obesity
for each participant, weighted by the per-allele effect size es-
timates reported in the GIANT (Genetic Investigation
of ANthropometric Traits) consortium study (b per 1-SD unit of
BMI) (13) and calculated according to the procedure given in
the PLINK manual (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/
profiles.html), by using the -no-mean-imputation flag. GPRS-
obesity values were normally distributed across the UK Bio-
bank cohort.
Statistical analyses
Baseline phenotypic and morbidity data were used in the
analyses. General linear models were used to test for associations
between GPRS-obesity and the outcomes (BMI and WC). The
GPRS-obesity was transformed to a z score before use in models,
so data are presented as BMI or WC changes per SD increase in
GPRS-obesity. Associations of GPRS-obesity with BMI and
WC categories (BMI $25.0; BMI $30.0; centrally obese: WC
$88 cm for women and $102 cm for men) were investigated by
using binary logistic regression, with the lower adiposity cate-
gory treated as the referent.
Interactions of sleep characteristics and the GPRS-obesity with
the outcome measures (BMI and WC) were investigated by using
the general linear model. For this the interaction, terms for sleep
characteristics (sleep duration categories, chronotype, day nap-
ping, shift work, and night-shift work) were fitted by treating all
sleep factors as categorical variables and GPRS-obesity as a
continuous variable. When interactions were statistically sig-
nificant, stratified analyses were undertaken for each sleep
variable.
For each of the approaches described above, we ran 2 in-
cremental models that included an increasing number of cova-
riates: model 0 included age, sex, month of recruitment,
deprivation score, medical history (diabetes, long-standing ill-
ness, CVD, cancer, and depression), and genetic principal
components variables; “model 1” included all variables in model
0 but also adjusted for smoking status, portions of food cate-
gories eaten per day (alcohol, fruit, coffee, vegetables, meats,
processed meat, cereals, bread, and cheese), and total physical
activity, as well as sedentary behaviors and sleep characteristics
(sleep duration, chronotype, and day napping) when these were
not being tested as potential effect modifiers. All analyses were
performed by using STATA 14 statistical software (StataCorp
LP). b Values are expressed as the change in BMI or WC per
1-SD increase in GPRS-obesity.

 RESULTS
The main characteristics of the participants by GPRS-obesity
quartile and sleep characteristics are summarized in Tables 1 and
2 and Supplemental Tables 2–5, respectively. In summary,
52.6% of the cohort was female, mean age was 56.9 y, 12.3%
were current smokers, 67.6% were overweight or obese, and
34.5% were centrally obese. Based on self-report, 54% of the
participants were physically active (.600 metabolic equivalent–
min/wk), 24.3% had short sleep duration (,7 h/d), 1.8% had
long sleep duration (.9 h/d), 25.4% had an evening chronotype,
5.5% usually napped during the day, 16.9% did shift work, and
9.4% did night-shift work. All sleep characteristics were sig-
nificantly associated with BMI and WC (Table 3).
Genetic profile risk score and obesity measures
GPRS-obesity explained 1.9% and 1.1% of the variance in
BMI and WC, respectively, with greater genetic risk being as-
sociated with a higher BMI (b: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.60; P = 6.3 3
102207) and greater WC (b: 1.21 cm; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.28 cm;
P = 4.2 3 102289). After adjustment for sociodemographic
factors, medical history, total sedentary behavior, dietary in-
take, and sleep characteristics, these associations were mar-
ginally attenuated but remained highly significant for both
BMI (b: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.57; P = 5.9 3 102201) and WC
(b: 1.16 cm; 1.09, 1.22 cm; P = 2.0 3 102254) (Supplemental
Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 6). ORs for having a BMI $25,
BMI $30, or being centrally obese are presented in Supplemental
Figure 1 and Supplemental Table 6 and are broadly consistent:
those with increased genetic risk were at increased risk of being
overweight or obese in every model.
Interactions between genetic profile risk score and sleep
characteristic
The GPRS-obesity was not associated with sleep duration or
any other sleep characteristics (data not shown; P . 0.05 for all).
However, the association between GPRS-obesity and adiposity
was modified by several of these sleep characteristics (Figures 1
and 2). Sleep duration significantly modified the association of
GPRS-obesity with both BMI (P-interaction = 3.5 3 1024) and
WC (P-interaction = 0.037) (Table 4). The association between
GPRS-obesity and BMI was stronger for participants with both
short and long sleep duration than for those who reported normal
sleep duration: b: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.68 and 0.84; 95% CI:
0.61, 1.07 compared with b: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.58. Among
participants in the lowest quartile of the GPRS-obesity, the BMI
of short and long sleepers was w0.2 higher than that of normal
sleepers, but this was not statistically significant. Among those
in the highest quartile for GPRS-obesity the difference was
greater: BMI was 0.6 and 1.1 higher for short and long sleepers,
respectively (Figure 1). Comparable results were found for WC
(Figure 2, Table 4). Similar findings were observed for day
napping, shift work, night-shift work, and chronotype (Figures 1
and 2, Supplemental Tables 7–10). The association between
GPRS-obesity and BMI was stronger among participants who
worked shifts (b: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.78 compared with
b: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.61 in non–shift workers), worked night
shifts (b: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.82 compared with b: 0.58;
95% CI: 0.54, 0.61 in non night-shift workers), had day naps
(b: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.82 compared with b: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.50,
0.56 in those who did not have day naps), and were of evening
chronotype (b: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.86 compared with b: 0.55;
95% CI: 0.50, 0.60 who were of morning chronotype). Further
adjustment for potential confounders, including smoking,
physical activity, sedentary behavior, dietary factor, and sleep
characteristics (when these were not used as a factor in the in-
teraction term) did not alter any of these associations (Supple-
mental Tables 7–10).
DISCUSSION
Main findings
This study provides novel evidence that the association of
genetic predisposition with obesity and actual measures of adi-
posity (BMI and WC) is moderated by sleep characteristics,
including sleep duration, chronotype, day napping, shift work,
and night-shift work. Moreover, our results show that in the UK
Biobank cohort the interaction of GPRS-obesity and sleep
characteristics with their effects on adiposity were independent
of a range of confounders, including sociodemographic factors,
diet, and comorbidities. These findings emphasize that, although
obesity is partly genetically determined, lifestyle plays a major
role. The effects of the genetic predisposition to obesity appear to
be augmented by sleeping behaviors, including short and long
duration, evening chronotype, day napping, shift work, and night-
shift work. In those with a high GPRS-obesity, being a short
sleeper was associated with a 0.6 higher BMI, and being a long
sleeper was associated with a 1.1 higher BMI compared with
those with similar genetic risk but normal sleep duration. In
contrast, short and long sleep duration was associated with only
w0.2 higher BMI in those in the lowest quartile for GPRS-
obesity. This means that the adverse associations of short or
long sleep durations are more pronounced in those who have
increased genetic predisposition to obesity and conversely less
pronounced in those with lower genetic predisposition. Although
the causality of this association cannot be ascertained from the
present data, the present findings make a case for intervention
studies to determine the effects of adopting healthier sleep
behaviors, particularly in individuals genetically susceptible
to obesity.

teraction between GPRS-obesity and sleep characteristics, there

duration sleepers, respectively); day napping (Q1: 14,658, 9746, and 1307; Q2: 14,355, 9859, and 1374; Q3: 14,522, 9758, and 1383; and Q4: 14,301, 9955,

 is evidence that other lifestyle behaviors, including diet and
physical activity, modify the relation between the genetic risk
score and adiposity outcomes (22, 23). Our results therefore
extend previous evidence of gene-environment interactions by
reporting the effect of several sleep-related characteristics on
genetic predisposition to obesity in a large cohort by using a more
extensive genetic risk profile derived from 93 SNPs previously
associated with BMI. We also need to consider that there is
evidence that some sleep characteristics are partially genetically
determined. It has been estimated that the heritability of sleep
duration is between 31% and 55%, suggesting a substantial
amount of sleep need is genetically determined (24). Similarly,
chronotype is also heritable as estimated by twin and family
studies (12–42%), and its genetic basis has been recently
defined (12, 16). Nonetheless, some of the sleep character-
istics studied, such as shift work and night-shift work, are
potentially amenable to modification, particularly at an or-
ganization level.
Furthermore, this study corroborates previous findings re-
garding the association between sleep characteristics and obesity.
Modal sleep duration in UK Biobank was 7 h, consistent with
previous reports (25). Our observations that sleep duration (1) and
other sleep characteristics, including chronotype (3), day napping
(26), and shift work (27), were associated with increased risk of
obesity are consistent with previous reports.
Strengths and limitations of the study
UK Biobank provided an opportunity to test our research
question in a very large cohort, and the outcomes used in this
study were collected by using validated and standardized mea-
surements rather than self-report. Although misreporting of self-
reported sleep characteristics is possible, it is likely to be random
in nature rather than varying systematically by the exposure or
outcome of interest (28). Our results were also consistent across all
sleep characteristics. Additionally, to reduce misreporting we
excluded outliers and extreme cases, although this did not ma-
terially affect the results. Another limitation of this study is the
lack of data on the duration of some exposures, such as day
napping and shift work. Despite this, the results observed for
these exposures were consistent with those seen for other sleep
characteristics for which full data were available. Chronotype
was assessed by using a single question rather than a
more comprehensive instrument, such as the Morningness-
Eveningness Questionnaire (29). The Townsend score used to
estimate socioeconomic deprivation is an area-based proxy rather
than an individual-level metric of deprivation.
A further limitation of the study is that the GPRS-obesity captures
only a small proportion of the genetic variance in BMI. The
variance explained here is 1.9% compared with the 2.7% of
variance explained by the 97 SNPs identified in the GIANT
consortium’s mega–genome-wide association study (13). This
difference is not huge and probably just reflects the differences
in cohort structure (single cohort compared with multiple co-
horts) and small biases unaccounted for in the meta-analysis
methodology. In an underpowered study, the small effect size
of the genetic predictor could result in type 2 error or an inflated
type 1 error rate, but the effect sizes reported here suggest that
the GPRS-obesity is not underpowered. A polygenic risk score
analysis explaining more of the variance in BMI may provide
greater accuracy in the measurement of the interaction effects
reported here, although it is likely that this will have to wait for
even larger genome-wide association studies to ensure that only
genuine BMI loci are included in the polygenic risk score. A

3 Model 0 was adjusted for age, sex, month of recruitment, deprivation, disease history (diabetes, depression, long-standing illness, cardiovascular
diseases, and cancer), and genetic-quality measurement.
4 Model 1 was adjusted as for model 0 plus for smoking, physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep characteristics (chronotype, day napping, and getting
up in the morning), and dietary intake variables (alcohol, fruits, coffee, vegetables, meats, processed meat, cereals, bread, and cheese).

 further limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the study. The
size and nature of the main and interaction effects found,
however, are encouraging, and in the case of genetic predictors,
reverse causality is unlikely to be a factor influencing our in-
terpretation of the results. Future studies of the effectiveness
of sleep interventions on obesity should be sufficiently
powered to study the effectiveness among subgroups defined
by genetic predisposition to obesity, as well as overall
effectiveness.
Implications of findings
In light of the public health threat being posed by obesity and
increased adiposity worldwide (30), our findings are highly
relevant for improving global health. They highlight the fact that
modifiable risk factors associated with lifestyle, including
sleeping behaviors, can moderate or exacerbate the effects of
genetic influences on body weight, just as physical activity and
diet are known to do (22, 23). Although this study was cross-
sectional, the likelihood is that the identification of individuals
who are genetically predisposed to increased adiposity may allow
targeted interventions aimed at modifying their lifestyle risk
factors for obesity and its associated diseases with increased
benefits relative to less genetically predisposed individuals. The
magnitude of the associations demonstrated in our study (for
example, the difference in body mass between long- and normal-
duration sleepers in those with high GPRS-obesity was w4.5 kg)
is sufficiently large to be clinically relevant. Previous evidence
on 900,000 adults from the collaborative analyses of 57 pro-
spective studies reported that an increase in BMI of 5 is asso-
ciated with 30% higher all-cause mortality and 40% higher
risk of CVD mortality (7). Evidence of such gene-lifestyle in-
teractions may empower and motivate individuals to adopt
healthier lifestyle and sleep-related behaviors through knowl-
edge that such behavior change can be effective in preventing
obesity and therefore the risk of obesity-related non-communicable
diseases (31, 32). Our findings are relevant to the health and em-
ployment sectors and suggest that promoting healthy sleep should
be promoted, alongside a healthy diet and physical activity, as a
means of combating the obesity epidemic.
