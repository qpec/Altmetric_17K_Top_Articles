Abstract
Context—Limited data exist about blood lead levels and potential exposures among children 
living in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Department of Health has no formal blood lead 
surveillance program.
Objectives—We assessed the prevalence of elevated BLLs [≥ 5 micrograms (μg) of lead per 
deciliter (dL) of blood], household environmental lead levels, and risk factors for BLL among 
children less than 6 years old living in Puerto Rico in 2010.
Methods—We used a population-based cross-sectional sampling strategy to enroll an island-
representative sample of Puerto Rican children less than 6 years old. We estimate the island-wide

 weighted prevalence of elevated BLL, and conducted bivariable and multivariable linear 
regression analyses to ascertain risk factors for elevated BLLs.
Results—The analytic dataset included 363 households and 439 children less than 6 years old 
throughout Puerto Rico. The weighted geometric mean BLL of children less than 6 years old was 
1.57 μg/dL [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.27, 1.88). The weighted prevalence of children less 
than 6 years old with BLLs ≥ 5 μg/dL was 3.18% (95% CI = 0.93, 5.43) and for BLLs ≥ 10 μg/dL 
was 0.50% (95% CI = 0, 1.31). Higher mean BLLs were significantly associated with data 
collection during the summer months, a lead-related activity or hobby of anyone in the residence 
and maternal education less than 12 years. Few environmental lead hazards were identified.
Conclusions—The prevalence of elevated BLLs among Puerto Rican children less than 6 years 
old is comparable to the most recent (2007 – 2010) U.S. national estimate [BLLs ≥ 5 μg/dL = 
2.6% (95% CI = 1.6, 4.0)]. Our findings suggest targeted screening of specific higher-risk groups 
of children less than 6 years old can replace island-wide or insurance specific policies of 
mandatory blood lead testing in Puerto Rico.
Introduction
Lead is an environmental neuro-toxicant that affects nearly every system in the body.1 Lead 
can be found in paint, pottery, toys, traditional medicines, contaminated foods/beverages, 
batteries and electronics recycling products.2,3,4 Lead poisoning in children has been 
associated with decreased intelligence, anemia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 
increased dental caries, decreased growth, and impaired hearing and in high levels it may 
cause severe brain damage and death.1,5 Children, especially those who are less than 2 years 
old, are particularly susceptible to lead poisoning because their central nervous systems are 
still developing and they absorb more lead from their living and playing environments than 
adults.6 According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), no safe threshold 
of blood lead level (BLL) has been identified in children.5 In 2012, the CDC Advisory 
Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention recommended replacing the use of the 
term “BLL of concern” with a reference range upper value defined as the 97.5th percentile 
of BLLs among U.S. children aged 1–5 years from two consecutive cycles of NHANES.7
Universal BLL testing is recommended among children 9 – 72 months of age (except in 
communities with sufficient data to conclude children are not at risk of exposure) as part of 
the American Academy of Pediatrics’ (AAP) Bright Futures Guidelines for Health 
Supervision.8 Lead screening in Puerto Rico is not routinely requested in pediatric practices, 
unless exposure is suspected. The Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) has collected 
limited BLL screening information from children enrolled in the Head Start Program; 
however there is no formal BLL surveillance system for children less than 6 years old. A 
few studies have been conducted in Puerto Rico primarily among population groups 
considered to be at high risk for lead exposure. Data collected for the Head Start Program by 
PRDH during 1994-1995 found six out of two hundred children tested had an elevated BLL 
>10 μg/dL (PRDH, unpublished data). During 2003, an investigation conducted by Sánchez-
Nazario and colleagues in Vega Baja-Puerto Rico found among 42 children less than 6 years 
old, BLLs ranged from 0.97 to 7.79 μg/dL and environmental house dust levels ranged from 
0.12 to 98.3 micrograms per square foot (μg/ft2) with 17% of the households being above

 the Environmental Protection Agency action level of 40 micrograms μg/ft2.9 In contrast, a 
2006 study found children between 1-7 years of age living in Puerto Rico were not at high 
risk for lead toxicity.10 In 2008, a study conducted to determine the association between 
BLL concentration and intellectual functioning in Vega Baja-Puerto Rico among a group of 
children aged 6-16 years found a mean BLL of 1.52 μg/dL and a non-significant association 
(p=0.097) with BLLs above 1.4 μg/dL and a below average score in the verbal subscale 
test.11 During 2009, the PRDH received unpublished reports of elevated BLLs among 
Puerto Rican children who were tested while visiting mainland United States. The exposure 
source of the children was frequently unknown so being from Puerto Rico was a 
hypothesized risk factor.
Methods
Study Design
This 2010 study included a population-based, cross-sectional, island-representative sample 
of children less than 6 years old, administration of personal and household risk factor 
questionnaires to children's parents, and environmental sampling. The study population 
included children less than 6 years old who lived at the same Puerto Rico address for at least 
the past 9 months. A population-based cluster survey design was used to select households 
throughout Puerto Rico. Because the island is approximately 100 × 35 miles, a simple 
random sample was not logistically feasible. The survey design was based on the Expanded 
Program on Immunization model, but the accuracy was improved based on the 
recommendations of Brogan and colleagues12 and Kish.13
The sampling frame for the survey was created by dividing the island into clusters using 
U.S. census block groups as the clusters. The island consists of 2,453 block groups and 861 
census tracts.14 Clusters were stratified by age of housing based on U.S. Census data (2000). 
The small island municipalities of Vieques and Culebra, former U.S. naval training ranges, 
were made ineligible for selection due to separate environmental health studies and possible 
bio-monitoring occurring among residents. Clusters were selected within a stratum with 
probability proportional to estimated population (children 1-5 years of age) size (PPS) 
method. Forty clusters were randomly selected using PPS, 20 of these were oversampled 
(>20% for pre-1950 housing, when the use of lead-based paint may have been more 
common). These 20 clusters with high proportion of pre-1950 housing were oversampled so 
areas of potential lead exposure were well represented in the study. Three clusters were 
replaced due to concerns for the safety of data collection team members by randomly 
selecting an adjacent cluster with a similar number of estimated children aged 1-5 years. A 
sample of households was selected within each chosen cluster by using systematic random 
sampling. All households had equal selection probability within a cluster. All eligible 
children from each selected household were enrolled into the study.
Using tax assessor data prepared by the Centro de Recaudación de Ingresos Municipales or 
CRIM (Municipal Internal Revenue Center), an address was randomly selected from the full 
roster of residential addresses in the cluster as a starting point for each data collection team. 
After visiting the first address, each data collection team went to the next address on the 
same side of the street, in descending order, and then up the opposite side until its quota of

 households was met or until the street ended. The quota of households was 10 per cluster 
and was conducted using systematic random sampling per cluster. If the quota was not met 
when the street ended, the team went to another street on its list, which was mapped in a 
clockwise direction to better ascertain location of teams at all times. To enumerate, the data 
collection teams noted the outcome of each household visit (i.e., eligible, ineligible, refused, 
vacant). A household was recorded as “occupied but the residents not at home” only after 
the team had visited the household at least 3 times over 2 days. To increase participation 
rates, PRDH note card with a phone number were left at vacant households. Participating 
families received a $15 gift certificate to a large toy chain store to thank them for their time 
and effort. A household was defined as the sampling unit (i.e., an area that included at least 
1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, and a kitchen) where people could live at a given address, and many 
addresses visited included multiple families. We enrolled one household from addresses 
with >1 family.
A data collection team comprised at least 1 PRDH staff member, 1 CDC staff member or 1 
PRDH-trained field epidemiology fellow, 1 other health professional, and 1 community 
member. Team members were trained in cultural sensitivity, data collection, capillary and 
venous blood drawing, environmental sampling, referrals and personal safety. At least two 
team members were fluent in Spanish language. Approximately 10 teams were used during 
the 6 week study period (4 weeks during June/July 2010 and 2 weeks during November 
2010). Teams conducted field work from late morning to evening, including weekends. 
Local community leaders and law enforcement officials were notified about the study. The 
study was announced in several island newspapers, including El Nuevo Día.
Sample size was calculated to provide a sample for a 95% confidence interval of ± 1.5% 
around an estimated prevalence estimate of 4.8%. The sample size calculation assumed an 
intra-cluster correlation of 0.04, a design effect of 1.36, and response rate of 80%.
Questionnaire Administration
Study teams administered 3 questionnaires in Spanish to a consenting parent or legal 
guardian in each eligible household: 1) a child questionnaire to obtain demographic factors 
and assess lead exposure risk factors, 2) a parental questionnaire, and 3) a household 
questionnaire. Questionnaire administration averaged 30 minutes in total. A random sample 
of households also received an environmental questionnaire which included sampling and a 
visual inspection of the residence and yard.
Environmental Sampling
Two hundred and fifty-seven (257) randomly selected enrolled households received 
environmental sampling [interior paint X-ray fluorescence (XRF), soil, water, and interior 
dust]. Environmental sampling consisted of the collection of one composite exterior soil 
sample from 5 bare soil area locations where resident children less than 6 years old were 
said to play. A soil-lead hazard for play areas is defined as soil with lead equal to or 
exceeding 400 parts per million (micrograms per gram).15 A 5 ml water sample was 
collected from the tap used for drinking/cooking. An unacceptable water lead level was 
defined as 0.015 parts per million (ppm) or 15 micrograms per liter.16 Two composite dust

 wipe samples were collected from the floor using a square grid, specifically in the area 
where the resident child less than 6 years old reportedly played and from the entry way of 
the house. An elevated dust floor measurement was defined as 40 μg/ft2.17 A second 
composite dust wipe sample was measured and collected from the bedroom window sill(s) 
of the resident children less than 6 years old. An elevated dust window measurement was 
defined as 250 μg/ft2.17 Lastly, a small number of households had interior portable-XRF 
measurements conducted to determine the presence of lead-based paint inside the residence. 
A rough schematic sketch of the residence was made and measurements were recorded.
Health Education
At the end of questionnaire administration, teams provided EPA, CDC and PRDH 
educational material (in Spanish) about lead exposure prevention and referrals to other child 
and/or housing-related services. At the end of the study, four free BLL screenings 
(November 2010–May 2011) were provided by CDC and PRDH to children not selected in 
the study.
Blood Lead Survey
Trained study team members (i.e., physicians or nurses) collected capillary BLL samples 
because it is convenient and less costly than venous sampling. Previous studies have 
reported a high correlation between capillary and venous sampling (the preferred diagnostic 
method).18,19,20 CDC staff with extensive field experience trained nurses and physicians in 
the appropriate collection of 200 μL samples of capillary blood from each eligible child in 
the household (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, 2001). Capillary 
samples were analyzed within 24 hours of collection using the LeadCare II (Magellan 
Diagnostics; Billerica, Massachusetts) point of care BLL analyzer. The instrument was 
modified by the manufacturer for this study to report BLLs less than the limit of detection 
(3.3 μg/dL), because lower BLLs were expected and population estimates were needed. In 
2006, the LeadCare II Blood Lead system was categorized as a waived device under the 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA).21 This CLIA waiver demonstrates 
its ease of use and is ideal for use in the field. The instrument was calibrated pre- and post-
BLL analyses. A venous blood sample was randomly and exclusively collected from 9% of 
the participating children by trained PRDH nurses and sent to CDC, National Center for 
Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) for quality-control. The DLS 
used the Perkin-Elmer Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer with Dynamic 
Reaction Cell Technology (ELAN® DRC II) (PerkinElmer Norwalk, CT, 
www.perkinelmer.com) to test venous blood samples for lead. Children with BLLs ≥ 10 
μg/dL had a venous confirmatory test conducted within 3 days.
Results to Study Participants
Child BLL results were provided via U.S. mail to a parent or legal guardian within one week 
from date of sample collection. Letters explained results to participants and outlined steps to 
coordinate medical follow-up, if needed. Confirmatory venous testing was conducted for 
children with a BLL of ≥ 10 μg/dL based on CDC guidelines.22 Environmental sampling 
results with an interpretation of findings were provided via U.S. mail to parents or legal 
guardians within 2 months from sample collection date.

 Data Analysis
Data were entered into FAST software (Montgomery, AL) and 15% of records were 
completely reentered to confirm accuracy of data entry. Data were analyzed using complex 
survey procedures in SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and SUDAAN version 
11.0.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) software to account for 
unequal weighting, clustering and stratification.
The sampling frame for the study was 2000 U.S. census block groups. The survey was a 
stratified two stage cluster design where the first stage of sampling was block groups and the 
second stage was a household with at least one child less than 6 years old within a selected 
block group. The sampling frame of block groups was divided into two strata based on the 
age of housing: 1) pre-1950 and 2) 1950 and newer. To attempt to capture more children 
with elevated BLLs, we oversampled block groups with older housing - allocating 20 of the 
40 clusters to the pre-1950 housing, when the use of lead paint may have been more 
common. To calculate prevalence estimates and make inferences about the entire population 
of children less than 6 years old residing in Puerto Rico, we created sampling weights for 
both households and children. Sampling weights were adjusted to account for any unequal 
selection probabilities that occurred to account for non-response and calibrate to the census 
population.
Descriptive statistics were used to describe household and child characteristics. Linear 
regression techniques were used to examine risk factors for elevated BLLs that were 
obtained from the household and child questionnaires. BLL concentrations were markedly 
right-skewed and were natural log-transformed for linear regression statistical analyses. 
Geometric mean and ratio of geometric mean estimates were back-transformed. Risk factors 
included child age and gender, child activities and health conditions, whether the child had 
ever traveled outside of Puerto Rico > 2 weeks in his/her entire life, previous renovation 
activity in the household, frequency of painting the residence, presence of household pets, 
all resident smoking status, mother's education level, lead-related occupation or activities, 
use of household remedies, herbal remedies or folk medicines, receipt of public or Section 8 
housing, receipt of public assistance, house ownership status, and data collection month. On 
the basis of a previous study, age of the child was selected as a potential confounding 
variable.23 Age of the residence was not considered as a confounder because of concerns 
about the quality of reporting of this specific information (90% missing values). Most 
children (90%) enrolled in the survey were currently on or had received public assistance, 
thus this variable was also discounted as a confounder.
Bi-variable analyses were conducted to assess each risk factor's association with elevated 
BLLs; risk factors significantly associated with elevated BLLs were then evaluated 
separately in multivariable analyses. The initial multivariable analysis assessed each risk 
factor while the selected confounding variable and interaction terms were assessed. During 
the second multivariable analysis, we used a forward-selection strategy to add 1 risk factor 
variable at a time to the most predictive model, including the a priori confounder, until all 
risk factors in the model were statistically significant. Only statistically significant risk 
factors (at the p < 0.10 level) identified in the initial multivariable analysis were included in

 the second multivariable analysis; interactions between risk factors and the confounding 
variable were assessed during both analyses. The final model only included age and risk 
factors significant at the p < 0.05 level. Variance inflation factors were used to assess 
collinearity between variables in the predictive models.
Results
A total of 377 households and 456 children less than 6 years old were enrolled in our 
population-based survey in Puerto Rico. Of the 1,397 households visited, 855 (61.2%) were 
ineligible for participation (e.g., no children less than 6 years old lived at the residence, 
residence was unoccupied, or address was not a residence). The eligible household response 
rate was 377 (69.6%). The refusal rate was 5.3%. The most common reason for refusal was 
the inability to get parental or legal guardian permission to join the study. Seventeen 
children from 14 households were excluded from the analyses because insufficient (n = 15) 
or no (n = 2) blood was collected. The analytic dataset comprised 363 households and 439 
children less than 6 years old (Figure 1).
Child Characteristics
Gender and age were not recorded for 7 (1.6%) children; attempts to locate families to 
obtain missing data were unsuccessful. The average age of children was 3.3 years, and 
among those with available gender information, 234 (53.3%) were male; most children 410 
(93.4%) were born in Puerto Rico. The most commonly reported racial groups were multi-
racial (n=213 or 48.5%) and white (n=161 or 36.7%). Almost all children were Hispanic 
(n=423 or 96.4%), with 409 (96.7%) describing their Hispanic ethnicity type as Puerto 
Rican. One hundred and twenty-five children (28.5%) were reported by a parent or legal 
guardian to have had a previous BLL test, 117 (26.7%) were reported to have asthma (as 
told by a health care provider), and 391 (89.0%) were reported to have up-to-date 
vaccinations. The parent or legal guardian reported 165 (37.6%) children spent more than 20 
hours per week other than the primary household. Almost half (47.9%) of these children 
were reported to spend that time at school. The majority of children (397, 90.4%) were 
currently receiving or had received public services, the most common form of assistance 
being government medical insurance (n=348 or 79.3%; Table 1). The parent or legal 
guardian reported 231 (65%) of the households had a child that played outside the house for 
an average of 2.9 hours per day (range 1 - 10 hours) (Table 2).
Household Characteristics
Among participating households, median occupancy was 4 persons (range 2 - 13). Among 
those who knew the age of housing, 18 (5.1%) housing units were built post-1989; most 
residents (89.9%) did not know the year their residence was built. Among the 355 
households, 137 (38.6%) of the families owned the residence, 231 (65.1%) had a single 
family dwelling type. Other notable socio-demographic household characteristics reported 
were 47 (13.2%) had a resident who was a current smoker and 156 (43.9%) children had a 
mother who completed high school or obtained a general education degree (GED) (Table 2).

 Blood Lead Results
Among the 439 children tested, 392 (89.3%) had capillary samples and 47 (10.7%) had 
venous samples. Mean BLLs did not significantly differ between capillary samples (1.7 
μg/dL) and venous samples (1.7 μg/dL) (p=0.965). Overall, 15 (3.6% un-weighted) children 
in the study had BLLs ≥ 5 μg/dL, and 3 (0.7% un-weighted) children had BLLs ≥ 10 μg/dL. 
The weighted geometric mean BLL of children less than 6 years old was 1.57 μg/dL (95% 
CI= 1.27, 1.88). The weighted prevalence of children less than 6 years old with BLLs ≥ 5 
μg/dL was 3.2% (95% CI = 0.9, 5.4) and the weighted prevalence of children less than 6 
years old with BLLs ≥ 10 μg/dL was 0.5% (95% CI = 0, 1.3). The weighted percent of 
children less than 6 years old with BLLs ≥ 5 μg/dL residing in pre-1950 housing clusters 
[4.2% (95% CI= 1.4, 11.8)] differed little compared with percent of children less than 6 
years old with BLLs ≥ 5 μg/dL residing in clusters with mostly post-1950 housing [3.1% 
(95% CI= 1.4, 6.6)].
Environmental Characteristics
Among the 259 (71.3%) households randomly selected for environmental sampling, 19 
(7.3%) had XRF paint assessment, 178 (68.7%) had soil assessment, 230 (88.8%) had a dust 
window assessment, 235 (90.7%) had a dust floor assessment, and 257 (99.2%) had a tap 
water assessment (Table 3). Environmental sampling results showed water levels above the 
EPA action level for water in 3 (1.2%) households, 1 household had an elevated floor-dust 
lead, 1 household had an elevated window-dust lead, 1 household had an elevated XRF 
measurement, and no households had elevated soil lead levels. Six dust wipe controls were 
collected. Results of the dust wipe control samples were below limit of detection.
Risk Factors
Forty-three (12.0%) households had a resident whose activities or hobbies involved lead, 
such as automobile repair, metal recycling, fishing sinker making, ceramics/pottery or 
jewelry making. Seventy-one (19.5%) households had a resident whose occupation involved 
lead, such as smelting, working on a firing range, battery recycling or manufacturing, 
painting or construction, and automobile or radiator repair. Two hundred and ninety-one 
(82.0%) households reported having plates, bowls, or food storage containers made of 
ceramic or earthenware (these items were not tested for presence of lead), 64 (18.0%) 
households were renovated (inside or outside) during the previous 6 months, 207 (58.3%) 
households reported painting once per year or more, and 176 (49.6%) households reported 
having pets (Table 2).
Fifty-three (12.1%) children were reported to use household/herbal remedies or folk 
medicines, 301 (68.6%) children were reported to eat or mouth non-food items, and 38 
(8.7%) children were reported to rarely or never wash hands before eating (Table 1).
In weighted bi-variable analyses, and after adjusting for child's age the log of the child's 
BLL was independently significantly associated with June/July data collection months 
(p=0.0021), lead hobby of a household resident (p=0.005), mother's education achievement 
less than High School or GED (p=0.047), absence of pets in the household (p=0.0566), and 
child currently or ever receiving public services (p=0.0725) (Table 4). Based on weighted

 multivariable analyses, after adjusting for child's age, the log of the child's BLL was 
significantly associated with June/July data collection months (p=0.0055), lead hobby of a 
household resident (p=0.0302) and mother's education achievement less than High School or 
GED (p=0.0088) (Table 5). A co-linearity assessment did not identify significant 
correlations between variables in any of the models.
Discussion
The prevalence of elevated BLLs among Puerto Rican children less than 6 years old is 
comparable to the most recent U.S. national estimate. Our findings suggest that targeted 
screening of specific higher-risk groups of children less than 6 years old can replace island-
wide or insurance specific policies of mandatory blood lead testing in Puerto Rico.
The prevalence of BLLs ≥ 5 μg/dL among Puerto Rican children less than 6 years old is 
consistent with estimates for the U.S. mainland during 2007-2010. The U.S. mainland 
estimated percent of children less than 6 years old with BLLs ≥ 5 μg/dL is 2.6% (95% CI = 
1.6, 4.0) compared to 3.2% (95% CI = 1.3, 1.9) among Puerto Rican children. The geometric 
mean BLL among Puerto Rican children less than 6 years old [1.6 μg/dL (95% CI = 1.3, 
1.9)] is also very comparable to the U.S. estimate during the 2007-2010 time period [1.3 
μg/dL (95% CI = 1.3, 1.4)].24 We found environmental lead levels in our survey population 
to be well below current regulatory standards among the vast majority of the 259 households 
assessed for environmental lead, with only 5 samples [representing 4 (1.5%) unique 
households] being above regulatory thresholds. As a U.S. commonwealth, Puerto Rico is 
subject to the same policies and regulations about lead concentrations in paint, gasoline, 
consumer products, etc. It is clear from our study that residential lead paint was not 
commonly used in housing and given the low soil lead levels we found, even when lead in 
gasoline was the primary fuel for vehicles, it is quite possible that fewer vehicles per capita 
resulted in less ambient contamination.
Routine BLL testing of Medicaid-eligible children at specific ages is currently mandatory in 
Puerto Rico. However, a recent study determined a child's Medicaid status was not 
predictive of having an elevated BLL,25 and recent recommendations have been established 
to allow public health officials flexibility in developing BLL screening strategies to reflect 
local risk for elevated BLLs.26 Our study demonstrates the risk for high BLLs in Puerto 
Rico is low. This type of finding may serve as a model for other jurisdictions developing 
waivers for universal BLL testing.
We identified three factors in multivariable analyses which predicted an association with 
higher mean BLLs among children: June/July data collection months, a household hobby or 
activity involving lead and maternal education less than 12 years. Although these differences 
are not clinically significant (i.e., BLL ≥ 5 μg/dL), a household lead hobby and maternal 
education less than 12 months may be useful risk assessment questions. Pediatric health care 
providers may ask Puerto Rican families if they have a hobby using lead, to determine 
which children to test. Household hobbies involving lead have been associated with 
childhood lead poisoning in other Caribbean countries,27,28 although sources of lead 
exposure can differ by island and country.29 Bernard and McGeehin (2003) reported

 education (High School graduate or not) of the reference adult was associated with being in 
the 5-10 μg/dL BLL group (OR: 1.5 [95% CI: 1.0, 2.2]) and the 10-20 μg/dL BLL group 
(OR: 2.2 [95% CI: 1.3, 3.8]) among children sampled in the Third NHANES, 1988–1994.23 
Another study reported on the inverse relationship between child BLL and parental 
education attainment.30 Our findings demonstrating higher child mean BLLs during the 
summer months compared to November are consistent with numerous studies describing 
maximum BLLs during the summer months.31,32,33
In this study we did not find household occupations which can result in exposure to lead (i.e. 
pottery making, auto repair, battery manufacturing, etc.) significantly predicted higher mean 
BLLs in children less than 6 years old. This may be due to misclassification if the 
generalized category includes materials that may or may not contain lead or because lead-
related occupations were identified in less than 20% of cases and small numbers may have 
limited our ability to identify a significant difference. There is a compelling body of 
literature describing the importance of ‘take home’ lead as an exposure source for children 
with high BLLs including lead dust contamination of family vehicles and child safety 
seats,34 automobile repair worker ‘take home’ lead exposure,35 construction worker ‘take 
home’ lead exposure,36 and a recent study of workers at a battery recycling facility in Puerto 
Rico.37
Clinical and public health practitioners can take measures to ensure children at risk for 
elevated BLLs are identified by continued collection of BLL testing data, review of these 
data to identify common risk factors, and systematic collection of data such as toxic release 
data that may indicate a new source of exposure. Resources previously used to screen low 
risk children can be targeted to this ongoing evaluation of exposure and strategies that 
control or eliminate sources of lead before children have high BLLs.
Our study had limitations. First, we were not able to assess possible differences between 
children who did and did not participate in the study. Second, using 2000 census data to 
construct our cluster sample sometimes led field teams to areas with few children less than 6 
years old. Additionally, use of 2000 census data to weight our sample may not reflect 
current population estimates and age distribution. It is known that demographics in Puerto 
Rico have changed in recent years.14 Elevated BLLs among children is a rare event and they 
may be clustered in certain areas. In our study we did not find many children with elevated 
BLLs. To find potentially more children with elevated BLLs, we would need to oversample 
potential exposure areas (other than older housing) such as communities where occupational 
take home lead exposure occurs. Lastly, our results are not generalizable to children residing 
in Vieques and Culebra, areas of former U.S. Naval training ranges.
Nevertheless, this was a comprehensive prevalence study that included a face-to-face 
survey, BLL testing, environmental sampling and visual housing inspection, conducted 
during two different seasons (i.e., summer and fall during 2010) which allowed us to 
observe possible differences among children's behaviors and lead exposure risk factors. One 
of the main reasons we conducted this study was to investigate results from unpublished 
reports of Puerto Rican children with elevated BLLs while visiting mainland United States.

 Nonetheless, our survey did not find that a child ever traveling outside of Puerto Rico for 
more than 2 weeks was predictive of elevated BLLs.
Our findings support reports of comparable elevated BLLs among children living in Puerto 
Rico compared to other jurisdictions such as New York (NY) State (excluding NY City), 
with 1.1% of children less than 6 years old having BLLs ≥ 10 μg/dL during 2004-2007.38 
However, it appears risk factors for elevated BLLs might be different compared to those 
reported stateside, where lead-based paint chips and dust are the major contributors to 
elevated BLLs. To better understand where population risks lie, continued surveillance and 
case investigations are required. Our findings suggest targeted screening of specific higher-
risk groups of children less than 6 years old can replace costly island-wide or insurance 
specific policies of mandatory BLL testing in Puerto Rico. The PRDH is collecting and 
reviewing child BLL lab record data in its effort toward development of a child BLL 
surveillance system.
