Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder causing memory loss and cognitive decline unless dis-
ease-modifying treatments are applied (1–6). The classical neu-
ropathological hallmarks, Aβ-amyloid–containing plaques and 
tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles, have stimulated studies 
to define mechanisms of neurodegeneration (1–3, 6–12) that have 
guided clinical trials (13–16).
Dysfunction of the endocytic system, manifested by 
enlargement of Rab5+ early endosomes, is another important 
neuropathological marker in AD (17–21). Rab5, a small GTPase, 
regulates endocytosis and intracellular trafficking (22, 23). By 
cycling between an active form (GTP-bound) and an inactive 
state (GDP-bound), Rab5 dictates endocytosis, trafficking, 
and sorting of surface cargoes (18, 19, 22, 23). In AD, abnormal 
enlargement of Rab5+ early endosomes is not only characteris-
tic, it occurs early on; it was observed in individuals with spo-
radic AD (24). Interestingly, endosomal pathology was detected 
in brain regions free of Aβ or tau pathology (24, 25). In people 
with Down syndrome (DS), enlarged Rab5+ endosomes were 
also observed occurring as early as in the fetal period (26–28). 
Early endosome abnormalities precede not only the onset of 
dementia but also the emergence of plaques and tangles. There-
fore, dysregulation of Rab5 activity and of the endocytic path-
way are early features in both AD and DS.
The mechanism(s) leading to endosomal changes in AD and 
DS remain undefined. Studies have shown that increased gene dose 
for the amyloid precursor protein (APP), triplicated in DS, is linked 
to endosomal abnormalities in DS (19, 26, 28, 29). APP is sequen-
tially cleaved by either β- or α-secretase to produce the correspond-
ing C-terminal fragments: β-CTF (or C99) or α-CTF (or C83) (refs. 
30, 31, and Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material avail-
able online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI82409DS1). Cleavage 
of the β-CTF by γ-secretase yields the APP intracellular domain 
(AICD) and Aβ peptides; γ-secretase cleavage of α-CTF yields 
AICD and P3 (refs. 32–34 and Supplemental Figure 1A). The tox-
icity of Aβ peptides (Aβ40/42) has been extensively studied in AD (1, 
4, 5, 8); the role(s) of full-length APP and/or its CTFs in AD patho-
genesis are less well understood (35). Nevertheless, increased APP 
gene dose in DS, which results in increased levels of the full-length 
APP and its CTFs, is linked to endosomal pathology (24, 26, 28). 
Recent findings for β-CTF–mediated changes in endosomes in 
fibroblasts further support that APP is linked to endosomal dys-
function (19, 26, 28, 29, 36). However, important questions remain: 
(a) What APP product(s) cause dysregulation of early endosomes; 
(b) Which physiological events are impacted, and of these, which 
might contribute to AD pathogenesis in DS? In the Ts65Dn mouse 
model of DS, increased App gene dose–mediated enlargement of 
The endosome/lysosome pathway is disrupted early in the course of both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS); 
however, it is not clear how dysfunction in this pathway influences the development of these diseases. Herein, we explored 
the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which endosomal dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of AD and DS. We 
determined that full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its β-C-terminal fragment (β-CTF) act though increased 
activation of Rab5 to cause enlargement of early endosomes and to disrupt retrograde axonal trafficking of nerve growth 
factor (NGF) signals. The functional impacts of APP and its various products were investigated in PC12 cells, cultured rat 
basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), and BFCNs from a mouse model of DS. We found that the full-length wild-type 
APP (APPWT) and β-CTF both induced endosomal enlargement and disrupted NGF signaling and axonal trafficking. β-CTF 
alone induced atrophy of BFCNs that was rescued by the dominant-negative Rab5 mutant, Rab5S34N. Moreover, expression 
of a dominant-negative Rab5 construct markedly reduced APP-induced axonal blockage in Drosophila. Therefore, increased 
APP and/or β-CTF impact the endocytic pathway to disrupt NGF trafficking and signaling, resulting in trophic deficits in 
BFCNs. Our data strongly support the emerging concept that dysregulation of Rab5 activity contributes importantly to early 
pathogenesis of AD and DS.

pathway disruption induces axonal dysfunction

26, 54, 55). We assayed the level of GTP-Rab5 in brains of 12-month-
old Ts65Dn and 2N mice following a published protocol (56). As 
previously reported (28), the level of full-length APP in Ts65Dn 
was approximately 1.5-fold than in 2N samples (Figure 2A). A sig-
nificant, approximately 60% increase in the level of GTP-Rab5 was 
seen in Ts65Dn as compared with 2N samples (P = 0.044) (Figure 
2, A and B). To test the effect of App gene dose on activated Rab5, 
we examined 2N mouse lines with 2, 1, or 0 copies of the App gene 
(App+/+, App+/–, and App–/–). The levels of the full-length APP protein 
in embryonic brain tissues, as assayed by immunoblotting, mirrored 
their respective genotypes (Figure 2C). The level of GTP-Rab5  in 
App–/– mice was approximately 70% (P = 0.002) and in App+/– mice 
approximately 85% (P = 0.201) relative to that in App+/+ mice (Figure 
2, C and D). The level of GTP-Rab5 in mouse brain thus correlates 
inversely with APP gene dose.
We next tested whether the increase in App gene dose in Ts65Dn 
BFCNs was responsible for enlargement of Rab5+ endosomes (Fig-
ure 1). By immunoblotting, the APP siRNA caused an approximately 
30% reduction in the level of full-length APP, as compared with con-
trol siRNA (Figure 2E). Rab5+ puncta in BFCNs treated with either 
the APP siRNA or control siRNA were analyzed (Figure 2, F and G) 
as in Figure 1. Large, sometimes lobulated Rab5+ puncta were seen 
in cultures treated with the control siRNA, whereas these structures 
were typically smaller and rounded in cultures treated with the APP 
siRNA (Figure 2G). Treatment with the APP siRNA significantly 
reduced the size of Rab5+ puncta in Ts65Dn neurons to a value 
equivalent to that in 2N neurons (Figure 2F). Thus, increased App 
gene dose is necessary for increased Rab5 activation and for early 
endosome enlargement in Ts65Dn neurons.
Full-length APP and β-CTF caused enlargement of early endo-
somes in PC12 cells. To determine how increased APP expression 
caused an increase in Rab5 activation, we asked which APP pro-
duct(s) were responsible (Supplemental Figure 1A). We trans-
fected PC12M cells with full-length APP-GFP, C99-GFP (β-CTF), 
C83-GFP (α-CTF), or AICD-GFP and examined endosomes by 
live cell imaging (Supplemental Figure 1B). Bright foci of GFP+ 
intracellular structures were present in PC12M cells that over-
expressed APP-GFP or C99-GFP. In contrast, cells expressing 
C83-GFP or AICD-GFP showed diffuse, hazy signals for GFP, 
with occasional foci in C83-GFP cells. In APP-GFP and C99-GFP 
cells, the GFP+ intracellular structures were, on average, approxi-
mately 2 μm2 (Supplemental Figure 1E). GFP signals in C83-GFP 
or AICD-GFP cells contained speckled small puncta within the 
haze, as well as a small number of larger bright puncta, as seen 
in cells expressing C99-GFP and APP-GFP (Supplemental Figure 
1B). However, the average puncta size in C83-GFP and AICD-GFP 
cells was approximately 1.2 and 1.3 μm2, respectively. Thus, over-
expressing APP and β-CTF, but not α-CTF or AICD, routinely 
induced formation of enlarged, bright intracellular structures. 
We also tested two APP mutants: APPM596V and APPSWE. APPM596V, 
which abolishes β-secretase cleavage, prevents production of 
β-CTF (57); APPSWE enhances β-secretase cleavage to increase the 
level of β-CTF (57). Both induced the formation of enlarged intra-
cellular structures (Supplemental Figure 1C).
We examined colocalization of APP or C99 with Rab5 in 
cotransfection experiments; APP-mCherry with GFP-Rab5WT 
(Figure 3B); C99-GFP with mCherry-Rab5WT (Figure 3C); and 
Rab5+ endosomes (26, 28, 37) was correlated with reduced endoso-
mal trafficking and signaling of nerve growth factor (NGF), leading 
to degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) 
(28, 38). Noteworthy was the inverse correlation between APP 
CTFs and the degree to which transport was reduced (28). Further, 
expression of either the wild-type human APP or a mutant APP also 
caused a reduction in NGF transport in Ts65Dn mice (28). Addi-
tionally, the γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) semagacestat, which elim-
inates all Aβ species while increasing APP-CTF levels, has shown 
severe adverse effect in clinical trials, which is likely associated 
with APP CTFs in AD patients (13, 14, 39, 40). APP CTFs have since 
been shown to induce neuronal dysfunction and cognitive deficits 
in animal models (41–44).
We investigated the mechanism and physiological significance 
of excessive APP and its CTFs on neuronal function by examining 
endosomal trafficking of NGF (45–47), critical for BFCNs (48–50). 
Retrograde axonal trafficking of NGF to BFCN soma is mediated by 
Rab5+ endosomes (48, 49, 51, 52). The selective loss of NGF signals is 
a prominent feature in both AD and DS. We demonstrated that full-
length APPWT, a β-cleavage–resistant mutant (APPM596V), the familial 
AD (FAD) Swedish mutant (APPSWE), and β-CTF all induced Rab5 
activation and enlargement of Rab5+ endosomes. Furthermore, 
expression of full-length APPWT or β-CTF impaired NGF signaling 
and retrograde axonal transport, resulting in atrophy of BFCNs. 
These effects were rescued by expression of a dominant-negative 
Rab5 mutant both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating a direct role 
for increased Rab5 activation in disruption of NGF trafficking and 
signaling in AD and DS. Thus, activation of Rab5 is an early neuropa-
thology that may contribute to neurodegeneration in these diseases.
Results
Rab5+ endosomes were enlarged in cultured BFCNs from Ts65Dn mice. 
To study the mechanism(s) by which App gene dose impacts the 
endosomal pathway, we used primary BFCNs from Ts65Dn mice, 
harboring three copies of the App gene (28, 38, 53). E18 BFCNs 
from Ts65Dn mice and 2N controls were dissected and cultured in 
vitro for 7 days (DIV7). Immunostaining was used to confirm the 
presence of cholinergic, NGF-responsive neurons in the culture 
with specific antibodies against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), 
a marker for cholinergic neurons, and TrkA, the receptor for NGF. 
The majority of neurons (>90%) were positive for both markers 
(Figure 1A). Rab5+ puncta, as stained with a specific antibody, were 
seen in cell bodies and in processes. In 2N neurons, Rab5+ puncta, 
of various sizes, showed a uniform, smoothly rounded shape (Fig-
ure 1B, arrowheads). In Ts65Dn neurons, puncta were larger and 
their shapes less uniform, frequently appearing as lobular. The 
average area of puncta was significantly (P < 0.0001) increased 
by approximately 60% in Ts65Dn as compared with 2N neurons 
(Figure 1C). Histogram analysis showed that Ts65Dn neurons had 
a significant decrease in the number of the smallest Rab5+ puncta 
(<0.3 μm2), concomitant with a significant increase in the largest 
puncta (>0.6 μm2). In this largest bin, the increase was approxi-
mately 4-fold of that in 2N neurons. Thus, Rab5+ endosomes were 
markedly altered in Ts65Dn neurons (Figure 1D).
The increase in Rab5+ puncta size was likely due to enhanced 
activation of Rab5, i.e., GTP-Rab5 (22), which induces homotypic 
fusion of early endosomes, causing their enlargement (19, 22, 23,

Accumulation of β-CTF (C99) induces synaptic toxicity 
with a detrimental effect on neuronal function (41–43, 58–60). 
To explore whether C99-induced changes might be reflected in 
endosome structure and function, we tested APPSWE-YFP and 
APPM596V-YFP; expression of APPSWE provided a means to markedly 
increase C99 (57), while APPM596V enabled us examine the effect of 
full-length APP in the absence of C99 (57). These constructs were 
coexpressed in PC12 cells with mCherry-Rab5WT. Cells express-
ing either APPSWE (Figure 4A) or APPM596V (Figure 4B) exhibited 
enlarged intracellular structures similar to those seen with full-
length APP and C99 (Figure 3, B and C). These large circular struc-
tures, albeit to a more dramatic extent in cells expressing APPM596V 
(Figure 4B), had a bright rim and a dark center, and colocalized 
extensively with mCherry-Rab5WT, indicating that full-length APP 
and C99 act to increase the size of early endosomes.
We predicted that increased Rab5 activation would produce 
similar effects. Indeed, extremely large vesicular structures were 
C83-GFP with mCherry-Rab5WT (Figure 3D). As a control, 
EGFP was also cotransfected with mCherry-Rab5WT (Figure 
3A). Cotransfection of mCherry-Rab5WT with EGFP yielded 
small cytoplasmic Rab5+ puncta, with an increase in the number 
located in the perinuclear region (Figure 3A). APP+ puncta were 
typically circular and quite large, with a bright rim and a dark 
center (Figure 3B); these structures colocalized with mCherry- 
Rab5WT (Figure 3B). C99 expression induced large puncta that 
also colocalized with mCherry-Rab5WT (Figure 3C). Though 
APP and C99 induced very similar changes, the overall extent 
of colocalization with Rab5 appeared to be greater for C99 (Fig-
ure 3, B and C). C83 expression (Figure 3D) did not induce these 
changes; the size and distribution of early endosomes were 
similar to the EGFP-expressing control (Figure 3A), except that 
in these small vesicles, C83 colocalized with mCherry-Rab5WT 
(Figure 3D). Thus, overexpression of APP and C99, but not C83, 
resulted in enlargement of early endosomes.

very different effects on Rab5+ endosomes. Consistent with 
reports that altered processing or increased gene dose of APP con-
tributed to enlargement of Rab5+ endosomes in AD and DS (18, 26, 
36), these results have shown that both full-length APP and β-CTF 
induce enlargement of Rab5+ early endosomes, likely through 
upregulating Rab5 activation.
Full-length APP and C99 induced endosomal enlargement by 
enhancing activation of Rab5. To determine whether increased 
expression of full-length APP and C99 enhanced activation of 
Rab5, the full-length APP-GFP, APPSWE-YFP, APPM596V-YFP, or 
seen within the cytoplasm of the cell expressing either Rabex-5–
GFP (RAB guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 for Rab5) (ref. 61 
and Figure 4C) or GFP-Rab5Q79L, a constitutively active mutant of 
Rab5 (ref. 62 and Figure 4D). Colocalization with mCherry-Rab5WT 
was readily appreciated in these cells (Figure 4, C and D).
Quantitative analysis confirmed that overexpression of the 
full-length APP, or two APP mutants (APPM596V, APPSWE), or C99 
significantly increased the size of Rab5+ puncta (Figure 4, E and 
F). C83 had no significant impact in these measures (Figure 4, E 
and F), providing further evidence that β-CTF and α-CTF have

with App gene dose in mouse brain tissues.

were quantitated and normalized against

tested a GSI (BMS-299897) that blocks production of all Aβ spe-
cies while increasing the level of C99 (40, 63–70). Treatment of 
PC12 cells with 1 μM GSI for 48 hours caused a marked increase 
in the level of CTFs, as detected by immunoblotting with an anti-
body specific to the C-terminus of APP, with little effect on the 
level of full-length APP (Figure 5C).  In comparison with vehicle 
treatment, GSI treatment of cells expressing mCherry-Rab5WT 
for 48 hours induced apparent enlargement of mCherry-Rab5WT 
endosomes (Figure 5D). Quantitative analysis showed that GSI 
treatment induced a significant decrease in the size of smaller 
 
mCherry-Rab5WT puncta (0.2–0.4 μm2), with a concomitant 
increase in larger puncta (0.6 to ≥1.0 μm2) (Figure 5E).
C99-GFP each was expressed in PC12M cells. EGFP was used as 
a negative control and Rabex-5 as a positive control. Twenty-four 
hours after transfection, GTP pull-down assays were used to mea-
sure the level of activated Rab5 (56). Each of the APP constructs 
and C99 induced a large increase in activated Rab5, as did Rabex-5 
(Figure 5, A and B). In contrast, neither C83-GFP nor AICD-GFP 
induced increased Rab5 activation (Figure 5, A and B; see also Sup-
plemental Figure 2A). The data thus demonstrate that full-length 
APP, APPSWE, APPM596V, and C99 all induced activation of Rab5 and 
enlargement of early endosomes.
To ask whether increased levels of C99, not Aβ peptides, 
were responsible for the increase in Rab5 endosomal size, we

To test whether increased Rab5 activation was necessary 
for the effect of APP-GFP or C99-GFP on endosomal size, we 
coexpressed these constructs with a dominant-negative mutant, 
mCherry-Rab5S34N (22, 55), which resulted in the disappearance of 
bright intracellular GFP foci (Supplemental Figure 1, D versus B). 
Quantitative analyses revealed a reduction in both the size (Sup-
plemental Figure 1E) and number (Supplemental Figure 1F) of 
GFP puncta, as was evident in the frequency distribution of GFP+ 
vesicles (Supplemental Figure 1G). We thus conclude that overex-
pression of APP or C99 acted through Rab5 activation to increase 
size across the entire population of early endosomes.
Full-length APP or C99 inhibited NGF-mediated neurite out-
growth in PC12M cells. Endocytosis is essential for NGF-mediated 
neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (71, 72). Increased Rab5 activation 
compromised endocytic trafficking of NGF signaling complexes 
and blocked NGF signaling in PC12 cells (71). PC12M cells were 
transfected with EGFP, full-length APP-GFP, C99-GFP, C83-GFP, 
APPM596V–YFP, or Rabex-5–GFP. NGF (50 ng/ml) was added to the 
culture 24 hours after transfection to induce differentiation for 2 
days. The length and number of neurites were quantitated. Rep-
resentative images are shown in Figure 6A, and the quantitative 
results in Figure 6, B and C. Cells transfected with EGFP demon-
strated numerous long, neuron-like processes, some terminating 
in growth cone–like structures; on average there were 3.75 ± 0.17 
neurites/cell (Figure 6B). The mean length of neurites in EGFP-
expressing cells was 91.98 ± 4.08 μm (Figure 6C). PC12M cells 
transfected with APP-GFP, APPM596V-YFP, or C99-GFP demon-
strated a significant reduction in both the number of neurites/cell 
Figure 5. APP, APP mutants, or C99 induced hyperactivation of Rab5 in PC12M cells. PC12M cells were cultured and transfected with the indicated con-
structs. The levels of GTP-Rab5 were assayed as in Figure 2. The levels of total Rab5 were blotted as loading controls (A). The results were quantitated and 
are presented in B. The level of GTP-Rab5 in untransfected cells was set at 100%. (C) PC12M cells were treated with either vehicle or 1 μM GSI for 24 hours, 
and cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Both full-length APP (fl APP) and APP CTFs are shown. The 
levels of activated Rab5 and total Rab5 are also shown. (D) PC12M cells were transfected with mCherry-Rab5WT for 24 hours and were treated with either 
1 μM GSI or vehicle for another 48 hours. Cells were fixed and analyzed by use of a Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope with a ×63 oil objective lens. Repre-
sentative images of mCherry-Rab5WT puncta are shown. Enlarged mCherry-Rab5WT puncta by GSI treatment are highlighted in the inset (×1.6; arrowheads). 
Scale bars: 10 μm. The sizes of mCherry-Rab5WT puncta from 25–30 transfected cells were quantitated, and the size distribution pattern is shown in E. 
Data represent mean ± SEM of at least 3 independent experiments. All corresponding P values were calculated using Student’s t test.

in neurite outgrowth and number, we tested Rabex-5–GFP, which 
induced hyperactivation of Rab5 (Figure 4C and Supplemental 
Figure 3). Neurites were significantly fewer in number (2.35 ± 
0.20 neurites/cell) and shorter (39.33 ± 3.66 μm) with expression 
of Rab5ex-5–GFP (Figure 6, A–C).

neurites per cell; for those also expressing Rabex-5, the increase 
was statistically significant (Figure 6F). We thus conclude that the 
disruption of the effects of NGF signaling on neuronal differenti-
ation mediated by increased expression of APP and C99 was due, 
at least in part, to increased activation of Rab5.
Because sustained activation of the MAPK pathway con-
tributes significantly to neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells in 
response to NGF, we assessed activation of Erk1/2 in cells that 
structs were due to increased Rab5 activation, we cotransfected 
GFP-Rab5S34N/APP-mCherry or mCherry-Rab5S34N/Rabex-5–GFP 
into PC12M cells. Cells were then treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) 
to induce neurite outgrowth. Cells coexpressing Rab5S34N/APP 
or Rab5S34N/Rabex-5 showed a statistically significant increase in 
neurite length (63.21 ± 4.88 μm and 74.14 ± 3.84 μm, respectively) 
compared with cells expressing APP or Rabex-5 alone (Figure 6,

(Figure 8A). The results showed an increase in size of 18% for APP-
GFP, 27% for C99-GFP, and 29% for APPM596V-YFP in comparison 
to BFCNs expressing EGFP (Figure 8A). The distribution of Rab5+ 
puncta in BFCNs expressing these constructs also showed a shift 
in sizes from smaller to larger binned areas (Figure 8B), reflecting 
an apparent effect on the entire population of Rab5+ endosomes. 
We measured the level of GTP-bound Rab5. The results showed 
increases in activated Rab5, in comparison to the control, of 45.7% 
and 52.2% in BFCNs transfected with APP-GFP and C99-GFP, 
respectively (P < 0.05) (Figure 8, C and D). In contrast, overex-
pression of C83-GFP did not increase the level of GTP-Rab5 (Fig-
ure 8, C and D); nor did C83 expression induce an increase in the 
size of Rab5+ endosomes. Therefore, increased expression of APP 
or C99, but not C83, induced activation of Rab5 and enlargement 
of Rab5+ early endosomes in BFCNs.
C99, not C83, disrupted retrograde transport of NGF and inhib-
ited NGF signaling in BFCNs. Retrograde axonal transport and sig-
naling of NGF support the maintenance and function of BFCNs 
(46, 47, 51, 88). Because increased App gene dose reduced retro-
grade axonal transport of NGF from hippocampus to the basal 
forebrain in Ts65Dn mice (28), we asked whether APP and C99 
overexpression impacted retrograde transport of NGF in BFCNs. 
Quantum dot–labeled NGF (QD-NGF) was used to track the 
axonal transport of NGF by live cell imaging (89, 90). Primary 
cultures of rat E18 BFCNs were maintained in microfluidic culture 
chambers, in which axons are separated from the corresponding 
cell bodies (91). To examine the Rab5+ endosomes in axons, we 
expressed C99 and C83 following NGF treatment. Consistent 
with earlier studies (73–75), expression of C99 markedly sup-
pressed NGF-induced activation of Erk1/2 at both 5 and 30 min-
utes (Supplemental Figure 2, B and C). While having no effect at 5 
minutes, C83 induced a small decrease in pErk1/2 at 30 minutes. 
Therefore, APP and C99, and to lesser extent C83, impacted NGF 
signaling through the MAPK pathway.
Full-length APP or C99 induced enlargement of early endosomes and 
atrophy of BFCNs. BFCNs are selectively impacted in AD and DS (50, 
51, 76–82). NGF plays a critical role in supporting the differentiation 
and maintenance of these neurons (27, 48, 79, 83–87). The Ts65Dn 
mouse model recapitulates age-related atrophy of BFCNs, to which 
APP gene dose contributes prominently (28, 38). Importantly, neu-
ronal atrophy is correlated with APP gene dose–mediated disruption 
of retrograde NGF transport to BFCNs from the hippocampus (28). 
We asked whether APP or C99 compromised NGF signaling and 
trafficking in BFCNs in vitro. Following cotransfection of primary 
rat E18 BFCNs with mCherry-Rab5WT and APP-GFP or various CTF-
GFP constructs at 6 days in vitro (DIV6), we used live cell imaging 
to examine endosomes. Representative images are shown in Figure 
7, A–E. As in PC12M cells, BFCNs overexpressing APP-GFP (Figure 
7B, inset), C99-GFP (Figure 7C, inset), or APPM596V-YFP (Figure 7E, 
inset) exhibited enlarged Rab5+ endosomes, all showing extensive 
colocalization with Rab5. EGFP or C83-GFP did not cause these 
changes (Figure 7, A and D).
We quantitated the size of Rab5+ puncta in BFCNs that over-
expressed EGFP, APP-GFP, C99-GFP, C83-GFP, or APPM596V-YFP 
Figure 8. APP and C99 increased 
the level of GTP-Rab5 in BFCNs. 
(A) The size of Rab5+ endosomes 
in primary BFCNs from experi-
ments in Figure 7 was quantified 
using ImageJ. The endosomal 
size distribution for APP-GFP, 
APPM596V-YFP, and C99-GFP 
showed a shift in sizes from 
smaller to larger binned areas as 
compared with that for EGFP and 
C83-GFP (B). Data represent the 
mean value of three independent 
experiments. (C and D) The levels 
of GTP-Rab5 and total Rab5 
were also measured in BFCNs 
that expressed these various con-
structs. The level of GTP-Rab5 
in untransfected cells was set at 
100% (D). Data represent mean 
± SEM of at least 3 independent 
experiments. All P values were 
calculated using Student’s t test.

To ask whether overexpression of C99 impacted axonal trans-
port, we examined live imaging of axonal transport of QD-NGF 24 
hours after transfection. Time-lapse image series were captured, 
and kymographs were generated; representative images with corre-
sponding kymographs for each condition are shown (Figure 9, D–G, 
and Supplemental Videos 1–4). When compared with either EGFP- or 
C83-GFP–transfected neurons, there was a significant reduction in 
both the moving (i.e., instantaneous) (Figure 9H) and average (Figure 
9I) velocities of QD-NGF in axons of BFCNs expressing C99-GFP. 
The moving velocity of QD-NGF in C99-GFP–transfected neurons 
was significantly reduced with respect to both EGFP-expressing neu-
rons (by approximately 16.5%; P = 0.002) and C83-GFP–expressing 
transfected BFCNs at DIV7 with mCherry-Rab5WT together with 
EGFP, C99-GFP, or C83-GFP (Figure 9, A–C). The axons of neu-
rons cotransfected with EGFP showed diffuse mCherry-Rab5WT 
signals with occasional distinct rounded puncta (Figure 9A, 
arrowheads). A similar appearance was found in axons of neurons 
cotransfected with C83-GFP and mCherry-Rab5WT, with colocal-
ization of the latter in small puncta (Figure 9C). In contrast, the 
axons of C99-GFP–transfected neurons showed distinct differ-
ences. The signals for mCherry-Rab5WT were concentrated within 
varicosities containing enlarged Rab5+ structures; puncta were 
also seen between varicosities, with most puncta showing colo-
calization of Rab5 and C99-GFP (Figure 9B, arrowheads).

transported NGF-TrkA signals (46, 47, 92). E18 BFCN neurons 
that were cultured in microfluidic chambers were transfected with 
EGFP (Supplemental Figure 4), C99-GFP (Supplemental Figure 3), 
or C83-GFP (Supplemental Figure 4), followed by immunostaining 
of cell bodies with a specific antibody to pCREB. NGF (50 ng/ml) 
was supplied to only the axonal chambers for 72 hours before exami-
nation of pCREB. In comparison to EGFP- or C83-GFP–expressing 
neurons, there was a marked reduction in pCREB signals in C99-
GFP–expressing neurons (Supplemental Figure 4).
Since the size of BFCN soma is regulated by NGF (93), we 
examined the effect APP overexpression on NGF signaling by 
measuring the soma size of BFCNs 48 hours after transfection with 
EGFP, APP, C99, or C83; in each case, the media bathing cells con-
tained 50 ng/ml NGF. As shown in Figure 11A, the area of BFCN cell 
bodies that overexpressed APP-GFP (P = 0.0075) and C99-GFP 
 
(P = 0.0488) was markedly decreased. The sizes of BFCNs that 
overexpressed C83-GFP tended to be smaller than those trans-
fected with EGFP, but the effect failed to reach significance (P = 
0.3144) (Figure 11A). To ask whether C99-induced atrophy could be 
overcome by increasing the concentration of NGF, we set up micro-
fluidic chamber cultures and transfected cells with either EGFP or 
C99-GFP. The cultures were maintained in 10, 50, and 100 ng/ml 
 
NGF provided only in the axonal chamber for 72 hours before 
measurement of the size of neuronal somata. For EGFP-express-
ing neurons, increasing NGF concentration from 10 to 50 ng/ml 
resulted in a marked increase in size of approximately 150 to 190 
μm2 (Figure 11B). In contrast, increasing NGF from 10 to 50 ng/ml 
 
had no appreciable effect on soma size in C99-GFP–expressing 
neurons (Figure 11B). At 100 ng/ml NGF, C99-GFP–expressing 
neurons showed a small increase in soma size, but the increase 
was not significant, and cell body size was still smaller than that 
of EGFP-expressing neurons (Figure 11B). Therefore, C99 overex-
pression markedly impacts retrograde axonal trafficking of NGF 
signaling as well as the soma size of BFCNs.
To determine whether activated Rab5 contributed to 
reduced NGF retrograde transport and signaling in BFCNs, 
neurons (by 13.5%; P = 0.001) (Figure 9H). The moving velocities 
for QD-NGF did not differ among control, EGFP-expresssing, and 
C83-GFP–expressing neurons (P = 0.644) (Figure 9H). The average 
velocities of QD-NGF in C99-GFP–transfected neurons were also 
reduced, to 62.9% (P = 0.024) of those in EGFP neurons and to 62.6% 
 
(P = 0.015) of those in C83-GFP neurons (Figure 9I). Again, the 
average velocities of QD-NGF did not differ among control, EGFP-
expressing, and C83-GFP–expressing neurons (P = 0.979) (Figure 9I). 
In addition, we examined the number of stationary (pause) periods 
between moving segments. Such periods were significantly increased 
for QD-NGF signals within axons of C99-GFP neurons. The increase 
amounted to 36.4% (P = 0.021) as compared with EGFP- and 41.7% 
(P = 0.003) as compared with C83-GFP–transfected neurons, respec-
tively (Figure 9J). C99-GFP thus induced significant changes in retro-
grade axonal transport of NGF in BFCNs.
GSIs that block production of all Aβ species while increas-
ing the level of CTFs, including C99 (63–70), caused a marked 
increase in Rab5 activation and enlargement of Rab5+ endoso-
mes (Figure 5, C–E). We reasoned that GSI would disrupt retro-
grade axonal transport of NGF. Using the same culture system as 
for BFCNs overexpressing APP and its products, we found that a 
24-hour pretreatment with 1 μM GSI resulted in significant impair-
ment of retrograde axonal transport of NGF. Representative 
kymographs (vehicle versus GSI) showed significant differences 
from control cultures (Figure 10A and Supplemental Videos 5 and 
6). GSI treatment caused a marked decrease in moving velocity 
(Figure 10B); moreover, it reduced the percentage of NGF mov-
ing retrogradely (Figure 10C) while increasing the percentage that 
moved anterogradely or paused (Figure 10C). We conclude that 
C99 disrupts retrograde axonal transport of NGF in BFCNs.
Atrophy of BFCNs induced by C99 was prevented by dominant- 
negative Rab5. Reduced axonal transport of NGF would result in 
decreased transport of trophic signals from axons to cell bodies. To 
measure NGF signaling in BFCNs, we examined immunostaining 
for the phosphorylated form of cAMP response element–binding 
protein (CREB), an important element downstream of axonally 
Figure 10. GSI induced hyperactivation of Rab5 and inhibited retrograde axonal transport of NGF in BFCNs. Rat E18 BFCNs (DIV6) were cultured in microfluidic 
chambers, and both the cell body and the distal axonal chamber were treated with either vehicle or 1 μM GSI for 2 hours. Live imaging of QD-NGF was performed 
as described in Methods. (A) Representative kymographs derived from time-lapse image series of axonal transport of QD-NGF from vehicle- and GSI-treated sam-
ples. (B) Retrograde moving speed and (C) breakdowns of transport directionalities (retrograde, stationary, and anterograde) for vehicle- and GSI-treated samples.

age (Supplemental Figure 4). However, when coexpressed with 
APP695, the dominant-negative form Rab5DN, but not Rab5WT 
or Rab5CA, significantly reduced the presence of axonal blocks. 
Therefore, consistent with in vitro studies, these results support 
that APP acts, at least in part, through enhancing activation of 
Rab5 to induce deficits in axonal transport in vivo.
Discussion
Endolysosomal dysfunction is a characteristic of early neuro-
pathological signature of AD and DS (24, 26, 34, 36, 37, 97). How-
ever, it is unclear whether and how such change contributes to 
neurodegeneration (19, 26, 28, 29). Here, we show that full-length 
APP and its β-CTF, acting through increased activation of Rab5, 
induce endosomal pathology with marked deficits in trafficking 
and signaling of NGF in BFCNs. Our study has revealed a mecha-
nism by which APP and its products contribute to neurodegenera-
tion, raising the possibility that endosomal dysfunction is an early 
event in neurodegeneration in AD and DS.
At the cellular level, endosomal dysfunction, i.e., the abnor-
mal enlargement of Rab5+ endosome, is present prior to the 
appearance of plaques and tangles in AD or DS (26, 29, 97). We 
speculated that endosomal dysfunction might impact the trophic 
status of BFCNs. NGF is a target-derived neurotrophic factor that 
supports the survival, differentiation, and maintenance of BFCNs 
(50, 98). NGF signaling regulates expression of genes and cellu-
lar programs important for the BFCN phenotype, including cell 
size. Following endocytosis, the NGF
/TrkA signaling complexes 
are trafficked to Rab5+ early endosomes. These “signaling endo-
somes” are then retrogradely transported to the corresponding 
cell bodies to transmit NGF trophic signals (50, 98). Thus, axonal 
trafficking mediated by Rab5+ endosomes plays a critical role in 
maintaining the trophic status of BFCNs, and alteration in these 
aspects could potentially disrupt axonal transport, resulting in 
neurodegenerative disorders (88, 99–107).
Rab5-GTP, in concert with tethering proteins and effectors, 
promotes homotypic fusion of endocytic vesicles and heterotypic 
fusion of endocytic and trans-Golgi network–derived vesicles with 
the early endosome, resulting in the enlargement and matura-
we cotransfected C99-GFP with the dominant-negative Rab5 
mutant (mCherry-Rab5S34N) at DIV7 into rat BFCNs cultured 
in microfluidic chambers. The cultures were maintained for 
another 72 hours with only axonally added 50 ng/ml NGF. 
The mean soma size of these neurons was markedly increased 
as compared with control neurons expressing C99-GFP and 
mCherry (P = 0.007) (Figure 11C). The size of BFCNs that coex-
pressed mCherry-Rab5S34N was equivalent to that of BFCNs 
expressing EGFP and mCherry (P = 0.365) (Figure 11C). There-
fore, C99 acts to induce Rab5 activation to disrupt retrograde 
NGF signaling, resulting in atrophy of BFCNs. Taken together, 
the results indicate that APP and C99 both act through Rab5 
activation to impact the structure and function of early endoso-
mes, causing deleterious effects on the trophic status of BFCNs.
To validate in vivo that APP-induced disruption of axonal 
transport can be rescued by dominant-negative Rab5, we turned 
to a transgenic Drosophila model that expresses human APP695 
(94). Previous studies have demonstrated that these flies have 
significant deficits in axonal transport due to APP-induced 
axonal blockages consisting of synaptic vesicles among other 
organelles (95) (see Supplmental Figure 4, A and B). Segmen-
tal immunostaining of nerve axons in third instar larvae with 
an antibody against cysteine string protein (CSP), a synaptic 
vesicle marker, was used to assess axonal blockages (96). The 
APP695 line had an average of 107 ± 11.44 blockades per larva 
as compared with 2 ± 0.447 blocks per larva in the ApplGAL4 
line (Figure 12B, top row, and Figure 12C). We then performed 
crosses between the APP695 line and a strain expressing YFP-
Rab5WT, YFP-Rab5CA, YFP-Rab5DN, or mCD8-GFP (Figure 12A). 
The pan-neuronal driver UAS was used to drive the expression 
of all the transgenes used in the study. We chose mCD8-GFP 
as a control for the effect of protein overexpression because it 
is similar in size to YFP-Rab5. The average number of axonal 
blocks per larva was 18.40 ± 2.11 for mCD8-GFP, 16.80 ± 5.142 
for YFP-Rab5WT (P = 0.781), 34.60 ± 11.49 for YFP-Rab5CA (P = 
0.203), and 1.0 ± 0.548 for YFP-Rab5DN (P < 0.001) (Figure 12B, 
bottom two rows, and Figure 12D). Expression of mCD8-GFP or 
each of the Rab5 constructs alone did not induce axonal block-

another Rab5 GEF (108, 109), has been identified in a large-scale 
genome-wide association study of AD (110). Recruitment of such 
effectors (19, 111, 112) to endosomes would increase the level of 
Rab5 on these organelles.
There are at least two scenarios for explaining how increased 
activation of Rab5 impairs neuronal trophic signaling. The 
abnormally enlarged Rab5+ endosomes that carry NGF signals 
may experience greater difficulty in moving retrogradely within 
the axon, resulting in a net decrease in the signals delivered to 
the soma, eventually leading to a deficiency in trophic support 
for BFCNs. Increased Rab5 activation would also promote pre-
mature delivery of NGF signals to late endosomes/lysosomes, 
causing premature degradation of the NGF/TrkA signals (56), 
tion of early endosomes (22, 23, 38). Accordingly, one measure 
of the status of Rab5 activity is the size of early endosomes. Since 
enlargement of Rab5+ endosomes has been well established in DS, 
we asked might be the impact of increased levels of APP and its 
products. We found that increased expression of APP or its β-CTF 
led to hyperactivation of Rab5 and induced abnormal enlarge-
ment of the Rab5+ NGF signaling endosomes, likely impairing tro-
phic delivery via axonal transport.
Although the mechanism(s) by which increased levels of full-
length APP and its β-CTF result in increased Rab5 activity are 
unknown, a Rab5 guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) 
such as Rabex-5 — shown herein to produce the same effects as 
APP overexpression — could play a role. Interestingly, RIN3,

larvae show smooth CSP staining in larval segmental nerves, indicating no axonal transport defects (top left). Expression of human APP695 causes a 
severe axonal blockage phenotype (top right). The average number of axonal blocks/larva is shown in C. Coexpression of human APP695 with mem-
brane-bound mCD8-GFP also shows axonal blockages in larval segmental nerves (B, middle left, arrowheads), which was used as a control for the effect 
of protein overexpression on axonal blockages. Representative images for larval segmental nerves resulted from the cross between human APP695 with 
wild-type YFP-Rab5WT (middle right), constitutively active YFP-Rab5CA (bottom left), or dominant-negative YFP-Rab5DN (bottom right). Axonal block-
ages (arrowheads) were quantitated within the entire larvae for each genotype, and the average number of axonal blocks for each genotype is shown in 
D. Expression of YFP-Rab5DN with APP695 significantly reduced the amount of axonal blocks as compared with larvae expressing human APP695 with 
mCD8-GFP (P < 0.0001, Student’s t test). Data represent mean ± SEM. Scale bars: 10 μm.

VGSNKGAI . . . The AICD-GFP construct was made by deleting the Aβ42 
sequence from C99, resulting in: M(T)VIVITLVMLKKKQYTSIHHG . . . 
(T was changed to M for the translational start).
The pcDNA3-APP-EGFP was previously described (118), and the 
APPM596V-YFP and APPSWE constructs were as previously described 
(57). GFP-Rab5WT, GFP-Rab5Q79L, and GFP-Rab5S34N plasmids were 
from Marino Zerial (Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology 
and Genetics, Dresden, Germany). The mCherry-Rab5S34N, mCherry- 
Rab5WT, and APP-mCherry expression vectors were generated by 
subcloning the cDNAs into the pcDNA3-mCherry vector (56). A full-
length Rabex-5 cDNA was generated by PCR using a human brain 
cDNA library and was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector between Hin-
dIII and SalI. All sequences were verified by sequencing. The N-TER 
Nanoparticle Transfection System (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for 
transfection of siRNA against rat APP (Sigma-Aldrich PDSIRNA2D: 
SASI_Rn01_00086595 starting at 366) or the MISSION siRNA Univer-
sal Negative Control #1 (Sigma-Aldrich SIC001).
PC12M cell culture, transfection, and neurite outgrowth. PC12M 
cells were maintained and cultured (56). The cells were transfected 
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For outgrowth assays, the 
medium was changed to DMEM containing 50 ng/ml NGF for 48 
hours following transfection. Neurites were measured and analyzed 
using ImageJ (http:/
/imagej.nih.gov/ij/).
GTP-agarose pull-down assays and SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. 
The amount of Rab5-GTP was assayed following a published pro-
tocol (56). Briefly, mouse brain tissues or cultured cells were lysed 
(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM Mg acetate, 0.5% 
Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor), followed by centrifugation 
to produce supernatants. An aliquot of supernatants (15–20 μl) was 
saved as the loading control. The supernatants were incubated with 
GTP-agarose beads overnight at 4°C with rotation. The beads were 
washed and boiled. The amount of Rab5-GTP was measured by SDS-
PAGE and blotted with an anti-Rab5 antibody.
Established protocols were followed for SDS-PAGE/immuno-
blotting (105, 119). Equal amounts of proteins were separated on 
4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris precast gels (Invitrogen) and then elec-
trotransferred to PVDF membranes, which were blocked with 5% 
nonfat milk and probed with specific antibodies. All blots were cap-
tured using ChemiDoc XRS+ (Bio-Rad), and only blots within linear 
ranges were quantitated using ImageLab 3.0.1 software (Bio-Rad). 
All experiments were repeated >3 times.
Primary BFCNs culture and transfection. BFCNs were cul-
tured from rat E18 embryos or transgenic mouse E17 embryos as 
which would also decrease trophic support for BFCNs. There 
may be other mechanisms by which transport kinetics or the sto-
ichiometry of motor proteins (including kinesins) are altered on 
NGF signaling endosomes. For instance, the C-terminal domain 
of APP directly (113) or indirectly (114) binds to kinesins that 
may impact trafficking of NGF signals. APP can also potentially 
interact with TrkA to influence their trafficking and signaling, as 
demonstrated recently (75), for the Y682 residue of APP is appar-
ently a target for TrkA (115). Yet it is unclear how the interaction 
between APP and TrkA or phosphorylation of APP by TrkA is 
impacted in neurons under conditions where full-length APP 
and/or β-CTF is accumulated.
The adverse impact of β-CTF on synaptic plasticity and neu-
ronal function has attracted increasing interest (35, 41–44, 58). 
In our present studies, β-CTF, but not α-CTF, had detrimental 
effects on neuronal function, although they only differ in the first 
16 N-terminal residues (see Methods). We speculate these 16 res-
idues may play a role in mediating the adverse effect of β-CTF. 
Future studies will be needed to decipher the underlying molecu-
lar mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a GSI, while 
inhibiting production of Aβ species (13–15), induced marked accu-
mulation of β-CTFs and increased the level of activated Rab5 (Fig-
ure 4C), raising the possibility that excessive β-CTFs contributed 
to worsening cognitive function in AD patients (13–15, 40).
Endolyosomal changes predispose to other AD markers and 
pathogenetic events. The link with APP is obvious, especially in 
view of the trafficking of APP to the endosome and its process-
ing therein, including the production of CTFs and the Aβ pep-
tide. The impact of mutations in APP and presenilin on APP pro-
cessing and the early endosome are relevant to understanding 
how FAD creates endosomal pathology. The question of what 
links may exist between the endosome and plaque formation 
also deserves attention. Our study highlights the importance of 
endosomal function in regulating retrograde axonal trafficking 
and signaling of NGF and provides a mechanistic explanation 
whereby increased APP expression, via Rab5 activation, compro-
mises retrograde transport of NGF in BFCNs. Future studies will 
be needed to determine whether reducing Rab5 activation will 
prevent or reverse neurodegeneration in AD and DS.

(WT, CA, DN), APP695, or mCD8-GFP males, and the female lar-
vae that were non-tubby were dissected for analysis. Tubby female 
siblings that were Appl-GAL4;YFP-Rab5 (WT, CA, DN)/+ or 
 
ApplGal4;mCD8-GFP/+ were used as controls.
Larval preparations, immunofluorescence, and quantification. Third 
instar larvae were dissected and fixed, and segmental nerve immu-
nostaining was performed as described previously (96). Briefly, larvae 
were dissected in dissection buffer (2× stock containing 128 mM NaCl, 
4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, and 36 mM sucrose, pH 7.2), 
fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and incubated overnight with anti-CSP 
(1:10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of 
Iowa). Following incubation in secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 568–
anti-mouse, A-11004, 1:100, Invitrogen), larvae were mounted using 
VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Images 
were collected using a Nikon T2200 fluorescence microscope and 
analyzed with MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) (95, 96). Quantifica-
tion of blockages was carried out on collected images using ImageJ as 
described previously (96). For each genotype, images were collected 
from 5–9 larvae along their entire body length. Using the threshold, 
density slice, and particle analysis functions in ImageJ, we quantified 
and analyzed axonal blockages as described previously (95).
Statistics. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times indepen-
dently. To quantitate the size of endosomes, we counted 20–30 cells 
each time. Data represent mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses and calcu-
lation of P values were performed using Prism5 (GraphPad Software); 
Student’s t test was used for pairwise comparisons and 1-way ANOVA 
for multiple comparisons. P values less than 0.05 were considered 
statistically significant, and P values less than 0.01 were considered 
statistically highly significant.
Study approval. All experimental protocols involving the use of 
animals were approved by the IACUC of UCSD.

described previously (120). Briefly, basal forebrains were dissected, 
dissociated, and resuspended in Neurobasal with 10% FBS, B27, 
GlutaMAX, and 50 ng/ml NGF and plated for 4 hours. Maintenance 
medium (Neurobasal with B27, GlutaMAX, and 50 ng/ml NGF) was 
added to the cell culture and incubated for 24 hours before being 
replaced with antimitotic medium (maintenance medium plus 1 μM 
AraC) for 12 hours, followed by switching to maintenance medium. 
For transfection, 0.5 μg DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 were used. 
An approximately 15%–20% transfection efficiency was achieved. 
Cells were imaged 24–48 hours after transfection.
Immunofluorescence staining of BFCNs. BFCNs, cultured on PLL-
coated glass coverslips, were fixed at DIV7 in 4% PFA, 4% glucose 
for 15 minutes at 37°C and were permeabilized with 0.15% Triton 
X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes, followed by blocking with 3% don-
key serum in PBS for 1 hour. Neurons were incubated with primary 
antibodies (1:100 for goat anti-ChAT) overnight at 4°C, rinsed, and 
incubated with donkey anti-goat IgG–Alexa 568 conjugates (1:500) 
for 1 hour at room temperature. The samples were then incubated 
with the other diluted primary antibodies (1:100 for rabbit anti-TrkA 
and 1:100 for rabbit anti-Rab5B) overnight at 4°C. The samples were 
rinsed and incubated with biotin-SP–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit 
IgG (1:500) for 1 hour at room temperature. The samples were rinsed 
and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin (1:500) for 1 
hour at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 
(0.1 μg/ml). All images were collected with a Leica inverted micro-
scope (DMI6000B) with a ×100 oil objective lens.
Live cell imaging, axonal transport of QD-NGF, and confocal 
microscopy. PC12M cells or BFCNs were observed using the Leica 
inverted microscope, and images were captured using a Rolera MGi 
Fast 1397 camera (QImaging) with a ×100 oil immersion objective 
(HCX PL Fluotar, NA 1.3) (Figure 3, A–D, Figure 4, A–D, Figure 6, A 
and D, and Figure 7, A–E) (89). The microscope was equipped with 
an environmental chamber (5% CO2, 37°C). Immediately before 
imaging, maintenance medium was replaced by CO2-independent 
medium. ImageJ was used to measure the size of Rab5+ puncta.
For imaging of axonal transport in BFCNs cultured in microfluidic 
chambers (89, 90), 0.1 nM QD-NGF was added to the axonal com-
partment and incubated for 4 hours. Time-lapse images were taken at 
1 frame/second for a total of 120 seconds. Analysis of transport were 
performed using ImageJ.
For confocal microscopy, samples were fixed in 4% PFA for 15 
minutes at room temperature. Samples were then stained with anti-
bodies following standard protocols (ref. 56; Figure 1, A and B, Figure 
2G, Figure 5D, and Supplemental Figure 1, B–D) or were immediately 
mounted for transfected samples. The samples were examined by 
confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SPE) with a ×63 oil objective lens. 
ImageJ was used to measure the size of Rab5+ puncta.
Drosophila genetics. The UAS human APP695 strain was from 
Renato Paro (ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland) (94), and the UAS- 
YFP-Rab5.WT, 
UAS-YFP-Rab5.CA, 
UAS-YFP-Rab5.DN, 
and 
UAS-mCD8-GFP stocks were from the Bloomington Drosophila 
Stock Center. Expression of human APP695 with YFP-Rab5.WT, 
-CA, or -DN was achieved by crossing these UAS lines to the pan- 
neuronal GAL4 driver Appl-GAL4 (95). Male UAS human APP695 
and Rab5WT, -CA, and -DN or mDC8-GFP were first crossed to 
 
APPL-GAL4;B3/Pin virgin females. Males that were ApplGAL4/Y; 
APP695 or YFP-Rab5 (WT, CA, DN)/B3 were crossed to YFP-Rab5
