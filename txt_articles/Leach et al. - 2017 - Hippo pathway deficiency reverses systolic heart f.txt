Abstract
Mammalian organs vary widely in regenerative capacity. Poorly regenerative organs, such as the 
heart are particularly vulnerable to organ failure. Once established, heart failure (HF) commonly 
results in mortality1. The Hippo pathway, a kinase cascade that prevents adult cardiomyocyte 
proliferation and regeneration2, is upregulated in human HF. We show that deletion of the Hippo 
pathway component Salvador (Salv) in mouse hearts with established ischemic HF after 
myocardial infarction (MI) induced a reparative genetic program with increased scar border 
vascularity, reduced fibrosis, and recovery of pumping function compared to controls. Using 
TRAP (translating ribosomal affinity purification), we isolated cardiomyocyte specific translating 
mRNA. Hippo deficient cardiomyocytes had increased expression of proliferative genes and stress 
response genes, such as the mitochondrial quality control (MQC) gene, Park2. Genetic studies 
indicated that Park2 was essential for heart repair suggesting a requirement for MQC in 
regenerating myocardium. Gene therapy with a virus encoding Salv shRNA improved heart 
function when delivered at the time of infarct or after ischemic HF post-MI was established. Our 
findings indicate that the failing heart has a previously unrecognized reparative capacity involving 
more than cardiomyocyte renewal.

 Graphical abstract
HF, the inability of the heart to pump blood, has no definitive treatment except heart 
transplantation or Ventricular Assist Device3. In HF, physiologic compensatory mechanisms 
place strain on cardiomyocytes and promote cardiomyocyte loss and fibrosis in pathologic 
remodeling4–6. Hippo pathway activation, including Mst and Lats kinases and Salvador 
(Salv) adaptor, results in phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of transcriptional cofactors 
Yap and Taz that cooperatively bind DNA with Tead factors2,7. Concurrent Salv or Lats1 and 
Lats2 deletion with myocardial infarct (MI) improves heart function8–10. Yap target genes 
control proliferation, cytoskeletal remodeling, and protect plasma membrane from 
contractile stress9. Maladaptive activation of Hippo signaling occurs in human HF and 
mouse ischemia reperfusion11,12. To determine if endogenous cardiomyocyte renewal can be 
increased in HF, we deleted Salv in a mouse model of ischemic HF (iHF) post-MI. The 
Hippo pathway represses a reparative genetic program in iHF that includes cardiomyocyte 
proliferation and survival genes.
Western blots on iHF and nonischemic HF (HF) human samples revealed that pYap and 
pLats serine 909 levels were higher and Salv levels unchanged in iHF and HF than controls 
(Fig. 1a-f, Extended Data Fig. 1a-c). We generated αMHC-mcm;Salv f/f (SalvCKO) mice 
with iHF post-MI (Fig. 2a). Echocardiography three weeks post-MI before tamoxifen, 
revealed shams had an average ejection fraction (EF) of 64±12% and fractional shortening 
(FS) of 35±8% (Fig. 2a-c). Post-MI, mice had an average EF of 36±11% and FS of 18±6% 
(Fig. 2a-c)13. End-systolic variables showed increased systolic left ventricle (LV) chamber 
diameters (Sham 2.7+/−0.6mm, MI 4.1±0.5mm) and volumes (Sham 29+/−18μL, MI 
76±23μL) (Extended Data Fig. 2a-d). Diastolic indices were unchanged indicating iHF was 
a result of systolic dysfunction (Extended Data Fig. 2b, d). Other iHF signs included 
pulmonary fluid buildup, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, increased natriuretic peptide B 
(BNP) serum levels, and increased body weights (Extended Data Fig. 2e-j).
3 weeks post-MI, we deleted Salv in cardiomyocytes and performed echocardiography every 
2 weeks until 9 weeks post-MI (6 weeks after tamoxifen injection) (Fig. 2a-c, Extended Data 
Fig. 2a-d, k, l). At 9 weeks post-MI, SalvCKO had improved function (EF; SalvCKO MI 
59%±13%, Ctrl MI 38±9%, p=0.001) similar to sham controls (EF; SalvCKO MI 59%
±13%, Ctrl and SalvCKO Sham 65%±8%, p=1)(Fig. 2c).
9 week post-MI control hearts had remodeled scars whereas SalvCKO hearts showed less 
fibrosis and more LV cardiomyocytes (fibrosis: Ctrl 56±12%, SalvCKO 36 ±15%; CM 
number: Ctrl 1×105±8×104, SalvCKO 6×105±2×105) (Fig. 2d-j). We defined three 
qualitative categories of damage in SalvCKO hearts post-MI (Fig. 2d, e). Category I,

 observed in 10% of SalvCKO cohort (N=1 of 10), recovered most LV cardiomyocytes. 
Category II, observed in 80% of SalvCKO hearts (N=8 of 10), had an equal amount of 
fibrotic and cardiomyocyte area in LV. Category III, observed in 10% of SalvCKO hearts, 
had few LV cardiomyocytes with a remodeled scar (N=1 of 10) (Fig. 2d-f). The relationship 
between fibrosis and function was described by a second order polynomial suggesting that 
fibrosis is tolerated to maintain cardiac function (Fig. 2g).
3 weeks post-MI, all hearts had LV infarcts, (Extended Data Fig. 3). At two time points, 
hearts were collected one week prior to echocardiography for histopathology. We discuss 
those time points as a 2 week range (ie. 4-5 and 6-7 weeks post-MI). There were no 
differences between groups at 4-5 weeks and 6-7 weeks post-MI (Fig. 2b, c, f, Extended 
Data Fig. 4,5). At 6 weeks post-MI, Myh7, Nppa, and Nppb, associated with adult 
cardiomyocyte remodeling, were upregulated in control iHF but not SalvCKO (Extended 
Data Fig. 6a).
SalvCKO hearts at 6 weeks post-MI had a three fold increase in BZ capillary density and 
increased endothelial markers, isolectin B4 and CD-31 compared to controls (Extended Data 
Fig. 6b-e). Cardiomyocyte-enriched TRAP RNA revealed increased vasculogenesis genes 
encoding angiopoietins, fibroblast growth factors, and vascular endothelial growth factors in 
cardiomyocytes of SalvCKO MI hearts (Extended Data Fig. 6f).
We found SalvCKO hearts had 2% to 3% cardiomyocyte EdU incorporation at 4 and 6 
weeks post-MI and approximately 1% at 9 weeks post-MI (Fig. 2k, l). Phospho-histone H3 
IF revealed M-phase cardiomyocytes 9 weeks post-MI in SalvCKO MI mice (Fig. 2m, n). 
Hence, cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry was diminished in SalvCKO mouse hearts at 9 weeks 
post-MI as cardiomyocytes repaired the tissue defect.
Lineage tracing by αMHC-mcm transgene revealed mosaic labeling of BZ cardiomyocytes 
(Fig. 2o). At 4-weeks post-MI, BZ had equivalent numbers of GFP-positive cardiomyocytes 
in controls (33%±7%) and SalvCKO (22%±2%) (Fig. 2o, p). At 9-weeks post-MI GFP-
positive BZ cardiomyocytes were enriched in SalvCKO (Ctrl MI 41%±6%, SalvCKO MI 
91%±4%) (Fig. 3o, p) indicating that most new, reparative BZ cardiomyocytes are derived 
from pre-existing cardiomyocytes rather than Myh6-negative cardiac stem cells that would 
be GFP-negative. Cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area was reduced, suggesting a more 
primitive phenotype, in SalvCKO mice at 9 weeks post-MI14 (Fig. 2q).
We sequenced Total-RNA and TRAP-RNA from BZ 6 weeks post-MI (Extended Data Fig. 
7a-d). Total-RNA revealed upregulated genes (N=932) in SalvCKO BZ were involved in 
oxidative phosphorylation, RNA processing, stress response, cell cycle, and muscle 
contraction (Fig. 3a-c, Extended Data Fig. 8a). SalvCKO BZ downregulated genes (N=792) 
included developmental genes, glycolytic metabolism genes, and connective tissue genes 
including pro-fibrotic genes like Tgfbr1, Ctgf, and Pdgfrδ (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 
8a)15,16.
Comparison of TRAP-seq, enriched for cardiomyocyte translating RNA (Fig. 3e,f), to total 
RNA-seq revealed that TRAP-seq was enriched for cardiomyocyte genes and depleted of 
non-cardiomyocyte genes (Fig. 3g-i, Extended Data Fig. 8b). Non-translated LncRNAs were

 depleted from TRAP-seq (Fig. 4I, Extended Data Fig. 8b). Comparison of total RNA-seq to 
TRAP-seq revealed total RNA and TRAP-seq groups clustered separately (Fig. 3j). 
SalvCKO MI TRAP-seq clustered closely to control sham TRAP-seq data revealing that 
Hippo deficient cardiomyocytes expressed a genetic program similar to control shams (Fig. 
3j).
We compared TRAP-seq of control post-MI and sham (Ctrl MI vs Ctrl Sham) to determine 
cardiomyocyte gene expression changes during iHF post-MI (Extended Data Fig. 8c-f). One 
upregulated category was peptide metabolic processes including Akt1 that exacerbates HF 
when chronically expressed17(Extended Data Fig. 8d, f). Genes that respond to reactive 
oxygen species, such as GstP1 and Gpx3, were upregulated as was Clusterin, known to be 
upregulated in human HF18. Another upregulated gene category, actin filament based 
process, is consistent with observations that cytoskeletal components are upregulated in 
human HF19. Downregulated gene categories included chromatin organization and blood 
vessel development consistent with known gene expression changes in HF20,21(Extended 
Data Fig. 8e, f). Genes involved in organelle fission, such as mitochondrial fission, were 
downregulated. Disruption of mitochondrial fission and fusion can lead to HF22 (Extended 
Data Fig. 8e, f).
We compared TRAP-seq between SalvCKO and control hearts post-MI (SalvCKO MI vs 
Ctrl MI) (Fig. 3f). Upregulated genes (N=365) included cell cycle genes, consistent with 
previous studies (Fig. 3k, Extended Data Fig. 8g)8,9. Other upregulated genes included genes 
involved in heart contraction, heart growth, and cellular response to stress suggesting that 
SalvCKO cardiomyocytes were recovering the mature cardiomyocyte phenotype with an 
effective stress response. Downregulated genes (N=261) in SalvCKO cardiomyocytes post-
MI included translation, protein metabolism including ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, and 
inflammation (Fig. 3l, Extended Data Fig. 8g), indicating that inflammation and mis-folded 
protein response were more effectively resolved in SalvCKO MI.
Park2, a Yap target gene, was upregulated in SalvCKO TRAP-seq (Fig. 3m)9. Park2 encodes 
a ubiquitin ligase involved in MQC, a surveillance mechanism to recycle damaged 
mitochondria23. Park2 is recruited to damaged mitochondria to direct mitochondria into 
mitophagy pathway that salvages damaged mitochondria. Park2 protein levels are reduced in 
human HF (Fig. 4a,b Extended Data Fig. 9a-c). Moreover, Park2 deletion in adult mice 
results in dilated cardiomyopathy post-MI24. Similar to Yap, Park2 is required for P1 cardiac 
regeneration (Extended Data Fig. 9d-i)25.
We tested if Park2 was required for regeneration in P8 SalvCKO8. After P8 MI, SalvCKO 
had higher mitochondrial DNA content and increased Park2 protein levels (Extended Data 
Fig. 10a,b), suggesting that MQC is more active in SalvCKO hearts. Park2 was required for 
recovery of myocardial function in SalvCKO hearts after P8 MI, (Extended Data Fig. 10c-
g). Interestingly, although myocardial function was reduced, fibrosis did resolve in 
SalvCKO;Park2−/− hearts, indicating a myocardial-autonomous requirement for Park2 in 
SalvCKO neonatal hearts (Extended Data Fig. 10c, g).

 Park2 was required for cardiac function recovery in adult iHF (Fig. 4c-g). Compared to 
SalvCKO mice, double mutant SalvCKO;Park2−/−mice didn’t recover contractile function 
(Fig. 4c,d). However, unlike SalvCKO adult hearts and SalvCKO;Park2−/− neonatal hearts 
(Extended Data Fig. 10c), scar failed to resolve in SalvCKO;Park2−/− adult hearts revealing 
a differential requirement for Park2 in neonatal versus adult fibrosis resolution (Fig. 4e-g).
We engineered a viral vector to knockdown Salv in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4h, i). Direct 
myocardial viral injection at the time of MI or systemic viral injection 3 weeks post-MI 
resulted in improved cardiac function and cell cycle induction (Fig. 4j-o). Hippo pathway 
inhibition, genetically or with gene therapy, results in an effective stress response in iHF 
with organ failure reversal.
Since Hippo signaling is upregulated in human iHF, Hippo pathway inhibition may have a 
therapeutic benefit for iHF patients. We identified cardiomyocyte-directed, non-cell-
autonomous injury responses that improve vascular perfusion. New cardiomyocytes, derived 
from pre-existing cardiomyocytes, direct recovery of a BZ microvasculature by expressing 
vessel-promoting factors including FGF’s that are protective against cardiac damage26–28. 
iHF reversal requires a proliferative response and injury resistance since newly generated 
cardiomyocytes must withstand both mechanical and hypoxic stress. At risk cardiomyocytes 
also likely benefit from Hippo pathway inhibition.
Our data provide insight into Park2 function in cardiac regeneration. In addition to MQC, 
Park2 functions in mitochondrial maturation and in fetal-to-adult metabolic transition29. 
Park2 is essential for neonatal regeneration and for cardiac repair in non-regenerative P8 
SalvCKO hearts and in iHF. In P8 SalvCKO hearts, Park2 deletion was detrimental to 
cardiac function, but dispensable for fibrosis resolution. In contrast, in adult iHF, both 
cardiac function and fibrosis resolution were impaired in SalvCKO;Park2−/− mice. Park2 
requirements in cardiomyocyte function and fibrosis resolution are an area of future study.
Materials and Methods
Patient Samples
Three types of human heart tissue samples were used for this study: control samples 
(nonfailing, nontransplantable hearts, n=6), HF samples (hearts with nonischemic idiopathic 
cardiomyopathy in end-stage failure, n=3), and iHF samples (hearts with ischemic heart 
disease in end-stage failure, n=3). For Control and both types of HF, samples were obtained 
from the left ventricular apex. The HF samples were collected at the time of left ventricular 
assist device implantation, the area from which the tissue core is obtained. The tissue 
samples were provided by the Texas Heart Institute (THI) Center for Cardiac Support 
Cardiovascular Surgery Research and Cardiovascular Pathology Research in accordance 
with human research protocol approved by the Texas Heart Institute Institutional Review 
Board under which patient informed consent was obtained. Sample analysis was conducted 
in accordance with human research protocol approved by the Baylor College of Medicine 
Institutional Review Board for which additional patient consent was waived. The tissue 
samples were digested to obtain protein lysates with the following buffer: 50mM Tris-Cl 
(pH7.5), 150mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and protease/

 phosphatase inhibitors. Samples were homogenized with a Dounce tissue homogenizer, 
passed through a 22-gauge needle, and sonicated for 10 cycles (30 seconds on, 30 seconds 
off) in a Diagenode Bioruptor Pico Plus NGS. For western blot analysis, we used antibodies 
against total YAP (Novus # NB110-58358), pYAP (Cell Signaling # 4911S), pLats1 (Cell 
Signaling # 9157), Sav1 (Novus # NBP2-13282), Park2 (Cell Signaling # 2132S), and alpha-
tubulin (Sigma # T5168).
Mice
Adult C57/BL6×129/S mice, 8 to 10 weeks old were used for the heart failure studies, and 
underwent either a Sham procedure or an MI procedure. C57/BL6 and 129/S strains are 
weakly regenerative strains30. For the AAV9 experiments, adult (8-10 week old) ICR (CD1) 
mice were used. The regenerative characteristics of outbred ICR (CD1) compared to inbred 
strains has not been systematically investigated. At 3 weeks post-MI, we injected tamoxifen 
into mice to induce Cre activity in cardiomyocytes. Control (Ctrl) mice included tamoxifen-
injected αMHC-mcm; ROSAmT/mG(mTmG) mice, tamoxifen-injected Salvfl/fl mice, and oil-
injected αMHC-mcm; Salvfl/fl mice to control for Tamoxifen and cre recombinase 
cardiotoxicity31–33. SalvCKO mice included tamoxifen-injected αMHC-mcm; ROSAmT/mG; 
Salvfl/fl mice and tamoxifen-injected αMHC-mcm; Salvfl/fl mice. The ROSAmT/mG reporter 
was used to linage trace αMHC-mcm cardiomyocytes. Tamoxifen-injected αMHC-mcm; 
Rpl22HA mice were used as controls for TRAP experiments. For experiments involving 
TRAP SalvCKO mice, we used tamoxifen-injected αMHC-mcm; Salvfl/fl; Rpl22HA mice. 
For the P1 Park2 experiments, we used C57BL/6J and Park2tm1shn/j mice. For the P8 and 
adult double mutant experiments, we used αMHC-mcm; Salvfl/fl; Park2tm1shn/j mice injected 
with tamoxifen.
To achieve recombination of floxed alleles in the adult mice, tamoxifen dissolved in peanut 
oil was administered via intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 1 mg/day for 4 days beginning 
3 weeks post-MI. No tamoxifen was administered to the mice in the P1 experiments. To 
achieve recombination of the floxed alleles in the P8 mouse experiments, tamoxifen was 
administered at P7, P8, P9, and P10, at 0.5 mg/day dissolved in peanut oil, as previously 
described8.
All mouse procedures were performed in accordance with institutional and governmental 
guidelines, and approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee.
Surgical Procedures
Model of heart failure in adult mice—To induce MI in 8- to 10-week-old mice, we 
permanently ligated the LAD artery as previously described8. Briefly, mice were 
anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and then intubated. We exposed the heart by performing a 
thoracotomy through the fourth or fifth intercostal space and tied an 8-0 nylon suture around 
the LAD artery. The mice were allowed to recover for 3 weeks, and then heart function was 
analyzed by using echocardiography. Because the clinical definition of heart failure is a 20% 
reduction in left ventricular EF as indicated on echocardiography (i.e., from >50% EF to 
<40% EF in humans),34 only mice with a >20% decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction

 were included in the study13. Our observed rates of survival (64%) and inclusion (70%) were 
consistent with those previously reported (50%-60% and 54%-92%, respectively)13,34,35.
Model of myocardial infarction in early and late neonatal mice—To induce MI in 
neonatal mice, we permanently ligated the LAD artery on postnatal day 1 (P1) or postnatal 
day 8 (P8), as previously described8. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with hypothermia, the 
heart was exposed via thoracotomy through the fourth or fifth intercostal space, and an 8-0 
nylon suture was tied around the LAD coronary artery.
Echocardiography
Cardiac function was determined by echocardiography (VisualSonics, Vevo 2100, 
40Mhz-550S probe). After alignment in the transverse B-mode with the papillary muscles, 
cardiac function was measured on M-mode images.
Injury regions
Cardiac tissue regions used for RNA, or image characterization described as; whole heart 
(WH), ischemic zone (IZ, LV free wall), border zone (BZ, LV anterior and posterior wall), 
or distal zone (DZ, interventricular septum).
Histological analysis
Whole hearts were fixed with 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 7-μm 
intervals. Each slide had 10 sections, which started at the apex and ended at the suture 
ligation site (approximately 50 slides). Every 4th slide was stained with Masson’s trichrome 
to identify areas of fibrosis. To determine scar size we examined serial sections from the 
apex to the ligation suture site and calculated the average percent fibrosis of the midline 
circumference around the LV36. To quantify cardiomyocytes we used PCM-1 
immunostaining and methods as described37.
Immuno-fluorescence Experiments
To assess cell cycle entry, we added thymidine analogs to the drinking water for a duration 
of 4 days prior to dissection. The analog 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (IdU; 0.2 g/L, MP 
Biomedical, catalog #0210035701) was used at the 3 week post-MI time point prior to 
tamoxifen delivery. The analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU; 0.2 g/L, Santa Cruz, 
catalog #sc-284628A) was used for the 4, 6, and 9 weeks post-MI time points. IF 
experiments were performed on FFPE (formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections) or 
on fresh frozen optimum cutting temperature-embedded sections. The stains and antibodies 
used for these experiments included; Click-iT EdU kit, IdU staining (IdU cross-reactive 
BrdU antibody, BD Biosciences, 347580), mTmG lineage trace (endogenous mTomato and 
mGFP fluorescence), isolectin B4 (Vector Labs, FL-1201), CD31 antibody (Pecam, BD 
Pharmingen, 550274), PCM1 (Sigma, HPA023370), cTnT (ThermoFisher, MS295), wheat 
germ agglutinin (WGA, Vector Labs, RL-1022), and pHH3 (cell signaling, #9701).
Linage tracing was done using the Rosa26mT/mG reporter at 4 and 9 weeks post-MI in the 
BZ. A full dose of tamoxifen was administered, and mosaicism of the reporter was observed 
in the BZ. Mosacism was not observed in the DZ. We assume this is due to the variability of

 drug-included cre activity because of the poor BZ vascularity. The 4 weeks post-MI time 
point was used as a baseline to determine cre activity in the BZ. The.
RNA
Total RNA—Using trizol reagent, we isolated total RNA from the non-fibrotic myocardium 
(interventricular septum, anterior and posterior free wall) bellow the ligation suture.
Translating ribosomal affinity purification (TRAP RNA)—The TRAP method 
utilizes an inducible HA epitope-tagged ribosomal allele for the Cre-mediated cell-specific 
isolation of RNA38. By crossing this allele into the SalvCKO background and then 
performing TRAP-seq, we enriched for mRNAs that were loaded onto ribosomes in 
cardiomyocytes and determined the cardiomyocyte translating RNA profile. We quickly 
excised the whole heart from each mouse and obtained the LV anterior and posterior free-
walls (the myocardial border zone) below the ligation suture to isolate ribosomal-associated 
cardiomyocyte-specific RNA. The tissue was homogenized on ice in 1 mL of supplemented 
homogenization buffer (1% NP-40, 0.1M KCl, 0.05M Tris, 0.012M MgCl2, 0.1mg/mL 
cyclohexamide, protease inhibitors, RNAsin, 0.01M DTT). The samples were centrifuged, 
and the supernatants were incubated at 4°C for 4 hours with the primary HA-antibody (Cell 
Signaling, catalog #3724) and then overnight with protein-G magnetic beads (Pierce, catalog 
#88847). Bead-antibody RNA isolation was performed on the homogenate, which was 
washed with a high-salt buffer (1% NP-40, 0.3M KCl, 0.05M Tris, 0.012M MgCl2, 
0.1mg/mL cyclohexamide, 0.01M DTT). In samples with no expression of the Rpl22HA 
transgene, we recovered less than 1% of the total input RNA; therefore, we assumed that the 
RNA isolation was highly specific.
Real Time - quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)—Transcript levels were quantified by using 
RT-qPCR. First-strand synthesis was performed by using iScript reverse transcription super 
mix for RT-qPCR (BioRad, catalog #1708841); then, qPCR was carried out by using iTaq 
Universal SYBR Green super mix (BioRad, catalog #172-5121). All qPCR primers are listed 
in Supplementary Information Table 1.
RNA-seq library preparation and data analysis—To isolate mRNA from Total RNA 
and TRAP RNA samples, we used the Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT Micro kit. ERCC Ex 
Fold RNA Spike-In control mixes were added before mRNA purification. Ion Torrent RNA-
seq libraries were prepared with the Ion Total RNA-Seq kit v2 for whole transcriptome 
libraries. RNA sequencing was performed by using the Ion Proton system for next-
generation sequencing. Reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) and read counts 
quantified using STAR (version 2.5). Differentially expressed genes were detected using R 
package DESeq2 with the following parameters: threshold p ≤ 0.05, fold change ≥ 0.5, and 
FDR ≤ 10%. GO analysis was performed on differentially expressed genes (p<0.05) with the 
Metascape online platform, and annotation clusters with terms that had a p-value ≤ 0.05 
were included.
We compared our TRAP vs Total RNA analysis to the cardiomyocyte and non-
cardiomyocyte isolation data set (GSE49906)39. When sorted by fold change, the top 400

 cardiomyocyte-enriched genes extracted from the GSE49906 P60 mouse hearts, were on 
average 1.5 fold more highly expressed in TRAP-seq samples than in Total RNA-seq 
samples. Likewise, the top 400 non-cardiomyocyte enriched genes were on average 1.5 fold 
more highly expressed in the Total RNA-Seq data.
AAV9 targeting Salvador
First, three siRNA constructs targeting Salv were tested in vitro in primary isolated neonatal 
mouse cardiomyocytes. Then, a triple short hairpin (sh)RNA construct with flanking miR30 
sequences was cloned into the pENN.AAV.cTNT, p1967-Q vector downstream of GFP. 
Expression of both the GFP and the shRNA’s is driven by the cardiac troponin T promotor. 
The miR30-based shRNA design allows for efficient shRNA expression from an RNA Pol II 
promotor40. The resulting construct was packaged into the muscle-trophic serotype AAV9 
by the IDDRC Neuroconnectivity Core at Baylor College of Medicine. Two methods of viral 
delivery were used: direct myocardial injection at the time of MI (Salv KD-MI), or systemic 
injection by retro-orbital injection 3 weeks post-MI (Salv KD 3 weeks post-MI). Viral titer 
for efficient knockdown was done as described previously and shown to effectively knock 
down Salv41. For direct myocardial injection at the time of MI, the mice were given 2 or 3 
intra-myocardial injections by using a Hamilton syringe (50μL capacity) with a 33-gauge 
needle to deliver a total of 2×10^11 viral genomes (10 μl total volume delivered) into the 
ischemic risk area. In a separate cohort of mice, AAV9 was injected systemically via retro-
orbital injection to deliver a total of 1×10^12 viral genomes (50μL total volume delivered).
Statistical analysis
Throughout this study, we used either the Mann-Whitney U test or analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) with Tukey’ pairwise post-hoc test or Bonferroni’s post-hoc test to compare 
means and the F test to compare variance. All error bars show the standard error of the 
mean. Mice were assigned unique identifiers to blind experimenters to genotypes. A block 
randomization scheme was used to assign animals to groups on a rolling admissions basis to 
obtain adequate samples for each time point and each experiment. For echocardiography 
sample sizes were estimated using power analysis determined from our previously described 
experiments.
