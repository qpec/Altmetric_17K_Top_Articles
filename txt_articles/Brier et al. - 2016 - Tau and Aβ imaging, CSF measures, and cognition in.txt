Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by two molecular pathologies: cerebral β-amyloidosis 
in the form of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and tauopathy in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, 
neuritic plaques, and neuropil threads. Until recently, only Aβ could be studied in humans using 
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging owing to a lack of tau PET imaging agents. Clinical 
pathological studies have linked tau pathology closely to the onset and progression of cognitive 
symptoms in patients with AD. We report PET imaging of tau and Aβ in a cohort of cognitively

 normal older adults and those with mild AD. Multivariate analyses identified unique disease-
related stereotypical spatial patterns (topographies) for deposition of tau and Aβ. These PET 
imaging tau and Aβ topographies were spatially distinct but correlated with disease progression. 
Cerebrospinal fluid measures of tau, often used to stage preclinical AD, correlated with tau 
deposition in the temporal lobe. Tau deposition in the temporal lobe more closely tracked dementia 
status and was a better predictor of cognitive performance than Ab deposition in any region of the 
brain. These data support models of AD where tau pathology closely tracks changes in brain 
function that are responsible for the onset of early symptoms in AD.
Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized neuropathologically by the presence of β-amyloid 
(Aβ) plaques and tau immunoreactive neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuropil 
threads in the cerebral cortex (1). Autopsy studies demonstrate that Aβ and tau pathology 
accumulate in stereotypical spatial patterns, or topographies, over the course of the disease 
(2, 3). Topographic studies of AD-related pathology in vivo, until recently, have been limited 
to fibrillar Aβ (4, 5) owing to a lack of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents 
for tau pathology. However, a number of tau pathology imaging agents have recently been 
developed and are available for human studies (6).
Extant models of AD pathophysiology, such as the amyloid cascade hypothesis, establish a 
temporal ordering of markers, with the emergence of AD-related tauopathy occurring 
downstream to the accrual of Aβ pathology (7–11). Consistent with this proposal, markers 
of tau pathology correlate more closely with changes in cognition compared to Aβ measures 
(12). However, the prior lack of imaging agents has limited studies of tau to postmortem 
examinations (13–16) or measures that lack topographic information such as measurement 
of tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As a result, relationships between cognition and Aβ 
topography have been defined (17), but the relationship with tau topography is not defined in 
vivo. Without this spatial information, CSF tau measures may be assessing other forms of 
neurodegeneration related to cell death or synaptic dysfunction.
The use of both tau and Aβ imaging allows for the attribution of AD-related cognitive 
dysfunction to specific pathological processes and locations within the brain. Further, the 
spatial relationships between tau pathology and other markers of AD have not been 
established. Here, we examine how tau imaging topographies relate to clinical status, Aβ 
imaging, CSF measures of AD pathology, and neuropsychological performance. Tau and Aβ 
represent distinct pathological processes, but they are strongly related in the context of AD. 
Given that PET- and CSF-based techniques may measure similar processes (18), PET and 
CSF measurements of tau and Aβ may be related. Here, we assessed the relationship 
between tau PET imaging, Aβ PET imaging, CSF measures, and cognition in healthy 
control individuals and those with mild AD. Given extant models (8, 9) and limited autopsy-
based empirical data (13–15), we hypothesized that tau would be a stronger predictor of 
cognition than Aβ owing to its position later in the preclinical disease course. These 
relationships were investigated in vivo using multivariate statistical models well suited to 
identify PET topographies associated with the presence or absence of disease. We identified

 the relationships between Aβ and tau pathology in distinct topographies and correlated them 
with measurements of Aβ and tau in CSF and neuropsychological measures of disease.
Results
Data from 46 individuals were analyzed (36 cognitively normal controls, 10 with mild AD). 
Demographics of each subset of the cohort are provided in Table 1. Global cognitive and 
functional performance was assessed using the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale (19). 
Each participant underwent T807 (tau) (20) and florbetapir (Aβ) PET imaging and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). A subset of individuals also underwent lumbar puncture for CSF 
assays and neuropsychological testing. Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) with 
(when presenting regional data) and without (when presenting voxelwise data) partial 
volume correction were calculated within 42 bilateral anatomical brain regions of interest 
(ROIs) defined by FreeSurfer software (21, 22).
Cognitively impaired participants demonstrate elevated tau burden
Mean (across participants) tau and Aβ SUVR imaging data are presented in Fig. 1 
(representative single subject data are shown in fig. S1). The data were split into two groups 
based on the presence or absence of cognitive impairment. Cognitively normal (CDR0; n = 
36) participants showed minimal tau tracer uptake throughout the brain with the exception of 
the basal ganglia. Cognitively impaired (CDR>0; n = 10) participants exhibited markedly 
increased tau tracer uptake in the temporal lobes and throughout the cerebral cortex. Aβ 
imaging showed the known difference in measured Aβ deposition between cognitively 
normal and cognitively impaired groups (Fig. 1).
Distinct tau and Aβ topographies are associated with cognitive impairment
To assess the behavior of PET tau and Aβ pathology across participants, the imaging data 
were first decomposed into component topographies. This accomplished two goals: (i) it 
accounted for the correlation structure of the data across ROIs and (ii) reduced the number 
of statistical comparisons. Singular value decomposition (SVD) identified a small number of 
latent component topographies whose representation in single subjects explained a majority 
of the variance present in the data. In each participant, tau and Aβ pathology burden 
measured by PET imaging was assessed in 42 ROIs; many ROIs were highly correlated with 
other ROIs and could be more concisely summarized as topographies or combinations of 
ROIs. The PET imaging tau and Aβ data were arranged into participants (n = 46) by ROI 
matrices (M = 42) separately and subjected to SVD. PET imaging of tau and Aβ was best 
described as a combination of two component topographies (Fig. 2A). Both PET tau and Aβ 
imaging data were empirically determined to have two significant components (that is, rank 
= 2), suggesting that the two markers have similar signal-to-noise characteristics. For both 
PET tau and Aβ, the first topography roughly corresponded to the mean of the image (that 
is, regions were similarly positively weighted). The second PET tau topography was most 
strongly localized (or “loaded,” in SVD terminology) in the temporal lobe including the 
hippocampus. In contrast, the second PET Aβ topography was most strongly localized in 
frontal and parietal regions. This analysis demonstrated that PET imaging data for tau and 
Aβ exhibited strong autocorrelation across ROIs but that each had distinct topographies.

 In each participant, the representation of each of the two PET tau and two PET Aβ 
topographies described above was best estimated using regional weights derived from SVD. 
For each topography, these values were subjected to an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
with age, CDR, and presence of an APOE ε4 allele as factors (table S1). The two PET tau 
topographies were more strongly represented in participants with a higher CDR status (P < 
0.001) but were not significantly modified by age or APOE status (Fig. 2B). The first PET 
Aβ topography was not significantly associated with any variables of interest; the second 
topography was more strongly represented in participants with higher CDR status (P = 0.04) 
and moderately associated with increasing age (P = 0.08). In both the tau and Aβ data, there 
were statistically significant differences between the CDR0 and CDR>0 groups; however, 
there was a significant overlap particularly in the Aβ data (Fig. 2C). The separation between 
the CDR0 and CDR>0 groups was more marked in the PET tau data compared to the PET 
Aβ data. This visual observation was quantified as F values (table S1); these F values were 
an order of magnitude larger for PET tau than for PET Aβ (table S1). Thus, as measured by 
the CDR, representation of tau topographies was more strongly associated with dementia 
status across participants.
Evidence of preclinical AD is associated with pathological topographies
Inspection of Fig. 2B revealed that expression of each topography varied widely in the 
CDR0 participants, particularly with respect to PET Aβ topographies. CDR0 implies 
cognitive normality but not absence of preclinical pathology. Preclinical AD can be 
operationalized using CSF measures of tau and Aβ with simple scalar cutoffs. To most 
simply characterize the pathological status of the CDR0 participants, median splits were 
used to dichotomize participants as either CSF Aβ-positive or CSF Aβ-negative or tau-
positive or tau-negative. CSF that was Aβ- and tau-negative corresponded to healthy aging 
without pathology. Aβ-positive tau-negative CSF corresponded to stage 1 preclinical 
disease; Aβ-positive tau-positive CSF corresponded to stage 2 preclinical disease (23, 24). 
Stratifying CDR0 participants in this manner revealed that CDR0 participants with higher 
expression of the component topographies tended to have evidence of elevated Aβ or tau 
pathology in CSF (Fig. 2C). The effect of preclinical disease stage was more marked for 
PET Aβ, suggesting that tau pathology burden was more closely temporally linked to 
clinical status as measured by CDR and preclinical disease stage. The preceding results were 
reproduced in a larger sample of individuals who only had PET tau data available (see 
Supplementary Results and tables S4 and S5).
PET tau and Aβ, in distinct topographies, are strongly correlated
The previous analysis described the relationship between PET tau and PET Aβ topographies 
and disease stage. Next, the relationship between the PET tau and Aβ topographies was 
compared directly using canonical correlation. Canonical correlation is a multivariate 
generalization of the more familiar bivariate correlation. Canonical correlation identified 
both a PET tau and PET Aβ topography such that the data, when projected onto these 
weighted topographies, were maximally correlated. Thus, canonical correlation identified 
the topography of each pathological species that was mostly related to the other species. The 
present PET tau and PET Aβ topographies were represented by a single canonical 
correlation that explained 75% of the covariance in the data (Fig. 3). The weighted regional

 patterns of the two topographies were modestly correlated (r = 0.29, P = 0.062), which 
reflects the known divergence in the pathological topographies (2, 3). The PET data 
weighted and averaged according to these topographies were highly correlated (r = 0.92, P < 
10−18), which reflects the strong relationship between tau and Aβ when the appropriate 
topographies are considered. The PET tau topography was most heavily localized in the 
medial temporal lobe, parietal cortex, and precuneus and was most highly correlated with 
PET Aβ topography in the frontal and parietal regions.
Mean PET tau and Aβ correlate with CSF tau, phosphorylated tau, and Aβ42
PET tau and Aβ imaging techniques and CSF-based techniques may measure correlated 
pathological processes (18). Therefore, the two measures may be related. To investigate this 
relationship, the correlations between mean (calculated across all gray matter regions) PET 
tau and Aβ and CSF tau, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and Aβ42 were calculated (table S2). 
As predicted, mean PET tau positively correlated with CSF tau (r = 0.36, P = 0.029) and 
CSF p-tau (r = 0.29, P = 0.089) but did not significantly correlate with CSF Aβ42 (r = −0.25, 
P = 0.14); mean PET Aβ negatively correlated with CSF Aβ42 (r = −0.54, P = 0.006) but 
also positively correlated with CSF tau (r = 0.52, P = 0.0011) and p-tau (r = 0.49, P = 
0.0023). The negative correlations were due to CSF Aβ42 being reduced, not increased, 
during AD pathogenesis as more Aβ becomes deposited in the brain.
CSF tau and Aβ42 correlate with specific topographies of PET tau and PET Aβ
Penalized regression models (25–27) with either CSF tau or Aβ42 (separately) as an outcome 
and regional PET tau and Aβ SUVR (together) as predictors were fit to determine the 
relationship between CSF and regional PET measures. PET tau and PET Aβ topographies 
were considered together in the model, allowing for the data to determine the modality that 
best predicted the variable of interest. The critical feature of penalized regression is that the 
solution is sparse (that is, the regression βs corresponding to most PET tau and Aβ ROIs are 
set to 0), and only the most predictive ROIs receive nonzero regression β weights. The 
relationship between PET tau and Aβ topographies and CSF tau was examined first. The 
penalized model significantly fit the data (R2 = 0.96, Z = 4.72, P < 0.0001). The 
combination of PET tau and Aβ topographies that best correlated with CSF tau is shown in 
the top row of Fig. 4A (exact values are shown in table S3). CSF tau was equally related to 
PET tau (Σ|βtau| = 2.93) and PET Aβ (Σ|βAβ| = 2.54), as measured by the sum of the 
absolute value of the regression β values corresponding to PET tau and Aβ ROIs, 
respectively. This equal weighting was consistent with tau pathology being dependent on 
initial Aβ accumulation. Predictive PET tau regions included entorhinal and temporal cortex 
and the cuneus. The PET Aβ contribution was derived from the temporal and frontal regions. 
Similar topographies of predictive PET ROIs were found when predicting CSF p-tau; the 
overall correlation between the CSF tau and CSF p-tau predictive topographies was high (r = 
0.77, P < 10−16).
Next, the same relationship was investigated, but with CSF Aβ42 as the predicted outcome 
variable. The penalized model significantly fit the data (R2 = 0.34, Z = 3.22, P = 0.0006). 
The joint topographies of PET tau and Aβ that best correlated with CSF Aβ42 are shown in 
the bottom row of Fig. 4A (exact values are shown in table S3). Most of the regression β

 values were negative owing to the inverse relationship between CSF Aβ and pathology 
burden. In contrast to the CSF tau model, the predictive weight was more skewed toward 
PET Aβ (Σ|βAβ| = 0.46) compared to PET tau (Σ|βtau| = 0.26). This suggested that PET tau 
has relatively less predictive information relating to CSF Aβ42. The contributing topography 
from PET tau was primarily loaded in the superior portions of the cortex. The PET Aβ 
topography was primarily composed of frontal and parietal regions. The highly significant 
predictive power of both models suggested that there was a strong relationship between CSF 
and PET measures of tau and Aβ pathology.
Specific tau and Aβ topographies correlate with neuropsychological performance
To examine the relationship between pathology and cognitive function, the relationship 
between PET tau and Aβ topographies and neuropsychological performance composite 
scores was compared using the same penalized regression model as described above. Each 
participant underwent neuropsychological testing that was summarized into four composite 
scores summarizing the domains of episodic, semantic, working memory, and visuospatial 
processing and an additional overall (global) measure. Of these, episodic (Z = 2.42, P = 
0.0078), semantic (Z = 4.85, P < 0.0001), visuospatial (Z = 5.17, P < 0.0001), and the global 
score (Z = 3.97, P < 0.0001) were significantly predicted by penalized regression after 
correction for multiple comparisons, whereas the working memory composite was not 
significantly fit by the model. The combined PET tau and Aβ topographies that best 
predicted each cognitive composite are shown in Fig. 4B (exact values are shown in table 
S3). In each case, PET tau was the dominant topography with contributions to the model, 
quantified as the sum of the absolute value of the regression β, two- to ninefold higher than 
the contribution of PET Aβ. With the exception of predicting episodic memory, the 
topographies were sparse, including only temporal regions and basal frontal regions. The 
contribution of PET tau, specifically temporal lobe tau, in each tested domain demonstrated 
that tau was more closely related to cognition than Aβ.
We further investigated the correlation between PET tau and Aβ topography and 
neuropsychological composite scores in the CDR0 group only. In the domains that were 
significantly associated with PET tau and Aβ topographies in the full group, we refitted the 
models in the CDR0 group only and calculated the correlation between the resulting 
predictive topographies. The topography that was predictive of episodic memory scores in 
the full group was not correlated with the predictive topography in the CDR0 group (r = 
0.04, P = 0.70). Similarly, the topographies predictive of semantic memory performance 
were not significantly correlated (r = −0.01, r = 0.90). However, the topographies predicting 
visuospatial performance (r = 0.54, P < 0.001) and global cognitive performance (r = 0.19, r 
= 0.091) were correlated (although the latter showed a trend rather than significance). These 
data suggest that the relationship between pathology and neuropsychological performance 
varies over the course of the disease.

 imaging, CSF AD biomarkers, and AD-related cognitive impairment. A strong correlation 
existed between Aβ deposited in one topography and tau deposited in another topography. 
Tau imaging, both globally and in a specific topography, was significantly associated with 
CSF measures of tau-related neural injury. In a combined model, PET tau deposition was 
demonstrated to be more closely associated with cognitive function than Aβ PET imaging. 
Together, these results establish tau imaging as an important marker of AD-related 
pathology.
The Aβ imaging literature has grown over the past decade (4), whereas tau imaging is a 
relatively new addition to the field. FDDNP [2-(1-{6-[(2-[flourine-18]flouroethyl)
(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl)-ethylidine)maltononitrile] was the first tau imaging agent but 
had low signal-to-noise properties and also bound to Aβ, which precluded investigation of 
specific pathological species (28) or required coimaging with Aβ agents and elaborate 
subtraction procedures (29). Methodological studies (that is, biochemistry and small-animal 
studies) have identified several compounds that are specific to tau pathology and have 
favorable biochemical properties (30, 31). Human studies, to date, have been small (n < 25) 
and have identified PET tau topographies consistent with studies in postmortem brain tissue 
(20, 32–35). In this preliminary body of work, PET tau pathology burden in specific ROIs 
(for example, hippocampus) was correlated with cognitive performance and hippocampal 
volume (34, 35). These studies have demonstrated the utility of tau imaging agents in 
identifying tau pathology burden in vivo. Our study builds on those studies by examining a 
larger cohort at various disease stages and capitalizing upon the spatial information of PET 
by explicitly relating tau topographies to disease stage, Aβ imaging, CSF biomarkers, and 
cognition.
PET tau and Aβ imaging acquires data at a resolution of about 5 to 8 mm and samples 
thousands of voxels, but the true dimensionality of the data is likely much lower (36). This 
study identified two topographies for both PET tau and Aβ that explained most of the 
variance in the data. The two tau topographies were associated with disease severity as 
measured by the CDR. The first tau topography was homogeneously distributed across the 
brain, but the second was concentrated in the temporal lobe. Similarly, the first Aβ 
topography was broadly distributed across the brain, whereas the second Aβ topography 
localized primarily in the frontal and parietal regions and was significantly associated with 
disease stage. Notably, the separation between CDR groups was visually more marked with 
respect to tau burden (Fig. 2, B and C), although significant overlap remained. Overlap with 
respect to CDR status likely represents the variable relationship between pathological burden 
and cognitive symptoms often attributed to differences in host factors, for example, cognitive 
reserve (8, 23). This suggests that representation of pathologically associated topographies 
of both tau and Aβ indexes disease progression, but the relationship to cognitive impairment 
is more pronounced with respect to tau.
A key feature of AD is that it is a dual proteinopathy. One of the more debated mechanisms 
is how two pathological species progress in independent topographies (11, 37, 38). Although 
the topographies are distinct, this study uses canonical correlation to emphasize that these 
two pathological processes are related. The correlation between tau and Aβ can be 
remarkably high when the relevant topographies are considered. This suggests that for a 
Brier et al.

 given severity of Aβ deposition, the severity of tau pathology can also be estimated. The 
mechanism underlying the relationship between Aβ and tau in the generation of AD is 
unclear, but the empirical relationship is clearly evident.
In the absence of widely used tau PET ligands, CSF-based measurements of tau pathology 
burden have predominated in the AD field (39). CSF-based measurements afford certain 
advantages (for example, broad applicability) but do not provide topographic information 
afforded by PET imaging. Nevertheless, CSF-based measures and PET-based measures 
index similar pathological processes in the context of AD. As a result, a high correlation 
between mean PET tau SUVR and CSF tau was expected. Perhaps less intuitive, but 
commonly observed, is the strong relationship between CSF tau and PET Aβ SUVR, even in 
the absence of neurofibrillary tangles (40). This relationship could be understood in terms of 
the ordered nature of biomarker progression: once detectable tau pathology is present, there 
is already advanced Aβ pathology, allowing for a significant relationship (8, 9). The 
relationship between CSF- and PET-derived measures was topographically specific. The 
specificity of this relationship strengthens the argument that the identified relationships are 
disease-specific: elevated tau in the CSF is associated with tau deposition within regions 
known to be sensitive to AD-related tauopathy (2). Together, these lines of evidence suggest 
that the same pathological process is being measured by CSF and imaging techniques.
Understanding the contribution of tau and Aβ to cognitive symptoms, particularly early in 
AD, has been restricted owing to the lack of topographic tau information in vivo. Here, the 
predictive power of PET tau and Aβ topographies on neuropsychological performance was 
evaluated. In each investigated cognitive domain, the weight assigned to PET tau in the best-
fitting model was larger than the weight assigned to PET Aβ. This implied that tau burden, 
not Aβ burden, is more closely linked to cognition. This increased correlation suggests that 
tau and cognition are more closely linked, consistent with extant models of AD (8, 9). 
Furthermore, PET imaging data coupled with the present penalized regression approach also 
provide regional specificity. Temporal lobe tau tended to be the strongest predictor of 
cognitive performance consistent with the known focus of tau pathology. The selective 
nature of our model suggests that tauopathy severity in the temporal lobe is sufficient to 
predict cognitive impairment across the early disease stages investigated here.
A number of design and analytical decisions influence the interpretation of our data and 
resulting conclusions. First, the recent implementation of this tau tracer limits the number of 
participants who have been scanned. Thus, this study includes a small number of 
participants compared to Aβ imaging studies. However, the participants in this study were 
well characterized, which improves the reliability of our results. Also related to the recent 
development of tau tracers, the present results are cross-sectional in nature and do not 
capture the longitudinal course of the disease. Finally, a number of analytical decisions may 
influence these results. For example, tau and Aβ deposition was measured within ROIs 
defined by anatomical parcellation; there are other equally valid methods to define brain 
ROIs. The effect of these analytical decisions is unknown, but the present approach makes 
use of techniques previously implemented and well validated in the Aβ imaging literature 
(21).

 Together, these data provide important insight into the relationship between tau topographies 
and other measures of AD pathology and cognitive symptoms. This inference is made 
possible by the emergence of PET tau imaging agents. Tau imaging accurately discriminates 
disease stage assessed by the CDR, strongly correlates with CSF measures, in particular 
within temporal regions, and is more closely related to cognitive performance than is Aβ 
imaging. Thus, tau pathology appears to be more closely linked to cognitive dysfunction 
consistent with existing hypotheses. These data suggest distinct roles of PET Aβ and tau 
imaging going forward. PET Aβ will likely remain a powerful tool for early detection of AD 
pathology during the preclinical period. However, our data suggest that the close relationship 
between PET tau and disease stage and symptomatology will be critical for tracking the 
efficacy of disease-modifying therapies.
Materials and Methods
Study design
Forty-six participants were recruited from ongoing studies of memory and aging at the 
Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis. 
Participants underwent cognitive assessment with the CDR scale (19), and MRI and PET 
imaging with T807 and florbetapir. All participants with CDR>0 (that is, clinically 
impaired) carried clinical diagnoses of AD or mild cognitive impairment due to AD. A 
subset of participants also underwent lumbar puncture (n = 36) and neuropsychological 
assessment (n = 40). All participants or their designees provided written informed consent 
before participating in this study that was consistent with the regulations of the Washington 
University in St. Louis School of Medicine Institutional Review Board.
Neuropsychological assessment
A comprehensive neuropsychological battery was administered to all participants, typically 
within 2 weeks of the annual clinical assessment. Standardized test scores were averaged to 
form four composites [see (41) for details on construction of composites and the 
standardization sample]. The episodic memory composite included the sum of the three free 
recall trials from the Selective Reminding Test (42), Associate Learning from the Wechsler 
Memory Scale (WMS) (43), and immediate recall of the WMS Logical Memory or WMS-
Revised Logical Memory (44). The semantic composite included the Information subtest 
from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) (45), the Boston Naming Test (46), and 
the Animal Naming Test (46). The working memory composite included WMS Mental 
Control, Digit Span Forward and Digit Span Backward, and Letter Fluency for S and P. The 
visuospatial composite included the WAIS Block Design and Digit Symbol subtests and 
Trailmaking Test A and B (47).
Imaging
MRI and florbetapir data were acquired on a Biograph mMR scanner (Siemens Medical 
Solutions) in a single session. T807 data were acquired in a separate session on a Biograph 
40 PET/CT (computed tomography) scanner. Participants received a single intravenous 
bolus injection of 10 mCi of florbetapir and a single intravenous bolus injection of 6.5 to 10 
mCi of T807.

 PET data were analyzed using our standard technique (18, 19) implemented in the PET 
unified pipeline (http://github.com/ysu001/PUP). FreeSurfer segmentation (44) (http://
freesurfer.net/) was used as the basis of the quantitative analysis to obtain regional SUVR 
with cerebellar gray matter as the reference region. Partial volume correction was also 
performed using a regional spread function technique (19). For florbetapir PET, the data 
between 50 and 70 min after injection were used for the analysis, and for T807, the imaging 
data between 80 and 100 min were used instead.
CSF analysis
CSF (20 to 30 ml) was collected after overnight fasting as described previously (48, 49). 
Total and phosphorylated tau and Aβ42 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay [INNOTEST, Fujirebio (formerly Innogenetics)].
Dimensionality reduction and analysis of a single PET modality
PET SUVR, for both T807 and florbetapir, can be measured at the resolution of voxels, 
structurally or functionally defined sets of voxels, or the entire brain. This gives rise to data 
sets that appear to be high-dimensional (that is, many samples per imaging session) but can 
be represented by lower-dimensional projections. These bases can be identified using SVD 
or related procedures (for example, principal component analysis). In PET data, these 
composite factors represent topographies (that is, the weighted combination of brain 
regions), and the contribution of a given topography to an individual participant's data can be 
estimated. SVD was performed on the regional SUVR values (as variables) across 
participants (as samples) for tau and Aβ separately. The number of significant factors was 
determined by a permutation test.
Identifying the relationship between tau and Aβ topographies and CSF and 
neuropsychological performance using penalized regression
Penalized regression was used to identify the relationship between CSF tau and Aβ42 or 
neuropsychological Z scores (as outcome variables) and PET tau and Aβ topographies (as 
predictors). The penalty in penalized regression is enforced against the estimated regression 
βs (26). The family of penalized regression fit here is the elastic net penalty (27): the L1 
penalty component enforces sparsity (that is, many βs will be identically 0, not included in 
the model) (26), whereas the L2 penalty allows highly correlated variables to enter the 
model simultaneously (27). Elastic net models are well suited for data that are highly 
collinear such as the regional PET data. Model parameters (total penalty and relative 
contribution of L1 and L2 penalty) are chosen by cross-validation. Penalized regression 
models, like any machine learning algorithm, are prone to overfitting. To assess significance 
of the fit models, permutation resampling determined the distribution of R2 values under the 
null hypothesis.
Canonical correlation identifies relationships between tau and Aβ topographies
Description of the correlation between tau and Aβ topographies is accomplished using 
canonical correlation (50, 51). Canonical correlation is the multivariate generalization of the 
more familiar, for example, Pearson bivariate correlation. Canonical correlation identifies

 the weighted average of ROIs in one distribution that is maximally correlated with another 
weighted average of ROIs in another distribution. The weighting vectors, or canonical 
vectors, define topographies.

 Fig. 2. PET tau and Aβ topographies are associated with disease severity
(A) Right singular vectors (V) of the SVD of the regional PET tau and Aβ data represented 
as topographies. The dimensionality of both tau and Aβ was estimated to be two. The first 
topography for both PET species broadly represents the mean (that is, all regions are 
homogeneously weighted). The second tau topography is present within the temporal lobe, 
and the second Aβ topography is largely seen in frontal and parietal lobes. Color bar 
represents regional weights within each singular component. (B) The representations of 
these topographies in individuals (left singular vectors, U) (that is, the original data 
projected onto these topographies) varied with CDR for both PET tau topographies and the 
second PET Aβ topography. Increasing disease severity (measured using the CDR) is 
associated with increasing representation of the present topographies in individuals. 
However, particularly in the Aβ data, there was significant heterogeneity. (C) Similar graphs 
as (B), but only participants with CSF analysis were included. Color in the CDR0 group 
indicates preclinical disease status: blue corresponds to healthy aging (that is, no Aβ or tau 
pathology), green corresponds to stage 1, and red corresponds to stage 2 of the CDR.

 Fig. 3. Tau and Aβ in distinct topographies are strongly correlated
(A) Topographies for PET tau and PET Aβ imaging derived from canonical correlations that 
maximize the correlation between PET tau and Aβ deposition. (B) Scatter plot of the 
weights on each region demonstrates that PET tau and Aβ topographies are not significantly 
related. This is consistent with the typical topographies of tau and Aβ pathology being 
distinct. (C) The data projected onto the canonical variables revealed a robust positive 
relationship.

 Fig. 4. CSF and neuropsychological performance are predicted by tau and Aβ topographies
Each row represents a single penalized regression model where either CSF protein or 
neuropsychological performance is predicted. Σ|βtau| and Σ|βAb| represent the total predictive 
weight of tau and Aβ topographies, respectively. Gray regions have no predictive weight. 
(A) Penalized regression models that predict CSF tau and Aβ42 using tau and Aβ 
topographies. Because CSF Aβ42 is inversely related to amyloid burden, negative weights 
indicate regions where topographies predict worse CSF Aβ42 pathology. (B) Penalized 
regression models that predict neuropsychological performance in each examined domain: 
global, episodic, semantic, and visuospatial (visuospat). Regions with negative values 
(displayed in cool colors) are where more PET pathology predicts lower cognitive 
performance.
