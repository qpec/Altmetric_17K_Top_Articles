Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus belonging to the genus Flavivirus 
(family Flaviviridae) and was first described in 1947 in Uganda 
following blood analyses of sentinel rhesus monkeys1. Until the 
twentieth century, the African and Asian lineages of the virus did not 
cause meaningful infections in humans. However, in 2007, vectored 
by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, ZIKV caused the first noteworthy 
epidemic on Yap Island in Micronesia2. Patients experienced fever, 
skin rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis2. From 2013 to 2015, the 
Asian lineage of the virus caused further massive outbreaks in New 
Caledonia and French Polynesia. In 2013, ZIKV reached Brazil, 
later spreading to other countries in South and Central America3. 
In Brazil, the virus has been linked to congenital malformations, 
including microcephaly and other severe neurological diseases, such 
as Guillain–Barré syndrome4,5. Despite clinical evidence, direct 
experimental evidence showing that the Brazilian ZIKV (ZIKVBR) 
strain causes birth defects remains absent6. Here we demonstrate 
that ZIKVBR infects fetuses, causing intrauterine growth restriction, 
including signs of microcephaly, in mice. Moreover, the virus infects 
human cortical progenitor cells in vitro, leading to an increase in cell 
death. We also report that the infection of human brain organoids 
results in a reduction of proliferative zones and disrupted cortical 
layers. These results indicate that ZIKVBR crosses the placenta 
and causes microcephaly by targeting cortical progenitor cells, 
inducing cell death by apoptosis and autophagy, and impairing 
neurodevelopment. Our data reinforce the growing body of 
evidence linking the ZIKVBR outbreak to the alarming number of 
cases of congenital brain malformations. Our model can be used to 
determine the efficiency of therapeutic approaches to counteracting 
the harmful impact of ZIKVBR in human neurodevelopment.
The recent increase in microcephaly cases in Brazil has been asso-
ciated with the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV)7, originating from an 
Asian-lineage strain that can be spread by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes8. 
The Brazilian ZIKV (ZIKVBR) has been detected in the placenta and 
amniotic fluid of two women with microcephalic fetuses9–11 and in 
the blood of microcephalic newborns10,12, suggesting that the virus 
can cross the placental membrane. The virus has also been identified 
in the brains and retinas of microcephalic fetuses11–13. However, there 
is no direct evidence of the mechanism by which ZIKVBR might cause 
brain malformations. A previous study revealed that the African ZIKV 
(ZIKV
AF, strain MR-766) has the ability to infect human skin cells14. 
Neurons and astrocytes in the mouse brain could also be infected, 
inducing hippocampal degeneration and necrosis of pyriform cells 
7 days post-infection15. More recently, ZIKV
AF was also shown to infect 
human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells 
(NPCs) in vitro, which induced apoptotic cell death16. These studies 
were performed using the MR-766 ZIKV
AF strain isolated in Uganda in 
1947, which shares 87–90% sequence similarity with the Polynesian and 
Brazilian isolates3,17. Nevertheless, because severe congenital malforma-
tions were not reported for African isolates, there is a need to study the 
association of ZIKV with microcephaly and birth defects with isolates 
from affected localities, such as the ZIKVBR strain. Therefore, there is 
an urgent need to develop model systems to determine the relationship 
between infection with the ZIKVBR strain and birth defects.
We used ZIKVBR isolated from a febrile case in the state of Paraiba, 
in the northeast of Brazil in 2015 (see Methods). To evaluate the 
causal relationship between ZIKVBR and birth defects, including brain 
 
malformation during development, we first used a murine experimental 
model in which SJL and C57BL/6 pregnant mice were infected with 
ZIKVBR, evaluating newborns immediately after birth (Extended Data 
Fig. 1a). Notably, similar to ZIKVBR-infected human newborns18,19, 
pups born from the SJL ZIKVBR-infected pregnant females displayed 
clear evidence of whole-body growth delay or intrauterine growth 
restriction (IUGR)20 compared to pups born from the mock-infected 
controls (Fig. 1a, b). Using a qPCR assay, we confirmed the presence of 
ZIKVBR genomic RNA in several tissues of newborn animals, observing 
significantly more viral RNA in the brain, confirming the neurotropic 
nature of the virus (Fig. 1c).
Microcephaly is perhaps the most striking of the birth defects 
reported in ZIKVBR-infected newborns4,18,19. Mouse models often fail 
to reproduce the severely reduced brain size and pathological alter-
ations found in human patients21,22, probably owing to differences 
in gestation time and brain development between the two species. 
Nevertheless, upon close inspection of the ZIKVBR-infected mouse 
brains, we noticed cortical malformations in the surviving animals, 
with reduced cell number and cortical layer thickness, signs associ-
ated with microcephaly in humans (Fig. 1d–f). At a cellular level, the 
neurons in the cortex, thalamus and hypothalamus displayed a ‘vacu-
olar nuclei’ appearance. This morphology was characterized by central 
emptiness and marginalized chromatin pattern with nuclear debris, 
suggesting ongoing cellular death (Fig. 1 d and Extended Data Fig. 2). 
In addition, we also noticed apparent ocular abnormalities, reminis-
cent of that observed in human patients23 (Fig. 1g). Thus, SJL infected 
pups presented congenital malformations with similarities to those 
in ZIKVBR-infected human newborns. While the impact of ZIKVBR

infection in the SJL mice was notable, no major body alterations were 
detected in pups from the infected C57BL/6 animals (Extended Data 
Fig. 1a–c). To exclude potential minor alterations in the C57BL/6 
mice, computed tomography (CT) scans were performed to quantify 
the skull/body volumes. No significant changes in the pups born from 
the ZIKVBR-infected C57BL/6 mothers were observed compared to 
the controls (Extended Data Fig. 1d, e). A diagnostic qPCR assay of 
the pups from the ZIKVBR-infected animals was negative, suggesting 
that the virus did not cross the placenta in the C57BL/6 mouse strain 
(Extended Data Fig. 1f). To elucidate the type of cell death induced by 
ZIKVBR in the brains of SJL pups, we used a qPCR array to distinguish 
different molecular pathways involved. Our data indicate that ZIKVBR 
infection influences the regulation of genes intimately linked to auto-
phagy and apoptosis, such as upregulation of Bmf, Irgm1, Bcl2, Htt, 
Casp6 and Abl1. Conversely, Gadd45a, Tnfrsf11b, Fasl, Atg12, Bcl2l11 
and Dffa were highly suppressed (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1g, h).
Next, we evaluated the impact of ZIKVBR infection in human neural 
cells derived from hPSCs to establish a correlation between ZIKV and 
impairment of neurogenesis (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We generated 
human cortical NPCs and neurons from healthy donor hPSCs. First, 
we determined the expression levels of the TYRO3, AXL and MERTK 
(TAM) receptors tyrosine kinases in NPCs and neurons. This is an 
important family of receptors used for cell invasion by the Dengue 
virus and ZIKV, and AXL has been recently proposed as a candidate 
receptor for ZIKV infection during neurogenesis14,24. Mock-infected 
NPCs expressed higher levels of AXL when compared to mock-infected 
neurons (Fig. 2a). However, no significant changes in expression lev-
els were observed upon ZIKV infection in NPCs (Fig. 2b). We then 
investigated the impact of ZIKVBR and ZIKV
AF infection in NPCs and 
neurons. After infection using a viral multiplicity of infection (MOI) 
of 10, ZIKVBR particles were detected inside the NPCs and neurons at 
several stages of viral assembly using transmission electron microscopy 
(Fig. 2c). Immunostaining performed on NPCs and neurons at both 
an MOI of 10 and an MOI of 1 revealed production of viral protein 
aggregates (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3b, c). With an MOI of 10, 
 
the amount of ZIKVBR particles in the NPC and neuron culture super-
natant increased over time, suggesting the efficient production of 
infectious viral particles (Fig. 2e, f). With an MOI of 1, NPCs, but not 
neurons, continued to produce ZIKVBR RNA in the culture superna-
tant (Extended Data Fig. 3d, e). After 96 h post-infection, we observed 
significant cell death in NPC cultures using fluorescence-activated cell 
(FAC) analyses. We quantified cell death over time in NPC cultures 
and detected an increase in the number of apoptotic/necrotic cells 
both in the ZIKVBR- and ZIKV
AF-treated cultures compared to the

mock-infected cultures at an MOI of 10 (Fig. 2g), but not at an MOI of 1 
 
during the same time frame (Extended Data Fig. 3f). No difference in 
neuronal cell death was observed between the two ZIKV strains at an 
MOI of 10 and an MOI of 1 (Extended Data Fig. 3g, h).
Next, we challenged two three-dimensional neural cell culture sys-
tems, neurospheres and cerebral organoids, with ZIKVBR and ZIKV
AF. 
We generated neurospheres by growing human NPCs in suspension. 
While the mock-infected control neurospheres continued to grow over 
time, the ZIKVBR-infected neurospheres (MOI of 10) displayed evident 
morphological abnormalities with signs of cell death (Fig. 2h). The sizes 
of the neurospheres infected with ZIKVBR were significantly smaller 
than the mock-control and ZIKV
AF-infected at 96 h post-infection 
(Fig. 2i). A less dramatic effect is observed at an MOI of 1, where both 
ZIKVBR and ZIKV
AF infection reduced the size of the neurospheres 
compared to mock-infected controls (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). These 
observations were paired with increased ZIKVBR replication in these 
cultures at both MOIs of 10 and 1 (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 4c). 
These results suggest that ZIKVBR induces cell death in human NPCs, 
impairing the growth and morphogenesis of healthy neurospheres 
(Extended Data Fig. 4d–f).
The majority of the described cases of ZIKVBR-infected new-
borns (95%) had malformations of cortical development4. 
Thus, we also used brain organoids generated from hPSCs and 
human embryonic stem cells, to evaluate the impact of ZIKVBR 
on human cortical development. In the following experiments, 
alongside the ZIKV
AF and mock infection, we added the Yellow 
Fever virus (YFV), a slow replicating attenuated live-vaccine 
Flavivirus that has a low risk of causing neuropathy. Cerebral orga-
noids are three-dimensional, self-organized, stem-cell-derived 
 
models that recapitulate the first trimester of human neurodevelop-
ment, including the molecular and cellular architecture reminiscent 
of the fetal cortex25. Organoids show some degree of lamination and 
resembled the human neocortex in terms of the spatial relationships of 
the progenitor populations, defined here as a proliferative ventricular 
zone, post-migratory neurons in cortical plate and a marginal zone 
 
(Fig. 3a–c). We infected organoids with ZIKVBR, ZIKV
AF and YFV

using an MOI of 0.1 and compared to mock-infected organoids at 
 
24 and 96 h post-infection. We quantified the percentage of different 
subtypes of cortical neurons, TBR1-positive or CTIP2-positive cells 
(deep-layer V/VI) in the cortical plate, finding a significant reduc-
tion in their number and respective cortical plate thickness in the 
 
ZIKVBR-infected organoids compared to the others. A significant 
reduction in TBR1-positive cells was observed in the ZIKVBR-infected 
organoids at 96 h post-infection, while CTIP2-positive cells were signif-
icantly reduced in both ZIKVBR- and ZIKV
AF-infected organoids at the 
same time point (Fig. 3d, e and Extended Data Fig. 5a–f). Consistent 
with the reduced population of cortical neurons, we observed a sig-
nificant decrease in PAX6-positive cells (dorsal forebrain progenitor 
cells) following ZIKV infection (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 5d). 
Dividing cells in the ventricular zone, detected by the population of 
Ki67- and SOX2-positive cells, were only significantly reduced in the 
ZIKVBR-infected organoids (Fig. 3g, h and Extended Data Fig. 5d). As 
observed in our other in vitro models, the number of apoptotic cells 
(cleaved caspase 3- and TUNEL-positive cells) was increased in orga-
noids infected with ZIKVBR, possibly explaining the decrease in the 
NPC population (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 5g, h).
ZIKVAF was derived from a zoonotic agent associated with 
 
primates in Africa, whereas ZIKVBR is an isolate from a lineage adapted 
to human-to-human transmission for the past 70 years. As an entry 
point to establishing the potential mechanistic adaptive differences 
between ZIKVBR and ZIKV
AF towards human cells, we also generated 
brain organoids from non-human primate (chimpanzee) pluripotent 
stem cells. We infected these chimpanzee’s cerebral organoids (MOI 
of 0.1) and measured the impact on cortical neurons at 24 and 96 h 
 
post-infection. ZIKVBR failed to reduce the percentage of either TBR1- 
or CTIP2-positive cells in non-human primates (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 5i, j). Consistently, the kinetics of infection were different between 
the two ZIKV isolates. While ZIKVBR did not replicate in the chimpanzee 
 
organoids, ZIKV
AF seemed well adapted to these cells (Extended Data 
Fig. 5k).
To evaluate the causal relationship between ZIKV congenital infection 
 
and birth defects, we used a murine experimental model, in which 
pregnant SJL and C57BL/6 mice were infected with ZIKVBR. Notably, 
the SJL strain was susceptible to viral infection of fetal tissues, causing 
severe IUGR that resembled the affected Brazilian newborns, including 
 
signs of microcephaly, such as cortical malformations4. We also showed 
that ZIKVBR induced apoptosis and autophagy in the mouse neural 
tissue. This is in accordance with the literature, as it has been previ-
ously demonstrated that ZIKV induces and localizes in autophagic 
phagosomes14. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing a 
gene expression profile that correlates to cell death in the brains of 
microcephalic newborn ZIKVBR-infected mice, corroborating a causal 
relationship. It is unclear why the virus could not cross the placenta 
of C57BL/6 mice, but this result may be due to the robust anti-viral

immune response of this mouse strain, which secretes significant 
levels of type I/II interferon, known to confer resistance to ZIKV14,26. 
These data suggest that genetic differences could explain in part why 
some ZIKV-infected pregnant women give birth to newborns without 
detectable congenital brain malformations27. Nonetheless, our murine 
model is a valuable tool for future pre-clinical studies, such as vaccine 
development. The presence of major cortical histological abnormal-
ities in the pups with IUGR prompted us to use an hPSC model to 
study the impact of ZIKV on neurodevelopment. ZIKV infects cells 
at different stages of brain maturation leading to alterations in the 
cortical layer organization. While this manuscript was under review, 
two other papers revealed the impact of previously established ZIKV 
strains on human organoids, confirming our observations with ZIKVBR 
 
(refs 28, 29). Finally, our data using a non-human primate organoids 
suggested that the ZIKVBR might have experienced adaptive changes in 
human cells. It has been demonstrated that the Asian lineage of ZIKV is 
undergoing codon usage adaptation towards biases observed in highly 
expressed human genes30. Our findings support the hypothesis that 
microcephaly is a distinctive feature of recent ZIKV Asian-lineage 
virus, which originated in the Pacific and is now spreading in South 
and Central America.

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments 
were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during 
experiments and outcome assessment
Viral culture and amplification. A lyophilized ZIKV isolate from a clinical case 
in Brazil (ZIKVBR), provided by the Evandro Chagas Institute in Belém, Pará, 
was reconstituted in 0.5 ml of sterile DEPC water. The African-lineage MR-766 
(ZIKV
AF), a reference strain isolated in Uganda in 1947 and the Yellow Fever 
 
vaccine strain (YFV-17D)31, both used here as controls, were provided by the 
Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal. Aedes albopictus mosquito cells (C6/36 cells) 
were previously prepared to culture the three viruses. C6/36 cell culture was 
maintained using Leibovitz’s L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine 
serum (FBS) (Gibco), 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 1% sodium pyruvate 
(Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), 0.05% of amphotericin B (Gibco) 
and kept at 27 °C in the absence of CO2. After reaching an approximately 70% 
confluent monolayer, 50 μl of each viral sample was inoculated into C6/36 with an 
hour of adsorption, with gentle shaking every 10 min to allow the homogeneous 
adsorption of the viruses. At the end of the adsorption period, 5 ml of the culture 
media was added, plus 2% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% sodium 
pyruvate. The cultures were then incubated under the same adsorption conditions. 
In the first subculture (T1), the infected cells were less confluent compared to the 
control cells but had few noticeable morphological changes. On the fourth day 
after infection, the second subculture (T2) was made blindly by transferring 500 μl 
of the T1 supernatant, followed by the third subculture, which was collected on 
the eighth day after infection (T3). Pronounced cytopathic effects were perceived 
beginning at T2. The supernatants were harvested, titrated and T3 was used for 
the experimental inoculation.
Virus titration. Titration (in PFU ml−1) of each C6/36 subculture was obtained by 
plaque assay to determine the amount of infectious viral particles (PFU). The virus 
titration was performed in porcine kidney epithelial (PS) cells and in L15 medium 
with 5% FBS. Briefly, the virus titration was done using 200 μl of L15 medium 
 
(5% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamine) in a 24-well plate. Then, 
a serial dilution of each virus stock from ZIKVBR, ZIKV
AF and YFV-17D in L15 
medium was performed, from 10−1 to 10−11.Then, 200 μl of each dilution was 
added in each 24-well plate. After this, 1 × 106 PS cells were seeded in each well of 
a 24-well plate for at least 3 h at 37 °C to allow virus adsorption and PS cell adher-
ence. Later, each well was overlaid with complete carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) 
medium (0.6% in L15 supplemented with 3% FBS). After 5 days of incubation 
at 37 °C, the plaque visualization was made using blue-black staining solution. 
The most appropriate viral dilution was estimated to determine the amount of 
infected cells visible (PFU ml−1). For ZIKVBR, the first C6/36 subculture had a titre 
of 6 × 108. The following subcultures had titres of 7.5 × 106 (T2) and 4 × 1012 (T3). 
 
All the subculture aliquots were stored in cryovials and maintained in liquid nitrogen 
 
or were distributed to the ZIKV São Paulo task force.
In vivo infection. Pregnant mice, 6–8 weeks of age, C57BL/6 or SJL (JAX), were 
infected intravenously with 200 μl of ZIKVBR-infected C6/36 cell supernatant 
containing 1 × 103, 4 × 1010 or 1 × 1012 PFU m−1 of virus on day 10–13 of gesta-
tion. The animals were observed daily. All the experiments were performed with 
the approval of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences Ethics Committee protocol 
number 05/2016.
Real-time PCR. RNA was extracted from each sample (cells, supernatant of cell 
culture or mouse tissue) using the QIAamp UltraSens Virus Kit (Qiagen) or TRIzol 
reagent (Invitrogen). All RNA pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of RNase-free 
distilled water, quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 
Technologies) and stored at −80 °C. The set of primers/probes specific for ZIKV 
were synthesized by Sigma Life Science, with 5- FAM as the reporter dye for the 
probe. The set of primers/probes ZIKV 835, ZIKV 911c and ZIKV 860-FAM 
were previously described2. The real-time reaction was performed with 10 μl of 
each sample and 10 μl of the AgPath-IDTM One-Step RT–PCR reagents (Applied 
Biosystems). The amplification was done in an Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time 
PCR system, and involved activation at 45 °C for 15 min, 95 °C for 15 min followed 
by 40 amplification cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The 
real-time data were analysed using SDS software from Applied Biosystems. For the 
detection and quantification of viral RNA, the real-time PCR of each sample was 
compared with threshold cycle (Ct) value with a ZIKV plasmid standard curve, 
which was obtained carrying out serial dilutions of a clone of the envelope gene of 
an isolate from the 2007 Yap Island outbreak (provided by the Institute Pasteur in 
Dakar, Senegal). For the detection and quantification of YFV RNA, a YFV-specific 
real-time assay was applied. The fold changes of gene expression were calculated in 
comparison to the values for the YFV controls31. The positive PCR control Ct value 
was used to normalize gene expression and determine fold changes during the 
96 hours post-infection. The RPLA27 gene (60S ribosomal protein L27) was used 
as endogenous control for the PCR reactions30. For the TAM receptors detection, 
 
NPCs or neurons from two donors were or were not infected with ZIKVBR, at 
 
10 MOI for 48 h and were submitted to standard TRIzol (Invitrogen) protocol for 
RNA extraction. Total RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer 
and 2 μg was used for further cDNA synthesis using the superscript III reverse- 
transcription polimerase (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. qPCR 
was performed using Taqman probes (Extended Data Table 1) and the QuantStudio 
12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). For normalization ACTB 
was used as a housekeeping gene.
Cell death pathway analysis. One microgram of total RNA from brains of 4 pups, 
2 pooled mock and 2 pooled ZIKVBR-infected from SJL mothers were submitted 
to gene expression analysis for cell death target genes using the RT2 Profiler PCR 
Array Mouse Cell Death PathwayFinder (cat. no. PAMM-212ZA- Qiagen) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s protocols. qPCR was performed in the QuantStudio 12K 
Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). To evaluate gene expression, 
we established a fold change threshold of at least twofold up- or downregulation 
compared to mock infected samples. Statistical analysis was performed using the 
RT2 profiler RT–PCR array data analysis software v3.5.
NPCs, neurons, neurospheres and organoids. We used three human and two 
chimpanzee iPSC clones that were previously characterized in the Beltrão-Braga 
and Muotri laboratories32–35 plus H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESC) for 
all the experiments using pluripotent stem cells. All the cell lines tested negative 
for mycoplasma contamination. Briefly, high passages of iPSC/hESC colonies 
on feeder-free plates were maintained for 5 days with mTSeR media (Stem Cell 
Technologies). On the fifth day, the medium was changed to N2 media (DMEM/
F12 medium supplemented with 1X N2 supplement (Invitrogen) and the dual 
SMAD inhibitors, 1 μM dorsomorphin (Tocris) and 1 μM SB431542 (Stemgent), 
for 48 h. Further, the colonies were detached from the plate and cultured in sus-
pension as embryoid bodies (EBs) for 5 days at 90 r.p.m. in N2 media with the 
dual SMAD inhibitors. The EBs were plated on matrigel-coated plates with NBF 
media composed of the following: DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 0.5X N2, 
0.5X B27 supplement (Gibco), 20 ng ml−1 of FGF2 and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. 
The emerged rosettes containing the NPCs were manually picked, dissociated and 
plated in a double-coated plate with poly-ornithine (10 μg ml−1, Sigma-Aldrich) 
and laminin (2.5 μg ml−1, Gibco). The NPC population was expanded using NBF 
media. The neuronal differentiation induction protocol consisted of treating the 
confluent NPC plate with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor for 48 h (Y-27632, Calbiochem) 
in the absence of FGF in the media, with regular media changes every 3 or 4 days. 
Neurons were considered completely differentiated and ready to experiments after 
28 days. To produce neurospheres, NPC were scrapped from the plates and sub-
mitted to continuous shaking for 5–7 days at 90 r.p.m. in NBF media. Cerebral 
organoids were generated as previously described25,36. All experiments were per-
formed with the approval of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences Ethics Committee 
protocol number 1001.
In vitro infection. NPCs, neurons, neurospheres and organoids were infected with 
ZIKVBR, ZIKV
AF, YFV and mock (culture supernatant from uninfected C6/36 
cells). NPCs were seeded in plates in 24-well plates and after 24 h viral samples were 
diluted to the desired MOI (0.1; 1 or 10) and added to the cells. For viral adsorption, 
cells in monolayer were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation every 10 min. 
 
Next, the inoculum was removed and cells were washed once with PBS (USB 
Corporation). Culture medium was added to each well, and cells were incubated 
at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for the duration of the experiment. For neurospheres, NPCs 
were kept in constant shaking. For neuronal infection, NPCs were previously dif-
ferentiated for 28 days and then neurons were infected with the desired MOI. For 
organoids, the number of cells available for infection was estimated to be 2.5 × 104 
cells, as calculated by dividing the average surface area of a typical organoid by the 
average area of a typical cell (that is, a fibroblast). This calculus was used to estipu-
late the desired 0.1 MOI. For mock controls, the same volume of supernatant was 
added to each experiment, and the same procedures were followed.
Immunofluorescence. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde, 4% in PBS, for 
15 min at room temperature. After washing, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% 
Triton X-100 (Promega) diluted in PBS for 15 min. After blocking with 2% of BSA 
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h, primary antibodies directed against the following were 
added: anti-ZIKV (polyclonal mouse, Institute Pasteur in Dakar, 1:80), anti-Flavivirus 
 
D1-4G2-4-15 (polyclonal mouse, Millipore, 1:100), 1:50, anti-MAP2 (chicken, 
Abcam ab5392, 1:200), anti-cleaved-caspase-3 (rabbit, Cell Signaling #9661, 1:400), 
anti-Sox2 (mouse, Abcam ab97959), anti-GFAP (rabbit, Abcam, 1:500) and anti-Mu-
shashi1 (rabbit, Abcam, 1:1000) (Extended Data Table 2). The cells were incubated 
overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies were added for a one-hour incubation at 
 
room temperature: anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488, anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 647, anti-rat 
 
Alexa Fluor 555 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen). The nuclei were 
stained with DAPI (Invitrogen, 1:10,000) diluted in a PBS 1× solution for 5 min 
and mounted with DPX (Sigma). Images were acquired with Nikon Eclipse 80i. 
Analysis of data was performed using software NIS Elements 3.22 (Tokyo, Japan).

Cerebral organoids analyses. Human and chimp organoids were infected with an 
MOI of 0.1 and analysed after 24 and 96 h post-infection. Organoids were cryo- 
sectioned at 20 μm. Immunofluorescence was performed after blocking sections in a 
 
solution with 0.1% Triton and 3% BSA (Gemini) for 1 h at room temperature. The 
primary antibodies were diluted in a solution with 0.1% Triton and 3% BSA, and 
the sections were incubated with following antibodies: anti-ZIKV, anti-Flavivirus, 
 
anti-MAP2, anti-cleaved-caspase-3 and anti-Sox2, all mentioned above, and anti-
PAX6 (rabbit, Covance PRB-278P, 1:100), anti-TBR1 (rabbit, Abcam ab31940, 
1:300), CTIP2 (rat, Abcam ab18465, 1:100) and Ki67 (rabbit, Abcam ab15580, 
1:100). The sections were blocked with 0.1% Triton (Sigma-Aldrich) and 3% BSA 
for 30 min at room temperature and the secondary antibodies previously diluted, 
the same mentioned above, were added. The nuclei were stained with DAPI, as 
mentioned above and slides were mounted with DPX (Sigma-Aldrich).
Transmission electron microscopy. Cell pellet was fixed using a 3% glutaralde-
hyde solution (Merck) at 4 °C for 2 h, rinsed in three changes of PBS for 1 h, and 
incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The next day, post-fixation was performed with 1% of 
osmium tetroxide for 30 min at room temperature. Dehydration was carried out 
gradually with a series of ethanol concentrations: 70%, 95% and 100%. Sample was 
taken through two changes of propylene oxide and placed at a 1:1 ratio with embed-
ding medium for 1 h in a rotary mixer followed by 100% embedding medium at 
room temperature for 24 h. Fresh embedding medium was placed overnight at 
37 °C and polymerized in oven to 24 h. Ultrathin sections were cut and stained 
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The cells were visualized with a transmission 
electron microscope (JEOL, JEM 1011, Peabody, Massachusetts, USA). All exper-
imental analyses were performed blinded to the treatment.
Flow cytometry. Cells were infected with an MOI of 10 or 1, prepared using 
supernatants from infected C6/36, and equal volume of mock. Cellular infection 
occurred at 4 °C for 1 h with cell homogenization every 10 min. After that, the cells 
were washed once and then maintained at 37 °C in CO2 incubators with medium, 
as described before. After 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-infection the cells were harvested 
and then submitted to a staining protocol for annexin V and propidium iodide 
(PI) (BD Biosciences). The cells were washed twice with PBS and were harvested 
with 200 μl of trypsin 0.25% (LGC) for 10 min at 37 °C. Next, the cell suspensions 
were washed in DMEM with 10% of FBS and centrifuged for 5 min at 450g and 
4 °C. The cells were then resuspended in 20 μl of annexin V binding buffer in 
96-well round-bottom plates and with 1 μl of FITC–annexin V + 1 μl of PI and then 
incubated at room temperature for 15 min protected from light. After incubation 
period, the samples were added to 80 μl of binding buffer and acquired in the BD 
FACS Accuri C6 (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer.
Computed tomography. Mice were properly anaesthetized with isoflurane and 
immobilized on their right side on the bed with a piece of gauze and positioned 
with the whole body in the field of view (FOV). CT images were acquired using 
small animal imaging equipment (Triumph Trimodality Gamma Medica Ideas) 
with 45 kVp, 0.4 mA and 2.13 min of X-ray exposition (512 projections over 360°). 
The images were reconstructed using the FBP (filtered back projection) algorithm, 
a matrix of 512 × 512, smoothing filter and a pixel size of 92–117 μm (according to 
the animal size). Experienced evaluators, who were blinded to the animal group 
assignments, performed images analyses using the AMIDE 1.0.4, General Public 
License software. Fiducial marks were added to measure the distance between 
points considering, visually, the larger axis of the brain in the sagittal plane for pos-
terior–anterior and superior–inferior distances and the coronal plane for the lateral 
right–left. For measuring whole-body length, the distance between the superior 
point of the brain to the first vertebra of the tail was used. The thorax measure was 
made from the third rib (right–left) in the coronal plane to the spinal cord level. 
The results are presented in mm.
Histologic processing. Tissue histology was performed using a dehydrating pro-
tocol with two alcohol baths of 95% (the first for 1 h and 15 min and the second 
for 30 min), three absolute alcohol baths (1 h for the first followed by 3 h for the 
second and 2 h for the third), followed by clarification with three baths of xylene 
(the first for 30 min and the next two for 1 h each). Finally, the material was added 
to three paraffin baths (the first for 30 min and the second two for 1 h each). Then 
the material was immersed in paraffin and cut with a microtome to a thickness of 
5 mm. The deparaffinization protocol consisted of three xylol baths heated in an 
oven for 30 min each, two baths of absolute alcohol for 2 min each, two baths of 95% 
alcohol lasting 2 min each, an alcohol in water bath (85%) for 2 min and the last 
bath in 70% alcohol for 2 min. The haematoxylin and eosin staining protocol began 
with two quick baths in running water, followed by a 2-min bath in distilled water, 
a 2-min bath in haematoxylin, a 5-min bath in running water, a 1-min bath in 
eosin, followed by 1-min in a fast-flowing water bath, two baths of 95% ethanol for 
2 min each, two baths of absolute ethanol for 2 min each, ending with three baths in 
xylene for 2 min each. Slides were mounted using Permount (Sigma-Aldrich) and 
analysed on multiple coronal slices in glass slides using light microscopy (Olympus 
BX40, ZEISS KS400) on a genotype-blinded fashion.
