ABSTRACT
Recently LHCb discovered the first doubly-charmed baryon Ξ++
cc
= ccu at
3621.40 ± 0.78 MeV, very close to our theoretical prediction.
We use the
same methods to predict a doubly-bottom tetraquark T(bb¯
u ¯
d) with JP=1+
at 10, 389 ± 12 MeV, 215 MeV below the B− ¯
B∗0 threshold and 170 MeV below
threshold for decay to B− ¯
B0γ. The T(bb¯
u ¯
d) is therefore stable under strong
and electromagnetic (EM) interactions and can only decay weakly, the first ex-
otic hadron with such a property. On the other hand, the mass of T(cc¯
u ¯
d) with
JP=1+ is predicted to be 3882 ± 12 MeV, 7 MeV above the D0D∗+ threshold
and 148 MeV above D0D+γ threshold. T(bc¯
u ¯
d) with JP=0+ is predicted at
7134 ± 13 MeV, 11 MeV below the ¯
B0D0 threshold. Our precision is not suf-
ficient to determine whether bc¯
u ¯
d is actually above or below the threshold. It
could manifest itself as a narrow resonance just at threshold.

INTRODUCTION
The question whether QQ¯
q¯
q tetraquarks with two heavy quarks Q and two light antiquarks
¯
q are stable or unstable against decay into two Q¯
q mesons has a long history. It has been
largely undecided, mainly due to lack of experimental information about the strength of
the interaction between two heavy quarks.

 The very recent discovery of the doubly charmed baryon Ξcc by the LHCb Collaboration
at CERN has now provided the crucial experimental input which allows this issue to be
finally resolved.
LHCb has observed the doubly-charmed baryon Ξ++
cc
= ccu with a mass of 3621.40 ±
0.78 MeV [1].
This value is consistent with several predictions, including our value of
3627 ± 12 MeV [2,3].
Here we use similar methods to those in Ref. [2] and earlier works [4] to predict the mass
of the ground-state bb¯
u ¯
d tetraquark with spin-parity JP = 1+, M(T(bb¯
u ¯
d)) = 10, 389 ± 12
MeV.
Angular momentum and parity conservation in strong and EM interactions forbid a
state with JP = 1+ from decaying strongly or electromagnetically into two pseudoscalars
in any partial wave. Therefore bb¯
u ¯
d with JP = 1+ cannot decay into BB. The lowest-
mass hadronic channel allowed by angular momentum and parity is BB∗, most favorably
in S-wave. This channel is however kinematically closed, because the T(bb¯
u ¯
d) mass is 215
MeV below BB∗ threshold at 10,604 MeV. M(T(bb¯
u ¯
d)) is also 170 MeV below 2mB, the
relevant threshold for EM decay to B− ¯
B0γ.
The B mesons are the lightest states that carry open bottom, so the bb¯
u ¯
d tetraquark
cannot decay through strong or EM interactions which conserve heavy flavor. It can only
decay weakly, when one of the b quarks decays into and c quark and a virtual W +. A
typical decay is therefore (bb¯
u ¯
d) → ¯
BDπ+(ρ+), etc.
The main challenge in the prediction of the T(bb¯
u ¯
d) mass is the estimate of binding
energy between the two b quarks [5–7]. Table IX of Ref. [7] provides a compilation of earlier
mass estimates of various QQ¯
q¯
q tetraquarks. In Ref. [2] we estimated the binding energy
between two heavy quarks Q by assuming that QQ binding is one-half of the ¯
QQ binding
which can be obtained from quarkonia. When applied to the ccu baryon Ξcc this led to the
prediction M(Ξcc) = 3627 ± 12 MeV, very close to the experimentally measured ccu mass
of 3621.40 ± 0.78 MeV.
The above relation between quark-quark and quark-antiquark binding is exact in the
one-gluon-exchange weak-coupling limit. Its successful extension beyond weak coupling im-
plies that the heavy quark potential factorizes into a color-dependent and a space-dependent
part, with the space-dependent part being the same for QQ and ¯
QQ. The relative factor
1/2 is then automatic, just as in the weak coupling limit, resulting from the color algebra.
II
CALCULATION OF THE bb¯
u ¯
d MASS
In the present work we build on the accuracy of the Ξcc mass prediction and assume the
same relation is true for bb binding energy in a bb¯
u ¯
d tetraquark. In order to obtain a state
with the lowest possible mass, we further assume that all four quarks are in a relative
S-wave and that the ¯
u and ¯
d light antiquarks bind into a color-triplet “good” antidiquark
with spin and isospin zero. The bb diquark must then be a color antitriplet and Fermi
statistics dictates it has spin 1. The total spin and parity are then JP = 1+.
The upshot is that we are considering a configuration very similar to a heavy-light
meson ¯
Qq, where instead of the heavy antiquark we have a doubly-heavy color antitriplet
diquark and instead of the quark we have a light color triplet antidiquark. The rest of the
calculation is straightforward and proceeds in a way entirely analogous to Ref. [2].

quarks and JP = 1+ are listed in Table I. The notation and the numerical values of all the
parameters are the same as in Table VI and Table IX of Ref. [2]. In particular, the subscripts
on masses m denote flavor, while the superscripts b indicate that these are effective masses
in baryons.
The central value of the resulting mass 10,389 MeV±12 is 215 MeV below BB∗ thresh-
old at 10,604 MeV, and 170 MeV below B− ¯
B0γ threshold at 10,559 MeV.

cc¯
u ¯
d and bc¯
u ¯
d MASSES
The calculation of the masses of the lightest cc¯
u ¯
d and tetraquark masses proceeds analo-
gously to bb¯
u ¯
d. In Tables II and III we provide the corresponding contributions to the cc¯
u ¯
d
and bc¯
u ¯
d masses.
The mass of cc¯
u ¯
d turns out to be 3882 ± 12 MeV, with the central value only 7 MeV
above the D0D∗+ threshold at 3875 MeV and 148 MeV above D0D+γ threshold. Moreover,
as the central value of our prediction of M(Ξ++
cc ) is 6 MeV above the observed central value,
if we were to increase the cc binding energy by 6 MeV to force agreement between prediction
and observation, the mass cc¯
u ¯
d would be lowered to 3876 MeV, only 1 MeV above D0D∗+
threshold. As M(D0)+M(D∗+) = 3875.09±0.07 MeV while M(D+)+M(D∗0) is 1.35±0.12
MeV higher at 3876.44 ± 0.10 MeV [8], there may be some interesting violations of isospin
in the hadronic decays of such a state, in analogy with isospin violations in decays of
X(3872) [9].
Unlike bb¯
u ¯
d and cc¯
u ¯
d, the lowest mass bc¯
u ¯
d tetraquark has JP = 0+, because the
minimal energy bc diquark has spin zero. The bc¯
u ¯
d mass is 7133.7 ± 13 MeV, with the
central value about 11 MeV below the ¯
B0D0 threshold at 7144.5 MeV.
The precision of our calculation is not sufficient to determine whether the bc¯
u ¯
d tetraquark
is actually above or below the corresponding two-meson threshold. It could manifest itself
as a narrow resonance just at threshold.

tetraquarks and the corresponding thresholds, D0D+γ, ¯
B0D0, and ¯
B0B−γ, respectively,
plotted against the reduced mass of the doubly-heavy diquark.
The main reason bb¯
u ¯
d is deeply bound, while cc¯
u ¯
d is above threshold and bc¯
u ¯
d is bor-
derline below threshold, is the big jump in the QQ binding energy as the heavy quarks’
mass increases: 129 MeV for cc vs. 281 MeV for bb. This increase in the binding energy
can be understood qualitatively by noting that the two heavy quarks are non-relativistic
and their interaction can be described by a Coulomb + linear potential, or by a logarithmic
potential, both of which are singular at the origin. The mean distance between the two
heavy quarks scales like 1/(αsmQ) and is significantly smaller than the typical hadronic
scale ∼ 1/ΛQCD. At such small distances as mQ increases, the QQ binding energy grows
rapidly with shrinking distance, due to the singularity of the potential.
While the above provides a qualitative understanding of the phenomenon, we stress
again that the actual numerical value of the QQ binding energy employed here is not
computed from any particular potential, but rather taken directly from experiment, using
the previously-discussed correspondence between binding in ¯
QQ quarkonia and in QQ
diquarks which led to the accurate prediction of the Ξcc mass.

We focus on the decay of the bb¯
u ¯
d tetraquark which is deeply bound, unlike cc¯
u ¯
d and bc¯
u ¯
d
which are, respectively, above and close to their relevant thresholds.
A crude estimate of the lifetime can be obtained similarly to Ref. [2]. We assume an
initial state with mass 10,389.4 MeV, a final state with M( ¯
B) + M(D) = 7, 144.5 MeV, a
charged weak current giving rise to e¯
νe, µ¯
νµ, τ ¯
ντ and three colors of ¯
ud and ¯
cs, a kinematic
suppression factor
F(x) = 1 − 8x + 8x3 − x4 + 12x2 ln(1/x) ,
x ≡ {[M( ¯
B) + M(D)]/M(bb¯
u ¯

(1)
a value of |Vcb| = 0.04 as in Ref. [2], and a factor of 2 to count each decaying b quark. The
resulting decay rate is

192π3
F(x)|Vcb|2 = 17.9 × 10−13 GeV ,
(2)
leading to a predicted lifetime τ(bb¯
u ¯
d) = 367 fs.
The bb¯
u ¯
d decay can occur through one of two channels:
5
 (a) The “standard process” bb¯
u ¯
d → cb¯
u ¯
d + W ∗−.
Typical reactions include
T(bb¯
u ¯
d) → D0 ¯
B0π−, D+B−π− and T(bb¯
u ¯
d) → J/ψK− ¯
B0, J/ψ ¯
K0B−.
In addition, there is a rare process where both b quarks decay into c¯
cs,
T(bb¯
u ¯
d) → J/ψJ/ψK− ¯
K0. The signature for events with two J/ψ’s coming from the same
secondary vertex might be sufficiently striking to make it worthwhile to look for such events
against a large background.
(b) The W-exchange process b ¯
d → c¯
u, again involving either one of the two b quarks, which
ought to shorten the lifetime further. The latter process can involve a two-body final state,
e.g., T(bb¯
u ¯
d) → D0B−, which may partially compensate for suppression due to the small
wave function of the b ¯
d pair at zero separation. However, the comparable process in B0
meson decay does not seem to shorten its lifetime much with respect to τ(B+).
V
PRODUCTION
Production will be difficult because in addition to two b quarks one will need two ¯
b an-
tiquarks. The probability for producing two heavy quark pairs can be estimated as the
square of the probability for producing one pair. In the case of the doubly-charmed baryon
Ξ++
cc
observed by LHCb [1], this difficulty appears to have been overcome.
The signature for decay of a bb¯
u ¯
d state will be a final state involving b and c, whereas
a b¯
b state will give rise to a b and ¯
c. The mixing transition D0 ↔ ¯
D0 in the latter process
will induce a small background contribution to the former process in final states containing
a neutral D. Similarly, final states containing a B0 will not be easily distinguishable from
those containing a ¯
B0 because of the mixing transition B0 ↔ ¯
B0.
Lipkin [10] has made the interesting point that in the limit of very heavy Q, the QQ¯
u ¯
d
color structure is that of an antibaryon. On a related note, one can compare QQ¯
u ¯
d pro-
duction with QQq production achieved by LHCb in the discovery of Ξ++
cc
[1]. We assume
that the relative fragmentation of the heavy QQ diquark into a light quark and into a light
(¯
u ¯
d)I=0,S=0 diquark is analogous to the relative fragmentation of a heavy antiquark (say,
¯
b) into u and into (¯
u ¯
d)I=0,S=0. These latter fragmentation fractions have been measured
for b quarks produced at √s = 1.96 TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron [11], with the results
shown in Table IV. These imply central values fu = 0.356, fd = 0.338, fs = 0.111, and
fΛb = 0.195, assuming fu + fd + fs + fΛb = 1. In other words, the fragmentation of a heavy
¯
Q into ¯
u ¯
d in a state with I = J = 0 occurs about half as frequently as fragmentation into
u. One can expect the same ratio for bb¯
u ¯
d relative to bbu.
VI
SUMMARY
The calculation in Ref. [2] makes use of a scheme in which quarks in baryons are endowed
with effective masses about 55 MeV heavier than those in mesons. An alternative approach
with universal quark masses compensates for this difference by adding a term S = 165 MeV
associated with a “string junction,” of which baryons possess one while mesons possess
none [12]. Unless the QQ system can be thought of as a pointlike object equivalent to a
heavy antiquark, a QQ¯
u ¯
d tetraquark will have two string junctions, with a corresponding

increase in its mass. An explicit calculation shows that this increase is not enough to push
the bb¯
u ¯
d ground state mass above B+B0γ threshold.
We have used the recent discovery by LHCb of a doubly-charmed baryon Ξ++
cc
[1] to
confirm an assumption about the interaction energy of two heavy quarks Q in a tetraquark
T = QQ¯
u ¯
d. This has enabled us to estimate the mass of the JP = 1+ ground state to
be 10, 389 ± 12 MeV, or 215 MeV below the threshold to decay strongly to a BB∗ pair
and 170 MeV below B− ¯
B0γ threshold. Such a state will then decay only weakly, initially
via the subprocess b → cW ∗−. The other b eventually also will decay via this subprocess,
leaving a final state with two charmed quarks, unless flavor-changing mixing of neutral B
or D mesons has taken place. The challenge will be to distinguish such a final state from
one with c¯
c.
Our approach is the first to use the discovery of Ξ++
cc to “calibrate” the binding energy in
a QQ diquark. However, many other estimates exist of masses of systems containing more
than one heavy quark, by methods such as QCD sum rules, potential models, heavy quark
effective theory, and lattice gauge theory, in addition to Ref. [7] and the many references
cited therein.
An early paper to tackle such problems is Ref. [13] which states in the Abstract “[...]
there is no [QQ ¯
Q ¯
Q] state below the threshold corresponding to the spontaneous dissociation
into two mesons.” Various potential ways out are discussed, including unequal masses.
According to ref. [10], “Four-quark states containing two identical heavy quarks are shown
to have a good probability of being stable against strong decays.” Recent treatments using
QCD sum rules [14,15] have an error of 200 MeV on a central value M(bb¯
u ¯
d) = 10300 MeV
and therefore do not deliver a crisp answer regarding stability of the bb¯
u ¯
d tetraquark against
strong decays. An early estimate [16] concluded that the bb¯
u ¯
d ground state tetraquark is
stable against strong and EM interactions, with a mass of 130 ± 15 MeV below BB∗
threshold and 85 ± 15 MeV below B0B+γ threshold. Ref. [17] finds that the ground state
cc¯
u ¯
d tetraquark “may be bound”; there is no discussion of the bb¯
u ¯
d tetraquark. This gives
an idea of the spread of results.
Lattice QCD calculations have matured to the point that their calculated masses of
heavy-quark systems are stable to better than 10 or 20 MeV, and agree with experiment
to at least that accuracy. An encouraging result [18] finds the lowest bb¯
u ¯
d state 144 ± 10
MeV below B− ¯
B0γ threshold, not far from our value of 170 ± 12 MeV. The lowest bb¯
s¯
q
state (q = u or d) is found to be 52 ± 8 MeV below BsBγ threshold.
Experimental search for the bb¯
u ¯
d tetraquark is a challenge well worth pursuing, because
it is the first manifestly exotic hadron stable under strong and EM interactions.
