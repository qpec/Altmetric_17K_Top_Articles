ABSTRACT
Secondhand tobacco smoke exposure in pregnancy increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. We evaluated in
rats whether there is a critical period during which tobacco smoke extract (TSE) affects the development of acetylcholine
and serotonin systems, prominent targets for adverse effects of nicotine and tobacco smoke. We simulated secondhand
smoke exposure by administering TSE so as to produce nicotine concentrations one-tenth those in active smoking, with 3
distinct, 10-day windows: premating, early gestation or late gestation. We conducted longitudinal evaluations in multiple
brain regions, starting in early adolescence (postnatal day 30) and continued to full adulthood (day 150). TSE exposure in
any of the 3 windows impaired presynaptic cholinergic activity, exacerbated by a decrement in nicotinic cholinergic
receptor concentrations. Although the adverse effects were seen for all 3 treatment windows, there was a distinct
progression, with lowest sensitivity for premating exposure and higher sensitivity for gestational exposures. Serotonin
receptors were also reduced by TSE exposure with the same profile: little effect with premating exposure, intermediate
effect with early gestational exposure and large effect with late gestational exposure. As serotonergic circuits can offset the
neurobehavioral impact of cholinergic deficits, these receptor changes were maladaptive. Thus, there is no single ‘critical
period’ for effects of low-level tobacco smoke but there is differential sensitivity dependent upon the developmental stage
at the time of exposure. Our findings reinforce the need to avoid secondhand smoke exposure not only during pregnancy,
but also in the period prior to conception, or generally for women of childbearing age.
Key words: acetylcholine; developmental neurotoxicity; nicotine; serotonin: tobacco smoke.
Active maternal smoking during pregnancy contributes signifi-
cantly to neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring, with
nicotine causing much of the adverse effects (England et al.,
2015; Pauly and Slotkin, 2008). A larger population is exposed to
secondhand cigarette smoke, about which much less is known
(U.S. Surgeon General, 2006). Prenatal exposure to secondhand
smoke is positively associated with neurodevelopmental def-
icits, including cognitive impairment and emotional disorders
(DiFranza et al., 2004; Herrmann et al., 2008; Yolton et al., 2005),
but causal proof has remained elusive for 2 reasons: the diffi-
culty of exposure assessment in human studies, and the dearth
of animal studies focusing on secondhand smoke (U.S. Surgeon
General, 2006). Nearly all preclinical research reports on cigar-
ette smoke have simulated active smoking rather than lower,
secondhand levels. In general, the outcomes of these higher ex-
posures resemble those of nicotine (Fuller et al., 2012; Golub
et al., 2007; Gospe et al., 2009; Slotkin et al., 2006b, c), albeit that
the smoke exposure includes the confound of unavoidable
stress resulting from repetitive, involuntary confinement in a
smoke-filled chamber.
Recently, we developed a tobacco smoke administration
model in pregnant rats that ensures reliable dosing and avoids
the stress of inhalation exposure (Hall et al., 2016; Slotkin et al.,
2015). We paralleled the standard technique for nicotine delivery
in pregnant rats, namely subcutaneously-implanted pumps
(Slotkin, 2008) that deliver standardized tobacco smoke extract
(TSE). We found that low TSE levels, comparable to secondhand
smoke exposure (i.e. producing plasma nicotine levels one-tenth

 of those in typical smokers), nevertheless engendered synaptic
dysfunction in acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin (5-hydroxy-
tryptamine, 5HT) systems, culminating in impaired cognitive and
emotional behaviors (Hall et al., 2016; Slotkin et al., 2015). TSE ex-
posure had greater effects than did comparable treatment with
nicotine alone and indeed, TSE was similar to a 10-fold higher
nicotine level; that is, TSE simulating secondhand exposure eli-

outcomes

levels.
Importantly, TSE impaired adaptive changes to the synaptic
damage. Nicotine alone produced compensatory upregulation of
nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) and 5HT receptors (Slotkin
et al., 2015), effects that would serve to offset deficits in presynap-
tic ACh activity (Aldridge et al., 2005). With TSE, these compensa-
tory effects were not only absent, but actually showed opposite
changes, namely, receptor reductions that augment presynaptic
deficits. Finally, many of the TSE effects reflected a direct impact
on neurodifferentiation, as they were recapitulated with an
in vitro TSE exposure model (Slotkin et al., 2014).
Our prior work established the effect of TSE with exposures
encompassing the entire period of development from concep-
tion through the second postnatal week (Hall et al., 2016; Slotkin
et al., 2015), paralleling stages of human fetal brain development
in all 3 trimesters (Rodier, 1988). The current study addresses
the important issue of whether there is a critical period for the
adverse effects of low-level TSE exposure on development of
ACh and 5HT systems. This type of information is vital to
understanding whether there is a ‘safe’ period in which expos-
ure might not be so injurious, or a particularly sensitive period
in which the major damage occurs. We evaluated exposure
prior to mating, exposure in early gestation (conception through
the neural tube stage), and exposure in late gestation (primary
period of neuronal cell replication and differentiation), modeled
on our earlier work (Slotkin et al., 2015). We assessed the impact
on brain regions comprising the major ACh and 5HT projections
and their corresponding cell bodies. For ACh, we assayed cho-
line acetyltransferase (ChAT), presynaptic high-affinity choline
transporters
(hemicholinium-3
[HC3]
binding)
and
a4b2
nAChRs. ChAT and high-affinity choline transporters are con-
stitutive components of ACh nerve terminals but differ in their
functional significance. ChAT synthesizes ACh, but is not regu-
lated by nerve impulse activity, so that it provides an index of
the development of ACh projections (Slotkin, 2008). However,
HC3 binding to the choline transporter is regulated by neuronal
activity (Klemm and Kuhar, 1979), so that the comparative effect
on HC3 binding versus ChAT (HC3/ChAT ratio) additionally en-
ables the
characterization
of
presynaptic
impulse
activity
(Slotkin, 2008). The a4b2 nAChR is the most abundant nAChR
subtype in the mammalian brain and regulates the ability of
ACh systems to release other neurotransmitters involved in re-
ward, cognition and mood (Dani and De Biasi, 2001). For 5HT
systems, we focused on 5HT1A and 5HT2 receptors, the subtypes
that are known to be major targets for developmental neurotox-
icity of nicotine (Slikker et al., 2005; Slotkin et al., 2007), and that
play major roles in 5HT-related mental disorders, including de-
pression (Maes and Meltzer, 1995).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tobacco

prepared
from
Kentucky
Reference cigarettes (KY3R4F) on a Rotary Smoke Machine
under
ISO

Organization
for
Standardization,
Geneva, Switzerland) smoke conditions. The smoke condensate
was collected on 92 mm filter pads, which were then extracted
by
shaking
for
20 min
with
undiluted
dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO),
to
obtain
a
solution
of
approximately
20 mg
of
condensate per ml. Condensate aliquots were stored in amber
vials at -80 �C until used. Two cigarettes were smoked to pro-
duce each ml of extract and the final product contained 0.8 mg/
ml nicotine (determined by the manufacturer).
Animal treatments. All experiments were carried out humanely
and with regard for alleviation of suffering, with protocols
approved
by
the

Animal
Care
and
Use
Committee and in accordance with all federal and state guide-
lines. Sprague-Dawley rats were shipped by climate-controlled
truck (transportation time< 1 h) and were allowed to acclimate to
the housing facility for 2 weeks prior to treatment. Treatments
were given via iPrecio
V
R microinfusion pumps, implanted subcu-
taneously. These pumps are refillable via a percutaneous septum,
so that a single surgery and pump implant could be used for
delivery of different treatments in sequence. Animals were anes-
thetized (60 mg/kg ketamineþ 0.15–0.50 mg/kg dexmedetomidine
given
i.p.;
followed
post-implant
by
0.15 mg/kg
atipemezo-
leþ 5 mg/kg ketoprofen given s.c. and topical bupivicaine). There
were 4 treatment groups, each comprising 12–13 dams: (1) con-
trols received DMSO vehicle throughout the entire 30-day treat-
ment period; (2) the TSE premating group received TSE for the
first 10 days, followed by DMSO for the remaining 20 days; (3) the
TSE early gestation group received DMSO for the first 10 days,
then TSE for the next 10 days, followed by DMSO for the last 10
days; and (4) the TSE late gestation group received DMSO for the
first 20 days, then TSE for 10 days. To maintain a constant dose
level equivalent to 0.2mg/kg/day of nicotine, the pump flow rate
was adjusted upward to compensate for weight gain during preg-
nancy. At the end of the first 10-day infusion period, mating was
initiated by including a male rat in the cage for 4 days, after
which the pregnant dams were placed in breeding cages. Because
conception could have taken place at any point during the mat-
ing period, the actual gestational exposure periods have an
uncertainty of a few days; using parturition dates as a bench-
mark, the values ranged as follows: TSE premating group, begun
10-13 days prior to fertilization and terminating between 0 and 3
days prefertilization; TSE early gestation group, begun between 1
and 4 days prefertilization and terminating between gestational
days 6–9; TSE late gestation group, begun between 7 and 9 days of
gestation and terminating between days 17 and 19 of gestation.

The birth date was considered to be postnatal day (PN) 0, at
which point litters were culled to 8-10 pups to ensure standard
nutrition. Weaning occurred on PN21. On PN30, 60, 100 and 150,
animals were decapitated and brain regions were dissected for
determination of ACh and 5HT synaptic markers: frontal/parie-
tal cortex, temporal/occipital cortex, hippocampus, striatum,
midbrain and brainstem. The 2 cortical regions were sectioned
at the midline and the right half used for the current determina-
tions. The left halves of the cortical regions were reserved for
future studies, along with the cerebellum, which is sparse in
ACh and 5HT projections. Tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at �80 �C until assayed. Each treatment group com-
prised 12 animals at each age point, equally divided into males
and females. Animals were selected such that, for any single
time point, no more than 1 male and 1 female were chosen
from the same litter for each treatment group; over the 4
sequential time points, no more than 3 males and 3 females
were utilized from each litter out of a total of 48 animals for a

 given treatment group (4 time points, 2 sexes, n ¼ 6 at each time
point).
Assays. Assays were conducted on each individual tissue, so
that each determination represented a value from the corre-
sponding brain region of 1 animal. Tissues were thawed in 79
volumes of ice-cold 10 mM sodium-potassium phosphate buffer
(pH
7.4)
and
homogenized
with
a
Polytron
(Brinkmann
Instruments, Westbury, New York, USA). Aliquots of the homo-
genate were assayed for ChAT using established procedures
(Qiao et al., 2003). Each tube contained 50 mM [14C]acetyl-coen-
zyme A as a substrate and activity was determined as the
amount of labeled ACh produced relative to tissue protein. For
measurements of HC3 binding, the cell membrane fraction was
prepared from an aliquot of the same tissue homogenate by
sedimentation at 40 000 � g for 15 min. The pellet was resus-
pended and washed, and the resultant pellet was assayed, using
a ligand concentration of 2 nM [3H]HC3 with or without 10 mM
unlabeled HC3 to displace specific binding (Qiao et al., 2003).
Determinations of nAChR binding were carried out in another
aliquot, each assay containing 1 nM [3H]cytisine with or without
10 mM nicotine to displace specific binding (Slotkin et al., 2008).
Similarly, we determined binding to 5HT receptors with estab-
lished techniques (Slotkin et al., 2006a), using 1 nM [3H]8-
hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin for 5HT1A receptors, and
0.4 nM [3H]ketanserin for 5HT2 receptors. For 5HT1A receptors,
specific binding was displaced by addition of 100 mM 5HT; for
5HT2 receptors, we used 10 mM methylsergide for displacement.
Ligand binding was calculated relative to the membrane protein
concentration.
Some of the regions had insufficient amounts of tissue to
permit all assays to be performed. Accordingly, we did not
obtain values for 5HT receptors in either the striatum or hippo-
campus, nor did we measure nAChRs in the striatum on PN30.
Data analysis. The initial statistical comparisons were conducted
by a global analysis of variance (ANOVA; data log-transformed
because of heterogeneous variance among regions, measures
and ages) incorporating all the variables and measurements in
a single test so as to avoid an increased probability of type 1
errors that might otherwise result from multiple tests of the
same data set. The variables in the global test were prenatal
treatment (vehicle and the 3 different TSE exposure windows),
brain region, age and sex, with multiple dependent measures
(hereafter, designated simply as ‘measures’): ChAT, HC3 binding
and nAChR binding for the ACh synaptic makers; 5HT1A and
5HT2 receptor binding for the 5HT synaptic markers. For both
transmitter systems, the dependent measures were treated as
repeated measures, since all the determinations were derived
from the same sample. Where we identified interactions of
treatment with the other variables, data were then subdivided
for lower-order ANOVAs to evaluate treatments that differed
from the corresponding control or from each other. As permit-
ted by the interaction terms, individual treatments that differed
from control were identified with Fisher’s Protected Least
Significant Difference Test. However, where treatment effects
were not interactive with other variables, we report only the
main treatment effects without performing lower-order analy-
ses of individual values. Significance was assumed at the level
of P < .05.
Data were compiled as means and standard errors. To ena-
ble ready visualization of treatment effects across different
regions, ages and measures, the results are given as the percent
change from control values, but statistical procedures were
always conducted on the original data, with log transforms
because of heterogeneous variance as noted above. In addition,
the log-transform evaluates the treatment differences as a pro-
portion to control values, rather than as an arithmetic differ-
ence. This was important because of technical limitations: on
any single day, we could conduct assays for all treatment
groups and both sexes, but for only 1 region at 1 age point.
Accordingly, representing the data as proportional differences
(percent control) enables a full comparison of treatment effects
and treatment interactions with all the other variables, even
though absolute values for the controls cannot be compared
across regions and ages (since assays for each region and age
point were run on separate days). Graphs were scaled to encom-
pass the different dynamic ranges of the changes in the various
parameters. The absolute values for each set of determinations
appear in the Supplementary tables.
Materials. TSE was prepared by Arista Laboratories (Richmond,
Virginia, USA). Animals were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories (Raleigh, North Carolina, USA) and iPrecio
V
R implant-
able microinfusion pumps were from Primetech Corp. (Tokyo,
Japan). PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, Massachusetts, USA)
was the source for [3H]HC3 (specific activity, 125 Ci/mmol),
[3H]cytisine (specific activity 35 Ci/mmol), [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-
propylamino)tetralin
(specific
activity,
135 Ci/mmol),
[3H]ketanserin (63 Ci/mmol) and [14C]acetyl-coenzyme A (specific
activity 6.7 mCi/mmol). Methylsergide was obtained from Sandoz
Pharmaceuticals (East Hanover, New Jersey, USA) and all other
chemicals came from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Missouri,
USA).
RESULTS
Maternal, Litter and Growth Effects
There were no significant effects of any of the treatments on
maternal weight gain, the proportion of dams giving birth, litter
size, or sex ratio (data not shown). There were small, but statis-
tically
significant
effects
on
growth
of
the
offspring
(Supplementary Table S1). Two of the TSE groups (premating
and early gestational exposure) showed a 3–5% lower overall
weight but after subdivision by age, the only significant effect
was for the early gestational group on PN30. Brain region
weights were not significantly different for any of the treat-
ments (Supplementary Table S1).
ACh Synaptic Markers
Multivariate ANOVA incorporating all 4 treatment groups, sex,
age, brain region and the 3 ACh synaptic measures (ChAT activ-
ity, HC3 binding, nAChR binding) indicated a main effect of the
treatments (P < .0001) that interacted with 3 of the other varia-
bles: P < .0001 for treatment � measure, P < .005 for treatment �
sex, and P < .02 for treatment � measure � age. In light of the
strong interaction of treatment � measure, we subdivided the
data into the individual measures and looked for treatment
effects and interactions of treatment with the remaining
variables.
For
ChAT
activity,
ANOVA
incorporating
all
treatment
groups indicated a main effect of treatment (P < .0001) that
depended on age (treatment � age, P < .02), sex (treatment �
sex,
P < .0003)
and
region
(treatment
�
region,
P < .04).
Accordingly, we evaluated main effects and interactions for
each of the treatment paradigms. Premating exposure to TSE
produced a consistent, highly significant overall increase in

 ChAT activity, without distinction by age, sex or region
(Fig.
1A). Shifting the exposure period to early gestation likewise pro-
duced a significant net elevation (main treatment effect) but
with a more selective pattern (Fig. 1B). Values were elevated on
PN30 but returned to normal by the closure of adolescence
(PN60), only to have the increases reemerge later in adulthood
(PN100, PN150). The effects of early gestational exposure were
also sex selective, (greater effects in males), and regionally
selective (greater effects in temporal/occipital cortex, striatum
and midbrain). In contrast, TSE exposure in late gestation eli-
cited a different pattern of effects on ChAT activity (Fig. 1C),
with significant elevations in males but decrements in females.
To illustrate the differences in the main treatment effects
among the 3 groups, we calculated the mean values for effects
on ChAT activity, collapsed across region and age (Fig. 1D). This
simplified picture dilutes the effects seen for specific regions or
ages by averaging them with data points for which there was no
effect or an opposite effect, so that the absolute magnitude
becomes smaller. Despite these limitations, there was an
obvious overall pattern: premating TSE exposure increased
ChAT equivalently in males and females, early gestational
exposure evoked bigger increases in males than females, and
late
gestational
exposure
elicited
increases
in
males
but
decreases in females. In males, the early gestation period
appeared to be the most sensitive, with elevations significantly
greater than either the premating group (P < .009) or the late
gestational group (P < .0001). In females, the decrease that was
unique to late gestational period was statistically distinguish-
able from the increases seen with the other 2 regimens
(P < .0001 for each).
For HC3 binding, the global ANOVA indicated a main treat-
ment effect (P < .0001) but no significant interactions of treat-
ment with the other variables. Accordingly, we examined each
exposure group for main treatment effects only (retaining the
other factors in the ANOVA design, but ignoring lower-order,
‘significant’ interactions as potentially spurious). TSE adminis-
tered in the premating period evoked a significant overall decre-
ment (Fig. 2A), as did early (Fig. 2B) or late (Fig. 2C) gestational
exposure. Again, we collapsed the treatment effects across the
other variables (sex, age, region) to compare the magnitude of
the deficits (Fig. 2D), this time also collapsing the sex variable,
since there was no treatment � sex interaction. There was a
clear progression of sensitivity, with the lowest effect seen for
premating exposure, followed by early gestational exposure,
and with the greatest effect from late gestational exposure:
P < .0003 for premating versus early gestation, P < .0001 for pre-
mating versus late gestation, P < .008 for early gestation versus
late gestation.
For the HC3/ChAT ratio, there was a significant main treat-
ment effect (P < .0001) that interacted only with sex (treatment
� sex, P < .04); however, after subdivision, none of the individual
treatments retained sufficient statistical power to give a treat-
ment � sex interaction, so interpretation was again limited to
the main treatment effects. TSE given premating produced a
significant decrement in the ratio (Fig. 3A), as did exposure dur-
ing either the early (Fig. 3B) or late (Fig. 3C) gestational period.
Collapsing the treatment effects across the other variables
again showed that premating exposure had a lesser overall
effect
than
either gestational exposure
window
(Fig.
3D):
P < .0005 for premating versus early gestation, P < .0001 for pre-
mating versus late gestation.

 For nAChR binding, the overall ANOVA indicated a signifi-
cant main treatment effect (P < .0001) and interactions of treat-
ment � age (P < .02) and treatment � sex (P < .002). Again, this
justified separation of the individual treatments and examina-
tion of main treatment effects and interactions for each. TSE
exposure in the premating period elicited a sex-selective effect
on nAChR binding, with a significant overall decrement in
females but not males (Fig. 4A); in fact, males tended to show
an increase instead of a decrease (P < .07). Shifting the exposure
window to the early gestational period elicited a consistent
decrease in nAChR binding across both sexes (Fig. 4B). With late
gestational TSE exposure, there was a robust decrement for
both males and females (Fig. 4C), larger than that seen with
either of the other exposures (P < .0001 compared to premating
TSE, P < .03 compared to early gestation TSE), but again, the
decrease in females was much larger. These overall patterns
were evident with values collapsed across age and region (Fig.
4D). In males, the decrement caused by exposure in either of the
2 gestational windows was distinguishable from the increase
evoked by premating TSE (P < .0001 for each); for females, expo-
sure in the late gestational window had greater effects than for
premating or early gestational exposure (P < .0001 for each).
5HT receptors
Multivariate ANOVA incorporating all 4 treatment groups, sex,
brain region and the 2 5HT receptor measurements (5HT1A and
5HT2 subtypes) indicated a main effect of treatment (P < .0001)
that was subtype-selective (treatment � measure, P < .0001) and
age-dependent (treatment � age, P < .02). Given the interaction
of treatment � measure, we separated the 2 subtypes for lower-
order examination of treatment effects and interactions of
treatment with the other variables.
For the 5HT1A subtype, the overall ANOVA indicated a main
treatment effect (P < .0001) that interacted with age (treatment �
age, P < .05). Premating TSE exposure had no significant effect
(Fig. 5A). In contrast, TSE exposure during the early gestational
period elicited a significant overall deficit, with a distinct time
progression
(Fig. 5B):
values were
initially
subnormal,
but
returned to control values by PN100, only to see reemergence of
deficits by PN150. The same pattern was seen for late gestational
TSE exposure except that the deficits were larger (P < .01 compar-
ing main treatment effects for the 2 windows; Fig. 5C). The pro-
gressive increase in sensitivity to TSE from premating to early
gestational to late gestational exposure was readily apparent
with values collapsed across sex, age and region (Fig. 5D):
P < .0004 comparing premating TSE to early gestational exposure,
P < .0001 comparing premating TSE to late gestational exposure,
P < .0006 comparing the 2 gestational exposure groups.
The 5HT2 receptor subtype likewise showed a significant
treatment effect (P < .0001) but no interactions with the other
factors. Neither premating TSE exposure (Fig. 6A) nor exposure
in the early gestational period (Fig. 6B) showed significant dif-
ferences. However, just as with the 5HT1A subtype, the late ges-
tational
exposure
group
was
more
sensitive,
showing
significant deficits compared to control values (Fig. 6C) that
were clearly distinguishable from the lack of effect seen in the
other 2 windows (P < .0001 comparing main treatment effects).
For the late gestational group, the deficit for 5HT2 receptors was
notably smaller than that seen for the 5HT1A subtype (P < .0001).
Again, these relationships were readily apparent with values
collapsed across sex, age and region (Fig. 6D).

 DISCUSSION
There are 2 major findings. First, there is a progressive sensitiv-
ity of the developing brain to TSE disruption of ACh circuits,
with smallest effects from premating exposure, followed by
early gestation, and then greatest effects from late gestation.
The second finding is that there is no ‘critical period.’ All expo-
sure paradigms produced defects, even premating treatment,
where TSE terminated prior to conception. These outcomes are
even more notable, given that we modeled low levels paralleling
secondhand smoke, rather than active maternal smoking, and
that TSE underestimates the impact because it does not include
gaseous components that are likely to be injurious, such as HCN
and CO.
For each window, our findings resembled those seen earlier
for continuous, perinatal TSE exposure (Slotkin et al., 2015),
namely a deficit in presynaptic ACh activity augmented by loss
of postsynaptic nAChRs and a parallel shortfall of 5HT recep-
tors. With exposure to nicotine alone, there are compensatory
responses that partially offset deficient presynaptic ACh activ-
ity, including upregulation of both receptor classes (Slotkin
et al., 2015); in the face of ACh presynaptic damage, augmented
5HT function can restore behavioral performance (Aldridge
et al., 2005). However, TSE exposure instead produces a loss of
nAChRs and 5HT receptors, augmenting the presynaptic deficit
(Slotkin et al., 2015). Here, this pattern was seen with each treat-
ment paradigm, in whole or in part, with the gestational win-
dows most closely paralleling the effects of more prolonged TSE
exposure (Slotkin et al., 2015). Thus the HC3/ChAT ratio, which
assesses presynaptic ACh activity, was decreased equivalently
with either early gestational or late gestational exposure, but
the receptor deficiencies were more profound with the latter.
Exposure in the premating period produced a smaller decre-
ment in presynaptic activity, a loss of nAChRs that was limited
to females (whereas it involved both sexes for gestational treat-
ments),
and
maintenance
of
normal
5HT
receptors.
Nevertheless, despite the similar directions of overall effects,
the different developmental windows exhibited targeting of dis-
tinct events in neurodifferentiation. For early gestational expo-
sure, deficient ACh presynaptic activity reflected a greater
impact on ChAT activity and a lesser effect on HC3 binding, as
compared to late gestation, where the reverse was true.
Likewise, the effects on nAChR binding were sex-selective for
premating and late gestational exposures, but not for early ges-
tational
exposure;
again,
the
sex
preference
(female
effect > male) was the same as that seen earlier with continuous
perinatal exposure (Slotkin et al., 2015). Given that the TSE expo-
sures of both sexes were identical, the male-female differences
undoubtedly arise from post-injury adaptations that are them-
selves sex-dependent. Thus, the overall pattern is for increasing
fetal sensitivity to TSE as development progresses, but superim-
posed on this overall pattern, there are maturational events
that are distinct to each window and that are differentially
vulnerable.
The 2 key questions are: (1) why does sensitivity to TSE
increase as gestation proceeds, and (2) why is the premating
period vulnerable, when there is no brain formation going on
during exposure? Greater sensitivity during late gestation is
readily explainable. With early toxicant exposure, lost neurons
can be replaced because of the plasticity engendered by high
rates of neuronal cell replication, whereas differentiated neu-
rons cannot divide and thus are incapable of making up for

 deficits (Rodier, 1988). Thus, massive initial disruption of brain
structure by nicotine up to the neural tube stage nevertheless is
repaired and ultimately results in near-normal morphology
(Slotkin, 2008). In contrast, the late gestational exposure win-
dow encompasses phases of terminal neurodifferentiation and
assembly of higher-order brain structures, events that, if sub-
jected to damage, are not readily reversible. By the same token,
it might be expected that postnatal TSE exposure (paralleling
third trimester human development) could have even greater
effects. Our earlier study of prolonged TSE exposure spanned all
of gestation and the first 2 postnatal weeks (Slotkin et al., 2015),
but was also limited by the fact that exposure via maternal milk
delivers a lower dose than does direct fetal perfusion during
gestation; thus, even that study still underestimates the poten-
tial impact of tobacco smoke exposure. Cigarette smoke expo-
sure in the postnatal period mimicking active smoking, is
known to cause neurobehavioral damage (Torres et al., 2015)
and this is also seen with nicotine-containing e-cigarette vapor
(Smith et al., 2015). It would thus be worthwhile to devise a sec-
ondhand smoke exposure animal model for third trimester
human exposure.
Our most intriguing finding is that TSE exposure is injurious
even when limited to the premating period. There are 4 possible
explanations. First, despite the cessation of TSE administration
prior to conception, certain TSE components could persist into
the early gestational period and thus affect brain formation.
The half-life of nicotine in the rat is only about 1 h (Kyerematen
et al., 1988), so it is highly unlikely that the effects of premating
TSE exposure reflect this chemical component. However, the
same
is
not
true
for
nicotine
metabolites
that
are
also
potentially bioactive, and which have half-lives of several days
(Kyerematen et al., 1988), or for potentially long-lived lipophilic
organic chemicals in TSE; for example, the terminal half-life of
benzo[a]pyrene is about 17 hr (Foth et al., 1988). A second possi-
bility is that TSE could produce lasting changes in maternal
physiology, hormonal status and/or placental formation or
function. Smoking in pregnancy produces persistent changes in
plasma thiocyanate levels that compromise oxygen delivery
(Jensen and Foss, 1981), in maternal metabolism (Pirani and
MacGillivray, 1978), and in the risk of placental disorders
(Naeye, 1979), all of which are likely to persist beyond the pres-
ence of TSE components. A third reason for premating TSE
effects could be epigenetic changes in the ovum. Maternal
smoking during pregnancy clearly produces epigenetic changes
in the offspring (Knopik et al., 2012; Murphy et al., 2012; Suter
et al., 2013) but there are no data available as to whether these
can be induced prior to fertilization; clearly, this is an important
area for future study. Yet a fourth possibility for sensitivity to
premating TSE exposure, is that adverse effects could be con-
tributed by nicotine withdrawal. The current study design
involves withdrawal at different points in gestation, whereas
our prior study with continuous TSE did not (Slotkin et al., 2015).
We regard this explanation as unlikely. First, the exposure
model simulates nicotine levels associated with secondhand
smoke exposure, not active smoking. Second, the effects of the
treatment windows here were equivalent to, or less than, those
seen with continuous exposure, whereas if withdrawal were
responsible for the effects, they should have been greater. The
first 3 possibilities are thus the most likely explanations for pre-
mating TSE effects but we have no current information to select

 among those hypotheses. Regardless, though, the main point is
that TSE is injurious to brain development even when discon-
tinued prior to conception.
We also considered whether pharmacokinetic factors at the
various developmental stages could contribute to differential
sensitivity to TSE. Specifically, the premating and early gesta-
tional windows involve a span in which there is no direct con-
nection between the maternal circulation and the ovum or
embryo; in the rat, fetal implantation in the uterine wall occurs
in the latter half of the first week postconception. However, if a
direct circulatory connection were required, we would expect
no effect whatsoever for the premating window, which was not
the case. Indeed, because we used a continuous infusion model,
all water spaces within the dam achieve and maintain a steady-
state equilibrium for lipophilic substances even without a direct
circulatory connection (Goldstein et al., 1974), and these spaces
include the ovum, embryo, placenta and amniotic fluid; nicotine
and TSE organics are all highly lipophilic and thus will equili-
brate. Accordingly, it is likely that the developing organism is
exposed to effective concentrations of TSE components in all of
the exposure windows. Actually, since the placenta serves as a
diffusion barrier and metabolizes many foreign substances,
exposure might even be lower in the period after the embryo
implants in the uterine wall.
Finally, a number of parameters showed recovery in late
adolescence to early adulthood, but a subsequent return to
abnormal values: 5HT1A receptors with either gestational win-
dow, 5HT2 receptors for late gestational exposure, and ChAT
activity for early gestational exposure. The temporary restora-
tive effects may represent compensations for deficient ACh
function that eventually fail to keep up with the underlying
damage, or, more intriguingly, that may reemerge as a presage
of aging. Future work should address whether premating and/or
gestational exposure to secondhand smoke could result in ear-
lier onset of the impairments associated with senescence.
Indeed, we have already shown this to be the case for organo-
phosphate pesticides, that like TSE, cause damage to ACh and
5HT circuits (Levin et al., 2010).
In conclusion, our results provide some of the first mecha-
nistic connections between secondhand tobacco smoke expo-
sure and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, specifically
identifying the late gestational stage as the most vulnerable. At
the same time, however, we found that susceptibility is present
to varying extents at all stages. The fact that damage is pro-
duced even when exposure is limited to the premating period
has important implications for public health, as it reinforces the
need to avoid secondhand smoke exposure not only during
pregnancy, but also in the period prior to conception, or gener-
ally for women of childbearing age.
