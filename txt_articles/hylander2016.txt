 Opinion
Thermoneutrality, Mice, and
Cancer: A Heated Opinion
Bonnie L. Hylander1 and Elizabeth A. Repasky1,*
The ‘mild’ cold stress caused by standard sub-thermoneutral housing temper-
atures used for laboratory mice in research institutes is sufficient to significantly
bias conclusions drawn from murine models of several human diseases. We
review the data leading to this conclusion, discuss the implications for research
and suggest ways to reduce problems in reproducibility and experimental
transparency caused by this housing variable. We have found that these cool
temperatures suppress endogenous immune responses, skewing tumor growth
data and the severity of graft versus host disease, and also increase the
therapeutic resistance of tumors. Owing to the potential for ambient tempera-
ture to affect energy homeostasis as well as adrenergic stress, both of which
could contribute to biased outcomes in murine cancer models, housing tem-
perature should be reported in all publications and considered as a potential
source of variability in results between laboratories. Researchers and regulatory
agencies should work together to determine whether changes in housing
parameters would enhance the use of mouse models in cancer research, as
well as for other diseases. Finally, for many years agencies such as the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) have encouraged the development of newer and more
sophisticated mouse models for cancer research, but we believe that, without
an appreciation of how basic murine physiology is affected by ambient temper-
ature, even data from these models is likely to be compromised.
Room Temperature: So Much More Than a Thermometer Reading
Thermoregulation has been a topic of intense interest to physiologists for over a century and it is
now well understood that maintenance of a constant core body temperature requires significant
vascular, neural, and biochemical activity as well as conscious and unconscious behavioral
adaptations all of which depend on ambient temperature [1–4]. Physiologists have found major
differences between the thermal physiology of mice, other mammals, and humans [3,5–12],
such that at ambient temperatures in which humans feel comfortable, mice experience chronic
mild cold stress directly impacting their metabolism and thermoregulatory status. Laboratory
mice are almost always housed and studied at mildly cool temperatures well below their
‘thermoneutral zone’ which is the ambient temperature in which metabolic heat production
is minimal and the mouse does not need to work to keep warm or cold. It is the ambient
temperature at which a stable core temperature can be maintained by the basal metabolism of
the animal at rest and by ‘adjustments in insulation, posture, and skin blood flow’ [6]. For healthy
mice, this thermoneutral temperature (TT, see Glossary) is generally 30–32 8C, and it has
been known for many decades that, given a choice, mice will choose to spend the majority of
time in this range [13].
Importantly, mice rely on metabolic heat generation by ‘adaptive thermogenesis’ to a much
greater degree than do humans. Adaptive thermogenesis, also known as non-shivering ther-
mogenesis, is a mechanism of metabolic heat production which involves stimulation of the

Housing temperature should be reported
in every study such that potential sources
of data bias or non-reproducibility can be
identified.
Our opinion is that any experiment
designed to understand tumor biology
and/or having an immune component
could potentially have different out-
comes in mice housed at ST versus
TT and this should be tested.

 Glossary
Adrenergic receptors: a family of
G-protein-coupled receptors present
on the surface of almost all cells in
the body, including immune cells and
cancer cells. Differential receptor
expression on different cell types
mediates different responses.
Elevation in norepinephrine (NE)
during chronic cold stress thus has
potential to act on many cell types in
addition to adipose tissue because
NE is widely released during a
sympathetic response.
Energy balance: this describes the
overall comparison between intake of
energy resources (e.g., from diet) and
the expenditure of energy (e.g., for
immune responses, work/exercise, or
thermoregulation).
Sub-thermoneutral temperatures
(ST): environmental temperatures
which are below the thermoneutral
zone. At these temperatures, mice
experience chronic cold stress and
must expend large amounts of
energy to generate enough heat to
maintain normal body temperature.
Mice use adaptive thermogenesis
primarily to generate sufficient heat to
maintain body temperature, whereas
humans rely largely on normal
metabolism and vascular activity
because they are able to adjust their
thermal environment to reduce cold
stress.
Thermogenesis: the production of
heat by an animal. Maintenance of
normal body temperature is a crucial
homeostatic requirement for survival.
When an animal is cold, the brain
initiates behavioral responses (e.g.,
moving to a warmer location) and
neural responses (thermogenesis) to
conserve and generate heat.
Shivering is initiated for short-term
heat production in skeletal muscle.
Non-shivering (adaptive)
thermogenesis occurs in brown
adipose tissue (BAT) which expands
with chronic exposure to cold. The
primary driver of thermogenesis is NE
released from sympathetic nerves in
BAT.
Thermoneutral zone or
temperature (TT): the temperature
range within which the heat
produced as a byproduct of normal
metabolism alone, combined with
blood flow movements from the core
to the surface of the body, enables
an animal to maintain a normal core
body temperature of approximately
37 8C. For mice this is in the range of
sympathetic nervous system to release norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine, resulting in
increased metabolic activity needed for heat generation in brown adipose tissue (BAT)
[10,12]. NE binding to adrenergic receptors on brown fat cells causes increased expression
of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) in the mitochondria such that most of the energy produced by
oxidative respiration immediately generates heat rather than ATP. Indeed, it was shown long ago
that heat production through this form of thermogenesis in mice can be triple that of basal
metabolism, and is greater than any other animal investigated [14,15]. Living with chronic
cold stress and the need for increased metabolic production of heat has considerable physio-
logic consequences because for each 1 8C drop in ambient temperature it takes about
46.3 kcal/m2/24 h to maintain normal body temperature [13]. Because of the large energetic
drain associated with adaptive thermogenesis, mice in nature actively strive to minimize heat loss
under cold conditions by seeking thermoneutral temperatures, building warmer nests, and
aggregating in larger numbers. Thyroid hormone also plays a crucial role in adaptive thermo-
genesis. The full thermogenic response of BAT requires ligation of nuclear thyroid hormone
receptors (transcription factors) which increases the sensitivity of BAT cells to adrenergic
stimulation allowing UCP-1 expression [16,17].
While it is obvious that mice have a very small body surface area to volume ratio compared to
humans, it is not generally realized that this results in rapid heat loss to their environment
whenever ambient temperature falls below thermoneutrality. In addition, because of their small
size, mice cannot bear enough fur or fat insulation to prevent heat loss to their environment. This
fact underlies the approximately sevenfold higher metabolic rate of a mouse compared with that
of a human [18]. Moreover, it is important to take into consideration that thermogenesis is
accompanied by increased production of NE [10,19] which, because of the widespread
distribution of adrenergic receptors on different cell types, can have pleiotropic effects.
What About Mice Housed in Colonies for Research: In Vivo Veritas?
In the laboratory, mice are able to consume unlimited food to meet the energetic requirements of
adaptive thermogenesis. However, Martin et al. [20] have voiced strong concerns that ‘control’
mice are in fact ‘sedentary, obese and glucose intolerant’ and cautioned that this has great
potential to ‘confound data interpretation on outcomes of human studies.’ The authors note that
lack of exercise and unlimited access to food are major culprits. Others have recently begun to
recognize the underlying role of cool ambient temperatures in causing overeating and metabolic
disorders [7,21,22]. To maintain laboratory mice under conditions ‘judged to be scientifically,
technically and humanely appropriate’, guidelines are put forth in an internationally recognized
document, The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [23], produced by the National
Research Council (NRC). The Guide governs all aspects of housing conditions for experimental
animals in research facilities (e.g., nutrition, ambient temperature, housing density, etc.) and
states that mice should be housed between 20–26 8C. While a mildly cool room temperature
helps to maintain the thermal comfort of animal care workers, it is also thought to be beneficial for
mouse husbandry because it results in increased litter size and viability [15]. However, it was
recently published that mouse reproductive fitness is actually maintained even when they are
housed up to 28 8C [24]. What is not generally appreciated is the fact that the Guide states in
several different places that variations in these microenvironmental housing factors could affect
behavior, physiology (reproduction), phenotype and, possibly, experimental outcomes. How-
ever, because these decisions are under the purview of the animal care staff, they are ‘under the
radar’ of most researchers and are not generally considered in terms of experimental outcomes.
This dichotomy between the mandated, standard temperature (sub-thermoneutral temper-
ature, ST) and the thermoneutral temperature (TT) is acknowledged in the Guide, which
recommends that mice be provided with nesting materials or shelter (see also [25,26]). However,
these measures are not always in place, and even when they are, mice are often seen to ‘huddle’
to minimize heat loss and exhibit signs of cold stress [6].

 Researchers have noted a variety of significant differences in mice housed at ST versus TT,
including differences in basal metabolism [12], cardiovascular physiology [27,28], the size of
organs and tail length [29], and the effects of hypoxia on lipolysis during thermogenesis [30].
Physiological responses such as heart rate and metabolic rate have a linear relationship with the
ambient temperature (see review by Maloney et al. [22]). We have focused here on comparisons
between experimental mice at only ST and TT because differences in experimental models have
been recently documented. In the future, it will also be important to determine experimental
outcomes at intermediate temperatures. In addition to room temperature, mouse housing
density is also known to affect stress levels [31,32] and, because temperatures in the cage
are altered by the number of mice/cage [33], there is great opportunity for variation in the degree
of chronic cold stress experienced during the course of the experiment. Therefore, investigators
should be aware that removing mice during an experiment may affect metabolism, as well as
many of the other temperature-sensitive biological/physiological responses that are discussed
below. This likely contributes to experimental variability between experiments and labs. Changes
in fat tissue also accompany cold stress. In general, BAT increases activity and volume with cold
stress [10,34–37], and recently it has been recognized that cells in white adipose tissue (WAT)
can be converted to a brown phenotype by cold exposure [38] (reviewed by [39]). Smith et al.
have recently visualized significant differences in BAT in mice at ST and TT showing that the lipid
to water ratio in BAT is reduced in colder temperatures in accord with its role in thermogenesis
[40]. In addition, an important role for a layer of dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT) in
thermogenesis has been described [41], and it will be important to determine how this fat
depot may change between ST and TT. The data discussed below show that the chronic mild
cold stress imposed by housing mice at ST versus TT is a fundamental factor affecting murine
models of tumor growth and antitumor immunity.
Feeling Cold, Tumor Immunology, and Therapeutic Efficacy – Not a Good
Forecast
We recently compared tumor growth at ST and TT in several syngeneic and carcinogen-induced
murine tumor models and found that tumors grow significantly more slowly when mice are
housed at TT instead of ST [42]. In addition, spontaneous lung metastases of 4T1 were also
significantly reduced in mice at TT. However, when tumors were grown in immunodeficient mice,
no differences in growth occurred, implicating the adaptive immune response in improved tumor
control at TT. In experiments in which CD8+ T cells were depleted, the beneficial effect of TT was
lost. At TT, tumors and draining lymph nodes contained significantly greater numbers of CD8+ T
cells including antigen-specific cells. There were also greater numbers of activated CD8+ T cells
at TT as judged by CD69, IFNg, and Glut-1 expression. On the other hand, populations of Tregs
(FoxP3+ cells) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC: CD11b+GR-1+) were significantly
higher at ST than at TT. Thus, the ability of mice to control tumor growth under optimized thermal
physiology may be much greater than currently appreciated based on experiments carried out at
ST. This shift in the balance of effector and suppressor cells matters because researchers spend
considerable time and effort testing ways to improve antitumor immunity, and it is probable that
housing conditions themselves are a significant contributing factor to immunosuppression. At
thermoneutrality the mechanisms underlying successful antitumor immune responses may differ
from those mechanisms at ST. For example, recent evidence shows that exposure of mice to
mild cold stress (ST) affects the differentiation pathway of macrophages such that IL-4-mediated
‘alternative activation’ of adipose tissue macrophages (which secrete NE) occurs to promote
thermogenesis in BAT and lipolysis in WAT [43]. These alternatively activated macrophages
could themselves be another source of immunosuppression.
We also found that NE levels were higher in tumors of mice at ST compared to TT [44]. In more
recent work, M. Bucsek et al. (manuscript in preparation) find that, at ST, tumor growth can be
significantly delayed by administration of propranolol (a b-adrenergic receptor antagonist), and
30–32 8C. However, mice are housed
at temperatures below this zone in
research colonies. The standard
ambient housing temperature for
research mice is sub-thermoneutral
at 20–26 8C, with most institutes
using a range from 21–23 8C. In
most cases the ambient room
temperature used is not reported in
the literature.
168

 this effect is also CD8+ T cell-dependent, suggesting a causative role for NE-mediated stress
signaling in dampening antitumor immunity. In addition to a role for adrenergic stress in causing
immunosuppression, there may also be a role for abnormal energy balance in mildly cold-
stressed mice. It has been noted by others [45] that the increase in fuel consumption required for
activation of the immune system (up to 2000 kJ/day) is enough to disrupt most other homeo-
static needs of the body. It is likely that with the burden of rapid tumor growth, expansion of
immune cell populations would compete for energy needed for thermogenesis such that,
ultimately, immunosuppression may protect the ability of the organism to maintain body
temperature. Much more research will be necessary to dissect these potential mechanisms
and their role in ultimately shaping an effective antitumor immune response. Related to this point,
it is important to note that, in all of our experiments comparing ST with TT, the core temperatures
of mice maintained at 22 8C remained normothermic for several weeks. Finally, while core
temperature (approximately 37 8C) was also found to be similar in mice held at 20 8C and 25 8C
by Uchida et al. [46], these authors found that skin temperature is lower in mice held at 20 8C.
Thus, researchers should be aware that the tumor microenvironment of subcutaneous tumor
models in mice held at ST could be hypothermic while in mice held at TT, the temperature of a
subcutaneous tumor could be 30 8C if not higher because the tumor may be perfused by core
temperature blood circulating to the surface for heat loss (although this would still be cooler than
normal body temperature). The actual impact of internal tumor temperature in different sites of
the body on tumor growth has not yet been addressed.
Because dendritic cell (DC) function is crucial for T cell activation, our group also examined how
housing temperature might impact these antigen-presenting cells. The results suggest that
activated DCs from tumor bearing mice at ST are less able to stimulate T cell proliferation than
are DCs from tumor-bearing mice at TT [47]. Together, these studies from our group show that
the balance of pro-tumorigenic cells (Tregs, MDSC) and antitumorigenic cells (CD8+ CTLs) is
different at ST and TT, while antigen presentation may be suppressed at ST leading to reduced
immune surveillance.
While the above discussion deals with immune responses in cancer, it is important to consider
that the degree of autoimmunity is also likely to be influenced by housing temperature. We would
predict, for example, that autoimmunity, which is often expected following immunotherapy for
cancer, may be enhanced at TT but suppressed in mouse models at ST.
Being Too Cold Can Be Helpful in Diseases in Which Immunosuppression Is
Desired
While there is a need to stimulate antitumor immunity for control of tumor growth, in other
diseases, such as in graft versus host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic cell
transplantation, suppression of the immune response is beneficial. There is a significant research
effort to develop treatments for GVHD using mouse models. However, it has been known for
decades that the transplantation of T cells derived from murine bone marrow alone is not
sufficient to develop the severity of GVHD seen in patients. To achieve that degree of GVHD,
researchers must also transplant additional T cells (from spleen or lymph nodes). This suggests
differences in the mechanisms of GVHD between the mouse model and human patients.
However, our group has recently published [48] that severe GVHD does develop from transplant
of bone marrow alone (i.e., without additional T cells) if mice are housed at TT instead of ST or if
mice at ST are treated with a b2-AR receptor antagonist. Furthermore, administering a b2-AR
agonist to mice at TT suppresses development of GVHD. These results suggest that elevated
NE levels at ST interfere with obtaining a full understanding of the GVHD phenotype in this mouse
model, and again demonstrate that immunological responses are generally impaired in mice
housed at ST. Further research will be necessary to determine how reducing GVHD through
stress signaling could impact possible tumor recurrence in this model.

 Can Mild Cold Stress Alter Apoptosis Signaling and Chemotherapeutic
Efficacy?
With regard to mild cold stress (and resultant adrenergic signaling in tumor cells), Eng et al. [44]
found that the level of NE in pancreatic tumors of mice at ST was significantly higher than
in tumors of mice at TT. This increased adrenergic signaling induced increased expression of
anti-apoptotic molecules, including Bcl-Xl, Bxl-2, and Mcl-1, as well as phosphorylated BAD, at
ST compared to TT. These changes were recapitulated by treatment of cell lines in vitro with a b-
AR agonist, thus confirming a direct effect of adrenergic signaling on tumor cells themselves. The
tumor-promoting effect of adrenergic signaling has been reviewed recently [49,50], but the ability
of ST to cause this degree of stress is generally unrecognized. Moreover, tumors in mice housed
at TT were significantly more sensitive to Apo2L/TRAIL, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane)
than were tumors in mice at ST. Treating tumor-bearing mice housed at ST with propranolol
decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules and sensitized tumors to therapy to the
same degree as TT housing. Thus, the ‘mild’ cold stress of standard housing induces a type of
environmentally mediated therapeutic resistance similar to sources discussed by others [51].
Along this line, it is relevant that Pasquier and colleagues [52,53] have also recently reported that
relieving adrenergic stress in mice at ST improves the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy,
although they did not also conduct experiments at TT. Overall, our data reveal that the elevated
NE caused by chronic stress at ST is sufficient to bias the outcomes of experimental therapeutics
testing. Because it is becoming clear that the long-term overall efficacy of chemotherapy [54–
56], radiation [57], and photodynamic therapy [58] involves the generation of an antitumor
immune response, investigators should be aware that, under standard conditions, these
responses could be very different at ST and TT.
Cancer, Inflammation, and Metabolic Disorders: Are Mouse Models Too
Cold?
In addition to antitumor immunity, cancer research has also pointed to a major role for
dysregulated inflammation and metabolism in promoting tumor growth. Nevertheless, are these
linkages being influenced by cold stress? A large body of literature links increased dietary fat
intake with obesity and cancer progression [59], but it is becoming clear that factors affecting
obesity are altered at ST. For example, a UCP-1 knockout mouse model showed deficits in cold-
induced non-shivering thermogenesis as expected, but failed to develop the expected obesity
phenotype [60,61]. Several groups have now shown that this unexpected lack of the predicted
phenotype was because the mice were housed at ST, and when these mice are housed at
TT (and are not burning energy through adaptive thermogenesis) they do become obese
[61–64]. This effect of ST on obesity has been observed in other models as well [65–67],
and it is clear that precise data on the linkage between diet, obesity, and cancer should be
re-examined in the context of absence of cold stress. Interestingly, Koizumi and colleagues
showed that the reported ability of dietary restriction to reduce the incidence of lymphoma in
mice only occurred at ST, and that this effect was lost in mice housed at TT [68], again
demonstrating a dichotomy of experimental results at ST versus TT.
Other recent literature demonstrates the links between inflammation and cancer progression
[69]. However, the development of inflammation is found to be highly sensitive to cold stress in
mice, and exclusively using cold-stressed mice for this research may provide an incomplete
picture of these linkages. For example, Tian et al. [70] found that, when mice were housed at TT
instead of ST, metabolic inflammation was exacerbated, and they found increased inflammation
in white adipose tissue and vasculature at TT, which promoted atherosclerosis. These authors
conclude that their results ‘point to how thermal stress might limit our ability to faithfully model
human diseases in mice’ [70]. In an accompanying commentary, Ravussin reinforces the point
that ‘ambient temperature clearly affects phenotypes related to energy homeostasis in rodents’
[71]. Interestingly, in addition to being the stress hormone which drives thermogenesis, NE is
170 
Trends in Cancer, April 2016, Vol. 2, No. 4
 also known to inhibit insulin secretion from the pancreatic islets [72] and, notably, Uchida
et al. [46] found that mice housed at 20 8C had elevated plasma NE in comparison to mice
held at 25 8C. These authors also found that a cooler temperature resulted in lower insulin
and higher glucose levels and an impaired response in a glucose tolerance test. While 25 8C
is still well below thermoneutrality, these data are very important because 20 and 25 8C are
both within allowable ambient temperatures as stated by the NRCC Guide [23], highlighting
the possibility of significant data variability between laboratories which are following the
current guidelines.
Other aspects of insulin resistance and inflammation may need to be reexamined: while Tian
et al. [70] found increased inflammation in mice at TT, which was associated with promoting
atherosclerosis, they did not see an expected further increase in insulin resistance. Together,
these data support the opinion that basic assumptions related to obesity, inflammation, and
other metabolic disorders and their impact on cancer may differ when mice are housed at TT.
Elenkov et al. [73,74] reported that stress hormones induce a shift in pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines to support a Th2 humoral response and suppress the Th1 cellular response. In mice, it
was recently shown that chronic exposure to a stressful sound raised levels of stress hormones
(corticosterone and NE) and altered levels of key cytokines, reflecting a shift from a Th1 to a Th2
response, and promoted colon cancer progression [75]. The integral role of inflammation
(including inflammatory immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines) in promoting all stages of
cancer development and growth is widely recognized and has been recently reviewed [76–78].
In view of the fact that we found significant differences in the immune contexture of tumor-
bearing mice at ST and TT, further investigation into how ambient temperature may affect
immune cell and cytokine/chemokine networks (profiles) is warranted. At least two studies have
reported differences in the induction of cytokines in response to immune challenge [66,79].
Intriguingly, Straub et al. [45] outline the possible relationships between chronic inflammatory
diseases (which demand that increased energy resources are shifted to the immune response)
and many metabolic abnormalities. We can only imagine how these relationships could be
exacerbated under conditions of competition for energy when mice are chronically cold
stressed.
Concluding Remarks
The outcomes of preclinical mouse studies form the basis for understanding disease biology,
immune and therapeutic responses, and determining which therapies to take into clinical trials
[80–83]. Many authors have asserted that a major problem in research is irreproducibility
[80,81,84,85]. Landis and colleagues point to the general dearth of information on the ‘design,
conduct and analysis of the experiments’ [86]. These authors suggest that ‘a core set of research
parameters must be defined and should be addressed when reporting the results of animal
experiments’ and stated that a ‘concerted effort by all stakeholders, including funding agencies
and journals, will be necessary to disseminate and implement best reporting practices throughout
the research community.’ This viewpoint is echoed in a recent editorial by the editors of Nature
Neurobiology who wrote: ‘Factors such as animal housing, handling, food, lighting and noise
conditions, all of which effect behavior and brain chemistry, can be varied. The key to reproducibility
is accurate reporting of these seemingly mundane details, which potentially have large effects’ [87].
Although housing temperature was not included as a factor in these analyses, studies are
accumulating in which experimental outcomes differ depending on the ambient temperature;
these are summarized in Figure 1 [7,10,11,19,27,28,40,42,44,46,48,63,66,67,70,79,84,88–94].
In fact, new National Institutes of Health (NIH) requirements regarding Rigor and Transparency in
Research specifically mention room temperature as a Relevant Biological Variable that may need to
be addressed when designing experiments with mice. Our opinion is that new research must
define the full implications of housing-induced thermal stress, not only in cancer research but in all

 biomedical applications, and how this condition may influence decisions for translation to the clinic
(see Outstanding Questions). It is likely that many, if not all, of the metabolic abnormalities noted
previously in mouse models stem largely from chronic mild cold stress and the increase in adaptive
thermogenesis. Given the great need to enhance the reliability of mouse models, we advocate
recognition of this potential problem and routine reporting of the ambient temperature at which
experiments are conducted. Given that the degree of cold stress experienced by mice can also be
affected by caging density and by the presence or absence of nesting materials, this information
should also be reported under housing conditions.
It would also be very beneficial if researchers could assess the degree of cold stress in their
models by measuring biomarkers, such as the level of stress hormones, especially NE, such that
differences in experimental outcome may be better quantified. Comparisons of BAT by MRI
could also prove to be a valuable and relevant biomarker of the degree of cold-stress in
experimental mice at different ambient temperatures [40].

Figure 1. Mouse Models Used To Study Human Diseases Are Influenced by Housing Temperature. Depicted
here is the wide variety of phenotypes that have been reported to differ when mice are housed under standard temperatures
(�22 8C) versus thermoneutral temperatures (�30 8C) (followed by references [7,10,12,27–29,37,40,42–44,46,47,63,66,
67,70,71,79,84,89,93,94]). Several other conditions or phenomena that are modeled in mice and are likely to be influenced
by housing temperature, but for which there is little or no published information are also listed (followed by ?). Abbreviations:
GEM, genetically engineered mice; HSP, heat shock proteins.

 In the long-term, addressing questions of how housing parameters influence the basic physiol-
ogy of mice used to model human disease will require involvement and financial support from
agencies such as the NIH, where funding is typically devoted to questions related to mechanism
of disease and therapeutic efficacy, and the FDA, where mice are used to validate and regulate
immunotherapies for cancer. Moreover, organizations such as the NRC and the AALAS
(American Association for Laboratory Animal Science), as well as AAALAC, which oversees
guidelines for animal research, must be involved in discussion with researchers in terms of
feasible strategies for testing whether key determinants of the immune system or metabolic
pathways are altered by housing guidelines.
Other challenges include determination of how experiments can be conducted which explore
the role of ambient temperature. In our experiments, we currently place cages within
incubators (Thermo Fisher Scientific) maintained at 228 or 30 8C [42,44,47,48]. We have
also used rooms with the temperature set at 228 or 30 8C, but working at 30oC is indeed
uncomfortable for the personnel. Nevertheless, research institutes should consider providing
some space for selected comparative experiments. Alternatively, providing additional nesting
material could also allow mice to construct a thermoneutral shelter for themselves which they
could freely access as desired [25,26] and avoid overheating which is a possibility when using
a constant thermoneutral temperature. However, there still could be considerable variability
between laboratories using a variety of different beddings. Another possibility is alternative
cage designs which allow mice to behaviorally thermoregulate, as developed by Gordon et al.
[29]. Ultimately, new designs in standard caging systems that can minimize thermal stress
may be needed.
In summary, we are not suggesting that there is a single housing temperature that will enable
mouse tumor models to most accurately mimic human physiology; instead we are suggesting
that conducting experiments only at ST, causing adrenergic stress (as evidenced by increased
NE levels), and/or diverting large amounts of fuel toward heat production, can bias experimental
outcomes. As evidenced by our finding that tumor-bearing mice prefer a much higher tempera-
ture (�37–38 8C) than normal mice (�30–32 8C) [42], the growth of tumors may create far
greater cold stress in tumor-bearing mice than experienced by tumor-free mice. Therefore, by
paying attention to the degree of cold stress, and by carrying out studies at ST and TT, we will
likely obtain a much more accurate picture of how the range of responses that can be obtained
correlates with stress levels. In regard to this point, Lutgendorf et al. found, in ovarian cancer
patients, that higher NE levels in the tumors correlated with more advanced disease and the
degree of social stress experienced by the patients [95]. Because patients are under varying
degrees of different stresses (physical, emotional, psychological), understanding the range of
outcomes that can be obtained in mouse models may allow us to better predict the range of
responses which will be seen in patients.
