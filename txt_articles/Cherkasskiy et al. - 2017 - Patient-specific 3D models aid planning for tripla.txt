Abstract
Purpose Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) can result in 
a complex three-dimensional (3D) deformity of the proximal 
femur. A three-plane proximal femoral osteotomy (TPFO) has 
been described to improve hip mechanics. The purpose of 
this study was to evaluate the benefits of using 3D print tech-
nology to aid in surgical planning.
Patients and Methods Fifteen children treated with TPFO for 
symptomatic proximal femoral deformity due to SCFE were 
included in this study. Ten patients were treated by a single 
surgeon with (model group, n = 5) or without (no-model 
group, n = 5) a 3D model for pre-operative planning, and 
compared with patients treated by two senior partners with-
out the use of a model (senior group, n = 5) to evaluate for 
a learning curve. Peri-operative data including patient body 
mass index (BMI), surgical time and fluoroscopy time were 
recorded.
Results Children in all three groups had similar BMIs at the 
time of the TPFO. Post-operative radiographic parameters 
were equally improved in all three groups. On average, sur-
gical time decreased by 45 minutes and 38 minutes, and 
fluoroscopy time decreased by 50% and 25%, in the model

Conclusions Patient-specific 3D models aid in surgical plan-
ning for complex 3D orthopaedic deformities by enabling 
practice of osteotomies. Results suggest that 3D models may 
decrease surgical time and fluoroscopy time while allowing 
for similar deformity correction. These models may be espe-
cially useful to overcome steep learning curves for complex 
procedures or in trainee education through mock surgical 
procedures.

Background
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is the most com-
mon hip disorder in adolescents aged nine to 16 years, 
with an annual incidence of 10.8 cases per 100 000 chil-
dren.1,2 In cases of moderate to severe SCFE, a triplane 
proximal femoral osteotomy (TPFO) may be performed to 
improve hip mechanics. A TPFO has been described to cor-
rect the extension, varus and external rotation deformities 
characteristic of SCFE with low rates of femoral head avas-
cular necrosis (AVN).3-9 A variety of other osteotomies have 
also been described to correct the deformity. Imhauser 
recommended a simple flexion osteotomy9 while Dunn 
recommended a basicervical closing wedge femoral neck 
osteotomy.3 Some authors have recommended internal 
rotation of the distal fragment, while others feel that this 
manoeuvre creates extra-articular greater trochanteric 
impingement against the pelvis.3,9-11 Regardless of the 
type of osteotomy used, deformity correction in SCFE can 
be complex due to the three-dimensional (3D) deformity 
present and the inability to visualise the epiphyseal-me-
taphyseal junction when a standard lateral approach to 
the femur is used.12

In recent years, advances and rapid growth in additive 
manufacturing methods and devices have allowed for 
clinical applications, including preparation and training 
for orthopaedic procedures. A number of studies have 
reported using patient-specific 3D printed models for sur-
gical planning, showing improved outcomes for patients 
with orthopaedic deformities.18-22 The use of a 3D model 
in preparation for corrective surgeries for congenital 
 
scoliosis decreased operation time in four out of five sur-
geries to correct congenital scoliosis.13 In a case study, a 
3D model of a pelvis with a large chondrosarcoma allowed 
for the creation of custom osteotomy guides which aided 
tumour resection with adequate margins.14 A randomised 
laboratory trial comparing traditional preparation with 3D 
model preparation for distal radius osteotomy found that 
model use resulted in shorter operations with more pre-
cise correction of ulnar variance and radial inclination.15
Currently, there are no studies known to the authors 
using 3D printed models for surgical planning of a 
TPFO. On the basis of these recent orthopaedic stud-
ies, we hypothesised that TPFO planned with the aid of 
patient-specific, plastic 3D printed models for mock- 
surgery practice would decrease surgery and fluoroscopy 
time without sacrificing radiographically assessed accu-
racy of the correction.
Patients and methods
Patient selection and image acquisition
Institutional Review Board approval was obtained prior to 
initiating this study. All patients were enrolled from a sin-
gle institution. To be included in this study, all patients 
required a diagnosis of a moderate or severe SCFE (defined 
by an epiphyseal-shaft angle (ESA) of more than 30°), a pre- 
operative CT scan of the pelvis and treatment by TPFO. Fif-
teen patients (seven male and eight female) with a median 
age of 13.5 years (11.0 to 17.6) were included in the study. 
The indications for a TPFO were hip pain and impinge-
ment due to either a healed or stable SCFE according to the 
Loder classification, with moderate to severe deformity at 
the proximal head neck junction as defined by an ESA of 
more than 30° and physical examination findings of at least 
30° of obligate external rotation and hip flexion limited to 
70° or less. All patients underwent a pre-operative pelvic CT 
scan (GE HiSpeed VCT, 64 slice; Piscataway, NJ USA) with a 
near-isotropic slice thickness of 0.625 mm, as is the stan-
dard procedure for all patients undergoing TPFO surgery.
Ten patients were prospectively enrolled in this study: 
five were enrolled prior to the acquisition of the 3D model 
printer and therefore did not have a printed model, the 
other five participants were enrolled after the acquisition 
of the 3D model printer and had 3D models made from 
their CT scans to assist planning for TPFO surgery. All ten 
patients were treated by the same surgeon. To evaluate 
for a learning curve effect, five additional patientsthat 
were treated by two senior surgeons were retrospectively 
included. These patients were chosen by evaluating the 
surgical database of two senior surgeons that perform 
TPFOs and including the five most recent patients that 
met our inclusion criteria. Age at TPFO, body mass index 
(BMI), surgical time (mins), intra-operative fluoroscopy 
(mins), estimated blood loss (EBL)16,17 (mL) and follow-up 
(mths) were calculated and recorded. EBL was calculated 
by multiplying the difference between pre-operative and 
post-operative haemoglobin by estimated blood volume 
and dividing that product by the average of pre-operative 
and post-operative haemoglobin.
Image processing
For the five patients who had 3D models created, their CT 
Image files were processed by segmentation, smoothing 
and conversion to stereolithography (STL) 3D printable 
format. For each patient’s CT scan, Digital Imaging and 
Communication in Medicine (DICOM) image stacks were 
processed using MIMICS v17.0 (Materialise, Leuven, Bel-
gium). Segmentation of the right and left proximal femurs 
was performed semi-automatically using thresholding 
and region-growing tools to isolate the proximal femur. 
Each femoral region was automatically smoothed (0.7 fac-
tor, five iterations) and then exported as 3D-printable STL 
files. The STL files were manually inspected using MeshLab 
v1.3.3 (Visual Computing Lab, ISTI-CNR) for noise speck-
les, which were removed. STL files were then optimised for 
3D printing using NetFabb Basic v5.2.1 (NetFabb GmbH, 
Lupburg, Germany) using the automated mesh repair 
function. The optimised mesh was then imported into 
MeshMixer v10.9.297 (Autodesk, San Rafael, CA, USA) 
to merge the femur STL with a standardised 3D model of 
a 35 × 75 × 75 mm rectangular prism stand to facilitate 
mounting of the femur in a vice for the mock surgery.
3D model printing
Each resulting STL file was printed with Acrylonitrile Buta-
diene Styrene (ABS) on a desktop fused deposition mod-
elling 3D printer (TAZ 4, Lulzbot, Loveland, CO, USA). 
Models were printed with a 20% honeycomb fill pattern 
with automatically generated supports. A pilot study was 
performed to select the most appropriate fill pattern and 
percentage, based on semi-quantitative evaluation of cut 
resistance similarity to bone by the lead surgeon when cut-
ting samples of varying fill parameters and percentages.
Mock surgery
Prior to the model group patient surgeries, a mock TPFO 
surgery was performed on the plastic 3D model by the 
lead surgeon, mimicking the tools and cut approaches

used during surgery. Models were mounted in a vice and 
cut using a System Seven Precision Saw (Stryker, Kalam-
azoo, MI, USA). Based on evaluating the CT image and 
using clinical judgment, a wedge of plastic ‘bone’ was 
removed from the intertrochanteric region to allow for 
flexion and valgus correction of the proximal femur. The 
3D model allowed the surgeon to visualise the head-
neck junction and optimise the proximal femoral physeal 
 
orientation to obtain the desired correction. If a prelimi-
nary cut or removal of ‘bone’ wedge was inadequate for 
the desired anatomical correction during the mock sur-
gery, additional cuts were made to achieve acceptable 
correction. The 3D model allowed 3D visualisation of the 
anatomical consequence of each cut and wedge removal. 
A Kirschner-wire was used to preserve the orientation of 
the femoral bone segments (Fig. 1). 
Radiographic evaluation
Data were collected from pre-operative and post-operative 
patient radiographs by two independent observers. The 
measurements made were the ESA on lateral radiographs, 
neck- shaft angle (NSA), articular surface to trochanter dis-
tance (ATD) and medial proximal femoral angle (MPFA). 
Together, these four measurements were used to quantify 
the slip deformity in the coronal and sagittal planes. The 
ESA measured on the frog-lateral radiograph is a direct 
measure of the posterior displacement of the epiphysis. 
Recently it has been suggested that any posterior displace-
ment is ‘pathologic’ and may be indicative of an asymp-
tomatic SCFE.18 The remaining three angles are measured 
in the coronal plane. The NSA is a measure of varus femoral 
neck deformity that can occur secondarily in SCFE patients 
due to the slipped epiphysis.19 Normal measurements in 
children are 120° to 130°, whereas in SCFE, the femur neck 
becomes more varus, decreasing NSA. The ATD is an indi-
rect measure of inferior displacement of the epiphysis.20 It 
assesses the distance between the tip of the greater tro-
chanter and the articular surface (normal around 2 cm). 
Finally, the MPFA is another  
indirect  
measure of inferior 
displacement of the epiphysis.21 It measures the angle 
between the tip of the trochanter and the centre of the 
femoral head, which should be 90° normally and becomes 
diminished when the epiphysis slips inferiorly.
Statistical analysis
Pre-operative and post-operative data were analysed 
separately, and also as patient-specific differences. The 
intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to eval-
uate intra-observer agreement among the authors that 
measured the radiographs. Due to the small sample size 
in each group, data were evaluated using non-parametric 
techniques. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to evaluate 
differences in the cohort. The Mann-Whitney test was used 
to evaluate differences among pairs in the cohort. The 
Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to evaluate pre-op-
erative to post-operative differences in radiographic mea-
sures. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS (v12, 
SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) with statistical significance 
threshold set to p < 0.05.
Results
Radiographic measurements were independently per-
formed by two observers (the lead author and an ortho-
paedic surgery resident) and found to be similar (ICC 
scores range 0.81 to 0.98). Patients in all three groups 
were similar with respect to pre-operative characteristics 
(Table 1). The only pre-operative radiographic deformity 
that was statistically different among the three groups was 
ATD (p = 0.04), with the no model group being signifi-
cantly lower than the senior group (p = 0.02). Follow-up 
varied among the three groups but was not found to be 
statistically significant (p = 0.23). The no-model group had 
a mean follow-up of 21 ± 10.8 months (10.3 to 32.1). The 
model group had a mean follow-up of 10.9 ± 4.8 months 
(4.3 to 17.9). The senior group had a mean follow-up of 
37.1 ± 32.9 months (3.2 to 87.8).
Decrease in both surgical time and fluoroscopy time 
were observed in the model group, but were not found 
to be significant. Surgical time was decreased on  
average

by 45 minutes in the model group compared with the 
no-model group, and 38 minutes compared with the 
senior group (p = 0.40). Fluoroscopy time decreased by 
50% and 25% in the model group compared with the 
no-model and senior groups, respectively (p = 0.30, 
Table 2).
Patients in all three groups were similar with respect to 
post-operative characteristics (Table 3). The entire cohort 
saw statistically significant post-operative changes in ESA 
(p = 0.001, Table 4).
None of the patients in this study developed avascular 
necrosis; however, the follow-up period is limited. None of 
the patients in the model group developed post-operative 
complications or required additional surgery. One patient 
in the senior group was diagnosed with significant genu 
valgum and required a distal medial femoral hemiepiphys-
iodesis 11.2 months post TPFO procedure. Two patients in 
the no-model group had post-operative complications that 
required additional surgery. One patient had a mal-posi-
tioned implant and had a revision procedure one day after 
initial TPFO. The other patient underwent revision surgery 
2.2 months following initial TPFO due to implant failure 
and went on to heal without further complication. 
Discussion
Pre-operative planning is critically important when per-
forming complex 3D corrections. Traditionally, surgical 
procedures have been planned using paper printed or 
traced radiographs and cut and paste methods to deter-
mine how the bone fragments would fit together. This is 
especially difficult in patients with SCFE as the relation-
ship between the femoral epiphysis and metaphysis is dis-
placed in all three dimensions (coronal, sagittal and axial), 
which cannot be appropriately represented on plain 
radiographs. Additionally, the magnitude of deformity in 
each plane varies between patients. The 3D print provides 
a unique opportunity to understand the deformity fully 
and to determine the patient-specific correction required 
to optimise hip mechanics. It is important to note that 
these improvements were achieved with relatively low 
3D printing costs, which included a desktop 3D printer 
(one-time cost of ~$2200) and plastic filament (~$10 per 
patient model). 
In the current study, we found that surgical time and 
fluoroscopy time for TPFO may be decreased by the use 
of patient-specific 3D models for mock surgery during

pre-operative planning. Although statistically insignifi-
cant, these reductions in surgical time and fluoroscopy 
time may be considered clinically significant. For  
example, 
an  
average decrease in operating room time of 45 min-
utes at our facility results in a saving of almost $2700 per 
case. Given the drawbacks of pelvic fluoroscopy radiation, 
decreased trends with the model group shown in this 
study may greatly impact patient outcomes. The primary 
advantage of the model and mock surgery exercise was 
that the surgeon could gain a 3D understanding of each 
patient’s specific proximal femoral deformity and deter-
mine the exact wedge of bone that would need to be 
removed from the intertrochanteric region to optimise the 
head-neck relationship and position of the proximal fem-
oral physis. This allowed the surgeon to complete more 
efficiently the osteotomy (Fig. 2). 
Similar post-operative radiographic outcomes in all 
three groups are an important finding. It may be that the 
sample size in each group was too small to detect a signifi-
cant difference/improvement; however, it may also be due 
to the limitations of the TPFO osteotomy. The actual defor-
mity created by a slipped femoral epiphysis occurs at the 
physis, however, the deformity correction of the TPFO is 
performed in the intertrochanteric region. While perform-
ing the osteotomy distal to the femoral neck is less risky to 
the tenuous blood supply from the epiphyseal retinacular 
vessels, there are limits to the amount of deformity correc-
tion that can be practically obtained.9 Also, this osteotomy 
creates a secondary ‘Z’-shaped deformity at the femoral 
neck-shaft junction to improve the position of the femoral 
epiphysis. More recently, the modified Dunn procedure 
has been described that allows for SCFE deformity cor-
rection through the epiphysis.10 However, considering the 
femoral head avascular necrosis rate after this procedure 
is reported at 25% to 30% in stable slips,11,22 we believe 
the TPFO osteotomy is a more prudent treatment for this 
patient population.
Since follow-up time is markedly different between the 
three groups, as expected based on the study design, the 
longer-term effect of model use remains to be established. 
There were 21 months of follow-up for the no-model 
group, 11 months for the model group and 37 months 
for the senior group. Comparing post-operative compli-
cations among the three groups, there was no AVN in 
any group, and no complications in the model group or 
the senior surgeon group. Two patients in the no-model 
group had complications that required surgical revision 
(one mal-positioned implant and one implant failure). 
These preliminary results suggest that 3D model use may 
decrease post-operative complications of TPFO, although 
further studies are needed to determine if this effect is sta-
tistically significant. These results may also be explained in 
part by a learning-curve effect, wherein the lead surgeon 
improved the surgical complication rate from 2/5 (no 
model) to match that of the senior surgeons when using 
3D models (0/5). Therefore, the use of a 3D model mock 
surgery may be especially useful for training purposes. 
The study had a number of limitations. The power 
of our statistical analysis was decreased because a small 
patient sample size was used (three groups of five patients 
each). This was primarily due to the low incidence of mod-
erate to severe stable SCFE at a single institution and likely 
influenced our ability to detect significant differences in 
surgical time (effect size = 0.13, power = 0.07) and fluo-
roscopy time (effect size = 0.17, power = 0.08). In the cur-
rent study, a single 3D model was used for each patient. 
Future studies may explore using multiple printed mod-
els to allow multiple mock surgeries to allow comparison 
of surgical corrections during planning. This study also 
did not examine reasons for shorter surgical times in the 
model group. We speculate that less time was spent in 
the operating room preparing for surgical cuts, as well as 
revising inadequate cuts.
As shown recently in other orthopaedic applications, 
3D printed models can be an invaluable surgical tool to 
treat complex 3D orthopaedic deformities and improve 
surgical outcomes of TPFO. Tangible full-sized 3D models 
of the proximal femur allow for better understanding and

visualisation of the unique 3D nature of SCFE and improve 
pre- 
operative planning, which may result in shorter 
 
surgeries, less fluoroscopy exposure and lower complica-
tion rate. 
Patient-specific 3D models that give the surgeon the 
opportunity to practice osteotomies before entering the 
operating room appear to be a valuable method for surgi-
cal planning prior to complex skeletal realignment proce-
dures. As an initial pilot (15 patients), this study illustrated 
that 3D models may decrease surgical time by approxi-
mately 45 minutes and cut fluoroscopy time in half while 
maintaining optimal surgical correction of the 3D SCFE 
deformity.
