A re-assessment of the safety of silver in
household water treatment: rapid
systematic review of mammalian in vivo
genotoxicity studies
Lorna Fewtrell1, Batsirai Majuru2 and Paul R. Hunter2*
Abstract
Background: Despite poor evidence of their effectiveness, colloidal silver and silver nanoparticles are increasingly
being promoted for treating potentially contaminated drinking water in low income countries. Recently, however,
concerns have been raised about the possible genotoxicity of particulate silver.
Objectives: The goal of this paper was to review the published mammalian in vivo genotoxicity studies using silver
micro and nanoparticles.
Methods: SCOPUS and Medline were searched using the following search string: (“DNA damage” OR genotox* OR
Cytotox* OR Embryotox*) AND (silver OR AgNP). Included papers were any mammalian in vivo experimental studies
investigating genotoxicity of silver particles. Studies were quality assessed using the ToxRTool.
Results: 16 relevant papers were identified. There were substantial variations in study design including the size of
silver particles, animal species, target organs, silver dose, route of administration and the method used to detect
genotoxicity. Thus, it was not possible to produce a definitive pooled result. Nevertheless, most studies showed
evidence of genotoxicity unless using very low doses. We also identified one human study reporting evidence of
“severe DNA damage” in silver jewellery workers occupationally exposed to silver particles.
Conclusions: With the available evidence it is not possible to be definitive about risks to human health from oral
exposure to silver particulates. However, the balance of evidence suggests that there should be concerns especially
when considering the evidence from jewellery workers. There is an urgent need to determine whether people
exposed to particulate silver as part of drinking water treatment have evidence of DNA damage.
Keywords: Silver, Nanoparticles, Genotoxicity, DNA damage
Background
Household point-of-use (POU) treatment is being widely
promoted as an interim measure to improve the quality
of drinking water in low income settings where con-
sumers do not have access to improved drinking water
supplies. There is a range of different technologies that
are being promoted by different agencies and non-
governmental organizations that can be broadly cate-
gorised as disinfection or filtration technologies [1, 2].
Within this diverse range of technologies colloidal silver
(Ag) is being promoted as a primary water disinfectant,
both silver nitrate (AgNO3) and silver nanoparticles
(AgNP) are being added to the surface of ceramics and
AgNP is being investigated as an adjunct to filtration
technologies in a wide number of experimental systems
[3–5]. Typically, nanoparticles are small particles with
one dimension being 100 nm or less. Colloidal Ag con-
sists of micro and nanoparticles of silver, typically in the
range of 2–500 nm, dispersed throughout another
substance [6].
Among those promoting the use of colloidal Ag or
AgNP there is the general assumption that this product
is safe in humans. The World Health Organization

 (WHO) Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality currently
do not have a guideline value for Ag in drinking water,
but indicate a concentration of 0.1 mg/L which could be
tolerated without risk to health [7]. However, this value
was determined as being unlikely to cause argyria (a dis-
colouring of the skin due to silver deposition) and took
no consideration of possible adverse effects associated
with
AgNP,
nor
did
it
consider
any
potential
genotoxicity.
Based on a study of a woman with argyria it was esti-
mated that following consumption of silver acetate, up
to 18% of the dose was absorbed [8]. From animal stud-
ies, AgNP adsorption is less than that for Ag salts, sug-
gesting a lower bioavailability for AgNP [6].
After absorption Ag and AgNP are widely distributed
through the body. Retention of Ag and AgNP varies be-
tween different organs, although retention in the brain
and testes seems to be particularly strong [9].
A review of the safety of Ag, colloidal Ag and AgNP
was published by Hadrup and Lam [6]. They reported
that a range of dose-dependent toxic effects have been
described in experimental animals including: “weight
loss, hypoactivity, altered neurotransmitter levels, altered
liver enzymes, altered blood values, enlarged hearts and
immunological effects”. However, most of these effects
were seen at doses well above levels likely to be con-
sumed in water, even with the use of Ag as a primary
water disinfectant. Nevertheless, they still recommended
a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) value of 2.5 μg/kg of body
weight/day.
An area of further interest is whether exposure to Ag
and AgNP is associated with genotoxic effects. Hadrup
and Lam concluded that Ag only has limited genotoxic
effects [6]. Their conclusions, however, were based on a
relatively small number of studies, two of which were
concerned with Ag halide salts and two with AgNP.
Neither of the two studies of Ag halides found evidence
of genotoxicity. Of the two studies with AgNPs one found
no micronucleus induction following 28 days of oral
60 nm silver nanoparticle administration [10]. The other
study reported micronucleus induction in the TK6 lym-
phoblastoid cell line of rats following incubation with 5 nm
silver nanoparticles at a concentration of 25 μg/mL [11].
In a substantially more detailed review of the geno-
toxicity of a wide range of nanoparticles, Magdolenova
and colleagues included 13 different Ag microparticles
and AgNP publications [12], of which one was an in vivo
study [10]. Of the in vitro studies detailed, 9 used human
cells or cell lines. A variety of Ag particle sizes (3 to
>200 nm), coatings (including none, starch, polysacchar-
ide and polyvinyl pyrrolidone), doses (0.01 μg/mL to
100 mg/mL), exposure periods and genotoxicity assay
methods were used in the identified studies. Every in
vitro mammalian cell-based study found AgNP to be
genotoxic. Although many of the studies tested only
relatively high concentrations of AgNP (up to 100 μg/
mL), some studies used much lower concentrations and
evidence of genotoxicity was found in human bronchial
epithelial cells using both the micronucleus and comet
assays at levels as low as 0.01 μg/mL [13].
Since the publication of these reviews, there has been
a substantial number of papers published investigating
the genotoxicity of silver AgNP in a wide variety of both
in vivo and in vitro models. While the general consensus
from the in vitro studies is that AgNP are genotoxic, the
most important evidence would come from the in vivo
studies. Thus, in order to investigate whether or not
AgNP and, therefore, colloidal silver are likely to be gen-
otoxic to humans and present a risk to health through
its use in household drinking water treatment, we con-
ducted a systematic review of in vivo mammalian studies
administering AgNP and Ag microparticles.
Methods
Searches were run in both SCOPUS and Medline using
the following search string: (“DNA damage” OR geno-
tox* OR Cytotox* OR Embryotox*) AND (silver OR
AgNP). Initial searches were run on 15 November 2015
and then again on 29 February 2016. Searches were run
without restrictions for date or language.
Inclusion criteria were any in vivo experimental
study investigating genotoxicity of silver particles in
mammalian models. In vitro studies in cell culture
were excluded as were any in vivo studies in non-
mammals
such
as
fish,
insects
or
helminths.
In
addition, we included any observational studies of
genotoxicity in humans exposed to silver particles.
Data were extracted from included papers into an
excel spreadsheet by one author and checked by an-
other. Data extracted included study identifier, year of
publication, description of silver nanoparticles, the
animal model used, the target organs, route of admin-
istration of nanoparticles, the study design, doses and
frequency of administration, the time to a sacrifice
after administration, method of detecting genotoxicity,
whether genotoxic effects were identified and a short
narrative
summary
of
the
study
conclusions.
The
basic outcome measure was whether or not genotoxic
effects had been identified.
The selected papers, which used either the comet
assay or the micronucleus assay (both of which have
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment [OECD] test guidelines) were subjected to a reli-
ability assessment using ToxRTool [14], which results in
each paper being scored out of 21 and the assignment of
one of four categories (based on a previous paper by
Klimisch and colleagues [15], namely:
Fewtrell et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:66 
Page 2 of 9
 1. Reliable without restrictions (score of 18 and above);
2. Reliable with restrictions (score of 13–17);
3. Not reliable (score of 12 and below);
4. Not assignable.
In order to be considered reliable (i.e. category 1 or 2)
the minimum score must be achieved and the report
must achieve all of the 8 ‘red’ (i.e. essential) criteria. The
results are shown as the overall category followed by the
score in brackets and, where applicable, the reason the
study was downgraded to not reliable.
Results
The initial search yielded 3191 references which were
scanned by title and abstract. Of these references, 163
papers were identified for further study (Fig. 1). We fi-
nally identified 16 papers that investigated in vivo geno-
toxicity
of
silver
nanoparticles,
though
one
paper
reported using both single and multiple dose study de-
signs and we have considered these separately; making
17 studies in total. Those studies (15) reporting use of
either the micronucleus assay or the comet assay are
outlined in Table 1. An additional two studies are de-
scribed in Table 2. The first paper identified was pub-
lished in 2008 and the second in 2009 and then no more
until 2011. There has been a substantial increased
interest in this topic with half of the papers (8 of 16) be-
ing published from 2014 onwards.
The included investigations showed substantial vari-
ation in study design including choice of the size of sil-
ver particles, animal species, target organs, silver dose,
route of administration and the method used to detect
genotoxicity.
The AgNP ranged in size from <10 nm (6 studies) up
to 200 nm (2 studies - microparticles), with 3 studies
testing different AgNP sizes. The majority of studies did
not explicitly state whether the AgNP used were naked
or capped. When stated, capping/stabilising agents in-
clude poly styrene-co-maleic anhydride and PVP. Seven
studies used rats and 10 mice. Target organs included
bone marrow (7), peripheral blood (4), spleen (2), testes
(2), lung (1), skeletal muscle (1) and kidney (1). In
addition, one study looked at the impact on the offspring
of pregnant test animals.
Of the 17 studies, 6 administered the doses by intra-
peritoneal injection, 4 by intravenous injection, 1 by in-
halation and 6 orally. Most studies (9) gave just a single
dose but the remaining 8 studies gave repeated doses of
AgNP. For the repeated dosing experiments the duration
and frequency varied substantially (Table 3). The doses
administered to the animals varied by as much as 5 logs,
ranging from 0.01 to 1000 mg/kg. The comet assay was

 used in 11 investigations, the micronucleus assay in 6, 2
used microscopy of cells in metaphase to look for
chromosomal abnormalities and 1 used the randomly
amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) test.
Of the 17 studies, 11 reported evidence of genotoxicity
(Tables 1 and 2). Table 1 outlines the studies using in
vivo micronucleus or comet assays, which are the basis
of the current OECD guidelines for in vivo genotoxicity
testing. Table 2 list the studies using other methods.
Where multiple cell/tissues were examined and some
were found not to show evidence of genotoxicity, we
have only referred to the significant findings in the
Table. Of the 6 studies that reported not finding evi-
dence of an in vivo genotoxic effect of AgNP, 2 were the
first such studies to be reported [10, 16]. Three of the
negative studies used lower concentrations (in a single
dose) than the most of the other studies (0.01, 0.025 and
0.05 mg/kg - [17]; 0.25 and 1 mg/kg - [18] and 1.5 mg/
kg - [16]). While Kim et al. suggested that their results
were not statistically significant they did observe a non-
significant trend in micronucleus formation in males
with increasing dose and an increased effect in females
at 2 of the 3 doses [10]. Consequently, mammalian in
vivo evidence of genotoxicity was reported in the major-
ity of studies, providing that a sufficient dose of AgNP
were administered.
DNA deletions and breakages were reported particu-
larly frequently across the studies, with the most worry-
ing being the detection of large DNA deletions in
developing embryos, albeit after a very large oral dose of
500 mg/kg daily for five days in pregnant mice [19]. In
addition, a significant risk of DNA damage in spermatozoa
was reported by Gromadzka-Ostrowska et al. further rais-
ing concerns about damage to future generations [20].
The selected papers were subjected to a reliability as-
sessment and, as can be seen from Table 1, only 2 studies
were classed as reliable (with or without restrictions). The
principal reason for the ‘not reliable’ classification was the
absence of a positive control, which is recommended for
both the in vivo mammalian alkaline comet assay and the
in vivo mammalian micronucleus test [21, 22]. If the fact
that (in the majority of cases) assays generally gave a posi-
tive result means that a positive control is not a require-
ment, then a further 7 studies can be classified as reliable.
The two remaining studies (Table 2) could not be rated
for quality as they had not used a method for which there
are internationally accepted guidelines.
One further paper is worthy of note because it is the
only study, so far, to have investigated the possible rela-
tionship between DNA damage in humans and silver ex-
posure [23]. These authors investigated evidence of
DNA damage in silver jewellery workers who are at risk
of inhalation of silver particles. The comet assay was
used to investigate DNA damage in mononuclear leuko-
cytes and showed a significant increase in DNA damage
in the jewellery workers compared to local controls.
While suggestive the findings of the study need to be
interpreted with care as there are a number of limita-
tions (including a small number of participants and a
lack of direct measurements or estimates of exposure).
We did not find any papers which suggested that in
vivo exposure to ionic silver posed a threat of genotoxi-
city, but those few studies that reported on ionic silver
found no effect even from in vitro studies [6].
Discussion
We have presented the first systematic review of in vivo
genotoxicity studies of AgNP in mammalian models.
The majority of the identified studies reported evidence
of genotoxicity and the negative studies were generally
those using single small doses. The potential genotoxic

 effect was supported by a single human observational
study, which reported evidence of the accumulation of
severe DNA damage in jewellery workers who were oc-
cupationally exposed to silver particles and AgNP.
While, as noted by the European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA) [24] the studies do not allow a definitive assess-
ment of human genotoxic hazard associated with oral
exposure to AgNP, we feel that the results are suggestive
that such a risk may exist.
In our review, we found substantial variation in study
design including choice of the size of silver particles, ani-
mal species, target organs, silver dose, route of adminis-
tration and the method used to detect genotoxicity.
There are also numerous different methodologies for the
synthesis of AgNP they can, for example, be produced in
a range of sizes and shapes and stabilised with a variety
of capping agents; these factors alone make generalisa-
tions difficult. In addition, some capping agents and
manufacturing contaminants may be toxic in their own
right [25], although this does not appear to have been
investigated in relation to genotoxic effects
The studies used a range of assay methods, not all of
which may comply with the current OECD recommen-
dations. While there has been some debate in the litera-
ture on the most appropriate methods for genotoxicity
testing of nanoparticles (e.g. Warheit and Donner [26]),
recent expert opinions have not suggested a move away
from existing protocols [21, 22].
A further complication in relation to applying the find-
ings to oral ingestion is the high proportion of studies
administering AgNP via injection (intravenous and intra-
peritoneal); given that Ag absorption is likely to be lower
following oral ingestion it would not be surprising if
studies using injected silver over-estimate risk from in-
gestion. It should be noted, however, that 5 of the 6
studies using oral administration showed statistically sig-
nificant genotoxic effects, and the one study reporting
negative results showed a non-significant increase in
DNA damage with increasing dose [10].
The comet assay is classed as an ‘indicator test’ be-
cause the measured end point may not always lead to a
mutation [27]; this raises the issue of whether or not
some of the DNA damage described in the reported
studies is likely to be reversible. In one study, with rela-
tively low exposure, the DNA damage did appear to be
reversible with time [17]. Clearly, DNA repair mecha-
nisms will reduce the genotoxic potential of AgNP.
However, it is not certain how effective these repair
mechanisms will be in those tissues such as the brain
and testes where bioaccumulation of AgNP has been re-
ported to occur. In addition, it is unlikely that “the large
DNA deletions” in developing embryos and “irreversible
chromosomal damage” in bone marrow described by
Kovvuru et al. [28] are transient (although the dose used
in this study was particularly high - 500 mg/kg for
5 days) and the finding of the “accumulation of severe
DNA damage” in people occupationally exposed to silver
particles certainly suggests that concerns about human
safety are real [23]. While it is not possible from this ob-
servational study to quantify exposure in the jewellery
workers, these findings would suggest that DNA repair
mechanisms can be overwhelmed with frequent expos-
ure to silver particles. It is certainly plausible that con-
sumers using colloidal Ag as the primary drinking water
disinfectant or workers adding AgNP to ceramic filters
in low income countries would have similar or even
greater exposure than the jewellery workers. The limited
available evidence indicates that health and safety pre-
cautions are not strictly adhered to in the production of
ceramic filters in low income countries [29].
The wide heterogeneity in study designs makes it diffi-
cult to draw substantial conclusions and, especially, to de-
termine a safe daily exposure to AgNP. Without being
able to state a safe exposure limit, it is not possible to say
if exposure to the colloid Ag or AgNP employed in some
current household water treatment practices poses a sig-
nificant risk to human health. However, given that the use
of AgNP and colloidal Ag in household water treatment
does not appear to be effective at making drinking water
safe [30], there is little value in their use and any risks of
genotoxicity are consequently intolerable. Given the likely
bioaccumulation especially in brain and testes, people
using colloidal Ag as a primary drinking water disinfectant
and their offspring may be at high risk of genetic damage.
The risks associated with use of AgNP in other matrices,
such as ceramic filters, are less clear. There is substantial
evidence that AgNP are released from many different sup-
porting matrices [31], but it is not yet possible to say with
certainty whether or not such release would be in suffi-
cient concentration to pose a health risk.
Conclusions
We consider that colloidal Ag should not be promoted as
a primary water treatment product as it has little public
health benefit and the balance of evidence would certainly
suggest that there is at least the possibility of genotoxic
and embryotoxic effects. With the current evidence it is
not yet possible to determine a safe limit for the oral in-
take of AgNP or colloidal Ag. Before colloidal Ag or AgNP
are used in filter matrices for drinking water treatment,
consideration needs to be given to how much silver is
likely to be released from the matrix during the life of the
filter (eg work by Garboś and colleagues) [32, 33]. There is
an urgent need for more research on this topic and par-
ticularly on whether people using colloidal Ag as a pri-
mary drinking water treatment, working with AgNP in
filter manufacture in low income countries or using such
impregnated filters have evidence of DNA damage.
