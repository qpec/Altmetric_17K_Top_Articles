Abstract: Food insecurity and hunger during childhood are associated with an array of developmental
problems in multiple domains, including impulse control problems and violence. Unfortunately,
extant research is based primarily on small convenience samples and an epidemiological assessment
of the hunger-violence link is lacking. The current study employed data from Wave 1 (2001–2002)
and Wave 2 (2004–2005) of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions
(NESARC). The NESARC is a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized U.S. residents
aged 18 years and older. Participants who experienced frequent hunger during childhood had
significantly greater impulsivity, worse self-control, and greater involvement in several forms of
interpersonal violence. These effects were stronger among whites, Hispanics, and males. The findings
support general theoretical models implicating impulse control problems as a key correlate of crime
and violence and add another facet to the importance of ameliorating food neglect in the United States.

1. Introduction
The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that more than 15 million children in the
United States reside in households facing challenges related to food security. Food security refers to
the consistent access to sufficient and adequate nutrition and the lack thereof—experiencing frequent
hunger—has manifold implications for healthy child and adult development [1–5]. Indeed, it is
well-documented that inadequate nutrition stemming from food insecurity is associated with outcomes
such as poor health, asthma and other chronic health conditions, and frequent hospitalizations as
well as challenges with respect to neuro-cognitive, academic, psycho-emotional, and social skills
development [6–14]. Fundamentally, a robust body of research suggests that hunger and inconsistent
access to nutritious food whether by purposeful neglect or not have important implications with
respect to healthy growth and human development.
Inadequate childhood nutrition can be the result of material deprivation that is part and parcel
of family-of-origin poverty, the result of parental neglect whereby the basic parent is unwilling or
unable to provide basic life necessities for the child, or a combination of both. A large literature
has shown that parenting deficits contribute to impulse-control deficits in children for a variety of
reasons [6,15–18]. Moreover, a recent study reported evidence that sleep deprivation was significantly
associated with childhood low self-control and indirectly related to delinquency via these same impulse
control mechanisms [19].

While much research has been conducted on the links between food insecurity and the
aforementioned health and developmental outcomes, fewer studies have examined the links between
childhood food neglect and interpersonal violence. We define food neglect as an adverse childhood
experience that occurs when a parent, caregiver, or other adult living in a home makes a child go
hungry or does not prepare regular meals. Childhood behavioral problems—often a precursor for
later antisocial behavior and violence—have been linked with nutritional inadequacies [20]. More
specifically, poor nutrition early in life has been linked to deficits in executive functioning such as
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and attentional problems [21,22] in childhood and
adolescence that are more likely to occur among males. For instance, Lukowski and colleagues [23]
found that infant iron deficiency was predictive of poor results during early adulthood with respect
to long-term planning and behavioral inhibition. Studies of inadequate nutrition and antisocial
behavior have found associations with aggressive and/or externalizing behaviors [5,24–28]. Finally, in
a randomized controlled trial of vitamin and mineral supplementation in 6–12 year olds who engaged
in disciplinary infractions (e.g., fighting, being disrespectful, vandalism, obscenities), Schoenthaler and
Bier [29] found that the supplemented treatment group had a 47% lower rate on average of antisocial
behavior than controls. Two other studies have also reported an association between exposure to
violence and food insecurity [30,31]. Nutrition clearly matters in relation to impulse control.
Healthy brain development is fueled not only by key micronutrients [3] but also adequate caloric
intake to provide energy. Areas of the brain involved with behavioral inhibition (i.e., frontal areas)
may be particularly sensitive to the effects of inadequate nutrition [21,22,26]. The brain consumes
a substantial proportion of the body’s calories (approximately 20%) and energy from glucose is critical
to its functioning [32]. One theoretical mechanism by which inadequate nutrition exerts its effects on
violence is by diminishing impulse-control. Several theoretical perspectives cite impulse control deficits
as a core etiology basis of antisocial behavior and criminal offending [33–39]. While these theories often
acknowledge early-life abuse and deprivation in the backgrounds of individuals with impulse control
deficits, they often do not explicitly acknowledge food insecurity, hunger, and nutritional deprivation.
Lack of food has been found to be related to poor glucose control [40]. Recent studies of the
self-control strength model build on this basic finding and have shown that the ability to maintain
impulse-control is dependent on energy derived from adequate levels of glucose [41–43] and that
low glucose levels are in turn associated with increased aggression [44]. Moreover, as DeWall and
colleagues [44] reported in a correlational cross national study, nations that have a higher prevalence of
individuals with interrupted glucose metabolism stemming from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
deficiency are involved in a greater degree of non-war violence. An alternative interpretation should
be acknowledged and this involves children who are exposed to stress or deficiencies in the rearing
environment (such as nutritious food) as they tend to also receive less cognitive and emotional
stimulation, which may result in reduced impulse regulation [45].
The Current Study
Although several studies point to a relationship between food neglect, inadequate nutrition
and poor outcomes, relatively few investigations have examined the relationship between food
neglect during childhood and later impulse control deficits and violence in adulthood. Meanwhile,
there have been a number of studies that have demonstrated the importance of energy in the
form of glucose in maintaining self-control strength in relation to aggression [2,44,46], though
recent and much publicized replication efforts have been disappointing. Further, as mentioned
previously, the food neglect-aggression link can also be due to the impact of the deficient rearing
environment [45]. The major weaknesses found in previous work are that most of these studies have
employed convenience samples or geographically circumscribed data sources that may lack adequate
generalizability. If going hungry leads to restricted caloric intake then there should be less energy
available to maintain impulse control. This may be especially problematic for males given the higher
probability of externalizing behavior compared to females [47]. The present study builds on and

extends prior research on food neglect, violence, and impulse-control by examining interpersonal
violence and impulse-control deficits among males and females who reported experiencing frequent
hunger in data derived from a population-based sample. An additional advantage of employing
a population-based sample is the available power and representativeness allows analyses to stratify
by both gender and racial and ethnicity permitting meaningful comparisons. We hypothesize that
childhood experiences of food neglect in the form of experiencing frequent hunger will be associated
with not only poor impulse control, but also a higher likelihood of violence even after controlling for
numerous sociodemographic and behavioral confounds. In addition, based on a higher prevalence of
externalizing found among males in general we hypothesize that effects will be stronger for males
than females. Our analyses comparing racial and ethnic differences are exploratory and descriptive
and thus no hypotheses are proffered.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants
Study findings are based on data from Wave 1 (2001–2002) and Wave 2 (2004–2005) of the National
Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). The NESARC is a nationally
representative sample of non-institutionalized U.S. residents aged 18 years and older. The survey
gathered data from individuals living in households and group settings such as shelters, college
dormitories, and group homes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The NESARC utilized
a multistage cluster sampling design, oversampling young adults, Hispanics, and African-Americans
to ensure appropriate representation of racial and ethnic subgroups and obtain reliable statistical
estimation in these subpopulations. The NESARC measures are not entirely consistent across the two
waves of data collection. As such, consistent with previous research using the NESARC [48,49], data
from Waves 1 and 2 were combined in order to assess the associations between a broader range of
constructs. The response rate for Wave 1 data was 81% and for Wave 2 was 87% with a cumulative
response rate of 70% for both waves and adjustments made for nonresponse [48].
Multistage cluster sampling design is a commonly used design when attempting to provide
nationally representative estimates. In the NESARC, a total of 709 primary sampling units (PSUs)
provided by the Census Supplementary Survey were selected (Stage One). Within the sample PSUs,
households were systematically selected (Stage Two). An individual age 18 or older was randomly
selected from each household. Data were weighted at the individual and household levels to adjust
for oversampling and non-response on demographic variables (i.e., age, race/ethnicity, sex, region,
and place of residence). The sample was slightly more female (52.1%) than male (47.9%) and the
mean age of the sample is 49.1 years (Standard Deviation = 17.3) with ages at Wave 2 ranging from
20 to 90. A majority of the sample reported having completed some college or more (58.5%) and
being currently married (63.8%), and roughly one in three respondents (29.3%) reported residing
in household earning $70,000 or more. A more comprehensive portrait of the sociodemographic
characteristics of study participants is available elsewhere [50,51]. Data were also adjusted to be
representative (based on region, age, race, and ethnicity) of the U.S. adult population as assessed
during the 2000 Census. NESARC is an extant data file that is considered restricted access. The study
team has met all institutional requirements with respect to human subjects. All subjects gave their
informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. The study was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee
of the United States National Institutes of Health. Given that the data is pre-collected and stripped
of all identifiers by NIAAA, the institutional review board (IRB) at the corresponding universities
deemed the use of the NESARC data for research purposes to be exempt from IRB review.

2.2. Diagnostic Assessment
Data were collected through face-to-face structured psychiatric interviews conducted by U.S.
Census workers trained by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and U.S. Census
Bureau. Interviewers administered the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview
Schedule—DSM-IV version (AUDADIS-IV), which provides diagnoses for mood, anxiety, personality,
and substance use disorders [52]. The AUDADIS IV demonstrates good-to-excellent reliability in
assessing alcohol and drug use in the general population [53,54]. Specific disorders included major
depression, dysthymia, and bipolar disorder, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic
disorder, specific phobia, and psychotic disorder. In addition to the assessment of psychiatric disorders
a host of sociodemographic and background characteristics were also collected in these interviews.
These included age, gender, race and ethnicity, income, education, marital status, and region of the
country. The response rate for Wave 1 data was 81% and for Wave 2 was 87% with a cumulative
response rate of 70% for both waves.
2.3. Measures
2.3.1. Food Neglect/Frequent Hunger
Respondents were asked: “How often did a parent or other adult living in your home make you
go hungry or not prepare you regular meals?” This variable was dichotomized to facilitate a clear
distinction between the presence and absence of consistent or frequent exposure to childhood hunger.
Individuals reporting having experienced hunger “fairly often” or “often” were coded as 1 and all
other individuals (i.e., those reporting having “never”, “almost never”, or “sometimes” experienced
hunger) were coded as 0. An alternative coding strategy would be to categorize individuals reporting
“sometimes” experiencing hunger with those reporting “fairly often” or “often” experiencing hunger;
however, we elected to prioritize recurrent experiences of hunger by drawing a sharp contrast between
individuals who reported experiencing frequent hunger versus all other individuals. While it is optimal
to measure hunger using multi-item measures, epidemiological studies have made use of similar
single-item measures [12,55]. Retrospective accounts of frequent hunger were measured during the
Wave 2 assessment only.
2.3.2. Interpersonal Violence
Four dichotomous (0 = no, 1 = yes) measures from the antisocial personality disorder module of the
Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule—DSM-IV version (AUDADIS-IV)
were used to examine violent behavior. While the AUDADIS-IV includes items measuring an array of
antisocial behaviors, we selected only items that explicitly measured intentional acts of interpersonal
violence. Data from Waves 1 and 2 were combined to measure respondent self-report of having
exhibited any of the behaviors in their lifetime. Items include: “In your entire life, did you ever
physically hurt another person in any way on purpose?”, “In your entire life, did you ever hit someone
so hard that you injured them or they had to see a doctor?”, “In your entire life, did you ever use
a weapon like a stick, knife, or gun in a fight?” and “In your entire life, did you ever physically hurt
another person in any way on purpose?” We also created a variable for “any violence” in which
individuals responding affirmatively to one or more violence measures were coded as 1 and those
reporting no involvement in violence were coded as 0.
2.3.3. Impulse-Control Deficits
Four dichotomous (0 = no, 1 = yes) variables related to impulse-control deficits as measured
in the borderline personality disorder module of the AUDADIS-IV were also utilized. Respondents
were asked to consider impulse-control in terms of long-term patterns of behavior (i.e., “Most of
the time throughout your life, regardless of the situation or whom you were with”). Items include:
“Have you often done things impulsively?”, “Have even little things made you angry or have you had
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 389
5 of 17
difficulty controlling your anger?”, “Have you often had temper outbursts or gotten so angry that
you lose control?”, and “Have you hit people or thrown things when you got angry?” We also created
a variable for “any self-control deficits” in which individuals responding affirmatively to one or more
of the impulse-control deficit measures were coded as one and all others coded as 0. Items related to
impulse-control deficits were measured during the Wave 2 assessment only.
2.3.4. Mental and Substance Use Disorders
In all multivariate analyses, we controlled for lifetime DSM-IV clinical, personality, and substance
use disorders on the basis of the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview
Schedule—DSM-IV version (AUDADIS-IV), which has been shown to have good-to-excellent reliability
in the diagnosis of mental disorders in the general population [48,53].
2.3.5. Sociodemographic Factors
The following sociodemographic variables were included as controls: age (18 to 34 years, 35 to
49 years, 50 to 64 years, 65 years and older), gender (male, female), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white, African-American, Hispanic, other (e.g., Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American/Alaska
Native), household income (less than $20,000; $20,000–$34,999; $35,000–$69,999; greater than
$70,000 per year), education level (less than high school, high school graduate only, attended some
college, completed associate’s, bachelor’s, or technical degree), region of the United States (Western,
Northeastern, Midwestern, or Southern United States), and urbanicity (rural, urban). Consistent
with prior research using the NESARC [44], we coded age and family income as categorical variables.
All sociodemographic variables were taken from the Wave 2 data in order to conduct analyses with
the most up-to-date information. We also controlled for self-reported parental history of antisocial
behaviors (i.e., “In your judgment, did your blood or natural father/mother have behavior problems
(cruelty to animals, impulsive or destructive behavior, violence and crime, etc.) at any time in
his/her life?” and drug abuse (i.e., “In your judgment, has your blood or natural mother/father
had problems with drugs at any time in his/her life?”), both of which were measured during the
Wave 1 assessment only.
2.4. Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out in multiple steps. First, logistic regression analyses were
conducted that compared individuals reporting frequent exposure to hunger during childhood with
individuals in the general population with respect to sociodemographic factors (Table 1) and violent
antisocial behavior (Table 2). Next, we examined the relationship between frequent hunger and
violence across gender (Table 3) and among non-Hispanic white, African-American, and Hispanic
respondents (Figure 1) using stratified logistic regression analysis. In keeping with previous research,
we examined the overlapping/no overlapping confidence intervals in order to test the differences in
the magnitude effects across gender and race/ethnicity [56] With categorical data, this approach is
preferable to more traditional (i.e., multiplicative) tests of moderation due to the potential for unequal
residual dispersion between groups [57]. Finally, we used logistic regression analysis to examine the
relationship between frequent hunger and variables related to long-term patterns of impulse-control
deficits (Table 4). Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were considered to be statistically significant if the
associated confidence intervals did not cross the 1.0 threshold. For all statistical analyses, weighted
prevalence estimates and standard errors were computed using Stata 13.1 SE software (StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX, USA) [58]. More information on NESARC waves 1 and 2 data can be found here

3. Results 
3.1. Characteristics of Individuals Reporting Frequent Exposure to Hunger 
Table 1 compares individuals reporting frequent exposure to hunger during childhood with 
individuals in the general population with respect to sociodemographic factors. Individuals 
reporting frequent hunger were significantly more likely to be under the age of 65, to reside in a 
household earning less than $70,000 per year, and to have earned less than a college degree. 
Individuals experiencing frequent hunger were also significantly less likely to be female (AOR = 
0.64, 95% CI = 0.58–0.72). Compared to non-Hispanic whites, individuals reporting frequent hunger 
were significantly less likely to be African-American (AOR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.62–0.84) and 
significantly more likely to be Hispanic (AOR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.12–1.54) or of “other” race/ethnicity 
(AOR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.68–2.24). 
3.2. Is Frequent Hunger During Childhood Associated with Interpersonal Violence? 
Table 2 compares individuals reporting frequent exposure to hunger during childhood with 
individuals in the general population with respect to aggressive behavior. Controlling for age, 
gender, race/ethnicity, household income, education level, region of the United States, urbanicity, 
antisocial parental history, and lifetime clinical, personality disorders, and alcohol and drug use 
disorders, individuals reporting frequent hunger during childhood were significantly more likely to 
report a lifetime history of interpersonal violence (AOR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.81–2.38). Significant 
associations were also found for all individual manifestations of interpersonal violence examined, 
including fight starting (AOR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.77–2.68), injuring another person so that they 
required medical attention (AOR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.85–2.64), use of a weapon in a fight (AOR = 2.34, 
95% CI = 1.90–2.88), and physically hurting another person on purpose (AOR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.79–
2.38) (see Appendix).

3.3. Does the Relationship Vary Across Gender and Race/Ethnicity?
Table 3 examines the link between frequent exposure to hunger during childhood and aggressive
behavior among men and women. Across gender, the link between frequent childhood hunger
and violence was significant in general and for each of the specific measures of interpersonal
violence. Notably, as evidenced by the non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals, the magnitude
of the relationship between frequent childhood hunger and involvement in any violent behavior
was greater among men (AOR = 2.73, 95% CI = 2.15–3.45) than among women (AOR = 1.63,
95% CI = 1.36–1.96).
Significant gender differences were also observed for fight starting (Male:
AOR = 3.07, 95% CI = 2.16–4.34; Female: AOR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.07–1.5), but not for the other specific
manifestations of interpersonal violence.
Figure 1 presents the prevalence estimates for involvement in aggressive behavior among
individuals reporting frequent exposure to hunger during childhood, by race/ethnicity. The raw
prevalence estimates for interpersonal violence are higher among those reporting frequently
experiencing childhood hunger as compared to those who did not often experience hunger early
on in life. However, controlling for sociodemographic, parental, and mental health confounds, we
found a significant association between experiences of hunger and interpersonal violence among
non-Hispanic whites (AOR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.86–2.82) and Hispanics (AOR = 2.57, 95% CI = 2.21–3.00),
but no significant association was identified for African-Americans (AOR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.53–1.06).
3.4. Is There a Link Between Frequent Hunger and Impulse-Control Deficits?
Table 4 examines the relationship between frequent hunger and variables related to long-term
patterns of impulse-control deficits. Controlling for the same array of sociodemographic, parental, and
psychiatric confounds, individuals reporting frequent hunger during childhood were significantly
more likely to report challenges related to impulse-control (AOR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.70–2.29). Specifically,
those experiencing frequent childhood hunger were significantly more likely to report having often
behave impulsively (AOR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.45–2.00), difficulty controlling anger (AOR = 1.19,
95% CI = 1.04–1.36), frequent temper outbursts (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.61–2.03), and violent behavior
when angry (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.39–1.98). We also conducted supplementary analyses to examine
potential gender and racial/ethnic differences in the relationship between hunger and impulse-control
deficits. The relationship was significant among both male (AOR = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.72–2.93) and female
(AOR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.56–2.00) respondents with overlapping confidence intervals pointing to no
significant gender difference. In terms of race/ethnicity, the link between hunger and impulse-control
deficits was significant for non-Hispanic white (AOR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.69–2.63) and Hispanic
(AOR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.48–1.92) but not African-American respondents.
We also conducted an exploratory analysis using structural equation modeling in which we
examined impulse-control deficits as a mediating factor between frequent hunger and interpersonal
violence (χ2 = 2395.77 (DF = 121)), RMSEA = 0.024 (90% CI = 0.023–0.025), CFI = 0.951, TLI = 0.934).
Controlling for sociodemographic, parental, and psychiatric factors, the results of our modeling suggest
that frequent hunger is associated with impulse-control deficits (Beta = 0.04, p < 0.001) which, in turn,
is associated with interpersonal violence (Beta = 0.25, p < 0.001). We also identified a direct path from
frequent hunger to interpersonal violence (Beta = 0.06, p < 0.001). We also ran the model without
the variable that referenced “hitting people” and found very similar results (Beta = 0.21, p < 0.001).
While suggestive, the results of the these exploratory analyses should be interpreted judiciously as
the cross-sectional nature of the NESARC data—and the measurement of key variables used in this
study (e.g., hunger, impulse-control, and interpersonal violence)—is such that mediation is difficult to
meaningfully examine.

4. Discussion
The importance of exercise and nutrition is a virtual truism in the physical, health, and social
sciences. Yet, much of this line of research has been concentrated in disciplinary silos. In this study, we
were concerned with the linkages between childhood food neglect, impulse control, and interpersonal
violence, thereby helping to bridge the gaps between research in the health sciences, psychology,
and criminology.
Prior research has suggested that impulse control is partly dependent on adequate levels of
glucose [41–44] and therefore experiencing frequent hunger makes it more difficult to maintain
impulse-control. In another conceptual model, children who are exposed inadequate nurturing
environments that may include food neglect incur less cognitive and emotional stimulation resulting
in impaired impulse regulation [45]. As Miller and colleagues’ state, “The model postulates that
childhood stress also shapes the functioning of the neural circuitry that underlies self-regulation of
appetitive behaviors. This shaping process gives rise to a phenotype that highly discounts the future,
behaves in an impulsive fashion, and readily seeks out appetitive stimuli. As a consequence, the
individual has a propensity for engaging in health-compromising behaviors, like smoking cigarettes,
eating high-fat foods, avoiding physical activity, and drinking excess alcohol” ([45], p. 980). Consistent
with these lines of theorizing, we found significant associations between frequent childhood hunger
and measures of impulse-control deficits. We also found that frequent experiences of hunger during
childhood are associated with the increased likelihood of involvement in an array of violent behaviors,
especially for males. Indeed the prevalence of lifetime involvement in interpersonal violence among
those reporting having frequently gone hungry (37%) was nearly twice that of those who reported
little-to-no experience of childhood hunger (15%). A similar pattern was observed not only for
interpersonal violence in general, but for specific manifestations of violence such as fight starting,
injuring someone in a violent altercation, the use of a weapon in a fight, and the purposeful injury
of another person. Notably, the link between childhood hunger and each of these manifestations of
interpersonal violence was found to be significant while controlling for a host of sociodemographic,
parental, and lifetime psychiatric and substance use disorder confounds. Findings suggest that the
consistent experience of hunger during childhood may place individuals at risk for impulsive behavior
as well as temper outbursts and difficulty refraining from violent behavior when angry, especially
among those with difficult temperaments [34,60–64]. This finding is also consistent with research
showing that hypoglycemia and reduced L-tryptophan concentration is associated with impulsive,
reactive aggression [29,65–69].
Beyond examining the main relationship between frequent hunger and interpersonal violence
among all study participants, we also examined the degree to which this relationship was moderated
by gender. Findings indicated that childhood hunger was significantly associated with increased
likelihood of interpersonal violence among both men and women; however, consistent with our
hypothesis the hunger-violence link was more pronounced among men than among women.
This pattern of effects was particularly evident in terms of frequent fight starting which, notably,
is the measure of violence that most clearly captures violent behavior in which the individual is the
aggressor and is not potentially responding in self-defense. Our results showed a clear distinction in
starting fights as evidenced by the non-overlapping confidence intervals among males and females.
Research has found that males are more likely to engage in physical altercations that escalate into
violence [47]. Cross, Copping, and Campbell [70] in their meta-analysis of 277 studies found that
women had better effortful control than men, which may serve to buffer them for escalating aggression.
Importantly one more possible health benefit for ameliorating food insecurity is the potential reduction
in male violence.
We also found evidence of a marked pattern of differences with respect to race/ethnicity that
are less obvious to interpret compared to male-female differences. Namely, childhood hunger was
significantly associated with the increased likelihood of interpersonal violence among non-Hispanic
white and Hispanic respondents, but no significant relationship was found among African-Americans.
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 389
12 of 17
One possibility is that this could be an artifact of survey sampling or that African-Americans are more
likely to report having access to calories and therefore not go hungry even if that food is high in fat and
lacks nutrient density. Research of racial and ethnic differences has found that African-Americans are
more likely to be obese compared to Whites and Hispanics [5,71]. There may also be socioeconomic
status and race/ethnicity confounding in that lower income persons in the sample uniformly were
more likely to report going hungry. Another corollary perspective is offered by Mischel [72] who has
found that under harsher social conditions one would expect actions based on satisfying immediate
survival needs thus resulting in delay of discounting and reduced impulse-control.
Over the past decade there has been an increased recognition that violence can be usefully
conceptualized as a public health issue. The consequences of hunger, whether by neglect or lack
of resources to obtain food, are widespread but one major implication of the present paper is that
ameliorating hunger can potentially reduce violence. As such, within the public health approach
to violence hunger is a candidate risk factor. Although poor impulse-control is a robust correlate of
crime, violence, and many other adverse outcomes [73], research suggests that energy from adequate
nutrition can help to maintain impulse-control. Thus, strategies that alleviate hunger and increase
food security in turn can help to deflect one of the proximal mechanisms for violence, namely poor
impulse-control. And while most evidence-based programs focusing on improving impulse-control
are focused primarily on parental (and to a lesser extent teacher) socialization efforts [74], it seems
that educating parents about more holistic socialization to include exercise and especially diet and
nutrition is relevant. Importantly, from a political perspective hunger reduction strategies are likely to
be supported from both the right and the left.
Taken into consideration with other recent studies regarding food scarcity, our results suggest that
social services and public health agencies should undertake efforts to minimize the adverse effects of
food scarcity and its by-product of poor nutrition. Our findings show that persons who do not have the
necessary quantity and quality of food face adverse effects that may reverberate adversely over the life
course. Our findings also suggest an expanding research agenda going forward. One study in particular
would examine what has been commonly referred to as food deserts—particularly in disadvantaged
communities in large urban cities [75]. The interaction between food deserts, poor glucose control, and
penultimately deficits in impulse-control and compromised educational opportunities suggests that
certain persons in certain locations may be at heightened risk for adverse consequences throughout the
life course. Identification of these risk factors and empirically assessing their effects is not only relevant
for theoretical and empirical work in this area, but can also help identify additional policy-relevant
proscriptions for certain communities.
Study Limitations
Study findings should be interpreted in light of several important limitations. First, the NESARC
is not a true longitudinal study and, as such, the temporal ordering of the measurement of frequent
exposure to childhood hunger and interpersonal violence is less than optimal. The use of a prospective
study design would be optimal in terms of assessing the longitudinal associations between the
experiences of hunger in childhood and violent behavior. Moreover, we necessarily relied upon
retrospective reports and for some study participants this stretched the recall period over several
decades. Further, there was no challenge test involving fasting and the administration of glucose or
other food to experimentally assess impulse control. Second, the measures of hunger and interpersonal
violence are derived exclusively from the self-report data. As such, it is possible that individuals may
have under or over reported to respect to the frequency of childhood hunger and the involvement in
various manifestations of violent behavior. Also, we relied on less robust single item indicators and
the wording of the hunger item perhaps suggested willful neglect rather than hunger due to poverty,
though poverty and neglect are often associated. Additional wording problems are found in the
relations between anger and impulse-control. For example, one of the impulse-control items included
the wording “gotten so angry that you lose control . . . ” introduces a tautological process in that anger
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 389
13 of 17
is associated with violence. It should also be noted that many statistical tests were conducted in this
study and, as such, there is the potential for Type I errors. Finally, the NESARC does not include
variables relating to precipitating, situational, or other biological factors that may help to explain the
relationship between hunger, self-control, and violence. Future research on the relationship between
the nutritional influences on impulse-control and violence would gain tremendous insight into the
incorporation of such factors into study designs.
5. Conclusions
The present study findings point to a link between frequent childhood hunger and involvement
in interpersonal violence.
Indeed, controlling for an array of sociodemographic, parental, and
psychiatric confounds, individuals who reported having frequently gone hungry during childhood
were significantly more likely to report having started a lot of fights, injured someone in a violent
altercation, use a weapon in a fight, or physically hurt another person on purpose. Notably, the links
between frequent hunger and interpersonal violence were significantly more robust among men than
women. Additionally, important differences were observed between racial/ethnic groups as robust
effects were observed for non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics, but no significant relationship was found
for African-American respondents. As hypothesized, we also found a significant link between frequent
childhood hunger and challenges related to impulse-control. This suggests that, consistent with prior
research and theorizing, the impact of hunger on neurocortical development and functioning may
have a hand in explaining the link between hunger and interpersonal violence. Finally, results further
suggest that violence can be potentially reduced by the public health strategies aimed at ameliorating
hunger, which in turn, appears to be a factor involved in the development of impulse control.

Appendix
As one might expect, the distribution of responses for the food deprivation variable is strongly
skewed with the overwhelming majority of respondents reporting having “never” (93.7%) or “almost
never” (3.47%) had the experience of being made to go hungry by a caretaker / not being prepared
regular meals. This alone seems to suggest that the coding of this independent variable should be
categorical. We did, however, spend substantial time debating whether or not those who “sometimes”
(1.75%) experienced food deprivation should be coded as 0 (i.e., with the “never” and “almost never”
respondents) or if they should be included with those reporting they “fairly often” (0.64%) or “very
often” (0.52%) experienced food neglect. In the end, we determined that conceptually it made more
sense to focus on those who experienced frequent food neglect (i.e., fairly often + very often) rather than
on distinguishing between those who experienced very little (i.e., never + almost never) and those who
experienced some or more than some food neglect (i.e., sometimes + fairly often + very often). We ran
additional analyses in which we examined the link between food neglect and the outcome variables
of interest. Specifically, we created variables in which those who reported “sometimes” experiencing
hunger were contrasted with those reporting having “never” or “almost never” experienced food
neglect (those who reported fairly or very often having experienced food neglect were excluded from
the analyses). Using this coding approach, we found that—controlling for the sociodemographic, family
history, and mental/substance use disorders—those who reported having “sometimes” experienced
food neglect were only slightly more likely to have enacted one or more types of violence (AOR = 1.20,
95% CI = 1.07–1.36) and impulse control deficits (AOR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01–1.24).
We used
the same approach in coding those who reported “fairly often” experiencing food neglect versus
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 389
14 of 17
those reporting “never”, “almost never”, or “sometimes” experiencing food neglect. We found that
fairly often experiencing food neglect was associated with increased odds of violence (AOR = 2.03,
95% CI = 1.64–2.51) and impulse-control deficits (AOR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.25–1.96). Finally, we did
the same for those reporting that they “very often” experienced food neglect and found significant
associations with violence (AOR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.70–2.60) and impulse-control deficits (AOR = 2.59,
95% CI = 2.21–3.03). Given the pronounced differences (please note the non-overlapping confidence
intervals in these contrasting coding schemes) we are confident in our approach as these analyses
provide support for our coding strategy (i.e., we found significant but substantively trivial findings for
“sometimes” experiencing food neglect).
