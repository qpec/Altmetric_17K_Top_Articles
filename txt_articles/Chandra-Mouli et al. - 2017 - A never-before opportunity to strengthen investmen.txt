Abstract
Background: Increasingly, the health and rights of adolescents are being recognized and prioritized on the global
agenda. This presents us with a “never-before” opportunity to address adolescent contraception. This is timely, as
there are enormous numbers of adolescents who are currently unable to obtain and use contraceptives. From
research evidence and programmatic experience, it is clear that we need to do things differently to meet their
needs/fulfil their rights.
Main body: In this commentary, we call for action in several key areas to address adolescents’ persistent inability to
obtain and use contraceptives. We must move away from one-size-fits-all approaches, from a ‘condoms-only’ mind
set, from separate services for adolescents, from ignoring the appeal of pharmacies and shops, and from one-off-
training to make health workers adolescent friendly. Our efforts to expand access to quality contraceptive services
to adolescents must be combined with efforts to build their desire and ability to use them, and to do so
consistently. In order for these changes to be made, action must be taken on several levels. This includes the
formulation of sound national policies and strategies, robust programme implementation with monitoring, regular
programmatic reviews, and implementation research. Further, high-quality collection, analysis, and dissemination of
data must underlie all of our efforts. As we move ahead, we must also recognize and draw lessons from positive
examples of large scale and sustained programmes in countries that have led the way in increasing contraceptive
use by adolescents.
Conclusion: This unprecedented moment in history gives us a real opportunity to bring about transformational
change, particularly when there is so much at stake.

 Background
In 2012, at the London Summit on Family Planning, rep-
resentatives of more than 20 countries, the research
community, the private sector, and multi−/bi-lateral or-
ganizations, donors, and foundations came together and
forged an agreement to provide modern contraception
to an additional 120 million girls and women in 69 of
the world’s poorest countries by 2020. Over four years
later, important progress has been made, as reported by
Family Planning 2020 (FP2020), the partnership estab-
lished following the London Summit.
This includes the finding that of the 300 million
women and girls using modern contraception in 2016
across the 69 FP2020 focus countries, more than 30 mil-
lion women and girls were added since 2012 [1]. How-
ever, there still remains a huge gap, especially in relation
to meeting the contraceptive needs of adolescents. A key
priority area in the upcoming 2017 Family Planning
Summit includes more focused attention to the family
planning and contraceptive needs of adolescents [2],
recognizing that progress in this group has been slow
and inconsistent. This presents a timely and much-
needed opportunity to prioritize the needs and rights
of adolescents.
What is this ‘never-before’ opportunity?
While the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
contributed to substantial progress in a number of areas,
they did not pay explicit attention to adolescents. One of
the key themes of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) is to leave no one behind. The SDGs recognize
adolescents (individuals aged 10–19 years) as a previ-
ously neglected group who must be addressed [3]. The
updated Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and
Adolescents’ Health also emphasizes the importance of
adolescents. As the former United Nations Secretary
General Ban Ki-moon said in his foreword to the docu-
ment, “The updated Global Strategy includes adolescents
because they are central to everything we want to
achieve, and to the overall success of the 2030 Agenda.
By helping adolescents realize their rights to health,
wellbeing, education and full and equal participation in
society, we are equipping them to attain their full
participation as adults.”1
The 2016 Lancet Commission report on adolescents
and wellbeing reiterates the triple dividend of invest-
ing in adolescents: for adolescents now, for their fu-
ture adult lives, and for their children [4]. It also
emphasizes that investment in their health will enable
adolescents
to
become
healthy
adults
who
are
equipped
to
contribute
positively
to
society.
The
Commission has recently presented modeling data
showing high benefits-to-cost ratios for investments
in adolescent health [5]. This is also reflected in the
priorities of donors, where mechanisms such as the
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria
and the Global Financing Facility are raising their in-
vestments in adolescent health. Clearly, we are at a
‘never-before’ moment for greater global and national
attention to adolescent health and development, as
noted in the recently published WHO guidance docu-
ment: “Global accelerated action for the health of ad-
olescents (AA-HA!)” [6].
One area that is in the spotlight is the need to improve
adolescent access to and use of contraception; FP2020
has now made adolescent contraception a key priority.
The partnership’s midpoint review, “Momentum at the
Midpoint,” emphasized accountability, partnerships, and
youth as key areas of focus in moving forward [1]. Spe-
cifically, the Midpoint report stated, “In order to meet
the diverse needs of youth and adolescents, countries
and stakeholders must examine their policies and
programmes, and develop a process of evaluation and
reevaluation that genuinely reflects a youth perspec-
tive, and implement evidence-based programmes that
work” [1].
This ‘never-before’ moment for action to increase ado-
lescent contraceptive use takes into account three crit-
ical factors.
� First, there is a growing recognition of the
widespread unmet contraceptive needs of sexually
active adolescents (both in and out of union), and
the enormous health, social, and economic
consequences of low levels of use. Millions of
adolescents who wish to postpone or space
childbearing are currently not using an effective
method of contraception. The Guttmacher Institute
estimates that 38 of the 252 million adolescent
women aged 15 to 19 living in developing regions
are sexually active, and do not wish to have a child
in the next two years [7]. Among these adolescents,
23 million have an unmet need for modern
contraception. This has enormous individual and
social repercussions. The data modeled by Darroch
et al. clearly underlines the potential demographic
and public health gains of ensuring access and
uptake of modern contraception by adolescents.
“Meeting the unmet need for modern contraception
of women aged 15-19 would reduce unintended
pregnancies among this group by 6 million annually.
That would mean averting 2.1 million unplanned
births, 3.2 million abortions and 5,600 maternal
deaths… The dramatic reduction in unintended
pregnancies would spare women and their families
the adverse consequences of early childbearing, reap
savings in maternal and child health care, and boost
women’s education and economic prospects” [7].

 � Secondly, there is a stronger awareness that simply
increasing the overall availability of contraception
does not necessarily result in increased uptake of
contraceptives by adolescents. Even where
contraceptive use increases, adolescent use does not
increase as much as among other age groups. Data
from Bangladesh and Egypt illustrate this. In
Bangladesh, adolescents aged 15 to 19 exhibit the
lowest contraception utilization rates compared to
older women [DHS, Bangladesh], while in Egypt, the
youngest adolescents, aged 15 to 19, have the lowest
levels of contraceptive use compared to older
women [DHS, Egypt]. Among married 15 to 19 year
olds in Egypt, 74% do not use any contraceptives
[DHS, Egypt].2
� Thirdly, even when adolescents do have access to
and begin using contraceptives, challenges still
persist, including higher rates of discontinuation
when compared to older women, with unmarried
adolescents exhibiting the highest levels of
discontinuation [8, 9].
In a recently published commentary on expanding
adolescents’ access to a full range of contraceptive
methods, including long-acting reversible contracep-
tives (LARCs), Fikree et al. summarize this never-
before opportunity: “There is now a global window of
opportunity for decisive, comprehensive, and collab-
orative action” [10].
Why are adolescents still unable to obtain and use
contraceptives?
In many places, laws and policies prevent provision of
contraception based on age or marital status. Further,
health workers do not provide contraceptives to adoles-
cents due to their own personal beliefs and biases (or
misinformation about laws and policies). Further, adoles-
cents may often be unaware of where (or when) contra-
ceptives are available, unable to afford them, or unable
to easily access a contraceptive service-delivery point.
Barriers such as inaccessible service locations and cost
impact everyone’s ability to obtain contraception. How-
ever, these barriers disproportionally affect adolescents,
as they often have limited ability to move around and
financial autonomy to pay for service fees and trans-
port. Even when adolescents are able to access con-
traceptives, they may be reluctant to admit that they
are sexually active or simply be embarrassed to ask
for contraception [11].
Focusing on access alone however, is simply not
enough. The data clearly reflect that even when adoles-
cents can obtain contraceptives, numerous factors pre-
vent their use/consistent use. Pressure to have children,
stigma surrounding non-marital sexual activity and/or
contraceptive use, and fear of side effects are a few of
the challenges hindering the uptake of contraceptives by
adolescents [11]. Even when used, they may be used in-
correctly [11]. In addition, discontinuation is a signifi-
cant
challenge
particularly
among
adolescents.
A
number of overlapping factors can contribute to discon-
tinuation, including side effects, hesitation to go back
and seek contraceptives because of negative first experi-
ences with health workers/health systems, changing re-
productive needs (such as a partner going away for
work), and changing reproductive intentions [9, 11].
An analysis of publically available data on contracep-
tive use by WHO clearly shows that contraception
utilization, specifically by married adolescents, is appal-
lingly low in many low and middle-income countries
(LMICs). For instance, in Nigeria, 97.9% of adolescents
in union aged 15 to 19 are not using any a method of
contraception [12].
There is increasing attention to adolescents living with
HIV, as illustrated in the WHO “Consolidated guideline
on sexual and reproductive health and rights of women
living with HIV” [13]. However, the contraceptive needs
of many other groups of adolescents, such as those who
are disabled and those in humanitarian crises are gener-
ally not acknowledged.
Barriers to contraceptive uptake vary by the situation
of each adolescent. Married adolescents may not want to
use contraceptives as they can face extreme pressure to
bear children once in union. Unmarried adolescents may
face significant stigma and judgment when seeking con-
traceptives. Both groups of adolescents, married and un-
married, may fundamentally not have the power to exert
agency over the choice and timing of contraceptives.
What do we need to do – or do differently – to increase
correct and consistent contraceptive use by adolescents?
Evidence from reviews and studies that fed into the
WHO Guidelines “Preventing Early Pregnancy and Poor
Reproductive Outcomes Among Adolescents” as well as
subsequent systematic reviews point to the factors that
contribute to improved contraceptive access to adoles-
cents [14–16]. For planning purposes, it is useful to
conceptualize these factors into those that are supply
and demand, as some frameworks have done [17, 18].
Demand-side objectives take into account the desire
and agency to use contraception, while supply-side ob-
jectives address adolescents’ access to quality contracep-
tive services when they need them (Table 1) [18]. The
International Center for Research on Women (ICRW)
framework lists three demand-side and two supply-side
objectives. The demand-side objectives include creating
the desire to avoid, delay, space or limit childbearing;
creating desire to use contraception; and building the
agency to use contraception (Table 1) [18]. The supply-
Chandra-Mouli et al. Reproductive Health  (2017) 14:85 
Page 3 of 13
 side objectives include increasing access to contraceptive
services and providing adolescent-friendly services. This
focus on both demand- and supply-side factors that are
more responsive to adolescents’ needs is consistent with
evidence from systematic reviews that show demand cre-
ation
activities
combined
with
direct
provision
of
methods have the potential of increasing contraceptive
uptake among adolescents, especially when implemented
with fidelity to what works [15, 16, 19–21].
The demand for and supply of contraceptives to ado-
lescents are also influenced by contextual factors that re-
quire appropriate programmatic responses (see Table 1).
For instance, in contexts where early childbearing within
or outside marriage/union is socially acceptable or en-
couraged, many-but not all-pregnancies are likely to be
intended and interventions that aim to increase contra-
ceptive knowledge and availability to prevent unintended
pregnancy would have little effect on their own [22]. Ra-
ther, initiatives that address systematic poverty and so-
cial
disadvantage,
including
gender
inequality,
can
improve girls' ability to negotiate their relationships,
contraception, and fertility decisions. This includes ini-
tiatives that seek to tackle child, early, and forced mar-
riage, which contributes to adolescent childbearing [22].
In contexts where there is enormous pressure to bear
children soon after marriage, key programmatic objec-
tives should be to delay first births through social norm
change and to provide contraception to (the minority
of) couples who want them, and support norm change
and support adolescent girls to space their subsequent
births.
Let us now examine what we need to do differently to
improve
access
to
and
provision
of
contraceptive
services to adolescents.
Firstly, we must move from a one-size-fits-all approach
to one that responds to the varying needs of different
groups of adolescents. Programmes have addressed ado-
lescents as a homogenous group. We must now under-
stand and respond to the differing needs of different
groups of adolescents, such as sexually active younger ad-
olescents (those below 15 years of age), those who in
union/in union including newlyweds, first-time parents,

Community-based outreach involving
provision of information and services
through the national Health Extension
Programme (HEP) led to remarkable
improvements in uptake of modern
contraception among adolescents in
Ethiopia [54]
Provision of adolescent-friendly
services
Lack of provider sensitivity, provider
reluctance to offer contraceptives
to adolescents/bias, gender biases,
lack of privacy/confidentiality,
contraceptives unavailable or out
of stock
Increase provision of high-
quality, youth-friendly services
for adolescents, tailored to
meet adolescents’ needs
Making services responsive to the
needs of adolescents has been
shown to improve contraceptive
use thereby preventing first
pregnancies in China and repeat
pregnancies in Kenya. [24, 66]

 and those living HIV. Deliberate, targeted approaches will
be needed to reach out to those adolescents such as those
who are physically or mentally disabled whose sexual and
reproductive needs are not acknowledged, leave alone
addressed.
Data from Tanzania and Nigeria clearly illustrate the
pressing need to reach adolescents who are married/in
union. In Tanzania, while 60.3% of unmarried sexually
active 15 to 19 year old adolescent girls are not using
contraceptives, 85.1% of those who are in union are not
doing so [12]. The figures from Nigeria are even more
striking. Here, 44.9% of unmarried, sexually active 15 to
19 year old adolescent girls are not using contraception,
while 97.9% of adolescents in union are not doing so
[12].
Secondly, we must expand the range of contraceptive
choices offered to adolescents from ‘condoms only’ to
the full range of methods. The only contraceptives that
most health workers advise adolescents to use are con-
doms – or occasionally pills – especially to unmarried
adolescents. This can be because they often believe that
long-acting hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine
devices hinder fertility and should be offered only after
the first child is born. We must change health workers’
beliefs, attitudes, and practices in this crucial area be-
cause there is no medical reason to deny adolescents any
method [23].
As shown in Kenya and Ethiopia, training and sup-
porting health workers and educating consumers can in-
crease both the provision and uptake in LARCs [24, 25].
In Ethiopia specifically, the Evidence to Action (E2A)
Project demonstrated that when health workers are
trained and supported to provide LARCs, adolescents
are more likely to utilize them [26].
Thirdly, we must move away from separate health ser-
vices for adolescents, and instead make existing health
services that already serve adolescents, to some extent,
more adolescent friendly e.g. antenatal clinics, postnatal
clinics, STI/HIV clinics, and as extensions to under-five
clinics. Using programming principles and practices that
we have learned e.g. providing non-judgmental care and
ensuring confidentiality are likely to make these services
responsive to adolescents’ needs and preferences. Mean-
ingfully engaging adolescents in designing and imple-
menting services is both a useful means to the end of
increasing uptake and an end in itself. Finally, given that
separate services have been shown to be difficult to scale
up and sustain in resource-constrained settings, focusing
on strengthening existing services is a pragmatic ap-
proach to reach large numbers of adolescents [27].
Community health outreach workers and volunteers
can also be mobilized to reach out to adolescents in the
community who may be unable or unwilling to seek
contraceptives
at
health
facilities.
For
example,
in
Madagascar, UNFPA and Marie Stopes implemented an
e-voucher programme to address the unmet need for
family planning among adolescents. As part of the
programme, young outreach workers disseminated infor-
mation, distributed e-vouchers, and
provided
clinic
referrals for a range of contraceptives including LARCs
[25]. Results from Madagascar indicate that this combin-
ation of strategies can promote a wider range of contra-
ceptive uptake.
Fourthly, we must work more actively with pharmacies
and shops to expand contraceptive access and uptake, as
our current focus on public health facilities alone does not
fully reflect where adolescents obtain their contraceptives.
Data from Tanzania and India illustrate the importance of
pharmacies and shops as sources of contraceptives to
adolescents. In Tanzania, many unmarried, sexually active
adolescents obtain contraception from a shop (44.6%) or
from friends (11.2%), and many adolescents who are
married/in union get it from a government facility (53.0%)
or a shop (31.8%) [12]. In India, most adolescents obtain
contraception from the private sector, with most unmar-
ried, sexually active adolescents obtaining contraceptives
from a private facility (46.0%) or a pharmacy (44.3%) and
married adolescents getting contraceptives from a phar-
macy (32.3%) or a shop (27.5%) [12]. Although Tanzania
has no legal or policy barriers that prevent unmarried ado-
lescents from obtaining contraceptives from government
facilities, as compared to India which does have such re-
strictions, both countries demonstrate high rates of phar-
macy utilization among both married and unmarried
adolescents. Pharmacies may offer adolescents greater con-
venience, longer operating hours, accessible locations, and
ease and speed of service including access to oral and emer-
gency
contraceptives
[28].
However,
the
information
provided/advice given may not always be accurate. The
preference for pharmacies is especially manifest in contexts
where obtaining contraceptives from government health
facilities may be difficult due to restrictive laws, health
worker bias, or because young women do not want their
partners/families to know. A recent study in Nepal showed
that emergency contraceptive pills were “popular among
young (less than 25 years old) and educated women” who
preferred to obtain them from private pharmacies [29].
Lastly, we must move from one-off in-service training for
a handful of providers to a package of actions to ensure that
all levels of health workers, including support staff, respond
to adolescent clients effectively and with sensitivity. One-off
training programmes, even if well conducted, have limited
and short-lived effects. A comprehensive package of actions
is needed: clear job descriptions grounded in quality stan-
dards (as proposed by WHO’s “Global standards for quality
health care services for adolescents” [30], good quality
competency-based pre and in-service training [31], desk
reference tools and job aids, supportive supervision, and
Chandra-Mouli et al. Reproductive Health  (2017) 14:85 
Page 5 of 13
 collaborative learning [32]. This point is reinforced in a re-
view by Dieleman et al. which ascertains the strength of
combined approaches. “Combined interventions of partici-
patory, interactive training, job aids, and strengthening
health systems can be successful in improving health
workers’ performance” [33].
Alongside our efforts to improve the quality and expand
the availability of contraceptive services, we must provide
adolescents with comprehensive sexuality education (CSE)
in an age and developmentally-appropriate manner. This is
because knowledge gaps and misconceptions on contracep-
tion both reduce uptake and increase discontinuation of
contraceptive use. This is clearly illustrated by WHO’s ana-
lysis of contraceptive use in a number of countries. For ex-
ample, in Ghana, 37.4% of unmarried, sexually active
adolescent girls and 20.5% of adolescent girls in union do
not use contraceptives due to fear of side effects or health
concerns. Similar patterns are reflected in Jordan (29.5%
married), the Philippines (26.5% married), Haiti (26.1% un-
married; 26.3% married), Tanzania (18.4% unmarried; 15.0%
married), Kenya (12.8% unmarried; 13.9% married), and
Liberia (19.1% unmarried; 7.5% married) [12]. While this
section addresses the provision of contraceptive informa-
tion and services, it is important to ensure strong linkages
to other sexual and reproductive health services including
antenatal, delivery and post natal care, safe abortion care,
STI and HIV/AIDS care, and to other health services e.g.
mental health.
Expanding access to quality contraceptive services to
adolescents with equity: What do we want to see in
countries?
i. Develop national laws and policies that require health
workers to provide contraceptive services to adolescents
without restrictions, and communicate them widely
National laws and policies vary a great deal in terms of
how enabling they are, as illustrated by a recent analysis by
the Population Reference Bureau (PRB) [34]. PRB analysed
country policies on family planning services using several in-
dicators. In relation to three criteria, external authorization,
age restrictions, and marital status restrictions, PRB found
that Tanzania, for instance, meets all three criteria, Nigeria
meets two criteria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) meets none of the three criteria. More specifically,
Tanzania’s policies do not require external authorization;
nor do they restrict provision by age or marital status.
Nigeria’s policies require external authorization, but do not
restrict provision by age or marital status, although these lat-
ter two policies contained “room for improvement,” accord-
ing to PRB. Finally, the policies of DRC require external
authorization and do restrict by age and marital status [34].
Strengths and weaknesses of national contraceptive
policies and strategies can be examined in more detail.
In one study analysing South Africa’s contraceptive
policies and strategies using the nine recommendations
in WHO’s guidelines on “Ensuring human rights in the
provision of contraceptive information and services” [35]
as an analytic lens, some gaps were identified in avail-
ability, informed decision-making, and adolescent en-
gagement in programme development [36]. However,
South Africa’s normative guidance as a whole contained
substantially more strengths than weaknesses. Similar
results are soon to be published in a study analysing
national contraception laws, policies, and regulations
from Paraguay. This analysis found that Paraguay’s nor-
mative guidance was grounded in human rights princi-
ples, but could be strengthened in relation to both the
quality of
contraceptive
provision
and
access
[37].
Analysing national level policies with credible bench-
marks can point to areas that need to be addressed to
make them more enabling. While the above discussion
focuses on access to contraceptive information and
services, the very same principles apply to other sexual
and reproductive health services such as safe abortion
and HIV testing and counselling.
ii. Design sound national adolescent sexual and
reproductive health (SRH) strategies that contain
evidence-based and context-specific packages of inter-
ventions, budgets to deliver the package, and indica-
tors to track progress that are disaggregated by age,
sex, and socio-economic status
Policies provide the basis for action, but action cannot be
achieved without sound national strategies to operationalize
them. National strategies must be based on the scale of the
problem and the factors that contribute to it. They must
choose interventions that address local determinants, are
feasible to implement, and have demonstrated effectiveness.
Alongside strategy development, indicators to assess inputs,
processes, and outputs must also be incorporated. In devel-
oping the Global Financing Facility investment case for
Liberia, a consultative approach involving government bod-
ies,
nongovernment
organizations
and
international
development partners was employed. The outputs of this
exercise are shown in Table 2.
iii. Implement strategies with fidelity and careful
monitoring, through functional systems and with the
participation of civil society groups (including
networks of youth organizations)
Enabling national policies that feed into sound strat-
egies for implementation and monitoring are important.
But the real barrier in many countries is the strategy
Chandra-Mouli et al. Reproductive Health  (2017) 14:85 
Page 6 of 13
 implementation gap. To ensure fidelity of implementa-
tion, it is essential to have functioning systems and tech-
nical expertise drawing upon a range of players. This is
powerfully reinforced by the Health Policy Plus project
in their analysis of family planning policies for young
people in Guatemala, Malawi, and Nepal, “All three
countries have largely recognized the problems facing
adolescent women and are trying to meet their family
planning needs. These countries have many of the
right policies already in place.” However, the study
found that in all three countries, despite the presence
of enabling policies, adolescents found it difficult to
obtain contraceptives. Thus, in line with the recom-
mendations of the authors of the report, while it is
important to add to or refine existing policies, what
matters most is how well countries implement avail-
able policies [38].
To ensure fidelity of implementation, it is essential to
put systems in place. Mozambique provides an excellent
example of a country which designed and implemented
systems to ensure the engagement with and coordination
among the Ministries of Health, Education, and Youth
and Sport at the national, provincial and district
levels [39]. The objectives of the programme – later
branded Geracao Biz (Busy Generation) – were: ‘To
improve Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health,
including a reduction in the incidence of early and
unintended
pregnancy,
Sexually
Transmitted
Infec-
tions and Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus infec-
tions, through activities that equip young people with
the knowledge, skills and services needed for positive
behaviour change.’ From the outset, Geracao Biz was
a truly multisectoral programme; government staff
from the three sectors worked with community-based
and youth-serving organizations, as well as young
people, to deliver three complementary interventions:
youth friendly clinical services, school-based educa-
tion,
and
community-based
outreach.

counselling and links to HIV-related care.
Wider environment
Social norms do not acknowledge
adolescent sexuality and are not
supportive of providing adolescents
with sexuality education and
contraception. There are few
educational and employment
opportunities especially for girls.
Traditions and economic constraints
pressure families to have their
daughters married early.

 coordination mechanism facilitated collaboration at all
levels of the system, with active involvement of young
people.
The Udaan project in Jharkhand state, India demon-
strated how civil society bodies with expertise in adoles-
cent health supported a government-led school-based
adolescent health education programme. The Centre for
Catalyzing Change (C3), an indigenous nongovernmen-
tal organization, worked with the government to develop
a curriculum, build and refresh teacher skills, and moni-
tor/evaluate the programme’s effects. It also supported
the government to build community support and deal
with resistance, when this arose.
Since 2006, 1485 secondary and senior secondary
schools including Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas
(KGBVs) across all districts in the state are being
reached. Emboldened by the success of the programme
in secondary and senior secondary government schools
of the state, the programme has been extended to
students in upper primary classes of over 100 selected
government middle schools of Ranchi, Ramgarh, and
Lohardaga districts as well as 203 KGBVs across the
state. C3’s central role in Udaan is key to successful
expansion and sustenance, when adolescent education
programmes in many other states of India have not been
able to run, or be implemented at scale [40].
One of the strengths of Udaan was the involvement of
civil society organizations; similarly, the involvement of
young people can also play a critical role in identifying
needs and problems, drawing attention to them and
helping find solutions. An example of this is the YP
Foundation’s work with young people in Sunder Nagar
Nursery, an urban slum community in New Delhi, India.
The Foundation supported young leaders in auditing
and mapping the safety of young people in the area
using electronic tools and methods tried and tested
internationally, and in engaging with the Delhi Police,
the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Delhi Gov-
ernment’s elected representative to share their findings
and to find solutions [41]. Indeed, the onus is on to find-
ing ways to engage adolescents meaningfully – with
‘voice,’ ‘minds and hands’ and ‘teeth.’ Firstly, it is essen-
tial that we hear adolescents’ ‘voices’ to understand their
needs and problems. Secondly, we must tap into their
‘minds and hands’ to help design, implement, and assess
policies, programmes, and projects that are intended to
meet their needs. Thirdly, we must put in place mecha-
nisms to enable adolescents to hold individuals and in-
stitutions
accountable
for
gaps
and
shortcomings-
‘teeth’. Adolescent ‘voice’ is important, but that alone is
not enough.
iv. Conduct periodic programme reviews to build on
strengths and address weaknesses
Periodic monitoring and evaluations of programme
implementation, and reviews of the findings to assess ac-
tual against proposed effects are critical to success. An
example of a successful national, multisectoral strategy
to
address
teen
pregnancy
that
utilized
consistent
programme reviews can be seen in the United Kingdom
Government’s
10-Year
Teenage
Pregnancy
Strategy
(TPS) for England from 1999 to 2010 [42]. The primary
goal was to reduce the under-18 birth rate by at least
50% from 1998 to 2010; by 2014, the rate had been low-
ered by 51% [42].
Many of the major strengths of England’s approach are
attributable to the rigorous collection and utilization of
data.
Data
and
qualitative
research
were
regularly
reviewed to identify potential risk factors for early preg-
nancy or poor outcomes for young parents and their
children. Summaries were provided to local areas to in-
form targeted work, and strategic actions were inte-
grated into relevant national government programmes
aimed at improving health and educational outcomes for
the most disadvantaged young people. Five years into
the implementation of the strategy, adolescent preg-
nancy rates had declined in some districts, but in others,
rates were stagnant or even increasing. The government
implemented a “deep dive” to examine why progress was
uneven, by matching three ‘highly-performing’ districts
with three demographically similar yet ‘poorly-perform-
ing’ districts. The review pointed to strong leadership
and the implementation of all elements of the recom-
mended package in the highly performing districts.
Based on these findings, the government put in place
more prescriptive guidance and conducted active, quar-
terly follow-up of less well-performing districts. These
efforts extended the declines in teen pregnancy to all of
the districts in the country and illustrate how national
authorities can use data to inform collective action at
the local level.
England’s midterm review contributed to change in
the direction of the programme by pointing to gaps and
areas of weakness. Similarly, a recent situation analysis
in Bangladesh found that many indigenous and inter-
national organizations were using approaches that were
out-dated and not always evidence-based. These efforts
failed to reach unmarried adolescents with services, and
were also isolated to certain geographic regions [43].
v. Research – with an emphasis on implementation
research - to answer context-specific programmatic
challenges
There is growing evidence on what works, and what
does not work, in responding to the needs and problems
of adolescents. However, ineffective interventions and
ineffective delivery mechanisms continue to be widely
Chandra-Mouli et al. Reproductive Health  (2017) 14:85 
Page 8 of 13
 implemented, resulting in several common scenarios:
adolescents are not reached by interventions; interven-
tions demonstrated to be effective are delivered ineffect-
ively;
interventions
are
delivered
piecemeal,
with
exclusively micro or macro engagement; interventions
are delivered in low “dosages” (short duration or inten-
sity); popular interventions that have been shown to be
ineffective for adolescents continue to be proposed [20].
This represents a waste of scarce human and financial
resources and raises questions about the value of ado-
lescent health policies and programmes.
While we must strive to apply what we already
know, we must work to fill gaps in our knowledge and
understanding [44]. This includes developing and test-
ing new interventions, and testing the scalability of
interventions, which have been shown to be efficacious
in research studies and tightly controlled projects.
Cost analysis and cost-effectiveness studies are also
urgently needed. Hindin et al. outline research prior-
ities for adolescent sexual and reproductive health in
LMICs [45]. Selected questions that relate to contra-
ception are listed in Table 3.
Research on the strengths and weaknesses of policies
and programmes can be useful in pointing to the reality
on the ground. For example, the Guttmacher Institute
has recently published assessments of the shortcomings
of CSE programmes in three countries [46–48]. We
need, however, to move beyond problem identification
to support robust implementation research to determine
the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of ap-
proaches to improve the quality and coverage of pro-
grammes, building on what exists. Using policy and
programmatic obstacles as starting points, implementa-
tion research employs methods to overcome identified
obstacles. For example, a paper by Vanwesenbeeck et al.
points to a number of programmatic challenges that
were
identified
in
the
implementation
of
a
CSE
programme, “The World Starts With Me,” in 11 low-
income countries in Africa and Asia. These include lack
of programme fidelity, inadequate teacher skills, and
contextual factors (school social climate, limited access
to youth-friendly services). The authors argue that fo-
cusing on these limiting factors, rather than on tweaking
the curriculum, has greater potential to increase the ef-
fectiveness of CSE programmes [49].
We need sound data to shape and reshape our efforts
Each of the stated priorities must be informed by data.
Specific data that must be collected include: rates and
outcomes of adolescent pregnancies; contraceptive use
and its determinants; policies and programme perform-
ance, and information on adolescent sexuality and its
context. WHO’s fact sheets on adolescent contraceptive
use in 58 LMICs contribute to this by providing compre-
hensive data on contraceptive use by marital status,
types of contraceptive methods used, why contraception
is not used, and where adolescents obtain contraception
[12]. However, as these fact sheets were generated from
Demographic and Health Surveys, they are not available
for every country, and some surveys have critical gaps in
data collection. For example, contraceptive usage data
are only available for married adolescents in many coun-
tries
with
large
adolescent
populations
including
Pakistan and Indonesia [12].
While the currently available survey data clearly dem-
onstrate the diversity of the adolescent populations,
there are limitations in how they can be used. National
level data represent averages and are not always applic-
able for local level programming. Also, the intervals be-
tween surveys mean that they cannot be used for most
programme monitoring purposes. Track20 has worked
to bridge the gap between surveys and programme data,
with promising results [50]. However, the applicability of
such efforts to adolescent populations depends on the
availability of disaggregated programme data, which is
currently weak, as few health information systems disag-
gregate contraceptive data by age.
Efforts to define global core indicators have been suc-
cessful in harmonising a set of measures to monitor
child and adolescent health [51, 52]. These efforts sup-
port global monitoring and coordination, but beyond
quantifying needs and problems in the form of adoles-
cent pregnancy rate or child marriage prevalence, give
little information on national efforts.
Seizing
the
current
opportunity,
national
efforts
scaling up adolescent family planning services will
have to be complemented with robust measurement
of
progress
on
all
levels
from
inputs
through
process, outputs, outcomes and health impact. As
discussed above, the evidence of interventions in the
adolescent population shows that interventions can
be effective in changing behaviours. However, the
same body of evidence also shows compellingly, that
despite using basic strategies with proven efficacy,
Table 3 Research priorities for contraception in adolescents
Assertion
• In settings with high rates of pregnancy in adolescence, what factors
protect adolescents from unwanted and/or unsafe pregnancy?
• What strategies can delay first births among married adolescents?
• What strategies can increase consistent and effective condom use
among both male and female adolescents?
• What barriers do health-care providers face when trying to offer
contraception services to unmarried adolescents?
• Through what mechanisms can the provision of regular and
emergency contraceptives to adolescents be financed or subsidized?

 many interventions are ineffective due to features in
design and implementation [15, 20]. Moving forward,
programmes have to be able to gather the needed
information to identify these issues, and the collected
data should then be aggregated, analysed and used
for decision-making.
Outstanding examples of countries moving ahead with
adolescent contraception
A small and growing number of countries are showing
impressive progress in expanding contraceptive use by
adolescents.
Ethiopia is one example of a country that has in-
creased contraceptive use among some groups of adoles-
cents, as part of a programme designed to reach the
population as a whole. Specifically, in 2003, Ethiopia
launched
a
national
Health
Extension
programme
(HEP), with the aim of achieving universal health cover-
age. Central to HEP are the Health Extension Workers
(HEWs). “Health Extension Workers are the key players
in the programme. They are all female, 10th grade high
school graduates, recruited from the community with
the active participation of the community. They are
trained for one full year and then deployed back into the
community to promote health and provide services at
the village level. Two HEWs are paired to serve 3,000 to
5,000 people and serve at a health post. Much of their
time is devoted to home visits and outreach. Over
35,000 HEWs are recruited, trained, and deployed to the
villages” [53].
From 2005 to 2011, modern family planning utilization
among married women – including married adolescent
women – increased from 10.9% to 23.4% [54]. According
to The World Bank report on HEP in Ethiopia, “…this
high uptake in family planning is due to the contribution
of the HEWs and the availability of contraceptives
through the HEP” [53]. This is particularly remarkable
given that married adolescents in rural areas tend to be
disproportionately disempowered and typically exhibit
the lowest rates of contraceptive usage.
While there were increases of contraceptive use in
Ethiopia, two other countries within sub-Saharan Africa,
Burkina Faso and Nigeria, demonstrated stagnation and de-
cline [54]. Hounton et al. summarize the relationships be-
tween the three countries, further underscoring Ethiopia’s
advances. “While there was no significant progress in Bur-
kina Faso and Nigeria, the data in Ethiopia point to a signifi-
cant and systematic reduction of inequalities. The narrowing
of the equity gap was most notable for childbearing adoles-
cents with no education or living in rural areas” [54].
These results were achieved through a range of ac-
tions, including supportive policies for contraceptive use
for adolescents regardless of marital status or age, re-
gional work plans and budgets, training of HEWs, and a
disaggregated health management information system.
Increasing adolescent contraception among married ad-
olescents was not Ethiopia’s only achievement. In recent
years, the country has also seen declines in child mar-
riage and female genital mutilation/cutting because of
progressive legislation and efforts by governmental,
international, and civil society organizations [55].
Estonia
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
successful
programme that was deliberately targeted at adolescents.
In the mid-1990s, Estonia scaled up grassroots SRH ser-
vices to a national youth clinic network and alongside
that, rolled out a widespread CSE programme in schools.
Over a period of 15 years, the abortion rate decreased by
61% and fertility rate by 59% amongst adolescents aged
15 to 19 years [56]. Coupled with CSE, a network of
adolescent friendly sexual health NGO clinics supported
by the government facilitated an environment of concur-
rent positive social change [57].
There were many social, political, and economic
changes in Estonia in the early 1990s that provided a fer-
tile ground for innovation and investment. Motivation to
address adolescent SRH was particularly high, given that
there were high unwanted pregnancy and abortion rates,
rising STI incidence, and low usage of reliable contra-
ceptives during this time period [57].
Although Estonia was committed to the scale-up, and
the environment within the country was ripe for change,
a critical factor that allowed for Estonia’s success was the
substantial assistance from international organizations
and neighbouring countries. International Planned Par-
enthood Federation European Network provided a plat-
form for Estonia and other Scandinavian countries to
collaborate and share resources and insights into best
practices and progress on SRH programmes.
A supportive social and political climate, demonstrated
need
for
adolescent
SRH
services,
a
national
organization representing the youth clinics, commitment
of personnel, acceptance by user organizations, and sus-
tainable funding through national health insurance are
all attributed to Estonia’s success [56].
Ethiopia and Estonia represent two different national
approaches to contraception – population-based and
targeted, respectively. Both of these approaches, alone or
in combination, may be applicable in other contexts.
Conclusion
We have a never-before opportunity to address adoles-
cent health. The work of FP2020 and the Family Plan-
ning Summit have placed adolescent contraception high
on the global agenda.
Our understanding of the complex web of factors that
help and hinder adolescent contraceptive uptake and use
has grown substantially since the International Confer-
ence on Population and Development pointed to this in
Chandra-Mouli et al. Reproductive Health  (2017) 14:85 
Page 10 of 13
 1994. Today, we have a much better sense of what needs
to be done to meet the needs of adolescents, and to en-
able them to realise their rights and exert agency over
their sexual and reproductive decisions.
Much of our evidence base comes from small-scale re-
search studies and projects. We have reached a limit of
what we can learn from them. The big questions now re-
volve around how to orchestrate and sustain large-scale
implementation, how to respond to the diverse needs of
different groups of adolescents, and how to involve ado-
lescents and young people in these processes. These
questions can only be resolved if we support countries
to scale up adolescent contraceptive information and
service provision with quality and equity, and learn
through this process.
Some countries, such as Ethiopia and Estonia, are
already moving forward. We need to recognize and cele-
brate their successes and share them widely. But the real
challenge facing us is to stimulate and support similar
progress in other countries across the world.
We are currently two years into the SDGs. If we are
unable to show that countries are beginning to make
progress in adolescent contraception in the next few
years, we run a real risk of losing the interest and sup-
port we currently enjoy. The focus of the global commu-
nity could well shift onto other pressing issues in the
health and development agenda. Most importantly, we
will fail to deliver on the promises we have made to
current and future generations of adolescents.
We know where to go, and have a clear idea of the
next steps. While we still have much to learn, we know
that
sustainable
implementation
of
large-scale
pro-
grammes requires courageous leadership, good science,
and strong management. We have never had a better op-
portunity to act than the one we have at hand.

1To monitor programmes, and especially their out-
comes and impact, the Global Strategy for Women’s,
Children’s and Adolescents’ Health has 60 indicators
that are either adolescent specific (e.g. adolescent mor-
tality rate) or include adolescents (e.g. experience of sex-
ual violence).
2Unmet need for family planning is a relatively com-
plex indicator as it requires simultaneously measuring
sexual activity, fertility preference and fertility as dis-
cussed by Cleland et al. [58]. The main concern in ado-
lescent populations is the measurement and definition of
sexual activity, especially in unmarried adolescents.
