Abstract
Background—The effect of physician diagnostic variability on accuracy at a population level 
depends on the prevalence of diagnoses.
Objective—To estimate how diagnostic variability affects accuracy from the perspective of a 
U.S. woman aged 50 to 59 years having a breast biopsy.
Design—Applied probability using Bayes theorem.
Setting—B-Path (Breast Pathology) Study comparing pathologists’ interpretations of a single 
biopsy slide versus a reference consensus interpretation from 3 experts.
Participants—115 practicing pathologists (6900 total interpretations from 240 distinct cases).
Measurements—A single representative slide from each of the 240 cases was used to estimate 
the proportion of biopsies with a diagnosis that would be verified if the same slide were 
interpreted by a reference group of 3 expert pathologists. Probabilities of confirmation (predictive 
values) were estimated using B-Path Study results and prevalence of biopsy diagnoses for women 
aged 50 to 59 years in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium.
Results—Overall, if 1 representative slide were used per case, 92.3% (95% CI, 91.4% to 93.1%) 
of breast biopsy diagnoses would be verified by reference consensus diagnoses, with 4.6% (CI, 
3.9% to 5.3%) overinterpreted and 3.2% (CI, 2.7% to 3.6%) underinterpreted. Verification of 
invasive breast cancer and benign without atypia diagnoses is highly probable; estimated 
predictive values were 97.7% (CI, 96.5% to 98.7%) and 97.1% (CI, 96.7% to 97.4%), respectively. 
Verification is less probable for atypia (53.6% overinterpreted and 8.6% underinterpreted) and 
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (18.5% overinterpreted and 11.8% underinterpreted).
Limitations—Estimates are based on a testing situation with 1 slide used per case and without 
access to second opinions. Population-adjusted estimates may differ for women from other age 
groups, unscreened women, or women in different practice settings.
Conclusion—This analysis, based on interpretation of a single breast biopsy slide per case, 
predicts a low likelihood that a diagnosis of atypia or DCIS would be verified by a reference 
consensus diagnosis. This diagnostic gray zone should be considered in clinical management 
decisions in patients with these diagnoses.

Results of the B-Path (Breast Pathology) Study, an evaluation of diagnostic agreement 
among pathologists interpreting breast biopsy specimens, indicated marked variability across 
diagnostic categories (1). The B-Path Study and others have reported high agreement for 
slides interpreted as invasive breast cancer or benign cases without atypia but much lower 
for those interpreted as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or atypia (1–3). These results raise 
concerns that interpretations of breast biopsy specimens in clinical practice may be 
inaccurate. For example, 1 of 4 breast biopsy assessments in the B-Path Study disagreed 
with the expert reference consensus diagnosis. This result was highlighted by the media,

 with such statements as, “A recent study showed that 25 percent of the time, pathologists 
disagree with one another in making a diagnosis of cancer” and “as many as one-in-four 
biopsies are incorrectly diagnosed” (4, 5).
It would be incorrect to infer that the B-Path Study's overall discordance rate of 25%, based 
on a test set with 1 slide per case, is an estimate of the expected accuracy of breast pathology 
in general clinical practice. The study included higher proportions of cases of DCIS and 
atypia than typically seen in clinical practice, and the overall discordance rate was not 
intended to reflect population impact. Applying the B-Path Study results to patient 
populations and communicating the results to patients requires additional analyses that 
account for population-based prevalence rates for breast biopsy outcomes.
The purpose of this analysis was to estimate the effect of variation in the interpretation of 
breast biopsy specimens from the perspective of a woman having a biopsy, using U.S. 
population–adjusted estimates derived from the B-Path Study. This approach provides more 
clinically relevant estimates of accuracy than previously reported unadjusted estimates.
Methods
Overview
We estimated the probability that a pathologist's interpretation of a single diagnostically 
representative breast biopsy slide would be confirmed by a consensus-based reference 
standard derived from 3 expert breast pathologists interpreting the same slide. For example, 
if a single slide from a woman's biopsy is interpreted as DCIS, how likely is she to obtain 
the same diagnosis if a panel of 3 expert pathologists provides a consensus interpretation of 
the same slide? We calculated the probabilities (predictive values) using Bayes theorem, 
combining results from the B-Path Study with published data of the prevalence of breast 
pathology diagnoses in women aged 50 to 59 years from the Breast Cancer Surveillance 
Consortium (BCSC) (6). The BCSC is a nationally representative registry of women having 
mammography in the United States.
The B-Path Study
The B-Path Study invited U.S. pathologists to interpret 1 of 4 test sets of 60 breast biopsy 
slides (240 total cases, with 1 slide per case). These included 72 benign cases without atypia 
(24 nonproliferative and 48 proliferative without atypia), 72 with atypia (for example, 
atypical ductal hyperplasia), 73 with DCIS, and 23 with invasive breast cancer. The 
proportional representation of these categories differed from population-based prevalence, 
where most cases are benign without atypia.
Sixty-five percent of invited pathologists who responded were eligible and consented to 
participate, and 115 completed the study, providing a total of 6900 individual case 
interpretations. Pathologists were blinded to the interpretations of other study pathologists. 
Their interpretations were compared with the reference consensus diagnoses, as defined by a 
panel of 3 experienced breast pathologists who are internationally recognized for research 
and continuing medical education on diagnostic breast pathology. The 3 panelists reviewed 
the cases independently and discussed discordant diagnoses by using a multihead

 microscope to evaluate the cases until a consensus diagnosis was established for each (7, 8). 
The reference panel members’ concordance with the final consensus diagnoses was 90%, 
whereas participants’ concordance with the same consensus diagnoses was 75%. Unanimous 
agreement among the 3 reference pathologists’ independent diagnoses was 75%, and the 
average level of unanimous agreement among all possible combinations of 3 participants 
was 58% (9).
Prevalence of Breast Pathology Diagnoses
Prevalence rates for each diagnostic category were based on BCSC data from women aged 
50 to 59 years who had recent screening mammography (25.1% for invasive breast cancer, 
6.1% for DCIS, 3.9% for atypia, and 64.9% for benign cases without atypia) (Appendix, 
available at www.annals.org) (6). Prevalence rates by diagnostic category within the B-Path 
test set and among U.S. women aged 50 to 59 years are shown in Figure 1.
Statistical Analysis
The predictive value of a given diagnosis is the probability that the diagnosis is correct. In 
this study, the diagnosis was based on a single slide interpreted by a participating 
pathologist, with the reference standard being the consensus diagnosis of the 3 expert 
pathologists interpreting the same slide. Predictive value estimates were based on results of 
the 115 pathologists’ interpretations of the test set cases and the prevalence of biopsy 
outcomes in the BCSC (6). Bayes theorem (10) was used to calculate the probability of 
obtaining a reference consensus diagnosis (“D”) given the case interpretation (“T”) by a 
single pathologist, as follows:
Prob[D] is the prevalence of interpretive category “D” (such as DCIS or atypia) among 
women who have biopsy. Prob[T|D] is the probability that a single slide interpreted by the 3 
experts as “D” will be interpreted by a single study pathologist as “T”. Prob[T] is equal to 
Sum (Prob[T|D] × Prob[D]), where “D” represents the reference interpretation and the sum 
is over all possible interpretive categories for “D”. An illustration of the calculation is 
provided in the Appendix. Because the predictive value is the probability that a diagnosis 
(“t”) will be confirmed by the reference consensus diagnosis, it is calculated as Prob(D=t|
T=t).
Probabilities of interpretations by pathologists relative to the reference consensus diagnosis 
(P[T|D]) were derived from the B-Path Study data and are described in Appendix Tables 1 
and 2 (available at www.annals.org). We previously published interpretation rates based on 4 
diagnostic categories and used 5 categories in this analysis to further adjust the benign 
without atypia category using its component outcomes (nonproliferative and proliferative 
without atypia) (1).
We defined overinterpretation as a diagnosis that was at a higher level of severity than the 
reference consensus diagnosis and underinterpretation as a diagnosis at a lower level of 
severity than the reference consensus diagnosis. Overinterpretation rates were 26% for 
Elmore et al.

 benign nonproliferative, 18% for proliferative without atypia, 17% for atypia, and 3% for 
DCIS. Underinterpretation rates were 8% for proliferative without atypia, 35% for atypia, 
13% for DCIS, and 4% for invasive breast cancer. Because the test set oversampled 
proliferative cases relative to nonproliferative cases in the benign without atypia category, 
we calculated the predictive values for 5 diagnostic categories and then collapsed the 
proliferative and nonproliferative categories into the benign without atypia interpretations. 
Bootstrapping of data from the B-Path Study was used to calculate CIs for the predictive 
values by resampling study pathologists randomly and with replacement. Our CIs do not 
account for sampling variability in the cases.

Results
When a single slide is used to represent the breast biopsy, population-adjusted predictive 
value estimates indicate that confirmation of pathologists’ interpretations by the expert 
reference consensus panel would occur in 92.3% (95% CI, 91.4% to 93.1%) of biopsies 
overall, with 4.6% (CI, 3.9% to 5.3%) overinterpreted and 3.2% (CI, 2.7% to 3.6%) 
underinterpreted. These estimates assume that the representative diagnostic features of the 
case are present on the slide examined and do not account for the effect of second opinions 
that might be obtained in clinical practice.
As noted in Figure 1, most women having breast biopsy in U.S. clinical practice receive a 
diagnosis of benign without atypia. For these women, our analysis indicated that diagnostic 
agreement with the reference panel would be high (97.1% [CI, 96.7% to 97.4%]) (Table 1 
and Figures 2 and 3). Only 2.1% (CI, 1.9% to 2.4%) of the biopsy slides would be 
interpreted at the higher diagnostic category of atypia by the reference consensus panel, with 
fewer than 1% interpreted as DCIS (0.6% [CI, 0.5% to 0.7%]) or invasive breast cancer 
(0.2% [CI, 0.0% to 0.4%]).
Most diagnoses of atypia on a single slide would be overinterpretations by the pathologist; 
the reference consensus panel would interpret 53.6% (CI, 47.9% to 58.3%) as benign 
without atypia and 8.6% (CI, 7.0% to 10.5%) as DCIS. The reference panel noted that these 
DCIS cases would likely be low-grade rather than high-grade DCIS.
For the cases interpreted as DCIS, the reference consensus panel would interpret 9.5% (CI, 
5.7% to 13.6%) as benign without atypia, 9.0% (CI, 7.8% to 10.2%) as atypia, and 11.8% 
(CI, 7.6% to 15.7%) as invasive breast cancer. The last estimate may have been influenced 
by the presence of 1 case of DCIS with focal microinvasion on the slide that was difficult to 
identify and was frequently diagnosed as DCIS by study pathologists. The reference panel 
noted that this microinvasive focus would not lead to a significant change in treatment or 
outcome.

 Finally, for women receiving a single-slide interpretation of invasive breast cancer, 
diagnostic agreement with the reference consensus panel would be 97.7% (CI, 96.5% to 
98.7%).
In practice, pathologists often obtain second opinions, and diagnoses that are on the 
borderline between 2 categories might be factored into treatment decisions. Therefore, 
diagnostic agreement with the reference consensus panel is shown by whether the 
pathologist noted that the case was or was not borderline and whether he or she desired a 
second opinion (Table 2). Diagnostic agreement with the reference consensus panel for 
atypia was less than 50% regardless of the pathologists’ desire for a second opinion or 
whether they noted that the case was borderline. When we restricted the analysis to slides for 
which pathologists did not consider the case borderline, probabilities of confirmation by the 
reference consensus panel were 36.8% for atypia and 76.3% for DCIS. When the 
pathologists did not want a second opinion on the slide, the probability of confirmation was 
78.1% for DCIS and 42.5% for atypia.
Discussion
The B-Path Study showed high diagnostic agreement between pathologists and a reference 
consensus panel of 3 expert breast pathologists for invasive breast cancer but substantially 
lower agreement for interpretations of DCIS and especially atypia (1). To extrapolate the B-
Path Study results to estimates more relevant to clinical practice, the current analysis 
included adjustments for prevalence of outcomes in a mammography screening population 
of women aged 50 to 59 years in the United States. Our results, based on the use of 1 slide 
per case, suggest that more than 92% of interpretations of breast biopsy specimens in this 
group of women would be likely to agree with the interpretations of the reference consensus 
panel. Actual accuracy may be higher due to the effects of obtaining second opinions and 
context (evaluating >1 slide or special stains).
Although the prevalence of atypia and DCIS diagnoses is low among the total breast 
biopsies performed each year, the markedly lower diagnostic agreement rates for these 
categories should not be overlooked or minimized. These noninvasive but potentially high-
risk breast lesions represent a gray area with subjective boundaries imposed on a biological 
continuum; there is not always a “right” or “wrong” diagnosis and, as in many areas of 
medicine, professional opinions may differ. For women having breast biopsy, our results 
suggest that nearly 1 in 5 (18.5%) with a diagnosis of DCIS would have her biopsy 
specimen interpreted as atypia or benign by our reference consensus panel (with the limiting 
assumptions that the diagnostic features are present on a single slide and no second opinions 
are obtained).
Overdiagnosis of DCIS has recently been discussed in the literature (11–14). The expressed 
concern is related to increased detection resulting from widespread use of screening 
mammography. Our results suggest that overinterpretation of the pathologic findings may 
contribute to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of DCIS. In current practice, most women 
diagnosed with DCIS are offered lumpectomy and radiation therapy or total mastectomy, 
and they may also be offered adjuvant hormonal therapy for 5 to 10 years to reduce

 recurrence risk. Most of the diagnostic variability in pathology is likely due to differentiating 
atypia from low-grade DCIS, a diagnostic challenge that may be due to imposing categorical 
diagnoses on a biological continuum of disease and may not necessarily reflect the accuracy 
of the pathologist.
We also estimated that slightly more than half of breast biopsies with diagnoses of atypia 
(53.6%) based on a single representative slide would be interpreted as benign cases without 
atypia by our reference panel. Although diagnostic variability for atypia and DCIS has been 
noted as a particular challenge for nearly 25 years (2, 3), our prevalence-adjusted estimates 
shed new light on potential diagnostic trends at a population level and suggest that higher 
levels of overinterpretation rather than underinterpretation may occur in practice. The 
population prevalence of atypia has been estimated to range between 3.9% and 10% of all 
breast biopsy interpretations in the United States (6, 15), which equates to a large number of 
women affected annually given the high number of breast biopsies performed each year. A 
diagnosis of atypia on a core biopsy has significant implications; atypical ductal hyperplasia 
has been associated with risk for concurrent and future cancer, and a diagnosis of atypia on a 
core biopsy is generally followed by an excision biopsy, placement in a high-risk screening 
group, and consideration for risk-reducing hormonal therapy. Thus, overdiagnosis of atypia 
may lead to unnecessary surgery, follow-up, and treatment (16, 17).
The practice of surgical pathology involves systematic sampling of tissue specimens; 
evaluation of multiple slides; and dynamic opportunities to evaluate additional tissue from 
paraffin blocks, obtain immunohistochemical or molecular markers, and consult colleagues 
on challenging cases. The B-Path Study did not evaluate the complete diagnostic pathway 
but focused on the pathologist first reviewing a case. Thus, the results help to define 
knowledge gaps on which systemic quality improvements can be built.
Studies of physician diagnostic concordance are challenging to design and implement; 
perfect simulation of the practice of medicine is rarely possible. The underlying data should 
be evaluated in context, and their limitations should be considered. In addition to having 
augmented test cases of atypia and DCIS, the B-Path Study provided data from a testing 
situation in which pathologists gave interpretations based on only 1 slide per case and were 
not given the opportunity to obtain additional clinical history, additional testing, or a second 
opinion from a colleague. However, even in clinical practice, a biopsy diagnosis and 
recommendation can hinge on a single focus on a single slide, and this was the premise 
presented to the participating pathologists: Assume that the most diagnostic area for the case 
is present on the test set slide.
In clinical practice, pathologists are able to obtain second opinions and indicate when they 
consider diagnoses to be borderline. Participants were asked to record whether a case was on 
the borderline between 2 diagnoses and to indicate whether they would obtain a second 
consultative opinion. These data provide additional insight into current practice and 
opportunities for diagnostic improvement. We calculated the predictive value for 
interpretations for which pathologists would not desire second opinions and found 
concerning levels of disagreement with the reference consensus panel for slides showing 
atypia and DCIS. Similarly, slides that were not considered borderline diagnoses of atypia

 and DCIS also had high probabilities of not being confirmed by the expert reference 
consensus panel. Pathologists had higher rates of desiring second opinions or noting a case 
was borderline when they were less likely to agree with the reference consensus diagnosis, 
but this was not the case for atypia. Pathologists’ diagnoses of atypia had markedly low 
agreement with the reference standard for all cases, regardless of whether the diagnosis was 
noted as borderline or the pathologist desired a second opinion.
The B-Path Study reference standard was defined as the consensus diagnosis of 3 
experienced breast pathologists. Although the consensus diagnosis may be a reasonable 
reference standard for a scientific study (9) and, from a patient's perspective, obtaining 
opinions from 3 experienced pathologists on a case might seem ideal, there is no guarantee 
that this reference standard represents biological truth. In addition, as stated earlier, 
differences in diagnostic opinion between 2 or more pathologists may reflect the underlying 
biological uncertainty inherent in a particular case rather than the diagnostic accuracy of the 
pathologist. Additional research is needed to determine whether objective measures of 
diagnostic uncertainty could be integrated into management of breast disease rather than 
expecting pathologists to always make a definitive microscopic diagnosis.
Our results are based on the limited number of B-Path cases, and histologic data from other 
populations might differ. We should also note that we used diagnostic prevalence rates based 
on a population of women in their 50s who were screened using film mammography, and 
results may differ with newer technologies, such as digital mammography, magnetic 
resonance imaging, and tomosynthesis. In addition, our estimates may not reflect outcomes 
for women in other age groups, unscreened women, or women from different countries. 
Calculations for other populations can be performed by following the example in the 
Appendix and substituting alternative population-specific prevalence estimates of biopsy 
outcomes.
In summary, we estimate that the initial interpretation of a single breast biopsy slide with 
representative diagnostic features would disagree with a reference consensus diagnosis for 
about 8% of women having a biopsy, with more overinterpretations than 
underinterpretations among the discordant cases. Of note, more than 97% of interpretations 
of invasive breast cancer and benign cases without atypia from a single slide would agree 
with the reference diagnosis, but reference diagnosis verification for DCIS and especially 
atypia is predicted to be much lower. Efforts to reduce diagnostic variability need to be 
considered and evaluated and might include educational programs, improved diagnostic 
techniques, or second-review policies. Alternatively, women with borderline breast lesions 
that are difficult to categorize, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia and low-grade DCIS, may 
benefit from revised guidelines for clinical treatment and management given the degree of 
diagnostic variability and biological overlap between these diagnostic categories.

Appendix: Calculating Frequencies of Reference Standard Diagnostic 
Categories for Women in the Population With Biopsy Slides Interpreted in 
Each Category by Single Pathologists
The calculations presented here illustrate the use of Bayes theorem that is described in the 
Methods section of the article. This illustration will allow readers to apply the B-Path results 
to other populations as long as information about the prevalence of true diagnostic outcomes 
is available. The B-Path Study used a test set of slides with overrepresentation of cases in 
several reference diagnostic categories. For cases in each category according to the reference 
consensus diagnosis, the cross-classified data from B-Path (Appendix Table 1) allowed us 
to calculate the frequency of interpretations by study pathologists in each category. These 
are shown as the column percentages in Appendix Table 2. For example, 17.1% of cases 
classified as atypia by the expert reference consensus panel were classified as DCIS by study 
pathologists.
For women aged 50 to 59 years having screening mammography, the proportions in each 
diagnostic category are 0.516 (benign nonproliferative), 0.133 (benign proliferative), 0.039 
(atypia), 0.061 (DCIS), and 0.251 (invasive breast cancer). The bottom row of Appendix 
Table 3 shows the expected numbers in each category for 1000 random women. The 
columns of Appendix Table 3 show how the number in each category would likely be 
distributed according to pathologist interpretations. These entries were calculated by 
multiplying the column total by the column percentages from Appendix Table 2.
We next combined the 2 benign categories to arrive at the 4 × 4 distribution of classifications 
for these 1000 women in Appendix Table 4.
Appendix Table 4 also shows the totals in each row. Using these row totals as 
denominators, in Appendix Table 5 we calculated the percentages that would be in each 
diagnostic category according to the reference consensus diagnosis. For example, of the 
629.8 pathologist interpretations in the benign category, 611 (97.0%) would be classified as 
benign and 13.5 (2.1%) would be classified as atypia by the reference consensus panel. The 
entries in Appendix Table 5 are the probabilities shown in Table 1. There are some 
discrepancies with the entries in Table 1 in the first decimal place. These are due to 
rounding in our illustrative calculations; Table 1 has the more precise calculations.

 EDITORS’ NOTES
Context
Variability in the interpretation of breast biopsy slides has been documented, but its effect 
at a population level depends on the prevalence of diagnoses.
Contribution
To estimate how diagnostic variability affects accuracy from the perspective of a U.S. 
woman aged 50 to 59 years having a breast biopsy, researchers compared pathologists’ 
interpretations of a single case slide with a reference consensus interpretation from 3 
experts. The likelihood that a diagnosis of atypia or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) 
would be verified by the reference consensus diagnosis was low.
Caution
Pathologists reviewed a single slide.
Implication
Clinicians and patients should be aware that atypia and DCIS represent diagnostic gray 
zones.
