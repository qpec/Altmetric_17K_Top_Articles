Abstract
To date there are no approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of Ebola virus disease
(EVD). While a number of candidate drugs have shown limited efficacy in vitro and/or in
non-human primate studies, differences in experimental methodologies make it difficult to
compare their therapeutic effectiveness. Using an in vitro model of Ebola Zaire replication
with transcription-competent virus like particles (trVLPs), requiring only level 2 biosafety
containment, we compared the activities of the type I interferons (IFNs) IFN-α and IFN-ß, a
panel of viral polymerase inhibitors (lamivudine (3TC), zidovudine (AZT) tenofovir (TFV),
favipiravir (FPV), the active metabolite of brincidofovir, cidofovir (CDF)), and the estrogen
receptor modulator, toremifene (TOR), in inhibiting viral replication in dose-response and
time course studies. We also tested 28 two- and 56 three-drug combinations against Ebola
replication. IFN-α and IFN-ß inhibited viral replication 24 hours post-infection (IC50 0.038μM
and 0.016μM, respectively). 3TC, AZT and TFV inhibited Ebola replication when used
alone (50–62%) or in combination (87%). They exhibited lower IC50 (0.98–6.2μM) com-
pared with FPV (36.8μM), when administered 24 hours post-infection. Unexpectedly, CDF
had a narrow therapeutic window (6.25–25μM). When dosed >50μM, CDF treatment
enhanced viral infection. IFN-ß exhibited strong synergy with 3TC (97.3% inhibition) or in tri-
ple combination with 3TC and AZT (95.8% inhibition). This study demonstrates that IFNs
and viral polymerase inhibitors may have utility in EVD. We identified several 2 and 3 drug
combinations with strong anti-Ebola activity, confirmed in studies using fully infectious
ZEBOV, providing a rationale for testing combination therapies in animal models of lethal
Ebola challenge. These studies open up new possibilities for novel therapeutic options, in

Author Summary
Studies to evaluate the effectiveness of candidate antiviral drugs to inhibit Ebola virus
infection have been hampered by the availability and access to level 4 containment facili-
ties. Using a mini-genome model system that generates Ebola virus-like particles that
infect cells, we have been able to screen a panel of candidate drugs for antiviral activity,
under normal level 2 containment. We compared the activities of 8 different antivirals
from 3 drug classes, including drugs repurposed for the treatment of Ebola: type I interfer-
ons and nucleoside analogs. Our data indicate that IFN-ß is a potent inhibitor of Ebola
virus, contributing to the decision to conduct a clinical trial of IFN-ß treatment for Ebola
virus disease in Guinea. Moreover, we identified that 2 and 3 drug combinations inhibit
Ebola replication when administered 24 hours post-infection. Drug combinations have
important implications for clinical use, since lower doses of each drug are administered,
potentially decreasing side-effects and, based on different mechanisms of action, there is
less likelihood for the emergence of drug resistance. These studies set the stage for both
preclinical and clinical evaluation.
Introduction
As of December 13, 2015, the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa
has resulted in 28,633 cumulative cases and 11,314 deaths [1]. Two potential vaccine candi-
dates, rVSVΔG-ZEBOV and ChAd3-EBO Z, have shown durable protection from lethal Ebola
challenge in mice [2] and macaques [3] respectively, and are part of the phase II/III PREVAIL
trial in Liberia and Guinea (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02344407). Other potential
therapeutics, such as convalescent plasma and the antibody cocktail ZMapp [4] have been
approved for an emergency phase II/III trial in Guinea (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT02342171) and a phase I trial in Liberia (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT02363322), respectively. However, to date there is no licensed vaccine or treatment for
EVD, although improvements in supportive care are increasing survival rates [5].
Repurposing antivirals used for other viral infections, based on knowledge of mechanisms
of action, has prompted accumulating interest in the application of different nucleoside/nucle-
otide analogs and type I interferons (IFNs) for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD).
Experimental nucleoside analogs may have therapeutic efficacy for EVD, given the evidence of
protection in primate and rodent disease models, 2–6 days after lethal Ebola or the related
hemorrhagic Marburg virus challenges [6,7]. Favipiravir, a viral polymerase inhibitor, provides
100% protection when administered 6 days after challenge with a lethal dose of Ebola virus [6]
and has been evaluated in the phase II/III JIKI trial in Guinea (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/
show/NCT02329054). TKM-100802, a cocktail of siRNAs targeting VP35 and L polymerase
and brincidofovir (BCV), a viral polymerase inhibitor that has activity against dsDNA viruses
such as adenovirus and cytomegalovirus [8], were also considered for treatment against EVD.
The brincidofovir trial was halted, ostensibly because of projections of low recruitment.
Despite infecting different target cells, Ebola and HIV-1 share many similar features early in
their replication cycle. Both are RNA viruses that package a viral polymerase (L for Ebola, RT

 for HIV-1) required for early replication in the cytosol of the host cell [9]. Homology-based
structural prediction of the RNA-dependant RNA polymerase of Ebola indicates the polymer-
ase contains conserved structural motifs in the catalytic palm subdomain similar to viral DNA
polymerases [10], supportive of nucleoside analogs potentially inhibiting Ebola replication.
Inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcription with nucleoside analogs such as lamivudine (3TC, cyti-
dine analog), zidovudine (AZT, thymidine analog) or tenofovir (TFV, adenosine monophos-
phate analog) is the basis for highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) [11,12].
Nucleoside analogs are on the WHO list of essential medicines and can be deployed in limited
resource settings [13]. Moreover, AZT binds RNA through G-C and A-U bases [14], prompt-
ing us to evaluate whether these nucleoside analogs might also inhibit Ebola replication.
Type I IFNs mediate diverse biological effects, including cell type-independent antiviral
responses and cell type-restricted responses of immunological relevance. IFNs inhibit viral
infection by preventing viral entry into target cells and by blocking different stages of the viral
replication cycle for different viruses. Moreover, type I IFNs have a critical role in linking the
innate and adaptive immune responses to viral challenge. IFN-α/β expression occurs as the
earliest non-specific response to viral infection. Indeed, viruses have evolved immune evasion
strategies specifically targeted against an IFN response, confirming the importance of IFNs as
antivirals. This immune evasion strategy is relevant when one considers the IFN response to
Ebola infection [15]. Ebola proteins VP24 and VP35 inhibit host cell systems that lead to IFN
production and also inhibit events associated with an IFN response [16–18]. VP24 blocks the
binding of importins to phosphorylated STAT1, preventing STAT1 nuclear translocation
required for transcription of interferon simulated genes [16]. VP35 binds viral dsRNA, pre-
venting dsRNA degradation [17] and inhibits the phosphorylation of IRF-3 and the SUMOyla-
tion of IRF-3 and IRF-7, thereby limiting IFN production [18]. Despite these virally-encoded
mechanisms to limit an IFN response to infection, different rodent and non-human primate
studies provide evidence for IFN-induced partial protection: the effects of IFN-α/β treatment
in lethal Ebola virus infection reduced viremia and prolonged survival [19–21]. Thus, a poten-
tial therapeutic effect for IFNs as monotherapy in EVD, or in combination with other anti-
Ebola therapies, has not been resolved.
Results
We employed an established mini-genome system to rapidly evaluate candidate drugs that
could inhibit Ebola Zaire replication under BSL 2 conditions [22–24]. At the outset we estab-
lished the experimental conditions for infection with replication and transcription-competent
virus like particles (trVLPs), by examining luciferase activity under various transfection and
drug treatment conditions, which included transfection with viral support protein plasmids
(S1 Fig). We included treatment with maraviroc, a CCR5 inhibitor, that would have no effect
on trVLP entry and infection, thereby serving as a negative control for subsequent treatment
regimens.
In a first series of experiments, we examined the inhibitory effects of IFN-α (0.5μM/10,000
U/mL), IFN-ß (0.2μM/1,000 U/ml), TOR (5μM), CDF (100μM), FPV (100μM), and a combi-
nation of 3TC, AZT and TFV (5μM each) on trVLP infection of 293T cells (Fig 1). Specifically,
the 293 T cells were treated with the different drugs at four different times relative to infection
with trVLP, as indicated. We provide evidence that for each of the individual drugs and for the
triple drug combination, at the doses indicated, trVLP infection of 293 T cells is inhibited when
treatment is initiated at +2, +6 or +24 hours post-infection. Interestingly, TOR, an estrogen
receptor modulator discovered in a high throughput screen as a potent inhibitor of Ebola [25],
significantly reduced viral luciferase activity at all time-points tested. For IFN-α, IFN-ß, TOR

 and FPV treatments, maximal inhibition of trVLP infection was achieved when the cells were
treated prior to challenge with trVLP. By contrast, pre-treatment with CDF at 100μM, 24
hours prior to infection with trVLP, resulted in enhanced infection.
In subsequent dose-response studies, we compared the inhibitory effects of IFN-α, IFN-ß,
TOR, CDF, FPV, 3TC, AZT or TFV when administered 24 hours post trVLP infection (Fig 2).
The data in Fig 2I summarize the IC50 dose for each drug. The IFNs exhibited the lowest IC50
values at 0.016μM for IFN-ß and 0.038μM for IFN-α. The data show a log-fold difference in
IC50 values for IFN-α and IFN-ß when compared in terms of U/ml, the norm for antiviral
activity measurements (Fig 2A and 2B). TOR had the next lowest IC50 (0.36μM) and
completely inhibited infection at doses > 5μM (Fig 2C). TFV had an IC50 at 0.98μM. CDF,
3TC and AZT all exhibited similar IC50 values in the dose range 4.2–7.8μM, while FPV had the
highest IC50 of the nucleoside analogs at 36.8μM. At their IC50 concentration, none of these
drugs directly inhibited luciferase reporter activity (S2 Fig). We observed a relatively small

 antiviral dose range for CDF (1.5–25μM) (Fig 2D), beyond which the drug appeared to
enhance viral infection (S3 Fig). In cell viability assays we observe that at doses >10μM CDF
affect cell viability, confounding the interpretation of the effects of CDF on viral replication.
In an orthogonal assay to confirm these findings, we next measured viral replication and
transcription by qRT-PCR, following trVLP infection. trVLP-infected cells were either left
untreated, or treated with the different drugs 24 hours post-infection, then viral replication and

 transcription evaluated 24 hours later (Fig 3). All treatments, with the exception of TOR, signif-
icantly reduced the amount of genomic vRNA detected within cells (Fig 3A) and all treatments
significantly reduced the synthesis of cRNA and mRNA isolated from infected cells (Fig 3B).
Notably, IFN-ß treatment of trVLP-infected cells resulted in the greatest reduction in viral rep-
lication and transcription.

 Next we examined the effectiveness of two and three drug combinations on trVLP infection.
We first examined 28 two-drug combinations, using each drug at its IC50 value, and used the
median-effect equation and combination index theorem [26] to determine drug synergy, addi-
tive or sub-additive effects (Fig 4A). Synergy is defined as greater than additive effect when
drugs were combined (CI<1), additive as the effect expected when combining each drug
(CI = 1) and sub-additive as a smaller than expected additive effect (CI>1). When adminis-
tered 24 hours post-infection, many of the two-drug combinations showed strong synergism in
inhibiting trVLP replication (Fig 4J), with IFN-β + 3TC demonstrating the greatest synergism
(97.3% inhibition, CI = 0.028). 3TC was synergistic with all seven other drugs tested. Notably,
when CDF was used in combination with FPV, AZT, TFV or IFN-α, it produced a sub-additive
effect.
Next we tested all possible 56 three-drug combinations, using each drug at its IC50 value, to
assess whether adding a third drug enhanced efficacy compared with two-drug combinations
(Fig 4B–4I). This series of experiments served to validate our two-drug findings, as synergistic
two-drug combinations such as IFN-β + 3TC and IFN-β + AZT, predicted strong synergy for
the triple drug combination of IFN-ß + 3TC + AZT. As anticipated from the two-drug polygo-
nogram, CDF was sub-additive when combined in three-drug combinations (Fig 4E). This was
most evident even when CDF was administered in conjunction with two-drug combinations
that had shown strong synergy, such as IFN-β + 3TC or FPV + TFV, further indicating that
CDF diminishes the antiviral effects of other drugs. IFN-ß, 3TC, AZT and TFV all promoted
strong synergism when included in triple drug combinations, with IFN-β + AZT specifically
providing strong synergism when combined in three unique triple therapies.
From these two-drug and three-drug screens, we calculated the combination index (CI) and
fractional inhibition (Fi) (Fig 4J and 4K). Many of the synergistic drug combinations (i.e. low
CI) included one nucleoside analog and an IFN, while those drug combinations that were sub-
additive all included CDF. IFN-β was predominant in the most efficacious two- and three-drug
combinations. In particular, IFN-β + 3TC and IFN-β + 3TC + AZT consistently exhibited the
strongest synergism and highest Fi when administered 24 hours post-infection. Refer also to S1
and S2 Tables.
In a final series of experiments, in order to validate our findings from the trVLP infection
studies, we examined the antiviral effectiveness of IFN-ß, IFN-α, TOR, FVP, AZT, 3TC and
TFV in 293T cells infected with ZEBOV (ZEBOV contained an eGFP reporter). CDF was
excluded from these experiments. Initial dose-response studies were conducted at doses reflec-
tive of those used in the trVLP experiments in Fig 2. A higher dose of each drug was required
to inhibit ZEBOV infection compared with trVLP infection (S4 Fig). Using the IC25 of each
drug, we next evaluated 2 and 3 drug combinations for additive or synergistic effects against
ZEBOV infection. All seven 2 drug combinations were synergistic (low CI) (Fig 5A), similar to
the most synergistic combinations against trVLP in Fig 4J. IFN-β + 3TC proved to be the most
synergistic 2 drug combination, analogous to trVLP infection. Of the most synergistic 3 drug
combinations identified in the trVLP infection system, all seven exhibited synergy against
ZEBOV infection, with IFN-β + 3TC + AZT and IFN-β + TOR + AZT exhibiting the strongest
synergy (Fig 5B). The CIs determined from trVLP infection correlated well with those deter-
mined using ZEBOV infection; specifically, the correlation coefficients (R2 values) confirm this
(Fig 5C and 5D).

 vary, treatment regimens vary from prophylaxis to post-exposure administration, and direct
readouts of antiviral efficacy differ. Moreover, given the virulence and high mortality associated
with EVD, all of these studies have been conducted under BSL 4 conditions, limiting the num-
ber of laboratories that can engage in these antiviral studies. Cognizant of these limitations, we
employed the trVLP model system to compare the antiviral effectiveness of eight antiviral can-
didates from three drug classes. We evaluated their antiviral activities in the context of inhibi-
tion of Ebola replication, using this mini-genome model that allows for rapid comparisons
among compounds under BSL 2 conditions. The tetracistronic minigenome represents the
most sophisticated in vitro replication model of Ebola virus to date. trVLPs proceed through
every replication step as wild-type Ebola virus, and have been tested in multiple cell lines.
Using TOR, there has been some validation of the trVLP assay. Specifically, TOR has been eval-
uated in limiting Ebola virus infection of VeroE6 and HepG2 cells, and exhibited IC50 values of
0.2 μM and 0.03 μM, respectively [27], in line with the IC50 dose for TOR (0.36μM) observed
with trVLP infection. Likewise, the IC50 identified in the trVLP system for FPV (36.8μM), is
consistent with that of 67μM recorded using Ebola virus infection [6], suggesting that this
Ebola mini-genome system has relevance for screening potential antiviral compounds. Indeed,
our validation studies using ZEBOV (ZEBOV-eGFP) suggest that the trVLP infection model
has utility as an in vitro screening assay when comparing different drugs as monotherapies or
in 2 and 3 drug combinations.
As mentioned, the Ebola virus encodes in its genome factors that limit a type I IFN response
to infection [16–18]. Yet, both rodent and non-human primate studies suggest that IFN-α and
IFN-ß treatment can confer partial protection from infection, reducing viremia and prolonging
survival [19–21], suggesting that it may be possible to override the inhibitory effects of the
virus by treatment with IFN. At the outset, we conducted a series of experiments to compare
the antiviral activities of IFN-α and IFN-ß in the trVLP infection system, and our findings sug-
gest that whether treatment is administered prior to or post-infection, both IFN-α and IFN-ß
exhibit antiviral activity. These findings only have relevance for the direct antiviral activities of
these IFNs, since the effects of IFN-α or IFN-ß on immune modulation for viral clearance can-
not be determined using this system. Nevertheless, these data contributed to the decision to
conduct a clinical trial of IFN-ß treatment for EVD in Guinea.
We provide evidence that the nucleoside/nucleotide analogs 3TC, AZT, TFV, FPV and CDF
inhibit Ebola trVLP replication in vitro. The results with 3TC are in contrast to published data
that show no evidence for 3TC inhibiting Ebola virus infection in vitro [27]. These studies
examined the antiviral effectiveness of 3TC when administered one hour prior to infection, in
contrast to our studies that have focused on post-exposure protection. In cells, the kinetics of
3TC phosphorylation are such that a minimum of four hours are required for optimal activity,
perhaps distinguishing why our 24 hour pre-treatment, specifically a combination treatment,
offered protection. Post-exposure treatment with 3TC and the other nucleoside/nucleotide
analogs we examined, would more likely reveal activity against viral RNA synthesis than pre-
treatment. When comparing the IC50 values of each of the nucleoside analogs that we tested,
TFV exhibited the lowest IC50 at ~1μM. Whether this reflects the fact that this adenosine
monophosphate analog only requires two phosphorylation events to become an active drug
versus three for the other nucleoside analogs, remains undetermined. Extensive published data
reveal both the safety profiles [11,28,29] and the biodistribution of 3TC, AZT and TFV in the
circulation and liver [30,31], the same compartments where Ebola infects monocytes, macro-
phages, dendritic cells, endothelial cells and hepatocytes. Moreover, drug interactions with
other nucleoside analogs have been well studied: e.g. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, when used
alone or in combination with emtricitabine effectively prevents HIV-1 infection in antiretrovi-
ral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) [29].

 Our studies also revealed that the active metabolite of brincidofovir, CDF, has a narrow
therapeutic window of efficacy (6.25–25μM) when assessed in the trVLP assay, enhancing viral
replication at higher doses when added either prior to or post-infection. In cell viability assays,
CDF exhibits cytotoxicity at doses >10μM. These findings suggest that caution is required if
CDF is to be considered further for the treatment of EVD, specifically that phase I/II trials
define the safety profile of this drug for EVD.
Another advantage of this in vitro system is that it allowed us to evaluate various 2 and 3
drug combinations and demonstrates that combination treatments limit viral replication up to
97.3%. A benefit of combination treatment is the potential to limit/avoid the emergence of
drug resistance. Interestingly, IFN-ß was predominant among all the 8 antivirals considered in
terms of contributing very strong synergism in combination treatments: e.g. IFN-ß + 3TC;
IFN-ß + 3TC + AZT. Using this system, we observe that FPV, when administered 24 hours
post-infection, has an IC50 of ~ 37μM. To date, the phase II/III JIKI trial examining the efficacy
of FPV against EVD has reported only modestly encouraging results. In our 2 drug combina-
tion treatment studies we show that, with the exception of CDF, whenever FPV is included,
synergy occurs, effectively reducing the CI. It may transpire that for treating EVD, FPV is most
effective in a drug combination regimen.
Viewed altogether, we present an in vitro Ebola trVLP screening system, that requires only
level 2 biocontainment, which allowed us to compare the antiviral activities of 8 compounds,
either alone or in combination. We provide evidence that IFNs are effective inhibitors of Ebola
replication, with IFN-ß exhibiting greater efficacy over IFN-α, or when used in combination
with nucleoside analogs. We infer from our data that whether IFN-ß treatment is administered
24 hours prior to, or up to 24 hours post-infection, reduced Ebola replication is achieved. As
additional antiviral therapeutic candidates become available, we now have the capability to
measure and compare their direct antiviral activities with the existing panel. This allows for
rapid in vitro evaluation and the opportunity to prioritize antiviral candidates for further pre-
clinical and clinical trial studies.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture and trVLP infection
We employed an established mini-genome system to rapidly evaluate candidate drugs that
could inhibit Ebola Zaire replication under BSL 2 conditions [22]. The mini-genome encodes 3
of the 7 Ebola proteins (VP24, VP40 and GP1,2) and a luciferase reporter gene. Expression plas-
mids for the remaining four Ebola nucleocapsid proteins (L, NP, VP30 and VP35) were also
included during transfection. Cell culture conditions and virus infections were performed as
previously described [22]. Briefly, 80,000 producer 293 T cells (American Type Culture Collec-
tion; ATCC, Rockville, USA) were seeded in individual wells of 24-well plates in 400μL Dulbec-
co’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin and 1%
streptomycin, and grown in 5% C02 atmosphere at 37°C. Cells were transfected with the viral
replication protein plasmids (L, NP, VP30, VP35), a tetracistronic Ebola mini-genome and the
T7 polymerase, using the CalPhos Mammalian Transfection Kit (Clontech Laboratories). 24
hours later, medium was replaced with 800μL DMEM with 5% FBS. The replication and tran-
scription-competent virus like particles (trVLPs) were harvested 3 days later. Virus stock was
frozen at -80°C.
For infection, 293 T target cells were seeded at 80,000 cells in 400μL of DMEM supple-
mented with 10% FBS. Target cells were then transfected with the four viral replication protein
plasmids, as well as Tim-1, to allow efficient virus binding and entry. 24hr post-transfection,
25μL of trVLP stock was diluted in 600μL of DMEM with 5% FBS, warmed to 37°C for 30 min,

 then added to target cells. Medium was removed the following day and replaced with 800μL
DMEM with 5% FBS. Four days post-infection, the medium was aspirated and cells were re-
suspended in 200μL of 1x Renila Luciferase Assay Lysis Buffer (Renilla Luciferase Assay Sys-
tem, Promega). Lysates were assayed for luciferase activity.
ZEBOV-eGFP infection
We generated recombinant ZEBOV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)
from cDNA clones of full-length infectious ZEBOV, as previously described [32]. The eGFP
reporter protein was expressed as an eighth gene, and the virus exhibited an in vitro phenotype
similar to wild-type ZEBOV. Notably, in vivo, incorporation of GFP into wild-type ZEBOV
results in some attenuation of disease [32]. All work with infectious ZEBOV was performed in
biosafety level 4 (BSL4), at the National Microbiology Laboratory of the Public Health Agency
of Canada in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
30,000 293 T cells were seeded in 96-well plates in 100μL DMEM with 10% FBS. 24 hours
thereafter, the medium was replaced with 100μL DMEM with 10% FBS containing
ZEBOV-GFP at an MOI of 0.1. 24 hours post-infection, the medium was removed and replaced
with 200μL of DMEM with 5% FBS, or 190μL DMEM with 5% FBS and 10μL of single or com-
binations of drugs. eGFP fluorescence was measured 3 days post-infection using a Synergy
HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek).
Drugs
For these experiments, we used toremifiene citrate (TOR; Sigma), cidofovir hydrate (CDF;
Sigma) favipiravir (FPV, T-705; Cellagen Technology), lamivudine (3TC; Sigma) zidovudine
(AZT), tenofovir (TFV) maraviroc (MVC; NIH AIDS Reagent Program), Infergen (IFN alfa-
con-1, Pharmunion Bsv Development Ltd.) or human interferon beta-1a (IFN-β, Avonex;
Biogen).
Mini-genome RNA extraction and qRT-PCR quantification of viral RNA
Forty-eight hours after trVLP infection, medium was aspirated from 293 T cells that had either
been left untreated or treated with the various drugs and total RNA extracted from cell lysates
with 500μL of TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA synthesis was performed on 5 μg of
total RNA, using the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. A 20 μl reaction also contained bulk first-strand cDNA
reaction mix, DTT solution and 40 pmol of one of two trVLP specific primers [33]: vRNA for-
ward (5’-GGC CTC TTC TTA TTT ATG GCG A -3’), or cRNA/mRNA reverse (5’-AGA ACC
ATT ACC AGA TTT GCC TGA-3’). Both primers were synthesized by the Center for Applied
Genomics (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). Real-time qPCR reactions
(25 μl) were conducted in duplicate, using the Rotor-Gene RG-3000 thermocycler (Corbett
Research, Montreal, Canada). Each reaction contained 100 ng template cDNA, 12.5 μL 2 x
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK), 300 nM of both the for-
ward (vRNA) and reverse (cRNA/mRNA) primers, and PCR grade H2O (Roche Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, USA). Samples lacking reverse transcriptase (No RT) during first-strand cDNA
synthesis served as negative controls. Cycling parameters were as follows: initial denaturation
at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification with 95°C for 15 seconds, 56°C for 30
seconds, and 60°C for 30 seconds. Biological triplicates in the drug-treated groups were nor-
malized to the average Ct of infected cells given DMSO solvent alone, by the 2-ΔCT comparative
CT method.

 Cell viability assay
Dose-response cytotoxicity/viability assays were conducted in 293 T cells 4 days post-infection
for each of the drugs examined, either alone or in the various combinations indicated, using
the MTT assay as previously described [34].
Statistics
Means were compared using a two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test and corrected for multiple
comparisons. For all figures, (�) denotes a p value <0.05, (��) denotes a p value <0.01 and (���)
denotes a p value <0.001. Error bars shown are the standard error around the mean (SEM).
Synergy between two and three-drug combinations, combination index (CI) and dose-reduc-
tion index (DRI) were calculated with CompuSyn Version 1.0 [26]. The coefficient of determi-
nation (R2) was determined for simple linear regressions.
