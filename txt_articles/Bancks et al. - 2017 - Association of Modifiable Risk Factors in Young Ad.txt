IMPORTANCE In the United States, black individuals are twice as likely to develop type 2
diabetes compared with white individuals, and these disparities are particularly pronounced
in young and middle age. Prior studies have identified differences in traditional risk factors
that may be associated with racial disparities in diabetes incidence but have not
simultaneously adjusted for risk factors measured across multiple domains (eg, the individual
and the environment) and updated over time.
OBJECTIVE To determine the relative associations of modifiable biological, neighborhood,
psychosocial, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors in young adulthood with the observed
racial disparity in diabetes incidence between middle-aged black and white individuals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Black and white men and women from the
observational Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, aged 18 to 30 years,
without diabetes at baseline (1985-1986; N = 4251) were observed through 2015-2016.
Sex-stratified multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling, with adjustment for
time-updated covariates, was used to estimate risk for incident diabetes. Percent reduction in
the β coefficient (the logarithm used to calculate the hazard ratio [HR]) was calculated to
compare black to white participants.
EXPOSURES Self-identified race and factors including biological (eg, fasting glucose, body
mass index), neighborhood (racial segregation and tract-level poverty), psychosocial
(depressive symptoms), socioeconomic (eg, personal and parental educational attainment,
current employment), and behavioral (eg, regular alcohol consumption, smoking) domains.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident type 2 diabetes mellitus.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age at baseline was 25 (3.6) years, 49% (n = 2066) of the sample was
black, and 54% (n = 2304) were women. Over a mean follow-up of 24.5 years, 504 cases of
incident diabetes were identified. Using sex-stratified multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional
hazards models, black women and men were more likely to develop diabetes than white men
and women (black women: HR, 2.86 [95% CI, 2.19-3.72] and risk difference [RD], 89
cases/1000 people [95% CI, 61-117]; black men: HR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.28-2.17] and RD, 47
cases/1000 people [95% CI, 15-78]) after adjustment for age and center. Biological factors were
most strongly associated with the disparity in diabetes risk between black and white individuals
for women (percent reduction in β, 112%) and men (percent reduction in β, 86%). There was no
longer disparity in diabetes risk between black and white middle-aged adults after adjustment
for biological, neighborhood, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors measured
over time (HR for women, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.55-1.14]; HR for men, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.62-1.38]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study comparing black and white participants,
there was a statistically significant increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes among black
women and men. However, after adjustment for modifiable risk factors during young
adulthood, the disparity was no longer statistically significant.

 T
he prevalence of type 2 diabetes among black adults in
theUnitedStatesisnearlytwicethatoftheirwhitecoun-
terparts, and the difference in prevalence and inci-
dence between black and white adults has increased be-
tween 1980 and 2012.1-3 Brancati et al4 first described the
relativeassociationofestablisheddiabetesriskfactorswiththe
racial differences observed in diabetes incidence in middle-
aged and older adults in 2000. However, racial and ethnic mi-
nority populations remain at higher risk for incident diabetes
and its complications, leading the American Diabetes Asso-
ciation to prioritize the elimination of disparities in diabetes
research, treatment, and education.5 Epidemiological stud-
ies have identified factors at the individual and neighbor-
hood levels that are associated with the excess prevalence of
diabetes among black vs white individuals, but those studies
include middle-aged and older-aged populations.4,6-12 How-
ever, since 2002, diabetes incidence has increased most rap-
idly among black youth and young adults as compared with
white individuals in the same age groups.13
The objective of this study was to characterize exposure
to modifiable biological, neighborhood, psychosocial, socio-
economic, and behavioral factors during young adulthood and
quantify the extent to which these factors and their changes
over time are associated with the disparity in diabetes inci-
dence between black and white participants over 30 years of
follow-up. The study hypothesis was that differences in bio-
logical factors during young adulthood would be most strongly
associated with the disparity in diabetes incidence in middle
age between black and white individuals.
Methods
The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
(CARDIA) is a multicenter observational cohort study.14 Briefly,
in1985-1986,5115blackandwhiteadults(studyparticipantsself-
reportedraceasnon-Hispanicblackorwhite)aged18to30years
were recruited from 4 US urban communities (Birmingham,
Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and
Oakland,California).Studyrecruitmentwasapproximatelybal-
anced on age (<25 years and ≥25 years) sex, race, and educa-
tion (≤high school graduation and >high school education).
In-person examinations occurred at 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, and
30 (2015-2016) years after baseline with annual telephone in-
terviews to update health status and contact information.
Institutional review boards at each study center ap-
proved research protocols, and participants provided written
informed consent at each examination.
Ascertainment of Diabetes
Serum glucose was measured using the hexokinase ultravio-
let method at baseline and using hexokinase coupled to glu-
cose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase at subsequent examina-
tions; values were standardized across examinations.
Hemoglobin A1c was measured using Tosoh G7 (variant mode)
high-performance liquid chromatography (National Glycohe-
moglobin Standardization Program–certified assays). Diabe-
tes status was determined at each examination using a com-
bination of available information on fasting glucose greater
thanorequalto126mg/dL,postchallenge(75g)glucosegreater
than or equal to 200 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c greater than or
equal to 6.5%, or use of diabetes medications (eAppendix in
the Supplement).
Clinical Measurements and Questionnaires
The diabetes risk factors that were selected were modifiable,
available in the study, known to vary by race in the literature,
and categorized into the following groups: biological, neigh-
borhood, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and behavioral.
Biological
At baseline, participants self-reported their parents’history of
diabetes. The following measurements were assessed by re-
search staff during each clinical examination with partici-
pants wearing light clothing but no shoes. Waist circumfer-
ence was measured midway between the xiphoid process and
the iliac crest and determined as the mean of the 2 measure-
ments. Body weight was measured with a calibrated scale, and
height was measured using a vertical ruler. Body mass index
was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared. Medications were assessed using the medica-
tion inventory. Fasting lipids were measured from ethylene-
diaminetetraacetic acid plasma. High-density lipoprotein
cholesterol was determined after precipitation with dextran
sulfate-magnesium chloride,15 triglycerides were measured
enzymatically,16andaratioofthe2analyteswasusedforanaly-
sis. Blood pressure was assessed at each examination in trip-
licate with the average of the last 2 measures used for analy-
sis. For years 0 through 15 blood pressure was measured with
a random-zero sphygmomanometer. At years 20, 25, and 30
blood pressure was measured using an automated oscillomet-
ricbloodpressuremonitorandvalueswerestandardizedacross
examinations to sphygmomanometric measures.
The following measurements were assessed by research
staff at other time points. Maximum forced vital capacity was
measured at examination years 0, 2, 5, 10, and 20 by forced
spirometry (maximum of 5 trials) using an 8-L water-sealed
spirometer and a microprocessor.17,18
Key Points
Question What is the association between modifiable biological,
neighborhood, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and behavioral
factors during young adulthood and the higher risk for type 2
diabetes in black adults vs white adults?
Findings In this retrospective analysis of a cohort study of 4251
participants, there was a statistically significant increased risk for
incident type 2 diabetes in black vs white individuals. However,
after adjustment for biological, neighborhood, psychosocial,
socioeconomic, and behavioral factors during young adulthood,
the disparity was no longer statistically significant (hazard ratio for
women, 0.79; hazard ratio for men, 0.92).
Meaning Differences in traditional modifiable diabetes risk
factors between black and white individuals may contribute to the
racial disparity in diabetes incidence in middle age.

measured at examination years 0, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25.
Psychosocial
Depressive symptoms were measured with the 20-item Cen-
ter for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression questionnaire at ex-
amination years 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 (score range, 0 [low
depressive symptomatology] to 60 [high depressive
symptomatology]).21 The validated cut point score of 16 or
greater was used to indicate clinically depressive symptoms
at each examination.22
Socioeconomic
Level of education of participants and their respective par-
ents, current employment status (full-time, part-time, in
school, home or child caretaker, unemployed, and other), and
marital status were self-reported at examination years 0, 5, 7,
10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. Participants reported the difficulty for
their household in paying for basics (eg, food, medical care,
and heating), with the responses of very hard, hard, some-
what hard, not very hard, or don’t know.23

previous12monthsfor13moderate-andvigorous-intensityac-
tivities and reported as a score in exercise units, showing high
test-retest reliability (0.77-0.84) over a 2-week period.28,29
Statistical Analysis
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the
hazardratio(HR)forincidentdiabetescomparingblacktowhite
participants (reference standard) with time at risk estimated
as time from the baseline examination until date of examina-
tion at which diabetes was first diagnosed or administrative
censoringatthelastattendedexamination.Wedecidedapriori
to stratify models by sex based on literature suggesting that
the racial disparity in diabetes risk between black and white
individuals is stronger for women than for men.4 We esti-
mated the extent to which groups of covariates were associ-
ated with the disparity in incident diabetes between black and
white participants by calculating the percent reduction in
β estimates associated with adjustment according to the for-
mula ([β0]−[βn])÷(β0)×100.
Our base model adjusted for age and field center (model 1
[M1]). We used multiple modeling strategies to better under-
stand the cumulative and individual association of each risk
factor group. First, we modeled sequential adjustment add-
ing each group to the previous model, beginning with the bio-
logical (M2) factors added to the base model. We then added
neighborhood (M3), psychosocial (M4), socioeconomic (M5),
and behavioral risk factor groups (M6), and estimated the per-
cent reduction in β estimates for each sequentially adjusted
modelrelativetothebasemodel.Thefinaladjustedmodel(M6)
included all risk factor groups. In our second modeling ap-
proach, we estimated the percent reduction in β estimates by
each group of covariates as compared with the base model
without adjustment for the other groups. In our third model-
ing approach, we estimated the percent reduction in β esti-
mates when excluding each group from the final adjusted
model (excluding 1 group) to reflect the remaining difference
when one group is not included in the model for adjustment.
For example, a model adjusted for biological, neighborhood,
psychosocial, and socioeconomic factors would reflect the ex-
cess diabetes risk when not adjusting for behavioral factors.
Modelswererunwithriskfactorsassessedandupdatedateach
examination (primary) and when assessed at baseline only
(secondary). The last observation was carried forward for risk
factors that were not measured at each examination.
The proportional hazards assumption was tested by add-
ing a term reflecting the product of race and natural-log of time
at risk, and no violations of this assumption were detected. We
also assessed the sensitivity of our estimates to usual medi-
cal care services and when using multiple imputation to im-
pute missing risk factor group data (eAppendix in the Supple-
ment). A 2-sided P value of less than .05 was considered
statistically significant. SAS software version 9.4 was used for
all analyses.
Results
Weexcluded1participantwhowithdrewconsentforstudypar-
ticipation, 35 participants with prevalent or unknown diabe-
tes status at baseline, and 158 participants missing follow-up
information after baseline necessary to classify diabetes
status. We excluded 670 participants (14% of remaining
sample) who were missing information for at least 1 of the risk
factors of interest, resulting in an analytic sample of 4251.

 a comparison of characteristics between participants in-
cluded and excluded from analysis is shown in eTable 2 in the
Supplement. Descriptive baseline characteristics of partici-
pants who were not identified as an incident diabetes case over
follow-up are presented according to the last attended exami-
nation in eTable 3 in the Supplement. Of the 2637 black par-
ticipants enrolled in this study, 2066 (78%) were included in
this analysis, while 2185 (88%) of the 2478 enrolled white par-
ticipants were included. Participant characteristics at base-
line are presented in Table 1. The mean (SD) age at baseline was
25 (3.6) years, 49% of the sample was black, and 54% (2304)
were women. On average, black participants had less favor-
able socioeconomic, behavioral, and neighborhood profiles as
compared with whites.
Over a mean follow-up of 24.5 years, 315 cases of incident
diabetes were identified among black participants and 189 in-
cident cases were identified among white participants. Ascer-
tainment of diabetes cases is detailed in the eAppendix in the
Supplement. The Figure presents cumulative incidence curves
according to race and sex. The unadjusted incidence for dia-
betes was 86 cases/1000 people for white individuals and 152
cases/1000 people for black individuals, resulting in an ex-
cess of 66 cases of diabetes/1000 people for black compared
with white individuals. When adjusted for age, sex, and field
center, this risk difference estimate was 67 cases/1000 people
for black compared with white individuals (95% CI, 48/1000-
89/1000). The HR for diabetes and percent reduction in
β estimates according to each model are presented in Table 2.

 (HR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.84-2.67]); for men, the HR was 1.67 (95%
CI, 1.28-2.17); whereas for women, the HR was 2.86 (95% CI,
2.19-3.72). In the primary analysis, which included updated
data for each risk factor, the disparity in diabetes HR esti-
mates for women (HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.64-1.21]) and men (HR,
1.08 [95% CI, 0.77-1.51]) were no longer observed after adjust-
ment for biological factors, indicating no significant differ-
ence in diabetes risk between black and white individuals. Fur-
ther adjustment for the updated neighborhood, psychosocial,
socioeconomic, and behavioral risk factors did not change this
finding. Table 3 presents HRs per standard deviation unit in-
crement for continuous characteristics or according to cat-
egorical characteristics for the final model when including up-
dated risk factor data.
In our secondary modeling analysis, we observed substan-
tial attenuation in the HR with adjustment for baseline mea-
surement of biological factors for women (58% reduction in β
estimates) and men (23% reduction in β estimates). Adjust-
ment for baseline neighborhood factors was associated with
further attenuation in diabetes HR comparing black to white
women (HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.95-1.95]) and strengthening of the
HR for men (HR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.15-2.40]). For both sexes, se-
quential adjustment for depressive symptoms had minimal ef-
fectondiabetesHRs.Afteradjustmentforallriskfactorgroups,
the95%CIsfordiabetesHRsforbothsexesincluded1.Formen,
adjustment for all risk factor groups resulted in less attenua-
tion of HRs comparing black to white participants than for
women. Results for these same modeling schemes of women
and men combined are presented in eTable 4 in the Supple-
ment. Including adjustment for usual medical care did not al-
ter the HR estimates (eAppendix in the Supplement). HR es-
timates from the multiply imputed data were attenuated for
women and stronger for men as compared with the nonim-
puted data (eAppendix in the Supplement).
In the primary analysis, which included updated data for
each risk factor, adjustment for biological factors only was as-
sociated with the greatest percent reduction in β estimates
(Table 4) for women (112%) and men (86%), and exclusion of
biological factors was associated with the least attenuation in
β estimates (35% for women; 47% for men). The risk factor
group associated with the second strongest attenuation in
β estimates was socioeconomic factors for women and also for
men when the modeling scheme included updated data for
eachriskfactor.Whencomparedwiththebasemodelandwith-
out adjustment for other risk factor groups, adjustment for
baseline measurement of biological factors only was associ-
ated with the greatest percent reduction in β estimates when
comparing black with white women (58%), whereas among
men, adjustment for baseline socioeconomic factors only was
associated with the greatest percent reduction in β estimates
(39%).Forwomen,whencomparedwiththebasemodel,omit-
ting adjustment for baseline measurement of biological fac-
tors from a model simultaneously adjusted for all risk factor
groups was associated with the least attenuation of diabetes
β estimates. For men, omitting adjustment for baseline behav-
ioral factors from a simultaneously adjusted model was asso-
ciated with the least attenuation of diabetes β estimates when
compared with the base model.
Discussion
In this cohort of adults who were young at study inception and
followed up for 30 years, the disparity in diabetes incidence
between black and white women and men was primarily as-
sociated with differences in biological risk factors; however,
differencesinneighborhood,psychosocial,socioeconomic,and
behavioral factors were additionally associated with dispari-
ties in diabetes risk. Among women, nearly all of the excess
diabetesriskinblackparticipantswasassociatedwiththecom-
bined differences in these factors at baseline. By contrast, one-
fourth of the excess diabetes risk in black participants was as-
sociated with the combined differences in these factors at
baseline among men. For women and men, adjustment for
changes in these factors was associated with the disparity in
diabetesincidencebetweenblackandwhiteparticipants.These
findings build on previous epidemiologic research observing
disparities in the development of diabetes by race.2,4,10-12,30-32
However, this work extends prior findings by describing these
disparitiesatayoungerageandwithlongerfollow-upthanpre-
viousstudiesandbyincludingabroadersetofexplanatoryfac-
tors and changes in these factors over time.
Recentfindingsfromthecross-sectionalBostonAreaCom-
munity Health III Survey data found individual-level socioeco-
nomicfactorsatasinglepointintimeexplainedthegreatestper-
centage of excess prevalence of diabetes in black individuals
relative to white individuals.12 The Northern Manhattan study
observedgreaterriskfordevelopingdiabetesinblackindividu-
als compared with white individuals over 11 years, finding dif-
ferential influences of body mass index, smoking, and
C-reactive protein on diabetes risk across racial-ethnic groups
in older adults.11 However, data from the Health and Retire-
ment study did not show a higher risk for incident diabetes
among black individuals relative to white individuals after ac-
counting for self-rated health status in old age.32 Findings from
thepresentstudyaresimilartothoseoftheAtherosclerosisRisk
in Communities (ARIC) study of adults aged 45 to 64 years,
whereby differences in biological factors at baseline were as-
sociated with the greatest disparity in diabetes incidence be-
tweenblackandwhiteindividuals,andthesefindingsweremore
prominent among women than among men.4,10
In ARIC, nonobese black women, but not men, had higher
levels of fasting insulin than their nonobese white counter-
parts before developing diabetes, suggesting that sex-specific
mechanisms may contribute to excess risk of diabetes in black
individuals.9 This current work is consistent with this obser-
vationasgreaterattenuationindiabetesHRs,accordingtorace,

adiposity between black and white women, were most associ-
ated with racial disparities in diabetes incidence. Among men,

 support this hypothesis as individual-level and neighborhood-
level social determinants did contribute significantly to dis-
parities in diabetes. These results suggest prevention efforts
that address racial inequalities in socioeconomic factors
(eg, educational attainment and income) may be one strategy
to reduce racial disparities in diabetes risk.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, diagnostic criteria for
diabetes changed during follow-up, and ascertainment of dia-
betes cases identified solely from the medication inventory
would be less sensitive prior to 1997. Diabetes was defined at
each examination using current American Diabetes Associa-
tion criteria for laboratory measures, and appreciable differ-
ences by race in case-ascertainment by diabetes medication
use were not observed. Second, for reasons of missing data,
14% of participants were excluded from analysis. Those who
wereexcludedweremorelikelytobeblackandhadhigherfast-
ing glucose, and estimates from multiple imputation suggest

Third, this is an observational study, and residual confound-
ing may be present in these estimates.
Conclusions
In this cohort study comparing black participants with white
participants, there was a statistically significant increased
risk of incident type 2 diabetes among black women and
men. However, after adjustment for modifiable risk factors
during young adulthood, the disparity was no longer statisti-
cally significant.
