Abstract
Woodpeckers experience forces up to 1200–1400 g while pecking. It is assumed due to evo-
lutionary adaptations, the woodpecker is immune to brain injury. This assumption has led to
the use of the woodpecker as a model in the development of sports safety equipment such
as football helmets. However, it is unknown at this time if the woodpecker brain develops
neuro-trauma in relation to the high g-forces experienced during pecking. The brains of 10
ethanol preserved woodpeckers and 5 ethanol preserved red-winged black bird experimen-
tal controls were examined using Gallyas silver stain and anti-phospho-tau. The results
demonstrated perivascular and white matter tract silver-positive deposits in eight out of the
10 woodpecker brains. The tau positive accumulations were seen in white matter tracts in 2
of the 3 woodpeckers examined. No staining was identified in control birds. The negative
staining of controls birds contrasted with the diffuse positive staining woodpecker sections
suggest the possibility that pecking may induce the accumulation of tau in the woodpecker
brain. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship.
Introduction
In the central nervous system of humans, the protein tau assists in the assembly and stabiliza-
tion of neuronal microtubules. Accumulations of tau can be seen in conditions ranging from
normal aging to various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease [1]. In the dis-
ease state, through a process yet to be understood, tau dissociates from the axons and become
hyperphosphorylated to form insoluble neurofibrillary tangles [2]. It is not entirely clear if
these aggregates are responsible for the symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
Tau accumulations have also been observed in association with chronic traumatic encepha-
lopathy (CTE) [3]. CTE is theorized to be the end result of repetitive mild traumatic brain
(mTBI) injury. Repeated concussions has been suggested as a cause of CTE in contact sport
athletes.
Recently, the CTE center at Boston University reported CTE in brain tissue of 110 out of 111
former National Football League (NFL) players studied [4]. However, CTE is not unique to
football and has been identified in the brains of athletes who play soccer, rugby and hockey [5].
The prevalence of CTE and relationship between mTBI and the subsequent development of
CTE has yet to be fully established. Currently, the disease can only be diagnosed by post mor-
tem analysis utilizing immunohistochemistry with antibodies directed against p-tau.

 The most prevalent pathological changes thought to be diagnostic of CTE are focal accumu-
lation of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) within neurons and astroglia distributed
around small blood vessels located at the depths of cortical sulci [6]. Other staining patterns
considered to be supportive of CTE include pre tangles and neurofibrillary tangles in the
superficial layers of the cortex and the hippocampus; neuronal and astrocytic aggregates in
subcortical nuclei; and ‘thread-like’ and ‘dot-like’ axonal tau staining patterns [5, 7, 8]
Because of the theorized association between mTBI and CTE, the prevention of TBI in ath-
letics has become an important area of research. Due to it’s assumed resistance to neuro-
trauma, the woodpecker has become a model for the development of safety equipment such as
football helmets and neck collars [9, 10].
The Picidae family of birds, which includes woodpeckers and sapsuckers, have several evo-
lutionary anatomic adaptations to theorized to mitigate the enormous forces they experience
while pecking. These include sharp beaks with upper and lower components which can move
independently of each other while pecking and a long tongue that is capable of bracing the
skull and brain during impacts. Other proposed protective adaptations include: thick neck
muscles to dissipate force, and unique bony features of the skull [6]. It is assumed these evolu-
tionary adaptations prevent neurotrauma in the woodpecker brain.
The majority of research using the woodpecker as a model for the development of safety
equipment has focused on the biophysics of the woodpecker’s head. To date, only one paper
has examined histologic sections of woodpecker brains in an effort to investigate the possible
existence of brain injury in these birds. [11] This previous study utilized a modified Prussian
blue stain (ferrocyanide) on the brains of two woodpeckers. Without describing their histo-
logic findings, the authors concluded woodpeckers do not experience brain injury. Since its
publication in 1976, this study has been sited in over 100 journal articles supporting the con-
clusion that woodpeckers do not incur brain injury in association with pecking behavior.
Despite the wide use of the 1976 paper, the neurobiological response of woodpeckers to
repetitive head acceleration and deceleration is vastly unexplored. At this time, it is not known
with any certainty if the brains of these animals experience neurotrauma in association with
their pecking behavior. If so, the woodpecker may serve as an important animal model for the
further study of CTE.
With the woodpecker model increasing in popularity as a potential source of protective
equipment technology development, an in-depth and comprehensive study into woodpecker
brain injury is warranted. [9] Given this, our group our group set out to determine if tau accu-
mulations exist in the brains of woodpeckers.

Avian specimens and brain tissue collection
All the bird specimens used in this project were generously donated from museum collections
(see acknowledgments). The woodpeckers (n = 10) studied were of various species (Table 1)
To extract the brains, the feathers and skin covering the skull were removed. The skull cap was
cut with a rotary tool from just above the orbits to just below the occiput in a circular fashion
to remove the skull from the brain tissue below it. The plate of bone that protects the optic
center of the brain, which is somewhat analogous to the human’s tentorium cerebelli, was
removed using forceps. The brain was gently pried away from the the skull, taking great care
around the frontal lobes and brainstem areas. Finally, an 11 blade scalpel was used to sever the

 brain stem right below the level of the pons. The extracted brains were then placed in 70% eth-
anol until tissue processing could occur.
Histological and immunohistochemical procedures
The woodpecker and red winged black bird brains were cut into gross tissue sections accord-
ing to anatomic landmarks. Tissue processing was performed the same for all tissue samples
according to standard paraffin-embedding processing procedures [12].
The Gallyas silver stain was performed in accordance to a previous published methodology
with some minor alterations at room temperature with slight agitation [13]. Experimental and
control slides were sectioned to 15μm onto slides, deparaffinized, and rehydrated back to
water. The slides were then placed in a 0.25% potassium permanganate for 15 minutes. Then,
slides were incubated in 2% oxalic acid for 5 minutes. Following the oxalic acid incubation, the
slides were rinsed in dH2O for 5 minutes before being placed in a 0.4% lanthanum nitrate/2%
sodium acetate blocking solution for one hour. After the blocking step, the slides were rinsed
again in dH2O for one minute before going into a 4% sodium hydroxide/10% potassium
iodide/0.035% silver nitrate (added in that order) solution for four minutes. The slides were
immediately placed into a 0.5% acetic acid for three, one minute rinses before being placed
into developer. The slides were then put into 1% acetic acid for three minutes and then placed
into dH2O. Mayer’s hematoxylin counterstain (Scytek, #HAQ999) was used by placing the sil-
ver stained sections into the stain for two minutes before a quick rinse in dH2O. The slides
were differentiated with 0.1% sodium bicarbonate bluing agent until desired color was
achieved. Slides were then dehydrated using the standard ethanol gradient and Histoclear
before being coverslipped.

 The immunohistochemical staining was achieved using a hybrid of previously published
techniques. [14] The tissue was cut at 25μm and each section was placed into a 2cm in diame-
ter steel-wire mesh container. The tissue slices were deparaffinized and rehydrated to water
before entering the antigen retrieval step. Antigen retrieval was done by submerging the mesh
containers into filtered 1x Tris/EDTA buffer pH 9 with 0.05% Tween 20 at 90˚C for 20 min-
utes. After the 20-minute incubation, the mesh containers were then placed into filtered 1x
TBS buffer pH 7.4 with 0.025% Triton X-100 and rinsed twice for five minutes each. After the
second rinse, the mesh containers were removed and incubated in filtered 10% goat serum/1x
TBS buffer pH 7.4 block for two hours. After incubation, tissue sections were removed from
the mesh containers and placed into individual sterilized petri dishes containing antibody in
sterile and filtered 1% goat serum 1x TBS buffer pH 7.4 overnight at 4˚C with gentle agitation.
The antibodies used were anti-phospho-tau S262 rabbit polyclonal (5μg/mL; Abcam, ab64193;
Cambridge, MA) and anti-glial fibrillary associated protein rabbit polyclonal (5μg/mL; Bioss,
bs-0199R; Woburn, MA). Following overnight incubation, the sections were removed from
the primary antibody and placed back into the mesh containers to be rinsed with 1x TBS with
0.025% Triton X-100 twice, each for five minutes. The mesh containers were then placed into
0.3% sodium hydroxide 1x TBS buffer pH 7.4 for 15 minutes. After the sodium hydroxide
incubation, the mesh containers were once again rinsed for three minutes in 1x TBS buffer pH
7.4 with 0.025% Triton X-100. The sections within the mesh containers were removed once
again, and placed into small, sterile petri dishes containing horseradish peroxidase secondary
antibody (1μg/mL; Abcam, ab6721; Cambridge, MA) in 1x TBS buffer pH 7.4 for one hour at
room temperature. After the hour incubation, the sections were placed back into their mesh
containers and rinsed twice, for five minutes each, in 1x TBS buffer pH 7.4. The sections were
then ready for the 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) reaction. The DAB chromagen (Biocare Med-
ical; DB801R; Concord, CA) reaction was carried out under a microscope until adequate stain-
ing was achieved. Sections were then immediately placed back into their mesh containers and
rinsed with dH2O for five minutes. Following the dH2O rinse, the sections were counter-
stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin counterstain (Scytek, #HAQ999) for two minutes before a
quick rinse in dH2O. The sections were then differentiated with 0.1% sodium bicarbonate blu-
ing agent until desired color was achieved. After another quick rinse in dH2O, the sections
were dehydrated using the standard ethanol gradient and Histoclear while in the mesh con-
tainers. After the last Histoclear incubation, the sections were removed from their mesh con-
tainers and free-floated into a large crystallization dish containing Histoclear. The sections
were coaxed onto clean glass slides with fine tipped forceps. The slides were then cover slipped
with mounting medium and placed onto a 37˚C warming plate overnight.
Results
Gallyas silver stain
Because Gallyas stain has a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for neurofibrillary tangles
and axonal injury, it was utilized to detect the presence of neuronal and/or white matter tract
damage throughout the entire woodpecker brain.
A section of human cortex with confirmed Alzheimer’s disease was used as a positive stain-
ing control while red-winged black birds’ brains (n = 5) were used as experimental controls for
all staining methods.
Positive silver accumulations were identified in 8 out of the 10 woodpeckers studied. Sev-
eral patterns of positive Gallyas staining were identified in the woodpecker population includ-
ing: focal perivascular deposits, which were mostly subpial, (Fig 1A, 1C and 1D); focal whole
astrocyte staining (Fig 1B); dot-like staining within axonal tracks; and wide-spread thread-like

 axonal track staining in deep white matter tracks. The majority of the observed silver-positive
staining patterns were identified in the frontal pole of the brain. Very rare staining was
detected in the occipital region, and no staining was seen in the cerebellum.
Focal perivascular silver-positive deposits were found in 40% of the woodpeckers. The most
abundant positive silver staining pattern was “thread-like” axonal white matter tracts of the
frontal lobe, which appeared in 80% (n = 10) of the woodpeckers studied (Fig 2).
No positive Gallyas staining was observed in the control birds (n = 10).
Immunohistochemistry
Following the analysis of the Gallyas silver stain, we proceed to immunohistochemical verifica-
tion of the suspected tau accumulations throughout the entire woodpecker brain. Samples
were stained for phosphorylated tau (S262).
Due to the poor preservation of the woodpecker tissue, successful immunohistochemistry
was accomplished in only 3 birds; the remainder of the tissue samples degraded during

 processing. Attempts to alter the immunohistochemistry methodology proved to not help with
the degradation of the tissue samples. Immunohistochemistry was performed on all control
birds (n = 5).
In the woodpecker specimens where tau immunostaining was possible, tau-positive accu-
mulations were identified in the same regions highlighted originally by the Gallyas silver stain.
The morphology of astrocytes identified by GFAP were used to determine some of the cells
staining with tau were in fact astrocytes. This assisted in confirming the silver-positive accu-
mulations identified were in fact comprised of tau protein. Specifically, tau immunostaining
demonstrated perivascular deposits, whole astrocyte staining, and ‘thread-like’ axonal track
staining in 2 of the 3 woodpecker brains evaluated (Fig 3).
No positive immunostaining was identified in any of the control birds.
Tau immunohistochemistry was successfully completed in three woodpecker brains.
Two of the three woodpecker brains demonstrated wide-spread thread-like axonal track stain-
ing with tau. We observed positive GFAP-staining in these same two birds (Fig 4). One

 woodpecker failed to demonstrate positive sliver and tau staining. This same bird also showed
negative GFAP immunohistostaining. Interpreted collectively, this suggests that the tau accu-
mulations we identified are pathological.

astrocytes within the grey matter (D, arrow).

 In summary, focal subpial perivascular deposits; focal whole astrocyte staining; dot-like
staining within axonal tracks; and wide-spread thread-like axonal track staining in white mat-
ter tracks were identified in the frontal poles of 80 percent of the study population. Strikingly,
no staining was identified in the control bird population.
These observations were confirmed by a board-certified neuropathologist.
Discussion
To date, there have been no histologic studies exploring the potential existence of neurotrauma
in woodpeckers. While it is unknown if the forces associated with pecking behavior could
result in traumatic brain injury, it is interesting that the majority of the woodpecker specimens
in our study displayed focal silver-positive deposits, some of which were confirmed to be tau
by immunohistochemistry, while no staining was observed in the control birds.
The anatomic locations and staining patterns of the lesions identified in the brains of wood-
peckers shares some similarities to human CTE. In humans, CTE is most prominent in the
frontal and temporal lobes of the brain with a spectrum of tau deposition patterns including
focal perivascular staining, astrocytic inclusions, ‘thread-like’ and ‘dot-like’ axonal staining
patterns (5, 7). In the woodpecker, we identified similar focal perivascular staining, astrocytic
inclusions, ‘thread-like’ and ‘dot-like’ axonal staining patterns which were confined to the
frontal lobe of the brain. The woodpecker brain lacks the gyri and sulci seen in the human
brain. Because of this, we could not evaluate for lesions located at the depth of sulci, as seen in
human CTE.
The prominent frontal and temporal anatomic locations of CTE lesions are thought to be
due to the distribution of force experienced in head collision [14]. In the woodpecker, much of
the force of pecking is thought to be dissipated through the frontal regions of the skull and
brain, as well. Therefore, it is not surprising to see potential areas of injury limited to this ana-
tomic location in woodpecker brain.
In the human brain, tau accumulations are also known to occur as part of the normal aging
process. Though it cannot be entirely ruled out, age-related tau accumulation in the wood-
pecker is an unlikely explanation for our findings. Our study population included one juvenile
woodpecker (Sphyrapicus varius) which demonstrated the full spectrum of tau accumulations
observed in the majority of the adult population suggesting the tau accumulations seen in our
study might not be age-related. This notion is further supported by the lack of observable
staining in the control population which was comprised of entirely adult birds.
Given the complete lack of staining in the control population and the unlikely scenario of
age-related changes, our findings suggest there might be an association between repetitive
pecking behavior and tau accumulations in the woodpecker population.
There are several limitations to this study. It cannot be concluded at this time the if the his-
tologic changes identified in our study are the direct result of the repeated, high force pecking
woodpeckers endure everyday. The limited number of woodpeckers (n = 10) and control birds
(n = 5) utilized in this study are insufficient to established a correlation between pecking
behavior and subsequent neurotrauma.
It is not known from our study whether the tau accumulations are pathological or result in
behavioral changes in woodpeckers. However, our findings of silver and tau accumulations
solely in pecking birds warrant further investigation into this possibility.
There are numerous anatomic differences between the skulls and brains of woodpeckers. It
may be that the anatomic adaptations of the woodpecker produce stress in regions of the brain
in different locations than humans. Further research is necessary to understand how our find-
ings can be translated to the human population.

 Due to the increased tau deposition in our woodpecker population, the brains of wood-
peckers are an important area for future research. Further studies are needed to determine
what iso-forms of tau are being deposited in the woodpecker brain and if these deposits are
pathological. The continued study of the response of the woodpeckers’ brain to pecking is nec-
essary to assure current head protection technology based on the woodpecker model is provid-
ing adequate protection in athletes. Our findings also suggest the woodpecker may be a
suitable animal model for the further study of CTE.
