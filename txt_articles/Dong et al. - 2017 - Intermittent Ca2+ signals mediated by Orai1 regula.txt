Abstract Ca2+ influx through Orai1 channels is crucial for several T cell functions, but a role in
regulating basal cellular motility has not been described. Here, we show that inhibition of Orai1
channel activity increases average cell velocities by reducing the frequency of pauses in human T
cells migrating through confined spaces, even in the absence of extrinsic cell contacts or antigen
recognition. Utilizing a novel ratiometric genetically encoded cytosolic Ca2+ indicator, Salsa6f,
which permits real-time monitoring of cytosolic Ca2+ along with cell motility, we show that
spontaneous pauses during T cell motility in vitro and in vivo coincide with episodes of cytosolic
Ca2+ signaling. Furthermore, lymph node T cells exhibited two types of spontaneous Ca2+
transients: short-duration ‘sparkles’ and longer duration global signals. Our results demonstrate
that spontaneous and self-peptide MHC-dependent activation of Orai1 ensures random walk
behavior in T cells to optimize immune surveillance.

Introduction
To initiate the adaptive immune response, T cells must make direct contact with antigen-presenting
cells (APCs) in the lymph node, enabling T cell receptors (TCRs) to engage peptide-bound MHC
molecules presented on the APC surface. Because cognate antigens are rare for any given TCR,
many APCs must be scanned to identify those bearing cognate antigens. Thus, optimizing T cell
motility to balance search sensitivity, specificity, and speed is crucial for efficient antigen search and
proper immune function (Cahalan and Parker, 2005; Krummel et al., 2016). Both cell-intrinsic and
environmental factors have been proposed to regulate T cell motility within lymph nodes and periph-
eral tissues (Miller et al., 2002; Bousso and Robey, 2003; Mempel et al., 2004; Mrass et al.,
2010). T cell motility in steady-state lymph nodes under homeostatic conditions, referred to as ‘basal
motility’, has been likened to diffusive Brownian motion, resembling a ‘stop-and-go’ random walk
that results in an overall exploratory spread characterized by a linear mean-squared displacement
over time (Miller et al., 2002). Subsequent studies defined a role of cellular cues in guiding T cell
migration, such as contact with the lymph node stromal cell network or short-term encounters with
resident dendritic cells (Miller et al., 2004; Baje
´noff et al., 2006; Khan et al., 2011). Whereas the
basic signaling mechanisms for cell-intrinsic induction of random motility have been previously
explored in fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells (Petrie et al., 2009), it remains unclear if such mech-
anisms apply in T cells.
Upon T cell recognition of cognate antigen, TCR engagement results in an elevated cytosolic
Ca2+ concentration that acts as a ‘STOP’ signal to halt motility and anchor the T cell to the site of
antigen presentation (Donnadieu et al., 1994; Negulescu et al., 1996; Dustin et al., 1997;

 Bhakta et al., 2005; Moreau et al., 2015). The predominant mechanism for increasing cytosolic
Ca2+ in T cells is through store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), which is mediated by the molecular
components STIM1 and Orai1. TCR stimulation triggers depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in translocation of the ER-resident Ca2+ sensor STIM1 to spe-
cialized ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions where Orai1 channels aggregate into puncta and acti-
vate to allow sustained Ca2+ influx (Liou et al., 2005; Roos et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005;
Luik et al., 2006; Vig et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006; Calloway et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2014).
Orai1 channel activity is crucial for immune function, as human mutations in Orai1 result in severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (Feske et al., 2006). Additional roles of Orai1 have been
defined in chemotaxis to certain chemokines and T cell homing to lymph nodes (Greenberg et al.,
2013); actin cytoskeleton rearrangement (Schaff et al., 2010; Dixit et al., 2011; Babich and Bur-
khardt, 2013; Hartzell et al., 2016); migration during shear flow (Schaff et al., 2010; Dixit et al.,

(Korkotian et al., 2017). However, despite their contributions to other aspects of T cell function, no
role has been identified for Orai1 channels in T-cell motility patterns underlying scanning behavior.
In this study, we use human and mouse T cells to assess the role of Orai1 and Ca2+ ions in regu-
lating basal cell motility. Expression of a dominant-negative Orai1-E106A construct was used to
block Orai1 channel activity in human T cells, both in vivo within immunodeficient mouse lymph
nodes (Greenberg et al., 2013), and in vitro within microfabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
chambers (Jacobelli, Friedman et al. 2010). We use our genetically encoded Salsa6f tandem green/
red fluorescent Ca2+ indicator (Dong et al., 2017) to monitor spontaneous Ca2+ signaling in human
T cells migrating in confined microchannels in vitro. Finally, using a transgenic mouse strain express-
ing Salsa6f homozygously in Cd4+ T cells, designated as Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) mice from here on, we
eLife digest To help protect the body from disease, small immune cells called T lymphocytes
move rapidly, searching for signs of infection. These signs are antigens – processed pieces of
proteins from invading bacteria and viruses – which are displayed on the surface of so-called
antigen-presenting cells. To visit as many different antigen-presenting cells as possible, T cells move
quickly from one to the next in an apparently random manner. How T cells are programmed to
move in this way is largely unknown.
The entry of calcium ions into cells triggers characteristic actions in many cells throughout the
body. In T cells, calcium ions enter through Orai1 proteins that form calcium channels on the cell
surface. Now, Dong, Othy et al. have asked whether calcium signals guide moving T cells as they
search for antigens.
Experiments with individual human T cells in small tubes showed that blocking the Orai1 calcium
channels caused the T cells to move faster, because the cells paused less often. The same was seen
when human T cells were transplanted into mice.
These findings suggested that calcium signals may indeed guide the T cells’ movement, but
actually being able to see the calcium signals in the cell would give a much clearer picture of what
goes on. To achieve this, Dong, Othy et al. report, in a related study, how they genetically
engineered mice to produce a calcium-sensitive reporter protein in their T cells.
Using these new transgenic mice, Dong, Othy et al. could see calcium signals in the T cells before
each of the T cell’s pauses. Further experiments showed that the calcium signals that control the
cell’s movements are triggered both by contact with the antigen-presenting cells and internally
within the T cells themselves. In another related study, Guichard et al. also conclude that contact
with antigen-presenting cells causes calcium signals that control the responses of T cells.
Seemingly random patterns of movement help T cells search for signs of infection, and these new
findings reveal a basic part of how T cells are programmed to move in this way. A deeper
understanding of T cell movement might allow this process to be controlled. In particular, this
knowledge could lead to new treatments for autoimmune diseases, in which T cells incorrectly
recognize the body’s own antigens as signs of an infection.

 show that Ca2+ signals occur in the absence of specific antigen as T cells crawl in the lymph node.
Our results indicate that Ca2+ influx, activated intermittently through Orai1 channels, triggers spon-
taneous pauses during T-cell motility and fine-tunes the random-walk search for cognate antigens.

Inhibition of Orai1 in human T cells using a dominant-negative construct
To study the role of Orai1 channel activity in T cell motility, we transfected human T cells with the
dominant-negative mutant Orai1-E106A to selectively eliminate ion conduction through the Orai1
pore. The glutamate residue at position 106 in human Orai1 forms the selectivity filter of the Orai1
pore (Prakriya et al., 2006; Vig et al., 2006; Yeromin et al., 2006), and because the Orai1 channel

 is a functional hexamer (Hou et al., 2012), mutation of E106 to neutrally charged alanine completely
inhibits Ca2+ permeation in a potent dominant-negative manner (Greenberg et al., 2013). Using
Fura-2 based Ca2+ imaging, we confirmed Orai1 channel block by E106A in activated human T cells
transfected with either eGFP-tagged Orai1-E106A or empty vector for control. Thapsigargin-induced
SOCE was greatly diminished in cells expressing eGFP-Orai1-E106A, referred to here as eGFP-
E106hi T cells, compared to empty vector-transfected control cells (Figure 1A). Ca2+ entry was also
partially inhibited in a population of transfected T cells with minimal eGFP fluorescence referred to
as eGFP-E106Alo cells. To confirm that eGFP-E106A inhibits T cell activation, we challenged trans-
fected human T cells with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with the superantigen Staphylococcal
enterotoxin B (Lioudyno et al., 2008). T cell proliferation was markedly suppressed in eGFP-E106Ahi
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not in eGFP-E106Alo T cells (Figure 1B). This shows that the residual
Orai1 channel activity in eGFP-E106Alo T cells is sufficient for T cell activation and proliferation.
Taken together, these experiments show that eGFP-tagged Orai1-E106A expression can serve as a
robust tool to assess cellular roles of Orai1 channel activity and that transfected cells without detect-
able eGFP fluorescence can be used as an internal control.
Orai1 function in human T cell motility was evaluated in vivo using a human xenograft model in
which immunodeficient NOD.SCID.b2 mice were reconstituted with human peripheral blood lympho-
cytes, followed by imaging of excised lymph nodes using two-photon microscopy (Greenberg et al.,
2013). Reconstitution has been shown to produce a high density of human immune cells within the
lymph nodes of immunodeficient mice (Mosier et al., 1988), simulating the crowded migratory envi-
ronment experienced by T cells under normal physiological conditions. Three weeks after reconstitu-
tion, human T cells were purified from the same donor, transfected, and adoptively transferred into
the reconstituted NOD.SCID.b2 mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Whereas control T cells
transfected with eGFP showed robust expression and successfully homed to lymph nodes following
adoptive transfer 24 hr post-transfection, eGFP-E106A transfected T cells did not home to lymph
nodes in the same period, consistent with our previous study indicating that functional Orai1 channel
activity is required for T cell homing to lymph nodes (Greenberg et al., 2013). To circumvent the
homing defect, we injected eGFP-E106A transfected T cells only 3 hr post-transfection, before the
expression level of eGFP-E106A had become sufficiently high to block lymph node entry
(Figure 1C).
Orai1 block increases human T cell motility within intact lymph node
To evaluate Orai1 function in T cell motility, we imaged human T cells within intact lymph nodes of
reconstituted NOD.SCID.b2 mice by two-photon microscopy (Figure 2A). We found that eGFP-
E106Ahi T cells migrated with significantly higher average velocities than co-transferred, mock-trans-
fected CMTMR-labeled T cells (Figure 2B). Although both populations had similar maximum and
minimum instantaneous cell velocities (Figure 2C), eGFP-E106Ahi T cells traversed longer distances
compared to CMTMR controls (Figure 2D), and directionality ratios, a measure of track straightness,
decayed more slowly (Figure 2E) indicating straighter paths when Orai1 channels were blocked.
Orai1-blocked cells displayed shallower turn angles than controls (Figure 2F). Furthermore, arrest
coefficients, defined by the fraction of time that cell velocity was <2 mm/min, was six-fold lower for
eGFP-E106Ahi T cells than for control T cells (Figure 2G). These differences in motility suggest that
the increase in average cell velocity caused by Orai1 block is not due to eGFP-E106Ahi T cells mov-
ing faster than control T cells, but rather due to a reduced frequency of pausing. Consistent with this
interpretation, no eGFP-E106Ahi T cells with average velocities <7 mm/min were observed, unlike
control T cells in which 23% of average velocities were <7 mm/min (Figure 2H).
To replicate our findings in a different immunodeficient mouse model, we repeated our human T
cell adoptive transfer protocol using NOD.SCID mice depleted of NK cells. Lymph nodes in these
mice are small and contain reticular structures but are completely devoid of lymphocytes
(Shultz et al., 1995). Similar to experiments on reconstituted NOD.SCID.b2 mice, eGFP-E106Ahi
human T cells in NOD.SCID lymph nodes migrated with significantly elevated average velocities
compared to control T cells (Figure 2I), and exhibited lower arrest coefficients (Figure 2J). Both
eGFP-E106Ahi and control T cells migrated at lower speeds in the NK-depleted NOD.SCID model
compared to the reconstituted NOD.SCID.b2 model. Because control human T cells in reconstituted
NOD.SCID.b2 lymph nodes migrated at similar speeds to wild-type mouse T cells in vivo
(Miller et al., 2002), reconstitution results in a lymph node environment that more closely mimics

 normal physiological conditions. Furthermore, the greater effect of Orai1 block on T cell arrest coef-
ficients in crowded reconstituted lymph nodes suggests that Orai1’s role in motility is more pro-
nounced in crowded cell environments.
Orai1 channel activity triggers pauses during human T cell motility in
vitro in the absence of extrinsic cell contact
To evaluate whether the pronounced effect of Orai1 channel block on the arrest coefficient in recon-
stituted lymph nodes was a result of environmental factors such as increased cellular contacts or
increased confinement, we tracked human T cells in microfabricated PDMS chambers with cell-sized
microchannels 7 mm high x 8 mm wide. These ICAM-1 coated microchannels simulate the confined
environment of densely packed lymph nodes (Jacobelli et al., 2010), while eliminating possible cell-
extrinsic factors. Transfected human T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/28 antibodies
and soluble IL-2, then dropped into chambers and monitored by time-lapse confocal microscopy,
using phase contrast to visualize eGFP-E106Alo T cells (Figure 3A,B). Upon entry into microchannels,
eGFP-E106Ahi T cells migrated with higher average cell velocities than eGFP-E106Alo T cells
(Figure 3C), similar to our in vivo findings from intact lymph node (Figure 2). To ensure that the
observed difference in cell velocity was due to suppressed Orai1 channel function and not overex-
pression of Orai1 protein, we also tracked T cells transfected with eGFP-tagged wild-type Orai1.
Both eGFP-Orai1hi and eGFP-Orai1lo T cells migrated at the same average cell velocity (Figure 3C),
demonstrating that Orai1 channel overexpression, in itself, does not perturb T cell motility in micro-
channels. Since eGFP-E106Alo T cells have reduced Orai1 channel activity but still retain the same
cell velocity as eGFP-Orai1 transfected T cells (c.f., Figures 1A and 3C), this suggests that partial
Orai1 function is sufficient to generate normal pausing frequency in confined environments. The fre-
quency distribution of cell velocities in vitro is comparable to our in vivo data: fewer GFP-E106Ahi T
cells migrated with average cell velocities <7 mm/min as compared to eGFP-E106Alo T cells (11% vs
29%; Figure 3D). Furthermore, eGFP-E106Ahi T cells exhibited lower arrest coefficients (Figure 3E)
and less variation in velocity than eGFP-E106Alo T cells (Figure 3F). Although eGFP-E106Ahi T cells
had lower arrest coefficients, the durations of their pauses were not significantly different than in
eGFP-E106Alo T cells (Figure 3G). Taken together, the reduced arrest coefficients in eGFP-E106Ahi
T cells indicate that inhibition of Orai1 channel activity results in reduced frequency of pauses during
T cell motility. These in vitro results confirm our in vivo findings and support the hypothesis that
Orai1 activity intermittently triggers cell arrest, resulting in an overall decrease in motility within con-
fined environments. Moreover, since our in vitro microchannel assay eliminates extrinsic cell-cell
interactions, this indicates that Orai1 can be spontaneously activated to modulate T cell motility.
Spontaneous Ca2+ signals during confined motility in vitro are
correlated with reduced T cell velocity
To study the correlation between Ca2+ signals and T cell motility, human CD4+ T cells were trans-
fected with Salsa6f, a novel genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator consisting of tdTomato fused to

 into ICAM-1 coated microchambers. As previously shown (Dong et al., 2017), Salsa6f is localized to
the cytosol, with red fluorescence from tdTomato that reflects fluctuations in cell movement and
very low baseline green fluorescence from GCaMP6f that rises sharply during Ca2+ signals (Figure 4).
Salsa6f-transfected human T cells were tracked in both confined microchannels (Figure 4A, Video 1)
and the open space adjacent to entry into microchannels (Figure 4C, Video 2), to evaluate T cell
motility under varying degrees of confinement. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were monitored simulta-
neously using the ratio of total GCaMP6f fluorescence intensity over total tdTomato fluorescence
intensity (designated as G/R ratio), enabling detection of a notably stable baseline ratio unaffected
by motility artifacts in moving T cells while reporting spontaneous Ca2+ signals that could be com-
pared to changes in motility (Figure 4B,D, orange and black traces, respectively).
Human T cells expressing Salsa6f migrating in confined microchannels exhibited sporadic Ca2+
signals as brief peaks unrelated to changes in cell velocity, or as more sustained periods of Ca2+ ele-
vation associated with reduced cell velocity (Figure 5A,B). To evaluate the correlation between T
cell velocity and Ca2+ signals, we compared average T cell velocities during periods of sustained
Ca2+ elevations to average velocities at baseline Ca2+ levels. T cell velocity decreased significantly
when cytosolic Ca2+ was elevated above baseline (5.9 ± 0.1 mm/min vs. 10.0 ± 0.1 mm/min,
p<0.0001; Figure 5C). Ca2+ signaling episodes that last for 30 s or longer accompany and appear to
closely track the duration of pauses in cell movement. Comparison of instantaneous velocities with
corresponding cytosolic Ca2+ signals (G/R ratio) by scatter plot revealed a strong inverse relation-
ship: highly motile T cells always exhibited baseline Ca2+ levels, while elevated Ca2+ levels were only
found in slower or arrested T cells (Figure 5D). It is important to note that these Ca2+ signals and
reductions in velocity occurred in the absence of any extrinsic cell contact or antigen recognition,
indicating that Ca2+ elevations, like pausing and Orai1 activation, can be triggered in a cell-intrinsic
manner.
To compare the effects of Orai1 activity on the motility of T cells in a less confined environment,
we also monitored T cell migration within the

 open space in PDMS chambers adjacent to entry into microchannels (c.f., Figure 4A,C). We rea-
soned that in this two-dimensional space with reduced confinement, T cells may not gain sufficient
traction for rapid motility, and instead may favor integrin-dependent sliding due to increased expo-
sure to the ICAM-1-coated surface (Krummel et al., 2014). In addition, the same population of T
cells could be tracked as they migrated into and along the confined microchannels, providing a valu-
able internal control. We found that eGFP-E106Ahi T cells migrated with similar velocities to eGFP-
E106Alo T cells in the open space, but these eGFP-E106Ahi T cells still exhibited higher motility in
the microchannels than eGFP-E106Alo T cells (Figure 5E). Furthermore, Salsa6f-transfected T cells
within the open space rarely produced Ca2+ transients (c.f., Figure 5D,F, top left quadrants, 13% of
the time in microchannels vs 2% in open space), implying that Ca2+ elevations, and by extension,
Orai1 channel activity, do not generate pauses when T cells are reliant on integrin binding for

 motility. Consistent with this, differentiated Th1 cells from Cd4-Salsa6f mice also showed similar
instantaneous velocities and only rare Ca2+ transients when plated on open-field ICAM-coated cov-
erslips (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Taken together, these experiments establish a role for
Orai1 channels and Ca2+ influx in modulating T cell motility within confined environments.
Spontaneous T cell Ca2+ transients during basal motility in the lymph
node
Using Salsa6f, expressed in a Cd4Cre-dependent transgenic model we have reported that mouse T
cells exhibit frequent transient Ca2+ signals (‘sparkles’) in homeostatic lymph nodes in the absence
of specific antigen (Dong et al., 2017). To further analyze the relationship between Ca2+ signaling
and motility in detail within lymph nodes, we adoptively transferred homozygotic Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom)
T cells into congenic mice and, using two-photon microscopy in explanted recipient lymph nodes,
tracked the red tdTomato signal to establish cell position and the green CGaMP6f signal as a mea-
sure of cytosolic Ca2+. First, to delineate any adverse effect of Salsa6f on homing and in situ motility
of T lymphocytes, we co-injected equal numbers of Cd4-Salsa6f and Cd4Cre control cells into WT
recipients (Figure 6A). For simultaneous imaging and to normalize any dye toxicity, Cd4-Salsa6f and
Cd4Cre T cells were labeled with CellTrace Yellow (CTY) and CellTrace Violet (CTV), respectively.
Comparable numbers of input cells were recovered from the subcutaneous lymph nodes after 18 hr
(Figure 6B). Two-photon imaging and tracking in lymph nodes showed typical stop and go motility
and meandering cell tracks (Figure 6C,D, Video 3) for both cell types. Instantaneous 3D velocities
(Figure 6E) and mean track velocities (Figure 6F) were indistinguishable, as was the decay rate of
directionality ratio (Figure 6G). Furthermore, mean-squared displacement (MSD) time analysis
showed random-walk behavior for both cell types with similar motility coefficients (Figure 6H,I).
Altogether, motility characteristics of Salsa6f T cells are indistinguishable from control T cells.
To determine whether spontaneously occurring Ca2+ signals are correlated with motility, we
transferred Cd4-Salsa6f cells alone into wild-type
recipients and tracked red and green fluores-
cence intensities in the lymph nodes after 18 hr.

 Consistent with our previous observation, adop-
tively transferred T cells retained Salsa6f indicator
in their cytosol, and Ca2+ signals were readily
observed in motile Salsa6f+ T cells (Figure 7A,
Video 4). We monitored the G/R ratios over time
and observed a strong negative correlation between instantaneous cell velocity and Ca2+ levels
(Figure 7B). By examination of fluctuating cell velocity traces with corresponding G/R ratios, we
found that the Ca2+ rise is clearly associated with a decrease in velocity (Figure 7C and D, Video 5).
Notably, on average, peaks of Ca2+ transients precede the average cell velocity minimum, suggest-
ing that spontaneous rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels leads to cell pausing (Figure 7E).
Frequency, duration and MHC dependence of T cell Ca2+ transients in
homeostatic lymph nodes
Imaging adoptively transferred T cells in recipient lymph nodes is an ideal approach to probe in vivo
T-cell motility. However, this approach is limiting when it comes to identifying the abundance and
duration of Ca2+ signaling events, because transferred cells label only a fraction of the lymph node
(<1%) and longer imaging intervals are required to collect sufficient volume of 4D data (>5 s). There-
fore, to measure the endogenous frequency and duration Ca2+ transients, we imaged homeostatic
Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) lymph nodes at two frames per second. All endogenous T cells (Cd4+ and Cd8+)
are labeled with the Salsa6f probe in Cd4-Salsa6f lymph nodes because T cells go through the dou-
ble-positive stage during development in the thymus. More than 800 Ca2+ transients were identified
in a 300 � 300 mm area in a 10-min interval. We identified two types of Ca2+ transients: numerous
small and brief spots (sparkles); and less frequent large, cell-wide transients (Figure 8A, Video 6).
Consistent with our previous report (Dong et al., 2017), most Ca2+ transients were localized to small
regions of the cell and of short duration, spanning 2 mm2 in area (Figure 8B) and lasting about 2 s
(Figure 8C). Altogether, the strong association of Ca2+ transients with reductions in cell velocity
leading to pausing, and the sheer number of Ca2+ transients in homeostatic lymph nodes suggest
that cytosolic Ca2+ is a key regulator of basal cellular motility under steady-state conditions in the
absence of specific antigen.

whereas the sparkle frequency was significantly decreased (p=0.02) in MHC-blocked lymph nodes
compared to isotype control (ITC) antibody treatment (Figure 9A,D–G). There was also significant
variation in the number of Ca2+ transients in ITC antibody and uninjected controls (Coefficient of var-
iation = 41% to 45%), which may be due to the presence of heterogeneous antigen presenting cells
displaying varying amount of self-peptides during steady-state. Most notably, however, a significant
number of Ca2+ transients remained even after MHC block, which we believe reflects a basal level of
spontaneous Ca2+ activity independent of antigen recognition. In contrast, the intensity of individual
Ca2+ transients in MHC blocked lymph nodes did not differ significantly from the ITC controls
(Figure 9B,C). Altogether, our data indicate that T cells display substantial spontaneous Ca2+ transi-
ents even in absence of self-peptide recognition, suggesting a role in regulating basal T lymphocyte
motility.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that Orai1 channel activity regulates motility patterns that underlie
immune surveillance. Human T cells expressing the dominant-negative Orai1-E106A construct
migrated with higher average velocities than controls, both in reconstituted mouse lymph nodes in
vivo and in confined microchannels in vitro. In particular, we found that the increase in average cell
velocity was not due to an increase in maximum cell velocity, but to a reduced frequency of cell
pausing accompanied by increased directional persistence, resulting in straighter paths. Human T
cells demonstrate Ca2+ transient-associated and Orai1-dependent pauses in vitro within confined
microchannels devoid of cell-extrinsic factors. Furthermore, we use a novel ratiometric genetically
encoded Ca2+ indicator, Salsa6f, along with T cells from Cd4-Salsa6f(Hom) transgenic mice, to show
that
intermittent

signals

with

Treatment
of
Cd4-
Salsa6f (Hom) mice with MHC class-I and -II blocking antibodies substantially reduces but does not
eliminate the frequent T cell Ca2+ transients seen in lymph nodes. Based on these findings, we pro-
pose that Orai1 channel activity regulates the timing of stop-and-go motility in T cells and tunes the
search for cognate antigen in the crowded lymph node.
Our Orai1-E106A construct derives its specificity and potency by targeting the pore residue
responsible for the channel selectivity filter. Incorporation of Orai1-E106A likely blocks heterodimers
of Orai1 and other channels, such as Orai2 or Orai3, in addition to homomeric Orai1 channels. Very
recent evidence demonstrates the existence of heteromeric channels composed of Orai1 and Orai2

 in T cells (Vaeth et al., 2017). These heteromers appear to simply reduce the flow of Ca2+ through
the Orai1 channel without targeting additional signaling pathways. In the absence of contradictory
evidence, we conclude that in T cells Orai1-E106A acts to produce an essentially complete functional
knockdown of Orai1-mediated store-operated Ca2+ entry.

 Human T cells exhibit systematic changes in motility behavior after Orai1 block, including:
increased average velocity, fewer pauses, increased directional persistence and decreased turn
angles, and increased motility spread over time. Importantly, maximum and minimum instantaneous
velocities are unchanged. For human T cells assessed in motility assays in vitro, similar Orai1-depen-
dent changes are seen. Altered pausing behavior caused by Orai1 block is displayed by isolated sin-
gle cells inside microchannels formed from photolithographically precise silicon master molds.
Changes in motility are dependent upon confinement, as Orai1 block alters pausing under confined
but not open-field conditions. The absence of changes to maximum and minimum velocities in vivo
and open-field motility in vitro indicates that Orai1 block is not generally deleterious for cell health
and movement, but instead acts upon subcellular mechanisms that are selectively employed during
cell motility in confined spaces. Taken together, these systematic changes caused by Orai1 block
reveal the presence of an Orai1-dependent cell motility program that is utilized frequently enough
to be easily detected by changes in the motility characteristics of T cells in the lymph node.
We used Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) mice to track Cd4+ T cell Ca2+ signals in intact mouse lymph nodes
and Salsa6f transient transfection to track Ca2+ signals in human T cells in vitro and in reconstituted
mouse lymph nodes. In our companion paper, Dong et al., 2017, we show that Salsa6f expression
in Cd4+ T cells is non-perturbing with respect to lymphocyte development, cellular phenotype, cell
proliferation, and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that homing to lymph nodes is unaffected,
as are movement patterns within the lymph node, cell velocity, directional persistence, diffusive
spread, and motility coefficient. We find that across cells, elevated Ca2+ levels are inversely corre-
lated with instantaneous velocity, both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, moving cells exhibit local Ca2+
signals that are strongly associated with pauses in motility. By inspection of movement patterns,
turning is likely associated with Ca2+ signaling events as well, but this has not been established
because most cells move outside of our shallow imaging field either before or after pausing. In many
contexts, Ca2+ signaling has been shown not only to accompany, but also to cause cell arrest and
loss of cell polarity, such as in T cells after activation by antigen (Negulescu et al., 1996;
Dustin et al., 1997; Wei et al., 2007). By averaging events, the peak of subcellular Ca2+ transients
was found to precede the velocity minimum. This event order is consistent with Ca2+ causing pauses.
While we do not show that the Ca2+ signals we observe emanate directly from Orai1 channels, taken
together our data are consistent with Orai1 actively regulating cell motility by directly inducing a
subcellular motility program that leads to cell arrest.
Two-photon imaging indicated that the frequency of Cd4+ T cells Ca2+ transients varies widely
between Salsa6f lymph nodes, even when events are normalized for different cell numbers. The ori-
gin of this variability is unclear but may result from differences in the distribution and functional
properties of APCs within the imaging field. Treatment of MHC class-I and –II blocking antibodies
substantially reduces but does not eliminate T cells Ca2+ transients. Clearly, a significant number of
Ca2+ transients are caused by T cell-APC interactions that act through MHC proteins. Given that
Orai1 motility events occur frequently as T cell migrate through the lymph node, and Ca2+ transients
are associated with pauses in motility, we propose that spontaneously generated Orai1-dependent
pauses and turns can be triggered by T cell-APC interaction through MHC proteins.
However, we find evidence for MHC-independent triggering of Ca2+ signaling and Orai1 channel
activation in the lymph node. Human T cells exhibit Orai1-dependent pauses in vitro when migrating
as isolated cells in highly uniform microchannels. Salsa6f expression independently detects Ca2+
transients in isolated T cells moving within microchannels but not in T cells in adjacent open field
portions of the same PDMS imaging chamber. In both cases, responses were produced in the

 absence of MHC proteins or APCs. Moreover, we note that, in paired experiments, treatment with
MHC class-I and –II blocking antibodies leads to a reduced but notably consistent frequency of Ca2+
signaling events. Partial block would be expected to produce substantial variation, especially when
combined with a variable input population. Taken together, these data point to the existence of not
only MHC-independent Orai1 motility events, but also cell-intrinsic triggering of Orai1. Of note, the
apparently random nature of naı
¨ve T cell movement in the lymph node has led to the hypothesis
that T cells use intrinsic and stochastic motility mechanisms to accomplish immune surveillance
(Wei et al., 2003; Mrass et al., 2010; Germain et al., 2012).
In previous studies of Orai1 signaling, Orai1 activation has been placed downstream of extracellu-
lar ligand binding to cell surface receptors, integrating their input upon use-dependent depletion of
Ca2+ from the ER (Feske, 2007; Cahalan and Chandy, 2009). While we expect signaling down-
stream of self-antigen detection to be the same as for cognate antigens (Stefanova
´ et al., 2002), at
this point it is unclear which aspects of internal cell state might lead to cell-intrinsic opening of Orai1
channels and pauses in motility. Of particular interest is determining the step in the signaling cas-
cade from phospholipase C to Orai1 that might be targeted by a novel cell-intrinsic activation path-
way. Molecular candidates that underlie regulation of T cell motility by Ca2+ are less well defined.
One clue to Orai1 action is the subcellular location of Ca2+ transients at the back T cells moving
within intact lymph nodes, similar to the localization of Orai1 channels during movement in vitro
(Barr et al., 2008). Early studies demonstrated that immobilization and rounding of T cells bound to
antigen-presenting B cells occurred via a calcineurin-independent pathway (Negulescu et al., 1996).
Ca2+-sensitive cytoskeletal proteins, such as myosin II or the actin bundling protein L-plastin, as
good candidates for downstream effectors (Babich and Burkhardt, 2013; Morley, 2013). Like
Orai1, Myosin 1 g is selectively required for motility mechanisms under confined conditions
(Ge
´rard et al., 2014). While Orai1 block reduces pausing but does not otherwise alter T cell velocity,
Myo1g block increases pausing and causes cells to move faster. These differences in phenotype sug-
gest that Orai1 and Myo1g act in different, and in part opposing, ways to control T cell motility.
Immune surveillance requires balancing many factors associated with antigen search, including
speed and sensitivity (Friedl and Weigelin, 2008; Krummel et al., 2016). As moving T cells in the
lymph node encounter APCs bearing antigen-MHC, they pause due to Ca2+-dependent mechanisms
unleashed by Orai1 channel opening. These pauses likely ensure adequate time for TCR-antigen
scanning by T cell-APC pairs. Our observations of T cell motility indicates that each T cell does not
stop at every APC it encounters. Because of this movement pattern, Orai1 provides attractive point
of regulation of immune surveillance. Increasing Orai1 activity might be expected to cause T cells to
pause more frequently when encountering APCs, restricting the distance T cells move and offering
increased opportunities for contact with nearby APCs. Alternatively, decreasing Orai1 activity leads
to fewer pauses, greater directional persistence, fewer turns, and greater overall diffusive spread. In
this way, Orai1 channel activity could tailor T cell excursions to match the density and reach of den-
dritic cells in the lymph node. Finally, our findings provide further evidence that during resting condi-
tions, TCR interactions with self-MHC antigens drive continual but limited activation of downstream
signaling pathways.
We note some differences between our study and others involving Orai1, STIM1, and T cell motil-
ity. These differences might be accounted for, in part, by the expected consequences of our Orai1
dominant-negative approach: block of all three Orai isoforms, limited time for compensatory
changes in cell function, and restriction of Orai block to T cells that are adoptively transferred after
transfection. (1) Orai1/2 and STIM1/2 KOs have been reported to home to lymph node like wild
type, unlike our results here and in a previous paper (Greenberg et al., 2013; Waite et al., 2013;
Vaeth et al., 2017). (2) Maximal T cell velocity in the lymph node requires the action of the integrin
LFA-1 and the chemokine receptor CCR7 (Davalos-Misslitz et al., 2007; Katakai et al., 2013),
which we have previously shown to be required for entry of T cells into lymph nodes and to act in an
Orai1-dependent manner (Greenberg et al., 2013). Based upon these findings, blocking Orai1
would be expected to reduce CCR7 and LFA-1 function during interstitial motility as well, resulting
in a decrease in T cell velocity. Instead, we find the opposite: Orai1 block leads to an increase in
average cell velocity. The absence of any Orai1-dependent change in maximum velocity strongly
suggests that CCR7 and LFA-1 do not act through Orai1 during motility in the lymph node. Regard-
less, any motility effects of LFA-1 and CCR7 are more than compensated by the reduction in pauses
caused by Orai1 E106A expression. (3) Previous studies using unconfined open field motility assays

 have excluded a role for Orai1 in T cell motility (Svensson et al., 2010; Kuras et al., 2012). Our
experiments confirm that Orai1 block does not detectably affect unconfined motility; in contrast, our
studies in reconstituted lymph nodes and in confined microchannels in vitro both exhibit Orai1-
dependent effects. Others have shown that confined motility in vitro better recapitulates mecha-
nisms of motility found in T cells in intact lymph nodes (Jacobelli et al., 2010; Krummel et al.,
2016).
In conclusion, we reveal the existence of an Orai1-dependent cell motility program that leads to
pausing of T cells moving within lymph nodes. Imaging with the newly developed genetically

 encoded Ca2+ indicator Salsa6f identifies local transient Ca2+ signaling events with the expected
characteristics of Orai1 Ca2+ signals. We provide evidence that Orai1-dependent pauses in T cells
are triggered in at least two different ways: by self-peptide MHC complexes displayed on the sur-
face of APCs and by a novel cell intrinsic mechanism within the T cells themselves. Together these
mechanisms generate motility patterns that promote efficient scanning for cognate antigens in the
lymph node.

obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Stock #002570 and #001303) were housed and monitored in a
selective pathogen-free environment with sterile food and water in the animal housing facility at the
University of California, Irvine. NOD.SCID.b2 mice were reconstituted with human peripheral blood
leukocytes (PBLs) as described previously (Mosier et al., 1988). A total of 3 � 107 human PBLs were
injected i.p., and experiments were performed 3 weeks later. To inhibit NK cell activity, NOD.SCID
mice were i.p. injected with 20 mL anti-NK cell antibody (rabbit anti-Asialo GM1, Wako Chemicals,
Irvine, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions 3–4 days before adoptive transfer of human T
cells. Mice used were between 8 and 18 weeks of age. The mouse strain expressing Salsa6f selec-
tively in T cells under Cd4-Cre recombinase is described in the comapanion manuscript Dong et al.,
2017. In brief, LSL-Salsa6f (tdTomato-V5-GCaMP6f) mouse strain was generated in the C57BL/6N
background, as described in the accompanying manuscript, and subsequently crossed to homozy-
gotic Cd4Cre mice (JAX #017336) to generate Cd4-Salsa6f (Het) mice expressing Salsa6f only in T
cells. These mice were further bred to generate homozygotic Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) mice for increased
Salsa6f expression and fluorescence. Age- and sex-matched C57BL/6J mice from Jackson Laboratory
(stock #000664) were used as wild-type recipients of Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) T cells. To block TCR-MHC
interactions, 2 mg of anti-MHC II (Clone Y3P) and 2 mg of anti-MHC I (Clone AF6-88.5.5.3) or 4 mg
of IgG2a Isotype control (Clone: C1.18.4) antibodies (Bio X cell) were injected into Cd4-
Salsa6f (Hom) litter mates (i.p) 48 hr before imaging.
Human T cell preparation for imaging
Human PBMCs were isolated from blood of voluntary healthy donors by Histopaque-1077 (1.077 g/
mL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) density-gradient centrifugation, and human T cells isolated using the
appropriate EasySep T Cell Isolation Kit (StemCell Technologies). Purified human T cells were rested
overnight in complete RPMI, then transfected by nucleofection (Lonza, Walkersville, MD), using the
high-viability ‘U-014’ protocol. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-tagged wild-type Orai1,
eGFP-tagged Orai1-E106A mutant, Salsa6f (tdTomato-V5-GCaMP6f construct), or empty vector con-
trol were transfected as indicated. Human T cells were used for experiments 3–48 hr after transfec-
tion. CMTMR control T cells were prepared by labeling with 10 mM CellTracker CMTMR dye
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 10 min at 37˚C. For in vivo imaging 10 million human T cells were
injected into NOD.SCID.b2 or NOD.SCID mice as indicated. For in vitro imaging experiments, T cells
were rested for 3–4 hr in complete RPMI, then washed and activated on plate-bound aCD3 and

 aCD28 (Tonbo Biosciences, San Diego, CA) in 2.5 ng/mL recombinant human IL-2 (BioLegend, San
Diego, CA), and imaged 24–48 hr after transfection.
Mouse T cell preparation for imaging
Single cell suspensions of mouse lymphocytes were prepared by mechanical dissociation of spleen
and lymph nodes and passing through 70 mm filter. Cd4+ T cells were isolated using the EasySep T
Cell Isolation Kit (StemCell Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The purity of iso-
lated cells was confirmed to be >95% by flow cytometry. To compare motility characteristics, Cd4-
Salsa6f (Hom) and Cd4Cre control cells were labeled with 10 mM CellTrace Yellow or CellTrace Violet,
respectively, for 20 min at 37˚C. To measure Ca2+ during T cell motility, unlabeled Cd4-
Salsa6f (Hom) T cells were adoptively transferred into wild-type recipients. A total of 3–10 million T
cells were injected into recipient mice in adoptive transfer experiments (i.v: tail-vein or retro-orbital).

Microchannel fabrication and imaging
Microchannel fluidic devices were fabricated by a soft lithography technique with PDMS (polydime-
thylsiloxane; Sylgard Elastomer 184 kit; Dow Corning, Auburn, MI) as described (Jacobelli et al.,
2010; Ge
´rard et al., 2014). PDMS base and curing agent were mixed 10:1 and poured onto the sili-
con master, then left overnight in vacuum. Once the PDMS was set, it was baked at 55˚C for 1 hr
and cooled at room temperature. The embedded microchambers were then cut from the mold, and
a cell well was punched adjacent to entry into the channels. The PDMS cast and a chambered cover-
glass (Nunc Lab-Tek, ThermoFisher, Grand Island, NY) were activated for 2 min in a plasma cleaner
(Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY), bonded together, then incubated at 55˚C for 10 min. Prepared cham-
bers were stored for up to 1 month before use. Prior to imaging, microchambers placed in the
plasma cleaner for 5 min under vacuum and 1 min of activation, then coated with 5 mg/mL recombi-
nant human ICAM-1/CD54 Fc (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in PBS for at least 1 hr at 37˚C.
The microchambers were then washed three times with PBS, and T cells were loaded into cell wells
(3�5 � 105 cells resuspended in 10 mL) and incubated at 37˚C for at least 1 hr before imaging.
Confocal imaging and analysis
Two different Olympus confocal microscopy systems were used to image T cells in vitro. For experi-
ments tracking T cell motility in microchambers, we used the self-contained Olympus Fluoview
FV10i-LIV, with a 473 nm diode laser for excitation and a 60x phase contrast water immersion objec-
tive (NA 1.2). The FV10i-LIV contains a built-in incubator set to 37˚C, together with a Tokai-Hit stage-
top incubator to maintain local temperature and humidity. T cells were imaged in RMPI adjusted to
2 mM Ca2+ and 2% FCS, and mounted at least half an hour before imaging to allow for equilibration.
Cells were imaged at 20 s intervals for 20–30 min, and the data analyzed using Imaris software. For
Ca2+ imaging of Salsa6f transfected T cells, we used a Fluoview FV3000RS confocal laser scanning
microscope, equipped with high-speed resonance scanner and the IX3-ZDC2 Z-drift compensator.
Diode lasers (488 and 561 nm) were used for excitation, and two high sensitivity cooled GaAsP
PMTs were used for detection of GCaMP6f and tdTomato. Cells were imaged using the Olympus
40x silicone oil objective (NA 1.25), by taking four slice z-stacks at 1.5 mm/step, at 3 s intervals, for
up to 20 min. Temperature, humidity, and CO2 were maintained using a Tokai-Hit WSKM-F1 stage-
top incubator. Data were processed and analyzed using Imaris software.

(Thermofisher C34557) and cell trace yellow (Thermofisher, C34567); 920 nm to excite tdTomato
and GCaMP6f; Fluorescence emission was split by 484 nm and 538 nm dichroic mirrors into three
detector channels, used to visualize CellTrace Violet or second harmonic signal generated from

 collagen in blue; GCaMP6f or eGFP-Orai1E106A transfected cells in green; tdTomato or CellTrace
Yellow or CMTMR-labelled cells in red. For imaging, lymph nodes were oriented with the hilum
away from the water dipping microscope objective (Olympus 20x, NA 0.9 or Nikon 25x, NA 1.05) on
an upright microscope (Olympus BX51). The node was maintained at 36–37˚C by perfusion with
medium (RPMI) bubbled with carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2). For imaging of human T cells 3D image
stacks of x = 200 mm, y = 162 mm, and z = 50 mm were sequentially acquired at 18–20 s intervals
using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For tracking adoptively transferred
mouse T cells, 3D image stacks of x = 250 mm, y = 250 mm, and z = 20 or 52 mm (Voxel size 0.48 mm
x 0.48 mm x 4 mm) were sequentially acquired at 5 or 12 s intervals, respectively, using image acquisi-
tion software Slidebook (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) as described previously (Matheu et al.,
2015). This volume collection was repeated for up to 40 min to create a 4D data set. For fast imag-
ing of Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) lymph nodes, we acquired 2DT images of 300 mm x 300 mm (pixel size 0.65
� 0.65 mm) every 0.5 s. For comparing Ca2+ transients in MHC blocking experiments, 3D image
stacks of x = 350 mm, y = 350 mm, and z = 20 mm (Voxel size 0.65 mm x 0.65 mm x 4 mm) were
sequentially acquired at 5 s intervals. Cell motility data were processed and analyzed using Imaris
software (Bitplane USA, Concord, MA). A combination of manual and automatic tracking was used
to generate highly accurate cell tracks. The x,y,z coordinates of the tracks were used to calculate
speed, M.S.D, directionality ratio, motility coefficients, and to plot tracks as described previously
(Gorelik and Gautreau, 2014; Matheu et al., 2015). Calcium transient (sparkles and cell-wide) anal-
ysis and estimation of duration was performed as described previously (Dong et al., 2017). XYT
data was processed to mask autofluorescent structures, and time was mapped on the Z axis for the
purpose of Ca2+ transient identification. Ca2+ transients were identified in Imaris by a surface-based
object identification approach, after manual thresholding of intensity, voxel size (>10) and 2 s mini-
mum duration. Objects were modeled as ellipsoids; X and Y diameter measurements of surfaces
were used to calculated areas, and Z diameter (time) was used to estimate duration of Ca2+ transi-
ents. For MHC-block experiments to estimate the number and intensities of Ca2+ transients, we uti-
lized maximum intensity projections from 6 Z stacks. Integrated intensities were normalized to
standard deviations of the green channel for comparison of brightness of Ca2+ transients.
Data analysis and statistical testing
Samples sizes were comparable to previous single cell analyses of motility (Jacobelli et al., 2010;
Greenberg et al., 2013; Ge
´rard et al., 2014). Each experiment used separate isolations of human T
cells from different donors. With the exception of instantaneous velocities in Figure 6C, each mea-
surement corresponds to a different cell. Mean ± standard error of the mean was used as a measure
of the central tendency of distributions. Video analysis was performed using Imaris software, Spots
analysis was used for tracking of cell velocity and Volumes analysis was used for measuring total fluo-
rescence intensity of GECI probes. To reduce selection bias in our analysis of motility and trajectory,
all clearly visible and live cells were tracked from each video segment. The arrest coefficient is
defined as fraction of time each cell had an instantaneous velocity <2 mm/min. The coefficient of var-
iation was defined for each individual cell as the standard deviation divided by the mean of its
instantaneous velocity. For Salsa6f imaging analysis, ratio (R) was calculated by total GCaMP6f inten-
sity divided by total tdTomato intensity, while initial ratio (R0) was calculated by averaging the ratios
of the first five time points in each individual cell trace. Photobleaching of tdTomato fluorescence
intensity (20–30% decline) was corrected in ratio calculations, as a linear function of time. Figures
were generated using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) and Origin 5 (OriginLabs, North-
ampton, MA). Due to the expectation that individual cells exhibit multiple motility modes, and to
avoid assumptions concerning the shapes of motility distributions, non-parametric statistical testing
was performed (Mann-Whitney U test, unpaired samples, two-tailed, Spearman’s rank correlation).
Differences with a p value of � 0.05 were considered significant: *p�0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.005;
****p<0.001. Similar distributions were compared using the Hodges-Lehmann median difference
value and 95% confidence intervals under the assumption that the starting distributions had similar
shapes.
