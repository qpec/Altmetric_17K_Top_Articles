SUMMARY
A lack of sufficient oligodendrocyte myelination contributes to remyelination failure in 
demyelinating disorders. miRNAs have been implicated in oligodendrogenesis; however, their 
functions in myelin regeneration remained elusive. Through developmentally regulated targeted 
mutagenesis, we demonstrate that miR-219 alleles are critical for CNS myelination and 
remyelination after injury. Further deletion of miR-338 exacerbates the miR-219 mutant 
hypomyelination phenotype. Conversely, miR-219 overexpression promotes precocious 
oligodendrocyte maturation and regeneration processes in transgenic mice. Integrated 
transcriptome profiling and biotin-affinity miRNA pull-down approaches reveal stage-specific 
miR-219 targets in oligodendrocytes and further uncover a novel network for miR-219 targeting of 
differentiation inhibitors including Lingo1 and Etv5. Inhibition of Lingo1 and Etv5 partially 
rescues differentiation defects of miR-219-deficient oligodendrocyte precursors. Furthermore, 
miR-219 mimics enhance myelin restoration following lysolecithin-induced demyelination as well 
as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, principal animal models of multiple sclerosis.

myelinogenesis and a therapeutic role for miR-219 in CNS myelin repair.
Graphical abstract
INTRODUCTION
Myelin formed by oligodendrocytes (OLs) in the vertebrate CNS insulates axons to promote 
rapid, energy-efficient action potential propagation. A failure in myelin repair after OL 
damage contributes to persistence of demyelination in debilitating diseases such as multiple 
sclerosis (MS) and leukodystrophies (Franklin and Gallo, 2014). At present, the molecular 
mechanisms that hinder OL regeneration and remyelination are not fully understood. A 
balance of opposing extracellular signaling activities and intracellular regulators has been 
shown to orchestrate OL precursor (OPC) differentiation in a spatially and temporally 
specific manner (Emery et al., 2009; Gallo and Deneen, 2014). Activation of the inhibitory 
pathways including BMP, Notch, Wnt, and Lingo1 signaling (Fancy et al., 2009; Mi et al., 
2007; Sabo et al., 2011; Ye et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009) and transcriptional regulators 
including Nfia (Glasgow et al., 2014) inhibits remyelination in animal models of MS. 
Blocking these inhibitory factors is an attractive therapeutic approach to promote myelin 
repair.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of short non-coding RNAs with ~22 nucleotides, regulate a 
multitude of biological processes by blocking translation of mRNAs through targeting their 
untranslated and coding regions (Bartel, 2009; Rigoutsos, 2009; Stefani and Slack, 2008). 
Recent studies suggests that mRNA degradation rather than translational inhibition is a 
major mechanism for miRNA-mediated target inhibition (Guo et al., 2010). By controlling 
multiple aspects of cellular development and homeostasis, including cell-fate determination 
and differentiation, miRNAs are powerful post-transcriptional regulators (Bartel, 2009; He et 
al., 2012; Inui et al., 2010). Global abrogation of miRNA maturation by deletion of Dicer1

 encoding the miRNA-processing enzyme severely compromises OL differentiation and 
myelination (Dugas et al., 2010; Shin et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2010). A cohort of miRNAs 
has been identified that modulate OL differentiation in vitro (Dugas et al., 2010; Lin and Fu, 
2009; Zhao et al., 2010). Among them, miR-219 and miR-338 are preferentially and 
abundantly expressed in mature OLs (Dugas et al., 2010; Lau et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2010). 
Both miRNAs are evolutionary conserved in vertebrate genomes from fish to humans. In 
addition, chronic MS lesions are essentially devoid of miR-219 and miR-338 (Junker et al., 
2011), suggesting a potential role for these miRNAs in the remyelination process. In vitro 
culture studies suggest that miR-219 is critical for OPC differentiation and acts through 
suppressing expression of OL differentiation inhibitors, including PDGFRα, Sox6, and 
Zfp238, predicted by computational algorithms (Dugas et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010); 
however, in vivo functions of these miRNAs and their context-specific targets remain 
elusive.
Given that many of the miRNA functions observed in vitro could not be recapitulated in 
vivo, the functions of miRNAs such as miR-219 in myelination and remyelination have not 
been defined in vivo. In addition, whether their mRNA targeting is stage dependent remains 
undetermined. Our present gain-and loss-of-function studies demonstrate a critical role for 
miR-219 in OL differentiation and remyelination in vivo. By analyzing miR-219-regulated 
transcriptome profiles and direct targets, we identify a novel miR-219-targeted inhibitory 
network. Furthermore, augmentation of miR-219 enhances myelin restoration in different 
animal models of MS including toxin-induced demyelination and experimental autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE), suggesting a therapeutic role for miR-219 in promoting myelin 
repair in demyelinating diseases in the CNS.
RESULTS
Deletion of miR-219 Genes Leads to OL Differentiation Defects in the Developing CNS
miR-219 is encoded by miR-219-1 and miR-219-2 genes, which are located on chromosome 
17 and chromosome 2, respectively, in the mouse genome. Identical mature miR-219 is 
produced from both miR-219-1 and miR-219-2. To study the function of miR-219 in vivo, 
we generated mutant mice harboring floxed miR-219-1 or miR-219-2 alleles through 
homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (Figures 1A and 1B). The floxed 
miR-219-1 and miR-219-2 mice were bred with a CAG-Cre line (Sakai and Miyazaki, 1997) 
to remove the floxed alleles in the germline and generate miR-219-1−/−, miR-219-2−/−, and 
miR-219-1/2−/−, the latter lacking both miR-219 alleles (Figures 1C–1E).
Individual miR-219-1 and miR-219-2 null mice were born at Mendelian ratios. 
miR-219-1−/−, mice were phenotypically similar to wild-type mice, whereas miR-219-2−/− 
mice developed tremors at adulthood. Strikingly, the majority of miR-219-1/2−/− double-null 
animals died around birth. In miR-219-1/2−/− double mutants, expression of miR-219 was 
essentially undetectable (Figure 1F). Deletion of miR-219-1 did not significantly alter the 
total level of mature miR-219 in the OL-enriched optic nerves, whereas the level of mature 
miR-219 was significantly reduced in miR-219-2−/− mice (Figure 1F), suggesting that 
expression from miR-219-2 is a main contributor to total miR-219 levels.

 To evaluate OL development in miR-219 single and double mutants, we examined 
expression of mature OL markers Mbp (myelin basic protein) and Plp1 (proteolipid protein) 
by in situ hybridization in the spinal cord. Mbp and Plp1 expression was comparable in 
miR-219-1−/− and wild-type mice at P0 (postnatal day 0) but was reduced in miR-219-2−/− 
mice and was further diminished in miR-219-1/2−/− mutants (Figures 1G and 1H). In 
contrast, expression of PDGFRα, a marker for OPCs, did not appear to be substantially 
altered in either miR-219 single or double mutants relative to wild-type animals (Figures 1G 
and 1I). We did not detect substantial cell death assayed by the active cleaved form of 
caspase-3 in miR-219 knockouts (data not shown), suggesting that miR-219 deficiency does 
not affect OPC formation, but inhibits their differentiation during development.
Recently, miR-219 was found to regulate neural precursor cell differentiation in zebrafish 
(Hudish et al., 2013). In contrast, we did not detect substantial alterations in expression of 
the OL specification factor Olig2, and neurogenesis-associated factors such as Pax6, Tuj1, 
and Islet1 in the developing spinal cord or brain of miR-219-1/2−/− embryos (Figure S1 and 
data not shown), indicating that miR-219 deletion does not impair neural differentiation 
substantially in the murine CNS.
miR-219 Ablation in Oligodendrocyte Lineage Cells Impairs CNS Myelination
Due to the neonatal lethality of miR-219-1/2 null mice that precludes analysis of postnatal 
myelinogenesis, we generated conditional miR-219 mutants by breeding miR-219-1fl/fl and 
miR-219-2fl/fl mice with an OL lineage-expressing Olig1-Cre line (Xin et al., 2005; Ye et al., 
2009) (Figure 2A). miR-219-1fl/fl; Olig1-Cre+/− (miR-219-1-cKO), miR-219-2fl/fl;Olig1-
Cre+/− (miR-219-2-cKO), miR-219-1/2fl/fl;Olig1-Cre+/− (miR-219-dCKO) and double-
heterozygous control (miR-219-1fl/+/2fl/+;Olig1-Cre+/−) mice were born at predicted 
Mendelian ratios. Cre-mediated excision of the miR-219-1/2fl/fl alleles efficiently abrogated 
miR-219-1/2 expression in the spinal cord (Figure 2B) assessed by qRT-PCR at P7. The 
miR-219-dCKO mice developed tremors beginning around postnatal week 3, the peak period 
of myelinogenesis, and exhibited severe seizures as well as ataxia in adulthood (Figure 2C; 
Movie S1). Most miR-219-dCKO mice died around 4 months of age (Figure 2D).
In situ hybridization analysis of the cortex, corpus callosum, and spinal cord at P7 and at 
P28 indicated that expression of Mbp and Plp1 was substantially diminished in miR-219-
dCKO mice (Figures 2E and 2F). Similarly, in the optic nerve, corpus callosum, and cortex 
of miR-219-dCKO mice at postnatal stages, there was a striking reduction in the number of 
CC1+ mature OLs (Figures 2G–2I and 2K), consistent with the expression correlation 
between miR-219 and the mature OL marker Plp1 in different CNS regions (Figure S2A). 
By contrast, the number of OPCs marked by NG2 was comparable between control and 
mutant mice (Figures 2I and 2J). We did not detect substantial alterations in the expression 
pattern of GFAP and NeuN, the markers for astrocytes and neurons, respectively, in the 
miR-219-dCKO brain (Figures S2B–S2D). The dCKO mice exhibited more severe defects in 
MBP and CC1 expression in the cortex than did single miR-219-1 or 2-cKO mice (Figure 
S2E). Consistent with the miR-219-2 null phenotype and its impact on miR-219 dosage 
(Figure 1), the miR-219-2-cKO mice also developed dysmyelination albeit to a reduced 
extent compared with miR-219-dCKO mice (Figure S2E).

 To confirm myelination deficits, we further examined myelin sheath assembly in miR-219-
dCKO mice by electron microscopy (EM). At P28, there were significantly fewer 
myelinated axons in the optic nerve and spinal white matter of miR-219-dCKO mice than 
controls (Figures 2L–2P). In addition, the myelin g ratio, which is inversely proportional to 
myelin thickness, in miR-219-dCKO optic nerves and spinal cords, was significantly higher 
than their controls (Figures 2N and 2Q). This indicates thinner myelin sheaths formed 
around the axons in the CNS of miR-219-deficient mice.
Very few mutant mice were able to survive beyond 6 months of age (Figure 2D). We 
analyzed the gross structure of myelination in these rare survivors and found that 
compromised expression of Mbp and Plp1 persisted in the cortices of miR-219-dCKO mice 
at P215 (Figure S2F). Similarly, the percentage of myelinated axons and myelin thickness in 
the mutant spinal cord remained significantly lower at P215 (Figures 2R–2T), indicating that 
myelin deficits persist throughout the lifespan of miR-219-dCKO mutant mice.
miR-338 Deletion Exacerbates the Dysmyelination Phenotype in miR-219 Mutants
Like miR-219, miR-338 is abundantly expressed in mature OLs (Dugas et al., 2010; Lau et 
al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2010). We generated mutant mice harboring miR-338 floxed alleles on 
chromosome 11 through homologous recombination. miR-338 floxed alleles were further 
removed by the germ-cell-expressing CAG-Cre line to generate miR-338−/− mice (Figures 
3A–3C). In stark contrast to the neonatal lethality observed in miR-219−/− mice, miR-338−/− 
mice were born at the normal Mendelian ratio and were phenotypically similar to wild-type 
mice. In the developing brain and spinal cord at P30, expression of OL markers MBP and 
CC1 as well as the OPC marker PDGFRα was comparable between control and miR-338−/− 
mice (Figures 3D–3F), suggesting that miR-338 is dispensable for normal OL myelination in 
the CNS.
To explore more fully the role of miR-338 in OL maturation, we then bred miR-338−/− mice 
with miR-219-dCKO mice to generate miR-219-dCKO;miR-338 triple knockout (tKO) 
mice. The level of MBP and the number of CC1+ cells in the cortices of the tKO mice were 
further reduced compared with counterparts in miR-219-dCKO mice (Figures 3D and 3E), 
despite comparable abundance of PDGFRα+ OPCs (Figure 3F). Similarly, expression of 
Mbp and Plp1 in the spinal cord was reduced in miR-219/338 tKO mice compared with 
miR-219-dCKO mice (Figures 3G and 3H). These observations suggest that miR-219 and 
miR-338 cooperate to regulate the full extent of OL maturation.
miR-219 Is Required for OL Remyelination after Demyelination
Given the essential role of miR-219 in normal myelination, we hypothesized that miR-219 is 
required for remyelination after injury. We utilized an experimental demyelinating model 
induced by injection of lysolecithin (LPC), which causes acute demyelinating injury 
followed by spontaneous myelin repair (Franklin, 2002). The myelin regeneration process 
begins with an OPC proliferation/recruitment phase approximately 7 days post LPC lesions 
(dpl 7) and a remyelinating phase around dpl 14 (Franklin, 2002). Expression of miR-219 
and miR-338 is upregulated over the remyelination phase after LPC-induced demyelination 
(Figures 4A and S3A). To address the role of miR-219 in remyelination after injury at

 adulthood, we generated an miR-219-inducible knockout by breeding miR-219-1/2lox/lox 
mice with a tamoxifen-inducible OL-expressing Plp-CreERt line (Doerflinger et al., 2003) 
carrying a Rosa26-tdTomato reporter, which labels the cells having undergone Cre-mediated 
recombination of miR-219 floxed alleles.
Tamoxifen was administered at 5 days prior to LPC injection to delete miR-219-1/2 in 8-
week old miR-219-1/2lox/lox:Plp-CreERttdTomato mice (referred to as miR-219-iKO) and 
heterozygous mice miR-219-1/2lox/+:Plp-CreERttdTomato as controls. Tamoxifen-induced 
miR-219 ablation in OLs at adult stages did not affect myelin maintenance in the spinal 
cords of miR-219-iKO mice (Figures S3B and S2C). LPC was then injected into the ventral 
white matter of the spinal cord, which was followed by administration of tamoxifen for an 
additional 5 days, and harvested at different time points (Figure 4B).
There were significantly fewer Mbp- and Plp1-expressing OLs in spinal cords of miR-219-
iKO mice at dpl 8and 15 than controls (Figures 4C and 4D). The number of PDGFRα-
expressing OPCs was higher in miR-219-iKO than in control mice at dpl 15, although OPC 
recruitment was comparable between control and iKO mice at dpl 8 (Figures 4C and 4E). 
Conversely, there were fewer CC1+ differentiating OLs in the lesions of miR-219-iKO at dpl 
15 and 21 (Figures 4F–4H). At dpl 30, CC1+ OLs in the lesions of miR-219-iKO animals 
approached but did not match those in controls (Figure 4I). The percentage of myelinated 
axons was substantially reduced in the lesions of miR-219-iKO mice at dpl 15 (Figures 4J 
and 4K). Newly generated myelin sheaths around axons as assessed by g ratios were 
significantly thinner in miR-219-iKO mice (Figure 4L). These data suggest that miR-219 is 
critical for remyelination after demyelination.
miR-219 Overexpression Promotes OL Maturation and Remyelination
To determine whether overexpression of miR-219 could promote OL maturation in vivo, we 
generated transgenic mice (miR-219-Tg) that express miR-219-2 and a GFP reporter under 
the control of an OL-expressing Cnp1 promoter (Gravel et al., 1998). Expression of 
miR-219 in the corpus callosum of these miR-219-Tg mice at P7 was approximately 3-fold 
higher in the transgenic mice than in age-matched wild-type animals, yet comparable at the 
adult stage P50 (Figure 5A). GFP was mainly detected in CC1+ OLs of transgenic mice 
(Figure 5B). Although there were very few MBP+ OLs in the cortices of wild-type mice at 
P3, we detected an extensive amount of MBP+ cells in miR-219-Tg animals (Figure 5C). 
The similar corroborating phenotypes observed in three additional miR-219-Tg transgenic 
lines (data not shown) suggest that overexpression of miR-219 promotes OL maturation.
Despite the substantially higher number of MBP+ cells in the cortex of neonatal stages, at 
the adult stage, the percentage of myelinated axons and the myelin g ratio (Figures 5D and 
5E), as well as the number of CC1+ OLs and PDGFRα+ OPCs (Figures S4A and S4B), were 
comparable between miR-219-Tg and wildtype mice, which is consistent with their 
comparable levels of miR-219 (Figure 5A). Given the similar myelination profiles between 
adult wild-type and miR-219-Tg mice, we then examined the effects of miR-219 
overexpression during myelin repair by subjecting the animals to LPC-induced 
demyelinating injury. At dpl 7, the number of PDGFRα+ OPCs and their proliferation rate in 
LPC-lesioned spinal cords was comparable between wild-type and miR-219-Tg mice

 (Figures 5F–5H). At dpl 14, we found that there were significantly more CC1+ OLs in the 
lesions of miR-219-Tg than in wild-type mice, while the number of PDGFRα+ OPCs was 
reduced (Figures 5J and 5K), and the total number of OPCs and OLs was comparable 
between control and miR-219-Tg mice (Figure 5L). Given that the transgene reporter 
expression was detected in OPCs in lesions (Figure S4C), Cnp1-driven miR-219 expression 
promotes differentiation of OPCs and Cnp1+ postmitotic OPCs in the demyelinating lesions. 
The percentage of remyelinated axons and the thickness of newly formed myelin sheaths in 
the lesions of miR-219-Tg mice were significantly higher than controls (Figure 5M–5O), 
suggesting that elevation of miR-219 levels enhances the OL capacity to remyelinate in the 
demyelinating lesion.
miR-219 Targets Stage-Specific Inhibitors to Promote OL Differentiation
Previous studies identified a few miR-219 targets using mainly target prediction programs 
that lack context specificity (Dugas et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010). To identify mRNAs 
regulated by miR-219 during OL development, we performed RNA-seq transcriptome 
profiling analysis of the optic nerve, an OL-enriched white matter tract, in control and 
miR-219-dCKO animals at P12. miR-219 deletion led to a downregulation of myelination-
regulatory genes such as Sox10, Myrf, and Zeb2/Sip1 and myelin-associated genes such as 
Cnp, Mag, and Mobp (Figures 6A and 6B; Table S1), consistent with the dysmyelination 
phenotype in miR-219-dCKO mice. Among the upregulated genes in miR-219 mutants, we 
identified previously validated miR-219 targets, including Elovl7 and Zfp238 (Dugas et al., 
2010; Zhao et al., 2010). To further identify the miR-219-targeted transcription factors, we 
analyzed the transcriptional regulatory genes upregulated in miR-219 mutants using the 
miRNA target prediction programs TargetScan and miRBase (Bartel, 2009; Grimson et al., 
2007; Krek et al., 2005). In addition, the RNAhybrid program was used to calculate the free 
energy of miRNA/target duplex formation (Rehmsmeier et al., 2004). These analyses 
support that genes encoding transcriptional regulators Etv5, Nfib, Pbx1, and Nfia are 
candidate targets of miR-219 (Figure 6C).
To determine differences in miR-219 target mRNAs as a function of differentiation stages, 
we transfected rat OPCs or differentiating immature OLs (iOL) with the miR-219 mimic or 
the control miRNA and used RNA-seq to profile transcriptomes. Gene ontology (GO) 
analysis indicated that genes downregulated in OPCs after miR-219 treatment were 
significantly associated with neurogenesis (Figure 6D), whereas those downregulated in 
immature OLs were related to mitotic cell division (Figure 6E). These observations suggest 
that miR-219 targets distinct sets of genes at different stages of OPC maturation by both 
suppressing proliferation and alternative fates of OPCs, as well as enhancing cell-cycle exit 
and terminal differentiation.
We inferred candidate miRNA target genes from opposite regulation under the ablation and 
overexpressed conditions, such that expression of the target should increase upon miRNA 
ablation and conversely decrease upon miRNA overexpression. When comparing the genes 
downregulated in miR-219-transfected OPCs with those upregulated in miR-219-deficient 
optic nerves, we identified approximately 24 common candidate targets at this OPC stage 
(Table S2), including Nfib and Nfia, which act as an inhibitor of OPC fate specification and

 differentiation (Deneen et al., 2006; Glasgow et al., 2014). In addition, the gene sets 
common between downregulated genes in miR-219-transfected iOLs under differentiation 
conditions and those upregulated in miR-219-deficient optic nerves include approximately 
67 putative miR-219 target genes (Table S3), including a transcriptional regulator Etv5, 
which is associated with the specification of astrocyte precursors (Li et al., 2012).
Overexpression of miR-219 significantly reduces expression of Nfia and Nfib in OPCs or 
Etv5 under differentiating conditions (Figure 6F). There are two predicted miR-219 binding 
sites in the 3′ UTR of Nfia, two in the coding region of Nfib, and one in the coding region 
of Etv5 (Figures S5A and S5B). We verified that miR-219 suppresses expression of these 
genes using an miRNA target reporter assay (Zhao et al., 2010) (Figure S5C). Furthermore, 
mutation of the miR-219 “seed” sequence in the putative targeted segments of these reporter 
genes abolished the miR-219-dependent inhibition of reporter gene expression (Figures S5B 
and S5C).
Nfia/b has been shown to inhibit expression of myelination-promoting genes such as Mbp, 
Olig2, and Sox10 to block OL differentiation (Fancy et al., 2012; Glasgow et al., 2014); 
however, the functions of Etv5 in OL differentiation have not been fully characterized. 
Enforced expression of Etv5 led to significant reductions in the number of mature MBP+ 
OLs among transfected OPCs (Figures S5D and S5E). Furthermore, overexpression of Etv5 
suppressed expression of myelination-associated genes, including Mbp, Plp1, Cnp, and 
Myrf, but did not affect PDGFRα or Id2 expression (Figure S5F). Conversely, knockdown 
of Etv5 led to a significant increase in the number of mature MBP+ OLs among transfected 
OPCs (Figures S5G and S5H). These observations suggest that the miR-219 target, Etv5, 
acts as an inhibitor for OPC differentiation.
miR-219 Targets and Inhibits Lingo1, an Inhibitor of OL Myelination
To identify mRNAs directly targeted by miR-219, we used a biotinylated miRNA-mRNA 
pull-down approach (Lal et al., 2011; Orom and Lund, 2007). We transfected primary rat 
OPCs with biotinylated miR-219 or cel-miR-67, a negative control, which has minimal 
sequence identity with miRNAs in mammals (Xin et al., 2012). mRNAs pulled down by 
biotinylated miR-219 or the control miRNA were subject to RNA-seq analysis (Figure S5I). 
Transcripts with both an enrichment ratio exceeding 3-fold for biotinylated miR-219 pull-
downs over input controls together with downregulation exceeding 25% in OPCs that 
overexpress miR-219 were considered candidate targets of miR-219 (Table S4). Among the 
candidate target mRNAs, we identified previously identified miR-219 targets such as 
PDGFRα and Sox6. In addition, Lingo1, which encodes a potent inhibitor of myelination 
(Mi et al., 2007), was identified as a candidate miR-219 target with the highest enrichment 
score (Table S4). Subsequent over-expression of miR-219 in OPCs confirmed that Lingo1 
was downregulated by miR-219 (Figure 6G).
Lingo1 contains two putative miR-219 binding sites within its coding region (Figure S5B). 
To validate the direct targeting of Lingo1 transcript by miR-219, we constructed a luciferase 
reporter carrying a Lingo1 cDNA segment that includes the two predicted miR-219 binding 
sites and a reporter with both seed sequences mutated. Overexpression of miR-219 
significantly reduced the activity of the reporter carrying the wild-type Lingo1 segment, and

 this effect was abolished in the reporter carrying the mutant Lingo1 segment (Figure 6H), 
suggesting that these binding sites in the Lingo1 mRNA are directly targeted by miR-219. 
We further showed that Lingo1 protein expression was substantially reduced in OPCs 
transfected with miR-219 (Figure 6I). Together with upregulation of Lingo1 in miR-219-
dCKO optic nerves (Figures 6A and 6B), our data suggest disinhibition of Lingo1 
expression in the absence of miR-219 in vivo.
Lastly, we tested whether inhibition of Lingo1 expression rescues the differentiation defects 
of miR-219-deficient OPCs. Under differentiation conditions, wild-type OPCs differentiated 
into MBP+ OLs, whereas miR-219-deficient OPCs exhibited a significantly reduced 
differentiation capacity (Figures 6K and 6L). In addition, knockdown of Lingo1 or Etv5, an 
miR-219 target in differentiating OL, using siRNAs significantly increased the formation of 
MBP+ mature OLs in miR-219-deficient cells (Figures 6K and 6L). The morphology of 
these MBP+ cells, however, reflected an intermediate stage rather that of fully mature OLs, 
suggesting that further signals are needed for complete morphologic maturation. Moreover, 
silencing of both Lingo1 and Etv5 further increased the number of MBP+ OLs with more 
elaborated processes and myelin gene expression compared with knockdown of either 
Lingo1 or Etv5 alone in miR-219-deficient OPCs (Figures 6K–6M). Thus, suppression of 
Lingo1 and Etv5 rescues, at least partially, the differentiation defects of miR-219-deficient 
OPCs, suggesting that miR-219 exerts some of its effects through lowering Lingo1 and Etv5 
levels.
miR-219 Mimic Promotes Remyelination after Lysolecithin-Induced Demyelinating Injury
To further investigate the clinical relevance of miR-219 in myelin repair, miR-219 mimic or 
control miRNA was delivered to LPC-demyelinating lesions through co-infusion. Delivery 
was demonstrated by infusion of Cy3-conjugated miRNA mimic at the time of LPC 
injection (Figure 7A). The mice were subsequently treated intrathecally with miR-219 
mimic or control miRNA once daily starting at the time of LPC injection and thereafter for 4 
consecutive days. The injured spinal cord segments were evaluated at different time points. 
We observed significantly higher levels of Mbp expression and more Plp1+ differentiating 
OLs in the lesions of the mice treated with miR-219 mimic than in those treated with control 
miRNA at dpl 8 and 14 (Figures 7B–7D). While the overall density of Olig2+ OLs was 
similar between the treatments, the number of CC1+ differentiating OLs was increased, 
whereas PDGFRα+ OPCs were reduced in the lesions treated with miR-219 mimic 
compared with controls at dpl 14 (Figures 7E–7H). As controls, we did not detect any 
significant alteration in the number of CC1+ OLs, PDGFRα+ OPCs, or apoptotic loss of 
OPCs in the vehicle-injected uninjured spinal cord of wild-type adult mice treated with 
miR-219 mimic (Figures S6A–S6C).
Ultrastructural analysis of LPC lesions indicated that the percentage of remyelinated axons 
and the thickness of newly formed myelin sheaths in the lesions of mice treated with the 
miR-219 mimic were significantly higher than in mice treated with the control miRNA 
(Figures 7I–7K). A similar demyelinating paradigm using LPC-induced demyelination in the 
corpus callosum showed that intranasal administration of miR-219 increased CC1+ OL 
numbers (Figures 7L and 7M) and MBP expression (Figures S6D–S6F), consistent with

 enhanced OL differentiation with miR-219-enriched exosome treatment in a slice culture 
(Pusic and Kraig, 2014). These observations suggest that elevation of miR-219 levels 
promotes myelin regeneration in the CNS in vivo.
miR-219 Augments the Recovery of Neurological Functions in EAE Mice
To evaluate the potential impact of miR-219 as a therapeutic agent in immune-mediated 
demyelination, we used an MOG35-55-induced EAE animal model (Bittner et al., 2014). 
This model recapitulates many clinical and pathological features of human MS, including 
inflammatory responses, progressive demyelination, and axonal loss (Bruck, 2005). Eight-
week-old female C57BL/6 mice immunized with MOG35-55 were treated with control 
miRNA and miR-219 mimic via intrathecal administration starting at post-immunization day 
(PID) 19, when symptoms indexed by mean EAE clinical score peaked. The control-treated 
mice exhibited chronic hindlimb paresis over the treatment period (Figure 8A). In contrast, 
the animals treated with miR-219 mimics exhibited a significant improvement in motor 
function, regaining use of both hind limbs (Figure 8A). Functional recovery in miR-219-
treated mice was correlated positively with histological improvements, including restoration 
of MBP expression in the lesions of lumbar spinal cords, which exhibit the prominent 
demyelinating lesions in EAE (Lin et al., 2013), and reduction of the demyelinated regions 
(Figures 8B, 8C, and S7A). The histological and functional improvements appear to be at 
least in part due to the presence of a higher number of CC1+ or Plp1+ OLs in the spinal 
lesions from miR-219-mimic-treated mice than in controls (Figures 8D–8G). In addition, 
there was a significant increase in the percentage of remyelinating axons in the 
demyelinating lesions in miR-219-mimic-treated mice (Figure 8H–8J). Furthermore, in 
contrast to the prominent axonal loss, axons labeled by Neurofilament M were largely 
preserved in the spinal lesions of animals treated with miR-219 mimics (Figure 8K). 
miR-219 mimic treatment did not have a noticeable effect on the number of Iba1+ microglia/
macrophages and CD3+ T cells (Figures 8L–8N), as well as MHCII+ M1 microglia, CD19+ 
B cells, and Ly6G+ neutrophils in the lesions (Figures S7B–S7D). In addition, qPCR 
analysis showed that miR-219 mimic treatment did not significantly change the expression 
of immune cytokines in the lumbar spinal cords of EAE mice (Figure S7E). Thus, these data 
suggest that miR-219 mimic acts as a remyelination-promoting agent to improve the clinical 
symptoms of EAE.
DISCUSSION
miRNAs as Cell-Intrinsic Regulators of Myelination and Remyelination in the CNS
The absence of effective treatments to counter OL differentiation blocks presents a 
significant hurdle for remyelination in demyelinating diseases such as MS. Functional 
dissection of the contributions of small non-coding miRNAs will provide opportunities to 
safely deploy them as targeted therapeutic agents. In this study, through in vivo targeted loss 
and gain-of-function studies, we demonstrate that miR-219 is both necessary and sufficient 
to promote OL myelination and remyelination after demyelination, and further reveal 
cooperation between miR-219 and miR-338 in OL maturation. Integrative analysis of 
transcriptome profiles surveying miR-219-regulated genes and direct binding targets uncover 
stepwise miR-219-mediated silencing in driving OL maturation. Remarkably, although loss-

 of-function mutation of most individual miRNAs yields no overt developmental defects in 
multiple organisms (Miska et al., 2007), the essential role of miR-219 in myelination 
indicates that miR-219 plays a central role in rather than just fine-tuning myelinogenesis. 
Our findings further highlight the importance of miR-219-mediated post-transcriptional 
regulation for myelin repair in the CNS.
Our data indicate that individual miR-219-1 and miR-219-2 diverge in their ability to 
compensate for each other’s loss despite generating the same mature miRNA. Consistent 
with the higher abundance of miR-219-2, we find that deletion of miR-219-2 causes 
myelination deficits, whereas the absence of miR-219-1 has minimal impact on myelination, 
indicating a divergent and dose-dependent effect. The miR-219-1/2 null animals exhibit 
neonatal lethality, implying that miR-219 might also regulate other essential cellular 
processes or organismal homeostasis in addition to its function in OL development.
miR-219 deletion in Plp1-expressing differentiating OLs caused a defect in remyelination in 
response to LPC-induced demyelinating injury. miR-219 is mainly expressed in 
differentiating OLs with a low expression level in OPCs (Dugas et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 
2010), the potential function of miR-219 in OPC development and remyelination remains to 
be determined by utilizing PDGFRα+ OPC-specific Cre lines. Consistent with the fact that 
miR-219 overexpression in Cnp1+ postmitotic OPCs or immature OL promoted precocious 
OL maturation during early postnatal development, remyelination efficiency was enhanced 
considerably in miR-219-Tg mice, suggesting that augmentation of miR-219 levels 
accelerates the onset of the remyelination process.
The dysmyelinating phenotype appears to be more severe in Dicer1-cKO mice (Zhao et al., 
2010) than in miR-219-dCKO mice, suggesting that other miRNAs may yet coordinate with 
miR-219 to regulate myelination. A possible explanation for this observation may be due to 
the partial functional redundancy of miR-219 and miR-338. Both are abundant in OLs and 
regulate a set of differentiation-inhibiting genes such as Sox6 and Hes5 (Dugas et al., 2010; 
Zhao et al., 2010). We showed that mice deficient in both miR-338 and miR-219 have a 
more severe dysmyelination phenotype than the miR-219-dCKO mutant, suggesting that 
miR-338 and miR-219 have additive effects on OL differentiation and are required for the 
full extent of myelination.
Stage-Specific Targeting of Differentiation Inhibitors by miR-219 Drives OL Maturation
Previous miR-219 target identification efforts relied mainly on bioinformatics for predictions 
(Dugas et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010). Such algorithms have a high false discovery rate 
(Alexiou et al., 2009). Cell type and temporally specific miRNA targets cannot be identified 
using predictive methods. By analyzing transcriptome profile changes caused by miR-219 
deletion in optic nerves and by miR-219-overexpression in OPCs and differentiating OLs, 
we showed that miR-219 targets neurogenic genes or OL differentiation inhibitors such as 
Nfia, Nfib, and Lingo1 in OPCs and Etv5 in differentiating OLs. These observations suggest 
that miR-219 targets distinct sets of genes at different stages to promote OL lineage 
progression.

 Identification of Nfi family members as functional targets of miR-219 is consistent with 
their inhibitory roles in OL differentiation (Deneen et al., 2006; Fancy et al., 2012; Glasgow 
et al., 2014). Strikingly, we identify a new miR-219 target, Etv5, during OPC differentiation. 
Etv5 is a member of the Ets family of transcription factors that are necessary for gliogenesis 
in Drosophila, Xenopus, and mice (Kiyota et al., 2007; Klaes et al., 1994; Li et al., 2012). 
Here, we showed that downregulation of Etv5 enhances OL differentiation, whereas Etv5 
overexpression repressed OPC differentiation in vitro, suggesting that Etv5 is an inhibitor of 
OL differentiation. There is no significant alteration in expression of Etv5 upstream 
regulators such as Mek (Map2k) (Li et al., 2012) and its family members (Map2k1-7) in 
miR-219 dCKO mice (data not shown). Furthermore, direct affinity purification of OPC 
mRNAs that interact with biotin-tagged miR-219 identified a set of miR-219 targets 
including Lingo1, which had not been identified as an miR-219 target based on 
computational approaches. Inhibition of expression of both Lingo1 and Etv5 using siRNA 
improved the maturation of miR-219-deficient OPCs, with inhibition of both more effective 
than inhibition of either alone. Thus, stage-specific miR-219-mediated antagonism of a 
Lingo1-Etv5 inhibitory network drives proper timing of OL lineage cell progression.
Par-3 family cell polarity regulators Pard3 and Prcki were identified as targets of miR-219 in 
zebrafish (Hudish et al., 2013). In transcriptome profiles of miR-219-dKO optic nerves, 
however, we did not detect a substantial alteration in Pard3 or Prcki expression (data not 
shown). In addition, OL lineage-specific knockout of Par3 floxed alleles (Castelli et al., 
2013) by Olig1-Cre did not yield a detectable alteration in myelination (Figure S8), 
suggesting a non-essential role of Par3 in OPC differentiation in mice. These observations 
suggest that miR-219 targeting is context or species dependent.
miR-219 Targets Differentiation Inhibitory Pathways and Lingo1 for Remyelination
In MS lesions, OPCs are recruited but fail to differentiate into myelinating OLs, suggesting 
that remyelination is blocked at the differentiation and remyelination stage rather than 
during OPC recruitment (Chang et al., 2002; Kuhlmann et al., 2008; Wolswijk, 1998). Our 
in vivo gain- and loss-of-function studies demonstrate that miR-219 is both essential and 
sufficient for timely remyelination, which is critical for functional recovery as chronic 
demyelination predisposes to axonal loss in MS. Moreover, delivery of miR-219 mimics into 
the demyelinating lesions through intrathecal injection or intranasal delivery enhanced CNS 
remyelination in animal models of demyelinating diseases. We further provide evidence that 
the miR-219 directly targets and inhibits expression of Lingo1, a potent inhibitor of 
remyelination (Mi et al., 2007). The partial rescue of the differentiation defect in miR-219-
null OPCs by inhibition of Lingo1 expression with siRNAs further supports a critical role 
for miR-219 targeting of Lingo1 in regulating OL differentiation.
During development, expression of a miR-219 target PDGFRα (Dugas et al., 2010; Zhao et 
al., 2010) was unaltered in miR-219-null animals while PDGFRα+ OPCs increased in the 
LPC-induced lesions of miR-219-deficient animals during the remyelination phase (Figure 
4). Given that miR-219 is mainly expressed in differentiated OL during development and 
adulthood (Dugas et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010), these observations suggest that regulation 
of PDGFRα expression by miR-219 is context specific, consistent with the notion that

 miRNAs play a critical role especially under pathologic conditions such as injury and stress 
(Leung and Sharp, 2010; Mendell and Olson, 2012). Since injury stimulates OPC 
proliferation, it may lead to the accumulation of OPCs, which could undergo apoptosis if 
they are unable to differentiate. The elevation of miR-219 expression in the accumulated 
OPCs in demyelinating lesions (Figure S4C) likely down-regulates PDGFRα and promotes 
OPC differentiation. Although there is a possibility that miR-219 overexpression may 
potentially reduce the OPC pool, our data suggest that miR-219 likely promotes the 
differentiation of postmitotic OPCs without significantly intervening OPC proliferation 
during the proliferation phase after injury.
Functional recovery in MS patients will likely hinge on the therapies that promote myelin 
regeneration (Deshmukh et al., 2013; Franklin and Gallo, 2014). Chronic human MS lesions 
are essentially devoid of miR-219 and miR-338 (Junker et al., 2011). Our present studies 
demonstrate that in vivo delivery of miR-219 enhances OL remyelination not only following 
toxin-induced acute demyelination but also in immune-mediated chronic demyelination in 
EAE and improves clinical symptoms in the animal model of MS, indicating the efficacy of 
miR-219 in myelin repair. At present, we could not exclude the possibility that indirect 
miR-219 effects on inflammatory cell functions or trafficking, or on the remyelination-
independent paracrine glial support of denuded axons, may contribute to functional 
improvement in EAE mice. Although the OL cell-autonomous function of miR-219 in EAE 
remains to be determined, the converging outcomes between the LPC-induced and EAE 
demyelinating animal models suggest the effects of OL-expressing miR-219 on 
remyelination contribute at least partially to functional improvement. miRNA-based 
therapeutics have an advantage over antibody therapy such as anti-Lingo1 as miRNAs are 
more stable (Cho, 2012; Vicente et al., 2016). Since miR-219 targets multiple myelin 
inhibitory factors in addition to Lingo1, it is conceivable that the augmentation of miR-219 
together with other antagonists to myelination inhibitors may provide a multi-point targeting 
strategy to achieve desired pharmacological effects on promoting timely remyelination in 
patients with demyelinating diseases such as MS.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animals—To generate floxed miRNA mutant mice, we inserted two loxP sites to flank the 
miR-219-1, miR-219-2 or miR-338 gene region, followed by a neomycin selection and DTA 
cassette, in the pKO-915 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The targeting vector was 
linearized with NotI and electroporated into mouse J1 embryonic stem cells. G418-resistant 
cells were selected and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. To generate miR-219 
transgenic mice, a 500-bp segment carrying miR-219-2 gene together with a C-terminal 
IRES-GFP was inserted after a 4.0-kb Cnp1 promoter (Gravel et al., 1998), which replaces 
Mbp promoter in the pMG2 vector. All viable founder mice appeared to be fertile and 
produced similar phenotypes. The data presented are derived from the progeny of a single 
transgenic line. Mice carrying floxed miR-219 or miR-338 alleles were bred with the CAG-
Cre line to generate miRNA null mice. miR-219, miR-338, or Par3 floxed lines (Castelli et 
al., 2013) were crossed with Olig1-Cre+/− mice (Xin et al., 2005) to generate miR-219-cKO 
and their heterozygous control mice. PLP-CreERt transgenic mice (Doerflinger et al., 2003) 
and Rosa26tdTomato reporter mice (Ai14, JAX Labs) were crossed with floxed miR-219 mice 
to generate the OL-specific miR-219-iKO mice. Animals of either sex were used in the study 
and littermates were used as controls unless otherwise indicated. The mouse strains in this 
study were generated and maintained on a mixed C57Bl/6;129Sv background and housed 
(three or less animals per cage) ina vivarium with a 12-hour light/dark cycle. All animal 
studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the 
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, USA.
Cell Culture—Primary rat OPCs were isolated from cortices of pups at P2 using a 
differential detachment procedure as previously described (Zhao et al., 2016). Isolated rat 
OPCs were grown in OPC growth medium (Sato medium-supplemented mitogens 10 ng/ml 
PDGF-AA and 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor), and differentiated in OL 
differentiation medium (Sato medium only or supplemented with 15 nM triiodothyronine

 and 10 ng/ml ciliary neurotrophic factor). Mouse OPCs were isolated from P5-P6 cortices 
by immunopanning with antibodies against Ran-2, GalC and O4 sequentially as previously 
described (Zhao et al., 2016). The isolated mouse OPCs were cultured in the Growth 
Medium plus B27, 1 ng/ml NT3, and 5 mM forskolin (Emery et al., 2009).
METHOD DETAILS
Tissue Processing, Histology, and Imaging—Mice at various developmental stages 
were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and perfused with PBS followed by 4% 
paraformaldehyde. Spinal cords or brains were dissected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 
overnight, cryoprotected in 25% sucrose at 4°C, embedded in OCT and cryosectioned at 16 
μm. For immunostaining, we used antibodies to PDGFRα (BD Bioscience, 558774), anti-
Olig2 (Millipore, AB9610), CC1 (Calbiochem, OP80), MBP (Santa Cruz, sc-13914), NeuN 
(Millipore), GFAP (Sigma, G3893), NG2 (Millipore ab5320), Neurofilament M (Millipore, 
AB1987), CD3 (BioLegend, 100212), Iba1 (Wako, 019-19741) and Lingo1 (Millipore, 
07-768), MHCII (BioLegend, 107606), Ly6G (BioLegend, 127606), CD19 (BioLegend, 
101504). The fluorescence images in the corresponding CNS regions between control and 
mutants were acquired under a Nikon E-C2 confocal microscope and quantified in a double-
blinded manner by ImageJ. Images from at least five sections per animal were collected for 
analysis. For immunoblotting, whole cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer 
(ThermoFisher Scientific; cat# 89900) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail 
(1:200, Sigma-P1860). After western blotting, proteins were detected with appropriate 
secondary antibodies by using chemiluminescence with the ECL kit (Pierce) according to 
manufacturer’s instructions. For electron microscopy, spinal cord and optic nerves were 
dissected and fixed in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate 
buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 hr and processed as previously described (Xin et al., 2005). RNA in 
situ hybridization was performed using digoxigenin-labeled PDGFRα, Plp1/Dm-20, and 
Mbp riboprobes as described previously (Zhao et al., 2010).
siRNA Transfection—siRNA transfection in primary OPCs were carried out by 
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). siRNAs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with 
the following catalogue numbers: control siRNA: MISSION siRNA Universal Negative 
Control #1 SIC001; mouse Lingo1 siRNA, SASI_Mm01_00137609; Mouse Etv5 siRNA, 
SASI_Mm01_00026515, rat Lingo1 siRNA, SASI_Rn02_00324112; rat Etv5 siRNA, 
SASI_Rn02_00225316. Rat OPCs were transfected with expression vectors, pCIG, pCIG-
Nfib and pCIG-Etv5, by using Nucleofector (Lonza) according to manufacturer’s protocol. 
OPCs were transfected with expressing vectors using Amaxa electroporator according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol and assayed for immunocytochemistry and qRT-PCR analysis.
RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR—Total RNAs were purified from tissues or cell cultures 
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was 
transcribed to cDNA with the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-rad, Cat # 170-8890). 
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector 
System (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems), and the relative gene expression was 
normalized to an internal control such as Gapdh or U6. Stem-loop RT-PCR was used for the

 quantification of mature miR-219 expression levels as described previously (Zhao et al., 
2010).
Luciferase Reporter Assays—miR-219 locus on chromosome 2 with their ~200 bp 
flanking sequences were amplified by PCR from mouse genomic DNA and inserted into 
pCIG vector (Zhao et al., 2010). Segments carrying putative miR-219 binding sites in 3 
coding regions and 3′ UTRof Nfia, Nfib, Etv5 and Lingo1 were cloned into pMIR-REPORT 
vector (Ambion, AM5795) as described previously (Zhao et al., 2010). For mutagenesis of 
miR-219 binding sites, two predicted binding sites in pMir-reporter-Nfia UTR, pMir-
reporter-Nfib CD, pMir-reporter-Etv5 CD&UTR, and two predicted binding sites in pMir-
reporter-Lingo1 UTR from “ACAATC” to “CTGCAG” respectively, were created by using 
GenEdit Site-Directed DNA Mutagenesis Kit (FirstBiotech Cat # 201321). Luciferase 
reporter constructs were co-transfected with vectors expressing miR-219 into 293T cells by 
PolyJet. The pCMV-LacZ plasmid was included as a control for transfection efficiencies. 
Luciferase activity was assayed 48 hr after transfection using the bright-Glo reporter assay 
system (Promega, E2610) and FluoReporter lacZ/Galactosidase Quantitation Kit (Life 
Technologies, F-2905).
LPC-Induced Demyelinating Lesions—6- to 8-week-old miR-219-1lox/lox, 
miR-219-2lox/lox, Rosa2tdTomato, Plp-CreERt mice and miR-219-1lox/+, miR-219-2lox/+, 
Rosa2tdTomato, Plp-CreERt control mice, wild type and miR-219 transgenic mice were used 
in the lysolecithin-induced demyelination experiments. Anesthesia was induced and 
maintained by i.p. injection of a mixture of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). 
After exposing the spinal vertebrae at the level of T9-T12, meningeal tissue in the 
intervertebral space was cleared, and the dura was pierced with a dental needle. 0.5 μl of 1 % 
lysolecithin (l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine, Sigma L4129) via a Hamilton syringe attached a 
glass micropipette was injected into the ventrolateral white matter using a stereotactic 
apparatus. LPC-induced lesions in brain were stereotactically performed to the genu of 
corpus callosum. Injuries were conducted in a genotype-blinded manner. For tamoxifen 
treatment of Plp-CreERt-miR-219-1/2lox/lox mice, tamoxifen (Sigma T5648) was dissolved 
in corn oil (Sigma, C-8267) and injected intraperitoneally at 50 mg/kg body weight (Sigma). 
Tissues carrying the lesions were collected at different time points.
miRNA Mimic Administration—miRVana miRNA Mimic Negative Control or miR-219 
mimic (100 μM; Life Technologies) was mixed with the transfection reagent, i-Fect 
(Neuromics, NI35150), which allows efficient delivery of miRNAs in vivo, in a ratio of 1:5 
(w:v), containing 1% lysolecithin and injected into the ventral white matter of 6- to 8-wk-old 
wild-type mice. Control or miR-219 mimic with i-Fect mix (10 μl each mouse) were 
delivered to the lumbar region of the spinal cord via the intrathecal catheters essentially as 
previously described (Njoo et al., 2014). Injections were performed daily after spinal cord 
injury until the mice were euthanized for tissue harvest. For intranasal delivery of miRNA 
mimic, mice were intranasally administered with control and miR-219 mimics. 14 μl of 
control and miR-219 mimics were administered over a 20 min period at a rate of 2 ml per 
minute to alternating nostrils. 8 days later, animals were harvested, their brains were 
sectioned and processed for histology and immunohistochemistry.

 Biotin-miRNA Pull-Down Assays—Rat OPCs were transfected with biotin-tagged 
miR-219 mimics or control cel-miR-67 (Dharmacon) at a final concentration of 40 nM using 
Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Tech). Forty-eight hours later, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer 
[20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Igepal, 60 U Superase-In/ml 
(Ambion, AM2694), 1 mM DTT, 1 × Pefabloc (Sigma)]. The streptavidin-agarose beads 
(GE Healthcare, 17-5113-01) were incubated with cell lysate at 4 °C for 1 hour followed by 
washing with lysis buffer. Total mRNAs bound to the streptavidin beads were extracted by 
using TRIzol LS (Invitrogen). The pull-down mRNA level was quantified by mRNA-seq. 
The total mRNA from OPC transfected with biotin-tagged miR-219 mimics or control cel-
miR-67 (Dharmacon) as input was quantified by mRNA-seq. The enrichment ratio was 
calculated, [miR-219/Ctrl (Pulldown)]/[miR-219/Ctrl (Input)] (Lal et al., 2011).
RNA-seq and Data Analysis—The RNA isolated from the optic nerves of P12 control 
and miR-219-dCKO mice, the RNA from rat OPC culture transfected with control miRNA 
and miR-219 mimic, and the RNA from biotin-tagged miR-219 mimics or control cel-
miR-67 pull down assays subject to mRNA deep sequencing. RNA-seq libraries were 
prepared using the Illumina RNA-Seq Preparation Kit and sequenced by a HiSeq 2000 
sequencer (Illumina). All RNA-Seq data from mouse samples were aligned to mm9 and data 
from rat samples were aligned to Rn4 using TopHat with default settings (http://
tophat.cbcb.umd.edu). TopHat output data were analyzed by Cufflinks to estimate FPKM 
values for known transcripts and to analyze differentially expressed transcripts. A heatmap 
of gene expression was generated using R language (http://www.r-project.org). GO-analysis 
of genes repressed in miR-219 mimic transfected OPC and differentiating OL was 
performed using Toppfun (https://toppgene.cchmc.org/enrichment.jsp).
EAE Immunization and Histological Assessment—8-week-old female C57BL/6 
(Charles River lab) mice received injections of 200 μg of myelin oligodendrocyte 
glycoprotein (MOG) 35–55 peptide emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant (BD 
Biosciences), supplemented with 600 μg of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strain H37Ra; BD 
Biosciences). 24 and 72 hour after immunization, mice were given two intraperitoneal 
injections of 400 ng of pertussis toxins (List Biological Laboratories, Cat#NC9675592). 
EAE onset was monitored daily and scored with Clinical scores (0 =healthy; 1=flaccid tail; 2 
= ataxia and/or paresis of hindlimbs; 3 = paralysis of hindlimbs and/or paresis of forelimbs; 
4 = tetraparalysis; 5 = moribund or death). Once disease symptoms peaked (day 19; clinical 
score ~3) they were randomized into 2 treatment groups, control microRNA mimic and 
miR-219 mimic was delivered to the lumbar region of the spinal cord via intrathecal 
administration daily for 5 days. Animals were scored daily while experimenters were 
blinded to the identity of the treatments, and a two-tailed Student’s t test was used to 
compare each treatment.
Histological assessment of lesioned spinal cords was performed as previously described (Lin 
et al., 2013). Briefly, serial cross-sections along the length of the spinal cord from the 
lumbar 2 to lumbar 4 segment in EAE mice were cut at 16 μm and used for lesion volume 
and cell density measurement and calculation. Every 10th section in the series was stained 
with appropriate antibodies or labeled with in situ probes. The immunopositive or labeled

 cells within the anterior funiculus medially next to the anterior median fissure in the lumbar 
spinal cord in each section were measured and counted by NIH Image J software (http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Cell density in the lesions from the serial sections of each spinal cord 
was calculated and confined to a volume of 0.001 mm3. The average percentage of 
demyelinated area without MBP immunofluorescence over the total white matter area in the 
lumbar spinal cord in every section was measured by Image J and calculated for statistical 
analysis. The quantitative analyses were performed in a blinded manner to the experimental 
groups.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All data analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 6.00 (San Diego, California, 
www.graphpad.com). Data are shown as mean ± S.E.M. Animals of the same genotype and 
age exhibited very similar phenotypes. Littermate controls minimized any difference 
imparted by background. Quantifications were performed from at least three independent 
experiments and quantified blindly. Tests assumed a normal distribution. For cell-based and 
gene expression assays as well as phenotypic analysis, no statistical methods were used to 
predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those generally employed in 
the field. For the miR-219 treatment study in mice, animal groups were randomized during 
treatment. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired Student’s t test between 
two groups. One-way ANOVA was performed with multiple comparisons or pairwise 
comparisons following Tukey’s ranking tests when comparing multiple groups. p < 0.05 is 
considered to be statistically significant.

 In Brief
Wang et al. show that miR-219 collaborates with miR-338 and is required for proper 
oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in the mammalian CNS by targeting a 
network of stage-specific differentiation inhibitors, including Lingo1 and Etv5. 
Therapeutic delivery of miR-219 also enhances myelin repair in animal models of 
multiple sclerosis.
