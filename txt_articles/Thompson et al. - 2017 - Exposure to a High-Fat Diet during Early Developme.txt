Perinatal exposure to maternal obesity and high-fat diet (HFD) consumption not only 
poses metabolic risks to offspring but also impacts brain development and mental 
health. Using a non-human primate model, we observed a persistent increase in anxiety 
in juvenile offspring exposed to a maternal HFD. Postweaning HFD consumption also 
increased anxiety and independently increased stereotypic behaviors. These behavioral 
changes were associated with modified cortisol stress response and impairments in the 
development of the central serotonin synthesis, with altered tryptophan hydroxylase-2 
mRNA expression in the dorsal and median raphe. Postweaning HFD consumption 
decreased serotonergic immunoreactivity in area 10 of the prefrontal cortex. These 
results suggest that perinatal exposure to HFD consumption programs development 
of the brain and endocrine system, leading to behavioral impairments associated with 
mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders. Also, an early nutritional intervention 
(consumption of the control diet at weaning) was not sufficient to ameliorate many of 
the behavioral changes, such as increased anxiety, that were induced by maternal HFD 
consumption. Given the level of dietary fat consumption and maternal obesity in devel-
oped nations these findings have important implications for the mental health of future 
generations.

Developed nations have experienced a surge in the prevalence of both maternal obesity and pedi-
atric neurodevelopmental disorders. In the United States, 64% of women of reproductive age are 
overweight, 35% are obese (1), and the majority of the population consumes excess dietary fat. The 
prevalence of obesity in pregnant women is particularly concerning, as the intrauterine and early 
postnatal environments are known to have a long-term impact on both the physiology and behavior 
of offspring. Early development is a sensitive period in which epigenetic changes can result in perma-
nent alterations of behavioral and physiological processes. Given the prominent role that maternal

nutrition and energy status play in regulating reproductive 
 
physiology, factors such as food availability, diet quality, and body 
weight are prime candidates for initiating epigenetic influences 
on offspring behavior and physiology. In epidemiologic stud-
ies, maternal obesity is associated with future risk of increased 
offspring Body Mass Index (BMI) (2), adiposity (3, 4), and 
metabolic disorders (3). Furthermore, maternal obesity and con-
sumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) are associated with increased 
future risk of mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders 
(5, 6), such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
(5, 7, 8) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (9–11). Maternal 
obesity is also associated with childhood affective problems, 
such as increased risk of fear, sadness, and internalizing behavior 
 
(8, 12), and is correlated with low or high birth weight which are 
linked to anxiety and depression during adolescence (13). Both 
non-human primate (NHP) and rodent studies demonstrate that 
chronic maternal HFD consumption produces long-term altera-
tions in offspring’s anxiety-related behaviors (6, 14).
It is challenging to study maternal diet in human participants 
due to difficulty in accurately monitoring food intake, and 
ethical issues related to manipulating the diet of pregnant women. 
Animal models have the advantage of investigator control 
over diet composition and elimination of many confounding 
genetic and environmental factors. Therefore, well-controlled 
animal studies are essential for exploring the specific effects of 
maternal diet and metabolic status on offspring behavior. NHP 
models are advantageous as they have complex social and mental 
health-related behaviors, similar developmental ontogeny of the 
brain and placental structure, and develop the full spectrum of 
metabolic disease consistent with humans. Using a NHP model 
of maternal HFD consumption, our group has shown that 
intrauterine overnutrition negatively impacts fetal development, 
resulting in increased activation of inflammatory cytokines in the 
placenta (15) and hypothalamus (16), decreased pancreatic α-cell 
plasticity (17), and abnormal development of the melanocortin 
system (16). We also documented changes in histone deacetylase 
activity in the liver of HFD offspring leading to decreased SIRT1 
protein levels (18), suggesting NHP offspring are vulnerable to 
inflammation-induced epigenetic changes.
Our group further demonstrated perturbations of the NHP 
serotonergic system in the fetal brain and increased anxiety in 
infant female offspring from mothers consuming a HFD com-
pared to infants exposed to a control diet (6). The purpose of 
the current study was to determine if these early alterations in 
behavior and brain development persist later in life. A second 
goal was to determine if an early intervention to a healthy diet 
at weaning would ameliorate maternal HFD-induced changes 
in behavior and brain development. In this study, we dem-
onstrate that maternal and postweaning HFD consumption 
results in behavioral changes, including an increase in anxiety, 
that persist into the juvenile time period. These behavioral 
changes were associated with alterations in plasma and hair 
cortisol and impaired development of the central serotonin 
system, such as altered tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) 
mRNA expression in the dorsal (DR) and median raphe (MnR) 
and reduced serotonin positive fibers in the medial prefrontal 
cortex (PFC). Importantly, this is the first study to examine 
the long-term impact of HFD exposure during development on 
behaviors related to psychopathology in a NHP species.

animals
All animal procedures were in accordance with National 
Institutes of Health guidelines on the ethical use of animals and 
were approved by the Oregon National Primate Research Center 
(ONPRC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. An in-
depth characterization of the maternal (19) and juvenile (17, 20) 
phenotype has been previously reported.
Dietary Information
Macronutrient composition of the control diet (CTR) (Monkey 
Diet no. 5000; Purina Mills) and the HFD (TAD Primate Diet no. 
5LOP, Test Diet, Purina Mills) are provided in Table 1. The diets 
has also been described comprehensively in previous publications 
(21). Monkeys on the HFD were also provided with calorically 
dense treats (35.7% of calories from fat, 56.2% of calories from 
carbohydrates, and 8.1% of calories from protein) once daily. The 
HFD represents a typical Western diet in respect to percent of 
calories provided by fat and saturated fat content.
Adult Females
Adult female Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) were housed 
in groups of 4–12 individuals (male/female ratio of 1–2/3–10) in 
indoor/outdoor pens and were given ad libitum access to water 
and either the CTR or the HFD. Mothers in our study were aged 
4.1–16.1 years and weighed 6.35–17.7 kg prepregnancy. Maternal 
body fat was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiom-
etry prior to each pregnancy. Animals were sedated with Telazol 
(3–8 mg/kg; i.m., Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA, 
USA), supplemented with Ketamine HCl (5–10 mg/kg, i.m.;

Ketaset, Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA, USA), and 
then positioned prone on the bed of a Hologic QDR Discovery 
scanner (Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA). Total body scans were 
done in the “
Adult Whole Body” scan mode. Hologic QDR 
software version 12.6.1 was used to calculate body composition. 
Maternal body weight was assessed before pregnancy and dur-
ing the third trimester of pregnancy. Percent weight gain during 
pregnancy was calculated by subtracting prepregnancy body 
weight from pregnancy body weight, dividing by prepregnancy 
body weight and multiplying by 100.
Demographic classification of maternal metabolic profiles 
is provided in Table 2. As expected, chronic consumption of a 
HFD produced elevations in percent body fat and body weight 
in our adult females. We noted an increase in fasting insulin and 
a normal fasting glucose in HFD dams. The high fasting insulin 
accompanied by normal fasting glucose indicates that our HFD 
dams are in the early stages of insulin resistance, but are not 
diabetic (22). Likewise, we observed an increase in insulin area 
under the curve (IAUC) and lower glucose area under the curve 
(GAUC) in HFD dams providing additional support that the HFD 
dams are becoming insulin resistant as they released more insulin 
to clear the glucose load administered during the glucose toler-
ance test (GTT). Several studies indicate that changes in insulin 
secretion occur prior to changes in blood glucose in patients that 
later develop type two diabetes (23, 24). It is also possible that the 
hyperinsulinemia is a response to the high circulating fatty acids 
due to HFD consumption, as insulin also regulates blood fatty 
acid levels (25).
Juvenile Offspring
Offspring were born naturally from CTR or HFD mothers who 
had been consuming the diet for 1.2–8.5 years at time of parturi-
tion. The 135 offspring included in the study were born from 65 
mothers, with no more than six offspring from the same mother. 
By 4 months of age infants began independent ingestion of the 
maternal diet and were consuming this diet as their primary food 
source by 6 months of age. Offspring were maintained with their 
mothers until the time of weaning at a mean of 7.99 months of age 
(SEM = 0.09). The offspring were then placed into group housing 
with 6–10 similarly aged juveniles and 1–2 adult females. Half 
of the offspring were maintained on their mothers’ diet and the 
other half switched diets, creating four diet groups (CTR/CTR, 
CTR/HFD, HFD/CTR, and HFD/HFD). The same animals were 
used for the majority of experimental measures; however, the 
actual sample size varied between measures. Only a subset of 
animals was euthanized at the 13-month time point for tissue col-
lection, and as the data in this study were collected over 9 years some 
measures were added to the protocol in later years. The sample 
sizes for each group for the various measures are described in the 
figure legends.
Behavioral Testing
At 11 months of age (average age 10.84 months, SEM = 0.025), 
juveniles were removed from their pens and placed in a cage 
located in an adjacent room between 0800 hours and 0830 hours. 
Individuals were then transported in a covered transfer box to 
the behavioral testing suite where they were placed in a standard 
primate cage. The juvenile was videotaped from an adjoining 
room through a one-way mirror for the duration of the test. The 
behavior tests were initiated between 0830 hours and 1100 hours.
Human Intruder Test
This test reliably evaluates individual differences in anxiety and 
stress response in NHPs (26, 27). The test began with a 10-min 
acclimation period, followed by a 2-min control period, and then 
a 2-min profile period, in which a human intruder (a woman 
unfamiliar to the monkey) entered the test room, stood 0.3 m 
from the cage, and presented her facial profile (a non-threatening 
stimulus) to the monkey. This was followed by another 2-min 
control period in which the stranger exited and the juvenile 
was alone. The human intruder then returned to the room for 
the 2-min stare period, stood in the same position 0.3 m from 
the cage, but made continuous direct eye contact (a threatening 
social stimulus) with the monkey. Another 2-min control period 
followed; the stranger reentered the room and made continuous 
direct eye contact while simultaneously offering a piece of apple 
(a desirable familiar food) to the monkey for the 2-min apple 
offer period.
Novel Objects Test
Anxiety-like behavior has been assessed in a variety of species, 
including NHPs, using novel object tests (28, 29). The test began 
after a 2-min control period following the human intruder test. 
For the first novel object, the human intruder entered, avoiding 
direct eye contact with the monkey, and placed a potentially 
threatening toy on the tray attached to the cage. A rubber ball with 
large eyes painted on it was used the first year the tests were done 
and a plastic toy bunny with large eyes for the following years. The 
toy was placed with the eyes facing the monkey. After 5 min, the 
human intruder reentered, removed the toy, and placed a pretzel

(a novel food) on the tray attached to the cage. The monkey was 
left with the pretzel for 2 min, at which time the test concluded. 
The monkey was then hand caught to collect a blood sample for 
measurement of cortisol, before being placed in the transfer box 
and returned to their normal social housing.
Video Scoring
The videos of the behavior tests were scored using the Observer 
XT software Version 11 (Noldus Information Technology) via the 
continuous sampling method by two observers blind to maternal 
and postweaning diet. Behaviors such as locomotive state, explo-
ration, vocalizations, anxious or abnormal behaviors, responses 
to stranger, and response to objects were scored. Actions which 
did not clearly fit a preestablished behavioral definition were 
coded as other and were submitted to a second blind observer for 
consideration. If agreement was not reached on the categoriza-
tion of an individual’s behavior, the behavior was not included 
in video scoring. Behaviors were coded as one of two mutually 
exclusive categories: point events, behavioral events of no quanti-
fiable duration, and state events, behavioral events of determined 
duration with a distinct beginning and ending.
Composite Variable Determination
Stress responses elicited in reaction to the behavioral tests vary 
widely between individuals; however, our subjects exhibited 
deviations from typical manifestations of anxiety, including the 
near-absence of displacement behaviors. This prompted the 
creation of more inclusive anxiety measures derived from video 
scoring results. In order to form cohesive anxiety composites, the 
frequency, distribution, and co-morbidity of functionally similar 
behaviors determined to be the result of stress were examined. 
Resulting behavioral composites are unweighted sums of percent 
duration and total number of component behaviors and are 
detailed in Table 3.
activity Measurements
Physical activity levels were measured using accelerometers 
(Actical, MiniMitter, Bend, OR, USA) mounted on plastic col-
lars (Primate Products, Miami, FL, USA) worn continuously 
by juveniles after weaning. This method for measuring physical 
activity in NHPs is well established and previously reported in 
detail (33). Activity levels were collected during the behavior 
test and in normal social housing the day prior to and follow-
ing behavioral testing. This allowed examination of the effect 
of behavioral testing on activity during the testing interval and 
longer term alteration in activity.
glucose Tolerance Tests
An intravenous GTT was performed on the dam at the third 
trimester of each offspring’s gestational period (average 47.3 days 
before parturition, SEM = 0.72), and on the offspring at 13 months 
(average age 12.98 months, SEM = 0.069). Animals were fasted 
overnight prior to the GTT. The morning of the procedure the 
animal was removed from their pen and placed in a cage in an 
adjacent room between 0800 hours and 0830 hours, receiving no 
food once removed from the group. The animal was then sedated 
with Telazol (5 mg/kg i.m.), and after 10 min of deep sedation, a 
baseline sample of 3–5 ml of blood was collected from a catheter 
placed in the right saphenous vein. Of this sample, 0.5 ml was 
used to saturate a glucose test strip placed in a OneTouch Ultra2 
Blood Glucose Monitor (LifeScan, Milpitas, CA, USA) to record 
the baseline glucose level. The remainder of the blood was kept in 
heparinized tubes on ice for insulin, glucagon, and leptin meas-
urements. A glucose bolus (50% dextrose solution) at a dose of 
0.6 g/kg was administered intravenously via the right saphenous 
catheter. Further glucose measures were recorded from 0.5 ml 
blood samples collected from the left saphenous vein at 1, 3, 5, 
10, 20, 40, and 60 min after infusion. The remainder of the blood 
was kept in heparinized tubes on ice for insulin measurements. 
After the GTT, samples were centrifuged, and plasma was stored 
at −80°C until assayed. All glucose and insulin measures from 
baseline until 60 min post-infusion were then used to calculate 
the area under curve (GAUC and IAUC, respectively) from 0 
using GraphPad Prism Version 6 software (GraphPad Software, 
Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
Blood sample collection
Juvenile blood samples were collected from the femoral or 
saphenous vein. Blood was collected into a heparin tube, which 
was placed on ice and centrifuged at 1,125 × g at 4°C for 20 min. 
Plasma was removed and stored at −80°C until assay.
Preweaning Samples
At 3 months of age (average age 90.27 days, SEM = 0.223) dam 
and infant pairs were removed from their pens and placed in a 
cage in an adjacent room between 0800 hours and 0830 hours. 
The infant was then immediately separated from the dam for 
a 30-min period. Following this period, the infant was sedated 
with Ketamine (5–10 mg/kg i.m.) and a 1–2 ml blood sample was 
collected from the femoral or saphenous vein.
At 4 months of age (average age 129.48 days, SEM = 0.398) 
dam and infant pairs were removed from their pens and placed in 
a cage in an adjacent room between 0800 hours and 0830 hours. 
The infant was separated from the dam and transferred in a 
covered transport box to the behavioral testing suite where they 
were placed in a standard primate cage. The infant received a 
behavioral test consisting of a human intruder test and novel 
objects test, which has been previously detailed (6). Immediately 
following the behavioral test the infant was hand caught from 
the cage and restrained while a 2-ml blood sample was collected 
from the femoral vein. All samples were collected within 5 min 
following the conclusion of the behavioral test.
Prior to weaning (average age 180.22 days, SEM = 0.512) dam 
and infant pairs were removed from their pens and placed in a 
cage in an adjacent room between 0800 hours and 0830 hours. 
The infant was separated from the dam until 1200 hours. The 
infant was then sedated with Telazol (3 mg/kg i.m.), and 2 ml of 
blood was collected from the saphenous vein.
Postweaning Samples
Immediately following the aforementioned 11-month behav-
ioral test, the juvenile was hand caught from the cage in the 
behavioral testing suite. The juvenile was then restrained while 
a 2 ml blood sample was collected from the femoral vein. All

hair sample collection
Hair was collected prior to weaning (average age 7.06 months, 
SEM = 0.130) and at 13 months (average age 13.10 months, 
SEM = 0.089). The animals were sedated with either Ketamine 
(5–10 mg/kg i.m.) or Telazol (5 mg/kg i.m.) and a hair sample 
was collected from the right subscapular region. The hair sample 
was placed in an aluminum foil packet and frozen at −80°C until

was collected as previously described (6, 34, 35). Euthanasia was 
performed by ONPRC Necropsy staff and adhered to AVMA 
Guidelines on Euthanasia in Animals and ONPRC standard 
operating procedures and guidelines. Animals were sedated with 
Ketamine (15–25 mg/kg i.m.) and transported to the necropsy room 
in a covered transport box. The animals were deeply anesthetized 
with a surgical dose of sodium pentobarbital (25–35 mg/kg i.v.). 
 
Anesthetic depth was monitored by assessing the loss of pal-
pebral, corneal, pain, and pharyngeal reflex. After adequate 
plane of anesthesia was reached, the abdomen was incised and 
terminal blood samples were collected from the aorta or caudal 
vena cava. The aorta was then severed and the animal exsan-
guinated. Perfusion of the brain occured via the carotid artery 
by flushing with 0.9% heparinized saline (0.5–1 l) followed by 
4% paraformaldehyde (PF, approximately 1–2 l) buffered with 
sodium phosphate (NaPO4, pH 7.4) until fixed. The brain was 
then partitioned into specific areas and placed in 4% PF for 24 h 
at 4°C, transferred to 10% glycerol buffered with NaPO4 for 24 h, 
and finally transferred to 20% glycerol solution for 72 h. Tissue 
blocks were frozen in −50°C 2-methylbutane and then stored in 
−80°C until sectioning.
Plasma assays
The ONPRC Endocrine Technologies Support Core (ETSC) at the 
ONPRC performed assays for cortisol (17α-hydroxycorticosterone) 
and insulin using a chemiluminescence-based automatic clinical 
platform (Roche cobas e411, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, 
IN, USA) validated for NHP serum and plasma (36). Company-
provided calibrators and quality control samples were analyzed 
before each use. The intra- and inter-assay variation of the assay 
for cortisol was less than 7% and the assay range was 0.36–
63.40 ng/ml. The intra- and inter-assay variation of the assay for 
insulin was less than 7% and the assay range was 0.2–1,000 μIU/
ml. Fasting glucagon was assayed by radioimmunoassay (RIA) 
(Catalog no. GL-32K; Millipore). The intra-assay variations were 
less than 8% and the assay range was 20–4,000 pg/ml. As all 
samples were analyzed in a single assay for each target, no specific 
inter-assay variations for this study were calculated. Leptin levels 
were measured using an RIA kit directed against human leptin 
(Catalog no. HL-81K; Millipore). The intra-assay variations were 
less than 17% and assay range was 0.78–100 ng/ml. Overall inter-
assay variations for the leptin and glucagon RIAs in the ETSC are 
less than 20%.
hair assays
Cortisol was measured in a hair sample to measure chronic stress. 
Hair cortisol reflects the mean cortisol over the past several 
weeks to months (37). The ETSC at ONPRC analyzed cortisol 
in hair samples using a modification of an existing protocol (37). 
Hair was washed with isopropanol (5 ml), filtered with P8 filter 
paper (Fisher Brand cat. No.: 09-795D), and minced manually 
with a specially designed multi-blade cutter with blade distance 
at 2 mm. Next, the cortisol was extracted by gentle shaking in 
methanol (50 mg/ml) for approximately 22 h. Hair and methanol 
were then separated by centrifugation and the supernatant was 
collected and dried under a forced air stream at 45–50°C. Finally, 
the dried contents were reconstituted in assay buffer and cortisol 
levels determined by ELISA (Salimetrics, State College, PA, USA). 
Recoveries were determined at the same time as sample analysis 
and used to adjust final sample cortisol values. Intra-assay varia-
tion was less than 10% and inter-assay variation was less than 15% 
(n = 5). The assay range was 0.33–30.00 ng/ml.
In Situ hybridization
Tissues were processed for in situ hybridization, as previously 
detailed (6, 34). Midbrain blocks from offspring necropsied at 
13 months were sectioned using a freezing microtome at 25 µm, 
collected in 1:24 series, and stored at −20°C in ethylene glycol 
cryoprotectant. Sections in 1:24 series were slide mounted in 
potassium phosphate-buffered saline (KPBS) (pH 7.4), and dried 
overnight by vacuum-dessication. cRNA probes were transcribed 
in the presence of 100% P33-labeled UTP (PerkinElmer, Waltham, 
MA, USA) from cDNA clones of tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2; 
300 bp), serotonin transporter (SERT; 253 bp), and serotonin 1A 
receptor subtype (5-HT1AR; 431 bp). Probe-labeled sections were 
exposed to film for 2d (SERT), 2d (TPH2), or 5d (5-HT1aR) for 
visualization. A CoolSnap HQ camera and MetaMorph software 
were used to capture autoradiographic images, which were ana-
lyzed by integrated morphometry analysis to measure perecent 
area and density. Total density was determined by multiplying 
total area by optical density of each level of the midbrain (ros-
tral ≈ bregma—17.78 ± 1 mm, medial ≈ bregma—19.75 ± 1 mm, 
and caudal ≈ bregma—23.40 ± 1 mm). Three to four matched 
sections were analyzed for each midbrain level in each monkey.
immunohistochemistry for serotonin
Coronal sections (25 µm) of the right PFC were collected in 
1:24 series using a freezing microtome, as previously described 
(34). Briefly, sections were washed in KPBS and then blocked 
in 2% donkey serum in 0.4% Triton-X into KPBS for 30 min. 
Rabbit anti-5-HT (Lot #082M4831, #S5545; 1:5,000; Sigma-
Aldrich) antibody was diluted in 2% donkey serum in 0.4% 
triton X into KPBS and applied to tissue sections which were 
incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then at 4°C for 48 h. 
Tissues were then washed in KPBS, and the secondary antibody 
(Donkey-Anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 488; Lot #1531671 Life 
Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was applied for 
1 h at room temperature at a dilution of 1:1,000. Sections were 
washed again in KPBS, and then counterstained using DAPI 
(Molecular probes cat# D-1306) diluted in KPBS and Triton-X 
for approximately 30 s. Sections were washed once more and 
 FigUre 1 | (a) The number of anxiety behaviors during the 11-month 
behavioral assessment increased with exposure to maternal high-fat diet (HFD) 
during perinatal development (F1,67 = 12.098, p = 0.001) and was affected by 
an interaction between maternal and postweaning diet (F1,67 = 4.662, 
p = 0.034). The HFD/CTR group performed more anxiety behaviors than CTR/
CTR animals (F1,67 = 21.276, p = 0.000018). (B) Controlling for offspring weight, 
the amount of time spent performing anxiety behaviors increased with maternal 
HFD exposure (F1,65 = 4.498, p = 0.038). (c) The amount of time engaging in 
anxiety behaviors was associated with offspring body weight; offspring with 
lower body weight spent more time engaged in anxiety behaviors (F1,65 = 5.819, 
p = 0.019). Data shown as mean ± SEM. A black * denotes maternal diet 
effect, p < 0.05. A blue * denotes a maternal diet effect when controlling for 
postweaning diet. Magenta lines denote significant overall covariance, p < 0.05. 
Sample sizes are as follows: CTR/CTR n = 21 (n = 10 males; n = 11 females), 
CTR/HFD n = 12 (n = 8 males; n = 4 females), HFD/CTR n = 23 (n = 12 males;

then mounted on gelatin subbed slides and coverslipped with 
Slowfade Mountant (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, 
CA, USA) and stored at 4°C.
Serotonin immunofluorescent images were captured using 
Confocal laser microscopy on a Leica SP5 AOBS Confocal 
microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Bannockburn, IL, USA) 
as previously described (38). We imaged six fields of view 
per section throughout area 10 of the right PFC, two fields of 
view each of the dorsal, medial, and ventral regions as defined 
by the Paxinos Stereotaxic Atlas (39, Figures 1–6) in anatomi-
cally matched sections for each animal. The observer was blind 
to maternal and postweaning diet when imaging slides. Images 
were taken at a format of 1,024 × 1,024, zoom factor 1, 400 Hz, in 
2 µm increments along the z-axis of the tissue using a 10× (NA 
0.40) objective. The 405-nm line of a blue diode laser and a 488-
nm argon laser were used sequentially to avoid bleed-through 
of individual fluorophores into the nearby detection channels. 
ImageJ software (Wayne Rasband, National Institute of Health, 
Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to measure the total fluorescent 
intensity, the percent area and the integrated density of 5-HT 
by an individual blind to maternal and postweaning diet. DAPI 
staining was used to identify the layers and three measurements 
using an oval region of interest were taken of each layer (1–6) 
for each animal. These three regions were averaged for each layer 
of each image and were used to calculate the overall average 
fluorescent intensity, percentage area and integrated density of 
each layer for each animal.
statistical analysis
Statistical tests were run using SPSS Version 22 (SPSS Inc., 
Chicago, IL, USA). For all variables, Kolmogorov–Smirnov 
tests of normality were run for the three pre-determined factors 
(maternal diet, postweaning diet, and gender) with p < 0.05 indi-
cating a significant deviation from normality. If data were non-
parametric a square root or log10 transformation was applied to 
obtain normally distributed data. Remaining non-parametric 
measures were rank transformed to achieve normality, with 
mean rank assigned to ties. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. 
Alpha values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
All graphs were made with GraphPad Prism Version 6 software 
(GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
Parametric Analysis
Physical activity, cortisol, TPH2, SERT, and 5-HT1A mRNA 
expression, 5-HT immunohistochemistry, and select behavioral 
measures were determined to be parametric and tested for 
homogeneity of variance. The effect of juvenile metabolic state 
on observed outcomes was examined, using GAUC and body 
weight taken at the 13-month GTT as metabolic parameters. 
Pearson correlations were run, with p < 0.05 identifying potential 
covariates. Direct eye contact (r = 0.239, p = 0.048) and vigilance 
(r = −0.242, p = 0.046) during the 11-month behavior test, as 
well as MnR TPH2 percent area (r = 0.447, p = 0.007) and density 
(r = 0.451, p = 0.007) correlated with GAUC. Percent duration of 
anxiety behaviors during the 11-month behavior test correlated 
with weight (r = −0.294, p = 0.011). For these outcomes, the 
 FigUre 2 | (a) Jonckheere’s tested revealed the number of vocalizations exhibited during the 11-month behavior test increased with high-fat diet (HFD) exposure 
(p = 0.033). (B) Exposure to a maternal HFD increased the number of active anxiety behaviors (p = 0.0006), in both male (p = 0.042) and female (p = 0.015) 
offspring. Jonckheere’s test detected an interaction between maternal diet and postweaning diet, with occurrences of active anxiety increasing with exposure to the 
HFD (p = 0.0004). (c) The percent of time exhibiting active anxiety behaviors likewise increased with a maternal HFD (p = 0.003). Postweaning HFD also impacted 
the percent of time exhibiting active anxiety with active anxiety increasing with increased exposure to the HFD (p = 0.001). (D) Animals exposed to a postweaning 
HFD displayed increased levels of stereotypy (p = 0.027). There was also a significant trend with exposure to HFD increasing the percent of time exhibiting 
stereotypy (p = 0.002). Data shown as mean ± SEM. * denotes maternal diet effect, # denotes a postweaning diet effect, and a curved arrow indicates a significant 
trend detected by a Jonckheere’s test, p < 0.05. Sample sizes are as follows: CTR/CTR n = 21 (n = 10 males; n = 11 females), CTR/HFD n = 12 (n = 8 males; 
n = 4 females), HFD/CTR n = 24 (n = 12 males; n = 12 females), and HFD/HFD n = 18 (n = 8 males; n = 10 females).

associated metabolic variable was used in three-factor univariate 
ANCOVAs. Change in activity was tested with a three-factor 
repeated measures ANOVA. Test activity, postweaning plasma 
and hair cortisol, dorsal raphe (DR) TPH2, SERT, and 5-HT1A 
mRNA expression, 5-HT immunohistochemistry measures, and 
remaining parametric behaviors were analyzed with a three-factor 
univariate ANOVA. Preweaning cortisol measures were analyzed 
with a two-factor univariate ANOVA. All pairwise analyses fol-
lowing ANOVA or ANCOVAs utilized Bonferroni corrections.
Non-Parametric Analysis
Measures which did not achieve normality by any transformation 
attempt underwent a series of tests to investigate the same three 
factors explored in parametric analysis. To examine juvenile meta-
bolic effects Kendall’s correlations were run for GAUC and weight. 
Only latency to contact apple in the 11-month test correlated 
with weight (r = −0.232, p = 0.010), with no measures associated 
with GAUC. The relationship between metabolic parameters and 
observed outcomes, independent of variation due to maternal 
diet, postweaning diet, and gender was examined using Kendall’s 
partial correlations, with p < 0.05 indicating unique variance. No 
measures produced significant partial correlation results so group 
differences were examined independent of metabolic parameters. 
Variables were first tested using Mann–Whitney U tests to examine 
maternal diet, postweaning diet, and gender. Kruskal–Wallis 
tests were then performed on two sets of four independent groups, 
classified by an individual’s gender and maternal diet and their 
gender and postweaning diet, in order to examine the relationship 
between diet and gender. Last, the Jonckheere–Terpstra test was 
performed on diet groups, ordered with increasing exposure to the 
HFD, assessing the effect of HFD exposure across maternal and 
postweaning diets. Jonckheere–Terpstra tests for ordered pattern 
of medians across independent groups with meaningful order, 
such as our diet groups. Both Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis 
two-tailed p-values, as well as all follow-up pairwise examinations, 
were adjusted for number of comparisons. Jonckheere–Terpstra 
one-tailed p-values remain unadjusted.

HFD during perinatal development (F1,67 = 12.098, p = 0.001; 
Figure 1A), and was affected by an interaction between mater-
nal and postweaning diet (F1,67 = 4.662, p = 0.034). Follow-up 
analysis showed the HFD/CTR group performed more anxiety 
behaviors than CTR/CTR animals (F1,67 = 21.276, p = 0.000018). 
ANCOVA results controlling for juvenile weight revealed that 
the amount of time spent performing anxiety behaviors also 
increased with maternal HFD exposure (F1,65 = 4.498, p = 0.038, 
Figure 1B). In addition, the amount of time engaging in anxiety 
behaviors was found to be associated with offspring body weight, 
such that offspring with lower body weight spent more time 
engaged in anxiety behaviors (F1,65 = 5.819, p = 0.019, Figure 1C). 
 FigUre 4 | (a) The number of locomotive behaviors was affected by an interaction between postweaning diet and gender (F1,67 = 6.047, p = 0.017).  
(B) Postweaning high-fat diet (HFD) males exhibited fewer locomotive behavior compared to CTR males (F1,67 = 4.135, p = 0.046). Postweaning CTR male offspring

interaction between postweaning diet and gender (F1,67 = 6.451, p = 0.013). (D) In males, postweaning HFD consumption decreased the number of behaviors 
exhibited during the behavior test (F1,67 = 6.588, p = 0.013), and within postweaning diet CTR male offspring performed more behaviors than females (F1,67 = 4.383, 
p = 0.040). (e) Activity levels during the behavior test decreased with postweaning HFD exposure (F1,37 = 5.327, p = 0.027). (F) There was an interaction with 
gender and maternal diet (F1,37 = 5.252, p = 0.028), which showed that maternal HFD decreased activity in male offspring as compared to females (F1,37 = 4.406, 
p = 0.043). There was also an interaction with gender, maternal, and postweaning diet (F1,37 = 5.846, p = 0.021). HFD/HFD males displayed reduced activity 
compared to females (F1,37 = 7.447, p = 0.010) and HFD/CTR males (F1,37 = 6.548, p = 0.015), but not from CTR/HFD males (F1,37 = 4.042, p = 0.052). Data shown 
as mean ± SEM. A black # denotes a postweaning diet effect, and a black ° denotes a gender difference, p < 0.05. A blue # denotes a postweaning diet effect when

females), CTR/HFD n = 8 (n = 7 males; n = 1 female), HFD/CTR n = 14 (n = 8 males; n = 6 females), and HFD/HFD n = 8 (n = 2 males; n = 6 females).

The number of vocalizations, an established measure of anxiety 
(32, 40), similarly increased with HFD exposure (p = 0.033, 
Figure 2A) according to Jonckheere’s test. Offspring exposed 
to maternal HFD displayed increased number of active anxiety 
behaviors (p = 0.0006, Figure 2B), which was maintained in 
males (p = 0.042) and females (p = 0.015). Jonckheere’s test 
detected an interaction between maternal and postweaning diet, 
with occurrences of active anxiety increasing with HFD exposure 
(p = 0.0004). Time exhibiting active anxiety likewise increased 
with maternal HFD (p = 0.003, Figure 2C). Moreover, step-down 
analysis revealed that any exposure to the HFD increased active 
anxiety (p < 0.05) compared to no exposure. Females exposed 
to maternal HFD exhibited more active anxiety than controls 
(p = 0.042). Stereotypy increased with postweaning HFD con-
sumption (p = 0.027, Figure 2D). Further, any exposure to the 
HFD across perinatal development increased time exhibiting 
stereotypy (p = 0.002). In contrast, inactive anxiety (Table 3) 
was unaffected by gender, maternal diet, or postweaning diet 
(F1,67 < 2.50, p > 0.100). Other traditional anxiety behaviors, 
such as crouch and freeze, were independently examined and 
produced no significant results (Crouch: all p > 0.400; Freeze: 
F1,67 < 2.00, p > 0.100).
The amount of time interacting with novel objects introduced 
during the behavior test decreased with postweaning HFD 
exposure (F1,67 = 4.874, p = 0.031, Figure 3A) and was lower in 
females (F1,67 = 5.826, p = 0.019, data not shown). There was an 
interaction between postweaning diet and gender (F1,67 = 13.613, 
p = 0.0004, Figure 3B) with postweaning HFD males interacting 
less with the novel objects compared to CTR males (F1,67 = 19.213, 
p = 0.00004) and compared to HFD females (F1,67 = 14.862, 
p = 0.0003). The number of interactions with novel objects was 
likewise decreased in postweaning HFD animals (F1,66 = 5.340, 
p = 0.024, Figure 3C). Vigilance to the novel toy and stranger was 
examined and found to be insignificant (F1,60 < 2.50, p > 0.100, 
data not shown). Total time spent exploring the cage was 
reduced in postweaning HFD offspring (F1,67 = 6.639, p = 0.012, 
Figure 3D). Examining only oral exploration of the cage showed 
elevation with maternal HFD exposure (percent duration: 
F1,67 = 5.300, p = 0.024, Figure 3E; total number: F1,67 = 4.350, 
p = 0.041, Figure 3F) and a reduction with postweaning HFD 
exposure (percent duration: F1,67 = 6.915, p = 0.011; total num-
ber: F1,67 = 4.415, p = 0.039).
There was an interaction between maternal diet and gender 
on time spent in locomotion (F1,67 = 6.865, p = 0.011, data not 
 FigUre 6 | (a) Plasma cortisol measured after the 11-month behavior test 
increased with postweaning high-fat diet (HFD) exposure (F1,83 = 6.729, 
p = 0.011). Post-test cortisol was also affected by an interaction between 
maternal and postweaning diet (F1,83 = 5.772, p = 0.019), with the HFD/HFD 
group increased from HFD/CTR (F1,83 = 12.966, p = 0.001) and from CTR/
HFD (F1,83 = 5.489, p = 0.022). Sample sizes for 11-month plasma cortisol 
are as follows: CTR/CTR n = 27 (n = 13 males; n = 14 females), CTR/HFD 
n = 18 (n = 11 males; n = 7 females), HFD/CTR n = 25 (n = 12 males; 
n = 13 females), and HFD/HFD n = 21 (n = 9 males; n = 12 females). (B) At 
weaning, offspring exposed to a maternal HFD displayed higher hair cortisol 
than controls (F1,46 = 4.406, p = 0.041). Sample sizes for weaning hair 
cortisol are as follows: maternal CTR n = 20 (n = 11 males; n = 9 females), 
maternal HFD n = 17 (n = 10 males; n = 7 females). Data shown as 
mean ± SEM. A black * denotes maternal diet effect and a black # denotes a 
postweaning diet effect, p < 0.05. A blue * denotes maternal diet effect when 
controlling for postweaning diet and a blue # denotes a postweaning diet

FigUre 5 | (a) Activity level was reduced the day after the behavior test in all 
offspring (F1,31 = 5.879, p = 0.021). Postweaning high-fat diet (HFD) 
increased activity (F1,31 = 8.701, p = 0.006). There was an interaction with 
day and postweaning diet (F1,31 = 4.868, p = 0.035), with postweaning HFD 
increasing activity the day before the test (F1,31 = 15.007, p = 0.001). 
Compared to their pre-test levels, postweaning HFD-exposed animals 
decreased activity after the test (F1,31 = 7.327, p = 0.011). (B) There was an 
interaction with day, gender, and maternal diet (F1,31 = 4.749, p = 0.037). 
After the test, maternal HFD males showed increased activity compared to 
females (F1,31 = 9.749, p = 0.004). (c) The interaction also showed that 
maternal HFD females had decreased activity compared to pre-test levels 
(F1,31 = 21.016, p = 0.00007), but not from controls (F1,31 = 2.957,

HFD/CTR n = 13 (n = 8 males; n = 5 females), and HFD/HFD n = 7 (n = 2

(n = 8 males; n = 5 females), and HFD/HFD n = 8 (n = 2 males; n = 6

offspring displayed a higher number of locomotive behaviors

Maternal and Postweaning HFD Influenced  
Physical Activity
Activity levels during the behavior test were examined and found 
to decrease with postweaning HFD exposure (F1,37 = 5.327, 
p = 0.027, Figure 4E). There was an interaction with gender 
and maternal diet (F1,37 = 5.252, p = 0.028, Figure 4F), which 
showed that maternal HFD decreased activity in male offspring 
as compared to females (F1,37 = 4.406, p = 0.043). There was 
also an interaction with gender, maternal, and postweaning diet 
(F1,37 = 5.846, p = 0.021, Figure 4F). HFD/HFD males displayed 
reduced activity compared to females (F1,37 = 7.447, p = 0.010) 
and HFD/CTR males (F1,37 = 6.548, p = 0.015), but not from CTR/
HFD males (F1,37 = 4.042, p = 0.052).
Activity level was reduced the day after the test in all offspring, 
regardless of diet or gender (F1,31 = 5.879, p = 0.021, Figure 5A). 
Postweaning HFD consumption increased activity independent 
of day examined (F1,31 = 8.701, p = 0.006, Figure 5A). There was 
an interaction between day and postweaning diet (F1,31 = 4.868, 
p = 0.035), with postweaning HFD offspring showing increased 
activity the day before the test (F1,31 = 15.007, p = 0.001). 
Compared to their pre-test activity levels, postweaning HFD-
exposed animals exhibited decreased activity the day after the test 
(F1,31 = 7.327, p = 0.011). Furthermore, there was an interaction 
between day, gender, and maternal diet (F1,31 = 4.749, p = 0.037). 
After the test, maternal HFD females displayed decreased activity 
compared to males (F1,31 = 9.749, p = 0.004, Figure 5B), and from 
their own baseline (F1,31 = 21.016, p = 0.00007, Figure 5C).
Maternal and Postweaning HFD Influenced Cortisol
Plasma cortisol measured after the 11-month behavior test 
increased with postweaning HFD exposure (F1,83 = 6.729, 
p = 0.011, Figure 6A). Post-test cortisol was also affected by an 
interaction between maternal and postweaning diet (F1,83 = 5.772, 
p = 0.019, Figure 6A), with the HFD/HFD group increased from 
HFD/CTR (F1,83 = 12.966, p = 0.001), a postweaning diet increase, 
and from CTR/HFD (F1,83 = 5.489, p = 0.022), a maternal diet 
increase. Hair cortisol collected at 13 months of age was increased 
in males (F1,49 = 5.760, p = 0.020, data not shown) and unaffected 
by diet.
Preweaning cortisol measures were also examined for maternal 
diet and gender effects. Hair cortisol at weaning was increased in 
maternal HFD animals (F1,46 = 4.406, p = 0.041, Figure 6B), and 
plasma cortisol at weaning was increased in females (F1,87 = 3.995, 
p = 0.049, data not shown). Preweaning plasma cortisol was not 
found to be significant at 3 months (F1,106 < 3.00, p > 0.090) or 
4 months of age (F1,94 < 0.100, p > 0.400).
Maternal HFD Consumption Impairs Development  
of the Serotonin System
In the DR maternal HFD exposure decreased both the percent 
area (F1,35 = 5.260, p = 0.028, Figure 7A) and density (F1,35 = 8.847, 
p = 0.005, data not shown) of TPH2 mRNA expression (Figure 7D). 
Expression in the MnR increased with postweaning HFD expo-
sure (percent area: F1,26 = 7.675, p = 0.010, Figure 7B; Density: 
F1,26 = 7.172, p = 0.013, data not shown), as well as with increased 
GAUC values (percent area: F1,26 = 9.719, p = 0.004, Figure 7C; 
Density: F1,26 = 9.499, p = 0.005, data not shown).
The percent area of 5-HT1A mRNA expression was examined 
in the DR and MnR with no difference due to maternal diet, 
postweaning diet, or gender (all DR: F1,30 < 0.10, p > 0.800; all 
MnR: F1,37 < 3.00, p > 0.100). SERT expression was examined in 
terms of percent area and density in the DR and MnR with no 
significant results (all F1,47 < 2.00, p > 0.200).
Postweaning HFD Decreases 5-HT Immunoreactive 
Signal in the PFC
Intensity of 5-HT immunoreactive signal in area 10 of the medial 
 
PFC (Figure 8A) revealed an interaction between postweaning 
 
diet and gender (F1,16 = 5.712, p = 0.030, data not shown). 
Differences were more prominent in the medial region 
(F1,16 = 6.246, p = 0.024), and the effect was greatest in layer 1 
(F1,16 = 6.330, p = 0.023, Figure 8B) in which postweaning HFD 
exposure alone decreased 5-HT immunoreactivity (F1,16 = 6.012, 
p = 0.026). 5-HT intensity in layer 1 of medial area 10 was 
decreased by postweaning HFD consumption regardless of gen-
der (F1,16 = 7.662, p = 0.014, Figure 8C), and was affected by an 
interaction between postweaning diet and gender (F1,16 = 7.497, 
p = 0.015, Figure 8D). In males, postweaning HFD decreased 
mean intensity (F1,16 = 13.895, p = 0.002).
DiscUssiOn
This is the first study demonstrating long-lasting effects of HFD 
consumption during early development on behavior and brain 
development in NHP offspring. The observed effects of maternal 
HFD appear to be due to developmental programming as the 
reduction in TPH2 mRNA expression in the DR and many of the 
behavioral aberrations persist when animals consume a healthy 
diet at weaning. These findings indicate that an early nutritional 
intervention, consumption of the control diet at weaning, was not 
sufficient to ameliorate many of the changes in behavior induced 
by maternal HFD consumption, such as increased anxiety. 
 
In addition, postweaning HFD consumption reduced serotonin 
immunoreactivity in area 10 of the PFC, exacerbated behav-
ioral abnormalities, and increased stereotypy independent of 
 
maternal diet.
Results from 11-month-old male and female offspring indicate 
that exposure to maternal HFD increases the risk of anxiety, a 
risk further exacerbated by postweaning HFD consumption. 
This increase in anxiety in maternal HFD offspring extends and 
expands our previous findings of increased anxiety in 4-month-
old female HFD offspring (6). It is interesting that by 11 months 
of age both male and female offspring now exhibit anxiety. The 
earlier onset of anxiety in female offspring correspond to human 
studies demonstrating that women are more prone to anxiety 
than men and that the association between obesity and anxiety 
disorders is more robust in women than in men (41). Importantly, 
the effects of maternal HFD remained significant when offspring 
weight was taken into account. Any exposure to a HFD during 
early development increased both active anxiety and stereotypy, 
a component of active anxiety. Total active anxiety was primarily 
influenced by exposure to maternal HFD, whereas stereotypy 
was primarily increased by postweaning HFD consumption. 
Stereotypy is an extreme reaction to stress exceeding the adaptive

value of anxiety responses, suggesting behavioral dysregulation 
and reduced ability to use normative methods to alleviate anxiety 
(32). Our data suggest that while any developmental exposure to 
a HFD increases anxiety, maternal HFD is the primary determi-
nant of anxiety displayed during behavior testing, manifesting as 
active forms of anxiety, and that postweaning HFD consumption 
independently increases stereotypy.
Postweaning HFD-exposed animals exhibited increased 
behavioral inhibition as evidenced by reduced interaction with 
novel objects and the test cage. Behavioral inhibition is associated 
with increased anxiety in animal models (32) and children (42, 43), 
as well as a lowered arousal threshold to novel stimuli (31). 
Postweaning HFD males displayed the highest level of behavioral 
inhibition, interacting the least with the novel objects. Overall, 
we observed that females interacted less with novel objects, a 
reflection of species-typical gender differences, illuminating the 
severity of the postweaning HFD reduction in male offspring. 
As no differences were observed in vigilance toward the novel 
objects, this decrease is not due to altered attention. Reduced 
interaction with the test environment provides further support 
that postweaning HFD consumption inhibits species-typical 
behavior in response to novel stimuli. Maternal HFD likewise 
produced a departure from normative levels of cage interaction, 
indicating exploratory behaviors are particularly sensitive to HFD 
exposure and potentially indicative of anxiety. Behavioral inhibi-
tion in children is specifically associated with social anxiety (31),

suggesting that maternal and postweaning HFD exposures result 
in the development of varied anxiety phenotypes. Our findings that 
developmental HFD exposure increased anxiety are supported by 
several rodent studies (14, 44, 45) and recent evidence from epi-
demiological studies that report an association between maternal 
obesity and occurrence of anxiety and depression in children and 
adolescents (46, 47). An elevated prepregnancy BMI was associ-
ated with increased fear, sadness, and internalizing behaviors 
in children (8, 12). Also, maternal obesity increases the risk of 
abnormal birth weight (48), which in itself is associated with 
anxiety and depression in adolescents (13).
Postweaning HFD consumption increased baseline activity in 
the juveniles’ home environment as previously reported (20). We 
hypothesize that baseline activity is upregulated in order to defend 
body weight “set point” in an environment of nutritional excess. 
The “set point” model (49–52) proposes that circulating metabolic 
hormones act on the hypothalamus resulting in compensatory 
metabolic changes that maintain body weight at a predefined 
level. In contrast, postweaning HFD suppressed activity during 
the behavior test and in males reduced the number of behaviors 
performed, further indicating behavioral inhibition (53). Overall, 
animals exhibited reduced activity 24 h after the behavioral 
assessment, indicating the prolonged influence of a stressful 
event. Differences in the change in activity after the behavioral 
assessment were best explained by postweaning HFD exposure, 
and in females by maternal HFD exposure. The gender-specific 
effects of HFD/HFD exposure suggest maternal diet reprograms 
stress response more effectively in females, and that the postwean-
ing diet has a greater impact on stress response in males. Thus, 
postweaning HFD exposure is an important regulator of physical 
activity, elevating baseline levels and inhibiting recovery after the 
stress of behavioral assessment. A variety of models, including 
NHPs and humans, show positive social interactions protect 
against deleterious effects of stress (53). The reverse effect is seen 
when our postweaning HFD animals return to their social group, 
suggesting social impairment and the experience or perception of 
negative social interactions (53).
Postweaning HFD consumption increased plasma cortisol 
response to the 11-month behavior test, a stress response further 
amplified with maternal HFD exposure, as HFD/HFD animals 
displayed the highest level of cortisol implying increased stress 
sensitivity. While both maternal and postweaning HFD increased 
acute stress response to the behavioral assessment, only males 
subsequently presented with an elevated chronic stress response, 
as measured by hair cortisol. Conversely, maternal HFD consump-
tion increased hair cortisol at weaning. Our results are consistent 
with the findings from several animal models which indicate 
that the HPA axis is programed by perinatal HFD consumption 
 
(44, 54, 55). The impact of perinatal HFD on the HPA axis 
could be direct, or through increased adiposity or an increased 
inflammatory state induced by HFD exposure. The HPA axis is 
critical in behavioral regulation; in humans increased cortisol is

associated with anxiety disorders (56), and NHP studies show that 
HPA activation and elevated plasma cortisol are associated with 
abnormal behaviors (57). The observed cortisol results further sup-
port our postulation that maternal and postweaning HFD exposure 
produce differential anxiety phenotypes. Whereas maternal HFD 
induces an early elevation in hair cortisol and generalized anxiety 
symptoms, postweaning HFD causes both an elevation in acute 
cortisol and social anxiety symptoms, especially in males.
We further noted that postweaning HFD exposure decreased 
serotoninergic immunoreactivity in area 10 of the PFC, particu-
larly in layer 1 of the medial aspect and in males. We postulate 
that this reduction in serotoninergic immunoreactivity relates 
to decreased serotonergic innervation of area 10 of the PFC. 
However, differences in the density of serotonin positive fibers 
could also be due to differences in serotonin release and reuptake. 
Here too the alterations in serotonin immunoreactivity reflect 
the heightened sensitivity of male offspring to programming by 
postweaning HFD consumption. The impact of the postweaning 
diet on the medial PFC is not surprising, as this brain region 
undergoes marked growth during the juvenile period and is one 
of the last to fully develop (58). The reduction of serotonergic 
immunoreactivity in area 10 is a potential contributor to the 
behavioral inhibition observed in postweaning HFD animals as 
serotonergic innervation of the PFC is an important regulator 
of behavioral inhibition (59). Moreover, decreased serotonergic 
immunoreactivity in the PFC may underlie the observed increase 
in stereotypy in animals consuming the HFD postweaning, as 
impairments in PFC morphology are associated with increased 
stereotypy in a NHP model of immune activation during devel-
opment (59–61). We previously demonstrated effects of maternal 
HFD consumption on the dopaminergic systems at 13-months 
of age, with maternal HFD decreasing tyrosine hydroxylase and 
dopamine receptor 1 and 2 protein immunoreactivity in area 10 
of the PFC (35). Thus, the observed behavioral impairments could 
also be influenced by the dopamine system, which is modulated 
by serotonin activity (62).
We report that exposure to maternal HFD reduced TPH2 
mRNA expression in the DR, with the programming effects of 
maternal HFD on TPH2 expression persisting when offspring 
consumed a healthy diet postweaning. In contrast, postweaning 
HFD consumption elevated TPH2 mRNA expression in the MnR. 
Similar results have been found in infant mice, with increased 
anxiety and depression- like behaviors resulting from decreased 
DR and increased MnR serotonergic activity (63). The complex 
projections originating from the DR and MnR are site specific and 
largely non-overlapping, attune to subnuclei variation (64). This 
divergence is apparent within cortical targets: MnR projections 
are concentrated in the dorsomedial components, particularly 
the medial PFC, and the DR projects to most cortical areas, 
with the medial PFC innervated more sparingly (65). The raphe 
nuclei also both send widespread serotonergic projections to the 
hypothalamus. However, the arcuate and suprachiasmatic nuclei 
receive input exclusively from the MnR (65). In this study, TPH2 
mRNA expression was measured in the cell bodies of the DR and 
MnR, but not in at the axon terminals or release points along 
the axon where changes in 5-HT metabolism also occur. Thus, 
changes in TPH2 mRNA expression may indicate a reduction in 
the capacity to synthesize serotonin, as seen in a rodent study 
where inhibition of DR TPH2 mRNA expression resulted in 
in vivo suppression of serotonin synthesis (66). However, it is 
important to note we measured mRNA expression of the TPH2 
and not the actual activity of the enzyme.
Importantly, our findings in the raphe nuclei are consistent with 
our observed outcomes, as the brain regions innervated by the DR 
and MnR are integral in the regulation of metabolism and behav-
ior. For example, the amygdala receives robust projections from 
the DR (65) and increased amygdala activity indicates potential 
vulnerability to anxiety pathology, as the region designates learned 
fear response (67). Fear responses, conditioned or unpredictable, 
are inhibited with increased ventral PFC activity, an area key to 
emotional regulation (67). The medial PFC determines stressor 
controllability, and in humans area 10 exhibits important social 
functions, distinguishing between perceived and imagined stimuli 
(58, 68). Altered neural serotonin is associated with psychological 
and neurodevelopmental disorders including depression (69, 70), 
anxiety (71), ADHD (72), and ASD (73). Direct raphe innervation 
to these brain regions is implicated in the widespread serotonergic 
impairments seen in anxiety disorders. Serotonergic disruption 
is likewise involved in metabolic regulation, as serotonergic 
projections from the raphe nuclei synapse onto the melanocortin 
neurons critical in regulating energy intake and expenditure 
(74). In addition to the raphe nuclei, TPH2 is expressed in the 
hypothalamus and pituitary of humans and mice (75), and in 
NHPs serotonergic regulation of HPA function was shown to be 
TPH2-dependent (66). Unambiguously, these target areas of DR 
and MnR serotonergic innervation constitute a complex neural 
network of behavioral and metabolic regulation.
We postulate that the differential anxiety phenotypes observed 
in maternal and postweaning HFD groups originate from the 
nuclei-specific perturbations seen in the raphe serotonergic 
 
system. Exposure to a HFD during gestational and early perinatal 
development impairs serotonergic function of the DR neural 
network and results in the development of anxiety pathology. 
Our group has shown maternal HFD exposure suppressed 
serotonergic function in the fetal DR, the behavioral effects of 
which were seen at 4 months of age, with HFD-exposed females 
displaying increased anxiety (6). Hair cortisol at 6 months was 
elevated in male and female HFD offspring, indicating both 
genders experienced chronically increased stress. Intervention 
with a control diet postweaning had no effect on these outcomes; 
decreased DR TPH2 expression and increased anxiety behaviors 
persisted in maternal HFD offspring. Importantly, these results 
indicate the continued development of anxiety pathology, in 
spite of the remodeling capacity of the serotonergic system (76). 
The compounded effect of maternal and postweaning HFD on 
11-month plasma cortisol and activity measures further support 
the long-term effects of HFD on stress response. Active anxiety 
was particularly increased in maternal HFD offspring, and inde-
pendent of the influence of maternal HFD exposure on anxiety, 
low body weight was predictive of anxiety behaviors at 11 months. 
HFD-induced DR serotonergic deficiency could produce these 
effects by impairing innervation of targeted anxiety and meta-
bolic circuits. Insufficient neuronal regulation reduces agouti-
related peptide (AgRP) innervation of hypothalamic nuclei and 
 16

HFD during Development Programs Behavior

reprograms energy balance, promoting leanness and hypophagia 
(77, 78). Congruent with this, our group found maternal HFD 
exposure reduced AgRP fibers in the paraventricular nucleus of 
the hypothalamus (20). Due to DR’s extensive control of behavio-
ral and metabolic pathways, maternal HFD impairs serotonergic 
function and results in widespread and long-term anxiety and 
energy balance reprogramming.
In contrast to maternal HFD DR outcomes, postweaning HFD 
increased TPH2 expression, specifically in the MnR, reflecting 
the complexity of the development of the raphe serotonergic 
pathways. In depressed suicides TPH2 transcription and protein 
levels were increased in the DR and MnR (64, 79). Increased 
raphe serotonin synthesis, despite locally reduced serotonin 
levels, is hypothesized to compensate for insufficient serotonergic 
transmission at target areas (64). In area 10 of the medial PFC, 
one such MnR target area (65), our data show postweaning HFD 
exposure decreased serotonergic innervation. The introduction 
of a HFD during a time of elevated social stress, resulting from 
weaning and novel group formation, coupled with a reduced 
ability to exhibit control over social stressors could lead to the 
development of social impairment and anxiety (53). We show this 
to be true: at the 11-month test as postweaning HFD exposure 
resulted in increased behavioral inhibition, stereotypy, elevated 
acute stress response, and impaired ability to habituate upon 
return to social group. The concentration of MnR projections to 
area 10, coupled with the divergent effects of postweaning HFD, 
implicate this serotonergic pathway in the aberrant circuitry of 
depressive and anxiety disorders, particularly social anxiety.
The MnR’s exclusive innervation of the arcuate nucleus likewise 
implicates it in serotonergic regulation of metabolic pathways 
(65). Accordingly, we observed in this model that postweaning 
HFD consumption reduced AgRP fibers, this time in the arcuate 
nucleus (20). The increased baseline activity and hypophagia (20) 
seen in postweaning HFD offspring could correspond to this 
reduction in AgRP innervation, consistent with the body weight 
“set-point” hypothesis and altered energy balance. We observed 
a predictive effect between MnR TPH2 expression and GAUC, 
further evidence that postweaning HFD-induced TPH2 changes 
can disrupt hypothalamic metabolic homeostasis. Long-term 
metabolic disturbances, such as glucose intolerance and obesity, 
can originate from impaired function of hypothalamic neurons 
(77). Our findings in the MnR reflect established links between 
metabolic and anxiety disorders, and further explain the unique 
anxiety differences seen in postweaning HFD offspring.
By way of homologous but independent pathways, the MnR 
and DR express similar influence over frontal and HPA functions, 
an influence which is impaired by ontogenetic HFD exposure. The 
timing specific effects of HFD exposure on the direction and loca-
tion of TPH2 expression support our results indicating maternal 
and postweaning HFD consumption generate unique behavioral 
and physiological changes. The incorporation of gender as a risk 
factor for anxiety further explains our results (80). HFD females 
display anxiety earlier than males, and are more impacted by the 
compounded effects of maternal and postweaning HFD exposure. 
Males appear to be selectively affected by postweaning HFD expo-
sure, with chronic suppression of HPA function and decreased 
serotonin immunoreactive fibers in the PFC. Importantly, any 
developmental HFD exposure causes long-term aberrations in the 
serotonergic system, with risk factors such as exposure period and 
gender contributing to differential pathology presentation.
Our findings in the central serotonin system suggest neural 
mechanisms for differential anxiety development in HFD-
exposed NHP offspring, and provide evidence that childhood 
diet impacts neural development. While other factors in our 
model, such as maternal obesity and hyperinsulinemia, may also 
influence offspring development, chronic HFD exposure is the 
primary mediator of the observed impairments in behavior and 
brain development. This hypothesis was generated based on pre-
vious findings from our group demonstrating that, independent 
of maternal adiposity, increasing maternal dietary fat contributes 
to elevated offspring percent body fat, inflammatory markers, 
and stress activation (19, 21). Investigation of the later postnatal 
period reaffirmed these results as postnatal HFD consumption 
had no effect on weight gain or metabolic rate (20), and still 
increased inflammatory response. In combination with our 
results of maternal and postweaning HFD exposure altering neu-
ral development independent of juvenile metabolic phenotype, 
evidence strongly suggests that the diet—not resulting metabolic 
phenotype—is the primary source of mechanistic control.
We postulate that the observed HFD-induced behavioral 
and serotonergic impairments are due to increased exposure 
to pro-inflammatory factors. In our NHP model, we previously 
documented increased circulating and hypothalamic cytokines 
in fetal HFD offspring at the third trimester (16). Neural devel-
opment is susceptible to the deleterious effects of inflammatory 
stress, particularly the serotonin system. Serotonergic neurons 
are sensitive to inflammatory events, as elevation of inflammatory 
cytokines in rats reduced the survival of embryonic serotonin 
neurons in the rostral raphe (81) and resulted in degeneration of 
serotonergic axons in the amygdala and PFC (82). NHP offspring 
prenatally exposed to pro-inflammatory Immunoglobulin G 
class antibodies from mothers of children with ASD displayed 
increased anxiety responses such as stereotypy and hyperactivity, 
indicative of serotonergic dysfunction (83). In humans elevated 
levels of inflammatory cytokines in obese pregnant women are 
associated with increased risk of anxiety, depression, and ASD 
(84). As the brainstem raphe nuclei are the main center for 
serotonin production, they are likely key to these perturbations.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that HFD consumption dur-
ing early development has long-lasting effects on NHP offspring 
behavior and brain development. Maternal HFD changes appear 
to be due to developmental programming as the behavioral and 
serotonergic pathologies produced are unaffected by early dietary 
intervention. Female offspring are particularly prone to maternal 
HFD effects. Postweaning HFD consumption was found to exac-
erbate behavioral inhibition and increase stereotypy, especially 
in males. Future studies will address the relative importance of 
maternal diet and obesity in offspring development, and inves-
tigate the impact of specific dietary components. Changes in 
early postnatal environmental factors including maternal mental 
health and maternal-infant interactions may explain some of the 
observed behavioral and neuroendocrinological dysfunctions. 
Further studies will directly examine the impact of developmental 
HFD exposure on offspring social behavior and cognition. Given

the high prevalence of HFD consumption and obesity in devel-
oped countries, and the potential these factors have to increase 
the risk of developing neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental 
disorders, it is crucial that future studies identify efficacious 
therapeutic interventions.
