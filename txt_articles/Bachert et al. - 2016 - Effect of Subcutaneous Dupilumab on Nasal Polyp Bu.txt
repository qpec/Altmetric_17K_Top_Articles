IMPORTANCE Dupilumab has demonstrated efficacy in patients with asthma and atopic
dermatitis, which are both type 2 helper T-cell–mediated diseases.
OBJECTIVE To assess inhibition of interleukins 4 and 13 with dupilumab in patients with
chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
parallel-group study conducted at 13 sites in the United States and Europe between August
2013 and August 2014 in 60 adults with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis refractory to
intranasal corticosteroids with 16 weeks of follow-up.
INTERVENTIONS Subcutaneous dupilumab (a 600 mg loading dose followed by 300 mg
weekly; n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) plus mometasone furoate nasal spray for 16 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in endoscopic nasal polyp score (range, 0-8; higher
scores indicate worse status) at 16 weeks (primary end point). Secondary end points included
Lund-Mackay computed tomography (CT) score (range, 0-24; higher scores indicate worse
status), 22-item SinoNasal Outcome Test score (range, 0-110; higher scores indicating worse
quality of life; minimal clinically important difference �8.90), sense of smell assessed using
the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) score (range, 0-40; higher
scores indicate better status), symptoms, and safety.
RESULTS Among the 60 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 48.4 years
[9.4 years]; 34 men [56.7%]; 35 with comorbid asthma), 51 completed the study. The least
squares (LS) mean change in nasal polyp score was −0.3 (95% CI, −1.0 to 0.4) with placebo
and −1.9 (95% CI, −2.5 to −1.2) with dupilumab (LS mean difference, −1.6 [95% CI, −2.4 to
−0.7]; P < .001). The LS mean difference between the 2 groups for the Lund-Mackay CT total
score was −8.8 (95% CI, −11.1 to −6.6; P < .001). Significant improvements with dupilumab
were also observed for the 22-item SinoNasal Outcome Test (LS mean difference between
groups, −18.1 [95% CI, −25.6 to −10.6]; P < .001) and sense of smell assessed by UPSIT
(LS mean difference, 14.8 [95% CI, 10.9 to 18.7]; P < .001). The most common adverse events
were nasopharyngitis (33% in the placebo group vs 47% in the dupilumab group), injection
site reactions (7% vs 40%, respectively), and headache (17% vs 20%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with symptomatic chronic sinusitis and nasal
polyposis refractory to intranasal corticosteroids, the addition of subcutaneous dupilumab to
mometasone furoate nasal spray compared with mometasone alone reduced endoscopic
nasal polyp burden after 16 weeks. Further studies are needed to assess longer treatment
duration, larger samples, and direct comparison with other medications.

C
hronic sinusitis, an inflammatory condition of
the sinuses, is common with estimates of prevalence
as high as 12% in Western populations.1,2 It is charac-
terized by specific symptoms often lasting for many
years including nasal congestion, discharge and postnasal
drip, decreased or lost
sense of smell, facial pain
and pressure, headache,
and the consequences
thereof.3 Based on endo-
scopic findings, the con-
dition can be divided into
chronic sinusitis with or
without nasal polyposis.
Typically observed in the
context of eosinophilic
inflammation of the upper airways, nasal polyps originate in
the sinuses and obstruct the sinus and nasal passages.
Medical management of chronic sinusitis with nasal
polyposis focuses on controlling tissue inflammation and,
depending on severity, includes use of intranasal corticoste-
roids, nasal saline irrigation, antibiotics, or short-course oral
steroids.3 In patients in whom polyps and symptoms persist
despite medical treatment, surgical excision is considered.
However, disease recurrence after surgery approaches 50% in
patients with tissue eosinophilia,4 and resolution of symp-
toms, including sense of smell loss, is often incomplete.
Epidemiological data from a large European cohort indi-
cate that chronic sinusitis is associated with a 3.5-fold
increase in comorbid asthma prevalence.5 Although type 2
helper T-cell inflammation is implicated in this association,
the mechanisms of this association have not been fully
elucidated.6-8
Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to the
interleukin 4 (IL-4) receptor α subunit, which inhibits signal-
ing of IL-4 and IL-13, 2 cytokines central to type 2 helper
T-cell–mediated inflammation. Dupilumab has demonstrated
clinical efficacy in the type 2 helper T-cell–mediated diseases
of asthma and atopic dermatitis,9-11 and also improved sino-
nasal symptoms in patients with asthma.9
We hypothesized that the addition of dupilumab to intra-
nasal corticosteroids would improve endoscopic, radio-
graphic, and patient-reported measures of disease activity in
those with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis, while also
improving lung function and disease control in patients with
comorbid asthma.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-
group study was conducted at 13 sites in the United States
and Europe (Belgium, Spain, and Sweden) between August
2013 and August 2014. A 4-week run-in period was followed
by 16 weeks of blinded treatment and 16 weeks of follow-up.
The trial protocol (Supplement 1) was approved by the
institutional review board at each study site or by a central
institutional review board. All patients provided written
informed consent and were given a stipend as governed by
local regulations.
Eligible patients were aged 18 to 65 years with bilateral
nasal polyposis and chronic symptoms of sinusitis despite
intranasal corticosteroid treatment for at least 2 months.
Patients were required to have a bilateral endoscopic nasal
polyp score of at least 5 (maximum score of 8), with a score of
at least 2 for each nostril, and manifest at least 2 of the fol-
lowing symptoms prior to screening: nasal obstruction or dis-
charge, facial pain or pressure, and reduction or lost sense of
smell. Patients were excluded if they: (1) had previously par-
ticipated in any clinical trial of dupilumab; (2) had received
corticosteroids (oral or intranasal), monoclonal antibodies,
immunosuppressive treatment, or anti–immunoglobulin E
(anti-IgE) therapy during the 2 months preceding the screen-
ing; (3) had undergone any nasal surgery within 6 months
prior to screening or had more than 2 surgeries for nasal
polyposis in the past; or (4) had concomitant conditions mak-
ing them not evaluable for the primary end point.
A prespecified enrollment goal was that 50% of the pa-
tients had comorbid asthma. The diagnosis of asthma was
based on patient history. The participants with asthma were
required to have (1) a forced expiratory volume in the first
second of expiration (FEV1) of more than 60% of predicted,
(2) taken daily inhaled corticosteroids of no more than 1000
μg of fluticasone (or equivalent), and (3) not had an asthma ex-
acerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids or hospitaliza-
tion within the previous 3 months.
Study Treatments
After a 4-week run-in period of treatment with mometasone
furoate nasal spray (100 μg in each nostril twice daily), pa-
tients were randomly allocated (1:1) using an interactive voice
or web-response system to add-on therapy with subcutane-
ous dupilumab (a 600 mg loading dose followed by 15 weekly
doses of 300 mg) or matched placebo for 16 weeks. Random-
ization was performed with the use of a centralized computer-
generated, permuted-block schedule with block size of 4
and stratification factors of visit 1 medical history of asthma
(yes or no) and visit 2 nasal biopsy (yes or no).
Dupilumab and placebo were provided in identical and in-
distinguishable treatment kits, and study patients, investiga-
tors, and site personnel were blinded to study treatment.
Mometasonefuroatenasalspraywascontinuedatastabledose
throughout the treatment period. Inhaled asthma controller
therapies could be continued.
Outcomes
The primary efficacy end point was mean change in bilateral
endoscopic nasal polyp score from baseline to week 16. This
score is graded based on polyp size (recorded as the sum of the
right and left nostril scores with a range of 0-8; higher scores
indicate worse status).12 Video recordings of endoscopies were
sent to an independent reviewer for centralized blinded data
assessment.
Secondary end points included change in the Lund-
Mackay computed tomography (CT) score, percentage of max-
MCID minimally clinically important
difference

repeated measures

illarysinusvolumeoccupiedbydisease,22-itemSinoNasalOut-
come Test (SNOT-22) score, University of Pennsylvania Smell
Identification Test (UPSIT) score, and peak nasal inspiratory
flow. The secondary end points also included patient-rated na-
sal congestion or obstruction, anterior and posterior rhinor-
rhea, loss in sense of smell, nocturnal awakenings, and over-
allsymptomseverity.Inpatientswithasthma,nasalpolypscore
was also a predefined secondary end point.
The Lund-Mackay CT score evaluates the patency of each
sinus using a 0 to 2 scale (0 = normal; 2 = total opacification)
and has a total score range from 0 to 24 (higher scores indi-
cate more opacification).13,14 The 22-question SNOT-22 is
scored as 0 (no problem) to 5 (problem as bad as it can be) with
a total range from 0 to 110 (higher scores indicate poorer out-
comes); a minimally clinically important difference (MCID) of
8.90 has been established.15 The UPSIT was administered ev-
ery 8 weeks; scores range from 0 to 40 (higher scores of 35-40
indicate normal sense of smell and lower scores of 0-18 indi-
cate anosmia).16,17
Individual signs and symptoms were captured daily
(AM and PM) by patients using an electronic diary and a cat-
egorical scale (0 = no symptoms; 3 = severe symptoms).18
Peak nasal inspiratory flow was also measured daily (AM and
PM). A visual analog scale was used every 4 weeks to measure
symptom severity, ranging from 0 (not troublesome) to 10
(worst thinkable), with total scores of 0 to 3 indicating pres-
ence of mild symptoms, greater than 3 to 7 indicating moder-
ate symptoms, and greater than 7 to 10 indicating severe
symptoms.18
Exploratory end points in patients with asthma were
changes in FEV1 (measured in liters) and FEV1 percent pre-
dicted; the 5-question Asthma Control Questionnaire as-
sessed asthma control.19 The 5-question Asthma Control
Questionnaire is scored on a 7-point scale (0 = no impair-
ment; 6 = maximum impairment) with an MCID of 0.5.20 Fur-
ther details on outcomes appear in eTable 1 in Supplement 2.
Pharmacodynamic measurements included total serum
IgE, blood eosinophil count, serum thymus and activation-
regulated chemokine (TARC) level, and plasma eotaxin-3 level;
the latter 2 are involved in the chemotaxis of type 2 helper
T-cells and eosinophils, respectively. These pharmacody-
namic measurements were collected at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and
16. Safety and tolerability assessments were based on the in-
cidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, as well
as vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory evalu-
ation, and 12-lead electrocardiogram findings.
Statistical Analysis
Efficacy analyses were performed using the intent-to-treat
(ITT) population, which was predefined as all patients who
were randomized. The safety data set comprised all random-
ized patients exposed to study medication. Statistical analy-
ses were conducted using SAS nQuery Advisor version 6.01
(SAS Institute Inc).
The primary efficacy variable in the ITT population was
analyzed using a mixed-effect model with repeated mea-
sures (MMRM) approach. The model included change
while receiving treatment from baseline to follow-up time
points every 4 weeks through week 16 as response variables,
fixed-effects factors for treatment, stratification (comorbid
asthma, biopsy performed), visit, treatment × visit interac-
tion, nasal polyp score baseline value, and baseline × visit
interaction. The model did not impute missing data points. An
unstructured correlation matrix was used to model the within-
patient errors. Parameters were estimated using the re-
stricted maximum likelihood method with the Newton-
Raphson algorithm.
With approximately 28 patients per group, the study was
predicted to have 80% power to detect a between-group dif-
ference of 1.3 in reduction of nasal polyp score from baseline
using a 2-sided t test at the .05 significance level, and assum-
ing a common standard deviation of 1.5 and a dropout rate of
20%. A sensitivity analysis also was performed using mul-
tiple imputation based on the placebo group to fill in the miss-
ing data, and an MMRM model was then built for the primary
efficacy variable. Missing data that were not in a monotonic
pattern were first imputed using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo
method.
The rest of the missing data in both treatment groups were
sequentially imputed by visit based only on the observed data
of patients in the placebo group. This method should be con-
sidered as a conservative approach for a sensitivity analysis.
The change from baseline to week 16 in percentage of maxil-
lary sinus volume occupied by disease and Lund-Mackay score
were analyzed using analysis of covariance models. The mod-
els include change from baseline as the response variable, and
treatment, stratification factors, and baseline value as covar-
iates.Thechangefrombaselineforothercontinuousendpoints
was analyzed using an MMRM, which was the same analysis
as described for the primary end point.
A prespecified responder analysis of patients with a re-
ductioninnasalpolypscoreofatleast1.0frombaselinetoweek
16 was performed using logistic regression, including terms for
treatment, stratification, and treatment × stratification inter-
action. An analysis of covariance model was used for the CT
scan end points of Lund-Mackay total score and percentage of
maxillary sinus volume occupied by disease. The factors in the
model include treatment, stratification factors, and baseline
values.
Descriptive statistics were used for demographics, base-
line characteristics, and safety variables. Plots of secondary
and pharmacodynamic variables are presented as mean or
percentage change from baseline over time. Comparison of
treatment effects from the MMRM analyses are based on the
least squares mean change (with 95% confidence intervals
and P values) from baseline to week 16. A 2-sided t test with a
.05 significance level was used.
Results
Of 86 patients screened, 60 patients with chronic sinusitis and
nasal polyposis were randomized (Figure 1). Among the 60 pa-
tients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 48.4 years [9.4
years]; 34 men [56.7%]; 35 with comorbid asthma), 51 com-
pleted the study. Thirty patients were assigned to each treat-

ment group (ITT population). All patients received at least 1
dose of the study drug.
Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics were
similar between the 2 groups (Table 1). There were 23 pa-
tients in the placebo group who completed the 16-week treat-
ment period and 28 in the dupilumab group. Of the 7 patients
in the placebo group who prematurely withdrew study treat-
ment, 5 prematurely discontinued the study due to experi-
encing an adverse event and 2 due to lack of efficacy (Figure 1).
Two patients in the dupilumab group did not complete treat-
ment due to experiencing an adverse event.
Primary End Point
The least squares mean change in bilateral endoscopic nasal
polyp score between baseline and week 16 was −0.3 (95% CI,
−1.0to0.4)intheplaceboplusmometasonefuroatenasalspray
groupand−1.9(95%CI,−2.5to−1.2)inthedupilumabplusmo-
metasone furoate nasal spray group (least squares mean dif-
ference, −1.6 [95% CI, −2.4 to −0.7], P < .001; Table 2 and
Figure 2A). A sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation re-
sulted in a least squares mean change in bilateral endoscopic
nasal polyp score between baseline and week 16 of −0.4 (95%
CI, −1.1 to 0.3) in the placebo plus mometasone furoate nasal
spray group and −1.8 (95% CI, −2.5 to −1.2) in the dupilumab
plus mometasone furoate nasal spray group (least squares
mean difference, −1.5 [95% CI, −2.4 to −0.5]; P = .002).
In an additional analysis of this end point, improvement
of at least 1 point in the nasal polyp score was observed in 20%
of the patients who received placebo vs 70% of those who re-
ceived dupilumab (odds ratio [OR], 9.5 [95% CI, 2.8 to 31.8],
P < .001). Furthermore, the improvement in nasal polyp score
with dupilumab vs placebo was observed at week 4, which was
the first postbaseline assessment (least squares mean differ-
ence, −1.03 [95% CI, −1.58 to −0.49]; P < .001).
Secondary End Points
Radiographic and Inspiratory Flow
The least squares mean change from baseline to week 16 for
the Lund-Mackay CT total score was −0.2 (95% CI, −2.1 to 1.7)
with placebo plus mometasone furoate nasal spray and −9.1
(95% CI, −10.7 to −7.5) with dupilumab plus mometasone fu-
roate nasal spray (least squares mean difference, −8.8 [95% CI,
−11.1to−6.6],P < .001;Table2).Theleastsquaresmeanchange
in percentage of maxillary sinus volume occupied by disease
was −4.2 (95% CI, −13.5 to 5.2) with placebo and −36.4 (95%
CI, −44.4 to −28.4) with dupilumab (least squares mean dif-
ference, −32.2 [95% CI, −43.1 to −21.4]; P < .001).
The least squares mean change from baseline to week 16
for morning peak nasal inspiratory flow was 27.1 L/min (95%
CI, 12.1-42.1 L/min) with placebo plus mometasone furoate na-
sal spray and 60.2 L/min (95% CI, 45.6-74.7 L/min) with du-
pilumab plus mometasone furoate nasal spray (least squares
meandifference,33.1L/min[95%CI,12.7-53.5L/min],P = .002;
Table 2 and Figure 2B).
Quality of Life and Daily Symptoms
There was improvement from baseline to week 16 for the
SNOT-22 total score in patients treated with dupilumab plus
mometasone furoate nasal spray vs those treated with pla-
cebo plus mometasone furoate nasal spray (least squares mean
difference, −18.1 [95% CI, −25.6 to −10.6], P < .001; Table 2 and
Figure 3A). This effect exceeded the MCID of 8.90.15
Significant improvements favoring dupilumab were
observed with improved UPSIT scores for sense of smell,
decreases in morning posterior rhinorrhea (Figure 3B-C),
decreases in morning symptoms of nasal congestion or
obstruction (Table 2), decreases in morning anterior rhinor-
rhea, increases in subjective sense of smell, decreases in eve-
ning symptoms, and decreases in nocturnal awakenings
(eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Nasal Polyp Score in Patients With Comorbid Asthma
In the subset of patients with comorbid asthma (n = 35), the
leastsquaresmeanchangeinnasalpolypscorewas−0.02(95%
CI, −0.9 to 0.8) with placebo plus mometasone furoate nasal
spray and −2.3 (95% CI, −3.2 to −1.4) with dupilumab plus mo-
metasone furoate nasal spray (least squares mean difference,
−2.3 [95% CI, −3.4 to −1.2], P < .001; Figure 4A). An improve-
ment of at least 1 point in nasal polyp score was observed in
10.5% of patients who received placebo vs 75.0% of those who
received dupilumab (OR, 26.1 [95% CI, 3.8 to 179.3]; P < .001).

with asthma also experienced improvements with dupilumab
in UPSIT score, SNOT-22 total score, and symptoms of conges-
tion (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
In patients without asthma, a dupilumab-specific effect
was observed for the Lund-Mackay total score, UPSIT score,
SNOT-22totalscore,self-reportedsenseofsmellloss,andother
clinical end points; however, dupilumab did not lead to a sig-
nificant reduction in endoscopic nasal polyp score (eTable 5
in Supplement 2).
Pharmacodynamic and Type 2 Helper
T-cell–Associated Biomarkers
Levels of total serum IgE, serum TARC, and plasma eotaxin-3
expressed as least squares mean percentage changes from
baseline decreased with dupilumab plus mometasone
furoate nasal spray vs placebo plus mometasone furoate
nasal spray (Table 2 and Figure 5A-C). Relative reductions
in IgE with dupilumab progressed over the 16-week treat-
ment period (P = .05 vs placebo at week 4 and P < .001 at
each remaining assessment).
Levels of eotaxin-3 decreased significantly with dupil-
umabplusmometasonefuroatenasalsprayvsplacebobyweek
2 and remained reduced throughout the treatment period (all
P ≤ .001 vs placebo). Levels of TARC decreased significantly
with dupilumab vs placebo by week 2 (P < .001 vs placebo),
remainedsignificantlyreducedthroughweek12(P < .001),and
tended to remain decreased at week 16 (P = .13). Transient in-
creases in blood eosinophil count occurred in some patients
after initiation of dupilumab treatment; however, the mean
blood eosinophil count was unchanged in both groups at week
16 (Figure 5D).
Safety
Adverse events were reported by 25 of 30 patients in the pla-
cebo group and 30 of 30 in the dupilumab group (eTable 6 in
Supplement 2). Mild-to-moderate nasopharyngitis (33% in the
placebo group vs 47% in the dupilumab group), injection site
reactions (7% vs 40%, respectively), and headache (17% vs
20%) were the most frequent adverse events.
Six patients had serious adverse events: 4 in the placebo
group (uterine cancer, transient ischemic attack, asthma, and
nasal polyp) and 2 in the dupilumab group (one with herpes
zosterandtheotherwitharrhythmiaandupperextremitypain
or numbness). No serious adverse events were considered to
be related to dupilumab.
Five patients in the placebo group experienced an ad-
verseeventthatledtodiscontinuationofstudydrug(otitisme-
dia, bronchitis, hypersensitivity, headache, hypertension,
asthma, and abdominal pain), as did 2 in the dupilumab group
(constipation and injection site reaction). No clinically delete-
rious changes in vital signs, physical examination, laboratory
testing, or electrocardiogram were observed with dupilumab
compared with placebo.
There were no deaths during the active treatment period.
One patient died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm during the
screening period prior to having been randomized to active
treatment.

with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis refractory to
intranasal corticosteroids alone, dupilumab treatment was
associated with significant improvements in endoscopic,
clinical, radiographic, and pharmacodynamic end points
after 16 weeks. Although an MCID for nasal polyp score has
not yet been established, the observed effect exceeded that
of other approved treatments21 and was supported by mean-
ingful changes in several other objective clinical and radio-
graphic parameters, including significant improvement in
CT scores.
Furthermore, significant improvements in quality of life
(assessed by SNOT-22) and in major symptoms, such as sub-
jective sense of smell, nasal obstruction or congestion, and
nocturnal awakenings, were reported. Dupilumab was gen-
erally well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were
considered to be related to dupilumab. Although injection
site reactions were more frequent in patients treated with
dupilumab vs placebo, there was no safety signal that con-
tributed to excess study discontinuations in the dupilumab
group.
Surgery is recommended as the next treatment option
for patients who experience medical therapy failure3; how-
ever, a substantial proportion of patients experience post-
surgical recurrence and require additional surgery.4,22
Although this trial was not designed to determine if dupil-
umab could delay or reduce surgical intervention, 58% of
the study population had undergone prior surgery for nasal
polyps, suggesting a potential role for dupilumab in this
patient population.
Theclinicalimprovementsobservedwithdupilumabtreat-
ment throughout the study appeared to be similar to that of
the anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab23 (another
biologicaltherapy)intheITTpopulationandtothatoftheanti-
IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab12 in the subgroup of pa-
tients with concomitant asthma; however, head-to-head stud-
ies are needed to draw conclusions.
These data suggest that signaling pathways mediated by
IL-4 and IL-13 are important to the pathogenesis of chronic si-
nusitis with nasal polyposis, and that blocking these path-
ways leads to significant clinical benefit.
The improvements observed in patients with nasal
polyposis and comorbid asthma are in line with data from
patients with severe asthma observed in phase 2 studies of
dupilumab, which suggest that dupilumab treatment
improves both upper and lower airway inflammation. In the
present trial, improvements were observed in endoscopic
nasal polyp scores (a prespecified secondary end point) and
in asthma control and lung function (exploratory end
points) in patients with asthma. Mechanistically, these clini-
cal observations support earlier reports7,8 suggesting that
nasal polyposis and asthma share the same underlying type
2 helper T-cell inflammation.9 Elevations in levels of bio-
markers associated with type 2 helper T cells (relative to
controls), including eotaxin-3, TARC, and IgE, and their
reduction by dupilumab herein, as well as in studies of
patients with asthma9 and atopic dermatitis,11 further sup-
port a common set of underlying type 2 helper T-cell inflam-
matory mechanisms in these diseases.

As a proof-of-concept trial, this study had some limita-
tions. The number of participants (60 patients) was small, al-
though this sample size was based on calculations identify-
ing it as adequate to test the central hypothesis. The study
duration was 16 weeks, limiting our ability to comment on the
effect of dupilumab during long-term treatment.
In addition, the absence of an established MCID for nasal
polyp score presents a challenge for interpreting the clinical
effect of dupilumab on the primary end point of the study.
The least squares mean change from baseline at week 16 was
−0.30 (SE, 0.34) in the placebo group and −1.85 (SE, 0.30) in
the dupilumab group (least squares mean difference, −1.55
[95% CI, −2.43 to −0.67]; P < .001).
A previous study using a nasal polyp score with a nar-
rower range (0-6 as opposed to 0-8 for the score in the cur-
rent study) showed that intranasal corticosteroid treatment
(a standard therapy for nasal polyposis) led to a mean
change of −0.5 vs placebo. A study21 using the same nasal
polyp score as the current study showed a peak difference
vs placebo of approximately −2.2 for systemic corticoste-
roids alone, without intranasal corticosteroids, in patients
with nasal polyposis.
Because intranasal corticosteroids are the only approved
treatment for nasal polyps, there is currently no suitable
comparator drug available for long-term treatment. Further
studies will be needed to investigate the potential use of
dupilumab as adjunct therapy or in direct comparison with
other medications or surgery.24 In addition, 25% of partici-
pants (7/30) in the placebo group discontinued therapy. How-
ever, a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation found
similar results, suggesting that this dropout rate is unlikely to
have biased the study findings.

Conclusions
Among adults with symptomatic chronic sinusitis and nasal
polyposis refractory to intranasal corticosteroids, the addi-
tion of subcutaneous dupilumab to mometasone furoate na-
sal spray compared with mometasone alone reduced endo-
scopic nasal polyp burden after 16 weeks. Further studies are
neededtoassesslongertreatmentduration,largersamples,and
direct comparison with other medications.
