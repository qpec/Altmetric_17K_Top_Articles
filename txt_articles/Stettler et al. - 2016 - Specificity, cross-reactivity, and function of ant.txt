Zika virus (ZIKV),amosquito-borne flavivirus withhomology toDenguevirus (DENV),hasbecome a
public health emergency. By characterizing memory lymphocytes from ZIKV-infected patients, we
dissected ZIKV-specific and DENV–cross-reactive immune responses. Antibodies to nonstructural
protein 1 (NS1) were largely ZIKV-specific and were used to develop a serological diagnostic tool. In
contrast, antibodies against E protein domain I/II (EDI/II) were cross-reactive and, although
poorly neutralizing, potently enhanced ZIKV and DENV infection in vitro and lethally enhanced
DENVdisease in mice. Memory Tcells against NS1 or E proteins were poorlycross-reactive,even in
donors preexposed to DENV.The most potent neutralizing antibodies were ZIKV-specific and
targeted EDIII or quaternary epitopes on infectious virus. An EDIII-specific antibody protected
mice from lethal ZIKV infection, illustrating the potential for antibody-based therapy.
A
fter its introduction into Brazil in 2015,
Zika virus (ZIKV) has spread rapidly, and in
February 2016, the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) declared it a Public Health Emer-
gency of International Concern (1–3). The
main route of ZIKV infection is through bites by
Aedes mosquitos, but the virus may also be sex-
ually (4) and vertically transmitted (5). Although
most of the ZIKV infections are asymptomatic
or cause only mild symptoms, there is evidence
that ZIKV infection can lead to neurological com-
plications, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome in
adults (6) and congenital birth defects, including
microcephaly in the developing fetus (5, 7, 8),
likely through its ability to infect human neural
progenitor cells (9).
Whereas flavivirus envelope (E) proteins medi-
ate fusion and are the main target of neutralizing
antibodies, the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is
secretedbyinfectedcellsandisinvolvedinimmune
evasion and pathogenesis (10). Two recent studies
showed a high level of structural similarity be-
tween the E protein of ZIKV and that of other
flaviviruses—such as dengue virus (DENV), yellow
fever virus (YFV), and West Nile virus (WNV)—
but also revealed distinct features that may be
related to the ZIKV neurotropism (11, 12). Sim-
ilarly, the structural analysis of ZIKV NS1 re-
vealed conserved features with NS1 of other
flaviviruses, although with different electrostatic
characteristics (13).
A phenomenon that is characteristic of certain
flaviviruses is the disease-enhancing activity of
cross-reactive antibodies elicited by previous infec-
tions by heterologous viruses, termed antibody-
dependent enhancement (ADE). In the case of
DENV, for which four serotypes are known, there
is epidemiological evidence that a primary infection
protects from reinfection with the same serotype
but represents a risk factor for the development
of severe disease upon reinfection with a different
serotype (14). The exacerbated disease is triggered
by E- and prM-specific antibodies that fail to
neutralize the incoming virus but instead enhance
its capture by Fc receptor–expressing (FcR+) cells,
leading to enhanced viral replication and activa-
tion of cross-reactive memory T cells. The resulting
cytokine storm is thought to be the basis of the
most severe form of disease, known as dengue
hemorragic fever/dengue shock syndrome (15, 16).
Theroleof antibodiesinseveredengueissupported
by studies showing that waning levels of maternal
antibodies in infants represent a higher risk for
development of severe dengue disease (16–19).
Whether individuals with antibodies induced
by previous DENV infections can develop a more
severe ZIKV infection or have higher risk of fetal
transmission is unknown. Similarly, it is unclear
whether ZIKV antibodies may affect subsequent
DENVinfection.Therefore,itisimportanttodissect
the levelof cross-reactive immunityatthe Bcell and
T cell level in response to ZIKV infection.
To understand the role of antibodies in ZIKV
neutralization and heterologous enhancement of
flavivirus infection, we isolated a panel of 119
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from four ZIKV-
infected donors from the current epidemic, of
which two were DENV-naïve (ZA and ZD) and
two had serological records of DENV infection
(ZB and ZC) (table S1) (20). These mAbs were
selected from Epstein-Barr virus–immortalized
memory B cells on the basis of their binding to
ZIKV NS1 or E proteins and for their ability to neu-
tralize ZIKV infection, and were compared, side by
side, with a panel of mAbs previously isolated
from DENV-infected donors (21). The mAbs
were primarily immunoglobulin G (IgG), were
highly polyclonal, and carried a lower level of
somatic mutations as compared with that of other
acute or recurrent infections (fig. S1 and table S2).
Out of the 119 ZIKV-reactive mAbs isolated, 41
bound to NS1. ZIKV and DENV NS1 share 51 to
53% of amino acid identity (Fig. 1, A and B, and
fig. S2). The mAbs isolated from ZIKV-infected,
DENV-naïve donors were to a large extent ZIKV-
specific and did not cross-react to DENV NS1,
whereas those isolated from ZIKV-infected, DENV-
immune donors showed, as expected, a higher
degree of cross-reactivity (Fig. 1C, fig. S3, and
table S3). The limited cross-reactivity of NS1-
reactive mAbs from ZIKV-infected, DENV-naïve
donors was corroborated by the lack of reactivity
to DENV1-4 NS1 proteins of plasma from ZIKV-
infected, DENV-naïve donors (fig. S4). Conversely,
the plasma of the ZIKV-infected, DENV-immune
donors reacted strongly to DENV1-4 NS1 proteins,
which is consistent with a recall response to NS1
dominated by cross-reactive antibodies. Recipro-
cally, NS1-reactive mAbs isolated from DENV-
immune, ZIKV-naïve donors showed variable
patterns of cross-reactivity between DENV sero-
types but, with the exception of a single mAb,
did not cross-react with ZIKV NS1 (Fig. 1D, fig.
S5, and table S4).
Given the interest in developing a diagnostic
tool that would discriminate ZIKV-specific from
DENV-specific antibodies, we identified antigenic
sites (figs. S1 and S2) on NS1 targeted by ZIKV-
specific but not by cross-reactive mAbs (fig. S6,
A to D). MAbs reacting to two distinct sites on
ZIKVNS1wereusedinatwo-determinantimmuno-
assay soas to detect circulating NS1proteininbody
fluids during acute infection (fig. S6E). In addition,
mAb ZKA35 binding to the antigenic site S2 was
used as a probe in a blockade-of-binding assay (22)
soas todetect ZIKV-specific, butnotDENV-specific,
serum antibodies to NS1 (Fig. 1E) and has a po-
tential to be developed in a serological assay in
order to detect clinical and subclinical ZIKV in-
fections at the population level.

 Given the role of T cells in antibody production
and in immunopathology, we also investigated
the specificity and cross-reactivity of CD4+ memory
T cells from the same donors using the T cell
library method (Fig. 1, F and G) (23). NS1-specific
memory CD4+ T cells were present in the CXCR3+
T helper 1 (TH1) compartment and, with variable
frequencies, in the CXCR3– TH compartment. With
a few exceptions, these TH cells were specific for
either ZIKV or DENV NS1 (Fig. 1, F and G, and
fig. S7A), which is consistent with a low level of
T cell cross-reactivity, even in subjects who were
already exposed to DENV.
The E protein is formed by three domains: EDI,
which is involved in the conformational changes
required for viral entry; EDII, which contains the
fusion loop; and EDIII, which may be involved in
binding to cellular receptors (24). DI, DII, and
DIII of ZIKV and DENV share 35, 51, and 29%
amino acid identity, respectively (Fig. 2A). Ac-
cording to the structure of the ZIKV E protein
dimer (11, 12), the majority of the ZIKV- and DENV-
conserved solvent-accessible residues are located
in EDII, particularly in the fusion loop and the
neighboring region (Fig. 2B and fig. S8). Strik-
ingly, the majority of ZIKV EDI/II–specific mAbs
isolated from the four ZIKV donors (65%; 24 of 37)
cross-reacted with the E protein of all four DENV
serotypes (Fig. 2C, fig. S9, and table S5). Similarly, a
large proportion (67%; 31 of 46) of DENV EDI/II–
reactive mAbs isolated from DENV donors were
also cross-reactive with ZIKV E protein (Fig. 2D,
fig. S10, and table S6). These data indicate that
the human antibody response to the E protein
and in particular to EDI/II is cross-reactive be-
tween ZIKV and DENV, which is consistent with
previous reports on mAbs from mice immunized
with flavivirus antigens (11, 25). ZIKV-immune
plasma was also found to cross-react with ZIKV
and DENV1-4 E proteins (fig. S11), possibly because
of the abundant EDI/II cross-reactive antibody
response (21, 26–28).
In contrast, most of the EDIII-reactive mAbs
(90%; 27of 30)isolatedfromZIKVorDENV donors
were specific for either ZIKV or DENV E protein
(Fig. 2, C and D; figs. S9 and S10; and tables S5
and S6). In addition, whereas the EDI/II mAbs
showed only modest or even no neutralizing
activity against ZIKV infection, the EDIII-reactive
antibodies were overall more highly neutralizing
than EDI/II–reactive antibodies (table S5). By
screening for ZIKV neutralization, we also iso-
lated several highly potent neutralizing anti-
bodies that failed to bind to ZIKV E and EDIII
proteins (Fig. 2C). These mAbs, that we define
as neutralizing non-E-binding (NNB), could re-
cognize quaternary epitopes that are displayed
on the infectious virions but not on soluble pro-
teins, as recently demonstrated for DENV (29–31).
E-specific CD4+ T cells were primarily detected
in the CXCR3+ TH cell subset and, with only a
few exceptions, were specific for ZIKV E pro-
tein (Fig. 2, E and F, and fig. S7B). Furthermore,
E-reactive T cells directly isolated from ex vivo
cultures of memory CD4+ T cells of ZIKV- or
DENV-infected donors (fig. S12) did not cross-
react upon secondary stimulation with heter-
ologous E proteins (Fig. 2G). These findings
indicate an overall low level of T cell cross-
reactivity between ZIKV and DENV E proteins.
To address the biological properties of ZIKV
and DENV antibodies, we used a selected mAb
panel and measured in parallel their binding
(Fig. 3A), neutralizing, and ADE activity (Fig. 3,
B and C). This panel also contained Fc mutant
versions of mAbs that do not bind to FcgR and
complement [LALA mutants; leucine (L) to
alanine (A) substitution at the position 234 and
235] (21, 32). The EDIII-specific mAbs ZKA64
and ZKA190 and the NNB mAb ZKA230 were
highly potent in ZIKV neutralization, with median
inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 93, 9, and
10 ng/ml, respectively. Furthermore, all these
mAbs enhanced infection of ZIKV in the non-
permissive K562 human erythroleukemic cell
line at a broad range of concentrations, includ-
ing those that fully neutralized ZIKV infection
on Vero cell line. Whereas EDIII mAbs ZKA64
and ZKA190 did not enhance ZIKV infections
of K562 cells above 1 mg/ml, the NNB mAb
ZKA230 failed to do so, a result that might be
due to the different mechanisms of neutrali-
zation of free viruses versus FcgR-internalized
viruses. In contrast, the cross-reactive EDI/II–
specific mAbs ZKA3 and ZKA78 only partially
neutralized ZIKV infectivity, while effectively en-
hancing infection of K562 cells. Consistent with
their cross-reactivity, these EDI/II–specific mAbs
also neutralized and enhanced DENV1 infection.
The above results suggest that cross-reactive
antibodies elicited by either ZIKV or DENV in-
fectionandprimarilydirectedtoEDI/IIcanmediate
heterologous ADE. We therefore asked whether
ADE could be also induced with immune sera
and whether this could be blocked by neutraliz-
ing mAbs delivered in a LALA format (Fig. 3, D
and E). In a homologous setting, four ZIKV-
immune plasma collected from convalescent
patients showed similar capacity to enhance
ZIKV infection of K562 cells, and this ADE effect
was completely blocked by the EDIII-specific
ZKA64-LALA mAb, but only partially inhibited
by the cross-reactive EDI/II DV82-LALA mAb
(Fig. 3D). In a heterologous setting, the four
ZIKV-immune plasma strongly enhanced infec-
tion by DENV1 to levels comparable with those
observed with DENV3 plasma. The enhance-
ment of DENV1 infection by both ZIKV and
DENV3 plasma was completely inhibited by
DV82-LALA, but not by ZKA64-LALA because
of its lack of cross-reactivity to DENV1 (Fig. 3E).

 The ADE-blocking ability of a single EDIII-
specific LALA mAb could be related not only
to its capacity to out-compete serum-enhancing
antibodies but also to neutralize virus once in-
ternalized into endosomes, similarly to what has
been reported for the WNV-neutralizing antibody
E16 (33). Conversely, the lack of ADE-blocking
ability of DV82-LALA might be explained by
the inability of antibodies to EDI/II to effectively
neutralize endocytosed virus.
The above results suggest that previous ZIKV
and DENV immunity may pose a risk of a more
severe disease upon exposure to heterologous
virus through ADE. To address this possibility
in vivo, we selected two EDI/II cross-reactive
mAbs elicited by ZIKV (ZKA78) or DENV (DV82)
and tested them for their capacity to enhance in-
fection by DENV or ZIKV in animal models. Pre-
administration of ZKA78 or DV82, but not their
LALA versions, to DENV2-infected AG129 mice
led to severe symptoms and lethality by day 5
(Fig. 4A), suggesting that ZIKV immunity could
predispose to enhanced DENV pathology in vivo.
Given the high lethality of ZIKV infection in
immunodeficient mice (34–36), we investigated
a possible ZIKV disease–enhancing activity of
the DENV cross-reactive mAb DV82 in 129Sv/ev
immunocompetent mice that are not permissive
for productive ZIKV infection. However, in this
mouse model we did not observe signs of en-
hanced disease or infection (fig. S13).
To develop a therapeutic approach to ZIKV in-
fection, we tested the LALA form of the potently
neutralizing EDIII-specific mAb ZKA64 in pro-
phylactic and therapeutic settings. ZKA64-LALA
completely protected A129 mice challenged with a
lethal dose of ZIKV from body weight loss and
lethality when given 1 day before or 1 day after
ZIKV challenge (Fig. 4B).
This study reports the first characterization of
the human immune response to ZIKV infection.
The highly cross-reactive antibodies to EDI/II
elicited by ZIKV or DENV infection that are poorly
neutralizing but potently enhancing may pose
a risk for heterologous ADE. We have shown
in vitro and in a relevant animal model that an
EDI/II cross-reactive mAb raised by ZIKV can
induce lethal DENV infection. However, enhance-
ment of ZIKV infection by DENV-elicited cross-
reactive antibodies could be observed in vitro
but not in vivo, a finding that may be due to the
tropism of the virus or to the limitation of the
mouse model. It will be important to address this
issue in clinical and epidemiological studies,
which may be facilitated by the development of
serological diagnostics, such as the blockade-
of-binding assay described in this study.
T cells in flavivirus infections play a complex
role in both protection and pathogenesis (15).
The low degree of CD4+ T cell cross-reactivity
between DENV and ZIKV, which we observed
even in individuals who are immune to both
viruses, suggests that in ZIKV infection original
antigenic sin may not play a pathogenic role. Our
findings also suggest that the risk of cytokine
storm and consequent severe disease after en-
hanced heterologous infection of DENV by anti-
bodies to ZIKV may be mitigated by the poor
T cell cross-reactivity.
Our study describes two classes of potent
neutralizing antibodies that are specific for ZIKV
and directed either against EDIII or quaternary
epitopes present on infectious virus, the latter
being particularly frequent, similar to what has
been described in DENV (30). Given the high
potency and in vivo efficacy shown in this study,
these antibodies, developed in wild type or their
LALA versions produced in wild-type version
or in LALA version so as to avoid possible en-
hancement, could be used in prophylactic or ther-
apeutic settings to prevent congenital ZIKV
infection in pregnant women living in high-risk
areas (37).

Fig. 2. Specificity and cross-reactivity of E-reactive mAbs and T cells derived from ZIKV- and
DENV-infected donors. (A) Sequence conservation of E proteins as determined by the alignments
of ZIKV isolates and DENV1-4 reference strains, as shown in fig. S8. Conserved residues in EDI, EDII,
EDIII, and the hinge regions of the E protein are colored in red, yellow, blue, and green, respectively. FL,
fusion loop. (B) Structure of the ZIKV E protein dimer (PDB 5JHM). The two monomers are shown with
different shades of gray, and the residues conserved between ZIKV and DENV are colored as in (A).
(C and D) Heat map of the reactivity of (C) 78 mAbs derived from four ZIKV donors and (D) 61 mAbs
derived from nine DENV donors. NNB, neutralizing non-E-binding mAbs. The mAbs were tested for
binding to E-recombinant proteins of ZIKV and DENV1-4 (EC50, nanograms per milliliter). Also shown is
the virus-neutralizing activity (IC50, nanograms per milliliter). Strikethrough cells indicate not tested. Binding
curves of E-reactive mAbs are shown in figs. S9 and S10. The EC50 and IC50 values of E-reactive and NNB
mAbs are shown in tables S5 and S6. Data are representative of at least two independent experiments.
(E and F) T cell libraries were generated from CXCR3+ and CXCR3– memory CD4+ T cells of the four
ZIKV-infected donors and screened for reactivity against ZIKVor DENV1-4 E proteins by using 3H-thymidine
incorporation. Shown is the estimated number of ZIKV E–specific Tcells per 106 cells [mean + SEM and
color-coded values for individual donors (E)]. Also shown is the proliferation (cpm) of individual cultures to
either ZIKV E or DENV1-4 E proteins (F). The cultures from different donors are color-coded, and their
numbers are shown in parentheses. Dotted lines represent the cut-off value. (G) CD4+ CXCR3+ T cells
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a ZIKV-infected (ZB) or DENV-infected (DENV013) donor
were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and stimulated with ZIKV or DENV1-4
E proteins, respectively. Proliferating T cells were isolated by means of cell sorting, relabeled with CFSE,
and stimulated with the indicated proteins. Shown are the CFSE profiles on day 5.

Fig. 4. In vivo enhancement of DENV2 infection by an anti-ZIKVcross-reactive mAb and ZIKV thera-
peutic efficacy of a potent anti-ZIKV EDIII-specific mAb. (A) In vivo ADE. MAbs were administered
intraperitoneally to AG129 mice 20 to 24 hours before intravenous inoculation with 2.5 × 105 plaque-forming
units (PFU) of DENV2 D2S10. Results are representative of two independent experiments,with n = 8 mice for
the ZKA78 1 and 2-mg groups; n = 6 for the DV82 and all LALA mAb groups; and n = 4 for phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) group. (Left) A Kaplan-Meier survival curve is shown; significance was determined by using the
Mantel-Cox log-rank test. ZKA78 versus PBS, P = 0.0008; ZKA78 versus ZKA78-LALA, P = 0.0081; DV82
versus PBS, P = 0.0187; and DV82 versus DV82-LALA, P = 0.0255. (Right) Mice were monitored over a 10-day
period and scored for morbidity and mortality by using a standardized 5-point system (38). (B) Prophylaxis
and therapy of ZIKV infection. MAbs (15 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally to A129 mice (n = 6 mice)
24 hours before or after subcutaneous inoculation with 102 PFU of ZIKV MP1751. (T
op left) A Kaplan-Meier
survival curve is shown. (T
op right) Mice were monitored over a 13-day period for body weight loss. (Bottom)
Viral loads were measured on day 5 in blood of all animals and in blood and indicated tissues when animals
were culled at the end of the study or when the humane end points were met. Lines indicate geometric means.

(A) Binding of mAbs isolated from ZIKV-infected donors (blue) or from DENV-infected donors (red) to (left
and middle) recombinant ZIKV E and (right) to DENV1 E protein. Open and solid symbols indicate mAbs
specific orcross-reactive for ZIKVand DENV, respectively. (B) Neutralization of ZIKVand DENV1 as determined
by the percentage of infected Vero cells. (C) ADE of ZIKVand DENV1 infection of nonpermissive K562 cells, as
determined by the percentage of infected cells on day 5. (D and E) Inhibition of ADE by LALA mutant mAbs.
Serial dilutions of ZIKV- and DENV3-immune plasma were incubated with ZIKV or DENV1 before addition to
K562 cells in the absence or presence of a fixed amount (50 mg/ml) of ZKA64-LALA or DV82-LALA mAb.
Shown is the percentage of infected K562 cells on day 4. Blue and red symbols indicate plasma derived from
ZIKV- or DENV-infected donors, respectively. Data are representative of two independent experiments.
