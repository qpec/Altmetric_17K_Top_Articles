ABSTRACT:
Background:
Increasing
evidence
connects the gut microbiota and the onset and/or pheno-
type of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Differences in the abun-
dances of specific bacterial taxa have been reported in
PD patients. It is, however, unknown whether these differ-
ences can be observed in individuals at high risk, for
example, with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep
behavior disorder, a prodromal condition of a-synuclein
aggregation disorders including PD.
Objectives: To compare microbiota in carefully pre-
served nasal wash and stool samples of subjects with
idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder,
manifest PD, and healthy individuals.
Methods: Microbiota of flash-frozen stool and nasal
wash samples from 76 PD patients, 21 idiopathic rapid
eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients, and 78
healthy controls were assessed by 16S and 18S ribo-
somal RNA amplicon sequencing. Seventy variables,
related to demographics, clinical parameters including
nonmotor symptoms, and sample processing, were
analyzed in relation to microbiome variability and con-
trolled differential analyses were performed.
Results: Differentially abundant gut microbes, such as
Akkermansia, were observed in PD, but no strong differ-
ences in nasal microbiota. Eighty percent of the differ-
ential gut microbes in PD versus healthy controls
showed similar trends in idiopathic rapid eye movement
sleep behavior disorder, for example, Anaerotruncus
and several Bacteroides spp., and correlated with non-
motor symptoms. Metagenomic sequencing of select
samples enabled the reconstruction of genomes of so
far uncharacterized differentially abundant organisms.
Conclusion: Our study reveals differential abundan-
ces of gut microbial taxa in PD and its prodrome idio-
pathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in
comparison to the healthy controls, and highlights the
potential of metagenomics to identify and characterize
microbial taxa, which are enriched or depleted in PD
and/or idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior
disorder. V

 The classical pathological hallmarks of PD are Lewy
bodies and Lewy neurites comprised of aggregations
of the protein a-synuclein (aSyn). The latter are con-
sidered to lead to neuronal loss in the dopaminergic
SN of the central nervous system (CNS). Relatively
recently, aSyn aggregation has also been observed in
the peripheral nervous system (PNS).1-5 aSyn aggrega-
tion in the autonomic plexus of the intestine is even
hypothesized to represent a main source of the dis-
ease.1-6 In an epidemiological study, a decreased risk
for subsequent Parkinson’s disease (PD) was shown
after complete (but not selective) truncal vagotomy.7
This suggests that the vagal nerve may be critically
involved in the aSyn pathology of PD apparently
ascending from the PNS to the CNS.8 Furthermore,
inflammation and increased permeability of the muco-
sal lining of the colon have been shown in PD.1,9 Both
conditions are associated with the function of the gut
microbiota, whose members might therefore play the
roles of “drivers, perpetuators and mediators” of
PD.10 The olfactory bulb is also affected by aSyn
pathology in very early stages, reflected by hypo-
smia.6,8 Based on these observations, it has been sug-
gested
that
a
currently
unknown
infectious
or
otherwise transmissible agent may enter the brain
through the nasal cavity and/or gastrointestinal tract
and initiate the ascending pathological process to the
CNS as postulated in the “dual-hit hypothesis.”11 In
animal models, toxins can reach the CNS from the
olfactory bulb12 and aSyn aggregation triggered by
toxins or bacterial amyloid proteins in the enteric ner-
vous system can spread to the CNS.13,14
Several
recent
studies
have
reported
PD-related
changes in bacterial populations in the gut,15-21 but
different sample handling and preservation procedures
as well as confounding factors19 may account for
inconsistency22
between
the
reports.
Also,
less
is
known about the microbiome of the nasal cavity.23
Individuals likely to develop PD, who may already dis-
play differences in the periphery, have not been stud-
ied so far. Increasing evidence points toward a long
prodromal phase of PD, that is marked by nonmotor
symptoms1,9,24 and may start 20 to 30 years before
the diagnosis of motor PD. Longitudinal follow-up of
subjects with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep
behavior disorder (iRBD) has shown a high specificity
for later development of an aSyn aggregation disorder,
including PD, with a high conversion rate.24-26 Com-
parisons of PD patients to individuals with iRBD may
therefore be informative on the timing of changes,
which may influence future research on the role of
these microbiota in PD development and progression.
Here, we comprehensively analyze the microbiota of
the nasal cavity and the gut represented by carefully
preserved samples of deeply phenotyped PD patients
and healthy controls (HCs), as well as iRBD patients.
We identify taxa that differ (1) between PD patient
populations and HCs and (2) in comparison to the
prodrome iRBD and (3) within different nonmotor
symptoms in PD. Based on these analyses, we use
metagenomic shotgun sequencing of selected samples
to elucidate the functional potential of novel microbial
genomes that were observed to be differentially abun-
dant in PD versus HCs.
Materials and Methods
Ethics
The collection and analysis of PD samples was part
of the DeNoPa cohort that was conducted according
to the Declaration of Helsinki and with informed
written consent provided by all subjects. The study
was approved by the ethics committee of the Physi-
cian’s Board Hesse, Germany (Approval No. FF89/
2008) and the ethics committee of the Faculty of
Medicine, University Marburg, and has been regis-
tered
at
the
German
Register
for
Clinical
trials
(DRKS00000540) according to the World Health
Organization Trial Registration Data Set. The sample
analysis was approved by the Comit�
e National d’Ethi-
que de Recherche of Luxembourg (reference no.:
140174_ND).
Cohort and Clinical Assessments
Samples were collected from the already published
longitudinal DeNoPa cohort, comprising HCs and
patients with PD with in-depth clinical phenotyp-
ing.27,28 In addition, 21 subjects with iRBD diagnosed
according to the consensus criteria of the International
RBD Study group29 and no signs for neurodegenera-
tive disorder (by clinical examination and neuropsy-
chological testing) were enrolled at the same study
center. Comorbidities and comedication were docu-
mented. All subjects (PD, HC, and RBD) underwent
deep clinical characterization, including the Interna-
tional

 cohort. Only PD patients with verified clinical diagno-
sis after 24-month follow-up and after exclusion of
other neurological disorders (as described)27 were
included in this analysis. Only iRBD patients with a 2-
night video-assisted polysomnography (PSG)29 were
included in the study. All subjects were hospitalized
for at least 24 hours for all investigations of DeNoPa
(including PSG) at the same study center. Stool sam-
ples were collected into a stool specimen collector
(MedAuxil) and collection tubes (Sarstedt), which
were immediately flash-frozen on dry ice. Nasal wash
samples were collected as published37 by the applica-
tion of 2 mL of a 0.9% NaCl solution. Samples were
stored at –80 8C and shipped on dry ice.
Thawed nasal wash fluid was passed through a poly-
ethersulfone (PES) filter (25-mm diameter, 0.2-lm
pore size; Millipore, Billerica, MA) supported by a
membrane filter (25-mm diameter, 0.45-lm pore size;
Millipore) on a decontaminated Millipore vacuum
manifold. The PES filter was inserted into a Power
Soil Lysis tube (Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad,
CA), and DNA was extracted following the manufac-
turer’s recommendations.
Stool samples were aliquoted to 150 mg while still
frozen and stabilized as described previously.38 Micro-
bial pellets were separated by differential centrifuga-
tion and extracted
using the Qiagen AllPrep kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), as described previously,39
using
a
robotic
system
(Tecan
Group
Ltd.,
M€
annedorf. Switzerland). Quality and quantity were
assessed
using
a
Labchip
GX/GXII
touch
(Perki-
nElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA) and a NanoDrop spec-
trophotometer. Bacterial and human DNA content of
extractions from nasal wash fluid and corresponding
mock-extraction controls was quantified by quantita-
tive polymerase chain reaction as described40,41 (see
Supplementary Information).
16S and 18S Ribosomal RNA Gene Amplicon
Sequencing and Metagenome Analysis
The V4 regions of the 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA
(rRNA)
genes
were
amplified
and
sequenced
as
described,41 with modifications (see Supplementary
Information). Fifty-seven extraction controls, internal
standards,
and
replicate
samples
(Supplementary
Tables) were used to assess technical variability and
remove reagent-derived contaminant sequences from
low-biomass
nasal
samples
(see
Supplementary
Information).
Amplification
and
sequencing
were
performed
by
the
Groupe
Interdisciplinaire
de
G�
enoprot�
eomique Appliqu�
ee (GIGA; Lie
`ge, Belgium).
Raw demultiplexed sequencing reads from 16S rRNA
gene amplicon sequencing were processed using LotuS
(v1.47),42 to determine sequence counts per opera-
tional taxonomic unit (OTU). For the 18S sequencing
data, OTUs were selected and classified as previously
described.43 Further filtering and aggregation was per-
formed in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria),44 as described,41 with modifications
(see Supplementary Information).
Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing was per-
formed on libraries prepared from 500 ng of DNA on
a HiSeq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using HiSeq
V3 reagents. Metagenomic sequencing was conducted
at GATC Biotech AG (Konstanz, Germany). Metage-
nomic reads were processed and assembled using the
metaomic pipeline, IMP,45 and genome reconstruc-
tions were performed as described.38 Functional anno-
tations of genes were assigned as described.38,46 For
details, see Supplementary Information.

Numerical Ecology and Differential Analysis
All numerical analyses of OTU abundances were
performed in R (R Foundation for Statistical Comput-
ing).44 Rarefaction, calculation of rarefied richness,
estimation of de facto richness (ACE model), calcula-
tion of dispersion indices, and Procrustes analyses
were performed using vegan.48 Jensen-Shannon diver-
gences were calculated using phyloseq49 and principal
coordinate analyses performed using ape.50 UniFrac
distances were calculated using phyloseq49 from trees
built42 postfiltering using Clustal Omega51 and Fast-
Tree.52 Covariates were identified using permutational
multivariate analysis of variance (9,999 permutations),
as
described,53
and
potential
confounders
were
assessed using Fisher’s exact test and Kruskal-Wallis’
test, as described.19 Differential and regression analy-
ses were performed using DESeq2,54 with the covari-
ates found to be significant for each microbiome
(nasal: abundance � PD/RBD status * gender; gut:
abundance � PD/RBD status * diabetes status). Taxa
with multiple-testing adjusted P values below 0.05
(and an absolute log2 fold change > 1 for differential
analyses) were defined as significantly differentially
abundant or related to a continuous variable, respec-
tively.
Analysis
of

tion.55 Functional community profiles were predicted
based
on
classified
OTU
abundances
postfiltering
using PanFP,56 and differential analysis was carried
out on sum-normalized data sets using the Mann-
Whitney U test. All P values, except those used for the
detection of potential confounders, were adjusted for
multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (false
discovery rate; FDR) method.

 Results
Study Cohort and Samples
16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (to analyze the
relative abundances of bacteria and archaea) was suc-
cessfully performed on 84 flash-frozen stool samples
and 147 nasal wash samples from 76 PD patients
(66% male; mean age: 68.0 6 9.7) and 78 HCs (59%
male; mean age: 68.4 6 6.7) as well as from 21 iRBD
subjects (57% male; mean age: 66.1 6 7.9; P value
between the groups: 0.05) of the DeNoPa cohort
(Table 1 and Supplementary Tables). 18S rRNA gene
amplicon sequences (for profiling microeukaryotes)
were obtained for 61 of the stool samples (Supplemen-
tary Tables).
The two analyzed body sites exhibited obvious dif-
ferences in the density of microbial colonization (Fig.
1A), the number of different taxa in the community
(Fig. 1B), and community structures (Fig. 1C). At all
analyzed taxonomic levels (phylum, class, order, fam-
ily, genus, and OTU level), variation within the com-
munity structures was greater in the nasal samples
than
in
the
gastrointestinal
samples
(multivariate
homogeneity of group dispersions P value 5 0.0001;
Fig. 1D). In addition, the nasal data set was sparser,
that is, it contained less OTUs common to samples of
different individuals, with only a single OTU (of the
genus Corynebacterium) present in all samples. Paired
nasal and gastrointestinal microbiota structures of
individuals (n 5 56) showed no significant dependence
or correlation of both microbiota, indicating that the
factors shaping both communities differ.
Covariates for the Nasal Microbiota in
PD and HCs
To find factors with a strong influence on the pro-
karyotic community structures, we analyzed grouping
power by a set of technical factors, such as sampling
dates, extraction, and sequencing batches, as well as
70 anthropometric and clinical data points recorded
for the DeNoPa cohort (see Supplementary Tables).
For the sparse nasal microbiome data set, OTUs were
aggregated at the family level. Sex and the related
body height (unadjusted P values 5 0.001 and 0.0012,
respectively) of the study participants (n 5 147) were
found to have the strongest effects (Fig. 1E).
When correcting for sex, eight differentially abun-
dant families were found between PD patients and
HCs, mostly with weak significance (P values > 0.01;
Supplementary Information). To evaluate a possible
influence of medication, comparisons were performed
between PD patients receiving levodopa, dopamine
agonists,
catechol-O-methyl
transferase
(COMT)
inhibitor, and/or monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B)
inhibitors versus patients who were treatment-na€

ceae) showed significant differences in patients receiv-
ing
L-dopa
treatment
(FDR-adjusted
P
value 5
0.0004), indicating that its differential abundance may
be attributed to treatment with this drug rather than
the disease.
Differentially Abundant Taxa of the Gut
Microbiome in PD and Potential Confounders
In the gastrointestinal samples, the study group (PD,
HC, and iRBD) represented the best grouping factor
for
the
prokaryotic
(unadjusted
P
value 5 0.004,
explaining 5% of the variation; n 5 84; Fig. 1F), but
not the eukaryotic, community. Frequency of constipa-
tion was not found to be a significant covariate for
the prokaryotic gastrointestinal microbiome, although
constipation was more common in PD patients and
iRBD versus HCs (PD, 62%; iRBD, 75%; HCs, 24%;
Fisher’s exact test P values 5 0.0038 and 0.0002), and
few taxa with different abundances in constipated
versus nonconstipated individuals were found (data
not shown). Comorbidity of diabetes and coronary
artery disease (each in 5 subjects) were found to affect
the prokaryotic taxonomic profiles (unadjusted P val-
ues 5 0.02) and oral intake of diabetes medication was
considered as a potential confounder, because the sub-
cohorts contained unequal proportions of diabetes-
affected individuals.
Controlling for the intake of oral diabetes medica-
tion, 48 OTUs of the gastrointestinal microbiota were
found to be differentially abundant in PD patients ver-
sus HCs (FDR-adjusted P values < 0.05 and jlog2 fold
changej > 1; nHC 5 38, nPD 5 26; Fig. 2A; Supplemen-
tary Information). Although 14 prokaryotic OTUs in
the
gastrointestinal
microbiota
were
differentially
associated to at least one type of medication, the dif-
ferentially abundant OTUs between PD patients and
HCs were not affected by the medication.

 Differentially Abundant Taxa in RBD versus
HC and Comparison to PD
Differential analysis (with subjects having comorbid
diabetes as covariate, like above) identified 41 differ-
entially abundant OTUs in iRBD subjects compared to
HCs (FDR-adjusted P values < 0.05 and jlog2 fold
changej > 1; nHC 5 38, nRBD 5 20; Fig. 2B). Of these
41 OTUs, nine were also among the 48 differentially
abundant OTUs in PD patients’ gut microbiota com-
pared to HCs and changed in the same direction com-
pared to HCs (Supplementary Information). Thirty
other differentially abundant OTUs in RBD versus HC
or in PD versus HCs showed the same directions of
change in the comparisons to HCs. Therefore, more
than 75% of the differentially abundant OTUs in the
comparisons of PD or iRBD versus HCs showed
qualitatively similar changes compared to HCs. For
example, common patterns in PD and iRBD were
observed for Anaerotruncus spp., Clostridium XIVb,
several Bacteroidetes, and an unclassified bacterium
OTU_469.
Two of the OTUs that were significantly higher
abundant in PD compared to HCs (Akkermansia sp.
and Prevotella sp.) were also significantly more highly
abundant in PD patients with RBD by PSG compared
to PD patients without RBD, despite the fact that
these OTUs were not significantly differential in sub-
jects with iRBD compared to PD.
The Gut Microbiome in Relation to Motor and
Nonmotor Phenotypes of PD
The relative abundances of three of the differen-
tially abundant gastrointestinal OTUs in PD were sig-
nificantly
related
to
motor
symptoms
(by
MDS-
UPDRS part III) within the PD cohort, namely OTUs
of Anaerotruncus spp., Clostridium XIVa, and Lach-
nospiraceae (Fig. 2B). Six OTUs, including from the
genera
Anaerotruncus,
Akkermansia,
and
several
unclassified Bacteria, were significantly related to
nonmotor symptoms according to MDS-UPDRS part
I in the gut microbiota of PD patients (Fig. 2B).
More specifically, the presence of depression (as eval-
uated by the MADRS) and anxiety (by MDS-UPDRS
I.4) were significant grouping factors independently
of the study group for the prokaryotic (both unad-
justed
P
values 5 0.02),
but
not
the
eukaryotic,
microbiota and differed significantly in the PD and
iRBD patients versus HCs. OTUs that were signifi-
cantly differentially abundant and related to depres-
sion in the PD cohort included Anaerotruncus spp.
No effect of cognition (by MMSE and/or MoCa),
sleepiness (ESS), or pain (MDS-UPDRS I.9) on the

Whole Metagenome Sequencing of Selected
Samples to Describe Novel Genomes of
Differentially Abundant Taxa
Because we observed 10 OTUs without taxonomic
classification with significantly different abundances in
the patient cohorts versus HCs, we aimed to charac-
terize their genomes and their functional potential.
Only three of these differentially abundant OTUs were
found at relative abundances above 1% (OTU_171,
OTU_469, and OTU_332), potentially allowing recov-
ery of the genomes by whole metagenome shotgun
sequencing. Metagenomic
sequencing
data
(20 Gb)
were obtained from two samples (of an HC and an
iRBD subject) with high levels of two of these OTUs.
One
reconstructed
genome
each
was
linked
to
OTU_469 and OTU_171 using the 16S genes pre-
dicted in the metagenomic data (Fig. 3; see Supple-
mentary Information for the method). OTU_469 was
classified as an a-proteobacterium. Assessment of the
functions
encoded
in
the
genome
reconstruction
pointed to a fermentatitve lifestyle, auxotrophy for
most vitamins, and motility. Interestingly, the genome
encoded
an
endoglucanase
with
a
synuclein-like
domain. OTU_171 was found to have 98.9% identity
to a genome reconstruction of the cyanobacterium
Melainabacterium MelB1,57 and these two shared
traits such as a fermentative metabolism, flagellation,
and B vitamin synthesis. No cyanobacterial toxin
genes58-60 were found (see Supplementary Tables).
Discussion
In this study, the community structures of nasal and
gut microbiomes of 76 PD patients and 78 matched
healthy individuals were analyzed and compared with
21 subjects with iRBD, the most specific prodrome of
PD.25 Specific effort was taken to preserve the micro-
biota by flash-freezing of nasal fluid and stool, to
avoid any technical confounders.39,61 This approach
was chosen because the nasal cavity and gastrointesti-
nal tract have been suggested to constitute the two
ports of entry for a possible pathogenic agent and
from where PD-related aggregated aSyn spreads to the
CNS. So far, microbiome-based analyses in relation to
PD have focused either on the gastrointestinal tract15-
17,19 or not systematically compared both sites.15,23
OTUs common to the nasal and gastrointestinal
microbiota were found, likely attributed to nasal dis-
charge being swallowed.62 However, none of these
OTUs were found to differ significantly between PD
patients and HCs, indicating that distinct signatures of
PD are potentially present in the gut and nasal micro-
biota. The nasal microbiota displayed higher variation
over the different individuals and most OTUs were
only sparsely detected, in accord with earlier observa-
tions.23,63-65 The strongest grouping factor observed
H E I N T Z - B U S C H A R T

 for the nasal microbial community structure was sex.
Controlling for this, only few differentially abundant
bacterial families were observed in PD patients and
most of them were rare. More bacterial families were
found to be potentially affected by PD medication
than to be different in relation to PD. Therefore, our
results, in accord with other recent findings,23 indicate
that the nasal microbiome may be relatively uninfor-
mative as a source of biomarkers for PD.
In contrast to the results obtained for the nasal cav-
ity, we found significant grouping of the gastrointesti-
nal microbial community structures according to the
three study groups (PD patients, iRBD subjects, and
HCs). The same analysis revealed influences of medi-
cation of oral antidiabetics, which has previously been
observed.66 Controlling for this factor in the differen-
tial analysis, we confirmed one previous observa-
tion16,17,19,20 of differences in microbial abundances in
PD, namely the enrichment of Akkermansia sp. in
individuals
with
PD.
Enrichment
in
Akkermansia
muciniphila is known to be related to longer gastroin-
testinal passage times.67,68 However, we did not find
Akkermansia abundances to be related to self-reported
constipation. Akkermansia spp. is usually considered
to be beneficial for human physiology,69 attributed to
strengthening of gastrointestinal barrier function and
anti-inflammatory immune stimulation,70-72 but deple-
tion of the mucus layer by enriched Akkermansia sp.
has been linked to higher susceptibility to a pathogen
in an animal model.73 Butyrate-producing bacteria
have also been associated with opposing effects in PD,
including a protective role attributed to the observed
decrease in PD patients16 and a causative role attrib-
uted to the induction of microglia activation and
motor symptoms through short-chain fatty acids in a
mouse model.74 In the present study, no depletion of
butyrate producers was observed, and predictions of
the coding potential of the microbiota based on the
classified OTUs indicated no significant differences in
any butyrate-producing enzymes (see Supplementary
Information).
These
differences
to
earlier
stud-
ies16,17,19 indicate the necessity of further studies with
direct measurements of short-chain fatty acid levels in
stool17 or in situ as well as in larger cohorts. Such
studies would also enable the identification of micro-
biota associated with nonmotor phenotypes.75 Our
results, in line with observations in human cohorts76,77
and
animal
models,78,79
point
to
a
relationship
between the microbiome and depression, indepen-
dently of antidepressive medication.
An overlap of differential taxa was observed in
iRBD and PD compared to HCs. However, the gastro-
intestinal microbial signatures of RBD were distinct
from those in PD, showing, among others, a decrease
in Prevotellaceae, similar to observations in a recent
study with newly diagnosed PD patients.20 Longitudi-
nal observations of RBD patients who are likely to
progress to an aSyn aggregation disorder will be
important to characterize the changes afflicted before
and close to the onset of motor disease and to validate
the predictive potential of these changes for the risk of
developing PD.

 Several recent studies have relied on predictions of
functional
consequences
from
microbial
abundan-
ces,16,19 but elucidation of the actual coding potential
of
the
microbial
communities20
is
indispensable,
because the predictions do not account for microbes
without sequenced genomes, which make up approxi-
mately 40% of the gut microbiome.80 One of the
novel OTUs (OTU_171) that we observed to be
depleted in PD patients was from the family of Melai-
nabacteria57 of the phylum Cyanobacteria. Free-living
cyanobacteria are known to produce a range of neuro-
toxins, such as Anatoxin and Saxitoxin and the neuro-
toxin b-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA),81 which
has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases.82-84
Although the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of
BMAA are not yet known,85 no known enzymes for
the production of neurotoxins are encoded in the pre-
sented
genome
reconstruction.
This
observation,
together with the depletion in individuals with PD,
argues against a role of the OTU as a producer of neu-
rotoxins. This particular strain may, in fact, have a
protective
role,
potentially
outcompeting
related
toxin-producing strains from the same species as
widely
observed
for
enteric
pathogens.86
Another
noteworthy group of proteins are those with similarity
to aSyn, of which we found a gene in the metage-
nomic
reconstruction
of
the
so
far
undescribed
OTU_469 that was depleted in PD and iRBD patients
and may therefore also exert a protective effect.
In summary, our analysis revealed and confirmed
differential abundances of gut, but not nasal, micro-
bial taxa in PD patients and also revealed overlaps
between PD and iRBD microbiota. We point out that
standardized
sample
collection
and
preservation,
whole metagenomic analyses in combination with
functional omics, and metabolite detection are neces-
sary to pinpoint microbial functions that may interact
with the human body during the development of PD
and to derive concrete hypotheses about how the
microbiome may be involved in the different dimen-
sions of this heterogeneous disease.
