The Validation of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Genotyping Tests (VALGENT) studies offer an opportunity to clinically vali-
date HPV assays for use in primary screening for cervical cancer and also provide a framework for the comparison of analytical
and type-specific performance. Through VALGENT, we assessed the performance of the cartridge-based Xpert HPV assay (Xpert
HPV), which detects 14 high-risk (HR) types and resolves HPV16 and HPV18/45. Samples from women attending the United
Kingdom cervical screening program enriched with cytologically abnormal samples were collated. All had been previously tested
by a clinically validated standard comparator test (SCT), the GP5�/6� enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The clinical sensitivity and
specificity of the Xpert HPV for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN2�) and CIN3� relative
to those of the SCT were assessed as were the inter- and intralaboratory reproducibilities according to international criteria for
test validation. Type concordance for HPV16 and HPV18/45 between the Xpert HPV and the SCT was also analyzed. The Xpert
HPV detected 94% of CIN2� and 98% of CIN3� lesions among all screened women and 90% of CIN2� and 96% of CIN3� le-
sions in women 30 years and older. The specificity for CIN1 or less (<CIN1) was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80 to 85%)
in all women and 88% (95% CI, 86 to 91%) in women 30 years and older. Inter- and intralaboratory agreements for the Xpert
HPV were 98% and 97%, respectively. The kappa agreements for HPV16 and HPV18/45 between the clinically validated refer-
ence test (GP5�/6� LMNX) and the Xpert HPV were 0.92 and 0.91, respectively. The clinical performance and reproducibility of
the Xpert HPV are comparable to those of well-established HPV assays and fulfill the criteria for use in primary cervical cancer
screening.
M
olecular human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is being used
increasingly for cervical cancer screening and for the man-
agement of women with minor cytological abnormalities, given
the sensitivity and objectivity of this approach (1–3). As a conse-
quence, the community is faced with an expanding portfolio of
HPV tests which vary with respect to target, type range, chemistry,
and level of automation, and many of these tests are not associated
with published, peer-reviewed evidence of performance (4). If
HPV tests are to be used for the secondary prevention of cervical
cancer, it is essential that they be clinically validated, and this is
particularly relevant, given that HPV infection often clears with-
out any associated morbidity.
International criteria have been established to evaluate the
appropriateness of a new high-risk (HR) HPV DNA assay based
on noninferior sensitivity and specificity compared to those of
a clinically validated comparator assay and on high reproduc-
ibility (5). While they are not entirely perfect, they at least
represent a consistent standard/benchmark via which perfor-
mance can be assessed. One issue with validating an assay ac-
cording to these criteria is that capturing representative sam-
ples which allow verification of noninferior accuracy can be
logistically challenging.
The Validation of HPV Genotyping Tests (VALGENT) frame-
work is an international collaboration designed to facilitate the
clinical validation and comparison of HPV assays that offer geno-
typing capability (6). One of VALGENT’s objectives is to allow the
assessment of HPV assays according to the aforementioned clini-
cal accuracy criteria, through the use of continuous samples from
women participating in screening enriched with samples associ-
ated with cytopathological abnormalities.
The Xpert HPV assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is a PCR
amplification assay which detects 14 HR HPV types, offers limited
genotyping (of HPV16 and HPV18/45 as a duplex), and can pro-
vide a result in around 1 h from sample addition. It differs from
many competitor HPV assays in that the extraction and amplifi-

 cation processes are contained within an individual cartridge with
minimal operator input other than addition of 1 ml of (unma-
nipulated) original sample (7). The initial reports on performance
have been favorable when it is compared to FDA-approved assays
in both primary screening contexts and colposcopy settings (7, 8).
However, further data on performance pertaining to the Meijer
criteria are lacking as are data on the performance/concordance of
the type-specific aspects of the assay. The purpose of the present
analysis was to address these gaps.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collection. Samples used for the present analysis constitute the
VALGENT-2 panel. A detailed description of this panel has been pub-
lished previously (9, 10). In brief, archived samples were collated at the
cytopathology laboratory at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in Scot-
land, which is one of eight National Health Service (NHS) laboratories
that serve the Scottish Cervical Screening program and processes around
70,000 samples per year. All samples were collected in PreservCyt liquid
(Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA) from August 2012 to October 2012. The
panel contained 1,000 consecutive samples from the routinely screened
population (the Scottish screening set) and 300 cytologically abnormal
samples (the Scottish enrichment set). With respect to age, as Scotland
initiates screening at age 20, 419 samples were from women aged �30
years, and 881 were from women aged 30 or older.
Ethical approval. A favorable ethical opinion for the project was pro-
vided by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee 4, reference
11/WS/0038.
Annotation of samples. (i) HPV status. All samples had been tested
with a GP5�/6� PCR enzyme immunoassay (PCR-EIA), which was used
as the standard comparator assay for clinical performance measurement,
as per the Meijer criteria (5), and which used 0.5 ml of sample input. The
amplicon generated via the GP5�/6� PCR-EIA was also subjected to
genotyping by the LMNX genotyping kit HPV GP HR (GP5�/6� LMNX;
Labo Biomedical Products, Rijswijk, The Netherlands), which uses Lu-
minex xMAP technology for genotyping of the following HPV types: 16,
18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 26, 53, 73, and 82. The
performance of the GP5�/6� EIA and the genotyping provided by the
GP5�/6� LMNX on the VALGENT-2 panel was described in detail pre-
viously by Geraets et al. (10). Both assays were performed at DDL Diag-
nostic Laboratory, Rijswijk, The Netherlands. The GP5�/6� EIA and
GP5�/6� LMNX assays were performed between April and May 2013
and April and September 2013, respectively.
The Xpert HPV testing was performed at the Scottish HPV Reference
Laboratory in Edinburgh from April to August 2014, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the assay is CE marked and detects 14
high-risk (HR) HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66,
and 68), which are detected simultaneously via amplification of the E6 and
E7 genes in five fluorescent channels (HPV16, HPV18/45, HPV31/33/35/
52/58, HPV51/59, and HPV39/56/66/68a). The assay also incorporates a
human control gene (hydroxymethylbilane synthase [HMBS]) as a
sample and amplification validity check. A total of 1 ml of sample(s)
was added to the cartridge before placement in the Cepheid GeneXpert
system.
(ii) Underlying pathology. Cytology findings were reported accord-
ing to the British Society for Clinical Cytopathology (BSCC) reporting
guidelines, with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) nomenclature
used to classify histological outcomes (11–13). Women with abnormal
cytology results were managed according to guidelines defined by the
United Kingdom NHS Cervical Screening Programme modified for use in
Scotland (13). Colposcopically directed biopsy samples were taken as rou-
tinely indicated. Clinical management was not influenced by HPV status.
Age-specific prevalence of HR HPV according to Xpert HPV. The
prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of HR HPV as measured by
the Xpert HPV were assessed in 5-year age bands within the Scottish
screening set.
Assessment of clinical performance and comparison with a clini-
cally validated SCT. High-grade disease was classed as histologically con-
firmed CIN2 or higher (CIN2�) within 18 months of sample collection in
the screening and enrichment set combined (n � 101). No or low-grade
disease was assumed when a woman either had 2 consecutive cytologically
negative samples across two screening rounds (average of 3 years and 11
months) or had CIN1 or less (�CIN1) after having a positive cytology
screen (n � 842). The sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert HPV at the
level of CIN2� or CIN3� were assessed for the overall sample set and also
for women aged 30 and older separately. CIN3� incorporated any cancer
and also high-grade glandular intraepithelial neoplasia. The relative sen-
sitivity and specificity of the Xpert HPV were compared to those of the
standard comparator test (SCT) to determine whether these measures
were lower than 0.90 and 0.98, respectively. Noninferiority was assessed
by a one-sided statistical test for matched data (14). The null hypothesis of
inferiority of the Xpert HPV was rejected if P for noninferiority was �
0.05. The �2 test of McNemar (McN) was used to assess differences be-
tween matched proportions and PMcN of � 0.05 indicated that the sensi-
tivity (or specificity) of the Xpert HPV was not significantly different from
that of the GP5�/6� EIA.
Aggregation of VALGENT-2 data with existing United Kingdom
clinical data set. The sample size for VALGENT-2 was computed to assess
the performance of assays in the Scottish screening context where screen-
ing is initiated at age 20 years. To bolster data on the performance of the
Xpert HPV in women aged 30 years and older, VALGENT data were
combined with another United Kingdom screening-based data set de-
scribed in Cuzick et al. (7). As the Meijer 2009 criteria are based on women
aged �30 years, this aggregation (using two United Kingdom data sets)
ensured the requisite number of women/outcomes to align with said cri-
teria. The combined data set is referred to as the “United Kingdom aggre-
gated” data set. In Cuzick et al. (7), 3,408 samples obtained from the
United Kingdom Cervical Screening Programme were tested with the
Xpert HPV, the Cobas HPV test (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton,
CA, USA), and the Hybrid Capture 2 HPV test (hc2) (Qiagen Ltd., Man-
chester, United Kingdom), the latter two of which are clinically validated
HPV screening tests.
Inter- and intralaboratory reproducibility and type-specific agree-
ment. Inter- and intralaboratory reproducibilities were obtained accord-
ing to the Meijer criteria, which specify that a minimum of 500 samples
are assessed, of which 30% are positive. Intralaboratory testing took place
at the AML laboratory (Antwerp, Belgium) and interlaboratory testing
took place between AML and the laboratory of the University Hospital of
Ghent (Ghent, Belgium). A total of 510 samples collated at the AML
laboratory, which had previously been tested with an in-house multi-
plex real-time PCR (15, 16), were assessed. For the validation criteria
to be satisfied, the 95% lower confidence bound of both agreements
should be �87%, with a kappa value �0.5 (5).
Agreement between the Xpert HPV and the GP5�/6� LMNX for the
detection of HPV16 and HPV18/45 was evaluated using Cohen’s kappa
statistic. HPV18/45 was reported as a combination by the Xpert HPV;
“agreement” with the GP5�/6� LMNX was satisfied if the latter assay was
positive for HPV18 and/or for HPV45.
Figure S1 in the supplemental material provides an overview of the
discrete sample set(s) used for the analyses described above.
RESULTS
Demographic, clinical, and technical characteristics of the
VALGENT-2 panel. When the Scottish screening and enriched
populations are considered together, age ranged from 15 to 65
years, with 881 samples from women older than 30 years. The
average ages in the screening and the enrichment sets were 38
years (range, 18 to 68 years) and 31 years (range, 19 to 62 years),
respectively.
In the screening set, 10.2% of samples were cytologically ab-
normal, and 9.2% and 1% had low-grade and high-grade abnor-

 malities, respectively. In the enrichment set, samples were proac-
tively selected for abnormality and incorporated 100 samples with
borderline nuclear change, 100 with low-grade dyskaryosis, and
100 with high-grade dyskaryosis (moderate) or worse. Four sam-
ples were considered invalid with the Xpert HPV by generating a
double-negative (HPV and housekeeping control) result. Three of
4 were from the screening set, and 1 of 4 was from the enrichment
set. These samples were excluded from the prevalence and accu-
racy assessments. Of the 1,296 evaluable samples, outcomes were
available for 943 and 101 were associated with histologically con-
firmed CIN2� (55 of which were CIN3�), whereas 842 were
associated with no disease (i.e., two consecutive negative cytology
results or biopsy-proven �CIN1).
HR HPV prevalence as measured by the Xpert HPV in
women aged 20 to 60 years presenting for routine cervical
screening in Scotland. The HR HPV prevalences by the Xpert
HPV overall and in women over 30 were 18.0% and 11.1%, re-
spectively. Totals of 34 HPV16 and 29 HPV18/45 infections (3.4%
and 2.9%, respectively) were detected, and the prevalence of HR
HPV infection by 5-year age group in the screening population is
presented in Fig. 1.

stratified by disease outcomes (CIN2�, CIN3�, and �CIN1), for
the VALGENT-2 data set is presented in Table 1 for all ages and for
women 30 years or older. The Xpert HPV detected 94% (95% CI,
86 to 98%) of CIN2� lesions and 98% (95% CI, 90 to-100%) of
CIN3� lesions among all screened women and 93% (95% CI, 80
to 98%) of CIN2� lesions and 96% (95% CI, 79 to 100%) of
CIN3� lesions in women 30 years and older. The specificities for
identifying women with �CIN1 were 83% (95% CI, 80 to 85%)
and 88% (95% CI, 86 to 91%) in all women and in women 30 years
and older, respectively. Table 2 details the absolute and relative
accuracies of the Xpert HPV compared to those of the SCT for
both the VALGENT data set and the aggregated data set. In addi-
tion, cross-tabulations of the Xpert HPV versus the SCT are pro-
vided in Table 3 for the aggregated data set. The sensitivity and
specificity of the Xpert HPV were not significantly different from
those for the GP5�/6� EIA (95% CI around the relative accuracy
measures always included unity and PMcN was never significant)
(Table 2). Noninferior sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert HPV
compared to the GP5�/6� EIA were demonstrated for all out-
comes, except for women 30 years and older, where the Xpert
HPV was inferior with respect to sensitivity for CIN2� and
CIN3�. However, by aggregating the VALGENT-2 data with
those of Cuzick et al. (7), the hypothesis of inferiority was rejected
for women aged �30 years.
Type-specific agreement between the Xpert HPV and the
GP5�/6� LMNX assay. In the screening and enrichment sets
combined, 118 HPV16 infections were detected by the Xpert HPV
compared to 110 by the GP5�/6� LMNX. A total of 106 samples
were HPV16 positive for both tests, whereas 12 were HPV16 pos-
itive for the Xpert HPV only and 4 were positive for the GP5�/6�
LMNX only. The overall concordance for HPV16 was 98.8% (95%
CI, 98.0 to 99.3%) and the kappa value was 0.923 (95% CI, 0.886
to 0.960). Concordance for the presence of HPV18/45 was 99.2%
(95% CI, 98.5 to 99.6%) with a kappa value of 0.915 (95% CI,
0.865 to 0.965).
Inter- and intralaboratory agreement for HR HPV testing
with Xpert HPV. A total of 510 samples were assessed for intra-
and interlaboratory reproducibilities. The overall intralaboratory
concordance of HR HPV positivity was 96.9% (95% CI, 95.0 to
98.2%) with a kappa value of 0.925 (95% CI, 0.888 to 0.961),
whereas the interlaboratory concordance between the initial test-
ing in Antwerp and retesting in Ghent was 97.8% (95% CI, 96.2 to
98.9%) with a kappa value of 0.948 (95% CI, 0.917 to 0.978).
DISCUSSION
The Xpert HPV is a cartridge-based test which detects 14 HR
HPV types and offers concurrent limited typing capability. It is

 a rapid, technically undemanding assay and integrates extrac-
tion and detection within an individual cartridge. Different
levels of instrument throughput are available for the assay,
from single-module systems to 80-module systems, enabling
applications within point-of-care settings to high-throughput
centralized service laboratories.
As the Xpert HPV is a relatively new assay, there are, under-
standably, fewer data on clinical performance than for more es-
tablished tests. This said, the data available thus far have been
encouraging. Einstein et al. (8) assessed the clinical performance
of the Xpert HPV on 697 samples obtained from colposcopy re-
ferral populations across 7 U.S. sites, with performance compared
to the Cobas HPV test and the hc2. The Xpert HPV showed sen-
sitivity for CIN2� comparable to the COBAS HPV test and the
hc2, whereas the highest specificity was conferred by the hc2 fol-
lowed by the Xpert HPV and then the Cobas HPV test, leading the
authors to conclude that the Xpert HPV performance was “com-
parable to that of currently available clinically validated tests.”
A further analysis of this colposcopy study was performed by
Castle et al. (17). Here, the authors assessed assay agreement
across two samples and demonstrated high agreement of 95%.
This observation of high agreement reconciles with the results of
the present study where inter- and intralaboratory agreements
were also high.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the perfor-
mance of the Xpert HPV using the Meijer criteria, and, accord-
ingly, the Xpert HPV fulfills the criteria with respect to sensitivity
and specificity relative to a clinically validated standard compara-
tor test and also inter- and intralaboratory reproducibilities. This
assessment builds on the previous work of Cuzick et al. (7), where
a total of 3,408 prospective samples derived from women present-
ing for routine cervical screening within the United Kingdom pro-
gram and collated across 3 sites were tested with the Xpert HPV,
hc2, and Cobas HPV tests. The respective sensitivities of the assays
for CIN2 � were 98.7%, 97.5%, and 98.7% with specificities of
82.3%, 82.7%, and 82.3%. Indeed, aggregation of these data with
those from the VALGENT-2 series allowed more precise assess-
ment of the performance of the Xpert HPV in women older than
30, an important consideration given that many HPV-based pri-
mary screening protocols stipulate 30 as a minimum age for ap-
plication. Consistent with previous work (9), the data also dem-
onstrate the high prevalence of HR HPV in the United Kingdom,
particularly in young women, emphasizing the need for appropri-
ate triage strategies in an era of HPV primary screening (18).
Like many other HPV assays, the Xpert HPV offers limited
typing capability (HPV16 and HPV18/45). Type-specific agree-

 GP5�/6� LMNX was high, although because the Xpert HPV
does not delineate between 18 and 45 separately, the concordance
between it and the LMNX, which does provide individual resolu-
tion, is somewhat artificial. Further outputs from the VALGENT
studies will include further comparisons for all assays used within
the projects so that type-specific discordances and their relevance
can be examined more comprehensively.
There are caveats to the analysis. As the time frame of testing
for the GP5�/6� EIA, LMNX, and Xpert HPV were not exactly
matched, it is feasible that this may have influenced the results.
Furthermore, storage of VALGENT-2 samples prior to testing
may affect assay performance to an extent. However, if storage
were to have a deleterious impact on assay detection, lower sensi-
tivity may be anticipated, whereas the sensitivity of the Xpert HPV
for CIN2� and CIN3� was high and equivalent to or higher than
that described in the prospective series (7, 8). In addition, as bi-
opsies were only indicated as a consequence of preceding abnor-
mal cytology, some CIN2� may have been missed, although fur-
ther longitudinal follow-up of the cohort, which is planned, will
address this.
To conclude, the clinical performance and reproducibility of
the Xpert HPV are comparable to those of standard comparator
tests (the hc2 and the GP5�/6� EIA), which demonstrated better
protection against cervical cancer than cytology results alone (5).
Therefore, the Xpert HPV may be added to the list of HPV assays
considered validated for primary screening for cervical cancer
(19).
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
M.A. was supported by the seventh framework program of DG Re-
search of the European Commission, through the COHEAHR Net-
work (grant 603019) and by the Joint Action CANCON, which has
received funding from the European Union in the framework of the
Health Programme (2008 to 2013). This work made use of the Scottish
HPV Archive, a resource for research (www.shine.mvm.ed.ac.uk
/archive.shtml) set up through a program grant from the Chief Scien-
tist Office of the Scottish Government (CZB/4/658).
We are grateful to colleagues in the cytology department and the Scot-
tish HPV Reference Laboratory at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, in-
cluding Nicola Paton and Daniel Guerendiain, for support with data col-
lation and testing. Thanks are also due to NRS Lothian Bioresource
(formerly SAHSC Bioresource) for support with sample capture and gov-
ernance.
Although industrial funding was used for this evaluation, it was
investigator-led and the analysis was performed independently. K.C.
has received project funding and/or consumables to carry out assay
evaluations from HOLOGIC, Qiagen, Roche, NorChip, Cepheid,
GeneFirst, GSK, and Abbott in the past. J.C. has received research
funding (to the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine) from Qia-
gen, BD, Abbott, Hologic, Trovagene, OncoHealth, Genera, and
Cepheid and has been on speakers’ bureaus/advisory boards for BD,
Abbott, Hologic, Trovagene, and Cepheid. The Scientific Institute of
Public Health, where M.A. is employed, received support from Ceph-
eid for methodological and statistical work as foreseen in the VAL-
GENT Network (6). E.P. provides sporadic scientific advice for Roche
and Fujirebio. D.V.B. has received travel grants from Cepheid and
Hologic. The other authors declare no conflicts of interest.
Author contributions were as follows: K.C. was the local (NHS Loth-
ian) principal investigator for the study and created the manuscript drafts.
D.G. and W.Q. were responsible for delivery and analysis of the sample
panel with the standard comparator test. J.C. and L.C. contributed data
and analytical support with respect to the project outlined in Cuzick et al.
(7). C.M. organized and delivered laboratory testing using the Xpert assay.
D.V.B. and E.P. performed the intra- and interlaboratory testing. M.A. is
the chief investigator of the VALGENT projects and performed the statis-
tical analysis. All authors provided critical comment to manuscript drafts.
FUNDING INFORMATION
Project funding for the work was received from Cepheid; analysis was
performed independently. VALGENT is an independent research collab-
oration set up to compare HPV tests where manufacturers can participate.
