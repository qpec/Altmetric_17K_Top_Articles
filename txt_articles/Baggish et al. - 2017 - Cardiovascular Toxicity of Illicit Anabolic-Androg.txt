BACKGROUND: Millions of individuals have used illicit anabolic-androgenic 
steroids (AAS), but the long-term cardiovascular associations of these 
drugs remain incompletely understood.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional cohort design, we recruited 140 
experienced male weightlifters 34 to 54 years of age, comprising 86 men 
reporting ≥2 years of cumulative lifetime AAS use and 54 nonusing men. 
Using transthoracic echocardiography and coronary computed tomography 
angiography, we assessed 3 primary outcome measures: left ventricular 
(LV) systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction), LV diastolic function 
(early relaxation velocity), and coronary atherosclerosis (coronary artery 
plaque volume).
RESULTS: Compared with nonusers, AAS users demonstrated relatively 
reduced LV systolic function (mean±SD left ventricular ejection fraction = 
52±11% versus 63±8%; P<0.001) and diastolic function (early relaxation 
velocity = 9.3±2.4 cm/second versus 11.1±2.0 cm/second; P<0.001). 
Users currently taking AAS at the time of evaluation (N=58) showed 
significantly reduced LV systolic (left ventricular ejection fraction = 49±10% 
versus 58±10%; P<0.001) and diastolic function (early relaxation velocity 
= 8.9±2.4 cm/second versus 10.1±2.4 cm/second; P=0.035) compared 
with users currently off-drug (N=28). In addition, AAS users demonstrated 
higher coronary artery plaque volume than nonusers (median [interquartile 
range] 3 [0, 174] mL3 versus 0 [0, 69] mL3; P=0.012). Lifetime AAS dose 
was strongly associated with coronary atherosclerotic burden (increase 
[95% confidence interval] in rank of plaque volume for each 10-year 
increase in cumulative duration of AAS use: 0.60 SD units [0.16–1.03 SD 
units]; P=0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term AAS use appears to be associated with 
myocardial dysfunction and accelerated coronary atherosclerosis. 
These forms of AAS-associated adverse cardiovascular phenotypes may 
represent a previously underrecognized public-health problem.

A
n estimated 2.9 to 4.0 million Americans have 
used supraphysiologic doses of illicit anabolic-
androgenic steroids (AAS), including testosterone 
and its synthetic relatives, to gain muscle mass for ath-
letics or personal appearance.1 About 1 million of these 
individuals, almost all of whom are male, have developed 
AAS dependence, often leading to years of chronic AAS 
exposure.2 Illicit AAS use did not become widespread in 
the general US population until the 1980s.3 Thus, the old-
est AAS users, who initiated AAS as youths in the 1980s, 
are only now reaching middle age, when the adverse ef-
fects of long-term use may become apparent. Therefore, 
these effects remain incompletely understood.
Previous studies have suggested an association be-
tween AAS use and cardiovascular disease, with a patho-
physiologic link first proposed by early case reports of 
sudden cardiac death or ischemic stroke among young 
AAS-using men.4–6 Subsequently, preclinical studies have 
shown that AAS exposure at supraphysiologic doses 
causes dyslipidemia,7–9 stimulates cardiomyocyte hy-
pertrophy,10,11 impairs coronary arterial function,12,13 re-
duces cardiac β-adrenoreceptor sensitivity,14 potentiates 
oxidative cardiac stress,15 lowers arrhythmic thresh-
olds,16 and induces myocyte apoptosis.17 Most recently, 
investigations utilizing noninvasive cardiac imaging in 
human users have demonstrated preliminary evidence 
of AAS cardiotoxicity in the forms of myocardial dysfunc-
tion,18–22 myocardial fibrosis,23 and increased coronary 
artery calcification.24
In aggregate, data from these earlier studies suggest 
that illicit AAS use may cause a form of cardiomyopathy 
characterized by decreased left ventricular (LV) func-
tion18,19,21–23,25,26 and may increase the risk of atheroscle-
rotic disease.1,7,8,24 To date, definitive associations be-
tween AAS exposure and either myocardial or coronary 
artery disease have yet to be demonstrated in a large 
human study. To address this issue, we conducted com-
prehensive cardiovascular evaluations of 86 long-term 
AAS users and 54 nonusers.
METHODS
Study Design
We conducted an observational study using a cross-sectional 
cohort design. We have previously presented the formal prop-
erties of this design,27 which has been used both explicitly28–31 
and implicitly32,33 in many earlier studies. This method identifies 
a dynamic cohort of individuals drawn from a given source pop-
ulation who in principle could have been enumerated in the past 
and followed to the present (termed the conceptual cohort). 
Instead of sampling from the conceptual cohort, one samples 
in the present from those currently available (the study cohort). 
With this design, estimates of effects derived from the study 
cohort are valid with respect to the conceptual cohort, sub-
ject to similar conditions for validity as other retrospective 
designs (eg, retrospective cohort and case-control studies).27 
We chose the cross-sectional cohort design because it can effi-
ciently assess the association of outcomes with an uncommon 
exposure (eg, AAS use) in the same manner that a case-control 
design can efficiently assess the association of exposures with 
an uncommon outcome.
For the present study, we sampled from a source popula-
tion of men who lift weights in gymnasiums and then compared 
exposed (ie, AAS-using) and nonexposed (ie, non-AAS-using) 
men from this group. We chose this source population because 
almost all long-term AAS users are male2 and lift weights regu-
larly.1,34 We did not recruit from sporting venues because most 
AAS users are not competitive athletes but simply recreational 
weightlifters.1,35,36
Although this approach minimized the effects of confound-
ing variables inherent to weightlifting, we considered that 
weightlifting or its associated lifestyle might be associated 
with specific cardiovascular characteristics. Therefore, in an 
ancillary study, we recruited a group of nonweightlifting and 
non-AAS-using men (frequency-matched in age to the weightlift-
ers but never weightlifting >30 minutes per week at any time 
since 18 years of age), drawn from a roster of potential study 
volunteers maintained by Massachusetts General Hospital, 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Millions of individuals have used anabolic-androgenic 
steroids (AAS) to gain muscle for athletic purposes 
or personal appearance.
• Preliminary findings have suggested that long-term 
AAS exposure may lead to both cardiomyopathy and 
atherosclerotic disease, but previous studies have 
been small or methodologically limited.
• Here, in the first large controlled study of its type, 
we demonstrate that long-term AAS use is associ-
ated with both systolic and diastolic myocardial dys-
function, as well as coronary atherosclerosis.
• Systolic functional deficits appear to recover after 
AAS discontinuation, whereas diastolic dysfunction 
appears less reversible.
• Atherosclerotic disease appears strongly associ-
ated with lifetime duration of AAS exposure.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Widespread illicit AAS use first appeared in the gen-
eral population in the 1980s, and thus most AAS 
users are still young or middle-aged today.
• Thus, when clinicians encounter young or middle-
age men who exhibit evidence of unexplained left 
ventricular dysfunction or premature coronary artery 
disease, the possibility of cardiotoxicity because of 
long-term AAS use should be considered in the dif-
ferential diagnosis.
• It is notable that ≈80% of contemporary AAS users 
are simply recreational weightlifters rather than 
competitive athletes, and thus the possibility of AAS 
use should be considered even in individuals who do 
not identify themselves as athletes.

and compared these nonweightlifters to the subgroup of 
non-AAS-using weightlifters from the primary study. These 2 
groups (AAS nonusers and nonweightlifting and non-AAS-using 
men) exhibited no scientifically important or statistically sig-
nificant differences on measures of cardiovascular physiology 
or pathology (Tables I–III in the online-only Data Supplement), 
indicating that weightlifting per se, of the duration and intensity 
selected by our recruitment techniques, was associated with 
little or no cardiovascular adaptation or pathology.
Participants
As described in our previous cross-sectional cohort studies 
involving AAS,28,29 we advertised in gymnasiums for men 34 
to 54 years of age who could bench-press 275 pounds for 
at least one repetition, currently or in the past to recruit AAS 
users and nonusers. On telephone screening, advertisement 
respondents were invited to participate without inquiring about 
AAS use to minimize selection bias that might arise if they knew 
in advance the exposure variable of interest. It is notable that 
AAS are typically ingested in courses or cycles, with deliber-
ate intervening off-drug intervals.1 Thus, our design anticipated 
that the AAS-using weightlifters would include 2 subgroups: 
those on-drug and those off-drug at the time of evaluation. We 
excluded AAS users reporting <2 years of cumulative lifetime 
AAS exposure. We imposed no specific exclusions for medical 
or psychiatric history.
Evaluation
Qualifying participants were evaluated at a screening interview, 
where they provided written informed consent for the study as 
approved by the McLean Hospital Institutional Review Board. We 
then obtained demographic data, lifetime exercise history (ie, 
exercise modalities, duration, intensity, and consistency), and 
fat-free mass index, a validated measure of muscularity.29,37,38 
Psychiatric and substance-use histories were obtained using the 
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‒IV.39 We next assessed 
history of AAS use, including age at onset of use, maximum 
weekly dose of AAS (calculated as mg of testosterone equiva-
lent),40 cumulative lifetime years of use, lifetime dose ingested, 
time of most recent use, and types and doses of AAS taken 
during most recent (or current) use. We also assessed use of 
other performance-enhancing substances, including over-the-
counter substances (eg, creatine) and illicit drugs (eg, human 
growth hormone, clenbuterol). Participants then provided urine 
samples to be tested for AAS29,38 and head or axillary hair to 
be tested for opiates, cannabis, phencyclidine, amphetamines, 
and cocaine.29,38 Men showing urine or hair findings inconsis-
tent with their reported substance-use history were excluded 
from further evaluation. We also excluded men denying AAS 
use but exhibiting a fat-free mass index >26 kg/m2 together 
with body fat <10% based on previous work showing that a 
combination of leanness and muscularity beyond these limits 
strongly suggests surreptitious AAS use.37,41
Men found to qualify after the screening interviews were then 
referred for a cardiovascular evaluation performed by investi-
gators blinded to AAS status to characterize LV structure, LV 
function, and coronary atherosclerosis. Two-dimensional trans-
thoracic echocardiography (iE33, Philips Medical Systems) 
was used to develop profiles of LV structure and function as 
previously detailed by our group.42 The primary outcome vari-
ables for LV systolic and diastolic function were left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) as measured using the modified biplane 
method of disks43 and early LV relaxation velocity (E´; aver-
age of basal septum and lateral wall values44), respectively. 
Second, coronary computerized tomography angiography 
(CTA) was performed using a dual-source 128-slice CT scanner 
(Definition Flash, Siemens Medical Systems), with a primary 
outcome variable of total coronary artery plaque volume.45 
Secondary CTA measures included number of atherosclerotic 
coronary segments, degree of stenosis of the worst segment, 
and Agatston calcium score.46 Detailed echocardiographic and 
CTA methods are provided in the online-only Data Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Based on our pilot data18 and those of others,1,24 our primary 
hypotheses were that AAS users would exhibit: (1) decreased 
LVEF, (2) decreased E´, and (3) increased coronary plaque 
volume compared with non-AAS-using weightlifters. We further 
hypothesized that within the AAS-user group, greater pathology 
on these variables would be associated with currency of AAS 
use (ie, on-drug versus off-drug status at the time of evaluation) 
and with cumulative lifetime duration of AAS exposure.
Using linear regression, we estimated the mean differ-
ence between groups on the outcome measures (technically, 
the estimated mean difference was the estimated beta coef-
ficient corresponding to group status in a linear model that also 
included a set of covariates and was fitted using ordinary least-
squares linear regression). To control for confounding, our 
primary analysis adjusted for a set of plausible confounding 
variables including: age; race/ethnicity (modeled as black ver-
sus all others); history of tobacco use, cocaine dependence, 
and alcohol dependence; weekly hours of aerobic activity in 
the last 10 years (modeled in tertiles of the distribution); and 
reported family history of coronary artery disease as defined 
by the presence of angina, myocardial infarction, angioplasty/
stent, or coronary bypass surgery in a first-degree relative. 
For echocardiographic measures, we additionally adjusted for 
body surface area as calculated by the Mosteller formula. To 
explore the relationship between LV mass, a potentially impor-
tant mechanistic mediator of LV functional impairment, and 
our primary functional outcome variables, we performed post 
hoc analyses examining the association of LV mass index with 
LVEF and E´ among AAS users and nonusers. Specifically, we 
used linear regression with the same set of potential confound-
ing variables and the addition of a term for AAS-user versus 
nonuser group status to examine the relationships between 
LV mass index (LV mass in g/body surface area in m2) and 
the primary cardiac function outcomes. Also, because resting 
heart rate could influence cardiac functional outcomes, we per-
formed additional analyses of the primary cardiac functional 
outcomes by adding resting heart rate as a covariate. Note 
that heart rate may influence functional outcomes and also 
might be affected by current AAS use. In the latter eventuality, 
the estimated mean difference between groups adjusted for 
resting heart rate would likely be biased toward the null (ie, 
would potentially represent an overadjustment), thus producing 
an underestimate of the effect of AAS use.
In subsequent sensitivity analyses assessing the influence 
of adjustments using alternative sets of potential confounders,

we repeated all comparisons (1) with no adjustment for any 
covariates, (2) with the adjustment covariates reduced to only 
age and race (plus body surface area for echocardiographic 
measures), and (3) with the adjustment covariates augmented 
to include hypertension and dyslipidemia (as defined in Tables 
X‒X in the online-only Data Supplement). It is important to note 
that the augmented set of covariates would be expected to 
yield underestimates of the effect of AAS use because hyper-
tension and dyslipidemia are often effects of AAS use,1,7,9,47 
and adjustment for these variables would consequently adjust 
out effects of AAS mediated by these variables.
Because the distributions of coronary CTA measures con-
tained many zero values (ie, no measurable coronary artery 
disease), we used ranked data for these analyses. Within the 
AAS-user group, we evaluated the association of all outcome 
measures with duration of use and currency of use (ie, on-drug 
versus off-drug) using linear regression with adjustment for the 
same set of covariates. To aid in interpretation of comparisons 
between groups and associations within groups involving rank-
transformed data, we used standard deviation (SD) units to 
express the estimated difference in ranks for binary predictor 
variables and the estimated change in ranks for each 1-unit 
increase in continuous predictor variables. The SD units were 
calculated by dividing the estimated beta coefficient for the 
predictor variable from the linear regression model by the SD 
of the ranks for the entire sample used for a given model.
All models were fitted using Stata 14.1 software (StataCorp). 
We set α=0.05, 2-tailed. We did not perform corrections for 
multiple comparisons, so that the statistical significance of 
P-values for secondary outcomes, particularly those between 
0.01 and 0.05, should be interpreted with caution.
RESULTS
Participants
Sample
We screened 165 men, of whom 25 were excluded from 
medical evaluation as follows: 10 qualified for participa-
tion but withdrew before medical evaluation (9 AAS us-
ers, 1 nonuser), 12 reported AAS use of <2 years dura-
tion, and 3 showed findings on drug testing or fat-free 
mass index inconsistent with their self-reports. The re-
maining sample comprised 86 AAS users and 54 nonus-
ers. Among the AAS users, 58 (67%) were on-drug and 
28 (33%) off-drug at evaluation. The off-drug users had 
last used AAS a median (interquartile range) of 15 (5, 
70) months before evaluation.
Characteristics
AAS users and nonusers were similar on most charac-
teristics (Table 1), but users showed higher body mass 
index and fat-free mass index, consistent with known ef-
fects of AAS.
Cardiometabolic Features
Compared with nonusers, AAS users displayed higher 
blood pressure (mean±SD systolic, 118±11 versus 
115±10 mm 
Hg; diastolic, 76±9 versus 72±9 mm 
Hg) 
and a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia (N [%] with low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol >160 mg/dL: 20 [23%] 
versus 7 [13%]).
Cardiac Structure and Function
For the primary outcome variables of LVEF and E´, AAS 
users showed significant deficits compared with nonus-
ers (Table 2). In models further adjusted for resting heart 
rate, the estimated mean differences between groups 
were reduced by 15%, and this change had no impact 
on the statistical significance of these findings (P<0.001 
for both). On other measures, AAS users exhibited higher 
LV mass index, thicker LV walls, and more concentric LV 
geometry than nonusers. On subsequent analyses exam-
ining the association of outcomes with duration and cur-
rency of AAS use, currency of use was strongly associ-
ated with greater pathology (Figure 1 and Table IV in the 
online-only Data Supplement). Specifically, 41 (71%) of 
the 58 on-drug users showed LVEFs falling below the nor-
mal threshold of 52%,43 whereas off-drug users showed 
largely normal LVEFs. Twenty-nine (50%) on-drug users 
fell below the normal E´ threshold of 8.5 cm/second,44 
with off-drug users showing only partially normalized E´. 
Similar associations with currency of AAS use were found 
across other echocardiographic measures (Table IV in 
the online-only Data Supplement). In contrast, we found 
no significant associations between duration of AAS use 
and the primary outcome variables (for each additional 
10 years of AAS exposure, the estimated mean change 
[95% confidence interval] in LVEF was ‒3.3% [‒8.3 to 
1.6], P=0.19; and the estimated mean change in E´ was 
0.1 cm/second [‒1.0 to 1.2 cm/second], P=0.90).
Because LVEF and E´ differed by group (ie, AAS user 
versus nonuser) and by subgroup based on currency 
of use (ie, current versus past AAS users), we further 
tested for interactions of group and subgroup status 
with LV mass index for each of these associations and 
found evidence for a significant interaction with AAS 
user group status (P=0.046 and P=0.016 for LVEF and 
E´, respectively) but not for currency of use among AAS 
users (P=0.21 and P=0.86, respectively). Therefore, 
we assessed the associations separately for AAS us-
ers and nonusers. Examining LVEF, among AAS users, 
a significant association occurred between increased 
LV mass index and decreased LVEF (estimated mean 
change [95% confidence interval] in LVEF for each 10 
g increase in LV mass index ‒1.6% [‒2.4 to ‒0.8], 
P<0.001). In contrast, among the nonusers, no signifi-
cant association occurred between LV mass index and 
LVEF (estimated mean change in LVEF for each 10 g in-
crease in LV mass index –0.2% [–1.5 to 1.2], P=0.80). 
Examining E´, among AAS users, a significant associa-
tion occurred between increased LV mass index and 
reduced E´ (estimated mean change in E´ for each 10 
g increase in LV mass index ‒0.31 cm/second [‒0.49 
to ‒0.13 cm/second], P<0.001). Among nonusers, the

relationship was of approximately equal magnitude but 
in the opposite direction, with a significant association 
between increased LV mass index and increased E´ (es-
timated mean change in E´ for each 10 g increase in LV 
mass index 0.36 cm/second [0.04–0.68 cm/second], 
P<0.001).
Coronary Artery Atherosclerosis
AAS users showed significantly higher coronary plaque 
volume than nonusers (Table 3 and Figure 2). On exam-
ining the association of CTA measures with currency 
and duration of AAS use, we found strong associations 
between lifetime duration of use on all angiographic 
measures of coronary pathology (Table 4 and Figure 3). 
However, we found no significant association between 
currency of use and plaque volume (estimated mean dif-
ference between on-drug and off-drug users in ranks: 
‒0.07 SD units [‒0.56 to 0.41], P=0.76). It is notable 
that 3 (3%) AAS users had experienced earlier myocar-
dial infarctions because of underlying atherosclerotic 
disease, documented by cardiac catheterization, occur-
ring at 38 years of age (ST-segment myocardial infarc-
tion with complete occlusion of left anterior descending 
artery), 43 years of age (non-ST-segment myocardial 
infarction with 99% occlusion of both the right coronary 
and left circumflex coronary arteries), and 46 years of 
age (ST-elevation myocardial infarction with complete oc-
clusion of a second obtuse marginal artery) and after 
17, 11, and 5 years of cumulative lifetime AAS expo-
sure, respectively. In addition, 1 AAS user had presented 
at 42 years of age after 20 years of cumulative lifetime 
AAS exposure with congestive heart failure and under-
went stenting of the left circumflex and first obtuse mar-
ginal arteries. None of the 54 nonusers had a history of 
myocardial infarction or stenting.

Sensitivity Analyses
Assessing the influence of alternative sets of potential 
confounders, using models with both reduced and aug-
mented sets of covariates, we obtained results similar to 
those of the primary analysis, with <15% change in the 
estimates for the primary outcomes and preservation of 
statistical significance for all results identified as such in 
the primary analysis (Tables V–VII in the online-only Data 
Supplement). We also reanalyzed the echocardiographic 
findings while omitting the 3 men with previous myocardial 
infarctions. This analysis produced negligible changes in 
the findings, with the estimated mean differences between 
users and nonusers on the 2 primary outcome variables 
changing by <2% when these 3 men were excluded.
DISCUSSION
Illicit AAS use is widespread, but its long-term adverse 
effects remain poorly understood. A growing literature, 
largely comprised of case reports and small observa-

as subgroups of individuals who were on-drug (N=58) and off-drug (N=28) at the time of evaluation (Middle); and nonusers (N=54) 
(Right). On this variable, the estimated mean difference (95% confidence interval) between on-drug and off-drug AAS users, adjusted 
for covariates as described in the text, is ‒9.5% (‒13.8 to ‒5.2), P<0.001; for on-drug AAS users versus nonusers, the difference is 
‒13.6% (‒17.3 to ‒9.8), P<0.001; and for off-drug AAS users versus nonusers, the difference is ‒4.1% (‒8.6 to 0.3), P=0.072. B,

tional studies, suggests that AAS use may cause cardio-
vascular disease. We undertook the present study to ex-
amine cardiovascular health measures among long-term 
AAS users and otherwise similar nonusers with the follow-
ing 4 key findings. First, AAS users demonstrated sub-
stantial impairment of LV systolic function as assessed 
by LVEF and longitudinal strain. This finding was driven 
almost entirely by those AAS users who were on-drug 
at the time of evaluation, suggesting that LV dysfunction 
may be a dynamically related to AAS-use patterns. Sec-
ond, AAS users also showed impaired LV diastolic dys-
function, both relative to nonusers and also as defined 
by current diagnostic criteria.44 In contrast to systolic 
function, which appeared largely normal among off-drug 
AAS users, LV diastolic function was impaired in both on-
drug and off-drug users, suggesting a more permanent 
form of acquired pathology. Third, AAS users had sig-
nificantly more LV hypertrophy, as reflected by LV mass 
index, than nonusers, suggesting an anabolic effect on 
cardiac muscle mass. In addition, the magnitude of LV 
hypertrophy among AAS users was directly related to 
the degrees of both systolic and diastolic function, sug-
gesting a mechanistic link between LV hypertrophy and 
functional deterioration. Fourth, AAS use was associated 
with increased coronary atherosclerosis, and the severity 
of atherosclerotic disease was strongly associated with 
cumulative lifetime duration of AAS use. In aggregate, our 
findings suggest that long-term AAS use is associated 
with adverse cardiovascular phenotypes characterized 
by both myocardial pathology and coronary artery pa-
thology, which may represent a clinically substantial and 
largely unrecognized public health problem.
Several scientific and clinical implications emerge 
from this study. First, improved identification of the ad-
verse cardiovascular associations of AAS use may deter 
potential future users. Second, clinicians may be better 
informed about the potential adverse cardiovascular ef-
fects of AAS. It is important to note that participants 
in the present study were not elite or professional ath-
letes, the small subset of the general population most 
commonly tied to AAS exposure, but rather a sample 
of middle-age men representing a reasonably broad so-
cioeconomic and racial/ethnic distribution. Thus, when 
comparable men are found to have impaired LV function 
or premature coronary artery disease, it seems prudent 
for clinicians to now include AAS use on the differential 
diagnosis of possible causes. Third, data derived from 
the present cross-sectional study provide a foundation 
for critical future work. The hypothesis that some car-
diovascular phenotypes associated with AAS use may 
wax and wane with drug exposure (eg, LV systolic dys-
function) while others may be more permanent, perhaps 
irreversible (eg, LV diastolic dysfunction and coronary 
atherosclerosis), deserves rigorous assessment. Longi-
tudinal studies of illicit AAS users with hard clinical end 
points, and with interventions to impact drug exposure 
patterns and treat detected disease, are also of impor-
tance.
Limitations
Several threats regarding the internal validity of this 
study, as previously delineated in general for cross-
sectional cohort studies,27,29 deserve consideration. 
First, bias might arise through exiting from the under-

‡Four AAS users had received percutaneous coronary interventions, 
and thus their plaque volume and calcium score could not be quantified 
accurately. However, all 4 men showed extensive plaque as evidenced by 
their number of diseased segments and degree of stenosis for most severe 
stenosis. Therefore, for purposes of calculation, they were assigned the 
median values for plaque volume and calcium score, respectively, from 
among all study participants with nonzero plaque volume and calcium 
scores. If these cases were omitted entirely, then the estimated mean 
difference (95% confidence interval) between groups in standardized rank 
would be 0.43 (0.04‒0.81) for plaque volume and 0.13 (‒0.26 to 0.51)

lying conceptual cohort (ie, becoming unavailable for 
study in the present) that is differential with respect 
to exposure status. For example, AAS users might be 
more likely than nonusers to develop cardiovascular 
morbidity, stop weightlifting, and hence be unavailable 
for recruitment. Any resulting bias, however, would likely 
underestimate the effects of AAS use. Second, as in all 
observational studies, we cannot exclude residual con-
founding. However, given the lack of confounding seen 
with our measured potential confounders—as evidenced 
by similar estimates in sensitivity analyses using both 
reduced and augmented sets of potential confounders—
it is unlikely that substantial residual bias remains be-
cause of unmeasured confounders. Third, because both 
AAS users and nonusers were weightlifters, the effects 
of AAS might be clouded if weightlifting contributed to 
cardiovascular pathology. However, our ancillary study 
comparing non-AAS-using weightlifters with nonweightlift-
ers demonstrated that weightlifting alone (of the duration 
and intensity exhibited by our sample) had little effect on 
cardiac adaptation or pathology. Fourth, bias could arise 
from measurement error, particularly in the exposure 
variables (eg, misclassifying surreptitious AAS users 
as nonusers or inaccurately assessing the type, dura-
tion, dose, and currency of use). In particular, AAS users 
provided retrospective accounts, often spanning many 
years of time, of the use of illicit drugs of uncertain po-
tency or authenticity. As such, estimates of participants’ 
lifetime duration of AAS use and total lifetime AAS dose 
were only approximations. The effect of these various 
sources of measurement error would be expected to be 
differential for between-group comparisons (because of 
the potential for inclusion of surreptitious AAS users in 
the nonuser group and the much less likely inclusion of

individuals falsely reporting AAS use in the user group) 
and random for within-group comparisons among AAS 
users (because of the low likelihood of an association 
between cardiac outcomes and error in the predictor 
variables). Both of these sources would likely bias re-
sults toward the null, thereby yielding an underestimate 
of the effects of AAS use.
Potential threats to external validity (generalizability) 
also require consideration. First, we recruited AAS users 
from gymnasiums. Thus, our results might not general-
ize to other AAS-using groups (eg, elite athletes). How-
ever, most AAS users are recreational weightlifters, and 
thus our results likely generalize to the population of AAS 
users of greatest public health importance. Second, de-
spite the demographic diversity of our sample, white 
non-Hispanic men were overrepresented, and therefore 
our results might not generalize to the full racial/ethnic 
spectrum of AAS users. Overall, however, these poten-
tial threats to internal and external validity appear mod-
est. Thus, our findings likely represent reasonably unbi-
ased estimates of the associations of AAS exposure with 
adverse cardiovascular phenotypes.
CONCLUSION
Our findings suggest that AAS use is associated with 
LV dysfunction and premature coronary artery disease. 
These findings may inform public health initiatives to 
curb drug exposure and provide clinicians with informa-
tion that will translate into improved patient care.
