Key Points
• Ruxolitinib treatment lessens
immunopathology and
prolongs survival in murine
models of hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis.
• In vivo exposure to ruxolitinib
limits CD81 T-cell expansion
and proinflammatory cytokine
production.
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) comprises an emerging spectrum of inherited
and noninherited disorders of the immune system characterized by the excessive
production of cytokines, including interferon-g and interleukins 2, 6, and 10 (IL-2, IL-6, and
IL-10). The Janus kinases (JAKs) transduce signals initiated following engagement of
specific receptors that bind a broad array of cytokines, including those overproduced in
HLH. Based on the central role for cytokines in the pathogenesis of HLH, we sought
to examine whether the inhibition of JAK function might lessen inflammation in murine
models of the disease. Toward this end, we examined the effects of JAK inhibition using a
model of primary (inherited) HLH in which perforin-deficient (Prf12∕2) mice are infected with
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and secondary (noninherited) HLH in which
C57BL/6 mice receive repeated injections of CpG DNA. In both models, treatment with the
JAK1/2inhibitorruxolitinibsignificantlylessenedtheclinicalandlaboratorymanifestations
of HLH, including weight loss, organomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercytokine-
mia, and tissue inflammation. Importantly, ruxolitinib treatment also significantly improved the survival of LCMV-infected Prf12∕2 mice.
Mechanistic studies revealed that in vivo exposure to ruxolitinib inhibited signal transducer and activation of transcription 1–dependent
gene expression, limited CD81 T-cell expansion, and greatly reduced proinflammatory cytokine production, without effecting degran-
ulation and cytotoxic function. Collectively, these findings highlight the JAKs as novel, druggable targets for mitigating the cytokine-
driven hyperinflammation that occurs in HLH. These observations also support the incorporation of JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib
into future clinical trials for patients with these life-threatening disorders. (Blood. 2016;127(13):1666-1675)
Introduction
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) comprises a genetically
heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a highly stimulated
but ineffective immune response.1 In HLH, activated T cells and
macrophages accumulate in organs such as the liver, spleen, bone mar-
row, and brain, where they copiously secrete cytokines and mediate
significanttissuedamage.2Thestandardapproachtotreatmentinvolves
theadministrationofbroadlyimmunosuppressiveandcytotoxicagents,
suchashigh-dosesteroidsandetoposide3,4oftenfollowedbyallogeneic
stem cell transplantation. For patients whose disease fails to respond or
relapses while on treatment, there are few effective salvage therapies
and the fatality rate can reach up to 50% or higher.4,5
“Primary” HLH occurs as a hereditary condition due to the presence
of biallelic inactivating germline mutations in 1 of several genes in-
volved in lymphocyte cytotoxic function, including PRF1, UNC13D,
STX11, and STXBP2.1 Due to these mutations, patients with primary
HLH exhibit markedly reduced or absent natural killer (NK) and CD81
T-cellcytotoxicity.Undernormalcircumstances,NKandCD81Tcells

Indeed, perturbations in these cytotoxicity-dependent functions have
been shown to underlie the recurrent bouts of hyperinflammation that
typify primary HLH. In “secondary” HLH, patients lack underlying
genetic mutations,1 yet they experience hyperinflammation in the
setting of certain infections, malignancies, or autoimmune disorders.
Recently, a cytokine releasesyndromeresembling HLH has also been
described in patients receiving T-cell–based cancer immunother-
apies, including blinatumumab8 and chimeric antigen receptor-
modified T cells.9
Many of the key cytokines contributing to inflammation in HLH,
including interferon-g (IFNg) and interleukins 2 and 6 (IL-2 and IL-6),
bind to receptors that signal via the Janus kinases (JAKs; JAK1-3,
Tyk2).10 Upon cytokine binding, 1 or more JAKs come into proximity

Based on their essential roles in transmitting cytokine-induced
signals,theJAKshavebecomeatargetforpharmacologicmanipulation
in inflammatory diseases.11-13 Accordingly, studies have shown that
JAK inhibition reduces the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid
arthritis and ulcerative colitis,14,15 as well as the myeloproliferative
disorders.16,17 Given the efficacy of JAK inhibition in these other
conditions, we hypothesized that JAK inhibition might serve as a
valid therapeutic approach in HLH. To test this hypothesis, we
examined the effects of JAK inhibition using murine models of
primary and secondary HLH. Notably, treatment with the JAK1/2
inhibitor ruxolitinib significantly reduced disease manifestations
and enhanced survival in both murine models. Ruxolitinib dimin-
ished CD81 T-cell accumulation and cytokine production, while
sparing degranulation and cytotoxicity. Collectively, these data
provide rationale for the incorporation of ruxolitinib or similar JAK
inhibitors into future clinical trials to improve the outcomes for
patients with HLH.
Methods
Mice
C57BL/6 (B6) and Prf12∕2 mice were from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar
Harbor, ME). Experiments were performed with approval of the Institutional
AnimalCareandUseCommitteesatTheChildren’sHospitalofPhiladelphiaand
St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
CpG-induced model of secondary HLH
B6 mice were injected with 50 mg of CpG DNA on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 as
described.18 Mice were treated or not with ruxolitinib (90 mg/kg; INCB018424;
Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX) twice daily by oral gavage starting on day 4.
This dose results in a peak serum level of 3 to 4 mM, which is similar to a 25-mg
oral dose in humans (R.L., unpublished observation, May 2015). Ruxolitinib
was prepared in citrate buffer (pH 3.5) with 20% (wt/vol) Captisol (Ligand
Pharmaceuticals, La Jolla, CA). Mice were euthanized and organs collected
for analysis on day 9.
LCMV-induced model of primary HLH
Prf12∕2 mice were infected with 2 3 105 plaque-forming units (PFUs) lympho-
cytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) Armstrong by intraperitoneal injection on
day 0. Starting on day 4 postinfection, mice were treated or not with ruxolitinib
(90 mg/kg) twice daily by oral gavage. Mice were euthanized and organs
collected and evaluated between days 8 and 10 postinfection.
Antibodies and other reagents
Fluorochrome-conjugated anti-mouse CD4, CD8, CD25, B220, CD69,
CD107a, IFNg, NK1.1, T-cell receptor b, and CD11c monoclonal antibodies
were from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Anti-mouse CD44, tumor necro-
sis factor a (TNFa), and IL-2 were from eBioscience (San Diego, CA).
Allophycocyanin-conjugated Db glycoprotein 33 (gp33) tetramer was from
E.J.W. (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA).
Flow cytometry
Cell suspensions from blood, liver, and spleen were stained using standard
protocols and subjected to multicolor flow cytometry using an LSR II flow

9.6.4 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
Analyses of serum cytokine levels
Enzyme-linkedimmunosorbentassaykitstodetectIL-6,IL-10,IL-12,IFNg,and
TNFa werepurchasedfromBDBiosciences(SanDiego,CA).Allkitswereused
according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
Histology
Livers were fixed in 10% formalin (wt/vol) (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ),
embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-mM sections, and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E). Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse 90i equipped with a
Nikon DS-Fi1 camera and NIS-Elements BR 3.0 software (Nikon, Japan). For
each sample, 5 random fields were captured at 320 magnification (Nikon Plan
Apo 103; NA 0.45) and subjected to computer-based quantification of inflam-
matory infiltrates using the BZ-II Analyzer Hybrid Cell Count software
(Keyence, Japan). The number of inflammatory foci (clusters containing
.8 lymphocytes) was determined, along with the area of the inflammatory
infiltrate (relative to the field of view).
In vitro restimulation assay
Splenocyteswereincubatedat37°C(5%CO2)at13107cellspermLfor5hours
with or without gp33-41 (0.4 ng/mL) or gp61-80 peptide (1 ng/mL) in com-
plete RPMI 1640 (RPMI, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin-streptomycin-
glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS]). BD GolgiStop, BD GolgiPlug,
and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD107a antibody (BD Biosciences) were
added directly to the medium. LCMV gp33-41 and gp61-80 peptides were
from AnaSpec (Fremont, CA). Cells were then washed in cold phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) with 1% FBS, and stained for intracellular IFNg,
TNFa, and IL-2 using the Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit following the manufacturer’s
protocol (BD Biosciences).
Assessment of viral titer
Vero cells were plated in 6-well dishes at 1 3105 cells per mL in modified Eagle
medium with 10% serum, 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, and
incubated overnight at 37°C. Cells were then incubated with 200 mL of a 10-fold
serial dilution of liver lysates for 1 hour at 37°C, and overlaid with a 1:1 mixture
of 1% agarose and 23 199 medium (Corning Life Sciences, Tewskbury, MA)
with 10% FBS. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 4 days. Wells were then
overlaidwith2mLofa1:1mixtureof1%agaroseand23199mediumwith1:20

to determine the PFU per gram of tissue.
Cytotoxicity assay
Splenocytes from ruxolitinib-treated or untreated B6 mice were obtained 8 days
post-LCMV infection. CD81CD441 T cells were sort-purified using a MoFlow
Astrios cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). EL4 target cells were
incubated or not with 20 mM gp33 peptide for 3 hours, and then labeled with
100 mCi 51Cr (Na2CrO4; Perkin Elmer; Waltham, MA). 51Cr-labeled targets and
effectors were washed in complete RPMI, plated in triplicate at varying effector-
to-target (E:T) ratios, and incubated for 5 hours at 37°C (5% CO2). Supernatants
were collected and radioactivity measured to determine the percent-specific lysis
as described.19
Gene expression profiling
On day 8 postinfection, splenic CD81 T cells were sorted into lysis buffer
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and RNA isolated. Complementary DNA was prepared
and hybridized to the mouse Affymetrix ST 2.0 Chip. The array data set was
modeled using a 2-way comparison of untreated vs ruxolitinib-treated mice and
uninfected vsinfected mice.Principal componentanalysis (PCA)wasperformed
on unfiltered data using Partek Genomics Suite (St. Louis, MO). Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering was performed on probe sets filtered by a log2
difference .1.5. Genome-wide significant probe sets (with a false discovery
rate ,0.05 via Benjamini-Hochberg correction) identified by comparing
LCMV-infected/untreated or LCMV-infected/ruxolitinib-treated mice were

Results
Ruxolitinib ameliorates the hematologic manifestations of
CpG-induced HLH
Following the repeated engagement of Toll-like receptor 9 by the serial
administration of CpG DNA, B6 mice experience activation of the
innateimmunesystemanddevelopmanyofthecardinalmanifestations
ofHLH,includingtrilineage cytopenias,hypercytokinemias,andtissue
inflammation.18 Because an HLH-like disease can be induced in wild-
type (WT) mice, this model of CpG-induced inflammation has been
usedtosimulatethesecondaryformsofdisease,whicharegenerallynot
associated with germ line mutations. To determine whether inhibition
of JAK signaling would attenuate disease severity, B6 mice were
administered PBS or CpG every other day for 9 days (Figure 1A).
Beginning on day 4, mice were treated or not with ruxolitinib twice
daily by oral gavage. On day 9, animals were euthanized, and organs
harvested and examined.
Compared with control PBS-treated mice, CpG-treated animals
developed marked splenomegaly as determined by gross visual inspec-
tion (Figure 1B) and measurement of the spleen-to-body weight ratio
(Figure 1C). CpG-treated animals also developed pancytopenia, in-
cluding reductions in the white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin
(Hgb), red blood cell (RBC) count, and platelet count (Plt; Figure 1D).
The reduction in WBC was primarily due to a decrease in the ab-
solute lymphocyte count. Remarkably, treatment of CpG-injected mice
with ruxolitinib at a dose previously shown to lessen disease features
and prolong survival in a murine model of JAK2-driven myeloprolif-
erative disorder20 significantly lessened these clinical and laboratory
parameters, restoring spleen size, WBC, RBC, Hgb, and Plt count to
those observed in control PBS-injected mice (Figure 1D). Of note, the
administration of ruxolitinib to control PBS-injected mice had no effect
on baseline hematologic parameters (Figure 1D).
Ruxolitinib lowers serum cytokine levels and reduces tissue
inflammation in CpG-treated mice
CpG-treated mice exhibit elevated levels of serum cytokines, including
IFNg, which is critical for disease initiation and progression.18 To
examine whether JAK inhibition reduces CpG-induced hypercytoki-
nemia, we measured serum cytokine levels in mice that had or had not
receivedtreatmentwithruxolitinib.Aspreviouslyreported,CpG-treated
mice developed increased serum IFNg, IL-6, and IL-12 (Figure 2A). In
contrast, these proinflammatory cytokines were significantly lower and
reduced to baseline levels in ruxolitinib-treated animals (Figure 2A).
Curiously, ruxolitinib treatment of CpG-injected mice did not show
lowering of every cytokine, as can be seen by the modest but not sta-
tistically significant decrease in the serum level of IL-10 (Figure 2A).
In HLH, activated immune cells infiltrate organs where they cause
considerable tissue damage. Given its positive effects on CpG-induced

From 
 cytopenia and hypercytokinemia, we next assessed whether JAK1/2
inhibition might ameliorate CpG-induced immunopathology. To do so,
we quantified the number and size of inflammatory foci (Figure 2B
arrows) in the livers of PBS- or CpG-injected mice that had or had not
received treatment with ruxolitinib. Compared with the livers of PBS-
treated mice, which had an average of 0.59 6 0.21 inflammatory foci
per HPF, the livers of CpG-treated animals exhibited 5.5-fold more
foci (3.28 6 0.43/HPF), encompassing 1.72% 6 0.05% of the total
field of view. Strikingly, this immune infiltration was abrogated by
treatment with ruxolitinib, where the number and area were reduced
to 0.16 6 0.37/HPF and 0.05% 6 0.02%, respectively. Again, admin-
istration of ruxolitinib to control PBS-injected mice had no effect on
basal cytokine levels or tissue histology.
Ruxolitinib lessens the manifestations and enhances survival in
LCMV-induced HLH
The primary form of HLH has been modeled using perforin-deficient
(Prf12/2) mice, which, like human perforin-deficient patients, exhibit
pronounced defects in lymphocyte cytotoxic function. Prf12/2 mice
fail to clear infection with LCMV, and instead develop a pathological
expansion and activation of CD81 T cells that secrete a plethora of
proinflammatory cytokines.21,22 To define the therapeutic effects of
JAK inhibition in this model of primary HLH, Prf12/2 mice were
treated with PBS or infected with 2 3 105 PFU LCMV Armstrong.
Beginning on day 4 postinfection, animals were treated or not with
ruxolitinib twice daily by oral gavage (Figure 3A). Between days 8
and 10, the peak of the T-cell antiviral immune response, animals were
euthanized and the organs harvested. As anticipated, LCMV-infected
animals developed splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia
(Figure 3B-D); however, following treatment with ruxolitinib, these
parameters completely normalized. In contrast to CpG-injected B6
mice whose splenic leukocyte count was reduced at day 9, the splenic
leukocyte count of LCMV-infected Prf12/2 mice was significantly
increased compared with noninfected animals (Figure 3D). Although
ruxolitinib treatment normalized the WBC in CpG-injected mice,
such treatment had variable effects on the WBC of LCMV-infected
Figure 4. Ruxolitinib treatment reduces LCMV-induced hypercytokinemias and ameliorates liver inflammation. (A) Serum cytokine levels were assessed on days 8 to
10. (B) H&E-stained liver sections demonstrate inflammatory infiltrates (dark purple clusters), indicated by arrows. Representative sections are shown at a magnification

 mice with some animals showing normalization of WBC, whereas in
others it had minimal to no effect.
Compared with CpG-induced disease, the levels of serum IFNg
were 164-foldhigher in LCMV-infected Prf12/2mice,withan average
concentration of 4.1 6 0.22 ng/mL (Figure 4A). LCMV-infected mice
also exhibited increased serum levels of other proinflammatory cyto-
kines, such as IL-6 and TNF-a (Figure 4A). Consistent with these ob-
servations, LCMV-infected mice demonstrated a more pronounced
increase in the number (9.4 6 1/HPF) and area (14% 6 1.9%) en-
compassed by the inflammatory foci in the liver (Figure 4B arrows).
Despite the substantial increase in systemic inflammation, treatment
with ruxolitinib significantly attenuated the levels of proinflammatory
cytokines such as IFNg and TNFa (but not IL-6) and reduced
the number and size of inflammatory foci (Figure 4A-C). Impor-
tantly, ruxolitinib treatment also significantly lessened the profound
weight loss induced by LCMV infection (Figure 4D) and it markedly
enhanced survival (Figure 4E). Together, these data reveal that
treatment with ruxolitinib reduces morbidity and mortality in a
therapeutically relevant manner in this model of primary HLH, a
severe human immune deficiency.
Ruxolitinib reduces T-cell expansion in LCMV-infected

It is proposed that the resulting inability of T and NK cells to properly
lyse infected cells and antigen-presenting cells leads to persistent
immunostimulation and uncontrolled proliferation and activation of
CD81 T cells. Consistent with this notion, depletion of CD81 T cells
lessens serum cytokine levels and tissue immunopathology in LCMV-
infected Prf12/2mice.21 To understand how ruxolitinib is ameliorating
the T-cell–dependent disease phenotype, we examined whether
treatment influenced the number, phenotype, or function of CD81
T cells in LCMV-infected Prf12/2 mice. Following LCMV infection,
we observed a significant increase in the frequency and absolute

Ruxolitinib reduces T-cell cytokine production but does not
impair degranulation or cytotoxicity
ToexaminewhetherexposuretoruxolitinibinfluencedLCMV-specific
T-cell functions, splenocytes from infected or uninfected Prf12/2 mice
were incubated with or without the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class I– or II–restricted LCMV peptides gp33-41 and gp61-80,
respectively. Five hours later, T cells were stained and assessed for
intracellular IFNg and TNFa, and for evidence of degranulation.
Unlike T cells from uninfected mice, a significant proportion of splenic
CD81 (Figure 6A-B) and CD41 (Figure 6C-D) T cells from LCMV-
infected mice simultaneously produced IFNg and TNFa. Similarly, up
to 20% of the CD81Tcellsdegranulated as indicated by theirincreased
cell surface expression of LAMP1 (CD107a). Strikingly, cells from
LCMV-infected and ruxolitinib-treated animals exhibited reduced
production of IFNg and TNFa (Figure 6A-D), but normal de-
granulation (Figure 6E-F). Consistent with the latter observation, we
observed no increase in viral burden in the spleens or livers of

 shown). Because Prf12/2 T cells exhibit no cytotoxic potential, we
used WT B6 T cells to evaluate whether ruxolitinib treatment would
adversely affect lytic activity. CD81 T cells were sorted from the
spleensofB6micethathadbeeninfectedwithLCMVandtreatedornot
with ruxolitinib. T cells were placed in culture with 51Cr-labeled target
cellsthathadorhadnotbeenpulsedwithgp33peptideandspecificlysis
was determined using a 51Cr release assay. In agreement with the de-
granulation data, both ruxolitinib-exposed and -unexposed B6 CD81
T cells exhibited robust killing of gp33-pulsed (Figure 6H filled
symbols), but not unpulsed (Figure 6H open symbols), target cells.
Furthermore, ruxolitinib-treated B6 mice cleared LCMV infection,
albeit with a slight delay in kinetics compared with untreated animals
(Figure 6I).
Ruxolitinib suppresses STAT1-dependent gene expression
in T cells from infected Prf12/2 mice
To establish whether ruxolitinib, a potent inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2,
ameliorates HLH by influencing patterns of JAK-STAT–dependent
gene expression, we performed gene expression profiling using RNA
isolatedfromsplenicCD81TcellssorteddirectlyexvivofromLCMV-
infected or uninfected Prf12/2 mice that had or had not been treated
with ruxolitinib. PCA of the unfiltered data set suggested clustering
of the gene expression profiles of CD81 T cells from uninfected
Prf12/2 mice, regardless of exposure to ruxolitinib (Figure 7A
green vs purple). This is in contrast to infected mice, where
ruxolitinib substantially altered gene expression patterns (Figure 7A
red vs blue). To examine these patterns in more detail, we used
unsupervised hierarchical clustering on probe sets with a fold
change .1.5 log2 difference (1035 probe sets). This analysis
confirmed that ruxolitinib treatment did not induce dramatic changes
in gene expression in naive mice, but it did result in distinct
differences in gene expression in treated vs untreated LCMV-infected
mice (Figure 7B). To explore the meaning of these differences, we
generated the list of genes that were differentially expressed in
CD81 T cells from LCMV-infected Prf12/2 mice that had been
treated or not with ruxolitinib, using a false discovery rate of 5%.
This analysis resulted in a list of 631 genes that we then analyzed for
putative upstream regulators of gene expression using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (Table 1). Consistent with the known mecha-
nism of action of ruxolitinib, we found that IFNg, STAT1, and IRF1
were the top gene regulators predicted to be inhibited in ruxolitinib-
treated mice.
Discussion
Despite current treatment approaches, many HLH patients die due to
the damaging effects of unbridled inflammation, which is fueled by
high systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Because many
HLH-associated cytokines signal via the JAK-STAT pathway, we
hypothesized that JAK inhibition would diminish inflammation and
lessen disease. Indeed, using 2 murine models, we show that the
JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib significantly reduces the manifestations of
HLH and, importantly, such treatment also enhances survival. In vivo
exposure to ruxolitinib differentially influences CD81T-cellfunctions,
as revealed by reduced IFNg and TNFa production but normal de-
granulation and cytotoxic function. Collectively, these data highlight
the central role for JAK-dependent pathways in HLH and provide
proof-of principle that JAK inhibition serves as a viable therapeutic
strategy toreverse the life-threatening hyperinflammation that is typical
of these disorders.
In several murine HLH models, the preemptive or therapeutic
neutralization of IFNg lessens inflammation.18,21,23,24 These findings
have supported the notion that IFNg is a driving cytokine in HLH
and spurred development of a neutralizing anti-human IFNg antibody
that is currently under investigation (www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT01818492). However, cytokines other than IFNg also play
important roles in HLH. Such is the case when Prf12/2 mice are
infected with murine cytomegalovirus, which also elicits significant
tissue inflammation. In this model, however, neutralization of TNFa or
treatment with IL-18–binding protein (a natural inhibitor of IL-18), and
notneutralizationofIFNg,reducesdiseaseseverity.25,26Notably,IFNg
isnothighinallhumanHLHpatients27,28andgeneexpressionprofiling
does not reveal an IFNg signature in HLH patient peripheral blood
mononuclear cells.29 These latter observations suggest that IFNg may
not always be the driving cytokine in human HLH. Indeed, HLH

 patients exhibit high levels of other JAK-dependent cytokines,
such
as
IL-2,
IL-6,
and
macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor.30-32 Therefore, JAK inhibition may be more effective
than IFNg as a treatment of HLH. In support of this this notion, we
show that ruxolitinib lessens disease and enhances survival, even
when administered well after the initiation of CpG- or LCMV-
induced immune stimulation.
Proinflammatory responses are typically counterregulated by
anti-inflammatory mechanisms such as the production of IL-10.
Because IL-10 signals through JAK1,33 we were concerned that
ruxolitinib might interfere with IL-10 signaling, and thereby
exacerbate inflammation. Indeed, previous studies show that IL-10
blockade in the CpG model of secondary HLH leads to increased
symptom severity.18 Despite this concern, we did not observe any
worsening of HLH manifestations in ruxolitinib-treated animals.
Compared with untreated mice, LCMV-infected ruxolitinib-treated
Prf12/2 animals exhibited diminished serum IL-10 levels and their
splenic T cells exhibited fourfold lower levels of IL-10 transcripts (data
not shown). Although this finding could reflect a direct action of
ruxolitinib, it might also result from the lower systemic levels of
IFNg, which are known to drive IL-10 production.34 Thus, the
marked fall of IFNg observed in ruxolitinib-treated mice might
bring a concomitant fall in IL-10. Regardless of the mechanism,
sustained IL-10 levels appear unnecessary for disease amelioration,
as symptoms and survival improved upon ruxolitinib treatment,
despite the lower IL-10 levels.
Ruxolitinib has been reported to impair NK35 and dendritic cell36
function,and todampenT-cellresponses.37,38Itthusremainedpossible
that ruxolitinib would suppress immune function, further impair viral
clearance, and lead to greater disease severity. However, ruxolitinib
treatment did not result in higher viral loads in Prf12/2 mice, nor did
it affect the frequencies of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells (though the
absolute numbers were reduced twofold). Similarly, ruxolitinib treat-
mentofLCMV-infectedB6micedidnotappeartoimpairinvitroT-cell
cytotoxic function and only modestly delayed viral clearance. Despite
this delay in viral clearance, B6 mice did not develop any overt signs of
HLH or worsening of tissue inflammation (Figure 6 and data not
shown).
There are several properties of ruxolitinib that make it particularly
appealing as a treatment of HLH. Ruxolitinib targets inflammation in
a manner distinct from steroids and etoposide. Therefore, ruxolitinib
might synergize with these or other agents to more effectively treat the
disease. IL-6 levels remain elevated in LCMV-infected Prf12/2 mice
despite administration of ruxolitinib. Blockade of IL-6 through use of
tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody recognizing the IL-6 receptor,
results in rapid reversal of cytokine release syndrome in patients
receiving T-cell–based immunotherapies.39 Therefore, the combina-
tionofruxolitinibwithtocilizumabmayproveevenmorebeneficialasa
therapy for HLH. Ruxolitinib has a short half-life and its effects
can be readily titrated.18,40 Consequently, it should be possible to
identify a dose that does not abrogate JAK function, but instead
allows for some degree of cytokine signaling. This residual signaling
could minimize immune suppression and the subsequent risk for
infection. Finally, ruxolitinib is US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved and has a well-defined toxicity profile. The clinical
translation of this work could thus be accelerated through the use of
this agent, which has already been thoroughly tested in children and
adults.41 Together with these properties, our findings support the
integration of JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib into HLH clinical
trials as a novel strategy to counteract pathological cytokine-driven
tissue inflammation.
