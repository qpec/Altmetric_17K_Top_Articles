Estimation of Potential Savings Through
Therapeutic Substitution
Michael E. Johansen, MD, MS; Caroline Richardson, MD
IMPORTANCE Therapeutic substitution offers potential to decrease pharmaceutical
expenditures and potentially improve the efficiency of the health care system.
OBJECTIVE To estimate potential savings through therapeutic substitution in terms of both
overall and out-of-pocket expenditures of branded drugs when a generic in the same class
with the same indication was available.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Repeated cross-sectional study using the 107 132
individuals included in the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
(2010-2012) along with their reported prescribed medicine use. The Orange Book, company
financial statements, US Food and Drug Administration records, and published research were
used for adjunctive information.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Estimated excess expenditure due to branded drug overuse
when a lower-cost generic in the same class with the same indication was available.
RESULTS The study included 107 132 individuals between 2010 and 2012, of whom 62.1%
(95% CI, 61.4%-62.8%) reported use of any prescribed medicine. A total of 31.5% (95% CI,
30.7%-32.2%) used a medication from an included drug class, whereas 16.6% (95% CI,
16.0%-17.1%) of the population used a branded drug from the included classes compared with
24.0% (95% CI, 23.4%-24.7%) who used a generic and 9.1% (95% CI, 8.7%-9.4%) who used
both. In the included drug classes, the majority of the drugs were generics, with a total of
93.5 billion standardized doses compared with 47.4 billion standardized doses of branded
drugs. Total expenditure of the branded drugs accounted for $147 (95% CI, $137-$156) billion
compared with $62.7 (95% CI, $58.9-$66.5) billion for the generics. Between 2010 and 2012,
an estimated $73.0 (95% CI, $67.6-$78.5) billion in total excess expenditure and $24.6 (95%
CI, $22.6-$26.5) billion in out-of-pocket excess expenditure was attributable to branded drug
overuse. The excess was present across numerous drug classes throughout many aspects of
medicine and equates to 9.6% of total and 14.1% of out-of-pocket prescribed medicine
expenses. The drug classes with the highest excess expenditure included statins ($10.9 [SE,
$0.41] billion), atypical antipsychotics ($9.99 [SE, $1.03] billion), proton pump inhibitors
($6.12 [SE, $0.38] billion), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ($6.08 [SE, $0.49] billion),
and angiotensin receptor blockers ($5.53 [SE, $0.35] billion).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although therapeutic substitution is controversial, it offers a
potential mechanism to significantly decrease drug costs if it can be implemented in a way
that does not negatively affect quality of care.

T
he United States spends more per capita on health care
and pharmaceutical agents than any other country.1 De-
spite this, the country continues to lag behind the world
in terms of health care outcomes.2(pp25-90) The prescription
drug market became notably more efficient after numerous
statespassedlawsthatallowedforgenericsubstitution.3Asimi-
lar but more controversial way to improve the efficiency of the
pharmaceutical market is therapeutic substitution, which con-
sists of substituting chemically different compounds within
the same class for one another.
Most physician organizations are opposed to therapeutic
substitution and see it as an attack on physician autonomy.4-7
In addition, there are concerns regarding efficacy, adverse ef-
fects, drug interactions, and different indications for drugs
within a class.8,9 A previous study showed substantial poten-
tialsavingsiftherapeuticsubstitutionwereintroducedtoMedi-
care Part D.10 In addition, a nationally representative study
showed high levels of branded proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use
and expenditure between 2007 and 2011 when a therapeuti-
cally equivalent generic medication was available.11
Given these findings, we set out to rigorously estimate po-
tential savings on prescribed medicines through therapeutic
substitutionbetween2010and2012.Toaccomplishthis,meth-
odssimilartotheanalysisofPPIswerebroadenedtootherdrug
classes to estimate total and out-of-pocket excess expendi-
ture compared with available generic drugs within the class.
Methods
Study Design
The 2010 to 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)
was used for this repeated cross-sectional analysis.12 This na-
tionally representative survey of the noninstitutionalized ci-
vilian population of the United States is sponsored by the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. It annually comprises ap-
proximately 15 000 households and gathers information
through 5 interviews over 2 years on 2 overlapping cohorts.
The survey uses a complex survey design and includes demo-
graphic characteristics, expenditures by payer and type, self-
reported medical conditions, and prescribed drug informa-
tion. The primary study outcome was total estimated excess
expenditureduetooveruseofbranddrugswhenagenericdrug
was available within the same class with the same indication.
This study was considered to be exempt by the Ohio State Uni-
versity institutional review board. Informed consent was ob-
tained through MEPS procedures.
Drug Classes
Drug classes were identified for potential inclusion by isolat-
ing classes identified in the top 200 grossing drugs of 201013
or the top 100 grossing drugs of 201114 or 2012.15 Drug classes
were included in a given year if they contained both a generic
or widely accessible over-the-counter (OTC) drug and a brand-
name drug without an available chemically equivalent ge-
neric. A previous study was used to guide placement of phar-
maceutical agents into drug classes.16
Some drug classes were excluded. Antibiotics (only fluo-
roquinolones) were excluded because of concerns about
therapeutic substitution related to different bacterial suscep-
tibility patterns. Insulin was not included because no generics
were available. Respiratory anticholinergics (ie, tiotropium
bromide) and testosterone were not included because of the
difficulty in comparing equivalent dosing related to different
formulations. For instance, testosterone could be given as a
shot, topical gel, or patch, whereas ipratropium bromide and
tiotropium have different dosing schedules and formulations.
Prescribed Medications
WithintheMEPS,prescribeddruginformation,includingmedi-
cal reason for use, was collected during interviews with the
head of the household. After gaining approval, pharmacies
were contacted to collect additional data, such as the Na-
tional Drug Code (NDC), medication name, strength, quan-
tity, expenditures, and payment source. National Drug Codes
were imputed if pharmacies reported an invalid NDC. The sur-
vey’
sdrugdatahavebeenfoundtobevalid,especiallyformedi-
cationsforlong-termuse.17Combinationpharmaceuticalswere
included only if the medication of interest was combined with
a low-cost generic. When it was necessary to determine a for-
mulation such as extended release, NDCs were used in com-
bination with drug names.
Certain prescribed medications were excluded from the
study if they were not clearly included in a drug class. Aripip-
razole was also not included in the primary analysis because
the study that was used to guide drug classes classified it as
thefirst“atypicalantipsychotic–dopaminesystemstabilizer.
”16
Vilazodone hydrochloride was not included because its class
affiliation was uncertain.
Medications were excluded if the branded medication
was US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for an
indication for which no in-class generic was approved (only
milnacipran hydrochloride). In additional, branded drugs
were excluded if the drug was used for an FDA-approved
indication for which no available generic medication was
approved. Participant-reported indications, International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) coded, were
used for this purpose. Specifically, duloxetine hydrochloride
was excluded if it was associated with diabetes mellitus or
musculoskeletal complaints that could be associated with
fibromyalgia. Raloxifene hydrochloride was excluded if it
Key Points
Question What was the estimated excess expenditure due to
branded drug overuse when a lower-cost generic in the same class
with the same indication was available?
Findings In this cross-sectional study, a high level of excess
expenditure was identified among 26 drug classes between 2010
and 2012 due to the use of branded drugs when a generic drug
was available in the same class.
Meaning Therapeutic substitution offers a potential mechanism
to decrease drug costs if it can be implemented in a way that does
not negatively affect quality of care.

was associated with bone health. Quetiapine fumarate and
olanzapine were excluded in 2010 through 2011 if they were
associated with depression and there was no secondary diag-
nosis of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or neurotic disorders
noted (see eText 1 in the Supplement for ICD-9 codes). The
only exception to exclusion on the basis of FDA-approved
indication was pregabalin, which included all prescriptions
given the widespread use of gabapentin for the same indica-
tions, as well as a lack of published comparative studies
between the two.18(pp17-31)19(pp21-28)20
Brand vs Generic Determination
A data set available through the National Bureau of Economic
Research was used to determine New Drug Application (NDA),
Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), or an NDA Autho-
rized Generic for individual drugs.21 These distinctions were
primarily used to determine brand or generic status. Autho-
rized generics were categorized by whether the cost of the
medication was more similar to the brand or generic cost. Of
theincludedprescriptions,13.4%(2010),9.5%(2011),and6.9%
(2012) did not match via NDC.
Inconjunctionwiththeapplicationstatus,theOrangeBook
was used to identify the initial ANDA for all included drugs to
help classify prescriptions as brand or generic.22 An Internet
search (http://www.google.com) was also used to identify legal
actions or agreements that prevented generic drug availability.
Generic approval dates and delayed generic market entry dates
are listed in eTable 1 in the Supplement. When no application
status was matched, drugs that had predominant brand/
generics were assumed to be associated with the predominant
status. At times, an Internet search (http://www.google.com)
was used for drugs with a large number of unmatched
prescriptions (>10%) or drugs that had a fairly even split of
brand and generic prescriptions.
Pharmaceutical Rebates
Pharmaceutical companies frequently provide rebates to pay-
ers, which are not accounted for in the MEPS. Because
rebates are proprietary information, they were estimated in a
similar fashion to previous estimates.23 Company financial
statements were used to identify revenues for individual
drugs in the United States (see eTable 2 in the Supplement).
This information was then compared with estimates from
both MEPS and Veraspan13/IMS Health.14,15 (see eTable 2 in
the Supplement). The Veraspan/IMS Health data were
included to allow a comparison to another estimate given the
potential for overreporting or underreporting of individual
drugs in the MEPS.
The rebate was assumed to be consistent among a class if
1 drug in the class had data available through financial re-
ports. It was calculated by dividing the difference between the
MEPS estimate and the financial statement data by the MEPS
estimate. When financial statement data were available for
multiple drugs in a class, rebate estimates were made by com-
bining the drugs to create a class mean. When no data were
available within a class, all available data from other drug
classes were combined to estimate a mean rebate. The esti-
mated rebate for drug classes was 32%.
Standardized Dosing
Total quantity was identified for each brand and generic drug.
Quantity was standardized for each individual drug to a nor-
mal daily dose (see eTable 1 in the Supplement). For instance,
total quantity of gabapentin was divided by 3 because the typi-
cal recommended dosage is 3 times per day whereas pregaba-
lin was divided by 2 because the typical recommended dos-
age is 2 times per day. Atypical antipsychotics and stimulants
had varied dosing patterns, so estimates of dosing had to be
based on the number of doses that were dispensed in differ-
ent prescriptions (30 vs 60 doses). Nonpill formulations such
as eyedrops and nasal preparations were compared by weight
or volume.
Expenditure Data
Within the MEPS, expenditures and payment source are de-
termined through information obtained from the pharmacy.
Total and out-of-pocket expenditures were identified for all
branded and generic drugs. To more accurately represent ac-
tual cost to payers, the branded drug total expenditures were
then reduced by the applicable estimated pharmaceutical re-
bate percentage for the class.
In addition, total prescribed drug expenditures (exclud-
ing diabetic testing supplies) were identified for all prescrip-
tions drugs via the MEPS. To better estimate total prescribed
drug expenditures, the cumulative estimated drug rebate of
all classes was subtracted from the total prescription drug ex-
penditure along with an estimated 5% pharmaceutical re-
bate. The 5% reduction was included because drug classes
without multiple drugs or classes that are predominantly ge-
neric likely have a lower rebate than those investigated in this
study. When a first-in-class generic was approved between
2010 and 2012, the total cost and quantity of the branded drug
was prorated to include only the portion of the year during
which the new generic was available.
Overuse Estimates
Given a lack of previous overuse estimates for branded drugs
when there is an in-class generic, estimates were made for the
frequency that the branded drug could be replaced by an al-
ternative generic drug. Randomized clinical trials, system-
atic reviews, level of innovation,16 and number of alternative
generics were used to make estimates (see eText 2 in the
Supplement). Statin overuse was estimated at 66% because
33% of atorvastatin and/or rosuvastatin users reported coro-
nary artery disease.
Data Analysis
A mean cost per standardized dose of all generic medications
withinaclasswascalculated.Genericswithmuchhighermean
cost (mostly recently off patent) were excluded from this mean
whentherewerenumerousin-classgenericsavailable.Branded
drugswereincludedasgenericsforketotifenfumarateandzaf-
irlukast because of unstable estimates related to high stan-
dard errors.
For branded drugs, cost per standardized dose was calcu-
lated by dividing the post–pharmaceutical rebate total or total
out-of-pocket cost by the standardized dose. Each branded

tracted by the mean (total and out of pocket) cost per dose of
thein-classgeneric(s)onayearlybasis.Thedifferencewasthen
multiplied by total number of standardized doses and then
multiplied by the overuse estimate.
Sensitivity Analysis
The estimated excess use was decreased by 10% for all drug
classes, hence decreasing the estimated excess expenditure.
Aripiprazole was included in the atypical antipsychotics and
treated like olanzapine and quetiapine.
Statistical Analysis
The analysis was conducted using STATA, version 13 (STATA
Corporation), and included the recoding of 1 omeprazole ex-
pense, 1 eszopiclone quantity, and 1 alendronate sodium quan-
tity outlier. Complex survey weighting was used throughout
the analysis. All expenditures were converted to 2012 dollars
by using the Consumer Price Index.23
Results
Thestudyincluded107 132individualsbetween2010and2012,
of whom 62.1% (95% CI, 61.4%-62.8%) reported use of any pre-
scribed medicine. Demographic characteristics of the popu-
lation are included in Table 1. A total of 31.5% (95% CI, 30.7%-
32.2%)usedamedicationfromanincludeddrugclass,whereas
16.6% (95% CI, 16.0%-17.1%) used a branded drug from an in-
cludedclasscomparedwith24.0%(95%CI,23.4%-24.7%)who
used a generic and 9.1% (95% CI, 8.7%-9.4%) who used both.
In the included drug classes, excluding those standardized by
weight or volume, the majority of the drug use was among ge-
nerics, with a total of 93.5 billion standardized doses com-
pared with 47.4 billion standardized doses among branded
medications. The percentage of generic medications varied
among drug classes, with some consisting of predominantly
brandusesuchasleukotrieneantagonistsandstimulants,while
others had low levels of brand use such as β-blockers, hypnot-
ics, and antihistamines (Table 2).
Prerebate total expenditures are reported in eTable 2 in the
Supplement, and postrebate class-level total expenditures are
listed in Table 1. The included drug classes had a total expen-
diture of $213 (95% CI, $201-$225) billion. Of this, $147 (95%
CI, $137-$156) billion was spent on branded drugs after esti-
mated pharmaceutical rebates ($217 billion prior to rebate es-
timates), while $62.7 (95% CI, $58.9-$66.5) billion was spent
on generics. The final estimated excess was $73.0 (95% CI,
$67.6-$78.5) billion (Table 2), which was $97 (95% CI, $90-
$104) billion prior to overuse estimates. Of the excess, $24.6
(95% CI, $22.6-$26.5) billion was paid directly by the con-
sumer in out-of-pocket expenses after factoring in overuse es-
timates ($30.4 billion prior to overuse estimates).
In total, an estimated $760 (95% CI, $708-$813) billion was
expended on prescribed medications between 2010 and 2012.
The excess expenditure due to branded drug overuse ac-
counted for 9.6% of total prescribed medication expendi-
ture.Totalout-of-pocketexpenditureswere$175(95%CI,$167-
$184) billion between 2010 and 2012, of which out-of-pocket
excess expenditure due to brand drug overuse was 14.1%.
The excess was present in numerous drug classes through-
out many aspects of medicine (Table 1). The 2 largest drug
classes in terms of estimated excess expenditure were statins
and atypical antipsychotics. Some drug classes with numer-
ous branded and/or generic options had high levels of esti-
matedrebates,including59%forPPIs,53%forβ-blockers,47%
for statins, 38% for angiotension receptor blockers, 37% for se-
lective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and 36% for fibrates.
Other drug classes did not have substantial rebates, including

Discussion
Between 2010 and 2012, an estimated $73.0 billion in excess
of generic cost was spent on brand drugs within the same class.
Importantly, this estimate takes into consideration pharma-
ceutical rebates to payers, as well as unique indications for
branded medications and overuse estimates. Much of the ex-
cess expenditure was concentrated in a few drug classes (stat-
ins, atypical antipsychotics, angiotension receptor blockers,
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, selective sero-
toninreuptakeinhibitors,andPPIs)butwasidentifiedthrough-
out different aspects of medicine. In total, this accounted for
nearly 1 in 10 dollars spent on prescribed medications. In con-
trast to payers, patients do not get rebates on their purchases
and were responsible for a considerable portion of the excess
by expending 33% of the total excess, or $24.6 billion in out-
of-pocket expenses.
The general acceptance of generic substitution has in-
creased the efficiency of the prescription drug market. Use of
generic drugs leads to higher levels of adherence24 and has de-
creased health care costs while improving outcomes. Critical
to the growth of the generic drug market was the idea of thera-
peutic equivalence and hence substitution of generic for
branded drugs.3

a Total expenditure is the entire drug class after the estimated pharmaceutical
rebate has been taken into account. Ocular antihistamines, nasal steroids, and
prostaglandins excluded from calculation of total quantity due to difference in
units in both total quantity and percent branded medications of quantity. Both
excess total and out-of-pocket expenditure take into account the cost of
generic(s) as well as estimates for overuse. Total quantity is standardized to be
the mean daily use with the exception of those that were measured by weight
or volume.
bMore expensive generic medication not included in calculation of total or self
excess expenditure.
c Estimated by taking the mean of all drugs with data available in financial
statements.

There is limited support for therapeutic substitution25,26;
however,itisopposedbymanygroups.4-6Similartogenericsub-
stitution in the past, physician opposition, in part, is related to
thedegradationofphysicianautonomy.3Thereislegitimatecon-
cern that therapeutic substitutions could lead to worse clinical
outcomes, but this would likely be concentrated in high-risk
drug classes. It is also possible that therapeutic substitution
could lead to lower than anticipated returns if nonpharmaceu-
tical costs increase (eg, hospitalizations).27 If therapeutic sub-
stitution were to become commonplace, more efficient sys-
temsthatallowforseamlesscommunicationamongprescribers,
pharmacies, and insurance companies should be in place. With
the ever-increasing paperwork burden28,29 and high burnout
rates among physicians,30 increasing the complexity of care
could be counterproductive.
At present, drug prices are higher in the United States than
inothercountriespartiallyasaresultof“amixoflawsthatforce
insurers to include all expensive drugs in their policies.
”31 Re-
cent efforts to price drugs on the basis of value are a step in the
right direction.32,33 In addition, the American Medical Associa-
tion recently called for an end to direct-to-consumer adver-
tising.34 Direct-to-consumer advertising and physician promo-
tionhavebeenusedasmarketingtechniquesbyindustry35-38and
have had a significant impact on the use of branded drugs.39,40
Giventhegenerallackofhigh-quality,randomizedclinicaltrials
to guide use within a drug class,41 along with a recognized bias
in pharmaceutical-funded trials,42 these marketing strategies
may be increasing costs without delivering improved out-
comes. In addition, patients seem to perceive more expensive
drugs as more effective,43 whereas physicians can have nega-
tiveperceptionsofgenericdrugs.44Fewpivotaltrialsincludeac-
tive comparators,45 and trials that do compare active treat-
ments are less likely to be published if the results support
therapeuticequivalenceasaresultofthewell-documentedphe-
nomenon of publication bias in favor of trials with positive
results.46-48 Unbiased information, such as independent high-
quality, randomized clinical comparative effectiveness re-
search, could substantially reduce health care costs and make
interventions such as therapeutic substitution less lucrative.
This study has numerous important limitations. Pharma-
ceutical rebates to payers are proprietary information. Esti-
mates were made on the basis of US-specific numbers in com-
pany annual reports. These numbers were not available for
many drug classes, which necessitated estimates based on un-
relateddrugclasses.Evenwhennumberswereavailablewithin
a class, the assumption that all drugs within a class have simi-
lar levels of rebates is also potentially problematic, as is the as-
sumptionthatexclusivelybrandedandnonexclusivelybranded
drugs have the same rebate levels. It is also important to note
thatcompanyfinancialstatementsdonotnecessarilyalignwith
themedicationexpenditure(evenafterrebate)becausewhole-
salers could buy pharmaceuticals that would be counted on
financialstatements,butnotwithintheactualexpendituredur-
ing that period.23
Given a lack of literature to determine the overuse of
branded drugs within each drug class, estimates were made
using a variety of sources. Given the subjectivity of the esti-
mates, a sensitivity analysis was conducted and individual es-
timates were listed to allow readers to alter the estimates. It is
possible that estimates overestimated or underestimated
branded drug overuse.
Whereas NDCs were used in instances in which ANDAs
and/or NDAs did not match to the FDA data set, there is po-
tentialthatincorrectallocationcouldhaveoccurred.UseofOTC
drugs in comparison with branded prescription counterparts
limited the strength of total quantity comparisons as a result
of the underreporting of OTC drugs within the MEPS, but the
assumption that we used for the mean price per dose for OTC
drugs is likely reasonable. In addition, drug classes that in-
clude both generic and OTC drugs (ie, PPIs and ocular/oral an-
tihistamines) could overestimate mean generic cost if OTC
drugs were underreported and were lower in cost.
Therearenumerousadditionallimitations.First,eachstan-
dardized dose of medications within a class was assumed to
be equal (eg, 20 mg of omeprazole vs 40 mg of esomeprazole
magnesium),whichisfrequentlynotthecase.Itisunclearhow
clinically relevant these differences would be in terms of cost
or effectiveness. In addition, the dosing schedules that were
assumedforindividualdrugsarenotnecessarilyhowthedrugs
are actually used in clinical practice for all medication users.
Only when there was a large amount of variance in use or an
obvious discrepancy from recommended dosing were dosing
patterns from individuals used to construct the standardized
dosing. Finally, this analysis did not include inpatient medi-
cations,testosterone,respiratoryanticholinergics,drugclasses
that included generic substitution for all drugs, or aripip-
razole(sensitivityanalysisonly),whichcouldleadtothisanaly-
sis underestimating the overall excess expenditure.
Conclusions
There was a large amount of excess expenditure on branded
drugs between 2010 and 2012 in classes that could have in-
corporatedtherapeuticsubstitution.Althoughtherapeuticsub-
stitution is controversial, it offers a potential mechanism to de-
crease drug costs if it can be implemented in a way that does
not negatively affect quality of care.
