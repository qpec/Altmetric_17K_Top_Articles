Abstract
Objective: Seventy percent of postmenopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms, which can be highly
disruptive and persist for years. Hormone therapy and other treatments have variable efficacy and/or side effects.
Neurokinin B signaling increases in response to estrogen deficiency and has been implicated in hot flash (HF) etiology.
Werecentlyreportedthataneurokinin3receptor(NK3R)antagonistreducesHFinpostmenopausalwomenafter4weeks
of treatment. In this article we report novel data from that study, which shows the detailed time course of this effect.
Methods: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, crossover trial of an oral NK3R
antagonist (MLE4901) for vasomotor symptoms in women aged 40 to 62 years, experiencing �7 HF/24 hours
some of which were reported as bothersome or severe (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02668185). Thirty-seven women were
randomized and included in an intention-to-treat analysis. To ascertain the therapeutic profile of MLE4901, a post
hoc time course analysis was completed.
Results: By day 3 of treatment with MLE4901, HF frequency reduced by 72% (95% CI, �81.3 to �63.3%)
compared with baseline (51 percentage point reduction compared with placebo, P < 0.0001); this effect size
persisted throughout the 4-week dosing period. HF severity reduced by 38% compared with baseline by day 3 (95%
CI, �46.1 to �29.1%) (P < 0.0001 compared with placebo), bother by 39% (95% CI, �47.5 to �30.1%)
(P < 0.0001 compared with placebo), and interference by 61% (95% CI, �79.1 to �43.0%) (P ¼ 0.0006 compared
with placebo); all continued to improve throughout the 4-week dosing period (to �44%, �50%, and �70%,
respectively by day 28, all P < 0.0001 compared with placebo).
Conclusions: NK3R antagonism rapidly relieves vasomotor symptoms without the need for estrogen exposure.
Key Words: Hot flashes – Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist – NK3R – RCT – Sleep – Vasomotor

eventy percent of postmenopausal women experience
vasomotor symptoms, which can be highly disruptive
and persist for years; 10% describe them as intolera-
ble.1,2 For the majority of participants in the MsFLASH 02
study, the two most bothersome symptoms of menopause
were vasomotor symptoms and sleep disturbance.3 Hormone
therapy and other alternative treatments, including some
antidepressants, gabapentin, cognitive behavioral therapy,
and herbal remedies, have variable efficacy and/or limited
availability, and/or significant adverse profiles with recom-
mended contraindications for some women including those
with a history of breast cancer for example.4-8 As such a novel
therapeutic that safely and effectively treated hot flashes
(HFs) could benefit millions of women worldwide.
Scientific research has changed our understanding of HF
etiology over the last 20 years with two critical findings. The
first was the role of specialized hypothalamic neurons that
colocalize kisspeptin, neurokinin B (NKB), and dynorphin
receptors (KNDy neurons) across the reproductive lifespan9;
and the second was the work of Rance and colleagues who
have elucidated the neurocircuitry of hypothalamic NKB
signaling together with its receptor, the neurokinin 3 receptor
(NK3R), in the thermoregulatory autonomic system in
response to estrogen deficiency.10-15 Two recent publications
further implicate NKB/NK3R signaling in menopausal flush-
ing: (1) peripheral administration of NKB in premenopausal
women resulted in HFs that were typical of those described by
postmenopausal women,16 and (2) a population-based study
suggested genetic variation in TACR3, the gene that encodes
NK3R could be associated with the variability in vasomotor
symptoms experienced by postmenopausal women.17 Collec-
tively, the prior literature led us to hypothesize that NKB/
NK3R signaling is critical in menopausal flushing. We there-
fore carried out a study to determine whether vasomotor
symptoms in postmenopausal women could be attenuated
by administration of an oral NK3R antagonist. This trial
completed earlier this year and confirmed that an NK3R
antagonist can reduce HFs in postmenopausal women after
4 weeks of treatment.18 In this article we report novel data
from that study, which shows the detailed time course of
this effect.
METHODS
Study design and participants
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-
center, crossover study recruited women aged 40 to 62 years
who were having at least seven flashes/24-h period (of which
some were reported as being severe or bothersome), and who
had not had a menstrual period for at least 12 months (Clin-
icaltrials.gov
NCT02668185).
Sixty-eight
women
were
screened, of which 45 were confirmed eligible to enter the
study which started with a 2-week baseline ‘‘run in’’ period to
establish ‘‘steady state’’ and familiarity with recording symp-
toms.18 Thirty-seven participants were confirmed to be eligi-
ble to enter the active phase of the study, and so received
4 weeks of treatment with an oral selective NK3R antagonist
twice daily (MLE4901; Millendo Therapeutics, Inc., Ann
Arbor, MI) and 4 weeks of exact-match placebo twice daily
in the order generated by central randomization separated by a

FIG. 1. Summary of protocol: baseline period: participants underwent a 2-week period to gather baseline data on hot flush (HF) frequency, HF severity,
HF bother, and perceived HF interference (Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale). If the inclusion criteria regarding HF frequency and severity
were met at the end of this period, then they were assigned to the active phase of the study after randomization (black circle). Intervention 1 (double-
blind): all participants randomized to either 4 weeks of treatment with oral, 40 mg twice daily MLE4901 or exact-match placebo. Washout period: all
participants underwent a 2-week washout period after intervention 1 (half-life of MLE4901 is 8.5 h). Intervention 2 (double-blind): all participants then
switched to receive either four weeks treatment with oral twice daily exact-match placebo or oral 40 mg twice daily MLE4901 depending on which
intervention they received first. Monitoring period: a subsequent 2-week period to complete safety monitoring. Figure available under the terms of the

ambulatory during the study and no restriction was placed on
lifestyle. Full details outlining inclusion and exclusion criteria
and study design are as previously described.18 Approvals
were granted by the West London Regional Ethics Committee
(15/LO/1481), and the Medicine and Healthcare Products
Regulatory Agency (EudraCT 2015-001553-32). The trial
was registered in full at ClinicalTrials.gov before study start
(NCT02668185), and performed in accordance with Good
Clinical Practice Guidelines.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was total number of HFs during the
fourth week of treatment with MLE4901 and placebo. Second-
ary outcomes included HF severity, bother, interference, repro-
ductive hormone concentrations, Menopause-Specific Quality
of Life (MENQOL) domain scores, and objective measurement
of HFs using a skin conductance monitor (Bahr monitor). HF
frequency,severity, andbotherdata werecollatedtwicedaily to
capture symptoms that occurred during the daytime and those
that occurred during the nighttime separately. For all outcomes,
outlined a priori in ourprotocol, comparison was made between
the averagedailyvalueduringthefourthweekoftreatmentwith
MLE4901 and placebo, and also between the average daily
value during the fourth week of both treatment periods and the
second week of the baseline period. Full details outlining study
design methodology are as previously described.18 Post hoc
time course analysis was subsequently conducted to ascertain
the therapeutic profile of MLE4901 by comparing mean daily
total at day 3, and mean weekly total after week 1, week 2, week
3, and week 4 of both treatment periods, and also compared
with the second week of the baseline period. To assess the
impact on sleep, post hoc analyses were completed on daytime
and nighttime vasomotor symptoms separately, and a selection
of individual MENQOL and Hot Flash Related Daily Interfer-
ence Scale (HFRDIS) items (MENQOL:‘‘difficultysleeping,’’
‘‘lethargy,’’ ‘‘tiredness,’’ ‘‘stamina,’’ ‘‘muscle ache,’’ ‘‘phys-
ical strength’’; HFRDIS: ‘‘sleep,’’ ‘‘concentration’’). All post
hoc analyses are reported in this article.
Statistical analysis
Our a priori statistical plan was strictly followed as previ-
ously described18; in summary, analyses were completed for
the intention-to-treat (ITT; n ¼ 37) and per-protocol (n ¼ 28)
data sets using generalized linear mixed models and standard
crossover analysis to estimate the adjusted (least squares)
means, and differences between treatment means, together
with associated 95% CIs and P value. A similar approach
was used for our post hoc analyses in our modified ITT cohort
using only observed data rather than an imputation technique
(therefore using a minimum of n ¼ 33 and maximum n ¼ 35 out
of a total number of 37 participants, except for percentage
change from baseline for the HFRDIS items ‘‘sleep’’ and
‘‘concentration’’ where the minimum was n ¼ 27 due to 7
participants scoring 0 at baseline). Data were analyzed using
generalized linear mixed models with an unstructured covari-
ance matrix. For all models used, a standard crossover analysis
was implemented with period, administration sequence, and
treatment as fixed effects and subject as a random effect as
previously described.18 In the a priori analyses, the final model
only necessitated inclusion of the baseline value as a covari-
ate.18 Similarly, our post hoc analyses only required the base-
line value as a covariate as well. For each subject, the
percentage change from baseline was calculated at each
time point, with baseline defined from the data captured during
the second week of the baseline period. The percentage change
from baseline was then analyzed using the above-described
generalized linear mixed model. From each model, as before,
adjusted (least squares) means and differences between treat-
ment means were estimated, together with associated 95% CIs,
and a P value from a comparison of the mean values of the two
treatments.18 Post hoc analyses of linear correlation calculated
the Pearson correlation coefficient. A priori sample size and
power calculation were performed using published data from
studies with similar methodology; including an anticipated
25%improvementinsymptomswithplacebo19-23aspreviously
described.18
Funding
This was an academic investigator initiated and led study,
which was funded by the UK Medical Research Council
(grant reference MR/M024954/1) and an National Institute
for Health Research Professorship to WSD (grant reference
RP-2014-05-001).
RESULTS
Full results of the a priori outcomes (mean HF frequency,
severity, bother, interference, MENQOL domains, and sweat
monitor data during the final week of the 4-wk treatment
period with MLE4901 and placebo), luteinizing hormone
pulsatility, and safety data are as previously reported.18
Post hoc analysis of questionnaire data (minimum n ¼ 33
participants, maximum n ¼ 35 participants) demonstrated that
by day 3 of treatment with MLE4901, HF frequency reduced
by 72% compared with baseline (95% CI, �81.3 to �63.3%;
51 percentage point decrease compared with placebo,
P < 0.0001) and this effect size persisted throughout the 4-
week dosing period. HF severity, bother, and interference,
however, continued to improve throughout dosing. At day 3
HF severity reduced by 38% compared with baseline (95% CI,
�46.1 to �29.1%; 31 percentage point reduction compared
with placebo, P < 0.0001), which then reduced further to
�43% by day 14 and �44% by day 28 (39 percentage point
reduction compared with placebo); bother reduced by 39%
(95% CI, �47.5 to �30.1; 34 percentage point reduction
compared with placebo, P < 0.0001), which then reduced
further to �45% by day 14 and �50% by day 28 (46
percentage point reduction compared with placebo), and
interference reduced by 61% (95% CI, �79.1 to �43.0%;
37 percentage point reduction compared with placebo,
P ¼ 0.0006), which then reduced further to �64% by
day 14 and �70% by day 28 (40 percentage point reduction
compared with placebo) (for full time course data, see Fig. 2;

day 28 data as previously reported [ITT: n ¼ 37]18). Contin-
ued improvement in HF symptoms over the 4-week period of
treatment was not seen with placebo (Fig. 2). HF frequency,
severity, and bother were all positively correlated (r ¼ 0.76-
0.93, P < 0.0001). HF interference was also positively corre-
lated with frequency, severity, and bother, but the strength of
association was weaker (r ¼ 0.62-0.65, P < 0.0001). Post hoc
analysis also demonstrated that a similar improvement in HF
symptoms was achieved during the daytime as during the
nighttime after treatment with MLE4901, and again the
improvement was rapid (Table 1).
The psychosocial and physical domains of the MENQOL
questionnaires significantly improved as a result of treatment
with MLE4901.18 Post hoc analysis suggested that this was
due to improved sleep as items less likely to be related to this
such as ‘‘muscle ache’’ and ‘‘physical strength’’ were not
significantly different (P ¼ 0.3685 and P ¼ 0.7808, respec-
tively) after treatment with MLE4901, whereas those more
likely to be related to improved sleep such as ‘‘difficulty
sleeping,’’ ‘‘tiredness,’’ and ‘‘lethargy’’ were (P < 0.0001,
P ¼ 0.0019,
and
P ¼ 0.0175,
respectively)
(Table
2).
Improvements in sleeping, tiredness, and lethargy were sig-
nificant by day 3 of treatment with MLE4901. Similar results
were seen in post hoc analysis of two of the individual items of
the HF-related daily interference score (HFRDIS): both
‘‘sleep’’ and ‘‘concentration’’ (n ¼ 27-29 as 7 participants
scored 0 at baseline) significantly improved with treatment
with MLE4901, and again as early as day 3 ( Table 3). There
was a linear concordance between the two sleep items in the
two questionnaire measures ‘‘difficulty sleeping’’ in MEN-
QOL and ‘‘sleep’’ in HFRDIS (r ¼ 0.70, P < 0.0001).
DISCUSSION
In this post hoc analysis we have demonstrated that an oral
NK3R
antagonist (MLE4901) rapidly, and effectively,
reduced frequency, severity, bother, and interference of vaso-
motor symptoms. Furthermore, similar improvements were
seen in daytime and nighttime symptoms, and participants
also experienced significant improvement in sleep. Consider-
ing that in the MsFLASH 02 study vasomotor symptoms and
sleep were the two foremost symptom priorities for partic-
ipants, these findings are particularly important3, and further
advance the understanding of the specific therapeutic profile
of NK3R antagonists both on symptomatology and speed of
onset. Importantly, treatment was also well tolerated.18
It is difficult to compare the onset of action with other
currently available treatments for vasomotor symptoms as the
preexisting trials have only reported ‘‘end of study’’ data. For
example, the reported data for hormone therapy in trials range
from 3 months to 3 years,24 for paroxetine is after 6 weeks of

treatment,25 and for gabapentin is after 12 weeks of treat-
ment.26 Mean weekly total for week 1 was slightly worse than
the total for day 3 in all outcomes after treatment with
MLE4901 and this is likely because the weekly total was
an average that included days 1 and 2 of treatment. Interest-
ingly, participants anecdotally reported a noticeable change in
their symptoms after approximately 48 hours of starting treat-
ment with MLE4901, and also reported a similar time to offset
on cessation.
It is also difficult to conclude to what extent the improve-
ment in sleep and concentration were a result of less disrup-
tion through the night as flashes were less frequent and/or less
severe/bothersome, so overall sleep quality was improved, or
as a result of a direct effect on neuronal pathways involved in
sleep by MLE4901. It is plausible that both explanations are
contributory to the improvement in symptoms; especially as
prior research has shown that melanin-concentrating hormone
neurons, which are involved in the sleep–wake cycle, express
NK3R.27,28 Furthermore, NK3R has also been shown to be
present in the prefrontal cortex, which is an important brain
area for concentration,29 and a prior meta-analysis suggested
that hormone therapy may improve cognitive function in
young women,30 though this was disputed in the WHI Mem-
ory Study31 but methodological differences may explain this
disparity in findings. Further study in larger clinical trials of
NK3R antagonists, as well as preclinical studies, may help to
provide mechanistic and symptomatic detail.
As per previous studies the placebo effect was sizeable
(28% reduction in HF frequency, which is similar to the
reported rate in the literature of 25%), and this is why it is
critical for trials investigating new treatments for vasomotor
symptoms to be placebo controlled. The treatment effect size
of MLE4901 above that achieved by placebo (percentage
point reduction compared with placebo) was, however, highly
significant for all outcomes. Although direct comparison with
other available treatments is problematic as outlined above,
our data suggest that the treatment effect of MLE4901 is
similar to that of hormone therapy, and superior to that
achieved by standard prescription doses of paroxetine or
gabapentin,24-26 and thus is likely to be clinically meaningful.
Our results fit entirely with the preexisting data that have
implicated NKB/NK3R signaling as a critical mediator of
menopausal vasomotor symptoms. From the early work by
Rance et al in postmortem brain specimens that demonstrated
the marked hypertrophy and increased activity of hypotha-
lamic neurons with upregulated NKB gene expression,15 to
the more recent first report in a clinical trial of inducing
typical flashes in premenopausal women by infusing NKB
peripherally.16 Mechanistically, it seems clear that it is the
subsequent increased activation of/input to the thermoregula-
tory autonomic pathway via increased NKB/NK3R signaling
through the median preoptic nucleus in response to estrogen
withdrawal that is critical.10-14 This heightened signaling
pathway can seemingly now be silenced by pharmacological
blockade with an oral NK3R antagonist, and thus vasomotor
symptoms can be attenuated to the significant benefit of

otherwise deeply affected women. Moreover, this can be
achieved rapidly, and without the need for estrogen exposure
making it a more attractive, or even clinically possible, option
for many women than conventional hormone therapy.
Furthermore, there may be additional health benefits of treat-
ment with a NK3R antagonist for postmenopausal women.
Cardiovascular disease for example is increased in women after
estrogen levels decline, and there is some evidence that

administering an NK3R antagonist in rats reverses spontaneous
hypertension and lowers heart rate,32 and that this effect is
achieved by reducing midbrain dopaminergic signaling in the
ventral tegmental area that highly expresses NK3R.33 The
NK3R is also present on vasopressin neurons,34 and neurokinin
B activity has been shown to be potentiated by thromboxane
A2.35 This hypothesis would need to be tested in very large
clinical trials that were adequately powered for cardiovascular
endpoints but if possible they could be highly informative, and
offer a novel treatment strategy for a leading cause of mortality
and morbidity.36
CONCLUSIONS
The novel data that we report in this manuscript, which
details the time course of the effect of an NK3R antagonist to
relieve menopausal symptoms and the impact on sleep, fit
entirely with the preexisting literature and are timely as there
is significant interest in the NK3R antagonist class as a future
therapeutic for vasomotor symptoms.37 Larger scale studies
assessing efficacy, safety, and optimal dosing strategy are
already underway. If these studies are also positive and
provide good long-term safety data, then this novel approach
of using NK3R antagonism to treat menopausal flushing will
be practice changing.
