Tobacco Use in Top-Grossing Movies — United States, 2010–2016
Michael A. Tynan1; Jonathan R. Polansky2; Kori Titus3; Renata Atayeva3; Stanton A. Glantz, PhD4
The Surgeon General has concluded that there is a causal 
relationship between depictions of smoking in the movies and 
the initiation of smoking among young persons (1). The more 
youths see smoking on screen, the more likely they are to start 
smoking; youths who are heavily exposed to onscreen smok-
ing imagery are approximately two to three times as likely to 
begin smoking as are youths who receive less exposure (1,2). 
A Healthy People 2020 objective is to reduce the proportion 
of youths exposed to onscreen tobacco marketing in movies 
and television (Tobacco Use Objective 18.3) (3). To assess 
the recent extent of tobacco use imagery in youth-rated mov-
ies (G, PG, PG-13*), 2010–2016 data from Thumbs Up! 
Thumbs Down! (TUTD), a project of Breathe California of 
Sacramento-Emigrant Trails were analyzed and compared with 
previous reports.† In 2016, 41% of movies that were among the 
10 top-grossing movies in any calendar week included tobacco 
use, compared with 45% in 2010. Among youth-rated movies, 
26% included tobacco use in 2016 (including 35% of PG-13 
movies) compared with 31% in 2010 (including 43% of PG-13 
movies). The steady decline in the number of tobacco incidents 
in youth-rated movies from 2005–2010 stopped after 2010. 
The total number of individual occurrences of tobacco use in 
a movie (tobacco incidents) in top-grossing movies increased 
72%, from 1,824 in 2010 to 3,145 in 2016, with an increase 
of 43% (from 564 to 809) occurring among PG-13 rated mov-
ies. Reducing tobacco use in youth-related movies could help 
prevent the initiation of tobacco use among young persons.
TUTD counts occurrences of tobacco incidents, defined as 
the use or implied use of a tobacco product (cigarettes, cigars, 
pipes, hookah, smokeless tobacco products, and electronic 
cigarettes) by an actor, in U.S. top-grossing movies each year. 
Trained monitors count all tobacco incidents in those movies 
that are among the 10 top-grossing movies in any calendar week 
of the year. Previous reports have used this criterion because 
U.S. movies ranked in the 10 top-grossing movies for at least 
1 week have accounted for 96% of U.S. ticket sales (4–6). At 
least two monitors independently evaluate each film; any differ-
ences are resolved by a supervisor who independently watches 
the film using the same protocol. Incidents of implied use have 
been rare and occur when a person is handed or is holding, but 
does not necessarily use, a tobacco product. A new incident 
was counted each time 1) a tobacco product went off screen 
and then came back on screen; 2) a different actor was shown 
with a tobacco product; or 3) a scene changed and the new 
scene contained the use or implied use of a tobacco product.§
* Ratings assigned by the Motion Picture Association of America (a trade
organization that represents the major movie studios) include the following:
General Audiences (G): all ages admitted; Parental Guidance Suggested (PG):
some material might not be suitable for children; Parents Strongly Cautioned
(PG-13): some material might be inappropriate for children under 13; and
Restricted (R): under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.
† https://smokefreemovies.ucsf.edu/.
§ Two common methods used to count smoking incidents in movies are to count 
the number of scenes in which tobacco use occurs or to count the number of
cuts in which tobacco use occurs. Despite the difference in methods, both
metrics have consistent results and are valid for comparing the results across
ratings, years, companies, etc.

To calculate the percentage of movies with tobacco incidents, 
the number of movies with tobacco incidents was divided by 
the total number of movies, and the average number of tobacco 
incidents per movie was calculated for each motion picture 
company. For each year during 2010–2016, the number of 
top-grossing movies with tobacco incidents and overall number 
of tobacco incidents were calculated. Results were also analyzed 
by Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) ratings (G, 
PG, PG-13, R). Findings were also compared with data from 
reports from 1991–2010 (4,5).
In 2016, among 143 top-grossing movies, 59 (41%) had 
tobacco incidents, compared with 62 (45%) of 137 in 2010; 
among top-grossing R-rated movies, 35 (67%) of 52 had 
tobacco incidents in 2016, compared with 35 (71%) of 49 in 
2010 (Table 1). Among youth-rated movies (G, PG, or PG-13), 
24 (26%) of 91 had tobacco incidents in 2016, compared with 
27 (31%) of 88 in 2010. Overall, from 2010 to 2016, the 
number of top-grossing movies with tobacco incidents ranged 
from 58 in 2014 to 76 in 2013 (Table 1).
Although the percentage of top-grossing movies with tobacco 
incidence decreased during 2010–2016, the total number of 
tobacco incidents in top-grossing movies increased by 72%, 
from 1,824 to 3,145 (Table 2). The total number of incidents 
in G or PG movies decreased by 87% (from 30 to 4), whereas 
the number in PG-13 movies increased 43% (from 564 to 
809), and the number in R-rated movies increased 90% (from 
1,230 to 2,332). Compared with previous studies (4,5), smok-
ing incidents had peaked at 3,962 incidents in 2005; the year 
with the lowest number of recorded smoking incidents (1,613) 
was 1998 (Figure). During 2010–2016, the lowest number 
of tobacco incidents (1,743) occurred in 2015; the highest 
number since 2010 (3,145) occurred in 2016, representing 
an 80% increase compared with the previous year. 
Discussion
The findings in this report indicate that although there were 
previously reported declines in the number of youth-rated 
movies with tobacco incidents observed during 2005–2010 
(4,5), since 2010 there has been no progress in reducing the 
total number of tobacco incidents in youth-rated movies. Had 
the trend established from 2005 to 2010 continued, all youth-
rated films would have been smoke-free by 2015. Although 
there were fewer top-grossing movies depicting tobacco use in 
2016 compared with 2010, an increase in the number of such 
incidents occurred, thereby concentrating exposure to tobacco 
use in fewer films. The average number of tobacco incidents 
increased 55% in youth-rated movies with any tobacco depic-
tion, from 22 incidents in 2010 to 34 incidents in 2016, and 
increased 91% in R-rated films with any tobacco depictions, 
from 35 incidents in 2010 to 67 incidents in 2016. Tobacco use 
depictions are now uncommon in G and PG films; however, 
the 43% increase in the total number of tobacco-use incidents 
in PG-13 movies, from 564 in 2010 to 809 in 2016, is of par-
ticular public health concern because of the established causal 
relationship between youths’ exposure to smoking in movies 
and smoking initiation (1).

The six major motion picture companies have policies to reduce 
depictions of tobacco use in youth-rated films,¶ which likely con-
tributed to the reduction in the number of movies with tobacco 
incidents during 2005–2010. TUTD started systematic data col-
lection of onscreen tobacco use in movies in 1991. Occurrences 
of tobacco use in movies varied from 1991 to 2010, reaching a 
peak in 2005 then declining by almost half by 2010 (4,5). Public 
health organizations, investors, state health departments, and state 
attorneys general raised concerns regarding tobacco incidents in 
movies beginning in 2001, which might account, in part, for the 
decrease in onscreen tobacco incidents after 2005 and before major 
motion picture companies adopted policies regarding tobacco 
imagery in youth-rated films (4,5). However, the lack of progress 
in recent years suggests that enhanced measures to address tobacco 
incidents in movies are warranted.
One such intervention would be the assignment of an R rat-
ing to any movie with smoking or other tobacco-use imagery 
(unless the portrayal is of actual historical figures who smoked, a 
documentary, or if the portrayal includes the negative effects of 
tobacco use) (7–9). Other interventions include certifying that 
no payments have been received by the studio or producers for 
depicting tobacco use in the movies and ending the onscreen 
depiction of actual tobacco brands (7,8). These and additional 
interventions, if implemented, could help eliminate tobacco 
incidents in youth-rated movies (7–9). State and local health 
departments could also work with state agencies that manage 
movie subsidies to ensure that such subsidies do not go to films 
that include depictions of tobacco use. During 2010–2016, 
approximately 24 states awarded approximately $3.5 billion in 
public subsidies, such as tax credits, to productions of movies 
with tobacco incidents, including youth-rated movies.**
Currently the MPAA does not assign R ratings to movies 
based on tobacco use incidents. In 2007, the MPAA developed 
a smoking “rating descriptor” that is applied to a few movies 
that contain smoking. These descriptors can appear in fine print 
in the box with the letter rating for a movie and can appear on 
advertisements and promotions to describe the type of content 
in a movie, such as language, violence, nudity, or sexual content. 
However, 89% of top-grossing, youth-rated movies with smok-
ing did not carry the MPAA “smoking descriptor” in 2015 (9).

 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 
684 
MMWR / July 7, 2017 / Vol. 66 / No. 26
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
A longitudinal cohort study of smoking onset among youths 
viewing movies released during 1998–2003 concluded that 
classifying movies with smoking with an R rating could reduce 
the number of teen smokers by approximately 18% (7). The 
Surgeon General notes that the magnitude of the effect of an 
R rating for smoking would be similar to increasing the price 
of cigarettes from $6.00 to $7.50 per pack (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, detailed audience composition data are not publicly 
available; therefore, the number of tobacco use impressions 
(one person seeing one tobacco incident one time, a measure 
of total audience exposure) delivered by a particular movie to 
children and adolescents could not be determined. Second, 
the sample did not include all movies. However, the samples 
of top grossing movies were used because they are expected to 
account for approximately 95% of theater tobacco-use impres-
sions (4–6). Finally, the measure used to assess tobacco exposure 
from movies should be interpreted cautiously because movies 
can be viewed through other channels (e.g., recorded media, 
such as DVDs and Blu-ray; television; and online streaming) 
that do not contribute to the calculation of in-theater impres-
sions. As viewing platforms expand, it is important to identify 
whether youths are being exposed to tobacco imagery through 
other media sources, such as broadcast and cable television, 
on-demand services, and social media. Further research into 
youths’ exposure to tobacco imagery in these and other forms 
of media could also help identify the impact that exposure 
through these sources has on youths’ tobacco use.
If current trends continue, 5.6 million youths who are alive 
today are projected to die from tobacco-related diseases (10). 
Whereas the number of top-grossing movies with tobacco use 
incidents continued to decline from 2010 to 2016, one in four 
youth-rated movies featured tobacco imagery, which is harmful 
to youths and causes youths to start using tobacco. The frequency 
and increase in tobacco incidents in PG-13 movies is of public 
health concern because these movies are rated as appropriate for 
youths. Opportunities exist for movie studios to reduce tobacco 
incidents that appear in youth-related movies, including rating 
films with smoking R, which would help prevent or delay the 
initiation of tobacco use among young persons and prevent 
premature deaths from tobacco-related diseases.
Conflict of Interest
Jonathan R. Polansky, Kori Titus, and Stanton Glantz report 
grants from Truth Initiative during the conduct of this study. 
No other conflicts of interest were reported.

* Ratings are assigned by the Motion Picture Association of America, the trade organization that represents the six major movies studios. G = General Audiences
(all ages admitted); PG = Parental Guidance Suggested (some material may not be suitable for children); PG-13 = Parents Strongly Cautioned (some material may 
be inappropriate for children under 13); and R = Restricted (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The Surgeon General has concluded that there is a causal 
relationship between depictions of smoking in the movies and 
the initiation of smoking among young persons. The more 
frequently youths see smoking on screen, the more likely they 
are to start smoking; youths who are heavily exposed to 
onscreen smoking imagery are approximately two to three 
times more likely to begin smoking than are youths who are 
less exposed.
What is added by this report?
Previously reported declines in number of top-grossing movies 
with tobacco use has continued; however, the decline in the 
total number of tobacco incidents has not progressed since 
2010. From 2010 to 2016, the total number of tobacco incidents 
in top-grossing movies increased, with a 43% increase occurring 
among movies rated PG-13.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Although there were fewer youth-rated films with tobacco 
incidents in 2016 than in 2010, total depictions of tobacco use 
has remained stable, concentrating such exposure in fewer 
films. Reducing tobacco incidents that appear in youth-related 
movies would prevent the initiation of tobacco use among 
young persons. An R rating for movies with tobacco use could 
potentially reduce the number of teen smokers by 18% and 
prevent their premature deaths from tobacco-related diseases.
