Objectives.To evaluate the additional burdens experienced by Texas abortion patients
whose nearest in-state clinic was one of more than half of facilities providing abortion
that had closed after the introduction of House Bill 2 in 2013.
Methods. In mid-2014, we surveyed Texas-resident women seeking abortions in 10
Texas facilities (n = 398), including both Planned Parenthood–affiliated clinics and in-
dependent providers that performed more than 1500 abortions in 2013 and provided
procedures up to a gestational age of at least 14 weeks from last menstrual period. We
compared indicators of burden for women whose nearest clinic in 2013 closed and those
whose nearest clinic remained open.
Results. For women whose nearest clinic closed (38%), the mean one-way distance
traveled was 85 miles, compared with 22 miles for women whose nearest clinic remained
open (P £ .001). After adjustment, more women whose nearest clinic closed traveled
more than 50 miles (44% vs 10%), had out-of-pocket expenses greater than $100 (32% vs
20%), had a frustrated demand for medication abortion (37% vs 22%), and reported that
it was somewhat or very hard to get to the clinic (36% vs 18%; P < .05).
Conclusions. Clinic closures after House Bill 2 resulted in significant burdens for
women able to obtain care. (Am J Public Health. 2016;106:857–864. doi:10.2105/

ince 2010, US states have enacted nearly
300 abortion restrictions, with 51 new
restrictions passed in the first half of 2015
alone.1 Of note is the increase in laws that
make it more difficult to provide abortion
services by imposing expensive or logistically
difficult requirements on facilities and clini-
cians, which are often referred to as Targeted
Regulation of Abortion Provider (TRAP)
laws. In the summer of 2013, Texas passed
House Bill 2 (HB2), a TRAP law that re-
stricted abortion services in 4 ways: (1)
physicians performing abortions must have
admitting privileges at a hospital within 30
miles of the facility, (2) medication abortion
must be administered according to the mif-
epristone label approved by the Food and
Drug Administration (with some dosage
exceptions), (3) most abortions at or after 20
weeks “postfertilization” are banned, and (4)
all abortions must be performed in facilities
meeting the requirements of an ambulatory
surgical center (ASC).2 The first 3 provisions
of HB2 were enforced by November 1, 2013;
the ASC requirement is currently enjoined
pending a US Supreme Court decision, as is
the admitting privileges requirement as it
applies to 2 Texas facilities.
Eight of the 41 Texas facilities providing
abortion care in April 2013 closed or stopped
providing abortion services after the in-
troduction of the HB2 bill.3 Eleven more
facilities closed or stopped providing
abortions when HB2 was enforced, primarily
because physicians experienced barriers to
obtaining hospital admitting privileges.3 Al-
though some clinics were able to reopen once
physicians successfully obtained admitting
privileges, still others closed, resulting in 19
licensed facilities providing abortions in Texas
by July 2014—a 54% reduction in the
number of facilities since April 2013.4
Recent studies have reported the effects of
state-level abortion restrictions on abortion
rates, out-of-state travel for abortion, and the
consequences for women of being denied
a wanted abortion because of clinic gesta-
tional age limits, but less is known about the
burdens that women experience as a result of
clinic closures.5–9 Evaluating the impact of
a substantially reduced number of abortion
clinics in Texas on hardships experienced by
women who are in need of abortion services is
essential to determining the constitutionality
of HB2, as the legal thresholds for abortion
restrictions center upon the magnitude
and nature of these burdens on women.10
However, such an evaluation presents
a number of methodological challenges.
Documenting the experiences of women
who were unable to obtain a wanted abortion
because of insurmountable hardship is diffi-
cult, primarily because those are the very
women who were unable to reach an abor-
tion clinic where they might be enrolled
in a study.11,12 Indeed, the 13% decline in
abortions performed in Texas during the first

 6 months after HB2 went into effect gives an
indication of the law’s impact.3
In addition, HB2 affected women who
were able to obtain an abortion. These
women include those who were directly
affected by the closure of the clinic they
would have used, as well as women whose
nearest or preferred clinic did not close,
but who nevertheless were burdened by
the law through discontinued offering of
medication abortion, longer wait times for
appointment availability, or higher costs
of the procedure at one of the remaining
facilities.
In this study, we assess the impact of HB2
on women who obtained an abortion after
the law was implemented. With survey data
collected from a sample of women who
obtained an abortion in Texas in 2014, we
compared the experiences of women whose
nearest clinic closed with those of women
whose nearest clinicremained open. Through
this comparison, we sought to assess the ad-
ditional burdens experienced by women
whose nearest clinic closed.
METHODS
Between May and August 2014, we sur-
veyed women seeking abortion services in
Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, and San
Antonio. At the time of data collection, the
only open abortion clinics were located in
5 metropolitan statistical areas: Austin, Dallas/
Fort Worth, El Paso, Houston, and San
Antonio. We purposively sampled 10 abor-
tion facilities to include both Planned
Parenthood–affiliated clinics and in-
dependent providers that performed more
than 1500 abortions in 2013 and provided
procedures up to a gestational age of at least
14 weeks from last menstrual period.3 At the
time of data collection, the open clinic in
El Paso did not meet these inclusion criteria.
Between January and April 2014, these study
sites provided 63% of procedures performed
in all Texas abortion facilities open at the
beginning of the data collection period. The
4 metropolitan statistical areas in which we
recruited accounted for 95% of the total
population for all 5 metropolitan statistical
areas with open clinics.
A project coordinator recruited partici-
pants at each site for 3 to 6 days, depending on
clinic schedule and volume. In 9 of the 10
facilities, every woman in the clinic waiting
room was invited to participate in the survey.
At 1 facility, clinic staff invited women to
participate following their initial consult and
interested women were directed to the
project coordinator. Women were eligible to
participate if they were seeking an abortion at
one of the facilities in our study, were aged
18 years or older, spoke English or Spanish,
and had completed their pre-abortion ultra-
sound consultation. Eligible participants
could complete the survey at consultation,
procedure, or follow-up visits. Participants
reviewed and signed a consent form, and
received instructions on how to use an iPad
before completing the self-administered
survey. The survey items were adapted from
a previous study with Texas abortion clients
and used a health care access framework to
assess women’s experiences obtaining abor-
tion care. In addition to questions on socio-
demographic characteristics, reproductive
history, and current pregnancy, the survey
focused on several dimensions of access to
abortion care, including accessibility (distance
to clinics), availability (wait times for services,
type of procedures offered), and affordability
(out-of-pocket costs).13,14 For the purpose of
determining distance traveled, we obtained
zip code of residence. The survey was pre-
tested and professionally translated into
Spanish. After completing the 15-minute
survey, participants received a $20 gift card.
Measures
For our analyses, we distinguished be-
tween participants whose nearest in-state
abortion facility closed following the in-
troduction of HB2 and those whose nearest
facility remained open. For all clinics pro-
viding abortion care in the state, open or
closed status had been previously docu-
mented through interviews conducted
with clinic staff, reports in the press, and
mystery-client calls to abortion facilities.3 We
used 2 benchmark dates to assess the change in
open facilities providing abortion services
before and after HB2: April 2013, before the
Texas legislature’s debate of HB2, and July
2014, the midpoint of study data collection.
We used the clinics’ physical addresses and the
participants’ zip codes of residence to de-
termine the distance to each participant’s
nearest open in-state clinic in April 2013 and
distance to nearest open in-state clinic in July
2014; we also calculated the distance to the
clinic where the participant was interviewed
while seeking abortion care. Distance was
estimated as the number of road miles from
women’s zip codes of residence to each clinic
using Traveltime3, a Stata program that ac-
cesses the Google Maps Distance Matrix
Application Programming Interface to cal-
culate number of miles by road between 2
geographic points (StataCorp LP, College
Station, TX). 15
We calculated mean and median values
for each of the 3 distance measures for the
whole sample, as well as for women whose
nearest clinic in 2013 remained open, and for
women whose nearest clinic had closed, by
July 2014. We also calculated the percentile
distribution of distance traveled to the clinic
where women were interviewed for the
nearest-clinic-open and nearest-clinic-closed
groups. We performed t tests to assess dif-
ferences between these groups.
We also examined the geographical dis-
tribution of the increase in distance to the
nearest clinic in 2014 because this was un-
likely to be evenly distributed across the state.
For all Texas zip codes, we computed the
change in the distance to the nearest in-state
clinic between April 2013 and July 2014,
which we categorized as less than 1 mile, 1 to
24 miles, 25 to 49 miles, 50 to 99 miles, and
100 miles or more. We also plotted the zip
code centroid for each survey participant
whose nearest clinic closed between April
2013 and July 2014, as well as the location of
the open and closed clinics.
In addition to distance traveled, we
identified 4 burdens on access to abortion care
that a woman might have experienced: (1)
high out-of-pocket costs, (2) an overnight
stay, (3) a delay in getting an abortion ap-
pointment, and (4) not obtaining her pre-
ferred type of abortion. For the first indicator,
we aggregated self-reported out-of-pocket
costs associated with getting to the clinic but
not directly associated with the consulta-
tion or procedure visits (i.e., lost wages be-
cause of missing days of work, childcare or
elder-care arrangements, transportation, and
overnight costs).
Participants who spent more than $100 out
of pocket were classified as having high out-
of-pocket costs. Women who reported

 staying or planning to stay overnight because
of the abortion were classified as having an
overnight stay. Participants who answered
“yes” to the question “I scheduled my ap-
pointment later than I would have liked”
were classified as having a delayed appoint-
ment. Participants who reported a preference
for medication abortion before seeking care
but who received or expected to receive
an aspiration abortion were classified as
having frustrated demand for medication
abortion, as we hypothesized that complying
with the 4 required visits would likely impose
less hardship if a clinic were within close
proximity to a participant’s home. Finally,
women who traveled more than 50 miles
(20 miles more than the national average of
30 miles16) from their homes to their abor-
tion clinic were classified as having traveled
a far distance.
We then constructed a summary measure
of the total number of hardships a woman had
experienced. A second summary indicator
capturing the participant’s own perception
of burden came from the survey question:
“Thinking about thetime and travel related to
your visit today, how easy or hard was it to
come to the clinic for this visit?” The response
categories were “very easy,” “somewhat
easy,” “somewhat hard,” and “very hard.”
The final indicator of hardship was the ges-
tational age at the time of the clinic visit based
on ultrasound (as reported by the participant).

Experiences When Nearest Clinic
Closed vs Remained Open
Before we compared measures of hardship
between the nearest-clinic-open and nearest-
clinic-closed groups, we compared women
according to their social and demographic
characteristics as the potential existed for
systematic differences between participants
whose nearest clinic closed and those whose
nearest clinic remained open after HB2. The
individual and household characteristics
available in the survey included age, parity,
race/ethnicity, language, educational attain-
ment, poverty level, student status, relation-
ship status, and whether the participant had
had a previous abortion.
We examined the distributions in each
group, and tested for differences by using
Pearson c2 statistics and 2 sample tests of
proportions. However, even when no sta-
tistical difference exists between groups in
observable characteristics, there may be
confounding. For example, poor women may
have been more likely to have had difficulty
getting to a clinic and also more likely to live
in areas where clinics closed. Alternatively,
among women living in areas where clinics
closed, perhaps only those with higher
incomes and education were able to obtain
abortion services at a more distant clinic. To
select an internally valid comparison group
for women whose nearest clinic closed
after HB2,17,18 we employed an inverse-
probability-weighted regression adjustment
approach to balance observed covariates
across the nearest-clinic-open and nearest-
clinic-closed groups.19
We generated propensity scores to con-
struct the regression weights; although the
propensity score is often defined as the
conditional probability of receiving a treat-
ment or exposure, it also can be applied to
other characteristics of a sample. In this case,
we entered all of the available covariates in-
cluding distance to the nearest clinic open in
2013 linearly into a probit model estimating
the conditional probability that a woman’s
nearest clinic closed. As a check on the
properties of the estimated propensity scores,
we reviewed the overlap and density profiles
of the propensity scores across the nearest-
clinic-closed and nearest-clinic-open groups.
We then performed the inverse probability-
weighted regression adjustment of the mean
outcomes across groups, and estimated the
average treatment effect on the treated—the
mean impact of the closing of clinics on those
who were affected by the closure. This
procedure enjoys the formal property of
being “doubly robust” in the sense that the
estimated effect remains asymptotically
unbiased even if the propensity score model
or the outcome model (but not both) is
misspecified.19–21
We compared the nearest-clinic-open and
nearest-clinic-closed groups with respect to
the individual measures of hardship, as well the
3 summary measures, by using c2 and Wil-
coxon rank sum tests as appropriate. We then
estimated the average treatment effect on the
treated for the individual and summary mea-
sures. All analyses were performed with Stata
version 14.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station,
TX); the map of distance traveled was created
by using ArcGIS 10.3 (Esri, Redlands, CA).
RESULTS
Overall, 439 women completed the sur-
vey. We were unable to calculate a response
rate for the facility where staff recruited
participants (n = 57). At the other 9 sites, 624
women were invited; 64 were ineligible,
primarily because of age or not yet having
completed the ultrasound, and 170 declined
to participate. The primary reasons for de-
clining were lack of time or interest. At these
9 sites, 68% of eligible women participated
(n = 382). We excluded women whose zip
code was not provided or was unidentifiable
(n = 39) and non–Texas residents (n = 2) from
analysis, resulting in a final sample of 398. For
151 participants (38%), the nearest in-state

 abortion clinic to their zip code of residence
that was open in 2013 had closed when they
sought an abortion in 2014. The distribution
of participants according to selected socio-
demographic characteristics is shown in
Table 1. There were no significant differences
in the distributions of any of these variables
between participants whose nearest clinic
had closed and those whose nearest clinic
remained open. Although more than 20%
of respondents did not answer survey
items regarding household income and size,
the proportion missing did not differ between
groups and was included in later modeling.
Clinic Closures and Distance to
Clinics
In 2013, before HB2, the average distance
to the nearest abortion provider among all
participants was 15 miles, with no significant
difference between women whose nearest
clinic remained open and women whose
nearest clinic eventually closed (Table 2). The
average distance to the nearest abortion fa-
cility increased by 20 miles between April
2013 and July 2014, a change that was at-
tributable entirely to an increase in distance
(on average 53 miles) to the nearest clinic
among participants whose nearest clinic
closed after HB2. Among all participants, the
mean one-way distance that women actually
traveled to the clinic where they obtained an
abortion was 46 miles (range = 1 to 381
miles). For women whose nearest clinic
closed, the mean 1-way distance traveled
was 85 miles (median = 35), compared with
22 miles (median = 15) for women whose
nearest clinic did not close (P £ .001). In the
nearest-clinic-closed group, large differences
in distance occurred above the median, as
indicated by the 75th and 90th percentiles
(139 and 256 miles, respectively).
Figure 1 shows how the increase in dis-
tance brought about by clinic closures was
distributed throughout the state. Some re-
spondents, especially those in South and West
Texas, and the Panhandle, experienced
a substantial increase in distance because of
proximity to a clinic in 2013, but living much
farther from an open clinic in 2014. Others
experienced a smaller increase in distance
because the nearest clinic that closed after
HB2 was only marginally closer than the
nearest open clinic in 2014. This was fre-
quently the case for respondents living in the
central, northern, and eastern parts of the
state.
Hardships Experienced in
Obtaining an Abortion
Before adjustment, the proportion of
women having to travel more than 50 miles,
stay overnight, and incur out-of-pocket
expenses in excess of $100 were significantly
greater in the nearest-clinic-closed group
(Table 3). There was also a greater proportion
experiencing frustrated demand for a
medication abortion. There was no
significant difference in the proportion
of women who reported that they

The distribution of the aggregate number
of hardships each woman experienced dif-
fered between the 2 groups, with 24% of
women in the nearest-clinic-closed group
experiencing 3 or more hardships versus 4% in
the nearest-clinic-open group. The mean
number of hardships experienced also differed

differed in their perception of difficulty
accessing abortion care, with 37% in the

somewhat or very hard. Finally, in both

 groups, the majority of participants were
either less than 7 weeks pregnant or between
7 and 9 weeks at their ultrasound appoint-
ment. A larger proportion of women whose
nearest clinic closed had gestations of 10
weeks or more compared with those whose
nearest clinic remained open, but the dif-
ference was only marginally significant.
The inverse-probability-weighted
regression-adjusted estimates of most of these
parameters are similar to the estimates before
correction. The only notable changes are
the slightly smaller difference in the pro-
portion staying overnight and the slightly
larger estimate of the difference in the pro-
portion experiencing frustrated demand for
medication abortion. The trend toward
a difference in gestational age between the
2 groups lost significance after adjustment.
DISCUSSION
Our findings demonstrate a substantial
additional travel burden experienced by
women seeking abortion who live in areas of
Texas where clinics closed after HB2 com-
pared with those living in areas where clinics
remained open. For women in our study
whose nearest abortion clinic closed after
HB2, the average distance to the nearest
abortion provider increased 4-fold, and for
44% of this group, the new distance exceeded
50 miles. The distance women traveled to
obtain their abortion was also 4 times greater
among women whose nearest clinic closed
compared with the distance traveled by
women whose nearest clinic remained open,
and nearly 3 times the average distance (30
miles) traveled in a 2008 national survey of
women seeking abortion.16 In addition, both
before andafter inverse-probability-weighted
regression adjustment, women whose nearest
clinic closed had a higher probability of ex-
periencing hardship, measured in multiple
ways, than women whose nearest clinic
remained open.
The only dimension of hardship in which
there was no significant difference between
the 2 groups was the gestational age at which
women were able to receive abortion care.
This is somewhat inconsistent with our
previous research documenting a small but
significant increase in the proportion of
abortions performed after 12 weeks in the first
6 months after HB2 implementation.3 The
finding here may be because we are un-
derpowered for this outcome; alternatively, it
may be because increases in wait times to get
an appointment affected women regardless of
whether their nearest clinic closed. The in-
formation we have on wait times suggests that
they increased at some clinics, and varied over
time at individual clinics, sometimes in re-
action to the suspension of services at
neighboring clinics.22
These results provide a partial estimate of
the burdens imposed on women by the clinic
closures that followed the introduction and
implementation of HB2, and extend previous
research on the impact of TRAP laws, most
of which has relied on projected or hypo-
thetical analyses of the increases in distance
that would result from anticipated, rather than
actual, clinic closures.3,23 The one previous
study that estimated impact on travel distance
and costs pertained to Texas’s 2003 law re-
quiring that procedures at or after 16 weeks’
gestation be performed in an ASC or hospital.5
In that analysis, the authors documented the
postlaw increase in Texas residents traveling
out of state for abortion procedures at or after
16weeks’gestation,andcalculatedtheincrease
in population-weighted average distance,
for women of reproductive age, to the nearest
provider of abortions at or after 16 weeks’
gestation. In comparison, our analysis used
individual-level data to calculate increases in
distance tothenearestprovider amongwomen
seeking abortions.
Limitations and Strengths
This study has several limitations, the most
important of which is that it cannot provide
a basis for estimating the number of women for
whom the additional burdens imposed by
HB2 were sufficiently great to prevent them
from accessing an abortion that they would
have sought in the absence of clinic closures
and other restrictions. Other research has
documented cases of Texas women whowere
prevented from obtaining desired abortions
because of the closure of nearby clinics as
a result of HB2.4 In addition, recruitment sites
were not selected at random, and our sample
is not representative of women seeking
abortion care in Texas after HB2. Moreover,
our sample does not include Texas residents
who may have traveled out of state for
abortion care, sought abortions in Mexico, or
successfully self-induced abortion after HB2
was enforced.23,24 Finally, our specific
hardship measures do not fully capture the
burden experienced by some women. For
example, women who could not afford an
overnight stay may have opted to travel in the
middle of the night to reach a facility and
return home the same day.
A strength of this study is that we surveyed
women obtaining abortion services more
than 6 months after the enforcement of HB2,
minimizing the possibility that our findings
are solely attributable to the confusion of
sudden or acute changes in services. Also, in
our sample, the women whose nearest clinic
closed were similar to those whose nearest
clinic remained open, and the statistical
procedures we employed to adjust for possible
confounding achieved a remarkable balance
in the observed characteristics of the 2 groups.
Public Health Implications
In a large state, closures of abortion clinics
following the implementation of a TRAP
law can impose a substantial burden on
women seeking abortion care by making
them travel farther, making them spend more
time and money, and causing them to un-
dergo a different kind of procedure from the
one they prefer. These burdens are in addition
to any increase in wait times or costs that
may be spread evenly over all women seeking
abortion care and those that result in making
legal abortion an unattainable option for
some women.
