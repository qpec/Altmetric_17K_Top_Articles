Abstract
Background: Despite a number of studies indicating increased dietary protein needs in bodybuilders with the use of the
nitrogen balance technique, the Institute of Medicine (2005) has concluded, based in part on methodologic concerns, that
‘‘no additional dietary protein is suggested for healthy adults undertaking resistance or endurance exercise.’’
Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the dietary protein requirement of healthy young male bodybuilders (with
$3 y training experience) on a nontraining day by measuring the oxidation of ingested L-[1-13C]phenylalanine to 13CO2 in
response to graded intakes of protein [indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique].
Methods: Eight men (means 6 SDs: age, 22.5 6 1.7 y; weight, 83.9 6 11.6 kg; 13.0% 6 6.3% body fat) were studied at rest on a
nontraining day, on several occasions (4–8 times) each with protein intakes ranging from 0.1 to 3.5 g � kg21 � d21, for a total of 42
experiments. The diets provided energy at 1.5 times each individual�s measured resting energy expenditure and were isoenergetic
across all treatments. Protein was fed as an amino acid mixture based on the protein pattern in egg, except for phenylalanine and
tyrosine, which were maintained at constant amounts across all protein intakes. For 2 d before the study, all participants consumed
1.5 g protein � kg21 � d21. On the study day, the protein requirement was determined by identifying the breakpoint in the F13CO2 with
graded amounts of dietary protein [mixed-effects change-point regression analysis of F13CO2 (labeled tracer oxidation in breath)].
Results: The Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) of protein and the upper 95% CI RDA for these young male
bodybuilders were 1.7 and 2.2 g � kg21 � d21, respectively.
Conclusion: These IAAO data suggest that the protein EAR and recommended intake for male bodybuilders at rest on a
nontraining day exceed the current recommendations of the Institute of Medicine by ;2.6-fold. This trial was registered at
clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02621294.

Introduction
Historically, the dietary protein requirement has been deter-
mined by using nitrogen balance (NB)8 data; however, this
measurement technique has been criticized widely because of a
variety of methodologic concerns (1–4). Two of the main
concerns involve the use of a linear regression line for analyzing
nonlinear data (2, 5) and an over- or underestimation of nitrogen
intake and excretion, respectively (6). Specifically, it has been
suggested that applying a single linear regression line with a
greater residual error is not a good fit for either NB or oxidation
data (5). Interestingly, a bilinear regression model has been used
on the NB results of 28 published studies in which repeated
measurements were made within the same individuals (7), and the

 reported breakpoint within these data for both zero NB and
oxidation of L-[1-13C]phenylalanine with the use of the indicator
amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique was a protein intake of
0.93 g � kg21 � d21 (7), a value that exceeds the current requirement
by >50%. As such, an analysis that locates the breakpoint more
accurately in both NB and oxidation studies may be one key to
determining accurate dietary protein requirements. In addition, the
repeated 7- to 10-d adaptation periods necessary to produce accurate
NB data for each of the several protein intakes needed to determine
the requirement are impractical. Furthermore, the available NB
studies on bodybuilders are limited and quite variable (8–10). As a
result, the current dietary protein recommendation for bodybuilders
varies widely, from the RDA of 0.8 g � kg21 � d21 established by the
Institute of Medicine (11) to as much as 2.0 g � kg21 � d21 (12).
Importantly, it is possible that NB may be achievable at low
protein intakes for the brief study durations often used because
of more efficient amino acid (AA) utilization, reduced turnover
rates, and/or accommodation (13–15). Certainly, this scenario
would be unfavorable for bodybuilders who are attempting to
hypertrophy or even for those simply trying to maintain a
greater-than-typical muscle mass. Finally, even very positive
NB (3.8–20 g/d) with protein intakes of 1.8–2.7 g � kg21 � d21
observed in men engaged in a rigorous strength-training (ST)
program do not result in the expected fat-free mass (FFM)
accrual (8–10). Therefore, the dietary protein needs of body-
builders continues to be a very controversial topic.
Of course, the major goal of bodybuilders is to increase FFM,
which requires that muscle protein synthesis exceed protein
breakdown over time (i.e., a chronic positive protein status).
Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the optimal method to
determine the dietary protein requirement for bodybuilders should
involve an assessment of whole-body protein synthesis. One such
method is the IAAO technique, which is based on the concept that
when dietary protein is inadequate, the oxidation of all AAs,
including the indicator AA, will be substantial. With increasing
dietary protein, oxidation of the indicator AA will decrease
because more AAs are being incorporated into body protein. Once
the dietary requirement is met, there is no further change in the
oxidation of the indicator AA and the resulting ‘‘breakpoint’’ is
thought to be the requirement (4). According to the Institute of
Medicine, the IAAO technique is an acceptable method to assess
protein requirements (11). The purpose of our study was to
quantify the daily dietary protein requirement of young, experi-
enced male bodybuilders with the use of the IAAO technique.
Methods
Participants. Potential study candidates were invited for an interview
via postings at the Western University campus athletic and recreation
center. During these interviews each candidate was informed of the study
procedures, and anyone who participated signed an informed consent
statement previously approved by Western University�s Health Sciences
Research Ethics Board. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) healthy
men between 18 and 40 y of age; 2) $3 y of ST experience, $4 d/wk,
;1 h/d; 3) stable body mass (<4 kg mass gain or loss within the past
6 mo); 4) nonsmoker; 5) intake of <8 g alcohol/d; 6) nonmedication user
(including anabolic steroids); and 7) without allergies to milk or milk
products [because Boost (Nestl´
e) meal replacement and whey protein
isolate were given as part of the experimental diet]. All of the
participants passed the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire health
survey (16) and each had his muscularity assessed on the basis of
published values of Mr. USA winners during the pre-steroid era (1939–
1959) (17). Furthermore, to ensure that only participants near their
respective maximal attainable muscularity were selected, an Index of
Muscularity (percentage) was calculated by using the FFM (kilograms)
of each athlete over the FFM (kilograms) of past Mr. USA winners,
normalized for the height of each participant: Index of Muscularity
(%) = FFM O [height2 3 (25.4 2 [6.1 3 (1.8 – height)])] 3 100 (17).
Only those with an Index of Muscularity $90% were selected. All of the
participants engaged in ST primarily with minimal aerobic activity
(;20 min of walking/wk) in their training routine.
Study design. This study used the minimally invasive (oral infusion)
IAAO technique (18) as described previously in several studies (7, 19–
21). For the prestudy assessment and to prevent any acute effect of
exercise on the measurements, participants abstained from training for
48 h before visiting the laboratory. This is an important consideration
because acute ST exercise can increase rates of muscle protein synthesis
for #48 h (22, 23). Together with the associated relative decrease in
muscle protein breakdown, any measurement on a training day would
therefore be expected to produce an overestimation of the actual protein
requirement.
During this initial visit, which followed a 12-h overnight fast, both
resting energy expenditure (REE) and body composition (FFM and
fat mass) were measured by using open-circuit indirect calorimetry
(Vmax Legacy; Sensor Medics) and air-displacement plethysmography
(BodPod; Life Measurements), respectively. Each dietary protein quan-
tity given was studied over a 3-d period (2 adaptation days followed by
an IAAO study day) (24). During the adaptation days, participants
received Boost meal replacement as a maintenance diet supplemented
with Polycose (Abbot Nutrition) and lactose-free, gluten-free whey
protein isolate (Kaizen Protein) providing 1.5 g protein � kg21 � d21 and
1.7 3 REE on the basis of previous NB studies in ST athletes (8, 9). On
the third day (the IAAO study day), participants arrived after a 12-h fast
and were randomly assigned to receive test protein intakes ranging from
0.1 to 3.5 g � kg21 � d21 and 1.5 3 REE (lesser energy here due to the
largely sedentary measurement day). Four participants were each tested
at 4 protein intakes and 1 participant at each of 5, 6, 7, and 8 protein
intakes for a total of 42 IAAO studies. Each 3-d study period was
separated by $1 wk. Normal training resumed after the completion of
data collection on the IAAO study day, so any training disruption was
minimal.
Study diets. The adaptation and study diets (described above) provided
all of the participant�s macronutrient needs on the basis of the current
DRI. During the 2 adaptation days, the daily diet was consumed as
4 equal meals and participants did not consume any other food items
except for 1 cup of clear tea or coffee and water ad libitum. Participants
were also provided a multivitamin (Centrum; Wyeth Consumer Health
Care) and fiber (RestoraLax; Bayer) supplement daily for the duration
of all studies.
On the third or IAAO study day, participants arrived at the laboratory
after an overnight fast where they consumed 8 hourly isoenergetic meals,
each meal representing one-twelfth of the daily energy requirement. The
study day diet consisted of a protein- and AA-free powder (PDF1; Mead
Johnson),
flavored
drink
crystals
(Tang
and
Kool-Aid;
Kraft
Foods), grape seed oil, a crystalline AA mixture (Ajinomoto Amino
Science LLC) patterned after egg protein (Table 1), and protein-free
cookies. The carbohydrate content of the diets was adjusted on the basis
of the protein to keep the diets isoenergetic.
Tracer protocol. An oral priming dose of 0.176 mg NaH13CO3/kg body
mass (99 atom percent excess; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and
0.66 mg L-[1-13C]phenylalanine/kg started with the fifth hourly meal. In
addition, a dose of L-[1-13C]phenylalanine (1.2 mg � kg21 � h21) was
started with the fifth meal and continued hourly for the remaining 3 h of
the study. The quantity of L-[1-13C]phenylalanine supplied during the
last 4 h of the study was subtracted from the diet to provide a total intake
of 25 mg phenylalanine � kg21 � d21, and tyrosine was provided at
40 mg � kg21 � d21 to ensure an excess of both (25, 26).
Sample collection and analysis. During each study day, 3 baseline
breath and urine samples were collected at 45, 30, and 15 min before the
tracer protocol began; and 5 total breath and urine samples were
collected, 1 every 30 min, beginning at 2.5 h after administration of the

 tracer (L-[1-13C]phenylalanine) in order to establish that an isotopic
steady state was attained. Breath samples were collected in disposable
Exetainer tubes (Labco) with a collection mechanism (Easy-Sampler;
Quintron) that permitted the removal of dead-space air. Breath samples
were stored at room temperature, and urine samples were stored at 220�C
until analysis. During each study day, the rate of carbon dioxide
production was measured immediately after the fifth meal for a period
of 20 min with an indirect calorimeter (Vmax Legacy).
Expired 13CO2 enrichment was measured with a continuous-flow
isotope ratio mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS 20/20 isotope analyzer; PDZ
Europa). Enrichments were expressed as atom percent excess compared
with a reference standard of compressed carbon dioxide. Urinary
L-[1-13C]phenylalanine enrichment was analyzed by an API 4000 triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex) in
positive electrospray ionization mode (19). Isotopic enrichment was
expressed as mole percent excess and calculated from peak area ratios at
isotopic steady state, both at baseline and at plateau.
Estimation of isotope kinetics. L-[1-13C]Phenylalanine kinetics were
calculated by using the stochastic models described previously (27).
Isotopic steady state in the tracer enrichment at baseline and plateau was
represented as unchanging values of L-[1-13C]phenylalanine in urine and
13CO2 in breath.
Phenylalanine flux (mmol � kg21 � h21) was calculated from the dilution
of the orally administered L-[1-13C]phenylalanine into the metabolic pool
(at steady state) by using the enrichment of L-[1-13C]phenylalanine in
urine. The rate of appearance of 13CO2 in breath (F13CO2 mmol � kg21 � h21)
after the oxidation of ingested L-[1-13C]phenylalanine was calculated
according to the model of Matthews et al. (28) by using a factor of
0.82 to account for carbon dioxide retained in the body�s bicarbonate
pool.
Statistical analysis. All of the results are reported as means 6 SDs.
Statistical analyses were performed by using SAS (version 9.2.1; SAS
Institute). Significance was set at P # 0.05. Participants were assigned
randomly to differing protein intakes with protein quantity as the
independent variable. The effect of protein intake on phenylalanine flux,
oxidation, and F13CO2 was tested by using a mixed linear model (PROC
MIXED) with subject as a random variable. The mean protein
requirement was estimated by applying a nonlinear mixed-effects model
(PROC NLMIXED; SAS Institute) to the F13CO2 data (19). Observa-
tions within subjects were regarded as statistically dependent. CIs were
obtained by following the standard asymptotic theory of the maximal
likelihood estimation. The model minimizing the Akaike information
criterion was regarded as the model with the best fit (29). The following
statistical model was used, accounting for correlations within observa-
tions from the same subject:
Yid ¼ b0 þ bi þ b1I
�
xid > xcp
��
xid 2 xcpÞ þ 3id
ð1Þ
where Yid = F13CO2 or phenylalanine oxidation at the dose of the protein
of i, xid is the dose amount of the test protein intake of the ith participant,
3id are random errors that are independently normally distributed with a
mean of 0 and variance of s2, b0 is the left line intercept, bi is the random
intercept that incorporates within-subject correlation, b1I is the left line
slope, xcp is the breakpoint, and the slope for xid is 0 for xid more than
breakpoint. Comparisons between results of the 2 studies presented in
Table 4 were made by using a t test with P < 0.05.
Results
Participant characteristics. Eight male bodybuilders ($3 y of
consistent STexperience, $4 d/wk, ;1 h/d with minimal aerobic
activity in their training, ;20 min/wk) participated in the study.
All were noncompeting natural (i.e., without steroids) body-
builders. The normalized Index of Muscularity for the respective
height of each participant was $90% (95.9% 6 5.2%) that of
past Mr. USA winners (Table 2) or ;16 kg more FFM than
healthy young non-bodybuilders of similar height in a previous
IAAO study (7). Habitual protein intake on the basis of 3-d

RDA).
Phenylalanine flux. Phenylalanine flux was not affected within
each athlete by the different protein intakes (P = 0.35) as
required by the IAAO method (Table 3). This provides evidence
that the precursor pool for the IAAO method did not change
significantly with increasing test protein intakes and suggests
that the changes in oxidation were proportional inversely to
whole-body protein synthesis. Whole-body phenylalanine flux
was 67.4 6 3.8 mmol � kg21 � h21.

oxidation.
Nonlinear mixed-effects
change-point regression analysis of the F13CO2 data resulted in a
breakpoint at a protein intake of 1.7 g � kg21 � d21, that is, the rate
of 13CO2 released from the oxidation of L-[1-13C]phenylalanine
(F13CO2) declined in response to increasing protein intakes up to
1.7 g � kg21 � d21 (Figure 1), such that additional increases in
protein intake did not result in changes in F13CO2 values. This
means that the incorporation of the phenylalanine for protein
synthesis reached a plateau at a protein intake of 1.7 g � kg21 � d21
(r2 = 0.67) and indicates that this is the mean dietary
requirement of these bodybuilders. The upper 95% CI of the
breakpoint was at 2.2 g � kg21 � d21, suggesting that the RDA for
protein of male bodybuilders should be near this intake. The
lower CI was 1.2 g � kg21 � d21.
Discussion
In this study, we sought to assess protein requirements at the
whole-body level in individuals who had undergone regular
bodybuilding training for years. Specifically, we measured
resting oxidation of L-[1-13C]phenylalanine on a nontraining
day for a range of protein intakes above and below the current
protein requirement as a reverse proxy for whole-body protein
synthesis. This relation has been confirmed previously both in
animal and in human studies (30, 31). Basically, as dietary
protein intake increases, the rate of
L-[1-13C]phenylalanine
oxidation decreases, eventually reaching a plateau at the
requirement; here at 1.7 g � kg21 � d21. By using these data, the
estimated RDA for our bodybuilders would be ;2.2 g � kg21 � d21
(Figure 1), which is ;2.6-fold greater than the current RDA for
protein (11).
On the basis of NB data, the Institute of Medicine defines
the protein requirement to be the minimal estimate to replace
losses and prevent nutrient deficiency (11). Presumably, the
protein requirement for bodybuilders who are attempting to
build or maintain a much greater-than-typical FFM would be
more related to the minimum intake necessary to maximize
whole-body protein synthesis (anabolism) for the repair and
remodeling processes necessary to induce maximal muscle
growth (hypertrophy). Muscle hypertrophy occurs when muscle
protein synthesis exceeds muscle protein breakdown (32, 33)
and for it to be substantial it requires that both protein and
energy balances remain positive chronically. Earlier stable
isotope studies (14, 15, 34, 35) assessing either protein or AA
requirements identified 4 different states of protein metabolism: 1)
‘‘protein deficiency,’’ defined as the maximal reduction in
protein synthesis to all but the essential organs; 2) ‘‘accommo-
dation,’’ in which balance is achieved via a decrease in
physiologic relevant processes; 3) ‘‘adaptation,’’ in which
optimal growth, interorgan AA exchange, and immune function
are present; and 4) ‘‘excess,’’ which is characterized by AA
oxidization for energy and nitrogen excretion via urea, resulting
in no further stimulation of protein synthesis (15). Moreover, it
is known that regardless of age, when protein intakes near the
current RDA are combined with ST, accommodation results
through increased nitrogen utilization efficiency and lower
whole-body protein synthesis rates rather than adaptation (9,
34, 36). This likely is not ideal for optimal muscle growth.
Rather, bodybuilders should be in the adaptation state, so
determining the protein intake that corresponds to a plateau in
whole-body protein synthesis is critical for them.
Typically, bodybuilders report much greater protein intakes
than their inactive peers, and previous NB studies for this
subgroup of athletes (8, 9, 11, 12) measured a protein require-
ment and RDA of ;1.4 and 2.0 g � kg21 � d21, respectively.
Interestingly, the habitual protein intake of bodybuilders has
been reported to be ;2–4 g � kg21 � d21, depending on training

 phase (37–39). Further support that bodybuilders can benefit
from dietary protein in excess of the current RDA comes from a
meta-analysis of 680 ST (>6 wk) young (23 6 3 y) as well as
older (62 6 6 y) individuals, because receiving a supplement of
50 6 32 g protein/d in addition to a regular dietary intake of
;1.2 g � kg21 � d21 (daily protein intake of ;1.8 g � kg21 � d21)
increased skeletal muscle mass and strength gains (40). More-
over, Snijders et al. (41) recently found that 3 mo of ST with a
daily protein intake of 1.9 compared with 1.3 g � kg21 � d21
resulted in increased skeletal muscle mass, strength, and muscle
fiber size in young men (aged 22 6 1 y). However, the rate of
muscle mass gain decreases with training experience, and these
data were from less-experienced ST athletes so they may not be
directly comparable to our experienced bodybuilders. Further-
more, it is also difficult to compare our results with previous
studies (8–10) because critical determinants of protein require-
ments (i.e., training experience, training intensity, and muscu-
larity) varied (32, 42). For example, NB studies on novice (#1 y
training experience) (8, 9) and elite ($3 y training experience)
bodybuilders (10) observed protein requirements of 1.4 and
0.82 g � kg21 � d21, respectively. This 71% greater protein need in
novice compared with elite bodybuilders was attributed, at least
in part, to a greater rate of muscle mass accrual in novices (8, 9).
To control for these variables, the men in our study were required
to have trained rigorously and consistently for at least the
previous 3 y and to be close to their maximal natural (i.e., without
steroids) muscularity (90–100%) on the basis of published data of
pre–steroid era Mr. USA winners (17). At present, no true marker
of maximal muscularity exists, so it is possible that our
bodybuilders may have still been adding FFM, albeit at a reduced
rate in comparison to novices (i.e., certainly <4 kg mass gain in
6 mo, the criterion used for inclusion in this study).
Regardless, our study is the first, to our knowledge, to assess the
protein requirement in experienced male bodybuilders with the use
of the IAAO technique, and the results indicate that the protein
requirement and RDA should be ;1.7 and 2.2 g � kg21 � d21,
respectively (Figure 1), which is ;23% greater than the results
reported previously for bodybuilders with the use of the NB
method (8, 9). Interestingly, this is consistent with published
reports of the protein requirement for sedentary individuals with
the use of the IAAO technique, in that those data also exceeded
the published NB protein requirement set by the Institute of
Medicine by ;30–40% (7, 20, 21, 43).
Although of similar height and age to our current partici-
pants, the individuals in the previous IAAO studies were
sedentary (7, 24) (Table 4) and therefore, not surprisingly,
had a much lower body mass (;16 kg less FFM). Of course, to
accrue FFM, a chronic positive protein and energy balance is
necessary and is consistent with the observed 1.8 times greater
protein requirement for our male bodybuilders (Table 4).
Furthermore, whole-body phenylalanine flux in the fed state at
rest was ;15% or 1.1 times greater (P = 0.02) in our
bodybuilders than in their sedentary counterparts, which also
agrees with the results reported previously comparing whole-
body flux between ST and sedentary young men (9, 44). When
compared relative to FFM, this difference was only 6% and was
nonsignificant (Table 4). In contrast, despite differing metho-
dology, training experience, and protein intakes used, there are
studies that showed no change or even a reduction in whole-
body protein flux as a result of ST (45, 46). Furthermore, it is
well known that muscle protein synthesis can be elevated for 24–
48 h after exercise (22, 47). Moreover, the time course and
magnitude of any increase in whole-body protein flux and
synthesis can vary depending on the training status of the
individual (23). Together, these factors could explain the
variable results in whole-body flux measured <24 h after a ST
session between studies.
Our observed 1.1-fold increase in whole-body phenylalanine
flux is less than the observed 1.8-fold measured increase in
protein requirement (Table 4). Given that the muscle contribu-
tion to the whole-body protein flux is estimated at ;30% (48), it
is likely that a concomitant accommodative response occurred
elsewhere (i.e., a reduction in non–muscle tissue protein synthesis
and flux). Whether this possibility is correct requires further
investigation.
Relative to the debate regarding protein requirements of
bodybuilders, our observations could mean that NB data tend to

CI was 1.2 g � kg21 � d21.

 underestimate protein requirements due to inaccuracies inherent
in the NB method (9) and/or because of the single linear
regression model used traditionally rather the more appropriate
biphase linear regression model (7), as mentioned. For example,
the very-positive observed NB (;12–20 g N/d) at a protein
intake of 2.8 g � kg21 � d21 (10) should produce ;300–500 g lean
mass gain/d, which was not observed. Of course, determining
dietary protein requirements with NB is problematic under the
best of conditions (1, 2, 4, 11) and perhaps even more so with
bodybuilders (8, 42).
Alternatively, it is possible that IAAO data overestimate
protein requirements; however, in general, isotope tracer meth-
odology is considered to be a far more accurate technique (8, 9,
34, 49) yet not without its own controversy (50). As discussed,
the IAAO technique identifies the plateau in AA oxidation that
corresponds to the maximum rate of whole-body protein
synthesis. However, because we studied bodybuilders who had
undergone regular ST for years to induce muscle hypertrophy,
whereas the earlier IAAO protein requirement data were for
sedentary individuals, it is important to appreciate potential
factors that might confound our data. For example, we used a
protein intake of 1.5 g � kg21 � d21 during the 2 prestudy
adaptation days on the basis of the guidelines of the Academy of
Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the American
College of Sport Medicine (12) from previous NB data in
exercising individuals (8, 9). Although greater than the current
RDA by ;76%, some might speculate that this protein intake
could affect our measures because it is still lower than the habitual
protein intake of our participants (2.4 6 0.8 g � kg21 � d21). We
believe that this is unlikely because it has been shown that
habitual protein intakes do not alter protein or AA requirements
as determined with the IAAO technique (24, 51, 52). Other
possible confounders include the timing of the measures relative
to training sessions because muscle protein synthesis is elevated
for 24–48 h after exercise (22, 47) and because a discordant
decreased muscle protein breakdown relative to muscle protein
synthesis with ST is believed to be the driving force for the
observed hypertrophy (53). Consequently, measures on a training
day could differ from those on a nontraining day. Consistent with
this possibility are the recent IAAO data indicating that, after an
acute endurance exercise bout, a greater protein intake is required
to maximize whole-body protein synthesis than that observed while
at rest, at least in endurance-trained rodents (54). Consequently, to
avoid this possible confounder, which incidentally would be
expected to elevate protein requirements, we measured the dietary
protein requirement at rest in the fed state 48 h after the previous ST
bout. Of course, traditional protein requirement measurements are
completed in the resting state when whole-body protein synthesis is
expected to match daily whole-body protein breakdown. Finally, the
brief cessation of training for the IAAO study days is not unusual for
bodybuilders because ST is conducted typically with a few rest days
per week. Basically, we were interested in the effect of chronic STon
protein requirements and did not want to include any confounding
effects of acute exercise. As mentioned, similar measures on an ST
day would be expected to increase requirements even further and
are certainly of interest but must await further study. Finally, it is
common for IAAO studies to provide small hourly aliquots of a
liquid meal to induce an isotopic steady state (only a mild state of
hyperaminoacidemia and hyperinsulinemia relative to large meals)
(55). This approach could underestimate the anabolic effect of
feeding (56, 57) and, as a result, influence protein requirement
estimates.
However,
previous
work
that
used
this
feeding
methodology investigating fed-state leucine kinetics provided
reasonable estimates of 24-h leucine oxidation (55, 58, 59), and
there is considerable evidence in young adults that protein-feeding
patterns (pulse compared with spread patterns) have little influence
on whole-body protein balance (60, 61). Most important, 2 current
IAAO studies (62, 63) that used whole food (intact protein) and a
bolus feeding pattern found protein requirement estimates similar
to those determined by using an AA mixture and hourly feeding (7).
Moreover, a comparison between fed-state measurement of AA
requirements by IAAO and the 24-h IAAO balance technique (both
fed and fasted states) produced similar estimates (64). Conse-
quently, we believe our data reflect the protein requirements of
experienced bodybuilders.
In summary, we used the IAAO technique to assess the viability
of the current dietary protein requirements for male bodybuilders
on a nontraining day. Our IAAO protein requirement data exceed
the current Estimated Average Requirement and RDA by ;2.6-
fold. Importantly, criticisms of this methodology (50, 65) have
been addressed previously (19, 21), yet one might still question
whether the results of a short-term IAAO study can be translated
into the long-term desired adaptations in athletes. Although such
data will best come from longitudinal ST experiments, there is
evidence that enhanced performance and greater increases in
muscle mass occur among ST participants with protein intakes
greater than the RDA, at least early in a training program (8, 39,
40). Much less information exists for individuals who have
trained for years. Clearly, the controversy over protein require-
ments in physically active individuals will continue and may even
require novel methodologies to be resolved once and for all (50).
Going forward, it is important to appreciate that, although
protein requirements are increased for bodybuilders, so too are
those of both carbohydrate and fat (12). For both optimal
performance and health, it is important to adjust macronutrient
intake within the constraints of total daily energy requirements.
In conclusion, our IAAO data are consistent with earlier NB
findings that suggest that chronic ST increases dietary protein
needs and, in addition, indicate that, at least in bodybuilders
with greater-than-typical FFM, protein requirements measured
on a nontraining day exceed the current RDA. Therefore, on
the basis of these data, we believe that, at least in the case of
individuals who engage in bodybuilding exercise chronically,
the conclusion of the Institute of Medicine (11) that ‘‘no
additional dietary protein is suggested for healthy adults
undertaking resistance or endurance exercise’’ needs to be
reassessed.
