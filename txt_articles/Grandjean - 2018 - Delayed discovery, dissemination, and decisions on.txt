Delayed discovery, dissemination, and
decisions on intervention in environmental
health: a case study on immunotoxicity of
perfluorinated alkylate substances
Philippe Grandjean1,2
Abstract
Identification and characterization of environmental hazards that impact human health must rely on the best possible
science to inform and inspire appropriate public health intervention. The perfluorinated alkylate substances (PFASs) are
persistent emerging pollutants that are now being recognized as important human health hazards. Although the
PFASs have been produced for over 60 years, academic research on environmental health aspects has appeared only
in the most recent 10 years or so. In the meantime, these persistent chemicals accumulated in the global environment.
Some early studies e.g., on population exposures and toxicity, were not released to the public until after year 2000. Still,
the first PFAS risk assessments ignored these reports and relied on scant journal publications. The first guidelines and
legal limits for PFAS exposure, e.g., from drinking water, were proposed 10 years ago. They have decreased
substantially since then, but remain higher than suggested by data on human adverse effects, especially on
the immune system, that occur at background exposure levels. By now, the best-known PFASs are being
phased out, and related PFASs are being introduced as substitutes. Given the substantial delays in discovery of
PFAS toxicity, in dissemination of findings, and in regulatory decisions, PFAS substitutes and other persistent industrial
chemicals should be subjected to prior scrutiny before widespread usage.
Late emergence of early evidence
Industrial chemicals are often regarded inert or safe, un-
less proven otherwise, i.e., the so-called “untested chemi-
cals assumption,” although this belief is of course not
logical [1, 2]. A high-priority group of environmental che-
micals, the perfluorinated alkylate substances (PFASs),
constitute a clear example how narrow reliance on pub-
lished toxicity studies can be misleading and result in in-
sufficient and delayed protection of public health [3]. New
insight on PFAS immunotoxicity shows that the path from
discovery of toxicity to decisions on intervention can be
stalled for decades (Table 1).
After the beginning of commercial PFAS production
in the 1950s, a brief review article from 1980 [4] for the
first time mentioned industry-sponsored studies, some
of which were carried out in monkeys. Perfluorooctanoic
acid (PFOA) showed specific toxicity to the reticuloen-
dothelial system (i.e. immune system) [5]. In this 90-day
study, compound-related microscopic lesions were seen
in bone marrow, spleen and lymph nodes, thus clearly
suggesting immunotoxicity, although functional tests
were not carried out. A parallel study on perfluoroocta-
noic sulfonic acid (PFOS), also from 1978, was aborted
due to mortality of the monkeys at all doses (the lowest
being 10 mg/kg/day) [6]. These two internal reports
were eventually shared with the U.S. Environmental Pro-
tection Agency (EPA) in 2000 [7] and then became ac-
cessible to the public.
A medical thesis from 1992 mentioned the evidence
from the monkey study and noted: “No follow-up studies
of these observations have been reported” [8]. The thesis
analyzed clinical examination data from PFOA produc-
tion workers and found clear associations between in-
creased PFAS concentrations in the blood and decreased

 leukocyte counts. The results were not reported in a
scientific journal. However, in connection with a re-
cent law suit, a draft manuscript on this study has
been released (“Peripheral blood lymphocyte count in
men
occupationally
exposed
to
perfluorooctanoic
acid” [9]). The draft concluded: “PFOA is associated
with alterations in peripheral blood lymphocyte num-
bers in PFOA production workers, suggesting that
cell-mediated immunity may be affected by PFOA”.
Other company materials outlined in an expert report
include the comment “We’re working with [the au-
thor] regarding some of the wording” [10]. Evidently,
an agreement was not reached, and the findings were
not published.
Human exposure to organofluorine compounds was
discovered as early as 1968 [11] and was later con-
firmed in a more extensive study [12]. However, the
exact identity and the sources were unknown at the
time. Soon thereafter, PFASs were identified in blood
from production workers, and in 1981 also in umbil-
ical cord blood at a female worker’s childbirth [13].
Although the latter finding signified placental passage
and prenatal PFAS exposure, this observation was not
revealed until 20 years later, after which it was soon
confirmed in a larger study [14]. Of additional public
health significance, an unpublished study on goats
from 1993 showed that PFOS was transferred into
milk [10], and this pathway was verified in humans,
again many years later [15].
New insight into a hidden hazard
By about 2000, the widespread occurrence and persist-
ence of PFASs in the environment became known [7], as
reflected also by the presence of PFASs in serum sam-
ples from blood banks [16]. Only after this time, and es-
pecially during the most recent 10 years, did the
scientific literature on PFASs expand (Fig. 1) [17]. Im-
mune system deficits in PFOA-exposed mice were at
first observed in studies of peroxisome proliferator acti-
vation [18]. Later, experimental studies of PFOS showed
reductions in lymphoid cell numbers and de novo anti-
body synthesis [19], and a study in mice from 2009 dem-
onstrated that PFOS exposure reduced the survival after
influenza A infection [20]. Then followed in vitro evi-
dence of adverse effects in human white blood cells [21].
Although the 1978 monkey study [5] could have been
obtained from the U.S. EPA, none of these studies re-
ferred to these original findings.
Important evidence emerged after the discovery of
PFAS contamination in the Mid-Ohio River Valley and

 the court-mandated health examinations [22]. In regard
to immunotoxicity, an interim report showed that in-
creased PFOA exposure was associated with changes in
serum concentrations of immunoglobulins [23]. A more
focused study determined antibody responses to flu vac-
cination [24]. Elevated serum-PFOA concentrations were
associated with a reduced antibody titer rise, particularly
to an A influenza virus strain, with an increased risk of
not attaining the antibody level needed to provide
long-term protection. A later study on 12 adult volun-
teers with background exposures showed that two of the
subjects failed to respond to a tetanus-diphtheria booster
and that the steepness of the antibody responses was
negatively associated with the serum-PFAS concentra-
tions [25]. Cross-sectional data have also suggested
lower vaccination antibody concentrations at elevated
background PFAS exposures [26].
The first prospective study assessing children’s anti-
body responses to routine childhood immunizations re-
ported in 2012 that a doubling in exposure to PFOS and
PFOA was associated with an overall decrease by up to
50% in the specific vaccine antibody concentration [27,
28]. When mutually adjusted, the regression coefficients
for PFOA and PFOS changed only little [27]. Booster
vaccine responses in children at age 5 years were lower
at elevated serum-PFAS concentrations [28, 29]. A
smaller Norwegian study of about 50 children aged
3 years also showed tendencies toward lower vaccination
antibody concentrations at higher exposures during
pregnancy [30]. As PFASs are now known to be trans-
ferred to the infant via human milk [31], it seems likely
that PFAS exposures in early infancy represent a particu-
lar hazard to the adaptive immune system [32]. If true,
the routine modeling of lifetime exposures for risk as-
sessment is inappropriate, as it ignores the presence of
vulnerable time windows.
PFAS exposure can also impact the body’s ability to
fight off common infections, such as colds and gastro-
enteritis, as seen in the Norwegian study [30]. A larger,
prospective study in Denmark found that increased ma-
ternal serum concentrations of PFOA and PFOS were
significantly associated with a higher frequency of fever
and symptoms in the children [33], in agreement with a
subsequent study from Japan that relied on retrospective
assessment of the disease incidence [34]. In contrast, a
substudy from the Danish National Birth Cohort exam-
ined the hospitalization rates for a variety of infections,
such as airway infection, middle ear infection, and ap-
pendicitis, through to age 11 years and showed no asso-
ciation with PFOS and PFOA in early pregnancy serum
from the mother [35]. However, a recent report from the
project team raised doubt about the validity of the PFAS
analyses [36].
Delayed interventions
Despite the support from both experimental and epi-
demiological data [37], most regulatory risk assessments
of PFASs have focused on other target organs and have

 emphasized toxicity testing in rodents [4]. The first
opinion from the European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA) in 2009 [38] listed a single report on immuno-
toxicity under “Other endpoints”. That same year, the
EPA issued provisional health advisories and concluded
that “epidemiological studies of exposure to PFOA and
adverse health outcomes in humans are inconclusive at
present” [39]. Neither report referred to the 1978 mon-
key study that had become available in 2000. Early and
more recent guidelines and recommended limits for
PFOS and PFOA are shown in Table 2.
The EPA prepared more detailed risk assessment re-
ports for PFOA and PFOS in 2014 [40, 41]. These drafts
conclude that the two major PFASs exhibit immunotoxi-
city in experimental models and that the epidemiological
evidence is additive, although mixed exposures compli-
cate the attribution of effects to specific PFASs. A simi-
lar conclusion was reached by an ATSDR ToxProfile on
the perfluoroalkyls in 2015 [42]. The coverage of human
immunotoxicity was very brief, and no mention of this
potential was made in the sections on public health im-
plications. Although the monkey studies were cited, the
risk assessment reports did not refer to the 1992 study
of exposure-associated immune cell abnormalities in
workers.
More
recently,
the
National
Toxicology
Program
(NTP) in 2016 reviewed the immunotoxicity information
on PFOS and PFOA and concluded that both are “pre-
sumed” to constitute immune hazards to humans [37].
The term “presumed” is the strongest below “known” in
the NTP vernacular. Both PFASs suppress the antibody
response in animal studies, while the evidence in
humans is “moderate”, as all studies are observational
(not experimental) and refer to mixed PFAS exposures.
The revised ATSDR ToxProfile [43] just released con-
cluded that decreased antibody response to vaccines is a
potential outcome from exposure to all five PFASs com-
monly found in human blood samples. However, ATSDR
stopped short of using epidemiology evidence for deriv-
ation of exposure limits.
Regulatory agencies frequently use benchmark dose
calculations as a basis for generating exposure limits
[38]. This approach relies on fitting a dose-response
function to the data, and the benchmark dose (BMD) is
defined as the dose that leads to a specific loss (or de-
gree of abnormality) known as the benchmark response
(BMR) in the outcome variable. The lower one-sided
95% confidence limit of the BMD is the benchmark dose
level (BMDL), which is used as the point of departure
for calculation of exposure limits. Relying on the vaccine
antibody responses, BMDLs for PFOS and PFOA were
calculated in 2013 to be about 1 μg/L serum [44], i.e.,
levels that are exceeded by a majority of the general
population [45]. However, at first, these results were dis-
regarded because of the absence of an unexposed con-
trol group [42], a condition that would be impossible to
meet. Another concern was the high correlation between
exposure components, such as PFOA and PFOS [40, 41,
43]. Still, mutual adjustment is possible and shows clear
negative impacts of both of these major PFASs on im-
mune system responses [27], and other calculations
show virtually unchanged BMDLs for PFOA and PFOS
after such adjustment [46].
In an updated opinion on PFOS and PFOA [47], EFSA
used separate BMD calculations for several outcomes in
humans, including immunotoxicity, relying on summary
data in deciles or quartiles. For the vaccine response
data [28], EFSA assumed that all subjects in the lowest
decile exposure group had the same exposure, and the
BMDs were similar to the average serum concentration
in that group. For this reason, EFSA’s calculated BMDs
are several fold higher than the ones obtained from the
continuous dose-effect relationship [44]. Still, the new
tolerable intake limits are substantially lower than other
published guidelines (Table 2), though quite similar to
the Minimal Risk Levels developed by ATSDR [43].
The “untested chemicals assumption”, as highlighted
by the National Research Council [1] has clearly been in-
appropriately relied upon in past risk assessments of
PFASs, and these substances must now be added to the
list of environmental hazards [48] where standard risk
assessment has failed. As a major reason, early evidence
on PFAS toxicity was kept secret for 20 years or more,
and even after its release, it was apparently overlooked.
A related reason is the absence of academic PFAS

 research on the immune system and other sensitive tar-
get organs until about 10 years ago. Further, regulatory
agencies relied on experimental toxicity studies and dis-
regarded emerging epidemiological evidence. As a result,
even some of the current guidelines are orders of magni-
tude above exposure levels at which associations with
adverse effects have been reported.
The PFASs therefore constitute an unfortunate ex-
ample that risk assessment may be inappropriate to as-
sess human health risks from chemical exposures when
crucial documentation has not yet been published. Rec-
ognizing the weaknesses of conventional risk assessment,
scientists from the U.S. EPA recently recommended to
consider the full range of available data and to include
health endpoints that reflect the range of subtle effects
and morbidities in humans [48]. The present summary
of delayed discovery, dissemination and decision-making
on the PFASs indicates that a more comprehensive as-
sessment of adverse health risks is urgently needed and
that PFAS substitutes, as well as other persistent indus-
trial chemicals, should not be considered innocuous in
the absence of relevant documentation [49].
Conclusions
Early research on environmental PFAS exposures and
their health implications became available at a substan-
tial delay and was not taken into account in initial regu-
latory decisions on exposure abatement. Only in the last
10 years or so has environmental health research fo-
cused on the PFASs and revealed important human
health risks, e.g., to the immune system. Although
guideline values for PFASs in drinking water have de-
creased over time, they remain too high to protect
against such toxicity. While the most commonly used
PFASs will remain in the environment for many years,
new PFAS substitutes are being introduced, although lit-
tle information on adverse health risks is available. Given
the serious delays in the discovery of PFAS toxicity, their
persistence in the environment, and their public health
impact, PFAS substitutes and other persistent industrial
chemicals should be subjected to prior research scrutiny
before widespread usage.
