Case Report:
Induced Lactation in a Transgender Woman
Tamar Reisman1,2,* and Zil Goldstein1
Abstract
Objective: Our report describes a case of nonpuerperal induced lactation in a transgender woman.
Methods: We present the relevant clinical and laboratory findings, along with a review of the relevant literature.
Results: A 30-year-old transgender woman who had been receiving feminizing hormone therapy for the past 6
years presented to our clinic with the goal of being able to breastfeed her adopted infant. After implementing a
regimen of domperidone, estradiol, progesterone, and breast pumping, she was able to achieve sufficient breast
milk volume to be the sole source of nourishment for her child for 6 weeks. This case illustrates that, in some
circumstances, modest but functional lactation can be induced in transgender women.

History of Present Illness
A 30-year-old transgender woman presented to clinic
seeking help to achieve her goal of breastfeeding. She
explained that her partner was pregnant but not inter-
ested in breastfeeding, and that she hoped to take on
the role of being the primary food source for her infant.
The patient’s medical history was significant for gender
incongruence for which she initiated a feminizing hor-
mone regimen in 2011. At the time of our first visit, she
was taking spironolactone 50mg po bid, estradiol 2mg
po bid, and micronized progesterone 100mg po bid.
Her medical history was also significant for panic disor-
der, for which she was taking occasional clonazepam,
and insomnia, for which she was taking occasional zolpi-
dem. She was otherwise known to be in good general
health and reported no complaints. Apart from her use
of oral estradiol, she had no known risk factors for throm-
boembolism. She did not have a personal or familial his-
tory of thromboembolism and was a nonsmoker.
Her surgical history was notable only for laparo-
scopic cholecystectomy. She had not had any gender-
affirming surgeries such as breast augmentation, orchi-
ectomy, or vaginoplasty.
On initial examination the patient was a pleasant, well
nourished, well developed woman who appeared her sta-
ted age. Her breasts were noted to be Tanner stage V.
Her laboratory results from her initial evaluation
included estradiol 119 pg/mL, progesterone 8.70 ng/
mL, prolactin 9.5 ng/nL, sex hormone binding globulin
48 nmol/L, and total testosterone 256 ng/dL.
Course
Previous investigators have reported the following
basic framework for nonpuerperal induced lactation:
(1) increased estradiol and progesterone dosing to
mimic high levels seen during pregnancy, (2) use of a
galactogogue to increase prolactin levels, (3) use of a
breast pump with the speculation that it would increase
prolactin and oxytocin levels, and (4) subsequent re-
duction in estradiol and progesterone levels, with the
intention of mimicking delivery.1–6
The patient obtained domperidone from Canada, an
antiemetic used off-label as a galactogogue internation-
ally.7 The patient was started on domperidone 10 mg
po tid. The patient also was given instructions to use
her breast pump for 5 min per breast TID.

 The patient’s first follow-up visit occurred at 1
month. On physical examination, she was able to ex-
press droplets of milk. The domperidone dose was in-
creased to 20 mg po qid, her micronized progesterone
to 200 mg po daily, her estradiol to 8 mg po daily,
and her breast pump use to six times daily.
At the 2nd month visit, her progesterone was in-
creased to 400 mg po daily and her estradiol had in-
creased to 12 mg daily.
Three months after starting treatment, 2 weeks be-
fore the baby’s due date, the patient was making 8 oz
of breast milk per day. Her estradiol regimen was
shifted to a low dose patch (0.025 mg daily) and her
progesterone dose was lowered to 100 mg daily.
Three and a half months after she had started the men-
tioned regimen, the baby was born weighing 6 lbs 13 oz.
The patient breastfed exclusively for 6 weeks. During that
time the child’s pediatrician reported that the child’s
growth, feeding, and bowel habits were developmentally
appropriate. At 6 weeks, the patient began supplement-
ing breastfeedings with 4–8 oz of Similac brand formula
daily due to concerns about insufficient milk volume. At
the time of this article submission, the baby is approach-
ing 6 months old. The patient continues to breastfeed as a
supplement to formula feeding, and she continues to ad-
here to the medication regimen described earlier.
Discussion
We believe that this is the first formal report in the
medical literature of induced lactation in a transgender
woman.
Breastfeedingoffersimmunological,metabolic,andpsy-
chosocial benefits for both mother and infant. Breast milk
contains secretory IgA, anti-inflammatory agents, and
other immunomodulators that give breastfed infants im-
munological advantages relative to formula-fed infants.8,9
Formula-fed infants are noted to have higher risk of
rotavirus infection, otitis media, hospitalization for
lower respiratory tract infections, sudden infant death
syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, asthma, and child-
hood obesity relative to their breastfed counterparts.8–13
In addition, breastfeeding offers economic advan-
tages by allowing families to save resources that
might be devoted to formula and infant healthcare.14
Women who breastfeed are noted to have lower rates
of breast cancer and ovarian cancer than women who
have never breastfed.9
Breastfeeding has been noted to facilitate mother–
child bonding.15 For this reason, there has been interest
among adoptive parents in inducing lactation, and
there have been a number of published articles outlin-
ing protocols to that effect.1–6
One major difference between the induction of lacta-
tion in cis and transgender women is the need for andro-
gen blockade in the latter group. Our patient continued
to take spironolactone while breastfeeding for androgen
blockade. A known metabolite of spironolactone, can-
crenone is excreted in human milk. This has been
shown to be 0.2% of the maternal daily dose, which is
thought to be clinically insignificant.16 Spironolactone
has been reported to have tumorigenic potential in rats,
but according to the American Academy of Pediatrics,
it is thought to be compatible with breastfeeding.17
Throughout this process, the patient used domperi-
done that was obtained from Canada, where it is com-
monly used off-label as a galactogogue. Domperidone
is not currently available in the United States for gas-
trointestinal use due to the FDA’s concern about its as-
sociation with cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and
sudden death when used intravenously. The FDA has
warned against domperidone’s off-label use as a galac-
togogue due to its unknown risks on breastfeeding
infants.7 Although there is significant literature indicat-
ing that domperidone increases prolactin levels and
milk volume,18–20 it is uncertain whether this interven-
tion was necessary to induce lactation. The patient used
a breast pump, which likely increased her prolactin lev-
els independently of domperidone.21 It is not clear at

 this time whether all of the aforementioned compo-
nents of the patient’s medication regimen were neces-
sary to achieve lactation, or whether the patient’s
hormone levels (as listed in Table 1) were optimized to
achieve adequate breast milk volume. Areas of future
interest include the optimal dosing of estradiol, proges-
terone, and galactogogues in inducing lactation, as well
as the optimal frequency and duration of pump use.
Future investigation will be required to determine the
optimal treatment regimen for induced lactation in
transgender women.
