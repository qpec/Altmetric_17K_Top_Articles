On September 13, 2015, the Georgia Department of Public 
Health (DPH) was notified by hospital A of a cluster of pediatric 
Mycobacterium abscessus odontogenic infections. Hospital A had 
provided care for nine children who developed presumptive or 
confirmed M. abscessus infection after having a pulpotomy at 
pediatric dentistry practice A (dates of onset: July 23, 2014–
September 4, 2015). During a pulpotomy procedure, decay and 
the diseased pulp are removed to preserve a deciduous tooth. 
DPH initiated an investigation to identify the outbreak source 
and recommend prevention and control measures.
M. abscessus, a rapidly growing, nontuberculous mycobac-
terium (NTM), is found ubiquitously in the environment in 
water, soil, and dust. It commonly causes skin and soft tissue 
infection and can cause disease in multiple organs (1). NTM 
species display tolerance to commonly used disinfectants and 
are frequently found in the plumbing of health care facilities 
and water distribution systems (2). Improperly maintained 
dental unit water lines can permit growth and amplification of 
microorganisms, including NTM, which can form a biofilm 
and replicate within waterline tubing (3). Outbreaks have been 
reported in different clinic settings, including acupuncture 
clinics, a cosmetic surgery clinic, and a general medical clinic, 
although not dental clinics (4–7).
Probable cases were defined as occurrence of facial or neck 
swelling and biopsy-confirmed granulomatous inflammation 
among children with an illness onset date on or after January 1, 
2014. Confirmed cases were those in which M. abscessus was 
isolated by laboratory culture. Active case finding included 
contacting all patients who had a pulpotomy since January 1, 
2015, notifying area pediatricians and dentists of the outbreak, 
and reviewing hospital A pathology reports and M. abscessus 
positive cultures since January 1, 2014. DPH staff visited 
practice A on September 22, 2015, to evaluate infection control 
and prevention practices, and to view a mock pulpotomy dem-
onstration. Practice A used tap water for pulpotomies without 
water quality monitoring or bleaching of waterlines at the end 
of each day, as recommended in the manufacturer guidelines.* 
No other infection control deficiencies were noted. Water 
samples were collected for microbiologic analysis, and patient 
and water sample isolates were sent to CDC for molecular 
characterization by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
Practice A had performed 1,386 pulpotomies since 
January 1, 2014. As of January 1, 2016, a total of 20 patients 
with confirmed (n = 11) or probable (n = 9) M. abscessus 
infections were identified, resulting in an attack rate of 1%; 
case finding is ongoing. Median patient age was 7 years 
(range = 3–11 years), and median incubation period was 
65 days (range = 18–164 days). All patients were severely ill, 
requiring hospitalization at least once for a median of 7 days 
(range = 1–17 days); 17 patients required surgical excision and 
10 received outpatient intravenous antibiotics (Table). As of 
April 5, 2016, no deaths have resulted from infection.

All water samples from the seven dental stations had bacte-
rial counts above the American Dental Association recom-
mended ≤500 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL (average = 
91,333 CFU/mL); M. abscessus was isolated from all water 
samples. All water and patient isolates were indistinguishable 
by PFGE, indicating a common source.
This outbreak was caused by contaminated water used during 
pulpotomies, which introduced M. abcessus into the chamber 
of the tooth during irrigation and drilling. M. abscessus can 
cause severe infection among immunocompetent children, 
and because M. abscessus is ubiquitous in the environment, it 
poses a contamination risk. To prevent infections associated 
with waterlines, dental practices should follow manufacturer 
guidelines to disinfect waterlines, monitor water quality to 
ensure recommended bacterial counts, use point-of-use water 
filters, and eliminate dead ends in plumbing where stagnant 
water can enable biofilm formation (3,8). Health care provid-
ers should promptly report suspected outbreaks of infectious 
diseases to public health authorities so that an investigation can 
be initiated and appropriate control measures implemented.
