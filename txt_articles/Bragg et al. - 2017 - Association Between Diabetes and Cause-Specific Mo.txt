IMPORTANCE In China, diabetes prevalence has increased substantially in recent decades, but
there are no reliable estimates of the excess mortality currently associated with diabetes.
OBJECTIVES To assess the proportional excess mortality associated with diabetes and
estimate the diabetes-related absolute excess mortality in rural and urban areas of China.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 7-year nationwide prospective study of 512 869 adults
aged 30 to 79 years from 10 (5 rural and 5 urban) regions in China, who were recruited
between June 2004 and July 2008 and were followed up until January 2014.
EXPOSURES Diabetes (previously diagnosed or detected by screening) recorded at baseline.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause and cause-specific mortality, collected through
established death registries. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted mortality rate ratio
(RR) comparing individuals with diabetes vs those without diabetes at baseline.
RESULTS Among the 512 869 participants, the mean (SD) age was 51.5 (10.7) years, 59%
(n = 302 618) were women, and 5.9% (n = 30 280) had diabetes (4.1% in rural areas, 8.1% in
urban areas, 5.8% of men, 6.1% of women, 3.1% had been previously diagnosed, and 2.8%
were detected by screening). During 3.64 million person-years of follow-up, there were
24 909 deaths, including 3384 among individuals with diabetes. Compared with adults
without diabetes, individuals with diabetes had a significantly increased risk of all-cause
mortality (1373 vs 646 deaths per 100 000; adjusted RR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.93-2.08]), which
was higher in rural areas than in urban areas (rural RR, 2.17 [95% CI, 2.07-2.29]; urban RR,
1.83 [95% CI, 1.73-1.94]). Presence of diabetes was associated with increased mortality from
ischemic heart disease (3287 deaths; RR, 2.40 [95% CI, 2.19-2.63]), stroke (4444 deaths;
RR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.81-2.17]), chronic liver disease (481 deaths; RR, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.76-3.06]),
infections (425 deaths; RR, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.76-2.99]), and cancer of the liver (1325 deaths;
RR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.28-1.86]), pancreas (357 deaths; RR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.35-2.51]), female
breast (217 deaths; RR, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.24-2.74]), and female reproductive system (210
deaths; RR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.20-2.74]). For chronic kidney disease (365 deaths), the RR was
higher in rural areas (18.69 [95% CI, 14.22-24.57]) than in urban areas (6.83 [95% CI,
4.73-9.88]). Among those with diabetes, 10% of all deaths (16% rural; 4% urban) were
due to definite or probable diabetic ketoacidosis or coma (408 deaths).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults in China, diabetes was associated with
increased mortality from a range of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular diseases. Although
diabetes was more common in urban areas, it was associated with greater excess mortality in
rural areas.

T
he prevalence of diabetes in China has more than qua-
drupled in recent decades, with an estimated 110 mil-
lion adults having diabetes in 2010 and 490 million
adults estimated to have prediabetes.1-4 A previous study es-
timated that diabetes accounted for 5% to 7% of overall adult
mortality or disability-adjusted life-years in China in 2010.5
However, such estimates
were derived mainly from
extrapolation of risk esti-
mates from studies con-
ducted in high-income
countries where many pa-
tients with diabetes have reasonably good control of blood
glucose and take cardiovascular-protective medications.6-9
Previous studies of diabetes and mortality in China have been
limited by small sample size, enrollment of participants many
decades ago (when the prevalence of diabetes was relatively
low), or restriction to local occupational or urban cohorts.10-12
In China, many cases of diabetes are undiagnosed,1,3,4
and among persons diagnosed with diabetes, many are not
adequately managed,4 particularly in rural areas, thereby
increasing the risk of premature death. Because the increase
in diabetes prevalence in China is recent, the full effect on
mortality and morbidity is unknown. Moreover, the main
adult disease patterns in China differ appreciably from those
in Western countries (eg, more people die of stroke than of
ischemic heart disease [IHD] in China) and also vary greatly
between different regions.13 Therefore, reliable estimates of
the emerging epidemic of mortality associated with diabetes
are needed nationally and regionally to plan prevention and
treatment programs. This nationwide prospective study
examined the association of diabetes with cause-specific
mortality in rural and urban areas in China.
Methods
Details of the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) design, its meth-
ods, and its participants have been reported previously.14,15
Briefly, the 2004-2008 baseline survey took place in 10
(5 urban and 5 rural) localities across China, chosen from
China’
s nationally representative Disease Surveillance Points
system to retain geographic and social diversity. All 1 801 200
registered residents thought to be aged 35 to 74 years in the
study areas were identified through local residential records
and invited by letters and information leaflets to attend study
clinics between June 2004 and July 2008. Of these registered
residents, 512 869 participated, including 12 665 just outside
this age range (making the actual baseline age range from
30-79 years). Because a substantial minority of registered
residents would be disabled or living elsewhere, it was esti-
mated that about one-third of the nondisabled invitees actu-
ally living in the study areas participated. Prior to commence-
ment of the study, ethics approval was obtained from the
Oxford University Tropical Research Ethics Committee and
the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention Ethi-
cal Review Committee and all participants provided written
informed consent.
Trained health workers administered laptop-based
questionnaires at local study clinics to collect sociodemo-
graphic factors (eg, smoking, alcohol consumption, diet,
physical activity); medical history; measured height,
weight, and waist and hip circumference; lung function;
blood pressure; and heart rate. A nonfasting venous blood
sample was collected (with record of the time since last ate)
for storage and onsite random plasma glucose testing
using the SureStep Plus system (LifeScan). Participants
without a prior diabetes diagnosis plus an onsite random
plasma glucose level between 140 mg/dL and 200 mg/dL
(7.8-11.0 mmol/L) were invited for a fasting plasma glucose
test the following day.16
Previously diagnosed diabetes was defined by a “yes” re-
sponse to the question, “Has a doctor ever told you that you
had diabetes?” These individuals were asked to provide addi-
tional information about age at first diagnosis and current use
of certain medications for diabetes (eg, insulin and metfor-
min), which were used to differentiate between type 1 and 2
diabetes (which was not asked specifically).
Respondents were also asked to provide information
regarding use of medications for cardiovascular disease
(eg, aspirin, agents to lower lipid levels and blood pressure).
Among those without previously diagnosed diabetes, diabe-
tes detected by screening was defined as (1) a random plasma
glucose level of 126 mg/dL or greater (≥7.0 mmol/L) with time
since last ate food of 8 hours or longer or 200 mg/dL or
greater (≥11.1 mmol/L) with time since last ate of less than 8
hours or (2) a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL or
greater (≥7.0 mmol/L) on subsequent testing.
Cause-specific mortality was monitored through China’
s
Disease Surveillance Points system17 and electronic health
insurance records, with annual active confirmation of sur-
vival through local residential and administrative records.
The Disease Surveillance Points system provides reasonably
complete and reliable death registration, in which almost all
adult deaths were medically certified. For the few (<5%)
without medical attention prior to death, standardized proce-
dures were used to determine probable causes of death from
symptoms or signs described by relevant informants (usually
family members).18

Key Points
Question What is the excess mortality risk associated with
diabetes in rural and urban areas of China?
Findings In this 7-year nationwide prospective study
of 512 869 adults, diabetes was more common in urban than
rural areas (8.1% vs 4.1%, respectively), and individuals with
diabetes had significantly increased risk of mortality from
all causes and from a range of cardiovascular and
noncardiovascular diseases.
Meaning In China, diabetes is more common in urban than rural
areas, and is associated with increased mortality. With an
increasing adult population and rising prevalence of diabetes
among young adults, the burden of diabetes-associated mortality
will increase further.

The trained Disease Surveillance Points system staff
coded all diseases on the death certificates and assigned
underlying causes using the International Statistical Classifi-
cation of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revi-
sion. For deceased participants, the information entered into
the study follow-up system (including scanned images of the
original death certificates) was reviewed centrally by study
clinicians, who were unaware of baseline information, who
classified diabetes as the underlying cause only for deaths
from diabetic ketoacidosis or coma or from diabetes with no
other (eg, vascular or renal) antecedent cause on the death
certificates (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Mean and prevalence values for baseline variables by dia-
betes status were standardized for 5-year age groups, sex,
and study area as were mortality rates using the total CKB
study population as the standard. Cox proportional hazard
models were used to determine the relationship between
baseline diabetes and cause-specific mortality. Mortality rate
ratio (RRs) and 95% CIs were adjusted for baseline covariates
(education level, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical
activity, and body mass index [calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared]) and stratified by
location (5 urban and 5 rural areas), age at risk (5-year
groups), and sex.
In the analyses of mortality by duration of diabetes, the
floating absolute risk method was used such that the RR for
each category of duration (0 [screening-detected diabetes],
<5, 5-<10, 10-<15, and ≥15 years) was accompanied by a 95%
CI derived only from the variance of the log risk in that 1 cat-
egory. Hence, each RR, including the one for the reference
group, is associated with a group-specific 95% CI that reflects
the amount of data in only that 1 category.19 The group-
specific 95% CI for RR is (RR/T, RR × T), where T = exp
(1.96�v) and v is the variance of the log risk, and RR − 1 gives
the proportional excess risk.
Comparison of RRs for the first 4 years and for the subse-
quent years of follow-up revealed no evidence of departure
from the proportional hazards assumption for all-cause mor-
tality. Adjusted RRs were compared across strata of other
covariates, and χ2 tests for trend and heterogeneity were
applied to the log RRs and their standard errors. The
population-attributable fraction was calculated using
P(RR − 1)/(1 + P[RR − 1])20 where P is the prevalence of diabe-
tes in this study. Two-sided P values were used and P < .05
denotes statistical significance; no correction was made for
multiple testing. All analyses used SAS version 9.3 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc).
Results
Of the 512 869 participants (mean age, 51.5 years), 5.9%
(3.1% previously diagnosed, 2.8% detected by screening)
had diabetes at baseline and the prevalence was higher in
urban areas than in rural areas (8.1% vs 4.1%, respectively).
Individuals with diabetes were older and better educated,
especially in urban areas, and after adjustment for age, they
were less physically active and had higher measurements
for body mass index, waist circumference, and blood pres-
sure (Table 1). They were also more likely to have a history
of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney dis-
ease, and chronic liver diseases and to have a family history
of diabetes. Based on age at diagnosis (<30 years) and insu-
lin use, less than 1% of cases were likely to have been type 1
diabetes and were included in the analyses. Diabetes preva-
lence increased with age (from 1.3% at aged 30-39 years to
11.4% at aged 70-79 years; Figure 1).
Among those with previously diagnosed diabetes
(n = 16 142; n = 5617 in rural areas and n = 10 525 in urban
areas), the median age at diagnosis was 53 years and the
median time since diagnosis was 6 years. Overall, 77% of
those previously diagnosed as having diabetes reported
use of antidiabetic medications (65% taking oral medica-
tions, 15% taking insulin, and 4% taking both). Use of oral
agents was higher in rural areas than urban areas (75% vs
60%, respectively), whereas the opposite was true for insu-
lin (7% vs 18%).
Despite widespread use of treatments for diabetes, their
mean plasma glucose levels remained elevated (eFigure 1 in
the Supplement). However, at the time of the baseline sur-
vey, few of those with diabetes, either previously diagnosed
or diagnosed based on screening, were taking statins or
medications for hypertension (Table 1), this was particularly
true for those with previously diagnosed diabetes (1.1% and
14.5%, respectively) (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
During 3.64 million person-years of follow-up (until
January 1, 2014), 24 909 (4.9%) participants died (3384 with
diabetes and 21 525 without diabetes) at age of risk of 35 to 79
years and 2204 (0.4%) were lost to follow-up. Overall, indi-
viduals with diabetes had a significantly elevated all-cause
mortality compared with individuals without diabetes (1373
vs 646 deaths per 100 000, respectively; adjusted RR, 2.00
[95% CI, 1.93-2.08]). Compared with persons without diabe-
tes, all-cause mortality for persons with diabetes increased
with age, with absolute mortality rates of 716 vs 253 per
100 000, respectively, at the ages of 35 to 59 years (adjusted
RR, 2.41 [95% CI, 2.22-2.62]), 1666 vs 916 per 100 000 at the
ages of 60 to 69 years (RR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.88 to 2.14]), and
3760 vs 2435 per 100 000 at the ages of 70 to 79 years (RR,
1.84 [95% CI, 1.75 to 1.95]).
The adjusted RRs comparing those with diabetes vs
those without diabetes were greater in rural areas than
urban areas both overall (RR for rural areas, 2.17 [95% CI,
2.07-2.29] vs RR for urban areas, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.73-1.94])
and at each specific age group (Figure 1) as were the abso-
lute excess mortality rates among those with diabetes (ages
35-59 years: 737 per 100 000 in rural areas vs 290 per
100 000 in urban areas; ages 60-69 years: 1295 per 100 000
vs 545 per 100 000, respectively; ages 70-79 years: 2443 per
100 000 vs 1317 per 100 000).
The adjusted RRs were greater in women than in men
older than 60 years (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). The
excess mortality associated with diabetes accounted for 4.7%
of the male deaths (absolute death rate of 2043 per 100 000
for men with diabetes vs 930 per 100 000 for men without
diabetes) and 6.9% of the female deaths (absolute death rate

of 1416 per 100 000 for women with diabetes vs 418 per
100 000 for women without diabetes). Moreover, among
those without diabetes at baseline, the random plasma glu-
cose test level was associated positively with all-cause
mortality (RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.10-1.12] per 18 mg/dL [1 mmol/L]
higher usual random plasma glucose level).
Diabetes was associated with a RR of 2.13 (95% CI, 2.01-
2.26) for death from cardiovascular disease (Table 2), includ-
ing IHD (RR, 2.40 [95% CI, 2.19-2.63]), stroke (RR, 1.98 [95%
CI, 1.81-2.17]; 71.8% of stroke deaths were due to intracerebral
hemorrhage; RR, 1.87 [95% CI, 1.67-2.09]), and other vascular
diseases (RR, 1.96 [95% CI, 1.71-2.26]). The RRs for vascular
mortality were greater at younger ages than older ages (RR,
2.62 [95% CI, 2.28-3.02] for ages 35-59 years vs RR, 1.98 [95%
CI, 1.83-2.15] for ages 70-79 years) and greater in women than
in men (RR, 2.36 [95% CI, 2.18-2.56] for women vs RR, 1.93
[95% CI, 1.77-2.10] for men), but did not differ significantly
between rural areas and urban areas (eFigures 3-5 in the
Supplement).
Similarly, diabetes was associated with an increased RR
of 2.32 (95% CI, 1.76-3.06) for mortality from chronic liver
disease, infections (RR, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.76-2.99]), liver cancer

1.24-2.74]), and female reproductive system cancer (RR, 1.81
[95% CI, 1.20-2.74]). Diabetes was not associated with
increased mortality from cancers of lung, stomach, esopha-
gus, and intestine. For chronic respiratory disease, mainly
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the RR was 1.29 (95%
CI, 1.10-1.51). For deaths from external (eg, accident, suicide,
and violence) and other medical causes, diabetes was associ-
ated with significant excess risk.
Among individuals with diabetes at baseline, definite
diabetic ketoacidosis or coma accounted for 3.8% (128 of
3384) (6.3% [109 of 5617] in rural areas vs 1.1% [19 of 10 525]
in urban areas) of the deaths compared with 0.07% (15 of
21 525) of the deaths among those without diabetes at base-
line (because some developed diabetes during follow-up)
(RR, 181.85 [95% CI, 103.95-318.14]). A further 6.4% (217 of
3384) (9.6% [166 of 5617] in rural areas vs 3.1% [51 of 10 525]
in urban areas) of deaths were due to probable diabetic
ketoacidosis or coma (ie, unspecified diabetic deaths) with
an RR of 75.96 (95% CI, 54.68-105.52).
For the comparison of individuals with diabetes vs
those without diabetes, the RR for mortality from diabetic
ketoacidosis or coma was greater in rural areas (RR, 115.29
[95% CI, 84.31-157.65]) than in urban areas (RR, 47.43 [95%
CI, 25.19-89.32]) (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). Similarly,
the absolute death rate from diabetic ketoacidosis or coma
was higher in rural areas (3.49 per 1000 individuals vs 0.56
per 1000 individuals for urban areas) and increased with
age (Figure 2). Among those with diabetes, 10% of all deaths
(16% rural; 4% urban) were due to definite or probable dia-
betic ketoacidosis or coma (408 deaths).
Individuals with diabetes had a significantly elevated
RR of 13.10 (95% CI, 10.45-16.42) for mortality from chronic
kidney disease (CKD), mainly diabetes-related CKD
(RR, 83.29 [95% CI, 53.15-130.51]) rather than other or
unspecified kidney disease (RR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.13-2.60]).
The RR for CKD was greater in rural areas (RR, 18.69 [95%
CI, 14.22-24.57]) than in urban areas (6.83 [95% CI,
4.73-9.88]) (eFigure 3 in the Supplement), as were absolute
death rates from CKD among those with diabetes both
overall (1.2 per 1000 individuals in rural areas vs 0.4 per
1000 individuals in urban areas) and at each age group
(Figure 2).

The overall prevalence was adjusted for age, sex, and geographical area.
The prevalence in urban areas and in rural areas were adjusted only for age and
sex. The size of each box is proportional to the number of participants with
diabetes and the error bars indicate the 95% CI. All-cause mortality was
adjusted for age, geographic area (5 within each of rural and urban region), sex,
education level, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and body mass
index. Age at risk was calculated according to baseline age and length of
follow-up, with a censoring date of January 1, 2014, or age of death if earlier.
An individual could contribute person-time to more than 1 age category. Each
RR has a 95% CI that reflects the variance of the log risk in that 1 group, taking
into account the variance of the log risk in the reference group without diabetes
(shown with a dotted line). Each box has an area inversely proportional to the
effective variance of the log RR. The analyses were restricted to those who died
between the ages of 35 and 79 years, excluding 5 deaths at ages younger than
35 years and 1014 deaths at ages of 80 years or older. The reference group for
the urban analyses was individuals without diabetes in urban areas and the
reference group for the rural analyses was individuals without diabetes in rural
areas. Because there are 2 reference groups represented by the dotted line,
the 95% CIs are not shown. To avoid overlap of 95% CI lines, the boxes and
their 95% CIs for rural and urban areas in the right panel were moved apart
slightly from the actual positions.

For all-cause mortality, the RRs were higher with previ-
ously diagnosed diabetes (RR, 2.20 [95% CI, 2.11-2.30]) than
with screening-detected diabetes (RR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.67-
1.86]) (eTable 3 in the Supplement). For mortality from
several specific diseases, including diabetic ketoacidosis
or coma, the RRs were higher with previously diagnosed
diabetes compared with screening-detected diabetes
(RR, 164.35 [95% CI, 143.02-188.86] vs 46.33 [95% CI, 36.99-
58.03], respectively), CKD (RR, 18.88 [95% CI, 15.78-22.59]
vs RR, 6.31 [95% CI, 4.54-8.78]), IHD (RR, 2.76 [95% CI,
2.51-3.05] vs RR, 1.91 [95% CI, 1.67-2.18]), stroke (RR, 2.16
[95% CI, 1.93-2.41] vs RR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.58-2.03]), and
infection (RR, 2.88 [95% CI, 2.19-3.79] vs RR, 1.45 [95% CI,
0.91-2.30]).
Among those with diabetes, the risk increased with time
since first diagnosis and each 5-year increase was associated
with a 13% higher overall mortality (RR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.09-
1.17];P < .001fortrend)(Figure3).Thistrendwasdrivenmainly
bydiabeticketoacidosisorcoma,CKD,andcardiovascularmor-
tality, especially in rural areas (eFigure 6 in the Supplement).
The all-cause mortality RRs also varied by several addi-
tional baseline risk factors (eFigure 7 in the Supplement),
especially among those with previously diagnosed diabetes.
Among those with screening-detected diabetes the RRs also
varied by area, body mass index (mainly for nonvascular
mortality; eFigure 8 in the Supplement), and systolic blood
pressure (mainly for vascular mortality; eFigure 9 in the
Supplement), but not by sex.

Apart from the rural vs urban differences, the RRs did
not differ significantly across the 10 geographic regions
(eFigure 10 in the Supplement) and were largely unaffected
by additional adjustment for blood pressure and several
dietary factors (eg, consumption of fresh fruit, vegetables,
or meat), by exclusion of individuals with major prior dis-
eases (eg, cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, and chronic liver disease) at base-
line (RR, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.93-2.14]), or exclusion of the first 3
years of follow-up (RR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.84-2.02]) or those
with new-onset diabetes during follow-up (RR, 1.93 [95% CI,
1.85-2.03]). Additional adjustment for use of medications
also had little statistical effect on all-cause mortality (RR,
1.83 [95% CI, 1.75-1.93]).
Discussion
This large prospective study of adults from rural and urban
areas in China showed that diabetes was associated with
significantly increased mortality from a wide range of dis-
eases, with the greatest proportional excess mortality from
diabetic ketoacidosis or coma and CKD, followed by IHD,
stroke, other vascular, chronic liver disease, infection, cer-
tain cancers (mainly liver, pancreatic, female breast, and
endometrial cancers), and external causes. Even though the
prevalence of diabetes was higher in urban areas, diabetes
was associated with greater excess mortality in rural areas.
Several large prospective studies and meta-analyses have
provided reliable evidence about the relevance of diabetes
for total and certain cause-specific mortality.7-9 However,
most of these previous studies were conducted in high-
income countries where people with diabetes were generally
well managed and mainly assessed the effects of previously
diagnosed diabetes. Overall, the all-cause mortality RRs
associated with previously diagnosed diabetes were more
modest in these studies7-9 than those observed in the present
study; however, the differences in the study characteristics
could partially account for the differences. The low use of
cardiovascular-protective medications (eg, statins) in the
CKB diabetes population would be expected to yield even
greater excess cardiovascular mortality than those reported
in high-income countries, but this may have been offset by
the relatively short durations of diabetes.
The present study also showed that the main causes of
death associated with diabetes differed between China and
elsewhere. In many Western populations, diabetes is associ-
ated with more deaths from IHD than from stroke, whereas in
China the opposite is true, even though the mortality RRs for
IHD and stroke in the present study were similar to those re-
portedpreviously.7-9Moreover,existingevidencerelatinghem-
orrhagic stroke to diabetes is more limited. In a meta-analysis

The mortality rates by risk in the 4 age groups were standardized for sex,
using the total population with diabetes in the China Kadoorie Biobank as the
standard. The age at risk was calculated according to baseline age and length
of follow-up, with a censoring date of January 1, 2014, or age of death if earlier.
The analyses were restricted to those who died between the ages of 35 and 79
years, excluding 0 deaths at ages younger than 35 years and 5 deaths for
diabetic ketoacidosis or coma and 8 deaths for chronic kidney disease at ages of
80 years or older. The size of each box is proportional to the number of deaths
in each group and the error bars indicate the 95% CI. To avoid overlap of 95% CI
lines, the boxes and their 95% CIs for rural and urban areas were moved apart
slightly from the actual positions. An individual could contribute person-time to
more than 1 age category.

toacidosis or coma and CKD, the excess risks in the present
study, particularly in rural areas, were much greater than those
reported in high-income countries.
Few previous prospective studies provided information
about deaths from diabetic ketoacidosis or coma, perhaps
reflecting the rarity of such deaths. Available population-
based registry data suggested that less than 1% of deaths in
the United States among people with diabetes were due to
diabetic ketoacidosis or coma.21 Even though a high propor-
tion of diabetes cases was treated with antidiabetic medica-
tions in rural areas, approximately 16% of all deaths among
them were due to definite or probable diabetic ketoacidosis or

as in urban areas, though the absolute number of deaths re-
mains low. A recent nationwide survey in China, which had a
similar treatment rate with antidiabetic medications as in the
presentstudy,reportedthatonlyaboutone-thirdofthetreated
diabetescaseshadachievedadequateglycemiccontrol,4 asop-
posed to three-quarters in the United States.22
Similarly, for CKD mortality, the observed RR in the pres-
ent study was about 4 times as high as those reported in
previous studies,8,9 reflecting poor management of diabetes
and its complications, particularly in rural areas where both
the RR and absolute rates were almost 3 times as great as in
urban areas. Consistent with the present study findings, the
mortality from diabetes-related CKD in China has more than
doubled since 1990.13 By contrast, the proportional all-cause
excess mortality risk among individuals with type 2 diabetes
declined significantly in most Western populations during that
period (eg, to only about 15% in Sweden; RR, 1.15),23 attrib-
uted largely to better glycemic control and routine use of car-
dioprotective agents (eg, aspirin, statins, and antihyperten-
sive treatment).
As in many previous studies,7-9,24,25 greater all-cause and
cardiovascular mortality RRs were seen among women than
men, especially in those older than 60 years. The differences
were seen mainly in individuals with previously diagnosed
diabetes rather than in those with screening-detected diabe-
tes, suggesting that the sex difference in excess risk associ-
ated with diabetes was probably driven mainly by factors
related to detection and management of diabetes, which few
previous studies were able to investigate fully.
The probability of death associated with diabetes in the
general population could be estimated by combining the age-
specific all-cause mortality RRs in this study with 2010 age-
specific mortality rates from China,26 accounting for the
duration of diabetes at the same time. Based on the 2010
Chinese death rates, the 25-year probability of death was
69% among those diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 50
years and 38% among those who remained free of diabetes at
the age of 75 years, corresponding to an estimated loss of a
median of 9 years of life (10 years of life in rural areas and 8
years of life in urban areas) for individuals with diabetes diag-
nosed at the age of 50 years (eFigure 11 in the Supplement),
assuming the excess mortality is largely causal.
This study has several strengths. Although not nationally
representative with a relatively low participation rate at base-
line, the large sample size, diversity of areas covered, and
broadly consistent findings across study population sub-
groups means that the present RR estimates are likely not
biased and can be generalizable to the population at large.
Moreover, the study has several other strengths, including
standardized approaches and stringent quality control for
data collection, availability of information on previously
diagnosed and screening-detected diabetes, duration and
management of diabetes, central review of death certificates,
and completeness of follow-up.
However, the study also has several limitations. First, the
prevalence of diabetes in this study was only about half of that
reported in a 2010 nationally representative survey in China,
arisingmainlyfromadifferenceintheprevalenceofscreening-
detected diabetes (2.8% in CKB vs 8.1% in national survey),
ratherthanpreviouslydiagnoseddiabetes(3.1%inCKBvs3.5%
in national survey).4 Apart from difference in sampling meth-
ods and effects of temporal trends in diabetes prevalence, the
2010 China national survey used 3 different tests (ie, hemo-
globin A1c, fasting glucose, and 2-hour glucose) to identify
screening-detected diabetes, whereas the present study used
random plasma glucose and fasting plasma glucose. How-
ever, prevalence estimates in the present study were similar
to those reported in other contemporaneous, representative
Chinese surveys during the 2000s that used similar
approaches,2,27 and the 2009-2010 China survey of CKD that
reported a prevalence of 7.0% in urban areas and 4.3% in ru-
ral areas.28 Nevertheless, it is likely that a proportion of dia-
betes cases in the present study were undetected at baseline,
which could result in underestimation of diabetes-associated
risk, even though exclusion of those who had new-onset dia-
betes during follow-up did not alter the proportional risk es-
timates. Second, it was not possible to determine the preva-
lence of type 1 diabetes. However, based on age at diagnosis
(<30 years) and insulin use, less than 1% of cases were likely
to have been type 1 diabetes. Future studies are also needed
to confirm whether diabetes detected by different ap-
proaches would have similar mortality risk, which may affect
the reliability of our estimates on absolute mortality associ-
ated with diabetes in China. Third, it was not possible to ad-
just for lipid and other blood-related factors, so residual con-
founding may still persist. Fourth, no detailed information was
available about severity and complications of diabetes, which
may modify mortality risk estimates.
China’
s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals include
reducing noncommunicable disease mortality by one-third,
and monitoring the changes over time. In China, mortality
rates for adults aged 69 years or younger are decreasing due
to many dietary, social, occupational, and health care
changes, and declined by about 15% during 2000-2010.5,29
This decreasing trend may be slowed or even halted by
increasing tobacco-attributed mortality in men,30 and the
increasing prevalence of diabetes in both sexes.
Moreover, among people of a given age, the risk of death
is strongly associated with the duration of diabetes, so the
lifetime hazards will be even greater for people who develop
diabetes during early adult life than for those who do so after
they reach the age of 50 years. As the prevalence of diabetes
in young adults increases and the adult population grows,31
the annual number of deaths related to diabetes is likely to
continue to increase, unless there is substantial improvement
in prevention and management.
Conclusions
Among adults in China, diabetes was associated with in-
creased mortality from a range of cardiovascular and noncar-
diovascular diseases. Although diabetes was more common in
urban areas, it was associated with greater excess mortality
in rural areas.
