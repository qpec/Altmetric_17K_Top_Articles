Introduction New ’heated tobacco products’ are 
being marketed in several countries with claims that they 
expose users to lower levels of toxins than conventional 
cigarettes which could be read as being less likely to 
cause health problems than conventional cigarettes. In 
the USA, Philip Morris International (PMI) has submitted 
an application to the Food and Drug Administration for 
permission to market its heated tobacco product, IQOS, 
with reduced exposure and reduced risk claims.
Methods Analysis of detailed results on 24 biomarkers 
of potential harm in PMI studies of humans using IQOS 
compared with humans using conventional cigarettes.
Results Among American adults, there is no statistically 
detectable difference between IQOS and conventional 
cigarette users for 23 of the 24 biomarkers of potential 
harm in PMI’s studies. In Japan, there were no significant 
differences between people using IQOS and conventional 
cigarettes in 10 of 13 biomarkers of potential harm. It 
is likely that some of the significant differences are false 
positives.
Conclusion Despite delivering lower levels of some 
toxins than conventional cigarettes, PMI’s own data fail 
to show consistently lower risks of harm in humans using 
its heated tobacco product, IQOS, than conventional 
cigarettes.
InTRoduCTIon
Nicotine is the addictive drug in tobacco. Burning 
the tobacco generates an aerosol of ultrafine parti-
cles that carries nicotine deep into smokers’ lungs, 
where it is absorbed and rapidly reaches the brain. 
That burning yields toxic chemicals that cause 
disease. Ever since people started understanding in 
the 1950s that smoking kills, millions have struggled 
to stop smoking. The tobacco companies, desperate 
to keep and expand their customers, have been 
trying to make ‘safer cigarettes’ since the 1960s.1 
They have also developed products that avoided 
burning, including e-cigarettes,2 nicotine replace-
ment therapy,3 and products that heat the tobacco 
without setting it on fire. As of January 2018 all the 
major multinational tobacco companies had devel-
oped, or were in the process of developing, so-called 
‘heated tobacco products’ (HTP; also called ‘heat-
not-burn’ tobacco products). Because these devices 
generate their nicotine aerosols by heating a stick of 
ground tobacco and chemicals without setting the 
tobacco on fire, they generally produce fewer toxic 
chemicals than a conventional cigarette, which is 
promoted as meaning or implying that these prod-
ucts are not as dangerous as conventional cigarettes.
In 2015, Philip Morris International (PMI) 
started test marketing its IQOS HTP outside the 
USA on the grounds that it is not as bad as a ciga-
rette because ‘the tobacco is heated and not burned, 
the levels of harmful chemicals are significantly 
reduced compared to cigarette smoke.’4
Because IQOS is a new tobacco product, PMI 
needs to obtain premarket authorisation from the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell 
it in the USA. In particular, PMI wants to market 
IQOS with reduced risk claims, what US law calls a 
‘modified risk tobacco product’ (MRTP). To obtain 
authorisation to market IQOS with reduced risk 
claims, PMI submitted an application to the FDA in 
December 2016.5 As required by law, FDA has made 
most of the application available for the public to 
review. The application includes comparisons of the 
levels of 24 biomarkers of potential harm in human 
smokers, including comparisons with people who 
smoke conventional cigarettes. These biomarkers 
include measures of inflammation, oxidative stress, 
cholesterol and triglycerides, blood pressure and 
lung function. This paper uses information in the 
PMI application to evaluate this comparison and 
concludes that in people who actually use IQOS, the 
levels of these biomarkers of potential harm are not 
detectably different from conventional cigarettes.

The results analysed in this paper are from PMI’s 
‘Three-month Reduced Exposure in a confined and 
ambulatory setting’ studies (ZRHR-REXA-07-JP 
in Japan and ZRHM-REXA-08-US in the USA) 
that present human clinical studies of non-cancer 
biomarkers of potential harm presented in PMI’s 
MRTP application’s5 Executive Summary, Module 
6: Summaries of All Research Findings, and Module 
7.3.1: Scientific Studies and Analyses (Studies in 
Adult Human Studies: Clinical Studies), specifically 
the data on 24 biomarkers of potential harm in 
human users derived from two of their ‘Reduced 
Exposure’ studies: ZRHR-REXA-07-JP in Japan 
and ZRHM-REXA-08-US in the USA.
As described in Section 6.1.4.3.2 of the appli-
cation, 
cigarette 
smokers 
were 
randomised, 
controlled, open-label, three-arm parallel group 
studies in which smokers were randomised to 
IQOS (menthol), continued smoking their current 
brand of cigarettes or smoking abstinence. Baseline 
data were collected on day 0 immediately before 
randomisation, people were held during a 5-day 
confinement period then released to the ambula-
tory setting and observed at 90 (±3 (range)) days

after randomisation. (Some variables were measured during 
confinement and before 90 days, but are not considered in 
this analysis.) During the confinement period, product use was 
directed and monitored by the study staff and participating 
smokers were controlled for product compliance. Subjects 
assigned to conventional cigarettes or IQOS used the products 
without restriction (ad libitum) during an extended daily time 
window (16 
hours); dual use of conventional cigarettes and IQOS 
was not permitted. The 3-month ambulatory phase was designed 
to reflect a near real-world environment where dual use of IQOS 
and conventional cigarettes or other tobacco products could 
occur. PMI selected a 3-month extended ambulatory follow-up 
period so that the study would be long enough to assess the 
initial changes in some of the clinical risk endpoints that have 
been shown to be reversible within 2 weeks to 3 months.
The final sample (table 1) consisted of people who were 
adherent with their assigned study product and without major 
protocol deviations that impacted the validity of the evalua-
tion of the study results. This sample was designed to assess the 
maximum exposure reduction achievable (what PMI character-
ised as the ‘optimal effect’) in subjects who were using IQOS 
ad libitum and exclusively or at least predominantly, rather than 
the effect in the full population representing a heterogeneous 
exposure (eg, as mixed product use, or non-use of the assigned 
product).
The point estimates and 95% confident intervals (CIs) at day 
90 were computed using least squares means from an analysis of 
covariance with study arm as a factor adjusting for baseline value, 
sex and average daily conventional cigarette consumption over 
the last 4 weeks as reported during screening. (Thus, the width of 
the CIs for the differences between IQOS and conventional ciga-
rette use in table 1 benefits from the information in the smoking 
abstinence group even though those subjects are not directly 
involved in the point estimates being compared.) Endpoints that 
were not normally distributed were log-transformed (base e) 
prior to analysis, then back-transformed to calculate least squares 
means ratios to compare IQOS with conventional cigarettes.
Both trials were registered with  
ClinTrials.

Specific results are based on measures of inflammation in 
Section 6.1.4.4.2; cholesterol, triglycerides and physiological 
measures related to heart disease in Section 6.1.4.4.4; and lung 
function in Section 6.1.4.4.5.
ResuLTs
Among American adults, there is no statistically detectable 
difference between IQOS and conventional cigarettes for 23 of 
the 24 biomarkers of potential harm in PMI’s studies (table 1). 
This is indicated by the fact that 23 of the 95% CIs include zero 
(ie, no statistically significant difference). Moreover, when using 
the conventional 95% confidence standard for statistical hypoth-
esis testing, one would expect 5% of the tests to yield false posi-
tives. Five per cent of 24 tests is 1.2 tests, which means that 
one would expect one false positive result. PMI had one positive 
result (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)), which is 
what one would expect by chance.
PMI also reported the results on 13 biomarkers of potential 
harm among Japanese people (table 1). There were significant 
improvements in 4/13 of these biomarkers, 3 markers of inflam-
mation (white cell count, prostaglandin F2 alpha and soluble 
ICAM) and 1 measure of cholesterol (high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol). When using the conventional 95% confidence 
standard one would expect 0.65 positive tests, which means one 
would expect one false positive test.

These human data are important information because they 
represent direct evidence on how IQOS affects people who use 
the product. They show that, despite the evidence that PMI 
submitted that the levels of some toxins in IQOS aerosol are 
lower than in conventional cigarettes,5 fewer toxic chemicals, 
however, do not necessarily translate into lower harm when 
people use the product.
In its MRTP application, PMI did not discuss the results of 
the conventional statistical tests described in the Results section, 
which are routine for such scientific analysis. Rather, they simply 
emphasise the direction of changes while ignoring the fact that 
these differences are within what would be expected based on 
simple randomness. No tobacco company would tolerate such 
assertions made by the FDA or other public health authorities.
The results reported in PMI’s application (and in a published 
paper6) for Japan are slightly more positive for IQOS, with 4 of 
13 biomarkers showing differences from conventional cigarettes 
(where one would expect one false positive by chance). These 
results are not strong enough to warrant drawing a conclusion 
of reduced risk. The conclusion of no significant difference on 
biomarkers of potential harm is based on taking PMI’s results 
at face value despite the tobacco companies’ (including Philip 
Morris) long record of manipulating the design, analysis and 
presentation of their published scientific studies <<ED:  Cita-
tion should be "7-12" no "7-13".>>.7–13
Like cigarettes (and e-cigarettes), IQOS uses an aerosol of ultra-
fine particles to deliver the nicotine. These ultrafine particles 
cause heart and lung disease. The adverse health effects of these 
particles and many of the other toxins do not drop in propor-
tion to reducing the dose, so even low levels of exposure can be 
dangerous.13 This effect is why smoke-free environment laws are 
followed by big drops in heart attacks and other diseases despite 
the fact that secondhand smokers breathe in much less smoke 
that the smokers.14 In addition, while the IQOS does not set the 
tobacco stick on fire, it heats it to 350°C (660°F), which is still hot 
enough to cause pyrolysis. There is already independent evidence 
that IQOS compromises functioning of arteries,15 a key risk factor 
for heart disease and heart attacks, as badly as a cigarette.
The clinical studies that PMI reported appropriately did not 
include cancer because carcinogenic effects take much longer to 
be manifest than cardiovascular and pulmonary effects. Even if the 
levels of carcinogens delivered by IQOS are lower than conven-
tional cigarettes on a per-puff basis, these lower exposure levels 
may not yield proportionately lower cancer risks because both the 
intensity and duration of exposure impact cancer risk.16–18
The purpose of this paper is to assess the data on biomarkers 
of potential harm of the Philip Morris IQOS HTP system in 
people who were actually using the system compared with 
people who smoke conventional cigarettes based on the infor-
mation submitted to the US FDA in PMI’s MRTP application 
for IQOS. On 31 March 2018, the author conducted a PubMed 
search using the search term ‘(IQOS or ‘heat not burn’ or ‘heated 
tobacco product’) and (health or harm) and (human or clinical)’. 
This search returned 33 papers, none of which reported on 
comparisons of in vivo biomarkers of potential harm in people 
using IQOS (or any other HTP system) compared with conven-
tional cigarettes. Thus, as of 9 July 2018, the data in the PMI 
MRTP application remained the only publicly available evidence 
on the in vivo human clinical effects of IQOS compared with 
conventional cigarettes.
While this analysis is limited to the data presented in PMI’s 
IQOS MRTP application to the FDA, it is likely that the effects 
of other HTPs being developed by other tobacco companies will 
have similar effects because the fundamental principles behind 
all these products are the same.
On 15 June 2018, PMI issued a press release, ‘Philip Morris (PM) 
Announces Positive Results from New Clinical Study on IQOS,’19 
that said, ‘all eight of the primary clinical risk endpoints moved in 
the same direction as observed for smoking cessation in the group 
who switched to IQOS, with statistically significant changes in five 
of the eight endpoints compared with on-going smoking.’ While 
PMI did not release any detailed results, examining the protocol 
(on  
ClinicalTrials. 
gov) revealed that this new study only examined 
six clinical measures, compared with the 24 in MRTP application 
(table 1). (The other two were biomarkers of exposure.) PMI did 
not say which of the changes were statistically significant, raising 
the possibility that the protocol and analysis were manipulated to 
achieve positive results.8 9 PMI increased the sample size from 88 
in the original US study to 984. While bigger studies are better, 
the fact is that making the sample size big enough will increase 
the power to the point that almost any difference will reach statis-
tical significance regardless of whether it is clinically significant or 
not. The true measure of reduced risk would be statistically signif-
icant changes that were large enough to be clinically significant in 
enough biomarkers of potential harm to be meaningful.
PMI’s failure to show significant improvements in these 
biomarkers of potential harm is consistent with the data PMI 
reported on the levels of toxicants in IQOS mainstream aerosol 
compared with mainstream smoke of 3R4F reference cigarettes.20 
While many toxicants were lower in IQOS aerosol, 56 others were 
higher in IQOS emissions and 22 were more than twice as high, 
and 7 were more than an order of magnitude higher.
In short, PMI’s results in humans failed to meet the legal require-
ment that IQOS ‘as it is actually used by consumers, will signifi-
cantly reduce harm and the risk of tobacco-related disease to 
individual users’ that US law requires before the FDA can approve a 
reduced risk claim. In the USA, PMI wants to sell IQOS with claims 
that ‘Scientific studies have shown that switching completely from 
cigarettes to the IQOS system can reduce the risks of tobacco-re-
lated diseases’ and ‘Switching completely to IQOS presents less risk 
of harm than continuing to smoke cigarettes’5; these claims are not 
substantiated by PMI’s own data.
On 25 January 2018, based in part on the information in this 
paper (which had been submitted to FDA as a public comment) 
showing gaps in PMI's scientific evidence, the FDA’s Tobacco 
Products Scientific Advisory Committee voted that PMI had 
failed to demonstrate that its proposed modified (reduced) risk 
labelling and advertising claims for IQOS were demonstrated by 
scientific evidence.21

What this paper adds
 
► Heated tobacco products are being marketed in several 
countries with claims of reduced exposure to toxins 
compared with conventional cigarettes.
 
► Studies conducted in people using Philip Morris 
International’s IQOS heated tobacco product did not reveal 
detectably better measures of biomarkers of potential harm 
than conventional cigarettes in human tests.
 
► These products should not be permitted to be marketed 
with claims that state or imply reduced risks compared with 
conventional cigarettes.
the world should permit such claims to be made. All companies 
wishing to market HTPs with reduced risk claims should be held 
to the same standard, and their claims independently verified.
