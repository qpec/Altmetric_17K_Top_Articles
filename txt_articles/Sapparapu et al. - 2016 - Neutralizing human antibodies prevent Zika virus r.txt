Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-transmitted flavivirus 
that can cause severe disease, including congenital birth defects 
during pregnancy1. To develop candidate therapeutic agents against 
ZIKV, we isolated a panel of human monoclonal antibodies from 
subjects that were previously infected with ZIKV. We show that a 
subset of antibodies recognize diverse epitopes on the envelope 
 
(E) protein and exhibit potent neutralizing activity. One of 
 
the most inhibitory antibodies, ZIKV-117, broadly neutralized 
infection of ZIKV strains corresponding to African and Asian-
American lineages. Epitope mapping studies revealed that ZIKV-
117 recognized a unique quaternary epitope on the E protein 
dimer–dimer interface. We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy 
of ZIKV-117 in pregnant and non-pregnant mice. Monoclonal 
antibody treatment markedly reduced tissue pathology, placental 
and fetal infection, and mortality in mice. Thus, neutralizing 
human antibodies can protect against maternal–fetal transmission, 
infection and disease, and reveal important determinants for 
structure-based rational vaccine design efforts.
Recent ZIKV epidemics are linked to Guillain–Barré syndrome in 
adults and microcephaly in fetuses and newborn infants2–5. Although 
ZIKV infection can potentially cause severe disease, specific treatments 
and vaccines for ZIKV are not currently available. We sought to isolate 
neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with broad speci-
ficity against all ZIKV strains and protective activity in vivo. We tested 
the serological response of subjects who had previously been infected 
with ZIKV in diverse geographic locations. Serum from each subject 
contained antibodies that were shown by ELISA assays to react with 
ZIKV E protein and to neutralize infection of a contemporary Asian 
isolate (H/PF/2013) from French Polynesia (Fig. 1a, b). We studied 
the B cells of subject 1001 in greater detail. Based on the results of 
replicate assays, the frequency of B cells that secrete antibodies against 
ZIKV E protein in the peripheral blood was between 0.36% and 0.61% 
(Fig. 1c, d). We next tested the reactivity of antibodies with domain III 
(DIII) of the E protein from ZIKV or the related dengue (DENV) and 
West Nile (WNV) viruses. Only a subset (6%) of the ZIKV-E-reactive 
antibodies bound to DIII, and most were specific for ZIKV (Fig. 1c). 
Comparative binding to a wild-type or mutant ZIKV E protein lacking 
the conserved fusion loop epitope in DII (mutant denoted hereafter 
as E-FLM) established immunodominance (binding around 70% of 
mAbs) of the fusion loop.
We obtained 29 cloned hybridomas secreting mAbs that bound to 
ZIKV E protein from the cells of three donors (mAb ZIKV-195 from 
subject 1011, mAb ZIKV-204 from subject 973, and the remaining 
27 mAbs from subject 1001). All of the mAbs except for one belonged 
to the IgG1 isotype (two could not be determined), with an equal 
distribution of κ and λ light chains (Extended Data Table 1); sequence 
analysis of cDNA of the antibody variable gene regions revealed that 
each mAb represented an independent clone (Extended Data Table 1). 
We determined the half-maximal effective concentrations for binding

Figure 1 | Human antibody and B-cell response to ZIKV infection.  
a, b, Serum samples from humans with a previous ZIKV infection were 
tested for binding to ZIKV E protein in ELISA (a) (with two technical 
replicates) and neutralization of ZIKV (b) (at least two independent 
repeats in triplicate). Subject 1001 had the highest endpoint titre in the 
binding assay and displayed potent neutralizing activity. Subject 657 
was a control without history of exposure to ZIKV. c, Supernatants of 
Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-cell cultures from subject 1001 
were tested for binding to ZIKV E or DIII of ZIKV E or related flavivirus 
E proteins; the WNV-reactive clone and all but one DENV-reactive 
B-cell line also reacted with ZIKV E protein. The frequency of antigen-
specific cells against each viral protein was determined with a threshold 
absorbance value at 405 nm (A405 nm) of 1.5 as indicated. d, In four 
additional separate B-cell transformation experiments, the frequency of 
B cells reactive with intact ZIKV E or E-FLM was determined.

to ZIKV E protein (EC50) and neutralization (IC50) of infection (Fig. 2a, 
 
Extended Data Fig. 1); most of the mAbs bound to E protein at low 
concentrations (EC50 < 
 100 ng ml−1), whereas only four of the 29 mAbs 
exhibited strong neutralizing activity (IC50 = 
 5–420 ng ml−1). We next 
determined how many antigenic sites on ZIKV E were recognized using 
quantitative competition binding. We identified four major  
competition 
groups (designated A, B, C or D). Group A mAbs had 23 members 
that were directed against the fusion loop in DII, as  
determined by 
 
differential binding to E and E-FLM (Extended Data Fig. 1), and had 
only one clone (ZIKV-88) with moderate neutralizing potency. The 
group B mAb ZIKV-116 neutralized ZIKV infection and bound to E, 
DIII and E-FLM. Group C mAbs (ZIKV-19 and ZIKV-190) bound to 
E and E-FLM weakly, but did not potently neutralize infection. The 
group D mAb ZIKV-195 neutralized with moderate potency and was 
similar in binding to both E and E-FLM. The most inhibitory group D 
mAb, ZIKV-117, bound to both E and E-FLM weakly.
We mapped the epitopes of representative mAbs using a shotgun 
alanine-scanning mutagenesis library6 of ZIKV prM and E protein 
variants (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 2). Loss-of-binding analysis 
 
confirmed that group A mAbs bound to the fusion loop in DII, whereas 
the group B mAb bound to DIII. Group B mAb ZIKV-116 bound to 
an epitope involving residues T309, E393 and K394 along the lateral 
ridge of DIII (DIII-LR), which was confirmed in an ELISA that showed 
reduced binding to DIII with mutations A310E and T335K in DIII-LR7. 
The epitope mapping studies suggest that the group D mAb ZIKV-117 
 
binds specifically to DII across two adjacent dimers at the ‘dimer–
dimer’ interface (Fig. 2c). We were unable to isolate virus neutralization 
escape mutant viruses for ZIKV-117, despite six passages in cell culture 
under mAb selection pressure.
Because of their potency, we assessed whether group B mAb ZIKV-
116 and group D mAb ZIKV-117 could inhibit diverse ZIKV strains 
encompassing the African and Asian-American lineages. ZIKV-117

Figure 2 | Characterization of anti-ZIKV mAbs. a, We tested 29 mAbs in 
binding, neutralization, and competition binding assays. The EC50 against 
ZIKV E and the IC50 (by focus reduction neutralization test) against 
H/PF/2013 strain for neutralizing antibodies (highlighted in blue) are 
shown. The mAbs are displayed in four groups (A, B, C or D) based on a 
competition binding assay. The values are the percentage of binding that 
occurred during competition compared to non-competed binding, which 
was normalized to 100% and the range of competition is indicated by the 
box colours. Black filled boxes indicate strongly competing pairs (residual 
binding < 
30%), grey filled boxes indicate intermediate competition 
(residual binding 30–69%), and white filled boxes indicate non-competing 
pairs (residual binding ≥ 70%). The IC50 against H/PF/2013 strain for 
neutralizing antibodies is shown with neutralizing clones highlighted in 
blue. b, A ribbon diagram of three protomers of ZIKV E (DI in red, DII 
in yellow and DIII in blue) is shown with critical residues highlighted as 
spheres from epitope mapping experiments for representative antibodies 
in each of the competition binding groups. The colours of the critical 
residues correspond to the competition group designation as in a. The 
mutations in the E-FLM and DIII-LR mutants are indicated by black and 
silver spheres, respectively. c, Representative mAbs from each competition 
binding group are listed with the domains and residues critical for binding.

neutralized all of the ZIKV strains tested, including two African (MR 
766 and Dakar 41519), two Asian (Malaysia P6740 and H/PF/2013), 
and an American (Brazil Paraiba 2015) strain with IC50 values of 
 
5 to 25 ng ml−1 (Fig. 2d, e). ZIKV-116 inhibited four of the five strains 
efficiently, but was inactive against MR 766, the original African strain 
(Fig. 2d, e). Alignment of the sequences of ZIKV H/PF/2013 and MR 
766, with respect to residues in DIII-LR7 that ZIKV-116 binds, revealed 
only one difference (a conservative E393D change). Given these data, 
we hypothesize that the DIII-LR epitope of ZIKV-116 is displayed 
 
differently on MR 766 owing to allosteric effects of changes in other 
parts of the E protein, which could regulate epitope accessibility8,9.
As recent studies have suggested that cross-reactive ZIKV-specific 
human mAbs can enhance DENV infection in vivo10, we tested whether 
these two ZIKV-neutralizing mAbs could bind to DENV-infected cells. 
ZIKV-117 showed a restricted type-specific binding pattern as it failed 
to stain cells infected with DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 or DENV-4, 
or bind to purified WNV E protein (Extended Data Fig. 3 and data 
not shown). In comparison, ZIKV-116 bound to cells infected with 
DENV-1, DENV-2 or DENV-4, but did not bind to DENV-2 DIII or 
WNV DIII in ELISA.
In vivo models of ZIKV pathogenesis and antibody prophylaxis have 
been reported7,10,11 in mice deficient in type-I interferon signalling. 
To determine whether ZIKV-117 had therapeutic activity, we treated 
4–5-week-old wild-type male C57BL/6 mice at day − 
1 with anti- 
Ifnar1 mAbs, and then inoculated animals with 103 focus-forming units 
(FFU) of a mouse-adapted African strain of ZIKV-Dakar7. Animals 
were treated with a single dose of ZIKV-117 or non-binding isotype 
control (human (h)CHK-152)12, on day + 
1 (100 μ 
g; 6.7 mg kg−1) or day 
+ 
5 (250 μ 
g; 16.7 mg kg−1). Animals treated with hCHK-152 sustained 
significant lethality compared to those receiving ZIKV-117 (Fig. 3a), 
which were protected even when administered only a single dose 5 days 
after virus inoculation.
We and others have demonstrated placental injury and fetal demise 
following ZIKV infection of pregnant mice with deficiencies in type-I 
interferon signalling13–15. To assess the protective ability of ZIKV-117 
during fetal development, we treated Ifnar1−/− pregnant dams mated to 
wild-type male mice with a single 250 μ 
g dose of ZIKV-117 or isotype 
control mAb (hCHK-152) on embryo day 5.5 (E5.5), the day before 
ZIKV inoculation. Whereas inoculation with ZIKV-Brazil at E6.5 
 
following administration with hCHK-152 resulted in high levels of 
maternal infection and almost uniform fetal demise by E13.5, treatment 
with ZIKV-117 improved fetal outcome (Fig. 3b, c).
Because of the extent of demise at E13.5 after ZIKV infection of 
Ifnar1−/− dams, we could not recover adequate numbers of fetuses to 
measure viral titres. Accordingly, we switched to a wild-type mouse 
model with an acquired type-I interferon deficiency using the mouse-
adapted African ZIKV-Dakar strain. Wild-type pregnant dams were 
treated at day − 
1 (E5.5) with an anti-Ifnar1 mAbs. At the same time, 
these animals were administered vehicle control (PBS), 250 μ 
g isotype 
control hCHK-152, or 250 μ 
g ZIKV-117. One day later, dams were 
inoculated subcutaneously with 103 FFU of ZIKV-Dakar. Fetuses 
from dams treated with anti-Ifnar1 mAbs and given PBS or hCHK-152 
showed high levels (for example, around 105 to 107 FFU equivalents per 
gram) of viral RNA in the placenta and fetal brain (Fig. 3d). In compar-
ison, mice treated with anti-Ifnar1 and ZIKV-117 had reduced virus 
levels in the placenta and fetal brain (for example, around 10° to 103 
FFU equivalents per gram). This phenotype was associated with trans-
port of human ZIKV E-specific IgG across the maternal–fetal placental 
barrier (816 ± 
 53 ng ml−1 for the placenta and 1,675 ± 
 203 ng ml−1 for 
the fetal head; Extended Data Fig. 4). As levels of neonatal Fc recep-
tor in the mouse placenta are lower than other mammalian species16, 
reduced levels of transport of maternal or exogenous IgG into the 
fetus is expected17. Although this factor could underestimate the ther-
apeutic effect of exogenous anti-ZIKV IgG or maternal antibodies, we 
nonetheless achieved levels in the placenta and fetal head that were 
orders of magnitude above the IC50 neutralization value for ZIKV-117.

Dams treated with ZIKV-117 also had substantially lower levels of viral 
RNA in the maternal brain and serum (Fig. 3e).
Antibody-dependent enhancement of flavivirus infection occurs 
when type-specific or cross-reactive antibodies fail to reach a stoichio-
metric threshold for neutralization and instead facilitate infection of 
Fcγ 
R-expressing myeloid cells18. Because antibodies can promote 
 
antibody-dependent enhancement of ZIKV in cell culture19,20, we 
 
evaluated the protective efficacy of a recombinant form of ZIKV-117 
IgG containing a leucine (L) to alanine (A) substitution at positions 234 
and 235 (LALA)21, which lacked efficient binding to Fcγ 
R, retained 
interactions with FcRn22, and neutralized ZIKV in vitro equivalently 
compared to the parent mAb (Extended Data Fig. 5). The LALA variant 
of ZIKV-117 showed similar protective activity against infection of the 
placenta and fetus relative to the parent mAb (Fig. 3f). As the protection 
conferred by ZIKV-117 in the pregnancy model is probably due to 
neutralization and not Fc effector functions, LALA variants could be 
used without a risk of antibody-dependent enhancement.
We next assessed the post-exposure efficacy of ZIKV-117 during 
pregnancy. Mice treated with anti-Ifnar1 mAbs at E5.5 were  
inoculated 
with 103 FFU of ZIKV-Dakar at E6.5 and then administered a  
single 
dose of PBS, 250 μ 
g of hCHK-152, or 250 μ 
g of ZIKV-117 at E7.5. 
Compared to PBS or isotype control mAb treatment, administration of 
ZIKV-117 markedly reduced the viral burden in the dams, the placenta 
and fetus when measured at E13.5 (Fig. 3g, h).
The reduction in viral load mediated by ZIKV-117 was associated 
with decreased damage of the placenta (as judged by labyrinth layer 
and overall placenta area), less trophoblast cell death, and increased 
body size of the fetus (Fig. 4a–c) compared to fetuses of PBS- or 
hCHK-152-treated dams. ZIKV-117 protected against ZIKV-induced 
placental insufficiency, as the placental area and fetal size from infected 
dams treated with anti-ZIKV mAbs were similar to that of uninfected 
 
placentas14. In situ hybridization revealed an almost complete absence 
of viral RNA in the junctional zone and decidua of the placenta in 
 
animals treated with ZIKV-117 compared to staining observed in 
PBS- or hCHK-152-treated controls (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 6). 
We also observed vascular damage associated with ZIKV infection 
of the placenta14, characterized as diminished vimentin staining of 
fetal endothelial cells, which was rescued by ZIKV-117 to levels seen 
in uninfected placentas (Fig. 4e). The histopathological data suggests 
that ZIKV-117 treatment can reduce the ability of ZIKV to cross the 
fetal endothelial cell barrier, and thereby prevent vertical transmission 
and improve fetal outcome.
Our most potent neutralizing antibodies exhibited a breadth of 
inhibitory activity against strains from Africa, Asia, and the Americas. 
Even a single ZIKV-117 dose given 5 days after infection protected 
mice against lethal infection, a timeline similar to the most protective 
antibodies against other flaviviruses23. Prophylaxis or post-exposure 
therapy of pregnant mice with ZIKV-117 reduced infection in mothers,

and in placental and fetal tissues. As the extent to which these observa-
tions in mice translate to humans remains unclear, protection studies 
in non-human primates, which share a placental architecture similar 
to humans, seem warranted. If the results were consistent, ZIKV-117 
or human antibodies with similar profiles10,19 could be developed as a 
treatment measure during pregnancy for at-risk humans. By  
defining 
key epitopes on the E protein associated with antibody-mediated 
 
protection, our studies also inform vaccine efforts to design new immu-
nogens that elicit highly protective antibody responses against ZIKV.

Research subjects. We studied eight subjects in the United States with previous or 
recent ZIKV infection (Extended Data Table 2). The studies were approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of Vanderbilt University Medical Center; samples were 
obtained after informed consent was obtained by the Vanderbilt Clinical Trials 
Center. Two subjects (972 and 973) were infected with an African lineage strain in 
2008 (one subject while working in Senegal, the second acquired the infection by 
sexual transmission from the first, as previously reported24). The other six subjects 
were infected during the current outbreak of an Asian lineage strain, following 
exposure in Brazil, Mexico or Haiti.
Generation and quantification of human B-cell lines secreting ZIKV E 
 
protein specific antibodies. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 
 
heparinized blood were isolated with Ficoll-Histopaque by density gradient 
 
centrifugation. The cells were used immediately or cryopreserved in 
the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen until use. Ten million PBMCs were 
 
cultured in 384-well plates (Nunc) using culture medium (ClonaCell-HY 
Medium A, StemCell Technologies) supplemented with 8 μ 
g ml−1 of the 
TLR agonist CpG  
(phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotide 
ZOEZOEZZZZZOEEZOEZZZT, Invitrogen), 3 μ 
g ml−1 of Chk2 inhibitor 
(Sigma), 1 μ 
g ml−1 of cyclosporine A (Sigma), and clarified supernatants from 
cultures of B95.8 cells (ATCC) containing Epstein–Barr virus. After 7 days, cells 
from each 384-well culture plate were expanded into four 96-well culture plates 
(Falcon) using ClonaCell-HY Medium A containing 8 μ 
g ml−1 of CpG, 3 μ 
g ml−1 
of Chk2  
inhibitor, and 107 irradiated heterologous human PBMCs (Nashville 
Red Cross) and cultured for an additional 4 days. Supernatants were screened in 
ELISA (described below) for reactivity with various ZIKV E proteins, which are 
described below. The minimal frequency of ZIKV E-reactive B cells was estimated 
based on the number of wells with E protein-reactive supernatants compared 
with the total number of lymphoblastoid cell line colonies in the transformation 
plates  
(calculation: E-reactive B-cell frequency = 
 (number of wells with E-reactive 
 
supernatants) divided by (number of LCL colonies in the plate) × 100).
Protein expression and purification. The ectodomains of ZIKV E (H/PF/2013; 
GenBank Accession KJ776791) and the fusion-loop mutant E-FLM  
(containing 
four mutations: T76A, Q77G, W101R, L107R) were expressed transiently in 
Expi293F cells and purified as described previously7. ZIKV DIII (residues 
299–407 of strain H/PF/2013), WNV DIII (residues 296–405 of strain New York 
1999) and DENV-2 DIII (residues 299-410 of strain 16681) were expressed in 
BL21 (DE3) as inclusion bodies and refolded in vitro25. Briefly, inclusion bodies 
were  
denatured and refolded by gradual dilution into a refolding buffer (400 mM 
l- 
arginine, 100 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 2 mM EDTA, 5 and 0.5 mM reduced and 
 
oxidized glutathione) at 4 °C. Refolded proteins were purified by size-exclusion 
 
chromatography using a Superdex 75, 16/60 (GE Healthcare).
Generation of human hybridomas. Cells from wells with transformed B cells 
containing supernatants that exhibited reactivity to ZIKV E protein were fused with 
HMMA2.5 myeloma cells (gift from L. Cavacini) using an established  
electrofusion 
technique26. After fusion, hybridomas were suspended in a selection medium 
 
containing 100 μ 
M hypoxanthine, 0.4 μ 
M aminopterin, 16 μ 
M thymidine (HAT 
Media Supplement, Sigma), and 7 μ 
g ml−1 ouabain (Sigma) and cultured in 384-
well plates for 18 days before screening hybridomas for antibody production by 
ELISA. After fusion with HMMA2.5 myeloma cells, hybridomas producing ZIKV 
E-specific antibodies were cloned biologically by single-cell fluorescence-activated 
cell sorting. Hybridomas were expanded in post-fusion medium (ClonaCell-HY 
Medium E, STEMCELL Technologies) until 50% confluent in 75-cm2 flasks 
(Corning).
For antibody production, cells from one 75-cm2 flask were collected with a cell 
scraper and expanded to four 225-cm2 flasks (Corning) in serum-free medium 
(Hybridoma-SFM, Life Technologies). After 21 days, supernatants were clarified 
by centrifugation and filtered using 0.45-μ 
m pore size filter devices. HiTrap Protein 
G or HiTrap MabSelectSure columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) were used to 
purify antibodies from filtered supernatants.
Sequence analysis of antibody variable region genes. Total cellular RNA was 
extracted from pelleted cells from hybridoma clones, and an RT–PCR reaction 
was performed using mixtures of primers designed to amplify all heavy-chain or 
light-chain antibody variable regions27. The generated PCR products were purified 
using AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) and sequenced directly 
using an ABI3700 automated DNA sequencer. The variable region sequences of 
the heavy and light chains were analysed using the IMGT/V-Quest program28,29.
ELISA and EC50 binding analysis. Wells of microtitre plates were coated with 
purified, recombinant ectodomain of ZIKV E, DIII, DIII-LR mutants (DIII 
 
containing A310E and T335K mutations) or DIII of related flaviviruses DENV-2 
or WNV and incubated at 4 °C overnight. In ELISA studies with purified mAbs, 
we used recombinant ZIKV E protein ectodomain with His6 tag produced in Sf9 
insect cells (Meridian Life Sciences R01635). Plates were blocked with 5% skimmed 
milk in PBS-T for 1 h. B-cell culture supernatants or purified antibodies were added 
to the wells and incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature. The bound antibodies 
were detected using goat anti-human IgG (γ 
-specific) conjugated with alkaline 
phosphatase (Southern Biotech) and pNPP disodium salt hexahydrate substrate 
(Sigma). In ELISAs that assessed binding of mAbs to DIII and DIII LR mutants, 
we used previously described murine mAbs ZV-2 and ZV-54 (ref. 7) as controls. 
A goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotech) 
was used for detection of these antibodies. Colour development was monitored at 
405 nm in a spectrophotometer (Biotek). For determining EC50, microtitre plates 
were coated with ZIKV E or E-FLM that eliminated interaction of fusion-loop 
 
specific antibodies. Purified antibodies were diluted serially and applied to the 
plates. Bound antibodies were detected as above. A nonlinear regression analysis 
was performed on the resulting curves using Prism (GraphPad) to calculate EC50 
values.
ELISA for detection of human antibodies in murine tissues. Fetal head and 
placental tissues were collected at E13.5 from groups treated with ZIKV-117 or PBS 
(as a negative control), homogenized in PBS (250 μ 
l) and stored at − 
20 °C. ELISA 
plates were coated with ZIKV E protein, and thawed, clarified tissue homogenates 
were applied undiluted in triplicate. Bound antibodies were detected using goat 
anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. 
The quantity of antibody was determined by comparison with a standard curve 
 
constructed using purified ZIKV-117 in a dilution series.
Biolayer interferometry competition binding assay. His6-tagged ZIKV E 
 
protein was immobilized on anti-His coated biosensor tips (Pall) for 2 min on an 
Octet Red biosensor instrument. After measuring the baseline signal in kinetics 
buffer (PBS, 0.01% BSA, and 0.002% Tween 20) for 1 min, biosensor tips were 
immersed into the wells containing first antibody at a concentration of 10 μ 
g ml−1 
for 7 min. Biosensors then were immersed into wells containing a second mAb at 
a  
concentration of 10 μ 
g ml−1 for 7 min. The signal obtained for binding of the 
second antibody in the presence of the first antibody was expressed as a percentage 
of the uncompeted binding of the second antibody that was derived independently. 
The antibodies were considered competing if the presence of first antibody 
reduced the signal of the second antibody to less than 30% of its maximal binding 
and non-competing if the signal was greater than 70%. A level of 30–70% was 
 
considered intermediate competition.
Shotgun mutagenesis epitope mapping. Epitope mapping was performed 
by shotgun mutagenesis essentially as described previously6. A ZIKV prM/E 
 
protein expression construct (based on ZIKV strain SPH2015) was subjected 
to high-throughput alanine scanning mutagenesis to generate a comprehensive 
mutation library. Each residue within prM/E was changed to alanine, with  
alanine 
codons mutated to serine. In total, 672 ZIKV prM/E mutants were generated (100% 
coverage), sequence confirmed, and arrayed into 384-well plates. Each ZIKV 
prM/E mutant was transfected into HEK-293T cells and allowed to express for 22 h. 
Cells were fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences), 
and permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS plus calcium 
and magnesium (PBS+ 
+ 
). Cells were incubated with purified mAbs diluted in 
PBS+ 
+ 
, 10% normal goat serum (Sigma), and 0.1% saponin. Primary antibody 
screening concentrations were determined using an independent immunofluores-
cence titration curve against wild-type ZIKV prM/E to ensure that signals were 
within the linear range of detection. Antibodies were detected using 3.75 μ 
g ml−1 
of AlexaFluor488-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch 
Laboratories) in 10% NGS/0.1% saponin. Cells were washed three times with 
PBS+ 
+ 
/0.1% saponin followed by two washes in PBS. Mean cellular  
fluorescence 
was detected using a high-throughput flow cytometer (HTFC, Intellicyt). Antibody 
reactivity against each mutant prM/E clone was calculated relative to wild-type 
prM/E protein reactivity by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected 
 
controls and normalizing to the signal from wild-type prM/E-transfected controls. 
Mutations within clones were identified as critical to the mAb epitope if they did 
not support reactivity of the test MAb, but supported reactivity of other ZIKV 
antibodies. This counter-screen strategy facilitates the exclusion of prM/E mutants 
that are locally misfolded or have an expression defect.

was provided by S. Whitehead (Bethesda) and originally obtained from P. F. C. 
Vasconcelos (Instituto Evandro Cargas). ZIKV MR 766 (Uganda, 1947), Malaysia 
P6740 (1966), and Dakar 41519 (Senegal, 1982) were provided by the World 
Reference Center or Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (R. Tesh, University of 
Texas Medical Branch). Nicaraguan DENV strains (DENV-1 1254-4, DENV-2 
172-08, DENV-3 N2845-09, and DENV-4 N703-99) were provided generously 
by E. Harris (University of California, Berkeley). Virus stocks were propagated 
in C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells (DENV) or Vero cells (ZIKV). ZIKV Dakar 41519 
(ZIKV-Dakar) was passaged twice in vivo in Rag1−/− mice (M. Gorman and 
 
M. Diamond, unpublished data) to create a mouse-adapted strain. Virus stocks 
were titrated by focus-forming assay (FFA) on Vero cells. All cell lines were checked 
regularly for mycoplasma contamination and were negative. Cell lines were authen-
ticated at acquisition with short tandem repeat method profiling; Vero cells, though 
commonly misidentified in the field, were used as they are the standard cell line 
for flavivirus titration.
Neutralization assays. Serial dilutions of mAbs were incubated with 102 FFU 
of different ZIKV strains (MR 766, Dakar 41519, Malaysia P6740, H/PF/2013, 
or Brazil Paraiba 2015) for 1 h at 37 °C. The mAb–virus complexes were added 
to Vero cell monolayers in 96-well plates for 90 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells 
were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM supplemented with 4% 
heat- 
inactivated FBS. Plates were fixed 40 h later with 1% PFA in PBS for 1 h at 
room temperature. The plates were incubated sequentially with 500 ng ml−1 mouse 
 
anti-ZIKV (ZV-16, E.F. and M.S.D., unpublished data) and horseradish- 
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in PBS supplemented with 0.1% 
(w/v) saponin (Sigma) and 0.1% BSA. ZIKV-infected cell foci were visualized using 
TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and quantitated on an ImmunoSpot 5.0.37 
 
macroanalyzer (Cellular Technologies).
mAb binding to ZIKV- or DENV-infected cells. C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells 
were inoculated with a MOI 0.01 of ZIKV (H/PF/2013) or different DENV sero-
types (Nicaraguan strains DENV-1 1254-4, DENV-2 172-08, DENV-3 N2845-09, 
 
DENV-4 N703-99). At 120 h post infection, cells were fixed with 4% PFA diluted in 
PBS for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with HBSS  
supplemented 
with 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% saponin and 0.025% NaN3 for 10 min at room 
 
temperature. 50,000 cells were transferred to U-bottom plates and incubated for 
30 min at 4 °C with 5 μ 
g ml−1 of anti-ZIKV human mAbs or negative (hCHK-152)12, 
or positive (hE60)30 isotype controls. After washing, cells were incubated with 
Alexa-Fluor-647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Invitrogen) at 1:500, fixed 
in 1% PFA in PBS, processed on MACSQuant Analyzed (Miltenyi Biotec), and 
 
analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Recombinant antibody expression and purification. Total RNA was extracted 
from hybridoma cells and genes encoding the VH and VL domains were amplified 
in RT–PCR using IgExp primers31. The PCR products were directly cloned into 
antibody expression vectors containing the constant domains of wild-type γ 
1 chain, 
LALA mutant (leucine (L) to alanine (A) substitution at positions 234 and 235) 
 
γ 
1 chain for the VH domains, and wild-type κ chain for the VL domain in an iso-
thermal amplification reaction (Gibson reaction)32. Plasmids encoding the heavy 
and light chain were transfected into 293F cells and full-length recombinant IgG 
was secreted into transfected cell supernatants. Supernatants were collected and 
IgG purified using Protein G chromatography and eluted into PBS. The functional 
abrogation of the binding of the LALA variant IgG was confirmed in an ELISA 
binding assay with recombinant human Fcγ 
RI. The binding of wild-type ZIKV-
117 or LALA antibody to Fcγ 
RI was evaluated, in comparison with the binding 
pattern of control antibodies (human mAb CKV063 (ref. 33) LALA mutated IgG).
Adult mouse lethal protection experiments. C57BL/6 male mice (4–5-week-old, 
Jackson Laboratories) were inoculated with 103 FFU of mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar 
by subcutaneous route in the footpad. One-day before infection, mice were treated 
with 2 mg anti-Ifnar1 mAb (MAR1-5A3, Leinco Technologies) by intraperitoneal 
injection. ZIKV-specific human mAb (ZIKV-117) or an isotype control (hCHK-
152) was administered as a single dose at day + 
1 (100 μ 
g) or day + 
5 (250 μ 
g) 
 
after infection through an intraperitoneal route. Animals were monitored for 
21 days.
Pregnant mouse protection experiments. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were bred 
in a specific pathogen-free facility at Washington University School of Medicine. 
 
(1) Ifnar1−/− dams, prophylaxis studies: Ifnar1−/− female and wild-type male mice 
were mated; at E5.5, dams were treated with a single 250 μ 
g dose of ZIKV mAb or 
isotype control by intraperitoneal injection. At E6.5, mice were inoculated with 
103 FFU of ZIKV Brazil Paraiba 2015 by subcutaneous injection in the footpad. 
 
(2) Wild-type dams, prophylaxis studies: wild-type female and male mice were 
mated; at embryonic days E5.5, dams were treated with a single 250 μ 
g dose 
of ZIKV mAb or isotype control by intraperitoneal injection as well as a 1 mg 
 
injection of anti-Ifnar1 (MAR1-5A3). At E6.5, mice were inoculated with 103 FFU 
of mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar by subcutaneous injection in the footpad. At E7.5, 
dams received a second 1 mg dose of anti-Ifnar1 through an intraperitoneal route. 
 
(3) Wild-type dams, therapy studies: wild-type female and male mice were mated; 
at embryonic days E5.5, dams were treated with a 1 mg injection of anti-Ifnar1 
(MAR1-5A3). At E6.5, mice were inoculated with mouse-adapted 103 FFU of 
ZIKV-Dakar by subcutaneous injection in the footpad. At E7.5, dams received a 
second 1 mg dose of anti-Ifnar1 as well as a single 250 μ 
g dose of ZIKV mAb or 
isotype control through an intraperitoneal route. All animals were euthanized at 
E13.5, and placentas, fetuses and maternal tissues were collected. Fetus size was 
measured as the crown-rump length × occipitofrontal diameter of the head.
Measurement of viral burden. ZIKV-infected tissues were weighed and 
 
homogenized with stainless steel beads in a Bullet Blender instrument (Next 
Advance) in 200 μ 
l of PBS. Samples were clarified by centrifugation (2,000g for 
10 min). All homogenized tissues from infected animals were stored at − 
20 °C. 
Tissue samples and serum from ZIKV-infected mice were extracted with RNeasy 
96 Kit (tissues) or Viral RNA Mini Kit (serum) (Qiagen). ZIKV RNA levels were 
determined by TaqMan one-step quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT–
PCR) on an ABI7500 Fast Instrument using published primers and conditions34. 
Viral burden was expressed on a log10 scale as viral RNA equivalents per g or ml 
after comparison with a standard curve produced using serial tenfold dilutions 
of ZIKV RNA.
Viral RNA in situ hybridization. RNA in situ hybridization was performed with 
RNAscope 2.5 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. PFA-fixed paraffin embedded placental sections were deparaffinized 
by incubation for 60 min at 60 °C. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 
H2O2 for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were boiled for 15 min in RNAscope 
Target Retrieval Reagents and incubated for 30 min in RNAscope Protease Plus 
before probe hybridization. The probe targeting ZIKV RNA was designed and 
synthesized by Advanced Cell Diagnostics (catalogue number 467771). Negative 
(targeting bacterial gene dapB) control probes were also obtained from Advanced 
Cell Diagnostics (catalogue number 310043). Tissues were counterstained with 
Gill’s haematoxylin and visualized with standard bright-field microscopy.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Collected placentas were fixed in 10% 
neutral buffered formalin at room temperature and embedded in paraffin. At least 
three placentas from different litters with the indicated treatments were sectioned 
and stained with haematoxylin and eosin to assess morphology. Surface area and 
thickness of placenta and different layers were measured using Image J software. 
For immunofluorescence staining on mouse placentas, deparaffinized tissues 
were blocked in blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.3% Triton, PBS) for 2 h and incubated 
with anti-vimentin antibody (1:500, rabbit, Abcam ab92547). Secondary antibody 
 
conjugated with Alexa 488 (1:500 in PBS) was applied for 1 h at room temperature. 
Samples were counterstained with DAPI (4′ 
6′ 
-diamidino-2-phenilindole, 1:1,000 
dilution).
Statistical analysis. All virological data were analysed with GraphPad Prism 
 
software. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were analysed by the log rank test, and 
viraemia was compared using an ANOVA with a multiple comparisons test. 
P < 0.05 indicated statistically significant differences.

Extended Data Figure 2 | High resolution epitope mapping of ZIKV 
mAbs. a, An alanine scanning mutation library for ZIKV envelope 
protein was constructed, in which each amino acid of prM/E was mutated 
individually to alanine (and alanine to serine) and expression constructs 
arrayed into 384-well plates, one mutation per well. Each clone in the 
ZIKV prM/E mutation library, expressed in HEK-293T cells, was tested 
for immunoreactivity with five mAbs from competition groups A–D, 
measured using an Intellicyt high-throughput flow cytometer. Shown here 
for each of the five mAbs is the reactivity with the ZIKV E protein mutants 
that identified the epitope residues for these mAbs. mAb reactivity for 
each alanine mutant are expressed as percent of the reactivity of mAb with 
wild-type ZIKV prM/E. Clones with reactivity < 
30% relative to wild-type 
ZIKV prM/E were identified as critical for mAb binding. Bars represent 
the mean and range of at least two replicate data points. Binding of group 
B mAbs, ZIKV-116 to wild-type ZIKV E DIII (b) or DIII LR mutant (c) 
was compared with mouse mAbs ZV-2 and ZV-54. Binding of ZIKV-116 
was decreased by mutations in DIII-LR. Data plotted are mean ± s.d.

Extended Data Figure 4 | Detection of human IgG in placenta or fetal 
head tissues in ZIKV-117- or PBS-treated pregnant mice. As described 
in Fig. 3, wild-type female mice were mated with wild-type sires and 
monitored for pregnancy. At E5.5, dams were treated with anti-Ifnar1  
mAb and PBS or 250 μ 
g of ZIKV-117. One day later (E6.5), dams were 
inoculated with 103 FFU of ZIKV-Dakar. Fetuses and placentas  
(n =

human IgG by ELISA. Human antibody in tissues was captured on ELISA 
plates coated with ZIKV E protein and detected using goat anti-human 
IgG (Fc-specific) antibody. The quantity of antibody was determined by 
comparison with a standard curve constructed using purified ZIKV-117 
in a dilution series. Four replicate measurements were performed for each 
mouse tissue and the results were averaged. The graphs represent the 
mean + s.e.m. from 3 mice per group.

As described in Fig. 3a, Ifnar1−/− female mice were mated with wild-type 
sires and monitored for pregnancy. At E5.5, dams were treated with  
250 μ 
g of either hCHK-152 isotype control or ZIKV-117. At E6.5, dams 
were inoculated with 103 FFU of ZIKV-Brazil. Collected placentas were 
fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin at ambient temperature and 
embedded in paraffin. At least three placentas from different litters  
with the indicated treatments were sectioned for in situ hybridization 
staining using negative or ZIKV-specific RNA probes. Low (scale bar,  
500 μ 
m) and high (scale bar, 50 μ 
m) power images are presented  
in sequence.
