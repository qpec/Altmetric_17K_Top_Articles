a systematic review

Abstract
Background: Dementia risk reduction is a major and growing public health priority. While certain modifiable risk
factors for dementia have been identified, there remains a substantial proportion of unexplained risk. There is
evidence that environmental risk factors may explain some of this risk. Thus, we present the first comprehensive
systematic review of environmental risk factors for dementia.
Methods: We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases from their inception to January 2016,
bibliographies of review articles, and articles related to publically available environmental data. Articles were included if
they examined the association between an environmental risk factor and dementia. Studies with another outcome (for
example, cognition), a physiological measure of the exposure, case studies, animal studies, and studies of nutrition
were excluded. Data were extracted from individual studies which were, in turn, appraised for methodological quality.
The strength and consistency of the overall evidence for each risk factor identified was assessed.
Results: We screened 4784 studies and included 60 in the review. Risk factors were considered in six categories: air
quality, toxic heavy metals, other metals, other trace elements, occupational-related exposures, and miscellaneous
environmental factors. Few studies took a life course approach. There is at least moderate evidence implicating the
following risk factors: air pollution; aluminium; silicon; selenium; pesticides; vitamin D deficiency; and electric and
magnetic fields.
Conclusions: Studies varied widely in size and quality and therefore we must be circumspect in our conclusions.
Nevertheless, this extensive review suggests that future research could focus on a short list of environmental risk
factors for dementia. Furthermore, further robust, longitudinal studies with repeated measures of environmental
exposures are required to confirm these associations.

Background
Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive and functional de-
cline, commonly occurring in later life as a result of neu-
rodegenerative and cerebrovascular processes beginning
earlier in the life course [1, 2]. It is a major and growing
public health concern with substantial increases projected
in the future, particularly in low-to-middle income coun-
tries [3–5]. Furthermore, there is now a consensus that a
substantial proportion of cases are potentially preventable
[6–9]. Preventing or, perhaps more realistically, delaying
the clinical onset of dementia would have a substantial ef-
fect on disease numbers [10–12]. It has been suggested
that approximately a third of Alzheimer’s dementia cases
could be attributed to seven potentially modifiable risk
factors: diabetes, midlife hypertension and obesity, smok-
ing, depression, cognitive inactivity, and low educational
attainment [13, 14]. Adding to this amount of risk ex-
plained estimates of population attributable fractions
derived from genetic factors [15], it is likely that a large
proportion of variance in dementia risk remains unex-
plained. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify
further potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia.
There is evidence from studying geographical variation
in dementia rates that environmental risk factors may also
be important in the pathogenesis of dementia [16–19].

 Two previous reviews have reported on environmental
risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease: both concluded that
aluminium in drinking water and electromagnetic fields
were important and one also highlighted occupational ex-
posure to solvents and pesticides [20, 21]. However, both
these reviews focused on Alzheimer’s disease rather than
all-cause dementia and neither of them used robust, sys-
tematic review methodology and so may not have covered
all potentially important risk factors. Thus, we present the
first comprehensive systematic review on environmental
risk factors for dementia.
Methods
Information sources
We identified studies using three approaches. First, we
conducted an electronic search of the PubMed and Web
of Science databases from their start to January 2016
(Appendix 1). This search returned relevant primary stud-
ies and review articles. Second, we scrutinised bibliograph-
ies of included studies and review articles for additional
studies which had not been identified by the search. Third,
we reviewed a small number of hand-picked studies,
based on our knowledge of the literature from scrutiny of
articles related to publically available environmental data.
Search strategy
A shortlist of environmental factors was created based
on previous work investigating environmental risk factors
on health in general [22]. We also included factors not in-
cluded in the general list which we knew had been linked
to dementia risk, such as trace elements (for example, sel-
enium [23]). Thus, the list of environmental factors which
we searched for were air pollution, climate, ultraviolet ra-
diation, green space, industrial pollution, water quality,
noise pollution, low-frequency and radiofrequency radi-
ation, radon, nuclear facilities, contamination, and trace
elements.
Screening & eligibility
Records returned from the search were screened based
on titles and abstracts for suitability. Conference proceed-
ings, books and editorial publications were excluded. Of
the remaining studies, articles were then selected if they
reported an association (including null associations) be-
tween an environmental factor and any dementia.
The main exclusion criteria were: animal studies; single
case studies; studies where the exposure was a physio-
logical measure which could not be directly linked with
the environment, for example autopsy studies measuring
levels of trace elements in the brain or measuring serum
levels of a substance; studies with outcomes other than
clinical dementia, e.g. cognitive decline; studies of specific
symptoms or features (e.g. inflammation, oxidative stress)
of dementia rather than the full dementia syndrome;
studies where the exposure was solely nutritional; or
where insufficient data were reported in the paper. Since
we have recently published a systematic review and meta-
analysis on the association between rurality and urbanicity
on dementia [16], we did not consider this in the present
review. Relevant review studies were carefully examined
and additional primary articles not identified in the search
were included (see below for definition). However, if a
review reported multiple new studies, we included the
review as a single source of evidence, summarising its
findings rather than including every study individually
(for example, Loef and Walach, 2012 [24] included 101
individual studies). We refer to the review studies in
the main text and, where relevant, performed additional
focused searches to identify any more recent articles
which would have been included in these reviews. We also
reported the most recent report from studies, removing
any earlier report(s) (e.g., Rondeau et al., 2000 [25]).
Quality of evidence
Individual studies were appraised for quality. Large, pro-
spective longitudinal studies with a robust measure of
the risk factor in question at baseline and a clinical diag-
nosis of dementia were classified as being of quality level
A. High quality cross-sectional studies (i.e., a large sample
size with robust exposure and outcome measures) were
considered level B quality, and studies which did not reach
this level were considered level C quality. The total evi-
dence for an individual risk factor was synthesised to
conclude whether there is strong, moderate, or weak
evidence for an association (or lack of an association)
between the risk factor and dementia or whether there
is insufficient evidence to come to a conclusion. The
criteria for each level of strength are given in Table 1.
The reporting of this systematic review conforms to the
PRIMSA guidelines [26].
Results
The PRISMA diagram for the process of screening and
selecting records is shown in Fig. 1. From an initial total
of 6665 studies returned from the searches, after remov-
ing duplicates across the environmental factors, 4784
studies were screened for suitability. Of these, 60 were
identified as eligible for inclusion.
Table 2 shows the synthesised evidence from all studies
with a global judgement about the strength of the evi-
dence for an association from all published studies. The
environmental risk factors under consideration fall into
the following six groups: air quality, toxic heavy metals,
other metals, other trace elements, occupational-related
exposures, and miscellaneous environmental factors.
Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 summarise individual studies
providing evidence for each risk factor in each category.
The tables are organised alphabetically by exposure

 with higher quality studies being reported first within
this grouping and included review studies last of all.
Air quality
Studies of the association between environmental risk fac-
tors in air and dementia are summarised in Table 3. Higher
levels of nitrogen oxides were observed to be associated
with increased dementia risk in two prospective cohort
studies: a 15 year prospective cohort study of 1806 healthy
men and women in Umeå, Sweden, and a retrospective co-
hort study of almost thirty thousand individuals identified
from the comprehensive Taiwanese health insurance data-
base passively followed up for a decade [27, 28]. However,
only the prospective study observed a dose–response pat-
tern of association (adjusted HR per 10 μg/m3 increase in
nitrogen oxides, 95 % CI 1.05, 0.98, 1.12) [27]. This study
grouped nitrogen oxides into the following cut-offs: 9, 17,
and 26 μg/m3. The other study only observed an increased
risk in the highest quartile and used the following cut-offs
for NO2 concentration: 6652.3, 8349.0, and 9825.5 parts
per billion [28]. The discrepancy in the pattern of observa-
tion observed in these two studies can be explained by the
fact that the former explored higher levels of NOx – the
highest cut-off from the latter study (~10 parts per million)
approximately corresponds to the lowest cut-off from the
former study (~10 mg/L ≡ μg/m3). The latter study also
investigated carbon monoxide concentration and found a
dose–response association with dementia risk for this ex-
posure (adjusted HR compared to the lowest quartile, 95 %
CI: 1.07, 0.92-1.25; 1.37, 1.19-1.58; 1.61, 1.39-1.85) [28].
Similar patterns were seen for men and women separately.
Environmental tobacco smoke was shown to be asso-
ciated with dementia risk in a cross-sectional study of al-
most 6000 people in five provinces of China [29]. These
investigators asked participants about exposure to envir-
onmental tobacco smoke at home, work, and in other
locations, duration of exposure as well as estimating cu-
mulative exposure. Rather than a clinical diagnosis, these
investigators used the GMS-AGECAT algorithm which
has been widely used in epidemiological studies, includ-
ing the MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies
[30, 31]. Higher levels of exposure were associated with
an increased risk of severe dementia (O3-5) but not mod-
erate dementia (O1-2). The cut off for moderate dementia
used in this study showed only a positive predictive value
of 68.6 % but the cut off used for severe dementia per-
formed much better (88.1 %) [32]. The cumulative dose
analysis showed a dose–response association (adjusted
HR compared to a cumulative dose of zero for groups
>0-24, 25–49, 50–74, 75–99, ≥100, 95 % CI: 0.99, 0.76-
Table 1 Definitions of the strength of the reported association
between individual risk factors and dementia
Strong evidence for environmental risk factor
There is a reported association with dementia in the majority of
published papers.
Moderate or weak evidence for environmental risk factor
Although the reported association with dementia is not seen in the
majority of published papers, at least one published paper (or only
one) supports the association.
Weak evidence may come from a single, poorly designed study.
No evidence for environmental risk factor
No association with dementia has been revealed either due to a lack
of relevant research or the observed effect is not seen as significant.

 1.28; 1.15, 0.93-1.42; 1.18, 0.87-1.59; 1.39, 1.03-1.84;
1.95, 1.34-2.83). Also, all effect sizes were larger in
never smokers than when ex-smokers were included.
A prospective Taiwanese study following almost a mil-
lion people over ten years found an association between
baseline ozone but not particulate matter up to 2.5 μm
in diameter (PM2.5) and incident Alzheimer’s dementia
[33]. However, change in exposure to both pollutants
during follow up was associated with a two-to-three-fold
increased risk of incident AD. A final cross-sectional
study of 871 people in Taiwan also examined both par-
ticulate matter (PM10) and ozone concentration at the
participant’s home address, finding increased Alzhei-
mer’s dementia risk in the second and third tertiles of
PM10 concentrations (adjusted OR, 95 % CI: 1.68, 0.94-
3.00; 4.17, 2.31-7.54; Ptrend < 0.001) but only in the high-
est tertile of ozone concentrations (0.60, 0.33-1.09; 2.00,
1.14-3.50; Ptrend = 0.03) [34]. They found similar patterns
of association with vascular dementia.
Thus, the evidence for airborne environmental risk
factors for dementia is consistent in the direction of as-
sociation for all exposures and the overall strength of
evidence, while based on relatively few studies, is moder-
ate to strong.
Toxic heavy metals
Table 4 summarises the studies linking toxic heavy metals
to dementia risk. There were two studies of arsenic, one
of which was of grade-B quality and found no association
with dementia; the grade-C study found increased rates of
dementia in areas with higher soil arsenic levels but this
country-level simulation is less informative about risk fac-
tors in individuals [35, 36]. A case–control study with 129
people in each group found that an excess of people with
Alzheimer’s dementia were born in areas with higher than
average lead concentrations [37].
Overall, there was relatively little extant evidence for an
association between toxic heavy metals and dementia risk.
Other metals
Table 5 summarises the studies focused on other metals
and dementia risk. Aluminium was the most studied
metal, with sixteen studies investigating its relationship
with dementia including almost 22,000 people with de-
mentia. The only high quality study – a prospective co-
hort study of almost four thousand older adults in
south-west France (the PAQUID study [38]) – found
that levels of aluminium consumption in drinking water
in excess of 0.1 mg per day were associated with a doub-
ling of dementia risk and a three-fold increase in the risk
of Alzheimer’s dementia [39]. Of the remaining thirteen
moderate quality studies, six found an association be-
tween increased aluminium levels in drinking water and
increased dementia risk [40–45], four found no associ-
ation [37, 46–48], and one found a protective effect of
higher soil levels of aluminium [49]. In general, the lar-
ger studies showed a positive association and the smaller
studies showed a null effect.
A prospective cohort study compared calcium levels
in tap water with risk of developing Alzheimer’s dementia.
However, it is unclear if their not mentioning calcium as a
predictor means that they failed to examine it or if it did
not emerge from the models as an independent predictor.
A cross-sectional study found no association between co-
balt and dementia risk [37, 50]. Two case–control studies
and one review article summarising 101 studies consid-
ered copper and iron in relation to dementia [24, 37, 49].
The findings regarding copper were inconclusive. How-
ever, they reported that higher soil levels of iron were as-
sociated with an increased risk of dementia [37, 49]. The
review article was inconclusive [24].
An excess of people with Alzheimer’s dementia
were born in areas with higher than average levels of
manganese in a cross-sectional study [37]. The same
study found no evidence for an association between
molybdenum, nickel, uranium, or zinc with dementia
risk [37]. However, another study found that higher zinc
levels in the soil was associated with an increased risk of
Alzheimer’s dementia [49].
It is challenging to synthesise the published reports on
the association between metals and dementia, and the
published evidence for an individual element is often
weak and/or contradictory. However, there is at least some
evidence that calcium, cobalt, molybdenum, nickel, and

 uranium are not associated with an increased risk of de-
mentia, but this is often based on minimal evidence. One
prospective study and the larger cross-sectional studies
tend to support an association between aluminium and
dementia risk [39–41, 44].
Other trace elements
Table 6 shows the studies investigating links between
other trace elements and dementia. A cross-sectional
study extrapolated from the medical records of 160 people
to estimate annual dementia incidence and found the area
with the highest fluoride concentrations in public water
supplies had the lowest incidence [51]. Selenium has been
the focus of a number of studies. The included review art-
icle [23] referred to a randomised, controlled trial of
selenium supplementation to reduce dementia risk, the
PREADVISE trial, but this seems to have converted
into an observational study and is yet to report on selen-
ium levels [52–54]. The review also referred to a confer-
ence abstract reporting a prospective cohort study [55],
but subsequent reports do not focus on selenium [56]. In
general, this review article reported mixed findings from
15 case–control studies and 24 autopsy studies [23].
One cross-sectional study found no differences in aver-
age levels of silicon in drinking water between a group of
people with Alzheimer’s dementia and several neurological
control groups [46]. On the other hand, two prospective
cohort studies found an association between higher levels
of silica in drinking water and dementia incidence [39, 57].
However, a case–control study did not corroborate these
findings [48].
The evidence for other trace elements is again mixed
and generally weak in strength.
Occupational-related exposures
Table 7 summarises the individual studies relating occupa-
tional exposures to dementia risk. Four studies investi-
gated occupational exposure to aluminium in relation to
dementia [58–61]. These tended to be small with conse-
quently low statistical power. Their results were mixed.
The prospective Manitoba Study of Health and Aging
studied a variety of exposures but the only robust associ-
ation they found was an increased risk of dementia in rela-
tion to self-reported exposure to defoliants/fumigants
[62]. The same study reported null associations in all
other exposures studied, apart from a protective effect
of excessive noise and increased risk associated with
radiation exposure. However, in both these cases, only
one person with dementia had been exposed to noise or
radiation and so there is very limited statistical power. A
case-cohort study of 1552 people dying with non-vascular
dementia found no association between exposure to
diesel motor exhaust fumes and dementia but mixed
evidence for extremely low frequency magnetic fields
or electric shocks [63]. Two reviews concluded that ex-
posure to pesticides was associated with an increased risk
of dementia which was corroborated by the prospective
Canadian Study of Health and Aging, Cache County
Study, the PAQUID study, and to some extent a retro-
spective British study of farmers but not by the Manitoba
study or a case–control study from Québec; a study from
the Netherlands had mixed findings [62–70]. A systematic
review found no support for an association between occu-
pational exposure to lead and dementia and mixed evi-
dence (predominantly null) between solvent exposure and
dementia [68]. A case–control study from the USA found
an association between solvent exposure and AD, at least
in men [71]. However, a case-cohort study from the
Netherlands found mixed associations between solvents
and dementia, perhaps reflecting the diversity of chemicals
described as solvents [63].
The evidence linking occupational exposures and de-
mentia is frequently weak. Aside from the mixed evidence
for solvents, the strongest evidence is for exposure to
pesticides, but even findings in that literature are mixed.
However, there seems to be no published evidence sug-
gesting that occupational exposure to diesel motor ex-
haust, lead, inks/dyes, paints/stains/varnishes, gasoline/
fuels/oils, liquid plastics/rubbers, or vibratory tools
affect dementia risk.
Miscellaneous environmental factors
Table 8 summarises studies linking miscellaneous envir-
onmental exposures and dementia. One study reported
no association between climate and dementia admissions
[72]. Two systematic reviews examined low and extremely
low frequency electric and magnetic fields and, while
the evidence is mixed, there seems to be an association
with dementia risk and this was corroborated by a pro-
spective study in Switzerland which found that living close
to power lines for over 15 years was associated with a
doubling of Alzheimer’s disease mortality (but not the oc-
cupational study mentioned above [63]) [73, 74]. Its find-
ings are difficult to interpret, but a prospective study in
Denmark found that mobile phone subscription was
associated with a decreased risk of subsequent hospital
admission with dementia [75]. Three high quality pro-
spective studies (including 11,884 people of whom 691 de-
veloped dementia) examined the association between
vitamin D and dementia and all found that lower vitamin
D levels at baseline were associated with an increased risk
of developing dementia [76–78]. However, this finding
was not corroborated by a small case–control study (40 in
each group) of people with mild dementia [79]. Finally,
one study noted that the area with the highest dementia
mortality had the lowest drinking water pH [42].
Out of the miscellaneous exposures considered in this
section, there seems to be strong evidence that vitamin
Killin et al. BMC Geriatrics  (2016) 16:175 
Page 22 of 28
 D deficiency is associated with increased risk of demen-
tia and moderate evidence implicating electric and mag-
netic fields. There is no published evidence supporting
any role for weather parameters in dementia risk.
Discussion
Main findings
In summary, we found moderate evidence for air pollution
exposures being related to dementia risk, particularly nitro-
gen oxides, particulate matter, and ozone. There was little
evidence that toxic heavy metals, or indeed most metals,
influence dementia risk, apart from aluminium – where
larger, better quality studies suggested an association.
Other than silicon, there was little evidence for other trace
elements affecting dementia risk, though selenium remains
an interesting element. Of the occupational exposures,
there was little strong evidence, but the evidence suggests
that exposure to some pesticides and, possibly, metals may
affect dementia risk. Finally, there was strong evidence
for vitamin D deficiency being associated with raised
dementia risk and moderate evidence for electromagnetic
fields, though this complicated exposure requires some
unpicking.
Limitations of the review and risk of bias within and across
studies
The broad search and systematic methodology of this re-
view is likely to have identified all the available literature.
Our exclusion of studies without dementia as their out-
come resulted in the exclusion of high quality studies
examining the association between environmental risk
factors and, for example, cognition or brain structure
[80, 81]. Such studies may shed some light on the patho-
genesis of dementia since cognitive or brain changes are
important features of dementia but they are not specific
to this syndrome. We excluded papers measuring levels
of a particular substance (often trace elements) in brain
areas or in serum since these physiological changes
could not be directly linked to environmental exposure.
Our other exclusion criteria (case studies, animal or nutri-
tional studies) are unlikely to have resulted in the exclu-
sion of relevant papers or introduced bias. As mentioned
above, we did exclude papers examining the effect of rur-
ality or urbanicity since we have previously reviewed this
literature and found in a meta-analysis an increased risk
of dementia (particularly Alzheimer’s dementia) in rural
areas, particularly living in rural areas early in life [16].
One unavoidable bias is that, despite the projected in-
crease in dementia rates occurring disproportionately in
low-to-middle income countries [4], the majority of the
research was conducted in high-income countries.
One of the major challenges in trying to synthesise
such a broad selection of papers is the diversity of
methodologies used. When considering Bradford Hill’s
criteria for inferring a causal association (strength,
consistency, specificity, temporality, biological gradient,
plausibility, and coherence), one clearly cannot satisfy
the temporality criterion with a cross-sectional study,
and thus a longitudinal study will provide more robust
evidence for the role of a risk factor in the pathogenesis
of dementia [82]. Since many of the included studies
are cross-sectional, it is often not possible to infer a
causal relationship. However, attrition in longitudinal
studies can be non-random which can introduce selection
bias [83]. Furthermore, no study measured exposures at
more than one time point (though some measured the
average exposure in a period), which will give a more ac-
curate picture of true exposure over time and is essential
in order to test whether there are critical or sensitive pe-
riods within the life course [84].
The fact that a number of exposures were only studied
in a single study (see Table 2) also weakens support for
them as it is impossible to examine the consistency of the
association in multiple studies. However, exposures which
were investigated in more than one study were also mea-
sured in a variety of ways, sometimes with variable quality.
For example, many exposures were inferred from an
address. This may be reasonable when it is not possible
to measure an individual’s exposure directly, but the
timing of measurement of the exposure is crucial, as
will be discussed below. One strength of this approach
is that it allows cumulative exposure to be estimated,
given the participant’s residential history. A more ro-
bust measure of an individual’s exposure is direct meas-
urement. This will clearly make a study more costly
and will also not solve the problem of the timing of the
exposure. Less robust, but frequently used for occupa-
tional exposures, in particular, is self-report. This does
avoid the problem of temporality as different points in
the life course can be covered, but will be limited in detail
and prone to recall bias [85]. Finally, direct measurement
of levels of a substance in the brain is likely to be the most
accurate, but is also the most difficult to link to dementia
risk – particularly for substances present in health – and
thus these studies were excluded from the presence of the
review. Alzheimer’s disease in the brain and the overt clin-
ical symptoms of Alzheimer’s dementia are parallel, related
phenomena [9] and the fact that approximately a third of
people dying without dementia can have moderate or se-
vere Alzheimer’s disease in their brains further complicates
the interpretation of autopsy studies [86]. Returning to
Bradford Hill’s criteria, a number of included studies
grouped their exposures into multiple categories, allowing
the exploration of a biological gradient in any association
observed – for example nitrogen oxides [27] – which can
strengthen any inference of a causal relationship.
Where possible, we reported the most-adjusted model
in a particular study. Most studies adjusted for age and

 sex and some for other relevant known risk factors for
dementia such as educational attainment or comorbidity
but adjustment beyond that was highly variable. The
possibility of residual confounding still remains.
There was a similar diversity of methodologies (and
diagnostic criteria) used to identify people with dementia
and it is important to consider whether any of these may
introduce bias. Most robust is direct clinical assessment
of
individuals
(often
combined
with
a
preliminary
screening phase to minimise costs), either specifically for
a research project or sourced from medical records.
Two-phase screening seems to provide an accurate meas-
ure of dementia [87], but screening non-participation may
introduce selection bias [88]. A substantial number of
studies used dementia mortality as their outcome. This
has previously been criticised [89], but more recent
studies suggest that dementia reporting is improving,
for example 72 % of a memory clinic cohort had de-
mentia correctly diagnosed on their death certificates
[90]. Importantly, death certification of dementia did not
seem to be related to premorbid intelligence or area-level
deprivation in that study (unpublished results available
from the author on request). Another study using multiple
sources from electronic health records to identify cases of
dementia found that death certificates alone identified 83 %
of the total number of cases identified by any source [17].
An additional important point is the adequacy of controls
in case–control studies – there was some variability in
the extent of matching with people with dementia.
Since we know that dementia is a condition which is
affected by risk and protective factors throughout the life
course [1], when the exposure is measured is crucial.
Within life course epidemiology, there are three models
of the association between a risk factor and an outcome:
accumulation of risk, sensitive periods, and critical pe-
riods [91, 92]. Sensitive periods refer to a period of the
life course when an exposure has a greater effect than
other times. A critical period is the only time when a
particular exposure has its effect; it does not affect risk if
encountered at a different point in life. Crucially for
dementia – which is now indisputably considered a
condition of the life course [93] – the exposure in a
study must be measured sufficiently early in life plaus-
ibly to be involved in the pathogenesis of a condition
which begins years or even decades before the clinical
onset of symptoms [94]. For example, we have found evi-
dence above for an association between air pollution and
dementia but it is not clear at what stage of life exposure
is important. A recent study found a biomarker which has
been proposed for Alzheimer’s disease (reduced cerebro-
spinal fluid levels of Aβ1–42 [95]) in children in Mexico
City who had been exposed to high levels of air pollution
in utero and throughout their life compared to controls
[96]. The issue of timing of exposures has been rather
neglected by the published literature on potential environ-
mental risk factors for dementia and should be considered
in much richer detail in the future.
Comparison with previous literature
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first compre-
hensive systematic review of environmental risk factors
for dementia. A review article was recently published on
environmental risk factors for Parkinson’s disease and
Alzheimer’s disease [20]. However, this article did not
take the systematic approach or focus on dementia of
the present review – the author included an extremely
broad range of risk factors, including some environmen-
tal risk factors alongside clinical, lifestyle, and dietary
factors. The findings of that review generally agreed with
ours and it concluded that there was robust evidence for
an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease in relation to ex-
posure to pesticides and that there was weak evidence
for an increased risk in relation to levels of aluminium
in drinking water and electromagnetic fields.
An older review summarised the literature relating to
a number of risk and protective factors and concluded
that there was evidence that occupational exposure to
solvents, pesticides, and electromagnetic fields as well
high levels of aluminium in drinking water were hazardous
[21]. A brief review article from around the same time con-
sidered young-onset Alzheimer’s dementia and highlighted
a number of deficiencies in the literature, many of which
remain, which frequently consisted of small studies with
limited measurements of environmental data, particularly
in relation to the life course and what would now be re-
ferred to as the ‘preclinical’ period [97].
Implications
As mentioned above, if a modifiable environmental risk
factor for dementia could be identified and modified, the
implications for public health, the economic cost of de-
mentia, and individuals’ suffering could be profound. We
have reported, albeit with many caveats, a short list of
environmental factors which may be related to dementia
risk – air pollution (all types); aluminium; silicon; selenium;
pesticides; vitamin D; and electric and magnetic fields –
and it is reasonable to speculate about possible mecha-
nisms which might underlie these associations, if they
were to prove causal. These mechanisms could be ex-
amined in more detail using methodologies such as
Mendelian randomization [98].
Air pollution has been shown to be associated with re-
duced cerebral blood flow [99] and seems to be neuro-
toxic [100]. As shown above, brain changes – including
cognitive changes and biomarkers – can be identified in
children living in areas with high levels of air pollution
compared to controls [96]. Aluminium has been found in
amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (pathological
Killin et al. BMC Geriatrics  (2016) 16:175 
Page 24 of 28
 features of Alzheimer’s disease) and, in rat models, alu-
minium intake increases amyloid expression [101, 102].
Furthermore, it has been suggested that relatively small
amounts of aluminium could be neurotoxic and levels
could accumulate selectively in certain brain tissues [103].
Silica may reduce absorption or increase excretion of alu-
minium [39]. Copper could be implicated in the pathogen-
esis of Alzheimer’s disease in a number of ways, including
promoting Aβ aggregation and hyperphosphorylation and
aggregation of tau [104]. The role of selenium in human
physiology is complex [105] and it is involved in multiple
molecular pathways relevant to the development of
Alzheimer’s disease [23]. Pesticides form a heterogeneous
group but some seem to be neurotoxic. Organophosphates,
for example, may disrupt cholinergic neurotransmission
through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase [69]. Chronic
exposure to some pesticides has been linked to multiple
neurological conditions, though specific mechanisms
remain unclear. Vitamin D has numerous effects rele-
vant to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, includ-
ing stimulating macrophages to clear amyloid plaques,
reducing amyloid-induced cytotoxicity, as well as main-
tenance of cerebrovascular function [78]. Electric and
magnetic fields have been proposed to affect the brain
in a variety of mechanisms – including oxidative stress,
apoptosis and necrosis of neurons, and even cytogenetic
effects – but no firm mechanistic link with dementia has
been made [73, 106]. It can be seen that several of these
putative risk factors could act through multiple routes and
it may become even more difficult to disentangle the rela-
tive importance of Alzheimer’s disease pathology and
cerebrovascular disease in causing clinical dementia.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the published evidence concerning specific
environmental risk factors for dementia is generally not
strong. However, there seems to be little role for most
metals or other trace elements, occupational exposure to
lead, inks/dyes, paints/stains/varnishes, gasoline/fuels/oils,
liquid plastics/rubbers, vibratory tools, or climate in deter-
mining dementia risk. There is at least moderate evidence
consistently supporting air pollution, aluminium, silicon,
selenium, pesticides, vitamin D, and electromagnetic fields
as putative environmental risk factors for dementia. More
and better research is needed and we suggest that this
shortlist should form the initial focus of attention.
