Biological measures of aging are important for understanding the health of an aging population, with epigenetics
particularly promising. Previous studies found that tumor tissue is epigenetically older than its donors are
chronologically. We examined whether blood Δage (the discrepancy between epigenetic and chronological
ages) can predict cancer incidence or mortality, thus assessing its potential as a cancer biomarker. In a prospec-
tive cohort, Δage and its rate of change over time were calculated in 834 blood leukocyte samples collected from
442 participants free of cancer at blood draw. About 3–5 years before cancer onset or death, Δage was associated
with cancer risks in a dose-responsive manner (P = 0.02) and a one-year increase in Δage was associated with
cancer incidence (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02–1.10) and mortality (HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.07–1.28). Participants with
smaller Δage and decelerated epigenetic aging over time had the lowest risks of cancer incidence (P = 0.003)
and mortality (P = 0.02). Δage was associated with cancer incidence in a ‘J-shaped’ manner for subjects examined
pre-2003, and with cancer mortality in a time-varying manner. We conclude that blood epigenetic age may
mirror epigenetic abnormalities related to cancer development, potentially serving as a minimally invasive
biomarker for cancer early detection.

1. Introduction
As the population continues to age in the coming decades, the need
for biological measures of age and more precise screening tests for
age-related diseases will become increasingly urgent. Genetic and
epigenetic studies have added to the potential clinical utility of this
subject area, with researchers identifying elements associated with
age-related processes (e.g., telomeres) that nonetheless have unverified
predictive power in human populations (Brooks-Wilson, 2013).
Epigenetics
serves
as
an
intersection
between
genetic
and
environmental risk factors for aging processes and age-related diseases,
holding great promise for constructing biological age measures that will
provide clinical diagnostic tools for aging-related diseases such as can-
cer. Blood-based epigenetic markers are particularly well-suited to
these purposes due to their minimally invasive method of collection
and cost-effectiveness on the population scale.
Epigenetic age is a recently developed algorithm that uses DNA
methylation measurements to describe biological age at the level of
human tissues, cells, and organs (Hannum et al., 2013; Horvath, 2013;
Weidner et al., 2014). Epigenetic age does not always parallel chrono-
logical age, particularly in tumor samples (Hannum et al., 2013;
Horvath, 2013), a discrepancy we refer to here as Δage. Furthermore,
since the methods for measuring epigenetic age incorporate loci in
pathways related to both cancer development and aging in general
(e.g., DNA damage, cellular proliferation, and oxidative stress)

 (Hannum et al., 2013; Horvath, 2013), it is highly possible that Δage can
be a predictive biomarker for cancer risk, metastasis, and mortality in
addition to serving as an indicator of aging. With further study and
refinement, the concept of epigenetic age may also be useful for improv-
ing our understanding of mechanisms by which age and cancer are re-
lated. However, no longitudinal analysis has yet evaluated how blood
epigenetic age changes over time prior to cancer diagnosis or cancer-
related death, and whether blood Δage can predict future risk of cancer
incidence and mortality.
Our objective is to assess whether white blood cell (WBC) Δage
can predict cancer incidence and mortality, and to evaluate these
predictions over time. We will achieve our goals by comparing multiple
estimates of Δage obtained using blood DNA samples collected prior to
cancer incidence and death in: 1) individuals who developed cancer
relative to cancer-free individuals and 2) individuals who died of cancer
relative to both cancer survivors and cancer-free individuals.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Participants
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' Normative Aging Study
(NAS) is a longitudinal cohort established in 1963 (Bell et al., 1966).
Between March 1999 and December 2013, 802 out of 829 (96.7%) of
active participants agreed to donate blood, 686 of whom were randomly
selected and profiled using the Illumina 450 K BeadChip array at up to
three follow-up visits separated by median time intervals of 3.5 years
(IQR 3.1–5.7) (Supplementary material, Fig. S1). We excluded 18
participants who were non-White or had missing information on
race to minimize potential confounding effects of genetic ancestry, 182
participants who had been diagnosed with malignant cancer prior to
the first blood draw, and 44 participants who had been diagnosed
with neoplasms of uncertain behavior, leaving a total of 442 participants
for analysis. Cancer diagnoses and comorbidities (prevalent diabetes,
hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke) were obtained from
questionnaires and confirmed via blinded medical record review.
Official death certificates were reviewed by a physician, and all contrib-
uting causes coded by an experienced research nurse. Telomere length
was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
and reported in relative units, as previously described (Hou et al.,
2015). Of the 442 participants free of cancer at first blood draw,
132 developed cancer during follow-up (38 prostate, 50 skin, 44
other) and 34 died from cancer (4 prostate, 2 skin, 28 other). The
remaining 98 participants died from non-cancer causes or were
still alive as of latest follow-up, and are defined as cancer survivors
for our analysis (Supplementary material, Fig. S2). Median follow-up
time (from first blood draw) to cancer incidence or censoring was
10.1 years (IQR 5.8–12.7) and 11.9 years (IQR 8.8–13.0) to cancer
mortality or censoring. This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Boards of all participating institutions, and all participants
provided written consent.
2.2. Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip DNA Methylation
Profiling
DNA was extracted from the buffy coat using the QIAamp DNA Blood
Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). A total of 500 ng of DNA was used to
perform bisulfite conversion using the EZ-96 DNA Methylation Kit
(Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA). To limit chip and plate effects a
two stage, age-stratified algorithm was used to randomize samples
and ensure similar age distributions across chips and plates. We
randomized 12 samples (sampled across all age quartiles) per chip,
and then randomized chips to plates. Quality control analysis was
performed to remove samples where N1% of probes had a detection
P N 0.05. The remaining samples were preprocessed using Illumina-
type background correction without normalization as re-implemented
in the Bioconductor minfi package and used to generate beta values
(Aryee et al., 2014). The working set included all 485,512 CpG and
CpH probes for epigenetic age estimation.
2.3. Epigenetic Age and Δage Calculation
We estimated epigenetic age as measured by Hannum's 71-CpG
method using Horvath's online calculator (http://labs.genetics.ucla.
edu/horvath/dnamage/), which incorporates both previously-
published methods (Hannum et al., 2013; Horvath, 2013) based on
prior work showing superior predictive accuracy in blood (Marioni
et al., 2015). We selected Hannum's method because the model
was trained using blood samples and it yielded accurate and longitudi-
nally stable epigenetic age estimation using our blood-based methyla-
tion data (Supplementary material, Fig. S3). To remove potential
confounding due to alterations in WBC composition with age (Marioni
et al., 2015) and naïve T cell changes due to thymic involution (Taub
and Longo, 2005), cell abundances were estimated via previously
published methods (Horvath, 2013; Houseman et al., 2012). We then
used the residuals from a linear regression of epigenetic age on
chronological age and these cell type abundances to calculate Δage
(with Δage N 0 indicating epigenetic age older than chronological
age), resulting in a construct less sensitive to normal age-related
changes in WBC composition and immunosenescence (Supplementary
material, Fig. S4).
2.4. Statistical Analysis
We performed descriptive analyses of participant characteristics
(including epigenetic age and Δage) at first blood draw using linear
mixed-effect models. We then expanded these descriptive analyses to
assess dose–response via a multivariable linear mixed-effect model
comparing Δage across samples (estimated by least squares means) in
participants who died from cancer, cancer survivors, and cancer-free
participants. Next, we used Random Matrix Theory (Plerou et al.,
2002) available in R package isva (Teschendorff et al., 2011) to deter-
mine that there were two significant components of variation in
our data. We made a heat map (Supplementary material, Fig. S5) of
P-values matrix of associations between the significant components
and: biological (Houseman's
six
blood
cell
type
proportions;
Houseman et al., 2012), epidemiological (the 11 covariates we
considered) and technical factors (plate number, chip number, row
number and column number of the chip). We found that the compo-
nents were strongly associated with biological and technical factors,
but not epidemiological factors. Therefore, all subsequent models
adjusted for the top two principle components computed from the
450 K array data to account for batch effects and residual biological
confounding. We included the third top PC to better capture latent
population stratification of the data (Barfield et al., 2014).
Prior to running our survival analyses, we evaluated the proportion-
al hazards assumption for both cancer incidence and mortality by
plotting Schoenfeld residuals over time. Although the hazards for cancer
incidence were proportional across all follow-up time, the mortality
analysis violated the proportional hazards assumption with marginal
statistical significance (P = 0.04; data available upon request). There-
fore, our subsequent analyses examined Δage and cancer both across
all follow-up visits and stratified by year of blood DNA collection. We
selected a stratification point of January 1st, 2003 as 1) it separated
two data collection ‘cycles’ in the NAS rotation protocol (Supplementary
material, Fig. S1), and 2) the resulting subgroups were of similar
size. Subsequent testing of the proportional hazards assumption
within these strata revealed no violations for either cancer incidence
or mortality.
We plotted KM curves, comparing participants epigenetically older
than their chronological age (Δage N 0) to those epigenetically younger
than their chronological age (Δage ≤ 0) using log-rank tests. Next, we
69
Y. Zheng et al. / EBioMedicine 5 (2016) 68–73
 used time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate
associations between Δage and times to cancer diagnosis and death.
We investigated potential nonlinearity of these associations using
pointwise HR curves (Meira-Machado et al., 2013) and generalized ad-
ditive Cox models using penalized splines (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1995).
Finally, using the 299 participants with two or more samples, we com-
puted the slope of Δage over time and categorized these participants
as having accelerated (Δage slope N 0) or decelerated (Δage slope ≤ 0)
epigenetic aging over time. We then used a second set of KM survival
curves and log-rank tests to analyze the relationship between Δage, epi-
genetic aging over time, and cancer.
Our multivariable models additionally adjusted for chronological
age at first blood draw, BMI, education, smoking status, pack-years of
smoking, and alcohol consumption. One participant with missing data
on education was excluded from multivariable analysis. Five other
variables (telomere length and presence of four comorbidities) were
examined in separate sensitivity analyses of our Cox models. The
inclusion of these variables did not substantively affect our estimates
(Supplementary material, Table S1) and they were therefore excluded
due to having high proportions of missing data. We conducted all
analyses using R v3.0.2, two-sided tests, and a statistical significance
threshold of P = 0.05.

3. Results
Characteristics of participants at first blood draw were similar
to previous reports (Hou et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2011), indicating suc-
cessful randomization. No participant characteristics were associated
with Δage (Supplementary material, Table S2). Mean epigenetic age
was almost identical to chronological age but with greater variance
(Table 1). There were 422 observations of 370 participants during the
first half of the follow-up period (pre-2003) and 412 observations of
306 participants during the second half (2003–2013). In the pre-2003
stratum the median times to cancer diagnosis and death were 5.1 (IQR
(interquartile range) 2.7–8.6) and 7.0 years (IQR 5.3–10.1), respectively.
In the 2003–2013 stratum the median times to cancer diagnosis and
death were 3.0 (IQR 0.6–5.7) and 4.6 years (IQR 2.4–7.0), respectively.
The pre-2003 analysis included 370 and 52 samples from participants
at their first and second time-point of measures, respectively. The
2003–2013 analysis included 72, 247, and 93 samples from participants
at their first, second, and third time-point of measures, respectively.
Using data gathered from 2003 to 2013, our dose–response analysis
identified greater Δage in cancer survivors and participants who
died from cancer (Δage = 0.5 and 2.2 years, respectively) relative to
cancer-free participants (Δage = −0.4 years, test for trend P = 0.02)
(Fig. 1); Kaplan–Meier (KM) curves comparing Δage also suggested
participants with greater Δage had a higher risk of cancer incidence
(log-rank P = 0.002) and cancer mortality (log-rank P = 0.04)
(Supplementary material, Fig. S6). We observed weaker, non-significant
results in analyses using samples before 2003 and using all samples
combined.
Adjusted for covariates, the 2003–2013 time-dependent Cox models
revealed that each one-year increase in Δage was associated with greater
risks of cancer incidence (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02–1.10), and mortality
(HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.07–1.28). We found no associations between Δage
and cancer risk in either all samples combined or the pre-2003 samples
(Table 2). Point-wise HR curves of Δage illustrated a J-shaped relation-
ship in cancer incidence for samples taken pre-2003 (P = 0.03 for test
of nonlinearity) (Fig. 2A). The risk of cancer mortality increased linearly
with Δage in the 2003–2013 samples, but this association was substan-
tially weaker for pre-2003 samples (Fig. 2B). KM survival curves exam-
ining Δage rate of change over time showed that participants who were
epigenetically young relative to their chronological age (Δage ≤ 0) and
had decelerated or stable epigenetic aging over time (Δage slope ≤ 0)

4. Discussion
Our results indicate a strong, possibly dose-responsive, relationship
between Δage and cancer incidence and mortality that is independent
of telomere shortening and several epidemiological risk factors for
cancer. The relationships between Δage and cancer were strongest in
DNA samples collected within three to five years of a cancer event and
among participants with accelerated epigenetic aging over time. These
findings, coupled with our spline showing a nonlinear, J-shaped
relationship between Δage and cancer incidence suggest a dynamic
and complex relationship between Δage and cancer over the long term.
A diagnostic test to detect an individual's discrepancies between
epigenetic and chronological age could therefore prove useful for cancer
risk and prognosis assessment.
Epigenetic modifications are potentially central to biological
processes of aging (Ben-Avraham et al., 2012), and both global
(Ben-Avraham et al., 2012) and gene-specific methylation can be al-
tered substantially by the aging process (Gravina and Vijg, 2010).
While the accumulation of epigenetic changes is a hallmark of
cancer, few studies have prospectively examined the potential of
age-related epigenetic changes to predict cancer. The observed
association between Δage and cancer was independent of chronolog-
ical age, telomere length, and several known lifestyle risk factors for
cancer (e.g., body mass index (BMI), and smoking). The method for
calculating epigenetic age in our analysis combines age-dependent
CpG sites enriched in pathways that are also involved in carcinogen-
esis (Hannum et al., 2013; Horvath, 2013), and our findings indicate
that this may be a viable strategy for developing predictive
biomarkers of cancer. In addition, our sensitivity analyses found
that the association between Δage and cancer is independent of both
telomere length and other comorbidities, suggesting Δage as a specific
cancer biomarker as well as the possibility that Δage reflects molecular-
level aging or carcinogenic processes that are not captured by telomere
measurements.
Our findings are intriguing and biologically plausible. A recent meta-
analysis of four large longitudinal cohorts revealed that Δage measured
in blood DNA correlates well with all-cause mortality rates and is inde-
pendent of health, lifestyle, and genetic factors (Marioni et al., 2015).
Another recent study of lung cancer found and even stronger rela-
tionship between blood epigenetic age and cancer mortality using
Horvath's method (Levine et al., 2015). While blood epigenetic age
is already being studied in HIV-1 patients with clinical signs of
aging (Horvath and Levine, 2015), it may be even more valuable in
studies of cancer. WBC play an important role in carcinogenesis via
inflammatory response and pro-apoptotic processes (Ichikawa
et al., 2011; Schnekenburger et al., 2008), both of which also affect
epigenetic age. The discrepancy between epigenetic and chronolog-
ical age, i.e. Δage, has also been associated with cancer prognosis in
tumor tissue data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (Lehne et al.,
2015). However, sampling different tissues is not feasible for cancer
screening at the population level, both for practical reasons and
because different cancers can have tissue-specific, differential, and
even opposing effects on epigenetic age (Horvath, 2013; Horvath,
2015), Therefore, our finding of the predictive value of blood-based
epigenetic age for cancer risk and mortality is particularly provoca-
tive and potentially valuable for use as a screening tool for cancer
as it can offer more stable and reliable predictions (Horvath, 2013).
The method used in our study for measuring epigenetic age was
based on a model trained on genome-wide DNA methylation extracted

 from WBC (Hannum et al., 2013). As our measurements were taken
from extracted WBC, epigenetic age measured in our study could be a
proxy measure for the immune response to cancer initiation and pro-
gression, potentially explaining the complex, nonlinear, and time-
dependent relationships between Δage, cancer incidence, and cancer
mortality we observed. It is well-known that thymic involution with
aging can result in diminishing numbers of naïve T cells (Taub and
Longo, 2005). Our data also suggested that increasing epigenetic age
was associated with loss of naïve CD8+ T cells (r = −0.24, P b 0.001,
Supplementary material, Fig. S7). After removing the confounding ef-
fects of chronological age and immunosenescence using Δage, our spline
plots showed that the risk of developing cancer over time is minimized
at Δage = 0, with a more linear risk profile emerging 3–5 years prior to
diagnosis (Fig. 2). This may reflect the initial anti-inflammatory and
pro-apoptotic response by the body to early carcinogenesis, which trig-
gers increased WBC production that successfully (albeit temporarily)
represses cancer. As the cancer eventually adapts to such immune
responses they become less effective, resulting in the J-shaped curve
evident in our spline plot. Thus, epigenetic age substantially ‘younger’
than chronological age (negative Δage) may be a biomarker of the initial
response to a developing cancer before it is detectable through standard
diagnostic means. The findings of our Kaplan–Meier curve relating any
disruption in the normal epigenetic aging observed in healthy subjects
(i.e. either higher Δage or accelerated epigenetic aging over time) to can-
cer incidence and mortality are also consistent with this hypothesis
(Fig. 3, Supplementary material, Fig. S6). As we continue to accrue
follow-up data for this cohort, we can assess whether this suggestion
is accurate by comparing health outcomes for epigenetically ‘young’ to
epigenetically ‘old’ subjects over time. These findings should also be
verified in other, larger datasets.
The observed dynamics are also reflected in the straightforward
Δage–mortality relationship. Delays between cancer diagnosis and
death may allow time for normal thymic involution and other age-
related immune deterioration processes to reassert themselves, after
the initial response to cancer. This would effectively allow epigenetic
age to ‘catch up’ to chronological age and produce the observed linear
relationship with mortality. Alternatively, our findings related to cancer
mortality could also be reflective of metastasis-induced changes in WBC
epigenetic profiles. Longer follow-up in larger groups will be necessary
to confirm these hypotheses, but if confirmed, they suggest that Δage
would be best utilized as a biomarker of early immune response to
carcinogenic processes, with any perturbations of epigenetic age
relative to chronological age serving as a potentially useful indicator
for use in mass screenings for cancer.
The longitudinal nature of our study enabled us to establish tempo-
ral associations between Δage and cancer risk. Our sample size limited
our ability to conduct meaningful analyses of cancer subtypes, thus
caution should be exercised in interpreting our results. However,
while different cancers are biologically distinct from one another
blood-based Δage may not be cancer-type-specific. As carcinogenesis
usually alters methylation of WBC through inflammation and immune
senescence pathways common to most cancer types (Ponnappan and
Ponnappan, 2011; Li et al., 2012), epigenetic age acceleration in blood
DNA may be a useful biomarker for many (if not all) types of cancer.
Therefore, pooling multiple different cancers is biologically plausible
for purposes of examining Δage in blood. Additional studies with
longer follow-up are needed to confirm this, and to verify the dynamic,
nonlinear, and time-dependent relationship between Δage and cancer.
Epigenetic age is comparable to chronological age among cancer-
free participants. Those with older epigenetic age relative to their
chronological age have an elevated risk of cancer events within three
to five years. Our study provides insight into using blood-based epige-
netic age as a potential biomarker for cancer early detection. It may
also inform future studies of the effects of aging on cancer and potential-
ly other diseases. Expanding this research to additional time points
would help determine when in the course of the disease cancer-
related changes in epigenetic age occur, and the extent to which Δage
is different across individuals and cancers.

Fig. 3. Kaplan–Meier survival curves comparing risk of cancer grouped by Δage and its rate of change. A: cancer incidence; B: cancer mortality. Δage slope was calculated for each participant
with two or more visits to represent the Δage rate of change. KM survival curves were then plotted among each of the combination of the binary Δage and its rate of change. Young:
epigenetically young (Δage ≤ 0); old: epigenetically old (Δage N 0); decelerated: decelerated or stable epigenetic aging over time (Δage slope ≤ 0); accelerated: accelerated epigenetic
aging over time (Δage slope N 0).
