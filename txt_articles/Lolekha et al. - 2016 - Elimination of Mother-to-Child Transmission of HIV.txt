Thailand experienced a generalized human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) epidemic during the 1990s. HIV prevalence among 
pregnant women was 2.0% and the mother-to-child transmis-
sion (MTCT) rate was >20% (1–3). In June 2016, Thailand 
became the first country in Asia to validate the elimination of 
MTCT by meeting World Health Organization (WHO) tar-
gets. Because Thailand’s experience implementing a successful 
prevention of MTCT program might be instructive for other 
countries, Thailand’s prevention of MTCT interventions, 
outcomes, factors that contributed to success, and challenges 
that remain were reviewed. Thailand’s national prevention of 
MTCT program has evolved with prevention science from 
national implementation of short course zidovudine (AZT) in 
2000 to lifelong highly active antiretroviral therapy regardless 
of CD4 count (WHO option B+) in 2014 (1). By 2015, HIV 
prevalence among pregnant women had decreased to 0.6% and 
the MTCT rate to 1.9% (the elimination of MTCT target is 
<2% for nonbreastfeeding populations) (4). A strong public 
health infrastructure, committed political leadership, govern-
ment funding, engagement of multiple partners, and a robust 
monitoring system allowed Thailand to achieve this important 
public health milestone.
Early prevention of MTCT response
The first case of HIV in a pregnant woman in Thailand 
was reported in 1988 and increasing HIV prevalence among 
pregnant women and other populations was recognized in the 
early 1990s (3,5). In 1996, after the ACTG 076 trial* (6), 
the Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and Siriraj 
Hospital, in collaboration with CDC Thailand/Southeast Asia 
Regional Office, launched a trial of short-course oral AZT, a 
regimen feasible for use in Thailand (2). The trial demonstrated 
a 50% reduction in MTCT.
In 1996, Her Royal Highness Princess Soamsawali donated 
funds to the Thai Red Cross Society to make antiretrovirals for 
prevention of MTCT available to hospitals around the country. 
During 1997–1999, the MOPH implemented pilot prevention 
of MTCT projects in northeastern (7) and northern Thailand 
(5) to provide HIV testing for pregnant women and AZT for 
prevention of MTCT, and to implement a pilot prevention of 
MTCT monitoring system. In 2000, the Department of Health 
(DOH) MOPH announced the first national prevention of 
MTCT policy and issued guidelines for all government hospitals 
to integrate prevention of MTCT activities into routine maternal 
and child health services, including HIV testing for all pregnant 
women, antiretroviral therapy for prevention of MTCT, and 
infant formula for infants born to HIV-positive mothers. The 
prevention of MTCT program covers all public and private 
health care facilities. The Thai government funds prevention of 
MTCT services for Thais under the universal health coverage 
policy. During 2007–2014, non-Thai HIV-positive pregnant 
women could access prevention of MTCT services through a 
Global Fund project; these services can currently be accessed 
through hospital social welfare funds, the Princess Soamsawali 
prevention of MTCT fund, government-sponsored migrant 
health insurance, or other special projects (1) (Figure 1).
Antiretroviral regimens for Thailand’s national prevention 
of MTCT program have evolved with prevention science. 
In 2000, HIV-positive pregnant women were offered AZT 
starting at 34 weeks gestation and their infants received AZT 
for 4 weeks. A single-dose of nevirapine (WHO option A) 
was added in 2004; next, in 2010, highly active antiretroviral 
therapy (WHO option B) was provided during pregnancy 
and continued based on CD4 count; and finally, in 2014, 
highly active antiretroviral therapy for life regardless of CD4 
count (WHO option B+) became the standard. HIV testing 
of couples was implemented in 2010 (1).
Infant HIV testing guidelines have also evolved. During 
2000–2006, HIV diagnosis in infants aged 12 months and 
18 months was accomplished using antibody tests; diagnoses 
in some infants aged >2 months were made using DNA poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) testing as part of research studies 
or other projects. In 2007, HIV DNA PCR testing was imple-
mented for infants aged 1–2 months and 2–4 months using 
national HIV/AIDS funds. In 2014, the national prevention 
of MTCT guidelines were modified to classify infants based on 
their risk for acquiring HIV. Infants with standard risk receive 
AZT for 4 weeks, and HIV DNA PCR testing is performed at 
age 1 month and 2–4 months. Infants with high risk (mater-
nal plasma HIV viral load >50 copies/mL or infants born to 
mothers taking highly active antiretroviral therapy for <4 weeks 
before delivery) receive AZT, lamivudine, and nevirapine for 
* ACTG 076 was a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
clinical trial designed to evaluate whether zidovudine administered orally 
(initiated at 14–34 weeks gestation) and intravenously during labor to HIV-
infected pregnant women and orally to their infants could reduce the rate of 
transmission from mother to infant.

6 weeks, and HIV DNA PCR testing is performed at ages 1, 
2, and 4 months. All children born to HIV-positive mothers 
have confirmatory HIV antibody testing at age 18 months (1).
Stigma and discrimination against women living with HIV 
continues to prevent some women from accessing antenatal 
clinic services (1). Women living with HIV in Thailand and 
civil society organizations have worked with the MOPH to 
develop and implement a training curriculum for hospital 
personnel that aims to reduce stigma and discrimination (1).
National prevention of MTCT monitoring system
In 2000, the DOH MOPH, with assistance from CDC, 
launched the Perinatal HIV Intervention Monitoring System 
(PHIMS) to monitor prevention of MTCT services (8). PHIMS 
collects monthly summaries from hospitals, including HIV test-
ing of pregnant women and their partners, and antiretroviral 
coverage for prevention of MTCT. PHIMS has been integrated 
in routine hospital reporting activities, and in 2015, PHIMS 
covered 837 (92%) governmental hospitals in Thailand (77% 
of total deliveries including Thais and non-Thais).
Thailand has high levels of health care coverage: 98.3% of 
pregnant women had at least one antenatal clinic visit in 2015 
(elimination of MTCT target >95%) (4). The percentage of 
pregnant women tested for HIV has increased from 61.9% 
among women in the 1998 prevention of MTCT pilot proj-
ects (7) to 92.9% in 2001(8) after the national prevention of 
MTCT policy was announced, and to 99.6% in 2015 (elimi-
nation of MTCT target >95%) (1). The use of antiretrovirals 
for prevention of MTCT increased from 64.6% in 1998 (7) 
to 71.4% in 2001 (8), and to 95.6% in 2015 (elimination of 
MTCT target >90%) (1) (Table).

The MOPH Bureau of Epidemiology, with support from 
CDC, launched the Perinatal HIV Outcome Monitoring 
System in 2001 (9). Providers in 64 public hospitals in four 
of the country’s 77 provinces submitted data, including the 
number of infants born to HIV-positive mothers, the number 
of HIV-infected infants, and the MTCT rate, to the Perinatal 
HIV Outcome Monitoring System, which expanded to 191 
facilities in 14 provinces during 2004–2007. In 2008, Thailand 
established the National AIDS Program to monitor national 
HIV treatment and care services. MTCT rates were calcu-
lated based on infant HIV DNA PCR test results reported in 
the National AIDS Program. Adjusted MTCT rates during 
2001–2012 were calculated to include HIV-exposed infants 
who were not tested for HIV or whose HIV test results were 
not reported (9,10). During 2013–2015, adjusted MTCT rates 
were calculated using SPECTRUM version 5.4 (1).
With the implementation of HIV prevention policies and 
increased coverage of effective prevention tools (e.g., HIV 
testing and antiretrovirals for prevention of MTCT) and 
strong prevention of MTCT monitoring systems, the MTCT 
rate decreased from 24.2% in 1994 (2) to 10.2% in 2003 
with the introduction of short-course AZT, to 4.5% with the 
implementation of WHO option A, and to 1.9% in 2015 after 
the implementation of WHO option B+ (Figure 2).
Discussion
Thailand has achieved WHO targets for the elimination 
of MTCT, and is the first country with a generalized HIV 
epidemic to reach this milestone. The prevalence of HIV 
among pregnant women has decreased substantially during 
the past two decades. A combination of factors has made this 
possible. The Thai government responded to the increasing 
prevalence of HIV among pregnant women by working with 
domestic and international medical experts and researchers to 
assess available data, initiate studies where needed, build the 
capacity of health care workers, launch national HIV education 
and 100% condom use campaigns, implement pilot preven-
tion of MTCT activities, gather evidence to develop national 
policy, and expand activities nationwide. The government 
also engaged with civil society, persons living with HIV, and 
nongovernmental organizations to consider appropriate and 
feasible prevention interventions. A well-developed national 
health and laboratory system, the integration of prevention 
of MTCT into routine maternal child health care, and gov-
ernment funding of prevention of MTCT services have been

important in attaining high coverage and consistent prevention 
of MTCT services nationwide. Thailand has a robust national 
prevention of MTCT monitoring and evaluation system that 
promotes data use for program improvement at national and 
subnational levels. As a result, the expanding epidemic of HIV 
among women was stemmed and MTCT reduced, and fewer 
infants are born HIV-positive in Thailand.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limi-
tations. First, nationwide surveillance data about HIV testing 
coverage and the MTCT rate in the 1980s and 1990s are lack-
ing. Second, assessments of HIV testing and the MTCT rate 
did not cover 23% of deliveries in 2015. Finally, the DOH 
sent a prevention of MTCT coverage questionnaire during 
2013–2015 to 170 hospitals that are not part of the PHIMS 
reporting system, including 140 private hospitals, 19 non-
MOPH government hospitals, and 11 university hospitals; 
although only 39% responded, coverage of antenatal clinics, 
HIV testing, and antiretrovirals for prevention of MTCT met 
elimination of MTCT targets in the hospitals that responded.
Thailand’s national AIDS strategy aims to reduce the MTCT 
rate to <1% by 2030. Preliminary data from an active case 
management network launched in Thailand in August 2014

SPECTRUM version 5.4 (a software tool developed by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and partners to assist countries in monitoring their HIV 
epidemic and provide outputs such as the number of pregnant women and infants infected with HIV). The MTCT rate was calculated based on national infant HIV

suggested that approximately 80% of new perinatal HIV cases 
occurred among women who begin antenatal clinic services 
late, have poor antiretroviral therapy adherence, or test HIV-
negative at the first antenatal clinic visit but acquire HIV later 
(before or after delivery) (1). In response, Thailand’s National 
HIV Treatment and Prevention Guideline 2016 will recom-
mend raltegravir, an integrase inhibitor with rapid antiviral 
activity, for HIV-positive pregnant women who receive care 
after 32 weeks of pregnancy, and emphasize HIV testing of 
couples beginning during visits to antenatal clinics and con-
tinuing through the postpartum period. Data suggest that to 
reach a MTCT rate <1%, Thailand will need to strengthen 
ownership of prevention of MTCT at subnational and com-
munity levels, enhance prevention of MTCT monitoring and 
data use, ensure that HIV-positive migrants have access to 
HIV services; and sustain the active case management system.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Thailand experienced a generalized human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) epidemic in the 1990s. HIV prevalence among 
women in antenatal clinics was 2%, and mother-to-child 
transmission (MTCT) rate of HIV was >20%.
What is added by this report?
Thailand has achieved World Health Organization targets for the 
elimination of MTCT. With implementation of programs for 100% 
condom use and HIV prevention, HIV prevalence among 
pregnant women decreased from 2% in the mid-1990s to 0.6% in 
2015. The MTCT rate decreased from >20% to 1.9% because of 
the effective use of antiretroviral regimens to prevent MTCT, 
including the adoption of WHO option B+ (lifelong highly active 
antiretroviral therapy regardless of CD4 count) in 2014, and the 
high coverage of antenatal care and prevention of MTCT services 
in Thailand. Factors that contributed to these achievements 
include the commitment and leadership of the Thai government, 
a strong public health infrastructure, a self-reliant national 
budget, the engagement of nongovernmental and civil society 
partners, and a robust prevention of MTCT monitoring program. 
What are the implications for public health?
Thailand has achieved World Health Organization elimination of 
MTCT targets and can serve as a model for other countries.
