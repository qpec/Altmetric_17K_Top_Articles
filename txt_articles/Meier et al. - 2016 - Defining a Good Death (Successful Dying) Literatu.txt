Abstract
There is little agreement about what constitutes good death or successful dying. The authors 
conducted a literature search for published, English-language, peer-reviewed reports of qualitative 
and quantitative studies that provided a definition of a good death. Stakeholders in these articles 
included patients, prebereaved and bereaved family members, and healthcare providers (HCPs). 
Definitions found were categorized into core themes and subthemes, and the frequency of each 
theme was determined by stakeholder (patients, family, HCPs) perspectives. Thirty-six studies met 
eligibility criteria, with 50% of patient perspective articles including individuals over age 60 years. 
We identified 11 core themes of good death: preferences for a specific dying process, pain-free 
status, religiosity/spiritualty, emotional well-being, life completion, treatment preferences, dignity, 
family, quality of life, relationship with HCP, and other. The top three themes across all 
stakeholder groups were preferences for dying process (94% of reports), pain-free status (81%), 
and emotional well-being (64%). However, some discrepancies among the respondent groups were 
noted in the core themes: Family perspectives included life completion (80%), quality of life 
(70%), dignity (70%), and presence of family (70%) more frequently than did patient perspectives 
regarding those items (35%–55% each). In contrast, religiosity/spirituality was reported somewhat 
more often in patient perspectives (65%) than in family perspectives (50%). Taking into account 
the limitations of the literature, further research is needed on the impact of divergent perspectives 
on end-of-life care. Dialogues among the stakeholders for each individual must occur to ensure a 
good death from the most critical viewpoint—the patient’s.

 INTRODUCTION
“The truth is, once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.”
—Mitch Albom, Tuesdays with Morrie1
Considerable lay literature describes positive approaches to dying. For example, in 
“Tuesdays with Morrie”1 Mitch Albom visits with his former Sociology professor, Morrie 
Schwartz, who provides lessons on acceptance, communication, and love in the midst of his 
own dying process. Similarly, Viktor Frankl’s “Man’s Search for Meaning”2 describes 
experiences in a Nazi concentration camp that led to finding meaning during times of 
suffering and death. Also, in “The Last Lecture,”3 Randy Pausch discusses, after being 
diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer, how to truly live and embrace every moment 
because “time is all you have…and you may find one day that you have less than you think.” 
Finally, in his commencement speech at Stanford University, Steve Jobs,4 after a recent 
diagnosis of cancer, called death “very likely the single best invention of life” and described 
focusing on what was most important and meaningful to him as he confronted death. These 
literary examples illustrate various constructs of a good death or “dying well.”5
Within the healthcare community and, more specifically, in hospice and palliative care, there 
has been some discussion of the concept of a good death.6,7 This concept arose from the 
hospice movement and has been described as a multifaceted and individualized experience.8 
According to an Institute of Medicine report published 19 years ago, a good death is one that 
is “free from avoidable distress and suffering for patient, family, and caregivers, in general 
accord with the patient’s and family’s wishes, and reasonably consistent with clinical, 
cultural, and ethical standards.”9 This concept has received some critique in several 
disciplines, including medicine, psychology, theology, sociology, and anthropology.6 In 
particular, concern has been raised that there is no such thing as an external criterion of a 
good death and that it is more dependent on the perspectives of the dying individual.10
In this article we use the terms “good death” or “successful dying.” Is successful dying an 
extension of successful aging? Research on successful aging has grown considerably in 
recent years;11 however, there is little agreement as to what specifically constitutes a good 
death or successful dying despite many reviews examining the concept of a good death from 
sociological and philosophical viewpoints12–18 as well as research examining the quality of 
death and dying, which is defined as “the degree to which a person’s preferences for dying 
and the moment of death agree with observations of how the person actually died, as 
reported by others.”19–23 However, far fewer studies have specifically defined, rather than 
conceptualized, what a good death is according to patients, family members, and healthcare 
providers (HCPs). The goal of this article is to review the literature that examined the 
definitions of a good death from the perspectives of such patients, their family members, and 
HCPs.
By examining the perspectives regarding a good death contrasted across different 
stakeholders, our aim is to identify potential unmet needs of patients and to suggest an 
approach to achieve a multifaceted and individualized experience for patients approaching 
death. Because a dearth of literature examines this important topic, our review is limited by

 the quantity and quality of studies available to evaluate. To our knowledge, no review to date 
has examined and compiled definitions of good death as defined explicitly by patients, 
family members, and HCPs or examined the differences among these stakeholders’ 
viewpoints. This is an area of considerable public health significance and impact on the 
patients, their families, and the overall healthcare system. The present article is also intended 
to serve as a call to action to highlight the need for more patient-focused research and open 
public dialogues on successful dying.
METHODS
Data Sources
We searched PubMed and PsycINFO databases from inception through November 2015 
using the following terms: (definition of) AND (good OR successful OR peaceful) AND 
(Death OR Dying); (good) OR (successful OR peaceful) AND (“Death and Dying”); 
(“Terminal Care”[Mesh] AND “Quality of Life”[Mesh] AND “Attitude to Death”[Mesh]); 
(“Terminal Care”[Mesh]) AND “Attitude to Death”[Mesh] AND (define OR definition); 
good death and dignity; good death and end of life preferences; good death and quality of 
death and dying.
Selection of Articles
We restricted our search to include articles that met the following criteria: published in 
English in peer-reviewed journals and provided quantitative or qualitative data that 
specifically defined or used a measure of good death as the main aim or outcome of the 
study. We eliminated all duplicate articles from these searches. Additionally, we reviewed 
the reference lists of all articles that were relevant as well as recent review papers that 
examined a good death.15,24,25 There were no instances of overlapping samples.
Two authors (EAM and JVG) independently searched PubMed and PsycINFO databases for 
appropriate articles according to the key words mentioned above. Individual articles were 
independently coded for themes and subthemes by the two authors. If there was a 
disagreement between the two, a third author (DVJ) was consulted to help reach a 
consensus. Specific information about each article was stored in an Excel database.
Most initial search results (3,434) were excluded because of irrelevance to the subject matter 
in the title or abstract (e.g., “good cell death,” “good bone death,” “animal death,” etc.), 
which resulted in 392 articles for further review. After a more detailed examination, we 
narrowed these articles down to 36 relevant to the present review (Fig. 1). Articles were 
excluded if they were focused solely on euthanasia or assisted suicide or on specific methods 
of enhancing quality of care at the end of life, unless one of the specific aims of the study 
was to define good death or successful dying.
References from review papers of a good death were examined in detail to see if they met 
our inclusion criteria. Twenty-seven articles contained qualitative methods, 5 articles used 
quantitative methods, and 4 articles contained mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative). 
Of the quantitative and mixed-methods studies (N = 9), 3 articles used standardized 
measures of a good death, including the Preferences about Death and Dying questionnaire,26

 The Concept of a Good Death scale,27 and The Good Death Inventory.28 The other six 
studies had developed their own quantitative measures (e.g., attitudinal measures of a good 
death);29 a 12-item questionnaire based on 12 principles of a good death according to the 
Future of Health Care of Older People report;30,31 a 57-item questionnaire based on a 
previous qualitative study;32 44 items of attributes important at the end of life developed 
from focus groups and in-depth interviews with patients, family members, and HCPs;33 and 
a 72-item survey on perceptions of end-of-life care.34
Coding of Articles
Two authors (EAM and JVG) independently read all 36 articles. We used the method of 
coding consensus, co-occurrence, and comparison outlined by Williams et al.35 and rooted 
in grounded theory to generate common themes of a good death. Four consensus meetings 
were held between two coders (EAM and JVG) to create the final coding scheme after 
resolving any disagreements. We began with 38 themes, which were narrowed to 11 themes 
in a consensus meeting involving three authors (EAM, JVG, and DVJ). Two authors (EAM 
and JVG) then independently coded each definition supplied in the 36 articles, which were 
then mapped onto the 11 core themes. If an item did not fit, it was placed in the “Other” core 
theme. Inter-rater reliability was calculated for the independent raters by use of the kappa 
statistic. The inter-rater reliability for the coders was kappa = 0.896 (p < 0.0.000; standard 
error: 0.023), which was a satisfactory level of agreement.36 Discrepancies were further 
discussed by two authors (EAM and JVG), with a third author (DVJ) consulted, when 
needed, to reach a final consensus on each definition.
The sources of each definition were separated into three groups: (1) patients’ perspectives (N 
= 20), (2) prebereaved and bereaved family members’ perspectives (N = 10), and (3) HCPs’ 
perspectives (N = 18). Patient populations consisted of those with advanced cancer, chronic 
illnesses, HIV/AIDS, as well as the general population. Family members’ perspectives were 
prebereavement (N = 1) or postbereavement (N = 9). HCPs included physicians, nurses, 
social workers, and spiritual counselors. HCP perspectives could not be further broken down 
into specific subgroups (e.g., physicians versus nurses) because these subgroups were 
usually combined in the studies reviewed. Of the 36 reviewed articles, 29 were coded into 
one category and 7 were coded into more than one group, 2 articles coded into two groups, 
and 5 articles were coded into all three.
Analyses
We did not conduct a formal meta-analysis in light of differences among the studies in terms 
of depth of information and methods used to assess stakeholders’ (especially patients’) 
demographics, medical diagnoses, treatment status, cognitive assessment, and so on. By 
definition, meta-analysis comprises statistical methods for contrasting and combining results 
from different studies in the hope of identifying patterns among study results, sources of 
disagreement among those results, or other interesting relationships that may come to light 
in the context of multiple studies (p. 652).37 This type of analysis was not possible for our 
data for the reasons mentioned above. Additionally, weighting was not done because 
qualitative and quantitative studies were combined. However, because all studies provided 
stakeholder frequency of responses that endorsed specific themes of a good death, we were

 able to aggregate frequencies across studies to calculate the mean percentages for different 
domains of what is perceived to be part of a good death. As such, we calculated the means 
and standard deviations or percentages, as appropriate, and reported the rate of endorsement 
of each of the 11 codes within each of the sources (e.g., patients, family members, and 
HCPs).
RESULTS
In total, 36 articles met our search criteria. These studies were published between 1996 and 
2015. Total sample sizes across all studies reviewed ranged from 3 to 2,548 (mean: 184.4; 
standard deviation: 440.8). As one may expect, qualitative studies had much smaller sample 
sizes than quantitative investigations. Table 1 summarizes demographics of the patients 
included in individual studies. The age range of patients spanned 14–93 years (mean: 89.7; 
standard deviation: 16.6), with 50% of patient perspective articles including individuals over 
age 60 years. Age was somewhat skewed because several articles only reported a range 
rather than the mean age. There was a relatively even distribution between men and women 
across all studies. The studies reviewed had been conducted in the United States (N = 13), 
United Kingdom (7), Japan (3), Netherlands (3), Thailand (2), Iran (1), Israel (1), Canada 
(1), Nova Scotia (1), Saudi Arabia (1), South Korea (1), and Sweden (1), Turkey (1).
Themes and Subthemes of Successful Death Definitions
Eleven themes were identified, and each consisted of 2 to 4 subthemes, which are presented 
in Table 2. The most frequently appearing theme for a good death across all groups was 
“preferences for the dying process,” which was reported in 94% of the articles in the sample. 
These preferences for the dying process included the following subthemes: the death scene 
(how, who, where, and when), dying during sleep, and preparation for death (e.g., advanced 
directives, funeral arrangements). “Pain-free status” was the second most frequent core 
theme of good death in the sample (81%) followed by “emotional well-being” (64%). 
Examples from patients included the following statements: “Painless. I mean pain is my 
biggest fear, you know. I don’t want to die in pain,” “a good death would be having the 
things that you wanted to have taken care of before you die done so you can be at peace with 
it.”42 Additionally, some statements included that thinking about death and dying made 
individuals feel “afraid and depressed.”50
Four themes—life completion, treatment preferences, dignity, and family—were endorsed 
by more than 50% of all three stakeholder groups (Table 3). The theme of life completion 
contained subthemes of saying goodbye, feeling that life was well lived, and acceptance of 
impending death. Treatment preferences included subthemes related to not prolonging life, a 
belief that all available treatments were used, a sense of control over treatment choices, and 
euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide. The theme of dignity consisted of being respected as 
an individual and maintaining independence, whereas the theme of family included family 
support, family accepting of death, the family is prepared for the death, and not being a 
burden to family.
Prebereaved and bereaved family members rated eight of the core themes at 70% and higher, 
the most frequent themes being preferences for dying process (100%), pain-free status

 (90%), and life completion (80%). Relationship with HCPs was found to be the least 
important specific theme among all three stakeholders.
Among HCPs, preference for dying process (94%) was the most frequently endorsed core 
theme of a good death, followed by pain-free status (83%), dignity (67%), and emotional 
well-being (67%). HCPs had the lowest endorsement for three core themes: life completion 
(56%), relationship with HCPs (39%), and quality of life (22%). Examples from HCPs 
included statements such as “having a patient pass quietly so not to disturb other patients,” 
“having the death occur at a time when there was adequate staff,” and “not having used 
excessive or futile treatments.”53,54 Some statements included regret for administered 
treatment or a concern that the medical staff was unable to provide appropriate care.
Differences in frequencies of themes among the stakeholder groups were greatest for quality 
of life, which was rated more frequently in family perspective articles (70%) than in patient 
and HCP perspective articles (35% and 22%, respectively) (Table 3). Similarly, prebereaved 
and bereaved family members identified the importance of family and maintaining dignity at 
a rate (70%) somewhat higher than that in the patient perspective articles (55% each). In 
contrast, religiosity/spirituality was endorsed somewhat more in patient perspective articles 
(65%) than in family perspective articles (50%). Supplementary Table S1 lists core themes 
endorsed by each stakeholder group in individual articles.
DISCUSSION
In this review we identified a number of themes important to a good death that both 
converge and diverge across stakeholders. To our knowledge, this review is the first 
systematic attempt to review the empirical literature on both the definition of a good death or 
successful dying according to patients, family members, and HCPs and differences across 
these stakeholder perspectives. Our review identified a general consensus among patients, 
family members, and HCPs in regard to pain-free status and specific preferences for the 
dying process; however, there were some notable discrepancies, for example, family 
members rated quality of life as more important than patient and HCP articles.
This review has several limitations. The first challenge is the variability among the articles 
reviewed in reporting data such as respondent characteristics. There were no common 
measures of a “good death” used in different investigations, which limited our capacity to 
aggregate results for conducting a meta-analysis or meta-regression. There was also an 
imbalance in sample sizes across qualitative and quantitative studies. We restricted our 
search to English-language and peer-reviewed articles, which might have limited the scope 
of our review. Also, some differences in perspectives of different stakeholders discussed 
below are rather small in magnitude, compounded by the limited amount of published 
literature in this emerging area of empirical research; consequently, we were underpowered 
to make statistical comparisons across study groups.
Empirical research on what comprises a good death began only a couple of decades ago, and 
several aspects of the methodology used in previously published studies were suboptimal. 
Most articles reviewed did not report information regarding specific demographics of

 patients, including age, culture/ethnicity, diagnoses, study inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 
recruitment procedures. Additionally, there was no mention of the length of time between 
the interview or survey and the patients’ death, which might have an important impact on 
specific wishes, desires, and needs as one nears the end of life as well as perceptions of what 
constitutes a good death, which could change over time and as the process is experienced. In 
regards to the investigations of family members, most studies included postbereavement 
family members, and therefore perspectives of prebereavement family members were not 
well represented. Finally, HCPs were often grouped together in the reports, and it is not 
known what percentage of HCPs were physicians, nurses, social workers, spiritual 
counselors, and so on. Furthermore, there was little information on how many, if any, of 
these HCPs had directly cared for dying patients or received training in such care.
Despite these limitations, we were able to identify some consistency among the three 
stakeholder groups in their perceptions of what constituted a good death. In more than 85% 
of the articles reviewed, having patient-focused preferences for the dying process and being 
pain-free were key components of achieving a good death according to patients, prebereaved 
and bereaved family members, and HCPs. Physicians, nurses, and other HCPs viewed 
optimal pain control and keeping the patient comfortable as a requirement for a good 
death.17,29,33,51 This is also consistent with the overall philosophy of hospice and palliative 
care, which focuses on decreasing pain and suffering while improving quality of life for both 
patients and family members.55
Although family members’ perspectives seemed to be more in tune with the patients’ needs 
and desires for end-of-life care than HCPs’, there were also some differences between 
family members and patients in what themes they believed to be important for a good death. 
For example, quality of life was rated as an important component of a good death twice as 
often by family members (70%) as by patients (35%). Most family perspective articles were 
conducted with bereaved family members who were often asked to recall the death of a 
loved one. Although we cannot make assumptions regarding the inferences of these findings, 
it could be argued that family members and patients define quality of life differently. The 
quality of life literature is large and beyond the scope of this review; however, it is worth 
further investigating how patients, family members, and HCPs define quality of life near the 
end of life to help understand and define this construct more precisely.
Additionally, “dignity” was reported to be an important component of a good death in 70% 
of family articles compared with 55% of the articles that included patient perspectives. 
Although the difference is not large, the finding is counterintuitive to previous research, 
which has argued that patients greatly value maintaining dignity during the late phase of 
their life.56,57 However, definitions of dignity vary, and the concept of dignity may have 
been absorbed into other themes from the stakeholders’ perspectives. Over the last 17 years, 
The Oregon Death with Dignity Act has consistently publicized that the three most 
important concerns reported among patients near the end of their lives include a loss of 
autonomy (91%), a decrease in the ability to participate in activities that made life enjoyable 
(86%), and a loss of dignity (71%).58 Furthermore, in a study conducted in 2002 by 
Chochinov et al.,56 palliative care patients reported that “not being treated with respect or 
understanding” (87%) and “feeling a burden to others” (87%) significantly impacted their

 sense of dignity. Therefore, our findings do not necessarily mean that dignity is less 
important for dying patients but that perhaps patients have a difficult time expressing the 
need for or concept of dignity to others.
The role of religiosity/spirituality was also somewhat discrepant between patients and other 
groups. Nearly two-thirds of patients (65%) in the articles reviewed expressed a desire to 
have religious or spiritual practices fulfilled as a theme of a good death; in contrast, only 
50% of family members rated this theme as important. It should be added that hospice care 
teams are typically supposed to be composed of physicians, nurses, home health aides, 
social workers, as well as clergy or spiritual counselors.59 However, in our current sample 
not all the patients were receiving hospice services, which might have contributed to a lack 
of recognition of the importance of religiosity/spirituality, because many organizations and 
hospitals do not have clergy members or spiritual counselors available on site, especially for 
diverse groups of patients.
Finally, although some literature exists on pain and physical symptoms, there is a dearth of 
research examining the psychological aspects of a good death, particularly from a patient 
perspective.12 Our review indicates that patients view emotional well-being as a critical 
component of a successful death, as do family members and HCPs. Although it is important 
that we attend to the patient’s physical symptoms and pain control, it is crucial that the 
healthcare system expand the care beyond treating these symptoms and more closely address 
psychological, social, and religiosity/spirituality themes in end-of-life care for both patients 
and families. Patients view the end of life as encompassing not only the physical 
components of death but also psychosocial and spiritual concerns.33 Both the American 
Psychological Association and the European Association for Palliative Care have identified a 
need for mental health professionals to address and measure psychological concerns at the 
end of life.60,61 Further research regarding the psychological components of a good death is 
needed, especially in developing effective screening measures and appropriate interventions 
for dying patients.12
Future Directions
This review suggests an obvious need for more research to examine the concept of a good 
death from patients’ perspectives to deliver quality care that is individualized to meet each 
patient’s needs8,62 as well as the needs of their families. The discrepancies among patient, 
family member, and HCP perspectives on successful dying in this review indicate a critical 
need for a dialogue about death among all stakeholders involved in the care of each 
individual patient. It is important that we not only understand but also further investigate 
how addressing the themes identified in this review, both convergent and discrepant among 
stakeholders, may influence patient-related outcomes.
Well-designed studies are also necessary to qualitatively and quantitatively examine the 
concept of successful dying according to patients themselves, because this would have the 
potential to influence HCP care practices and to help family members meet the needs of 
their dying loved ones. Qualitative research could lead to the development of measurement 
tools for successful dying that allow for real-time modifications in care and examine how 
specific diseases and interventions intersect values and beliefs that are most important to 
Meier et al.

 patients nearing the end of their lives. Future studies would also benefit from mixed 
qualitative–quantitative method designs that compare people at the end of life with others 
who have chronic but earlier stage diseases (e.g., heart or lung disease). Additionally, it 
would be important to include different age cohorts (young, middle-aged, and older adults) 
to determine whether age impacts the themes that constitute a good death. Investigations of 
large numbers of demographically, medically, and psychosocially well-characterized patients 
from diverse ethnic and cultural groups, using standardized and validated instruments for 
successful dying, and seeking perspectives of these patients along with their prebereaved and 
bereaved family members and HCPs are recommended to inform the best practices in caring 
for dying patients and their families. Finally, future studies should use a clearly delineated 
sampling strategy that would then allow generalization to a larger population of patients, 
family members, and HCPs.
Finally, an important goal of this review is to issue a call for action to the professional and 
lay community to accelerate its open dialogue regarding death and dying, as the United 
States has a largely “death-phobic” culture.63 Although individuals in many states in the 
country are formally asked and encouraged to consider advanced directives and organ 
donations, should we, as clinicians, also not ask our older patients to stipulate their 
preferences for the dying process? If, as a society, we begin to address the question of how 
people want to die and what they actually need and want at the end of their lives, perhaps we 
can enable more people to obtain a good death, reaching their full potential, with dignity and 
whole-person well-being. As stated eloquently by Gawande,7 “…our most cruel failure in 
how we treat the sick and the aged is the failure to recognize that they have priorities beyond 
merely being safe and living longer; that the chance to shape one’s story is essential to 
sustaining meaning in life; that we have the opportunity to refashion our institutions, our 
culture, and our conversations in ways that transform the possibilities for the last chapters of 
everyone’s lives.”
