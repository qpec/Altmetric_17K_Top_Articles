IMPORTANCE Formal rehabilitation programs, including inpatient programs, are often assumed
to optimize recovery among patients after undergoing total knee arthroplasty. However, these
programs have not been compared with any outpatient or home-based programs.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether 10 days of inpatient rehabilitation followed by a monitored
home-based program after total knee arthroplasty provided greater improvements than
a monitored home-based program alone in mobility, function, and quality of life.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this 2-group, parallel, randomized clinical trial,
including a nonrandomized observational group, conducted at 2 public, high-volume
arthroplasty hospitals in Sydney, Australia (July 2012-December 2015), 940 patients with
osteoarthritis undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty were screened for eligibility.
Of the 525 eligible patients consecutively invited to participate, 165 were randomized either
to receive inpatient hospital rehabilitation and home-based rehabilitation or to receive
home-based rehabilitation alone, and 87 patients enrolled in the observation group.
INTERVENTIONS Eighty-one patients were randomized to receive 10 days of hospital
inpatient rehabilitation followed by an 8-week clinician-monitored home-based program, 84
were randomized to receive the home-based program alone, and 87 agreed to be in the
observational group, which included only the home-based program.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mobility at 26 weeks after surgery, measured with the
6-minute walk test. Secondary outcomes included the Oxford Knee Score, which ranges from
0 (worst) to 48 (best) and has a minimal clinically important difference of 5 points; and EuroQol
Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D) visual analog scale, which ranges from
0 (worst) to 100 (best), and has a minimal clinically important difference of 23 points.
RESULTS Among the 165 randomized participants, 68% were women, and the cohort had
a mean age, 66.9 years (SD, 8.4 years). There was no significant difference in the 6-minute
walk test between the inpatient rehabilitation and either of the 2 home program groups
(mean difference, −1.01; 95% CI, −25.56 to 23.55), nor in patient-reported pain and function
(knee score mean difference, 2.06; 95% CI, −0.59 to 4.71), or quality of life (EQ-5D visual
analog scale mean difference, 1.41; 95% CI, −6.42 to 3.60). The number of postdischarge
complications for the inpatient group was 12 vs 9 among the home group, and there were
no adverse events reported that were a result of trial participation.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults undergoing uncomplicated total knee
arthroplasty, the use of inpatient rehabilitation compared with a monitored home-based
program did not improve mobility at 26 weeks after surgery. These findings do not support
inpatient rehabilitation for this group of patients.

I
n 2015 more than 49 000 total knee arthroplasties were
performed in Australia, with the incidence per 100 000
population increasing from 115 to 207.3 since 2005.1 From
1980 to 2010, the prevalence of total knee arthroplasty in
the United States increased 11-fold.2 Formalized rehabilita-
tion is often provided after surgery, yet the modes of pro-
vision vary greatly.3 Inpatient rehabilitation is one commonly
used treatment option in Australia. Recent estimates indi-
cate that a median 40% of privately insured patients per sur-
geon were transferred to inpatient rehabilitation in 2014,
although this figure ranges from 0% to 100%.4 This contrasts
with the public sector utilization rate of 21%,5 suggesting that
factors other than need drive the high utilization rate in the
private sector.
Use of inpatient rehabilitation after surgery also varies
internationally. Both Switzerland and the United States
have a high uptake,6,7 the latter including less intensive
rehabilitation in skilled nursing facilities.8,9 In Canada and
the United Kingdom, inpatient rehabilitation is uncommon
after total knee arthroplasty.7,10 This variability in use sug-
gests either overuse or underuse, and given the added costs
associated with its provision, it is important to determine its
efficacy compared with other options.
Because the majority of procedures are performed in
the private sector in Australia11 and because their number is
expected to increase worldwide as the population ages,
the question of whether inpatient rehabilitation yields
superior outcomes to less costly alternatives is of consider-
able interest.
Except, to our knowledge, for a randomized clinical trial
(RCT)12 involving Canadian patients who underwent either hip
or knee arthroplasty, no published RCT has compared inpa-
tient rehabilitation to any clinic-based program or to a moni-
tored (clinician-supervised) or unmonitored (unsupervised)
home program.
This RCT was conducted to determine if 10 days of inpa-
tient rehabilitation followed by a monitored home program
provided greater improvements than a monitored home pro-
gram alone in mobility, function, and quality of life.
Trial Design and Methods
Study Oversight
An independent data and safety monitoring board was estab-
lished to monitor safety and provide advice on issues regard-
ing scientific aspects of the trial. This board comprised a re-
habilitationphysician,physicaltherapist,andstatistician.Only
one initial board meeting was held because there were no ad-
verse events reported.
Trial Design and Ethical Approval
The trial was a multicenter, 2-group parallel RCT with a third
observational group (Figure). Ethical approval was granted
by St Vincent’
s Hospital human research ethics commit-
tee. Written, informed consent was obtained from those
willing to participate as well as provide baseline measures.
The study design has been published elsewhere13; the study
protocol is detailed in Supplement 1. Protocol changes
are summarized in eMethods 1 in Supplement 2, but im-
portant changes included change in primary outcome from
the proportion of participants attaining a minimum walk
speed to distance walked in the 6-minute walk test; addition
of a second recruiting hospital; and inclusion of an observa-
tional group.
Recruitment and Consent
Participants were recruited from 2 high-volume arthroplasty
hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Recruitment started at the sec-
ond site halfway through the study, after further funding was
secured. Consecutive patients presenting for primary unilat-
eral total knee arthroplasty were screened for eligibility.
To be eligible, participants had to be older than 40 years
with a primary diagnosis of osteoarthritis and to undergo a pri-
mary, unilateral total knee arthroplasty.
Major exclusion criteria were having a predisposition to
be discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation facility due to
lack of social support (lack of an able caregiver); having other
major coexisting physical impairments such as hemiplegia or
amputation; not being able to read English; and being unable
to perform a home exercise program without support from
another person.14 After surgery, an inability to participate in
the planned programs due to a complication was also an
exclusion criterion.
Patients presenting at each site’
s preadmission clinic—
typically within 6 weeks of surgery—were identified and
screened by research personnel through chart review and
direct questioning. Screening logs recorded the reasons
invited patients were ineligible and detailed why otherwise
eligible patients declined participation. Eligible persons who
preferred to receive the home program, rather than be ran-
domized, were invited to participate in an observational
group and were followed up for 6 months after surgery. A
selection bias toward inpatient rehabilitation was noted on
commencement of the study. An observational group was
followed up for analysis of a possible preference effect
between those randomized to receive the home program and
those who received this voluntarily.
Key Points
Question Does inpatient rehabilitation result in better mobility
following total knee arthroplasty than a monitored home-based
program?
Findings This clinical trial randomized 165 adults free of
significant complication after arthroplasty to 10 days of hospital
inpatient rehabilitation followed by an 8-week, clinician-
monitored, home-based program or home-based program only
and were compared with an observation group of 87 patients who
also participated in the home-based program. There was no
significant difference in the 6-minute walk test between any of the
groups at the primary end point of 26 weeks.
Meaning For adults undergoing uncomplicated total knee
arthroplasty, inpatient rehabilitation did not improve mobility
compared with a monitored home program.

Randomization and Allocation Concealment
Randomization took place once it had been confirmed
that participants were cleared for discharge by the fifth day
after surgery. Clearance for discharge was determined by
patients’ability to mobilize independently and negotiate
stairs, with or without an aid. If it was determined that there
was a need for inpatient rehabilitation, such patients were
no longer eligible.
Acentralized,telephone-basedrandomizationservicewas
used by the coordinating investigator for allocating partici-
pants in a 1:1 ratio. Participants were randomized by site to 1
of the 2 intervention groups using the method of minimiza-
tion (adaptive stratified sampling).15 This approach aims to re-
duce imbalance between groups on various prognostic fac-
tors that can occur despite random allocation. Age (≤68 y,
>68 y), height (≤163 cm, >163 cm), and sex (man, woman) were
used as stratifying variables because they are known to affect
the primary outcome.16
Blinding
Outcome assessors were blind to group allocation and not in-
volved in providing interventions. Because physical thera-
pists delivering the intervention could not be blind to inter-
vention, they did not play a part in the collection or analysis
of outcomes and only provided 1 of the treatment options.
Interventions
Hospital Inpatient Rehabilitation
In accordance with Australian rehabilitation standards,17 par-
ticipants admitted to a rehabilitation unit each received
twice-daily supervised sessions comprising an hour to an
hour and a half of one-to-one physical therapy and an hour to
an hour and a half of class-based exercises. These sessions
comprised general aerobic components as well as general
functional and muscle-specific exercises focused on restoring
knee mobility, lower limb strength, and normal neuromuscu-
lar coordination, and gait patterns (eMethods 2 in Supple-
ment 2). Regardless of performance level, participants were
required to stay for 10 days so that variation in treatment
received (in this case, duration of care) was not a confounder.
Prior to discharge, participants were familiarized with the
home program as described below.
Home Program
The home program, which was the usual care provided at
the sites, was broadly based on the home program used in a
recent RCT.18 It was informed by exercise guidelines devel-
oped for older patients19 and patients with osteoarthritis.20
Approximately 2 weeks after surgery, participants allocated
to the home program attended 1 group-based outpatient
exercise session in the physical therapy department. The
home program was rehearsed and exercises individualized
as required due to comorbidities. As with the inpatient pro-
gram, this home program comprised general aerobic com-
ponents as well as general functional and muscle-specific
exercises (eMethods 3 in Supplement 2). Participants
were encouraged to attend 1 to 2 classes from the third to
10th week after surgery, to assist exercise progression and
permit discussion of ongoing issues with therapists. Par-
ticipants received a booklet detailing the home program
and were permitted to contact the therapist by telephone in
this period. They were also required to complete a diary
detailing program adherence, health care utilization, and
return-to-work data. To ensure that variation in attendance
in the outpatient visits was not a confounder, all partici-
pants (regardless of group) were prescribed the same num-
ber of sessions.
Follow-up Assessments
Follow-up assessments took place at 10, 26, and 52 weeks
after surgery and were performed by trained assessors
blinded to group allocation. Research personnel called each
participant within the week preceding their follow-up
appointments to promote participant retention and comple-
tion of follow-up.
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome was the walking distance at 26 weeks
measured using the 6-minute walk test,16 for which partici-
pants were asked to walk fast laps of a 30-m flat track for 6
minutes, with verbal encouragement provided by the asses-
sor at the end of each lap. The 6-minute walk test is a valid,
reliable, responsive measure of functional mobility for knee
osteoarthritis and following total knee arthroplasty.21 A func-
tional outcome based on a physical test was considered an
appropriate choice because improvement in mobility is a pri-
mary goal of physical rehabilitation programs.3,22 In order to
aid interpretation of the relevance of any between-group dif-
ferences in the 6-minute walk test observed and in the
absence of data describing the minimum clinically important
distance for this test after total knee arthroplasty, we incor-
porated a nested study to evaluate the minimal important
improvement for this test.23
Secondary outcomes comprised both patient-reported
and observer-measured outcomes including the Knee Injury
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (subscales range, 0
[worst]-100 [best]; minimal clinically important difference,
8-10),24 knee flexion (end) range of motion (<100°, ≥100°),25
the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire
(EQ-5D) descriptive index26 (range, 1 [best possible health]
through 0 [death] to −0.59 [worse than death]; minimal clini-
cally important improvement, 0.31),27 EQ-5D visual analog
scale26 (range, 0 [worst] to 100 [best]; minimal clinically
important improvement, 23),27 Oxford Knee Score28 (range,
0 [worst] to 48 [best]; minimal clinically important differ-
ence, 5),29 and a 15-m walk test. Direct and indirect health
care costs, including visits to health professionals, were also
captured using data recorded in diaries and face-to-face
interviews.30 A cost-benefit analysis was planned if inpatient
therapy was shown to be superior.
Post Hoc Outcomes
Patient satisfaction with rehabilitation was collected at 10
weeks using a 20-cm visual analog scale anchored with “no
satisfaction” (0 cm) and “complete satisfaction” (20 cm). Time
off work was also captured.

Comorbid, sociodemographic, and anthropometric data
were collected at baseline. Postdischarge complication
(presentation to emergency department, readmission, reop-
eration, knee manipulation, death) and adverse event data
(eg, falls) were collected until 52 weeks after surgery by
self-report at follow-up visits and by a review of hospital
electronic medical records. Preference for rehabilitation
mode (monitored home-based rehabilitation program, inpa-
tient rehabilitation program, or either) was ascertained prior
to surgery. As per routine practice, Functional Independence
Measure scores were collected on admission and discharge
for participants who received inpatient rehabilitation.
Statistical Analysis
A detailed statistical analysis plan is included in the trial pro-
tocol in Supplement 1. The statistician who conducted the data
analyses was blinded to group allocation.
The primary end point was functional mobility at 26
weeks after surgery. In the absence of a known minimal
important difference for this test following total knee arthro-
plasty, we used a conventional estimate of a moderate effect
size. Based on an SD of 120 m18 and using the 0.5-SD criterion
for identifying a moderate effect size, 140 participants were
required to provide 80% power at a significance level of 5%
to detect a 60-m between-group difference in walking dis-
tance at 26 weeks, assuming a dropout rate of less than 10%.
The inclusion of a second recruitment site opportunistically
allowed us to increase the sample to 165, which increased the
power to 90%.
An intention-to-treat analysis31 was the primary prespeci-
fied analysis in which all randomized participants were in-
cluded. A mixed-effect model was implemented to analyze the
primary outcome, incorporating site as a random effect. The
treatment group was the main study factor and the 6-minute
walk test distance at baseline, weight, comorbidities, and pa-
tient preference32 were included as covariates. For partici-
pants with a missing outcome measure at 26 weeks, a single
imputation method was used.33
For the continuous secondary outcome variables mea-
sured repeatedly at 10, 26, and 52 weeks, a multilevel hierar-
chical model was used to estimate the treatment by time
interaction with site as 1 level of random effect and within-
patient repeated measurements as another level of random
effect. Baseline measurements of the outcome variables,
together with weight, comorbidities, site, and participant
preference, were included as covariates. For the binary out-
come variables measured at 10, 26, and 52 weeks (knee flex-
ion >100° or ≤100°), the similarly multilevel hierarchical
model with logit link function was implemented with site
and within-patient measurements as random effects and
with the adjustment of the covariates as above.
The age, sex, and height of participants were used as strati-
fication variables in the randomization procedure via a mini-
mization algorithm. These 3 variables were included as addi-
tionalcovariatesfortheprimaryoutcomeanalysistoincorporate
the possible within-treatment group correlation associated
withstratification.34Themixed-modelanalysisindicatedabove
also included these 3 variables as additional covariates.
For the sensitivity analysis, the above analysis used for
the primary outcome variables was also performed using
the per-protocol sample. Adherence for both groups was
defined as attendance at no less than 2 and no more than 4
outpatient sessions. This was because our operational defini-
tion of a monitored home program (as per other arthroplasty
studies)18,35,36 was attendance at up to 3 outpatient sessions.
If participants regularly exceeded 4 sessions, we could rea-
sonably be criticized for providing usual outpatient–based
care, yet our comparison was intended to be a program of
minimal intervention vs 1 far more intensive (inpatient) pro-
gram (rehabilitation + monitored home program). Adherence
for the inpatient rehabilitation group was further defined as
having had a minimum 7 days of inpatient rehabilitation.
Nonadherent participants were excluded from the per-
protocol analysis.
For analyses involving the observational group, the mean
values of the 6-minute walk test and other secondary out-
comes were compared between the observational group and
thoseinthehomeprogramat26weeks,adjustingfortheafore-
mentioned covariates.
For all analyses, a significance level of .05 was used, and
tests were 2-sided. SAS version 9.4 software was used for sta-
tistical analysis (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Sixty-nine percent of the trial participants were women
(mean age of the randomized cohort, 66.9 years [SD, 8.4
years]; mean body mass index [BMI], 34.7 [SD, 7]; BMI is cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared). Characteristics of the cohorts are summarized in
Table 1 (further details of characteristics and baseline out-
comes are provided in eTable 1 and eTable 2, while a sum-
mary of those eligible who did not participate is provided
eTable 3 in Supplement 2). A total of 165 patients underwent
randomization (Figure). The primary outcome was collected
for 79 participants (98%) in the inpatient rehabilitation group
and for 80 (95%) in the home program. All 165 participants
were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Because
only 6 participants had missing data at the primary end
point, no statistical comparisons between them and those
without missing data were made. The age (range, 51-70
years), sex (women, 5), and BMI (range, 25.0-45.96) profiles
of the 6 participants with missing data were similar to the
other 159 participants. In the per-protocol analysis, 72 par-
ticipants (89%) receiving inpatient rehabilitation and 74 par-
ticipants (88%) in the home program were included. Nine-
teen participants were excluded, 12 for receiving additional
therapy outside of the study treatment and 7 for other proto-
col violations (Figure).
Outcomes
In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no difference in
the primary outcome of the 6-minute walk test among the 2
randomized groups (adjusted mean difference with imputa-
tion, −1.01; 95% CI, −25.56 to 23.55; Table 2). The per-

There were also no between-group differences in the pri-
mary outcome when the home program and observational
(those choosing the home program) groups were compared,
with an adjusted 6-minute walk test mean difference at 26
weeks of −17.00 (95% CI, −41.27 to 7.28).
There were no significant between-group differences in

Beyond postoperative complications listed in Table 3, no
other adverse events were reported.
Post Hoc Outcomes
There was a significant between-group difference for
participant-rated satisfaction with rehabilitation (8.9%; 95%
CI, 3.0%-14.9%; Table 3), but there were no significant
between-group differences in return to work data (−0.23;
95% CI, −3.76 to 3.30).
Discussion
In this RCT, inpatient rehabilitation followed by a monitored
home program did not provide superior mobility than did a
monitored home program alone at 26 weeks after surgery
for patients with uncomplicated arthroplasty who were
deemed appropriate for discharge directly home. As per the
study protocol,13 cost-effectiveness analysis was not under-
taken in light of the nonsuperior findings. Nevertheless,
recent evidence suggested cost-effectiveness is reduced if
total knee arthroplasty is associated with a stay in an inpa-
tient rehabilitation facility.37 Given the increasing numbers
of people undergoing the procedure worldwide38,39 and
given the concerns about its sustainability,40 clinicians and
policy makers need to consider the cost implications and
sustainability of the rehabilitation options available for
adults undergoing total knee arthroplasty. These consider-
ations have motivated new models of care delivery and
reimbursement such as the Comprehensive Care for Joint
Replacement model in the United States,41 whereby nonin-
patient therapies are encouraged. Given that the amount of
inpatient therapy provided daily in the current study is
comparable with that provided in inpatient rehabilitation

facilities in the United States,9 the findings of this study
suggest that patients who have undergone arthroplasty are
not being disadvantaged by these initiatives in terms of
physical recovery. Considering that the home-based pro-
gram resulted in the same outcomes as the highest-intensity
rehabilitation model, any other rehabilitation model provid-
ing less intensive rehabilitation therapy than the US model,
including skilled nursing facilities, would be expected to
yield similar results. The findings should also inform reha-
bilitation models elsewhere, encouraging clinicians to focus
on the most cost-effective options. Understanding why
inpatient rehabilitation may be associated with higher-level
satisfaction (as was the case for our study) would also be
useful for informing alternative models.
This study has several strengths. The baseline charac-
teristics of the randomized sample appear comparable with
those of other related RCTs,18,35 as is the magnitude of the
change over time of the primary outcome,35,42 conferring
generalizability of study results to other cohorts. The
between-group difference observed in the primary analysis
(1 m) was far less than what was found to be the minimal
important difference (improvement) in the associated
nested study (26-55 m).23 Thus, the difference observed was
neither statistically nor clinically relevant. The large sample
size, with very little loss to follow-up, ensured that the sta-
tistical power of the study remained high. Therapeutic
validity was also high given that the 2 treatment groups
were markedly different, with the inpatient group based on
mandated daily hours of prescribed therapy.17 The inclusion
of the observational group allowed comparison between
those who received the home program because they pre-
ferred it and those who received it because they were allo-
cated to it. It could account for a possible preference effect
that can be present in trials in which the intervention can-
not be blinded.32 Both the observational group and inclu-
sion of preference in the analysis clearly showed that prefer-
ence did not affect study outcomes.
Limitations
This study has limitations. The generalizability of the
results to the private health care setting within Australia is
unclear. However, patients who undergo total knee arthro-
plasty at public and private institutions have been observed
to report similar outcomes for up to a year.43 Thus, insur-
ance status or the public or private sector may not be an
important consideration. The results apply only to patients
deemed appropriate for discharge directly home. No com-
ment can be made on the comparative efficacy of inpatient
therapy for the minority of patients—5% to 10% excluded in
our study—who are deemed to require admission to an inpa-

tient facility based on presenting characteristics such as
significant comorbidity or poor progress after surgery.
Although the assessors were blinded to allocation group,
the participants were not. Considering that the study end
points were either subjective or, for the primary end point,
under volitional control, it is acknowledged that they were
potentially subject to bias. In addition, it is not known if
inpatient therapy produced greater gains prior to 10 weeks.
However, early gains that are no longer apparent at 10
weeks, or do not translate into earlier return to work or less
health resource use, are arguably not meaningful nor would
they justify the cost differential that exists between inpa-
tient and home programs.
Conclusions
Among adults undergoing uncomplicated total knee arthro-
plasty, the use of inpatient rehabilitation compared with a
monitored home-based program did not improve mobility at
26 weeks after surgery. This study finding does not support in-
patient rehabilitation for this group of patients.
