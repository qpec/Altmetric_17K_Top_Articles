Self-harm and violent criminality among young people who 
experienced trauma-related hospital admission during 
childhood: a Danish national cohort study
Roger T Webb, Sussie Antonsen, Matthew J Carr, Louis Appleby, Carsten B Pedersen, Pearl L H Mok
Summary
Background Development of a better understanding of subsequent pathways for individuals who experienced trauma 
during childhood might usefully inform clinicians and public health professionals regarding the causes of self-harm 
and interpersonal violence. We aimed to examine these risks during late adolescence and early adulthood among 
people admitted to hospital following injuries or poisonings during their childhood.
Methods This national cohort study included Danish people born between Jan 1, 1977, and Dec 31, 1997, and was 
linked to the National Patient Register and Psychiatric Central Research Register to identify all people exposed to 
hospital admissions for injuries or poisonings due to self-harm, interpersonal violence, or accidents before their 
15th birthday. Linkage to these two registers and to the National Crime Register enabled ascertainment of self-harm 
and violent offending, respectively, as adverse outcomes at ages 15–35 years. Sex-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs; 
relative risks) and cumulative incidence percentage values (absolute risks) were estimated. The confounding influence 
of parental socioeconomic status was also explored.
Findings 1 087 672 Danish people were included in this study. The prevalence of any trauma-related hospital admission 
was 10% (105 753 per 1 087 672; males: 64 454 [11%]; females: 44 299 [8%]) and for both sexes, accident was by far the 
most prevalent of the categories assessed (males: 59 011 [11%]; females: 40 756 [8%]). Similar patterns of increased 
risk for self-harm and violent criminality were observed in both sexes, although the IRRs were consistently and 
significantly larger in women (self-harm: IRR 1·94 [95% CI 1·85–2·02]; violent criminality: 2·16 [1·97–2·36]) than in 
men (self-harm: 1·61 [1·53–1·69]; violent criminality: 1·58 [1·53–1·63]). Confounding by parental socioeconomic 
status explained little of the increased risks observed. For young adult men, the highest absolute risk observed was for 
violent offending among individuals admitted to hospital for interpersonal violence injury during childhood 
(cumulative incidence 25·0% [95% CI 21·2–28·9]). For young adult women, absolute risk was highest for repeat self-
harm among those admitted to hospital following self-harm during childhood (cumulative incidence 21·4% [95% CI 
19·8–23·1]). More frequent trauma-related hospital admissions in childhood, and being admitted multiple times for 
more than one reason, conferred substantial risk increases among young people, with especially steep gradients of 
this nature observed among women.
Interpretation Trauma-related hospital admission early in life could be a useful marker for childhood distress that 
subsequently predicts internalised and externalised destructive behaviours among youths and young adults and 
might provide a timely opportunity for initiating family-oriented interventions.

Introduction
Trauma-related hospital admission following serious 
injuries 
and 
poisonings, 
whether 
self-inflicted, 
perpetrated by other people, or occurring accidentally, 
can be highly distressing experiences for children and 
their families. Furthermore, these episodes predict short-
term and long-term increases in risk of suicide and other 
causes of premature death,1–4 and they also absorb scarce 
health-care resources disproportionately.4 To inform the 
coordinated development of multiagency initiatives to 
reduce adverse outcome risks among psychosocially 
vulnerable young people, it is therefore necessary to 
better understand the long-term trajectories of children 
who require hospital admission following major injuries 
or poisonings, to help to ensure their safe progression 
through to healthy adult maturity. These trauma-related 
hospital admissions have been described as salient so-
called teachable moments, providing an opportunity to 
deliver considered interventions that could potentially 
prevent future harmful behaviours.5
A paper published in 2015 reported on a large lon-
gitudinal investigation of hospital admissions for violent, 
drug-related or alcohol-related, self-inflicted, and ac-
cidental injury among adolescents aged 10–19 years in 
England.3 The study indicated strong links between this 
exposure and risks of death and emergency readmission

within 10 years of the index hospitalisation episode. 
Two previous investigations reporting results from large 
routinely collected datasets in New Zealand have examined 
subsequent risks of assaultive injury,6 self-injury, and 
suicide,7 without specifying an age range for experiencing 
trauma-related hospital admission. We examined such 
hospital admissions that occurred specifically during 
childhood, to establish the longer-term trajectories of this 
particularly vulnerable group of young people.
Published reports have tended to focus on a single 
adverse outcome, such as youth suicide,8 whereas we set 
out to harness the potential of national Danish registers to 
examine the longer-term trajectories of affected children. 
We investigated self-harm and violent criminality as 
adverse outcomes because self-directed and externalised 
violence are associated harmful behaviours that share 
common causal factors. A Swedish national registry study 
from 2006 reported a five times increasd risk of violent 
crime conviction among people with a history of hospital-
treated self-harm, with an independent doubled risk after 
adjustment for psychiatric comorbidity and environmental 
factors.9 The combined societal costs of these two related 
deleterious behaviours are immense,10 prompting calls for 
concerted action to tackle them in unison.11
The aims of this national cohort study were: (1) to 
estimate the relative and absolute risks of self-harm and 
violent criminality among youths and young adults who 
experienced hospital admission due to injuries and 
poisonings during their childhood; (2) to compare these 
estimates by sex and by cause of hospital admission—
self-harm, interpersonal violence, or accident; (3) to 
assess confounding by parental socioeconomic status 
(SES); and (4) to evaluate effect modification by 
frequency of and multiple reasons for trauma-related 
hospital admission during childhood. We anticipated 
observing especially increased risks among individuals 
admitted to hospital as children following interpersonal 
violence or self-harm versus the reference category of 
people who had no experience of trauma-related hospital 
admissions during childhood. We also examined 
exposure to hospital admission following accidental 
injury or poisoning as an additional comparison. We 
acknowledge that a sizeable proportion of admissions 
following accidents might not have been anywhere near 
as traumatising to the affected children as those that 
followed internalised or externalised violence.
Methods
Study design and participants
Since 1968 the Civil Registration System has registered 
all Danish residents12 by capturing date and place of 
birth, sex, and continuously updated vital status inform-
ation. Its mandatory unique personal identification num-
ber 
ing system enables complete and accurate linkage to 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched for article titles published in English in MEDLINE 
and Embase up until Feb 24, 2017, that included the following 
combination of terms: “child” or “youth” or “adolesc” AND 
“hospitali” or “admitted” or “admission” AND “trauma” or 
“self-harm” or “self-inflict” or “self-injur” or “self-poison” or 
“suicid” or “violen” or “assault” or “accident” or “death” or “die” 
or “mortality”. We discovered that the existing evidence-base 
for this topic was limited. Previous national registry studies 
have examined links between history of trauma-related 
hospital admission and future risks of self-harm and suicide, 
assaultive injury, emergency readmission, and premature 
death. These studies have consistently shown strong 
associations, but several important research questions remain 
unanswered, including the long-term trajectories of people 
who experienced trauma-related hospital admissions during 
childhood, assessment of self-harm versus violent offending 
risks in the same study cohort, and cumulative risk estimation.
Added value of this study
We did a national cohort study of more than 1 million people. 
We identified all trauma-related hospital admissions during 
childhood through to the 15th birthday and examined adverse 
outcomes between mid-adolescence and age 35 years. We 
compared risks for internalised versus externalised violence, and 
we generated measures of sex-specific absolute risks in this 
population by deriving estimates of cumulative incidence values 
that accounted for competing risks. Around one in seven men 
admitted to hospital during childhood following self-harm and 
one in four due to interpersonal violence will be convicted for 
committing a violent crime by age 35 years. About one in 
five women admitted to hospital after an episode of self-harm or 
interpersonal violence during childhood will be admitted to 
hospital again following self-harm between their 15th and 
35th birthdays.
Implications of all the available evidence
The psychosocial wellbeing of individuals who experienced 
trauma-related hospital admission while growing up warrants 
careful consideration in the development of comprehensive 
strategies to address internalised and externalised violence in 
young people. National clinical guidelines for provision of 
psychosocial assessment target single problems such as self-harm, 
but they could be usefully broadened to encompass other adverse 
events such as hospital admission of children following episodes 
of interpersonal violence or serious accidents. Trauma-related 
hospital admission of a child might present an important 
opportunity to implement a family-oriented intervention in the 
hospital setting, with the proactive purpose of reducing future risk 
of harmful or self-destructive behaviours. Particularly, close 
monitoring and robust support are indicated for young women 
who were admitted to hospital as children on more than one 
occasion following trauma and for those who were admitted 
post trauma for multiple reasons during their childhood.

health-related administrative registers as well as similarly 
comprehensive parent-offspring linkage. The study cohort 
consisted of all people born in Denmark from Jan 1, 1977, 
to Dec 31, 1997, who still resided in Denmark at their 
15th birthday, and whose parents were both Danish-born, 
thereby accounting for increased risks of self-harm and 
violent criminality linked with first and second generation 
immigrant status.13 Furthermore, the study registers 
provided less complete information about experience of 
trauma-related hospital admissions during childhood for 
first-generation immigrants, because only those episodes 
experienced during residence in Denmark are captured in 
the nationwide administrative registers.
In this register-based study, consent to participate from 
cohort members was not needed. Cohort members were 
followed up between their 15th and 35th birthdays. 
Follow-up ended at the first occurrence of the adverse 
outcome of interest, emigration, death, or the final 
observation date of Dec 31, 2012, whichever date was 
earliest. Self-harm and violent criminal offending risks 
were assessed from the 15th birthday and onwards in the 
1977–97 birth cohort. Therefore, the earliest outcome 
ascertainment date was Jan 1, 1992, and the latest was 
Dec 31, 2012, meaning that only those cohort members 
born during 1977 could provide complete follow-up 
information through to their 35th birthdays.
Approval to conduct the study was given by the Danish 
Data Protection Agency, and data access was granted by 
the State Serum Institute and by Statistics Denmark.
Procedures
Classification of trauma-related hospital admissions 
during childhood
Hospital admissions for injuries or poisonings between 
cohort members’ births and their 15th birthdays were 
identified on the basis of ‘‘reason for contact’’ coding 
recorded in the National Patient Register14 and according 
to the 8th15 and 10th16 revisions of the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD) as recorded in the 
National Patient Register and Psychiatric Central 
Research Register,17 as follows: (1) self-harm (‘‘reason for 
contact’’=4; complex ICD-based algorithm published 
previously);18 (2) interpersonal violence (‘‘reason for 
contact’’=3; ICD-8: E960-E969; ICD-10: X85-Y09); and (3) 
accident (‘‘reason for contact’’=2; ICD-8: E800-E949; 
ICD-10: V01-X59). In delineating individuals who were 
admitted to hospital following self-harm during 
childhood, we only included episodes in which the child 
had reached their tenth birthday on the admission date. 
Emergency room and ambulatory care visits could not be 
included in any of the exposure classifications because 
they were only captured in the two hospital registers 
from 1995. Thus, the stringent exposure classification 
included only infants and children who were admitted to 
hospital, thereby providing a proxy for more serious 
episodes that would usually constitute a more traumatic 
experience for affected children.
Ascertainment of adverse outcomes between the 15th 
and 35th birthdays
To ascertain admissions following self-harm occurring 
beyond the 15th birthday, we used the aforementioned 
previously reported complex algorithm18 that entailed 
linkage to and extraction of data from the Psychiatric 
Central Research Register and the National Patient 
Register. The study cohort was also linked to the National 
Crime Register19 to identify all violent crime convictions, 
including homicide, assault, robbery, aggravated burglary 
or arson, possessing a weapon in a public place, violent 
threats, 
extortion, 
human 
trafficking, 
abduction, 
kidnapping, rioting and other public order offenses, 
terrorism, and sexual offences.
Adjustment for parental SES
This potentially important confounding influence was 
measured for the entire study population at cohort 
members’ 15th birthdays according to income quintile, 
highest educational attainment level (primary school, 
high school or vocational training, or higher education) 
and employment status (employed, unemployed, or 
outside the workforce for other reasons). As a sensitivity 
analysis, we compared models adjusted for parental SES 
measured at ages 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years versus 
those adjusted for parental SES measured at age 15 years 
only. These data were extracted from the Integrated 
Database for Labour Market Research.20
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed with SAS statistical software 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). 
Sex- specific analyses are reported throughout this 
report due to substantial differences that we have 
previously shown between male and female incidence 
rates for self-harm and violent criminal offending 
among Danish youths and young adults.21 Incidence 
rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated by fitting log-linear 
Poisson regression models22 adjusted for age group and 
calendar year as time-dependent variables. Parental SES 
was adjusted for using time-fixed variables. The 
outcomes, self-harm and violent crime conviction, were 
examined separately according to time to first event 
since the 15th birthday. Thus, the estimated IRRs 
pertain to these first events only as repeat events were 
not assessed. The reference category for all IRRs 
reported was people who did not experience a hospital 
admission for injury or poisoning between their birth 
and 15th birthday. p values and 95% CIs were calculated 
from likelihood ratio tests. From competing risks 
survival analysis,23 cumulative incidence (absolute risk) 
was calculated as the probability of experiencing the 
specific outcome of interest, taking into account 
emigration or death. As with the IRR estimates, these 
cumulative incidence values were calculated separately 
for each childhood hospital admission exposure type: 
self-harm, interpersonal violence, or accident.

Results
1 087 672 Danish people were enrolled in this study. Table 1 
shows the sex-specific prevalence values for trauma-related 
hospital admissions between cohort members’ births and 
their 15th birthdays, with estimates reported separately by 
reason for hospital admission. The prevalence of any 
trauma-related hospital admission was 10% (105 753 
per 1 087 672; men: 64 454 [11%]; women: 44 299 [8%]) and 
for both sexes, accident was by far the most prevalent of 
the categories assessed (men: 59 011 [11%]; women: 
40 756 [8%]. All estimated prevalence values were 
substantially greater for men than for women, as indicated 
by the male to female prevalence rate ratios (PRRs), except 
for hospital admission following self-harm (PRR 0·58 
[95% CI 0·55–0·61]). The rarest reason for hospital 
admission was interpersonal violence, and this category 
also 
had 
the 
largest 
observed 
male:female 
PRR (1·79 [95% CI 1·59–2·02]).
Table 2 shows the IRRs for adverse outcomes at ages 
15–35 years linked with trauma-related hospital admission 
at least once during childhood. In men and women, there 
was a significant increase in risk for both adverse 
outcomes. Essentially the same patterns of increased risk 
were observed in both sexes, although the IRRs were 
consistently and significantly larger in women (self-harm: 
IRR 1·94 [95% CI 1·85–2·02]; violent criminality: 2·16 
[1·97–2·36]) than in men (self-harm: 1·61 [1·53–1·69]; 
violent criminality: 1·58 [1·53–1·63]). The observed 
associations were only slightly attenuated following 
adjustment for parental SES measured at cohort 
members’ 15th birthdays. Additional adjustment for 
parental SES measured at ages 5 years, 10 years, and 
15 years, compared with adjustment for parental SES 
measured at age 15 years only, made almost no difference 
to the degree of attenuation observed (data not shown).
The IRRs presented in table 3 are reported according to 
reason for hospital admission during childhood (self-
harm, interpersonal violence, or accident) in relation to 
the two adverse outcomes at ages 15–35 years: self-harm 
and violent criminality. Hospital admission during 
childhood following episodes of self-harm or interpersonal 
violence was strongly associated with later risks of self-
harm and violent offending (table 3). Much weaker links 
were seen between childhood hospital admission 
following an accident and the two adverse outcomes 
through older adolescence and young adulthood (table 3). 
Again, the patterns of increased risk as indicated by the 
IRRs were similar for both sexes, although stronger 
associations were noted in women than in men. The 
increase in violent offending risk was almost ten-fold 
among women who experienced hospital admission 
following interpersonal violence during childhood 
(IRR 9·85 [95% CI 6·67–13·92]).
The cumulative incidence percentage values shown in 
table 2 indicate that: (1) for young adult men, the highest 
absolute risk noted was for violent offending among 
individuals admitted to hospital for interpersonal 
violence injury during childhood (cumulative incidence 
25·0% [95% CI 21·2–28·9]); (2) for young adult women, 
absolute risk was highest for subsequent self-harm 
repetition among those admitted to hospital following 
self-harm in childhood (cumulative incidence 21·4% 
[95% CI 19·8–23·1]). Figure 1 shows the substantial sex 
differences in cumulative incidence (absolute risk) across 
the 15–35 years age range. Among men admitted to

hospital during childhood following interpersonal 
violence, about a fifth will have committed a violent 
crime by their 25th birthday and a quarter will have done 
so by age 35 years (figure 1C). Among women admitted 
to hospital during childhood after self-harm, almost a 
fifth will be admitted to hospital again due to self-harm 
repetition by age 25 years (figure 1B).
Figure 2 shows the IRRs for later self-harm and violent 
offending reported separately according to the number of 
times a cohort member experienced a trauma-related 
hospital admission during childhood versus the reference 
category of zero trauma-related hospital admissions. The 
prevalence of multiple hospital admissions was low in the 
study cohort (men: admitted twice, n=5528 [1%]; admitted 
3 times or more, n=742 [<1%]; women: twice, n=3434 [1%]; 
3 times or more, n=427 [<1%]. For both adverse outcomes, 
we noted an incremental increase in the observed IRR 
with 
rising 
frequency 
of 
trauma-related 
hospital 
admissions experienced in childhood, and these dose–
response relations were much stronger in women than in 
men: three or more trauma-related hospital admissions 
(vs none) linked with later self-harm risk (women: IRR 7·40 
[95% CI 5·87–9·17]; men: 2·54 [1·78–3·50]); three or more 
trauma-related hospital admissions (vs none) linked with 
later violent criminality risk (women: IRR 11·02 [95% CI 
7·41–15·65]; men: 2·57 [2·05–3·16]). Similarly, figure 3 
shows IRRs for the two adverse outcomes according to the 
number of trauma-related hospital admission types during 
childhood (self-harm, interpersonal violence, or accident). 
Being admitted to hospital for more than one reason, with 
comparable exposure prevalence of 0·13% (n=742) in men 
versus 0·14% (n=765) in women, was associated with 
substantially greater risks of later self-harm and violent 
offending compared with one reason only. As with hospital 
admission frequency, the risk gradients were again far 
steeper in women than in men: two or three trauma-
related hospital admission types (vs none) linked with later 
self-harm risk (women: IRR 9·18 [95% CI 7·81–10·71]; 
men: 3·73 [2·75–4·92]); two or three trauma-related 
hospital admission types (vs none) linked with later violent 
criminality risk (women: IRR 9·99 [95% CI 7·27– 13·31]; 
men: 2·80 [2·24–3·44]).
Discussion
Incidence rates and cumulative incidence values for self-
harm and violent offending were significantly raised 
among youths and young adults who experienced a 
trauma-related hospital admission at least once during 
their childhood. Confounding by parental SES explained 
very little of these increased risks. In men and women, 
individuals who were admitted to hospital during 
childhood following self-harm or interpersonal violence 
had substantially increased risks for later self-harm and 
violent criminal offending at ages 15–35 years. Around 
one in seven men admitted to hospital during childhood 
following self-harm and one in four due to interpersonal 
violence will be convicted for committing a violent crime 
by age 35 years. About one in five women admitted to 
hospital after an episode of self-harm or interpersonal 
violence during childhood will be admitted to hospital 
again following self-harm between their 15th and 
35th birthdays. As we expected, the increases in risk 
linked with hospital admission as a consequence of an 
accident were far smaller than they were following self-
harm or interpersonal violence, probably reflecting a 
lesser degree of trauma on average and perhaps also 
lower prevalence of environmental and genetic risk 
factors among individuals who experienced these 
episodes. 
More 
frequent 
trauma-related 
hospital 
admissions during childhood, and experiencing hospital 
admissions for multiple types of trauma at such an early 
age, conferred substantial increases in self-harm and 
violent criminality risks through late adolescence and 
young adulthood. Especially steep gradients of this 
nature were noted among female cohort members.
Our review of the existing published literature 
indicated that this topic has not been extensively 
researched, a conclusion that has also been reached by

other investigators.8 The findings generated from 
previous studies do, however, largely concur with what 
we observed. For example, studies done in New Zealand7 
and Sweden8 also showed that history of hospital 
admission for injury caused by interpersonal violence, as 
well as previous hospital-treated episodes of self-harm, 
predict future increased risk of suicidality. Earlier 
research has reported on subsequent risk of assaultive 
injury in individuals with a history of hospital admission 
following self-injury and assault,6 but our cohort study is 
the first to examine links between hospital-treated self-
harm occurring before mid-adolescence and later risk of 
perpetrating violent criminal offence. Consideration of 
sex-specific absolute risk via cumulative incidence 
estimates that accounted for competing risks is another 
distinctive feature of our investigation. Little robust 
epidemiological evidence exists regarding confounding 
by familial SES, but the apparent little influence of this 
phenomenon that we observed concurs with findings 
reported by a previous national registry study examining 
links between hospital admission for injury and later 
suicide risk among Swedish youths.8
We believe that the findings generated from this study 
are likely to be generalisable internationally. Our national 
cohort study had some major strengths including 
comprehensive 
record 
linkage 
between 
multiple 
registers, absence of recall bias and other sources of 
information bias, capacity to account for all deaths and 
emigrations throughout follow-up, nationwide coverage 
of the registry datasets, and abundant statistical power 
and precision to examine fairly rare adverse events in a 
study cohort consisting of more than 1 million people. 
Thus, for example, our study was entirely free of the 
linkage errors and resulting selection biases that were 
reported by a previous study of this topic done using 
Hospital Episode Statistics in England.3 A specific 
strength of our register-based cohort study was that we 
could delineate childhood trauma-related hospital 
admissions to a clinically significant level of severity, 
because the exposure classification included only those 
individuals who were actually admitted to hospital. We 
were also unable to examine emergency department 
contacts following trauma without admission in this 
study. However, this should not be regarded as an 
omission, because such an approach would have 
identified a much larger set of relatively minor accidental 
injuries to children, most of whom would be unlikely to 
have increased risk of experiencing the longer-term 
adverse outcomes we examined beyond their 15th 
birthdays.
A widely recognised generic limitation of registry 
studies is residual confounding.24 Thus, adjustment for 
parental SES took account of only three parameters, and 
there are many other important determinants of risk, 
including child abuse and neglect, bullying by peers, and 
household dysfunction,25 that were not measured 
systematically in the administrative registers that we had 
access to. Studies of this particular topic share a common 
limitation that a sizeable proportion of violence and self-
harm are undetected at hospital admission and might 
frequently be misclassified as accidents.4 A limitation 
specific to our cohort study was that we could not 
examine trauma-related hospital admissions that were of 
undetermined cause, which was possible in studies done 
using routinely collected datasets in other countries 
such as New Zealand6,7 and the USA.4 This ‘‘reason for 
hospitalisation’’ category was unavailable to us because 
of anomalies in registration procedures and absence of 
consistency in ICD 8th and 10th revision coding usage in 
the hospital registers across the whole of the study’s 
observation period. Individuals admitted for injuries of 
undetermined cause have been reported to show 
substantially increased risk for subsequent suicidal 
behaviour.7 The exclusion of this group might have 
attenuated some of the relative risk estimates we 
observed, specifically in table 1 and in figures 2 and 3, 
albeit only to a marginal degree because this is likely to 
be an exposure subgroup with rare prevalence. Finally, in 
this study we did not examine the potential influences of 
psychopathology among cohort members and also their 
parents’ mental disorders. The latter could have

important roles in the cause of trauma-related hospital 
admission during childhood26 as well as self-harm and 
interpersonal violence during older adolescence and 
early adulthood.27 A comprehensive investigation of 
these potential causal mechanisms would require a 
complex study design and a sophisticated analytical 
approach, ideally with linkage to both primary and 
secondary care data sources to enable capture of all 
diagnosed mental illnesses among cohort members and 
their parents.

Trauma-related hospital admission during childhood 
could be a useful marker for myriad forms of familial 
dysfunction and distress that in later years promote 
emotional dysregulation and impulsive, self-destructive 
reactions to stress and adversity in adulthood.28 In 
developing multiagency strategies to tackle internalised 
and externalised violence among susceptible youths and 
young adults, the wellbeing of individuals who 
experienced hospital admission during childhood for 
self-harm or interpersonal violence merits especially 
close attention. High school and college-oriented 
programmes might be particularly beneficial in this 
regard.29 National clinical guidelines typically address 
single problems such as self-harm,30 but might need to 
be broadened to encompass other types of adverse events 
to encourage family-level psychosocial assessments 
following hospital admission of children due to serious 
episodes of interpersonal violence3 and accidental injury 
or poisoning caused by apparent parental neglect. 
Childhood hospital admissions following trauma might 
therefore represent crucially important opportunities for 
hospital-based family-oriented interventions aimed at 
reducing future risk of accidental, self-inflicted and 
assaultive injuries, and poisonings.
To conclude, young people who harm themselves or 
who are aggressive or violent towards others have often 
experienced trauma during their childhoods, and 
therefore they should be treated sympathetically rather 
than as problematic and undeserving. Among those 
individuals who experienced trauma-related hospital 
admission during their childhood, risks of adverse 
outcome 
are 
increased, 
irrespective 
of 
parental 
socioeconomic status. Therefore, a more psychosocial 
approach to meet the needs of these vulnerable young 
people and their families is indicated for successful 
prevention of future episodes of harmful behaviour. The 
novelty of this study lies in its examination of two 
associated 
destructive 
behaviours 
for 
an 
under 
-
researched exposure-outcome association that spans two 
adjacent periods in the life-course that are crucially 
important in an individual’s development through to 
healthy adult maturity. Reporting of sex-specific absolute 
and relative risks also breaks new ground for this 
research topic—an approach that maximises the 
relevance and use of the findings for clinicians, public 
health professionals, and policy makers
