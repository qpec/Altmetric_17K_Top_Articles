Affinity maturation selects B cells expressing somatically mutated antibody variants
with improved antigen-binding properties to protect from invading pathogens. We determined
the molecular mechanism underlying the clonal selection and affinity maturation of human
B cells expressing protective antibodies against the circumsporozoite protein of the malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum (PfCSP). We show in molecular detail that the repetitive
nature of PfCSP facilitates direct homotypic interactions between two PfCSP repeat-bound
monoclonal antibodies, thereby improving antigen affinity and B cell activation. These data
provide a mechanistic explanation for the strong selection of somatic mutations that
mediate homotypic antibody interactions after repeated parasite exposure in humans. Our
findings demonstrate a different mode of antigen-mediated affinity maturation to improve
antibody responses to PfCSP and presumably other repetitive antigens.
S
porozoites of the human malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) express a sur-
face protein, circumsporozoite protein
(PfCSP), with an immunodominant central
NANP (Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro) repeat region (1–3).
Antibodies against the repeat can mediate pro-
tection from Plasmodium infection in animal
models (4–6). However, anti-NANP antibody–
mediated protection is not readily achieved
through vaccination. Thus, the induction of pro-
tective PfCSP NANP antibodies is a major goal in
pre-erythrocytic vaccine development (7). We re-
cently showed that the anti-NANP PfCSP memory
B cell response in Pf-naïve volunteers after immu-
nization with live Pf sporozoites under chloroquine
prophylaxis (PfSPZ-CVac) matured predominantly
through the clonal selection and expansion of
potent Pf inhibitory IGHV3-33– and IGKV1-5–
encoded germline antibodies with an 8–amino
acid–long immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain k
complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3)
(this 8–amino acid CDR3 is hereafter designated
KCDR3:8) (8, 9).
We analyzed five representative germline or
low-mutated antibodies with reported affinities
for a NANP 5-mer peptide (NANP5) between 10−6
and 10−9 M (Fig. 1A and table S1) (9). Antigen
binding was abrogated when the original Ig Vk1-5
light chain was replaced by Vk2-28 or when the
native Ig heavy chains were paired with a Vk1-5
light chain with 9–amino acid–long KCDR3 (Fig.
1B), demonstrating the importance of these
specific Ig features in antigen recognition.
All VH3-33–Vk1-5–KCDR3:8 antibodies were
encoded by the IGHV3-33*01 allele (9). IGHV3-
33*01 differs from three otherwise highly sim-
ilar gene segments (IGHV3-30, IGHV3-30-3, and
IGHV3-30-5) at position 52 of heavy-chain CDR2
(HCDR2), which encodes strictly a tryptophan
residue and not serine or arginine (Table 1 and
tableS2). HCDR2W52→S(H.W52_S)andH.W52_R
mutants of the selected antibodies, as well as an
H.W52_A mutant of antibody 2140 and a double
mutant (H.V50_F_W52_R) to mimic the IGHV3-
30*02 and IGHV3-30-5*02 alleles, all showed
reduced PfCSP repeat reactivity associated with
reduced in vitro parasite inhibitory activity (Fig. 1,
C and D; single-letter amino acid abbreviations
are defined in the legend to Fig. 1).
The majority of NANP-reactive VH3-33–Vk1-5–
KCDR3:8 B cells belonged to clonally expanded
and somatic hypermutation (SHM)–diversified
cell clusters with strong selection for replace-
ment mutations in HCDR1 (H.S31) and HCDR2
(H.V50 and H.N56), as well as KCDR3 [KCDR3
S93 (K.S93)], likely as a result of affinity matu-
ration (Fig. 1, E and F) (9). The introduction of
missing somatic mutations (mut) or reversions
(rev) at H.V50 and, to a lesser extent, H.S31
revealed a role in binding to a minimal NANP3
peptide (10, 11), as demonstrated for the germ-
line antibody 2163 and the low-mutated anti-
body 1210 (Fig. 1, G and H, and table S3). In
contrast, exchanges at H.N56 and K.S93, either
alone (in antibodies 1210_H.K56_Nrev, 1210_K.
N93_Srev, and 2163_H.N56_Kmut) or in combi-
nation (in 1210_NS and 2163_KN), showed no
significant effect (Fig. 1, G and H, and table S3).
Thus, affinity maturation to the repeat explained
the strong selection for only two of the four
characteristic replacement mutations in VH3-33–
Vk1-5–KCDR3:8 anti-NANP antibodies.
We next determined the cocrystal structure
of the 1210 antigen-binding fragment (Fab) with
NANP5 (Fig. 2, fig. S1A, and tables S4 to S6). The
NANP core epitope contained a type I b turn and
an elongated conformation (Fig. 2, A and C, and
fig. S1B), similar to NANP bound to a chimeric
2140 Ig heavy chain–1210 Ig k antibody and in
line with previous observations (fig. S1C and
tables S4 and S7) (10–14). Main-chain atoms in
KCDR3 were optimally positioned to mediate
H bonds with the repeat, likely contributing to
the strong selection of KCDR3:8 (Fig. 2, B and C,
and tables S2, S5, and S10). VH3-33 germline res-
idues, notably H.V50 and H.W52 (the residue
encoded only by IGHV3-33 alleles), as well as
H.Y52A and H.Y58 in HCDR2, mediated the
majority of antigen contacts (table S5 and fig. S2)
(15). Affinity maturation at H.V50 and H.S31 may
be explained by strengthened van der Waals in-
teractions with the repeat (Fig. 2C).
Notably, our crystal structure also revealed
that two 1210 Fabs (designated 1210 Fab-A and
Fab-B) bound to one NANP5 peptide in a head-
to-head configuration at a 133° angle (Fig. 2D
and fig. S3). This binding mode led to six homo-
typic antibody-antibody H bonds providing 263
Å2 of buried surface area (BSA) between the two
Fabs and an additional ~120 Å2 of BSA between
the Fabs and the repeat (Fig. 2, E and F, and
tables S5, S6, and S10). Two highly selected mu-
tations, H.N56_K and K.S93_N (Fig. 1, E and F),
formed H bonds with H.Y52A and H.S99 in the
opposing Fab, thereby stabilizing the head-to-
head configuration (Fig. 2, G and H). KCDR3:8
optimally contacted HCDR3 of the opposite 1210
molecule, providing another explanation for the
length restriction in KCDR3.
To investigate homotypic interactions, we next
measured the Fab affinities for NANP5 and
NANP3 for 1210, 1210_NS (which lacks the selec-
ted mutations involved in homotypic binding), a
1210 H.D100_Ymut K.N92_Ymut mutant (1210_YY,
designed to disrupt head-to-head binding through
steric clashes), and a 1210 germline antibody
(1210_GL) (Fig. 2I and fig. S4). Compared with
1210, 1210_YY and 1210_NS showed significantly
weakened affinity for NANP5 but not for NANP3,
whereas 1210_GL was significantly worse than
1210 at binding both peptides (Fig. 2I and fig. S4)
(16). These data suggest that only 1210 efficiently
recognized the repeat in a high-affinity homo-
typic head-to-head binding configuration. An
analysis of full-length PfCSP with 38 NANP re-
peats confirmed this hypothesis. Approximately
twelve 1210 Fabs bound PfCSP and recognized the
NANP repeat in a head-to-head binding config-
uration similar to the 1210 Fab–NANP5 crystal
structure (Fig. 2, J and K, and fig. S3D) (11, 17).

 Furthermore, 1210_YY IgG, with its restricted
ability to engage in homotypic antibody inter-
actions, showed a lower binding avidity to full-
length PfCSP than 1210 (fig. S5). Thus, affinity
maturation selects for mutations that improve
homotypic antibody interactions, thereby indirectly
increasing PfCSP NANP binding.
To better understand the selection of SHM
at the cellular level, we measured the degree of
B cell activation in response to NANP5 of trans-
genic B cell lines expressing 1210 or variant B cell
receptors (BCRs) (Fig. 3, A to D). BCR signaling
was delayed in cells expressing 1210_GL compared
with that in cells expressing 1210. This effect was
even more pronounced in 1210_YY mutant
cells. As expected, 1210_H.V50_Imut (1210 with
HCDR2 V50→I), with high repeat affinity, mediated
stronger signals than 1210, especially with low anti-
gen concentrations, whereas 1210_NS showed no
significant differences (Fig. 3D). Thus, B cell ac-
tivation is promoted by both direct NANP bind-
ing and homotypic antibody interactions. Despite
a 2-log difference in NANP3 affinities (Fig. 1, G
and H) and the varied potential of these antibodies
to engage in homotypic interactions, all showed
similar capacities to inhibit Pf sporozoites in vitro
(Fig. 3E and fig. S6). Likewise, all antibodies con-
ferred similar levels of dose-dependent protec-
tion from the development of blood-stage parasites
after passive immunization in mice, presumably
because of strong avidity effects (Fig. 3F). These
data provide a mechanistic explanation for the
strong in vivo selection of antihomotypic anti-
body mutants by affinity maturation, inde-
pendently of their protective efficacy as soluble
antibodies.
VH3 antibodies dominate the anti-PfCSP mem-
ory response (9, 11, 14). In addition to VH3-33–
Vk1-5–KCDR3:8, we observed a cluster of highly
mutated, affinity-matured VH3-23–Vk1-5 NANP-
reactive memory B cell antibodies in our selection
(Fig. 4, A and B) (9). Although the NANP5-binding
mode of a representative VH3-23–Vk1-5 anti-
body, 1450, was different from that of 1210, it
also recognized NANP5 in a head-to-head con-
figuration, with HCDR3s in direct juxtaposition

analysis of the VH3-23–Vk1-5 antibody cluster
confirmed enrichment for amino acid exchanges
that participate directly in antibody-antigen inter-
actions or antibody-antibody contacts or favor a
1450 paratope conformation optimal for NANP
epitope recognition (Fig. 4B).
After the immunization of malaria-naïve indi-
viduals with PfSPZ-CVac, ~15% of PfCSP-reactive
memory B cells showed VH3-33–Vk1-5–KCDR3:8
or VH3-23–Vk1-5 sequence characteristics (Fig. 4F).
Furthermore, these cells were strongly enriched
in the expanded anti-PfCSP memory B cell pool
compared with the nonexpanded population
(Fig. 4G). Thus, antihomotypic affinity matura-
tion is observed after repeated Pf sporozoite im-
munization (8, 9) in both low-mutated high-affinity
VH3-33 antibodies and lower-affinity antibodies
utilizing other gene combinations. This phenom-
enon also likely takes place in B cell responses
elicited by RTS,S malaria vaccination (fig. S8) (11).
Thus, antihomotypic affinity maturation, in
addition to traditional antibody-antigen affinity
maturation, promotes the strong clonal expan-
sion and competitive selection of PfCSP-reactive
B cells in humans. Even in the absence of affinity
maturation, VH3-33–Vk1-5–KCDR3:8 antibodies
are moderate to strong NANP binders and po-
tent Pf inhibitors. This critically depends on
H.W52 in HCDR2. Because IGHV3-33 is located
in a region of structural polymorphism of the
IGH locus, haplotype frequencies, especially in
areas where Pf is endemic, may determine the
efficient induction of protective humoral anti-
PfCSP repeat responses upon vaccination (19).
Indeed, one donor in our study was IGHV3-33
negative (fig. S9). We propose that antihomo-
typic affinity maturation may be a generalizable
property of B cell responses if a repetitive antigen
(malarial or other) brings two antibodies into
close proximity to optimize binding and promote
clustering of surface Ig molecules through homo-
typic interactions (20, 21).
