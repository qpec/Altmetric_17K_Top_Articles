Many people use cars all over the world. This is, however, not done without risk, as traffic
accidents are one of the most common causes of death for adolescents worldwide.
The number of deaths has steadily decreased, both worldwide and in Norway. Many
of these accidents involve passenger cars and distracted driving. While there are many
campaigns to improve safety in traffic, little research has looked at distractions. A recent
report has investigated the occurrence of and damage caused by distraction, and one
article has looked at what predicts baseline differences in levels of distracted driving.
However, no one has tested an intervention to decrease distracted behavior in traffic.
Motivational variables suggested by the Theory of Planned Behavior, personality traits,
and demographic variables show utility in similar contexts and are all tested in this
project. Data from two samples were collected to investigate the nature of distractions in
traffic, what factors predict baseline levels of distractions, and to test an intervention to
reduce distractions. Both samples feature randomly assigned intervention and control
groups. The first sample (n = 1100 total; n = 208 was licensed to drive) consisted of
high school students from all over Norway as a part of a larger attitudinal campaign,
while the second sample (n = 414) was more general. The second tested a digital
version of implementation intentions designed as volitional help sheets. The results from
both samples suggest that there are some robust differences between people in how
much they are distracted in everyday life, while some variables need further research.
The second study failed to uncover any effects of the intervention. Reasons for this
are discussed, along with points on the efficacy of digital interventions, the design of
the volitional help sheets, and the design of the study in general. Notwithstanding the
ineffectual interventions, this study contains novel information about baseline differences
in distractive behavior that may further impact future behavior change interventions and
guide future research.

Examining Driver Distraction
INTRODUCTION
Many people across the world drive cars daily. An estimate
suggests that upward of 50 million people are hurt each
year in road crashes, and more than one million people die
(WHO, 2016). WHO suggests that people not using seatbelts or
motorcycle helmets, non-adherence to speed limits and distracted
driving are two main causing factors of these accidents. 2015 had
the lowest number of lethal traffic accidents in Norway for more
than 60 years. New technological innovations have improved
safety in traffic and may continue to do so (Vaa et al., 2014).
Further innovations in social science may also lead to a decrease
in accidents, as interventions increase in efficacy. This article
assesses the utility of an implementation intention intervention
in decreasing distracted driving, and tries to examine what factors
impact this utility (Gollwitzer, 1999). It also investigates drivers’
distractions generally and tests variables in predicting baseline
differences in distracted behavior among two different samples.
A recent report concluded that distracted driving plays
a part of at least 12% of car accidents in many different
contexts and countries, with most estimates suggesting larger
numbers (Sagberg and Sundfør, 2016). Many distracting factors
have suggested, such as events occurring outside the vehicle,
adjusting radio/cassette/CD controls, and interactions with other
occupants inside the vehicle (Stutts et al., 2001). They also
emphasize the rapid growth of technology, with mobile phones
as a prominent example of factors that can lead to greater
inattention among drivers.
Distracting factors are closely related to attention. As the task
of driving a vehicle is mostly taxing on the systems of visual
attention, any factor that draws the gaze away from the road
for a significant period of time could be classified as a distractor
(Sagberg et al., 2016). Specifically, after 2 s of distraction, the risk
of getting involved in an accident increases drastically (Sagberg
and Sundfør, 2016). Attention has been conceptualized as an
array of systems that select to focus on some sensory stimuli
while discarding others (Reisberg, 2013). The systems of attention
can be categorized into top-down and bottom-up systems which
work in different ways while driving (Petersen and Posner, 2012).
The former is attention guided by volition, a proactive and
cognitively adjusted way of controlling what to focus on, such
as making a phone call whilst driving. The bottom-up approach
is a reactive, stimulus-driven approach, and is relevant when
stimuli draw our attention without our conscious control such
as receiving a phone call. A better understanding of how to
effectively deal with stimuli that fight over this limited resource
could potentially reduce the number of accidents on roads.
However, predicting and explaining human behavior is difficult,
especially if people act in discordance with their own intentions.
In the 1980’
s, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was
introduced as an improved framework for explaining human
behavior (Vaughan and Hogg, 2005). Building on the Theory
of Reasoned Action (TRA), it included a measure of perceived
behavioral control (PBC), in addition to attitudes toward a
behavior and perceived social norms. These variables are thought
to predict intentions to perform a range of behaviors (Ajzen,
1985). Intention would then be highly associated with performing
the behavior in question, mediating all the variance between the
motivators and behavior. One exception has been made with
PBC, as that sometimes can lead directly to performing the
behavior in question. While this approach has proven itself as
a good way of explaining human variance in both intentions
and behavior, intentions may predict too little of the behavioral
variance in some domains (Ogden, 2012), and several meta-
analytic reviews have found the efficacy of the model to vary
between behaviors and studies (Ajzen, 1991; Godin and Kok,
1996; McEachan et al., 2011). Estimates place the explained
variance in intentions as generally between 40 and 50%, and
the explained variance in behavior between 19 and 38% (Ogden,
2012). No research has investigated the theory’
s efficacy in
relation to drivers’
distractions in traffic. Those with intentions
to reach a goal, but who fail to do so, have been labeled
inclined abstainers. These people have been found primarily to
be responsible for the intention–
behavior gap found in the TPB
(Gollwitzer and Sheeran, 2006). Research into the intention–
behavior discrepancies found different problems leading to an
intention–
behavior gap (Prestwich et al., 2015). These concerned
opportunities to express intentions into behavior, changing
saliency of cues, and lack of elaboration of cues to action. These
three problems have been addressed with recent interventions.
In the late 1990’
s, Gollwitzer’
s paper titled “
Strong effects
of simple plans” lay the foundation for what has become
a recognized psychological intervention (Gollwitzer, 1999).
Implementation intentions are designed specifically to address
the apparent gap between intention and behavior, and to close it
as far as possible (Gollwitzer, 1999). It does this by making people
form plans following an “
if-then”
-structure to reach the goals
they set themselves. Personal goals, persistence with boring tasks,
increased performance in dichotic listening tasks and returning
postcards have all benefited from the kind of planning involved in
implementation intentions (Gollwitzer and Sheeran, 2006). Effect
sizes for intervention studies using an implementation intention
design have been approximately medium (Prestwich et al., 2015).
For emotional control, a high effect size of d = 0.91 was observed
(Webb et al., 2012), and a low one was noted for physical
activity d = 0.30 (Carraro and Gaudreau, 2013). While mostly
used for health behaviors, it has also proven effective in general
applications (Gollwitzer and Sheeran, 2006; Prestwich et al.,
2015). Especially important to the plan’
s efficacy, is participants’
baseline intentions to perform a behavior.
Participants in studies using implementation intentions are
usually told to make plans for a specific aspect of their
lives they want to change (Sheeran, 2002). Planning using
an implementation intention design, involves semantically
combining the when, where, and how of achieving that goal.
For example, a person may combine the “
if”
-statement: “
if I
am tempted to drive faster than the speed limit while on the
highway. . .” with the “
then”
-statement: “
then I will remind
myself that it is dangerous and illegal to do so.” These if-
then planning interventions usually are accompanied by careful
instructions, as the quality of the plan has a large impact on the
efficacy of the intervention (de Vet et al., 2011a).
Research suggests that more than 30% do not make plans
when asked to, and that roughly 30% of those who do plan, fail

Examining Driver Distraction
to make good plans (Michie and Abraham, 2004; de Vet et al.,
2011b). Their plans are often too general and lack specification
of behavioral cues and appropriate actions (de Vet et al., 2011a).
A high-quality plan for physical exercise would work to defeat
habit, not only by specifying that the workout should be done
in the evening, but also which evening and at what time. The
habitual nature of many car driving tasks, such driving too fast
or adjusting the radio, is just what the implementation intentions
aim to alter (Gollwitzer, 1999). The process of making the plans is
thought to fortify and complete the planning effects, and properly
elaborating on the possible situations and cues is crucial for
planning with good effect (Prestwich et al., 2015).
To mitigate poor planning, some research groups have
tried to standardize the induction of implementation intentions
through volitional help sheets (Arden and Armitage, 2012;
Armitage, 2015; Brewster et al., 2015). While most people can
form self-regulatory strategies themselves, standardizing them
leads to greater experimental control, and eases the process of
intervention (Brewster et al., 2015). It has also been argued that
people often fail to make high-quality plans, or fail to follow
the format at all (Michie and Abraham, 2004; de Vet et al.,
2011a). Volitional help sheets list pre-made critical situations and
behavioral solutions, and tell participants to link situations and
strategies. This method has proven successful in some studies,
with no decrease in the efficacy of the intervention. The list of
critical situations in which they are likely to not act according
to their goals constitutes the “
if”
-part. These situations are often
empirically derived, but can also be synthesized from theoretical
frameworks. After choosing critical situations, they are asked
to link these, typically by drawing a line, with appropriate
coping strategies or “
then”
-statements. As stated in the original
paper, successful goal striving often relies on finding purposeful,
instrumental behaviors that bring people closer to their goals
(Gollwitzer, 1999). It is not clear that strategies based on some
theories are superior in achieving behavior change than other
theories or basing them on empirical data of what people already
do to achieve their goals.
There is little doubt that there are systematic differences
between groups of people in how they behave in traffic and how
they respond to planning interventions. For example, there exists
considerable gender and age differences in who ends up in traffic
accidents, with young males being most accident prone (Statistisk
Sentralbyrå
, 2016; Vegdirektoratet, 2017). Young male drivers
are more neurologically predisposed to sensation-seeking and
risky behaviors (Arnett, 1996; Byrnes et al., 1999). In addition,
young drivers will often lack experience and get in more accidents
due to risky behavior (Turner and McClure, 2003; Rundmo and
Iversen, 2004). In opposition, older drivers are found to be more
inattentive drivers (Aberg and Rimmo, 1998), and some have
even found that females are more prone to being distracted
(Bone and Mowen, 2006). These contradictions further the
importance of more knowledge about demographic information
and distractions. For example, how often one drives is suggested
as an important predictor of distractions as those who drive more
can habituate to the task and grow bored of it, thus seeking
other stimulants (Bone and Mowen, 2006). Similar situations
elicit different responses from people, and this is a classic area of
application for taxonomies of personality psychology (Holt et al.,
2012).
The Big Five is one of the most prominent and praised
personality taxonomies (McCrae and Allik, 2002). The model
describes the tendencies people have to act and think in certain
ways using only five bi-dimensional traits on which people score
high or low; namely extraversion (E), neuroticism (N), openness
to experience (O), conscientiousness (C), and agreeableness (A).
It has been found to predict traffic behavior generally, and explain
dangerous behavior specifically (Salgado, 2002; Sümer et al.,
2005). Short-form measures of the Big Five variables have been
developed to make it more accessible and easy to use in diverse
domains (Donnellan et al., 2006). Some researchers have found
that personality factors impact safe driving, but not distracted
driving in particular (Jiang et al., 2011). Conscientiousness has
specifically been shown to predict risky driving, along with
some personality facets associated with extraversion (Schwebel
et al., 2006). In fact, some have found conscientiousness to be a
prominent predictor of total accidents (Arthur and Doverspike,
2001). One study showed how all the different aspects of the
Big Five explain accident risk through aberrant driving behavior,
suggesting that personality may be mediated by other variables
(Sümer et al., 2005). The other Big Five-variables also seem to
explain some of the interpersonal variance in accident proneness,
which is suggestive of a complex interplay and an intricate causal
model.
When looking at distractions, and especially a planning
intervention to reduce it, conscientiousness, extraversion, and
neuroticism may play more of a role than the others.
Conscientiousness has generally been the more effective as it has
shown predictions of distracted driving, and may interact with
a planning intervention (Arthur and Doverspike, 2001; Sümer
et al., 2005; Bone and Mowen, 2006; Webb et al., 2007; Ajzen
et al., 2009). Other research also indirectly support both a main
and interactional effect of conscientiousness in health-related
behavior (Bogg and Roberts, 2004). Extraversion closely relates
to sensation-seeking or boredom while driving, which could be
specially relevant for younger drivers (Arnett, 1996; Rundmo
and Iversen, 2004). Neuroticism could be included because it
relates to reactive behaviors that could be of importance in
drivers’distractions (Jovanovi´
c et al., 2011; Thørrisen, 2013).
Furthermore, an increase in neuroticism may increase baseline
levels of anxiousness or tenseness, which are hypothesized to
worsen the impact of negative events on driving performance
(ibid.).

Examining Driver Distraction
distracted driving will yield less distracted behavior. PBC
for general driving will also be a positive predictor.
The third hypothesis (H3) is that traits of personality
will predict levels of distractive behavior at baseline.
Specifically, we expect neuroticism and extraversion to
positively predict, and conscientiousness to negatively
predict drivers’
distractions.
The fourth hypothesis (H4) is that forming implementation
intentions using an online version of volitional help sheets
will reduce drivers’
distractions.
The fifth hypothesis (H5) is that the effect of forming
implementation intentions will be stronger for the inclined
abstainers in the sample.
The sixth hypothesis (H6) is that conscientiousness will
moderate the effect of the planning intervention on top of
intentions.
In addition, the data will be explored using correlation and
descriptive statistics, especially regarding the nature of distractive
behavior. Age and gender will also be explored for effects on
baseline levels of distractions as the directionality of the effect is
unclear. Further exploration will be done regarding the volitional
help sheet, whether theoretically derived solutions from the stages
of change-model, or empirical solutions derived from recent
reports and a pilot study seem more efficacious.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling
Two separate samples were collected to test the hypotheses. The
first consisted of high school students (n = 1100) and focused
on baseline measures and describing distractions among youth
in Norway. The second sample consisted of a random sample
of Norwegians (n = 617), and tested both baseline predictions
and the intervention, using two experimental groups and an
active control group. Both data collections were approved by
Norwegian Centre for Research Data (NSD).
Participants in the first sample were recruited through
the traffic safety organization Trygg Trafikk and their county
departments. All participating schools were chosen randomly
and represented seven different counties in Norway, while the
second sample was a representative, randomized Norwegian
sample who had been recruited during a previous study by
the Institute of Transport Economics (TØI). In both instances,
a small gift certificate was promised to a couple of lucky
participants. For the first sample, contact with schools recruited
by Trygg Trafikk was upheld by their county departments.
Instruction on how to best complete the survey followed the
link in an email. The pre-survey was administered in the first
2 weeks of October 2016. The second sample was contacted
directly using emails in March 2017. The second survey was
designed as a replication of and improvement over the first; scales’
wording were reviewed to improve psychometric properties, and
demographic variables lacking efficacy in regression models were
removed or redesigned (see below). The TPB and Big Five scales
were increased from five- to seven-point to increase response
variance (Bordens and Abbott, 2011, pp. 265–
266). All scales
showed acceptable internal consistency for longer scales, and
strong correlations between items for shorter ones (DeVellis,
2003).
Demographics
The questionnaire was designed to measure drivers’
distractions
and general individual difference information. Both samples’
surveys featured demographic information, such as how large
their home town was, age, gender, and information about
transportation habits and completed traffic education. For the
first sample, information specific to high school was included,
and was substituted for information about education levels in the
second.
The Big Five
For both samples, short-versions of the three selected traits were
used. These consists of four-item scales which were chosen for
their utility and effectivity (Donnellan et al., 2006). The items
were translated and wordings was checked against previous
translations of Big Five measures for extraversion, neuroticism,
and conscientiousness (Engvik and Føllesdal, 2005).
Theory of Planned Behavior
The motivational pre-cursors subjective norms, attitudes, PBC,
and intentions were also measured using composite scales
in regard to driver distractions in both samples. Previous
Norwegian research was influential in designing the questions
(Moan, 2005). We used two items to measure normative beliefs,
five bi-dimensional axes to measure attitudes, and seven items
for PBC for distracted driving and two for general driving. Due
to technical error, intention was only measured for the second
sample using three items. Intention was also designed to control
for inclined abstainers, by asking people the degree to which they
wanted to be safer drivers.
Distracted Behavior
Last, the survey included 11 items measuring drivers’
distractions
during the last 2 weeks. These 11 items were informed by recent
reports and a pilot study (Sagberg and Sundfør, 2016). They were
grouped into two groups of distractions: mobile phone use and
secondary tasks. These were thought to be often occurring among
the target population and suitable for intervention. Participants
rated how often these distracting behaviors occurred on a six-
point scale from 1 “
Never”to 6 “
Very often.”The two categories
were also combined into a general distraction index. The second
sample also got asked about their perception of the relevance
of the plans they had made. Also included here was a measure
of how often they performed behaviors, without mention of
distractions. The thought was to investigate whether people did
the behaviors without getting distracted. An open comment
section was also implemented.

measures, and featured a digital volitional help sheet (see
Supplementary Figures 1–
4). The critical situations in this sheet
closely resembled baseline measures of distracted behavior. As
an area of exploration, half of the solutions for mobile phone
distractors were empirically derived from previous research,
while the other half was theoretically derived, and focused on
the stages of change model (Prochaska et al., 1988; Brewster
et al., 2015). A digital design for delivering the volitional help
sheet version of the implementation intention intervention was
developed to make the plan formation as engaging, yet easy, as
possible (see Supplementary Material). First, each participant
was presented with a list of pre-defined distracting situations
at the end of the survey. They were told to choose relevant
ones, and thus complement them with pre-defined behavioral
solutions. Every participant made two plans for mobile phone
use, two for secondary distractions, and one for when they
get in their cars. To maximize intervention efficacy, reminders
of participants’plans were sent out 1 week after induction
(Prestwich et al., 2009). The control group was presented with
standardized information about distractions in traffic and
asked to rank a list of distractors by their disruptiveness to
traffic safety. Respondents were grouped by the date of their
completion of the baseline survey, so that the follow-up survey
would arrive close to 2 weeks after their completion of the
first.
RESULTS
Data analysis for testing hypotheses in both samples consists of
three general procedures: correlation, regression, and ANOVA.
For hypotheses one, two, and three, correlations provided
the first step toward information about the interplay between
the variables in this article. For a more conclusive test of
these three hypotheses a multiple regression was used. In the
second sample, ANOVAs were used to test randomization and
drop-out. To test hypotheses four, five, and six, a repeated
measures ANCOVA was used. Here, different analyses of
variance were utilized to explore the data and uncover other
trends.
Descriptive Results from the Student
Sample
There were 1,100 respondents in the first sample with a mean
age of 17.2 (SD = 1.63). The range in overall reported age was
from 15 to 30, and there was a slight gender skew overall (42.6%
men, 57.4% women). There was an equal split between those who
lived in towns with more than 10.000 inhabitants (40.1%) and
those who lived in towns with less (43.3%), suggesting an even
rural/urban representation in the sample. Some reported driving
cars as their most common means of transportation (14.9%),
while most people reported mostly being passengers (40.8%).
Two hundred and eight students (18.9%) reported having the
drivers’
license. Most of the respondents reported having their
license for less than 6 months (53.6%) at T0, while 10% reported
more than 25 months. Most drivers (53.9%) reported driving
more than 10 times the last 2 weeks and most students drove cars
more than 40 km the last 2 weeks (62.4%).
In Table 1, main variables and their descriptive statistics are
shown. It is worth noting the differences in number of included
students, as only 18.9% of the total sample were licensed to
drive. In order to favor statistical power, and to better describe
a younger population as a whole, all respondents are included
where applicable.
All three personality constructs show mean scores revolving
around the semantic mean of three, with conscientiousness
slightly higher. When looking only at those who already had a
driver’
s license, the mean age went up to 19.0 (SD = 2.06), and
the gender skew shifts toward more males (58.2%). A somewhat
low mean for attitudes suggests that there generally is a negative
perception of driving while distracted and a high mean for norms
suggest that respondents think their peers dislike when they let
themselves get distracted. It is also apparent that our sample finds
it neither hard nor easy to avoid being distracted while driving,
with a PBC mean closer to the middle of the scale. They also find
it quite easy to drive, with a mean close to the high-end of the
scale.
Overall, the students reported low levels of driver distraction.
Although, as shown in Table 2, some distractions occur more
often than others. Their distribution seem consistent and

Testing Baseline Differences in the
Student Sample (H1, H2, H3)
A correlation matrix was used as a first step toward testing
hypotheses one, two, and three. The correlation matrix in
Table 3 suggests that gender, how often driven, neuroticism,
and TPB-measures show significant relations with distractive

A regression provided a further test of hypotheses one,
two, and three for the first sample (see Table 4). Driving
more often, having more positive views about driving while
distracted, perceiving attitudes of significant others as more
lenient, and perceiving driving without getting distracted
as less under their control are all factors that contribute
significantly to increasing distracted behavior. This partially
confirms these hypotheses. While correlation did not suggest
it, extraversion positively predicts self-reported distractions,
as did neuroticism. Overall the explained variance in the
models is high, with roughly equal amount for all three
categories
of
distraction.

Drop-Out and Exclusion in the General
Sample
Only respondents who were licensed to drive and who had
driven the past 2 weeks were included in the analysis of
intervention effects. Participants who had not driven the last
2 weeks at T1 were also excluded. In order to better control
participant flow, only those answering within the first 2 weeks
of survey distribution were included. Four hundred and fourteen
participants in total were subjected to analysis after completing
both data collections and meeting inclusion criteria. Six hundred
and seventeen respondents were subjected to baseline analyses.
Descriptive Results from the General
Sample
Of the 1,763 emails sent, 701 (39.7%) responded at T0,
with 617 remaining after exclusion. At T1, 414 of these
participants were uniquely identified and carried forward for
analysis of intervention effects. There was an even split between
male (51.7%) and female (48.3%) respondents in this final
sample. Only 4.8% of this sample reported having completed
middle school as their highest level of education, with 31.6%
having completed high school. Further, 29.2% reported having
completed three or more years of higher education, with
approximately a third (34.3%) having completed four or more
years of higher education. Key statistics for variables at T0 and
T1 are presented in Table 5.
It is worth noting that some numbers in Table 5 are not
directly comparable with scores from the first sample, as scales
measuring personality and TPB were shifted from five-point to
seven-point scales. Personality constructs suggest that this sample
is higher on conscientiousness, and about middle on extroversion
and neuroticism. With those who had not driven the past 2 weeks
discarded, a majority of the remaining participants (56.0%) had
driven more than once every day on average. Only 11.5% had
driven less than 20 km during these 2 weeks, which suggests that
most of those included had driven substantial distances.
The mean for attitude, PBC for distractions and PBC for
driving, all score somewhat above the semantic mean. This
suggests that respondents have somewhat unfavorable views
about being distracted while driving, and think that they are in
control both in terms of driving, and avoiding distractions while
driving. Social norms, also above the semantic middle-point,
suggests that respondents think their significant others generally
would not like if respondents became distracted while driving.
A high intention to be less distracted is encouraging, as this
suggests that most respondents, while reporting being somewhat
distracted, also want to be as safe drivers as possible. The three
items measuring intentions to be as safe drivers as possible were
compiled into a mean score. As shown in Table 5, there was a very
high intention score in this sample. This suggests that the sample
has a focus on being safe in traffic.
As in the previous sample, most self-reported distractive
behavior shows relatively low frequency as displayed in Table 6.
Most single behaviors vary around a score of two across
participants, which equals “
Very rarely.”The total average also
suggests this, and the standard deviation shows that most
respondents answer quite close to this low frequency. Consistent

most frequent distractor at both T0 and T1, scoring more than
one point above the lowest, “
Writing a message on the phone”
at T0.
Testing Baseline Differences in the
General Sample (H1, H2, H3)
A correlation matrix from the T0 data is presented in Table 7,
and provides a first step in exploring relationships between
variables, and testing hypotheses one, two, and three. Here, we
see that several variables are suggested to covariate with distracted
behavior. Older, female participants are less distracted. How often
and how far one drives are both linked to increased distractive
behavior, while PBC for distractive behavior shares a negative
relationship. More neurotic and less conscientious respondents
report more distractions, and higher intentions to be a safe driver
go along with fewer distractions. Furthermore, the matrix unveils
several relationships between individual difference variables.
Multiple gender differences were found, for example in how often
participants drive, their attitudes, their neurotic tendencies and
their intentions to be safe drivers. Multiple correlations also exist
between TPB-variables and personality items informed by the
Big Five.
A multiple regression analyses was run to explore the data,
and test hypotheses one, two, and three in the general second
sample. These results are presented in Table 8. Education and
intention to change are new variables since the first sample.
Those who drive more often, but not farther, are as in the
previous sample, prone to being more distracted, partially
confirming hypothesis one. As the first sample’
s analyses were run
without the scale for intentions, we also ran a regression model
without intentions for the second sample, because intentions
should mediate the effects of attitudes, norms and PBC. The
results showed that the regression weights of some variables, in
particular of attitudes and PBC, increased in the model without
intentions. However, none of the variables’significance levels
were affected by whether intentions were included or excluded.

A higher score on attitudes in this second sample means a more
negative view of distracted driving (unlike in the first sample,
where it meant a more lenient view), attitudes negatively and
significantly predict general and mobile distractions. Having a
higher PBC for not being distracted significantly predicts fewer
distractions for all categories as in the first sample. Having
intentions to be safe drivers predicts fewer distractions for
general and mobile categories, but not for secondary tasks.
Different to the first sample, attitudes are not significant for
secondary tasks, and social norms fail to predict level of any
distracted behavior. None of the personality variables turn out
significant. This confirms hypothesis one, but only partially
confirms hypothesis two, and rejects hypothesis three. Age and
gender show significant impacts on behavior, suggesting that
young, male drivers are more distracted than their senior and
female counterparts.

Johansson and Fyhri
Examining Driver Distraction
To test and explore the mediating effect of intentions between
attitudes, norms, PBC, and distractive behavior, we ran a separate
model predicting intentions. Here, attitudes (β = 0.15, p = 0.006),
norms (β = 0.16, p = 0.002), and PBC (β = 0.18, p < 0.001)
all predicted intentions while controlling for the other variables
from Table 8. According to the four steps of mediation, the data
suggest that the effect of attitudes and PBC on behavior is partially
mediated by intentions (Baron and Kenny, 1986).
Planning Efficacy
Tests of Attrition and Randomization
An ANOVA was conducted to test for significant differences
in baseline measures between those who completed both data
collections and those who dropped out (n = 198). The dependent
variables were the baseline measures of mobile phone and
secondary tasks distractions, as well as intention and motivational
pre-cursors. The independent variables were whether or not they
dropped out. No multivariate or between-subject main effects
emerged, suggesting no difference between those who dropped
out and those who did not. A similar ANOVA was run to
test for difference between conditions, but no such effect was
uncovered. This suggests that the randomization was successful.
One further analysis was run to test for differential attrition. That
is whether the drop-out rate was different for the three conditions
in the sample. A Pearson’
s chi-square test of independence
suggested that there was no systematic difference between the
cells in a crosstab [X2(2,617) = 1.56, p = 0.458]. Therefore, we
concluded that the drop-out constituted data missing at random,
and that further tests to investigate type of missingness would
be unwarranted as that is difficult to uncover (Jansen et al.,
2006).
Effects of the Planning Intervention (H4, H5, H6)
The overall means between conditions are portrayed in Figure 1.
Here it seems that both intervention groups and the control
group have a marked decline in distractive behavior. If the
intervention had an effect, this decline should be greater for
the intervention group. Hypothesis four, five, and six was
investigated using a repeated measure ANCOVA with intentions
and conscientiousness as covariates. Here, a single mean for
both categories of distractive behavior was used as dependent
variable, with time and condition as independent variables.
No significant interaction effect between the within-subject
factor time and the between-subject factor condition was found,
Wilks’λ= 1, F(1,412) = 0.19, p = 0.661, η2 = 0.000. This
suggests that the change over time in distracted behavior
is equal in the control group and intervention groups. The
main effect of time proved significant with a large effect size,
Wilks’λ= 0.864, F(1,412) = 64.6, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.136,
d = 0.79, which suggests that there was a marked decline in
distraction for my sample in total from T0 to T1 (Cohen,
1988). This also meant that there was no effect of the included
covariates.
Further repeated measure ANCOVAs were done to explore if
the effect was unique to those high in intentions to be safe drivers,
instead of just controlling for intentions. There was, however,
no significant effect on the interaction between time, condition,
FIGURE 1 | Means of distractive behavior at T0 and T1 between conditions in
the second sample.
and intention, Wilks’λ= 0.959, F(10,389) = 1.66, p = 0.088,
η2 = 0.041. The interaction between time and intention did,
however, turn out significant with a medium effect size, Wilks’
λ= 0.929, F(13,389) = 2.30, p = 0.006, η2 = 0.071. This suggested
that the decline in general distractions was greater for those with
higher intentions. One further ANCOVA explored the effect of
intervention on general distractions only for those who answered
that the plans they made were relevant. Those answering on
average above the semantic mean of 3.5 for those items were
included in the analysis. The effect may have been masked by
those who did not feel that the planning sections suited them
personally. However, still no effect was found for the interaction
of time and condition.
A similar repeated measure ANCOVA was run to explore the
difference in distractions between the two kinds of behavioral
strategies for mobile phone use. Here, mobile phone distraction
means were used as a dependent variable, and we looked for
interaction effects between either of the two dummy-coded
conditions and time passed. Neither empirically derived, Wilks’
λ= 1, F(1,408) = 0.07, p = 0.792, η2 = 0.000, nor theoretically
derived, Wilks’
λ= 0.999, F(1,408) = 0.23, p = 0.633, η2 = 0.001,
turned out significant. This suggested that neither kinds of
intervention were able to change mobile phone distractions.
An additional repeated measures ANCOVA was run to test
and explore the differences in effect on secondary tasks and
mobile phone use. No significant effect of intervention was found.
Not for secondary distractions’
interaction with condition, Wilks’
λ= 0.999, F(1,409) = 0.44, p = 0.508, η2 = 0.001, nor for

Johansson and Fyhri
Examining Driver Distraction
Testing Floor Effects
For the respondents that reported being very little distracted
at the onset, their possible behavior intervention gain was very
low. Thus, we wanted to explore if there only was an effect
for respondents who reported above mean levels of distractive
behavior. However, when running a repeated measures ANCOVA
excluding those who reported a lower mean than the baseline
mean of 2 (n = 262), we still uncovered no significant effects
of the interaction between time and being in the intervention
group [Wilks’
λ= 1, F(1,148) = 0.00, p = 0.952, η2 = 0.000].
This was also true when testing just secondary tasks [Wilks’
λ= 0.995, F(1,148) = 0.70, p = 0.403, η2 = 0.005] and both
mobile phone categories [Wilks’λ= 0.959, F(1,148) = 0.76,
p = 0.386, η2 = 0.005].
Testing Plans Directly
Testing effects on a high level of abstraction, operating with
means and groups, may cause some diffusion of intervention
effects. To explore the behaviors that respondents actually had
planned to reduce, we ran further repeated measure ANCOVAs
with simple contrasts.
First, we chose the four behaviors with the highest reported
baseline occurrence (i.e., “
Operating the radio,”“
Prolonged eye-
contact with passenger,”“
Reaching for an object in the car,”
and “
Answering incoming calls”
). Thereafter, we coded a new
variable to be able to test the effect of general intervention against
controls, and to test specific planners from the intervention
against controls. Results suggest that those planning to operate
the radio less, were successful in doing so given an alpha level
of 0.05 (n = 123, p = 0.018), while the other three were not.
Because of the explorative nature, a Bonferroni correction was
applied to adjust alpha-levels for multiple comparisons of the
four contrasts (0.05/4 = 0.013). This meant that the effect was
marginally significant. The marginal results on “
Operating the
radio” was followed up with further tests of the effect in a
hierarchical regression. Here, we put “
Operating the radio”at
T1 as dependent variable, and the score at T0 as independent
along with the mean score of intentions and conscientiousness,
and a dummy coded variable for condition in a second block.
This way, one can look at the change over time while controlling
for the covariates, and see if any effects change when specific
planning and control conditions are introduced. No significant
effect or change was found, and we were unable to reject the null
hypothesis.

used technical solutions to deal with their mobile phones while
driving was investigated. Of the 414 included in the post-survey
(T1), 161 reported using hands-free solutions and 69 put their
phones on speaker. Another 166 answered using Bluetooth
connections, and only 43 usually hold their phone to their
ear with their hand. Seventy-four reported never picking up
the phone while driving, and 45 reported using voice control.
Overall, this suggests that few actually use their phone the
way our plans were designed to counteract. When asking for
actual behavior instead of how often they were distracted, they
reported similar behavior as they had distractions. This suggests
that there is little discrepancy between what people report as
distractors and which possibly distracting behaviors they engage
with. Questions regarding if respondents felt that the plans they
had made had been relevant for them yielded encouraging results.
Here, they were asked to rate the relevance of their plans to
deal with the two categories of distractions on a seven-point
scale, with the first end-point being labeled “
to a very little
degree”and the seventh “
to a very large degree.”The mean
for these two items were 4.12, suggesting that most people
found their plans relevant. 4.52 was noted for the item “
I
have increased my awareness for safe driving,”and 4.94 for “
I
think this kind of planning could help others becoming safer
drivers.”
DISCUSSION
We have investigated baseline levels of distractions and its
predictors, and tested the efficacy of implementation intentions
in reducing drivers’distractions using two samples. In the
first sample there were several novel baseline descriptions
and differences. The most prominent predictors of distractions
were gender, how often driven, the TPB, and extraversion and
neuroticism, but not conscientiousness. In the second sample,
an intervention to reduce distractions was also tested. Here, we
found no effect of the intervention but one, marginally significant
effect on the most occurring distractor (i.e., “
Operating the
radio”
), and only for those who planned for that behavior
specifically. There was, however, an overall decline in distracted
behavior, perhaps suggesting that the study itself decreases level
of distracted driving. Crucially, some of the baseline predictions
were replicated in the second sample, where gender, how often
driven, attitudes, and PBC significantly predicted and shared
a linear relation with distractions. However, some differences
appeared that could be due to the different samples, for example
the absence of an effect of personality or social norms in the
second sample.

Demographic Differences (H1)
Gender was effective in predicting both categories of distractions
in the first sample, and predicted overall and mobile phone
distractions in the second. Age also showed a strong impact
when its variance increased in the second sample. This resonates
well with most previous research on young adults in general,
and in a traffic context in particular (Arnett, 1996; Rundmo and
Iversen, 2004; Statistisk Sentralbyrå
, 2016). Young males are more
accident prone, and this is largely explained by them engaging
in risk-taking behavior, such as distracted driving, to a larger
extent (Turner and McClure, 2003). However, others have found

Examining Driver Distraction
that females are more prone to distracted driving, which is not
supported in our data (Bone and Mowen, 2006). Other included
demographic variables seem to play less of a role in predicting
baseline differences in distracted behavior.
How often participants had driven was a significant predictor
for all categories of distractions, partially confirming the first
hypothesis of the project that those driving more and farther will
be more exposed to situations in which distractions could occur.
This can be linked to intention viability, where a goal state only
can be achieved if the prerequisite situation is encountered. If
one does not drive, one cannot become distracted while driving.
In addition, those who drive regularly are more likely to be
comfortable driving a car, and may find the task dull at times
(Bone and Mowen, 2006). Thus, they may be seeking other
stimulants and become more distracted drivers.
Additionally, and based on several notes from open-
comments sections in the studies, some questions regarded how
relevant plans had been and whether or not they used some sort of
hands-free with their mobile phones. A majority of respondents
in the second sample felt that their plans were more relevant
than not, that others could benefit from such an intervention,
and that they had increased awareness of safety in traffic. This
is encouraging and could help explain the overall decline in
distractive behavior from T0 to T1. When asking about remedies
for using mobile phones in cars, a minority reported holding
their phone to their ear. Bluetooth solutions and hands-free were
common, and may have made some of the volitional help sheet
redundant, thus undermining intervention efficacy. The added
range of behavioral solutions to reduce distractions from mobile
phones could be addressed by future research.
The Theory of Planned Behavior (H2)
The second hypothesis was partially confirmed. Attitudes toward
distractions, while mostly significant in both samples, seem to
play more of a role in predicting differences between baseline
variation in distracted behavior for a sample of high-school
students. It could be inferred that young people take others’
opinions more into account, and that more negative perceived
norms work as a stronger deterrent for them. Senior drivers
from the general population may operate by habit to a larger
extent, thus making others’
evaluations of a behavior less relevant.
Some research has suggested that social norms and modeling
from peers are important influences on behavior in adolescents
(Beck and Treiman, 1996). Others have found that internalizing
social norms is an important marker of entering adulthood
(Arnett, 2001). This may indicate that interventions could target
social norms among young, but rather habitual behavior for
more experienced drivers. Another nuancing finding comes
from investigating the two measures of PBC. Here, PBC for
drivers’
distractions showed a significant impact on self-reported
distractive behavior, while PBC for general driving did not. PBC
is closely linked with self-efficacy, and has been seen as one of
the variables of the TPB that can predict behavior on its own
(Bandura, 1977; Ajzen, 1985). We also tested whether the effects
of attitudes and PBC on behavior in the second sample were
mediated by intentions, as TPB would suggest. While the best
test strategy would be structural equation modeling, we sought
a tentative answer to this question using the Baron and Kenny
(1986) approach. Specifically, by following the four steps of their
mediation analysis, we find that for distractions, it seems that
intentions only partially mediate the direct effects of attitudes and
PBC, while the effect of subjective norms on distractions seems to
be only indirect via intentions.
Personality and Prediction (H3)
The third hypothesis was partially confirmed. Personality traits
only showed significant predictions in the first sample, where
more neurotic or extraverted respondents reported being more
distracted drivers. For extraversion, this effect was only present
for mobile phone use and not for secondary tasks, which may
suggest that the social aspect of a phone draws these people to
expose themselves to such risks. Social attention has been argued
as a cornerstone of the extraversion trait, and this desire to be
relevant to other people may cause them to get distracted while
driving (Ashton et al., 2002). Furthermore, extraversion has been
linked to reckless behavior and sensation-seeking, which could
further increase the trait’
s predictive value in this context (Arnett,
1996; Rundmo and Iversen, 2004). These facets seem to combine
to predict phone distractions, but not the inherently less social
secondary task distractions.
Neuroticism significantly predicted distractions in both
categories in the first sample. Two different mechanisms may
be at play for each of the categories of distractions. First, these
respondents may exhibit a proneness to reactive distraction, and
mobile phone distractions can be the result of a bottom-up
reaction to a stimulus (Jovanovi´
c et al., 2011). Secondly, some
suggest that both high and low scores of neuroticism is bad
for traffic safety; a high score may yield mood deviations and
instability, making drivers obsess over details, while a low score
may yield a lack of concern or too much reliance on other traffic
safety measures (Lajunen, 2001). A neurotic driver may thus be
more affected by things that are “
off”when driving, so as to
increase reported distractions.
In both samples, there was a lack of predictive efficacy from
conscientiousness. Other research has produced contradictory
results regarding conscientiousness and drivers’
behavior (Bone
and Mowen, 2006; Dahlen and White, 2006). Some have
noted the conflicting evidence regarding conscientiousness and
accidents or reckless behavior while arguing for its efficacy
(Clarke and Robertson, 2005). A generally conflicting field
of evidence could result from the application of the trait
to somewhat different domains. Applications to health-related
behavior (Bogg and Roberts, 2004), traffic crashes (Arthur
and Doverspike, 2001), accident risk (Sümer et al., 2005),
and generally deviant behavior (Salgado, 2002), have, however,
yielded significant effects. These results suggest that distractions
in traffic, different to accidents, are an area with less impact of
conscientiousness. These results warrant further investigation.
Intervention Results (H4, H5, H6)
Learning from an Ineffectual Intervention

was less than expected; hypotheses four, five, and six were all
rejected. This also means that my hypothesized mediators of

Johansson and Fyhri
Examining Driver Distraction
planning effects lack a proper test, as we only uncovered one
marginally significant effect. One possible reason for the failure
to find an intervention effect is lack of engagement. There are
several links between respondents’intolerance to alternatives,
cognitive simplicity and how they respond (Knowles and Nathan,
1997). This highlights that acquiescence responding can be a
problem in addition to social responding or desirability bias.
A questionnaire that asks too much of respondents’capacity,
beyond their ability or interest, can thus directly impact how
they answer and whether they engage with the study. In this
case, the mental load asked of the participants may have
been too large, including several demographic and personality
variables, measures of the TPB, baseline behavior, in addition to
the eventual forming of plans. Without much incentive, many
respondents may have failed to engage properly.
It is proposed that just reading about critical situations will
engage the reader in simulation (Martiny-Huenger et al., 2015).
No conscious intent is supposed to be needed for behavior change
(Bayer et al., 2009). Yet, evidence suggests that forming booster
plans increases the impact of these interventions, suggesting
that more engagement may increase its efficacy (Chapman and
Armitage, 2010). This may be especially true when using a
volitional help sheet where participants do not write their own
plans. Because lack of engagement is an issue, an easy-to-use and
entertaining technical module may mitigate this. Interactivity is
suggested as a key feature of internet-based intervention designs,
and that engaging designs lead to better retention (Hurling et al.,
2006). Digital designs of this kind are a relatively novel and
rapidly growing field of systematic study, and this research adds
some to the existing knowledge by pointing at weaknesses that
may undermine effectiveness (Portnoy et al., 2008).
Operationalization and Effect Diffusion
The operationalization of distractive behavior may be further
improved by future research. Not just in terms of the structure of
the 11 chosen behaviors, and their belonging to certain categories,
but their relevance to actual distractions. For example, while
many may become distracted by mobile phones, it is evident
that several systems are in place to mitigate this. A range of new
possible plans spawn when introducing these technical systems.
A Bluetooth connection that does not work properly can be
as distracting as a phone call, but needs an entirely different
plan to reduce distractions in traffic. A solution where each
respondent chooses their own baseline behaviors and distractors,
and thus plans for these distractors specifically may increase
intervention efficacy. This gives increased relevance for each
participant, in addition to making each distractor easier to follow-
up. As suggested by the one significant effect, a diffusion of actual
planning effects on specific behaviors can drown in noise if the
behaviors are compiled into a single index of distractive behavior.
Furthermore, statistical noise could arise from respondents
answering that they never were distracted by most items, and very
often by a single factor. A driver may have most distractors under
control, but still often get distracted by the radio or if someone
calls. These individual variations would also have gotten lost in
the averaging of behaviors across participants, and would require
further exploratory analysis to disentangle.
A Question Behavior Effect?
There was an overall decline in distracted behavior from T0 to
T1. This decline was not accounted for by the intervention, and
it seems it was due to the passing of time alone. It can be argued
that the surveys themselves may have had some impact. Because
of the design of the study, this could not be tested. It could be
argued that those with intentions to be safe drivers only needed
a reminder and a push that was the baseline questions in order
to become safer drivers. By knowing that the study inquired
about distractive behavior, and that they would be measured at
multiple time points, they may have been extra conscious of their
behavior and exhibit a question behavior effect (Morwitz and
Fitzsimons, 2004). It is proposed that being measured on one’
s
intentions specifically may increase the availability of specific
thoughts and attitudes about a certain behavior. The results can
also be the result of a Hawthorne effect, where people can alter
behavior when they think they are being subjected to an effective
intervention (McCarney et al., 2007). Therefore, further research
should include either less engaging control groups or both
an active and passive control group. Wording of information
and questions should also be kept as neutral, yet engaging, as
possible.
Limitations
While biased in certain ways, self-report data still hold some
validity. In many contexts including this, it is an easy and efficient
access to many data points. Self-report data has also been shown
to correlate highly with observed behavior in similar domains
(Elliott et al., 2007). However, social desirability (Podsakoff
et al., 2003), order effects (Hogarth and Einhorn, 1992), such as
primacy or recency, or a range of other response biases may be
at play (Furnham, 1986). Still, this is a convenient and efficient
way of gathering satisfactory data, and steps were taken to reduce
these biases. A passive control group could also be included to
filter out potential question behavior effects and to examine the
degree to which this exists in this domain. Several post-surveys
could also gauge the long-term effects of such an intervention.
This project contained a number of hypotheses, and many
different tests. The article tries to explore new territory
and therefore contains many variables. However, there is an
important disjuncture between simple exploration for the sake
of finding novelties and the testing of hypotheses. The recent
crisis in social psychology suggests that fishing for significant
results, along with few participants and lack of replication lead to
unreliable science (Earp and Trafimow, 2015). Researcher degrees
of freedom refer to how researchers can change their goals and
analytic methods ad hoc and only report statistically significant
effects. Therefore, it is important to consider adjusting alpha
levels (for example using Bonferroni corrections), and being
clear when one tests specific, pre-determined hypotheses and
when one goes exploring for interesting effects and relationships.
We have tried to be clear about these issues, but there still
may be reason to argue that a tighter experimental control and
more stringent alpha levels should be exercised. As previously
discussed, some items and scales would also benefit from re-
operationalization to better fit a normal distribution. For analyses
and statistical inferences, however, assumptions were met. We

tested for homoscedasticity and collinearity, as well as normally
distributed residuals.
Societal Implications and Future
Research
This article provided novel tests of individual differences in
distractive behavior, both in a sample of high school students
and a more general sample, and a description of distractions.
While the interventions largely failed to prove their utility,
further research should focus on making the digital volitional
help sheets better, as this possibly could be a an affordable way
of delivering an effectual intervention to drivers to great benefit.
Furthermore, tests of baseline differences suggest that there are
systematic differences between who gets more distracted. For
example, results indicate that behavior change could target social
factors among young, but rather on habitual behavior for more
experienced drivers. Younger males with bad attitudes and poor
PBC seem to generally be a group associated with greater risk,
which should be focused on for future campaigns. This should
also be considered when designing future volitional help sheets
in this context.
Future research could include measures of sensation-seeking,
risk-taking, and related factors to investigate whether these
impact distractions directly. Additionally, a re-operationalization
of distractive behavior is recommended, where diffusion of effects
by averaging items into a mean or an index is considered.
CONCLUSION
In this article, results from two different samples were reported.
The purpose was to investigate the nature of distractions in traffic,
test predictors of baseline levels of distractions, and to test the
efficacy of implementation intentions in reducing distractions.
In the first sample, only baseline data was considered, while
the second also tested an intervention. In both cases, people
did not generally report being very distracted. The TPB turned
out as a significant predictor of baseline distraction, along
with age and gender and how often respondents had driven.
Personality significantly predicted distractive behavior in the
first sample, but not in the second. The intervention in the
second sample largely failed to provide significant reduction of
distractions, but there was an overall decline. Marginal effects
on the most occurring distractor for those who planned for that
specific distractor, suggest that one would benefit from studying
single behaviors instead of means. Societal implications and
possible improvements for future research and application are
discussed. To maximize the effect of internet-based interventions
an engaging digital design focusing on specific behaviors and
plans may important.
