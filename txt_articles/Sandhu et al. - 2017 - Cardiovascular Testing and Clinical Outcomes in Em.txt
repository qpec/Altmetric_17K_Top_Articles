in Emergency Department Patients With Chest Pain

IMPORTANCE Noninvasive testing and coronary angiography are used to evaluate patients
who present to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain, but their effects on
outcomes are uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether cardiovascular testing—noninvasive imaging or coronary
angiography—is associated with changes in the rates of coronary revascularization or acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) admission in patients who present to the ED with chest pain
without initial findings of ischemia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort analysis used weekday
(Monday-Thursday) vs weekend (Friday-Sunday) presentation as an instrument to adjust for
unobserved case-mix variation (selection bias) between 2011 and 2012. National claims data
(Truven MarketScan) was used. The data included a total of 926 633 privately insured
patients ages 18 to 64 years who presented to the ED with chest pain without initial diagnosis
consistent with acute ischemia.
EXPOSURES Noninvasive testing or coronary angiography within 2 days or 30 days of
presentation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end points were coronary revascularization
(percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery) and AMI
admission at 7, 30, 180, and 365 days. The secondary end points were coronary angiography
and coronary artery bypass grafting in those who underwent angiography.
RESULTS The patients were ages 18 to 64 years with an average age of 44.4 years. A total of
536 197 patients (57.9%) were women. Patients who received testing (224 973) had
increased risk at baseline and had greater risk of AMI admission than those who did not
receive testing (701 660) (0.35% vs 0.14% at 30 days). Weekday patients (571 988) had
similar baseline comorbidities to weekend patients (354 645) but were more likely to receive
testing. After risk factor adjustment, testing within 30 days was associated with a significant
increase in coronary angiography (36.5 per 1000 patients tested; 95% CI, 21.0-52.0) and
revascularization (22.8 per 1000 patients tested; 95% CI, 10.6-35.0) at 1 year but no
significant change in AMI admissions (7.8 per 1000 patients tested; 95% CI, −1.4 to 17.0).
Testing within 2 days was also associated with a significant increase in coronary
revascularization but no difference in AMI admissions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cardiac testing in patients with chest pain was associated
with increased downstream testing and treatment without a reduction in AMI admissions,
suggesting that routine testing may not be warranted. Further research into whether specific
high-risk subgroups benefit from testing is needed.

ach year, more than 6 million patients present to emer-
gencydepartments(EDs)intheUnitedStateswithacute
chest pain. Most—after initial evaluation with cardiac
enzymes and an electrocardiogram—lack evidence of acute
ischemia.1-3 However, given the morbidity of missed diagno-
ses, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends non-
invasive cardiac testing for inducible ischemia (exercise elec-
trocardiogram [ECG], stress echocardiography, nuclear stress
test) or anatomical coronary artery disease (coronary com-
puted tomographic [CT] angiography) prior to discharge or
within 72 hours.4,5 Patients with positive noninvasive testing
typically undergo coronary angiography. High-risk patients
may proceed directly to angiography even in the absence of
objectively verified ischemia. Cardiovascular testing is costly
and time-intensive. Moreover, it is unclear whether current
practice reduces the risk of future cardiovascular events in pa-
tients without evidence of acute ischemia.6,7
Past observational analyses have shown that noninva-
sive testing is associated with large increases in downstream
testing and treatment without a reduction in subsequent
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admissions.8,9 Accord-
ingly, some have suggested that the current practice should be
modified.6,10-12 However, patients who receive testing are
higher risk, raising concerns about residual confounding.13 In
previous work, patients who underwent noninvasive testing
were older with more comorbidities.8 Although the study ad-
justed for these differences, the 2 groups likely also differed
incharacteristicsnotcapturedinclaimsdata,suchaschestpain
severity or electrocardiogram findings.
We used an instrumental-variables approach to reduce po-
tentialunmeasuredconfounding.Patientspresentingonweek-
days are more likely to receive testing owing to the resource-
intensive nature of testing, but unmeasured patient
characteristics—affecting treatment and outcomes—are less
likely to vary across the week. This approach has been used
to adjust for unobserved case-mix variation in other acute
conditions in which the timing of presentation is unrelated
to patient characteristics but predicts the receipt of inten-
sive interventions.14,15 We used the day of the week of
presentation—weekday vs weekend—as an instrumental
variable to study the association between cardiovascular
testing (noninvasive testing or coronary angiography) and
the risk of revascularization and AMI admissions in patients
who present to the ED with chest pain without initial evi-
dence of acute ischemia.
Methods
Data
We analyzed MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encoun-
ters (Truven Health Analytics) data from January 1, 2010, to
December 31, 2013.16 This database includes inpatient, outpa-
tient, and pharmaceutical claims of more than 75 million em-
ployees, retirees, and dependents from more than 150 payers
acrossallstates.WeselectedallEDvisitsbetween2011and2012
for those ages 18 to 64 years. Diagnoses and procedures were
coded using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Re-
vision (ICD-9-CM),17 diagnosis-related groups (DRGs),18 and
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)19 (see eTable 1 in the
Supplement for codes used).
Cohort
We identified a cohort of ED patients in 2011 to 2012 with a di-
agnosis of chest pain or angina pectoris among patients ages
18to64(eFigureintheSupplement).Weexcludedpatientswith
diagnoses that suggest evidence of acute ischemia: AMI, in-
termediate coronary syndrome, acute coronary syndrome
without coronary occlusion, and other acute ischemic heart
disease. We excluded patients with alternate cardiopulmo-
nary diagnoses made in the ED that could explain chest pain
(eFigureintheSupplement).Finally,weexcludedpatientswith
capitatedhealthcareplanswhomayhaveincompletedatacap-
ture. The study sample included 926 633 unique adult ED
visits for chest pain in 2011 to 2012. The reasons for exclusion
were similar on weekdays and weekends (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). Because the analysis includes only analysis of
secondarydeidentifieddata,itdoesnotmeettheStanfordUni-
versityorNationalInstitutesofHealthdefinitionofhumansub-
ject research requiring institutional review board approval.
Measures
We determined if patients underwent testing within 2 or 30
calendar days following their ED visit. We used a 2-day cutoff
to analyze testing that would occur within 72 hours of the ED
visit as per AHA guidelines. The 30-day cutoff was intended
to include all testing that was performed as a result of the ED
visit. Testing included coronary angiography or noninvasive
testing: exercise electrocardiography, stress echocardiogra-
phy, myocardial perfusion scan, or CT coronary angiography.
The primary outcomes were subsequent AMI admission
and coronary revascularization—defined as either percutane-
ous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft
(CABG) surgery. We extracted outcome data at 7 days, 30 days,
180days,and1yearaftertheEDvisit.Eachtimepointwasused
as an outcome for testing within 2 days; outcomes at 180 and
365 days were used for testing within 30 days. We also as-
sessed coronary angiography to determine if testing in-
creased the use of angiography long-term or if those without
Key Points
Question In patients who present to the emergency department
with chest pain without evidence of ischemia, is cardiac
testing—noninvasive testing or coronary angiography—associated
with changes in revascularization or acute myocardial infarction
(AMI) admissions?
Findings In a retrospective cohort analysis of 926 633 patients,
we used the day of presentation as an instrumental variable to
adjust for potential selection bias. Cardiac testing was associated
with increased revascularization without a significant change in
AMI admissions.
Meaning Routine testing may increase resource utilization
without improving outcomes in patients who present to the
emergency department with chest pain without evidence of
ischemia.

 initial testing underwent deferred angiography. Subsequent
AMI admission is a measure of health outcomes, whereas an-
giography and revascularization are indicators of down-
stream resource use.
We established prior risk factors using claims from the year
prior to ED presentation. We identified a history of diabetes,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, pe-
ripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or to-
bacco use based on their respective ICD-9-CM diagnoses or a
claim for a disease-related medication using the databases’
therapeutic classes. We identified a history of ischemic heart
disease with a prior diagnosis of MI or ischemic heart disease.
We determined if patients were receiving antiplatelet therapy
or antihyperlipidemic agents. We ascertained previous out-
patient and inpatient cardiology evaluation using CPT codes
from the year prior to presentation.
Statistical Analysis
We compared patient characteristics and unadjusted out-
comes between cohorts using the 2-sample t test for continu-
ous variables and the χ2 test for categorical variables. We per-
formed2-tailedhypothesistestingwithanα=.05.Wealsoused
Cohen d (standardized mean difference) to evaluate the mag-
nitude of cohort differences with a cutoff of 0.1 considered
meaningful. We used STATA statistical software (version 14.1;
StataCorp).
We used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for age,
sex,hypertension,diabetes,hyperlipidemia,ischemicheartdis-
ease, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, periph-
eral vascular disease, tobacco use, noninvasive testing in the
preceding year, coronary angiography in the preceding year,
previous antiplatelet medication use, and previous antihyper-
lipidemic medication use. We present the results as the aver-
age marginal effect of a change in testing in 1000 patients.
The instrumental variables analysis is intended to reduce
residual confounding in the estimated treatment effect by
comparing patients stratified by an instrument: a variable that
predicts receipt of the treatment (cardiac testing) but is uncor-
related with observed and unobserved patient characteristics
(ie, electrocardiogram changes). Acute chest pain is an emer-
gent condition, so baseline risk is unlikely to affect the day of
theweekofpresentation,asseeninsimilaracuteconditions.14,15
Hospitalshavedecreasedtestingavailabilityonweekends,caus-
ing some weekend patients to not receive testing that would be
received on a weekday. We evaluated the validity of the instru-
ment using 2 criteria: the day of presentation predicted testing
(strengthofinstrument)andwasindependentofobservablepa-
tient characteristics, suggesting independence of unobserv-
able characteristics (exclusion restriction).
We performed 2-stage residual inclusion multivariable lo-
gisticregressionwithweekend(Friday-Sunday)presentationas
aninstrumentalvariable.20Thisisaneffectivestatisticalapproach
when unobserved confounding is a potential problem. We first
usedmultivariablelogisticregressiontomodeltheeffectofweek-
endpresentationontesting—withthesamecovariatesasthenon-
instrumented analysis—and calculated residuals. We then re-
gressed each outcome on testing, including the residuals as an
additional covariate. 95% Confidence intervals were estimated
with1000bootstrapsamples.Thestrengthoftheinstrumentwas
evaluatedusingtheχ2contrastfortheinstrument(weekendpre-
sentation) in the first-stage regression.
We tested whether the effect of cardiovascular testing on
revascularization or AMI admissions at 1 year varied by pa-
tient characteristics (sex, diabetes, ischemic heart disease,
chronic kidney disease, coronary angiography within the pre-
vious year, noninvasive testing in the previous year, and age
older than 46 years or 46 years or younger, which was the me-
dian).Wedeterminedthemarginaleffectoftestingineachsub-
groupandtestedthedifferenceinpairedsubgroups(eg,women
with men) with 1000 bootstrapped samples.
We evaluated CABG surgery—typically reserved for pa-
tientswithobjectivelyworsecoronaryarterydisease—inthesub-
population of patients who underwent angiography to deter-
mine if testing preferentially identified more severe disease.
Sensitivity Analyses
We adjusted for other potential differences in care over the
weekend that may relate to our primary outcomes: cardiol-
ogy consultation, admission to the hospital, or antiplatelet or
antihyperlipidemic medication claims. To evaluate if uneven
follow-upaffectedresults,weperformedtheanalysiswhileex-
cluding patients without a full year of follow-up. We adjusted
our exclusion criteria to include higher-risk patients with a di-
agnosis of “other acute or subacute ischemic heart disease.”
Finally,wevariedthedefinitionoftestingtoincludeonlythose
who underwent noninvasive testing within 30 days or angi-
ography within 2 days of the ED visit.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
The data included a total of 926 633 privately insured pa-
tients ages 18 to 64 years, with an average age of 44.4 years;
536 197 patients (57.9%) were women. Patients presenting on
Monday to Thursday were more likely to receive cardiovascu-
lar testing within 2 or 30 days (18.2% and 26.1%) than those
presenting on Friday to Sunday (12.3% and 21.4%) (Table 1).
Of those who underwent testing, 91.5% of weekday and 91.2%
of weekend patients received noninvasive testing, with a simi-
lar distribution of modalities within each group.
While patients who received testing had higher-risk char-
acteristics than those who did not, there was minimal differ-
ence in risk factors between weekday and weekend patients
(Table 2). Patients who received testing within 30 days were
older (49.7 years vs 42.6), more likely men (47.5% vs 40.4%),
and had higher rates of most traditional cardiac risk factors
(for hypertension, 47.8% vs 38.2%) compared with the
nontesting cohort. Patients presenting on weekdays had
similar age (44.4 years vs 44.3 years), likelihood of being men
(42.1%vs42.3%),andtraditionalcardiacriskfactors(forhyper-
tension, 40.7% vs 40.3%) compared with patients presenting
on weekends. There was a similar proportion of primary insur-
ancebeneficiariesonweekdays(65.2%)andweekends(63.5%).
Thestandardizedmeandifferencebetweenweekdayandweek-
end presenters was less than 0.1 for all characteristics.

 Unadjusted Outcomes
Patients who underwent testing within 2 or 30 days had higher
rates of coronary angiography, revascularization, and AMI ad-
mission at each follow-up period (Table 3). Weekday patients
underwent more angiography (5.5 per 1000 patients; 95% CI,
4.5-6.6) but had similar rates of revascularization (0.3 per 1000
patients;95%CI,−0.2to0.8)andAMIadmissions(−0.3per1000
patients; 95% CI, −0.6 to 0.1) as weekend patients at 1 year.

 patients tested (95% CI, 5.6-24.4) at 1 year. Testing was not as-
sociated with a significant change in AMI admissions at 1 year
(2.3 per 1000 patients; 95% CI, −3.2 to 7.8).
With a 30-day testing cutoff, there was a significant in-
crease in angiography (36.5 per 1000 patients; 95% CI, 21.1-
52.0) at 1 year that was smaller than seen in the multivariable
analysis. There was also a significant increase in coronary re-
vascularization at 1 year but no significant change in AMI ad-
missions (7.8 per 1000 patients; 95% CI, −1.4 to 17.0).
Testing was consistently associated with more revascular-
ization in patient subgroups with higher baseline cardiac risk
(Figure; eTables 3 and 4 in the Supplement). However, there
were no subgroups in which testing was associated with a re-
ductioninAMIadmissions.Amongpatientswhoeventuallyun-
derwentangiography,thosewhoreceivedearlytestingwereless

Sensitivity Analyses
Weevaluatediftheeffectsoftestingareduetoadditionalvaria-
tions in treatment. The standardized mean difference for each
additional potential variation in initial treatment—cardiology
evaluation, hospital admission, or antiplatelet or antihyper-
lipidemic medication claims—was less than 0.1 between week-
day and weekend cohorts (eTables 6-8 in the Supplement). Af-
teradjustingfortheseinterventions,testingwasstillassociated
with an increase in revascularizations without a reduction in
AMI admissions (eTables 9 and 10 in the Supplement).
Weekday presentation was associated with a small in-
crease in coronary angiography without noninvasive testing
in the first 2 days with similar rates for the remainder of the
month.Includingonlythosewhounderwentnoninvasivetest-
ing within 30 days or angiography within 2 days (excluding an-
giography alone from 3 to 30 days) did not change our results
(eTable 11 in the Supplement).
Neitherexcludingthe370 544patientswithlessthan1year

a diagnosis of “other acute and subacute forms of ischemic
heart disease” substantially changed the effect of testing
(eTables 9 and 10 in the Supplement).
Discussion
We evaluated the association between cardiac testing and sub-
sequentclinicaloutcomesinpatientspresentingtotheEDwith
acute chest pain. Previous observational analyses suggested
that noninvasive testing of ED patients is associated with in-
creased rates of coronary angiography and revascularization
without affecting AMI admissions.8,9,21 However, unmea-
sured risk factors may be associated with more noninvasive
testingandworseclinicaloutcomes,potentiallyobscuringben-
efits and undermining the analyses. We also found that test-

estimated using the average marginal
effect for each subgroup. Presented P
values are the difference between
the average marginal effects in paired
subgroups (ie, women and men) in
1000 bootstrapped samples. Cardiac
testing includes either noninvasive
test (exercise electrocardiography,
stress echocardiography, myocardial
perfusion scan, and cardiac
computed tomographic angiography)
or coronary angiography. Analyses
were adjusted for age; sex; comorbid
conditions (diabetes, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney

 an instrumental variable analysis using the day of presenta-
tion as an instrument to reduce potential selection bias.
The day of presentation seems to be a strong and valid in-
strument: predicting receipt of cardiac testing and only affect-
ing outcomes via testing. Acute chest pain leads to urgent pre-
sentation, so patients who present to the ED are similar on
weekdays and weekends. We believe the remarkable balance
in all tested observable patient characteristics between co-
horts provides compelling support to our assumption that un-
observed risk factors were also likely independent of the day
of presentation.
Theprimarydifferenceintreatmentbetweenweekdayand
weekend presentation was the increased use of cardiovascu-
lar testing on weekdays; there was 47% more testing within 2
days and 22% more within 30 days. Other differences in care
were much smaller and potentially effect mediators down-
stream to the decision and outcome of cardiac testing. Adjust-
ing for these differences did not change our results.
In patients with AMI, observational studies have demon-
stratedworseoutcomesonweekends.22,23Thesefindingslikely
do not apply to our lower-risk cohort given differences in treat-
ment and treatment effect. Furthermore, if there were a bias
it would be toward finding a clinical benefit for cardiac test-
ing because on weekends, the time historically associated with
worse outcomes, less cardiac testing is performed. However,
our study found no significant difference in AMI admissions
between weekday and weekend presentation.
We found testing was associated with increased down-
stream testing and treatment, but the instrumented analysis
demonstratedasmallerincreaseinangiographycomparedwith
the noninstrumented analysis. Analyses that do not ad-
equatelyadjustforselectionbiascanoverestimatetheeffecton
downstream resource utilization; this accounts for the differ-
ences in the effect size of testing on angiography. The increase
in angiography decreased with longer follow-up; testing after
ED presentation may sometimes lead to an earlier evaluation
that would otherwise be later performed. Our analysis sug-
gests testing deferral is not associated with increased AMI ad-
missions.Furtheranalysisoftheeffectoftestingonhealthcare
utilization and costs will refine future practice recommenda-
tions and guide patient-physician shared decision-making.
Testing led to more revascularization in those with greater
baseline risk but did not decrease AMI admissions in any sub-
groupsorpreferentiallyselectedpatientswithmoreseveredis-
ease—those requiring CABG surgery. However, we evaluated
the benefit in patients who are variably tested depending on
the day of presentation. The results would not be directly ap-
plicable to a higher-risk subgroup that always receives test-
ing regardless of day of presentation. Our results show that car-
diac testing is overused and reinforces the need to evaluate
which, if any, patients with chest pain without evidence of is-
chemia benefit from noninvasive testing.
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Associa-
tion guidelines include a moderate recommendation that ben-
efits outweigh the risks for noninvasive testing before dis-
charge or within 72 hours in troponin-negative patients with
a nondiagnostic ECG.5 This recommendation is based on ob-
servational studies that negative testing indicates a patient’
s
subsequent risk for cardiac events is low enough for outpa-
tient follow-up.24-26 However, this risk is low before testing in
such patients.27,28 As EDs transition to increasingly sensitive
troponin assays, troponin-negative patients’risk will de-
crease further. The value of any testing is tied to the benefit
of treating test-positive patients, and—despite increasing re-
vascularization—testing did not reduce subsequent AMI ad-
missions in our analysis.
Both noninvasive testing and coronary angiography were
performed more frequently with weekday presentation; with
a single instrumental variable, the interventions could not be
analyzed separately. However, fewer than 10% of tested pa-
tients underwent angiography without noninvasive testing. In
the 2-day analysis, this subgroup represents a small group of
high-risk patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of acute
ischemia with negative cardiac enzyme testing (unstable an-
gina). These patients are more likely to benefit and their in-
clusion should bias results toward a positive treatment ef-
fect. The 30-day analysis also included an additional
subgroup—those who underwent delayed angiography with-
out noninvasive testing (2.9% of the testing cohort)—but did
not demonstrate a reduction in AMI admissions with or with-
out this subgroup.

Conclusions
Appropriate treatment of ED patients with chest pain with-
out evidence of ischemia remains controversial. The corner-
stone of treatment has been risk stratification with noninva-
sive testing. We found that testing was not associated with a
reduction in subsequent AMI admissions and further re-
search is needed to evaluate whether a benefit is present in
higher risk subgroups. We believe the current evidence sup-
