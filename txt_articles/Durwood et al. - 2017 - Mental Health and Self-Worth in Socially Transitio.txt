Abstract
Objective—Social transitions are increasingly common for transgender children. A social 
transition involves a child presenting to other people as a member of the “opposite” gender in all 
contexts (e.g., wearing clothes and using pronouns of that gender). Little is known about the well-
being of socially transitioned transgender children. This study examined self-reported depression, 
anxiety, and self-worth in socially transitioned transgender children compared with 2 control 
groups: age- and gender-matched controls and siblings of transgender children.
Method—As part of a longitudinal study (TransYouth Project), children (9–14 years old) and 
their parents completed measurements of depression and anxiety (n = 63 transgender children, n = 
63 controls, n = 38 siblings). Children (6–14 years old; n = 116 transgender children, n = 122 
controls, n = 72 siblings) also reported on their self-worth. Mental health and self-worth were 
compared across groups.
Results—Transgender children reported depression and self-worth that did not differ from their 
matched-control or sibling peers (p = .311), and they reported marginally higher anxiety (p = .
076). Compared with national averages, transgender children showed typical rates of depression (p 
= .290) and marginally higher rates of anxiety (p = .096). Parents similarly reported that their 
transgender children experienced more anxiety than children in the control groups (p = .002) and 
rated their transgender children as having equivalent levels of depression (p = .728).
Conclusion—These findings are in striking contrast to previous work with gender-
nonconforming children who had not socially transitioned, which found very high rates of 
depression and anxiety. These findings lessen concerns from previous work that parents of socially 
transitioned children could be systematically underreporting mental health problems.

An increasing number of parents of transgender children, or children who identify as the 
gender “opposite” their natal sex (e.g., natal male children who assert they are girls and natal 
female children who assert they are boys), have allowed their children to “socially 
transition.” A social transition is a nonmedical decision to allow a child to change his or her 
first name, pronouns, hairstyle, and clothing to live everyday life as one’s asserted gender.1 
In most cases, these children have asserted their gender identity as different from their natal 
sex for months or years, during which they often express dissatisfaction and/or disgust with 
their anatomy, which in extreme cases can trigger threats or attempts at self-harm.2–5 Parent 
decisions to allow transgender children to socially transition have received significant media 
attention,6–8 with many lay and scientific skeptics asserting concern for the wellbeing of 
these children in the short and long term.9–13 In contrast, one small qualitative study 
described the intervention, from the perspective of parents, as having been transformative for 
their children by alleviating mental health problems and improving the child’s wellbeing 
almost immediately.14 Despite considerable debate on these early childhood social 
transitions, remarkably little empirical evidence on this issue has appeared in the scientific 
record.
To date, there have been no reports on socially transitioned transgender children’s views of 
their own wellbeing. Self-reports of transgender people’s mental health have been limited to 
older teens and adults and indicate dramatically increased rates of anxiety and 
depression15–18 and alarming rates of suicidality.19–23 Some estimates have suggested that 
as many as 41% of transgender adults have attempted suicide in their lifetime.22
Although self-report data on the mental health of socially transitioned transgender children 
are absent in the literature, a recent study examined parent-reported mental health in these 
children.24 Parents reported that socially transitioned transgender children had normative 
levels of depression and marginally increased levels of anxiety compared with national 
norms. Compared with their siblings and age- and gender-matched controls, no significant 
increases in anxiety and depression were observed. These findings were notable because 
previous work with gender-nonconforming children who had not socially transitioned 
reported drastically increased rates of anxiety and depression, with more than 50% of older 
children falling in the clinical range of internalizing symptoms.25–27
Importantly, there are several potential issues with relying on parent reports of internalizing 
symptoms. Even in children who are “gender typical,” parents often underreport 
internalizing symptoms, possibly because they are unaware of these internal 
experiences.28–31 The tendency to underreport internalizing symptoms is especially likely 
for parents of socially transitioned transgender children because these parents could be 
motivated (intentionally or not) to report low rates of psychopathology, even if children are 
experiencing difficulties. This might occur because parents want to justify their decision to 
socially transition their child. Research in social psychology has long suggested that people 
show confirmation biases,32 that is, seeking out information that supports their existing

 beliefs. In this way, parents might see what they expect to see, even if a child is struggling. 
For these reasons, examining children’s perceptions of their own mental health is especially 
crucial.
In addition to assessing anxiety and depression, this study assessed self-worth. Previous 
work has suggested that self-worth is an important predictor of future mental health 
outcomes in typically developing children and adolescents,33–36 and self-worth 
measurements can be used reliably with children at young ages.37
Therefore, the present work assessed socially transitioned transgender children’s self-worth 
(6–14 years old) and mental health (anxiety and depression, 9–14 years old) compared with 
a group of age-matched controls and a group of siblings of transgender children. In addition, 
children’s reports of their own anxiety and depression were compared with parents’ reports 
of the same children’s anxiety and depression (on the same day). The latter allowed us to 
assess whether parents tend to underreport mental health problems in their socially 
transitioned transgender children.
METHOD
Participants
Participants were enrolled at the time of the study in the TransYouth Project (TYP), a 
national, longitudinal study of socially transitioned transgender children. Families of 
socially transitioned transgender children were recruited into the broader TYP study through 
word of mouth, national and local support groups, summer camps, and online forums for 
families of transgender and gender-nonconforming youth. Transgender children came from 
23 US states and 1 Canadian province: 22% from the Pacific Northwest, 18% from 
California, 6% from the Mountain states, 7% from the Southwest, 21% from the Midwest, 
11% from the South, 6% from the Mid-Atlantic region, and 9% from the Northeast. Of the 
families of transgender children, 52% identified themselves as living in a suburban area, 
25% as living in an urban area, 17% as living in a small town, 3% as living in a rural area, 
and the remaining 3% listed multiple categories.
To be included as a transgender participant in the present study, children needed to identify 
as the gender opposite their natal sex in everyday life, to have socially transitioned by using 
the pronoun associated with their asserted gender in all contexts,1 and be enrolled in the 
study from March 2015 to February 2016 (when the present measurements were included). 
The TYP also includes 2 control groups: siblings of transgender children and age- and 
gender-matched controls. The siblings were recruited through the same methods as the 
transgender group and the matched controls were recruited through a university database of 
families interested in participating in child development research. More details about these 
groups are presented in Supplement 1 (available online).
The present analytic sample included 63 transgender children, 63 age-matched controls, and 
38 siblings 9 to 14 years old who completed the depression and anxiety measurements. Their 
parents also reported on the child’s depression and anxiety symptoms. The analytic sample 
for the self-worth measurement included 116 transgender children, 122 control children, and

 72 siblings 6 to 14 years old, inclusive of most children who completed the mental health 
measurements. Demographics for these groups are presented in Table 1, and detailed 
inclusion information is available in Supplement 1, available online.
Procedure
Whenever possible, parents and children completed the measurements in separate rooms or 
far enough apart in the same room to be out of earshot. For children no older than 11 years, 
the researcher read the questions out loud, and the children could answer out loud or point to 
their response on a scale with response options. Parents and children at least 12 years old 
completed written versions of the measurements privately, with a researcher nearby to 
answer questions if needed. All procedures and recruitment were approved by our 
institutional review board.
Measurements
Internalizing Psychopathology—Children reported on anxiety (α = 0.858) and 
depression (α = 0.859) symptoms using the pediatric short form of the National Institutes of 
Health’s Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scale,38 
and parents completed the proxy versions of the anxiety (parent 1, α = 0.935; parent 2, α = 
0.912) and depression (parent 1, α = 0.880; parent 2, α = 0.892) PROMIS scales.39 Each 
scale consists of items such as “I felt unhappy” or “I felt worried,” and participants indicated 
how often they (or their child) felt that way during the past 7 days, selecting from the 
options “never,” “almost never,” “sometimes,” “often,” or “almost always,” which were 
converted to a Likert-type scale. Participants’ scores across items were summed and then 
converted to a standardized T score. T scores are normed such that a score of 50 represents 
the national average for children, with 10 points representing a standard deviation and a 
score of at least 63 indicating clinically significant anxiety or depression (top 10% of all 
children).
All child-reported data in this study are new and unpublished. However, for comparison, we 
also included parent-reported mental health, which in some cases, for some participants, was 
previously published. Specifically, anxiety and depression scores reported by parents of 21 
transgender participants, 16 siblings, and 18 control participants were reported in a previous 
article24 (although for 10 transgender children, 7 controls, and 7 siblings, the present report 
involves analysis from a more recent visit). All other parent reports are new and 
unpublished.
Of the 63 transgender children who filled out anxiety and depression measurements in the 
present work, 36 children had 2 parents who completed assessments and the remaining 27 
children had 1 parent who completed the assessments. Of the 38 siblings who filled out 
anxiety and depression measurements, 25 children had 2 parents who completed 
assessments and 13 children had 1 parent who completed the assessments. Only 1 parent 
was present for participation with the control children, and therefore only 1 parent 
completed an assessment. For consistency with past work,24 when children had 2 parent 
reporters, the responses of the 2 parents was averaged (in general, the 2 parents’ responses 
were associated: depression, r =0.508, p <.001, n =61; anxiety, r =0.470, p <.001, n =61).

 Analyses for single-parent reporters for all participants are reported in Supplement 1, 
available online; the conclusions are identical.
Self-Worth—Self-worth scores were reported using the Global Self-Worth Subscale from 
the Harter Self-Perception Profile for Children.40 In this subscale, children were presented 
with a description of 2 kinds of children (e.g. “some kids like the kind of person they are 
BUT other kids wish they were different”) and were asked to select which kind of child they 
are most like. Once the children made a selection, they were asked whether this was “sort of 
true” or “really true.” Responses were recoded to a scale from 1 to 4, such that scores of 1 
indicated the lowest self-worth and 4 indicated the highest. Scores were computed by 
averaging the 6 items (α = 0.671). This measurement was administered to children 6 to 14 
years old in the present work.
RESULTS
Internalizing Symptoms
We found no differences in self-reported depressive symptoms across the 3 groups (Table 2 
lists the means; F2,161 = 1.18, p = .311). Similarly, we found no significant, albeit marginal, 
difference in self-reported anxiety symptoms across the 3 study groups (F2,161 = 2.62, p = .
076). Post hoc Tukey tests showed that controls did not differ from the transgender group (p 
= .160) or sibling group (p = .110) and that siblings and transgender participants did not 
differ (p =.905). We also tested whether any of these groups differed significantly from the 
national average (50) on either measurement. For depressive symptoms, the transgender 
group (t62 = 1.07, p = .290) and the sibling group (t37 = 1.63, p = .112) did not differ from 
national averages, whereas the matched-control group showed lower than average depressive 
symptoms (t62 = 3.54, p = .001). For anxiety, the transgender group (t62 = 1.69, p = .096), 
the control group (t62 = 0.99, p = .328), and the sibling group (t37 = 1.67, p = .104) did not 
differ from national averages. Rates of children in the clinical range for depression and 
anxiety (T scores ≥63, which represent the approximately top 10% of scores nationally) in 
each participant group are listed in Table 2. Further analyses of these values can be found in 
Supplement 1, available online.
Parents also reported no differences among groups on depressive symptoms (F2,161 = 0.32, p 
= .728) but did report significant differences on anxiety symptoms (F2,161 = 6.22, p = .002; 
Table 3 lists the means). Post hoc Tukey tests indicated that parents reported higher rates of 
anxiety in transgender participants than in controls (p = .002) and marginally more than in 
siblings (p = .073), although siblings and matched controls did not differ from one another 
(p = .718). We compared these values with the expected national average (T = 50) and found 
no differences from national averages on depression for any group (transgender, t62 = 0.14, p 
= .886; control, t62 = 0.63, p = .530; siblings, t37 = 0.96, p = .345). However, parents 
reported higher than average anxiety for the transgender group (t62 = 4.32, p < .001). Parents 
reported results that did not differ from national averages for the control group (t62 = 0.37, p 
= .714) or sibling group (t37 = 0.74, p = .463). Rates of children in the clinical range for 
depression and anxiety (T scores ≥63) in each participant group as defined by parent

 reporters are listed in Table 3. Further analyses of these scores can be found in Supplement 
1, available online.
Counter to the hypothesis that parents of socially transitioned transgender children are 
underreporting anxiety and depression, parents of transgender children reported greater 
anxiety in their children than the children reported (t62 = 2.11, p = .039), and they did not 
differ from children’s self-reports on depression (t62 = 0.97, p = .338).
Sensitivity Analysis
Because previous work has pointed out that the TYP has a particularly high-income skew,41 
we also computed mean anxiety and depression for the subset of children coming from 
homes with household incomes no higher than $75,000. These means and percentages of 
participants in the clinical range are listed in Tables 2 and 3.
In addition, the present sample included some children who were on hormone blockers, 
some children who were on cross-sex hormones, and some children who were on neither 
intervention. Table 4 lists the mean anxiety and depression scores for children in each of 
these groups as reported by the children and their parents. None of the differences among 
these groups approached significance (p > .500 for all comparisons).
Self-Worth
The age range and sample size were considerably larger for self-worth, allowing us to 
examine not only differences between conditions but also differences by age group. 
Therefore, we ran a condition (transgender, control, sibling) by age (6–8, 9–11, 12–14 years 
old) group between-participants analysis of variance. We found no significant effect of 
condition (F2,300 = 1.96, p = .142), a marginal effect of age group (F2,300 = 2.66, p = .072), 
and no significant interaction (F4,300 = 0.18, p = .949; Table 5 lists the full means). Children 
in all groups reported self-worth that was higher than the midpoint (2.5) of the scale, 
indicating high self-worth overall (transgender, t115 = 19.14, p < .001; controls, t120 = 29.45, 
p < .001; siblings, t71 = 21.44, p < .001).
DISCUSSION
We found remarkably good mental health outcomes in socially transitioned transgender 
children in the present study. Transgender children reported normative rates of depression 
and slightly increased rates of anxiety. Rates of depression in transgender children did not 
differ significantly from those in siblings of transgender children or from those in age- and 
gender-matched controls, although rates of anxiety were marginally higher. Parents’ reports 
of their children’s depression and anxiety largely mirrored the children’s reports, although 
parents of transgender children reported slightly higher anxiety in their children than the 
children did.
These findings are consistent with a previous report from the TYP that relied solely on 
parent reports.24 The previous study found that parents reported normative levels of 
depression and marginally higher rates of anxiety in their transgender children. A key 
concern from the previous work was that parents who allowed their children to socially

 transition might be biased in their reporting of mental health information from a desire to 
believe their children are doing well after allowing them to socially transition. The present 
findings are at odds with this interpretation, because parents reported very similar rates of 
anxiety and depression as did their children and, if anything, reported slightly greater 
anxiety in their children than did the children.
In addition, we found that transgender children did not differ from age- and gender-matched 
controls or siblings in self-worth. Interestingly, all 3 groups of children in this study reported 
higher self-worth than children in other studies of gender-typical children40,42 using the 
same scale.
Our findings of normative levels of depression, slightly higher rates of anxiety, and high 
self-worth in socially transitioned transgender children stand in marked contrast with 
previous work with gender-nonconforming children who had not socially 
transitioned.25,43–45 Those studies overwhelmingly reported markedly higher rates of 
anxiety and depression and lower self-worth, with disproportionate numbers of children in 
the clinical range. However, our ability to compare our findings with past findings is limited 
by differences in the criteria for study inclusion—the children in the present study believed 
they were of the “opposite” gender, whereas previous work focused on more diverse groups 
of gender-nonconforming children, including many who wished to be the “opposite” gender 
or who simply preferred toys and clothing associated with the “opposite” gender.1,46 More 
specifically, past studies focused on children who met criteria for gender identity disorder or 
subclinical manifestations of it, a diagnosis that did not require children to feel they were a 
member of the “opposite” gender. Future work would benefit from comparing children who 
feel that they are members of the “opposite” gender who have socially transitioned with 
children who feel they are members of the “opposite” gender who have not socially 
transitioned and with children who have some degree of gender dysphoria and might wish 
they were—but do not actually feel they are—members of the “opposite” gender. Work with 
children who have non-binary identities (children who identify as “both” or “neither” 
gender) also is sorely needed.
The present findings highlight a key question about whether social transitions per se caused 
the positive mental health outcomes observed in the transgender children in the present 
study. Because the present study did not randomly assign children who believed themselves 
to be members of the opposite gender to social transitions (a process that would be 
unethical), we cannot definitively draw this causal inference. Another potential issue with 
comparing these children with gender-nonconforming children who had not transitioned 
from the existing literature is that there could be systematic differences between children 
who have and those who have not socially transitioned (e.g., the former might have more 
extreme gender dysphoria). Nonetheless, these findings illustrate that there is a group of 
previously gender-nonconforming children who have socially transitioned and who are 
doing quite well. These and other recent findings24,47 are certainly suggestive that these 
transitions during childhood can be associated with positive outcomes, at least initially.
If we interpret these data to suggest that social transitions might be an effective intervention 
for at least some transgender children, how do we explain that social transitions in adulthood

 are not always associated with positive mental health outcomes?16,22,48 One possible answer 
is that social transitions in childhood occur alongside various kinds of social support, which 
are often absent from social transitions in adulthood. Children who socially transition 
invariably have parental support for their identities, without which they would not be able to 
transition. Further, most children who socially transition in childhood have not developed 
secondary sex characteristics and thus are unilaterally perceived as being members of their 
perceived gender upon simply changing their hairstyle and clothing. In contrast, transgender 
adults often face family rejection, discrimination, prejudice, and even violence in their 
everyday lives based on their transgender identities. That socially transitioned transgender 
children have normative mental health could suggest that the psychopathology historically 
found in transgender individuals might be due to society’s rejection of their transgender 
identities and/or years of repressing or denying their gender identity, rather than some 
difficulty intrinsic to identifying as a gender “opposite” one’s natal sex.
We also cannot discount the possibility that the children in the present study are simply 
doing well while they are young but will face greater issues as they mature.9 As this cohort 
of transgender youth enters middle adolescence and adulthood, they could experience levels 
of rejection that they (or most of them) were protected from as children; they could face 
issues with dating and relationships; or they could later come to reject their transgender 
identity, a process that some have suggested could be associated with negative social 
consequences.9,49 In addition, the amount of time since a child’s social transition, which we 
did not examine here, could be an important factor to consider in the mental health and 
adjustment of transgender children. Thus, following these children as they move into the 
teen and adult years will be critical not only to inform best practices on social transitions but 
also to illuminate the time course of mental health benefits (or decrements) of social 
transitions.
As one final note, the children in this study are disproportionately from higher-income 
backgrounds (Table 1), raising concerns about the generalizability of the present work. 
Further, because higher income is generally associated with better mental health outcomes in 
children,50–52 this finding could suggest that socioeconomic status rather than social 
transitions explain the positive outcomes observed in this group. We are skeptical of this 
interpretation because previous work with high-income gender-nonconforming children who 
had not socially transitioned found rates of anxiety and depression that were substantially 
higher.43 That work suggests that income alone does not eliminate mental health concerns in 
gender-nonconforming children. In addition, as presented in Tables 2 and 3, our findings 
with children from lower- and middle-income families suggest some reason to believe these 
findings could extend beyond wealthier families. Even so, until a larger sample of lower-
income children is examined, we must be cautious in generalizing these results.
For the first time, this article reports on socially transitioned transgender children’s mental 
health as reported by the children. Transgender children reported normative rates of 
depression and slightly higher rates of anxiety compared with their gender-typical siblings 
and a matched-control group. Transgender children also reported high self-worth, matching 
the siblings and matched controls. Future work with larger and more diverse samples will be 
especially useful to understand how widespread these positive mental health outcomes are

 among socially transitioned transgender children and whether the low levels of 
psychopathology we observed will persist as these children move into their teen and adult 
years. This study supports other recent findings24 that suggest a very strong identification 
with the gender “opposite” one’s sex at birth is not synonymous with high levels of 
psychopathology53 and provides converging evidence that early family support is associated 
with positive mental health in transgender children.24,47,54

aGender for transgender participants refers to asserted gender, not sex.
bRace difference was assessed as percentage of white versus non-white in χ2 analyses owing to small numbers of each non-white group.
cFor comparison across groups, income was converted to a scale of 1 to 5.
dTransgender and control participants were matched for gender. When samples are unequal, it was because fewer transgender participants 
completed the task because of experimenter error (failing to provide the measurement) or participants’ requests to stop participation.
eAlthough there was a significant difference in mean income, no single group comparison was significant as indicated by Tukey post hoc tests 
(control versus transgender, p = .146; control versus siblings, p = .058; transgender versus controls, p = .793).
