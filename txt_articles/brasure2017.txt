Background: The prevalence of cognitive impairment and de-
mentia is expected to increase dramatically as the population
ages, creating burdens on families and health care systems.
Purpose: To assess the effectiveness of physical activity inter-
ventions in slowing cognitive decline and delaying the onset of
cognitive impairment and dementia in adults without diagnosed
cognitive impairments.
Data Sources: Several electronic databases from January 2009
to July 2017 and bibliographies of systematic reviews.
Study Selection: Trials published in English that lasted 6
months or longer, enrolled adults without clinically diagnosed
cognitive impairments, and compared cognitive and dementia
outcomes between physical activity interventions and inactive
controls.
Data Extraction: Extraction by 1 reviewer and confirmed by a
second; dual-reviewer assessment of risk of bias; consensus de-
termination of strength of evidence.
Data Synthesis: Of 32 eligible trials, 16 with low to moderate
risk of bias compared a physical activity intervention with an in-
active control. Most trials had 6-month follow-up; a few had 1- or
2-year follow-up. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions
about the effectiveness of aerobic training, resistance training, or
tai chi for improving cognition. Low-strength evidence showed
that multicomponent physical activity interventions had no effect
on cognitive function. Low-strength evidence showed that a
multidomain intervention comprising physical activity, diet, and
cognitive training improved several cognitive outcomes. Evi-
dence regarding effects on dementia prevention was insufficient
for all physical activity interventions.
Limitation: Heterogeneous interventions and cognitive test
measures, small and underpowered studies, and inability to as-
sess the clinical significance of cognitive test outcomes.
Conclusion: Evidence that short-term, single-component phys-
ical activity interventions promote cognitive function and prevent
cognitive decline or dementia in older adults is largely insuffi-
cient. A multidomain intervention showed a delay in cognitive
decline (low-strength evidence).

F
orty-seven million people worldwide live with de-
mentia (1), and this number is expected to triple by
2050 (2). Despite evidence that the overall incidence of
dementia has declined in the United States (3, 4), the
number of U.S. adults older than 70 years with demen-
tia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) increases as our
population ages (5, 6). Dementia severely erodes func-
tioning and quality of life, creates burden and stress on
families, and leads to institutionalization. Dementia-
related costs exceed those of heart disease and cancer
and often are paid directly by families (7). Therefore,
preventing dementia is an urgent public health priority.
Many believe that an active lifestyle may prevent
cognitive decline and dementia. Findings of several re-
views, primarily those looking at cohort studies, sug-
gest that physical activity may reduce or delay the
development of potential modifiable risk factors for
cognitive decline, such as obesity, diabetes, and hyper-
tension (8–13). However, the relationships among phys-
ical activity, other risk factors, and cognitive decline are
complex and interrelated. Findings of associations from
cohort studies alone cannot clarify whether physical
activity affects cognitive decline directly, indirectly
through the reduction of medical risk factors, or both.
Previous systematic reviews of randomized controlled
trials report some cognitive benefits of physical activity
interventions, although the certainty and clinical impor-
tance of these findings have not always been clear (14,
15). This systematic review reports a synthesis of the
evidence assessing the effectiveness of physical activity
interventions in slowing cognitive decline and delaying
the onset of cognitive impairment and dementia in
adults without diagnosed cognitive impairments.

 ing secondary prevention in adults with MCI, and an
evaluation of comparative effectiveness.
Data Sources and Searches
We searched bibliographic databases, including
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO via Ovid, as well as
the Cochrane Library, to identify controlled trials pub-
lished in any language from January 2009 through July
2017. (See Part A of the Supplement, available at
Annals.org, for search strategies.) We identified studies
published before 2009 by citation searching relevant
systematic reviews.
Study Selection
Two investigators independently reviewed titles
and abstracts of search results and screened the full
text of potentially eligible references. Disagreements
about eligibility were resolved by consensus. We in-
cluded randomized controlled trials of physical activity
interventions with any sample size and large (n > 500)
prospective quasi-experimental cohort studies with
comparator groups if they enrolled adults without diag-
nosed cognitive impairments, had follow-up of at least
6 months, were published in English, and reported 1 of
our preselected primary or intermediate outcomes. We
excluded trials enrolling pure subgroups of patients
with major medical conditions or conditions that may
explain changes in cognitive function (namely stroke,
Parkinson disease, cancer, and traumatic brain injury).
Our main outcomes of interest were MCI or de-
mentia. Intermediate outcomes included measures of
cognitive function assessed by instruments that tested
cognition across several domains or those that specifi-
cally tested executive function, attention, and process-
ing speed, or memory. Intermediate outcomes were
categorized as follows: broad measures intended to
capture several cognitive domains that were either
brief cognitive tests (category 1) or more comprehen-
sive multidomain neuropsychological tests (category
2) and domain-specific neuropsychological tests or
subscales of broader instruments that assessed execu-
tive function, attention, and processing speed (cate-
gory 3) or memory (category 4). Part B of the Supple-
ment shows a list of the intermediate outcomes
reported from the studies and our categorization of
those outcomes.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
One reviewer extracted the study population, treat-
ment characteristics, and funding source from all eligi-
ble studies. Risk of bias was assessed independently by
2 investigators using an instrument developed with
guidance from the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ) (18). Risk of bias for each reported out-
come was rated as low, medium, or high on the basis of
adequacy of randomization and allocation conceal-
ment, masking, attrition, use of intention-to-treat analy-
ses, selectiveness of outcome reporting, and confi-
dence that results were believable given limitations.
Outcomes and adverse effects were extracted from el-
igible trials with low or moderate risk of bias, and a
second investigator checked the extraction.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
We grouped studies by type of physical activity in-
tervention and analyzed results by direction of effect
and statistical significance. We found it impossible to
assess the clinical significance of findings of the inter-
mediate outcomes across all studies, because many dif-
ferent instruments were used and we did not always
find information on the degree of change in specific
instrument scores or subscores that would indicate clin-
ical importance. (Part B of the Supplement shows the
information we did find about clinically important
changes in specific instrument scores.) In addition, re-
sults were measured, analyzed, and reported in many
different ways.
When sufficient data were available (from more
than 1 study or 1 study with ≥ 500 participants), 1 in-
vestigator assessed the strength of evidence for unique
comparisons.
These
assessments
were
confirmed
through consensus. We assessed strength of evidence
by using 5 required domains: study limitations (risk of
bias of eligible studies for a given comparison), direct-
ness (single, direct link between intervention and out-
come), consistency (similarity of effect direction and
size), precision (degree of certainty around an estimate
that includes attention to small sample sizes with power
to detect only large differences), and reporting bias
(19). On the basis of these factors, the overall strength
of evidence for each outcome from a given intervention
was rated as high, moderate, low, or insufficient.
Role of the Funding Source
This review was funded by the National Institute on
Aging and AHRQ. These agencies and members of the
National Academies Committee on Preventing Demen-
tia and Cognitive Impairment helped refine the scope
and reviewed a draft report of findings. The authors are
solely responsible for the content preparation, writing
of the manuscript, and decision to submit the manu-
script for publication.
RESULTS
Of 32 eligible studies that compared interventions
using physical activity components with an inactive con-
trol in adults without a cognitive impairment diagnosis
(20–51), 16—all of which were randomized trials—were
considered to have low to medium risk of bias (20, 23,
25, 29, 30, 33, 35–37, 39, 40, 43, 45, 46, 48, 50). Inac-
tive controls in the trials with low to medium risk of bias
included waitlist, usual care, no-intervention, and atten-
tion (that is, education and information) groups. Most
trials were government funded. Most studies enrolled
older adults; some limited enrollment to men or
women. Total sample sizes ranged from 42 to 1635
participants. Trials rarely reported adverse effects;
those that did showed no differences between groups,
with 1 exception. Intervention components, frequency,
and duration varied. (Part C of the Supplement con-
tains the literature flow diagram; part D contains evi-
dence tables.)

 The Table shows overall conclusions and strength-
of-evidence ratings. Details of studies considered to
have low to medium risk of bias are described later. For
any cognitive outcome, evidence was insufficient to
draw conclusions about most interventions (aerobic
training, resistance training, tai chi, physical activity with
diet, and physical activity with a cognitive component).
Low-strength evidence showed that multicomponent
physical activity interventions of 1 to 2 years did not
improve multidomain neurologic performance; execu-
tive function, attention, and processing speed; or mem-
ory compared with an attention control. Low-strength
evidence showed that an intervention combining phys-
ical activity, diet, and cognitive training benefited mul-
tidomain neuropsychological test performance and
executive function, attention, and processing speed
compared with an attention control; however, evidence
was insufficient to draw conclusions about the efficacy
of this intervention on memory. Moderate-strength ev-
idence showed that more participants in the interven-
tion than the control groups had musculoskeletal pain.
Physical Activity Interventions
Multicomponent Physical Activity
Four trials (n = 1885) with low to medium risk of
bias examined multicomponent physical activity inter-
ventions. Components included flexibility, strength,
balance, endurance, and aerobic training (36, 45, 46,
50). Enrollment criteria varied by trial. Sink and col-
leagues (45) and Williamson and colleagues (50) en-
rolled sedentary adults older than 70 years, most of
whom were white women. Mean Modified Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE) scores were higher than 90
points (on a scale of 0 to 100 points). Taylor-Piliae and
colleagues (46) enrolled adults, mostly white college-
educated women, older than 60 years. Napoli and col-
leagues (36) enrolled frail, obese older adults, most of
whom were white women; mean Modified MMSE score
was 96 points. Interventions during the trials lasted
from 6 months to 2 years.
Sink and colleagues (45) (n = 1635) reported diag-
nostic outcomes that showed no difference in the inci-
dence of MCI (odds ratio, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.62]) or
dementia (odds ratio, 0.96 [CI, 0.57 to 1.63]) between
groups at 2 years. A wide range of neuropsychological
tests were used to assess intermediate outcomes
across the 4 trials. Only 3 of 25 comparisons showed a
statistically significant benefit with multicomponent
physical activity interventions compared with the atten-
tion controls.
Aerobic Activity
Six trials (n = 531) with low to medium risk of bias
compared aerobic training with an attention control
(20, 30, 35, 39, 40, 43). Four studies enrolled healthy
older adults (35, 39, 40, 43), whereas 1 trial enrolled
sedentary older men (20) and another enrolled adults
with MMSE scores of at least 24 points (on a scale of 0
to 30 points) who also reported memory challenges
(30).
Lautenschlager and colleagues (30) (n = 170) re-
ported dementia diagnoses and showed that partici-
pants assigned to aerobic training were less likely to
receive a dementia diagnosis than those assigned to
the attention control group at 18-month follow-up
(change from baseline at 18 months in Clinical Demen-
tia Rating Sum of Boxes scores: �0.33 [CI, �0.46 to
�0.2] vs. �0.20 [CI, �0.33 to �0.03] point; P = 0.050).
Eleven of 35 reported results for intermediate out-
comes from the 6 trials showed a statistically significant
benefit with aerobic training compared with an atten-
tion control, whereas 24 of 35 showed no statistically
significant differences between groups.
Resistance Training
Three trials (n = 315) examined the effectiveness of
resistance training in preventing cognitive decline (23,
29, 48). Studies enrolled prefrail and frail adults older
than 65 years (48), sedentary men aged 65 to 75 years
with a minimum MMSE score of 24 points (23), and
sedentary older adults with at least 1 disability (29).
Mean age of participants was in the early 70s. In an
analysis of combined data from 2 separate trials, van de
Rest and colleagues (48) compared supervised resis-
tance training twice weekly with usual care. Both trials
randomly assigned participants to receive protein sup-
plements or placebo; 1 trial also incorporated resis-
tance training. Both trials lasted for 24 weeks. Cassilhas
and colleagues (23) randomly assigned participants to
1 of 3 groups: attention control, high-resistance train-
ing, and low-resistance training. Lachman and col-
leagues (29) randomly assigned participants to the
Strong for Life program (home-based, video-directed
resistance training) or a waitlist control group.
No trial reported diagnostic outcomes. Less than
one third of the results for executive function, attention,
and processing speed (32%) and for memory (27%) fa-
vored the intervention. Most positive results arose from
1 small 3-group trial (23).
Tai Chi
One small trial (n = 93) with moderate risk of bias
compared tai chi with an attention control in adults
aged 60 to 79 years with education-adjusted Chinese
MMSE scores higher than 26 points (46). Diagnostic
outcomes and adverse events were not reported. One
of 2 outcomes for executive function, attention, and
processing speed showed a benefit with tai chi com-
pared with the attention control, whereas the other did
not.
Physical Activity Combined With Other
Interventions
Physical Activity and Diet
Two trials (n = 79) compared interventions combin-
ing physical activity and diet with attention controls (33,
36). Both studies enrolled overweight or obese adults.
Napoli and colleagues (36) randomly assigned obese,
sedentary adults with a minimum MMSE score of 24
points to a calorie-restricted diet plus multicomponent

 exercise for 90 minutes, 3 times weekly, for 1 year. Mar-
tin and colleagues (33) randomly assigned overweight
adults aged 25 to 50 years to a calorie-restricted diet
plus group aerobic training for 6 months. Neither trial
reported diagnostic outcomes. Only 2 of the 22 cogni-
tive tests reported showed a benefit with combined
physical activity plus diet versus the attention controls.
Physical Activity and Protein Supplementation
In an analysis of combined data from 2 separate
trials, van de Rest and colleagues (48) compared phys-
ical activity and protein supplementation with usual
care (n = 58). The original trials did not report out-
comes pertinent to our review (52, 53). Both trials ran-
domly assigned participants to receive protein supple-
ments or placebo; 1 trial also incorporated resistance
training. In both trials, the interventions lasted 24
weeks. Participants were older than 65 years and pre-
frail or frail according to measures of physical function.
Trial inclusion criteria did not specifically address cog-
nitive status; mean MMSE scores at baseline were
higher than 27 points (52, 53).
One of 11 tests of executive function, attention,
and processing speed and none of 6 memory tests
showed a statistically significant difference favoring
physical activity and protein supplementation after the
intervention.
Physical Activity Plus Cognitive Training
Hars and colleagues (25) (n = 134) compared phys-
ical activity plus cognitive training with a waitlist control.
Adults aged 65 years and older with an increased fall
risk were randomly assigned to a structured, music-
based exercise program or a waitlist group (25). The
intervention consisted of 6 months of weekly 60-minute
multitasking exercise classes during which participants
followed instructions for pattern changes according to
cues in the music as the cognitive training component.
Diagnostic outcomes were not reported. Brief cog-
nitive test performance was not statistically different be-
tween groups after the intervention. Results from 1 of 2
tests of executive function, attention, and processing
speed showed a postintervention difference between
groups favoring the intervention, whereas the other
test did not.
Physical Activity, Diet, and Cognitive Training
In the FINGER (Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study
to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability) trial,
Ngandu and colleagues (37) (n = 1260) compared
an intervention program comprising components ad-
dressing several risk factors simultaneously with an at-
tention control. Adults aged 60 to 77 years with CAIDE
(Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia) de-
mentia risk scores of at least 6 points and cognition
near or slightly below that expected for age were ran-
domly assigned to receive nutritional counseling, mul-
ticomponent exercise, and cognitive training or an
attention control (general health advice). The interven-
tion involved individual and group sessions to foster
tailored dietary changes, 1 to 3 aerobic exercise and 2
to 5 resistance training sessions per week, and group
and
individual
cognitive
training.
Intention-to-treat
analysis at 2 years included 1190 participants (94% of
those randomly assigned).
Diagnostic outcomes were not reported. Improve-
ment in multidomain neuropsychological test perfor-
mance was 25% greater with the intervention versus the
control at 2 years. The mean change in 2 measures of
executive function, attention, and processing speed
also was greater with the intervention versus the con-

measure and 150% higher with the other. No statisti-
cally significant difference was observed between the
changes in memory outcomes. Several adverse events
were reported, including musculoskeletal pain, stress,
challenges related to time commitment, death, and
“other.” However, only musculoskeletal pain affected as
many as 5% of the participants in either group. Results
showed a difference between groups, with participants
receiving the intervention reporting a significantly
higher rate of pain (5%) than those in the control group
(0%).
DISCUSSION
This systematic review found that evidence for the
effectiveness of single-component physical activity in-
terventions in preventing cognitive decline is largely in-
sufficient. The only exception is low-strength evidence
of no effect for multicomponent physical activity in pre-
venting cognitive decline. The intervention with suffi-
cient evidence of benefit on cognitive function com-
prised physical activity, diet, and cognitive training,
addressing several risk factors simultaneously.
Although our results predominantly showed no
cognitive benefit from interventions comprised solely
of physical activity, several cognitive results favored
physical activity over controls for aerobic training, resis-
tance training, and multicomponent physical activity in-
terventions. We believe that those findings provide a
signal that physical activity offers cognitive benefit but
that the studies conducted were not long enough or
sufficiently powered to show the true long-term effect
of a physically active lifestyle, which many cohort stud-
ies suggest is beneficial. To be effective, regular phys-
ical activity may need to begin earlier in life and be
sustained as a lifestyle. Short-term interventions begun
after decades of high-risk behavior likely are insufficient
to reduce dementia incidence.
Physical activity may slow cognitive decline directly
through increased blood flow or indirectly by reducing
other risk factors (namely, cardiovascular disease, obe-
sity, and diabetes). The cognitive benefits demon-
strated in the FINGER trial are intriguing. Because the
intervention included components addressing several
risk factors, isolating the benefits attributable to the
physical activity component was not possible. However,
given the complex relationship between identified and
interrelated risk and factors that protect against cogni-
tive decline and dementia, interventions addressing
many risk factors at once might offer the best approach
to successful prevention, especially if initiated in older
adults already at higher risk for MCI and dementia. Al-
though evidence of effectiveness was low strength,
harms were not serious, and benefits from physical ac-
tivity, diet, and cognitive training for other health con-
ditions and functioning are more firmly established.
Therefore, clinical approaches to incorporate similar in-
terventions likely are warranted.
Our results are consistent with those of previous
systematic reviews identified in our searches (8–15).
However, our analysis and conclusions may not be as
optimistic as others. This difference seems largely to be
the result of interpretation. We saw many results with
no statistically significant differences compared with in-
active controls. That minority of statistically significant
results often was interpreted as evidence of effective-
ness in other reviews. Our review also had stricter inclu-
sion criteria, requiring a minimum follow-up of 6
months, so many other reviews included studies not
eligible for this one.
Our review has several limitations. Most trials were
small and did not follow participants long term. The
type, frequency, intensity, and duration of physical ac-
tivity interventions varied widely. Most trials enrolled
sedentary adults, yet how sedentary status was defined
or measured was not always clear. Trials used many
different cognitive tests and often repeated tests more
frequently than appropriate. Many studies measured
cognitive outcomes with various instruments and did
not correct for multiple comparisons. Ideally, our anal-
ysis would assess effect size and the point at which in-
terventions demonstrated a statistically significant ef-
fect. However, because many studies did not use
instruments with demonstrated clinical thresholds or
provide sufficient information to calculate standard ef-
fect sizes, we relied on statistical significance. Often
when results showed no significant differences, it was
unclear whether the insignificance was the result of a
lack of effectiveness or of underpowered studies. In
these cases, the imprecision of the estimates led us to
assess the evidence as insufficient. Checks for treat-
ment fidelity rarely were mentioned, and participant
adherence was not always reported. In addition, the
question of publication bias was challenging to assess
for this topic. Trials of physical activity interventions of-
ten measured cognitive outcomes as secondary to oth-
ers, such as cardiovascular disease outcomes. Studies
of physical activity interventions, especially older trials,
are not consistently registered. We did not identify un-
published trials at ClinicalTrials.gov potentially eligible
for this review.
Future research should seek to identify population
traits (such as age at which physical activity began, in-
tervention duration, and baseline activity level) and
intervention characteristics (such as type, frequency,
duration, and intensity) that trend toward positive out-
comes among these trials. Studies then could be de-
signed appropriately to test identified characteristics
for research and knowledge purposes. Long-term trials
enrolling younger adults with interventions sustained
for longer periods would benefit the field and provide
important insight on prevention. On the basis of the
evidence from this review, it seems that preventing
cognitive decline in older adults may be best accom-
plished by addressing several lifestyle risk factors si-
multaneously, as demonstrated in the FINGER trial.
Although a physically active lifestyle often is pro-
posed as a way to prevent cognitive decline and re-
