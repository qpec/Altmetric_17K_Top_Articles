Abstract
Background: The World Trade Center attack of September 11, 2001 in New York City (9/11) exposed thousands of
people to intense concentrations of hazardous materials that have resulted in reports of increased levels of asthma,
heart disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases along with psychological illnesses such as post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD). Few studies have discriminated between health consequences of immediate (short-term or acute)
intense exposures versus chronic residential or workplace exposures.
Methods: We used proportional hazards methods to determine adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) for associations
between several components of acute exposures (e.g., injury, immersion in the dust cloud) and four chronic disease
outcomes: asthma, other non-neoplastic lung diseases, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, in 8701 persons free of
those conditions prior to exposure and who were physically present during or immediately after the World Trade
Center attacks. Participants were followed prospectively up to 11 years post-9/11.
Results: Heart disease exhibited a dose-response association with sustaining injury (1 injury type: AHR =2.0, 95% CI
(Confidence Interval) 1.1–3.6; 2 injury types: AHR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.2–7.9; 3 or more injury types: AHR = 6.8, 95% CI 2.0–22.6),
while asthma and other lung diseases were both significantly associated with dust cloud exposure (AHR = 1.3,
95% CI 1.0–1.6). Diabetes was not associated with any of the predictors assessed in this study.
Conclusion: In this study we demonstrated that the acute exposures of injury and dust cloud that were sustained on
9/11/2001 had significant associations with later heart and respiratory diseases. Continued monitoring of 9/11 exposed
persons’ health by medical providers is warranted for the foreseeable future.

Background
The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC)
in New York City on September 11, 2001 (9/11) left
nearly 3000 people dead and many thousands injured.
The collapse of the towers created a massive dust and
debris cloud which enveloped many survivors and ultim-
ately led to the development of a variety of physical and
mental diseases (Brackbill et al. 2006; Brackbill et al.
2009; Farfel et al. 2008; Perlman et al. 2011). The most
heavily exposed groups included occupants of buildings,
passersby, residents of lower Manhattan, and early
responding rescue/recovery workers. These groups were
exposed to numerous toxic components of the dust and
debris cloud including fine particulate matter, caustic
dusts, volatile organic compounds, and heavy metals, as
well as combustion products of the fires that followed the
initial impact (Landrigan et al. 2004). Many individuals
also sustained injuries, as well as traumatic experiences
such as witnessing planes hit the building, people falling
or jumping from buildings, and seeing people injured or
killed (Brackbill et al. 2006).

 Multiple studies have found elevated rates of asthma,
other lung conditions, and post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) among rescue/recovery workers, especially early
responders, residents of lower Manhattan, and other
people who were in the vicinity, persisting to at least
6 years post-disaster (Banauch et al. 2006; Brackbill et al.
2006; Brackbill et al. 2009; Lin et al. 2007). Physical
health outcomes that have been linked to exposures on
the morning of 9/11 include asthma and other respira-
tory illnesses (Brackbill et al. 2009), heart disease (Jordan
et al. 2011), and potentially diabetes (Miller-Archie et al.
2014). Numerous studies have found 9/11 trauma to be
associated with subsequent development of PTSD, often
comorbid with respiratory disease (Friedman et al.
2013), with the risk for 9/11 related asthma and heart
disease greater in those with PTSD (Brackbill et al. 2014;
Jordan et al. 2011).
In this study we focus on physical trauma that oc-
curred on the morning of 9/11/2001 during or as an im-
mediate result of the attacks, often in association with
the extreme environmental pollution engendered by the
dust/debris cloud created during the collapse of the
towers and other buildings. The maximum concentra-
tion of particulate matter within the dust/debris cloud
on 9/11 has been estimated to be 100,000 μm per cubic
meter of particles (Lioy and Georgopoulos 2006). Poten-
tial for such acute exposure to individuals lasted about 5
to 6 hours after the plane attacks as the cloud was
quickly advected into the lower atmosphere by the heat
of the fires and moved southeasterly over Brooklyn,
eventually dispersing over the ocean. It is estimated that
90% of the total amount of environmental material
resulting from fires and three building collapses (WTC
1, 2, and 7) was released and present on 9/11. Indoor
chronic exposures occurring in the months following 9/
11 have also not been well quantified, but contamination
of office buildings and residences by dust and fire products
have been qualitatively reported as substantial (Lioy and
Georgopoulos 2006). One group of individuals who dir-
ectly experienced acute as distinct from chronic exposures
on 9/11 were people in the vicinity of the buildings at the
time of the attacks either as passersby or occupants of the
towers and surrounding buildings. It is to be noted that
shortly after the collapse of the buildings the entire area
of Lower Manhattan up to 14th Street was ordered evacu-
ated except for rescue and recovery personnel; this so-
called restricted zone encompassed most of downtown
Manhattan until the end of September, 2001, limiting the
number of persons potentially exposed to either outdoor
or indoor chronic exposure for a month after the event.
Few studies have examined single exposure-disease as-
sociations (e.g., dust cloud and asthma, injury and heart
disease) limited to persons who were primarily exposed
on 9/11/2001 (Brackbill et al. 2006; Brackbill et al. 2014).
For instance, Brackbill (2006) examined the prevalence
of respiratory symptoms among persons who had been
an evacuee of a collapsed building and caught in resultant
dust debris cloud, and they also (2014) examined associa-
tions between sustaining an injury and/or being enveloped
in the intense dust cloud with heart and respiratory dis-
ease among persons who were south of Chambers Street
on 9/11/2001. The present study extends knowledge of
the effects of the 9/11 attacks by investigating the associ-
ation between acute exposure to 9/11 and chronic disease
10–11 years post event, employing methods appropriate
to the longitudinal nature of the data.
In the present study, we estimate the relative hazard of
reporting diagnosed angina or heart attack, diabetes,
asthma or other lung conditions in the WTC Health
Registry cohort up to 11 years after the event. We fo-
cused on Registry enrollees who experienced acute, dir-
ect exposure to dust/debris cloud from the collapse of
buildings or traumatic injury on the morning of 9/11/
2001. We did not include in the study sample residents
who returned to live in downtown Manhattan after 9/11
or rescue/recovery workers who worked at the site after
9/11. We hypothesized that for this narrowly defined co-
hort, injury would be associated with heart conditions,
and dust/debris cloud with respiratory conditions, with
no expected association of acute 9/11 exposures with
diabetes.
Methods
The WTC Health Registry monitors the physical and
mental health of 71,431 persons exposed to the WTC
attacks on September 11, 2001 (Farfel et al. 2008).
Enrollees were recruited from lists of potentially ex-
posed persons provided by employers and businesses
(list-identified), as well as from media outreach and a
toll-free number (self-identified). Rescue/recovery workers,
residents of lower Manhattan, area workers, passersby
on the streets or subway, and students or staff of neigh-
borhood schools were eligible for inclusion. These groups
were defined so as to be mutually exclusive. The Registry
conducted health surveys among enrollees in 2003–2004
(wave 1), 2006–2007 (wave 2), and 2011–2012 (wave 3).
For wave 1, most participants (95%) were interviewed
using computer-assisted telephone interview, and the
rest were interviewed in person (5%). For waves 2 and
3, enrollees self-administered their interviews via inter-
net or mail or were interviewed by phone. The methods
of the Registry have been described in detail in previous
publications (Brackbill et al. 2009; Farfel et al. 2008).
The Registry was approved by the institutional review
boards of the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion and the New York City Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene.

 Study sample
People south of Chambers Street in lower Manhattan on
September 11, 2001 were most likely to have been in-
jured or immersed in the dust cloud from the collapse of
the buildings. We defined acute exposures as being
present near the disaster site (i.e., south of Chambers
Street) on 9/11, but not afterwards, to differentiate acute
from chronic exposures. We limited our study sample to
enrollees who had completed all three Registry survey
waves in order to maximize follow-up time and to cap-
ture relevant exposure variables. Our definition of acute
exposure resulted in different exclusion rules for the
four eligibility groups. Rescue/recovery workers who
worked at the WTC site after the first day of the disaster
(n = 2917) and residents who did not evacuate or evacu-
ated but returned to their homes before December 31,
2001 (n = 1508) were excluded. For area workers whose
normal workplaces were in the defined acute exposure
zone and who were at work on 9/11, we retained those
who indicated they returned to work after 9/11, so that
we could compare the association of acute exposures on
9/11 with health outcomes for a similar population who
may have had more chronic exposures from returning to
the area. There was no exclusion for passersby on 9/11
because presumably this group was exposed to 9/11 on
the disaster day only.
Adults older than 64 years on 9/11 (n = 244) were ex-
cluded because it would be considerably more difficult
to distinguish effects of 9/11 exposure on chronic dis-
ease from those associated with age. Finally, to focus on
post-9/11 incidence of chronic diseases, we excluded
persons who reported having been diagnosed by a health
professional with any of the following physical health
conditions before 2002: heart attack, angina, other heart
conditions, asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, react-
ive airway disease, other lung conditions, stroke, diabetes,
sarcoidosis, or cancer (n = 10,796). The resulting study
sample included 8701 individuals, consisting of 7503 area
workers; 249 rescue/recovery workers; 131 residents; and
818 passersby.
Study variables
Socio-demographic characteristics of study sample, such
as gender, age (age on 9/11/2001), race/ethnicity, and
education, were included in the analytical models. Study
recruitment source, indicating whether Registry enrollees
were self-enrolled or recruited through lists provided by
employers or businesses, was also controlled as a potential
source of selection bias. Risk factors for chronic diseases
included hypertension, smoking, probable PTSD at Wave
1, and body mass index (BMI). Hypertension was defined
as answering “yes” to the question “Have you ever been
told by a doctor or other health professional that you had
hypertension or high blood pressure?” at either wave 1 or
wave 2. Smoking status was classified as “current”,
“former”, or “never”, and was derived from “ever smoke”
and “smoke now” questions from the wave 1 and wave 2
surveys. BMI was calculated from height and weight,
which were reported by enrollees at wave 3 only. BMI was
categorized as underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight
(18.5- < 25 kg/m2), overweight (25- < 30 kg/m2), and obese
(≥30 kg/m2), as per Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention guidelines. Since a small fraction of the study sam-
ple was underweight (<1%), there would be insufficient
statistical power to investigate this stratum, so these enrol-
lees were excluded from analysis.
Acute 9/11 exposure in this study was measured by
two variables: number of injury types and dust cloud ex-
posure. Similar to an earlier Registry study (Brackbill et
al. 2014), number of types of injuries was defined by
whether respondents reported at wave 1 sustaining any
of the following types of injury on 9/11: cut, abrasion or
puncture wound, sprain or strain, burn, broken bone or
dislocation, and concussion or head injury. The part of the
body affected was not recorded; therefore the number of
injury types is simply the number of types the respondent
reported, classified as 0, 1, 2, or 3 or more injury types.
Acute dust cloud exposure on 9/11 was based on
questions from the wave 1 and wave 2 surveys and was
classified as intense versus some or none. Intense expos-
ure was defined as having been in the dust cloud on 9/11
and reporting at least one of five experiences: being unable
to see more than a few feet; having difficulty walking or
finding one’s way; trouble finding shelter; being covered
with dust; or not being able to hear. The “some or none”
category consisted of those who had reported being in the
dust/debris cloud at wave 1 but who did not experience
intense exposure or reported no dust cloud exposure at
all. We addressed discrepancies between wave 1 and wave
2 on dust cloud reporting by categorizing persons who
said they were not in dust cloud on wave 1 as “none”, re-
gardless of how they answered dust cloud questions on
wave 2. If they were affirmative for dust cloud or missing
on wave 1, we applied the information they reported on
wave 2. Because arriving on 9/11 as a rescue/recovery
worker is an established risk factor for a number of health
outcomes, particularly lung problems (Brackbill et al.
2009; Prezant et al. 2002), we included being a rescue/re-
covery vs. not being a rescue/recovery worker variables in
the models to account for previously reported increased
risk for this group.
Probable PTSD was assessed at wave 1 using the PTSD
Checklist-Specific (PCL-S), a 17-item self-reported symp-
tom scale which referred specifically to the events of
September 11. The 17 items correspond to Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)
PTSD symptoms [DSM-IV 1994]. In this scale enrollees
rate the degree to which they were bothered by symptoms
Alper et al. Injury Epidemiology  (2017) 4:17 
Page 3 of 10
 in the past 30 days (1 = not at all, to 5 = extremely). Re-
sponses to the 17 items are summed, giving a possible
total score of 17 to 85. Probable PTSD (herein referred to
simply as PTSD) was defined as a PCL score ≥ 44. The
PCL-S is a well-validated measure and has good temporal
stability, internal consistency (>0.75), test-retest reliability
(0.66), and high convergent validity (0.58–0.93) (Wilkins
et al. 2011), with overall diagnostic efficiency = 0.90, sensi-
tivity = 0.94, and specificity = 0.86 (Blanchard et al. 1996).
Four distinct chronic disease endpoints were studied:
angina/heart attack, asthma, non-neoplastic lung diseases
other than asthma, and diabetes as reported at waves 2 or
3. All disease endpoints were by self-report. The wave 2
and wave 3 follow-up questionnaires each contained a
checklist of medical conditions headed by the question
“Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health pro-
fessional that you had any of these conditions?” Respon-
dents also reported year of diagnosis. The diagnosis year
of a heart condition at either wave was taken as the earlier
of the years reported for angina and heart attack. Due to
differences in questionnaire wording non-neoplastic lung
disease was defined at wave 2 by self-report of chronic
bronchitis, emphysema, or “other lung conditions,” and at
wave 3 by self-report of chronic bronchitis, emphysema,
or pulmonary fibrosis. The time of onset for non-
neoplastic lung disease at either wave was defined to be
the earliest date reported for any of the lung diseases.
Statistical analysis
For each chronic disease endpoint, the time to event and
censoring status were determined by the following algo-
rithm. Person time began on the date of enrollment
(2003–2004) into the Registry. If the enrollee reported a
single chronic disease, this was considered the endpoint,
and the event was treated as uncensored. If the enrollee
experienced multiple chronic diseases, the first was con-
sidered the endpoint. Cancer incidence has been re-
ported twice previously in this cohort (Li et al. 2012; Li
et al. 2016) and was therefore treated as a censoring
event but not an endpoint of interest; i.e. if cancer oc-
curred before any other disease, the year of diagnosis was
the censoring date. Occurrence of cancer was determined
via linkage to the cancer registries of New York, New
Jersey, Connecticut, and eight other states that together
account for at least 95% of all new cancer cases in the
Registry (Li et al. 2012). If the enrollee did not experience
any of the foregoing chronic diseases, follow-up was ter-
minated at the date of completion of the wave 3 survey.
Enrollees reported only the year of chronic disease diagno-
sis; therefore, the date of chronic disease diagnosis was set
to June 30th of the year of disease report, if different from
year of enrollment in the Registry. If year of disease diag-
nosis occurred in the year of enrollment, the date was set
to December 31st of that year.
Cox proportional hazards regression methods were
employed to investigate the association between number
of injury types, dust/debris cloud exposure, being a rescue/
recovery worker, and having probable PTSD at wave 1, with
chronic disease, adjusting for potential confounders that in-
cluded gender, age, race/ethnicity, education, BMI, and
study recruitment source (list vs. self-identified). PTSD at
wave 1 was included as a risk factor in the multivariable
model because it has been shown to be a contributing
risk factor to the outcomes of interest in this study in-
cluding heart disease (Jordan et al. 2011) and lung
problems (Friedman et al. 2016). Multivariable analyses
also included smoking status (current/former/never), and
ever reporting hypertension. Separate regressions were
performed for each of the four endpoints: angina/heart
attack, asthma, other non-neoplastic lung diseases, and
diabetes. Possible dose-response relationships were stud-
ied using number of injury types as a predictor variable.
We conducted a separate regression analysis among
area workers who did and who did not return to their
lower Manhattan workplaces between September 12 and
December 31, 2001. A similar regression analysis was
also run for passersby alone. Due to small numbers, res-
cue/recovery workers and residents were not analyzed
separately.
The proportional hazards assumption was tested for
the number of injury types, dust cloud exposure, and
rescue/recovery worker status by creating interaction
terms between each of these variables and log (time to
event), and testing the statistical significance of these in-
teractions, separately for each chronic disease endpoint.
Statistical tests were considered significant if the asso-
ciated p-value was less than 0.05. All analyses were per-
formed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North
Carolina).
Results
A total of 8701 enrollees met the inclusion criteria; they
comprise 12.8% of all adult Registry enrollees. Character-
istics of the study sample are shown in Table 1. Partici-
pants were mostly male (51%), aged 25–44 at 9/11
(56%), non-Hispanic white (69%), and college-educated
or more (67%). The majority (82%) were recruited into
the Registry via self- rather than list-enrollment. BMI
was distributed as normal weight (32%), overweight
(40%), and obese (28%). One-tenth of the participants
were current smokers (10%), while 26% reported a his-
tory of high blood pressure; 41% had intense exposure
to the dust cloud. The majority of the sample (87%) ex-
perienced no injuries, while 10% had a single injury, 2%
had two injuries, and 1% experienced 3 or more injuries
on 9/11. Symptoms indicative of probable PTSD at wave
1 were reported by 14% of the sample. The majority of
the study population was area workers (86%); another

 9% were passersby. A total of 92 incident cases of heart
disease were reported during the follow-up period, as
well as 327 new cases of diabetes, 308 of asthma, and
297 of other non-neoplastic lung diseases.
The results of the Cox Proportional Hazards regres-
sions are presented in Tables 2 and 3. The proportional
hazards assumption was satisfied for all the exposures
used in the models.
Angina/heart attack
Angina/Heart Attack was significantly associated with
the number of injury types: for 1 injury the adjusted
hazard ratio (AHR) = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI)
1.1–3.6; for 2 injuries, AHR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.2–7.9; for 3
or more injuries AHR = 6.8, 95% CI 2.0–22.6. The associ-
ation demonstrated a significant dose-response relation-
ship (p < 0.0001). Current cigarette smoking was not a
significant predictor, but the prevalence of current smok-
ing in the study population is less than 10% so the number
of new cases among smokers was very small. Being a
former smoker was significantly associated with angina/
heart attack (AHR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0–2.6). Angina/heart at-
tack was also significantly related to high blood pressure
at either wave 1 or wave 2 (AHR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.3–3.2).
Diabetes
Diabetes did not exhibit a statistically significant associ-
ation with either injury or dust cloud exposure, nor with
PTSD at wave 1. Diabetes had a statistically significant
dose-response relationship with BMI (overweight: AHR =
1.7, 95% CI 1.2–2.4; obese: AHR = 3.5, 95% CI 2.5–4.9)
(dose response p < 0.0001). Diabetes was significantly re-
lated to high blood pressure reported at either wave 1 or
wave 2 (AHR = 2.6, 95% CI 2.0–3.2).

 Asthma
Asthma was related to dust cloud exposure (AHR = 1.3,
95% CI 1.0–1.6), and demonstrated a dose-response rela-
tionship with BMI (overweight: AHR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.8–1.5,
obese: AHR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–2.0) that was not statistically
significant.
Non-neoplastic lung diseases
Non-neoplastic lung diseases were significantly associated
with dust cloud exposure (AHR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.6),
but not with injury. Non-Neoplastic lung diseases were
also associated with PTSD (AHR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–2.0),
and with rescue/recovery worker status (AHR = 1.8,
95% CI 1.0–3.1), and current smoking (AHR = 2.1, 95%
CI 1.5–2.9).
Area workers and passersby
Sufficient numbers of area workers were available to per-
mit comparison of exposure-outcome relationships be-
tween those who eventually returned to their workplaces
with those who did not. Results are shown in Table 3.
For area workers who returned to a workplace south of
Chambers Street between September 12 and December
31, 2001, angina/heart attack was significantly associated
with 3 or more injury types (AHR = 18.3, 95% CI 4.1–
82.2), and the overall injury-angina/heart attack associ-
ation exhibited a dose response relationship (p = 0.0003).
Asthma exhibited a significant association with 1 injury
type (AHR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.6).
For area workers who did not return to work south of
Chambers Street, angina/heart attack was associated
with 3 or more injuries, but not significantly (possibly

0.98–83.5), while the overall injury-angina/heart attack
association did not exhibit a dose response relationship
(p = 0.066). Asthma was significantly associated with
dust cloud exposure (AHR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.2–3.3).
Table 3 also shows exposure disease relationships for
passersby. Among this group angina/heart attack was
significantly associated with 1 injury type only (AHR =
8.1, 95% CI 2.0–33.0) while the risk of asthma for those
with 1 injury type was nearly two-fold, although not sig-
nificant (AHR = 1.8, 95% CI 0.5–6.2); however the total
number of asthma diagnoses was small (n = 26).
Discussion
The present study is a unique opportunity to investigate
the long-term health consequences of a very short-term
exposure, an opportunity that is not typically available
after events such as 9/11. We observed increased risk of
several chronic diseases in persons with predominantly
acute exposure to specific hazards related to the 9/11 at-
tacks. In particular, 9/11 related injuries were strongly
predictive of angina/heart attack, while intense environ-
mental dust cloud exposure on 9/11 and 9/11-related
PTSD were predictive of non-neoplastic lung diseases.
In this group of initially relatively healthy persons who
were south of Chambers Street on 9/11/2001, we found
a significant dose-response association between number
of injury types and angina/heart disease, but not with
asthma, other non-neoplastic lung diseases, or diabetes.
Dust/debris cloud exposure was associated with asthma
and other non-neoplastic lung diseases but not angina/
heart disease. Using generally accepted estimates of the
potentially exposed population, our data suggest that ap-
proximately 51,000 people (of 300,000 people below
Chambers St. on 9/11/2001 (Murphy et al. 2007)) could
develop a chronic disease up to 11 years after the 9/11
attacks.
The present analysis extends previous Registry findings
regarding injury and heart disease. Using follow-up data
through 2007 (i.e., six years after the attacks), Jordan
(Jordan et al. 2011) found an increased risk of heart dis-
ease among adult enrollees, both male and female, for in-
jury sustained on 9/11 (AHRs 1.33 and 1.46, respectively),
while Brackbill et al. (Brackbill et al. 2014) showed a dose-
response relationship (e.g., adjusted odds ratio = 2.2 with 1
injury and 3.3 with 2 injuries for heart disease [angina,
heart attack, and other heart disease]) between number of
types of injuries and heart disease for enrollees aged 18
and older who were south of Chambers St. on 9/11. In the
present study, the magnitude of the risk estimate of heart
attack or angina up to 11 years post-9/11 was greater with
an AHR = 6.8 for 3 injuries sustained on 9/11/2001 for a
subgroup of persons with primarily acute exposures on 9/
11/2001. In addition, the independent association between
injury and heart attack/angina in the absence of PTSD is
similar to the report of a similar relationship with cardio-
vascular outcomes 5 to 6 years after 9/11 (Brackbill et al.
2014).

 Nonetheless, traumatic injury is frequently a principal
event leading to PTSD, but the mechanisms by which
injury, PTSD, or both may be precursors of heart disease
and other chronic illnesses require further elucidation.
Biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the
relationship between PTSD and heart disease (Boscarino
2004; Kubzansky et al. 2007) involving primarily neuro-
endocrinologic alterations leading to impaired adaptation
to stress (Kubzansky and Koenen 2009). In addition, there
are multiple other ways in which a traumatic injury can
contribute to chronic illness later in life. Some may involve
specific biological mechanisms, such as impact on organ
systems (e.g., intracranial injury is often associated with
hypertension), while the temporary or long-term loss of
function due to musculoskeletal injuries may affect behav-
iors such as exercise and diet that are themselves risk fac-
tors for cancer, heart disease, and other chronic illnesses.
In the Nurse’s Health Study, for example, it has been ob-
served that traumatic events (including injury to one’s self)
were significantly associated with cardiovascular disease
(defined as either myocardial infarction or stroke) in the
absence of PTSD symptoms (Sumner et al. 2015).
Our results pertain primarily to persons who were
present on 9/11 during attacks and could have experi-
enced a range of injury trauma and/or intense environ-
mental pollution from the dust/debris cloud. Some of
the area workers in the study sample likely experienced
additional exposures after returning to contaminated
workplaces that had not been thoroughly cleaned, but
these additional exposures would have been small in
comparison to those experienced on 9/11. For instance,
among persons who returned to work after 9/11, 70% of
those who had intense dust cloud exposure did not report
heavy dust in their workplace (based on wave 2 question
on damage to workplace). Such workers were obviously
sufficiently healthy to return to work and likely had less
respiratory conditions than those who did not return,
which is one possible explanation for the differences in re-
spiratory outcomes between the two groups.
Injuries that were sustained on 9/11 were significantly
associated with heart disease for a sub group of area
workers who returned to work after 9/11, but who were
also limited to returning to areas some distance from
the WTC site. Injuries also were associated with heart
disease but not statistically significant for persons who
did not return to the area. We believe that the difference
in the results between the two sub groups of workers
was due to a reduced sample for the non-returning
worker group. In a separate sensitivity analysis, we added
persons who had not returned for a month after 911 to
the non-return group and found a significant association
between injury and heart disease. Our results also sug-
gest that the physical effects of having an injury did not
necessarily prevent people from returning to work, but
that injury nonetheless was associated with increased
likelihood of heart attack or angina for persons who
were physically present during the attacks on 9/11.
In this analysis, we used intense dust cloud that re-
sulted from the two collapsing buildings in the morning
of 9/11 as the dominant acute respiratory related expos-
ure and we found it to be significantly associated with
asthma and non-neoplastic lung diseases. These findings
on acute pollution exposure on 9/11 are consistent with
other analysis showing that persistent lower respiratory
symptoms are strongly associated with a composite
measure that included dust cloud exposure as well as ex-
periencing or witnessing other traumatic events, which
are ostensibly acute exposures (Friedman et al. 2016).
Other studies have reported the association between
clinically based measures of lung function with arriving
on 9/11/2001 among rescue workers up to 6 years after
9/11/2001 (Aldrich et al. 2010; Wisnivesky et al. 2011)
and between dust or odor present more than 3 months
with lower respiratory symptoms 2 years after 9/11/2001
among residents in lower Manhattan (Lin et al. 2010;
Reibman et al. 2005).
PTSD was significantly associated only with non-
neoplastic lung diseases other than asthma. This finding
is consistent with comorbidity of PTSD and lower re-
spiratory symptoms that has been reported for both res-
cue/recovery workers (Friedman et al. 2013; Luft et al.
2012) and non- rescue/recovery workers (Nair et al.
2012). However, an association between PTSD and heart
attacks/angina was not observed, in contrast to a previ-
ous Registry study (Jordan et al. 2011). A putative ex-
planation is that by limiting the sample to persons who
were healthy prior to 2002, we excluded unhealthy per-
sons who exhibited a stronger PTSD-heart disease asso-
ciation. We performed a sensitivity analysis to address
this hypothesis by returning to our analytic sample the
~11,000 enrollees with chronic disease before 2002. We
found hazard ratios closer to the results of Jordan et al.,
though just shy of statistical significance. The lack of
statistical significance is likely due to the fact that Jordan
et al. included enrollees north of Chambers Street,
whereas we did not.
Injury, dust cloud exposure, and rescue/recovery worker
status were not associated with incident diabetes. The sig-
nificant association between PTSD and diabetes previously
reported by Miller-Archie et al. in the complete Registry
cohort was not observed in this sample (Miller-Archie et
al. 2014). Similar to the above discussion of PTSD-Heart
Disease association, we hypothesized that this differ-
ence was likely due to the inclusion of enrollees with
pre-9/11 histories of chronic diseases other than dia-
betes in the earlier study of Miller-Archie et al. We per-
formed sensitivity analyses which demonstrated that
reinstatement of enrollees with chronic disease before
Alper et al. Injury Epidemiology  (2017) 4:17 
Page 8 of 10
 2002 in our analytic sample produced results very similar
to those of Miller-Archie et al. 2014.
Strengths and limitations
A major strength of this study is that the large sample
size allowed us to investigate the effect of acute exposure
to 9/11 on a range of chronic diseases even while impos-
ing extensive restrictions on dates of presence at the WTC
site and prior medical history. The cohort has aged more
than 11 years since the acute 9/11 exposures took place,
providing an expectation of a natural increase in the fre-
quency of chronic disease endpoints.
An important limitation is lack of information on in-
jury severity, location in the body, whether the injury
was treated in an emergency department or hospital, or
the circumstances of the injury, leading us to use the
number of types of injuries as a proxy for injury severity.
However, there is evidence that more than one type of
injury is associated with increased risk of death and lon-
ger stays in hospital (Aharonson-Daniel et al. 2003).
Data on both exposures and outcomes such as number
of injuries, dust cloud exposure, PTSD symptoms, and
chronic disease diagnosis, were based on self-report, which
is subject to mis-reporting. However, there is substantial
concordance between many Registry findings and clinical
studies of World Trade Center survivors by other groups,
as well as internal validation studies of cancer (Li et al.
2016). Furthermore, the association between PTSD and
heart disease based on self-report (Jordan et al. 2011) is in
good agreement with results based on hospital discharge
records (Jordan et al. 2013).
A further limitation was loss to follow-up between sur-
veys, since 68 and 63% of the original sample completed
waves 2 and 3, respectively. Attrition may have affected
the present results, but this effect was found to be negli-
gible in a previous Registry study (Yu et al. 2015).
Conclusion
The present study provides evidence that acute/direct
exposure to the events of September 11, 2001 is associated
with chronic disease 11 years after the disaster. More spe-
cifically, sustaining an injury was associated with subse-
quent heart disease, and exposure to the dust cloud was
associated with respiratory disease. An implication of the
present study is that significant numbers of people who
were present on 9/11 could be vulnerable to developing
chronic diseases many years later. Clinicians should be
aware of the potential risk of chronic disease among those
exposed to the World Trade Center attacks.
